00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:50,737
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:57,516
EPISODE 1

4
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:52,571
100 PERCENT PURE CARBONIC ACID

5
00:01:53,488 --> 00:01:54,823
THIS IS THE TASTE OF TRUE BEER

6
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:24,770
Yes. The story will be published shortly,
at around 7 a.m.

7
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,565
But I said to <i>Despatch</i>, "Interlocking
fingers doesn't mean they're dating.

8
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,609
Ask anyone you see on the streets."

9
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:32,903
And if you look closely,
they aren't interlocked.

10
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:35,072
You're holding his wrist.

11
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,367
So I said, "They're obviously not dating."
I strongly denied it,

12
00:02:38,450 --> 00:02:41,745
and we concluded that you two
are good friends who like to pull pranks.

13
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:45,082
You call that a prank?

14
00:02:45,165 --> 00:02:48,460
Yes. I told them you two are very close
and that's how you usually fool around...

15
00:02:48,543 --> 00:02:50,712
I mean, that's how
you two usually hang out.

16
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:03,225
THOSE TWO ARE DEFINITELY DATING

17
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:07,020
Right.

18
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:08,814
We were close.

19
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:11,358
Although it's all over now.

20
00:03:16,071 --> 00:03:18,323
PLEASE LET ME JUST GO HOME

21
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:19,950
All right.

22
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,911
It already happened, so it's fine.

23
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,454
It's all good,

24
00:03:25,247 --> 00:03:28,041
but can you do something
about the blur effect?

25
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:31,420
Should I tell them to blur your face more?

26
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,714
No, that's not what I'm saying.

27
00:03:35,507 --> 00:03:37,801
They blurred my earrings too.

28
00:03:38,343 --> 00:03:41,346
It's the accessory item I'm promoting
the hardest out of the whole collection.

29
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,724
The blur effect should be...
How shall I put this?

30
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:47,686
Can they carefully shrink it
so that the earrings show right away?

31
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:51,106
Actually, a full shot would be better.

32
00:03:51,189 --> 00:03:53,191
That way, people can see my purse

33
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,818
-and shoes too.
-Got it.

34
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:59,698
Purchasing Manager.
What should you do, then?

35
00:04:00,323 --> 00:04:02,117
-Pardon me?
-The earrings, purse, and shoes.

36
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,618
You need to secure enough stock.

37
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,413
Orders will pile up
when they start trending.

38
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:07,956
Okay.

39
00:04:20,886 --> 00:04:22,429
Who is she? What's with all this fuss?

40
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:25,307
Isn't that her? The woman
who's supposedly dating actor Cha Sang-u?

41
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:28,560
You're right. Does she think
she's a celebrity? Why bring bodyguards?

42
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,437
She's not even that pretty.

43
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:32,147
-He deserves better.
-I bet it's her money.

44
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:35,734
I feel like I'm getting way more attention
than I usually do.

45
00:04:36,735 --> 00:04:38,487
Why did you hire these bodyguards?

46
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:41,865
Oh, in case Cha Sang-u's angry fans
may attack you...

47
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:43,325
"Angry fans"?

48
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,453
Why? I'm the one who should be angry,
not them.

49
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:47,996
Ms. Yoon, please calm down.

50
00:04:48,205 --> 00:04:50,290
We did half of our yearly revenue
in just one day.

51
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:52,000
The stock price is going up too.

52
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,886
<i>Look at you. Are you a celebrity or what?</i>

53
00:05:02,969 --> 00:05:04,221
Who's this?

54
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:07,724
Your eldest brother!

55
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:10,268
She doesn't even have
her brother's number? That rude stuck-up.

56
00:05:10,352 --> 00:05:11,311
Why did you call?

57
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,272
Hey. Last time, it was a baseball player.

58
00:05:14,356 --> 00:05:16,191
-A soccer player.
-I mean, a soccer player.

59
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,485
And this time, it's an idol singer?

60
00:05:18,568 --> 00:05:20,445
-No, an actor.
-<i>It's an actor?</i>

61
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:21,822
So? Is that why you called?

62
00:05:21,905 --> 00:05:23,824
<i>You probably don't care to know
what's going on</i>

63
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:26,743
<i>with our family because
you're too busy embarrassing us,</i>

64
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,703
but didn't you see the news?

65
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:30,455
Dad's being released on probation today.

66
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,375
<i>I don't care whether or not</i>

67
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:35,794
<i>you visit us on the holidays
or for the memorial ceremonies,</i>

68
00:05:36,253 --> 00:05:38,839
-<i>but shouldn't you come by today?</i>
-Is this your number?

69
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:41,299
Yes, it is.
Can you save it, for heaven's sake?

70
00:05:41,383 --> 00:05:42,634
Don't change your number.

71
00:05:42,968 --> 00:05:44,928
It'd be a hassle
to have to block it twice.

72
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:47,055
BLOCK NUMBER

73
00:05:50,225 --> 00:05:52,269
-Damn it.
-Did she hang up on you again?

74
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:54,688
-This little brat.
-Just leave her be.

75
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,607
It's been years since Se-ri estranged
the whole family. Don't bother.

76
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,985
I only called her
because Dad wanted me to.

77
00:06:00,902 --> 00:06:03,655
By the way, why did Father
summon all of us today?

78
00:06:04,406 --> 00:06:05,740
That must be it, right?

79
00:06:06,825 --> 00:06:09,828
-Announcing the heir.
-Announcing the heir.

80
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:13,039
<i>Chairman Yoon Jeung-pyeong
of Queens Group,</i>

81
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,292
<i>who was arrested in March
for violating the Act on</i>

82
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,835
<i>Aggravated Punishment </i>

83
00:06:16,918 --> 00:06:19,504
<i>of Economic Crimes, has been released
on probation after 283 days.</i>

84
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,591
<i>Chairman Yoon has announced
that he will be stepping down,</i>

85
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,968
<i>so all eyes are on who,
between his eldest son, Yoon Se-jun,</i>

86
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,845
<i>and his second eldest son, Yoon Se-hyeong,</i>

87
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:30,015
will end up taking over
the leadership of the group.

88
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,641
-Sir.
-Here he comes.

89
00:06:31,725 --> 00:06:34,394
-Please say a few words.
-A comment, please.

90
00:06:34,477 --> 00:06:36,938
-Please tell us!
-Just a comment, please!

91
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,323
<i>What is this?</i>

92
00:06:47,032 --> 00:06:48,283
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR RELEASE

93
00:06:48,366 --> 00:06:50,869
Father, I made this tofu cake

94
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:53,330
to congratulate you on your release.

95
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:54,456
My wife is the best.

96
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,583
-Congratulations, Dad.
-Congratulations!

97
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,795
You seem to be in a great mood today.

98
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,967
I'm so happy
that Father is finally out of jail.

99
00:07:07,385 --> 00:07:10,430
People are only interested
in the power dynamics among the siblings

100
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,309
and who will end up
inheriting the company.

101
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:20,148
I mean, what's wrong with people?

102
00:07:20,732 --> 00:07:23,526
I guess they think rich people like us
don't even have families.

103
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,153
We're so close, you know.

104
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,489
Right, Sang-a?

105
00:07:28,031 --> 00:07:29,240
Yes, of course.

106
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:36,122
Oh, right. Se-jun, you had a fistfight
with the labor union leader.

107
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:38,166
Has it all been sorted out?

108
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,464
They're in the process of
reaching a settlement, peacefully.

109
00:07:44,547 --> 00:07:46,758
It can happen when two guys
are trying to talk things out.

110
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:48,385
Exactly, it happens.

111
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,053
By the way, Sang-a,

112
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,014
I heard Se-hyeong got duped
by an investment scam.

113
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,683
When?

114
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:57,769
What can you do about the stock price
plunging 50 percent?

115
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:01,481
But the fact that people are questioning
your leadership skills and qualifications

116
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,359
makes me so angry.

117
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,947
Just because you fell victim
to a high-value fraud, people call you

118
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:11,366
an idiot and treat you like a retard.

119
00:08:11,449 --> 00:08:12,909
Who's calling my brother an idiot?

120
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,744
-I heard--
-It's not a fraud.

121
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,288
I just can't get a hold of my friend
at the moment. That's all.

122
00:08:17,372 --> 00:08:18,498
Take care of it,

123
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,542
or all the shareholders will sue you.

124
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,918
Mind your own business.

125
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:25,588
Dad, Se-jun beat up the union leader
and broke his tooth.

126
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,716
I promised him
that I'll pay for his dental implant.

127
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,718
-Are you boasting?
-You think I am, retard?

128
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:32,220
-What? You prick.
-How dare you call me a prick!

129
00:08:32,303 --> 00:08:33,805
-Where is Se-ri?
-You...

130
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,476
Did you not get the message
that I wanted Se-ri here today?

131
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,730
I tried getting in touch with her
many times,

132
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:43,857
but it looks like that brat

133
00:08:45,108 --> 00:08:46,276
blocked my number.

134
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:13,678
Dad, congratulations
on getting out on probation.

135
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:17,932
I heard you wanted me to be here today.
Is there something you'd like to say?

136
00:09:18,016 --> 00:09:19,392
You should

137
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:21,394
move back in.

138
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,689
Is that it?

139
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,608
I was wondering why.

140
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,986
You look great.

141
00:09:30,862 --> 00:09:32,405
Look after your health.

142
00:09:33,073 --> 00:09:35,867
I came and said hi, so I'll get going.

143
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,165
I want you to take over my position.

144
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:43,291
-Dad.
-Father.

145
00:09:43,374 --> 00:09:44,292
Honey.

146
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,299
Listen.

147
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:55,512
You left home and started your own company
ten years ago.

148
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,555
I've definitely seen what you can do.

149
00:09:57,889 --> 00:09:58,932
So,

150
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,893
I want you to run the company in my place.

151
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:19,577
-Okay, I'll do that.
-Hey.

152
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,704
-You brat, you don't know anything!
-That's right!

153
00:10:21,788 --> 00:10:23,706
If I'm your successor, will I have

154
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,459
the authority to appoint new CEOs
for our subsidiaries?

155
00:10:26,543 --> 00:10:27,502
Of course, you will.

156
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:29,879
That's great.

157
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:34,509
I always thought that a few of the CEOs
are underqualified.

158
00:10:34,592 --> 00:10:38,012
For instance, those who tend
to clash with their employees

159
00:10:38,429 --> 00:10:40,306
and those who often get sued

160
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:44,144
or have caused the company great damage
due to their own ignorance.

161
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,730
We should fire such CEOs
without any hesitation.

162
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,232
I'll leave it to you.

163
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:51,776
Thank you.

164
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,487
Give me some time though.

165
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:57,991
My company recently launched
an extreme-sports apparel line,

166
00:10:58,074 --> 00:10:59,659
so it's grown even bigger.

167
00:10:59,742 --> 00:11:02,036
I'll look for
a good management specialist.

168
00:11:02,287 --> 00:11:05,123
All right.
Can you meet me in my office tomorrow?

169
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:06,749
Tomorrow, I can't.

170
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:09,502
We're doing the final test
on an important new product.

171
00:11:10,128 --> 00:11:11,129
Then,

172
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:14,716
I plan to announce it at the upcoming
general shareholders' meeting,

173
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,011
so let's meet before that.

174
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:20,346
Okay.

175
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,932
Then enjoy your dinner, everyone.

176
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:26,269
You might get indigestion if I stay.
I'm leaving.

177
00:12:02,305 --> 00:12:04,390
Ms. Yoon, when did you learn paragliding?

178
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,808
Did I not tell you?

179
00:12:05,892 --> 00:12:08,978
I got my certification in Interlaken
when I went to Switzerland.

180
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:11,272
Oh, I see. We could've tested it
and just submitted

181
00:12:11,356 --> 00:12:13,733
a report to you.
You didn't have to do this yourself.

182
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,027
It looks like I'll get quite busy.

183
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:19,030
I'm in a rush
because I need to climb someplace.

184
00:12:19,113 --> 00:12:20,490
"Climb"? Where?

185
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:23,451
High up.

186
00:12:23,534 --> 00:12:25,828
You're already in a high place.
So you mean, even higher?

187
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,497
As early as tomorrow morning,

188
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,667
you'll see my name all over the news.

189
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:32,460
Don't be too surprised.

190
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,170
Will it be another dating scandal?

191
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:39,801
No.

192
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:42,971
All right. Shall we get started?

193
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,141
The wind is quite strong though.

194
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:50,353
We've checked the weather forecast,
but will you be all right?

195
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:51,479
Mr. Hong.

196
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:53,815
Why does the wind blow?

197
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:55,942
Well, I'm not sure.

198
00:12:57,652 --> 00:12:59,529
It's blowing to move on,

199
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,614
not to stay.

200
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,201
The wind needs to keep moving

201
00:13:06,536 --> 00:13:08,079
for me to fly.

202
00:13:28,474 --> 00:13:30,476
Ms. Yoon, please be careful!

203
00:14:13,728 --> 00:14:15,897
You're doing a great job, seriously.

204
00:14:16,564 --> 00:14:19,025
You've been working so hard, Se-ri.

205
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,989
Now, I can just soar high up.

206
00:14:27,367 --> 00:14:28,534
This is nice.

207
00:14:29,619 --> 00:14:31,954
Look at the beautiful color of the forest

208
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,624
and the lush green fields.

209
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:38,086
I haven't seen a scenery like this
in so long.

210
00:14:40,797 --> 00:14:41,798
My gosh.

211
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:45,134
Look, that tractor is flying in the wind.

212
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:47,678
Why is that happening?

213
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:57,105
My gosh.

214
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:29,637
KOREAN DEMILITARIZED ZONE
NORTHERN LIMIT LINE 1,000M

215
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,393
FOR PEACE, PROSPERITY, AND UNIFICATION
OF KOREAN PENINSULA

216
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:18,436
Captain Ri.

217
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:21,981
They're headed in this direction,
judging from the sound of the gunshots.

218
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:26,402
Maybe it's a deserter from the South.

219
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,905
The combat site is 400m away
from our current location.

220
00:16:29,489 --> 00:16:31,491
Going in at eleven o'clock.
Total count, ten.

221
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:34,952
K2 automatic rifle, six in total.

222
00:16:35,161 --> 00:16:37,538
And Tokarev TT-33. Three are in use.

223
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:40,333
-TT-33?
-They're our comrades.

224
00:16:59,769 --> 00:17:00,645
Step back.

225
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:03,523
Take one more step,
and you'll be entering our garrison.

226
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,066
GARRISON: MILITARY POST

227
00:17:05,149 --> 00:17:07,693
Hand these three over, and we'll back off.

228
00:17:07,777 --> 00:17:09,612
-They're our comrades.
-Captain.

229
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:13,407
We got the State Security Department's
approval and came here to hunt deers.

230
00:17:13,491 --> 00:17:15,868
We just got lost because of the tornado.

231
00:17:15,952 --> 00:17:18,788
They crossed the Southern Limit Line

232
00:17:18,871 --> 00:17:21,040
and got caught
while digging up cultural artifacts.

233
00:17:21,123 --> 00:17:22,208
Can you prove it?

234
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,836
This shows screenshots
from our thermal camera footage.

235
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,296
Is anyone injured?

236
00:17:29,507 --> 00:17:32,218
-No.
-We've gauged the situation,

237
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,844
so let's drop our weapons.

238
00:17:34,971 --> 00:17:38,307
I swear on my country's honor
that we will strictly punish them.

239
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,184
When it comes to punishment,

240
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:43,396
we, the North, certainly outdo the South.

241
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,818
We'll drop our weapons
on the count of three.

242
00:17:49,819 --> 00:17:50,778
One.

243
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:53,531
Two.

244
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:56,450
Three.

245
00:18:08,963 --> 00:18:10,381
MILITARY POLICE

246
00:18:33,821 --> 00:18:36,115
<i>Alpha One.
Just return. Don't get into conflict.</i>

247
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,534
<i>-Don't get into conflict with the North.
-Thunderbolt One.</i>

248
00:18:38,618 --> 00:18:39,535
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

249
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:42,747
<i>No conflict with the South.
Return at once.</i>

250
00:19:28,793 --> 00:19:30,086
Greetings, sir.

251
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:32,838
Company Five is on standby
to transfer the grave robbers,

252
00:19:32,922 --> 00:19:35,758
whom we arrested
while patrolling the demilitarized zone.

253
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:37,301
Company Five Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok.

254
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:38,469
Good work.

255
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:42,139
Anything else?

256
00:19:43,516 --> 00:19:45,685
Because of the tornado earlier in the day,

257
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,813
a lot of the barbed-wire fences
fell down along with the trees.

258
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:52,483
The high-voltage transformer for
the electric fence isn't working either.

259
00:19:52,566 --> 00:19:55,319
We should tighten security
for the areas with the damages

260
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,405
until everything is fixed.

261
00:19:57,488 --> 00:19:58,823
Yes, we should.

262
00:20:01,826 --> 00:20:04,120
Is it tomorrow? The company switch.

263
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,371
Yes, sir.

264
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:07,665
What a shame.
All of this happened on your last day.

265
00:20:08,124 --> 00:20:10,751
From the tornado to the grave robbers.

266
00:20:10,835 --> 00:20:12,086
That's okay, sir.

267
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:17,508
They probably crossed
the Southern Limit Line

268
00:20:17,591 --> 00:20:19,760
due to a misunderstanding.

269
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:21,762
Let's be lenient.

270
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,056
It happened inside our patrol zone.

271
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,516
It cannot be taken lightly.

272
00:20:25,599 --> 00:20:28,185
You're well aware of the fact
that the State Security Department

273
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:31,021
issued them the pass
to enter the demilitarized zone.

274
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,065
Nothing good will come out of this

275
00:20:33,149 --> 00:20:34,984
being brought up at the final assessment.

276
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:38,988
So the State Security Department
gave those grave robbers permission

277
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,574
to cross the Southern Limit Line
and steal artifacts.

278
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,534
Is that what you're saying?

279
00:20:47,621 --> 00:20:49,582
Of course not, Captain Ri.

280
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,375
I promised the captain from the South

281
00:20:51,459 --> 00:20:53,085
that we will investigate this matter.

282
00:20:53,169 --> 00:20:54,420
I wish to keep that promise.

283
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:57,882
All right. Go ahead
and keep your promise, then.

284
00:20:58,382 --> 00:21:01,677
But can I make a promise too, Captain Ri?

285
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,849
I, Jo Cheol Gang, never go easy on anyone
no matter what their ranks are.

286
00:21:07,725 --> 00:21:10,811
If you commit any act
that may threaten our army's security

287
00:21:11,687 --> 00:21:13,814
and get caught by me,
you will be finished on the spot.

288
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:20,112
Of course,
you'll never do anything like that.

289
00:21:20,738 --> 00:21:21,781
But they say

290
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:24,658
that a thing or a person

291
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,162
is bound to change all the time.

292
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:30,331
Isn't that how life is, after all?

293
00:21:35,795 --> 00:21:37,880
<i>Gosh, don't even get me started.</i>

294
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:42,218
If he gets that cocky
with a State Security Department officer,

295
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:43,677
what's going to happen to us?

296
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:46,972
I guess he'll look all cool and tough,

297
00:21:47,056 --> 00:21:52,728
but the State Security Department
will keep a close watch on us

298
00:21:52,812 --> 00:21:55,940
from now on because of it.
That's what I'm trying to say.

299
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:58,943
By the way, how did Captain Ri
end up at the outpost line?

300
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:01,737
He's from Pyongyang,
so he probably has a high status.

301
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,489
Why not just enjoy
a comfortable life there?

302
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:07,034
That's why they say
you've got to watch out for the rich.

303
00:22:07,618 --> 00:22:09,954
From front to back,
they want everything under their control

304
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:13,332
so that they can forever win
General Kim's love.

305
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:15,668
-I see.
-All right.

306
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:20,464
Just know that this wine is from 1953,

307
00:22:21,048 --> 00:22:25,719
which was before the armistice was signed.

308
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:27,263
-Oh, my.
-All right.

309
00:22:28,097 --> 00:22:30,307
Just one glass of this 60-year-old
snake wine

310
00:22:30,391 --> 00:22:34,645
can make even those suffering
from malnutrition jump around with vigor.

311
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:38,107
-This is medicine, not wine.
-Medicine.

312
00:22:38,482 --> 00:22:40,818
Then I'd love a glass of this medicine.

313
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,153
Sure thing.

314
00:22:43,237 --> 00:22:44,613
-Here.
-Thank you.

315
00:22:44,697 --> 00:22:46,031
Enjoy. All right, you're next.

316
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:49,785
But is it okay to drink like this
while on duty?

317
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:54,081
Hey, we worked day and night
for two months straight.

318
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,375
The company switch will happen
in the morning,

319
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,751
so it will be fine.

320
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:31,744
-You cannot go in.
-Please.

321
00:23:31,827 --> 00:23:32,828
My boss...

322
00:23:32,911 --> 00:23:34,663
My boss is a lady.

323
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:37,249
Gosh, excuse me. Wait!

324
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:38,292
My gosh.

325
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:39,877
119 RESCUE SERVICES

326
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:42,713
Please calm down.

327
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,552
-Sir, you must keep out.
-Let go!

328
00:23:49,136 --> 00:23:50,012
Wait!

329
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,306
Excuse me! Hey.

330
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,267
-Where's my boss?
-I don't know.

331
00:23:55,351 --> 00:23:57,186
Didn't you record anything?
Where's the camera?

332
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:59,772
-In that situation? I couldn't.
-What did you do, then?

333
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:00,898
I nearly died!

334
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,776
-Okay, but where is Ms. Yoon?
-I'm going to sue you people!

335
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,110
What are you talking about?

336
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:07,988
Wait. Gosh, this is nuts.
How unprofessional.

337
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:10,157
I told her we could just submit
a report to her.

338
00:24:10,658 --> 00:24:13,202
Why did she suddenly want
to do this herself? This is crazy.

339
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,580
She talked about
going high up or something.

340
00:24:18,457 --> 00:24:21,251
How far have you gone, Ms. Yoon?

341
00:24:54,618 --> 00:24:55,703
What?

342
00:24:57,955 --> 00:24:59,289
Did I faint?

343
00:25:00,457 --> 00:25:01,709
Gosh.

344
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:03,043
Where am I?

345
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,050
It hurts.

346
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:13,804
What is this place?

347
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:20,394
This is Se-ri. Answer me, Mr. Hong.

348
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:23,522
Hello?

349
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,233
What the hell?

350
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,571
Where am I?

351
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:33,782
Am I at a national park or what?

352
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:39,204
Gosh! My goodness.

353
00:25:39,997 --> 00:25:41,123
This is too high.

354
00:25:42,958 --> 00:25:44,042
Hello?

355
00:25:45,085 --> 00:25:47,671
Hello? Anybody around?

356
00:25:48,964 --> 00:25:52,342
Help! Anybody around?

357
00:25:55,012 --> 00:25:57,097
Didn't you hear something just now?

358
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,100
Pardon? I didn't hear anything, sir.

359
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:03,687
A woman's voice.
It sounded like she was crying.

360
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:05,647
Stop it. You're scaring me.

361
00:26:05,731 --> 00:26:07,858
<i>This is Owl. Pigeon, answer.</i>

362
00:26:09,735 --> 00:26:11,653
This is Pigeon. What's the matter?

363
00:26:11,737 --> 00:26:12,988
<i>You'll have to come here.</i>

364
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:16,950
<i>The tornado damaged
all the barricades and sand plates.</i>

365
00:26:17,034 --> 00:26:18,285
Okay.

366
00:26:19,161 --> 00:26:21,038
-Captain Ri.
-You go ahead.

367
00:26:21,121 --> 00:26:22,456
I'll look around this area.

368
00:26:23,207 --> 00:26:24,291
Yes, sir.

369
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:54,071
Here! Someone's here!

370
00:26:56,365 --> 00:26:57,741
You're a soldier.

371
00:26:58,367 --> 00:27:01,495
Is the army nearby dispatched to find me?

372
00:27:14,925 --> 00:27:16,426
-Password.
-What?

373
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,972
What is that?

374
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,518
Don't come near. Talk to me from there.

375
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:26,645
Talk to me from there.

376
00:27:27,813 --> 00:27:28,689
Come down.

377
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:30,065
I wish I could go down,

378
00:27:30,399 --> 00:27:33,193
but as you can see, it's so high up here.

379
00:27:33,277 --> 00:27:36,530
And I don't have any energy left.

380
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:40,909
Oh, my. I'm coming down.
I'm unbuckling now.

381
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,636
State your occupation and name.

382
00:28:04,141 --> 00:28:08,353
Well, I work for a fashion company.

383
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:12,608
I don't think you will know its name.

384
00:28:13,609 --> 00:28:18,280
And I don't feel comfortable telling you
my name because we just met.

385
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,492
And...

386
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:28,123
You made a tough decision.
Welcome to the Republic of Korea.

387
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:29,708
"Republic of Korea"?

388
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,002
What was it called?

389
00:28:32,294 --> 00:28:35,505
Defector. You're a defector
from North Korea, right?

390
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:39,927
Maybe you're not.

391
00:28:41,845 --> 00:28:42,846
An armed communist...

392
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,265
Or a spy?

393
00:28:50,187 --> 00:28:51,021
Are you

394
00:28:51,605 --> 00:28:52,814
a North Korean elite

395
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:56,902
urgently dispatched

396
00:28:57,486 --> 00:29:01,823
in order to carry out a special mission?

397
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:06,203
Whatever you are, don't worry.
I will not report you or anything.

398
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:09,873
I don't mind others' business at all.
I'm busy with my own business.

399
00:29:10,332 --> 00:29:12,000
-Now if you'll excuse me.
-Halt.

400
00:29:12,084 --> 00:29:13,502
I halted. Look. I'm standing still.

401
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:22,386
Listen.

402
00:29:23,387 --> 00:29:25,055
Could you just let me go home?

403
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,808
-Where do you live?
-Seoul, Gangnam-gu, Cheong...

404
00:29:29,518 --> 00:29:31,937
I can't give you any further details.

405
00:29:32,562 --> 00:29:33,605
It's a long way.

406
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:36,733
I will find my way.
Thanks for your concern.

407
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:38,568
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

408
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:41,321
I didn't come to the South.

409
00:29:42,364 --> 00:29:44,199
-Pardon?
-You came to the North.

410
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,789
North? North Korea?

411
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,750
North Korea?

412
00:29:56,253 --> 00:29:59,673
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

413
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,633
How is this place...

414
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:10,142
Seriously?

415
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,645
Come on. Stop kidding me.

416
00:30:20,277 --> 00:30:21,111
No way.

417
00:30:21,194 --> 00:30:23,947
We're at the demilitarized zone,
the 38th parallel.

418
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:26,783
-It's the Northern Limit Line.
-"Demilitarized zone"?

419
00:30:26,867 --> 00:30:29,161
The place where the film
<i>Joint Security Area</i> was set in?

420
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,705
Then this is not completely North Korea.

421
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:34,416
It's the territory of
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

422
00:30:34,499 --> 00:30:37,169
And an unidentified South Korean
trespassed on the land.

423
00:30:37,252 --> 00:30:39,004
-You'll go through legal procedures--
-Wait.

424
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,008
I didn't trespass. Look over there.

425
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,303
I was paragliding.

426
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,096
The weather was all sunny and great.

427
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:50,140
But then suddenly it went crazy
and a tornado came,

428
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:52,601
which wasn't even on the weathercast.
Tractors and pigs were

429
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,853
all flying around
and the flood carried away people.

430
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:57,814
I was carried away by the wind too.
Then I passed out.

431
00:30:59,316 --> 00:31:00,525
And I found myself here.

432
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:05,530
So what I'm saying is, it was an accident.
It couldn't be helped.

433
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,245
Okay.

434
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,415
Thank you. You understand.

435
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:17,626
Explain like that
when you are investigated.

436
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,963
What? Why would I be investigated?

437
00:31:22,047 --> 00:31:23,548
According to the law of the republic,

438
00:31:23,632 --> 00:31:25,717
voluntary enterers must be tied up
and investigated.

439
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:27,761
Tied up? You will tie me up?

440
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:29,596
You flew over
on an unpowered flying vehicle.

441
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,598
We can't send you back
without any investigation.

442
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:34,851
Then what if they frame me

443
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,856
as a beautiful spy
or a beautiful secret agent,

444
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:43,151
torture me, and send me
to places like Aoji Coal Mine?

445
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:44,528
Then what do I do?

446
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,446
That won't happen.

447
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,657
-Are you sure?
-I can't say I'm sure.

448
00:31:49,491 --> 00:31:52,285
Then how am I supposed to trust you?
Would you if you were me?

449
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,413
Whether you trust me or not
is not my business.

450
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:55,997
Come on.

451
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,542
Don't be so irresponsible.

452
00:32:01,294 --> 00:32:03,630
I think it won't take long if I run.

453
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,091
Please just let me go. Please.

454
00:32:06,675 --> 00:32:08,176
I'm a really good runner.

455
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:10,011
I will be gone in no time.

456
00:32:10,095 --> 00:32:12,347
-I won't cause any harm to you.
-Halt.

457
00:32:12,431 --> 00:32:15,183
If you turn a blind eye to this,
you're saving a person's life.

458
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:17,102
Wait. That's a minefield.

459
00:32:18,270 --> 00:32:19,604
Mine?

460
00:32:21,064 --> 00:32:22,315
Where?

461
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:24,192
There are many lost mines there.

462
00:32:24,276 --> 00:32:26,820
They were carried away by the heavy rain
and buried out of sight.

463
00:32:28,864 --> 00:32:30,532
I'm an expert in that area.

464
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,952
Do you think you can get out
without my help?

465
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:36,455
I get it, but could you just stay there?

466
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,582
Why does he keep approaching?

467
00:32:39,958 --> 00:32:42,919
If you don't listen to me and move,
you might lose your ankle...

468
00:32:49,885 --> 00:32:52,304
-What's the matter?
-I'm fine.

469
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:54,055
You don't seem fine.

470
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:55,223
I said I'm fine.

471
00:32:56,308 --> 00:32:58,143
I think you stepped on a lost mine.

472
00:32:59,269 --> 00:33:01,646
-No, I didn't.
-You didn't?

473
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,149
Are you sure?

474
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,402
Are you sure you don't need my help?

475
00:33:08,945 --> 00:33:11,072
Then try moving and turning around.

476
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:15,118
You can't move.

477
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,204
This is Mountain Hawk. This is Mountain...

478
00:33:24,461 --> 00:33:27,464
<i>This is Pigeon. Answer, Mountain Hawk</i>

479
00:33:30,467 --> 00:33:33,303
<i>This is Pigeon. Answer, Mountain Hawk</i>

480
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:42,896
Thank you.

481
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,066
Don't thank me. I'm not giving it to you.

482
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:49,152
Don't forget that I have a gun in my hand.

483
00:33:49,236 --> 00:33:51,279
Don't forget that if you shoot me,

484
00:33:51,446 --> 00:33:54,199
you're losing the only person
who can help you.

485
00:33:55,325 --> 00:33:58,328
By the way, I don't have
much knowledge in that area.

486
00:33:58,411 --> 00:34:00,914
Do experts sometimes step on mines too?

487
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,585
If you keep standing like that,
your feet will go numb.

488
00:34:05,669 --> 00:34:07,629
-I'm okay.
-Okay.

489
00:34:08,338 --> 00:34:10,715
You keep saying you're okay,
so I'll just head off.

490
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,801
I have a lot of things to do. Well, then.

491
00:34:13,343 --> 00:34:14,177
Fine.

492
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,264
Leave that at least.

493
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,902
It will soon drift down to you.

494
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,947
I need some time to escape too.
You understand me, right?

495
00:34:38,994 --> 00:34:42,289
I'm in huge trouble myself,
so I don't have the time

496
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,541
to worry about others.

497
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,251
Bye.

498
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:53,842
Don't shoot me from the back.
That's just sneaky.

499
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,220
Do you see the rectangular box
in front of you?

500
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,515
-I do.
-That's a PMD series mine.

501
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:03,018
Why are there so many mines here?

502
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,936
Try to stay as close to the bank
as possible.

503
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,318
Keep watching your step.

504
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,988
I'm saying this
because we will never meet again.

505
00:35:19,326 --> 00:35:20,869
Your looks are totally my type.

506
00:35:21,786 --> 00:35:24,414
If our countries reunite,
let's meet a different occasion.

507
00:35:24,497 --> 00:35:25,957
How could you

508
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:28,627
make a joke in this situation?

509
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,755
By the way, which way is the South?

510
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:38,762
Keep following the path,
then you will meet a forked road.

511
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,013
Then...

512
00:35:42,766 --> 00:35:43,808
go to the right.

513
00:35:47,062 --> 00:35:48,313
Can I trust you?

514
00:35:48,396 --> 00:35:49,814
Stop asking and make a decision.

515
00:35:49,898 --> 00:35:51,232
I already said my answer.

516
00:35:55,362 --> 00:35:56,905
Captain Ri.

517
00:35:57,697 --> 00:35:59,032
Is everything okay?

518
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,533
-Captain Ri.
-I'm here!

519
00:36:14,047 --> 00:36:15,423
Captain Ri.

520
00:36:17,884 --> 00:36:19,052
I've been looking for you.

521
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,345
Tell the troops

522
00:36:20,428 --> 00:36:23,682
to arrest anyone suspicious
found in the area.

523
00:36:23,765 --> 00:36:25,350
Is it a voluntary enterer?

524
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,060
Or is it a spy?

525
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:30,939
It's a South Korean woman
who came by an accident.

526
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,692
Arrest her without shooting her.
Forward the command.

527
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,276
Yes, sir.

528
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,032
<i>This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.</i>

529
00:36:41,616 --> 00:36:44,202
<i>This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.</i>

530
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,579
Who is looking for Cuckoo?

531
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:49,457
<i>This is Pigeon. Answer, Cuckoo.</i>

532
00:36:52,544 --> 00:36:54,254
I sent the command by radio.

533
00:37:00,510 --> 00:37:01,886
Captain Ri.

534
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:03,972
Is everything okay?

535
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:11,187
Did you...

536
00:37:12,147 --> 00:37:13,440
Don't worry.

537
00:37:13,523 --> 00:37:15,191
I will call the engineer corps right away.

538
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,319
Why don't you do it,
First Lieutenant Park?

539
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,114
You have disarmed mines, right?

540
00:37:21,823 --> 00:37:23,366
Just once when I was a recruit.

541
00:37:29,122 --> 00:37:31,124
I trust you.

542
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:33,209
I will do my best, sir.

543
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,216
Wait. Are you going to do it
with bare hands?

544
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,515
You need to remove the safety pin
with this first.

545
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,476
Yes, sir. Don't worry, sir.

546
00:37:50,018 --> 00:37:51,269
Be careful.

547
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,898
If you don't remove the pin correctly,
you might hit the fuse.

548
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,941
Yes, sir.

549
00:37:58,568 --> 00:38:00,862
Be extra careful with that part.

550
00:38:12,332 --> 00:38:14,292
Make sure to do it gently.

551
00:38:17,587 --> 00:38:18,671
Be careful.

552
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,809
You said you trusted me.

553
00:38:35,104 --> 00:38:36,272
I did.

554
00:38:40,777 --> 00:38:43,071
-Is it over?
-Yes, it's over, sir.

555
00:38:56,292 --> 00:38:57,377
Let's go.

556
00:38:57,961 --> 00:38:59,003
Yes, sir.

557
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,806
He said I should go right.

558
00:39:10,807 --> 00:39:12,308
I must trust him. There's no other way.

559
00:39:12,392 --> 00:39:14,310
He didn't look like he would lie.

560
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:18,773
How do I trust him? He's from the North.
This must be a scheme.

561
00:39:30,952 --> 00:39:34,372
A South Korean woman seems to

562
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:37,208
have stumbled into our area.

563
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:40,545
We were told to shoot her right away,

564
00:39:40,837 --> 00:39:42,797
so she must be some kind of an armed spy.

565
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,465
-A spy?
-An armed spy?

566
00:39:44,549 --> 00:39:47,010
Gosh. First grave robbers, and now a spy.

567
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,804
All this happened just before
I switch commands. I'm so unlucky.

568
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:52,307
I'm totally exhausted.

569
00:39:52,891 --> 00:39:55,268
Hey, spread out in pairs.

570
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,353
Yes, sir. Let's go.

571
00:39:57,437 --> 00:40:01,065
Why couldn't she just come tomorrow
after we switch commands?

572
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:03,776
Then the 6th company would
have taken the job.

573
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,070
Still, if we catch the armed spy,

574
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,697
we will be rewarded well.

575
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:10,700
Master Sergeant Pyo, you need a promotion.

576
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:13,745
-A promotion?
-Yes, sir.

577
00:40:15,914 --> 00:40:20,293
Then maybe an infallible marksman,
Pyo Chi Su, should make a move.

578
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:22,211
-Master Sergeant.
-Yes.

579
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,672
-I think I have to go to the toilet.
-Go ahead.

580
00:40:40,146 --> 00:40:42,815
I was wondering when I will receive
the General's medal.

581
00:40:43,358 --> 00:40:44,567
I guess it's today.

582
00:40:57,372 --> 00:40:58,331
Did I

583
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,041
see it wrong?

584
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:04,212
There she is.

585
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,887
Hey, stay still. If she was still,
I would've definitely shot her.

586
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,057
That damn woman is freaking fast.

587
00:41:23,022 --> 00:41:25,608
Is she a ghost or what?

588
00:41:26,401 --> 00:41:28,695
This is Cuckoo.

589
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:30,446
I request backup.

590
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:33,199
Goodness.

591
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,170
Why are they chasing me?
I thought I was free to go.

592
00:41:58,474 --> 00:41:59,851
MINEFIELD

593
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:03,563
But that area is packed with mines.

594
00:42:10,028 --> 00:42:11,029
UNCHECKED MINEFIELD

595
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,077
Why is she running over a minefield?

596
00:42:18,578 --> 00:42:20,663
Our fence is over there.

597
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:26,461
You two.
Follow her along the left clear path.

598
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:28,254
-I'll take the right path.
-Yes, sir.

599
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,134
That damn woman!

600
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:49,025
Stop there!

601
00:42:49,692 --> 00:42:51,611
-Damn it.
-Stop there, woman!

602
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,529
Come here!

603
00:42:55,448 --> 00:42:56,824
Hey! Come here!

604
00:42:57,533 --> 00:42:59,410
We will not kill you.

605
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:03,372
Hey! You! That woman is crazy.

606
00:43:03,498 --> 00:43:05,792
-Why is she going there?
-How did they come here?

607
00:43:07,794 --> 00:43:09,253
No. Don't go.

608
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:14,050
That's not the way back to your country!

609
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,802
Come back here!

610
00:43:15,927 --> 00:43:18,054
-What?
-That's the wrong way!

611
00:43:18,137 --> 00:43:20,223
-Come back!
-What are they saying?

612
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:22,642
If you go there, we will all die!

613
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:24,894
Don't go!

614
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:28,439
-That's not the right way!
-Don't go!

615
00:43:36,364 --> 00:43:38,074
What an idiot.

616
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:40,785
Why did she cross that fence?

617
00:43:43,955 --> 00:43:45,581
What do we do, sir?

618
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:47,166
Radio the guard post first.

619
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:51,212
This is Cuckoo. Answer, Seagull.

620
00:43:51,879 --> 00:43:54,173
This is Cuckoo. Answer, Seagull.

621
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:58,010
<i>Seagull. Hey! Seagull!</i>

622
00:43:58,261 --> 00:44:02,014
"People in love are meant to meet.

623
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:04,600
No matter how far you travel,

624
00:44:04,684 --> 00:44:06,060
in the end,

625
00:44:07,687 --> 00:44:08,980
you will come back."

626
00:44:24,537 --> 00:44:26,414
Put that necklace on.

627
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,629
<i>Dear my proud son, Eun Dong.</i>

628
00:45:15,296 --> 00:45:18,507
<i>Are you staying healthy in the army?</i>

629
00:45:19,008 --> 00:45:21,177
<i>Ten years could be a long time
or a short time,</i>

630
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,929
<i>depending on how you think of it.</i>

631
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:26,807
<i>I wish you finish
your ten years of service safely</i>

632
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:30,311
<i>and come back home
with a hero's medal on your chest.</i>

633
00:45:30,394 --> 00:45:31,520
Mother.

634
00:46:04,136 --> 00:46:05,429
SE-RI

635
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:12,478
<i>The person you have called
is not available...</i>

636
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:24,490
Hello.

637
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,119
Secretary Na.

638
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,621
What?

639
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,958
What are you talking about?

640
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:36,127
Today,

641
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,880
I want to ask you for intercessory prayer.

642
00:46:39,964 --> 00:46:41,841
My husband and I have

643
00:46:42,925 --> 00:46:45,761
faced an unexpected crisis.

644
00:46:47,763 --> 00:46:52,059
All we did was to be nice,
and this is how it paid off.

645
00:46:52,143 --> 00:46:55,521
That low-class...

646
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:57,898
someone is

647
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,235
coveting my husband's position.

648
00:47:01,318 --> 00:47:02,445
MY HUSBAND

649
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:06,449
Since my husband is
the eldest son in the family,

650
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:07,908
he should...

651
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,119
MY HUSBAND

652
00:47:10,202 --> 00:47:13,205
Please excuse me for a second. I'm sorry.

653
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:18,044
<i>Honey.</i>

654
00:47:18,294 --> 00:47:20,755
I'm at the prayer meeting.
I'll call you when it's over.

655
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:21,964
<i>Se-ri is missing.</i>

656
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:23,132
What?

657
00:47:24,091 --> 00:47:26,093
What? Really?

658
00:47:27,720 --> 00:47:29,013
Okay.

659
00:47:29,930 --> 00:47:32,183
Please keep me updated.

660
00:47:32,266 --> 00:47:34,226
Okay.

661
00:47:37,104 --> 00:47:38,772
Oh, my God.

662
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:40,232
Goodness.

663
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:48,449
Ms. Do, what's the matter?

664
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:50,284
You see.

665
00:47:51,077 --> 00:47:53,079
I didn't even start the prayer,

666
00:47:53,162 --> 00:47:55,081
but God has responded already.

667
00:47:55,164 --> 00:47:56,499
-Praise God.
-Hallelujah.

668
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:02,713
Helicopters, drones, probes, search dogs.

669
00:48:02,797 --> 00:48:05,633
We are using every method we can use
for the search.

670
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:07,885
-So don't worry.
-Well.

671
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,012
I'm sure you'll take care of it.

672
00:48:11,764 --> 00:48:14,517
What worries us the most is...

673
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:17,937
the press.

674
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,980
Once the reporters begin
to write articles,

675
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,148
things will get complicated.

676
00:48:21,315 --> 00:48:23,317
-The stock price will drop too.
-Right.

677
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,693
Don't worry about that.

678
00:48:24,777 --> 00:48:26,737
The incident will be reported,

679
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,907
but we will keep
the personal information secret.

680
00:48:30,491 --> 00:48:33,202
In this case, how long is the golden hour?

681
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,830
This is a disaster situation,

682
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:37,873
so there's no fixed golden hour,

683
00:48:37,957 --> 00:48:40,126
but from my personal experience,

684
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:42,253
It's about 48 hours.

685
00:48:42,336 --> 00:48:44,130
-That long?
-That's long.

686
00:48:44,213 --> 00:48:45,881
-Excuse me?
-If she is alive,

687
00:48:45,965 --> 00:48:48,008
she should have called us by now.

688
00:48:48,092 --> 00:48:50,094
You said she wasn't
in nearby hospitals either.

689
00:48:50,177 --> 00:48:51,971
It's been already over ten hours.

690
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:55,516
The chances that she's alive
must be pretty low.

691
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,768
-Right?
-Right.

692
00:48:58,644 --> 00:49:00,771
You have dogs. Bring more dogs.

693
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:03,649
Look at how big the land is.

694
00:49:03,732 --> 00:49:05,151
At this rate, it will take forever.

695
00:49:05,234 --> 00:49:08,696
-Sir, we're already--
-There's nobody over there.

696
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,323
No one is searching over there.

697
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:20,207
You said you would leave.

698
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,376
You said you would disown our family.

699
00:49:30,593 --> 00:49:33,053
I guess you want to take
what you can take.

700
00:49:34,722 --> 00:49:37,057
Tell Dad that you can't do it.

701
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:43,063
Whenever I get startled

702
00:49:43,772 --> 00:49:46,275
or scared, I still say this.

703
00:49:46,734 --> 00:49:47,818
"Mom!"

704
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,363
How funny is that?

705
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,408
Because I don't have a mom.

706
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,704
What kind of mother wants
her daughter to be gone?

707
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:01,165
Right?

708
00:50:05,878 --> 00:50:07,004
<i>Mom!</i>

709
00:50:18,474 --> 00:50:21,810
See? It's not supposed to get ripped
in this situation.

710
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,271
As soon as I get back,

711
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:25,981
I will fail this product.

712
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:28,359
You guys are so dead.

713
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:51,215
I crossed the fence,

714
00:50:51,966 --> 00:50:53,717
but why is there no one here?

715
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:55,552
What's going on?

716
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:59,765
Are all the soldiers on leave or what?

717
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,939
-It's all because of me--
-That's not true.

718
00:51:07,106 --> 00:51:08,107
It's because of me.

719
00:51:08,607 --> 00:51:09,942
Hey.

720
00:51:10,526 --> 00:51:12,903
What's the point in finding whom to blame?

721
00:51:12,987 --> 00:51:15,864
If you put it that way,
Captain Ri is the first one to lose her

722
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,366
because he stepped on a mine,

723
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:19,493
so he has the responsibility too.

724
00:51:21,870 --> 00:51:24,915
I mean, Captain Ri would never have

725
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:27,751
intended to step on it either.

726
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:31,130
Everyone knows
that place is full of lost mines.

727
00:51:31,213 --> 00:51:33,340
Even raw recruits know that.

728
00:51:33,424 --> 00:51:36,051
I'm sure he was being careful enough.
Still, he stepped on it.

729
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:37,803
What can we do about that?

730
00:51:39,680 --> 00:51:41,640
Master Sergeant Pyo, did you drink?

731
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,101
What?

732
00:51:45,477 --> 00:51:49,356
Well, I didn't drink alcohol.

733
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:51,066
I just had a glass of medicine.

734
00:51:53,986 --> 00:51:54,987
Again,

735
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,282
there's no point in finding whom to blame.

736
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:00,784
We must hurry and find that woman.

737
00:52:00,868 --> 00:52:03,412
If that woman gets caught
by the State Security Department,

738
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:06,832
we will all be dead meat.

739
00:52:06,915 --> 00:52:07,750
"Dead meat"?

740
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,463
We will walk into a prison

741
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,006
and come out dead.

742
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:15,758
Prison?

743
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,634
A dishonorable discharge

744
00:52:17,718 --> 00:52:19,386
at best.

745
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:22,264
Mother.

746
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,653
It's time for the company switch.

747
00:52:36,987 --> 00:52:38,155
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

748
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,448
Attention.

749
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:43,369
MY PROUD HOMELAND

750
00:52:43,452 --> 00:52:46,914
Company Five has completed
transferring the task at the guard post.

751
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,540
Captain of Company Five, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

752
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:05,391
How did that unpowered aircraft reach

753
00:53:05,474 --> 00:53:07,184
our land?

754
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:09,228
It's precisely because it's unpowered.

755
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,980
Had it been powered,
the radar would have caught it

756
00:53:12,106 --> 00:53:13,690
no matter the wind.

757
00:53:13,774 --> 00:53:16,068
The thermographic camera can't catch
unpowered aircraft,

758
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,445
so you miss it
if you don't spot it with your eyes.

759
00:53:21,073 --> 00:53:23,200
If wind carried her over the border,

760
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:27,454
-that woman must be panicking.
-Hey!

761
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:31,166
I am panicking, too!

762
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,919
We will catch her
before the words get out, right?

763
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:35,504
We must catch her

764
00:53:36,088 --> 00:53:37,297
no matter what.

765
00:53:56,692 --> 00:53:58,652
Why does it feel like I was here before?

766
00:54:00,821 --> 00:54:02,698
I shouldn't wander any longer.

767
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,911
I won't come back here.

768
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,748
Let's not meet again.

769
00:54:11,915 --> 00:54:13,000
Bye.

770
00:54:43,572 --> 00:54:44,781
How is the search going?

771
00:54:45,365 --> 00:54:48,285
You saw how widespread the search is.

772
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,287
That's your problem.

773
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,664
I am not talking about the search
for Yoon Se-ri.

774
00:54:53,582 --> 00:54:56,126
Yoon Se-ri isn't the one
you should be looking for.

775
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:58,170
What are you talking about?

776
00:54:58,253 --> 00:55:01,215
Stop quizzing me and say what you want.

777
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:03,634
The position

778
00:55:04,259 --> 00:55:05,552
is open.

779
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:07,763
It's open right now.

780
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:09,681
Will you miss your chance again?

781
00:55:11,683 --> 00:55:13,519
This is the last chance.

782
00:55:13,602 --> 00:55:15,437
If you don't want to lose it forever,

783
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,022
find him right away.

784
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:21,527
The man who ran away with your money,
Gu Seung-jun.

785
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:28,700
SHENYANG, CHINA

786
00:55:45,676 --> 00:55:48,011
Guard the door.

787
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,805
Let me know if you see someone suspicious.

788
00:55:49,888 --> 00:55:51,139
Yes, sir.

789
00:55:57,229 --> 00:55:59,189
Is he trustworthy?

790
00:55:59,273 --> 00:56:00,983
My goodness.

791
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:04,361
You know how carefully I choose my people.

792
00:56:04,444 --> 00:56:05,904
He is trustworthy.

793
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,781
How about you, Mr. Oh?

794
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:08,907
Are you trustworthy?

795
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:14,246
You should know that I am trustworthy
at this point.

796
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,666
That was exactly what I said
before I backstabbed Yoon Se-hyeong.

797
00:56:17,958 --> 00:56:19,459
You have a point.

798
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,963
You are incredible.

799
00:56:23,547 --> 00:56:26,466
Mr. Yoon must be in a lot of trouble.

800
00:56:27,968 --> 00:56:30,637
He isn't the type to give up so easily.

801
00:56:30,721 --> 00:56:33,265
He must have followed my trail
to the Philippines by now.

802
00:56:33,348 --> 00:56:35,475
To follow my trail here,

803
00:56:36,018 --> 00:56:38,478
it would take four days tops.
Where should I go from here?

804
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:41,607
That's right.
With enough money and manpower,

805
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:44,985
you could chase someone to anywhere
in the world.

806
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,614
One place is an exception.

807
00:56:49,114 --> 00:56:50,282
Internet,

808
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,036
Interpol, and phone roaming

809
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:56,121
are all useless at that place.

810
00:56:56,204 --> 00:56:57,497
So where is that place?

811
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:59,833
Hurry up and tell me, would you?

812
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:01,960
INVESTIGATION OFFICE
OF THE CIVILIAN POLICE BATTALION

813
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,424
Sir.

814
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:08,759
Sit down.

815
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,260
Relax and eat.

816
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:29,905
We were quite successful this time.

817
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:32,574
We have some Goryeo celadon pottery
and a gold Buddha statue.

818
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,743
The Buddha statue is
in the best condition.

819
00:57:34,826 --> 00:57:36,495
There is a gold chamber pot too.

820
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:39,790
Good work.

821
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:46,088
Where are the goods?

822
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,177
Are you certain?

823
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:53,428
Of course.

824
00:57:54,763 --> 00:57:57,599
By the way, what will become of us?

825
00:57:58,183 --> 00:58:00,727
Things got out of hand
because of that damned captain.

826
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:04,147
We won't be deported
to Pyongyang, will we?

827
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:08,318
Ri Jeong Hyeok is no match of mine.

828
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,696
Prepare to receive your rewards.

829
00:58:10,779 --> 00:58:12,239
Thank you.

830
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,157
Your food will go cold.

831
00:58:14,908 --> 00:58:15,951
Eat.

832
00:58:45,397 --> 00:58:46,982
I NEED A RIDE

833
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:17,888
What? Open the door!

834
00:59:17,971 --> 00:59:19,389
Open the door!

835
00:59:19,473 --> 00:59:20,557
Open the door!

836
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:28,065
There are people inside.

837
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:31,985
My goodness.

838
01:00:04,351 --> 01:00:06,311
Captain.

839
01:00:06,603 --> 01:00:09,189
That woman wouldn't have made it
out of here safely.

840
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:11,608
She could have gotten eaten by a boar.

841
01:00:12,109 --> 01:00:16,905
There would be no need to notify
the State Security Department.

842
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:18,782
What do you mean?

843
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:20,867
Geum Eun Dong is

844
01:00:21,451 --> 01:00:25,163
the head of a big family which comprises
of a single mother and four siblings.

845
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:27,374
Eun Dong's mother is waiting

846
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:30,502
for her son to return as a hero.

847
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,843
It's the same for every parent.

848
01:00:40,303 --> 01:00:43,807
Since Kim Ju Meok watched
a South Korean drama during work hours,

849
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,767
he might not be able to make it to...

850
01:00:46,101 --> 01:00:48,520
His father might beat him to death first.

851
01:00:52,399 --> 01:00:54,693
If you commit a crime,
it's natural to receive a punishment.

852
01:00:55,902 --> 01:00:58,405
It applies to Geum Eun Dong
and Kim Ju Meok who left their posts

853
01:00:58,488 --> 01:01:01,032
as well as me
who failed to capture that woman

854
01:01:02,075 --> 01:01:04,202
and you

855
01:01:04,911 --> 01:01:06,955
who drank during work.

856
01:01:08,331 --> 01:01:09,499
Captain.

857
01:01:16,798 --> 01:01:17,841
Here.

858
01:02:14,189 --> 01:02:15,357
Thank goodness.

859
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:19,569
I am home.

860
01:02:22,781 --> 01:02:25,033
I nearly ended up going to North Korea.

861
01:02:27,118 --> 01:02:28,536
What happened today

862
01:02:29,037 --> 01:02:31,206
deserves an interview with CNN.

863
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,590
I will go to the town,

864
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:43,051
borrow a phone,

865
01:02:43,218 --> 01:02:45,887
and call a taxi so that I can go home.

866
01:02:45,971 --> 01:02:49,015
I will have Dr. Im come over and receive
physical therapy.

867
01:02:50,100 --> 01:02:51,184
I am almost home.

868
01:02:52,185 --> 01:02:53,645
I am almost home.

869
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:05,448
Why is this place so dark?

870
01:03:06,157 --> 01:03:07,701
Is everyone asleep?

871
01:03:16,584 --> 01:03:19,337
Excuse me. May I borrow your cellphone?

872
01:03:25,427 --> 01:03:28,013
What? Let's go.

873
01:03:28,263 --> 01:03:29,347
Let's go.

874
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,268
Come on. Let's go.

875
01:03:42,402 --> 01:03:45,613
Comrade, your briquette didn't go out
during the night, did it?

876
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,158
No, it didn't.

877
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,827
Comrade, have you been well
throughout the night?

878
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,662
Did you sleep well?

879
01:03:53,079 --> 01:03:54,080
Yes.

880
01:03:58,418 --> 01:04:00,712
Oh, we have electricity now.

881
01:04:00,837 --> 01:04:04,257
We are only getting it
when the sun is about to go up.

882
01:04:04,841 --> 01:04:07,719
But it's nice to have electricity
before we start to cook breakfast.

883
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:09,679
That's true.

884
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,766
Why did you come ten minutes late today?

885
01:04:12,849 --> 01:04:14,726
It wasn't intentional, okay?

886
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,311
Give me food waste.

887
01:04:16,394 --> 01:04:18,396
Here you go. Give me chicken egg tickets.

888
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,523
Here are ten chicken egg tickets.

889
01:04:20,732 --> 01:04:23,318
Hurry up and give me the eggs.

890
01:04:23,401 --> 01:04:24,569
You collected a lot.

891
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:26,488
You are so diligent.

892
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:27,822
Those people...

893
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:29,866
What are they doing?

894
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:31,701
They are still warm.

895
01:04:32,035 --> 01:04:33,286
You are right.

896
01:04:33,370 --> 01:04:34,954
-<i>All right, everyone.</i>
-Mom!

897
01:04:35,038 --> 01:04:36,956
-Here it is.
<i>-Let's get started</i>

898
01:04:37,082 --> 01:04:40,460
<i>with the daily exercise routine.</i>

899
01:04:41,002 --> 01:04:43,338
-Let's go.
-<i>Come on out.</i>

900
01:04:43,421 --> 01:04:44,672
Let's hurry up.

901
01:05:02,607 --> 01:05:06,569
THE GREAT LEADER IS ALWAYS WITH US

902
01:05:29,426 --> 01:05:31,636
-Comrade Rim Jin Ju.
-Here.

903
01:05:32,011 --> 01:05:33,763
-Comrade Jeong Woo Pil.
-Here.

904
01:05:34,681 --> 01:05:37,308
-Comrade Park Eun Byeol.
-What are they doing?

905
01:05:37,767 --> 01:05:39,352
Comrade Park Eun Byeol isn't here yet.

906
01:05:39,436 --> 01:05:41,146
-She is always late!
-What's with the accent?

907
01:05:41,312 --> 01:05:43,189
We will be late for school
if we wait for her.

908
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:44,649
Let's go without her.

909
01:05:44,732 --> 01:05:45,692
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

910
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:46,943
Forward march!

911
01:05:47,527 --> 01:05:49,487
<i>-Where are we?
-Where are we?</i>

912
01:05:49,571 --> 01:05:51,531
<i>-We reached the town
-We reached the town</i>

913
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:53,158
<i>-Where are we going?
-Where are we going?</i>

914
01:05:53,241 --> 01:05:54,951
<i>-Going to school
-Going to school</i>

915
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:56,953
<i>-Why are we going?
-Why are we going?</i>

916
01:05:57,078 --> 01:05:58,621
<i>-Going to study
-Going to study</i>

917
01:05:58,705 --> 01:06:00,623
<i>-Going with whom?
-Going with whom?</i>

918
01:06:00,707 --> 01:06:02,417
<i>-We are going together
-We are going together</i>

919
01:06:02,500 --> 01:06:05,128
PARADISE OF PEOPLE

920
01:06:05,211 --> 01:06:08,590
THE GREAT LEADER IS ALWAYS WITH US

921
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:15,889
<i>-We reached the town
-We reached the town</i>

922
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:17,932
<i>-Where are we going?
-Where are we going?</i>

923
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,434
<i>-Going to school
-Going to school</i>

924
01:06:19,517 --> 01:06:21,394
<i>-Why are we going?
-Why are we going?</i>

925
01:06:21,478 --> 01:06:23,188
<i>-Going to study
-Going to study</i>

926
01:06:23,271 --> 01:06:25,148
<i>-Going with whom?
-Going with whom?</i>

927
01:06:25,315 --> 01:06:26,441
What?

928
01:06:29,652 --> 01:06:31,613
Am I still in North Korea?

929
01:08:01,911 --> 01:08:02,996
Mr. Hong.

930
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,666
<i>Hello. Hello.</i>

931
01:08:07,834 --> 01:08:09,002
Mr. Hong.

932
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:12,130
You can hear me, right?
I know you can hear me.

933
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:14,048
Fire the event company.

934
01:08:14,132 --> 01:08:16,134
Did they even check the weather?

935
01:08:16,884 --> 01:08:18,595
How could they be so careless?

936
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:20,555
Once I go back, I won't let you...

937
01:08:22,515 --> 01:08:23,891
No, no.

938
01:08:24,475 --> 01:08:25,810
I will let you be.

939
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,688
I promise I will let you be.

940
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:30,982
I am not mad.

941
01:08:31,316 --> 01:08:33,735
You aren't answering
because you think I am mad, right?

942
01:08:35,069 --> 01:08:37,947
I am not mad. I am really okay.

943
01:08:38,197 --> 01:08:39,907
So please answer me.

944
01:08:41,284 --> 01:08:42,368
I think...

945
01:08:44,829 --> 01:08:46,956
I am in some kind of a national park.

946
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:49,000
I saw an elk earlier.

947
01:08:49,876 --> 01:08:52,754
See if there is a national park nearby.

948
01:08:54,213 --> 01:08:56,466
It might sound like an order,

949
01:08:56,549 --> 01:08:58,468
but it's a request.

950
01:09:02,430 --> 01:09:04,974
Come on.

951
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:08,102
Don't do this to me.

952
01:09:08,728 --> 01:09:11,272
I have so much work.

953
01:09:11,898 --> 01:09:14,108
I have a mountain of work.

954
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:17,153
For example,

955
01:09:18,571 --> 01:09:20,823
I was planning
to give the employees a raise

956
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:22,992
and a big bonus.

957
01:09:23,993 --> 01:09:25,161
Did you hear that?

958
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,496
I bet you did.

959
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:29,540
You are too embarrassed
to answer me so suddenly, right?

960
01:09:36,673 --> 01:09:38,049
Anyone,

961
01:09:39,676 --> 01:09:43,388
please come to me.

962
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:53,064
Here!

963
01:09:53,815 --> 01:09:54,899
Here!

964
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,734
Here!

965
01:09:56,938 --> 01:09:59,360
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

966
01:09:59,696 --> 01:10:02,865
-I come from a rich family in South Korea.
-I'm not interested.

967
01:10:02,949 --> 01:10:07,704
Won't all of you in huge trouble
if people find out that I'm hiding here?

968
01:10:07,787 --> 01:10:09,163
That means you'll get kicked out.

969
01:10:09,247 --> 01:10:11,082
-I heard you need this job.
-They said she died.

970
01:10:11,165 --> 01:10:13,584
<i>He's in hiding
after the one-billion-won scheme.</i>

971
01:10:13,668 --> 01:10:16,170
I guess there might be a new account.

972
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,922
<i>Why are you here?</i>

973
01:10:18,005 --> 01:10:21,384
<i>His resume doesn't have anything
about family background.</i>

974
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,678
Everything will look suspicious.

975
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:25,722
-I want to return the favor.
-You don't have to.

976
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:27,265
There was no favor to begin with.

977
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,143
