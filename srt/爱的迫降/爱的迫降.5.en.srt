1
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

2
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:58,225
-Here.
-Come here.

3
00:00:59,643 --> 00:01:03,855
-Come on.
-Try some of this.

4
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:42,436
This time,

5
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,063
it's not just a candle but a scented one.

6
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,482
Right?

7
00:01:48,609 --> 00:01:49,610
Yes.

8
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:20,641
It looks like you just got stood up.

9
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,895
Thank you for the ride.

10
00:02:25,145 --> 00:02:25,979
Bye then.

11
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:26,980
Okay.

12
00:02:27,064 --> 00:02:28,065
Take care.

13
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:29,775
I'll see you around if fate allows.

14
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,329
How could you be standing right there

15
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,456
right then

16
00:02:45,499 --> 00:02:47,501
with a candle?

17
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,045
You really made my heart flutter.

18
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:54,841
You have done it, haven't you?
I'm sure you have.

19
00:02:55,509 --> 00:02:57,010
That skill was really something.

20
00:02:58,261 --> 00:02:59,638
You know,

21
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:03,642
we call that pickup skills.

22
00:03:08,146 --> 00:03:09,022
What is it?

23
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:11,817
<i>Heart means love.</i>

24
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:13,527
<i>In South Korea,</i>

25
00:03:14,569 --> 00:03:16,363
this means that they like you.

26
00:03:17,656 --> 00:03:19,408
I doubt that's the case, but...

27
00:03:20,033 --> 00:03:20,867
What is it?

28
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:23,412
Since you said your heart fluttered...

29
00:03:29,126 --> 00:03:31,753
Just to make sure there's no confusion,

30
00:03:31,962 --> 00:03:34,965
-there's something I need to tell you.
-What's so complicated?

31
00:03:35,048 --> 00:03:37,759
-What is it? Just tell me.
-I have a woman in my life.

32
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,679
What?

33
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,056
She's my fiancée.

34
00:03:44,433 --> 00:03:45,267
Hold on.

35
00:03:47,644 --> 00:03:49,438
What did you just say?

36
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:51,940
-I have a fiancée--
-No, before that.

37
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,234
-I have a woman--
-No, even before that.

38
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,697
Just to prevent
any fluster you might go through...

39
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,948
Yes, that one.

40
00:04:00,407 --> 00:04:02,576
That sounds very offending.

41
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:04,494
Flustered? Who?

42
00:04:04,745 --> 00:04:05,871
Me? Why?

43
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,789
I'm not confused at all.

44
00:04:07,873 --> 00:04:09,708
There seems to be a misunderstanding here.

45
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,043
Whether you have a woman or not,

46
00:04:13,462 --> 00:04:17,340
I don't care at all.
Do you understand? I have a man too.

47
00:04:17,424 --> 00:04:19,301
I have many men in Seoul.

48
00:04:20,469 --> 00:04:22,387
-Many?
-Yes.

49
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:25,056
I'm sure they are
all crying their eyes out now.

50
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,975
Which is why I need to hurry back.

51
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,060
Are you saying you're going back for men?

52
00:04:29,728 --> 00:04:31,688
Partly because of men.

53
00:04:32,314 --> 00:04:33,940
I have to go back anyway.

54
00:04:34,858 --> 00:04:36,610
It's not like I will live here.

55
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:38,612
That's not what I meant to say.

56
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,739
Even if you tell me to stay, I won't.

57
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,617
Anyway, this is really offending.

58
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,495
You just drew the line, Mr. Ri.

59
00:04:46,745 --> 00:04:48,246
Because you don't want me to cross it.

60
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:52,250
That's a nice way to put it.

61
00:04:54,377 --> 00:04:57,631
Don't worry.
I'm very good at not crossing lines.

62
00:04:57,714 --> 00:05:00,217
I have never even been fined
while driving.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:01,426
I never cross lines.

64
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,512
I keep my eyes to the front
and never look sideways.

65
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:07,599
Don't you have to look sideways a little
when you drive?

66
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:11,061
Is that important now?
Don't you get the point?

67
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:21,363
Are you an actor?
How are you so good at our dialect?

68
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:23,156
There's nothing a con man can't do.

69
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:25,075
I can even speak Jeju dialect.

70
00:05:38,296 --> 00:05:40,048
-Could you stop the car for a while?
-Pardon?

71
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:41,675
Stop the car!

72
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:50,016
-What's the matter?
-I thought I saw someone I knew.

73
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,310
I don't think you know anyone here.

74
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,563
-I guess you're right.
-Hurry up and get in.

75
00:05:56,273 --> 00:05:57,691
She looked just like her.

76
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:03,405
Excuse me.

77
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:05,824
What brings you here?

78
00:06:07,576 --> 00:06:08,994
Who are you looking for?

79
00:06:09,536 --> 00:06:11,288
I'm here to see Ri Jeong Hyeok.

80
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:13,164
At this time?

81
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:15,959
How do you know Jeong Hyeok?

82
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,003
Why do I have to answer that?

83
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:24,259
I'm the head of this village.

84
00:06:24,843 --> 00:06:26,845
Let me see your pass.

85
00:06:32,142 --> 00:06:33,351
SEO DAN

86
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:41,902
So you still don't want to tell us
what your relationship with him is?

87
00:06:41,985 --> 00:06:43,278
I'm his fiancée.

88
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:47,949
What did you just say?

89
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:50,368
I'm Ri Jeong Hyeok's fiancée.

90
00:06:52,537 --> 00:06:53,496
But...

91
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,750
Let's go.

92
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,050
I can't believe you were two-timing.
You didn't look like you would.

93
00:07:06,927 --> 00:07:07,928
Two-timing?

94
00:07:08,219 --> 00:07:09,596
I don't think that's true.

95
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,723
Of course it is true.
You have two fiancées.

96
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:13,725
This would make a headline.

97
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:15,769
You're not my fiancée.

98
00:07:16,227 --> 00:07:17,812
You said I was your fiancée.

99
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:19,439
I didn't say it. You said it first.

100
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:20,857
Because I thought you'd be gone--

101
00:07:20,941 --> 00:07:23,526
Well, I couldn't. Okay? I couldn't.

102
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,903
Why do you keep saying that?

103
00:07:25,779 --> 00:07:28,323
And what if this troubles us later?

104
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,075
Then we will all be screwed.

105
00:07:30,659 --> 00:07:32,452
-That won't happen.
-How do you know?

106
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:34,204
What if she comes here?

107
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,830
Can't you do calculations?

108
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:37,791
She's studying in Russia now.

109
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,543
Which means she won't be here for a while.

110
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,213
Do you think
I haven't thought that through?

111
00:07:43,296 --> 00:07:44,714
I'm not stupid.

112
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:24,629
The trouble happened, right?

113
00:08:28,133 --> 00:08:31,511
So you were stupid, Mr. Ri.
What are you going to do now?

114
00:08:41,146 --> 00:08:42,272
It's been a while.

115
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,357
When did you come from Russia?

116
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,942
It's been a few days.

117
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:48,028
I'm sorry I haven't given you a heads-up.

118
00:08:48,611 --> 00:08:51,781
I heard my uncle lent you a car.
I came to pick it up.

119
00:08:53,283 --> 00:08:55,660
I was going to bring it back this weekend.

120
00:08:55,744 --> 00:08:56,661
I see.

121
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:03,626
-This woman is--
-My mom wonders how you're doing.

122
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,462
Come visit Pyongyang one of those days.

123
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,422
Let's have dinner with our parents.

124
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:11,468
Give me the car key. I'll get going.

125
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:14,679
It's dangerous to drive alone
at this hour.

126
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:17,474
The roads here are rough unlike
in Pyongyang.

127
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,392
Then what should I do?

128
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:21,603
Let me ride you home.

129
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,272
Thank you.

130
00:09:25,023 --> 00:09:28,860
And this woman is carrying out
a mission with me.

131
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:30,487
She's my colleague.

132
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:34,657
Is that so?

133
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:38,078
Yes, I guess it is.

134
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:40,497
What happens when you achieve your goal?

135
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,332
Will you be still seeing each other then?

136
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,875
We won't see each other again then.

137
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:50,131
He's right.

138
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,467
Our relationship is

139
00:09:53,218 --> 00:09:55,428
sort of a strategic alliance.

140
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:58,807
So once we complete the mission,
we won't see each other.

141
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,350
Never in our lives, ever.

142
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:02,852
So please don't misunderstand.

143
00:10:02,936 --> 00:10:04,479
And my accent is a bit weird, right?

144
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,731
I belong to Division 11.

145
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,277
There's a special and sad story
behind this. That's all I can say.

146
00:10:12,362 --> 00:10:13,613
I don't care.

147
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:19,369
At least there's no misunderstanding then.
I'm glad.

148
00:10:27,710 --> 00:10:30,213
I guess I should go home now.

149
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,632
Give a safe ride to your fiancée.

150
00:10:34,926 --> 00:10:35,885
What is it?

151
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,394
It's not like your home is elsewhere.

152
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:48,231
It's dark outside,
so lock the door and stay inside.

153
00:10:49,983 --> 00:10:51,401
I'll be right back.

154
00:10:58,408 --> 00:10:59,701
Let's go.

155
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,914
Do you know how many times we have met?

156
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,794
This is the seventh time.

157
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,797
We met together
with our parents four times,

158
00:11:56,007 --> 00:11:58,426
and the fifth time we met, we got engaged.

159
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:00,470
And that's seven years ago.

160
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:02,722
Has it been that long already?

161
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:05,099
Marriage comes after engagement.

162
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:07,644
That's the right order.

163
00:12:08,645 --> 00:12:11,064
But don't you feel like
there's something missing?

164
00:12:14,442 --> 00:12:15,568
Love

165
00:12:16,486 --> 00:12:17,779
is missing.

166
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,241
We should love too.

167
00:12:22,242 --> 00:12:23,451
We're going to get married.

168
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:26,913
I will do everything in order.

169
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,332
Please cooperate.

170
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,251
I will try.

171
00:12:35,255 --> 00:12:36,297
Right.

172
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:39,467
I'll call my mother
and tell her we're coming together.

173
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,722
<i>At nine in the morning...</i>

174
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,062
What do you think?

175
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:52,772
Well...

176
00:12:56,693 --> 00:12:57,694
Goodness.

177
00:12:57,777 --> 00:13:00,697
-Does it stand out too much?
-Well, yes.

178
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,244
-What about this?
-You're not the one getting married.

179
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,663
Show some interest, will you?

180
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,165
I'm meeting my son-in-law
finally after years.

181
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:13,960
Technically, he's not your son-in-law yet.

182
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:18,673
Just being polite should be enough.

183
00:13:18,756 --> 00:13:20,049
"Polite"?

184
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,727
Tie up your hair at least.

185
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,521
He might think you're a ghost
and pass out.

186
00:13:34,022 --> 00:13:37,608
Shut up and go wait outside.

187
00:13:37,692 --> 00:13:38,860
Why?

188
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:42,572
What if Jeong Hyeok leaves
right after he takes the car back?

189
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,867
Make sure you bring him here
to our house, okay?

190
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,385
Jeong Hyeok!

191
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:09,098
Since you came all the way here,
at least say hello to our family.

192
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,487
Welcome.

193
00:14:28,743 --> 00:14:30,036
MAKE PYONGYANG THE MODEL CITY

194
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,329
Comrade Operator.

195
00:14:31,412 --> 00:14:32,622
I appreciate your work.

196
00:14:33,164 --> 00:14:34,957
We are going to the 13th floor.

197
00:14:36,751 --> 00:14:39,003
You're headed to
the department store owner's place.

198
00:14:39,629 --> 00:14:42,423
Are you going to stay overnight?
Then I need to make a report.

199
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,592
No, I'm just dropping by.

200
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,770
You haven't met for years. I'm sure
you're glad to see each other again.

201
00:14:56,354 --> 00:15:00,525
No wonder why Jeong Hyeok drove you
all the way here.

202
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:03,319
Dan, Jeong Hyeok may look cold,

203
00:15:03,861 --> 00:15:06,614
but he's sincerer than any other man.

204
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,907
He's different from other men.

205
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:11,119
You haven't met for over seven years.
Other men would have cheated already,

206
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:12,578
two-timing, three-timing.

207
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:16,374
Some assholes would have even taken
a woman home and lived with her.

208
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,917
-Uncle.
-What is it?

209
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,669
-Let's be quiet.
-Okay.

210
00:15:29,095 --> 00:15:31,889
Myeong Eun, you're only wearing socks.

211
00:15:31,973 --> 00:15:33,641
Hey, you came.

212
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,893
It's been a while.
I'm sorry for coming this late.

213
00:15:35,977 --> 00:15:38,729
Don't say that. It's not late at all.

214
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,481
What's late is your marriage.

215
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,735
-Come on in and have dinner with us.
-I'm good, thanks.

216
00:15:44,819 --> 00:15:45,903
I already prepared it.

217
00:15:47,029 --> 00:15:48,197
I already made dinner.

218
00:15:49,115 --> 00:15:51,200
We usually have dinner at this hour.

219
00:15:51,284 --> 00:15:52,702
It's okay. Come on in.

220
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,164
-But I had dinner already.
-Haven't you gone home yet?

221
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,292
-Come on. This way.
-Thanks.

222
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:11,846
This is how we would normally eat.

223
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,347
Thank you.

224
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,850
Make yourself comfortable
and help yourself.

225
00:16:16,434 --> 00:16:18,186
-Thanks.
-Eat up.

226
00:16:21,022 --> 00:16:25,776
All the matchmakers somehow figured out
that Dan came back from Russia

227
00:16:26,486 --> 00:16:28,863
and begged me that
they would like to see her just once.

228
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:32,992
I told her she's already engaged,
but they were so persistent.

229
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,245
They're really bugging me these days.
I'm very tired.

230
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:37,955
Persistent? Who is?

231
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:45,213
I mean, I just have never
heard about this.

232
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:49,342
Open your mouth.

233
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:53,387
Chew on this and keep your mouth shut.

234
00:16:57,642 --> 00:17:00,311
Eat up. It's well-grilled.

235
00:17:13,157 --> 00:17:14,700
Could it be her doppelgänger?

236
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:16,452
She looked just like her.

237
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:34,053
-Are you finished already?
-Didn't my brother say

238
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:37,265
that my nickname was Picky Princess?

239
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:42,061
Unless the food is really good,
I can't have more than three bites.

240
00:17:44,855 --> 00:17:46,190
The chef here is pretty good too,

241
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,234
but I'll take you
to a better place next time.

242
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:52,572
You don't have to.
There won't be next time.

243
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:56,534
Your brother didn't tell me this,

244
00:17:57,118 --> 00:17:59,954
so I didn't know you'd be this pretty.
I wish there is next time.

245
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:02,456
I heard
you had a perfect academic background

246
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,917
and had a good eye for your age.

247
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,004
I heard you make clever investments.

248
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:13,634
My second brother seemed
to have fallen in love with you.

249
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:16,220
-You're flattering me.
-But Mr. Gu,

250
00:18:17,013 --> 00:18:18,389
I won't fall for you.

251
00:18:19,348 --> 00:18:20,808
I can see everything.

252
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,977
You're just laying the groundwork now

253
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:25,021
for a bigger purpose.

254
00:18:25,104 --> 00:18:28,399
It looks like you want to marry me
so you can have it all.

255
00:18:29,859 --> 00:18:31,193
And I don't think it will happen.

256
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:34,864
I grew up in a tough family,

257
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:36,699
so I have very sharp eyes.

258
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:40,161
Take some pocket money
from my brother and wrap it up.

259
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,626
Even the wine is lame.

260
00:18:50,254 --> 00:18:52,798
She was the smartest one in the family.

261
00:18:55,301 --> 00:18:56,302
I wonder how she's doing.

262
00:19:16,197 --> 00:19:18,240
What am I doing now?

263
00:19:18,741 --> 00:19:20,159
This looks like

264
00:19:21,077 --> 00:19:24,455
I'm so eagerly waiting
for him to come back.

265
00:19:24,872 --> 00:19:26,207
Gosh.

266
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:27,750
I'm so embarrassed.

267
00:19:28,751 --> 00:19:29,710
How funny.

268
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:33,255
How funny it is.

269
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:47,353
What brings you here?

270
00:19:48,104 --> 00:19:49,480
We saw everything earlier.

271
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:51,857
What do you mean?

272
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:53,651
You must be heartbroken.

273
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:56,737
No, I'm not.

274
00:19:56,821 --> 00:19:59,907
I have seen many monsters,

275
00:20:00,658 --> 00:20:03,744
but I had no idea
Jeong Hyeok would do that.

276
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:06,080
I'm so sorry.

277
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:09,500
Let's not do this here. Let's talk inside.

278
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,876
We need DP and beer now.

279
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,461
-She's right.
-She's right.

280
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,587
-Let's go.
-Let's get in.

281
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,590
But...

282
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:18,050
Wait.

283
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:21,220
What's DP and beer?
Is it something like chicken and beer?

284
00:20:21,804 --> 00:20:24,181
You don't know what DP and beer is?

285
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:27,852
Dried pollack and beer.
They're a perfect match.

286
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,729
Once you try it, you'll dream about it.

287
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:32,648
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

288
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,650
Excuse me,

289
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:37,653
but why are you doing this here
in the middle of the   night?

290
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,989
Now, let's drink up.

291
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,157
-Let's drink up.
-Cheers.

292
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,199
Drink up.

293
00:20:56,046 --> 00:20:58,215
We have been saying

294
00:20:58,424 --> 00:21:01,510
that Sam Suk has got no morals.

295
00:21:01,594 --> 00:21:03,387
-We have indeed.
-But

296
00:21:03,471 --> 00:21:07,141
the woman we met today
truly didn't have any morals.

297
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:11,020
Sam Suk, you were nothing compared to her.

298
00:21:11,604 --> 00:21:15,399
When you said she had no morals,
does that mean she was being a bitch?

299
00:21:15,483 --> 00:21:16,776
Bitch?

300
00:21:17,526 --> 00:21:20,196
I'm not sure what that means,
but I like how it sounds.

301
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:21,781
Is that how you guys swear?

302
00:21:22,531 --> 00:21:24,825
Yes, its synonyms

303
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,078
are bitch-ass, ass-hat,

304
00:21:28,162 --> 00:21:30,873
and gigabytch, and so on.

305
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,251
-"Gigabytch"?
-"Ass-hat"?

306
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:36,754
They have many swear words
in the South too.

307
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:38,547
I guess they do.

308
00:21:39,173 --> 00:21:41,050
That bitch said this.

309
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,304
"I'm Jeong Hyeok's fiancée."

310
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,351
And what really upset me was

311
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:54,355
that our Jeong Hyeok
put that woman in the car

312
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,316
and left like that.

313
00:21:57,399 --> 00:21:59,735
-Oh, my.
-That's horrible.

314
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:02,363
Then Sam Suk,

315
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,906
have you been dumped by him?

316
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,283
She's dumped real hard.

317
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,744
-Oh, my.
-Poor her.

318
00:22:09,286 --> 00:22:10,496
I'm so sorry.

319
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,917
I appreciate your concerns,

320
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,503
but we will take care of our own business.

321
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,213
We can't let you do that.

322
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:22,299
-Excuse me?
-As you all probably know,

323
00:22:22,716 --> 00:22:26,220
I have always thought
Jeong Hyeok was a good man.

324
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:28,347
However, by any chance,

325
00:22:28,848 --> 00:22:31,976
if he got engaged to someone else
when he was already engaged,

326
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:36,397
you ought to break his neck.

327
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,481
What?

328
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:39,733
Break what?

329
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:40,985
And not just neck.

330
00:22:41,068 --> 00:22:42,945
I can break anything
to teach him a lesson.

331
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:43,904
Well said.

332
00:22:43,988 --> 00:22:46,115
-I agree.
-We must teach him a lesson.

333
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:48,450
We should do something about him
for our village's sake.

334
00:22:48,534 --> 00:22:49,827
-I agree.
-Right?

335
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:50,953
Well, you see...

336
00:22:51,745 --> 00:22:54,415
I'm the one who got dumped.
Everyone, please calm down.

337
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,583
No, we can't.

338
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:57,751
We can't calm down.
This is a serious matter.

339
00:22:57,835 --> 00:22:59,378
-She's right.
-This is truly serious.

340
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,464
-We must do something about that asshole.
-We can't just sit back.

341
00:23:02,548 --> 00:23:04,842
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

342
00:23:05,843 --> 00:23:08,888
This is why they say
one-time fans are scarier than anti-fans.

343
00:23:08,971 --> 00:23:12,099
What did you just say?
One-time fans? What does that mean?

344
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,476
Never mind. Let's have DP and beer.

345
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:16,478
DP and beer. Let's drink.

346
00:23:16,562 --> 00:23:18,063
Come on. Let's drink.

347
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,824
Gosh, I guess we can never
judge a book by its cover.

348
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:30,951
Pardon?

349
00:23:31,744 --> 00:23:34,121
<i>I will tell Senior Colonel</i>

350
00:23:34,204 --> 00:23:36,248
that Jeong Hyeok must get

351
00:23:36,707 --> 00:23:39,251
a big disadvantage in the army.

352
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:41,545
What?

353
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,839
How can such an immoral person

354
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:45,925
lead a company?

355
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,302
-She has her point.
-That's true.

356
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,012
-She's right.
-I agree.

357
00:23:50,304 --> 00:23:51,180
Truth to be told,

358
00:23:52,973 --> 00:23:55,309
both Mr. Ri's parents

359
00:23:55,893 --> 00:23:59,772
and the parents of the woman you saw
want them to be together.

360
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:01,815
It's a sort of marriage of convenience.

361
00:24:01,899 --> 00:24:03,943
Then what about you, Sam Suk?

362
00:24:05,194 --> 00:24:06,195
I'm...

363
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,324
Do you know <i>Romeo and Juliet?</i>

364
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,951
-Juliet?
-What is that?

365
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,452
-I don't know.
-What's that?

366
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:14,703
-Do you know it?
-No.

367
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,288
Are they Americans?

368
00:24:16,372 --> 00:24:17,831
-I don't know.
-Me neither.

369
00:24:17,915 --> 00:24:19,416
What about <i>Gyeonu and Jiknyeo?</i>

370
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,418
-We know <i>Gyeonu and Jiknyeo.</i>
-July 7.

371
00:24:21,502 --> 00:24:22,544
-We know that.
-Very well.

372
00:24:22,628 --> 00:24:24,797
-Of course we know it.
-It's a beautiful story.

373
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,006
I'm like <i>Jiknyeo.</i>

374
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:29,301
Oh, my.

375
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:32,930
I love him so much,
but there's a wall of reality blocking us.

376
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:37,810
Then are you saying

377
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:40,604
their parents' opposition

378
00:24:40,688 --> 00:24:43,607
is hindering your love?

379
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,610
You recapped it very well.
That's exactly the situation.

380
00:24:47,277 --> 00:24:50,114
-Oh, my.
-He's such a good son.

381
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,950
He doesn't want to do anything
that's against his parents' will,

382
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:55,119
and I can understand that.

383
00:24:55,202 --> 00:24:58,330
So I want you to understand that too.

384
00:25:04,461 --> 00:25:06,130
Look at you trying to protect

385
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:08,757
the man who left with another woman
to Pyongyang. You're so nice.

386
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:13,012
Sam Suk, you're a great person.

387
00:25:13,595 --> 00:25:14,847
-You're flattering me.
-My gosh.

388
00:25:14,972 --> 00:25:17,307
Why don't we all just drink it off?

389
00:25:17,391 --> 00:25:19,101
-Okay.
-That sounds good.

390
00:25:19,184 --> 00:25:20,477
-Let's drink.
-Cheers.

391
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,187
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

392
00:25:22,271 --> 00:25:24,481
-That was a misunderstanding.
-I'm relieved now.

393
00:25:24,565 --> 00:25:26,567
-I didn't know she was so kind.
-Tell me about it.

394
00:25:27,151 --> 00:25:29,695
-Are you going to the station now?
-I need to go somewhere.

395
00:25:29,778 --> 00:25:31,613
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

396
00:25:31,697 --> 00:25:34,116
I'm good, thanks. I can take a taxi.

397
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:36,452
Okay, then.

398
00:25:44,293 --> 00:25:45,294
Bye.

399
00:25:46,170 --> 00:25:47,337
It's cold.

400
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,593
SEOJAEGOL, BOTONGGAK ZONE, PYEONGYANG

401
00:25:55,721 --> 00:25:57,765
What's the tiny car doing here
at this hour?

402
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,100
What's your business?

403
00:26:37,763 --> 00:26:40,140
Jeong Hyeok. You didn't say you'd come.

404
00:26:40,224 --> 00:26:41,767
Have you eaten yet?

405
00:26:41,850 --> 00:26:44,478
Yes. What's with the ostrich, by the way?

406
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:49,566
People raise ostriches these days
instead of guard dogs. It's the trend.

407
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,902
They sound louder than most dogs.

408
00:26:52,694 --> 00:26:54,822
I see. Where's Father?

409
00:26:54,905 --> 00:26:57,032
He's inside. Let's go.

410
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:05,749
Dan also visited two days ago.

411
00:27:05,833 --> 00:27:07,376
She looked even more beautiful.

412
00:27:08,502 --> 00:27:09,837
Let's have the wedding

413
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,338
within this year.

414
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:14,383
Within this year? Isn't it too soon?

415
00:27:15,384 --> 00:27:17,761
They've been engaged for seven years.
How is that soon?

416
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:20,180
But Dan has just come back

417
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,850
and Jeong Hyeok works at the outpost line.

418
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,518
It's not like he works in Pyongyang.

419
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,604
This is not a good time to rush.

420
00:27:28,230 --> 00:27:30,065
I will do as he wishes.

421
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:34,194
Can I ask you a big favor instead?

422
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,822
Stop holding my arm.

423
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:38,782
-Walk straight.
-Let go of me.

424
00:27:38,866 --> 00:27:39,700
Goodness.

425
00:27:39,783 --> 00:27:40,993
Sam Suk,

426
00:27:41,618 --> 00:27:44,705
if you need any help
with your relationship with Jeong Hyeok,

427
00:27:44,788 --> 00:27:47,541
call me anytime. I'd be happy to help.

428
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:50,252
-Help?
-Yes.

429
00:27:51,879 --> 00:27:54,339
-Actually...
-Go ahead and tell me.

430
00:27:54,423 --> 00:27:58,677
If Captain Ri gets promotions

431
00:27:59,261 --> 00:28:01,430
and becomes successful,

432
00:28:01,513 --> 00:28:04,183
his parents might become more generous.

433
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:08,145
-What?
-For example,

434
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:11,773
if he gets the star of consideration

435
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:14,568
that connects <i>Gyeonu</i> star
and <i>Jiknyeo</i> star.

436
00:28:18,739 --> 00:28:21,241
Now I get what you're talking about.

437
00:28:21,325 --> 00:28:24,661
Don't worry about that.
I'll tell the husband about it.

438
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,330
Really?

439
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:28,373
Yeong Ae.

440
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:31,376
Hey! Break up with him!

441
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,546
Don't marry him!

442
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:38,592
It's best when your boyfriend
stays a boyfriend.

443
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:43,222
Once you get married,
the man you loved will be gone.

444
00:28:43,305 --> 00:28:44,306
He will disappear.

445
00:28:44,389 --> 00:28:49,686
If you love him,
just keep him in your heart!

446
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,855
Only then, he won't disappear!

447
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,483
What are you doing? Are you drunk?

448
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:56,401
-I'm sorry.
-Oh, my.

449
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:58,987
Yeong Ae.

450
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:00,989
Do you really like your husband?

451
00:29:01,073 --> 00:29:03,492
Do you like him
because he's the Senior Colonel?

452
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:06,036
Except that he's Senior Colonel,
what's so great about him?

453
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,830
He's just an old raccoon.

454
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:10,457
How could you--

455
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,168
What? Am I wrong?

456
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,545
What are you doing? Take her.

457
00:29:15,629 --> 00:29:17,965
-I'm sorry.
-He's just an old raccoon.

458
00:29:18,048 --> 00:29:19,216
-Take her!
-An old raccoon!

459
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,219
Why can't I say that he's an old raccoon?

460
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,096
-We're so sorry.
-Why is she so heavy?

461
00:29:27,224 --> 00:29:29,768
-Let go of me!
-She must have lost her mind.

462
00:29:30,727 --> 00:29:33,188
-Let go of me!
-She's so heavy.

463
00:29:33,647 --> 00:29:35,732
-Goodness.
-How drunk is she?

464
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:39,444
Let go!

465
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,516
You slept out.

466
00:30:10,851 --> 00:30:13,020
I didn't sleep outside,
so I didn't sleep out.

467
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,772
You spent the night outside,
so there's no difference.

468
00:30:18,984 --> 00:30:20,694
Would you not cross the line?

469
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,281
Think of it as the 38th parallel
and let's not cross the line.

470
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:26,199
That's what you want too.

471
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,451
You stepped on the line.

472
00:30:29,161 --> 00:30:32,039
As long as we don't cross the line,
there won't be any war.

473
00:30:32,205 --> 00:30:33,540
So please be careful.

474
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,459
Are you angry?

475
00:30:36,251 --> 00:30:38,128
No. Why would I be?

476
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:40,380
-If you're not angry--
-I said I'm not.

477
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,633
Could you put down that knife first?

478
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:52,100
I couldn't sleep last night,
so I did some calculations.

479
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,227
You left here a bit before 8:00 p.m.,

480
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:56,688
so you should have arrived in Pyongyang
by 10:00 p.m.

481
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,273
Let's say you had a cup of coffee.

482
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:01,401
Then you would've left around 11.
and you should've been back by 1 or 2.

483
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:04,571
And what time is it now?
Oh, my. It's 7:30 a.m.

484
00:31:04,654 --> 00:31:06,948
You said, "I'll be right back"
and you didn't come.

485
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,579
-I had something to do.
-I'm sure you did.

486
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:15,332
I'm going to make you a member
of the national team that participates

487
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,250
an international track competition.

488
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:22,464
What did you say?

489
00:31:23,173 --> 00:31:25,759
Then you can go to Europe by airplane.

490
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:29,638
You were looking into that?

491
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:35,519
You should have told me then.

492
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,271
Now I feel bad that I was mean to you.

493
00:31:41,525 --> 00:31:43,151
But...

494
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:48,782
I am quite athletic
and I can run pretty well.

495
00:31:48,865 --> 00:31:51,284
But I'm not good enough
to be in a national team--

496
00:31:51,368 --> 00:31:54,037
You'll be a reserve in case of injury.

497
00:31:55,705 --> 00:31:57,249
You won't have to run for real.

498
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,501
As soon as you arrive there,

499
00:32:00,127 --> 00:32:01,711
you will be gone missing.

500
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:03,880
What happens after that?

501
00:32:04,381 --> 00:32:06,383
You will go home.

502
00:32:10,971 --> 00:32:12,264
When is the flight?

503
00:32:17,102 --> 00:32:18,311
<i>Next Monday.</i>

504
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:21,815
Then I might be able to make it
to the shareholder meeting.

505
00:32:22,524 --> 00:32:25,152
I might not have enough time
to prepare, but it's okay.

506
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:28,405
You need to take a picture
in order to make a passport.

507
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:30,282
And?

508
00:32:33,034 --> 00:32:34,494
Pyongyang is not like here.

509
00:32:35,871 --> 00:32:37,414
If you don't want to look suspicious,

510
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,375
you should change a few things.

511
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,169
ILDANGBAEK BARBERSHOP

512
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,255
STANDARD FEMALE HAIRSTYLE

513
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:47,966
These are the only options I have?

514
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,636
Yes, they're typical hairstyles.

515
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,264
MANSUDAE STYLE, TIED-UP STYLE

516
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:56,683
SEAGULL STYLE, GOODBYE STYLE

517
00:32:59,102 --> 00:33:02,898
Maybe I should just shave my head.

518
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,525
Then maybe Yeong Ae will forgive me.

519
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:07,486
Whatever you do, she won't forgive you.

520
00:33:07,736 --> 00:33:09,946
So don't shave your head for nothing.

521
00:33:14,576 --> 00:33:15,952
Did you choose one?

522
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:19,456
I pick the Goodbye Style.

523
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,208
Because I'm saying
goodbye to this country.

524
00:33:21,541 --> 00:33:22,709
Excellent choice.

525
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,518
I lost all the volume.
That's why this is called Goodbye Style.

526
00:33:40,227 --> 00:33:42,604
You look beautiful.

527
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:45,649
Here. Try this on.

528
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:49,778
What?

529
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,365
-What's that?
-Why on your shoulders?

530
00:33:53,865 --> 00:33:55,909
-What are you doing?
-Why do you put it on the jacket?

531
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,286
This girl's getting into it.

532
00:33:59,371 --> 00:34:00,580
I like this.

533
00:34:02,916 --> 00:34:07,045
It looks corny but somehow hip.

534
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:13,510
I think I saw these work trousers
at the New York Fashion Week.

535
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,512
This pattern...

536
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:18,014
Hey, look. Something is missing.

537
00:34:18,223 --> 00:34:19,558
Put this on.

538
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,272
Now, you look like you could go against
the hot bitch of Pyongyang.

539
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:28,567
Go to Pyongyang and kick her butt.

540
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:30,694
You see,

541
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:33,780
I don't have to get all dolled up
to put her in her place.

542
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,825
The moment we met yesterday,

543
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,661
I kicked her butt with my bare face.

544
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:42,706
No, you didn't. Her butt wasn't kicked.

545
00:34:43,290 --> 00:34:44,291
I saw it.

546
00:34:46,459 --> 00:34:47,752
Oh, my.

547
00:34:48,628 --> 00:34:49,713
Look at this.

548
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,257
It's so pretty. How much is it?

549
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:54,718
That one is expensive.

550
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:57,554
If you're not going to buy, put it down.
It will get dirty.

551
00:34:57,637 --> 00:35:00,599
How expensive is it?

552
00:35:01,182 --> 00:35:02,559
It's 15,000 won.

553
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:05,729
-Come on. That's too expensive.
-That's too expensive.

554
00:35:06,313 --> 00:35:07,314
Do you have money?

555
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,982
I have never said this

556
00:35:09,691 --> 00:35:10,942
my entire life, but...

557
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,987
You're right. I don't have money.

558
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,033
They offer the best price.

559
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,160
Hello?

560
00:35:22,370 --> 00:35:23,496
You're back.

561
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,415
Do you still have things to pawn?

562
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,835
I'm not your customer today.
I brought someone.

563
00:35:29,419 --> 00:35:32,005
She belongs to Division 11.
She lived in South Korea before,

564
00:35:32,589 --> 00:35:33,840
so she has some good stuff.

565
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:34,924
Really?

566
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:36,676
What are you going to pawn?

567
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:57,989
This is one of the five limited edition
models from 2019 FW collections.

568
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:01,660
I bought it from the designer in person
at the main boutique.

569
00:36:05,955 --> 00:36:08,041
I bought one of the five,

570
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,793
so guess who bought the rest four.

571
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,420
You'll be surprised to hear their names.

572
00:36:12,504 --> 00:36:14,589
Paris Hilton, Miranda Kerr, and...

573
00:36:14,673 --> 00:36:16,049
Are you listening to me?

574
00:36:16,925 --> 00:36:18,176
It's light.

575
00:36:18,385 --> 00:36:20,679
Exactly. You know what it is.

576
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:23,556
When you put it on,
you can't feel it at all.

577
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:25,350
Let's not waste our time bargaining.

578
00:36:25,934 --> 00:36:27,435
I offer only a quarter of the price.

579
00:36:27,936 --> 00:36:28,978
Twenty thousand dollars.

580
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:32,691
The copper is 10,000 won
and the leather is 7,000 won.

581
00:36:32,774 --> 00:36:35,402
And 2,000 won for the labor.
I can give you 19,000 won.

582
00:36:35,485 --> 00:36:38,238
She's my friend. Make it 20,000 won.

583
00:36:38,488 --> 00:36:39,781
Fine. 20,000 won then.

584
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:44,494
I didn't say 20,000 won.
I said 20,000 dollars.

585
00:36:44,828 --> 00:36:46,287
How can this be--

586
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:47,831
Please keep this.

587
00:36:51,376 --> 00:36:52,627
That would be 35,000 won.

588
00:36:52,711 --> 00:36:55,505
Excuse me.
Why is my watch cheaper than this belt?

589
00:36:55,588 --> 00:36:57,465
This is a designer watch.
It's a limited edition.

590
00:36:57,549 --> 00:36:58,758
That doesn't mean anything.

591
00:36:59,509 --> 00:37:01,761
We go by the weight.
They should have used more leather.

592
00:37:02,345 --> 00:37:03,346
It's too light.

593
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:06,474
Making it light like this
is their technology.

594
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:10,270
Not anyone can make it like this.
It's priceless.

595
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,230
You're right.
We can't put a price on that.

596
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:15,191
If you don't want to leave it
for 20,000 won, just leave.

597
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,486
-That's not what I'm talking about.
-Then what?

598
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:21,531
I'm saying it should be
at least 5,000 won more.

599
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:23,908
Fine. 25,000 won.

600
00:37:23,992 --> 00:37:27,829
Thank you. This is great.
Usually, he's not this generous.

601
00:37:28,705 --> 00:37:29,831
Sure.

602
00:37:30,707 --> 00:37:34,210
Don't sell this, okay?
I'll soon come back to get it.

603
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:42,677
This is the original one.
Why is this here?

604
00:37:45,764 --> 00:37:47,682
There must be someone
who has a situation like me.

605
00:37:47,766 --> 00:37:50,685
He didn't even take money.
He just wanted me to keep it.

606
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:52,979
It's been years, but he never came back.

607
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:58,985
She's leaving the country next Thursday?

608
00:37:59,068 --> 00:37:59,944
Yes, sir.

609
00:38:01,154 --> 00:38:04,908
Disguised as a national team member
and by airplane?

610
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,035
Does she have a fake passport?

611
00:38:07,118 --> 00:38:08,828
I don't think so.

612
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:11,873
She went to Pyongyang Hotel
and took an ID photo for the passport.

613
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,000
They said she would
stop by Factory 926 too.

614
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:16,920
That probably means she has
a proper passport, not a fake one.

615
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,965
I heard people from Division 11

616
00:38:21,591 --> 00:38:24,511
disguised themselves
in order to leave the country secretly.

617
00:38:26,513 --> 00:38:29,474
Do you think
she really belongs to Division 11?

618
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:31,392
Pardon, sir?

619
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,688
Yes, as you can see from the deposition,

620
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:37,816
we haven't found anything suspicious.

621
00:38:39,651 --> 00:38:40,693
Is that so?

622
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:46,115
Okay. If that's what a veteran says,
that's what it is.

623
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,702
-Thank you.
-That's okay, sir.

624
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:54,666
-Comrade Jung.
-Yes?

625
00:38:55,834 --> 00:38:57,836
Why do you think we couldn't find

626
00:38:58,503 --> 00:38:59,671
Ri Mu Hyeok's watch?

627
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,561
We searched his residence, the camp,

628
00:39:15,144 --> 00:39:17,522
and everyone he knew,

629
00:39:18,523 --> 00:39:19,941
but where could it possibly be?

630
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:21,776
I'm not sure.

631
00:39:22,277 --> 00:39:23,820
Whoever has it,

632
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:26,531
that person will be in serious trouble.

633
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:28,032
Right?

634
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,201
But I'm concerned.

635
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,331
If, by any chance,
it falls into Jeong Hyeok's hand,

636
00:39:36,624 --> 00:39:38,668
both you and I will be done for.

637
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,086
Watch out.

638
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:42,714
Yes, sir.

639
00:39:48,428 --> 00:39:49,721
Company, attention.

640
00:39:52,265 --> 00:39:55,101
Captain Ri, Company Five fell in
for the afternoon training.

641
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,603
Executive Officer Hwang Yeong Beom.

642
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,062
At rest.

643
00:39:58,563 --> 00:39:59,647
At rest.

644
00:40:04,485 --> 00:40:06,613
I don't see a few company members.

645
00:40:06,696 --> 00:40:08,740
Master Sergeant Pyo Chi Su,
First Lieutenant Park Gwang Beom,

646
00:40:08,823 --> 00:40:11,075
Staff Sergeant Kim Ju Meok,
and Private First Class Geum Eun Dong

647
00:40:11,159 --> 00:40:13,411
were summoned by
State Security Department.

648
00:40:23,171 --> 00:40:24,505
Private First Class Geum Eun Dong.

649
00:40:25,006 --> 00:40:27,634
The investigation hasn't even begun yet.
Why are you crying?

650
00:40:28,635 --> 00:40:33,097
You have a mother and four siblings
back in your hometown.

651
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:36,434
You see,

652
00:40:40,355 --> 00:40:41,814
it's my plan

653
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:45,109
to save only one out of four.

654
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:50,323
One who will report the truth to me.

655
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,784
You will never get a second chance.

656
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:56,996
If you talk, you will live.

657
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,832
If you don't talk,
one of the others will live.

658
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,543
You should save yourself, don't you think?

659
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:19,936
Here.

660
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:25,441
You just need to tell me what you know.

661
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:28,569
What is the identity of the woman
who claims to be in Division 11?

662
00:41:28,653 --> 00:41:29,696
Why is she here?

663
00:41:29,779 --> 00:41:32,323
What is Captain Ri hiding?

664
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:35,451
What is he scheming at home
with his subordinates

665
00:41:35,785 --> 00:41:38,371
under the excuse
of a waterway construction?

666
00:41:45,003 --> 00:41:46,337
Talk if you are ready.

667
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:51,843
-Lieutenant Commander Cho.
-Go on.

668
00:41:52,885 --> 00:41:54,762
I am the last, right?

669
00:41:55,430 --> 00:41:57,098
-What?
-It has been a while

670
00:41:57,682 --> 00:41:59,684
since Master Sergeant Pyo Chi Su,

671
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,521
First Lieutenant Park Gwang Beom,
and Staff Sergeant Kim Ju Meok

672
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,898
got summoned.

673
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:09,110
I am the last, right?

674
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,946
But you still

675
00:42:12,405 --> 00:42:13,990
don't know anything.

676
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,870
I don't know anything either.

677
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,164
You sly motherfucker.

678
00:42:27,295 --> 00:42:31,007
Captain Ri, can't you see that I am
in the middle of an investigation?

679
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:32,759
Get out.

680
00:42:39,348 --> 00:42:42,769
If you're curious about me,
ask me instead.

681
00:42:43,561 --> 00:42:45,021
I am afraid I can't do that.

682
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:49,317
This investigation is about you.

683
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:51,694
The man who is directly involved
wouldn't tell the truth.

684
00:42:52,278 --> 00:42:53,696
I think differently.

685
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:56,032
Only the man who is directly involved
can tell the truth.

686
00:42:56,616 --> 00:42:57,575
Thus,

687
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:02,455
go and tell the truth about the things

688
00:43:03,081 --> 00:43:04,415
you have done.

689
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:06,876
What are you talking about?

690
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:17,470
Hello.

691
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:20,306
Senior Colonel.

692
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:21,891
What is the meaning of this?

693
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:25,103
Didn't you wrap up
the truck accident already?

694
00:43:26,062 --> 00:43:29,357
I received an official request
from the State Security Department

695
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:33,319
to send the drivers and you.

696
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,781
But why do they want me as well?

697
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,199
I am not involved in any way!

698
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:41,285
<i>Didn't you promise to take</i>
<i>full responsibility?</i>

699
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>Why do I need to be summoned?</i>

700
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:45,873
<i>Come to my room right away!</i>

701
00:43:47,083 --> 00:43:48,584
Listen, Ri Jeong Hyeok.

702
00:43:48,668 --> 00:43:49,836
It sounds like you are busy.

703
00:43:50,044 --> 00:43:52,255
I will take my men with me.

704
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,845
LONG LIVE THE DEMOCRATIC
PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF KOREA

705
00:44:09,856 --> 00:44:11,858
STRENGTHEN THE NATION WITH NATIONALISM

706
00:44:14,152 --> 00:44:16,445
TRANSCRIPT

707
00:44:21,033 --> 00:44:23,411
-Get lost!
-Go away!

708
00:44:23,494 --> 00:44:25,997
-Get lost!
-Get lost, Rat's son!

709
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,498
Get lost, Rat's son!

710
00:44:27,582 --> 00:44:30,168
-Get lost!
-Get lost!

711
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,878
-What?
-Get lost!

712
00:44:31,961 --> 00:44:35,089
I see that bullying is a problem
both in the North and the South.

713
00:44:35,590 --> 00:44:36,924
Get lost right this instant!

714
00:44:37,008 --> 00:44:39,135
Hey! You little punks!

715
00:44:40,261 --> 00:44:41,345
Listen.

716
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,682
Why are you harassing one boy as a group?

717
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:45,850
Who are you?

718
00:44:46,434 --> 00:44:48,394
I am from the Special Forces.

719
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:50,104
I have a good South Korean accent, right?

720
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:55,359
If you know what I have done
in South Korea, you will cower in fear.

721
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:58,279
His father is the Rat!

722
00:44:58,362 --> 00:44:59,405
The Rat?

723
00:45:01,824 --> 00:45:03,868
All occupations are honorable.

724
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:07,997
It doesn't matter what his father is.

725
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:09,498
Why do you care?

726
00:45:09,582 --> 00:45:12,960
If you continue to bully the weak,
you will be like Pyo Chi Su!

727
00:45:13,044 --> 00:45:14,545
Who is Pyo Chi Su?

728
00:45:14,629 --> 00:45:16,964
He is an ugly man.

729
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,217
If you bully him again,

730
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,761
I will tell Ri Jeong Hyeok.

731
00:45:22,345 --> 00:45:23,429
Who is Ri Jeong Hyeok?

732
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,599
He can fight incredibly well.

733
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:30,186
If he hears about this,
you will be in big trouble.

734
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:31,520
Go. Go!

735
00:45:36,734 --> 00:45:40,238
Why did you let them beat you up?

736
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:43,866
You need to fight back
so that they won't look down on you.

737
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,745
I heard I should be good to my friends.

738
00:45:47,828 --> 00:45:48,788
Who told you that?

739
00:45:48,871 --> 00:45:50,623
My father.

740
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:52,416
Your father is a great man.

741
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,085
But

742
00:45:54,627 --> 00:45:56,879
the world isn't a flower field.

743
00:45:57,463 --> 00:45:59,840
You shouldn't be good to people
who beat you up.

744
00:46:00,508 --> 00:46:03,261
Those who throw punches don't know
how much it hurts.

745
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:06,013
Only those who take punches do.

746
00:46:07,056 --> 00:46:08,933
If someone tries to harass you,

747
00:46:09,809 --> 00:46:11,894
throw a punch first.

748
00:46:12,478 --> 00:46:14,313
Did you do that?

749
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,481
Me?

750
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:17,149
Yes,

751
00:46:17,900 --> 00:46:18,818
I did that.

752
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,987
Then they stopped

753
00:46:21,654 --> 00:46:22,571
harassing me.

754
00:46:23,406 --> 00:46:24,657
They stopped coming near me too.

755
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,659
Loneliness

756
00:46:27,243 --> 00:46:28,911
is better than pain.

757
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,000
Put your backpack on.

758
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:38,629
<i>I actually heard</i>

759
00:46:39,297 --> 00:46:43,009
something in the morning
while I was cleaning up a few days ago.

760
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,802
But the sound was so indistinct.

761
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:47,346
Also, there are many walkie-talkies
on the same frequency.

762
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:48,889
Do you still want to hear it?

763
00:46:48,973 --> 00:46:50,016
Yes.

764
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,690
<i>This is Se-ri one. This is Se-ri one.</i>

765
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:02,486
Did you hear that? What do you think?

766
00:47:02,695 --> 00:47:03,821
Do you think it's her voice?

767
00:47:03,904 --> 00:47:06,032
Yes, I think it's her voice.

768
00:47:06,115 --> 00:47:07,616
Right? It's her voice, right?

769
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:11,203
I heard that voice morning and night.

770
00:47:11,454 --> 00:47:12,872
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

771
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:16,876
I get goosebumps when I hear that voice.

772
00:47:17,877 --> 00:47:19,420
I think my body remembers it.

773
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:21,255
Please give us the USB flash drive.

774
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:23,632
If we report to the police
and investigate the transmission,

775
00:47:23,716 --> 00:47:24,925
we will find her in no time.

776
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:25,968
Okay.

777
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:30,306
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

778
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:36,312
Hey, Honey.

779
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:40,149
I just arrived at Mother's place.

780
00:47:40,232 --> 00:47:41,609
I did some thinking

781
00:47:42,026 --> 00:47:45,404
and realized
that I should show my devotion, not pray.

782
00:47:46,447 --> 00:47:47,573
Mother.

783
00:47:48,324 --> 00:47:50,534
I am incredibly sorry about the last time.

784
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,954
My husband told me to visit you

785
00:47:54,038 --> 00:47:56,665
because he is too ashamed.

786
00:47:56,999 --> 00:48:00,169
You know that he is building a resort
in Bali, right?

787
00:48:00,252 --> 00:48:02,088
Once Father retires,

788
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,298
we will make one building private

789
00:48:04,882 --> 00:48:07,968
for you and Father's use.

790
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:09,345
It was my idea.

791
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:11,639
Bali? That sounds nice.

792
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,684
Do you want to ship us off?

793
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:17,061
It's not like that.

794
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:19,939
I just want you and Father
to have a romantic time--

795
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:22,274
Do you know we haven't slept
on the same bed for 20 years?

796
00:48:22,358 --> 00:48:23,859
Really?

797
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:25,945
Why?

798
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,530
I had no idea.

799
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,199
You must have been so lonely.

800
00:48:30,699 --> 00:48:31,534
Sure.

801
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,453
You must be tired. You should get going.

802
00:48:34,537 --> 00:48:35,913
I need to rest.

803
00:48:35,996 --> 00:48:37,373
Mother!

804
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:40,376
We will move into this place.

805
00:48:41,377 --> 00:48:42,294
This house is big.

806
00:48:42,378 --> 00:48:45,089
It must get lonely if the two of you sleep
in separate rooms.

807
00:48:45,256 --> 00:48:46,966
Don't think of me as a daughter-in-law.

808
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:49,718
Now, I will be your daughter.

809
00:48:49,802 --> 00:48:51,720
I mean, you don't even have one anymore.

810
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,014
What did you say just now?

811
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,892
-What did I say?
-I don't have a daughter?

812
00:48:56,976 --> 00:48:58,644
You had a daughter.

813
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:00,604
But you don't have one anymore, so--

814
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:02,648
Are you saying Se-ri is dead?

815
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:05,818
Mother, how could you say that?

816
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:07,153
Se-ri isn't dead!

817
00:49:07,736 --> 00:49:10,030
She will live in our hearts

818
00:49:10,739 --> 00:49:12,158
forever.

819
00:49:12,241 --> 00:49:14,410
-You can go now.
-Mother!

820
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,495
I have one more thing to say.

821
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:18,831
Say it.

822
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,710
You have company shares. Eight percent.

823
00:49:23,294 --> 00:49:26,172
Would you vote for us?

824
00:49:26,255 --> 00:49:30,217
If we combine them to the shares of those
on our side, we have a chance.

825
00:49:30,843 --> 00:49:31,802
What do you think?

826
00:49:32,303 --> 00:49:33,429
Honey.

827
00:49:34,138 --> 00:49:35,306
That didn't work.

828
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:38,434
She got mad at me!

829
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:42,104
I didn't say anything!
I just said I will be her daughter.

830
00:49:43,105 --> 00:49:44,773
She has a strange personality.

831
00:49:44,857 --> 00:49:46,609
That must be why they use separate rooms!

832
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:48,986
Is it because they use separate rooms?

833
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,196
I don't know.

834
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,406
By the way, did you catch the swindler?

835
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:54,658
You need to catch him.

836
00:49:55,117 --> 00:49:57,536
It will be game over
if your brother catches him!

837
00:49:59,872 --> 00:50:01,624
SHENYANG, CHINA

838
00:50:16,931 --> 00:50:17,765
Did he talk?

839
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:19,266
He is holding out.

840
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:21,393
Why would you hold out?

841
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:24,522
-You aren't saving Korea.
-I really don't know anything.

842
00:50:25,523 --> 00:50:26,524
Did you talk money?

843
00:50:27,107 --> 00:50:28,692
-Not yet.
-My goodness.

844
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,194
That's why he is holding out.

845
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:31,445
Let's end this quickly.

846
00:50:32,071 --> 00:50:33,572
How much did you get from Gu Seung-jun?

847
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,908
I will pay you a tenfold.

848
00:50:38,536 --> 00:50:39,828
Manager Oh,

849
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:42,248
I can't take him back to China now.

850
00:50:42,331 --> 00:50:45,543
I know our trade is illegal,
but there should be some business ethics.

851
00:50:45,626 --> 00:50:48,337
We promised to protect him.
How could we do that?

852
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:51,048
What?

853
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:52,132
A tenfold?

854
00:50:52,216 --> 00:50:54,134
Will he really pay a tenfold?

855
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,097
I will call you later.

856
00:51:03,727 --> 00:51:05,938
I am bored out of my mind.

857
00:51:06,772 --> 00:51:08,774
Let's go to Pyongyang tomorrow.

858
00:51:09,191 --> 00:51:11,944
Let's go to Okryu-gwan and casino.

859
00:51:13,946 --> 00:51:14,905
Let's do that.

860
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:16,865
Really?

861
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:19,118
Let's go to Pyongyang tomorrow.

862
00:51:20,578 --> 00:51:21,704
Okay.

863
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,171
All of you got beaten up.

864
00:51:31,714 --> 00:51:33,048
Would noodles be enough for you?

865
00:51:33,132 --> 00:51:36,051
These wavy noodles are tasty.

866
00:51:37,636 --> 00:51:39,513
I want to apologize to everyone.

867
00:51:40,556 --> 00:51:42,975
Don't say that. We are on the same boat.

868
00:51:44,685 --> 00:51:48,272
That's right.
She is the one who should apologize.

869
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,900
She is the one who started this.

870
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:53,902
You are right.

871
00:51:55,279 --> 00:51:57,573
I apologize.

872
00:51:58,365 --> 00:52:01,577
I am so thankful
that I want to give a present.

873
00:52:02,161 --> 00:52:03,996
But as you know, I don't have money.

874
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,333
Please take this.

875
00:52:27,019 --> 00:52:30,939
Why did she give us that heart signal?

876
00:52:32,191 --> 00:52:34,401
You said it's like a confession of love.

877
00:52:34,485 --> 00:52:36,236
I did, but--

878
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,613
Is it like a confession of love?

879
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,365
I am glad, Captain Ri.

880
00:52:39,865 --> 00:52:42,576
I was worried that the South Korean woman

881
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,454
had indecent desires for you.

882
00:52:45,913 --> 00:52:49,333
Seeing as how she sent us the signal,
it must be meaningless.

883
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:53,128
That's right. It's meaningless.

884
00:52:53,671 --> 00:52:57,341
In a capitalist society,
even the heart has no backbone.

885
00:52:57,424 --> 00:53:00,386
She sent the signal twice
to First Lieutenant Park.

886
00:53:00,469 --> 00:53:01,512
Really?

887
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,264
I didn't see that.

888
00:53:06,141 --> 00:53:07,643
Have a safe trip back.

889
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:10,145
Tomorrow, Se-ri and I are going

890
00:53:10,229 --> 00:53:12,981
to a photo studio in Pyongyang Hotel
to take Se-ri's passport photo.

891
00:53:13,065 --> 00:53:14,233
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

892
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,243
You are back.

893
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,829
I will be nice and do the dishes today.

894
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,957
I am getting a passport photo taken
tomorrow.

895
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:32,835
Why did I eat noodles?
My face will be swollen.

896
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:40,259
Why are you standing there?

897
00:53:45,013 --> 00:53:46,014
Do you

898
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,267
have multiple hearts?

899
00:53:49,101 --> 00:53:50,102
What?

900
00:53:50,561 --> 00:53:52,896
Who has multiple hearts?

901
00:53:53,772 --> 00:53:55,023
What are you talking about?

902
00:53:56,150 --> 00:53:57,317
Forget it.

903
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,236
I am wasting my breath.

904
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:05,617
I will use the bed today.

905
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,327
My back will hurt!

906
00:54:08,036 --> 00:54:09,663
I don't care.

907
00:54:12,124 --> 00:54:13,250
What is up with him?

908
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,046
What?

909
00:54:28,348 --> 00:54:30,434
That lousy capitalist heart!

910
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,573
Captain Ri's fiancee

911
00:54:44,656 --> 00:54:47,951
chased away the kids
who were harassing U Pil.

912
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:50,954
She said it doesn't matter
if you are the Rat.

913
00:54:57,377 --> 00:54:58,545
Being the Rat...

914
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,176
isn't very nice.

915
00:55:07,596 --> 00:55:08,472
It's not like

916
00:55:08,806 --> 00:55:10,599
you want to rat on the others.

917
00:55:10,682 --> 00:55:11,934
You are ordered to do so.

918
00:55:43,632 --> 00:55:44,800
<i>You lousy rat!</i>

919
00:55:47,094 --> 00:55:48,887
NINE YEARS AGO

920
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,514
Hey.

921
00:55:52,266 --> 00:55:53,308
You ratted on me, right?

922
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:55,936
Otherwise, how would they know
that I sold <i>bingdu?</i>

923
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:56,854
<i>BINGDU:</i> DRUGS

924
00:55:56,937 --> 00:55:59,731
I almost got sent to a concentration camp
because of you, okay?

925
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:01,942
I am sorry. I am sorry.

926
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,819
If you are sorry, start talking.

927
00:56:03,902 --> 00:56:05,988
Was it you? Was it another rat?

928
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,782
If it was another rat, I will let you go.

929
00:56:09,116 --> 00:56:10,993
I am sorry. I am sorry.

930
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:12,578
You leave me with no choice.

931
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:18,500
Come to think of it,
your ears are the problem.

932
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:20,544
Without your ears,
you won't be able to hear.

933
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:23,964
Without your hearing,
you won't be able to rat on the others.

934
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:31,638
-Captain!
-Don't you have anything better to do?

935
00:56:33,307 --> 00:56:34,933
Should I give you something to do?

936
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:36,351
-No, sir!

SWEET SODA POP

965
00:59:21,183 --> 00:59:24,019
By the way,
is the photo studio in the hotel

966
00:59:24,352 --> 00:59:25,812
the only place

967
00:59:25,896 --> 00:59:27,606
you can get your passport photo taken?

968
00:59:28,190 --> 00:59:29,941
That's the state-designated photo studio.

969
00:59:30,442 --> 00:59:32,152
That's the only place.

970
00:59:32,986 --> 00:59:33,945
I see.

971
00:59:43,830 --> 00:59:44,956
You know,

972
00:59:46,792 --> 00:59:48,293
I have a question.

973
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:56,468
When I go missing,

974
00:59:57,344 --> 00:59:59,596
you know, in Europe,

975
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:02,349
won't things go bad?

976
01:00:04,017 --> 01:00:05,769
What I mean to say is,

977
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:08,730
won't anything happen to you?

978
01:00:08,939 --> 01:00:10,065
Like something bad.

979
01:00:10,941 --> 01:00:13,110
<i>If the person you recommended</i>
<i>joins the national team</i>

980
01:00:13,860 --> 01:00:17,322
and causes trouble,
I won't be able to help you.

981
01:00:17,405 --> 01:00:18,740
I have no intention to do so.

982
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,784
I understand.

983
01:00:21,368 --> 01:00:22,953
I will take full responsibility.

984
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,585
Nothing will happen.

985
01:00:32,504 --> 01:00:33,797
Really?

986
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:42,556
Thank goodness.

987
01:00:57,529 --> 01:00:59,906
<i>Dear passengers,</i>

988
01:01:00,198 --> 01:01:02,159
<i>the train three to Kaesong and Pyongyang</i>

989
01:01:02,242 --> 01:01:04,995
<i>will stop for a short while</i>
<i>due to power outage.</i>

990
01:01:05,203 --> 01:01:09,249
<i>The estimated duration is ten hours.</i>
<i>Thank you for your understanding.</i>

991
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:11,168
Ten hours?

992
01:01:11,251 --> 01:01:12,961
Ten hours isn't a short while!

993
01:01:15,964 --> 01:01:17,424
It won't take ten hours.

994
01:01:18,133 --> 01:01:20,010
-Right?
-It will take longer.

995
01:01:20,886 --> 01:01:22,345
My guess is

996
01:01:22,596 --> 01:01:24,139
between 13 and 16 hours.

997
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,724
No way!

998
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:27,559
What are we supposed to do here?

999
01:01:27,893 --> 01:01:30,812
We only have two eggs left.

1000
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,356
Are you kidding me?

1001
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,942
What will we eat? Where will we sleep?

1002
01:01:36,568 --> 01:01:37,944
Don't worry.

1003
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:39,404
Don't worry?

1004
01:01:39,487 --> 01:01:41,406
It's ten hours. Am I the strange one here?

1005
01:01:41,489 --> 01:01:43,366
Look over there.

1006
01:01:43,783 --> 01:01:44,910
What?

1007
01:01:46,578 --> 01:01:47,746
What is going on?

1008
01:01:48,622 --> 01:01:51,082
Why are they running? What is going on?

1009
01:01:51,666 --> 01:01:53,585
I see that there is a big swarm.

1010
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,670
<i>Hurry up and explain!</i>

1011
01:01:55,754 --> 01:01:57,923
You will find out soon.

1012
01:01:59,883 --> 01:02:01,509
Who are those people?

1013
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,429
Why are they running towards the train?

1014
01:02:05,013 --> 01:02:06,890
-They are the hopping salespeople.
-Hopping...

1015
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,517
What exactly do they sell?

1016
01:02:11,311 --> 01:02:12,896
Buy firewood!

1017
01:02:12,979 --> 01:02:14,522
Buy skewered meat!

1018
01:02:14,606 --> 01:02:16,691
Lean forward a bit more!

1019
01:02:16,775 --> 01:02:18,235
Buy skewered meat! Buy skewered meat!

1020
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:20,612
Buy skewered meat! Skewered meat!

1021
01:02:21,196 --> 01:02:22,614
Here it is. Here it is.

1022
01:02:23,114 --> 01:02:25,075
-Hurry up and take it.
-Here.

1023
01:02:25,158 --> 01:02:26,826
-All right.
-No, no.

1024
01:02:27,869 --> 01:02:30,205
-Here you go.
-Buy skewered meat! Skewered meat!

1025
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,581
-Buy skewered meat!
-Here.

1026
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:35,752
<i>Buy firewood! Buy firewood!</i>

1027
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:39,214
-Buy chicken!
-I have blankets!

1028
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:41,591
-Buy chicken! Buy chicken!
-Buy firewood!

1029
01:02:43,677 --> 01:02:45,303
Buy corn cake!

1030
01:02:45,387 --> 01:02:47,347
Buy corn cake!

1031
01:02:51,768 --> 01:02:55,105
Are you saying we need to sleep outside

1032
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:57,315
on a bed of corn leaves?

1033
01:02:57,399 --> 01:03:00,402
It's cold inside and outside the train.

1034
01:03:01,069 --> 01:03:02,654
At least you can build a fire outside.

1035
01:03:03,530 --> 01:03:06,241
Still, this is too...

1036
01:03:08,535 --> 01:03:10,328
I think it would be warmer
inside the train.

1037
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,422
Buy firewood!

1038
01:03:20,505 --> 01:03:23,842
Buy firewood! We got firewood!

1039
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:25,135
Buy firewood!

1040
01:03:26,052 --> 01:03:27,929
Buy firewood!

1041
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:29,848
Buy firewood!

1042
01:03:30,557 --> 01:03:33,518
Buy firewood! Buy firewood!

1043
01:03:36,563 --> 01:03:37,689
My goodness.

1044
01:03:40,442 --> 01:03:41,901
Buy firewood!

1045
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:43,570
It's warm.

1046
01:03:45,488 --> 01:03:46,573
Those people have blankets.

1047
01:03:47,365 --> 01:03:48,450
Did they buy them?

1048
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:49,951
Did they bring them?

1049
01:04:00,962 --> 01:04:02,547
It's nice and warm.

1050
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:04,507
I can stretch my legs, too.

1051
01:04:04,591 --> 01:04:07,969
I feel like I got an upgrade
from economy class to business class.

1052
01:04:08,053 --> 01:04:09,846
I am glad I came outside.

1053
01:04:11,890 --> 01:04:13,641
Mr. Ri, sit down. It's warm.

1054
01:04:18,605 --> 01:04:19,773
Corns and potatoes!

1055
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:25,528
Where are you going?

1056
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:37,999
It looks delicious!

1057
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,751
Mr. Ri, you should eat.

1058
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:42,212
You said you weren't hungry.

1059
01:04:42,921 --> 01:04:44,130
It's so delicious!

1060
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:51,012
By the way, Mr. Ri.

1061
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:52,097
I saw

1062
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:55,392
people over there
buy water to wash their faces.

1063
01:04:55,475 --> 01:04:57,352
50 won for cold water
and 100 won for hot water.

1064
01:04:57,435 --> 01:05:00,313
Although hot water costs twice as much,
it would be better, right?

1065
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:02,732
Are you thinking about settling down here?

1066
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:04,150
Do you want to live here?

1067
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,070
How could one be so greedy?

1068
01:05:10,281 --> 01:05:11,533
Unbelievable.

1069
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,868
Don't act like
I am the greediest person on earth

1070
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:16,663
just because I wanted the 100-won water
to wash my face!

1071
01:05:19,791 --> 01:05:21,000
I have money, okay?

1072
01:05:21,543 --> 01:05:23,294
I will pay for my own water.

1073
01:05:23,378 --> 01:05:24,712
Where did you get that money?

1074
01:05:26,506 --> 01:05:28,216
I pawned my watch.

1075
01:05:29,008 --> 01:05:31,719
They weighed my designer watch.

1076
01:05:32,387 --> 01:05:36,224
Buying all the clothes I wanted
left me with 500 won.

1077
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:40,812
There was a really nice men's watch
at the pawnshop.

1078
01:05:40,979 --> 01:05:42,313
Are you listening to me?

1079
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:47,485
People here don't listen to me.
They don't even try.

1080
01:05:48,111 --> 01:05:49,529
Gosh, it's hot!

1081
01:05:50,905 --> 01:05:51,990
It's so hot.

1082
01:06:04,252 --> 01:06:06,296
Mr. Ri, you are a good man.

1083
01:06:06,838 --> 01:06:07,839
That was sudden.

1084
01:06:08,256 --> 01:06:11,259
Well, I suddenly had that thought.

1085
01:06:11,843 --> 01:06:12,844
Later on,

1086
01:06:13,595 --> 01:06:17,515
you will be a good husband and a good dad.

1087
01:06:18,016 --> 01:06:19,309
I don't know.

1088
01:06:20,393 --> 01:06:22,604
I haven't thought about the future.

1089
01:06:23,563 --> 01:06:24,397
Why not?

1090
01:06:29,444 --> 01:06:31,696
When things don't go as I thought,

1091
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,823
I get disappointed.

1092
01:06:35,700 --> 01:06:37,243
Has that happened to you?

1093
01:06:56,596 --> 01:06:57,889
Yes.

1094
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:05,772
I can see it broke your heart.

1095
01:07:17,242 --> 01:07:19,118
There is an Indian proverb that goes,

1096
01:07:19,786 --> 01:07:23,456
"Sometimes, the wrong train takes you
to the right station."

1097
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:27,126
It was like that for me, too.

1098
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,128
Throughout my life,

1099
01:07:30,922 --> 01:07:33,007
I always felt like
I was on the wrong train.

1100
01:07:33,091 --> 01:07:34,926
One time,

1101
01:07:35,385 --> 01:07:36,970
I wanted to give up.

1102
01:07:37,470 --> 01:07:39,556
I didn't want to go anywhere.

1103
01:07:42,684 --> 01:07:44,602
So I thought about jumping off the train.

1104
01:07:48,314 --> 01:07:50,108
Look where I am now.

1105
01:07:52,193 --> 01:07:55,363
I took the wrong train again,
and a very wrong one at that.

1106
01:07:55,446 --> 01:07:57,949
It even got me across the 38th parallel!

1107
01:08:08,626 --> 01:08:09,919
Still,

1108
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:14,382
you should think about the future

1109
01:08:15,174 --> 01:08:16,968
even if things don't always go
as you wish.

1110
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,637
I wish

1111
01:08:21,139 --> 01:08:22,974
you could be happy

1112
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,728
even after I leave, Jeong Hyeok.

1113
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:31,232
I want you to arrive at the right station

1114
01:08:32,483 --> 01:08:34,986
no matter which train you take.

1115
01:08:42,744 --> 01:08:44,245
This is so romantic.

1116
01:08:45,079 --> 01:08:46,623
So romantic I could die.

1117
01:08:49,709 --> 01:08:51,878
Wake up!

1118
01:08:53,963 --> 01:08:56,382
If you are tired, lean on me.

1119
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:57,425
Gosh!

1120
01:08:57,759 --> 01:08:58,926
Are you crazy?

1121
01:09:02,555 --> 01:09:05,016
I can't believe
it's colder inside the train.

1122
01:09:11,814 --> 01:09:14,192
What is your problem?

1123
01:09:14,275 --> 01:09:15,526
For goodness' sake.

1124
01:09:17,695 --> 01:09:19,947
How am I supposed to live this way
for ten years?

1125
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:09,515
LET US PRODUCE MORE MEAT AND MILK

1126
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:23,863
-Hurry on out.
-Let's move.

1127
01:11:34,749 --> 01:11:36,876
This place is completely different!

1128
01:11:37,710 --> 01:11:40,546
-Really?
-Hurry up and come here.

1129
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:43,090
Stop looking wildly around.
You look like a country bumpkin.

1130
01:11:43,883 --> 01:11:46,511
Hold on. What did you call me?
A country bumpkin?

1131
01:11:47,595 --> 01:11:51,265
I am the exact opposite
of a country bumpkin, okay?

1132
01:11:51,349 --> 01:11:53,601
You aren't listening to me again.
Wait for me.

1133
01:12:00,691 --> 01:12:02,193
A two-hour car ride

1134
01:12:02,276 --> 01:12:04,445
turned into a 17-hour train ride!

1135
01:12:04,529 --> 01:12:06,364
It happens here sometimes.

1136
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,616
It shouldn't happen!

1137
01:12:09,283 --> 01:12:12,036
Are you not going back?
Why do you have so much luggage?

1138
01:12:12,537 --> 01:12:15,039
I packed this and that.

1139
01:12:15,540 --> 01:12:16,791
All right.

1140
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,635
I will take the photo now.

1141
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:31,347
Look over here. One, two, three.

1142
01:12:32,723 --> 01:12:34,016
All done.

1143
01:12:35,476 --> 01:12:38,312
Excuse me. I think I closed my eyes.

1144
01:12:38,396 --> 01:12:39,689
Should I ask for another shot?

1145
01:12:39,772 --> 01:12:40,857
It's okay.

1146
01:12:41,107 --> 01:12:43,025
This photo is for verifying your identity,

1147
01:12:43,442 --> 01:12:44,986
so you shouldn't look too pretty in it.

1148
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,655
I should. How else
would they know it's me?

1149
01:12:48,489 --> 01:12:49,574
Let's go.

1150
01:12:50,283 --> 01:12:51,409
You know,

1151
01:12:52,910 --> 01:12:55,580
why don't we get our photo taken?

1152
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:57,248
I mean,

1153
01:12:57,665 --> 01:13:00,501
we won't see each other again
after I leave.

1154
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:01,836
It will be a memento.

1155
01:13:06,257 --> 01:13:07,967
There is no need for us to remember

1156
01:13:08,968 --> 01:13:10,344
or keep a memento of each other.

1157
01:13:12,805 --> 01:13:14,265
You have a point.

1158
01:13:15,516 --> 01:13:17,226
I was just saying.

1159
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:28,571
Welcome.

1160
01:13:28,654 --> 01:13:30,781
I booked a room under Mr. Cheon.

1161
01:13:31,574 --> 01:13:33,034
Please wait.

1162
01:13:41,292 --> 01:13:43,920
FRONT DESK

1163
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,296
The room number is 1511.

1164
01:13:46,005 --> 01:13:47,298
Let's go.

1165
01:13:54,847 --> 01:13:55,973
All right.

1166
01:13:56,515 --> 01:13:58,392
I will get washed up and change.

1167
01:13:58,476 --> 01:14:01,479
Let's eat first. I am terribly hungry.

1168
01:14:01,562 --> 01:14:02,772
Okay.

1169
01:14:19,288 --> 01:14:20,456
It's me.

1170
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:22,625
We arrived at Pyongyang Hotel.

1171
01:14:23,876 --> 01:14:26,420
He hasn't figured anything out,
so don't worry.

1172
01:14:27,672 --> 01:14:30,967
For some reason, I can't get ahold
of Lieutenant Commander Cho.

1173
01:14:31,968 --> 01:14:33,260
By the way,

1174
01:14:34,178 --> 01:14:36,847
can we really trust him to pay a tenfold?

1175
01:14:38,766 --> 01:14:42,478
We need to get the money
before we hand him over!

1176
01:14:46,649 --> 01:14:47,858
Give me the phone.

1177
01:15:07,128 --> 01:15:10,381
Mr. Cheon, why did you hang up?

1178
01:15:10,965 --> 01:15:12,383
Manager Oh, you little...

1179
01:15:12,925 --> 01:15:16,554
How could you do this
after getting so much money from me?

1180
01:15:16,846 --> 01:15:18,389
<i>Why are you doing this?</i>

1181
01:15:19,682 --> 01:15:21,225
<i>Hello? Hey.</i>

1182
01:15:21,308 --> 01:15:23,811
Who will pay you a tenfold? Who?

1183
01:15:24,937 --> 01:15:27,898
Seung-jun, it seems like
I am a good judge of character.

1184
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:30,943
<i>You are so intelligent.</i>

1185
01:15:31,027 --> 01:15:33,404
Who would have thought to find you there?

1186
01:15:35,156 --> 01:15:38,701
I love how you scold and praise me
in a situation like this.

1187
01:15:39,410 --> 01:15:41,704
This is why I respect you.

1188
01:15:42,288 --> 01:15:43,998
You are decisive.

1189
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,458
Quit babbling.

1190
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:48,002
Prepare to die once you get here

1191
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:49,628
after you give me my money back.

1192
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,380
You bastard.

1193
01:15:51,464 --> 01:15:52,298
<i>Mr. Yoon,</i>

1194
01:15:53,174 --> 01:15:55,259
it wasn't my intention.

1195
01:15:55,342 --> 01:15:57,094
When you run a business...

1196
01:15:58,888 --> 01:15:59,722
<i>Hello?</i>

1197
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:01,640
<i>Hello?</i>

1198
01:16:02,058 --> 01:16:03,392
<i>Why did you stop?</i>

1199
01:16:03,976 --> 01:16:05,019
Mr. Yoon.

1200
01:16:05,102 --> 01:16:05,936
<i>What?</i>

1201
01:16:06,437 --> 01:16:08,105
How is Se-ri?

1202
01:16:08,230 --> 01:16:11,776
Why did you bring her up so suddenly?
It's a sad topic.

1203
01:16:11,859 --> 01:16:14,361
Se-ri is gone. I wish I could see her.

1204
01:16:15,571 --> 01:16:16,739
I am seeing her.

1205
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:18,449
What did you say?

1206
01:16:18,532 --> 01:16:20,409
It's nothing.
What do you mean she is gone?

1207
01:16:20,493 --> 01:16:23,037
Must you ask? She is dead.

1208
01:16:23,621 --> 01:16:24,705
Dead?

1209
01:16:25,748 --> 01:16:26,624
Why?

1210
01:16:26,707 --> 01:16:28,584
It's none of your business.

1211
01:16:29,168 --> 01:16:32,129
I guess you will see her in heaven soon.

1212
01:16:32,713 --> 01:16:34,465
Send her my regards when you see her.

1213
01:16:35,049 --> 01:16:35,883
I will do that.

1214
01:16:36,842 --> 01:16:38,052
I will send her your regards.

1215
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,054
I think I will be able to do that.

1216
01:16:44,475 --> 01:16:46,143
You really are Yoon Se-ri!

1217
01:16:46,227 --> 01:16:47,103
I mean...

1218
01:16:47,186 --> 01:16:48,312
How...

1219
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:52,149
Where are you taking me?

1220
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:57,363
This has to be fate.

1221
01:16:57,947 --> 01:17:01,492
-I guess I won't die after all.
-What are you...

1222
01:17:13,796 --> 01:17:14,922
Who are you?

1223
01:17:24,223 --> 01:17:25,266
Yoon Se-ri.

1224
01:17:25,850 --> 01:17:27,143
-I think--
-Let's break up.

1225
01:17:27,226 --> 01:17:28,769
I was going to say that.

1226
01:17:28,853 --> 01:17:30,271
Let me make this clear.

1227
01:17:30,354 --> 01:17:32,898
I broke up with you. I dumped you.

1228
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:35,901
You can tell people that you dated me,

1229
01:17:35,985 --> 01:17:38,779
but don't even think about
spreading rumors

1230
01:17:39,029 --> 01:17:40,781
of how you dumped me.

1231
01:17:40,865 --> 01:17:43,033
You know how scary
rich people can be, right?

1232
01:17:43,367 --> 01:17:44,743
I could end you.

1233
01:17:44,827 --> 01:17:46,203
You are always like this.

1234
01:17:46,287 --> 01:17:48,539
You push people away before you get hurt.

1235
01:17:48,664 --> 01:17:50,708
You leave before you are in for a wait.

1236
01:17:51,125 --> 01:17:54,170
I hope you meet someone like you.

1237
01:17:54,920 --> 01:17:56,797
Someone who makes you wait endlessly.

1238
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:01,719
That won't happen.

1239
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:04,805
I will never make a fool out of myself

1240
01:18:04,972 --> 01:18:07,224
by waiting for someone.

1241
01:18:16,650 --> 01:18:17,943
Ri Jeong Hyeok.

1242
01:18:19,153 --> 01:18:20,946
What's taking him so long?

1243
01:18:22,865 --> 01:18:24,033
Crap.

1244
01:19:24,843 --> 01:19:27,304
You're protecting me
right now, Jeong Hyeok.

1245
01:19:27,388 --> 01:19:29,139
Not protecting,
but keeping my eyes on you.

1246
01:19:29,223 --> 01:19:32,184
I'm not a person who follows you around
to protect you.

1247
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,979
Could I do well and not get caught?

1248
01:19:35,062 --> 01:19:36,021
You left your key.

1249
01:19:36,105 --> 01:19:37,773
If things like this happen twice in a row,

1250
01:19:37,856 --> 01:19:39,233
I should be upset, right?

1251
01:19:39,316 --> 01:19:41,318
Don't be so upset because of that man.

1252
01:19:41,402 --> 01:19:42,861
I didn't follow him.

1253
01:19:42,945 --> 01:19:44,154
We just came together.

1254
01:19:44,238 --> 01:19:47,574
I decided on a wedding date
with that man just a while ago.

1255
01:19:47,658 --> 01:19:50,369
Do you intend to keep
one more person other than me?

1256
01:19:50,452 --> 01:19:51,287
Who is she?

1257
01:19:51,370 --> 01:19:54,248
It's the liking part
that's giving me a headache.

1258
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:56,583
