1
00:00:46,455 --> 00:00:50,737
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

2
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:53,971
ALL CHARACTERS, INCIDENTS, ORGANIZATIONS,
AND BACKGROUND ARE FICTITIOUS

3
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:55,514
What are you doing?

4
00:00:56,098 --> 00:00:57,015
Open up.

5
00:00:57,099 --> 00:00:58,392
Now, I will do something.

6
00:00:58,475 --> 00:01:00,018
Don't be startled

7
00:01:00,644 --> 00:01:01,728
and keep your eyes on me.

8
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,443
What?

9
00:01:10,529 --> 00:01:11,738
What was that?

10
00:01:25,335 --> 00:01:26,378
Hey, open it again.

11
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,225
What are you guys doing?

12
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:43,020
Come on out.

13
00:01:43,395 --> 00:01:44,271
Come out now.

14
00:01:55,449 --> 00:01:56,658
RI JEONG HYEOK

15
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:06,293
Well, you know what you shouldn't do.

16
00:02:06,376 --> 00:02:08,462
Why did you come all the way here
and do such things?

17
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,589
Didn't I tell you before?

18
00:02:10,672 --> 00:02:13,800
They wanted to go night fishing,
so I set a boat afloat.

19
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:15,677
But what I just witnessed

20
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,138
wasn't night fishing.

21
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:23,352
Look, Officer. They are a man
and a woman with young blood.

22
00:02:23,435 --> 00:02:25,479
When they go for a walk,
they don't just take a walk.

23
00:02:26,063 --> 00:02:29,232
They don't just drink
when they go out drinking, do they?

24
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,026
They are out for fishing,

25
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:33,153
but they can't just cast
fishing rods the whole time.

26
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:36,990
Then there's no way
they can put forth buds

27
00:02:37,074 --> 00:02:38,867
who will lead our country into the future.

28
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,993
Don't you think so?

29
00:02:40,077 --> 00:02:41,870
Is that so?

30
00:02:41,953 --> 00:02:46,083
Were you trying
to put forth buds in there?

31
00:02:47,918 --> 00:02:50,462
I guess there's a misunderstanding.
It's not like...

32
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:53,507
We are getting married soon,

33
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,425
so we are kind of in a hurry.

34
00:02:58,011 --> 00:02:59,012
I got it.

35
00:02:59,513 --> 00:03:00,514
But I can't let you

36
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,474
stay here anymore.

37
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:05,060
Head back once you're done
with your business.

38
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:07,270
Well...

39
00:03:07,354 --> 00:03:10,565
Wait. We still have something to do here.

40
00:03:10,649 --> 00:03:12,067
-A little more time--
-Come on, now.

41
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,694
Turn the boat back.

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:16,613
Of course. I'll turn the boat right away.

43
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,656
Let's go.

44
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:19,866
Wait. Excuse me. Hang on...

45
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,869
Do something. We can't go back like this.

46
00:03:22,953 --> 00:03:24,746
Isn't it the ship over there?

47
00:03:26,081 --> 00:03:27,499
You just saw the whole thing.

48
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,293
We can't go any further.

49
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,962
What do I do then?

50
00:04:18,175 --> 00:04:20,093
Excuse me, Mr. Ri Jeong Hyeok.

51
00:04:20,427 --> 00:04:22,012
I have to go now.

52
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:24,222
I have to go even if I die on my way.

53
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,224
I won't stop you
if you want to kill yourself.

54
00:04:27,267 --> 00:04:29,811
But do you want the captain
of this boat to die with you?

55
00:04:29,895 --> 00:04:31,271
Do you think he will do that?

56
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:50,499
EPISODE 4

57
00:04:52,709 --> 00:04:54,002
In life,

58
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:57,130
people get into accidents,
both big and small.

59
00:04:57,214 --> 00:04:58,590
They also get a little lost.

60
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,259
Someone I know went from Gangnam
to Daejeon when he first learned

61
00:05:01,343 --> 00:05:03,261
how to drive
because he couldn't turn left.

62
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:04,971
I'm like him now.

63
00:05:05,472 --> 00:05:07,891
I ended up in North Korea,
not Daejeon though.

64
00:05:09,601 --> 00:05:10,727
I guess the distance

65
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,063
is not so different.

66
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,607
-Aren't you getting on the boat?
-About today...

67
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:17,818
Fine.

68
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:22,697
I'll stay positive and take it
as being lost a bit longer.

69
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:26,076
But I will be leaving next week, won't I?

70
00:05:26,159 --> 00:05:27,327
It's impossible.

71
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,956
I know

72
00:05:31,832 --> 00:05:33,124
it will be hard.

73
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:36,586
But there might be a way out
if we try really hard, right?

74
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,421
No.

75
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,131
Once a sea control order is issued,

76
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:42,551
it takes at least
10 to 15 days for it to be lifted.

77
00:05:42,634 --> 00:05:44,553
Do you really

78
00:05:45,095 --> 00:05:46,888
have to talk like that in this situation?

79
00:05:47,138 --> 00:05:48,473
I'm just telling you the truth--

80
00:05:48,557 --> 00:05:50,934
Do you think I want to hear the truth now?

81
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,435
Do you want me to lie--

82
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,980
I'm not telling you to lie.
I just want you to comfort me.

83
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,148
"It's okay. We can do it."

84
00:05:57,232 --> 00:05:59,025
I can't give you false consolation.

85
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,193
You're despicable.

86
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:02,612
What? Despicable?

87
00:06:02,696 --> 00:06:06,074
Don't look at me like that as if you've
never lied before in your whole life.

88
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,702
-This is just how my eyes look--
-You were so good at lying before.

89
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,829
-But why can't you do it now?
-When did I ever--

90
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,372
You said I'm your fiancée.

91
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,710
-I just had no choice back then--
-What about the kiss?

92
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,630
Just so you know,

93
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:22,591
I don't cling to stuff like that.

94
00:06:22,674 --> 00:06:24,134
I'm not that old-fashioned.

95
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,760
Besides, it wasn't even a kiss.

96
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:28,096
People greet each other
with smooches like that in Paris.

97
00:06:28,179 --> 00:06:31,141
But don't you think
I'll need an explanation for that,

98
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,350
since we're not in Paris now?

99
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,395
You told me to do something, so--

100
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:38,565
I told you to do something.
I didn't tell you to kiss me.

101
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:40,734
But you just said it wasn't even a kiss.

102
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:47,907
So that's where you draw the line?

103
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:50,910
Are you saying it's okay
because it was a smooch?

104
00:06:50,994 --> 00:06:53,580
-I didn't mean it--
-And it means nothing to you?

105
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,957
-It's not that--
-You sound so cool about it.

106
00:06:56,041 --> 00:06:57,667
Are we in Hollywood or what?

107
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,461
I've never been to Hollywood--

108
00:06:59,544 --> 00:07:00,378
That's it.

109
00:07:01,046 --> 00:07:02,297
You feel bad for me, don't you?

110
00:07:02,714 --> 00:07:04,090
If you do, promise me one thing.

111
00:07:04,174 --> 00:07:07,344
Promise you'll let me have some espresso
in the best cafe in Gangnam next week.

112
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,679
I can't make a promise I can't keep.

113
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:17,020
Darn it.

114
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:44,881
<i>Thank you for what you've done for me.</i>

115
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,717
<i>I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.</i>

116
00:07:47,801 --> 00:07:51,554
<i>I will find my way
to get out of here alive on my own.</i>

117
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:05,318
All right.

118
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:07,654
I can't just sit back and wait.

119
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:09,781
I should do something.

120
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,157
If I die on my way,

121
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:14,244
then so be it.

122
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:21,084
This is Se-ri one.

123
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:24,629
If someone hears me, please say yes.

124
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,677
It's okay. It will start working
on the way.

125
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,305
Yoon Se-ri.

126
00:08:36,266 --> 00:08:37,392
What?

127
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:39,644
How did you...

128
00:08:41,312 --> 00:08:44,190
I sneaked out while you were asleep.

129
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,652
I know you did, but I heard you leave.

130
00:08:49,821 --> 00:08:51,448
I heard the door slam behind you.

131
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:54,451
How did you know I was here?

132
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:57,996
Did you drag this
all the way up here on purpose?

133
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,330
So I can follow you?

134
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:01,916
No.

135
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:03,752
Did you not read my message?

136
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:05,587
I don't want to cause you
any more trouble.

137
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:08,131
This is how I landed here.
Might as well leave like this, right?

138
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:10,383
There was a natural disaster
when you got here,

139
00:09:10,467 --> 00:09:12,469
but things are not like that now.

140
00:09:13,595 --> 00:09:16,181
Since it's an unpowered aircraft,
it won't be spotted on the radar.

141
00:09:16,264 --> 00:09:18,016
But you'll be seen with the naked eye.

142
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,060
And what if they do see me?

143
00:09:20,143 --> 00:09:21,811
You can imagine what will happen.

144
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:29,861
You will be shot on sight.

145
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:31,571
Whether you land on the North or South.

146
00:09:31,905 --> 00:09:33,156
MILITARY POLICE

147
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,000
This one.

148
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:46,169
How long has it been on?

149
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,005
STATE SECURITY DEPARTMENT

150
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:59,349
-What's the matter?
-Lieutenant Commander.

151
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:02,143
There's a suspicious transmission
from Mount Janam.

152
00:10:02,227 --> 00:10:03,186
Was there a message?

153
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,563
We are analyzing it now.
Considering the frequency and band,

154
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:07,690
it seems to be an attempt
to contact the South.

155
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,110
Seal off the area
and make a thorough search.

156
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,028
-It's an emergency order.
-Yes, sir.

157
00:10:12,862 --> 00:10:14,114
Turn the car around.

158
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,286
Scouts?

159
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:23,623
In case of an unknown signal,
they arrive on the scene in ten minutes.

160
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:26,417
I think they have already left.

161
00:10:27,836 --> 00:10:30,922
We will get caught either way we go.

162
00:10:33,049 --> 00:10:34,259
Mr. Ri.

163
00:10:35,051 --> 00:10:36,136
Stay here.

164
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:38,972
I'll go down.

165
00:10:40,223 --> 00:10:41,683
I'll get caught on my way down.

166
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:43,893
Then they won't come all the way up here.

167
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:45,311
Then what?

168
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:49,524
The State Security Department
already thinks you are my fiancée.

169
00:10:50,817 --> 00:10:52,152
What do we do then?

170
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,112
You said I'd get caught either way.

171
00:11:10,712 --> 00:11:11,754
Let's go this way.

172
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:13,298
What? That way?

173
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,430
What are you thinking?
What are you going to do?

174
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,099
I'm thinking about
where we could go with this.

175
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:24,851
Wait.

176
00:11:55,924 --> 00:11:57,300
Hold tight.

177
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:00,970
I have to.

178
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:04,390
I was just

179
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,977
upset and frustrated earlier.

180
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:09,604
I know.

181
00:12:11,606 --> 00:12:12,607
In fact,

182
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,777
I'm very grateful for everything.

183
00:12:17,403 --> 00:12:18,655
I know that, too.

184
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:23,034
You always say that.

185
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:04,695
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

186
00:13:08,371 --> 00:13:10,331
That's where the signal was detected.

187
00:13:10,498 --> 00:13:14,293
-Where else in the world could it go?
-We're still searching the area.

188
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:19,716
You are excused.

189
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:31,352
So they came back
without going to Pyongyang?

190
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:33,646
Yes. They came back together this morning.

191
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,440
Why?

192
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:36,983
I'm not sure.

193
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:39,027
Something about them is fishy.

194
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,653
Keep a keen eye on them.

195
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:43,489
-I'll look into them at the same time.
-Yes, sir.

196
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:46,743
Are you going home now
after working all night?

197
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:56,627
Stop by at a market
and buy some meat on your way home.

198
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,379
It's okay, sir.

199
00:13:58,463 --> 00:13:59,797
No need to stand on ceremony.

200
00:14:00,506 --> 00:14:02,341
Woo Pil, is it? Your son's name?

201
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,427
And he's ten.

202
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,553
Yes, sir.

203
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:07,722
Kids at his age eat like a horse.

204
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:08,973
Feed him well with this.

205
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:16,355
Thank you, sir.

206
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,610
It's 20 won.

207
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:23,404
We have leaf tobacco here.

208
00:14:23,905 --> 00:14:24,739
Seon Hwa,

209
00:14:24,822 --> 00:14:28,576
I'll send some sweatsuits and sneakers
on the 8 p.m. train tonight.

210
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:30,411
Make sure to get them at the station.

211
00:14:30,912 --> 00:14:33,247
Send the fruit flavor cookies
and strawberry gums

212
00:14:33,331 --> 00:14:36,084
to Chung Seong's in Hoeryong, okay?

213
00:14:38,753 --> 00:14:40,546
Please give me 1kg of pork.

214
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,256
Is it someone's birthday?

215
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,051
What makes you buy pork today?

216
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:48,096
It's for my son.
Give me the good one, please.

217
00:14:48,179 --> 00:14:49,347
Don't worry.

218
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,433
I sell the best meat in the market.

219
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,186
Do you have coffee beans?

220
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:56,646
Coffee beans?

221
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:58,773
We only have stick coffee.

222
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,525
It's from down there.

223
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:02,652
I need coffee beans though.

224
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:04,278
I can get them for you.

225
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:06,864
If you pay in advance,
I will place an order with the trader

226
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:08,574
coming from Yanggang Island tonight.

227
00:15:08,658 --> 00:15:11,285
They have everything there
except a cat's horn.

228
00:15:11,369 --> 00:15:13,204
Here you are.

229
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,545
-My money!
-My goodness.

230
00:15:20,628 --> 00:15:22,296
Go catch the pickpocket!

231
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:23,881
Catch the pickpocket.

232
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,007
Out of my way.

233
00:15:27,552 --> 00:15:29,011
Move over.

234
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:32,098
CONTRIBUTE TO IMPROVE
THE LIFE OF THE PEOPLE

235
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,058
Wasn't he a guy from the gang?

236
00:15:34,142 --> 00:15:35,476
Was he a gang member?

237
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:39,397
There's no way
an officer can deal with him by himself.

238
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:40,898
I should've stopped him.

239
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:43,651
The gangsters are going to
knock the officer down.

240
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:01,461
Hey, Mr. Captain.

241
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:05,131
We all are discharged soldiers.

242
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,300
You don't scare us at all.

243
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,803
I'll spare your life,

244
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,347
so go mind your own business.

245
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:22,398
All right then.

246
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,193
If you insist on dying today.

247
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:15,284
I don't know how to thank you.

248
00:17:15,368 --> 00:17:16,702
You don't have to.

249
00:17:16,786 --> 00:17:18,996
There are a lot of pickpockets
in the market. Be careful.

250
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,581
Okay.

251
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:21,541
All right then.

252
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:57,326
I heard about it from my uncle.

253
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,120
You don't have to worry though.

254
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:02,373
Captain Ri is trying to find a way.

255
00:18:04,250 --> 00:18:05,376
I usually

256
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,795
don't eat breakfast.

257
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,465
It's called intermittent fasting.

258
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,385
When I do, I eat lightly.

259
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,304
I just eat one or two spoonful

260
00:18:16,387 --> 00:18:19,974
of organic oatmeal from Canada
with some organic maple syrup

261
00:18:20,057 --> 00:18:21,392
which is also from Canada.

262
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,269
What is she talking about?

263
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,229
Does anyone know Michelin Guide?

264
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:29,108
I have dinner only in restaurants
with Michelin stars.

265
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,278
But the chefs who work there
only have one dear wish,

266
00:18:33,154 --> 00:18:35,615
which is to see me finish my dish.

267
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:39,493
Whatever they served me,
I only had three bites of it.

268
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,205
That's how I got my nickname,

269
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:46,334
Picky Princess.

270
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:49,003
That's who I used to be.

271
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,674
How come now I'm in love
with rice crust and sugar?

272
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,637
Rice crust tastes good with sugar.

273
00:18:57,720 --> 00:19:00,473
Why am I having my fifth piece already?

274
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:02,683
You greedy woman.

275
00:19:02,767 --> 00:19:04,935
You're eating up all the food
Captain Ri owns.

276
00:19:05,019 --> 00:19:06,103
You should feel guilty.

277
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:09,065
Can't you see that I'm mixing in too well?

278
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,108
I have to go back as soon as possible.

279
00:19:11,442 --> 00:19:14,362
Otherwise, I might end up
living here forever.

280
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,490
Why are you talking all the crap
after eating rice crust?

281
00:19:17,573 --> 00:19:20,201
I know. You're afraid too, aren't you?

282
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,827
I'm really scared.

283
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:24,330
So you guys should help me.

284
00:19:26,082 --> 00:19:28,918
I can't just count on Ri Jeong Hyeok.
It's not going to work.

285
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:34,256
By the way, where's Captain Ri?

286
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,341
I don't know.

287
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,426
He went out to buy something.

288
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,762
Oh, that's it. You see,

289
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,972
he told us to come and protect you.

290
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,475
What? Protect?

291
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,645
-Protect who?
-You, of course.

292
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,191
Me?

293
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:57,321
Gosh.

294
00:19:57,613 --> 00:19:59,407
I mean, I won't crumble to pieces

295
00:19:59,573 --> 00:20:01,826
just because he left me alone for a while.

296
00:20:07,164 --> 00:20:10,292
What else did Ri Jeong Hyeok say about me?

297
00:20:11,001 --> 00:20:12,878
That we can't let you be on your own.

298
00:20:14,004 --> 00:20:16,132
Gosh, what is he trying to do?

299
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,551
I am not a child.

300
00:20:18,884 --> 00:20:20,678
I'm fine being on my own.

301
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:23,431
Ri Jeong Hyeok is so silly.

302
00:20:23,514 --> 00:20:25,683
He is over-the-top.

303
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,018
It's obvious he has no trust in you,

304
00:20:28,102 --> 00:20:29,478
given the troublemaker you are.

305
00:20:29,562 --> 00:20:30,855
He wanted us to keep watch.

306
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:33,107
Will you stay quiet?

307
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:34,942
You darned wench.

308
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:38,070
I just felt great thinking she was gone.

309
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,530
Why are you back?

310
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:41,282
-Hey, Pyo Chi Su.
-What?

311
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,075
I didn't want it to come down to this,

312
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:45,453
-but I want you to return my stuff.
-Return what?

313
00:20:45,536 --> 00:20:47,163
My shampoo, conditioner, and body wash.

314
00:20:48,497 --> 00:20:49,582
Sorry, but I must decline.

315
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,709
-What?
-I was doing fine without them,

316
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,670
but now I just can't live
without the shampoo you got me.

317
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,338
What are you saying?

318
00:20:56,422 --> 00:21:00,092
My head has never been so fragrant before.

319
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:02,595
Also,

320
00:21:02,678 --> 00:21:04,972
in my nation, you can't take back
what you've already given.

321
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:15,816
What's the matter again?

322
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,236
There is an important
announcement for you.

323
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:22,573
Today is Yeong Ae's birthday.

324
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:25,451
Who is Yeong Ae?

325
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:27,495
You met her the other day.

326
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,414
She's the Senior Colonel's wife,

327
00:21:30,498 --> 00:21:32,917
-and in our village--
-So she's the Head.

328
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,002
The Head?

329
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,796
Whatever, I know who she is. So what?

330
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:42,009
So there will be a birthday celebration.

331
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:45,429
Thank you for inviting me.

332
00:21:45,513 --> 00:21:46,680
Okay, then.

333
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,767
We are meeting up
at 3 p.m. this afternoon.

334
00:21:50,059 --> 00:21:51,811
We will cook together, and--

335
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:53,437
Thank you for inviting me,

336
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,649
but I don't go
to someone else's BP. Sorry.

337
00:21:56,732 --> 00:21:58,192
Bye.

338
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:05,908
What is a BP?

339
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:12,081
One way or another,

340
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,167
she means she won't come
to the celebration, doesn't she?

341
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:16,585
You think?

342
00:22:16,919 --> 00:22:18,629
Gosh, has she no decency?

343
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,923
She has no decency and has no manners.

344
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,384
She sure is missing a lot of stuff.

345
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:32,560
Did Ri Jeong Hyeok not say anything else
since that day?

346
00:22:34,103 --> 00:22:36,397
Did he not take revenge or something?

347
00:22:36,981 --> 00:22:39,608
-Did the Central Party not summon you?
-I told you, no.

348
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,569
Well, I came all the way out here.

349
00:22:41,652 --> 00:22:43,821
I might as well go
and apologize to him, don't you think?

350
00:22:44,321 --> 00:22:47,157
I even grabbed him by the collar that day.

351
00:22:47,825 --> 00:22:48,993
I was out of my mind.

352
00:22:49,076 --> 00:22:51,704
So you're not here to see me,
but to grovel at his feet, is that it?

353
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,540
No, it's not like that.

354
00:22:54,623 --> 00:22:58,210
I suffer from insomnia,
so I'm taking pills these days.

355
00:22:59,211 --> 00:23:02,798
Ri Jeong Hyeok isn't a guy
who'd act rashly and take revenge.

356
00:23:04,008 --> 00:23:05,884
-Then?
-He must be plotting something

357
00:23:05,968 --> 00:23:08,304
in secret to do some digging.

358
00:23:08,512 --> 00:23:09,680
Isn't it worse?

359
00:23:09,763 --> 00:23:12,141
I can't do this. I should go to him

360
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,809
-and get down on my knees--
-Hey.

361
00:23:14,727 --> 00:23:17,813
Didn't you say that you knew
someone from the United Front Department?

362
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:18,731
Yes.

363
00:23:18,981 --> 00:23:22,109
My cousin works in Section Three
of the United Front Department. Why?

364
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,195
Ri Jeong Hyeok has a fiancée.

365
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,282
And I heard she belongs to Division 11.

366
00:23:28,365 --> 00:23:29,199
Division 11?

367
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:31,994
I must say no one can match him.

368
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,371
His dad is the Director
of the General Political Bureau,

369
00:23:34,455 --> 00:23:36,332
and his fiancée works at Division 11.

370
00:23:36,665 --> 00:23:37,625
My gosh.

371
00:23:37,708 --> 00:23:39,460
But it's a little strange.

372
00:23:39,793 --> 00:23:43,505
I should check
if she really is in Division 11.

373
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:47,259
I'll go to Pyongyang in your car
on your way back.

374
00:23:47,343 --> 00:23:49,845
Let me meet with your cousin.

375
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,940
Who was that guy?

376
00:24:02,066 --> 00:24:05,027
There was a guy
who looked scary like a mugger.

377
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:07,237
He broke into my place
at night the other way.

378
00:24:07,321 --> 00:24:10,032
You mean
Lieutenant Commander Cho Cheol Gang.

379
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:12,034
Right. Lieutenant Commander.

380
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:15,829
I wish I was found

381
00:24:15,913 --> 00:24:17,539
in front of his place.

382
00:24:17,623 --> 00:24:20,626
Everyone seems intimidated by him.
He's high in ranks, right?

383
00:24:20,751 --> 00:24:22,169
He's very high.

384
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:24,421
What about Ri Jeong Hyeok?

385
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:28,467
Of course, Captain Ri is quite...

386
00:24:28,550 --> 00:24:29,551
He's not high, is he?

387
00:24:30,511 --> 00:24:32,888
Well, compared to
the Lieutenant Commander...

388
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:33,847
So he's low.

389
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,557
Right.

390
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,144
I knew it. I should've gone to him.

391
00:24:39,395 --> 00:24:41,730
Ri Jeong Hyeok is too low in rank.

392
00:24:41,814 --> 00:24:44,942
Is there any way he can get promoted soon?

393
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:47,444
Why do you even care?

394
00:24:48,112 --> 00:24:50,531
I just want him to have some power

395
00:24:50,614 --> 00:24:52,700
so he can do something for me.

396
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,953
Hey, Pyo Chi Su.
Do you want me to settle down here?

397
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,163
Do you want me to stay?
Is that what you want?

398
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:01,834
I guess there might be a way.

399
00:25:02,543 --> 00:25:03,627
What?

400
00:25:04,253 --> 00:25:05,379
The Preferential Star.

401
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,756
What? Preferential Star?

402
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,384
There will be an announcement
about the Preferential Stars winners.

403
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,094
What is it? What is the star for?

404
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:15,472
It's like an opportunity to get promoted

405
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,267
when it's not the promotion season.

406
00:25:18,350 --> 00:25:20,811
It sounds great. Who grants the stars?

407
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:23,021
It's the Senior Colonel.

408
00:25:23,105 --> 00:25:24,064
Really?

409
00:25:24,148 --> 00:25:26,942
Then does the Senior Colonel
like Ri Jeong Hyeok?

410
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,236
Do you think he will get
the Preferential Star this time?

411
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:35,826
The high-ups always seem to

412
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:37,828
just hate Captain Ri.

413
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,205
That's why we have such a hard time.

414
00:25:40,789 --> 00:25:41,832
I see.

415
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:43,792
I know what you mean.

416
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:49,047
Then who is
the Senior Colonel's closest ally?

417
00:25:49,131 --> 00:25:53,010
Like the shortest way
to get to the Senior Colonel.

418
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:56,180
The Senior Colonel is famous
for being obedient to his wife.

419
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:58,432
Oh, so he's a devoted husband.

420
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,186
Hang on.

421
00:26:03,312 --> 00:26:04,813
The Senior Colonel's wife...

422
00:26:05,814 --> 00:26:06,899
Isn't she the Head?

423
00:26:07,733 --> 00:26:09,860
All right then.

424
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,072
Today is Yeong Ae's birthday.

425
00:26:14,156 --> 00:26:17,659
Before the main celebration,
for the smooth progress of events,

426
00:26:17,743 --> 00:26:20,871
I'd like to go through the birthday gifts.

427
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,915
Your cooperation will be appreciated.

428
00:26:23,957 --> 00:26:25,584
My goodness.

429
00:26:26,168 --> 00:26:29,463
This one is wrapped.

430
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:30,464
Why did you wrap it?

431
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:33,425
Are you ashamed of it?

432
00:26:34,468 --> 00:26:35,761
It's from down South.

433
00:26:36,637 --> 00:26:37,721
What is it?

434
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:39,681
It's medicine.

435
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,391
Red ginseng.

436
00:26:41,475 --> 00:26:44,645
I heard it's really good for
curing depression and anxiety

437
00:26:44,728 --> 00:26:46,647
of menopausal women.

438
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:49,858
You should've gotten it
for her last birthday.

439
00:26:49,942 --> 00:26:53,695
Then things would've been
easier for us for the past year.

440
00:26:54,029 --> 00:26:54,988
It's my bad.

441
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,866
All right. You should
get me one next time.

442
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,451
Next.

443
00:27:00,744 --> 00:27:03,497
My gosh. What do we do, Wol Suk?

444
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:05,415
She brought books as a gift.

445
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,460
Look here, comrade.

446
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:12,673
Did you not get the notice?

447
00:27:12,756 --> 00:27:14,716
What's the theme of her birthday gift?

448
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,927
It's beauty and health.

449
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:19,721
That's right. Then you tell me.

450
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:24,768
Which one does your gift belong to?
Beauty or health?

451
00:27:25,394 --> 00:27:28,772
After Yeong Ae sees
things that are pretty and healthy,

452
00:27:28,856 --> 00:27:31,066
once she sees these books,
the celebration will be over.

453
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,734
She might even flip the table like this!

454
00:27:32,818 --> 00:27:35,654
-I'm sorry. I didn't think that through.
-Move over.

455
00:27:35,737 --> 00:27:36,947
My gosh.

456
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,908
What is this?

457
00:27:41,243 --> 00:27:42,578
Is it a dress?

458
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:44,162
Yes. I made it myself.

459
00:27:44,746 --> 00:27:47,207
It's very light and soft,
she won't even know she's wearing it.

460
00:27:47,791 --> 00:27:48,959
It'd be best if she didn't.

461
00:27:51,962 --> 00:27:53,630
Hello.

462
00:27:53,714 --> 00:27:55,257
What are you doing here?

463
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:57,926
Didn't you say you weren't coming?

464
00:27:58,594 --> 00:27:59,511
What brings you here?

465
00:27:59,595 --> 00:28:01,555
You don't go to someone else's BP.

466
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:06,351
This isn't just a BP.
It's a celebration party.

467
00:28:06,435 --> 00:28:07,978
This one is okay.

468
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,105
Put it right here.

469
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:12,149
-This is her favorite dish.
-We did our best.

470
00:28:12,232 --> 00:28:13,358
-Don't put it there.
-Here?

471
00:28:13,442 --> 00:28:16,778
Thank you all for doing this. Have a seat.

472
00:28:16,862 --> 00:28:18,030
Thank you, everyone.

473
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,823
-My seat.
-No, I'm sitting here.

474
00:28:19,907 --> 00:28:21,700
-Move over a bit.
-She liked these the best.

475
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,994
Hey, Captain Ri's fiancée.

476
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:28,165
Since this is your first time,
I'll let you sit next to me.

477
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:29,082
I don't want to.

478
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:34,129
I don't like to sit
next to someone who's too pretty.

479
00:28:37,883 --> 00:28:39,259
I'd...

480
00:28:45,182 --> 00:28:46,475
rather sit here.

481
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:48,936
My goodness.

482
00:28:50,479 --> 00:28:53,315
I see you are a woman of principle.

483
00:28:58,111 --> 00:28:58,946
Yeong Ae,

484
00:28:59,529 --> 00:29:02,532
we brought you gifts to show
how happy we were for your birthday,

485
00:29:02,616 --> 00:29:05,244
and gathered them here.

486
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,372
-That's right. Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

487
00:29:08,455 --> 00:29:11,458
I told you not to do this.

488
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,378
But...

489
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:17,005
Captain Ri's fiancée came empty-handed.

490
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,549
There's one more here.

491
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:21,635
No, it's just too lame.

492
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,638
I'm not lame at all.

493
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:28,433
This is the hottest trend
that swept the global fashion scene.

494
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:30,018
<i>-Newtro</i>
-What?

495
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,604
<i>-"Newtro"?
-"Newtro"?</i>

496
00:29:32,688 --> 00:29:33,897
-What's that?
-What's "Newtro"?

497
00:29:33,981 --> 00:29:35,190
What do you say?

498
00:29:35,274 --> 00:29:36,775
May I try

499
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,944
and fix this baby up a little?

500
00:29:39,528 --> 00:29:41,571
-This is very good.
-Try this, too.

501
00:29:42,239 --> 00:29:43,907
This is delicious.

502
00:29:46,535 --> 00:29:47,661
No way.

503
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:51,164
How did that plain dress
turn this fabulous?

504
00:29:51,665 --> 00:29:53,208
What was the name of this?

505
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,043
It's "Flower Garden."

506
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,380
The subtle progression
of the floral pattern

507
00:29:58,463 --> 00:30:00,215
is the biggest trend of this season.

508
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,926
The blurred effect that adds to
the softenings of patterns

509
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,429
and this irregular arrangement

510
00:30:05,512 --> 00:30:09,141
that sets a natural tone to the dress
are the key points to its beauty.

511
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,018
The movements of the drapes

512
00:30:11,101 --> 00:30:13,437
remind us of a Greek goddess.

513
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,772
This fashionable dress depicts

514
00:30:15,856 --> 00:30:19,234
the peak of Ms. Ma's femininity.

515
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:22,696
-Yes.
-Yes.

516
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:24,531
That's the theme of the dress.

517
00:30:25,741 --> 00:30:28,577
Gosh, I didn't know
that she was this good.

518
00:30:29,119 --> 00:30:31,121
It was only possible
because the dress you brought

519
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:33,248
was already sophisticated.

520
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:38,045
Myeong Sun, eat a lot.
Pack some food on your way home.

521
00:30:38,128 --> 00:30:40,756
What? Okay. Thank you.

522
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,299
I'm jealous.

523
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,679
You know what?
I still don't know your name.

524
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,348
-Pardon?
-Gosh.

525
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:50,599
I know you're in Division 11.

526
00:30:50,682 --> 00:30:53,393
But I'm sure you can tell me your name.
It's not like we're strangers.

527
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,021
Of course. We're not strangers.

528
00:30:56,897 --> 00:30:58,190
My name is...

529
00:31:00,942 --> 00:31:03,236
CHOE SAM SUK,
<i>SOMEONE ENGRAVED IN YOUR HEART</i>

530
00:31:04,821 --> 00:31:06,073
Sam Suk.

531
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,866
It's Choe Sam Suk.

532
00:31:13,163 --> 00:31:14,664
I'm sorry.

533
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:18,543
All of a sudden, she said she was going
to attend Ms. Ma's birthday party.

534
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,087
Why did she go to the birthday party?

535
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:23,632
She said she was going to help you get
the Preferential Star.

536
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:25,217
As if she can actually help me.

537
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:32,307
Does she really think
she's my fiancée or something?

538
00:31:32,808 --> 00:31:36,395
She said that it'd be easier for her
to get out of here if you won the Star.

539
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:38,772
According to her, you are

540
00:31:39,481 --> 00:31:41,024
like a nobody.

541
00:31:41,817 --> 00:31:43,568
-A nobody?
-Yes.

542
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:46,238
She thinks that because your rank is low

543
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,906
and you don't have any power,

544
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:49,908
she can't get out of here.

545
00:31:55,163 --> 00:31:58,625
It's not true that I don't have any power.

546
00:31:59,209 --> 00:32:00,460
Pardon?

547
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:03,505
It's nothing.

548
00:32:03,964 --> 00:32:07,217
By the way, may I ask why you're going
to the Repair Unit of Engineer Brigade?

549
00:32:07,801 --> 00:32:09,761
The car crash that happened that night.

550
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,556
I'm certain that it wasn't
a mere accident.

551
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:16,935
Do you think the secret truck unit
actually exists, as rumors say?

552
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:21,148
I'll request the log of repaired vehicles.

553
00:32:21,231 --> 00:32:22,274
What?

554
00:32:22,858 --> 00:32:25,318
Do you think they'll give you the log
without protest?

555
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:27,404
<i>No.</i>

556
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,613
Captain.

557
00:32:31,199 --> 00:32:33,243
This is for an investigation.

558
00:32:33,743 --> 00:32:34,828
Let us check briefly.

559
00:32:40,542 --> 00:32:42,377
SAFETY OF THE PEOPLE, PROTECTION OF PEACE

560
00:33:22,626 --> 00:33:23,710
<i>Investigation?</i>

561
00:33:23,793 --> 00:33:25,629
Only the State Security Department
holds investigations.

562
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:27,214
Don't get smart with me!

563
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:30,634
What? Get smart with you?
You'd better watch your tongue.

564
00:33:31,593 --> 00:33:32,469
Captain Ri.

565
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:34,137
That's enough.

566
00:33:36,056 --> 00:33:37,307
Thank you.

567
00:33:41,853 --> 00:33:44,147
I tried to stall time
because you told me to,

568
00:33:45,398 --> 00:33:47,025
but are you sure that was enough?

569
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,824
Yes, this is enough.

570
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,747
<i>Thank you for coming
all the way to Pyongyang.</i>

571
00:34:01,331 --> 00:34:05,001
No. I should thank you
for meeting me here.

572
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,920
What would you like?

573
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:07,921
PYONGYANG JEIL HOTEL

574
00:34:08,004 --> 00:34:09,172
LIST OF BEVERAGES

575
00:34:09,256 --> 00:34:11,007
I'd like an iced cameral macchiato.

576
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,886
I see. Locals in Pyongyang
are indeed sophisticated.

577
00:34:15,303 --> 00:34:17,514
Even the name of the beverage
sounds like a code.

578
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:19,099
This is nothing.

579
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,518
I would like carbonated ginger tea.

580
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,353
Okay. Please wait.

581
00:34:27,107 --> 00:34:28,817
I heard from my cousin that

582
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,194
you wanted me to look
into an individual in Division 11.

583
00:34:31,278 --> 00:34:32,404
Who is it?

584
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,700
The captain at my post,
Civilian Police Battalion,

585
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,159
has a fiancée from there.

586
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:39,661
-Fiancée?
-Yes.

587
00:34:40,287 --> 00:34:42,872
She's in her early to mid-30s.

588
00:34:42,998 --> 00:34:46,418
From the way she speaks, it seems
she stayed in South Korea for a long time,

589
00:34:47,002 --> 00:34:48,962
and she recently returned home.

590
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,840
Disclosing the identities
of individuals under special protection

591
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,717
is actually prohibited
in our division as well.

592
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:57,137
That's why I'm asking you in private.

593
00:34:57,429 --> 00:34:59,598
There would be only a handful

594
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,642
of such individuals over several years,

595
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:05,562
I will be able to come up
with a list of possible individuals.

596
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,442
A female in her early to mid-30s.

597
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,569
South Korean accent.

598
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,114
Do you know her name?

599
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:17,991
<i>Sam Suk.</i>

600
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:20,076
Yes?

601
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,786
I appreciate your help today.

602
00:35:21,870 --> 00:35:25,415
Thanks to you, I have
this beautiful dress. Thank you.

603
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:28,084
No. It was really fun today.

604
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:34,591
Well, if you have a chance,

605
00:35:35,091 --> 00:35:41,222
please put in a good word for my fiancée
with your husband.

606
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:44,309
What? With Se Dae Ju?

607
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,188
Your husband is Se Dae Ju?

608
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:49,981
That's right.

609
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:54,027
Please put in a good word for him
with Comrade Se Dae Ju.

610
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,904
Is there something wrong?

611
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,449
Well, everyone knows
that Comrade Ri is the best there is.

612
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,951
He's tall and has a nice build,

613
00:36:02,035 --> 00:36:04,120
but he's not that social.

614
00:36:04,204 --> 00:36:08,750
Deep down, he has so much respect
for the Senior Colonel.

615
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:12,420
Like a fool, he doesn't know
how to express his respect.

616
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:16,675
My gosh. All right.

617
00:36:16,758 --> 00:36:19,469
I'll talk to him. Don't worry about that.

618
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,513
My gosh, really?

619
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:23,890
-Thank you, Yeong Ae.
-What?

620
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:25,975
My gosh.

621
00:36:26,559 --> 00:36:28,770
Can I call you Yeong Ae?

622
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:32,232
I don't think
you and I have a big age difference.

623
00:36:32,482 --> 00:36:33,983
You're not younger than me, right?

624
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:36,861
My goodness.

625
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:39,989
-Do you think I'm that young?
-Yes.

626
00:36:40,073 --> 00:36:42,033
Gosh. Oh, my.

627
00:36:42,117 --> 00:36:44,536
Just call me whatever you want.

628
00:36:47,414 --> 00:36:49,958
I'll make you pretty clothes later.

629
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,293
Sounds great. Don't worry.

630
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,728
Jeong Hyeok.

631
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:15,817
Did you wait for me?

632
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,446
Gosh, nonsense.

633
00:37:20,155 --> 00:37:21,239
Didn't you see me just now?

634
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,365
I was coming...

635
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,909
I mean, I was coming from over there.

636
00:37:26,494 --> 00:37:27,328
Why here, though?

637
00:37:29,247 --> 00:37:31,458
Well, this is my neighborhood.

638
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:35,879
I think you were waiting for me.

639
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:36,838
No, I wasn't.

640
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:39,883
What were you doing at her house
this late at night?

641
00:37:42,594 --> 00:37:43,928
Don't even start.

642
00:37:44,012 --> 00:37:47,599
You know, I owe you a lot, Captain Ri.

643
00:37:48,057 --> 00:37:50,810
I thought that I should help you move up
the ladder while I'm here.

644
00:37:50,894 --> 00:37:54,814
I worked really hard to help you
win the Preferential Star.

645
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:56,149
Goodness.

646
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,068
You must have gotten the wrong idea.

647
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,614
It's not like I don't have any power
or that I have a low status here.

648
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:04,657
This is a unique bicycle.

649
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:07,535
Do I sit in the front?

650
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:16,795
<i>It gets dark at night here,
so don't stay out too late.</i>

651
00:38:18,254 --> 00:38:20,173
Are you worried about me, Jeong Hyeok?

652
00:38:21,549 --> 00:38:22,759
No, it's not like that.

653
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,594
Then what is it like?

654
00:38:25,512 --> 00:38:27,013
The thought of you bothers me.

655
00:38:27,806 --> 00:38:29,182
That means you're worried about me.

656
00:38:29,891 --> 00:38:31,142
No, it's different.

657
00:38:31,226 --> 00:38:33,061
-It's the same thing.
-It's different.

658
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,188
It's the same thing.

659
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,531
Gosh, that looks scrumptious.

660
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,200
What? Why didn't you guys go back?

661
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:48,785
Are you sure you can stay out here?

662
00:38:48,868 --> 00:38:51,329
Captain Ri told our sergeant major

663
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:54,958
that we will return to base at night after
we finish our work here, so we're fine.

664
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,000
Come here.

665
00:38:56,084 --> 00:38:58,753
Captain Ri bought some clams
from the market.

666
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,421
What?

667
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,093
-Hey.
-You startled me.

668
00:39:05,677 --> 00:39:07,929
Hey, you scared me for a second.

669
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:10,598
It's like a campfire.

670
00:39:10,682 --> 00:39:12,976
This is called a clam bulgogi.

671
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,727
The clams are really hot.

672
00:39:14,811 --> 00:39:15,937
You should wear gloves.

673
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,564
Here's how we eat this.

674
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:22,151
We eat it like this.

675
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:23,820
And as for the soju...

676
00:39:29,117 --> 00:39:30,410
That's how we do it.

677
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,621
Gosh, what is that?

678
00:39:34,289 --> 00:39:35,915
All right. Try it.

679
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,253
You know, when it comes
to dishes with clams,

680
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:43,131
I only eat <i>bouillabaisse</i>.

681
00:39:44,507 --> 00:39:46,301
-Are you sure this is cooked?
-Yes.

682
00:39:57,145 --> 00:39:58,771
All right. Have some soju.

683
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:01,190
I'm in a tight spot.

684
00:40:01,733 --> 00:40:05,695
I only drink Sauvignon Blanc
when I eat seafood.

685
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,498
Did you put sugar in this, Ju Meok?

686
00:40:17,624 --> 00:40:19,375
-No.
-This is sweet.

687
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:21,961
Pour me a shot, too.

688
00:40:23,796 --> 00:40:25,715
You're still young.

689
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:27,175
You can't drink. You're only 17.

690
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,302
He's in the army. Of course, he can drink.

691
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:30,553
Here. Drink it.

692
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:32,096
-No. You can't.
-Drink it.

693
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:33,932
Minors shouldn't drink alcohol.

694
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:40,188
You have many crafty ways
of drinking more alcohol.

695
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,273
-Why is it so sweet?
-My goodness.

696
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,860
-How could it taste so sweet?
-Hey, listen.

697
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,074
All right. Get ready.

698
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,201
-Pour me another shot.
-Be careful.

699
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:03,836
Pour me some, too.

700
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,005
Here you go.

701
00:41:08,091 --> 00:41:09,384
Check this out.

702
00:41:12,345 --> 00:41:14,013
Please pour me a drink.

703
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,181
Here.

704
00:41:15,515 --> 00:41:16,516
Let me.

705
00:42:13,197 --> 00:42:14,198
Se-hyeong.

706
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:16,200
Yes, Father.

707
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,787
You should take over the company.

708
00:42:19,871 --> 00:42:21,330
-Father!
-Father!

709
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:24,709
Thank you. I'll do my best!

710
00:42:24,876 --> 00:42:26,586
There's no need to do your best.

711
00:42:26,669 --> 00:42:27,628
You must do a good job.

712
00:42:27,712 --> 00:42:30,506
I'll show you what doing
a good job is all about!

713
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:39,390
I can't believe this.
You're so unreasonable.

714
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,434
What did you just say, you punk?

715
00:42:41,517 --> 00:42:43,186
I can understand why he's so angry.

716
00:42:43,269 --> 00:42:45,438
Giving the company to him
doesn't make sense.

717
00:42:45,521 --> 00:42:47,899
When you were behind bars,

718
00:42:47,982 --> 00:42:50,526
my husband was the one who quietly
ran your company on your behalf.

719
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:53,362
He did all the dirty and hard work
for the company.

720
00:42:53,446 --> 00:42:54,906
I wouldn't say it was quiet.

721
00:42:55,198 --> 00:42:58,284
He was on the news when people were
beginning to forget about his last mess.

722
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:00,411
Sang-a, be quiet.

723
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:03,748
Stop it.

724
00:43:04,499 --> 00:43:05,875
I won't put up with you anymore.

725
00:43:05,958 --> 00:43:08,211
It's just that
I cannot grasp the situation.

726
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:12,256
Father, when you were in prison,
did something happen to you?

727
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:15,384
I'm Se-jun.
I'm the oldest son of this family!

728
00:43:15,468 --> 00:43:17,678
Succeeding a company
isn't like queueing for a restaurant.

729
00:43:17,762 --> 00:43:20,056
The order you came in doesn't matter.

730
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,308
It's the company
Father has built all his life.

731
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:24,435
Of course, he wants
his competent son to take over.

732
00:43:24,519 --> 00:43:27,897
Are you saying that you got the company
because you're more competent?

733
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,441
Don't be petty about this.
Just accept your defeat.

734
00:43:31,109 --> 00:43:33,611
But why don't I remember you
accepting your defeat?

735
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:36,489
Father. Do you know
what that jerk said when you announced

736
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:38,574
Se-ri would take over the company?

737
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:41,786
He suggested getting
the tabloids involved.

738
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,497
He wanted to disclose to the public

739
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,332
that Se-ri was your illegitimate daughter

740
00:43:46,415 --> 00:43:47,959
and use the press to bury her.

741
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,711
He wanted to humiliate Se-ri,
so she would leave Korea.

742
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,755
-Wasn't that what you said?
-My gosh.

743
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:54,507
-Did he really say that?
-Yes.

744
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,593
You're way nastier than I expected.

745
00:43:57,677 --> 00:43:59,971
Hye-ji, watch your language.

746
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,098
You watch your language, you punk.

747
00:44:02,431 --> 00:44:04,225
Okay. Fine.

748
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:06,853
-So that wasn't a nasty comment at all.
-What?

749
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,313
What did you say when Se-ri went missing?

750
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:10,481
You said something like

751
00:44:10,565 --> 00:44:12,817
even if the sky falls,
there's a way to survive.

752
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:16,362
You were happy that Se-ri was dead.
That's what you said.

753
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:18,531
Even if we don't get along,
she's our family.

754
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,032
I have to say,

755
00:44:20,324 --> 00:44:22,076
you scared me a little when you said that.

756
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,705
Oh, my. Can you bring me
white paint and a cape?

757
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,456
Are you Baron Ashura?

758
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,125
You're unbelievable, you two-faced jerk.

759
00:44:29,709 --> 00:44:32,545
When did you ever treat Se-ri
like she was part of our family?

760
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:35,965
Mother, say something.

761
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,133
You know what?

762
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:40,136
Let's all be honest here.

763
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,554
Did anyone at this table

764
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:45,266
consider Se-ri part of our family?

765
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:50,479
You all treated her as if she was
some unwanted stray dog.

766
00:44:50,563 --> 00:44:52,398
Mom, when Father brought her home,

767
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:56,235
you probably wanted to abandon her
if no one was looking.

768
00:44:56,736 --> 00:44:57,737
Be quiet!

769
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:03,618
-Mother, please side with us.
-Don't be childish.

770
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,036
<i>Ninety six,</i>

771
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,580
<i>ninety seven,</i>

772
00:45:08,039 --> 00:45:09,290
ninety eight,

773
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,375
ninety nine...

774
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,253
One,

775
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:16,464
two,

776
00:45:18,299 --> 00:45:19,216
three,

777
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:20,968
four...

778
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,181
Do you want to hear my opinion?

779
00:45:25,264 --> 00:45:26,432
Yes.

780
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,269
I think you made the wrong decision.

781
00:45:30,353 --> 00:45:31,771
-Right?
-Exactly.

782
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,772
Mom.

783
00:45:33,648 --> 00:45:35,775
We don't know what happened to Se-ri yet.

784
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:37,777
So

785
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,571
finding a replacement for Se-ri

786
00:45:40,655 --> 00:45:42,949
is being too rash.

787
00:45:43,032 --> 00:45:45,117
Mom, what are you saying?

788
00:45:45,201 --> 00:45:47,244
Mom, that's not what we're talking about.

789
00:45:47,328 --> 00:45:49,038
That's my opinion.

790
00:45:49,664 --> 00:45:51,290
That we don't know yet.

791
00:45:53,376 --> 00:45:54,418
I believe

792
00:45:56,087 --> 00:45:58,756
Se-ri can come back.

793
00:45:59,382 --> 00:46:00,216
<i>Gyedan.</i>

794
00:46:01,342 --> 00:46:02,760
Stair. Hurry up.

795
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:03,886
A word starting with <i>dan</i>...

796
00:46:03,970 --> 00:46:05,554
Five, four,

797
00:46:05,638 --> 00:46:07,640
-Be quiet.
-three...

798
00:46:08,516 --> 00:46:10,059
<i>Dan muk!</i>

799
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,852
What? What is that?

800
00:46:13,813 --> 00:46:14,730
What do you think?

801
00:46:14,814 --> 00:46:17,858
Do you not even have <i>dan muk</i>
in South Korea?

802
00:46:18,859 --> 00:46:22,697
It's a name for sweet snacks
made of gelatin.

803
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,281
I see. Like jelly?

804
00:46:24,365 --> 00:46:25,282
Yes.

805
00:46:25,366 --> 00:46:29,453
Gosh. That's nothing.
You're bragging about nothing.

806
00:46:30,037 --> 00:46:32,498
<i>Muk</i>? <i>Muksabal</i>.

807
00:46:34,041 --> 00:46:35,668
<i>Bal...</i>

808
00:46:36,168 --> 00:46:37,545
<i>Balbari cha</i>.

809
00:46:38,129 --> 00:46:39,088
What?

810
00:46:39,422 --> 00:46:40,756
What is that?

811
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,968
What? Are you serious?

812
00:46:44,051 --> 00:46:47,096
You don't even have <i>balbari cha</i>
in South Korea?

813
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,309
That means taxi.

814
00:46:54,103 --> 00:46:56,397
No taxis in South Korea? As if.

815
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,774
We have 16 lanes full of taxis,

816
00:46:58,858 --> 00:47:01,694
so many that the roads get congested.
That's Seoul.

817
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:04,155
Fine. Lie all you want.

818
00:47:04,238 --> 00:47:05,573
I won't believe you.

819
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:07,867
Whatever.

820
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:10,411
So... <i>cha</i>?

821
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:13,622
<i>-Cha?</i>
-Five,

822
00:47:13,706 --> 00:47:15,750
-<i>Cha...</i>
<i>-Four.</i>

823
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,376
<i>Be quiet.</i>

824
00:47:18,044 --> 00:47:20,296
<i>-Three.
-Don't count so fast.</i>

825
00:47:20,379 --> 00:47:22,631
<i>I'm not counting fast at all.</i>

826
00:47:22,715 --> 00:47:23,716
<i>Two.</i>

827
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:24,675
<i>CHA</i>

828
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,052
<i>Charimpyo.</i>

829
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,597
<i>Chaga beoseot</i>.

830
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:31,474
My gosh.

831
00:47:31,557 --> 00:47:34,268
I don't think there's any word
that starts with <i>seot</i>.

832
00:47:34,852 --> 00:47:36,812
-It's over.
-<i>Seot</i>...

833
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:40,107
<i>Seod-dal Geumeum!</i>

834
00:47:40,191 --> 00:47:42,943
You know it's spelled differently.

835
00:47:43,027 --> 00:47:45,237
Can't you tell the difference
between <i>seot</i> and <i>seod</i>?

836
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,867
-<i>Seojjok-haneul.</i>
-What?

837
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,037
That's spelled <i>seo</i>, <i>jjok</i>, <i>ha</i>, <i>neul</i>.

838
00:47:56,207 --> 00:47:58,834
Hey, Chi Su. Don't be petty.

839
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:00,628
Just accept your defeat.

840
00:48:01,170 --> 00:48:03,339
Wait. Hold on. Hey.

841
00:48:04,757 --> 00:48:05,841
I'll just drink it.

842
00:48:06,842 --> 00:48:08,094
All right.

843
00:48:08,177 --> 00:48:10,221
<i>-Drink, drink a lot
-Drink, drink a lot</i>

844
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,598
<i>-Hurry up and drink
-Hurry up and drink</i>

845
00:48:12,681 --> 00:48:15,392
<i>-Man up and drink, or you'll be a coward
-Man up and drink, or you'll be a coward</i>

846
00:49:05,484 --> 00:49:06,485
Oh, no.

847
00:49:09,405 --> 00:49:11,657
How'd I end up in bed yesterday?

848
00:49:15,369 --> 00:49:16,871
I smell coffee.

849
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,927
Wait, you had this?

850
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:34,555
Yes, during my study abroad.

851
00:49:36,015 --> 00:49:38,142
Did you study abroad? Where?

852
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,895
Is it Switzerland?

853
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,147
What did you major in?

854
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:47,526
My, it's so fragrant.

855
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,048
It's so delicious.

856
00:50:12,468 --> 00:50:15,471
Hot hand-dripped coffee
is the best for hangovers.

857
00:50:16,222 --> 00:50:17,765
I'm feeling better already.

858
00:50:17,848 --> 00:50:20,267
I've made bean sprout soup,
that'll make you feel even better.

859
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,528
Why is this so absurdly good?

860
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:34,198
Jeong Hyeok.

861
00:50:37,076 --> 00:50:38,827
I'm thankful for many things

862
00:50:39,203 --> 00:50:40,746
as well as the coffee,

863
00:50:40,829 --> 00:50:42,081
so I have something for you.

864
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:44,583
One minute.

865
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,647
This sign?

866
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,275
-Yes.
-I know.

867
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:11,443
Could it mean "Just like how I can squish

868
00:51:11,527 --> 00:51:13,404
a tiny bug and kill it like this,

869
00:51:13,487 --> 00:51:15,531
two fingers is all I need to destroy you",

870
00:51:15,614 --> 00:51:17,616
-or something like that?
-No.

871
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,244
It's a hand heart.

872
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:24,790
First off, you know
what a heart represents, right? The organ.

873
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:28,460
My heart? What about it?

874
00:51:28,544 --> 00:51:31,839
"I would like to give you my heart."

875
00:51:31,922 --> 00:51:32,923
That's what it means.

876
00:51:33,007 --> 00:51:35,759
Why would she suddenly want to
donate her organ to him?

877
00:51:35,843 --> 00:51:38,554
Goodness. Heart means love.

878
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:39,805
In South Korea,

879
00:51:41,015 --> 00:51:42,975
this means that they like you.

880
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:47,229
Hey, don't blabber such ridiculous things

881
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:50,065
just because we don't know that country.
That's absurd.

882
00:51:50,149 --> 00:51:51,400
Why is it absurd?

883
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,068
I saw this coming

884
00:51:53,152 --> 00:51:57,197
ever since he lied in front of everyone

885
00:51:57,281 --> 00:51:59,366
that she was his fiancée.

886
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:00,826
What do you mean?

887
00:52:03,287 --> 00:52:05,873
Are you sure nothing happened
between you two ever since?

888
00:52:08,042 --> 00:52:09,335
At all?

889
00:52:16,175 --> 00:52:18,844
He may have done it
solely to disguise themselves,

890
00:52:18,927 --> 00:52:21,805
but she could've had the butterflies.

891
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,474
"The butterflies"?

892
00:52:23,557 --> 00:52:25,768
It's when your heart flutters.

893
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,897
Why do you look so shocked?

894
00:52:30,481 --> 00:52:33,984
I'm sure many women confessed
their feelings to you.

895
00:52:34,234 --> 00:52:36,904
I'm sure you won't understand.

896
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:39,740
But no matter how many times
you experience such an incident,

897
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,992
you'll never be able to get used to it.

898
00:52:42,576 --> 00:52:45,537
I'm sure you won't understand it either.

899
00:52:48,749 --> 00:52:50,000
What's the problem?

900
00:52:50,084 --> 00:52:52,294
That woman will leave soon anyway.

901
00:52:52,378 --> 00:52:55,714
It's not like Captain Ri is
an immoral man who would be doing this

902
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,550
when he's engaged
or married to someone else.

903
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,057
-You do?
-You do?

904
00:53:05,557 --> 00:53:06,767
PYONGYANG JEIL DEPARTMENT STORE

905
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:11,188
WELCOME

906
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,155
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

907
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:25,202
PYONGYANG JEIL DEPARTMENT STORE
WAS APPROVED BY THE GREAT LEADER

908
00:53:27,413 --> 00:53:28,414
HOSPITALITY!
GENEROSITY!

909
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:31,917
KOREAN CLOTHING SHOW, 2ND FLOOR

910
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,169
I'm so upset.

911
00:53:34,253 --> 00:53:35,963
I sent you to Russia to study.

912
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:37,840
You must not have liked the food.

913
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:39,007
You've become so scrawny.

914
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,760
I lost weight on purpose.

915
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:44,054
If I eat whatever I want,
they call me a pig.

916
00:53:44,138 --> 00:53:46,348
Don't be absurd.

917
00:53:46,432 --> 00:53:48,809
A woman needs a bit of fat on her

918
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,394
to look elegant and endearing.

919
00:53:50,477 --> 00:53:52,604
-Mrs. Go.
-Hi.

920
00:53:52,687 --> 00:53:54,522
I had a great time here.

921
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,857
I hope to see you next time again.

922
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:57,525
Okay.

923
00:53:57,609 --> 00:54:00,445
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you very much.

924
00:54:00,528 --> 00:54:02,030
See you!

925
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,534
Did you learn English?

926
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,328
I thought you hated it
since it was the language of the US.

927
00:54:09,746 --> 00:54:11,999
Wouldn't I be a true citizen
of this nation

928
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:13,667
to know my enemy's language?

929
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,753
Last time, she attended a meeting
and was humiliated

930
00:54:16,837 --> 00:54:19,590
for not speaking the language.
That's when she began learning it.

931
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,634
Myeong Seok, don't you need to go work?

932
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:24,260
Don't go.

933
00:54:24,344 --> 00:54:25,721
Of course.

934
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:27,514
I do have to go.

935
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:29,808
But weren't you the one
who asked me to drive you?

936
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,643
Go right now.

937
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:34,730
Dan, check out her pronunciation.

938
00:54:35,439 --> 00:54:36,982
Doesn't she sound so unctuous?

939
00:54:37,065 --> 00:54:39,276
Hey, this is a basic skill
you need to have

940
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:40,736
in order to do business abroad.

941
00:54:40,819 --> 00:54:43,280
Humiliated? As if.

942
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:44,865
What an asshole.

943
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:45,949
Get lost.

944
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:47,618
What?

945
00:54:55,209 --> 00:54:57,711
Isn't that too flashy?

946
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:01,173
It's been years
since you've met your fiancée.

947
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:03,008
Isn't it a bit too much?

948
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:04,218
This is fine.

949
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:06,303
Still...

950
00:55:06,386 --> 00:55:09,056
Who is this?

951
00:55:11,558 --> 00:55:12,768
Dan, it's you.

952
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,269
When did you come back?

953
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,480
Have you been well?

954
00:55:16,563 --> 00:55:18,440
It hasn't been long.

955
00:55:18,524 --> 00:55:21,443
Goodness, look at you.

956
00:55:21,527 --> 00:55:23,070
You look so thin.

957
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,155
You look awful.

958
00:55:26,907 --> 00:55:28,116
Is Jin Sook doing well?

959
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,993
Of course.

960
00:55:30,077 --> 00:55:32,913
Last year, she gave birth
to a healthy son.

961
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:35,332
She became pregnant again this year.

962
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:38,001
Her mother-in-law is elated
and keeps talking

963
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,504
about how blessed she is.

964
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:42,798
That's great.

965
00:55:43,966 --> 00:55:45,759
She's feeding her baby
in the nursing room.

966
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:47,928
-You should go see her.
-Okay.

967
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,680
I'll see you again.

968
00:55:49,763 --> 00:55:50,639
Sure.

969
00:55:59,856 --> 00:56:04,027
Go and take her down a peg.

970
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:05,988
Put them in their place.

971
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:07,823
Come on, mom.

972
00:56:08,407 --> 00:56:10,909
I can do that no matter how I dress.

973
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:19,001
She's getting old

974
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:21,169
and is losing weight as well.

975
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:24,047
She must be going through a lot.

976
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,842
She lost weight on purpose

977
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:28,969
in order to fit the global trend.

978
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:31,471
These days, if you eat whatever you want,

979
00:56:31,555 --> 00:56:33,390
people will call you a pig.

980
00:56:33,473 --> 00:56:34,766
Do you even know that?

981
00:56:34,850 --> 00:56:37,227
Why are you getting all worked up?

982
00:56:37,853 --> 00:56:40,272
I'm just worried that she's like that

983
00:56:40,355 --> 00:56:41,857
when everyone else is getting married

984
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,483
and having a family of their own.

985
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,611
Don't you worry about a thing.

986
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,529
For the last ten years
while she was in Russia,

987
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:49,531
the Director of
the General Political Bureau's son

988
00:56:49,615 --> 00:56:50,699
had been yearning for her.

989
00:56:50,782 --> 00:56:52,117
Is that so?

990
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:54,828
Then I'm relieved.

991
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:58,498
Rumor had it that he wasn't interested
in getting married

992
00:56:58,582 --> 00:57:01,209
and volunteered to be stationed
at the outpost line.

993
00:57:01,293 --> 00:57:02,502
Hey!

994
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:06,214
They will be getting married this year,

995
00:57:06,298 --> 00:57:09,676
so come and enjoy our noodles.
That's all I have to say. So...

996
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:11,553
Goodbye.

997
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:36,495
Doesn't it feel better

998
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,705
to come out with us
rather than staying at home?

999
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:40,791
You're right.

1000
00:57:42,626 --> 00:57:43,794
Yeong Ae.

1001
00:57:47,047 --> 00:57:49,341
Weren't you looking for powder last time?

1002
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:52,761
We finally got some from <i>You and Me</i>.

1003
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:56,264
They're only exported to Europe.

1004
00:57:56,348 --> 00:57:59,559
But I got one just for you.

1005
00:58:00,727 --> 00:58:03,105
I'll buy it next time. Hope you sell many.

1006
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:04,564
We also have some

1007
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:06,358
from South Korea.

1008
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:12,739
This essence is popular

1009
00:58:12,823 --> 00:58:14,366
down there.

1010
00:58:14,449 --> 00:58:15,575
Hold on.

1011
00:58:16,118 --> 00:58:19,037
When did my products become this famous?

1012
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:23,583
About 15 million of these were sold.

1013
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:27,546
Twenty million, it's twenty...

1014
00:58:29,631 --> 00:58:30,924
It looks moisturizing.

1015
00:58:31,425 --> 00:58:32,676
What's in it?

1016
00:58:34,428 --> 00:58:35,762
There's...

1017
00:58:37,264 --> 00:58:38,390
Well...

1018
00:58:38,765 --> 00:58:41,768
Everything good is in it.

1019
00:58:41,852 --> 00:58:44,855
They ground the entire field into it.

1020
00:58:44,938 --> 00:58:46,606
You can think of it that way.

1021
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:49,484
I think there are Korean pepper,
pasqueflower,

1022
00:58:49,568 --> 00:58:52,154
and white ginseng extracts in this.

1023
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:55,115
Whitening is a given.

1024
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:57,784
With its slim-fit technology,
it has a light, air-like finish

1025
00:58:57,868 --> 00:58:58,952
with no stickiness to it.

1026
00:58:59,036 --> 00:59:00,037
Goodness.

1027
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:05,000
You're so knowledgeable
when it comes to beauty.

1028
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:07,252
No wonder you're so beautiful.

1029
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,047
-Yes, of course.
-Right you are.

1030
00:59:10,130 --> 00:59:11,006
Who are you?

1031
00:59:12,340 --> 00:59:13,800
Why do you talk like that?

1032
00:59:14,593 --> 00:59:16,178
Special missions, down South.

1033
00:59:19,639 --> 00:59:21,975
If that's true,

1034
00:59:22,267 --> 00:59:24,561
you must know a lot about this product.

1035
00:59:24,644 --> 00:59:27,647
Of course, I should know
better than anyone.

1036
00:59:28,690 --> 00:59:29,733
I'd like one.

1037
00:59:29,816 --> 00:59:31,151
Okay.

1038
00:59:31,485 --> 00:59:32,819
It's my treat.

1039
00:59:32,903 --> 00:59:35,113
-No, let me.
-No, it's okay.

1040
00:59:35,197 --> 00:59:36,031
Excuse me.

1041
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:39,701
This product is known for its moisturizing
and glossy effects,

1042
00:59:39,785 --> 00:59:41,495
-so you should emphasize them.
-What?

1043
00:59:41,578 --> 00:59:45,457
And as a seller, don't you think
memorizing the ingredients is a must?

1044
00:59:45,999 --> 00:59:48,001
-I'm sorry.
-Make sure you remember this.

1045
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:51,296
And it isn't 15 million.

1046
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,424
20 million bottles were sold.

1047
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,177
Do you know how rare it is

1048
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,970
to die from paragliding in Korea?

1049
00:59:59,054 --> 01:00:02,432
Since our country is full of forests,
you'd only suffer fractures or bruises.

1050
01:00:02,516 --> 01:00:04,851
You should go to the sauna
and shave as well.

1051
01:00:04,935 --> 01:00:07,187
Our country has the fourth most forests
in the world.

1052
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:09,940
There are forests everywhere
even on deserted islands.

1053
01:00:10,023 --> 01:00:11,316
Even the DMZ has a forest.

1054
01:00:11,441 --> 01:00:13,485
Hey! How dare you?

1055
01:00:13,568 --> 01:00:17,197
Are you saying
that she could've fallen there?

1056
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:19,074
Who knows? It's not that far away.

1057
01:00:19,157 --> 01:00:20,742
Stop getting so close.

1058
01:00:20,826 --> 01:00:23,703
If that's the case,
the NIS would've told us.

1059
01:00:23,787 --> 01:00:26,331
Perhaps, she's suffering from memory loss

1060
01:00:26,414 --> 01:00:28,291
after the fall.

1061
01:00:28,375 --> 01:00:30,127
Or maybe she's stepped on a mine,

1062
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:31,378
and doesn't dare move at all.

1063
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,505
Make sure you take a shower.
You stink so much.

1064
01:00:33,588 --> 01:00:36,508
Most importantly, they could find
neither the equipment nor her body--

1065
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,389
MYUNGJI INSURANCE
PARK SU-CHAN

1066
01:00:47,853 --> 01:00:50,188
So Ewa Wi...

1067
01:00:50,272 --> 01:00:51,857
Wiśniewska, sir.

1068
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:55,318
Yes, her. Taking her,

1069
01:00:55,402 --> 01:00:58,780
the wind speed, and the direction
of the wind on that day,

1070
01:00:58,864 --> 01:01:00,532
you think we should search

1071
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,034
the islands on the northwest or the DMZ?

1072
01:01:03,118 --> 01:01:04,244
That is correct.

1073
01:01:05,871 --> 01:01:08,999
I was very hesitant
to tell you about this.

1074
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:10,876
-What is it?
-On that day,

1075
01:01:10,959 --> 01:01:12,752
she said something to me.

1076
01:01:12,836 --> 01:01:15,714
I'm in a rush
because I need to climb someplace.

1077
01:01:15,797 --> 01:01:17,174
"Climb"? Where?

1078
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,427
High up.

1079
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,429
Back then, I didn't know what she meant.

1080
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:25,182
But after thinking about what he said,

1081
01:01:25,265 --> 01:01:27,392
perhaps, "high up" means--

1082
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,894
The North.

1083
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:31,271
Why didn't you mention that sooner?

1084
01:01:31,980 --> 01:01:33,481
It all makes sense now.

1085
01:01:33,565 --> 01:01:37,277
Are you saying she fled to the North?

1086
01:01:37,861 --> 01:01:40,197
No, sir. That's not what I mean.

1087
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:44,993
I feel like she foresaw what would happen.

1088
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,328
-Forget it.
-Okay.

1089
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,997
-Mr. Park.
-Yes?

1090
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:52,042
I know the hefty insurance cost
has put you in a pickle.

1091
01:01:52,125 --> 01:01:54,669
But as her brother, I cannot condone

1092
01:01:54,753 --> 01:01:57,672
your spreading of groundless rumors.

1093
01:01:57,839 --> 01:01:59,674
If this happens again,

1094
01:01:59,925 --> 01:02:02,886
our corporation lawyer
will be there to greet you.

1095
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:05,388
-Sorry?
-If that happens,

1096
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:08,516
getting fired won't be the end of it.

1097
01:02:09,601 --> 01:02:12,395
My husband and I came here

1098
01:02:12,687 --> 01:02:14,147
in our family's stead.

1099
01:02:15,315 --> 01:02:18,193
We must prepare ourselves
for future possibilities.

1100
01:02:18,360 --> 01:02:19,486
I'd like to see

1101
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,322
the financial statements
for Seri's Choice.

1102
01:02:23,073 --> 01:02:24,241
Where is it?

1103
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,335
You look very experienced.

1104
01:02:35,418 --> 01:02:37,921
I enjoyed clay shooting
when I was in the South.

1105
01:02:39,089 --> 01:02:41,091
Be careful what you say.

1106
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:44,010
I told you not to mention the South.

1107
01:02:45,512 --> 01:02:48,473
Mr. Cheon, are you going to give me
10,000 dollars?

1108
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,226
I told you not to nag.

1109
01:02:51,351 --> 01:02:53,561
You've changed your identity
using the diplomat passport,

1110
01:02:53,645 --> 01:02:54,980
but this is still North Korea.

1111
01:02:55,063 --> 01:02:58,149
If this gets caught,
many people will go down.

1112
01:02:58,233 --> 01:03:01,236
Gosh, I get it.

1113
01:03:01,319 --> 01:03:02,737
Even that dog gets it.

1114
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:06,032
Good boy. Come. Let's go.

1115
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:07,575
Run, run, run!

1116
01:03:07,659 --> 01:03:08,910
Good boy!

1117
01:03:09,703 --> 01:03:12,247
Could you make some <i>naengmyeon</i>

1118
01:03:12,330 --> 01:03:13,748
with the pheasant I hunted?

1119
01:03:13,832 --> 01:03:16,584
I heard pheasant meat is a must
when making Pyongyang <i>naengmyeon</i>.

1120
01:03:16,668 --> 01:03:17,752
I said--

1121
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,379
I bet it'll be tasty.

1122
01:03:24,759 --> 01:03:26,177
Hurry up!

1123
01:03:26,261 --> 01:03:27,387
KAESONG STATION

1124
01:03:41,568 --> 01:03:42,652
We have tangerines.

1125
01:03:42,736 --> 01:03:43,737
Ma'am.

1126
01:03:44,529 --> 01:03:45,947
Would you like a ride?

1127
01:03:47,032 --> 01:03:48,992
-Next car, headed to Bongdong!
-All aboard.

1128
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:50,702
Get the luggage up here.

1129
01:03:51,786 --> 01:03:53,371
All aboard!

1130
01:03:53,455 --> 01:03:55,790
-All aboard!
-Headed to Bongdong.

1131
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,169
Where's your destination?

1132
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:04,674
This is too far at the end.

1133
01:04:05,133 --> 01:04:07,177
I won't be able to pick up any customers.
I'm sorry.

1134
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,390
No, more money won't do.

1135
01:04:12,474 --> 01:04:14,267
The roads are so rocky as well.

1136
01:04:21,066 --> 01:04:22,317
I really can't.

1137
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,947
Try a bit harder.

1138
01:04:32,327 --> 01:04:33,536
Please get in.

1139
01:04:43,546 --> 01:04:47,133
DRIVING

1140
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:51,179
<i>Taehongdan potatoes are round</i>

1141
01:04:51,262 --> 01:04:54,682
<i>They're so big that you can't finish one</i>

1142
01:04:54,766 --> 01:04:57,268
<i>Ya-ha!</i>

1143
01:04:57,644 --> 01:05:01,064
<i>Potatoes, potatoes, Taehongdan potatoes</i>

1144
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:04,692
<i>I love them so much</i>

1145
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:06,486
<i>You can't finish them</i>

1146
01:05:49,696 --> 01:05:51,322
What's wrong with this?

1147
01:05:53,950 --> 01:05:56,161
It's sundown soon. What should I do?

1148
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,204
Do you need a cell phone?

1149
01:05:58,288 --> 01:05:59,831
Yes, please.

1150
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:08,131
Why isn't this working?

1151
01:06:08,214 --> 01:06:09,466
Are we too high up?

1152
01:06:10,592 --> 01:06:12,051
Then what should we do?

1153
01:06:12,427 --> 01:06:13,344
Here.

1154
01:06:13,845 --> 01:06:16,848
There's a village about 10 <i>li</i> from here.

1155
01:06:16,973 --> 01:06:19,058
I'll have to ask them for help.

1156
01:06:19,142 --> 01:06:20,226
Wait here.

1157
01:06:20,310 --> 01:06:21,644
Hold on...

1158
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:28,234
Oh, dear.

1159
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,445
I forgot my key.

1160
01:06:30,528 --> 01:06:31,696
Wait a minute...

1161
01:06:57,972 --> 01:06:59,849
-What?
-Come on.

1162
01:06:59,933 --> 01:07:01,559
It seems like the car broke down.

1163
01:07:01,643 --> 01:07:03,520
It's dangerous for a woman
to be out here alone.

1164
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:06,773
Let's just go.

1165
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,734
If we take her,
she might suspect something.

1166
01:07:09,817 --> 01:07:11,110
Come on, now.

1167
01:07:11,194 --> 01:07:13,279
How could you be so inhumane?

1168
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:16,407
Go back. Back.

1169
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:24,666
Where's your destination?

1170
01:07:24,749 --> 01:07:27,085
The front-line military village.

1171
01:07:28,336 --> 01:07:29,921
We're not going that far.

1172
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:33,633
Would it be okay if we dropped you midway?

1173
01:07:34,133 --> 01:07:35,176
Uncle, please.

1174
01:07:36,010 --> 01:07:39,222
What's the harm in taking a little detour?

1175
01:07:40,473 --> 01:07:41,849
Don't you worry.

1176
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:45,395
We'll make sure you get there
safe and sound.

1177
01:07:46,145 --> 01:07:47,480
Thank you.

1178
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:51,234
By the way, haven't we met?

1179
01:07:51,818 --> 01:07:52,902
No.

1180
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,197
You looked familiar.

1181
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:59,200
May I ask why you're going there?

1182
01:07:59,284 --> 01:08:00,493
No.

1183
01:08:01,953 --> 01:08:02,954
I see.

1184
01:08:04,914 --> 01:08:07,083
I guess I can't.

1185
01:08:08,835 --> 01:08:09,961
Come take a look!

1186
01:08:10,044 --> 01:08:10,920
Mother!

1187
01:08:11,671 --> 01:08:13,798
Come to the dumpling store!

1188
01:08:14,048 --> 01:08:17,302
-Hurry up!
-Come take a look!

1189
01:08:17,385 --> 01:08:20,555
Why are there no street lights?

1190
01:08:20,638 --> 01:08:23,391
-Have some dumplings!
-Come take a look!

1191
01:08:23,474 --> 01:08:25,518
-Try this!
-Welcome!

1192
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:26,811
Yeong Ae.

1193
01:08:27,937 --> 01:08:29,188
Yeong Ae.

1194
01:08:29,647 --> 01:08:31,441
-What?
-Come here.

1195
01:08:31,524 --> 01:08:33,234
Where did they go?

1196
01:08:33,318 --> 01:08:34,569
Where are you?

1197
01:08:34,652 --> 01:08:35,737
Buy the rest.

1198
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:37,196
-Mother.
-Here.

1199
01:08:43,411 --> 01:08:45,955
-Yes?
-<i>So I looked into it.</i>

1200
01:08:46,414 --> 01:08:48,291
-Okay.
-<i>In the past three years,</i>

1201
01:08:48,374 --> 01:08:51,711
<i>there has been no woman that age
from Division 11.</i>

1202
01:08:51,878 --> 01:08:53,087
Is that so?

1203
01:08:53,171 --> 01:08:55,006
<i>Recently, there has been one.</i>

1204
01:08:55,089 --> 01:08:58,092
<i>But she's in her mid-50s, and I know her.</i>

1205
01:08:58,676 --> 01:08:59,927
<i>Other than her, there's no one.</i>

1206
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,222
I see. Thank you.

1207
01:09:03,890 --> 01:09:07,518
I'll make sure to repay this kindness
through Mr. Choe.

1208
01:09:08,603 --> 01:09:09,604
Goodbye.

1209
01:09:24,035 --> 01:09:25,244
Jeong Hyeok!

1210
01:09:25,328 --> 01:09:26,162
Jeong Hyeok!

1211
01:09:26,996 --> 01:09:30,375
We were looking for you.

1212
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:33,044
-Sorry?
-About your fiancée,

1213
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:35,463
we went to the marketplace together,
but she disappeared.

1214
01:09:35,546 --> 01:09:37,048
She disappeared?

1215
01:09:37,131 --> 01:09:39,175
She was with us the entire time.

1216
01:09:39,759 --> 01:09:42,595
But then, she suddenly disappeared.

1217
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:45,264
It was getting dark,
but we couldn't find her so--

1218
01:09:48,643 --> 01:09:49,560
Did he

1219
01:09:50,561 --> 01:09:51,896
just dash off

1220
01:09:52,438 --> 01:09:55,400
to find Sam Suk?

1221
01:09:55,483 --> 01:09:56,776
I think so.

1222
01:09:57,527 --> 01:10:00,947
He raced off to look for her,

1223
01:10:01,656 --> 01:10:03,950
but why is my heart racing along with him?

1224
01:10:06,661 --> 01:10:07,787
Stop it.

1225
01:10:11,416 --> 01:10:13,626
Have some dumplings!

1226
01:10:14,335 --> 01:10:16,170
Try some!

1227
01:10:16,254 --> 01:10:17,714
You can take two.

1228
01:10:17,797 --> 01:10:19,590
Have some of this.

1229
01:10:19,674 --> 01:10:22,885
Have the rest. Just take the rest.

1230
01:10:23,761 --> 01:10:24,971
Buy some!

1231
01:10:33,354 --> 01:10:34,188
<i>One.</i>

1232
01:10:36,149 --> 01:10:37,275
Two.

1233
01:10:38,985 --> 01:10:40,111
Three.

1234
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:42,947
<i>Four.</i>

1235
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:46,617
<i>Five.</i>

1236
01:10:48,161 --> 01:10:49,620
-<i>Six</i>.
-Six.

1237
01:10:50,621 --> 01:10:52,373
-<i>Seven</i>.
-Seven.

1238
01:10:52,832 --> 01:10:54,083
<i>Eight.</i>

1239
01:10:55,668 --> 01:10:56,711
<i>Nine.</i>

1240
01:10:58,129 --> 01:10:59,172
<i>Ten.</i>

1241
01:11:01,132 --> 01:11:02,133
<i>Eleven.</i>

1242
01:11:03,176 --> 01:11:05,553
Have some!

1243
01:11:05,636 --> 01:11:07,972
-Do you need help?
-They're cheap.

1244
01:11:08,055 --> 01:11:10,558
-Have some.
-Hey!

1245
01:11:10,641 --> 01:11:13,853
-Hurry up.
-You can take two.

1246
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,522
-Try one.
-Come.

1247
01:11:16,731 --> 01:11:18,941
-Have some.
-Hurry up.

1248
01:11:19,025 --> 01:11:21,068
Try some.

1249
01:11:21,152 --> 01:11:22,320
-Here.
-Come here.

1250
01:11:22,403 --> 01:11:24,739
-Try some.
-Try some.

1251
01:11:24,822 --> 01:11:28,159
-Come on.
-Try some of this.

1252
01:11:37,668 --> 01:11:38,628
Is this it?

1253
01:11:42,757 --> 01:11:43,633
It's over there.

1254
01:11:43,716 --> 01:11:45,092
Okay.

1255
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:53,184
-Here.
-Come here.

1256
01:11:53,267 --> 01:11:55,895
-Try some.
-Come.

1257
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:58,689
-Come on.
-Try some of this.

1258
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:12,305
This time,

1259
01:13:13,306 --> 01:13:14,932
it's not just a candle but a scented one.

1260
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,476
Right?

1261
01:13:20,855 --> 01:13:21,939
Yes.

1262
01:15:23,352 --> 01:15:24,437
I am

1263
01:15:25,938 --> 01:15:29,191
on top of a bridge in Sigriswil.

1264
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,612
I have no regrets.

1265
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:35,322
Dad,

1266
01:15:36,574 --> 01:15:37,867
Se-jun,

1267
01:15:38,576 --> 01:15:39,994
Se-hyeong,

1268
01:15:41,037 --> 01:15:41,954
and...

1269
01:15:42,663 --> 01:15:43,664
Mom.

1270
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:47,293
I'm going far away.

1271
01:15:48,044 --> 01:15:50,588
Don't live too happily, though.

1272
01:15:51,505 --> 01:15:53,215
Every now and then,

1273
01:15:54,842 --> 01:15:56,510
do think of me.

1274
01:16:12,902 --> 01:16:15,112
Are you going to keep taking photos
of the scenery?

1275
01:16:18,741 --> 01:16:21,827
Your father told me

1276
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,662
that during this trip,

1277
01:16:25,873 --> 01:16:26,957
we ought to get closer.

1278
01:16:27,041 --> 01:16:29,752
Right. I did hear that as well.

1279
01:16:30,127 --> 01:16:32,296
But it's difficult to do so
after a single encounter.

1280
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,464
I agree.

1281
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:37,301
But for your father's sake,

1282
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:40,679
shouldn't we at least take
a photo together?

1283
01:16:41,263 --> 01:16:43,224
You're right. One minute.

1284
01:16:47,853 --> 01:16:49,479
-Excuse Me?
-What?

1285
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:54,026
Could you take a picture of us?

1286
01:16:57,738 --> 01:17:00,407
Okay. Give me the camera.

1287
01:17:03,285 --> 01:17:05,078
But it's so scary here.

1288
01:17:05,162 --> 01:17:06,955
Does it have to be here and now?

1289
01:17:07,540 --> 01:17:08,457
They're gone already?

1290
01:17:09,917 --> 01:17:11,168
My goodness.

1291
01:17:28,602 --> 01:17:30,271
He could do much better.

1292
01:17:39,704 --> 01:17:42,071
CRASH LANDING ON YOU

1293
01:17:42,533 --> 01:17:44,160
Flustered? Who? Me?

1294
01:17:44,243 --> 01:17:45,953
-I have a woman in my life.
-What?

1295
01:17:46,954 --> 01:17:48,289
<i>I'm so embarrassed.</i>

1296
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,374
Have you been dumped by him?

1297
01:17:50,457 --> 01:17:52,877
<i>If he got engaged to someone else
when he was already engaged,</i>

1298
01:17:52,960 --> 01:17:55,754
<i>you ought to break his neck.</i>

1299
01:17:55,838 --> 01:17:58,215
<i>You look like you could go against
the hot bitch of Pyongyang.</i>

1300
01:17:58,299 --> 01:17:59,633
I have an appointment.

1301
01:17:59,717 --> 01:18:02,887
I don't have to get all dolled up
to put her in her place.

1302
01:18:02,970 --> 01:18:04,889
<i>Where did you see her?</i>

1303
01:18:05,306 --> 01:18:07,808
<i>If you're curious about me,
ask me instead.</i>

1304
01:18:07,892 --> 01:18:09,560
<i>I wish you could be happy</i>

1305
01:18:09,643 --> 01:18:11,979
<i>even after I leave, Jeong Hyeok.</i>
