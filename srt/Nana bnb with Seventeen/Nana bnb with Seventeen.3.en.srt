177
00:08:02,422 --> 00:08:04,392
Wow, it's so good
[Can't help but be in awe]

178
00:08:04,393 --> 00:08:06,320
It tastes like something my mom would make!

179
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,911
Because it's a labor of love!

180
00:08:07,912 --> 00:08:09,467
Gomtang requires a lot of effort
[Gomtang made more special
because it's lovingly prepared]

181
00:08:10,315 --> 00:08:12,385
Yes, my mom used to make this for me

182
00:08:12,386 --> 00:08:13,660
I like this flavor as is

183
00:08:18,398 --> 00:08:23,204
Wow, we wouldn't be having gomtang
with a view of the mountains in Seoul...

184
00:08:23,582 --> 00:08:25,565
Yesterday, I saw water deer jumping around

185
00:08:25,566 --> 00:08:26,389
Really?

[Happiness they can enjoy
because they're here together]

187
00:08:28,282 --> 00:08:29,261

188
00:08:29,262 --> 00:08:31,116
Do you think we can even get one right?

189
00:08:31,574 --> 00:08:33,569

[Soon, they will be doing
the random play dance here]

192
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:39,690

"Winning and losing things is a side issue"

194
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:46,529
-"We just want it to look cool"
-Yes, we need a cool moment

195
00:08:46,530 --> 00:08:48,564
That's our staff's big dream
[Ambitious]

196
00:08:48,707 --> 00:08:50,324
To do that, you should be
teaching the choreography

197
00:08:50,325 --> 00:08:52,690
We need to be memorizing
the choreography right now!

198

[Top-quality sports-grade

[Random play dance]

199
00:08:56,789 --> 00:08:59,105
I don't think we can do this!

200
00:08:59,315 --> 00:09:01,675
Even when we do concerts now
we have to relearn everything!

201
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,951
We don't remember any of it!

202

203

204
00:09:08,507 --> 00:09:10,459

[SEVENTEEN's cover team looks
an awful lot like SEVENTEEN]

205
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:12,775
I just did a survey right now

206
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:15,345
I don't think they could do it
even if they watched Y**Tube

207
00:09:15,585 --> 00:09:17,202
(PD NA) They said they might have a shot at it

208
00:09:17,203 --> 00:09:18,551
(PD NA) if they can stand in one place!

209
00:09:18,801 --> 00:09:20,862
(PD NA) But the.. What do you call them?

210
00:09:20,863 --> 00:09:22,352
The formations! The formations!

211
00:09:22,994 --> 00:09:25,603
The problem right now is
[They talked about this in detail
during "Chattering with Nah"]

212
00:09:25,604 --> 00:09:26,976
We have a lot of members, right?

213
00:09:26,977 --> 00:09:29,212
-So, for us
-Our team's biggest problem
[Standard default is 13]

214
00:09:29,432 --> 00:09:31,672
When JUN was filming his movie
[Up until recently]

215
00:09:31,673 --> 00:09:34,162
We worked on formations
without JUN and JEONGHAN
[Practiced the version without them]

216
00:09:34,306 --> 00:09:35,267
And now, JUN is back

217
00:09:35,268 --> 00:09:36,599
But WONWOO is leaving
[Now, WONWOO will be leaving]

218
00:09:36,782 --> 00:09:37,987
So, we have to change our formations again

219
00:09:37,988 --> 00:09:39,229
And it's really confusing!

220
00:09:39,353 --> 00:09:41,507
-We have to fill those empty spaces
-We have to practice that

221
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,337
People who see it don't know
but it's hard for us

222
00:09:43,338 --> 00:09:43,980
But

223
00:09:43,981 --> 00:09:45,820
It may not look like a lot
[The formation changes aren't small]

224
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:48,376
A few members completely
change what they do

225
00:09:48,377 --> 00:09:49,739
Like going from the far
right to the far left...!

226
00:09:49,939 --> 00:09:51,144
Then, it's like a new song!

227
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:53,925
A lot of us think of it as a new song
[Learning from the start
like it's a new song]

228
00:09:54,162 --> 00:09:55,584
So we just memorize it for that moment

229
00:09:55,585 --> 00:09:56,472
and we forget it!

230
00:09:56,473 --> 00:09:57,710
We learn it and forget it!

231
00:09:57,711 --> 00:09:59,430
(STAFF) That's why that incident (?)
happened during the random play dance!

232
00:09:59,431 --> 00:10:00,068
Yes

233
00:10:00,069 --> 00:10:01,860
-Because the versions
-Yes, yes

234

are the version for 13, 12, 11, 10

235

-There are too many
-But within those versions

[Dozens of these]
[Choreography practice_final_final_final.igo]

239
00:10:14,894 --> 00:10:17,480
It's like we have different formations
for every performance we do

240
00:10:17,832 --> 00:10:19,768
So, our team is always practicing

241

-We practice so much
-We really do

in their 11th year]

245

But that's our fate...
[SEVENTEEN's fate...!]

246

what the original version is]

-You said to stir it...!
-What are you doing, SEUNGKWAN?
[Has a lot to say]

1745
01:09:56,355 --> 01:09:57,448
We told you so many times to add it in!
