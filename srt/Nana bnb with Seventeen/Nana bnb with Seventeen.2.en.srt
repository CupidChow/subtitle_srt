01:06:44,780 --> 01:06:46,543
SEUNGKWAN, hurry up

1989
01:06:46,558 --> 01:06:49,022
-What's certain is that
the pitcher's in big trouble!
-That's right, that's right

1990
01:06:49,037 --> 01:06:50,685
-Big trouble
-Totally
[Whatever the case, lots of points given]

1991
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:52,767
He'd have to step down early
[A nightmare of a game
for the other team's pitcher]

1992
01:06:53,413 --> 01:06:55,127
The answer is
[What will the answer be?]

1993
01:06:55,444 --> 01:06:56,984
-Six points!
-Yes!

1994
01:06:56,999 --> 01:06:58,592
Hey, I'm glad I changed it, wow

1995
01:06:58,607 --> 01:07:01,206
-Six points!
-No, no, no!

1996
01:07:01,221 --> 01:07:02,995
-Gym, wrong
-No, no, no!
[Requesting a time out]

1997
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:04,932
Time out, we object

1998
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:05,784
It's seven points

1999
01:07:05,799 --> 01:07:07,192
-It's seven points?
-Why is it seven?

2000
01:07:07,207 --> 01:07:08,871
When the song starts
[Home run]

2001
01:07:08,886 --> 01:07:11,887
You start with a shout of "Home run!"

2002
01:07:11,902 --> 01:07:15,089
[Home ruuun]

2003
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:17,848
[That's how the song starts]

2004
01:07:18,452 --> 01:07:20,728
[So, before answers were submitted...]

2005
01:07:22,251 --> 01:07:23,782
At the start of the song...

2006
01:07:23,797 --> 01:07:25,815
Don't we count the "Home run" there?

2007
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:28,712
Hey

2008
01:07:28,727 --> 01:07:31,571
[A hidden home run
that no one thought about]

2009
01:07:31,819 --> 01:07:33,906
Would that count as part of the lyrics?

2010
01:07:33,921 --> 01:07:36,192
I think it counts

2011
01:07:36,547 --> 01:07:39,260
[Ended up changing to seven points]

2012
01:07:39,588 --> 01:07:41,313
[Something they hadn't thought of]

2013
01:07:41,328 --> 01:07:43,251
Count that to make seven points, look
[Seven points including that home run]

2014
01:07:43,836 --> 01:07:46,353
-But it's not in the official lyrics
-No, but

2015
01:07:46,587 --> 01:07:48,035
[In the lyrics of "HOME;RUN"]

2016
01:07:48,050 --> 01:07:50,347
[The first "Home run" is not included]

2017
01:07:50,713 --> 01:07:53,298
[That is why people have usually
counted it as six points...]

2018
01:07:53,313 --> 01:07:54,446
-Now
-Hear him out
[But]

2019
01:07:54,461 --> 01:07:56,222
I wrote this song

2020
01:07:56,326 --> 01:07:57,936
You should have added it!
[He's here in person]

2021
01:07:57,952 --> 01:07:59,998
WOOZI is listed first in the credits
[Proof: Composed by WOOZI, BUMZU, Nmore]
[Written by WOOZI, BUMZU, VERNON, SEUNGKWAN]

2022
01:08:00,013 --> 01:08:02,644
"Two outs, bottom of the ninth
But still holding onto the bat"
[Listening to WOOZI's analysis]

2023
01:08:02,659 --> 01:08:03,552
This is the batter, right?

2024
01:08:03,567 --> 01:08:04,954
"Don't step back..." I'm in big trouble
[Batter is in big trouble]

2025
01:08:04,969 --> 01:08:06,787
I have to win the game

2026
01:08:06,802 --> 01:08:08,678
I haven't swung yet, but I will!

2027
01:08:08,693 --> 01:08:11,428
I'm hyping myself up
"I'm going now"

2028
01:08:11,443 --> 01:08:12,680
Yes, you haven't gone yet
[Haven't hit the ball yet
Just getting ready]

2029
01:08:12,947 --> 01:08:14,604
I tried to hit a home run

2030
01:08:14,619 --> 01:08:17,287
-And it was that
-A hit to third base

2031
01:08:17,303 --> 01:08:19,940
-A hit to third base
-A base on balls or something

2032
01:08:19,955 --> 01:08:21,755
-And I get to third base
-Yes, yes, yes

2033
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,460
-I get to third base
-No home run yet

2034
01:08:23,475 --> 01:08:25,907
Keep going until a home run

2035
01:08:25,922 --> 01:08:27,551
That's two points now

2036
01:08:27,566 --> 01:08:28,392
Two points

2037
01:08:28,407 --> 01:08:30,063
And three points with the home run, right?

2038
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,629
Four points

2039
01:08:31,989 --> 01:08:33,065
Five points

2040
01:08:33,080 --> 01:08:35,700
And at the end, six points?

2041
01:08:35,715 --> 01:08:36,955
So, people think this is six points

2042
01:08:36,970 --> 01:08:39,218
-However, at the start of this song!
-"Home run"

2043
01:08:39,588 --> 01:08:42,028
It starts with "Home run"!

2044
01:08:42,044 --> 01:08:46,004
You're at the bottom of the ninth inning
with one point already scored!

2045
01:08:46,019 --> 01:08:47,294
If you say that

2046
01:08:47,309 --> 01:08:49,750
You're not done after the last "Home run"

2047
01:08:49,765 --> 01:08:52,120
-So it would be plus alpha, right?
-No, no

2048
01:08:52,135 --> 01:08:54,459
You never know, you could score more!
[Alpha...?]

2049
01:08:54,474 --> 01:08:55,656
If it's plus alpha

2050
01:08:55,671 --> 01:08:57,276
Wouldn't that be an "a"?
[+α]

2051
01:08:57,291 --> 01:08:58,593
What's this?

2052
01:08:58,608 --> 01:09:00,362
Oh, is this dividing by N?

2053
01:09:00,377 --> 01:09:02,482
Isn't it usually "a" for alpha?
[It's okay]

2054
01:09:02,786 --> 01:09:05,714
[As long as you grew up healthy]

2055
01:09:06,164 --> 01:09:09,839
I believe creator WOOZI is fooling himself

2056
01:09:10,104 --> 01:09:12,300
-No! No!
-I believe it's only six points

2057
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,024
But I wrote this song!

2058
01:09:14,039 --> 01:09:15,204
Think about it

2059
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:16,505
Think about it, look!

2060
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:17,879
Think about it
[Think about it, WOOZI]

2061
01:09:17,894 --> 01:09:20,198
If you had put it in parentheses

2062
01:09:20,213 --> 01:09:22,914
Like "Home run"
[If only it had been included...!]

2063
01:09:22,929 --> 01:09:24,363
-If it had been in the lyrics?
-It wasn't included

2064
01:09:24,378 --> 01:09:25,720
Because it's not in the official lyrics
[Six points, as it's not included]

2065
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:28,460
-It's okay
-No, this is right!

2066
01:09:28,775 --> 01:09:32,059
[Real time]
[Being denied his child]

2067
01:09:32,326 --> 01:09:33,767
But it's definitely not five, right?
[Amidst all of this]

2068
01:09:33,782 --> 01:09:35,056
It's not five

2069
01:09:35,071 --> 01:09:36,698
-It's not five
-Of course...

2070
01:09:36,713 --> 01:09:38,312
Of course not!

2071
01:09:38,448 --> 01:09:40,711
-It's not five
-It's not five, is it?
[Five points, go over there]

2072
01:09:40,726 --> 01:09:42,323
-But this
-Plus alpha...

2073
01:09:42,338 --> 01:09:46,061
(SEUNGKWAN) When we
solve math questions...

2074
01:09:46,076 --> 01:09:49,001
The teachers will take multiple answers
[Multiple answers taken sometimes]

2075
01:09:49,016 --> 01:09:50,669
So, multiple answers?
[Take both six and seven points?]

2076
01:09:50,878 --> 01:09:54,070
(Mr. NA) If WOOZI says it's seven points

2077
01:09:54,085 --> 01:09:55,812
(Mr. NA) That's his prerogative
as the composer

2078
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:57,844
So, we'll accept it

2079
01:09:57,859 --> 01:10:00,161
But I'm sure you believe
it's really six points
[I think it's six points]

2080
01:10:00,788 --> 01:10:02,182
No way

2081
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:05,682
I'm sorry, but aren't
we free to interpret it?

2082
01:10:05,697 --> 01:10:08,310
-Like he has freedom as the creator!
-(Mr. NA) It's already out in the world!

2083
01:10:08,596 --> 01:10:10,225
[Okay, fine]

2084
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,812
I also think it's six points
[Accepting both six and seven points]

2085
01:10:11,827 --> 01:10:13,391
I will celebrate six points as well

2086
01:10:13,406 --> 01:10:14,694
[A peaceful ending for everyone (?)]

2087
01:10:14,709 --> 01:10:16,886
-That was fun
-So close

2088
01:10:16,902 --> 01:10:19,974
Because he wrote six and crossed it out
[Remnants of indecision]

2089
01:10:20,096 --> 01:10:20,933
I thought it was six at first

2090
01:10:20,948 --> 01:10:23,859
but "Oh? The song starts with 'Home run'"
[It could be seven!]

2091
01:10:24,144 --> 01:10:26,414
I get that way of thinking
because that's how the song starts
[Can be left up to interpretation]

2092
01:10:26,700 --> 01:10:29,142
That's what music is about
[Music can be expressed and
interpreted in different ways...!]

2093
01:10:29,157 --> 01:10:30,971
Other than Yuanyangguo
[Aside from Yuanyangguo and their five]

2094
01:10:30,986 --> 01:10:32,661
-Everyone gets points
-Thank you
[Every other team scores!]

2095
01:10:32,676 --> 01:10:33,585
Nice
[+50]

2096
01:10:33,600 --> 01:10:35,456
[The end of the scholarship quiz]

2097
01:10:35,542 --> 01:10:37,825
Great job, everyone
[What a long journey]

2098
01:10:39,176 --> 01:10:41,274
You were the ace!

2099
01:10:41,289 --> 01:10:42,955
Wow, VERNON did great
[Unmatched skills]

2100
01:10:42,970 --> 01:10:44,774
VERNON did so well!

2101
01:10:44,789 --> 01:10:46,203
So quick on his feet!

2102
01:10:46,218 --> 01:10:48,442
He just knows a lot of things!

2103
01:10:48,457 --> 01:10:50,696
(Mr. NA) Anyway, good job, everyone

2104
01:10:50,711 --> 01:10:52,542
Let's hold the medal ceremony
[Medal ceremony]

2105
01:10:52,557 --> 01:10:54,566
-We'll reveal the scores
-Yes!
[Scores revealed]

01:10:54,581 --> 01:10:55,608
Oh
[Scorecard]

2107
01:10:55,624 --> 01:10:57,060
I think we should announce
last place first

2108
01:10:57,211 --> 01:10:58,714
Last place first...
[The score must be unreal]

2109
01:10:58,729 --> 01:11:00,102
We'll reveal last place first

2110
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:01,308
Who could it be?

2111
01:11:01,323 --> 01:11:04,116
-Who could be in last place?
-I have no idea
[Can't tell at all (?)]

2112
01:11:04,131 --> 01:11:07,328
In last place
[Who has the lowest score?]

[To put it nicely]
[They didn't get the right answers
but tried their best]

[Fifth place, Yuanyangguo]

Congratulations, Yuanyangguo, -240 points
[Got a lot of questions wrong]

2121
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:33,072
It was tight between third and fourth
[Neck-and-neck race for third VS fourth]

01:11:33,220 --> 01:11:35,983
-It was a 10-point difference
-Wow, really?
[Third VS Fourth, just 10 points]

[-110 points VS -100 points]

2124
01:11:40,027 --> 01:11:42,315

-Are we in fourth place?
-We're in fourth place

2148
01:12:28,484 --> 01:12:29,892
They made too many attempts
[It's real]

2149
01:12:29,907 --> 01:12:30,943
Gym! Congratulations!

2150
01:12:30,958 --> 01:12:32,897
[Even Mala Burger is shocked]

2151
01:12:32,912 --> 01:12:34,733
-They made lots of attempts
-Really?

2152
01:12:34,748 --> 01:12:37,303
It's because we made a lot of guesses!

2153
01:12:37,318 --> 01:12:38,297
We got a lot wrong

2154
01:12:38,312 --> 01:12:40,081
VERNON took multiple attempts to answer
[*How the viewers probably look right now]

2155
01:12:40,163 --> 01:12:42,534
-Really?
-Hey! We got first place!
[The sleeping hare has beaten the tortoise]

2156
01:12:42,549 --> 01:12:44,213
-What?
-Wow, what is this?

2157
01:12:44,228 --> 01:12:45,072
What?

2158
01:12:45,087 --> 01:12:47,374
-No, that's a lie!
-No, those were the results

2159
01:12:47,389 --> 01:12:48,509
-Really?
-Those were the results

2160
01:12:48,524 --> 01:12:49,845
[Including questions edited out]
[The math is correct]

2161
01:12:50,197 --> 01:12:52,929
Because they got a lot wrong
[Mala Burger got lots
of answers wrong, too]

2162
01:12:53,129 --> 01:12:55,554
It's because we made lots of attempts

2163
01:12:55,569 --> 01:12:57,059
We got a lot wrong

2164
01:12:57,074 --> 01:12:58,903
VERNON made multiple attempts to answer

2165
01:12:58,918 --> 01:12:59,894
That's right

2166
01:13:00,360 --> 01:13:01,997
-What?
-But they didn't do anything
[Like winning by default]

2167
01:13:02,013 --> 01:13:05,717
Wait!
But he didn't do anything!

2168
01:13:05,732 --> 01:13:07,371
He was half-asleep!

2169
01:13:07,698 --> 01:13:11,293
Not doing anything really...
[Had fun and ended up last]

2170
01:13:11,308 --> 01:13:13,778
-He didn't do anything
-What?
[Learned that life can be unpredictable]

2171
01:13:13,793 --> 01:13:15,749
-Really?
-I got chills

2172
01:13:15,853 --> 01:13:18,326
We'll let it be six points!
[The "HOME;RUN" question]

2173
01:13:18,646 --> 01:13:20,381
It's not seven points, it's six!

2174
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,156
It was originally six!

2175
01:13:22,356 --> 01:13:23,589
-Is it six points?
-No, no, no
[Found an opening]

2176
01:13:23,604 --> 01:13:24,811
-Is it six points?
-No, no, no!

2177
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:25,799
If it's six points

2178
01:13:25,814 --> 01:13:27,624
The rankings will change
[Question worth 50 points]

2179
01:13:28,329 --> 01:13:30,298
Seven points!

2180
01:13:30,313 --> 01:13:32,488
DINO just got the
Voice Talk question right

2181
01:13:32,608 --> 01:13:34,432
-Mala Burger got so many more right
-Exactly

2182
01:13:34,447 --> 01:13:35,852
So many more right

2183
01:13:35,867 --> 01:13:38,327
Due to the fierce competition
they also gave many wrong answers

2184
01:13:39,010 --> 01:13:42,035
(Mr. NA) But Gym basically
slept through the game

2185
01:13:42,050 --> 01:13:44,472
One slept, and the other ate corn
[Corn] [Sleep]

2186
01:13:44,487 --> 01:13:46,630
Can we get a refill?
[I'm still hungry]

2187
01:13:46,645 --> 01:13:48,229
-They should be Sleep!
-Not Gym

2188
01:13:48,244 --> 01:13:49,203
They should be Sleep

2189
01:13:49,218 --> 01:13:50,407
Anyway, as a result
[Two people who loved corn and sleep]

2190
01:13:50,422 --> 01:13:52,525

[First place in the scholarship
quiz with +90 points]

2192

-(S.COUPS) It was a good game
-It was a good game, just 10 points!

2195
01:14:01,144 --> 01:14:03,820
I feel like the two of us
didn't do anything

2196
01:14:03,835 --> 01:14:05,969
Please enjoy the rest of your evening

2197

Gym!
[Wake up from Sleep and become Gym]

2202
01:14:14,345 --> 01:14:16,076
We're a SEVENTEEN cover group
[Next time]

2203
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,403
I don't think we'll
remember the formations

2204
01:14:17,418 --> 01:14:19,128
I don't think we can do this
[What game is making SEVENTEEN nervous?]

2205
01:14:19,144 --> 01:14:21,430
This game is a random play dance

2206
01:14:21,445 --> 01:14:22,917
We'll play all of your title tracks

2207
01:14:22,932 --> 01:14:24,251
This will look pretty cool if we succeed!
[Ten years of SEVENTEEN dances]

Hey, where are you?

2210
01:14:28,351 --> 01:14:29,338
Don't, don't

2211
01:14:29,353 --> 01:14:30,683
That's enough!

2212
01:14:30,698 --> 01:14:31,734
That's enough!

2213
01:14:31,749 --> 01:14:33,186
Hey, we're doomed

2214
01:14:35,188 --> 01:14:37,336
Where do we go? Where?

Do you want to see the stage version?

you get in restaurants
