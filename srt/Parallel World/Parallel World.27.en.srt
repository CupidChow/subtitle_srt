00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,680
=Episode 27=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,500
Ye Liuxi.

4
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:13,860
Can you still fight

5
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:15,540
with a crippled leg?

6
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,380
Aren't you going to see
if your man is still alive or dead?

7
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:20,980
You talk too much nonsense.

8
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,250
You're quite lucky today.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,740
You're still alive.

10
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,140
I'm not going to die now,

11
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,500
and I won't die later.

12
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,060
Chang Dong.

13
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,540
Liuxi.

14
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,780
Ocean Guardian, it's your showtime.

15
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,980
Get him.

16
00:04:58,140 --> 00:04:59,740
Here comes Ocean Guardian.

17
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,460
Qingzhi, don't go.

18
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,340
What's your name?

19
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,980
I'm Ye Liuxi,

20
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,980
like water flowing west.

21
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:01,500
(I told you.)

22
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:03,500
(You will know one day.)

23
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,250
Between the two Lingzhi mushrooms,

24
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:06,940
who's the weed...

25
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,300
Who's the immortal.

26
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:10,940
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

27
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,420
(- Run. Quick.
- Run.)

28
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:28,860
Run.

29
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:41,860
Qingzhi.

30
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:46,140
Take good care of yourself.

31
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,420
Liuxi.

32
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:10,700
Dong.

33
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:24,540
Dong.

34
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,060
Liuxi.

35
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,940
Why are you crying?

36
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:31,980
I don't know.

37
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:32,780
Maybe it's too pain.

38
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:33,740
Quick, get up.

39
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:34,580
Come on.

40
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,460
The snake seems to be moving.

41
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,860
Liuxi, the snake's moving.

42
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,700
Quick.

43
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,180
Quick.

44
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:48,900
Let's go.

45
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,620
What now? Which way?

46
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:09,300
There.

47
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,060
Come on.

48
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,740
This is your only chance

49
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:39,060
to save Ding Liu.

50
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,060
Fire.

51
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:05,100
There are still casualties.

52
00:10:11,180 --> 00:10:11,980
Ocean Guardian.

53
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:14,100
Ocean.

54
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,700
Is there anyone else inside?

55
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:17,460
There's no one left.

56
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,520
We've saved everyone we could.

57
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,700
There was only this rooster.

58
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,780
It's fierce.

59
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,660
Give it to me.

60
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,700
No, I can't do that.

61
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:25,780
I need to let the doctor check it out.

62
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,060
Wait. Please wait.

63
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,340
He.

64
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,180
Where were you?

65
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,940
I've been looking everywhere for you guys.

66
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:24,100
Come on.

67
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:29,100
It's great that you're alive.

68
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,220
Why are you crying?

69
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:42,340
Come with me.

70
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:44,860
Where are we going?

71
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,540
Somebody!

72
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,860
Doctor!

73
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,180
Help!

74
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,060
Let's go and help!

75
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,680
Quick, someone came out!

76
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,000
Quick!

77
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,460
Hurry up!

78
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:32,860
Quick.

79
00:12:32,860 --> 00:12:33,540
What happened?

80
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,100
How is she?

81
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:34,620
Help.

82
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:36,180
Quick, save her.

83
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,340
If the Parasitic Flower blooms,

84
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,540
she won't wake up again.

85
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:41,100
Quick.

86
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:41,980
Carry her into the tent.

87
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,300
Quick.

88
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,740
How are you feeling?

89
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,620
Where are you injured?

90
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,140
Liu.

91
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:52,140
Let me help you up first.

92
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:56,860
Quick!

93
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:57,660
Somebody!

94
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,180
Hurry up!

95
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,180
Gao Shen.

96
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,100
Gao Shen.

97
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:17,660
Gao Shen.

98
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,180
Miss Ye.

99
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,420
Mr. Zhao.

100
00:14:25,220 --> 00:14:26,260
How's your injury?

101
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:27,100
It's fine.

102
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:28,260
I have the Bone of Liuxi in me.

103
00:14:28,260 --> 00:14:29,100
So I'm not that weak.

104
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,060
I recover fast too.

105
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,260
Did you see Jiang Zhan?

106
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:37,860
Did you kill him?

107
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,060
What about the Sheep's Horn Cup?

108
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,020
Is it true that without it,

109
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,540
we can't leave the pass?

110
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:57,380
You all stay here and get healed first.

111
00:14:57,620 --> 00:15:00,380
Once you all feel better, we'll return
to Black Stone City for treatment.

112
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:01,140
After that,

113
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:02,700
we'll discuss leaving the pass.

114
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,600
What about Scorpion Eye's men?

115
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:06,420
Did they escape?

116
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:07,740
They fled.

117
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,780
I must rush back
to Black Stone City now.

118
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,420
Just now, Scorpion Eye disguised as Feather Guards
and made a surprise attack.

119
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,220
I think Black Stone City is in trouble.

120
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:16,740
Alright.

121
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,140
Liuxi.

122
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:24,740
Fatty Tang.

123
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:27,460
- Where are Gao Shen and Liu?
- They're inside.

124
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:28,540
Liuxi.

125
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:32,940
What's wrong?

126
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,340
Thank you for saving me.

127
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:36,860
Listen. My leg hurts.

128
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,200
So, you get up yourself.

129
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,660
I won't bother to help you up.

130
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,500
Can't you be a bit more dignified?

131
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,460
Don't you know men have their pride?

132
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,180
Where's Dong?

133
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,000
The doctor is checking on him.

134
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:55,500
I'll go and take a look.

135
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:28,980
I didn't expect Feather Guards
to suffer such heavy casualties.

136
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,740
(Long Zhi)

137
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,500
But Scorpion Eye's forces
were nearly wiped out.

138
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,740
So it's still worth it.

139
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,740
What do you think?

140
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,500
Long Zhi.

141
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:48,660
You had Scorpion Eye disguise
as Feather Guards.

142
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:51,300
That move was indeed clever.

143
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:52,700
However,

144
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:54,980
you had someone impersonate your father.

145
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,140
Wasn't that too audacious and too much?

146
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,740
Using Shape-Shift Fish to change faces,

147
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,740
even in the sorcerers' tower,

148
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,820
is also a major taboo.

149
00:18:05,620 --> 00:18:07,820
As long as we can successfully
head west to exit Yumen,

150
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:09,900
I have nothing to be cautious about.

151
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:18,880
What about Jiang Zhan?

152
00:18:42,380 --> 00:18:43,060
He's dead.

153
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,320
Now that Jiang Zhan is dead,

154
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:51,300
Scorpion Eye is under our control.

155
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:52,820
From now on,

156
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,700
you are the leader of Scorpion Eye.

157
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,260
In this big chess game
of heading west to exit Yumen,

158
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,930
we've already achieved more than half

159
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:06,820
of our goals step by step.

160
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,060
More than half?

161
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,900
Mr. Zhao.

162
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:17,300
If it weren't for Ye Liuxi taking
the real Sheep's Horn Cup from you,

163
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,020
I could have those people
outside the pass kill her now.

164
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,380
Not even Thiefless could keep it.

165
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:26,140
What could I do?

166
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:28,620
Fine.

167
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,540
There were two Sheep's Horn Cups.

168
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,060
Hers was already shattered.

169
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:36,340
She couldn't open the pass anymore.

170
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,060
She's no longer a threat to us.

171
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,020
Let her live a few more days.

172
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:43,980
Wait until she helps us
get the other Sheep's Horn Cup.

173
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,180
From then on, there will be
no Beast Head revolt inside the pass.

174
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,140
Doctor, how is his condition?

175
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,940
He has two wounds
in his abdomen, injuring his organs.

176
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,020
Although he's temporarily out of danger,

177
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,820
we need to monitor if his wounds

178
00:20:15,820 --> 00:20:16,780
become infected.

179
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,340
You know it as well.

180
00:20:18,340 --> 00:20:19,460
Scorpion Eye's stuff

181
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:21,460
usually carries poison.

182
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,180
Take extra care of him.

183
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:25,340
Let's go.

184
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,060
When Scorpion Eye attacked earlier,

185
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,780
he was still protecting me
with all his might.

186
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,500
How did he suddenly
get injured like this?

187
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,040
What should we do, Liuxi?

188
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:50,780
We'll leave the pass
once his condition stabilizes.

189
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:55,380
What's wrong, He?

190
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,700
He.

191
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:03,620
This is...

192
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,620
The primary tongue is gone.

193
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,980
So the substitute tongue
is also destroyed.

194
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,140
That means Jiang Zhan...

195
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,020
Fatty Tang, look after her.

196
00:21:15,020 --> 00:21:16,140
I'll check on Chang Dong.

197
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:16,860
Alright.

198
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,100
Everything's okay.

199
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,140
What are you doing?

200
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,260
Do you want me
to come over and help you over?

201
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,660
Where's your cane?

202
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:54,060
I don't need it.

203
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,620
I can't keep using a cane forever,
can I?

204
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:57,740
It's okay.

205
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,700
You come to visit a patient

206
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:03,900
yet you don't bring a gift.

207
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:06,380
How about I bring
those two crutches for you?

208
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,540
Sure.

209
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,460
Am I not the gift?

210
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,020
Say, if you have scars in the future,

211
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,940
will you become ugly?

212
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:31,020
I don't mind.

213
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,100
Are you okay?

214
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,420
I'm fine.

215
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
Does it still hurt?

216
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:44,540
Yes.

217
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,700
You seem to be in a bad mood.

218
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:02,100
You can see it?

219
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:05,340
Of course, I can.

220
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,580
As soon as you're in a bad mood,

221
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,780
the air around you changes.

222
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:12,220
I just need to get close to you to feel it.

223
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,980
Tell me.

224
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,620
Jiang Zhan.

225
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,900
I keep thinking

226
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,660
about when he died.

227
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,180
Qingzhi.

228
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,020
Take good care of yourself.

229
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,380
Indeed.

230
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,940
Between then and how he acted before,

231
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:19,220
he's like a different person.

232
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:24,020
Do you suspect

233
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,820
the two of you...

234
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,540
He hated me

235
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,900
and wanted to kill me.

236
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,820
Was it because he was deceived?

237
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,420
Sometimes,

238
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:38,900
the body remembers more than the mind.

239
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:40,700
Just like me.

240
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,900
I don't know why,

241
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,420
but I can smoothly draw

242
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,940
a scorpion's tail on my eye.

243
00:24:49,580 --> 00:24:50,420
I also don't know

244
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:53,460
why I cried,

245
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,380
but I...

246
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,580
I did cry at that time.

247
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:59,220
Are you afraid

248
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,460
of killing someone

249
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,620
you'll regret killing?

250
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:12,780
Yes.

251
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,100
It is possible.

252
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:19,020
But, Liuxi,

253
00:25:20,260 --> 00:25:22,100
what's done is done.

254
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:24,660
Even if the truth comes to light,

255
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:26,220
and you feel agony over it,

256
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,060
it has already happened.

257
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,620
I understand the reasoning.

258
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:33,420
Let me tell you.

259
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,580
I held him
with all my strength at that time

260
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,060
because I believed

261
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:40,660
that he would definitely kill you.

262
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,900
If it weren't for Fatty Tang,

263
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,380
what would have happened?

264
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,540
I can't say for sure.

265
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:47,500
At that time,

266
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,220
if you hadn't killed him,

267
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,060
he would have killed you.

268
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,940
It wasn't just you.

269
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,980
Fatty Tang and I would have been
dead as well.

270
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,940
You can't blame yourself for this.

271
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:13,220
If you keep crying,

272
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:14,780
I'm going to get jealous.

273
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:20,540
I'm not.

274
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,300
Really?

275
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,540
Let me check.

276
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,260
You cry over him.

277
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,300
Is it hurting again?

278
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:37,320
I'll call the doctor.

279
00:26:38,140 --> 00:26:38,580
Don't.

280
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,420
I'm just teasing you.

281
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,660
She's recovering well. Don't worry.

282
00:27:11,060 --> 00:27:12,140
I have to get back to work.

283
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,100
Let's go.

284
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:15,900
Okay.

285
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,580
Our fighters are bedridden,

286
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:39,940
yet we're all uninjured.

287
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,060
Well, in times of crisis,

288
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,780
rely on those who stand tall.

289
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,540
Those who are strong lead glorious lives

290
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:51,860
and also suffer more.

291
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,900
We can only think positively.

292
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,740
Fortunately, everyone is still alive.

293
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,940
Right, He?

294
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:04,940
Don't worry.

295
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:08,180
When we get to Black Stone City, I'll ask
Mr. Zhao for a substitute tongue for you.

296
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,340
You'll be able to speak again.

297
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:51,140
Stay down!

298
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:23,980
Halt!

299
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,260
Everyone else has run away.

300
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,740
Why didn't you run?

301
00:30:47,180 --> 00:30:48,380
You even saved me.

302
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,220
Aren't you scared?

303
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:51,340
I am scared,

304
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,860
but for a sinner like me,

305
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:58,980
no matter where I run to,

306
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,140
I'll be caught.

307
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:03,860
You seem quite capable.

308
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,860
I want you to take me with you.

309
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:07,940
That's why I stayed.

310
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:13,940
What's your name?

311
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,140
I'm Ye Liuxi.

312
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,740
Liuxi,

313
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,860
like water flowing west.

314
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,420
Ye Liuxi.

315
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,620
You sent your precious daughter

316
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:34,140
to infiltrate Scorpion Eye.

317
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:35,900
Long Shen.

318
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,460
How altruistic of you.

319
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,580
(Long Shen)

320
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:40,900
(Long Shen)
If you actually protected Huyang City,

321
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,820
I would not have let Long Zhi

322
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,460
stay with scum.

323
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:54,000

No trespassing nature reserves.)
