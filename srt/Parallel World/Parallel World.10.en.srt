=Parallel World=
(Adapted from the original novel "Parallel World" by Wei Yu)

00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,740
=Episode 10=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

4
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,020
(Seadragon Heap)

5
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,180
There's no signal.

6
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,900
Move your car here later.

7
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,580
Park it sideways to block the wind.

8
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,500
We'll camp here.

9
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,020
Slowly.

10
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,500
Alright.

11
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,100
Why is there no signal?

12
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:12,700
I can't even post on Qzone.

13
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,020
Do you have WiFi?

14
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,860
Yes. Let me look for it.

15
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,220
Gao Shen

16
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,900
must have owed Ding Liu in his past life.

17
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,780
Why does this string go through the neck

18
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,580
and that one goes through the chest?

19
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,700
Aren't all shadow puppets the same?

20
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,660
What's the difference?

21
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,580
This is the female lead.

22
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,620
The string goes behind the chest

23
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,140
to make the curve look good.

24
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,700
As for the male lead,

25
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,100
it is behind the neck

26
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,660
to hold the head high
to be more spirited.

27
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:23,140
What even?

28
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,620
People like to see women
push their chest out, huh.

29
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:30,980
Well, women look better when they do that.

30
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,420
Since I'm sitting here,

31
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,300
she's being shy and staying away.

32
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,820
I'll move for you.

33
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,980
Sure. Thanks.

34
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:54,460
You stay here.

35
00:04:59,180 --> 00:04:59,980
Liuxi.

36
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,620
Is there hot water? I'd like some.

37
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,180
She changed her style again.

38
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:33,020
You remember so well.

39
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,980
I can't forget.

40
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,260
It's only been a while. But look.

41
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:37,540
She's wild one moment
and ladylike the next.

42
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,420
I don't understand young girls nowadays.

43
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,380
Thank you.

44
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:49,020
Liuxi.

45
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,940
What?

46
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,140
I think you should
change your style too.

47
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,060
It would absolutely drive people crazy.

48
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,100
There's a problem.

49
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:17,940
Again?

50
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,300
It's not that easy.

51
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,340
It's a blood supplement.

52
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:34,820
In a moment,

53
00:06:34,820 --> 00:06:36,300
help me knock those two down.

54
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,780
Why?

55
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,460
I'm afraid they'll be injured,
and they're in the way.

56
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,140
Are you not going out ever?

57
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,660
How will you explain it to Liu Qi later?

58
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:53,300
Imagine he gave us money,

59
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:54,900
but his men are knocked down so soon.

60
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,540
What should we do then?

61
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:03,060
Wait for them to leave themselves.

62
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,800
We can't give them the chance
to blame us.

63
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,860
If you ask me, I'd let them in.

64
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,500
If they get scared, that's on them.

65
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,500
They can't blame us.

66
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,140
Besides, Ding Liu has managed
Liu Qi's business for three years.

67
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,420
If she weren't smart,

68
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,660
she couldn't have handled it.

69
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,380
Gao Shen was sent to protect her,

70
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,700
so he can't be weak.

71
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,140
If they're not afraid,

72
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:25,700
we'll have two more helpers then.

73
00:07:27,300 --> 00:07:28,380
In my opinion,

74
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,300
they're just going to be trouble.

75
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,300
You can't have everything go your way.

76
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,420
That's just how the world works.

77
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,420
Dong.

78
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,820
Who do you think

79
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:15,740
this girl is putting on makeup

80
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,460
early in the morning for?

81
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:19,340
There are only a few of us.

82
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:21,100
She doesn't seem to care about Gao Shen.

83
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,580
She doesn't even look at me too.

84
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,660
I'm going to get some food.

85
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,980
So, who is she putting makeup on for?

86
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:29,340
It's normal for young girls
to want to doll up.

87
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,860
Is she doing it for you?

88
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:35,660
Do you have nothing else to do?

89
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,660
She's got plenty of energy
to spare on men.

90
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,540
That's so lame.

91
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:45,060
If it were me,
I'd be having fun ruling the world.

92
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,580
That's awesome.

93
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,180
Alright, let's eat.

94
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,260
It's time to eat.

95
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,540
Got it.

96
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,540
The garlic's peeled.

97
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:04,580
Get a smaller portion for me.

98
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,340
Do we have any plans for today?

99
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:10,300
We'll collect Hui Ba's body
after eating.

100
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,140
Alright.

101
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,700
Now?

102
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,660
It's safer to do things during the day.

103
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,260
That's true.

104
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:22,020
All the bad things happen at night.

105
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,460
(Dong, are we really
going to collect Hui Ba's body?)

106
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,020
(Well, we've been acquainted with him.)

107
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,980
(Collecting the body)

108
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:35,220
(will make it easier
for the police later.)

109
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,420
(That's true.)

110
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:50,860
Liu.

111
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:06,260
Carry him out.

112
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:13,940
Go help.

113
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,900
I can't.

114
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,860
It's finally done.

115
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,980
I'll call Qi in a bit

116
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,820
to ask him to collect the bodies.

117
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,300
What should we do next?

118
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,340
Continue our journey.

119
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,460
Here. One. Two.

120
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,320
(What is the Sima Road?)

121
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:06,030
(It's where
the emperor and empress are buried.)

122
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:08,360
(As soon as you enter,
there will be the Sima Road)

123
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,430
(leading to the mausoleum.)

124
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,150
(If this Sima Road
leads to the mausoleum,)

125
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,720
(then isn't this Yumen Pass)

126
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,550
(a colossal tomb?)

127
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:19,600
(Let's check other earthen platforms)

128
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
(to see if we can find anything else.)

129
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,240
Alright, you two get out first.

130
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,790
Can you do it?

131
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,000
Yes.

132
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,240
Is your safety harness fastened?

133
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,600
Don't worry, I'm fine.

134
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,200
Alright.

135
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,790
If you were really fine,

136
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,990
you wouldn't ask me to get out.

137
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,360
Be careful.

138
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:47,440
Wait.

139
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:48,670
What are you doing?

140
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:49,600
Alright, hurry down.

141
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,150
What is he doing?

142
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,120
It's okay.

143
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:39,320
He's doing it on purpose.

144
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,630
Dong.

145
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,870
Can you do that?

146
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:05,280
In this profession,
everyone has their role.

147
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:06,610
No one can excel at everything.

148
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,030
So that means you can't.

149
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,750
Chang Dong.

150
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:24,320
Dong.

151
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,320
Are you okay?

152
00:13:25,550 --> 00:13:26,360
I'm fine.

153
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,030
Move to the side.

154
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:29,910
I'll move the car.

155
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,600
How did you know this was here?

156
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:34,670
How did he know it was here?

157
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,960
What's going on?

158
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:41,840
A coffin.

159
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,260
- Don't get too close.
- It's really here.

160
00:13:56,600 --> 00:13:57,790
What is depicted, Fatty Tang?

161
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,320
This should be a great general.

162
00:14:01,630 --> 00:14:03,390
Thinking of his deceased wife, perhaps?

163
00:14:03,390 --> 00:14:04,200
Dong is right.

164
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,790
This is indeed the great general

165
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:07,030
mourning his deceased wife.

166
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,320
At that time,

167
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:10,510
after his wife's death,

168
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:12,240
the great general was melancholic.

169
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,200
A sorcerer

170
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,910
claimed to be able to reunite them.

171
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:16,120
But they could only

172
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,630
see each other
through a curtain.

173
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,180
This story was quite famous at the time.

174
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,750
According to a legend,

175
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,960
in ancient deserts, there was a time
when evil spirits roamed freely.

176
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,120
(Desert)

177
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,590
(Desert)
During their travels, some sorcerers

178
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,150
discovered a strange entrance
deep in the desert.

179
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:37,790
It seemed like a dead-end,

180
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,600
but there was another world inside,

181
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,960
perhaps the source of the supernatural.

182
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,630
The creatures and landscapes inside

183
00:14:45,670 --> 00:14:47,200
were vastly different.

184
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:49,440
There, the sorcerers

185
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,960
learned the art of controlling
these supernatural beasts.

186
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:56,120
They used this power to manipulate
and please the powerful.

187
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:02,080
After the great general
failed to call back his deceased wife,

188
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,870
he blamed the sorcerers.

189
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,720
So, he decided

190
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:10,630
to banish the sorcerers
and their supernatural creatures

191
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,150
to that strange realm.

192
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,870
He sealed the entrance,

193
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:21,440
ensuring they would
never return to the mortal world.

194
00:15:28,150 --> 00:15:32,150
This is the story of the supernatural
sealed within Yumen Pass.

195
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,600
There are some texts here.

196
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,030
I don't know if it's
from the Qin or Han dynasty.

197
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,720
There are six characters.

198
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,270
Something bone...

199
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,550
Something soul...

200
00:15:56,030 --> 00:15:58,320
Something bone, something soul...

201
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:01,840
Dong.

202
00:16:03,550 --> 00:16:04,360
Can we open it?

203
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:07,790
Go ahead.

204
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,510
Gao Shen.

205
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:27,550
What's going on?

206
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:28,550
Why it's getting dark?

207
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:29,670
Everyone, don't move.

208
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:38,910
Dong.

209
00:16:39,550 --> 00:16:41,480
Did the sky change like this
when Hui Ba died?

210
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:44,990
It was too dark. I couldn't see clearly.

211
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,270
Be careful.

212
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,720
The Ming Dynasty.

213
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,550
This is from the Ming Dynasty.

214
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:04,920
Look.

215
00:17:05,830 --> 00:17:06,240
No doubt.

216
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,270
Look at this headdress.

217
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:09,070
During the Ming Dynasty,

218
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:11,310
this is what adult men used
to tie their hair with.

219
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,960
And these leather accessories.

220
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,440
It must be from the Ming Dynasty.

221
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,550
Are we going to find things

222
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,300
from the Tang, Song, Yuan,
Ming, and Qing dynasties?

223
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,000
My godfather said

224
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,310
that you opened a Tang coffin,

225
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,720
and this one is from the Ming Dynasty.

226
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:25,750
How come there aren't
any accompanying items?

227
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,720
You don't understand.

228
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,720
This isn't a coffin.

229
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,750
It's a shadow coffin.

230
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,400
It looks like a coffin,

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,000
so people colloquially call it

232
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,350
a coffin.

233
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:36,160
How many?

234
00:17:37,270 --> 00:17:38,070
Nine.

235
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,550
Nine again.

236
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,510
Apart from the clothing
and the dynasty origin,

237
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:46,640
it's not much different

238
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,920
from that Tang coffin.

239
00:17:58,070 --> 00:17:59,550
Fatty Tang said
that the Ghost Camel Caravan

240
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,840
has been a rumor for hundreds of years.

241
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,000
It might not be entirely right.

242
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,550
Perhaps since the Han Dynasty,

243
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,830
each dynasty has one version of it.

244
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:05,960
Or one could say,

245
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,000
there's a passage that connects

246
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,200
to the inside of the pass.

247
00:18:09,270 --> 00:18:10,590
Do you still remember that camera?

248
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:12,000
The Seagull brand from the 1980s.

249
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,300
It's already considered an antique.

250
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:14,480
That's right.

251
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,240
The things we use now are constantly

252
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,720
being updated and replaced.

253
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:19,820
A few years ago,
we were still using phones with buttons.

254
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:21,880
But now,
almost every phone is touchscreen.

255
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,590
This camera uses film,

256
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:24,960
and hardly anyone uses it anymore.

257
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,340
If there are people inside the pass,

258
00:18:26,510 --> 00:18:27,480
it means there's a...

259
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,270
Of supplies within.

260
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,030
That's right.

261
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,030
Let's go back for now.

262
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,000
Liuxi.

263
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,240
Liuxi.

264
00:19:04,030 --> 00:19:05,440
The shadow puppetry from that night.

265
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,000
Yes.

266
00:19:10,030 --> 00:19:10,830
Let's go take a look.

267
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:26,070
Do ghost fires transform?

268
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,160
Is it hot?

269
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:36,960
No, it's not hot.

270
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,710
It doesn't resemble ghost fire.

271
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,960
Ghost fire, in essence,
is phosphorescence.

272
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,880
It's more like gnats.

273
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:46,640
Gnats?

274
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:49,200
In this area,

275
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,880
it's a common type of mosquito.

276
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:52,360
They're more abundant in the summer.

277
00:19:52,510 --> 00:19:54,070
They have a very small size.

278
00:19:54,070 --> 00:19:56,270
Exploration teams
used to be bothered by them

279
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,750
because once they appeared,

280
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,000
they would come in swarms,

281
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:00,370
covering everything in darkness.

282
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,310
Even mosquito repellent
didn't work.

283
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,880
But it's not summer now.

284
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,550
Moreover, do gnats emit light

285
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:06,920
similar to ghost fire?

286
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,440
Do you think it's possible

287
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,270
that they flew out from inside the pass?

288
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,110
We know nothing
about what's inside the pass.

289
00:20:18,110 --> 00:20:19,400
Anything is possible.

290
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:23,550
Look.

291
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,720
If you consider the timing,

292
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,790
the anomaly should have disappeared.

293
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,920
Is it possible

294
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:31,070
that they are heading back?

295
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,880
And they are all
flying in this direction.

296
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:40,720
Let's go.

297
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,720
Follow them and see.

298
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,110
Could this be an entrance?

299
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,880
Make a mark.

300
00:20:57,310 --> 00:20:58,110
Okay.

301
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:13,220
If this is really the entrance,

302
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,780
will you go in?

303
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,580
I'm from inside the pass for sure,

304
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:18,620
but you...

305
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:19,380
I will.

306
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,940
I'll do what we agreed upon.

307
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,620
Besides,

308
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:25,460
there's an old saying,

309
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,620
"It's always darkest before the dawn".

310
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,660
The less we can see clearly,

311
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,180
the closer the truth is to us.

312
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:35,300
So, after finding Kong Yang
and the others,

313
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:36,180
you'll come out?

314
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,300
Yes.

315
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:50,300
Miss.

316
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:51,700
How should I address you?

317
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:53,940
My last name is Ye.

318
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:56,140
Ye Liuxi.

319
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,380
(If I have to be connected)

320
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,620
(to someone in this world,)

321
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,740
(and if you're that person,)

322
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:21,020
(I guess I can accept it.)

323
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,660
Why are you smiling?

324
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,020
Was I?

325
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,820
You were.

326
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:44,660
Say,

327
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,380
if I were to take a stick

328
00:22:47,380 --> 00:22:49,660
and hit you with it
to make you go silly,

329
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:51,940
then tie you up with a rope,

330
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:53,020
would you be more obedient

331
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:54,340
and stay by my side,

332
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,540
looking all foolish,

333
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,100
when I work at my melon stall?

334
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:01,580
That's called illegal detention.

335
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,540
Didn't you say

336
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,300
I don't have much legal awareness?

337
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:12,900
Actually, you're a good person.

338
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,700
You see, you're a good person

339
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,940
with a quick mind, nimble wit,

340
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,420
decent skills,

341
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:20,100
and you're reliable.

342
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,220
The most important thing
is that we cooperate very well.

343
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,500
It's a pity.

344
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,260
A pity? What do you mean?

345
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,940
Your health is not good.

346
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,420
Let's go.

347
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,180
Hurry up.

348
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,860
Morning.

349
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:16,500
I've left you some food.

350
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,740
Mr. Artist.

351
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,660
Can you carve a shadow puppet for me?

352
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:37,300
Use me

353
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,220
as your model.

354
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,060
Okay.

355
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,940
If you pay, I'll carve.

356
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,500
There's phone signal now.

357
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:49,420
Quick. Look.

358
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,820
The six characters
on the coffin that day.

359
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,940
Something Gu,
[*Bone]

360
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,300
something Hun,
[*Soul]

361
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:55,980
It's actually

362
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,620
Liu Xi Gu.
[*The Bone of Liuxi]

363
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,260
Wang Dong Hun.
[*The Soul of Wangdong]

364
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,420
You see, it rhymes quite well, right?

365
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,860
Liu and Wang are verbs.
[*Flow and look]

366
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,660
Xi vs. Dong.
[*West vs. east]

367
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:06,900
Bone vs. soul.

368
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:09,660
And if you read it backward,
it makes sense too.

369
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,300
Look.

370
00:25:10,450 --> 00:25:11,830
Hun Dong Wang.
[*Soul looks east]

371
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:13,060
Gu Xi Liu.
[*Bones flow west]

372
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,500
It's just like those criminals
who entered the pass.

373
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:16,540
It all fits perfectly.

374
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,900
You see, when these people are exiled,

375
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,900
their bones head west.

376
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
But their souls

377
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,500
return east.

378
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,660
This means that they all want
to return home.

379
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:27,860
How coincidental.

380
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:29,740
Ye Liuxi.

381
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
Chang Dong.

382
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,940
It's also Xi vs. Dong, right?
[*West vs. east]

383
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
Instead of guessing here,

384
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:38,940
why don't we just
see for ourselves?

385
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,860
We've both decided anyway.

386
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,420
Let's do it tonight.

387
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,900
What have you decided?

388
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,580
We might have found a way
to enter the pass.

389
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:47,700
Do you come along?

390
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
Of course.

391
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:50,500
You two are going in.

392
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,140
It's definitely safe
for me to be with you,

393
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:52,820
right?

394
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,340
Besides, if you don't take me with you,

395
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:58,340
that Ding Liu and her godfather

396
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,020
might just end up killing me.

397
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:01,420
So, I'd rather stay with you.

398
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,660
It gives me peace of mind.

399
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:06,620
Should we bring them?

400
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,300
It's just a bunch of yardangs.

401
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,620
And we've parked our car here.

402
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:16,700
We should.

403
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,940
Liuxi, look.

404
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,900
Dong.

405
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,220
Ba.

406
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,180
I'll drive you home.

407
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,100
Pass Qi a message for me.

408
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:54,700
I'll take good care of Liu.

409
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,580
Drive safe.

410
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,780
Today, we plan to step into the pass.

411
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,990
It might be very dangerous.

412
00:26:59,220 --> 00:26:59,940
Will you go?

413
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,420
If you are going in,
then of course we are too.

414
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,580
Danger doesn't matter.

415
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,780
As long as we can go in.

416
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:07,100
Finally, something exciting is happening.

417
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:08,960
Don't you discuss with him?

418
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,260
He follows me.

419
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:13,060
I can make this decision on my own.

420
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:14,380
Alright.

421
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,860
Prepare the necessary supplies

422
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:16,940
and equipment.

423
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,140
Get in my car by then.

424
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,180
Why?

425
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,900
Isn't five people in one car
too crowded?

426
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:23,340
If you want to go,
don't ask so many questions.

427
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,940
We'll depart before sunset.

428
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:31,620
What's wrong?

429
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:35,460
We'll step into the pass before sunset.

430
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,780
Take the things off the car.

431
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,780
We'll ride in their car.

432
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,540
Alright.

433
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:19,740
Let me drive.

434
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,820
Is there no gate?

435
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:53,260
The wind is getting stronger.
Will the car be overturned?

436
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,100
That yardang in front

437
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,540
is at least 20 meters high.

438
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:58,860
According to logic,
it should block the wind.

439
00:29:59,220 --> 00:30:01,220
But the wind is still blowing
from that direction.

440
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,940
Liuxi.

441
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:17,740
Hold on tight.

442
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,180
Make or break.

443
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:43,620
What are you doing?

444
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,020
This is suicide!

445
