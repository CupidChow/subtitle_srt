1
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:12,540
(Huyang City)

2
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,199
(Huyang City)
Hurry up.

3
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,540
(Huyang City)

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,020
(Sweet Plum Theater)

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,320
(Sweet Plum Theater)
Catch up.

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:20,320
Let's go.

7
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,300
(Elder Yan)

8
00:00:27,559 --> 00:00:28,640
We are now

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,920
in Huyang City.

10
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,079
In a few months,

11
00:00:31,079 --> 00:00:33,479
we will take down the Black Stone City
in one fell swoop.

12
00:00:33,479 --> 00:00:35,479
By then, it will be
all our Scorpion Eye brothers,

13
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:37,320
and we can celebrate together.

14
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,480
Mr. Zhan.

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,959
In my opinion,

16
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,920
having feelings for Miss Qing

17
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:16,840
is not a wise move.

18
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:20,719
Why are you suddenly saying that?

19
00:01:22,239 --> 00:01:23,599
Miss Qing's heart

20
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,439
is like a vast lake.

21
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,519
But her interest in dating

22
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:30,000
is probably less than

23
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,200
a ladle of water.

24
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,840
So I'm saying

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,640
that if someone has this idea,

26
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,239
they should spend their time
on someone else.

27
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:42,239
Don't you think so?

28
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,000
Mr. Zhan.

29
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,120
Miss Qing is asking for both of you.

30
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,439
Qingzhi.

31
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,360
You're looking for me?

32
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,960
Who are you?

33
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,919
My name is Ye Liuxi.

34
00:02:24,759 --> 00:02:26,479
I work under Mr. Zhan.

35
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,080
Your name is Ye Liuxi?

36
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,879
Such a coincidence, right?

37
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,080
Because I'm currently recruiting...

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,680
I don't like her.

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:43,919
Let her go.

40
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,520
Give her some money

41
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,479
and send her back to where she came from.

42
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,000
Alright.

43
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,159
Since it's
someone Jiang Zhan wants to keep,

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,680
you can stay.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,719
You can leave first.

46
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:36,439
I'll talk to Jiang Zhan for a moment.

47
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:51,520
Qingzhi.

48
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,520
That Ye Liuxi,

49
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,680
I didn't like her at first sight.

50
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,080
I can't really explain the reason.

51
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,759
Jiang Zhan.

52
00:04:01,199 --> 00:04:02,919
Since you want to keep her,

53
00:04:02,919 --> 00:04:04,400
you are the referrer.

54
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:05,919
You need to keep an eye on her.

55
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,639
If she does something

56
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:08,719
harmful to Scorpion Eye in the future,

57
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,159
you'll be held accountable.

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,800
Alright, you can leave.

59
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:34,580
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

60
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:38,420
=Episode 31=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

61
00:06:40,079 --> 00:06:42,160
These are all prepared
according to your preferences.

62
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,800
Why aren't you eating?

63
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,759
Your memory should have

64
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,120
recovered by now.

65
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:00,240
These are the outbound shipping records

66
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,360
of Ye Qingzhi over the past few years.

67
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:10,720
The year I circled,

68
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,959
many of the items

69
00:07:11,959 --> 00:07:13,079
were labeled as "unknown".

70
00:07:13,079 --> 00:07:15,000
Do you know why?

71
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,360
You don't know
or don't want to say?

72
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,120
Not knowing is normal too.

73
00:07:27,279 --> 00:07:28,800
After all, Ye Qingzhi

74
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,040
is selfish, indifferent,

75
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,399
and inherently suspicious.

76
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,319
In the short few months
I've been in Scorpion Eye,

77
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,959
I can see

78
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:38,199
that she doesn't trust you.

79
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,279
I'm talking to you.

80
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:17,759
Who do you think you are

81
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,839
to treat me like this?

82
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,519
If it were someone else,

83
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,560
I would have killed them long ago.

84
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,120
Think of it

85
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,159
as for Qingzhi's sake.

86
00:09:02,559 --> 00:09:04,080
You shouldn't treat me like this.

87
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,240
Qingzhi?

88
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,320
Who is Qingzhi?

89
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:16,159
And who are you?

90
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,279
Do you believe I'll kick you off the bed?

91
00:09:46,039 --> 00:09:46,960
Liuxi.

92
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,039
If you kick me down, I'll hit my head.

93
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,600
Then it'll become unstable again.

94
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:54,879
Liuxi.

95
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,840
What will happen with you and Dong?

96
00:10:01,039 --> 00:10:02,000
Isn't it you guys who said

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,720
the butterfly shouldn't be blamed
for the storm?

98
00:10:05,159 --> 00:10:07,279
That was just talk.

99
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,360
Tell the truth, Liu.

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,039
If you were Chang Dong,

101
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:14,200
how would you think of me?

102
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,360
I...

103
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,320
I think I can understand you.

104
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,270
After all, it was an accident.

105
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:20,960
It's not like you killed them
by yourself.

106
00:10:21,390 --> 00:10:22,390
As for the feeding,

107
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,510
perhaps to you,

108
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:25,910
a corpse is just a corpse.

109
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,960
You're just using it for feeding.

110
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:31,000
But I might feel quite uncomfortable

111
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,790
because it's a family member's corpse,
isn't it?

112
00:10:32,790 --> 00:10:34,320
Can you still be friends with me
after that?

113
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,000
It depends.

114
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,390
Go to sleep.

115
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,320
Move before I kick you.

116
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,270
Life is hard.

117
00:11:09,550 --> 00:11:10,360
Come in.

118
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,030
What's wrong?

119
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:21,750
Sit.

120
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,790
I just want to ask about your thoughts.

121
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:38,150
According to Long Zhi,

122
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,750
you have the Bone of Liuxi.

123
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:42,200
Every time
you step in or out of the pass,

124
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,000
it causes a small-scale
body and soul separation in Yumen Pass,

125
00:11:45,790 --> 00:11:46,870
which then turns into a sandstorm

126
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:48,320
to cover your tracks.

127
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,720
What does that mean?

128
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,240
It means our previous way was wrong.

129
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,390
Do you mean the blood-dripping method?

130
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,630
I told you so.

131
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,670
If we had to drip blood every time
we step in or out of the pass,

132
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,870
our blood would be drained long ago.

133
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:06,670
Now that you can't remember the way
to step in or out of the pass,

134
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,960
without someone to guide us,

135
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,030
we won't be able
to find the door ourselves.

136
00:12:16,510 --> 00:12:17,750
But I have an idea.

137
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,000
Li Jin'ao.

138
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,240
Come on.

139
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,200
Come out and move around.

140
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,440
It's possible,

141
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,240
but I can't be sure.

142
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,510
Long Zhi wants me to kill you,

143
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,840
but I haven't given her an answer.

144
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,270
Once we arrive at Flowing Sand Yardang,

145
00:12:58,510 --> 00:13:00,150
she will definitely talk to me.

146
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:01,390
By that time...

147
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,600
I can release the gnats

148
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,440
so that
it can find the entrance to the pass

149
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,030
for us to bring Liu and the others out.

150
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:10,750
Right.

151
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:12,600
As long as they are safe,

152
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,550
both of us

153
00:13:13,550 --> 00:13:15,240
will also feel relieved, right?

154
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,200
That sounds good,

155
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,550
but given Gao Shen's physical condition,

156
00:13:20,550 --> 00:13:21,000
I'm afraid

157
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,870
it might attract unnecessary attention.

158
00:13:26,670 --> 00:13:27,600
That's an issue.

159
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,550
Let's take our time
coming up with a solution.

160
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,270
The details

161
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,000
require time to be perfected.

162
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,240
Is there

163
00:13:45,030 --> 00:13:46,550
a problem between us?

164
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,120
What problem?

165
00:13:54,270 --> 00:13:55,080
Silly.

166
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,510
Quit overthinking.

167
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,750
There's no problem between us.

168
00:14:29,030 --> 00:14:29,870
Who is it?

169
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,000
It's me.

170
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:39,630
Chang Dong.

171
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,510
Don't just stand there.

172
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:42,080
Come in.

173
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:42,670
Please come in.

174
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,080
Take a seat.

175
00:14:52,790 --> 00:14:53,510
What's wrong?

176
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:54,550
Is something the matter?

177
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,270
Please take a seat as well.

178
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,030
I'll be straight with you.

179
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,670
You must be

180
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,630
aware of Liuxi's situation.

181
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,440
Those people

182
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:07,200
appear to be escorting us out,

183
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,630
but you're familiar

184
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:09,550
with this route.

185
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:11,240
It's headed toward Flowing Sand Yardang.

186
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,080
I'd like to ask for your help.

187
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:15,600
As long as you need me,

188
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,870
just let me know.

189
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,790
I absolutely won't hesitate to help.

190
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,080
But knowing too much

191
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,080
won't benefit you.

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:24,870
I need you to do me two small favors.

193
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:25,750
First,

194
00:15:25,910 --> 00:15:27,000
continue performing as usual every day.

195
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,840
The more spectacular
and attention-seeking, the better.

196
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,670
Second,

197
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,390
can you lend me the gnats?

198
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:34,320
No problem.

199
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:43,960
Do you know how to use them?

200
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:46,270
Will these bugs fly around randomly?

201
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,360
Bugs?

202
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
No.

203
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,600
They aren't bugs.

204
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,440
When the Li family

205
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:54,550
carved shadow puppets,

206
00:15:54,550 --> 00:15:56,390
gnats are the debris
that fell out of the carving knives.

207
00:15:58,550 --> 00:15:59,750
They're exotic beasts

208
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:02,360
who are capable of shapeshifting.

209
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:11,750
If they threw them away,

210
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,270
it would be a pity,

211
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:15,630
so they distributed to branches like us.

212
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:16,750
You must remember.

213
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,840
When using them,

214
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:19,200
you must pick somewhere like this.

215
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,630
Use it in an enclosed space.

216
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,030
Never release them.

217
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,150
If they fly away,

218
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,960
do I have to compensate you
a large amount?

219
00:16:28,030 --> 00:16:29,360
I like money,

220
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:33,080
but I never earn money from friends.

221
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,870
Here's the thing.

222
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:35,960
This creature

223
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,270
doesn't recognize home.

224
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:38,960
Once you release them,

225
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,240
they're gone forever.

226
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,630
They will never come back.

227
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,200
Other than these,

228
00:16:43,200 --> 00:16:44,120
do you have anything else?

229
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,550
I wouldn't want
to affect your future business.

230
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,150
Let me tell you a secret.

231
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,390
The reason I came out
to make a name for myself

232
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,670
at this age

233
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:56,720
was because firstly,

234
00:16:56,790 --> 00:16:58,440
I wanted to achieve something.

235
00:16:58,750 --> 00:16:59,390
Secondly,

236
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,750
I messed up back then.

237
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,270
I used to be responsible

238
00:17:03,270 --> 00:17:05,790
for taking care of these gnats.

239
00:17:06,070 --> 00:17:07,440
But due to a slip-up,

240
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,070
a big bag of them flew away.

241
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,110
I was afraid back then,

242
00:17:11,110 --> 00:17:12,160
and I was anxious,

243
00:17:12,590 --> 00:17:14,160
not knowing what to do.

244
00:17:14,310 --> 00:17:15,720
Due to that, I ran away,

245
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:18,590
thinking

246
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:20,350
that when I achieve success
in the future

247
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,590
and secured a position,

248
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,160
perhaps no one
will bring up this matter to me again.

249
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:25,720
Who knew

250
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:26,350
that now...

251
00:17:26,350 --> 00:17:28,000
Where did the gnats fly to?

252
00:17:28,830 --> 00:17:29,640
I don't know.

253
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,440
They're exotic beasts,

254
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,550
so they don't need to eat

255
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:32,720
or drink.

256
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,750
When there's wind,

257
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,310
they will follow.

258
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:36,310
If there's no wind,

259
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:37,350
they just float around aimlessly.

260
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:39,510
With enough time,

261
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,640
flying tens of thousands of miles

262
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:42,510
wouldn't be a problem for them.

263
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:43,920
Do you

264
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,750
remember

265
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:46,590
where they flew toward back then?

266
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,070
The south.

267
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,750
They can fly high,

268
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,750
so I couldn't catch them
no matter how high I jumped.

269
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,960
Why are you laughing?

270
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,400
Nothing.

271
00:18:07,110 --> 00:18:08,400
Fate

272
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,270
brought us together.

273
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,830
For the gnats,

274
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,680
you can decide how much to give me.

275
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't mind.

276
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:29,680
Thank you.

277
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:31,350
No worries.

278
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,070
Are you alright?

279
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:49,880
I'm fine.

280
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:01,350
Liuxi told me.

281
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:04,000
I'm really fine.

282
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,680
You guys should leave the pass.

283
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,920
If you get out,

284
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,200
don't rush
to get me a substitute tongue.

285
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,680
Besides,

286
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,000
the pass is huge.

287
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:19,030
The Feather Guards are not the only ones
who have substitute tongues.

288
00:19:22,920 --> 00:19:23,830
I know.

289
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,720
But it's only been a few days
since I came,

290
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,680
so I'm reluctant to leave.

291
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,240
You're reluctant

292
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:39,640
to leave these valuable items
in the pass, aren't you?

293
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,640
Everyone thinks
that I only care about money,

294
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,480
don't they?

295
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,790
Everyone assumes

296
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,110
that I came back for money.

297
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:57,920
Right?

298
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,920
You think so too, don't you?

299
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:32,440
What are you thinking, then?

300
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,680
Can you tell me?

301
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:42,790
He.

302
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,750
I just don't want to leave you behind.

303
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:09,270
Why are you alone here?

304
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,270
Liu went to see Gao Shen.

305
00:21:12,790 --> 00:21:13,790
Fatty Tang

306
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,550
went to convince He.

307
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,550
How about

308
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,590
you come

309
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,510
and take a walk with me?

310
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:23,750
Let's go.

311
00:21:27,110 --> 00:21:27,920
What's wrong?

312
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:30,790
Did your legs go numb again?

313
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:38,030
Actually, it recovers quicker
if you go out for a walk.

314
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
The stars are out tonight.

315
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,640
I know.

316
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:43,400
Let me recover for a bit.

317
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:45,790
Sure. I'll give you a massage.

318
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,200
Just now, Li Jin'ao told me

319
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,350
he used to be in charge
of raising gnats.

320
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:53,790
He said
a batch of them had once escaped.

321
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:55,310
Actually, gnats are

322
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:58,310
flakes of skin carved out
from the shadow puppets' bodies.

323
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,310
He watched
as the gnats flew toward the south.

324
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:02,510
The south?

325
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,510
Yes.

326
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
So our guess is correct.

327
00:22:05,920 --> 00:22:06,550
Yes, we are.

328
00:22:10,350 --> 00:22:11,720
I didn't expect Li Jin'ao

329
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:13,350
would become our guide.

330
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:16,160
It's quite interesting,
if you think of it that way.

331
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,070
Get up and take a walk.

332
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:21,200
It'll recover quicker
if you walk it out.

333
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:23,750
Come on. Let's go.

334
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:24,640
Wait.

335
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:29,400
It's itching.

336
00:22:29,680 --> 00:22:30,550
It's itching?

337
00:22:35,350 --> 00:22:36,110
My head hurts.

338
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,920
Let me sit down and rest.

339
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,350
Here.

340
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,400
I'll accompany you there later.

341
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,720
Sure. Take your time.

342
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,000
Why are you so reluctant
to go out with me?

343
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:49,880
Let me tell you,

344
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,240
the numbness in my leg

345
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,720
is really annoying.

346
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,400
I wonder who's the one

347
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,400
who always wants my leg.

348
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:00,510
Why do you keep holding grudges?

349
00:23:00,510 --> 00:23:01,310
I'm petty.

350
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:04,920
You say,

351
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,880
when we get old

352
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,680
and our feet aren't as nimble,

353
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,110
who will be supporting whom?

354
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,590
Don't look at me.

355
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,110
I think I'll be the one helping you.

356
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:17,240
With your small build,

357
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,310
a little breeze will give you a cold.

358
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,400
What are you thinking?

359
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,400
I'm imagining

360
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:32,680
how will you be when you grow old.

361
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:38,030
Well, I have some self-awareness.

362
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,790
I certainly can't compete
with young girls.

363
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:42,310
But,

364
00:23:43,550 --> 00:23:45,070
this "but" is very important.

365
00:23:46,110 --> 00:23:48,000
Among all the little old ladies,

366
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,310
I'm definitely

367
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,920
the most outstanding and unique one.

368
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,640
Liuxi.

369
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:48,750
Looking at your grin,

370
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,590
you must have reconciled with Dong.

371
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:52,510
A child shouldn't be talking nonsense.

372
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,920
By the way, Liu,

373
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,880
you get in the same car
as Chang Dong later

374
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:00,440
and help me watch him.

375
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:02,240
I think something's wrong with him.

376
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:03,680
Why is that?

377
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,640
Is he unwilling to forgive you?

378
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:07,880
That's not it.

379
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
I think

380
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,400
he's giving me a feeling

381
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,400
like

382
00:25:12,750 --> 00:25:14,960
the matter with Kong Yang
doesn't bother him.

383
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
Isn't that a good thing?

384
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:18,830
It means Dong is open-minded.

385
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:20,030
It means he likes you,

386
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:22,200
which is why
he's not holding grudges anymore.

387
00:25:23,830 --> 00:25:25,440
Chang Dong
is a person of loyalty and integrity.

388
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:26,440
Not just toward me.

389
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,400
He even sold his family's property

390
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,400
to compensate the victims' families.

391
00:25:30,750 --> 00:25:32,350
He practically disappeared
for two years.

392
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,070
He came with me to Dalpur

393
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:35,310
because of a photograph

394
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,920
and even prepared eighteen body bags.

395
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,440
He didn't just come for Kong Yang.

396
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
A person's character doesn't change,

397
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,270
no matter the circumstances.

398
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,400
Don't you think his behavior is odd?

399
00:25:47,070 --> 00:25:48,070
Hasn't Dong

400
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:50,160
always been that way?

401
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,160
Anyway, just help me keep an eye on him.

402
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,110
Promise me.

403
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:58,830
Okay, okay.

404
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,350
(Liuxi.)

405
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:13,400
(whatever comes to my mind)

406
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:15,750
(these days.)

407
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:18,590
(I have a lot to say.)

408
00:26:21,110 --> 00:26:22,110
(I thought when I)

409
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,680
(reached Flowing Sand Yardang,)

410
00:26:23,680 --> 00:26:25,400
(I could write almost everything.)

411
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,640
(But now I realize)

412
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,000
(that it's never enough.)

413
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,960
(Spending time with you today,)

414
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,070
(I couldn't stop thinking)

415
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:38,400
(about what you'll be like when you're old.)

416
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,400
(What kind of old lady will you become?)

417
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,640
(What clothes will you like to wear?)

418
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,440
(What flavors will you prefer?)

419
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,270
(What hairstyle will you have?)

420
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,750
(Will you
still be as bossy as you are now?)

421
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,510
(I'd really like to know)

422
00:26:59,000 --> 00:26:59,550
(Because my time)

423
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,030
(is running out.)

424
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:11,110
This the deserted village
from when we first entered the pass.

425
00:28:11,110 --> 00:28:12,030
Yes.

426
00:28:16,310 --> 00:28:17,440
What's wrong, Liuxi?

427
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:27,960
Chang Dong.

428
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:31,160
Chang Dong.

429
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,070
Would you like to visit Kong Yang?

430
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:37,960
Sure.

431
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,350
Liuxi.

432
00:29:07,350 --> 00:29:10,000
Why did you let Dong visit Kong Yang?

433
00:29:10,110 --> 00:29:11,400
What's wrong with that?

434
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:13,070
She's his ex.

435
00:29:13,070 --> 00:29:14,550
It's better not to mention her again.

436
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:16,110
It's fine if you're not wary about it,

437
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,920
but why give him
a chance to reminisce about it?

438
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,790
Why find a man
if you're afraid of so many things?

439
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:20,790
Isn't that tiring?

440
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,680
He's my man,

441
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,680
and I'm not afraid to trust him.

442
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,640
If he betrays me, then I'm blind.

443
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,550
Come on. Let's check this place out.

444
00:29:32,550 --> 00:29:33,030
Sure.

445
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:38,400
Where are you going?

446
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,550
Looking around.

447
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:47,240
(Warding against demons)

448
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:34,030
Liuxi.

449
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:36,270
Actually,
this is not the only village here.

450
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:39,200
Your home might not
be in this deserted village.

451
00:30:39,790 --> 00:30:40,590
It's here.

452
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:42,720
I remember.

453
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:10,180

No trespassing nature reserves.)
