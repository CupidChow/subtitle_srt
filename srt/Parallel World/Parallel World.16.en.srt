00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:04,500
=Episode 16=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,460
What's going on?

4
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,820
What are you guys talking about?

5
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,020
Liu.

6
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:16,660
Hurry.

7
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:17,900
Help her get in the car.

8
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:20,140
- Don't be afraid.
- Gao Shen, am I going to die?

9
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,100
Get her in.

10
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,380
I'll deal with that Scorpion Eye.

11
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,300
No, you won't.

12
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,060
Liu.

13
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:34,420
Don't cry.

14
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,980
There are many reports online

15
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:38,700
of people getting stabbed in fights

16
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,660
without even realizing it.

17
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:42,460
Some even went to the hospital
by themselves,

18
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,700
and they all turned out fine.

19
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,100
That's different.

20
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:47,900
Hospitals were accessible to them,

21
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,020
but right now,
we have no idea where we're heading.

22
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,180
There's a hospital here too.

23
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,620
Aren't there Yellow Soil City

24
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,540
and Black Stone City?

25
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:57,860
- There must be a hospital there.
- He's right, Liu.

26
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,340
We'll likely get well

27
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,420
once we receive treatment at the hospital.

28
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:24,440
(Yellow Soil City)

29
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:34,620
Mister.

30
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,220
Where's the hospital?

31
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,620
Up ahead. At that dead-end.

32
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,380
Go.

33
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,860
Doctor.

34
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,740
Where's the doctor?

35
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,460
Inside.

36
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,240
(Huang Ji's Clinic)

37
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,220
The doctor is here.

38
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:56,780
Hurry.

39
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,620
Calm down.

40
00:03:58,820 --> 00:03:59,260
Hurry.

41
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,100
What's the hurry?

42
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,580
Doctor.

43
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:00,940
Here.

44
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,020
Take a look at this.

45
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,740
She has a dagger stuck in her head.

46
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,580
Don't move.

47
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,620
I'll go get some helpers.

48
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,900
Hold on a second.

49
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,420
Quick, get a stretcher.

50
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,660
Bring the patient in.

51
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:27,720
(Huang Ji's Clinic)

52
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,100
Considering her current condition,
she requires surgery.

53
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,340
As you can tell,

54
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,740
the facilities here
are barely sufficient.

55
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:44,140
I suggest getting her to Black Stone City.

56
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,300
It's a three- to four-day ride
by metallic van.

57
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,580
What do you mean?

58
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:51,900
Aren't you a doctor?

59
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:54,260
Why can't you treat her?

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,700
Doctor.

61
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,260
I beg you.

62
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,180
Please save her.

63
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:12,980
I can't wait three or four days.

64
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,100
I can perform the surgery,

65
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,700
and I've seen worse cases than this.

66
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,500
The dagger can be extracted,

67
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:30,260
but what potential complications
might arise within the skull,

68
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,060
and what could the resulting outcome be?

69
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,340
This is something

70
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,580
I can't promise.

71
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,780
What's the worst that could happen?

72
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:40,940
I'll state

73
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,540
the worst from mild to severe.

74
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:46,060
In the short term,

75
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:48,700
the patient could suffer
impaired consciousness, coma,

76
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,260
hemiplegia, aphasia,

77
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:54,020
or even death.

78
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,540
Gao Shen.

79
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:04,900
Liu.

80
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,220
Is your head still hurting?

81
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:11,220
It's less painful compared to my arm.

82
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,980
I want

83
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:20,100
to have the dagger extracted.

84
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,860
If things don't go well,

85
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:26,900
pass my word to my godfather.

86
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,900
Tell him I'll repay his favor
in my next life.

87
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,460
Don't blame yourself.

88
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,860
It's simply fate if I meet my end here.

89
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:44,820
Don't say that.

90
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:47,980
If you have to say it,

91
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,620
how...

92
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,020
how...

93
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:00,060
how will I explain it to Qi?

94
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:04,460
Go away. I don't want to see you again.

95
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,300
Alright.

96
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:06,260
Just calm down.

97
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,980
Doctor.

98
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,300
We'll leave her in your hands.

99
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,380
I'll fetch the emergency kit

100
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,620
and check if there's anything
we can use for the surgery.

101
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,700
Let's get prepared.

102
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:42,860
Let's go.

103
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,860
Does it hurt?

104
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,740
Bear it.

105
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,460
I told you to bear it.

106
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:07,100
Liuxi.

107
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:10,100
Is Valley Guardian really dead?

108
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,580
Why isn't it moving at all?

109
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,180
It could be feigning death.

110
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,740
Feigning unconsciousness
whenever danger is near.

111
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,660
Bring it outward.

112
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,900
There we go.

113
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,220
Faking dead whenever danger is close.

114
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,700
No combat ability at all.

115
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,020
It's fine as long as it's alive.

116
00:09:27,020 --> 00:09:27,860
How is it, Doctor?

117
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,940
The surgery went relatively smoothly,

118
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,340
and the dagger was successfully removed.

119
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,260
Now is the critical period.

120
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,220
Don't disturb her,

121
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,540
and let her rest well.

122
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,100
Got it.

123
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,220
Doctor.

124
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:39,820
Can you please check my friend's eyes?

125
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,660
It's nothing major.

126
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:54,220
Just get some sunlight,
and you'll be fine.

127
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,860
So, I'm not going blind, right, Doctor?

128
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:57,860
You're overthinking it.

129
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:00,380
Just get more sunlight. Got it?

130
00:10:00,380 --> 00:10:01,020
Got it.

131
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,440
What is preoccupying you?

132
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,300
Liu is still young.

133
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,380
The way you say it
makes it sound like she is beyond hope.

134
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,100
You're right

135
00:11:58,420 --> 00:11:59,820
that she's still young,

136
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,620
but her recovery ability
is also at its strongest.

137
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:05,420
I believe
she'll definitely pull through.

138
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,900
But the conditions here are so poor.

139
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,500
The surgery isn't even aseptic,

140
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:12,020
and we can't even get a brain scan.

141
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,180
You're right about that.

142
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,900
Think about it, though.

143
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:20,700
In ancient times, people engaged
in hand-to-hand combat,

144
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,620
hacking away so savagely at each other,

145
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,900
but many people survived,
didn't they?

146
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,500
And besides, at the time,

147
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,260
there was no medical equipment at all.

148
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,140
Do you really want to argue with me?

149
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,660
What would you expect?

150
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,340
Should I agree with whatever you say

151
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,020
and have a good cry with you?

152
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,860
Getting along with people
is really difficult over time.

153
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,420
When I first met Liu,

154
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,300
no matter if she lived or died,

155
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,140
I wouldn't even bat an eye.

156
00:12:59,260 --> 00:13:01,460
This feeling right now is so weird.

157
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,580
To not worry,

158
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,180
you have to act like you don't care,

159
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:12,620
but usually, the apathy is mutual.

160
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:15,220
If you never care about others,

161
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,620
it means

162
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,420
you've never been cared about.

163
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,420
But that's not good either.

164
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,380
Chang Dong.

165
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:29,100
I feel so awful about Liu's situation.

166
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,500
You must've felt even worse
back then, right?

167
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:41,060
Since the incident,

168
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,860
you're the first one to comfort me.

169
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,220
The first thing my uncle, Ding Zhou,

170
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:52,540
said to me at the time was,

171
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:56,940
"You are my nephew, so I won't
just stand by and do nothing for you."

172
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,780
"But really,"

173
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,740
"this is too nasty."

174
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,420
This is the first time
someone ever asked me if I was upset.

175
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,620
Why did you attack us?

176
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:02,220
Speak!

177
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,660
It was the van.

178
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:13,860
When I was at Red Flower Tree Inn,

179
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,340
I heard you guys
were driving a metallic van,

180
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,960
so I took an interest in it.

181
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:18,900
Liuxi.

182
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,020
No, no, no.

183
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,020
Dude.

184
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,660
I'll give you another chance,

185
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,540
so come clean about it.

186
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,180
Was it just for the van?

187
00:15:33,820 --> 00:15:36,300
I had my eye on you guys

188
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:37,700
when you were drinking at night.

189
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,140
There are two women

190
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,300
and a skinny guy among you.

191
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:42,900
My scorpion and I

192
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:45,300
could easily take care of you guys.

193
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:47,740
But I didn't expect...

194
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:49,300
Well, it's a shame.

195
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,540
It's a shame? What for?

196
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:54,180
It's a shame

197
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:57,100
that we didn't expect you to have guns.

198
00:16:04,140 --> 00:16:05,380
Guns are rare here.

199
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:08,220
Even Zhan hasn't owned one.

200
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,640
Who is this Zhan you're talking about?

201
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,260
Zhan is

202
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:19,980
Jiang Zhan,

203
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,100
the leader of Scorpion Eye.

204
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:23,260
Do you not know about him?

205
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,820
How did you
manage to have a metallic van then?

206
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,100
Where is Jiang Zhan at?

207
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:31,260
From now on,

208
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:33,500
I won't say a single word.

209
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:40,860
Fine.

210
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,460
Fine? What's fine?

211
00:16:43,460 --> 00:16:44,300
Wait a minute.

212
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,380
What should we do with him?

213
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,420
Let's lock him up in here.

214
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:09,180
Mom.

215
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,460
Please don't kill my mom.

216
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:14,340
No!

217
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,980
You're awake?

218
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:29,980
How are you today? Can you see anything?

219
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:34,200
I think I'm feeling better
than yesterday.

220
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:35,980
Now I'm 70-percent blind.

221
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:40,020
Alright, let's go wash up then.

222
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,980
I don't have time
to look after you alone.

223
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:43,660
Come on.

224
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:56,260
- Watch out for the threshold.
- Ouch.

225
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:58,740
Morning.

226
00:18:59,340 --> 00:18:59,940
Morning.

227
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:00,980
Good morning, Dong.

228
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:01,700
Morning.

229
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,500
The tap is running.
Go ahead and wash up.

230
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,500
Has Liu woken up?

231
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,180
Not yet.

232
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,240
The Scorpion Eye guy, is he dead?

233
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,020
Huh?

234
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:23,460
The Scorpion Eye guy.

235
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:24,540
Is he dead?

236
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,780
Nope. We had the doctor set his bones.

237
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:27,820
He's locked away up there.

238
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:29,300
Why did you have someone set his bones?

239
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,220
His arm was badly swollen.

240
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,140
It was unbearable to see.

241
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,940
He deserved it, didn't he?

242
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,100
Well, it's okay.

243
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,300
I can break them again, anyway.

244
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,580
- What are you looking at?
- Liuxi.

245
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,620
Are you done washing up?

246
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,100
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh.

247
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,460
- He's asking me.
- Oh, okay.

248
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,180
Sit here.

249
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,300
Aren't you going to put on some oil?

250
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,780
I'm poor. I don't have any.

251
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,540
And I've got good skin.

252
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,020
Dong, can I put on some of your oil?

253
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,480
It's here.

254
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:15,340
This map is already quite detailed.

255
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:17,700
It's quite a long way
from one city to another.

256
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,500
The names of each city

257
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,060
are derived
from their building materials.

258
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,660
For instance, the city where we are now
is named Yellow Soil City

259
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:26,540
since most of the buildings in this city

260
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:28,300
are made up of yellow soil.

261
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,900
The doctor also mentioned

262
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,580
that the cities aren't large,

263
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:33,540
about the same size
as that of a town outside the pass.

264
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,220
There are Feather Guards
and sorcerers in every city.

265
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:38,220
To put it simply, the Feather Guards
for public security,

266
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,060
while the sorcerers
deal with exotic beasts.

267
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:41,900
The civilians are responsible
for sustaining them.

268
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,300
Look at this.

269
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,300
This place is named Huyang City.

270
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:49,500
It's located in the northeast
inside the pass.

271
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:51,900
Here lies Scorpion Eye's stronghold.

272
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:53,420
Over two years ago,

273
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,540
Scorpion Eye
hanged a lot of Feather Guards here.

274
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:57,540
Later, in retaliation, Feather Guards

275
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,740
set the place on fire.

276
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,260
Feather Guards?

277
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:00,620
Right.

278
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,620
What about the south?

279
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,380
Is there something
that marks the location of Yumen Pass

280
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,580
over there?

281
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,980
Heading south,

282
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,620
you'll find the Flowing Sand Yardang.

283
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,220
Further south, there's the Demon Museum.

284
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:15,180
So, is there no marker
for the entrance of the pass?

285
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,900
What is the Demon Museum?

286
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,380
I'm not quite sure about the rest.

287
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,060
Let's wait until Liu wakes up.

288
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,940
Then, we'll go to Black Stone City
to ask about it.

289
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,700
Alright.

290
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,540
By the way, come with me
to the market later.

291
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,700
We need to buy some gasoline.

292
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:34,980
I'll join you.

293
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,820
You go there and soak up some sun.

294
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:38,700
It's good for your eyes.

295
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
Just go.

296
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:45,700
Valley Guardian.

297
00:21:46,580 --> 00:21:47,340
Come on.

298
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,020
Go soak up some sun

299
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:49,940
with me.

300
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,420
Liu.

301
00:22:00,020 --> 00:22:01,180
Please wake up.

302
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:09,660
I just want you to be safe and sound,

303
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:16,300
but I didn't expect...

304
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:25,140
Liu.

305
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,820
As long as you wake up,

306
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,300
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

307
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,420
Who's got the ace?

308
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:55,900
You do.

309
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,820
Wait for me for a moment.

310
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,540
Can I know

311
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,940
where I can get gasoline around here?

312
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:01,500
Gasoline?

313
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:01,900
Yes.

314
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,340
Is there gasoline available recently?

315
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:07,340
- You can try checking over there.
- Maybe you can go there.

316
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,740
They have everything down there.

317
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,500
In that place?

318
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:10,220
Yes.

319
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:10,940
Thank you.

320
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,620
Come.

321
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:14,540
Let's continue.

322
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,580
Who got the ace just now?

323
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,460
Why are there so many mirrors here?

324
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,340
Funhouse mirrors.

325
00:23:42,940 --> 00:23:44,260
Let me take a look at you.

326
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:45,500
We have things to do. Let's go.

327
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:54,700
Why are you pulling me?

328
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,140
Look in the mirror.

329
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,340
What are you looking at?

330
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,580
That exotic beast
is here to work for the market.

331
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,300
There's no problem.

332
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,420
You two go ahead.

333
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:06,660
Don't block the way. Hurry up.

334
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,060
Chop chop.

335
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,140
There.

336
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,780
Why aren't they selling under the sun?

337
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,500
It feels so crowded and gloomy.

338
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,900
The doctor said

339
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,780
bandits used to frequently attack.

340
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:35,420
It's not safe outdoors.

341
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,460
Only Black Stone City is fearless.

342
00:24:37,460 --> 00:24:39,580
Other smaller places operate indoors

343
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,660
for safety's sake.

344
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:43,660
(Meizi Beauty Salon)

345
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,300
Can you walk faster?

346
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,380
I don't want it anymore.

347
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,800
You can come back if you want it.

348
00:24:55,660 --> 00:24:56,660
Aren't you feeling hot?

349
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:58,980
This place is quite stuffy.

350
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:07,940
Have a look.

351
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,820
Our knives are pretty good.

352
00:25:19,220 --> 00:25:20,180
What about that one?

353
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:28,700
Of course, miss.

354
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,620
You have a good eye.

355
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,340
This knife is my prized possession
for the store.

356
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:34,500
The top blacksmith in the pass

357
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:37,220
used obsidian from the gold mines

358
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:38,260
to forge it.

359
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,860
I'll let you have a good look today.

360
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,540
Watch closely.

361
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:53,780
This knife is indeed excellent,

362
00:25:54,020 --> 00:25:54,540
but

363
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,980
I'm not selling it.

364
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:58,740
Why are you showing it
if you're not selling it?

365
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,780
Name your price.

366
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:02,620
Miss, you can choose
any other knife you like,

367
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,140
but I'm not selling this one.

368
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,740
A metallic van

369
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,380
and a crate of cold medicine. Deal?

370
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,220
Don't joke around.

371
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:13,940
Let's go.

372
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:21,420
If it's that wristwatch,
we can negotiate.

373
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,740
Let's go. I am not interested anymore.

374
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:29,020
We're here for gasoline.
I have my own knife.

375
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:38,580
(Gasoline)

376
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:45,820
Boss.

377
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,780
Boss?

378
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,460
Excuse me. May I ask

379
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:58,780
why is this shop closed?

380
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,300
It's been closed for a while.

381
00:27:01,300 --> 00:27:04,420
We've been short on gasoline
for a long time.

382
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,180
Thank you.

383
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,250
(Black Stone's new tea arrival.
Welcome to try.)

384
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:20,140
What should we do without gasoline?

385
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,980
We'll figure something out.

386
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,620
You really don't want that knife?

387
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,580
Do you think I'm stupid?

388
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:34,340
This watch of yours
costs tens of thousands, right?

389
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:35,380
Why sell it cheap?

390
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:38,060
Besides, I have a knife.

391
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:42,180
It's been with me for a long time.
It's handy.

392
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,620
That knife of yours

393
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,420
has had its blade sharpened many times,
hasn't it?

394
00:27:46,420 --> 00:27:47,860
Let it be sharpened then.

395
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,780
It's chopped up plenty of melons
with me.

396
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,180
It's got sentimental value.

397
00:27:54,260 --> 00:27:56,020
Alright then. Keep using it.

398
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,380
I need to use the restroom.

399
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,580
Boss?

400
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:09,820
Coming.

401
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Exchange this for the knife.

402
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,100
Thanks.

403
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:22,740
Here you go.

404
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:24,260
Your knife.

405
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:47,460
The common currency inside the pass.

406
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,740
Why did he give you change?

407
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,420
My watch is limited edition
even outside the pass.

408
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,940
For real.

409
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:56,720
There definitely won't be any
inside the pass.

410
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,420
I told the boss

411
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,740
that he can at least double his profit
when he sells it.

412
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,780
I don't want it.

413
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,780
I didn't pay for it.

414
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,140
I didn't say I'd give it to you.

415
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,860
Why did you put it in front of me then?

416
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,860
To let me touch it?

417
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:19,980
You can touch it.

418
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,620
I'm lending it to you.

419
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:23,940
Your knife skills are good.

420
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,180
It's best for you to have it
for everyone's safety.

421
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,340
So, it is to get me to work.

422
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,260
You better take good care of it.

423
00:29:31,580 --> 00:29:33,140
I'll check on it regularly.

424
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,820
But remember,

425
00:29:34,820 --> 00:29:36,260
you only have the right to use it.

426
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:37,980
Its ownership still belongs to me.

427
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,540
Got it.

428
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,140
What about your knife?

429
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,100
Do you guys think
the men from Scorpion Eye

430
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,900
will they lose their heads
when they return

431
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,540
since they suffered a defeat
in Yellow Soil City?

432
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:06,620
I heard  that Jiang Zhan
has a really bad temper.

433
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:08,820
How can you call that a defeat?

434
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,620
That's called a diversion.

435
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:12,900
They sent a small group of people

436
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,460
to create chaos in Yellow Soil City
one moment

437
00:30:14,470 --> 00:30:15,740
and went to Red Brick City the next.

438
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,300
It's all a cover.

439
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,420
They don't want anyone
to know their true intentions.

440
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,300
I've heard differently.

441
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:24,620
Jiang Zhan has already infiltrated
Black Stone City.

442
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,660
Isn't that just seeking death?

443
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:29,220
Black Stone City
has many Feather Guards and sorcerers.

444
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,340
Is Jiang Zhan not afraid of them?

445
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,740
You never know. There might be

446
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:38,300
another Beast Head revolt again.

447
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:41,340
Cut it out. You're talking nonsense.

448
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,820
Two months ago,

449
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,260
the Qian family had asked Silver Snake

450
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:45,500
in Black Stone City.

451
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:48,140
The Sheep's Horn
was nowhere to be found.

452
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,420
Sheep's Horn.

453
00:30:49,900 --> 00:30:50,860
Let me tell you.

454
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:53,380
After the leader of Beast Head,
Li Wangdong,

455
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:56,060
was killed
by the sorcerers and Feather Guards,

456
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:58,220
their treasure, the Sheep's Horn,

457
00:30:58,220 --> 00:30:59,820
had mysteriously disappeared.

458
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:03,140
I think
it was stolen by some thief.

459
00:31:03,140 --> 00:31:04,980
Silver Snake once predicted

460
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:08,460
that when the Sheep's Horn reappears,
Beast Head awakens.

461
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:11,980
The Sheep's Horn reappearance
will cause chaos.

462
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,100
You're just talking nonsense.

463
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:16,260
If

464
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:19,020
the Sheep's Horn hasn't appeared yet,

465
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:20,500
what does Scorpion Eye amount to?

466
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,820
Scorpion Eye is similar
to the Beast Head group.

467
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,820
Even their names are remarkably similar.

468
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,140
I heard that Jiang Zhan

469
00:31:27,140 --> 00:31:28,620
doesn't actually have the Sheep's Horn.

470
00:31:34,900 --> 00:31:35,420
Stop looking.

471
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,580
The sorcerers and Feather Guards
are here.

472
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,980
Go. Move aside.

473
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:39,780
Don't block the way.

474
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,620
Sit down quickly.

475
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:47,940
Let me tell you.
There are usually five people on patrol.

476
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,660
Why are there fewer people today?

477
00:31:49,660 --> 00:31:50,540
Yes.

478
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:59,420
What those people said just now
is for reference only.

479
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:03,140
The truth has been distorted
as it passed from mouth to mouth.

480
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,580
Where is the Sheep's Horn?

481
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,780
It's still here.

482
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:09,980
Where?

483
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,980
In the car.

484
00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:14,420
You left such an important thing
in the car?

485
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,260
I know.

486
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:16,340
Where in the car?

487
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:17,460
I'll get it myself in a moment.

488
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:20,900
Are your eyes okay?

489
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:24,140
I've been basking in the sun
all afternoon, Liuxi. I'm better now.

490
00:32:24,140 --> 00:32:25,460
I can see clearly.

491
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,260
Where did you get this knife, Liuxi?

492
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:33,260
What dynasty is this from?

493
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,500
Don't touch it.

494
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:38,180
Dong,
are there many things at the market?

495
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:39,780
Mostly old stuff.

496
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,740
Go take a look yourself
when your eyes are better.

497
00:32:42,140 --> 00:32:43,940
That's the stuff I want to see.

498
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,300
Liuxi.

499
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:48,940
What about your knife?

500
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,100
You don't want it anymore?

501
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:51,780
You want it?

502
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:52,660
Yes.

503
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,060
Take it.

504
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,260
Give it to me, Dong.

505
00:32:57,820 --> 00:33:00,580
With this,
I'm not afraid of anyone anymore.

506
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:34,140
You scared me.

507
00:33:34,140 --> 00:33:35,900
I just wanted to take a look.

508
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:45,180
