(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:43,920
=Episode 4=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:48,560
(Goose Head Dunes)

4
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,660
Watch out.

5
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,900
Don't be clumsy.

6
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:43,540
Alright.

7
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,700
I've placed everything
in their right place.

8
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:45,340
Yu.

9
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:46,300
You've got some skills.

10
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,380
You can open a restaurant with this.

11
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:49,900
I always enjoy studying food.

12
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,900
My son really likes it.

13
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,380
It's really delicious.

14
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:53,820
Stop taking pictures.

15
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,020
Go and help out.

16
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:58,060
Chang Dong is proposing later.

17
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,060
You should go and help.

18
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:00,980
Chang Dong.

19
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:02,580
Are you ready?

20
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:03,820
I'm ready.

21
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:05,980
You seem a bit nervous.

22
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,380
I'm not nervous at all.

23
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,420
We've all been through this.

24
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,540
We had all proposed when we were young.

25
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:14,500
Let me show you something.

26
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,839
My precious son.

27
00:03:15,839 --> 00:03:16,719
Handsome, right?

28
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:17,799
Very handsome.

29
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,119
Let me tell you.

30
00:03:19,999 --> 00:03:21,959
If the proposal is successful today,

31
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,359
18 years from now,

32
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,799
you'll have a child who will be
having his university entrance exam

33
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:27,519
at this time.

34
00:03:29,559 --> 00:03:31,079
- Hurry up.
- Hurry up!

35
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,680
(Kong Yang)

36
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:40,719
Be quiet.

37
00:03:44,399 --> 00:03:45,239
Kong Yang.

38
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:46,559
Marry me.

39
00:03:55,799 --> 00:03:57,039
Marry him!

40
00:03:57,039 --> 00:03:57,879
Kong Yang.

41
00:03:57,879 --> 00:04:04,359
Marry him!

42
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,239
How did Chang Dong teach me?

43
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,359
Press the clutch, downshift,

44
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:30,199
then brake lightly,
and release the clutch again.

45
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:34,559
Step on it firmly.

46
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,119
I'm done.

47
00:05:35,559 --> 00:05:36,359
Kong Yang?

48
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,799
If you mistake me for Kong Yang,

49
00:05:39,799 --> 00:05:41,119
then I won't go over.

50
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:42,839
After all, I'm the kind of person

51
00:05:42,839 --> 00:05:44,719
who's used to appearing in line
with others' expectations.

52
00:05:45,559 --> 00:05:46,959
I'm afraid that if I walk up to you

53
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,719
and see a disappointed look
on your face,

54
00:05:49,239 --> 00:05:50,439
it will affect my mood.

55
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,439
Why are you here?

56
00:06:01,439 --> 00:06:02,439
I have something to tell you.

57
00:06:02,799 --> 00:06:03,559
Can't you tell me over the phone?

58
00:06:03,559 --> 00:06:04,679
I was afraid you'd hang up.

59
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:09,079
Go on, say it.

60
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:13,719
Why did you propose to Kong Yang here?

61
00:06:15,399 --> 00:06:16,839
I don't mean anything by it.

62
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,639
I just suddenly thought of something

63
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,799
and wanted to verify it.

64
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:28,319
If you don't want to tell me,
then forget it.

65
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,559
I can press you for answers
any other time,

66
00:06:30,119 --> 00:06:32,159
but today,
I can be a considerate person.

67
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,719
Kong Yang doesn't like deserts.

68
00:06:33,719 --> 00:06:35,919
She's not used to this climate.

69
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,159
But I'm the opposite.

70
00:06:38,719 --> 00:06:41,439
I've loved deserts since I was little.

71
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,079
Maybe

72
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:45,919
she guessed

73
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,919
that I wanted to propose to her
in the desert.

74
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,239
So, she compromised with me.

75
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:57,319
She always told me
she wanted me to take her camping,

76
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,359
with our friends along.

77
00:07:01,239 --> 00:07:02,559
So, I wanted to set up a campsite

78
00:07:02,559 --> 00:07:03,679
in the desert

79
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:05,519
and surprise her.

80
00:07:11,239 --> 00:07:13,039
Setting up a campsite in the desert

81
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:14,439
is not something you can do alone,
right?

82
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,439
You need to discuss it
with others beforehand.

83
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:19,279
So, those stories about you

84
00:07:19,279 --> 00:07:20,879
wanting to set a campsite
in Goose Head Dunes

85
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,599
and being opposed by the team members

86
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,759
were all fabricated, right?

87
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,559
Yes.

88
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,439
No one opposed it.

89
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,079
They all helped me brainstorm ideas.

90
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:38,879
They were coming up with plans.

91
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,239
They've been a big help.

92
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:42,359
What about the online rumors

93
00:07:42,839 --> 00:07:44,359
saying you had a dispute
with the team members?

94
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:48,639
I need to take more photos
and post them on Weibo.

95
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:50,479
The online arguments
are getting too intense.

96
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:52,399
I need to get the truth
out there quickly.

97
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:54,039
The head of Camelia told me

98
00:07:55,679 --> 00:07:57,439
that the crossing
of the four major no man's lands

99
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,959
had garnered a lot of attention.

100
00:07:58,959 --> 00:08:01,119
If we just mindlessly
move forward in our journey,

101
00:08:01,119 --> 00:08:03,279
there wouldn't be
any topics or attention.

102
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:06,079
He wanted to keep creating topics,

103
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:07,119
injecting conflicts,

104
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,039
and finally, use my proposal as a twist.

105
00:08:15,719 --> 00:08:17,239
I just wanted to lead the team well.

106
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,439
I didn't want
to get involved in those things.

107
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:22,799
As for their early-stage planning

108
00:08:23,079 --> 00:08:24,639
and their desired effects,

109
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:25,759
I didn't care about that.

110
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,839
It's up to him.

111
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,159
Then...

112
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:32,879
Then the sandstorm came.

113
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,519
Normally,

114
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,959
there's a period of time

115
00:08:37,959 --> 00:08:39,239
between the start of the wind
and the actual arrival of the sandstorm.

116
00:08:40,839 --> 00:08:42,359
But that day was different.

117
00:08:43,439 --> 00:08:44,119
Run!

118
00:08:44,119 --> 00:08:45,559
It was a complete destruction.

119
00:08:48,439 --> 00:08:50,479
The moment I turned around and saw it,

120
00:08:50,479 --> 00:08:51,319
I knew

121
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,519
that there was no escape.

122
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,119
Why won't you tell the truth?

123
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,079
I did tell the truth.

124
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,039
No one believed it.

125
00:09:02,999 --> 00:09:04,199
A sandstorm

126
00:09:04,439 --> 00:09:06,159
completely flattened an entire sand dune.

127
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:10,479
I have one more question.

128
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:12,639
You have too many questions.

129
00:09:12,639 --> 00:09:14,399
Why did you
mistake me for Kong Yang earlier?

130
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:22,759
I zoned out for a moment.

131
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:23,839
Oh, all of a sudden?

132
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:25,599
Didn't you lose your memory
all of a sudden too?

133
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:27,119
Chang Dong.

134
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:29,799
I have no interest

135
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:31,319
in your relationship with Kong Yang.

136
00:09:31,319 --> 00:09:32,799
Get this right.

137
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:35,159
We didn't just meet by chance.

138
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,119
The pictures in the camera

139
00:09:37,119 --> 00:09:38,399
are of your deceased girlfriend.

140
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,239
I came to you because of that.

141
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,199
You hiding anything
is making things difficult for me.

142
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:44,479
I told you.

143
00:09:46,359 --> 00:09:47,279
I zoned out for a moment.

144
00:09:48,479 --> 00:09:49,799
What's wrong with you?

145
00:09:52,119 --> 00:09:53,719
Ye Liuxi, I'll say this again.

146
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,639
When trade falters, integrity prevails.

147
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:57,119
Every time we get into a conflict,
you get angry,

148
00:09:57,119 --> 00:09:58,439
not leaving any room for compromise.

149
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:01,359
Are you so sure

150
00:10:01,359 --> 00:10:02,639
that you won't need my help
in the future?

151
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,439
Can you help me tow my car?

152
00:10:10,359 --> 00:10:10,879
You should apologize to me first.

153
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:11,279
I'm sorry.

154
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,919
After you've apologized...

155
00:10:19,559 --> 00:10:20,359
Ye Liuxi.

156
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,239
Have some dignity.

157
00:10:23,879 --> 00:10:25,039
Don't talk to me.

158
00:10:44,999 --> 00:10:45,919
What are you doing?

159
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:48,759
Sleeping.

160
00:10:50,199 --> 00:10:52,359
There's a big temperature difference
between day and night in the desert.

161
00:10:52,359 --> 00:10:54,319
If you sleep here, you'll die.

162
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:55,359
So, what should I do?

163
00:10:55,359 --> 00:10:57,159
My car broke down,
and my bed is in the car.

164
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,879
It's a long walk back.

165
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:00,519
Can't you hitch a ride with me then?

166
00:11:00,879 --> 00:11:01,879
I have my pride.

167
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:06,679
You told me not to talk to you,
didn't you?

168
00:11:25,919 --> 00:11:26,999
Where is your car?

169
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:33,959
Get in my car.

170
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:51,279
(Dalpur boundary stone)

171
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:53,639
Back then,

172
00:11:54,199 --> 00:11:55,279
this expedition team leader

173
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:56,999
left a note for his team members,

174
00:11:56,999 --> 00:11:59,799
saying he was
heading east to find water,

175
00:12:00,719 --> 00:12:02,839
but he never came back after that.

176
00:12:04,119 --> 00:12:05,919
Since then, whenever
people passed by here,

177
00:12:05,919 --> 00:12:07,559
they'd leave a bottle of water
as a habit.

178
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,239
From here on, it's like a dividing line.

179
00:12:12,239 --> 00:12:13,279
If we go deeper,

180
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,519
we'll have to rely on ourselves.

181
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:17,399
The no man's land's weather
and environment are unpredictable.

182
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,439
(Dalpur boundary stone)
To venture here,

183
00:12:18,439 --> 00:12:19,759
- Let's go.
- we must be well-prepared.

184
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,479
Bring all the equipment,
get a professional guide,

185
00:12:22,759 --> 00:12:23,679
and protect ourselves.

186
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:48,359
I took care
to avoid the salt-crusted road,

187
00:12:48,479 --> 00:12:50,559
but your car didn't make it after all.

188
00:12:50,559 --> 00:12:52,319
I told you before,
but you wouldn't listen.

189
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:55,039
Let's take it as a gift for Dalpur.

190
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,279
Then let's leave it here.

191
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,919
Hey, are these grains of salt?

192
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,319
This doesn't look like a salt flat.

193
00:13:04,319 --> 00:13:06,359
At most, it's just a salt marsh.

194
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:09,319
In two more years,
when the salt crust dries out,

195
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:10,639
it'll become a salt flat.

196
00:13:11,039 --> 00:13:12,799
Look over there.

197
00:13:12,799 --> 00:13:13,959
That white patch

198
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,479
is the infamous tire killer.

199
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,439
When a car passes over it,

200
00:13:17,439 --> 00:13:19,519
it's like being gnawed away
by a carpet of sharp teeth.

201
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:21,759
Even the best tires
will lose their tread.

202
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:23,159
All that white stuff, is that salt?

203
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:24,879
You can taste it if you want.

204
00:13:25,599 --> 00:13:27,279
Alright, pack your belongings.

205
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,199
You can take either of these two cars.

206
00:13:30,319 --> 00:13:32,919
Fatty Tang,
I'll inflate your tires later.

207
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:37,119
Liuxi, why don't you ride with me?

208
00:13:37,119 --> 00:13:38,479
It has cool air-conditioning.

209
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,119
Okay.

210
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,039
Let me help you with your stuff, then.

211
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,239
Make sure nothing is left behind.

212
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:44,599
If you leave anything behind,

213
00:13:44,599 --> 00:13:45,839
there's no one to fetch it for you.

214
00:13:46,919 --> 00:13:47,439
Sure.

215
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:49,399
I don't have anything valuable anyway.

216
00:15:02,199 --> 00:15:04,039
Holy cow.

217
00:15:05,439 --> 00:15:07,119
It's really here.

218
00:15:09,559 --> 00:15:11,079
Thank you, my Lord, for blessing us.

219
00:15:11,079 --> 00:15:12,359
Thanks to our ancestors
for rewarding us with this treasure.

220
00:15:12,359 --> 00:15:13,479
Thanks for making my dream come true.

221
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,959
And thanks to myself.

222
00:15:15,919 --> 00:15:17,519
Had we not been
in this godforsaken place,

223
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,359
I could have run away with you by now.

224
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,199
I could have retired early.

225
00:15:37,479 --> 00:15:38,519
Ye Liuxi.

226
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,839
Don't set foot in the salt flat.

227
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:42,399
Huh? Ouch!

228
00:15:47,919 --> 00:15:50,599
I can't believe I'd be
the first to get wounded in Dalpur.

229
00:15:58,719 --> 00:15:59,759
Let me help you.

230
00:16:27,439 --> 00:16:28,719
Keep your hands off it.

231
00:16:33,239 --> 00:16:35,039
You need to take good care
of this wound.

232
00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:38,559
The salt here
contains various trace elements,

233
00:16:39,599 --> 00:16:41,359
so wounds heal slower here.

234
00:16:41,799 --> 00:16:42,879
In other words,

235
00:16:43,399 --> 00:16:44,239
it's worse than being cut with a knife.

236
00:16:44,319 --> 00:16:45,719
Got it.

237
00:16:54,599 --> 00:16:55,559
What happened?

238
00:16:58,359 --> 00:16:59,039
Are you okay?

239
00:16:59,039 --> 00:16:59,919
No, I'm not.

240
00:17:00,599 --> 00:17:00,999
Come on.

241
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:02,959
- Don't move.
- Place this stick for me.

242
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:04,039
Stick it in there.

243
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,999
When we come here next time,
I'll destroy this place.

244
00:17:07,759 --> 00:17:08,559
Alright.

245
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,679
You're really going to do it, huh?

246
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,519
Hurry up and inflate your tires.

247
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:21,039
Liuxi, Dong won't let me do it.

248
00:17:22,399 --> 00:17:23,519
Bear with it.

249
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:51,099
Hey.

250
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:56,319
You're pressing on my wound.

251
00:18:33,119 --> 00:18:33,919
It's done.

252
00:18:47,639 --> 00:18:49,799
Liuxi, this soup you made
is so delicious.

253
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:50,439
Fatty Tang.

254
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:52,759
Bring me my bag.

255
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,719
If only we were in the city right now.

256
00:19:06,999 --> 00:19:09,159
I would sell you and get a facelift.

257
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:09,959
No one would recognize me.

258
00:19:09,959 --> 00:19:12,159
I could live like a rich person.

259
00:19:13,079 --> 00:19:15,199
But too bad, only Chang Dong
knows the way around here.

260
00:19:15,199 --> 00:19:17,159
Otherwise, I'd really
sell you for money.

261
00:19:19,639 --> 00:19:20,439
Liuxi.

262
00:19:36,599 --> 00:19:37,679
How beautiful.

263
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,239
Let's go to sleep.

264
00:19:55,639 --> 00:19:56,999
Dong, it's okay, I've got this.

265
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:58,639
Let me do this.

266
00:20:26,399 --> 00:20:27,199
What are you doing?

267
00:20:27,199 --> 00:20:29,039
Looks like a sandstorm is coming.
It's better to zip it up.

268
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:30,359
A sandstorm?

269
00:20:32,359 --> 00:20:33,399
Will it kill us?

270
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:36,039
No, we're not in the desert.

271
00:20:36,039 --> 00:20:37,679
It's just a storm of dust.

272
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:40,039
Why did you mistake me for Kong Yang?

273
00:20:45,999 --> 00:20:47,639
If we make good time,

274
00:20:47,639 --> 00:20:49,839
we'll be able to reach Seadragon Heap
by tomorrow night.

275
00:20:51,279 --> 00:20:53,319
There must be
some kind of connection between us two.

276
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:54,879
But right now,

277
00:20:54,879 --> 00:20:56,279
you haven't a clue,
and I have no memory of it.

278
00:20:56,599 --> 00:20:58,159
If we want to move on from here,

279
00:20:58,159 --> 00:20:59,599
we have to work together.

280
00:21:00,079 --> 00:21:01,799
Can't we be more frank with each other?

281
00:21:11,999 --> 00:21:12,799
Alright.

282
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,159
In that case,

283
00:21:14,319 --> 00:21:15,279
let's start with you.

284
00:21:23,439 --> 00:21:24,879
Everything I know is here.

285
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:29,759
I've written down all of these
over the past couple of years.

286
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,999
All natural. No plastic surgery.

287
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:47,639
It's that obvious?

288
00:21:49,159 --> 00:21:50,959
I've seen it in TV shows.

289
00:21:50,959 --> 00:21:52,359
The female lead loses her memory

290
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,999
and the mastermind controls her

291
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,359
to get close to someone for his agenda.

292
00:21:58,199 --> 00:21:59,359
(Can fight. Mixed martial arts.)
That's clearly not the case.

293
00:22:01,519 --> 00:22:03,719
Can fight, but no real technique.

294
00:22:03,719 --> 00:22:05,759
Probably from
a mixed martial arts background.

295
00:22:05,759 --> 00:22:06,759
Meaning to say I'm a street fighter.

296
00:22:07,439 --> 00:22:08,599
I've checked.

297
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,039
I don't belong to any martial art type.

298
00:22:10,439 --> 00:22:12,639
Family. Heartless or dead.

299
00:22:13,199 --> 00:22:15,599
Friends. Disloyal or dead.

300
00:22:15,999 --> 00:22:18,479
Boyfriend. Lousy or dead.

301
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:21,679
I've been missing for so long,

302
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:22,999
but no one came looking for me.

303
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:25,959
There wasn't even
a missing person's notice.

304
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:36,439
There's a branding scar
on my right ankle.

305
00:22:36,439 --> 00:22:37,279
I wonder

306
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,919
what deep grudge they had against me.

307
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:42,039
Can't they just beat me up?

308
00:22:42,079 --> 00:22:43,599
Why must they brand me

309
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:44,679
with such an ugly scar?

310
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:46,279
(Who did this? You're dead!)
So childish.

311
00:22:46,279 --> 00:22:46,879
(Who did this? You're dead!)

312
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:50,519
(A cold assasin!)
You've got a typo.

313
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,439
Are you done reading?

314
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,759
Had very bad taste.

315
00:22:58,039 --> 00:22:59,679
Good to see you recognize your flaws.

316
00:23:01,119 --> 00:23:02,279
See for yourself.

317
00:23:03,439 --> 00:23:04,559
Isn't this hideous?

318
00:23:06,479 --> 00:23:09,079
It's like a mix
of a dragon, a snake, and eagle claws

319
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:12,719
with a few strands of hair on the head.

320
00:23:12,959 --> 00:23:14,919
It's so weird and ugly.

321
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:21,959
Sheep's Horn Cup.

322
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,239
Actually,

323
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:38,239
I mistook you for Kong Yang at first.

324
00:23:38,279 --> 00:23:40,239
It's not wrong
to say it was a momentary lapse.

325
00:23:41,639 --> 00:23:42,839
You and her

326
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:44,839
have quite similar figures.

327
00:23:51,119 --> 00:23:51,919
So,

328
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,279
I wasn't very surprised

329
00:23:56,479 --> 00:23:58,039
to see you appear.

330
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:03,679
When the sandstorm hit

331
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,159
Goose Head Dunes that day,

332
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:07,719
I was saved.

333
00:24:08,479 --> 00:24:11,319
I had arranged a driver in advance,

334
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:13,639
thinking to pick up Kong Yang

335
00:24:13,639 --> 00:24:14,959
the next morning.

336
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,279
He lived at the mining site

337
00:24:18,959 --> 00:24:21,279
that's about a two-hour drive
from the dune.

338
00:24:22,999 --> 00:24:24,359
That night,

339
00:24:24,999 --> 00:24:26,519
the mining site was also affected.

340
00:24:28,119 --> 00:24:29,639
So, early in the next moring,

341
00:24:30,439 --> 00:24:32,479
the driver rushed over.

342
00:24:33,479 --> 00:24:34,479
Along the way,

343
00:24:36,039 --> 00:24:37,839
he couldn't
get through the satellite phone

344
00:24:38,719 --> 00:24:39,959
and felt somthing was off.

345
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:42,559
So, he called for help in advance.

346
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:43,599
Someone's there!

347
00:24:46,679 --> 00:24:49,119
At that time,
the rescue team captain said

348
00:24:49,399 --> 00:24:50,199
We can save him.

349
00:24:50,839 --> 00:24:51,839
it was a miracle.

350
00:24:56,679 --> 00:24:57,879
With the massive sandstorm,

351
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,359
even cars

352
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:01,479
were buried and couldn't be found.

353
00:25:02,239 --> 00:25:04,199
The entire camp
was completely destroyed,

354
00:25:05,959 --> 00:25:07,279
let alone people.

355
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:10,639
Yet, they managed to save one person

356
00:25:11,479 --> 00:25:12,359
who lived.

357
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:15,399
No one believed it.

358
00:25:20,279 --> 00:25:21,799
One evening,

359
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,879
I was lying on the hospital bed

360
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,599
and suddenly remembered

361
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:30,599
after the sandstorm had ended

362
00:25:31,239 --> 00:25:32,679
and before the rescue team arrived,

363
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,239
I saw a group of people.

364
00:25:41,839 --> 00:25:43,599
I thought it was them.

365
00:25:45,599 --> 00:25:46,679
It was Kong Yang.

366
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:49,999
They died

367
00:25:51,439 --> 00:25:52,559
and were about to leave.

368
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,519
Why didn't

369
00:26:01,519 --> 00:26:03,159
you tell the investigators about this?

370
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:05,919
What do I tell them?

371
00:26:07,879 --> 00:26:10,159
Even I myself
wasn't sure if it was a dream,

372
00:26:11,399 --> 00:26:12,879
or if I was conscious at that time.

373
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:16,679
I later thought

374
00:26:17,479 --> 00:26:19,079
that maybe they were

375
00:26:19,879 --> 00:26:21,359
saying goodbye to me.

376
00:26:23,439 --> 00:26:24,839
I even wondered

377
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:27,679
if they might have become lost souls

378
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,359
and were lingering around here.

379
00:26:35,359 --> 00:26:37,039
So, when that figure appeared,

380
00:26:38,999 --> 00:26:40,679
I was actually looking forward to it.

381
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:03,159
Alright.

382
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:04,639
Let's consider

383
00:27:05,239 --> 00:27:07,239
that we've come clean about our issues.

384
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:11,399
Let's live in peace together.

385
00:27:18,279 --> 00:27:19,119
Sure.

386
00:27:24,999 --> 00:27:25,799
Go rest.

387
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,319
You too.

388
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:29,159
We'll set off earlier tomorrow.

389
00:27:30,959 --> 00:27:32,159
Zip the door for me.

390
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:42,119
Chang Dong.

391
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,959
It's enough to be absent-minded once.

392
00:28:49,999 --> 00:28:50,799
Chang Dong.

393
00:28:52,479 --> 00:28:53,399
Chang Dong.

394
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:57,959
Chang Dong.

395
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:02,839
Fatty Tang.

396
00:29:03,439 --> 00:29:04,559
Fatty Tang!

397
00:29:04,959 --> 00:29:05,679
Come here!

398
00:29:07,399 --> 00:29:08,199
What's wrong?

399
00:29:08,879 --> 00:29:09,679
Chang Dong.

400
00:29:10,239 --> 00:29:11,039
Chang Dong.

401
00:29:11,999 --> 00:29:12,839
What's wrong?

402
00:29:15,079 --> 00:29:15,479
What happened?

403
00:29:15,479 --> 00:29:16,239
No heartbeat.

404
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:17,519
There's no heartbeat.

405
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:18,879
How did this happen?

406
00:29:18,879 --> 00:29:19,399
Dong.

407
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:19,999
Chang Dong.

408
00:29:20,079 --> 00:29:20,919
Dong.

409
00:29:21,639 --> 00:29:22,159
Dong.

410
00:29:22,439 --> 00:29:24,199
Do you know that?

411
00:29:24,199 --> 00:29:25,719
To save the heart.

412
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:27,679
The chest compressions. Can you do it?

413
00:29:28,439 --> 00:29:29,239
Chang Dong.

414
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:30,479
Chang Dong.

415
00:29:32,879 --> 00:29:33,679
Dong.

416
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:35,679
It's not working.

417
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,679
Liuxi, do we need to do CPR?

418
00:29:38,639 --> 00:29:39,519
You breathe into him.

419
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,199
I don't know how to.

420
00:29:40,199 --> 00:29:40,599
Quickly!

421
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,359
I don't know.

422
00:29:41,359 --> 00:29:41,919
Quick!

423
00:29:42,839 --> 00:29:43,679
Breathe.

424
00:29:45,079 --> 00:29:45,879
Chang Dong.

425
00:29:46,679 --> 00:29:47,479
Chang Dong.

426
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:49,599
Chang Dong.

427
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,599
Dong.

428
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:13,919
What happened?

429
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:15,879
Are you alright?

430
00:30:19,479 --> 00:30:21,119
Dong.

431
00:30:21,119 --> 00:30:23,119
Lie down and rest.

432
00:30:30,599 --> 00:30:31,399
Have some water.

433
00:30:35,999 --> 00:30:36,799
Dong.

434
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:39,479
You almost died.

435
00:30:39,479 --> 00:30:40,759
Do you feel better now

436
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:41,959
that you've rested?

437
00:30:41,959 --> 00:30:43,959
Do you have a heart condition?

438
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:46,039
Your heart stopped beating.

439
00:30:46,959 --> 00:30:49,999
No. I've never experienced anything
like this.

440
00:30:51,879 --> 00:30:53,399
Liuxi saved you.

441
00:31:00,239 --> 00:31:01,479
What's that sound?

442
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:15,839
Dong.

443
00:31:16,599 --> 00:31:18,399
Where's that sound coming from?

444
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,199
There.

445
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,599
Have we encountered robbers?

446
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:22,879
It's possible.

447
00:31:22,879 --> 00:31:24,799
Robberies have happened
in this area before.

448
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:27,319
They don't just target one place
and move along a path.

449
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:30,079
They've probably check this area out.

450
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:31,599
What should we do now?

451
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:33,799
Pack up our things

452
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:34,359
and go.

453
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:34,959
Let's go.

454
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:04,000
