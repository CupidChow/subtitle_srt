00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:43,700
=Episode 34=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,080
You don't look so good.

4
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:10,800
If you know you're dying,

5
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,630
you won't look good either.

6
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,590
Remember.

7
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:18,470
I didn't lose to you.

8
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,150
In this world,

9
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,120
apart from myself,

10
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:24,150
no one can kill me.

11
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,470
This woman

12
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,310
is cunning and evil.

13
00:03:12,190 --> 00:03:13,340
We have to guard against her.

14
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,870
Ye Liuxi is dead.

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,190
"In the duel of the twin Zhi,

16
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:02,230
"Qing's spirit will soar like a dragon?"

17
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:04,840
In the end, I still won.

18
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,950
The thing about playing dead,

19
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,630
I've mastered it
when I was still a beggar.

20
00:04:49,630 --> 00:04:51,430
I mastered it deeply too.

21
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:53,000
Scared a lot of people.

22
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,870
You must've been happy to see me dead.

23
00:04:57,190 --> 00:04:59,480
Remember this feeling.

24
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,720
After all, from now on,

25
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:03,950
you'll never taste this feeling again.

26
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,120
Ye Liuxi.

27
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,070
Kill me if you dare.

28
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,630
Your lover will die with me.

29
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:12,070
You'd better not push your luck.

30
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,360
It'll make things easier for you.

31
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:15,120
I'm not going to kill you.

32
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,430
I'm not as cruel as you are.

33
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:22,510
Let Miss Long go.

34
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:31,600
Out my way!

35
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,240
Stand your ground!

36
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,040
Stop shouting.

37
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,460
Your artery's still fine.
Your leg's not broken.

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,750
I just want to loosen you up.

39
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:39,390
Out of my way.

40
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,390
Move away.

41
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,870
Everyone, move away.

42
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:42,800
Move away.

43
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,400
No one can take away

44
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,630
what belongs to the Long family.

45
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560
After her!

46
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Yes.

47
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
My biggest wish in this life

48
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,000
is to be successful.

49
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,070
But now,

50
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,190
I'm a fugitive.

51
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:02,920
He.

52
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:05,720
We've offended Feather Guards.

53
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,630
Where do we go now?

54
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,040
Quick. After her.

55
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:19,720
Look.

56
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,630
It's Miss Ye.

57
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,190
Quick, drive.

58
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:50,790
Open the window.

59
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,550
Miss Ye.

60
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:55,910
I...

61
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:15,550
Look out, Miss Ye.

62
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,390
Faster.

63
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:18,200
Faster.

64
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:19,750
He.

65
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:21,790
Open up the window. Quickly.

66
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:26,720
Let me drive.

67
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,120
(Water-Devouring Swamp)

68
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,600
Where's your left hand, Miss Ye?

69
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:01,670
Lost it.

70
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,120
You lost...

71
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,480
Hold on tight.

72
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:30,480
Oh my God.

73
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,080
Miss Ye.

74
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,720
The ground ate the Feather Guards' car.

75
00:10:35,670 --> 00:10:37,320
What is that thing?

76
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:38,870
Water-Devouring Swamp.

77
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,240
You seem to know this place well.

78
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:43,440
Whenever I go in or out of the pass,

79
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:45,440
I'd check things out here.

80
00:10:45,510 --> 00:10:47,440
I can travel this place
with my eyes closed.

81
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,270
Miss Ye, since you know this place,

82
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:52,440
does it mean

83
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,960
we can find an escape

84
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,550
and get out of this place?

85
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:57,840
The deepest part of this place
is the salt beast's home.

86
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:01,240
This place is a big ring-shaped wetland.

87
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:03,720
It's our only way in.

88
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,200
If Feather Guards surround this place,

89
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,790
we're done for, then?

90
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,390
That's right.

91
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,910
Then we shouldn't pick this path.

92
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,960
We should've just

93
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:18,030
gone with a random path.

94
00:11:18,030 --> 00:11:20,120
We'd probably be out by now.

95
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:22,150
Even so, we can't escape Feather Guards.

96
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,720
I know this is a dead end,

97
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,670
but we don't have a choice.

98
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,550
How did you guys escape?

99
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,310
When everything went to hell.

100
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,720
We saw this car and stole it.

101
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,790
Let's go, go.

102
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:07,790
He.

103
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:11,150
We have to follow Chang Dong's orders.

104
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,310
He told us

105
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:14,640
to run when everything's in chaos.

106
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,310
You can see what's going on now.

107
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,360
Even if you risk your life,

108
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:22,030
it won't change anything.

109
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,310
You know that.

110
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,550
Let's go, He.

111
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:27,240
He.

112
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:31,390
We have to escape
if we want to stand a chance.

113
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:32,670
Let's go.

114
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:41,670
What are you doing?

115
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:44,910
(When we stole this car,)

116
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,270
(there wasn't a key in it.)

117
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:48,840
(It was at this moment,
one of Zhao Guanshou's men showed up.)

118
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,030
(He scared us a lot.)

119
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,240
(I thought we were done for.)

120
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,120
But not only did he not catch us,

121
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:56,960
he even gave us this key.

122
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,030
On my way here,

123
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,520
I've been wondering why he did that.

124
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,270
I don't think we're friends with him.

125
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,240
Is it possible

126
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,910
that Zhao Guanshou sent him?

127
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:10,790
Li Jin'ao.

128
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:13,670
Lend me Valley Guardian.

129
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,120
No problem.

130
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:16,190
Valley Guardian.

131
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:19,480
Do you remember Zhao Guanshou's looks?

132
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:31,190
Miss Long.

133
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,910
I have to clean this wound.

134
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:35,520
You have to take your bracelet off,

135
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:36,910
or stitching will be hard.

136
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,850
Have you surrounded Water-Devouring Swamp?

137
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:57,840
Miss Long Zhi.

138
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,840
Here's the case.

139
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,790
We have surrounded the outer ring,

140
00:14:00,790 --> 00:14:01,960
but we've checked the map.

141
00:14:02,030 --> 00:14:04,150
The swamp's depth
is more than ten kilometers deep.

142
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:06,120
It's a treacherous land.

143
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,190
And,

144
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:09,030
no marks can be left on the ground.

145
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,220
We have no way

146
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,190
to accurately
pinpoint Ye Liuxi's position.

147
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:13,310
Leave.

148
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:22,480
How is it?

149
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:26,240
Don't worry.

150
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,320
Ye Liuxi picked a random path
in desperation.

151
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,120
She's stuck in Water-Devouring Swamp.

152
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,640
It's the Flowing Sand dunes' dead end.

153
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,030
She cannot escape.

154
00:14:35,910 --> 00:14:38,000
We still control the situation.

155
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,270
Once we capture her,

156
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:42,790
I'll first break her limbs,

157
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:45,520
then I'll kill her slowly.

158
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,880
But,

159
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,000
this swamp is hard to enter.

160
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,120
If we send scouts,

161
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,480
they'll die.

162
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,390
Falcon Guards
are Black Stone City's elites.

163
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,600
We'll avoid casualties, of course.

164
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:03,120
This world

165
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:06,150
has a lot of people who hate Ye Liuxi.

166
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,390
I don't need to send scouts.

167
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,840
No point wasting our own people.

168
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,910
You are thinking of Scorpion Eye?

169
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,360
Ye Liuxi has lost a hand.

170
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:18,960
She has also regained her memories.

171
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:20,520
If at this moment,

172
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:23,030
Scorpion Eye's men
come in contact with her,

173
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:24,190
there will be chaos.

174
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,840
Not to worry.

175
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,070
In all of Scorpion Eye,

176
00:15:29,150 --> 00:15:30,880
Jiang Zhan
is the only one who knows her.

177
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,520
Besides,

178
00:15:33,270 --> 00:15:35,310
we're going to destroy Scorpion Eye
someday anyway.

179
00:15:36,430 --> 00:15:38,480
Two birds with one stone.

180
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,840
Use the substitute tongue
and contact Scorpion Eye.

181
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,720
Tell them

182
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,760
Ye Liuxi, Jiang Zhan's killer,

183
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:50,070
is hiding in the swamp.

184
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:50,910
Yes.

185
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,310
Miss Long.

186
00:15:55,310 --> 00:15:56,600
Before I stitch the wound,

187
00:15:57,310 --> 00:15:58,790
I'll have to use some anesthetic.

188
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,550
No need.

189
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:02,550
Just stitch the wound.

190
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:04,270
Very well.

191
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,600
For Scorpion Eye to come here,

192
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,760
how long will it take?

193
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,880
At best, twelve hours to a day.

194
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:21,120
At worst, two to three days.

195
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:23,880
After Jiang Zhan's accident,

196
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,240
some of the leaders refuse me.

197
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,670
They want to be the big boss.

198
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:30,240
Anyone who kills Ye Liuxi

199
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,310
will get a big credit.

200
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,390
Maybe they're fighting over who gets it

201
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:36,640
while they're on the way here.

202
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:53,270
Go.

203
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,190
They went over there. After them.

204
00:16:59,150 --> 00:16:59,670
Go.

205
00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,430
Team One, go here.

206
00:17:01,430 --> 00:17:02,360
Team Two, go there.

207
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:09,590
What happened?

208
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,520
Someone ambushed us.

209
00:17:10,790 --> 00:17:12,830
Our men split into four teams
and went after them.

210
00:17:13,110 --> 00:17:13,680
Sir.

211
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,440
He and Li Jin'ao ambushed the guards,

212
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:16,790
took the car, and ran away.

213
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,480
Everything else is as usual.

214
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,110
Only your tent is attacked.

215
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,720
Is it really a coincidence?

216
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:09,110
The Silver Silkworms Heartstring
is gone.

217
00:18:09,920 --> 00:18:11,870
Someone must've stolen it
during the commotion.

218
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:14,310
It must be the spy among us.

219
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,520
Lock this medical tent down.

220
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:19,720
The item must still be around.

221
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,480
Yes.

222
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Summon everyone.

223
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:34,000
I'm searching one by one.

224
00:18:41,270 --> 00:18:41,960
Mr. Zhao.

225
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:43,720
What is it?

226
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,240
Li Jin'ao and He

227
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,350
were guarded by your men.

228
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,960
So you're suspecting me?

229
00:18:54,830 --> 00:18:56,480
When the chaos went underway,

230
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:58,340
there was no one else in the tent.

231
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:01,590
Fine.

232
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:02,870
Search me too, then.

233
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:05,270
Search him.

234
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,200
I said search him.

235
00:19:27,070 --> 00:19:27,870
There's nothing.

236
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:33,630
We're searching everyone.

237
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:35,160
No one's getting away.

238
00:20:07,070 --> 00:20:07,870
Miss Long.

239
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:08,920
We've searched everywhere,

240
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,870
but we found nothing.

241
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,160
Keep looking for it.

242
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,350
Overturn this place, I don't care.

243
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:18,680
Just find the item.

244
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,270
Yes.

245
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:34,030
Wonder if that rooster's reliable.

246
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,400
Why is there a rooster here?

247
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:49,000
Quick.

248
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,550
Get it and we can
make chicken soup tonight.

249
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:51,270
Okay.

250
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,480
Grab the neck.

251
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,590
What are you doing?

252
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,000
Sir.

253
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,110
There's a rooster here.

254
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:04,160
We're going to slaughter it
and cook it for the men.

255
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Leave. The rooster is mine.

256
00:21:08,590 --> 00:21:09,400
Yes.

257
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,310
(The hemotoxin you bought in the black market
was just a coincidence?)

258
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:41,720
(Your illness can't wait.)

259
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,310
I shipped this in
from outside the pass today.

260
00:21:44,350 --> 00:21:45,400
Just accept it.

261
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,720
There are no permanent friends

262
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:49,310
nor permanent enemies.

263
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:51,750
You can consider this

264
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,030
as an incomplete transaction.

265
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,160
(Perhaps someday in the future,)

266
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:57,070
(you will need to use it for yourself)

267
00:21:57,350 --> 00:21:58,880
(or even for Black Stone City)

268
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:00,200
(as a safeguard.)

269
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,550
(I'll go to that medical tent
in a moment.)

270
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:27,680
(I'll signal you.)

271
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,640
Valley Guardian.

272
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:16,160
Valley Guardian.

273
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,000
My goodness.

274
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,880
Valley Guardian.

275
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,680
You actually succeeded.

276
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,850
The Silver Silkworms Heartstring.

277
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,200
(Ying City)

278
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:21,920
Have some water.

279
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:31,070
I know you've been worried
about Gao Shen, right?

280
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,720
You must also often
think about He, right?

281
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,200
Yes.

282
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:46,590
Believe in Liuxi.

283
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,640
Long Zhi is currently
holding Gao Shen hostage.

284
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,440
As long as Liuxi is alive,

285
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,720
Gao Shen will stay alive.

286
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:58,880
Zhao Guanshou will help
once he gets the hemotoxin.

287
00:24:59,510 --> 00:25:01,580
At that time, I suppose he
won't cause trouble for He.

288
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,440
When Liuxi returns,

289
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,240
it would be great if
she can bring He along.

290
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:11,720
Dong's heartstring
has a nine-month deadline.

291
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:13,000
Liuxi has recovered her memory now.

292
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,510
She must have a way to escape.

293
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,590
Then, we'll have Long Zhi
extend Dong's life.

294
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,830
Dong will definitely get better.

295
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:31,880
Although the injury to your back
is quite severe,

296
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,160
it hasn't harmed any organs.

297
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:36,110
So, you should fully recover
after resting for half a month.

298
00:25:37,550 --> 00:25:39,400
Also, all the indicators of your body

299
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:41,110
in the checkup results are normal.

300
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:41,920
You may be discharged.

301
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,270
Really, Doctor?

302
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:45,960
He almost died before.

303
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,790
Is this normal?

304
00:25:49,550 --> 00:25:50,960
You mean his heart, right?

305
00:25:51,830 --> 00:25:54,000
This is his CCTA scan.

306
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,350
From the images,

307
00:25:56,110 --> 00:25:57,720
there doesn't seem to be any problem.

308
00:25:58,110 --> 00:25:58,960
The patient now

309
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,720
doesn't have any
discomforting symptoms either.

310
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,720
But we've noticed

311
00:26:02,070 --> 00:26:03,200
there's some reason

312
00:26:04,070 --> 00:26:06,720
seemingly affecting the normal functioning
of the patient's heart.

313
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,830
After our observation
during this period,

314
00:26:09,830 --> 00:26:11,110
the patient's heart

315
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:13,240
seems to be gradually losing its power,

316
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,160
just like

317
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
an animal about to hibernate.

318
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,510
Hibernate?

319
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:18,070
Yes.

320
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,070
In the future, the patient

321
00:26:20,070 --> 00:26:21,400
might experience

322
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:22,790
severe bradycardia,

323
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,030
which might be fatal.

324
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:25,350
However,

325
00:26:25,350 --> 00:26:27,790
we've never seen this phenomenon before.

326
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:30,680
Whether more severe conditions will occur

327
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:31,960
remains to be further observed.

328
00:26:33,070 --> 00:26:34,000
Regarding this matter,

329
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:36,550
we will also get help from a specialist
from the provincial city.

330
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,790
If there are any
new developments in the future,

331
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:39,830
please stay in touch.

332
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:42,640
Alright then, thank you.

333
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:43,550
Thank you.

334
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,830
Strange.

335
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,400
Hibernation.

336
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,310
Maybe it's time.

337
00:26:54,590 --> 00:26:56,580
Why haven't either of you
been answering your phones?

338
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,000
What's wrong?

339
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,310
I went back and told Qi

340
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:00,640
about Liuxi and Yumen.

341
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,070
He sent someone to investigate,

342
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,790
and they found this video.

343
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,200
Look.

344
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:02,500
