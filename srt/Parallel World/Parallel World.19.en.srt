00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,760
=Episode 19=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,500
I've got him.

4
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,180
You all woke up so early.

5
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,060
Do you want
to discuss something with me?

6
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,020
Don't be nervous.

7
00:01:57,900 --> 00:01:58,700
Don't be nervous.

8
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,020
The thing is,

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:01,980
when I woke up this morning,

10
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:04,060
I discovered that my car keys

11
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:05,700
were inside this cloth bag.

12
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,460
However, I distinctly remember

13
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,060
that I've always kept my car keys
in my backpack.

14
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,380
This bag?

15
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,460
That's right.

16
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,580
It belonged to that Scorpion Eye guy.

17
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,780
Scorpion Eye?

18
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,900
What's inside the bag?

19
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,100
Oh, my goodness!

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:23,180
Geminus!

21
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:24,220
I recognize

22
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:25,020
this bag.

23
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,980
Geminus got sucked into this bag.

24
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:28,860
The exotic beast that has the ability
to mimic people?

25
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,820
Yes, that's right.

26
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,820
Still, you don't have
to be nervous about it.

27
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:33,220
Normally, Geminus

28
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,180
are just like mischievous kids
who like to scare people.

29
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,740
Though, you'd better pray not
to encounter the hostile ones.

30
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,420
Could this Geminus

31
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:42,660
have made contact
with the Scorpion Eye guy?

32
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,420
If members of the Scorpion Eye
are indeed present in this inn,

33
00:02:44,420 --> 00:02:46,300
and Geminus
has established contact with them,

34
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,500
it implies that the Scorpion Eye group

35
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,900
has also connected with that guy.

36
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,780
Will he seek revenge against us?

37
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,660
We have to go.

38
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,460
Pack the things up.

39
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,860
If there's nothing else,
I'll also take my leave.

40
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,820
Sure, you may go.

41
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,180
Who's leaving?

42
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,420
Who's leaving?

43
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:13,460
I just went to the toilet. What's wrong?

44
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,020
Liu. Hold him.

45
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,300
You're the one responsible
for that bald spot on my head.

46
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,020
Liu.

47
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:13,540
Quit making a scene.

48
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,140
Hurry.

49
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,220
Did that thing just mimic me?

50
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:25,020
It's okay now.

51
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,380
This time,

52
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:29,620
you'd better keep it properly.

53
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:32,860
Uncle Ao.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:35,420
You're aged but skilled.

55
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:38,460
Fatty Tang.

56
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,940
You're leaving it to me?

57
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:43,940
Do you want

58
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:45,700
to train Geminus to become obedient?

59
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:47,340
If you want to train it,

60
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,140
spend more time with it

61
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,420
and feed it some fruits.

62
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,900
Once it's fully trained,

63
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,460
it will follow your instructions.

64
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,860
Alright, you should leave too.

65
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,060
Our whereabouts might have been
discovered by Scorpion Eye.

66
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,380
It's too dangerous for you
to be with us.

67
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,220
Take care of yourself, then. Stay safe.

68
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:13,500
Dared to mimic me?

69
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,180
I’d like to check out.

70
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,060
Could you please open the garage door?

71
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,860
Someone will open it for you outside.

72
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,420
Just drive the car out.

73
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,260
Come on, give it to me.

74
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,940
You go upstairs first.

75
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,020
Check what's happening outside.

76
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,540
We'll split up
and meet at the parking lot.

77
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,940
Stay safe.

78
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:48,260
Let's go.

79
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,700
Get out of the car. Hold your breath.

80
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,260
Out.

81
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,860
Out.

82
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,740
I can't move.

83
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,740
Keep an eye on them.

84
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:32,900
Drag them back into the inn.

85
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,900
Take all of them in.

86
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:45,540
Stop right there.

87
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,540
There's still a woman here.

88
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:49,260
Seize her.

89
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,620
Please stop.

90
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:18,980
You must be Miss Qingzhi, right?

91
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,580
What are you trying to do?

92
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,900
This is really a misunderstanding.

93
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:25,420
We have received information

94
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:27,180
that our adversaries would be
coming here in the past few days.

95
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:28,940
I hope this hasn't inconvenienced you.

96
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,220
Miss Qingzhi.

97
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,100
It's truly a misunderstanding.

98
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:32,780
In the presence of Lord Zhan,

99
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,860
you must help us

100
00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:35,060
to explain things properly.

101
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,340
I thought I had concealed myself well.

102
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,660
I didn't expect to get recognized.

103
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:48,860
This is troublesome.

104
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:51,020
How did you recognize me?

105
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,780
Miss Qingzhi.

106
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,260
Although no one
besides Lord Zhan has seen you,

107
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,220
we all know

108
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,980
you have the same tattoo as him.

109
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,020
Given your skills and stature,

110
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,460
who else could it
possibly be besides you?

111
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:05,700
You...

112
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,340
You must be Miss Qingzhi, right?

113
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,500
Lift them up.

114
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:10,980
Right.

115
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,660
What are you waiting for?

116
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,380
Hurry. Lift them up.

117
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,180
Quick.

118
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,100
Steady yourselves.

119
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:19,900
You. Come here.

120
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:22,300
Do me a favor.

121
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,020
Your orders, please.

122
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,980
Get me five customs clearance documents.

123
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:26,940
Okay.

124
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:41,820
Stop the car.

125
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,980
Liu, distribute these.

126
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,380
The Scorpion Eye guy
is quite skilled in forging.

127
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:52,660
He even placed official stamps on these.

128
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,900
The Scorpion Eye guy just mentioned

129
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,940
that the border security checks
at Black Stone City are strict,

130
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,340
and there's no assurance
of an absolute clearance.

131
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,460
Liuxi.

132
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,020
Why did they address you
as Miss Qingzhi?

133
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,060
How would I know?

134
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,740
That's strange.

135
00:09:05,740 --> 00:09:07,220
Why didn't
that wretched Scorpion Eye guy

136
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,700
from earlier call you by Liuxi

137
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,100
and instead addressed you
as Miss Qingzhi?

138
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:12,020
Alright, enough.

139
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:13,980
Anyhow, we didn't suffer any losses.

140
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,900
With this,
we can enter Black Stone City.

141
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:54,040
(Welcome Lake Crossing)

142
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:16,500
What's written on it?

143
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,060
Welcome Gate.

144
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,260
I don't see any gate here.

145
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:32,080
(Welcome)

146
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,780
What's going on here?

147
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,340
This place seems like a crossing.

148
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:40,060
Look at that lake.

149
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,260
Living creatures are being struck dead
by lightning.

150
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,100
Could this be a ghostly crossing?

151
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:46,220
Maybe a haunted ship
will arrive here shortly.

152
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,860
Don't scare yourself in broad daylight.

153
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:50,980
Dong.

154
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:52,820
Look at this.

155
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,100
Don't touch it.

156
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,100
These things look like offerings.

157
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,020
They seem edible, though.

158
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,860
Liuxi, look. Are those waterspouts?

159
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,820
If we force our way through the lake,

160
00:11:07,820 --> 00:11:09,260
we'll either get sucked into a whirlpool

161
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,420
or get struck by lightning.

162
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,780
Something is coming out of the lake.

163
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:22,100
Liuxi, this place is creepy.

164
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:23,500
Should we leave?

165
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,060
What's up there?

166
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:26,700
Let's leave.

167
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,780
Let's go.

168
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,580
Is that the next dock?

169
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:59,140
Why does it look so similar
to the one we just left?

170
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,500
Let me take a look.

171
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,540
Over there.

172
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:38,820
Isn't this the one I split open?

173
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,020
No way.

174
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:52,100
Since we can't leave,

175
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:54,500
let's camp here tonight.

176
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,460
Why are you dressed so lightly?

177
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,060
Do you still have a cramp?

178
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,460
Yeah.

179
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:48,380
And you're out and about?

180
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
What are you thinking?

181
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:16,460
Do you want

182
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,780
to talk to me about it?

183
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,180
We can share the burden.

184
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,420
Scorpion Eye

185
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,500
recognized me as Miss Qingzhi

186
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,180
because of this.

187
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,900
They said their leader, Jiang Zhan,

188
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,660
has the same tattoo as me.

189
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:49,780
So if I'm really Miss Qingzhi,

190
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:51,020
that will make me and Jiang Zhan...

191
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:56,940
What about you and Jiang Zhan?

192
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,820
Is that such a big deal?

193
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:03,220
Is that not?

194
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:07,180
This tattoo

195
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:09,020
doesn't mean anything.

196
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:11,860
People from the same gang
or the same family

197
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,060
might get the same tattoo.

198
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,940
When it comes to this Miss Qingzhi,

199
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,300
you can interpret it this way.

200
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,060
The respectful treatment
you received from those men

201
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,340
could suggest that Miss Qingzhi

202
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,500
holds a significant status.

203
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:29,260
So if she were
to disappear or go missing,

204
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,700
it would be hard to keep it hidden.

205
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,580
Her subordinates
would be talking about it.

206
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,740
You've been away from the pass
for over a year and a half,

207
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:39,380
so you're not Qingzhi,

208
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,020
and your relationship with Jiang Zhan

209
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,700
isn't what you think either.

210
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,980
Chang Dong, are you unable

211
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,300
to accept that I have something
to do with another man?

212
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:55,180
What do you think?

213
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,340
It is still

214
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,180
a possibility, though.

215
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,860
If things take a turn for the worse,

216
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:06,460
will you promise me one thing?

217
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:11,020
What is it?

218
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,180
If that person really exists,

219
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,820
or if I really am Qingzhi,

220
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:16,380
can you please not leave

221
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:18,140
without saying a word?

222
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:21,380
Let's talk face to face

223
00:16:22,580 --> 00:16:24,780
and make decisions together,

224
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:25,940
so we have no regrets
whether we're together or apart.

225
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:26,580
Okay?

226
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:30,700
Okay?

227
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:32,820
I'll consider it.

228
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,860
Yeah?

229
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,820
Do you think

230
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:38,420
I'm the kind of man who easily lets go?

231
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,260
What do you think?

232
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:45,380
Liuxi.

233
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:49,340
When I told you
that I wanted to have you,

234
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,940
I wasn't just talking
about the physical aspect.

235
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,220
I also desire your heart.

236
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,500
This is not the clingiest part yet.

237
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:00,380
What is it?

238
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:01,940
From now on,
every minute and every second of yours

239
00:17:01,940 --> 00:17:03,100
belongs to me.

240
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,300
That's just how I am.

241
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,020
I'd rather not pursue you at all,

242
00:17:11,340 --> 00:17:12,900
but as long as I catch you,

243
00:17:13,460 --> 00:17:15,100
I won't let go.

244
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:19,140
Alright.

245
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,300
What's wrong?

246
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,180
Let's go.

247
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:50,100
Fatty Tang!

248
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,100
It's like it's chasing us.

249
00:18:00,020 --> 00:18:01,540
But we didn't eat any of its food.

250
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,300
Doesn't it look like a door to you?

251
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:08,340
Did it appear out of the lake?

252
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,780
It seems that this Welcome Gate

253
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,540
really does welcome guests on its own.

254
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,260
So, are we departing now?

255
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,780
Are we going to drive through it?

256
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,220
We might end up in the lake.

257
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:24,460
Or it might be like when we drove

258
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:26,540
into the yardang landform.

259
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:29,380
We would enter a new world.

260
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,000
(Please maintain order
in the Welcome Village.)

261
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,900
(Welcome Gate)

262
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:07,820
Let's go check it out.

263
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,580
(Welcome Village)

264
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,620
Welcome Village.

265
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:22,180
It says Welcome Gate there.

266
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:23,620
That's pretty obvious.

267
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,780
Why didn't we notice it before?

268
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,780
I've never seen such a beautiful car.

269
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,820
Are you guys going to Black Stone City?

270
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,420
Yes, we are.

271
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,900
Which number are you staying in?

272
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:34,980
What do you mean?

273
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:36,540
You see, there's Number One,

274
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:37,500
(No. 1)
You see, there's Number One,

275
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,820
Two, Three, and Four.

276
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,420
(No. 6)
There's even Five and Six behind.

277
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,980
Have you not gotten your tickets yet?

278
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:49,900
Mister.

279
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,620
What kind of tickets do you mean?

280
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:53,380
This is my first time traveling far.

281
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,620
May I see yours?

282
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:57,060
Sure.

283
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,300
Here you go.

284
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:00,180
(Travel Document)

285
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,020
It looks like this.

286
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,960
(Black Stone City Feather Guards)

287
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:03,980
You guys

288
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,780
came from Red Brick City, right?

289
00:20:06,220 --> 00:20:06,540
Yeah.

290
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:09,460
You can exchange the document
for a ticket.

291
00:20:09,460 --> 00:20:11,780
The ticket will
cover an overnight stay and meals.

292
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,140
Someone will be here
for security checks soon.

293
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:15,660
As long as you pass security,

294
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,900
early tomorrow morning,

295
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,660
you'll be able
to go through the Welcome Gate.

296
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,340
Look, someone's coming.

297
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,100
You all go ahead.

298
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,860
Customs clearance documents, please.

299
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,100
Where do we get our tickets?

300
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:42,700
A moment please.

301
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:59,420
Please get in the car and follow us.

302
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:01,820
Let's get in the car.

303
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,620
Look.

304
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,260
There's water.

305
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:47,660
(Interrogation room)

306
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,380
We're in the water.

307
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,220
I can swim,

308
00:22:06,460 --> 00:22:07,980
but I can't dive.

309
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,140
Please take a seat.

310
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:18,060
That rooster as well.

311
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,460
Sit here.

312
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,220
You may have heard that someone
from Scorpion Eye

313
00:22:51,220 --> 00:22:53,180
entered Black Stone City before.

314
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,980
The higher-ups
have requested a strict investigation.

315
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,380
We hope for your active cooperation.

316
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:00,300
There are two dead bodies.

317
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,740
Please don't worry.

318
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,340
Those were from Scorpion Eye.

319
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:12,580
They tried
to enter Black Stone City earlier

320
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,300
and killed people here.

321
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,580
That's why they were thrown
to feed the Water Tongue.

322
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,180
Please sit up straight

323
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,020
and remove your hats and masks.

324
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:27,900
We hope for your active cooperation.

325
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:30,380
After all, you wouldn't want
to be fed to the Water Tongue.

326
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:31,940
What tongue?

327
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,220
The one in the mouth?

328
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:37,420
It's her.

329
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,740
She's back.

330
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,660
Which market do you live in?

331
00:23:43,220 --> 00:23:45,140
Which market do you live in?

332
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,100
Red Brick City.

333
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:51,900
What's the name of the Commander
of Feather Guards in Red Brick City?

334
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:59,300
What's the name of the Commander
of Feather Guards in Red Brick City?

335
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,060
What's the name
of the Commander of Feather Guards?

336
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,180
Answer.

337
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,980
What's the name of the Commander
of Feather Guards in Red Brick City?

338
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,940
Answer now.

339
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,580
What's the name of the Commander
of Feather Guards in Red Brick City?

340
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:14,860
Answer!

341
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,700
Don't yell at us!

342
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:18,260
We don't know. We can't remember.

343
00:24:20,260 --> 00:24:22,020
Forgery of documents.

344
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:23,460
You're going to be fed
to the Water Tongue now.

345
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:24,300
What tongue?

346
00:24:45,260 --> 00:24:46,260
Watch out!

347
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,260
Fatty Tang!

348
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,940
Let them go now.

349
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,820
Alright, you may pass now.

350
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:46,300
You can go through the Welcome Gate

351
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:47,380
and enter Black Stone City.

352
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,100
What about my friend?

353
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,020
Over there.

354
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,620
Fatty Tang.

355
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,540
Fatty Tang.

356
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:00,580
Here you are.

357
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,460
Fatty Tang.

358
00:26:09,460 --> 00:26:10,660
You alright?

359
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:12,780
I almost died again.

360
00:26:14,060 --> 00:26:17,460
Why does it always happen to me?

361
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,180
Alright, get up.

362
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:22,060
Come on.

363
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,660
Let's go.

364
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,020
We have arranged your rooms already.

365
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,420
Please rest early.

366
00:26:26,820 --> 00:26:28,980
You may pass through the Gate
after sunrise.

367
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,220
Excuse me.

368
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:33,900
Is she okay?

369
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,220
She's okay.
It's just that her clothes got torn.

370
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,500
Why are you so delicate?

371
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,980
Alright, give him a break.

372
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,420
Please enjoy your meal.

373
00:27:03,420 --> 00:27:05,220
Your destination
is Black Stone City, right?

374
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,740
After finishing your meal,
and when it is time to leave,

375
00:27:06,740 --> 00:27:07,620
you may depart.

376
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,380
Why are you all not eating?

377
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,620
You're not like your usual self,

378
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:24,100
not afraid of those monsters anymore.

379
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
Why should I be afraid?

380
00:27:27,140 --> 00:27:29,100
The alive ones fear hunger and death.

381
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,300
I can't figure them out anyway.

382
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:33,700
Don't make fun of me.

383
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,900
I didn't explain it clearly just now.

384
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,980
What I wanted to say was

385
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,380
when that tongue

386
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,300
dragged me into the water,

387
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,620
it was like I was almost dead, right?

388
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,020
Since I'm alive now,

389
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,380
I'm not afraid of anything anymore.

390
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:44,020
If I can be alive,
why not be happy about it?

391
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,700
What is there to fear?

392
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,180
Look at this food here.

393
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:46,820
We haven't had a good meal in days.

394
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,460
Let's just eat. There's no poison.

395
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,460
Dong.

396
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,300
Are you incapable of lying?

397
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:54,660
When that woman pressured you to answer,

398
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,620
you replied like a naive child.

399
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:58,460
Since you're quick-witted,
why didn't you say something?

400
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,380
Although
I'm good at making up stuff on the spot,

401
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,460
I am prone to making mistakes.

402
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,220
You're more composed.

403
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,420
Liuxi is worse, though.

404
00:28:05,620 --> 00:28:07,580
She got angry
after just a couple of questions.

405
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,220
Don't yell at us.

406
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,820
We don't know. We can't remember.

407
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:14,420
Liuxi, you're protective of Dong,
aren't you?

408
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,980
You felt bad for him
when he was being yelled at.

409
00:28:24,260 --> 00:28:25,980
What do you guys think that woman is?

410
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,860
She's probably
related to the water in some way.

411
00:28:28,900 --> 00:28:30,900
Liuxi, have you noticed?

412
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,500
Whenever you got angry,

413
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:35,580
a lot of things
just worked themselves out.

414
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:37,460
After you got angry,

415
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
they let us pass.

416
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,820
After you got angry,

417
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,180
we got our customs clearance documents.

418
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:42,300
And after you got angry,

419
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,020
they decided to not kill me.

420
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:46,940
From now on, Liuxi,

421
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,900
you should get angry

422
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,860
and maintain it.

423
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:50,700
We'll have a smooth journey.

424
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,200
