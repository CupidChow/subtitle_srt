=Episode 23=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,480
What are you trying to do?

4
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,480
Who do you think caused this to us?

5
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,680
Scorpion Eye?

6
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,840
Aren't you good at fighting?

7
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,440
Do you see my emblem?

8
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,280
It's a dove.

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,880
It's for message delivery
and surveillance.

10
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,440
I'm not a Falcon Guard.

11
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,760
Besides, they came prepared.

12
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,760
I couldn't beat them.

13
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,120
Could you?

14
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,080
We should've brought Gao Shen with us.

15
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,640
Never mind.

16
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,000
He could have been kidnapped too.

17
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,480
This is kidnapping, isn't it?

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,360
Has this happened before?

19
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,840
Just recently,

20
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:38,240
several of our Night Patrol's
Feather Guards were killed.

21
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,920
Do you know Jiang Zhan's lover, Qingzhi?

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,200
She's formidable too.

23
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,560
When she came to our tower last time,

24
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,080
she injured four of our men heavily.

25
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:46,440
They either don't act at all,

26
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,320
or when they do,
there's sure to be bloodshed.

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
As a minor character,
I only get kidnapped

28
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,160
thanks to your influence!

29
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,690
Think about your group of people.

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:57,080
Who is most useful to them?

31
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,280
So, they're doing this because of Liuxi?

32
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,040
Listen.

33
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,760
Learn to be more flexible later.

34
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,120
Be nice when they ask you questions.

35
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,160
Don't confront them head-on.

36
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,160
Like I will!

37
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,840
Why should I be nice to them?

38
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,440
They don't deserve.

39
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,800
Do you know how to be flexible?

40
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,320
We are only two now and outnumbered.

41
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,800
Since we're captured now,

42
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:25,240
you have to learn to be submissive.

43
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,440
Try to appease them first.

44
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,960
When they relax their guard,

45
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,240
you attack them.

46
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
It's okay even if you kill them.

47
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,440
You're stubborn.

48
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,440
You have no backbone.

49
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,200
Open the door.

50
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,560
Are they Jiang Zhan and Qingzhi?

51
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,760
I don't know. I've never met them.

52
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,160
What has Ye Liuxi been up to

53
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,120
in this past year?

54
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,760
What is she plotting
with her sudden return?

55
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,160
Didn't you all

56
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,200
hang Liuxi?

57
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:24,400
It seemed like a woman
from the Long family rescued her.

58
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:26,400
Later, Liuxi lost her memory.

59
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Over a year ago,

60
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,800
Feather Guards set fire to Huyang City

61
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,720
and executed over 100 of our men.

62
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,360
We captured the spy
who infiltrated Scorpion Eye

63
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,840
and decided to hang her
to appease the dead.

64
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
But this spy

65
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,080
disappeared in a storm.

66
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,480
You guys are lying.

67
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,960
It was Scorpion Eye
who hanged Feather Guards.

68
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,760
Keep your voice down.

69
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,120
Did you see it with your own eyes?

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,600
I...

71
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:02,320
Or did Zhao Guanshou tell you?

72
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:04,440
Why keep him alive?

73
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:06,400
Chop his head off, and send it to Ye Liuxi.

74
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:06,880
No!

75
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,280
Don't chop off my head!

76
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,200
Why would you chop off my head?

77
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:10,920
Listen.

78
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,200
I might bring you something

79
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,920
even more valuable.

80
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,400
Wait.

81
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,400
Don't...

82
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,440
What did you do?

83
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,560
- What's your life worth?
- Let go of him!

84
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:31,520
Let go.

85
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:33,440
Let go.

86
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,560
Let go.

87
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:40,760
Sheep's Horn Cup.

88
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,040
Sheep's Horn Cup.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,200
Sheep's Horn Cup.

90
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,240
It's the Sheep's Horn Cup.

91
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:51,120
He said the Sheep's Horn Cup.

92
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,760
Is your life worth the Sheep's Horn Cup?

93
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,440
Liuxi will tell you

94
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,920
whether my life is worth it.

95
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:12,280
I know Liuxi too well.

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,240
If

97
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,120
Liuxi knows

98
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:17,680
that you treat me badly

99
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,280
or even hurt me,

100
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:21,480
you won't get

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:23,720
a complete Sheep's Horn Cup.

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,600
Instead,

103
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,400
you'll get one

104
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,280
with missing limbs.

105
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,040
Alright.

106
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,360
Lock the door.

107
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,320
Are you alright?

108
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:03,720
Yeah.

109
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:09,720
My luck has been good.

110
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
I won't die easily.

111
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,560
Is Liuxi really willing

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,880
to trade the Sheep's Horn Cup for you?

113
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,080
Do you think
I'm worth the Sheep's Horn Cup?

114
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,640
I mean,

115
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,160
nobody would even
trade one kilo of agate for me.

116
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,840
Why did you tell him that then?

117
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:32,880
What could I do?

118
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,680
I had to say it.

119
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,440
At least, I tried.

120
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,840
When they contact Liuxi,

121
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:41,760
Liuxi and Dong would know
that something happened to us, right?

122
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,560
And if Liuxi really

123
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:47,440
trades the Sheep's Horn Cup for me,

124
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,280
I'll repay her.

125
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:52,920
I'll do whatever she asks.

126
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,580
What are they doing here again?

127
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,040
Why are they back?

128
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:11,960
What's going on?

129
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,360
What do you want?

130
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:22,880
Is this

131
00:08:22,880 --> 00:08:23,920
Fatty Tang's?

132
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:29,120
It could also be He's.

133
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,920
The guards said

134
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,840
they saw He and Fatty Tang
go out together.

135
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
After that,

136
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,560
there was no news about the two of them.

137
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,620
It must be Scorpion Eye.

138
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,560
We inquired all the way
to the West Market

139
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
and found a porcelain shop,

140
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,320
but it was empty.

141
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:45,000
On the counter,

142
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,160
there was this box

143
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,560
and a few photos,

144
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,920
and there was a message saying
to give these to Ye Liuxi.

145
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:55,160
After that,
we couldn't find any more leads.

146
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:58,880
We know that Jiang Zhan
has always been in Black Stone City,

147
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,480
but we've never found him.

148
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
What should we do now?

149
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:04,240
Could they have already...

150
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:04,800
If Scorpion Eye

151
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:06,640
wants to intimidate me,

152
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,200
they could just
leave Fatty Tang's dead body at our door.

153
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,360
But they sent a tongue instead.

154
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:13,040
This is definitely a kidnapping.

155
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,320
Let's see what they do next.

156
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,360
Mr. Zhao.

157
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,840
I think there's a spy among you.

158
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,680
We were photographed

159
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:25,440
right when we went shopping
the day after our arrival.

160
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,680
Then, on the next day,
Fatty Tang and He were kidnapped.

161
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,760
Our incidents
are happening too often, right?

162
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,240
I've been suspecting two people.

163
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,440
The first one is He.

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,000
She knew your itinerary

165
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,560
and disappeared with Fatty Tang
at the same time.

166
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,120
The second one is...

167
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,160
Ouch!

168
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:46,680
It hurts!

169
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,040
What are you doing?

170
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,600
I'm a sorcerer!

171
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,480
Look. I have the badge.

172
00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,000
Right.

173
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,880
Gao Dong.

174
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:58,240
Can you help me?

175
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,200
What does this mean?

176
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:00,760
Why did they tie me up?

177
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,120
He's probably
not related to Scorpion Eye.

178
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,400
If you're not sure,

179
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:06,440
send guards to watch outside the yard.

180
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,400
Scorpion Eye?

181
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,200
I'm not one of them!

182
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,360
But Dong,

183
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,560
he was with us almost the whole way.

184
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:13,960
Yeah.

185
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,600
Hey.

186
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,720
We only met him by chance

187
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,400
on our first encounter

188
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,560
at the Red Flower Tree.

189
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,040
After that,
we were the ones waiting for him.

190
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,440
Mr. Zhao.

191
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,720
I can vouch for him.

192
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,480
Anyway, please rest well tonight.

193
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,160
Don't wander around anymore.

194
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,360
If there's anything,
we'll discuss it tomorrow.

195
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
Thank you, Gao Dong.

196
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,160
My name is Chang Dong.

197
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,160
And I'm Gao Shen.

198
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,800
Alright, let's go.

199
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,160
Stop!

200
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,400
The girl who brought us food
is really nice.

201
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:40,160
Now, she's done for.

202
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,560
Done for what?

203
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:45,720
Haven't you heard?

204
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,800
I feel like you all
aren't very informed.

205
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
Jiang Zhan

206
00:11:51,840 --> 00:11:53,680
hates Feather Guards the most.

207
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,440
If he catches one,

208
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,560
that person will
either die or be tortured.

209
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,440
Let me put it this way.

210
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,560
Under him,
regular folks and sorcerers can survive

211
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,300
but not Feather Guards.

212
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,240
If he catches one,

213
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,800
no one can leave in one piece.

214
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,300
Mr. Zhao.

215
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,280
He.

216
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,320
Are you okay?

217
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:16,200
Fatty Tang.

218
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:17,420
Where is Fatty Tang?

219
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,720
Fatty Tang is in prison.

220
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,080
He's in prison.

221
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,980
Did they slice off Fatty Tang's tongue?

222
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,140
Fatty Tang.

223
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:27,280
Sit down first.

224
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,080
Ye Liuxi is right here.

225
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:34,720
Tell her directly
if you have something to say.

226
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,420
Ye Liuxi, you had a pretty decent year.

227
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:57,600
What?

228
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:01,440
Jiang Zhan replaced her tongue
with his substitute tongue.

229
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,880
Substitute tongue and Water Eye
are alike.

230
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:06,200
Jiang Zhan can use her
to communicate with you.

231
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,960
I couldn't get any information

232
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,040
about Fatty Tang from her.

233
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,140
It was because Jiang Zhan clarified

234
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,940
that he only wanted to talk to you.

235
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,560
Where is Fatty Tang?

236
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:22,080
Is he alive or dead?

237
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,760
Is he whole or in pieces?

238
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:25,400
Don't worry. He's whole.

239
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,720
After all, I want to trade him.

240
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:30,680
But if you don't want to exchange,

241
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,950
then that's a different story.

242
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:36,160
It depends on what you want to exchange.

243
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,350
If you want to exchange
for Black Stone City right now,

244
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:40,080
I can't do that.

245
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,400
I will personally
attack Black Stone City

246
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:45,460
and chop off Zhao Guanshou's head.

247
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,860
You don't need
to do these two things for me.

248
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,200
I heard

249
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,560
you have the Sheep's Horn Cup, right?

250
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,340
You want to trade Fatty Tang
for the Sheep's Horn Cup.

251
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,400
Of course.

252
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,800
It's okay if you don't want
to exchange it.

253
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,040
After all, that thing is very precious.

254
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:06,440
Then you don't know me.

255
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,920
I've never cared much about that thing.

256
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,680
The Sheep's Horn Cup in your hands

257
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,080
shouldn't be fake, right?

258
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,020
Isn't that boring to say like that?

259
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
Did I ever
doubt the Fatty Tang you have was fake?

260
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,450
You're over-thinking

261
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,360
and tip-toeing around.

262
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,080
Clearly, you are not
cut out for big things.

263
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:22,840
What's the deal?

264
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:25,050
Shouldn't that be your arrangement

265
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,640
before notifying me?

266
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,200
But let me make it clear upfront.

267
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,000
Whole for whole, complete for complete.

268
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,080
Fatty Tang must be intact.

269
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,860
No missing limbs.

270
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,200
And definitely no hidden poisons.

271
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,580
Otherwise, I can't guarantee

272
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,560
that what you'll get
won't be all broken up.

273
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,460
Do you really not

274
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,960
care about this Sheep's Horn Cup?

275
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,340
You're the one who wants to trade with me.

276
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,940
That means it will be your item.

277
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,580
Why should I treasure it?

278
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:49,680
Alright.

279
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:52,760
I'll leave this woman with you for now.

280
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:55,090
Figure out how to make this happen.
And I'll notify you anytime.

281
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,680
Also,

282
00:14:57,880 --> 00:15:01,300
next time, I don't want an old dog

283
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:02,640
eavesdropping nearby.

284
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,720
Mr. Zhao.

285
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,320
I'll take He for now.

286
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:18,760
I'll go take a look too.

287
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:24,000
Miss Ye.

288
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:27,560
You know the origin
of the Sheep's Horn Cup.

289
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,680
This thing must never fall

290
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:30,920
into Jiang Zhan's hands.

291
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,840
But the Sheep's Horn Cup belongs to me.

292
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:35,140
Shouldn't I have a say

293
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:36,040
in how to use it?

294
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,440
Mr. Zhao.

295
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
You set up Liuxi's return,

296
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,440
had someone keep watch
in the deserted village,

297
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,180
and then you welcomed her
with great commotion.

298
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,800
After that, you brought Liuxi along
to ask Silver Snake for answers.

299
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,440
Let's be open and honest now.

300
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,400
What is

301
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,640
your goal?

302
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,400
Holding back anything at this point

303
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,480
seems pretty sketchy, don't you think?

304
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,560
Alright.

305
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:07,120
Nandou breaks Yumen.

306
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,840
You, Ye Liuxi,

307
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,980
are the true owner of the Sheep's Horn Cup.

308
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,240
But unfortunately, Jiang Zhan appeared.

309
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,440
And his influence had rapidly grown.

310
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,360
When two evils compete,
pick the lesser one.

311
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,600
Jiang Zhan and Feather Guards

312
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:22,080
are at each other's throats.

313
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:26,300
We hope you can take down Jiang Zhan
and take over Feather Guards.

314
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,300
That would be a win-win move.

315
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,840
Miss Ye.

316
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,440
What are your thoughts on this?

317
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,760
I don't know.

318
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,600
I don't remember the past anymore.

319
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,980
Plus, my perspective is narrow now.

320
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,760
I don't like violence and killing.

321
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:48,380
You should really think it over.

322
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,400
It's not that we want to force you
into this mess.

323
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,640
Furthermore,

324
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,540
the enemy's enemy is our friend.

325
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,550
Scorpion Eye wants to eliminate you,
but Feather Guards want to support you.

326
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:59,840
So, you and I are friends.

327
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,880
It's a mutually beneficial deal.

328
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,580
Why not give it a shot?

329
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,700
This thing,

330
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:05,160
it has a primary and substitute part.

331
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,440
The primary tongue can be used directly.

332
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:08,640
But

333
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,660
to use someone else's substitute tongue,

334
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,920
you must first cut off your own tongue.

335
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,640
And then, attach the substitute tongue
to your mouth.

336
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,840
Usually, it's used
to repeat what others say.

337
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:19,940
Right now,

338
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,480
you have to wait until Jiang Zhan
activates the primary tongue

339
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,700
and then you can talk to him.

340
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,280
Will this substitute tongue

341
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,720
stay in He's mouth forever?

342
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Does it need to be taken back?

343
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:31,280
Well, you see,
it has a primary and substitute part.

344
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,840
The primary tongue can
regenerate the substitute tongue.

345
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:35,680
so it doesn't matter if you lose it.

346
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:37,280
But there's one thing.

347
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,440
If you want to cut the substitute tongue

348
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,880
out of your mouth,

349
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:44,200
it will be quite a challenge.

350
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,600
It won't be easy

351
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:48,360
for you to cut it off.

352
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:49,880
You need some skills for that.

353
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,480
First, take a sip of strong liquor.

354
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:54,440
Wait until the substitute tongue
gets drunk and dizzy.

355
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:56,040
Then, seize the opportunity

356
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,160
to cut it off in one stroke.

357
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,320
He.

358
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:05,560
Is your tongue still hurting?

359
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,240
Don't be afraid.

360
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,720
He.

361
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,280
When you and Fatty Tang were outside,

362
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,440
what exactly happened?

363
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:19,880
Who did you two meet?

364
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,920
I...

365
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:26,080
I met Jiang Zhan.

366
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,680
Tell us honestly.

367
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,920
Was it Jiang Zhan who cut your tongue,

368
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,240
or was it Feather Guards?

369
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,120
I just noticed

370
00:19:42,560 --> 00:19:44,680
your shoulder emblem is a dove.

371
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,980
Doves represent message delivery.

372
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,640
When Zhao Guanshou arranged
for you to be in the deserted village,

373
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,680
how did you two communicate?

374
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:53,300
Yeah.

375
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,160
You two didn't have phones
or satellite phones.

376
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,300
So, how did you communicate?

377
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,440
It wasn't Jiang Zhan who cut it, was it?

378
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,080
But he replaced your substitute tongue.

379
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,240
Am I right?

380
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,960
I...

381
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,440
Feather Guards are appointed
from certain families

382
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,280
of certain last names.

383
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,320
Of course,

384
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,560
there are special positions too.

385
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,280
Ordinary people can be appointed too.

386
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,000
But the age requirement
for them is younger.

387
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,840
My parents gave my name
for the position.

388
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,600
I was appointed

389
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:41,920
after rounds and rounds of screenings.

390
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,960
They thought
that it was an honorable thing.

391
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,440
After that,

392
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,400
I was given a substitute tongue

393
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
to send messages

394
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,120
in secret.

395
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:06,920
Fine.

396
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,680
Let's not talk about this first.

397
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,040
We'll talk about you and Fatty Tang.

398
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:12,440
What happened back there?

399
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:24,160
What are you doing?

400
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,440
Why are they here again?

401
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,400
Stay away from me!

402
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:32,600
What are you doing?

403
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:34,800
My life is worthless.

404
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,320
Get up!

405
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:37,800
Come here.

406
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,080
What are you guys trying to do?

407
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,600
No!

408
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,720
Stay still.

409
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,920
Open your mouth.

410
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,240
Li Jin'ao.

411
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:37,840
Li Jin'ao.

412
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,360
Come out.

413
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,680
I need to ask you something.

414
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,640
Sit.

415
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,840
It's okay. I can sit here.

416
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,840
Say,

417
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:58,040
have you heard of my name before?

418
00:22:58,440 --> 00:22:59,320
No.

419
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,440
I only know you recently.

420
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:04,040
Have you heard of Jiang Zhan before?

421
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,880
I heard of that name long ago.

422
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,400
He's Scorpion Eye's leader.

423
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:09,360
Frankly speaking,

424
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:12,160
bandits should be wiped out.

425
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:15,040
However,

426
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,880
- I'm impressed by Jiang Zhan.
- Why?

427
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,880
He was born as a slave,
the lowest caste.

428
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
He was powerless,

429
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,200
but he managed to come this far.

430
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,760
He's not an ordinary person.

431
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:29,440
He was born as a slave?

432
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:33,480
I heard that he was sold

433
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,240
to Gold Mine Mountain
when he was little.

434
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,280
Anyways,

435
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,360
it's impossible to get out
once you enter there.

436
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,240
Many people started digging for gold
since they were five to six years old.

437
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:45,320
They did that until they passed away.

438
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,840
It's no different from being a slave.

439
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,760
I don't know what happened next,

440
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,680
but he managed to get out of there.

441
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,960
He has something up his sleeves.

442
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:56,400
He was a slave at Gold Mine Mountain?

443
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,360
Let's put others aside.

444
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:59,440
Once you're in there,

445
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:01,320
they will press a hot iron

446
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:02,960
onto your leg

447
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,200
to leave a scar.

448
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,320
(There's a branding scar
on her right ankle.)

449
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:11,680
(I wonder how deep is that grudge.)

450
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:13,480
(Why brand me with such an ugly scar?)

451
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,040
You're not asleep.

452
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,240
How can I fall asleep?

453
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I'm thinking.

454
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,440
What is it?

455
00:24:52,040 --> 00:24:52,760
You.

456
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:55,640
What about me?

457
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,280
Which part of me?

458
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:58,680
Every part of you.

459
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:03,320
What's wrong?

460
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,440
We came to Black Stone City
for a long time.

461
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,800
Many things had happened.

462
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:10,400
What do you think about it?

463
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,400
What kind of thoughts would I have?

464
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:17,360
Many things had happened.

465
00:25:18,280 --> 00:25:19,880
But have we straightened things out yet?

466
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,400
If you keep this lazy act up,

467
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:23,480
you might die before you know it.

468
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,160
I won't die.

469
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,280
I was born to be extraordinary.

470
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:32,840
Besides, I have you.

471
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,240
But I will die.

472
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,200
It's not only me.

473
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:41,120
Gao Shen and Liu

474
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,760
will die too.

475
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,880
Fatty Tang's incident

476
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:47,000
is a wake-up call for us.

477
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,200
Don't put it that way.

478
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,200
Many things had happened

479
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:13,200
since we came to Black Stone City.

480
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:17,080
It's as if everything
was well-planned beforehand.

481
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,680
Actually, I've been
suspecting Zhao Guanshou.

482
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,980
I suspect that he ordered Scorpion Eye
to kidnap Fatty Tang.

483
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,320
Li Jin'ao told me

484
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:31,640
that Jiang Zhan

485
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:34,160
was sold to Gold Mine Mountain
as a slave.

486
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:37,800
I have a scar on my leg.

487
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,120
He has one too.

488
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,200
Are you suspecting
that you and Jiang Zhan

489
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,200
were slaves at Gold Mine Mountain?

490
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:45,160
I don't know.

491
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:48,080
I'm not sure, but that's possible.

492
00:26:53,240 --> 00:26:54,040
I agree.

493
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,560
The pass

494
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:59,440
is reigned
by Commander of Feather Guards.

495
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,920
Jiang Zhan was an ordinary civilian

496
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,840
and was born as a slave.

497
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:07,480
How could he be
of the same level as those people?

498
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:10,120
How did he gain so much power?

499
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,440
What would he need to gain power?

500
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,160
Money.

501
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,400
Manpower.

502
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:18,920
There's a saying that goes by,

503
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,560
"Recruiting followers".

504
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,760
As long as you have money,

505
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,800
people will naturally
follow your orders.

506
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,640
But where did he get the money from?

507
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,200
From Gold Mine Mountain.

508
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,600
Yes.

509
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:34,160
He has the resource.

510
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,480
But,

511
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:42,450
the man of authority had
more money and manpower than him.

512
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:46,840
So, Jiang Zhan needed
an ace up his sleeves.

513
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,640
An ace up his sleeves?

514
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,040
Supplies.

515
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:55,920
Supplies inside the pass
are extremely scarce.

516
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,800
So, Jiang Zhan needed

517
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,640
to control the sources of supplies

518
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,480
like Li Wangdong

519
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,080
in order to be successful.

520
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:05,880
But here's another problem.

521
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,000
We know that in the past over 20 years,

522
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,920
the supplies inside the pass

523
00:28:10,920 --> 00:28:12,280
were related to you.

524
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,440
If

525
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:16,880
you were the Feather Guards' spy,

526
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,920
Jiang Zhan wouldn't have
been able to succeed.

527
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,720
Feather Guards wouldn't
let Jiang Zhan gain power.

528
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
So, Zhao Guanshou

529
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,760
at least lied about this.

530
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,000
Let's say you and Jiang Zhan

531
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,320
knew each other since young.

532
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,560
You were slaves at Gold Mine Mountain.

533
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:39,440
Then, you guys found a chance

534
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,640
to escape together.

535
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,840
You helped each other

536
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,040
and founded Scorpion Eye together.

537
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,800
When I listened to the conversation
this morning,

538
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,760
I noticed that you overpowered him.

539
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,120
Besides,

540
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,440
you can exit and enter the pass freely.

541
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:57,840
You're gifted.

542
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:02,720
Judging from this,

543
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:04,960
your status and position

544
00:29:05,240 --> 00:29:06,920
should be higher than Jiang Zhan.

545
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,600
As for the name "Scorpion Eye",

546
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,280
you named it that

547
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,390
because you loved drawing scorpions.

548
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:19,760
Do you still
remember the dream I told you?

549
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,960
(I saw a scorpion on a water tank.)

550
00:29:24,440 --> 00:29:26,880
(If we take your analysis
into consideration,)

551
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,480
(based on how I saw a scorpion)

552
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,560
(and how I like drawing a scorpion
around my eye,)

553
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:33,120
it's possible
that I founded Scorpion Eye.

554
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,320
But there's a problem.

555
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:40,240
Everyone inside the pass knows Jiang Zhan.

556
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,400
Why

557
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,680
do the members of Scorpion Eye

558
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:46,440
only know Jiang Zhan

559
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,120
but not me when I'm his companion?

560
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:50,560
Why do they have such a strong grudge
against me?

561
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:52,640
Get her!

562
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,080
Why is that?

563
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,320
Let's skip this question for now.

564
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,600
If you really are Jiang Zhan's comrade

565
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,680
you founded Scorpion Eye together,

566
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,480
Zhao Guanshou would definitely
want to get rid of both of you.

567
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,560
But he can't eliminate me.

568
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:17,240
Right.

569
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:19,960
So, he's trying to make me
deal with Jiang Zhan and Scorpion's Eye.

570
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,980
We've linked the hints.

571
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,320
It would be great if that was the case.

572
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,000
But it's just our speculation.
