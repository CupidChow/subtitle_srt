00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,500
=Episode 26=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,380
It's stinky.

4
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,140
Ye Liuxi.

5
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,780
You're so slow.

6
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,660
Golden Snake just let out a sigh,

7
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:41,140
and you all got scared.

8
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,620
It's Jiang Zhan.

9
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,060
You talk big.

10
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,260
Is Qingzhi there too?

11
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:48,900
Are you looking for me?

12
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:52,380
Nothing. Just curious.

13
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,900
On the way here,
some said you look like me.

14
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,580
Are you Miss Qingzhi?

15
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,180
I was looking forward to meeting you.

16
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,100
You mean you look like me.

17
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,460
But a fake is just a fake.

18
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:06,940
Stop thinking about replacing me.

19
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,980
Back then, you were copying me.

20
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,780
Not only did you
wear the same clothes as me,

21
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,660
but you also had the same tattoo.

22
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:16,820
I was hoping that after all these years,
you've changed a bit.

23
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:19,660
You have a harsh way of speaking.

24
00:03:19,660 --> 00:03:21,460
But I don't bite back
when a dog bites me,

25
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:24,420
so I don't end up with its hair
in my mouth and have to brush my teeth.

26
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:27,100
Let's keep going.

27
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,660
We're almost there.

28
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:34,220
Liuxi.

29
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:35,940
Hurry.

30
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:51,420
Mr. Zhao.

31
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,540
There's a question
that's been bothering me.

32
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
There is only one tunnel

33
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,940
into the Gold Mine Mountain.

34
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,660
How did Scorpion Eye enter the tunnel?

35
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:04,620
Over a decade ago,

36
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,660
a young man and a young woman

37
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,260
left the Gold Mine Mountain.

38
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:16,820
Don't move!

39
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,580
Are you referring to the two

40
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,140
who are said to have jumped
into the Golden Pool and died?

41
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,060
They did jump into the Golden Pool,

42
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,140
but they didn't die.

43
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,780
Watch out!

44
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:15,180
Liuxi!

45
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,340
Liuxi.

46
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:21,780
Are you okay?

47
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:22,980
Yeah.

48
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:56,260
Ye Liuxi.

49
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,620
What was that about?

50
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:07,740
Nothing.

51
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,260
Just felt like it for a moment.

52
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:11,220
It was not as if I shot you.

53
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:13,140
I bring the thing.

54
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,500
Where's Fatty Tang?

55
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,220
Liuxi!

56
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:22,700
Dong!

57
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,700
He!

58
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:27,580
I'm okay. I'm still alive.

59
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,540
How do we trade?

60
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:29,620
Let's inspect the goods first.

61
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,780
If your Sheep's Horn Cup

62
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
turns out to be fake,

63
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:33,540
your man will be a dead meat.

64
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,540
See this?

65
00:06:58,340 --> 00:06:59,500
Bring it over.

66
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,460
What if you have another sudden itch

67
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:02,860
and shoot arrows at me?

68
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,260
I don't want to be your target.

69
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,060
How about this?

70
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,740
You release Fatty Tang first.

71
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:08,620
I can't pull any tricks here

72
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,060
since this is your territory.

73
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,580
You're quite cautious, aren't you?

74
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:13,100
Alright then.

75
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,100
I'll bring your man over.

76
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,380
You bring the goods.

77
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,900
We'll meet at the center of the bridge.

78
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,340
He might try something on the bridge.

79
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,700
Try to delay him as much as possible,

80
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,060
while I see if I can rescue Fatty Tang.

81
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:33,860
Alright.

82
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,380
Be careful, Liuxi.

83
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:56,620
Dong.

84
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:58,220
Dong, save me!

85
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,780
Don't worry. I'll figure something out.

86
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,100
Dong, I'm counting on you.

87
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,980
Let's trade.

88
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:23,940
Captain.

89
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,260
The mountain gate opens.

90
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,380
A vehicle is coming in.

91
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,380
Who's coming?

92
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,540
What's going on? Who's coming?

93
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:34,460
It should be the Commander of Sorcerers.

94
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,180
He's with a group of Feather Guards.

95
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,140
Mr. Zhao.

96
00:08:55,340 --> 00:08:57,340
Why is the Commander of Sorcerers
bringing Feather Guards?

97
00:08:57,340 --> 00:08:57,940
Without your orders,

98
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,340
Feather Guards are not supposed
to leave the city.

99
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,100
When I saved you back then,

100
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,740
I didn't expect
it would lead to trouble.

101
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:32,260
You said you were sold into slavery
in this Gold Mine Mountain,

102
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:35,140
but it was a lie to gain my sympathy

103
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,940
and to infiltrate Scorpion Eye, right?

104
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,580
You saved me?

105
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,300
What's your name?

106
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,260
I'm Ye Liuxi.

107
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,180
Liuxi,

108
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:45,340
like water flowing west.

109
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,300
When Feather Guards
besieged Huyang City,

110
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
we were just three days
away from reinforcements arriving.

111
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:55,500
I trusted you so much,

112
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:58,380
but you betrayed us
and colluded with Feather Guards.

113
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,540
When my men told me

114
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,460
that the city had fallen,

115
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:04,420
I thought you were captured.

116
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,740
But when I arrived,

117
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,100
you were standing at the entrance,

118
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:13,420
smiling at me.

119
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,820
Kill them.

120
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,380
Then, Feather Guards

121
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,180
flooded in like a tide.

122
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,100
Charge!

123
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,660
Huyang City was under martial law.

124
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,580
It was besieged.

125
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,340
Many of my men,
who disguised as common people,

126
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,460
were brought
before you to be identified.

127
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,580
Ye Liuxi!

128
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:46,100
You're going to pay for this!

129
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,300
Ye Liuxi!

130
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,540
You'll die miserably!

131
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,260
Ye Liuxi.

132
00:10:49,860 --> 00:10:51,220
You didn't spare a single of my men.

133
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,980
112 men of Scorpion Eye,

134
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:54,580
including the nine elders
of Golden Scorpion,

135
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,020
were all hanged by you alive.

136
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:00,380
I couldn't save them.

137
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,320
but I remember how horrifying
their deaths were.

138
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:04,750
That way,

139
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,960
I won't forget my revenge.

140
00:11:16,510 --> 00:11:17,870
A lot of people curse you,

141
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,910
but with this iron ruler of yours,

142
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,750
you smashed their jawbones,

143
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,030
and with this rope,
you strangled them alive.

144
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,320
I told myself

145
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:30,270
I will never let someone else
do the dirty work.

146
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,870
I'll to take revenge into my own hands.

147
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,270
That's an entirely separate matter.

148
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,510
Everything has its order.

149
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:46,790
I came today to make an exchange.

150
00:11:46,790 --> 00:11:48,200
You want to settle old scores?

151
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:50,000
Don't you think you should wait?

152
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:52,030
Ye Liuxi.

153
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,870
The reason I haven't killed you
all these years

154
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,870
isn't for old time's sake.

155
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,030
It's because

156
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,960
I couldn't find you anywhere.

157
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,750
Your friend said

158
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,750
you were affected by the sandstorm
in Huyang City.

159
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:05,120
You can't remember anything.

160
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,510
It's alright.

161
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:09,240
I'll tell you little by little.

162
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:10,870
That way, when the time comes,

163
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,120
you won't die without knowing why.

164
00:12:12,550 --> 00:12:13,360
Ye Liuxi.

165
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,240
Today is the big day.

166
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:16,630
Today,

167
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,270
I will avenge Huyang City.

168
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:20,030
Today, I will also

169
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:22,080
carve out Black Stone City's heart.

170
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,360
Don't make me drop it.

171
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,030
Don't you want the Sheep's Horn?

172
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,870
That driver is Scorpion Eye!

173
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,720
Ah!

174
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,720
What is the meaning of this?

175
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:03,840
Qingzhi!

176
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,200
I don't want the Sheep's Horn.

177
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:30,120
I want you dead.

178
00:13:36,390 --> 00:13:39,440
Men, protect Mr. Zhao!

179
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,000
Be careful!

180
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,510
Liuxi!

181
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:16,390
Mr. Zhao.

182
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,000
Let's talk things over.

183
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,960
After all, you and I are old friends.

184
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,390
I am Long Zhi's father!

185
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,200
A Shape-Shift Fish?

186
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,240
Charge!

187
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:36,840
Long Shen, you old fox.

188
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,480
I didn't know you're capable of this.

189
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,750
Liuxi! Liuxi!

190
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:36,240
Pray be careful.

191
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,320
Come here.

192
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,550
Take this.

193
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,270
Get into the mine.

194
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,680
Let's go.

195
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,030
Liuxi!

196
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:05,160
You plotted behind the scenes.

197
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,160
I shot you from behind.

198
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,790
We're even now.

199
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,350
Dong.

200
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,400
Hold on to me.

201
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,310
Come up, Jiang Zhan.

202
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,880
He.

203
00:18:50,310 --> 00:18:52,200
Be careful, He!

204
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,440
Please be careful!

205
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,200
He!

206
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,310
Give me the knife.

207
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,240
Here.

208
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,510
Three, two, one.

209
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,680
Don't alarm the Golden Snake.

210
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,030
That's exactly what we have to do.

211
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,790
Ye Liuxi must die here today.

212
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:39,790
I'll go and take a look outside.

213
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:48,350
Mr. Zhao.

214
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,310
Scorpion Eye came prepared.

215
00:20:50,310 --> 00:20:52,440
These sorcerers in the mine might
fail to fight against these demons.

216
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:53,030
Could you please

217
00:20:53,030 --> 00:20:54,510
request sorcerers from Black Stone City
to come and help?

218
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,880
It's best if they're from
the Long family.

219
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,270
They are but a rabble.

220
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:58,510
Why the fuss?

221
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:00,700
Hurry.

222
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:12,140
Where are Liuxi and the rest?

223
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:31,020
Gao Shen.

224
00:21:32,540 --> 00:21:33,340
Hold on.

225
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,060
Liu.

226
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:40,660
Can I rest for a bit, please?

227
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,580
Liu.

228
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,020
Liu.

229
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:48,980
Liu.

230
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,020
Liu.

231
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,140
Don't pass out.

232
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,020
Liu.

233
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,220
Liu.

234
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,140
Don't worry.

235
00:22:06,500 --> 00:22:08,340
I'll let you meet her
in the other world soon.

236
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,100
I couldn't
kill the both of you last time.

237
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,540
So, I'll do it this time.

238
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,100
Miss Qingzhi.

239
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:31,780
Miss Qingzhi.

240
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,180
Everything outside is going smoothly.

241
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,860
These two have
had a bad history with me.

242
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:16,900
Don't forget our agreement.

243
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,700
How can I save her?

244
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,460
Kill someone for me.

245
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,460
Will it eat me?

246
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,140
Bah!

247
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,940
This snake usually
feeds on cows and sheep.

248
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,500
It doesn't eat humans.

249
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,420
Don't worry.

250
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,780
Okay.

251
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:31,860
Mr. Zhao.

252
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,700
What should we do?

253
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,540
Golden Snake came out
from Golden Snake's Face.

254
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,900
Why did such a thing happen?

255
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,300
There's no time to lose.

256
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,100
We need to hurry

257
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,340
to the gold mine room.

258
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,220
That's the safest place.
Retreat quickly!

259
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,220
-Protect him.
-Yes.

260
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:28,860
Stay alert.

261
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,940
Yes.

262
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:42,540
Captain.

263
00:25:42,980 --> 00:25:43,740
Speak.

264
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,460
The mine is full of
Scorpion Eye's members.

265
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:48,500
Mr. Zhao.

266
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,140
What should we do?

267
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:52,820
Continue to explore.

268
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,500
Yes.

269
00:26:10,900 --> 00:26:12,820
Let me show you the majesty

270
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,980
of the exotic beast of the Longs.

271
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:38,420
Dong.

272
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:41,460
Liuxi.

273
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,740
He.

274
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:50,940
Ocean Guardian.

275
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,860
Ocean Guardian.

276
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,900
Ocean.

277
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,300
I'm here.

278
00:28:03,940 --> 00:28:04,980
Don't move.

279
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,900
Avoid waking it up.

280
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:11,020
I haven't untied the rope yet.

281
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:17,380
Listen to me. Don't move.

282
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,940
I'm almost done untying it.

283
00:28:22,180 --> 00:28:23,100
Ocean Guardian.

284
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:53,860
Do you want to die?

285
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,700
Do you want to take me along

286
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:56,500
when you want to die?

287
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,260
Qingzhi.

288
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,300
Qingzhi.

289
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,340
Ocean Guardian.

290
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,220
Listen to me.

291
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:17,940
Don't move. Don't make a sound.

292
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:20,100
I'll help you climb over it.

293
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,820
Follow instructions
if you want to be alive.

294
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,540
Ye Liuxi.

295
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,900
Can you still fight

296
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:57,580
with a crippled leg?

297
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,140
Aren't you going to see

298
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,420
if your man is still alive or dead?

299
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,980
You talk too much nonsense.

300
00:31:27,020 --> 00:31:29,020
(Qingzhi, don't go.)

301
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,900
What's your name?

302
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,540
I'm Ye Liuxi.

303
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,380
Liuxi,

304
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:44,540
like water flowing west.

305
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:00,060
I told you.

306
00:32:00,620 --> 00:32:02,060
You'll know one day.

307
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,660
Between two Lingzhi mushrooms,

308
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:05,500
who's the weed,

309
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,860
who's the immortal.

310
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,500
Kill them.

311
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,980
(Go. Hurry.)

312
00:32:26,550 --> 00:32:30,120
