=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,500
=Episode 21=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,620
This is the city spirit of Yumen Pass.

4
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,460
Yumen Pass was cast from earth and stone.
It can't move.

5
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,620
But its city spirit
was formed from yellow sand,

6
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,940
so its spirit can move.

7
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,140
The Long family summoned a sandstorm

8
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:07,860
to forcibly
move Yumen Pass' city spirit entrance

9
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,380
to the outskirts of Huyang City.

10
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,100
Scorpion Eye couldn't kill you anyway.

11
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:16,580
So when the sandstorm raged,

12
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:18,220
the Longs used the moving spell

13
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:21,500
to push you and the tree out.

14
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,500
With your Bone of Liuxi,
[*Heading west]

15
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,660
you could naturally leave the pass.

16
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,740
Why did I lose my memory then?

17
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:40,420
Forcibly shifting the entrance
of Yumen Pass

18
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,780
harms both the sorcerer
and those affected by the spell.

19
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,740
Ever since performing the spell,

20
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,660
Miss Long has been afflicted
with illness.

21
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,620
To this day,

22
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,380
she's still plagued by it.

23
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,260
Since you didn't
leave the pass through the proper way,

24
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:55,220
you lost your memories of the pass.

25
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,140
In order to trigger some of your memories

26
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,700
and guide you back,

27
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,660
we sent spies

28
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,340
to steal your bag

29
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:05,140
and place the Sheep's Horn within it.

30
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:06,300
We then placed your bag

31
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,380
under the Huyang tree
where you were hanged by Jiang Zhan.

32
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:11,560
(Travel magazine)

33
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,300
Through sorcery,
the Qian family could know

34
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,540
whether the Sheep's Horn
is inside the pass.

35
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:27,380
So,

36
00:03:27,380 --> 00:03:28,340
once you return,

37
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,460
we'll be able to receive news

38
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,100
immediately.

39
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,940
(Seagull brand?)

40
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:39,900
Kong Yang's photo

41
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,980
was found on this.

42
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,740
There was a camera in that bag.

43
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,620
Whose was it?

44
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,300
Camera?

45
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,860
Ye Liuxi used to be a spy
in Scorpion Eye,

46
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,820
so the things in the bag

47
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,620
should all belong to Scorpion Eye.

48
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,620
Why didn't you all

49
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,300
just leave me a letter

50
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,820
to explain all this

51
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,060
and tell me the steps to enter the pass?

52
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,420
Wouldn't that have solved it?

53
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,980
It's not that simple.

54
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:25,900
Yumen Pass itself

55
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,180
is a screenable medium.

56
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,820
All the secrets inside the pass

57
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,460
would stay inside the pass.

58
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,140
Since you didn't exit
through the proper way,

59
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:36,300
you lost your memories.

60
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,620
Anything that was written on a paper
would turn into ashes,

61
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,860
and anything written on a stone
would turn into powder.

62
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:42,860
So we simply couldn't provide you

63
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,060
with specific instructions.

64
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,780
What about us,
who accidentally stumbled in?

65
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,900
Will we also bleed to death
if we try to leave here?

66
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,300
Don't worry.

67
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,700
You're different from us.

68
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,260
You came from outside the pass.

69
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,180
Once we find the entrance of Yumen Pass,

70
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:58,460
Ye Liuxi can escort you out.

71
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,740
Why did you have to bring Liuxi back

72
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,980
inside the pass?

73
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,180
Can't you leave her alone
outside the pass?

74
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
There are three reasons.

75
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,940
First, it's to save her
and bring her back.

76
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:11,460
Second, according to the prophecy,

77
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,460
leaving Yumen Pass

78
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:15,060
is a secret way to resolve the disaster.

79
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,860
Third, only after she returns here

80
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:19,780
can we restore the shadow puppets.

81
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:20,980
So what you mean is,

82
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:23,340
by leaving and returning here,

83
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,780
I can help you
eliminate the threat of Scorpion Eye?

84
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,100
In the Battle of Huyang City,

85
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:29,540
Scorpion Eye suffered a major defeat.

86
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,100
Its remnants now scatter everywhere.

87
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,140
Ye Liuxi.

88
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,500
Your return this time

89
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,780
gives us the perfect chance
to eliminate Scorpion Eye together.

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,060
This exhibition hall was built
based on the internal structure

91
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:53,860
of the Demon Museum.

92
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:56,300
(Golden Scorpion)
of the Demon Museum.

93
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,300
The exotic beasts stored here

94
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,860
are either harmless

95
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,380
or relatively non-aggressive.

96
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:04,420
(Spiritual Guardian)
or relatively non-aggressive.

97
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,820
There are descriptions next to them.

98
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,260
If you're interested,

99
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,980
(Parasitic Flower)
you can take a look for yourselves.

100
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:13,200
(Host dies upon blooming.
Attempts to remove it can be fatal.）

101
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,780
Don't get too close.

102
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,740
Bone Mender.

103
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:32,220
It can mend broken bones.

104
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,180
What?

105
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,300
You are still thinking
of chopping off my leg?

106
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,520
(Golden Snake. Head of the exotic beasts.)

107
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,800
(Its saliva can protect humans
from being corroded by the Golden Pool.)

108
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,400
(Excessive use
can transform humans into snakes.)

109
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,620
(Human Snake)

110
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:04,820
(Human Snake)
Guys. Take a look at this.

111
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,540
This is covered in gold.

112
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,700
Salt beast?

113
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,980
Is this the one Old Qian

114
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:13,860
from the deserted village told us about?

115
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,140
Is this it?

116
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,300
Yes.

117
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:29,140
(Dangerous. Resembles human.)

118
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,340
(Dangerous. Resembles human.)
It is.

119
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,260
Miss Ye.

120
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,940
You mentioned encountering a salt beast
in your childhood,

121
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,580
and you narrowly escaped

122
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:37,780
by hiding in a water barrel.

123
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,700
The last salt beast

124
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,620
became extinct two years ago.

125
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,260
Its habitat

126
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,580
was in Flowing Sand Yardang

127
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,060
and was surrounded by sand mounds.

128
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,420
The sand mounds became active

129
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,700
due to the presence of the salt beast

130
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,900
and could attract fallen golden ants

131
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,300
that parasitized on the dead.

132
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,340
The ants then
turned the dead into sand monsters.

133
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:59,460
After the last salt beast died,

134
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:01,900
sand monsters were
no longer seen inside the pass.

135
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,380
But we encountered sand monsters
right after entering the pass.

136
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,540
The lifespan of sand monsters

137
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:10,860
was quite long.

138
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:12,980
Even after the salt beast died,

139
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:15,260
sand monsters could still survive

140
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,740
for several more years.

141
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,780
I have another question.

142
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,300
It's related to that camera.

143
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,780
Two years ago, outside the pass,

144
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,540
my team and I encountered a sandstorm.

145
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,780
At that time,

146
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,420
all the team members,

147
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,780
including my...

148
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:31,300
Sorry.

149
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,420
I don't have much time
to answer your questions.

150
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,300
If he has a question,

151
00:08:38,260 --> 00:08:39,260
you are answering it.

152
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:45,260
Alright, please.

153
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,980
At that time,

154
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:48,940
all the team members,

155
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,820
including my fiancee, Kong Yang,

156
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,940
died.

157
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,220
Their bodies couldn't be found,

158
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,540
and the vehicles
were nowhere to be seen.

159
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,540
The entire camp disappeared.

160
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,260
Not long ago,

161
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,100
Liuxi found me through a photo

162
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,580
that was in the camera.

163
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,940
Kong Yang

164
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:08,180
was embedded in an earthen platform.

165
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,220
As soon as we entered the pass,

166
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,220
we encountered Kong Yang,
who had turned into a sand monster,

167
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:13,660
along with other team members.

168
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,860
Later, when we reached Yellow Soil City,

169
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,620
I saw someone

170
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,620
driving the exact same car
that my team used back then.

171
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:21,620
Could you tell me

172
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:24,100
who took that photo?

173
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,220
Also,

174
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,300
you mentioned earlier
that secrets can't leave Yumen Pass.

175
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,980
So,

176
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:31,500
how did that photo get preserved?

177
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:37,340
Alright.

178
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,300
I will now answer your questions.

179
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,820
Two years ago,

180
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,580
Scorpion Eye, in order to fight us,

181
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,780
went to Flowing Sand Yardang

182
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:45,100
and forcefully
activated the Demon Museum

183
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:47,180
to release exotic beasts
to attack Black Stone City.

184
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,300
Although they failed,

185
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:53,660
a small section
of the Demon Museum collapsed.

186
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:56,860
It triggered a massive sandstorm
inside and outside the pass.

187
00:09:57,220 --> 00:09:59,620
This caused the city spirit's shift.

188
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,420
So,

189
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,420
that sandstorm
wasn't a natural occurrence

190
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,140
but the result
of the Demon Museum's collapse?

191
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:16,780
After the collapse,

192
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,940
all the sorcerers were mobilized,

193
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:22,340
and it took us several hours
to put the city spirit back in place.

194
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,620
Fortunately,

195
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:26,340
the area affected
by the shift was uninhabited.

196
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,340
I guess

197
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:31,300
it was probably during that time

198
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,580
that Scorpion Eye
discovered you and your team members.

199
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,740
They fed your team members' bodies

200
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,860
to the sand mounds

201
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:41,300
and took your vehicles.

202
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,340
The photo

203
00:10:44,220 --> 00:10:45,420
in that camera

204
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,220
must be captured

205
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,900
when the city spirit was shifted.

206
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:49,940
So,

207
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,300
it was preserved.

208
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,820
Scorpion Eye?

209
00:11:00,140 --> 00:11:00,940
Never mind.

210
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:03,140
It was my bad luck.

211
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,420
Alright.

212
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
Everyone.

213
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,700
You had a long day.

214
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:20,620
Let's call it a day now.

215
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,660
Miss Ye.

216
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:23,940
Your friends from outside the pass

217
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,580
can stay here for a few more days,

218
00:11:26,580 --> 00:11:29,340
and then we will escort them out
of the pass.

219
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,460
We will figure out

220
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,940
how to help you recover your memories

221
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,380
and deal with Scorpion Eye

222
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,980
later.

223
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,300
My friend here is injured.

224
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,580
Could you send someone to examine her?

225
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,100
Don't worry. I will arrange for it.

226
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,860
Later, you can
follow the Flowing Lights out.

227
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
Your accommodation

228
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,540
has also been arranged.

229
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,900
Let's go.

230
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,660
Where is Li Jin'ao?

231
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:21,980
Mr. Zhao has arranged for you all

232
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,860
to stay at a mansion
near the Feather Guards' tower.

233
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,100
Your companion is resting there.

234
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,580
Please follow me.

235
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,780
She's He, isn't she?

236
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,300
Wait...

237
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,380
What?

238
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:36,060
I thought you were pitiful
back in the deserted village.

239
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,100
You tricked us!

240
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,900
A swindler.

241
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:52,540
She's a swindler!

242
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:54,300
She tricked us!

243
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:56,700
How despicable.

244
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:58,580
I've been feeling guilty all along

245
00:12:58,580 --> 00:13:00,100
for hitting her,

246
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,460
a woman.

247
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,620
I was very sorry, you know.

248
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,940
Gao, don't you agree
that she tricked us?

249
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,260
It's surprising, indeed.

250
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,260
But think about it,
Zhao Guanshou had already planned

251
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:13,260
for Liuxi to enter the pass
from Flowing Sand Yardang,

252
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,220
so it was reasonable
that he sent someone there

253
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,460
to watch over her.

254
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,460
Back in the village,
Liuxi assigned her to do heavy tasks.

255
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:21,220
Feeling sorry for her,
I took over her tasks.

256
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:23,420
When we left, I even left her some food.

257
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:24,420
Now that I think about it,

258
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,700
she might have taken a metallic van

259
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,980
back to Black Stone City

260
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:28,340
right after we had left.

261
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,220
It's...

262
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,580
It's infuriating!

263
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,660
Why are you laughing?

264
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:34,780
This is nothing.

265
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:36,500
She's just a spy.

266
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,580
But she tricked us.

267
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:38,620
She's bad.

268
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,740
She deceived us.

269
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,340
Quiet.

270
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,300
Someone's here.

271
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,700
Uncle Ao, you're not sleeping yet?

272
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:53,100
Actually,

273
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,580
I wanted to sleep.

274
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:55,940
But,

275
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,100
I'm so excited that I couldn't sleep.

276
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:00,620
I never dreamed that one day,

277
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:03,500
I would be able

278
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,780
to stay in Zhao Guanshou's mansion.

279
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:06,940
It's like a dream come true.

280
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,420
We didn't expect it either.

281
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,540
Who would have thought he's so wealthy?

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,980
He's the Commander of Feather Guards
after all.

283
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:14,380
Being rich is nothing.

284
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:16,060
He knows how to enjoy it too.

285
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,740
Listen.

286
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:20,220
I heard

287
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,220
that he even has

288
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,500
a golden toilet in his study.

289
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:26,100
That's one-of-a-kind in the pass.

290
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,740
And that toilet

291
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,380
can spray water out.

292
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,900
That's disgusting.

293
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,740
Disgusting?

294
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:37,780
Why?

295
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,900
You guys don't understand the situation.

296
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:42,060
You know,

297
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:43,380
that toilet

298
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,340
was transported
all the way from outside the pass.

299
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,300
Do you know what that means?

300
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,100
It means a lot of effort
was taken to transport it.

301
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,580
That toilet

302
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:55,780
isn't just a toilet.

303
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:57,580
It's a symbol of identity

304
00:14:57,820 --> 00:14:59,260
and status.

305
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:01,460
If I ever...

306
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,460
Never mind. I shouldn't daydream.

307
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,220
Liuxi.

308
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,300
Where's Chang Dong?

309
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,740
Dong was feeling a bit stifled
and went out for some fresh air.

310
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,820
Liuxi.

311
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:19,340
Fatty Tang just showed us
a video of Dong

312
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,140
getting beaten up
by the Camellia's family members.

313
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:22,940
Dong was beaten up so badly.

314
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,460
Do you really

315
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,860
have to tell the whole world

316
00:15:26,860 --> 00:15:27,740
about his past?

317
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,980
I was just telling them about it

318
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,260
and exaggerating it a bit,

319
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,540
so they can show him some sympathy.

320
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,380
This way, he will receive our affection.

321
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:35,100
I'll show you some affection too then.

322
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,460
Liuxi, please don't.

323
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,900
Don't listen to Liu's nonsense.

324
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,260
Liuxi.

325
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,220
Come with me.

326
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,580
Come on.

327
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,700
Liuxi, look.

328
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,300
Dong is there.

329
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,260
He's lonely and melancholic.

330
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,460
Like a lone wolf,

331
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,900
he quietly licks his own wounds.

332
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:05,740
Watching him makes you want to hug him

333
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:07,460
and comfort him in every way.

334
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,180
Say that again.

335
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,140
How dare you fantasize

336
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,460
about my man in front of me?

337
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,300
Do you think I won't get angry?

338
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:16,300
Did I fantasize about him?

339
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,180
No, I didn't.

340
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:18,780
It was my head that fantasized about him.

341
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,860
Here's my head.

342
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,540
Come and hit my head.

343
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,100
Liuxi, I said it for your own good.

344
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,300
Dong is feeling down now.

345
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,620
Go and comfort him.

346
00:16:29,620 --> 00:16:33,340
It's a great opportunity
to strengthen you two's relationship.

347
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,700
Maybe he just

348
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,460
wants some time alone now.

349
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:40,460
He suffered such a big blow
two years ago,

350
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,860
but he didn't commit suicide.

351
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,380
He got through it.

352
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:45,780
That means he's already
figured things out.

353
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,940
His mood swing in the deserted village
was understandable.

354
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,500
He discovered the truth today.

355
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,660
He already had the toughest time
before this.

356
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,140
Listen.

357
00:16:58,780 --> 00:17:00,460
If you don't go, I am.

358
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,700
Go back, you.

359
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,420
You're so watchful toward him.

360
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,780
Liuxi.

361
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:11,820
Dong is too old for me.

362
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:14,740
He's probably ten years older than me.

363
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,140
I don't fancy him anymore.

364
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:18,380
In the future,

365
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:21,740
I'll find a man
who can completely overshadow Dong.

366
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,060
What about Gao Shen?

367
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,660
Gao Shen?

368
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,420
He's not my boyfriend.

369
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,580
What does this have to do with him?

370
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:29,660
Can you please stop bringing him up?
My head.

371
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,180
I'm going in.

372
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:32,380
Take my knife in too.

373
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,420
Feeling down?

374
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,380
No.

375
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,220
It's just overwhelming

376
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,380
to hear so many stories all at once.

377
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,340
I need some time to process them.

378
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,940
What about you? Why did you come out?

379
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,180
Are you here to accompany me?

380
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:22,660
After hearing so many stories all at once,

381
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:25,540
I'm feeling down.

382
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,460
I need some fresh air.

383
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,140
Well, we're different then.

384
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,060
I'm just overwhelmed.

385
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:37,780
Feeling cold?

386
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,300
Chang Dong.

387
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,140
I've made up my mind.

388
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,340
For you,

389
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:58,700
I'll give up these vast mountains and rivers.

390
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,220
What are you laughing at?

391
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:06,460
Do you even own any land back home?

392
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,460
The extent of my dream
determines the extent of my land.

393
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,420
If it weren't for you
holding me back,

394
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,740
I'd have been conquering lands now.

395
00:19:13,740 --> 00:19:14,740
Forget about owning some land.

396
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:17,100
Conquering this vast world
is just a matter of time.

397
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,180
Understood.

398
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:24,060
I'm the one who holds you back

399
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,100
from conquering lands.

400
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,140
Although I feel that Zhao Guanshou

401
00:19:32,140 --> 00:19:33,660
doesn't have much hostility toward me,

402
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,860
we still can't fully trust his words.

403
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,540
Indeed.

404
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:42,060
Losing many memories,

405
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:44,420
you're like a blank canvas
for anyone to paint on.

406
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,300
We must stay vigilant.

407
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,940
Have you noticed something?

408
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,420
I was thinking

409
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,420
that after the Demon Museum's collapse,

410
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:58,620
Scorpion Eye encountered Camellia,

411
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,420
took away my team members,

412
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,900
and drove off.

413
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,380
But why would they leave me all alone?

414
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,300
Could it be that you're buried too deep?

415
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:09,300
The Scorpion Eye folks missed you out.

416
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,900
Probably not.

417
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:13,820
I remember it crystal clear.

418
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,180
Right before I passed out,

419
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,780
I gave it my all to grab Kong Yang.

420
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:21,820
Since they managed to find Kong Yang,

421
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,740
they wouldn't have missed me out.

422
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:25,100
Are you suggesting...

423
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,340
Someone might have intended
to split us up.

424
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,500
I'll look into it for you.

425
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,980
Thanks.

426
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,300
Why not repay
by offering yourself to me?

427
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:52,820
Okay.

428
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:54,180
So,

429
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:56,780
have you got the mountains and rivers
ready for me?

430
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:01,300
Wait a minute.

431
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,940
If Ye Liuxi is an undercover,

432
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,220
why would they hesitate?

433
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,580
Just go after Jiang Zhan and Qingzhi
for revenge.

434
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:11,820
Is there only one Lingzhi mushroom
in the pass?

435
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,260
If you lose your memory,

436
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:17,500
and one day, someone comes
and gives you a new identity,

437
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:20,300
saying you
used to be an undercover,

438
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,220
and you were wronged by your enemies,

439
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,460
would you believe it?

440
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,300
Plus,

441
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,580
is a memory always the real deal?

442
00:21:30,540 --> 00:21:31,540
After all, this is inside the pass.

443
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:34,100
It's a fantastical world,

444
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,860
beyond our current understanding

445
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,420
to comprehend it.

446
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:46,420
So, who exactly is Ye Liuxi?

447
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:48,900
Could she have been deceived?

448
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:53,100
And who's this Qingzhi anyway?

449
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:54,700
Don't worry.

450
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:56,300
That Qingzhi

451
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,660
isn't just an ordinary person.

452
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:03,460
In the duel of the twin Zhi,
Qing's spirit will soar like a dragon.

453
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,260
Ye Liuxi.

454
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:23,260
Ye Liuxi.

455
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,700
Ye Liuxi.

456
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:41,180
Have you heard the news

457
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,260
from the Flowing Sand Yardang?

458
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:44,900
Long Lin and Si Ma searched for days,

459
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,300
but there's no sign of the Nandou Stars.

460
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,580
The Qian family
has given us a wide scope.

461
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:51,980
After all these years,

462
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:52,940
we finally narrowed it down

463
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,060
to Flowing Sand Yardang.

464
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,260
But,

465
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,060
there are still many residents there.

466
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,540
Long Lin also mentioned

467
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,820
there were
signs of the salt beast awakening.

468
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,260
Trouble never comes alone.

469
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,300
I think

470
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:11,860
we need to send more people

471
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,100
to protect the villagers.

472
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:13,980
Dad.

473
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:16,580
I have a way to find that Bone of Liuxi.

474
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:18,340
You do?

475
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:21,860
If the person born on the day
of Nandou in the sky

476
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:24,100
is truly immortal, as the legends say,

477
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,380
when the salt beast wakes up,

478
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,860
just let it rampage through the village.

479
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:29,900
No chasing, blocking,

480
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,100
and no driving it away.

481
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,820
Anyone who survives
is the true Bone of Liuxi.

482
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
My child.

483
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,140
Just to find this Bone of Liuxi,

484
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,540
are we going
to sacrifice dozen villages

485
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,900
and even

486
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,860
a few hundred of lives?

487
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:53,740
Zhao Guanshou.

488
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,740
If we can't locate her anywhere,

489
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:00,060
and when she shows up
like Li Wangdong did,

490
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,380
stirring up trouble inside the pass,

491
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:04,220
how many more will die by then?

492
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:05,060
(Secret documents)
how many more will die by then?

493
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,140
(Secret documents)

494
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,300
Mr. Zhao.
(Secret documents)

495
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Mr. Zhao.

496
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,300
You look pale.

497
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:14,100
Do you still have

498
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,060
any more medicine
for your frozen blood syndrome?

499
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,300
Don't worry about it.

500
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,420
Rest up.

501
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,620
Don't overexert yourself.

502
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:23,660
Rest early.

503
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:52,420
Mom!

504
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,500
This village's

505
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,340
already done for.

506
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,620
There is still no signs of survivors.

507
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,220
It's the salt beast we're talking about.

508
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:56,220
This is the last stop

509
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,360
(Si Ma, Long Lin)
This is the last stop

510
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:58,820
before it hibernates in the sand mounds
at the Flowing Sand dunes.

511
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:22,780
Save me!

512
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,620
Save me!

513
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:25,700
Help!

514
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,380
Help!

515
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,740
Save me!

516
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,820
Si Ma, what are you up to?

517
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:59,100
Haven't you heard?

518
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:01,420
The Bone of Liuxi

519
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,540
has an immortal body.

520
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,540
Don't get it wrong.

521
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:50,660
We're letting you raid the village
to find the Bone of Liuxi,

522
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:52,500
not because we're scared of you.

523
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,100
Don't you love gold?

524
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,460
Keep searching.

525
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,860
Finding the bone of Liuxi
is our top priority.

526
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,700
Move.

527
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,750
(Warding against demons)

528
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,780
Mr. Qian.

529
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,540
The salt beast
has left Ye family's Village.

530
00:30:16,580 --> 00:30:18,140
It's heading toward

531
00:30:18,140 --> 00:30:19,300
the Flowing Sand Yardang's sand mounds.

532
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,980
No survivors in the village?

533
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,180
But the Nandou Stars
are still up in the sky.

534
00:30:25,820 --> 00:30:26,580
Yes.

535
00:30:27,100 --> 00:30:28,260
No survivors in the village.

536
00:30:28,260 --> 00:30:29,860
And no signs of any kid's body.

537
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:31,940
The salt beast is good
at tracking kids by scent,

538
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,980
so it won't spare anyone.

539
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,300
We'll keep searching the nearby areas.

540
00:30:36,620 --> 00:30:38,820
The Nandou Stars
are still up in the sky.

541
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:41,660
I know that.

542
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:43,900
Whoever child is alive,

543
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:45,380
she's the Bone of Liuxi for sure.

544
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:47,780
We'll definitely bring her back.

545
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,060
We won't let her escape out of the pass.

546
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:07,040
