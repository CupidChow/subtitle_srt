00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,220
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:43,720
=Episode 33=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:30,860
They were being all lovey-dovey earlier.

4
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,780
Why's she mad now?

5
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:35,540
Women are troublesome.

6
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:46,900
Li Jin'ao.

7
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:50,140
I can't look out for you anymore.

8
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,300
Prepare your rations

9
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:55,100
and find a chance to leave with He.

10
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:01,100
Thank you for everything all the way.

11
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:27,660
Thank you.

12
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:31,990
(When the time comes,
Fatty Tang will drive,)

13
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:33,380
continuously circling the yardang.

14
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:34,660
Remember.

15
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,060
Turn on all the lights.

16
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,700
It will make it easier
for Liuxi to find you.

17
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:48,780
I'll head to the highest point
and look for you.

18
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:51,260
Once you're in the car,

19
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:52,300
release the gnats at once.

20
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:53,900
(Follow the gnats.)

21
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,450
(You'll definitely find the entrance.)

22
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,460
What if Feather Guards send a car
to follow me?

23
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,140
Let them.

24
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:02,740
We have a great car.
They can't keep up with you.

25
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:04,020
(Either way,)

26
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,760
(only Liuxi can get in and out
of the pass.)

27
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,940
Hang in there.

28
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,660
Let's all do our best,

29
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:26,500
yeah?

30
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,180
I know.

31
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,380
I know you're all exhausted.

32
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:48,020
I'm exhausted too.

33
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,420
Come. Let's turn.

34
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:51,100
That's right. Turn.

35
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:52,740
Raise the hand.

36
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:53,860
Raise the hand.

37
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:54,820
Raise it up.

38
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,620
This is great.

39
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,420
Go on.

40
00:04:58,100 --> 00:04:59,020
This is so great.

41
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,460
Are you driving around blindly?

42
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,060
We've retraced our route many times now.

43
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,300
I have my reasons for driving like this.

44
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,380
Just follow me.

45
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:29,860
Keep it steady.

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:31,100
I'm going to check on Gao Shen.

47
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:00,940
Liu.

48
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,220
What are you doing, Liu?

49
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,660
Did Gao Shen wake up?

50
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,300
Liu!

51
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,060
What are you doing, Liu?

52
00:06:11,060 --> 00:06:11,860
Liu!

53
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:38,500
Who goes there?

54
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,820
Qingzhi.

55
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,460
No.

56
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,420
You're Long Zhi.

57
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,060
Geminus.

58
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,340
Why is it with you?

59
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:28,380
Chang Dong is smart,

60
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,540
but even the most elaborate plans fail

61
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,980
when there's a mole.

62
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:37,540
Are you referring to He

63
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,780
or Li Jin'ao?

64
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,700
See for yourself.

65
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,780
Gao Shen.

66
00:08:02,540 --> 00:08:03,300
Gao Shen.

67
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,300
That Gao Shen is a fake?

68
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:10,980
There's an exotic beast
called the Shape-Shift Fish.

69
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:13,900
(He can replicate a person's appearance)

70
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,300
(and plant it on someone else.)

71
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,660
(The person will look exactly the same.)

72
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:21,020
- (He just needs to lie there)
- Liu, wake up, look at me.

73
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,340
(with his eyes closed and his mouth shut.)

74
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:22,740
Liu.

75
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,980
(But, everything he hears is complete.)

76
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,820
I'm the real Gao Shen!

77
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,340
(Isn't this mole)

78
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,180
rather impressive?

79
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:30,500
Are you done smiling?

80
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,220
Have you finished speaking?

81
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:33,420
If you're done, I'm leaving.

82
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,380
Go ahead. Go anywhere you want.

83
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,540
Where's Gao Shen?

84
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,900
With me, of course.

85
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,260
Why don't you ask

86
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,820
if he's dead or alive?

87
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,580
I guess you won't kill him.

88
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:59,780
After all, if Chang Dong fails to kill me,

89
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,340
Gao Shen's worth grooming.

90
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,860
You're too naive, Ye Liuxi.

91
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:08,020
As for having Chang Dong kill you,

92
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,100
I never had high expectations,
to begin with.

93
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,380
Some people

94
00:09:11,380 --> 00:09:12,940
can't be tempted or coerced.

95
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:14,460
Why did you do all of these things then?

96
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,060
Why did you go through all that effort?

97
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:19,860
I want you to take your own life.

98
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,220
Take my own life?

99
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,740
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

100
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,860
I want to live for as long as possible.

101
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:29,480
Did you see me
just to say these things?

102
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,420
Next time,

103
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:31,900
please find a more interesting topic.

104
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:34,500
Chang Dong is about to die.

105
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:36,980
Do you know that?

106
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,540
He even prepared his will.

107
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:44,820
He did so much just for you.

108
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:47,980
What a pity.

109
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,820
Chang Dong's whole life

110
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:51,420
is ruined because of you.

111
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,900
He truly lost everyone,

112
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,300
but he doesn't hold it against you.

113
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,780
He has my respect.

114
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,100
(Liuxi.)

115
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:02,460
(Right now,)

116
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:05,820
(you've probably led Fatty Tang
and the others out of Yumen, right?)

117
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,940
(I hope you can be in the safest place)

118
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,160
(and understand everything.)

119
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,100
Chang Dong.

120
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:16,060
You're acting strange.

121
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,020
(So, you three should leave first.)

122
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,860
What about you?

123
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,380
Don't look at me like that.

124
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,420
I don't want him dead.

125
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:40,420
You killed him two years ago.

126
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,020
I'm his savior.

127
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,380
In my opinion,

128
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:47,100
why don't you two switch places?

129
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,740
Let him live.

130
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,420
You can die instead.

131
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,740
Why should I believe you?

132
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,220
No one has seen the Heartstring before.

133
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:00,140
No one saw Chang Dong's heart
getting infected either.

134
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:02,300
You can just say anything want.

135
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,540
Ye Liuxi.

136
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,940
You won't believe it
until it's right in front of your face.

137
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,140
Go back and meet Chang Dong
one last time.

138
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,220
(Duel of Twin Zhi)

139
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:37,620
Why did you come back?

140
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,140
Didn't I tell you to go?

141
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:43,740
Why did you come back?

142
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,860
Why did you come back?

143
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:47,660
I'm sorry.

144
00:12:50,660 --> 00:12:51,900
You shouldn't have come back.

145
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,340
I'm sorry.

146
00:12:53,340 --> 00:12:54,940
Liuxi, you shouldn't have come back.

147
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,580
Liuxi, you should not have come back.

148
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:29,620
Stop it!

149
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,660
Stop!

150
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,620
Chang Dong's life is in my hands.

151
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,780
His life and death

152
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,460
can only be decided by me.

153
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,700
Liuxi.

154
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,740
Don't listen to her.

155
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:46,340
Do not listen to her.

156
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,340
Stop it!

157
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:11,980
Chang Dong.

158
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,740
Chang Dong.

159
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,740
Chang Dong.

160
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,180
Chang Dong.

161
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:20,460
Chang Dong.

162
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:53,260
Feel free to leave

163
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:54,660
anytime you want.

164
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,140
I won't stop you.

165
00:14:57,380 --> 00:14:58,820
But, if you leave,

166
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,500
Chang Dong's going to die.

167
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,780
I forgot to tell you.

168
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:07,260
Jiang Zhan, your only friend
in this entire world,

169
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,420
is still alive.

170
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,460
He merely lost an arm.

171
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:13,220
He's crippled now.

172
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,180
Everyone who gets near you

173
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,860
will end up like this.

174
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,100
Chang Dong, Jiang Zhan,

175
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,740
and your parents.

176
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:30,300
It's time you understand the situation.

177
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,220
Black Stone City's mine now.

178
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,820
Feather Guards, the sorcerers,

179
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:38,540
and even Scorpion Eye

180
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,020
are all under my control.

181
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,700
As long as I give the order,

182
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:47,700
you'll be the outcast of the pass.

183
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,660
Save him.

184
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,220
Sure.

185
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,060
How's this?

186
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,340
I'll give you a car.

187
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,180
Take Chang Dong,

188
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:12,700
Fatty Tang,

189
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:13,700
and Ding Liu

190
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:15,260
away from here.

191
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,860
Then, come back alone.

192
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,940
Stand in front of me

193
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,820
and take your own life.

194
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,740
That's all?

195
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:28,860
That's right.

196
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,860
That's all.

197
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,980
Once you're dead,

198
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,100
I'll help Chang Dong stay alive.

199
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:40,460
I'll also let Jiang Zhan

200
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:42,260
live a comfortable life.

201
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,180
As for Gao Shen,

202
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:46,340
I won't make things difficult for him.

203
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:50,360
Suitable arrangements
will be made for everyone.

204
00:16:51,340 --> 00:16:52,780
You won't have to worry about them.

205
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,900
How do I know you'll keep your word?

206
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,020
Do you

207
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:01,020
have a choice right now?

208
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:04,860
Fine.

209
00:17:22,580 --> 00:17:23,300
As soon as we left,

210
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,860
they caught us and brought us back.

211
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,660
Right now, Dong's unconscious.

212
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,860
They have Gao Shen.

213
00:17:32,860 --> 00:17:34,100
We don't know what happened

214
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:35,540
to He and Li Jin'ao.

215
00:18:06,060 --> 00:18:07,260
What's the matter, Liuxi?

216
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,740
I'm just laughing at myself
for having come to a dead end.

217
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:22,900
What should we do now?

218
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:34,300
Get ready to leave the pass.

219
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,220
Go straight.

220
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,900
The Sheep's Horn Cup from back then

221
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,620
fell inside the Demon Museum.

222
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,060
Bring it back.

223
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,020
I'll be here waiting for you.

224
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,660
Come back within one hour,

225
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,900
or else, you'll be burying Chang Dong's body.

226
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,860
You've never left the pass.

227
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,340
It takes more than an hour
to pass the Demon Museum.

228
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,180
Three hours should be enough, right?

229
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,580
Ye Liuxi.

230
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:20,180
I advise you not to use Chang Dong's life

231
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:22,340
to test my ability to show compassion.

232
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,140
Got it.

233
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:39,820
Mr. Zhao.

234
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:42,580
Why the long face?

235
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,740
Long Zhi.

236
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,900
Backing her into a corner like this,

237
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,020
is it appropriate?

238
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,780
Mr. Zhao.

239
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:52,900
You're getting old.

240
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,100
Have you grown soft too?

241
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:57,500
You and I can probably still remember

242
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,460
what Ye Liuxi was like back then.

243
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:02,780
But, when she returned this time,
her personality has softened a lot.

244
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:05,420
If we use her wisely,

245
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,660
we may not stir up any trouble.

246
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,990
The overall situation is settled.

247
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,620
There's no need to be overly cautious.

248
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:12,900
You're still too young.

249
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:14,380
Doing things too ruthlessly

250
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,260
often backfires.

251
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:17,980
You must remember,

252
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:19,780
Ye Liuxi has never been someone

253
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,380
who just waits for things to happen.

254
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:22,980
So what?

255
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,740
She has nothing now.

256
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,940
Feather Guards, Scorpion Eye,
and the sorcerers

257
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:29,500
are under my control.

258
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,060
From start to finish,

259
00:20:31,060 --> 00:20:32,540
there hasn't been a single mistake.

260
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:36,140
If she can turn things around
at this point,

261
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,300
the heavens must be wishing
for my downfall.

262
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:41,080
I'll accept it.

263
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:25,640
(Demon Museum)

264
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:35,930
Liuxi, what are you doing?

265
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,060
Zhao Guanshou said the other Beast Head
is in the Demon Museum.

266
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,940
I'll go and look for it.

267
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:40,620
I'll go with you.

268
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,500
No. I'm the only one
the exotic beasts won't harm.

269
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:43,660
Take care of him for me.

270

271
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,100
Let's carry him to Gao Shen's car first.

272
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:40,220
Liu, call Liu Qi.

273
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,260
Please prepare

274
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,380
what I asked you earlier.

275
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:48,220
I want to talk to him alone for a bit.
