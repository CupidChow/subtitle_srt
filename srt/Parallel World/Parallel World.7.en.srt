(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,420
=Episode 7=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,760
Have they all left?

4
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:53,790
Few people were digging,
slowing down the progress.

5
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,630
So they came back
and brought more people along.

6
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:57,430
However, some remained inside the tent.

7
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,760
I took the chance to sneak away.

8
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,430
Well, I'm heading out now, Dong.

9
00:02:04,310 --> 00:02:05,480
Stay safe tonight.

10
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,760
This place isn't peaceful.

11
00:02:08,190 --> 00:02:09,000
Alright.

12
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,560
Let's go check it out.

13
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,590
Why not?

14
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,630
We're just killing time anyway.

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:27,590
How's your foot?

16
00:02:27,590 --> 00:02:28,360
It's better now.

17
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,800
It still hurts.

18
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:36,230
Can you carry me on your back?

19
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,590
We're tracking them

20
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,560
and you asked me to carry you?

21
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:42,000
If you don't want to go, forget it.

22
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,560
Let's go.

23
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,400
Wait for me!

24
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,240
The footprints are pretty faint.

25
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,000
Hui Ba's crew left a while ago.

26
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:14,960
Wait up for a moment.

27
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,590
Chang Dong!

28
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:56,430
Come on!

29
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,160
Let's go.

30
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,560
Where is it?

31
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,510
Just up ahead.

32
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,720
- Let's go.
- Hurry up!

33
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,390
Have you tried extreme sports before?

34
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,160
I just saw you moved up so effortlessly.

35
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,870
You're quite agile.

36
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,800
I've done some parkour for a while,

37
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,120
but when it comes to fighting skills,

38
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:09,830
I'm at best second-rate.

39
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:12,680
I can't beat the three-time
national martial arts champion.

40
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:15,070
Three-time national martial arts champion?

41
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:15,870
Who's that?

42
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:17,950
Isn't it you?

43
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,870
When you make up
believable stories next time,

44
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:26,870
please

45
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,070
remember the nonsense you said before.

46
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,560
So you don't get caught.

47
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,070
It's right up ahead, Ba.

48
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,600
It's right there, Ba.

49
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
Leave a mark here.

50
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,270
Let me tell you a horror story.

51
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,160
One night,

52
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:04,240
a man and a woman

53
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
were tracking a bunch of folks.

54
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,510
The man was fast

55
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:08,360
while the woman was slow behind.

56
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:09,040
Then,

57
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:16,750
out of the blue,

58
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,190
she was yanked away.

59
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:21,800
The man was clueless,

60
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:23,720
and he kept moving.

61
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,240
Pretty spooky, right?

62
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,310
The story's getting even scarier.

63
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:39,240
Behind the man,

64
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,310
there was another person.

65
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:45,040
He thought it was still her,

66
00:06:45,310 --> 00:06:46,600
but it was not.

67
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:50,070
Your hand.

68
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,160
Give me your hand.

69
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,510
With all the weird stuff happening here,

70
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,510
if you suddenly get pulled away,

71
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,160
I won't have time.

72
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,000
Let's go.

73
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,510
Talking about 'hand', you reminded me.

74
00:07:06,830 --> 00:07:08,720
They held hands until the end.

75
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,160
Actually, let me tell you...

76
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,720
Dig harder! Why are you so weak?

77
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,630
Be careful and watch out.

78
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:42,160
One, two, three,
four, five, six, seven...

79
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,430
There are eight of them.

80
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,040
Stop!

81
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,000
Get up.

82
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,270
There is a painting.

83
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
If so, it's art,

84
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,630
and it worths money.

85
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:10,390
We are getting rich!

86
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:11,630
Dig fast!

87
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:12,560
Use your hands.

88
00:08:19,390 --> 00:08:20,830
This isn't a coffin, right?

89
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,190
According to local customs,

90
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:25,310
coffins go underground,

91
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:27,800
isn't this above ground?

92
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,160
Yes.

93
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,070
It's about half person's height
above the ground.

94
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,000
It isn't a hanging coffin too.

95
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,510
You go nail that side!

96
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,200
Nail it tight!

97
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:44,910
Hurry up!

98
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:45,840
Faster.

99
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,550
Pull harder!

100
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:51,060
One, two, pull!

101
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:56,140
One, two, pull!

102
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,540
One, two, pull!

103
00:09:00,550 --> 00:09:02,540
One, two, pull!

104
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:03,030
One.

105
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:06,080
Hold on, stop!

106
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:27,320
What's happening, Ba?

107
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:35,320
Whatever, just pull!

108
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:40,270
One, two, pull!

109
00:09:50,030 --> 00:09:50,510
San!

110
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:51,270
Ma Feng!

111
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,000
Ma Feng!

112
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,390
San!

113
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,750
Ba, these two guys are dead.

114
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:01,120
They are dead.

115
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,480
Ma Feng!

116
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,320
Let's move them aside for now.

117
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,080
Alright.

118
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:10,320
Hurry up!

119
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,000
Move them aside.

120
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,790
This doesn't look good.

121
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:13,630
Hurry up!

122
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:14,960
They haven't opened the coffin yet.

123
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,030
I'm the type of person

124
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,550
who values loyalty.

125
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:38,720
Chen San and Ma Feng
cleared the way for us.

126
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,360
They will have half of what's in the coffin.

127
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:42,390
Ba.

128
00:10:43,510 --> 00:10:45,270
That sounds unfair, don't you think?

129
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:46,960
If you suggest giving them a bit more,

130
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,390
I don't really mind.

131
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,270
But we split half with them?

132
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:51,870
What about our men on the ground?

133
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,910
That's right, Ba.

134
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:53,960
They're not in any condition

135
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,720
to enjoy the riches now.

136
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,870
This only benefits their wives,

137
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:58,120
and won't it also benefit other men?

138
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:58,910
Exactly.

139
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,720
We'll figure it later.

140
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,670
Open the coffin first.

141
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:02,750
Let's go!

142
00:11:02,750 --> 00:11:03,910
Come on.

143
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:08,270
Even when people are dead,
they still want to open the coffin.

144
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,840
Hurry up, open the coffin quickly.

145
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,750
Why are you so slow?

146
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,600
Faster!

147
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,120
Come on.

148
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:17,270
One, two!

149
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,600
One, two!

150
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,130
♪The gate of hell♪

00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
♪The shadow puppet broke♪

It looks like

160
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,480
this has something to do with me.

161
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,150
Ba.

162
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,120
Liuxi.

163
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,360
Singing at a time like this

164
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,750
would terrify people to death.

165
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,240
Singing? Me?

166
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:22,030
Are you sure you heard correctly?

167
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:28,140
♪Where now lies the soul of the East
and the bones of the West...♪

168
00:12:28,390 --> 00:12:29,360
What do you mean?

169
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:32,120
What's going on?
Quit playing spooky tricks.

170
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,700
Liuxi.

171
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:48,060
I've let you have everything
on our way here.

172
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,180
I'm not afraid of you, you know.

173
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:51,940
Let's be clear about this.

174
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:54,380
First come, first served applies
to everything.

175
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:56,580
If you want me to let you have this,

176
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,740
I'll not happy be about it.

177
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,540
You're overthinking it.

178
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
We're just here
to watch the excitement, right?

179
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:04,620
Yes.

180
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,140
That's good, then.

181
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,420
I'm not a bad person anyway.

182
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,020
After we open this box,

183
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:15,980
if it's all good stuff,

184
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,300
I'll share it with everyone present.

185
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,540
You can pick a few things.

186
00:13:20,140 --> 00:13:21,100
Alright.

187
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,020
Come on, let's continue.

188
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,580
One, two.

189
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,580
One, two.

190
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:32,580
Who's there?

191
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,620
I dare you to show yourself.

192
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:36,860
Show yourself.

193
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,260
Ba.

194
00:13:43,340 --> 00:13:44,740
Ba, what's wrong?

195
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:45,860
Ba.

196
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:48,300
Don't scare me, Ba.

197
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:51,300
What's wrong, Ba?

198
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,660
Ba.

199
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,220
Ba.

200
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,740
What's wrong?

201
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,620
This is too scary.

202
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,820
We can't stay in this place.

203
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,940
It just flew over

204
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,700
from a few meters away
and slashed his throat.

205
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:13,220
This is too bizarre.

206
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,220
You.

207
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,020
And you.

208
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,420
Come over and take him away.

214
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:53,380
Why do you know this song?

215
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:57,780
I just do.

216
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,700
Do you believe I can open this?

217
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:09,900
Don't worry.

218
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:11,820
Even when I was tied in a noose,
I didn't die.

219
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:12,700
If I ever die,

220
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:14,020
I'll definitely die in a special way.

221
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:16,940
Getting my throat cut with a shovel?

222
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:18,620
I can't accept that.

223
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,700
Take a guess.

224
00:15:24,020 --> 00:15:26,740
Do you think
this is filled with treasure

225
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:28,540
or a corpse?

226
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,300
Open it.

227
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,700
Shadow puppets?

228
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:01,220
There are a total of nine, all male.

229
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:05,100
These shadow puppets
are about the same height as humans.

230
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,820
There are joints with knots.

231
00:16:09,340 --> 00:16:10,860
But there are no rods for manipulation.

232
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,700
What does that mean?

233
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,820
Is this a clothing grave?

234
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:15,140
Doesn't seem like it.

235
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:18,260
I've never heard of a clothing grave
that contains shadow puppets.

236
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:20,500
And there are nine of them in here.

237
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,540
Do you remember

238
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,820
the shadow puppets we saw
in Hui Ba's tent?

239
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,620
Could they be related to this somehow?

240
00:16:30,460 --> 00:16:31,540
It's possible.

241
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,380
Wait a minute.

242
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,700
Are you going to ignore the bodies?

243
00:17:04,580 --> 00:17:06,540
Three people have already died.

244
00:17:07,820 --> 00:17:09,500
We're short on manpower here.

245
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,460
I'll go back and get some more people

246
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,620
to take them back.

247
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:13,940
That's right.

248
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,420
This place is too eerie.
Let's hurry and leave.

249
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:18,820
I hope you'll follow through
with your words.

250
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:22,300
Is there a need for you to be so kind?

251
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,500
You care when someone dies

252
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,980
and when someone escapes.

253
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:26,140
They're brothers,

254
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,580
but they're not as kind-hearted as you.

255
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,980
Speaking doesn't tire me out anyway.

256
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,820
Regardless,
even if we can't retrieve the bodies,

257
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,660
at least

258
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,220
let's leave them with some dignity.

259
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,540
Dong.

260
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,580
Did something happen?

261
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,540
When Huo Ya and the others returned,

262
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,740
their faces were pale.

263
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,740
And a few young ones were terrified.

264
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:30,620
Three dead.

265
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,540
One ran away.

266
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,220
Hui Ba is dead.

267
00:18:33,540 --> 00:18:34,740
Hui Ba is dead?

268
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:42,620
Fatty Tang.

269
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,660
Has anyone tampered with our car?

270
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:47,940
No, they were all in the tents.

271
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,680
Then where did this sand come from?

272
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:56,180
Did the sand open the door by itself?

273
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,860
Liuxi.

274
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:03,220
The one who dragged me that day
seemed to be sand, too.

275
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,460
(One, two.)

276
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:33,460
♪The gate of hell♪

277
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:37,980
♪One step out of the pass,

278
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:07,860
This should be
a brick painting of Han Dynasty.

279
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,020
These kinds of paintings

280
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,300
usually appear in tomb chambers

281
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:14,380
and have a strong connection to rituals.

282
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,580
But I don't think this clothing

283
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:19,780
looks like from the Han Dynasty.

284
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,220
You're right.

285
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,500
It's from the Tang Dynasty.

286
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:29,660
Wait a moment.

287
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:32,140
Let me get this straight.

288
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:34,420
Are you suggesting

289
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,820
that we found a Han Dynasty coffin

290
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,220
in the modern-day,

291
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,420
desolate Yardang,

292
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:42,100
and the shadow puppets inside
are dressed in Tang Dynasty clothes?

293
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,980
That's right. Absolutely right.

294
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,500
Take a look at this.

295
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,300
He wore the clothing
with a turned collar.

296
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:50,340
People in the Tang Dynasty
were fashionable, all dressed like this.

297
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:51,740
(They wore animal pelt hats)

298
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,060
(and wrapped headscarves.)

299
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:57,820
I thought the song
was about the Han Dynasty.

300
00:20:57,820 --> 00:20:59,740
But it's actually
about the Tang Dynasty.

301
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,180
What song?

302
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,500
The song that came out of nowhere

303
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
before we opened the coffin.

304
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,500
(It sounded like)

305
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:08,820
Yumen Pass.

306
00:21:09,940 --> 00:21:10,620
The gate of hell.

307
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,500
What's going on?

308
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,820
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

309
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:19,780
In chambers gilded,
you revel in joyful embrace.

310
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:25,500
Unmindful as I step into the gate,
tears trace down my face.

311
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,540
This song is a bit strange.

312
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,140
What's strange about it?

313
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,980
In ancient times,
outside Yumen Pass was a desert,

314
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,380
specifically for exiling criminals,

315
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,940
making them endure suffering,

316
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,860
and only recalling them
when it was necessary.

317
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,740
I can understand the first line.

318
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:44,690
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

319
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:46,540
Outside the pass is a dangerous place.

320
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:47,860
Going out there means certain death.

321
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,500
But then you say,

322
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,420
"Unmindful as I step into the gate,
tears trace down my face".

323
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:55,660
It means he neither wants
to step out of the pass nor into it.

324
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,700
Does that mean
after these exiled criminals

325
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,660
died outside the pass,

326
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:02,360
they turned into vengeful spirits
and ghosts?

327
00:22:03,260 --> 00:22:05,100
Could they be singing this song?

328
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,300
Is the sand in our car,

329
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,500
including the one who dragged me,

330
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,620
all their doing?

331
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,460
That's enough. Now lives have been lost.

332
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,380
We need to calm ourselves first.

333
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,900
Don't let them influence us.

334
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,660
It's getting late, let's rest.

335
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,460
Then I'll go back first.

336
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:23,900
Why are you going back?

337
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:26,580
Dong.

338
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,540
I'll go back and keep an eye on them.

339
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:30,540
If they have any other ideas,

340
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,260
I'll report back to you two.

341
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,780
I'll go now.

342
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:43,460
Fatty Tang has been acting strange
these days.

343
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:46,620
What's so strange?

344
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,500
Aren't you strange too?

345
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,340
But you don't allow others?

346
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:09,220
I'm going to say something
for your reference.

347
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,500
I feel like you're not someone

348
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:14,180
who grew up
in a normal social environment.

349
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:18,260
You see, in this world, most people,

350
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:22,620
regardless of whether
they are bad-tempered or fierce...

351
00:23:22,620 --> 00:23:24,300
Who are you indicating is bad-tempered

352
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,900
and fierce?

353
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:27,900
People in this world.

354
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,260
Most of them.

355
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,740
Why are you angry?

356
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,620
Go on.

357
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:39,220
Whether they are bad-tempered, fierce,

358
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:42,260
quiet, or calm,

359
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,740
when they do something,

360
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,100
they always stay within a framework.

361
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,060
They don't cross the line.

362
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,860
Let's take the incident
in Qingrang Town as an example.

363
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,740
To punish the john
who spiked your drink,

364
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,900
yes,

365
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,820
you can hit or scold him.

366
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:57,860
It's all allowed.

367
00:23:57,860 --> 00:23:58,740
But nobody

368
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,940
would leave the window wide open
and walk away.

369
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,660
(With such a low temperature,)

370
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:04,660
(he could have frozen to death
that night.)

371
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,860
Legal awareness is a framework,

372
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,220
but you don't have it.

373
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,660
Or rather, you have it,

374
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:15,300
but you don't care.

375
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,820
I'll take it into consideration.

376
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:22,940
You're especially used to

377
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:25,060
solving problems with violence.

378
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:31,060
Like yesterday,

379
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,660
when Hui Ba didn't tell the truth,

380
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:34,460
your first reaction was

381
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:36,100
to beat him until he talks.

382
00:24:36,780 --> 00:24:37,780
Last night,

383
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,260
Hui Ba died.

384
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,660
(Everyone was terrified,)

385
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,740
(except for you.)

386
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:45,060
You calmly said, "Carry the body away".

387
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:47,460
Come and carry the body away.

388
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,620
(Even the bravest person)

389
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,860
(wouldn't remain indifferent)

390
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:52,740
(when facing a corpse.)

391
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,060
There were more details.

392
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,020
For example,

393
00:24:57,380 --> 00:24:59,460
when we encountered Hui Ba and his gang,

394
00:24:59,460 --> 00:25:00,740
they were armed,

395
00:25:01,660 --> 00:25:03,660
(but you didn't seem nervous at all.)

396
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:07,180
(It was as if
you've never been afraid of death.)

397
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:17,890
Alright. Let's have a rest.

398
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,740
It's so noisy.

399
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:48,340
What's going on?

400
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:50,100
How am I supposed to sleep?

401
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,580
I'm thinking

402
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:54,820
about the "step out" and "step in" lines
from yesterday's song.

403
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:57,500
I'll show it to you.

404
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,260
Don't come near. I want to sleep.

405
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,700
Come on. Take a look.

406
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,900
I don't want to.

407
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,300
Just take a quick look.

408
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:13,060
You've been to Yumen Pass before.

409
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,900
Just a passing mark.

410
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,580
Why did you draw it so seriously?

411
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:19,660
Okay, I'll explain it to you.
Listen carefully.

412
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,700
From our perspective,

413
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:24,460
moving from east to west
is stepping out of the pass.

414
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,060
From west to east
is stepping into the pass.

415
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,980
If there were group of people

416
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,700
who originally occupied the area
outside the pass,

417
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,940
it would be the opposite direction

418
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:41,740
for them to step in and out of the pass.

419
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,980
This means that the song

420
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:57,460
is about them

421
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,300
being somehow forced
to leave Yumen Pass.

422
00:27:00,300 --> 00:27:02,140
After a long time
with no hope of returning east,

423
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,700
they made the foreign land their home.

424
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,740
That's possible.

425
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,980
We'll have to make breakfast today.

426
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:17,820
The one who ran off yesterday

427
00:27:17,820 --> 00:27:19,900
seems to be the cook
in Hui Ba's gang.

428
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:27,580
Stop looking. Make breakfast yourself.

429
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:45,980
Do you think
that these strange occurrences lately

430
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:48,260
are related to the sandstorms?

431
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,340
Fatty Tang was sitting on the ground

432
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,900
and was suddenly dragged away.

433
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,540
(There were prints on his feet.)

434
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,860
An iron shovel

435
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,740
suddenly flew in from a distance,

436
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:11,660
(cutting Hui Ba's throat.)

437
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,260
Who is it?

438
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,100
(Also,)

439
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,180
(our car was filled with sand.)

440
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:18,180
(If all of this)

441
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,100
(was really caused by the sandstorms,)

442
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,380
despite it being a little absurd,

443
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:25,540
everything can be explained.

444
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,540
But why would the sandstorms

445
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,220
cause such occurences at this time?

446
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,860
It's like

447
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:40,660
it has a life of its own.

448
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:00,980
Dong.

449
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,940
The tire tracks that disappeared earlier

450
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:04,980
and the flag

451
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,380
have reappeared.

452
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:11,460
There's a signal.

453
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:14,900
Great. We can leave now.

454
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,980
Dong, can we go now?

455
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,860
I'll pack our things right now.

456
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,420
Okay.

457
00:29:23,420 --> 00:29:24,260
Let's go.

458
00:29:24,260 --> 00:29:25,780
Hurry.

459
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,620
What are you waiting for? Run.

460
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:28,100
Faster.

461
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:32,500
You rascal.

462
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,580
Hurry.

463
00:29:34,580 --> 00:29:36,500
Hurry, everyone, hurry.

464
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,980
What are you dawdling for?

465
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,540
Hurry.

466
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:41,780
Huo Ya, is the matter
with Hui Ba resolved?

467
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,100
Hurry.

468
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,540
Hurry. Get out quickly.

469
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,540
Hurry.

470
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,780
Haven't you found Hui Ba's body?

471
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,820
Everyone, hurry.

472
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:49,100
Is it...

473
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:49,940
Yes.

474
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,860
Ba, our two mates,

475
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,540
the marker,

476
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,220
the pool of blood on the ground,

477
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,860
and the coffin

478
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:00,340
are gone.

479
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,300
Even that old ruin

480
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,660
is all gone.

481
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:05,420
This is terrifying.

482
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:09,220
Since we're all in this together,

483
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:12,140
I advise you to leave quickly.

484
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,140
Go, because it's too dangerous here.

485
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,020
If we don't leave soon, the next ones

486
00:30:19,020 --> 00:30:20,580
to disappear without a trace
might be us.

487
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,260
Let's go.

488
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:24,620
Everyone, hurry.

489
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,620
Hurry up.

490
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:27,420
Faster.

491
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:28,300
Liuxi.

492
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,540
Let's go.

493
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,820
Let's go.

494
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:52,580
Look.

495
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:54,220
The flag has appeared again.

496
00:30:56,740 --> 00:30:58,700
But Hui Ba and the other two's bodies
went missing,

497
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,220
and so did the coffin.

498
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,580
Or you could say the entire place

499
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:03,740
is gone.

500
00:32:00,140 --> 00:32:01,140
What's wrong, Dong?

501
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,780
Want to study the rocks?

502
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,140
Is there a rock here?

503
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,180
I can't let you come for nothing, can I?

504
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,580
It's up ahead.

505
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,260
Love you, Dong.

506
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,900
Thanks, Dong.

507
00:32:38,020 --> 00:32:38,820
Liuxi.

508
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:40,620
Let's go.

509
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,820
Liuxi, let's go.

510
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,700
Liuxi, let's go.

511
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,300
Liuxi.

512
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:50,500
I was too anxious back then.

513
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,300
Liuxi.

514
00:32:53,540 --> 00:32:55,340
Calling full name
is too long and troublesome.

515
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:56,220
It's convenient to call.

516
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,700
Alright. Whatever you say.

517
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:03,940
How's your wound?

518
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,300
How's your wound?

519
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,460
It's better.

520
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,560
I changed the bandage this morning.

521
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,060
It's not bleeding
and doesn't hurt,

522
00:33:13,060 --> 00:33:14,620
but it's a little damp.

523
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,420
That's normal. Just take care of it.

524
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
We've traveled this far,

525
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:22,300
and so much has happened along the way.

526
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,060
It always feels like

527
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,100
something is leading me home.

528
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,340
That song?

529
00:33:28,340 --> 00:33:29,140
Yes.

530
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:31,020
I can hum that song,

531
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,620
but I don't know how to say.

532
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:36,420
Besides, on this journey,

533
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:38,220
you haven't even seen Kong Yang's trace.

534
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:45,220
But we only explored a small section.

535
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:48,700
I believe we'll find something
if we keep looking.

536
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,300
Is it possible

537
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,500
that we're looking in the wrong place?

538
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:55,460
Throughout history,

539
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,300
many stories have circulated
about Dalpur,

540
00:33:57,500 --> 00:34:00,140
and many people
have offered various explanations.

541
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:02,860
Like the Bermuda Triangle,

542
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:05,940
they're saying
it's due to magnetic anomalies,

543
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,540
parallel worlds,

544
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,980
black holes, and even aliens.

545
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:11,820
But I've never believed any of that.

546
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:13,140
Do you now?

547
00:34:13,300 --> 00:34:14,740
Not really.

548
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:18,060
Look.

549
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:20,740
After we entered Seadragon Heap,

550
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:24,300
we were cut off from the outside world
for two days due to the storm,

551
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,860
and all sorts of strange things happened

552
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,660
which can't be explained.

553
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:30,660
But there's one explanation
that makes sense,

554
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,100
which is that we entered

555
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,340
another Seadragon Heap.

556
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,340
Let's temporarily call it

557
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,380
Seadragon Heap 2.

558
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,660
This is Seadragon Heap 1.

559
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,740
We left our tire tracks here.

560
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,420
There's also a flag,
but Seadragon Heap 2 doesn't.

561
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,260
After the sandstorm,

562
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,700
Seadragon Heap 2 appeared,

563
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,860
but that place is too strange.

564
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:01,220
(Sandstorms can hurt people,)

565
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,560
(and there's a coffin
with shadow puppets inside.)

566
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:11,100
If Kong Yang's photo really exists,

567
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:14,940
then she must be in Seadragon Heap 2.

568
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,900
All of this I've just speculated about

569
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,340
is based on my own guesses.

570
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,220
What I want to know most about

571
00:35:26,220 --> 00:35:27,500
is the reason

572
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,580
that caused the appearance
of Seadragon Heap 2,

573
00:35:30,340 --> 00:35:31,220
or rather,

574
00:35:31,220 --> 00:35:32,500
how did we enter

575
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:33,780
another world?

576
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:36,980
Forget about it.

577
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,100
Let's go back.

578
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:46,940
Okay.

579
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,180
We'll go back.

580
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:56,000
(Observe desert rules.
No trespassing nature reserves.)
