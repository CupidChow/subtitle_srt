00:01:41,144 --> 00:01:43,880
=Episode 5=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:11,310
Bro, two cars are coming.

4
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,200
They are not here to
steal away our business, are they?

5
00:02:16,376 --> 00:02:17,560
(H-F8819)

6
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,630
Can you drive with your heart?

7
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:32,960
I'm fine.

8
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,000
Are you sure about that?

9
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,680
Oh my god.

10
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,240
Dong, someone is following me.

11
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:41,840
The rear car is blocking us.

12
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,120
There must be a car up ahead
trying to intercept us.

13
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,590
How about leaving Tang behind?

14
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,710
Sacrifice him in order to save us.

15
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:53,000
There are enough supplies in the car

16
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,240
for both of us anyway.

17
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:55,870
Liuxi, Liuxi.

18
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:57,240
How could you come up with this idea?

19
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,680
Why leave me behind?

20
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,190
We are coming together.

21
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,400
When you speak ill of me,

22
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,590
you're not as united as you are now.

23
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,800
When did I bad mouth you?

24
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,000
How did you know that?

25
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,240
I don't have to know everything.

26
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,840
He can talk behind your back,
so he can do the same thing to me.

27
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:13,800
You are right.

28
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:21,310
Look what you did to me.

29
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:23,040
Just leave me behind when we're in danger.

30
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,310
Good for you.

31
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,000
Your hearts are too dark.

32
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,680
I am still too innocent.

33
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:58,800
Quick.

34
00:04:59,070 --> 00:04:59,750
Quick.

35
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,310
Hurry up!

36
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,680
Look at the road you brought!

37
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,510
Chang Dong.

38
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,870
How about this?

39
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,360
I can have a talk with them.

40
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:58,160
And find out what they want.

41
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,190
Wait a second.

42
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,600
If you are going to talk tough,

43
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,040
maybe it's more effective for me to do that.

44
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,870
Just calm down. They have weapons.

45
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:14,560
Oh, right.

46
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,240
You can't go out later.

47
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,240
I don't want to let them know

48
00:06:19,310 --> 00:06:20,870
that there is a pretty lady in my car.

49
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:26,800
Go ahead.

50
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:27,920
I can protect you.

51
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:39,430
I’m halfway there,

52
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,390
carrying the cigarettes.

53
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:42,950
If you don’t mind,

54
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:43,950
we could be friends.

55
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,000
Do you have a light?

56
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,480
We’re being treated like a hijacker.

57
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:53,870
Let’s go off and take a look.

58
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:54,720
Okay.

59
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:56,080
(Hui Ba)

60
00:07:04,776 --> 00:07:06,120
(Huo Ya)

61
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,120
What are you going to do?

62
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
Retrieve the body.

63
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,000
What?

64
00:07:10,310 --> 00:07:10,800
Yes.

65
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,070
None of us are easy.

66
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,310
I wonder if you could bend the rules

67
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,190
and let us go.

68
00:07:16,950 --> 00:07:17,800
Don’t worry.

69
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,390
I'm not going to

70
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,070
stop you from getting rich.

71
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,920
Be nice, okay?

72
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,920
See if they have guns in the car.

73
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:32,720
Okay, I got it.

74
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:34,920
Bring the cigarettes.

75
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,240
Keep the road wide.

76
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,070
We are not the unreasonable people.

77
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:45,430
Good for Chang Dong.

78
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,630
Liuxi, I have no knife. But I have this.

79
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,240
If something is terrible,
we'll have to fight them later.

80
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,510
There is still water in the car.

81
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:55,000
He doesn’t sell us out, right?

82
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,160
He is not like you.

83
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,560
How dare you look at me like that?

84
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,270
Is there any alcohol in the car?

85
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,040
Yes, a couple of bright beers.

86
00:08:04,190 --> 00:08:04,680
I will get them.

87
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,190
Wait here. Let me take a look.

88
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,160
Liuxi, they are coming.

89
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:12,190
We should get the drop on them.

90
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:23,120
What’s going on?

91
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,360
Are you not done?

92
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,870
What happened?

93
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,000
I am not sure.

94
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,030
What?

95
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:54,790
Bro,

96
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:56,200
there is a lady in the car,

97
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,910
who looks a lot like the picture

98
00:08:57,910 --> 00:08:59,120
in your book.

99
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Are you sure?

100
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,840
Why don't you take a look?

101
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,360
Nice to meet you.

102
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,840
I am sorry.

103
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,510
I don't know it's you, Liuxi.

104
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:17,080
I am so careless that

105
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,790
I should be punished.

106
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:20,960
You know me?

107
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:22,240
No.

108
00:09:22,790 --> 00:09:24,030
But now I know you.

109
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,440
Liuxi, are you cutting on?

110
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,670
The wind is heavy tonight.

111
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,630
Why not

112
00:09:29,910 --> 00:09:31,600
come with us?

113
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Buddies, serve them well.

114
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,200
Let’s go.

115
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:43,080
Have you seen him?

116
00:09:45,870 --> 00:09:46,790
No.

117
00:09:57,870 --> 00:09:58,870
One pair two of...

118
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,960
Who is it?

119
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,000
I don’t know.

120
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,200
Let’s go out and see.

121
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:41,080
-Ba.
-Ba.

122
00:10:55,670 --> 00:10:56,870
I am so sorry.

123
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,840
We’ve been mining for the past two years,

124
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:01,790
and the two mines we mined in a row

125
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:03,270
were the chicken nest mine.

126
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:05,480
We have no solutions.

127
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,630
So we tried to find another way out.

128
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,270
It's so dark outside,

129
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:11,510
and I can't see things clearly.

130
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,720
So I didn't recognize you, Liuxi.

131
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:15,080
You didn’t meet me.

132
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,750
How could you know I am Liuxi?

133
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,840
Well, it's hard to say.

134
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,240
Huo Ya.

135
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,240
Help me unfold it.

136
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:31,550
Do it again. This way.

137
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:32,870
It’s here.

138
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:33,910
Look at it.

139
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,720
After the mine closed,

140
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,270
we had no livelihood.

141
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,150
A new quarry just opened up.

142
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:45,600
So we found some rare stones,

143
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,480
and sold them to the bosses for a living.

144
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:49,840
In fact,

145
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,240
we keep an eye on some tough people

146
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,000
who come in and out of the Dalpur.

147
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,000
If we encountered some tough guys,

148
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,790
and we got in trouble,

149
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:01,480
we couldn't handle those things.

150
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:02,910
But some people

151
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:04,270
can be friends with us

152
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:05,750
if we give them something special.

153
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,670
We should take good care of them.

154
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,030
Then why my photo is here?

155
00:12:10,790 --> 00:12:13,150
Those photos have been there for a long time.

156
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,440
But we don't have many of them.

157
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:16,390
These are remade photos,

158
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,270
including yours.

159
00:12:17,270 --> 00:12:18,600
None of them are original.

160
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:20,790
Well,

161
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,630
what do they say about me?

162
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,600
Actually,

163
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,360
this book doesn't have a history.

164
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,030
I just heard about it from others.

165
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:31,150
So I made one by myself.

166
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,240
And I can update new photos if I meet new people.

167
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,030
We don't know the story

168
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:38,270
behind every photo.

169
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
What's going on?

170
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,120
What happened?

171
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,000
What did you do?

172
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:46,030
Pull up the tent.

173
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,440
Put the plug in tightly.

174
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,390
Who can take a look?

175
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:50,600
I can!

176
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:51,840
Quickly!

177
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,720
What's going on?

178
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,000
Good for you.

179
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,720
Your photos are even in the book.

180
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,720
Are you jealous?

181
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,270
That's fair enough.

182
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:05,720
After all, you are the Sand Fang,

183
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:06,960
and you are the guide all the path,

184
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:09,390
but finally my photos are in the book.

185
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:13,080
Take the time to think about

186
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,200
who you really are.

187
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:17,200
And why your photos are in the book,

188
00:13:17,910 --> 00:13:20,360
and why these people are afraid of you.

189
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,390
Oh right.

190
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,720
Just now you jumped out of the window,

191
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:28,240
and you are more like a bandit

192
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,480
than them.

193
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,120
We can handle this tomorrow morning.

194
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840
These bunch of cowards.

195
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:37,720
Liuxi.

196
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,320
It's still dark.

197
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,000
You can sleep here if you don't mind.

198
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:43,670
Okay.

199
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:44,910
Thanks.

200
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:52,000
Go get our stuff.

201
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,720
Are we really staying here with them?

202
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,320
Or what?

203
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:08,720
You are a man. Don't whine about it.

204
00:14:15,870 --> 00:14:17,150
All right. Let's go.

205
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,790
It's going to kill me.

206
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:55,510
Liuxi.

207
00:14:55,510 --> 00:14:56,480
We are going to sleep now.

208
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,480
Why are you still drinking so much water?

209
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:58,320
You got a problem?

210
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,080
Dong.

211
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:10,150
I had a feeling Liuxi wasn't normal.

212
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,080
I told you not to mess with her.

213
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,030
Is it too late for me

214
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,240
to get along with her now?

215
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:21,360
Well, it depends on what you want.

216
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,320
If you just want to be safe on the way,

217
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,480
and you behave yourself,

218
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:26,960
then she won't bother you.

219
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,150
I forgot to tell you,

220
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:39,200
if anything happens at night,

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,270
just ignore it.

222
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:43,150
What do you mean?

223
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,000
This place is so weird.

224
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,240
Especially

225
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:49,480
on windy nights,

226
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,120
it's haunted.

227
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,790
Really?

228
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:56,630
When the wind blows,

229
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,120
you can listen to it.

230
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:00,120
It sounded like a whine, like a ghost crying.

231
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,360
I was scared to death.

232
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,030
The sound

233
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,720
was right above my head.

234
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:09,360
You must close your eyes,

235
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:10,600
not open them,

236
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,870
as if you could not hear the sound.

237
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,270
If you open your eyes,

238
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:15,840
you're dead.

239
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,120
That's right.

240
00:16:17,480 --> 00:16:19,080
I even saw a ghost.

241
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,480
No wonder

242
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:24,720
someone said
that Yardang Terrace here was originally a city.

243
00:16:24,870 --> 00:16:26,080
The people here

244
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:29,120
blasphemed the gods and were punished by them.

245
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,270
And then

246
00:16:30,270 --> 00:16:32,360
the city lay in ruins.

247
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,240
Where did the people of the city go?

248
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:36,080
They were buried in the ground.

249
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,790
And?

250
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:40,270
They are angry,

251
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,670
so they are crying all the time.

252
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,200
Whenever there is a strong wind,

253
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,120
the sound comes up from the ground.

254
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,960
Just like this.

255
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,630
Listen!

256
00:16:53,030 --> 00:16:54,480
You scared me.

257
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:57,120
Okay, let's stop here.

258
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:57,960
Go get sleep.

259
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,790
Okay.

260
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,870
Let's sleep now.

261
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,070
I shouldn't have drunk the water.

262
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:06,720
Where did you go?

263
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
I have to go to the bathroom.

264
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,030
Can't you hold it in?

265
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,440
I will go with you.

266
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
You're going to walk me to the bathroom?

267
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,440
I have rules as a guide.

268
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,270
Two people must go to the bathroom at night.

269
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,070
Especially the women can't be alone.

270
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,750
Why?

271
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,920
Years ago, an expedition went into the desert,

272
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,270
and a girl went to the bathroom,
and she never came back.

273
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:42,830
Not a person in life, not a body in death.

274
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,030
Later someone speculated that...

275
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:45,920
I don't care.

276
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:46,640
She might have encountered quicksand.

277
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:47,240
Stop.

278
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,160
I can go alone.

279
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,920
I can go with you.

280
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,790
I'm not blind, am I?

281
00:19:40,790 --> 00:19:42,240
Did you also see that?

282
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:48,510
There are shadow puppets

283
00:19:49,640 --> 00:19:51,000
on the camels.

284
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:55,400
But there is no sign of a pole.

285
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,200
No one pulls the strings.

286
00:19:59,270 --> 00:20:00,070
What?

287
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:00,880
No one?

288
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,720
Yes.

289
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:14,270
It's not really haunted, is it?

290
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,680
Explain it to me.

291
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,830
How can I explain this?

292
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,480
Have a look.

293
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,680
Wait a minute.

294
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:53,000
There is nothing.

295
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:55,680
How about going inside?

296
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:56,920
At least there are a lot of faces there.

297
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,240
Are you going to the bathroom or not?

298
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,830
I forgot if you didn't tell me.

299
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,440
Now that you say it,
I feel like going to the bathroom again.

300
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:04,550
All right.

301
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,030
Let's go.

302
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,440
How long till dawn?

303
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,400
Almost two hours.

304
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:15,830
Wu, cook for us.

305
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,400
I had a dream.

306
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,880
It really scared me.

307
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:39,960
It's all sand.
What terrible weather today is.

308
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,110
It's terrible.

309
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:41,830
Are you awake?

310
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,000
Yes.

311
00:22:53,270 --> 00:22:54,240
Didn't you say

312
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,440
you were going to play nice for Liuxi?

313
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,440
You're not going to hold her?

314
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,070
Oh right.

315
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:03,480
I will do that.

316
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:08,790
Liuxi.

317
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,070
Let me hold you.

318
00:23:10,070 --> 00:23:10,590
No.

319
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,240
Are you okay?

320
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:34,790
I am satisfied.

321
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:35,240
Are you sure?

322
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:36,550
Yes, I feel great.

323
00:23:36,790 --> 00:23:37,440
Morning.

324
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,510
There's just too much sand.

325
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:42,750
Wu, serve the food for Liuxi.

326
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:43,200
Okay.

327
00:23:43,510 --> 00:23:45,160
Liuxi, I have prepared your food.

328
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:46,070
Alright, do it yourself!

329
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,110
Give me two eggs.

330
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:48,880
Okay.

331
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:51,640
I'm going to ask them about last night.

332
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,030
What's so good about this wine?

333
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:55,440
What is he going to do?

334
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,550
You want to know?

335
00:23:57,550 --> 00:23:58,440
Buddies,

336
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:01,680
I want to ask about something.

337
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,110
What?

338
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:02,640
Just ask me.

339
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,920
Did anything strange

340
00:24:05,920 --> 00:24:07,550
or unusual

341
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,440
happen

342
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,550
in the middle of the night?

343
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,160
Well, something strange...

344
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,440
Listen, the boss needs to know something.

345
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:22,960
You guys should listen carefully.

346
00:24:23,310 --> 00:24:25,960
When you guys go out to pee in the night,

347
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:28,160
have you ever seen anything scary?

348
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,440
Listen, I am serious.

349
00:24:31,830 --> 00:24:33,400
If you make that up,

350
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,480
I'll break your teeth.

351
00:24:36,270 --> 00:24:37,240
Do you understand?

352
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,400
I...

353
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,550
Look at Yardang Terrace at night,

354
00:24:40,550 --> 00:24:42,480
it's like a ghost.

355
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
So scary.

356
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,000
And the sound at night!

357
00:24:47,310 --> 00:24:48,920
When I sleep at night,

358
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,750
I have to put cotton in my ears.

359
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:54,960
Yes!

360
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,200
One time, I went number two,

361
00:24:57,350 --> 00:24:59,790
and suddenly a thing crawled up my foot.

362
00:24:59,790 --> 00:25:01,070
I was scared.

363
00:25:01,070 --> 00:25:02,270
There are jerboas here.

364
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,830
Why are you laughing?

365
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,920
Bro, can we eat this thing?

366
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,070
Yes, you can eat that.

367
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,880
They're a bunch of illiterate,
superstitious people.

368
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,310
All day long,

369
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:18,160
it's either ghost stories or dirty jokes.

370
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:21,110
Every day they have nothing to do but brag.

371
00:25:21,310 --> 00:25:22,350
You ask them,

372
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:24,310
who's actually seen a ghost?

373
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,160
Do you believe them?

374
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,720
If they steal two pieces of flesh from others,

375
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:31,240
they will frame them on a ghost.

376
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:35,790
All right. I won't bother you.

377
00:25:36,070 --> 00:25:38,110
Okay, do your business.

378
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
I got nothing.

379
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,720
What did you ask?

380
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,830
Last night,

381
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,790
I saw shadow puppetry on the tent.

382
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,000
What?

383
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,920
A shadow puppetry?

384
00:26:05,310 --> 00:26:06,270
Were you hallucinating?

385
00:26:06,270 --> 00:26:07,480
I also saw that.

386
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,920
Don't you two gang up and scare me.

387
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,000
What a shadow puppetry?

388
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:12,030
Tell me!

389
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:13,920
It is like...

390
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:16,480
It's like a camel caravan walking.

391
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,030
Dong.

392
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:22,480
It's not the Ghost Camel Caravan, is it?

393
00:26:22,920 --> 00:26:23,440
What?

394
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:24,310
Ghost Camel Caravan?

395
00:26:34,310 --> 00:26:35,030
Dong,

396
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:36,880
when do you expect to

397
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,240
be in the Dalpur town?

398
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:40,680
If we hurry, we'll be there around noon.

399
00:26:41,110 --> 00:26:42,310
Great.

400
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:44,070
Finally get out of here.

401
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,790
I'm going to take a good bath when I get to town.

402
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,680
And have a good sleep.

403
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,160
Tang.

404
00:26:53,830 --> 00:26:56,110
When we get to the town, you just go back to Li City.

405
00:26:56,680 --> 00:26:57,480
What?

406
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,960
I go back?

407
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:00,790
What do you mean?

408
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:03,790
The three of us are aware

409
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,480
that you want the Sheep's Head.

410
00:27:06,830 --> 00:27:09,480
You also know that you can't take it away.

411
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:12,160
And the path later is more difficult for you.

412
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:14,350
So I give you a choice.

413
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:17,750
There is a highway in the town going to Ying City.

414
00:27:17,750 --> 00:27:18,960
The road conditions are very good.

415
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:21,310
You can go straight home that way.

416
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:30,480
I closed the store.

417
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,590
And spent all this money getting here.

418
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,880
Do I have to listen to anything you say?

419
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:33,480
If you ask me...

420
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:34,160
I'm not going back there.

421
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,070
Want to make a fortune?

422
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:44,350
What are you doing?

423
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,310
Why do you have to open it every day

424
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:47,790
when it's covered?

425
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:49,960
If you grow flowers,

426
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:50,830
do you have to

427
00:27:50,830 --> 00:27:51,830
take out the seeds every day?

428
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:53,440
Eat, sleep, go to the bathroom,

429
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,030
why are you everywhere?

430
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:01,000
How soon will I get better?

431
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:03,350
You're infected. You need to amputate.

432
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:04,440
From here.

433
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,350
Do you believe I will kill you?

434
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:07,200
Come on.

435
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,160
Don't you know
that the salt crust isn't as good as a knife?

436
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,960
Wounds like this are slow to heal.

437
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,030
If you don't notice,

438
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:15,790
that's amputation, right?

439
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:18,000
Oh right.

440
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,880
You are in the book.

441
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:21,480
So it's better to have some features.

442
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,270
Later,

443
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:25,790
you can have a knife in your right hand
and a cane in your left.

444
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,590
Then no one else has to read the book.

445
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:29,480
Because they know who you are half a mile away.

446
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:30,960
Well, you help me bind up my wound.

447
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,510
I'm not as professional

448
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:35,000
or patient as you.

449
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:36,750
Right, I bound up,

450
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,510
and then you took the bandage off again for fun.

451
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,310
I swear I won't do that again.

452
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:54,160
Okay, this is the last time.

453
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,440
If you still take it off,

454
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:57,200
then you help yourself.

455
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:05,000
So what should we do then?

456
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:05,750
Just go?

457
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
Yes, we can get there around noon.

458
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:10,880
Really?

459
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,400
Or what?

460
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:14,720
So just forget about

461
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,000
what happened yesterday?

462
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:18,000
There's a lot of weird stuff around here.

463
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,200
Do I have to care about all that?

464
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,440
Hui Ba said

465
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,350
that we put the quilt over our heads
and slept it off.

466
00:29:26,270 --> 00:29:28,480
So the shadow puppets have nothing to do with you?

467
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,750
There are a lot of people
who can carve shadow puppets.

468
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:35,350
As long as it is shadow puppets,
does it have anything to do with me?

469
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,720
Don't move.

470
00:29:47,110 --> 00:29:48,350
You know, when you're not talking,

471
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:49,790
you're kind of cute.

472
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:54,680
I'm not in pain.

473
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,880
Buddy, sorry to bother you.

474
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,200
Don't be polite.

475
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,350
I should go.

476
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,400
Goodbye.

477
00:30:09,400 --> 00:30:10,160
Take care.

478
00:30:10,550 --> 00:30:11,720
Liuxi, take care.

479
00:30:22,680 --> 00:30:24,550
From the Dalpur to Ying City,

480
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:27,000
we will come across Hailongdui
in the middle of the Yi'er Highway.

481
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,240
Yes.

482
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,640
The roads there are more dangerous and wilder.

483
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:32,160
Ancient texts say

484
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,110
it's a place haunted by ghosts.

485
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,680

I didn't stay here either.

Prepare for it.

491
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,790
Well, we should take Tong with us.

492
