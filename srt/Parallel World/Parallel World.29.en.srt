00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:47,800
(Gold Foundry)

2
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,840
Hurry up.

3
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,160
Be careful, all of you.

4
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:53,560
Easy does it.

5
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,800
Mr. Zhan, everyone's ready.

6
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,680
(Gold foundry)

7
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,600
Mr. Zhan, are you sure
you want to do this?

8
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,160
Feather Guards
have gathered a large number of troops

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:59,000
to block Miss Qing at the Demon Museum.

10
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:00,480
All we can do is

11
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,720
make a huge scene

12
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:02,960
to draw their attention.

13
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:05,160
The gold foundry is our best choice.

14
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,460
Run!

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,240
Feather Guards.

16
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:24,800
Feather Guards are here.

17
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,640
Mr. Zhan.

18
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,800
The rest of Feather Guards
have arrived, too.

19
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,800
Get in the car now.

20
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,720
We've worked hard
in Huyang City for so long.

21
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
It's time to claim it.

22
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,000
Great job, Mr. Zhan.

23
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
You've worked hard, Mr. Zhan.

24
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,000
Mr. Zhan.

25
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,840
Miss Qing is looking for you.

26
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,240
When Scorpion Eye
usually causes trouble,

27
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,640
it's only considered banditry.

28
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
At most, Black Stone City
would only keep an eye out for us

29
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,660
and have local authorities
pay more attention.

30
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,520
Your occupying the city now

31
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,000
is totally different in nature.

32
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,360
If Black Stone City
launches a full-scale attack on us,

33
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,280
the whole Scorpion Eye will be doomed.

34
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,040
I...

35
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,720
The plan to open up the Demon Museum
must be sped up.

36
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,180
Without external assistance, we won't last
more than three to five months.

37
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,960
- All I want to say is...
- Jiang Zhan.

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,200
This isn't the Gold Mine Mountain.

39
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,600
Before you do anything,

40
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:42,480
you must take the whole Scorpion Eye
into consideration.

41
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,880
Even if there are individual sacrifices,

42
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:46,200
they don't matter for the greater good.

43
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,480
As I've said before,
everyone has their own responsibility.

44
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,480
I can handle anything inside the pass.

45
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:53,360
You should worry about yourself.

46
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,480
Keep going.

47
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,280
Hurry up and keep going.

48
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,880
Qingzhi.

49
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,040
Can you reconsider this?

50
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:24,120
To open the Demon Museum,

51
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,960
we need two Sheep's Horn Cups.

52
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,440
We only have one.

53
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,040
It's too risky.

54
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,960
Qingzhi.

55
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:33,560
Miss Qing.

56
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,240
You can't go.

57
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,360
Miss Qing.

58
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,300
Take a few people with me
to the Demon Museum.

59
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,800
Monkey, Tiger.

60
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,560
Get some people.

61
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,080
Bring your people and come with me.

62
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,240
Okay.

63
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,800
The city spirit.

64
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,720
The city spirit is disintegrating.

=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

66
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,700
=Episode 29=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

67
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,799
If there's nothing more, I'll go first.

68
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,320
Chang Dong.
Do you think I'm that simple-minded?

69
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,440
That I think Ye Liuxi
opening the Demon Museum

70
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:49,519
and causing Camellia's disaster

71
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,200
would be enough to ensure
that you do as I say

72
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:53,919
and kill her?

73
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,279
I haven't gotten

74
00:10:58,519 --> 00:10:59,759
to the most crucial point yet.

75
00:11:08,679 --> 00:11:09,480
Long Zhi.

76
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,360
Do you know that two years ago,

77
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,080
you only survived because of someone?

78
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:25,360
Do you know why my family, the Long family,
is the head of the sorcerers?

79
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,440
My family has two unique skills.

80
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,360
One

81
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:29,679
is the Dragon Tiger Ascendance,

82
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:30,960
which is immensely powerful.

83
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,039
Two

84
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,960
is the ability
to control the Silver Silkworms,

85
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:36,039
and thus the power to resurrect.

86
00:11:36,559 --> 00:11:38,200
One uses seven fingers
to pluck the string

87
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,940
and three fingers
to prolong someone's life.

88
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:42,500
Inside the pass,
there's this exotic beast

89
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,039
called the Silver Silkworms Heartstring.

90
00:11:44,679 --> 00:11:45,720
A male and a female,

91
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,440
separated by distance,

92
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,679
yet able to resonate with each other.

93
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,519
They're in my hands.

94
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,399
What have you done to me?

95
00:11:57,159 --> 00:11:58,960
Ye Liuxi
forced the Demon Museum to open.

96
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,000
To people outside of the pass,

97
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,360
it's a catastrophe.

98
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,159
Have you ever wondered,

99
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:05,879
out of everyone in Camellia,

100
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,360
why were you the only survivor?

101
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,799
On May 25th, two years ago,

102
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,000
the day of Camellia's tragedy,

103
00:12:14,799 --> 00:12:16,200
if it hadn't been for me,

104
00:12:16,759 --> 00:12:18,440
you would have died in the sandstorm.

(Travel magazine)

106
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:35,800
(Chang Dong, a desert guide,
leads you on an extreme adventure.)

107
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,919
(Marriage Proposal Plan)
There's a couple

108
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,960
over there holding hands.

109
00:12:57,280 --> 00:12:58,760
(Travel magazine)

110
00:13:13,799 --> 00:13:15,600
Take this woman away.

111
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,000
Kong Yang.

112
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,399
I planted the Heartstring in you,

113
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,240
extending your life by three years.

114
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:32,360
Did you also

115
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,799
take that photo of Kong Yang?

116
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:38,960
All along,

117
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:42,320
we all wanted to find someone
from outside the pass to eliminate Ye Liuxi.

118
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,200
We thought

119
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,840
about bringing that person to Ye Liuxi

120
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,799
but with a different approach.

121
00:14:48,799 --> 00:14:51,360
You wanted her to come to me instead.

122
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:52,879
That's right.

123
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,740
The Heartstring can extend one's life
for three years at a time only,

124
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,799
and it's been over two years now.

125
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,759
Luckily, you followed Ye Liuxi
into the pass in time.

126
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:03,279
Otherwise, in a little while,

127
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,720
you might have suddenly dropped dead.

128
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:08,639
Chang Dong.

129
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,039
Your time is running out.

130
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,919
Don't you want to extend your life?

131
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:00,919
Yu.

132
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,200
- Chang Dong!
- Chang Dong.

133
00:16:04,519 --> 00:16:06,519
- You're late.
- You're late.

134
00:16:06,519 --> 00:16:09,240
- Camellia Nineteen are here.
- Camellia Nineteen are here.

135
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,080
- You're the only one missing.
- You're the only one missing.

136
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,200
Chang Dong.

137
00:16:18,559 --> 00:16:19,159
Chang Dong.

138
00:16:19,399 --> 00:16:20,000
Why?

139
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,500
If you don't want
to help us get revenge, that's fine.

140
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,799
But why do you trust her

141
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:27,919
and even help her?

142
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,240
You tell me.

143
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:31,159
What

144
00:16:31,159 --> 00:16:32,080
about my son?

145
00:16:32,159 --> 00:16:35,919
What is he going to do without me?

146
00:16:41,159 --> 00:16:42,200
Do you still have conscience?

147
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,200
Do you?

148
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:51,559
- Show us.
- Where's your conscience?

149
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:53,240
Do you still have a conscience?

150
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:53,679
(Chang Dong.)

151
00:16:54,559 --> 00:16:55,639
(Your time is running out.)

152
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:57,660
(Don't you want to extend your life?)

153
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,279
(Ye Liuxi
forced the Demon Museum to open)

154
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,919
(and led to Camellia's tragedy.)

155
00:17:01,919 --> 00:17:03,480
(Seeking revenge for his woman,)

156
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,279
(isn't that what a man should do?)

157
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:05,960
Kong Yang.

158
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:10,960
Kong Yang, I'm sorry.

159
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,200
I still have unfinished business. Kong Yang.

160
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:14,680
Liuxi didn't do it on purpose.

161
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:16,279
She didn't do it on purpose.

162
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,359
Kong Yang. I'm sorry.

163
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:20,359
I'm sorry.

164
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:21,079
Chang Dong.

165
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,039
Why do you keep apologizing?

166
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:30,480
I want to go home.

167
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,400
No one can find us.

168
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,000
What should we do?

169
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,480
- I want to go home.
- I want to go home.

170
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,319
Run!

171
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,680
I dare you to run again.

172
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,599
Ocean Guardian, can't you learn

173
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:01,599
from Valley Guardian?

174
00:18:02,759 --> 00:18:04,079
You're the one always causing trouble.

175
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,680
I think you need a lesson.

176
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Does it hurt?

177
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,400
I told you not to run.

178
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,400
Chang Dong is still sleeping?

179
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,559
Yeah, he's still sleeping.

180
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
How long has he been sleeping?

181
00:18:18,599 --> 00:18:20,440
I don't know how long,

182
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:22,279
but he's been sleeping
for quite a while.

183
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,720
Oh, right.

184
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:25,799
He said

185
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:27,400
not to wake him up

186
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,519
when he's asleep.

187
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,400
Mr. Zhao.

188
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:16,119
You can trust me to handle things.

189
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,200
Besides killing Ye Liuxi,

190
00:19:20,839 --> 00:19:22,200
does he have any other choice?

191
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:26,759
He won't do it.

192
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,799
Have you forgotten
that he risked his own life

193
00:19:30,079 --> 00:19:31,119
to save Ye Liuxi

194
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,720
at Gold Mine Mountain?

195
00:19:33,319 --> 00:19:34,960
A death threat

196
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,000
wouldn't faze someone like him.

197
00:19:39,119 --> 00:19:39,920
I bet

198
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,759
you have another plan up your sleeve.

199
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,880
This is your only chance

200
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,200
to save Ding Liu.

201
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:04,799
Fire.

202
00:20:15,119 --> 00:20:15,920
Fire it.

203
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,279
Go.

204
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,759
Doctor!

205
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:05,000
Help!

206
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:25,920
Take a look.

207
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:28,640
So this is not hair.

208
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,030
It's the roots of a plant.

209
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,880
Have you ever suddenly felt very sleepy?

210
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:35,510
Yes.

211
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,160
I sleep soundly at night.

212
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,270
I can't even wake up the next day.

213
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,270
That's because of the Parasitic Flower.

214
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,830
What's the Parasitic Flower?

215
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,440
Look.

216
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:48,030
This here is a Parasitic Flower.

217
00:21:48,590 --> 00:21:50,540
(Host dies upon blooming.)
It's a plant that can parasitize

218
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:53,510
(Attempts to remove it can be fatal.)
on humans and other animals.

219
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,030
Its seeds entered through scalp wounds

220
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,480
and draw nutrients from you, the host.

221
00:21:58,790 --> 00:21:59,680
Quietly,

222
00:22:00,270 --> 00:22:01,000
it takes root,

223
00:22:01,070 --> 00:22:01,720
sprouts,

224
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,590
and grows.

225
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,510
The host becomes increasingly drowsy.

226
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,480
After it sprouts from the scalp,

227
00:22:07,550 --> 00:22:08,680
and when it blooms,

228
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,270
the host will lose consciousness

229
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,750
and become its fertilizer.

230
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,720
Am I still in danger now?

231
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:17,880
Its main body is already dead.

232
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:18,790
However,

233
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,720
its roots are very developed.

234
00:22:22,030 --> 00:22:24,790
There may still be fine roots inside.

235
00:22:24,790 --> 00:22:26,000
It's not easy to clean them up.

236
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,480
But these roots in the body

237
00:22:29,510 --> 00:22:30,880
are not a big deal.

238
00:22:31,590 --> 00:22:32,920
If you don't mind,

239
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:33,750
I think

240
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,240
you don't have to pull them out.

241
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:36,550
I do mind.

242
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,750
It's going to hurt a lot.

243
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:40,310
That's fine.

244
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,270
Just pull them out.

245
00:23:25,510 --> 00:23:26,310
Hurry up.

246
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,550
Let go. I want to go home.

247
00:23:28,550 --> 00:23:29,400
Get up.

248
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,550
Don't touch me.

249
00:23:30,550 --> 00:23:32,270
Let me go. I want to go home.

250
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,960
Move faster.

251
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:46,830
Done.

252
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:48,680
Is it okay?

253
00:23:48,680 --> 00:23:49,680
No problem.

254
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,310
Pay up.

255
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:55,640
(From now on,)

256
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,590
(you don't have to worry
about not having shelter)

257
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:58,790
(or other basic needs.)

258
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,720
(You owe me your gratitude.)

259
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,240
Here's some Sacred Hexagrass.

260
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:09,110
It relieves pain.

261
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,200
Thank you.

262
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,000
What is your name?

263
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,830
My name's Ye Qingzhi.

264
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,350
I'm Jiang Zhan.

265
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,070
Jiang Zhan.

266
00:24:46,790 --> 00:24:47,700
What's the matter, Qingzhi?

267
00:24:48,790 --> 00:24:51,000
I want to take a bath
in the pool down there.

268
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:52,960
But the key to the Golden Pool

269
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:54,680
is with Feathered Guards.

270
00:24:54,920 --> 00:24:55,920
Let's go get it, then.

271
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
Stop right there.

272
00:25:09,550 --> 00:25:10,510
Jiang Zhan.

273
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,750
Where are you going?

274
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,920
I need to relieve myself.

275
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:18,070
You just went.

276
00:25:18,270 --> 00:25:19,720
Do you think I believe you?

277
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,400
What are you holding in your hand?

278
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,200
Did you secretly take some gold?

279
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,550
Hand it over.

280
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:28,550
You little brat,

281
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:29,510
don't run.

282
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:32,790
Don't run.

283
00:25:33,070 --> 00:25:33,960
Jiang Zhan.

284
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,200
Did you get the key?

285
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:41,030
I've stolen the key to the Golden Pool.

286
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:44,110
It will be easier for you
to bathe here from now on.

287
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:45,590
Are you done?

288
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,240
I'm worried Feathered Guards
can't find us.

289
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,480
Something bad will happen then.

290
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,220
Are you really so afraid
of Feathered Guards?

291
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:51,680
Do you plan

292
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,550
to hide here forever?

293
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,400
Of course.

294
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,240
At least we are comfortable here.

295
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:58,550
We dig up gold for them,

296
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,160
but they give us cold food.

297
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,270
I won't stay here forever.

298
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:05,070
I want to leave this place

299
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:08,400
and become the leader in the pass.

300
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,270
I'll go with you, then.

301
00:26:10,790 --> 00:26:11,680
You?

302
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,590
You're not strong enough,

303
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,070
and you can't fight.

304
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,350
You might drag me down.

305
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,110
Didn't we agree on it?

306
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:21,790
I teach you how to read,
and you teach me how to fight.

307
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:22,750
That's right.

308
00:26:23,270 --> 00:26:25,350
I learned how to read,

309
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,790
but did you learn how to fight?

310
00:26:27,510 --> 00:26:29,720
How will you deal with Feathered Guards
if you can't fight?

311
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:32,720
How will you save these slaves?

312
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,200
Didn't you want to learn how to fight?

313
00:26:51,590 --> 00:26:52,720
Get up. We'll do it again.

314
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:10,510
It's Golden Snake.

315
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:12,750
It's the legendary Golden Snake.

316
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,270
Qingzhi.

317
00:28:22,270 --> 00:28:24,400
Don't go there. It's dangerous.

318
00:28:25,310 --> 00:28:26,440
Qingzhi.

319
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,790
Qingzhi.

320
00:28:36,070 --> 00:28:37,480
Let's go, Qingzhi.

321
00:28:37,960 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm afraid Golden Snake will come back.

322
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,110
Hurry, Qingzhi.

323
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:52,880
Qingzhi.

324
00:28:57,350 --> 00:28:58,240
Qingzhi.

325
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,400
Hurry up. Let's go.

326
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,240
Quickly, get me two oil lamps.

327
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,640
I think there's something inside.

328
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:04,880
Hurry.

329
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,510
Is this real gold?

330
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:37,590
If it's real, we're rich.

331
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:39,030
(Immortal can go in and out at will.)

332
00:29:39,030 --> 00:29:41,030
But we can't get out.

333
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:48,000
(Immortal can go in and out at will.)

334
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:07,270
(The Bone of Liuxi)

335
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,030
The Bone of Liuxi.

336
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,920
The Soul of Wangdong.

337
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:16,340
It says here that there's a passage
beneath Golden Pool

338
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,070
that leads out of the mine.

339
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,680
(The Bone of Liuxi)

340
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,110
Jiang Zhan.

341
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:29,110
Thank you for teaching me how to read.

342
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:32,590
I finally know who I am.

343
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,060
