(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,900
As Liuxi said,

4
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,980
there are three conditions.

5
00:01:48,980 --> 00:01:50,020
For each one you fulfill,

6
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:52,220
you can exchange for one-third
of Black Stone City's safety.

7
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,860
You can choose the areas yourselves.

8
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:54,860
We don't care about that.

00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,920
(West Market, East Market)

12
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:10,700
In return
for prolonging Chang Dong's life,

13
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:16,700
I can only get one-third
of Black Stone City.

14
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,060
Mr. Long.

15
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,380
Let me remind you
that I am the only one in the entire pass

16
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:24,660
willing to make such a foolish deal.

17
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,740
But if I were to bite the bullet,

18
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,460
so what if I decided I didn't want
the three of them?

19
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:32,420
Also, she let slip one thing.

20
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,500
All conditions

21
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:37,420
must be based on Chang Dong's survival.

22
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:39,780
Continuing the Heartstring
for three years

23
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,620
to prolong Chang Dong's life

24
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,220
in exchange for one-third
of Black Stone City

25
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:46,220
and three years of peace.

26
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,180
Chang Dong's family members?

27
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,100
We're here.

28
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,580
How is it?

29
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,680
The patient
is in critical condition now.

30
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,780
He had a sudden cardiac arrest.

31
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:30,740
We're resuscitating him.

32
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,020
He's in a life-threatening state.

33
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,980
We will do everything we can
to save him.

34
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:37,060
However, please be mentally prepared.

35
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:39,380
This is a critical condition notice.
Please sign it.

00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:19,940
This way,

41
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:22,740
the Long family, the Qian family,

42
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,300
Feather Guards, too,

43
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,940
will have three years of peace.

44
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,900
As long as you pluck the string.

45
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,720
Father.

46
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,340
Ye Liuxi.

47
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,140
Plucking and retrieving the string

48
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:16,060
all in an instant.

49
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:19,580
Aren't you afraid I'll change my mind

50
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,100
and take Chang Dong's life?

51
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,740
Why should I worry?

52
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,060
I'm extending Chang Dong's life

53
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,300
as well as the lives
of all Feather Guards and sorcerers.

54
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,220
Of course, you can kill him now.

55
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,860
The entire Black Stone City will
be buried alongside him, after all.

56
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,220
(Liuxi.)

57
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,060
(You did it.)

58
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,260
Old Mrs. Qian.

59
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:35,660
I went to great lengths

60
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,660
to set up such a grand scheme.

61
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:40,140
This isn't
the "Head west to exit Yumen" I want.

62
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:47,180
Long Zhi.

63
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,100
We did everything
according to your instructions.

64
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:53,460
One shouldn't force things.

65
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,300
This is "Head west to exit Yumen".

66
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,220
That's all?

67
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:16,380
Yes.

68
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,100
That is all.

69
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:19,980
Alright.

70
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,940
Now, one-third of Black Stone City

71
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,700
is safe.

72
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:26,900
Within three days,

73
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,300
hand over Jiang Zhan.

74
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,100
You'll have the other one-third then.

75
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:33,100
As for the remaining one-third
for Gao Shen...

76
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,460
How about this?

77
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,340
You should dispatch a squad of Feather Guards
into Gold Mine Mountain with me.

78
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:39,060
If we can find him,

79
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:41,340
I'll consider that one-third yours.

80
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:44,020
That's as good as it gets.

81
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:48,020
Miss Ye, do you have any other requests?

82
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:49,060
Yes.

83
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,460
Three years will pass by quickly.

84
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,220
You will still need to continue plucking
the string then.

85
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,340
But Mr. Long,

86
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:01,380
you'll have to forgive me for being blunt,

87
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,100
but given your old age,

88
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,820
I'm not sure how many more three years
you'll have.

89
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,260
As soon as possible, I hope you can

90
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:09,460
fine an obedient

91
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,500
and sensible successor.

92
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,300
Of course,

93
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,700
by "successor",

94
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,380
I'm not referring to Long Zhi.

95
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,420
Only this way

96
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:21,700
can the people inside the pass

97
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:25,500
live in peace and recuperate.

98
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,700
Chang Dong's family.

99
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,220
The patient has regained consciousness.

100
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,340
The resuscitation was successful.

101
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,620
But the resuscitation process
was quite challenging.

102
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,660
This kind of situation

103
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:56,940
is special.

104
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,740
The resuscitation was successful?

105
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,100
Can we go in to see him now?

106
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:02,300
Not yet.

107
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,380
You'll need to wait for a bit.

108
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,980
We need
to further observe his condition.

109
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,020
Alright.

110
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,180
Thank you, doctor. Thank you.

111
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:09,400
- Thank you, doctor.
- We'll keep in touch with you at any time.

112
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,020
Sure, sure.

113
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,860
Thank you.

114
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:13,700
It worked.

115
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,300
It worked.

116
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,700
This means that Liuxi

117
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,620
has succeeded as well.

118
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,260
Does this mean that Gao Shen
is okay now?

119
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:25,300
My girl, He, must be safe as well.

120
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,820
Can we...

121
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:32,220
Can we see them?

122
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,060
Fatty Tang.

123
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,180
You heard her.

124
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,300
Within three days,

125
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,100
pick a time

126
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,700
to send Jiang Zhan over.

127
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,420
Even a useless man like him

128
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:11,140
can exchange for one-third
of Black Stone City.

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:15,860
Are we going to do

130
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,580
as she said?

131
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,220
Even if it means replacing me,

132
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,660
do we have to do as she said?

133
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:25,060
Long Zhi.

134
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,700
If you are inferior in strength,

135
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,180
you have to yield.

136
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,340
Life has its ups and downs.

137
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:34,460
Ye Liuxi

138
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,780
had also faced defeat at some point.

139
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:40,460
Even she managed to make a comeback.

140
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:43,100
We can surely rise again.

141
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:48,100
Inform Long Lin to bring a few men
with him to the dungeon tomorrow

142
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:51,180
and bring Jiang Zhan out.

143
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,260
You spared Jiang Zhan's life back then,

144
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,940
and now we can use him as a hostage.

145
00:11:57,180 --> 00:12:00,420
It appears
he's finally serving a purpose.

146
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:04,340
But I didn't spare his life

147
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,140
to use him as a hostage.

148
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,140
It's Qingzhi.

149
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,220
Long Zhi.

150
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:43,340
Is she dead?

151
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,180
Ye Liuxi sure
is willing to make sacrifices.

152
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,380
Mr. Long proposed
a series of conditions,

153
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,620
and she agreed
to every single one of them.

154
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,660
Go.

155
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:19,420
You two.

156
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,100
The great contributors of Scorpion Eye.

157
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,140
Go see your Miss Qing.

158
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,540
Mr. Zhan.

159
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,220
Miss Qing is waiting for you
in Black Stone City.

160
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,660
Mr. Zhan.

161
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:02,500
Have you known Miss Qing
since you were kids?

162
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,420
At Gold Mine Mountain?

163
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:06,540
Yes.

164
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:08,620
We met in Gold Mine Mountain.

165
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,500
What was Miss Qing like
when she was young?

166
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,540
She was smart,

167
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:17,780
decisive,

168
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:19,500
and capable of anything.

169
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,620
In my heart,

170
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:26,500
she's never changed.

171
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,260
I know

172
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,940
that whatever she sets her mind to,

173
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,060
she will definitely accomplish it.

174
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,300
Indeed.

175
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,500
I've never seen
anyone as capable as her.

176
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:00,380
Mr. Zhan.

177
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,060
Our men have all retreated
into the city.

178
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:04,360
If the situation deteriorates further,
Miss Qing should leave first.

179
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,200
We'll stick to the original plan.

180
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,840
Everyone will withdraw
from the northeast gate.

181
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,260
Go, let everyone know.

182
00:15:09,260 --> 00:15:09,980
Yes, Mr. Zhan.

183
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
Have you seen Ye Liuxi?

184
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhan, but I didn't.

185
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,260
Qingzhi.

186
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,700
We have to go.

187
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,100
Our top priority is survival.

188
00:16:42,540 --> 00:16:44,060
Ye Liuxi.

189
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,220
Why are you here?

190
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,660
I've told you

191
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,820
that you'll know one day.

192
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,580
Between two Lingzhi mushrooms,

193
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,820
who's the weed, who's the immortal.

194
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:13,420
Kill them!

195
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:51,660
Kill.

196
00:18:54,380 --> 00:18:55,340
Go!

197
00:18:57,620 --> 00:18:59,380
- Qingzhi, no.
- Go.

198
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,380
Go, Mr. Zhan.

199
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,340
Qingzhi.

200
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,740
- Mr. Zhan.
- Qingzhi.

201
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,460
Qingzhi!

202
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,300
Go.

203
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,580
(It's execution time!)

204
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:31,660
(Everyone, come and see.)

205
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,740
(Over there.)

206
00:19:32,740 --> 00:19:33,580
(It's Scorpion Eye.)

207
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,220
(I think this
is the end of the road for them.)

208
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,660
(We have to go.)

209
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:39,540
(Staying here
will only cost us more lives.)

210
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,700
(Jiang Zhan.)

211
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,260
(Since you want to keep her,)

212
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:56,020
(you are the referrer.)

213
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,060
(You need to keep an eye on her.)

214
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,100
(If she does something harmful
to Scorpion Eye in the future,)

215
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,340
(you'll be held accountable.)

216
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:06,700
Pull her up.

217
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,700
(I'm responsible)

218
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,740
(for bringing ruin to Huyang City.)

219
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,340
(I caused Qingzhi
to be displaced outside the pass.)

220
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:15,740
(I once said I would
conquer Black Stone City for her,)

221
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:18,380
(but now,)

222
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:21,660
(she needs to trade one-third of it for me.)

223
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:25,740
(Consider that)

224
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,300
(I conquered
one-third of Black Stone City.)

225
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,860
(Don't trade it for me.)

226
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,340
(It's not worth it.)

227
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,780
(I want to return to Qingzhi's side.)

228
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:40,620
(I want to return to the days
when we depended on each other,)

229
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,580
(back when we were at Gold Mine Mountain.)

230
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:46,260
(Those were the happiest times)

231
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,580
(when Qingzhi had only me,)

232
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,700
(and I had only her.)

233
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,740
(There were no Chang Dong, no Long Zhi,)

234
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:57,020
(no conflicts,)

235
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:59,620
(and no depletion of schemes.)

236
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:02,220
(But now,)

237
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,220
(everything can no longer be undone.)

238
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:28,420

Long Zhi has already been imprisoned,

269
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,260
Long Shen and Old Mrs. Qian

270
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,020
have been demoted to civilians,

271
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,500
and I will also abdicate my position.

272
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:05,220
Li Jin'ao.

273
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,660
From now on,

274
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:08,500
this place shall be yours.

275
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:11,340
I've already put Thiefless away,

276
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,300
rest assured.

277
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,980
There's a step here, huh?

278
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:21,620
The information in the study and in the museum,

279
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,540
feel free

280
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,900
to look into them in the future.

281
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:31,620
Everything you just said,

282
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,820
are they all for real?

283
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,380
Of course.

284
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:37,220
This is also one of the conditions
Ye Liuxi proposed.

285
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:39,420
If you face any issues in the future,
feel free to come to me.

286
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,100
You see,

287
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:46,300
when I get excited,

288
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,860
I have the urge to use the restroom.

289
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:49,820
I think I shall go back and use it.

290
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,180
No need.

291
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,380
There's one here.

292
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:57,780
The toilet rumored inside the pass?

293
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,660
This toilet,

294
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,300
was specially brought by Miss Ye
from far outside the pass,

295
00:25:14,580 --> 00:25:15,780
all the way here

296
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:16,980
just for me.

297
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,180
Now,

298
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,020
it belongs to you.

299
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,300
Liuxi, Gao Shen disappeared
in the Golden Pool last time.

300
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:32,020
We thought he died in the pool.

301
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,420
But later, several miners kept saying

302
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:35,340
seeing someone alike Gao Shen
at the Golden Pool.

303
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,700
But these past few months,

304
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,620
we've turned the mine upside down

305
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:40,020
and still haven't found him.

306
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,060
Could he have escaped?

307
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,660
Impossible.

308
00:25:43,660 --> 00:25:45,660
The Gold Mine Mountain
has only one entrance,

309
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,060
and the underground tunnels
have been sealed off.

310
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:49,700
If Gao Shen is still alive,

311
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,020
he must still be inside.

312
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,620
You all wait here for me.

313
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,780
I'll go in and take a look.

314
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:56,700
Stay safe, Liuxi.

315
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,340
Gao Shen.

316
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,100
Gao Shen, is that you?

317
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,020
It's me, Ye Liuxi.

318
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,060
It's safe now.

319
00:26:33,060 --> 00:26:34,180
You can come out.

320
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:37,540
Gao Shen.

321
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:40,180
Everyone is safe.

322
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,060
I'll take you out

323
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:44,020
to see Liu and the others,

324
00:26:44,020 --> 00:26:44,820
alright?

325
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:05,180
Gao Shen.

326
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,940
I won't stop searching for you

327
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,660
until I find you.

328
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:12,020
I can't disappoint Liu.

329
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,220
Liuxi.

330
00:27:30,300 --> 00:27:31,460
It's been a while.

331
