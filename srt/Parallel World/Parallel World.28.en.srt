00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:43,140
=Episode 28=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:53,180
Gao Shen.

4
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,540
What's wrong?

5
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,660
What's wrong, Gao Shen?

6
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,620
Gao Shen, don't scare me.

7
00:02:05,940 --> 00:02:06,740
Doctor!

8
00:02:06,980 --> 00:02:07,900
Someone, quick!

9
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:09,940
Doctor.

10
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:10,860
Over here.

11
00:02:10,940 --> 00:02:11,380
Quick.

12
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,100
What happened?

13
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,620
Doctor.

14
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,740
What's wrong? Tell me.

15
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:17,580
What's wrong with him?

16
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,260
His injury

17
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:21,220
may not be curable
even if he goes to Black Stone City.

18
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,900
For now, I can only do first aid.

19
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:24,100
Try to stop the bleeding.

20
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,340
You wait outside.

21
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,020
- Doctor.
- Trust us.

22
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,940
- You must save him.
- Go out first.

23
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,980
You must save him.

24
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:36,500
Liuxi.

25
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,260
Liuxi.

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,740
The doctor said

27
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,580
Gao Shen's injuries in his abdomen

28
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:42,860
have harmed his internal organs.

29
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,380
The mine equipment can't keep up,

30
00:02:44,620 --> 00:02:47,940
and going to Black Stone City
may not help either.

31
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:48,700
Liuxi.

32
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:50,580
Let's leave the pass.

33
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,860
We'll go to a major hospital
to find a doctor.

34
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,300
Otherwise, Gao Shen will really die.

35
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:56,380
- Liuxi.
- Okay.

36
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,900
We'll leave the pass.

37
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,820
We'll leave immediately.

38
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,380
Alright?

39
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,660
Don't cry anymore.

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,340
Okay.

41
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,060
Liuxi.

42
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,480
I will take good care of them.

43
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,460
You can rest assured.

44
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:25,860
What's with the military truck?

45
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,460
Well, you see,

46
00:03:29,780 --> 00:03:31,740
there's news from Black Stone City,

47
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,020
saying you killed Jiang Zhan.

48
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,840
So you've become
Scorpion Eye's number one enemy.

49
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,140
Who knows how they'll revenge you?

50
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,220
So, Mr. Zhao has given the order.

51
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,460
Whenever you go out,

52
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,340
we must ensure your safety.

53
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,980
Has Jiang Zhan's body been found?

54
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,420
You must be joking.

55
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,020
So many people saw it.

56
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:50,740
Anyone who falls into the Golden Pool
will end up a mush.

57
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,060
What body can there be?

58
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:53,780
Liuxi.

59
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,140
Let's go.

60
00:03:59,060 --> 00:03:59,900
All ready?

61
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:00,580
Depart!

62
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:26,740
(Liu.)

63
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:28,860
(Take this.)

64
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,840
(If it still bothers you,)

65
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:34,060
(you can use a hairpin
to cover it for now.)

66
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,580
And take it off
when your hair grows back.

67
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,780
Qi once told me

68
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,460
that he wanted you to marry me

69
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,580
when you're grown.

70
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,360
(I thought it sounded good at the time,)

71
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:04,940
(Doctor?)

72
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:05,700
(but now,)

73
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:06,580
(Where's the hospital?)

74
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,940
(I've changed my mind.)

75
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:10,160
(These things)

76
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,540
(should be mutual.)

77
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,340
Please, I beg you.

78
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,460
Save her.

79
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,780
(Being forced together)

80
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:15,860
(won't end well for anyone.)

81
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,780
(After we return,)

82
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,700
(I'll make it clear to Qi)

83
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,260
(that we're not compatible.)

84
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:23,940
(If we force it,)

85
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,240
(it won't do good to us.)

86
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,820
(When I saved you back then,)

87
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,480
(I didn't expect
it would lead to trouble.)

88
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,140
112 men of Scorpion Eye,

89
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:51,620
including the nine elders
of Golden Scorpion,

90
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,180
all were hanged by you alive.

91
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,420
Ocean Guardian.

92
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:23,140
Don't bully He, alright?

93
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
You contributed greatly today,

94
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,180
but don't get arrogant.

95
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,180
Miss Ye.

96
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,340
Please wait a moment.

97
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,380
Let me announce your arrival.

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,980
No need, I'll be quick.

99
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:13,460
Miss Ye.

100
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,380
Please wait a moment.

101
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:14,980
Let me report.

102
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,140
It'll only take one minute.

103
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,140
Both of you,

104
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:19,180
please go to the inner room and wait.

105
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:21,220
Miss Ye.

106
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,460
You better not touch me.

107
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,620
I'm injured right now,

108
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,420
and if I fall down, it'll be your fault.

109
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:31,460
Miss Ye.

110
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,140
Please wait.

111
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,260
Don't touch me.

112
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,220
Miss Ye.

113
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:36,540
Mr. Zhao.

114
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,780
My friend is seriously injured.

115
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,540
Could you please

116
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,300
get the best doctor and sorcerer
to check on him?

117
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:42,540
Don't worry.

118
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,460
I will definitely
make careful arrangements.

119
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,220
The doctors in Black Stone City

120
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,340
are still quite skilled,

121
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,860
and their medical equipment
is more advanced.

122
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,300
But if they are helpless,

123
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,020
I need to have a backup option.

124
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,100
If you don't mind,

125
00:07:53,420 --> 00:07:54,780
please arrange for me to leave the pass.

126
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,380
Of course, I don't mind.

127
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,260
After all,

128
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,420
it's a matter of life and death.

129
00:07:58,420 --> 00:07:59,460
And I believe

130
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,980
the medical standards outside the pass

131
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,260
must be higher than ours.

132
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,380
Thank you.

133
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,900
You all heard that, didn't you?

134
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,380
We did.

135
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,900
Where were we talking just now?

136
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:21,380
Long Zhi.

137
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:24,180
Feather Guards said

138
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:26,100
you took Jiang Zhan away.

139
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:27,900
Why didn't you kill him?

140
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,100
Ye Liuxi.

141
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:32,140
She's looking
into Jiang Zhan's whereabouts.

142
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,100
She has doubts

143
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,140
about Jiang Zhan's death.

144
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:36,100
Where exactly is Jiang Zhan now?

145
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,660
Where he is doesn't matter anymore.

146
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,660
Now, the whole of Scorpion Eye

147
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,620
believe he's dead.

148
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:44,820
I have completely replaced him now.

149
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,960
To eliminate the grass,
you must remove the roots.

150
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:49,220
Keeping him alive
would be a constant threat.

151
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,780
Long Zhi.

152
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,860
Have you fallen for Jiang Zhan

153
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,300
and become soft-hearted?

154
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,180
When have I ever been soft-hearted?

155
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,100
I am the future ruler of Black Stone City.

156
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,260
I can weigh the importance
of the overall situation.

157
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,420
Jiang Zhan's condition

158
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:11,180
won't affect our current plans.

159
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:16,820
Long Shen.

160
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:20,660
I've decided to call it quits.

161
00:09:22,180 --> 00:09:23,940
What do you mean?

162
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,380
Ye Liuxi killed Jiang Zhan

163
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:28,540
and became an enemy of Scorpion Eye.

164
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,460
Naturally, she will seek refuge with us

165
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,580
and obey our commands,

166
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,220
continuing to move in and out
of the pass,

167
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:35,740
helping us transport supplies.

168
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,340
Now that Scorpion Eye is leaderless,

169
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:40,100
you can take control legitimately

170
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,980
and gradually dismantle it
from the inside.

171
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:43,460
Also,

172
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:45,820
one Sheep's Horn Cup
had already been destroyed.

173
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,340
We no longer
need to worry about Ye Liuxi

174
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:49,980
bringing two Sheep's Horn Cups

175
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,420
to open the Demon Museum

176
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,340
and break the gate of Yumen Pass.

177
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,220
Zhao.

178
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,500
How many

179
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,460
Feather Guards

180
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,180
have been brought down by Ye Liuxi?

181
00:10:02,540 --> 00:10:04,820
It was you
who wanted to kill her back then,

182
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,580
and it's still you

183
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,780
who wants to spare her life.

184
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,980
Through this encounter,

185
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,420
I've noticed that Ye Liuxi

186
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,780
has changed.

187
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,900
She's no longer the person

188
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:22,460
who would do anything
to achieve her goals.

189
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:26,220
Since she's forgotten her past completely,

190
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,420
is there any need

191
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,860
to ruthlessly eliminate her?

192
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,820
Mr. Zhao.

193
00:10:31,060 --> 00:10:33,820
Don't let yourself be deceived
by Ye Liuxi's current compliance.

194
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,140
We've used Kui
on both her and Jiang Zhan.

195
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,740
Do you really trust Ye Liuxi now?

196
00:10:39,140 --> 00:10:40,500
Once she remembers everything,

197
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,300
we might lose everything
we've worked for.

198
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,660
Don't take Ye Liuxi for a fool.

199
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,940
She has almost figured everything out

200
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:47,260
and has started suspecting us.

201
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,220
Zhao.

202
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,900
Think about it.

203
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,500
She's a country bumpkin
who was born in the wild.

204
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,620
In just a little over a decade,

205
00:10:55,820 --> 00:10:59,020
she's grown powerful enough
to go against Black Stone City.

206
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,820
Do you think she did so
by winning people over with kindness?

207
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:06,420
As long as she remains,

208
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,020
she'll be a threat to us all.

209
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,220
She came over just now.

210
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,860
You heard what she said.

211
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:14,980
That won't be a problem.

212
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:17,780
Just send over incompetent doctors.

213
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:19,900
The act must be convincing enough,

214
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,300
so that she won't be suspicious.

215
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:23,020
She'll think

216
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,380
that we have done our best

217
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,560
and that is already the extent
of Black Stone City's capabilities.

218
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:28,260
It's not that we don't want to help.

219
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,580
We're powerless to do so.

220
00:11:29,820 --> 00:11:30,980
By doing so,

221
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:33,380
it means we're forcing her to step out.

222
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:34,780
That's exactly what I want.

223
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,500
The plan of "Head west to exit Yumen"

224
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,660
started from Ye Liuxi.

225
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,300
In that case,

226
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:43,020
let it end with her.

227
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,600
That will be a satisfactory completion.

228
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
By the way, Mr. Zhao,

229
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:49,620
help me with something.

230
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,020
Do it within the next two days.

231
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,940
Invite Chang Dong over for a meeting.

232
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:56,340
It's time to use this card.

233
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,300
Doctor.

234
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,940
How's Gao Shen doing?

235
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:02,340
I have bandaged

236
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
his wound.

237
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,860
We just have to wait
and see how he recovers.

238
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,020
Is his life still in danger?

239
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,540
Not for the time being.

240
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,620
Thank you, doctor.

241
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,460
Stay with him for now.

242
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,460
After dinner,
I'll go with you to check on your head.

243
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:15,820
Okay.

244
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:16,300
Go on.

245
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:16,860
I'm going.

246
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,500
You're all back.

247
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,460
I'm glad.

248
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,180
What...

249
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:27,020
You're all injured.

250
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,580
Are you alright?

251
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,700
We're fine.

252
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,260
So, what happened?

253
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,060
I'll tell you next time.

254
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,340
Ocean Guardian is in the courtyard.

255
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,980
It has made a great contribution this time.

256
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,060
Ocean Guardian!

257
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:43,220
Zhao Guanshou seems pretty reliable.

258
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,820
This place looks more professional
than Gold Mine Mountain.

259
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:49,860
I keep thinking

260
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:52,660
about when he died.

261
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,940
Indeed.

262
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,500
Between then and how he acted before,

263
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:58,780
he's like a different person,

264
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:01,500
Had very bad taste.

265
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,820
It's like a mix
of a dragon, a snake, and eagle claws

266
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:06,660
with a few strands of hair on the head.

267
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,620
Fatty Tang.

268
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,060
You had been kidnapped for so many days.

269
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:12,180
Did you see Jiang Zhan?

270
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,260
I did.

271
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,740
Any tattoos on his hands?

272
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,460
Yes.

273
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,820
On which hand?

274
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:19,700
His left hand.

275
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,980
It's exactly the same as Qingzhi's.

276
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,740
Liuxi's is the same as theirs too.

277
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:26,660
Qingzhi even ridiculed Liuxi
for copying her.

278
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:30,540
Which of his arms

279
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:32,860
did you chop off?

280
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:34,940
His left arm.

281
00:14:24,820 --> 00:14:27,300
(If you really are Jiang Zhan's comrade,)

282
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,180
(and together,
you founded Scorpion Eye,)

283
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,820
(Zhao Guanshou would definitely)

284
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,220
(want to get rid of both of you.)

285
00:14:33,220 --> 00:14:34,500
(He couldn't get rid of us,)

286
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,540
(so he used my memory loss to control me)

287
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
(and use me to deal with Jiang Zhan
and Scorpion Eye.)

288
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,900
Chang Dong.

289
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,060
Are you feeling better now?

290
00:14:56,020 --> 00:14:57,020
I feel a lot better.

291
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,820
Look at Ocean Guardian.

292
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,980
After heading to Gold Mine Mountain
with you,

293
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,820
it came back

294
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:04,100
with a whole new level of energy.

295
00:15:04,140 --> 00:15:05,740
It does look quite energetic.

296
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,700
What about you?

297
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:09,380
You went to the museum.

298
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,540
Did you get anything useful?

299
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,860
I did.

300
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,580
I gained

301
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,820
the feeling

302
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:20,180
that in life,

303
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,540
one needs to strive for excellence.

304
00:15:26,020 --> 00:15:26,900
From now on,

305
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,700
don't say anything

306
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:31,740
about how one's origins don't matter.

307
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:34,820
A person's background

308
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,860
affects his life.

309
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,820
Take me, for example.

310
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,380
As you know,

311
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,100
I'm from a branch of the Li family.

312
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,380
Even after all this time,

313
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,620
I haven't achieved much in life,

314
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,060
so I figured

315
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:51,220
I need to go to a big city.

316
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,780
There are more opportunities
in big cities.

317
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
I should go and try my luck.

318
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,820
Who would've
thought that after coming here...

319
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:59,660
You see the way they treat me.

320
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:02,180
They won't even let me visit a museum.

321
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,980
I only got to go in this time

322
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:07,700
thanks to Miss Ye.

323
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,300
Later on,

324
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,420
I must thank Miss Ye properly.

325
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,340
To tell you the truth,

326
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,660
after looking around the museum,

327
00:16:15,820 --> 00:16:17,100
I gained a lot of new knowledge.

328
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,260
(Their Demon Museum)

329
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:21,540
(is completely different)

330
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,100
(from the one I learned about.)

331
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,900
(Take the Kui dragon, for example.)

332
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,100
[The Kui dragon]

333
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,260
It looks like a snake
with the claws of an eagle.

334
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:30,420
It has an oval-shaped head

335
00:16:30,620 --> 00:16:31,500
and on the top of that

336
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,860
is a bit of hair.

337
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:34,540
It's named Kui

338
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:36,940
and is the tenth child of the dragon.

339
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,740
How should I

340
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,020
describe it?

341
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,340
It's a bit like a leech.

342
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:43,060
When it sucks blood,

343
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:45,140
it will secrete a kind of anesthetic

344
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:46,740
which harms

345
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,220
a person's memories.

346
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,980
The description said

347
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,700
there are three types of Kui.

348
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:55,740
The first

349
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,180
is called Devourer.

350
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,900
It can devour a person's memories

351
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,900
or just most of it,

352
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,740
leaving a few memories behind.

353
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:05,340
The second type

354
00:17:05,660 --> 00:17:06,820
is called Doppel.

355
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,180
It can take a person's memories

356
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,220
and replace them seamlessly

357
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,660
as someone else's memories.

358
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,020
It creates an exact replica.

359
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:17,140
The third type is called Filler.

360
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:19,380
It can create a memory from nothing

361
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:20,780
and forcibly make it yours.

362
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,420
It's so mystical.

363
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,540
What are you doing?

364
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:34,620
What are you doing?

365
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,420
What are you doing?

366
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,060
The situation at Gold Mine Mountain
was fishy.

367
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,380
We're taking her in for questioning.

368
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,540
She doesn't have a tongue anymore.

369
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,700
What can you find out?

370
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,620
What's the matter?

371
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:45,100
Dong.

372
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:46,460
They're taking He away.

373
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:47,940
Where are you going?

374
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,380
We're taking her in for questioning.

375
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:50,580
We're coming with her.

376
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:51,380
You can't.

377
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,100
Mr. Zhao wants to see you alone.

378
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,100
Take her away.

379
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:18,900
Mr. Zhao.

380
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:19,860
Chang Dong's here.

381
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,820
Let me make the introductions.

382
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:26,660
This

383
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,660
is Luo Shen's daughter.

384
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:29,380
Long Zhi.

385
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,900
She's Miss Long,
the one you hear of frequently.

386
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:33,180
Please have a seat.

387
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,900
Miss Long was supposedly sick

388
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,460
and unwilling to meet with anyone.

389
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:00,300
So, she was with Jiang Zhan all along,
waiting for the right opportunity.

390
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,060
In that case, the spy you sent

391
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,020
wasn't Liuxi.

392
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,180
It's her.

393
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,180
That's right.

394
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,100
Ye Liuxi's original name

395
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,180
is Ye Qingzhi.

396
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:11,220
She founded Scorpion Eye.

397
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,300
(Kui.)

398
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,500
(It looks like a snake
with the claws of an eagle.)

399
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,780
It harms

400
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:20,660
a person's memories.

401
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,820
The Kui dragon.

402
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:25,540
Mr. Zhao.

403
00:19:25,780 --> 00:19:26,860
I was right, wasn't I?

404
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:28,460
There are no fools

405
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,660
in this game.

406
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:32,380
We were just one step ahead.

407
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,380
Compassion

408
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:35,700
can kill you.

409
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,860
Two years ago,

410
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:40,820
Black Stone City wiped out
Scorpion Eye's main force in Huyang City.

411
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,540
I was the one who used the Kui dragon

412
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,500
to wipe out Ye Qingzhi's memories
inside the pass

413
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,660
and sent her out of the pass.

414
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:49,820
Miss Long.

415
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:51,860
It's almost time for us to leave.

416
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:52,980
Soon,

417
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,860
the Demon Museum

418
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,180
will move with the Sheep's Horn Cup.

419
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:57,100
This place will be pushed out
of the pass.

420
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:57,980
You guys go first.

421
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,660
Got it.

422
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,700
Let's go.

423
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:47,940
All of those from Scorpion Eye
who recognized Ye Qingzhi and I

424
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,300
are no longer around.

425
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,580
I used Ye Qingzhi's identity

426
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:54,700
to control the remnants of Scorpion Eye
in the various markets.

427
00:20:55,780 --> 00:20:56,820
From then on,

428
00:20:57,260 --> 00:20:58,740
she became the traitor who disappeared,

429
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,140
Ye Liuxi.

430
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,300
The Kui dragon enters the body

431
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:05,220
and is able to bewitch people,

432
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,220
but it has a flaw.

433
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,740
It can't hide.

434
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,220
It will leave a trace
on the person's left arm.

435
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,420
I have all three dragons in me.

436
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,460
Ye Qingzhi and Jiang Zhan's dragons

437
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:18,420
came from mine.

438
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,020
I used Devourer

439
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:23,780
on Ye Liuxi

440
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,900
and wiped her memories inside the pass.

441
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,180
(As for Jiang Zhan,)

442
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,020
(I used Doppel)

443
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:31,020
(to switch his memories)

444
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:32,220
(of Ye Qingzhi and I.)

445
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:47,420
I'm rather curious.

446
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,060
Why did you do that?

447
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,540
It seems to me that you don't understand

448
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,920
how Ye Liuxi was
before losing memories.

449
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:55,420
We wanted to live in harmony with her.

450
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,540
But, she was just like Li Wangdong.

451
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,800
She tried to open Yumen by force

452
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,960
and head west to exit Yumen.

453
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,940
Do you know the dangers

454
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,020
her actions could cause
to those beyond the pass?

455
00:22:06,660 --> 00:22:08,460
As long as she's still alive,

456
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,580
no one can rest easy.

457
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,100
If my memory serves me correctly,

458
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,180
Liuxi

459
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:15,220
is different from ordinary people.

460
00:22:15,620 --> 00:22:16,820
That's right.

461
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Those from inside the pass
can't kill Ye Liuxi.

462
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,940
She always manages to survive.

463
00:22:22,820 --> 00:22:24,980
To restore the shadow puppets

464
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,820
and the shadow puppet caravan,

465
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,300
we had to find someone
from beyond the pass

466
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,700
to get rid of Ye Liuxi.

467
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,060
You

468
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,180
are the one I chose.

469
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,740
(I don't remember how I got here.)

470
00:22:43,540 --> 00:22:45,220
(I don't remember who I am.)

471
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:48,260
(I don't even remember this face.)

472
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,540
(After I woke up,)

473
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,900
(I found a cloth bag)

474
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,940
(by this tree.)

475
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,620
Kong Yang's photo

476
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,020
was found inside it.

477
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:38,480
So, on the day of Camellia's disaster,

478
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,500
you were there.

479
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:42,460
That's right.

480
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,580
Two years ago,

481
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,260
it was because Ye Liuxi
forcefully opened the Demon Museum

482
00:23:47,260 --> 00:23:48,820
that Camellia met with disaster.

483
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:50,300
It was Ye Liuxi who gave the order

484
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:51,780
to feed Camellia's bodies

485
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,700
and turned your friends and loved one

486
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,300
into sand monsters.

487
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,140
You said you chose me.

488
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:10,260
You want me to kill Ye Liuxi

489
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,940
and avenge Camellia,

490
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:13,380
right?

491
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,740
Seeking revenge for his woman,

492
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,900
isn't that what a man should do?

493
00:24:36,020 --> 00:24:37,620
I think you don't really understand me.

494
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,620
If everything you just said

495
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,100
is true,

496
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,340
it means Liuxi opened the Demon Museum

497
00:24:45,740 --> 00:24:47,620
and caused the horrific sandstorm.

498
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:50,580
But, Mr. Zhao once said

499
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,380
that no one expected the consequences

500
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,580
to be that serious

501
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,940
and the body and soul of Yumen

502
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,420
to split apart so severely.

503
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,820
Camellia had been the unfortunate one

504
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:04,260
for running into it.

505
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,100
It's true

506
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:21,660
that I lost Kong Yang.

507
00:25:21,900 --> 00:25:23,060
Camellia's gone too.

508
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:25,220
However, whether or not

509
00:25:25,460 --> 00:25:26,900
these things are Liuxi's fault

510
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,260
is not something you can decide
with just a few sentences.

511
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,660
Is it that funny to you?

512
00:25:37,300 --> 00:25:39,900
The whole situation's rather hilarious.

513
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:41,260
But, don't forget

514
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,620
that I'm not from the pass.

515
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,380
Where I'm from,

516
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:47,540
we don't believe in an eye for an eye.

517
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:50,300
You came up with a random story

518
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,780
thinking it's enough to kill Liuxi.

519
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,100
How naive of you.

520
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:57,580
If there's nothing else,
I'll get going now.

521
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:01,620
Chang Dong.

522
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,420
Do you think I'm that simple-minded?

523
00:26:06,460 --> 00:26:09,020
That I think Ye Liuxi
opening the Demon Museum

524
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,620
and causing Camellia's disaster

525
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:13,060
would be enough
to ensure that you do as I say

526
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,900
and kill Ye Liuxi?

527
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:19,460
I haven't gotten

528
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,700
to the most crucial point yet.

529
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,620
The Kui dragon is so powerful.

530
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:32,380
It can even change a person's memories.

531
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,740
I never thought Ye Liuxi
would be the real Qingzhi

532
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,700
and Long Zhi the spy.

533
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,780
So, this is what the saying meant.

534
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,340
"In the duel of the twin Zhi,

535
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,980
"Qing's spirit will soar like a dragon."

536
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:45,020
Before Ye Liuxi lost her memories,

537
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:47,700
she was free, wild,
unbridled, and mysterious.

538
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:51,540
She was a rose blooming in the desert,

539
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,300
open and unreserved.

540
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:56,260
After losing her memories,

541
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,860
Ye Liuxi has grown a lot softer.

542
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:00,900
She has more things

543
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:03,340
she cares about in life now.

544
00:27:06,060 --> 00:27:07,780
Why did Ye Liuxi

545
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,940
want to open the pass back then?

546
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:11,780
Initially, she must have

547
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,580
wanted to let the people from the pass

548
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,420
live like the citizens outside the pass.

549
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:18,420
To let them live happily

550
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,060
without the oppression
from the four major families.

551
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:23,100
But, later on,

552
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,540
she met Chang Dong, Fatty Tang,

553
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:27,220
Gao Shen, and Ding Liu.

554
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,740
Slowly, she began
to understand love and respect.

555
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,940
Her thoughts

556
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:36,860
changed over time.

557
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:44,140
Will she still open up the pass?

558
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:50,620
Where's Mr. Zhan and Ye Liuxi?

559
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,980
We set fires in the city

560
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,820
while Mr. Zhan carried out the plan

561
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,600
to steal the Sheep's Horn Cup
from Zhao Guanshou.

562
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:56,860
What's the matter?

563
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,420
Is Mr. Zhan not back yet?

564
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,060
Let's get going,

565
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:00,980
Miss Qing.

566
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:02,500
Will we not wait for Mr. Zhan?

567
00:28:03,660 --> 00:28:05,580
After the havoc we wreaked
in Black Stone City,

568
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,990
Feathers Guards would probably
send the exotic beasts.

569
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:10,020
If Jiang Zhan got the item,

570
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:11,100
he would come back on his own.

571
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,540
We don't need to wait for him here.

572
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,340
- Let's go. Mr. Zhan's back!
- Quick!

573
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:15,740
Come here!

574
00:28:15,740 --> 00:28:16,140
Mr. Zhan.

575
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:16,700
Mr. Zhan.

576
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:17,460
Mr. Zhan.

577
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,500
How did it go?

578
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,860
I couldn't find the Sheep's Horn Cup.

579
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,460
I almost failed to make it out.

580
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:29,660
You ran into Thiefless?

581
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,540
Yeah.

582
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:32,980
It was Liuxi who saved me.

583
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:34,540
She got injured too.

584
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,660
We need two Sheep's Horn Cups

585
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,220
to open the Demon Museum.

586
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,100
We only have one right now.

587
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,540
Looks like you'll have good news
to share with us soon.

588
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,180
Let's go.

589
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,500
Let's get going.

590
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,780
Are you angry?

591
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:16,740
Don't ever do that

592
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,740
in front of Miss Qing again.

593
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,180
Are you scared she'll find out

594
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:26,940
or scared I find out that you
have feelings for her?

595
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,740
- Don't talk about it.
- I want to.

596
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,420
In the past two years,

597
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,300
Qingzhi hasn't spent much time
with Scorpion Eye.

598
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:37,900
Not many people know her.

599
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:40,560
She's mainly in charge of moving goods
in and out of the pass.

600
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,340
Most of the credit for Scorpion Eye's success
belongs to you.

601
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:46,660
Even if you two go separate ways now,

602
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:47,900
you won't owe her anything.

603
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:55,460
If I ever hear such things again,

604
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:56,980
you can get out of my sight for good.

605
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,900
Don't ever meet me again.

606
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,540
Even if I die,

607
00:30:01,220 --> 00:30:02,660
I won't betray Qingzhi.

608
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,940
Scorpion Eye belongs to Qingzhi.

609
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,980
If Qingzhi and I

610
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:13,740
are at odds someday,
who will you side with?

611
00:30:21,020 --> 00:30:22,540
She saved my life before.

612
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:24,620
I'm standing here today because of her.

613
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:27,300
She's the reason why we can be together.

614
00:30:29,740 --> 00:30:31,220
Even if it was my loved one

615
00:30:32,340 --> 00:30:34,020
who hurt Qingzhi,

616
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,740
I would kill her too.

617
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,620
You'll know one day.

618
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,100
Between two Lingzhi mushrooms,

619
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:47,420
who's the weed,

620
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:48,460
who's the immortal.

621
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:56,000
