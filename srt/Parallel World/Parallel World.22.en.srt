(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,140
Chop.

4
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,780
Swing.

5
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,860
Put some force into it.

6
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,340
Swing.

7
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,100
Hurry up.

8
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,060
Swing, swing, chop.

9
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,140
Swing.

10
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,340
Chop.

11
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:55,420
Have you eaten breakfast?

12
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,020
Not yet.

13
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:56,580
Is there food?

14
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,820
Over there.

15
00:01:57,820 --> 00:01:58,620
Alright.

16
00:01:58,620 --> 00:01:59,420
Chop.

17
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:00,580
Cut.

18
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,660
Swing. Harder.

19
00:02:01,660 --> 00:02:02,420
Fatty Tang.

20
00:02:07,540 --> 00:02:09,780
Miss Ye, Mr. Zhao said

21
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,100
if you guys aren't in a hurry,

22
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:12,580
you can stay a few more days
in Black Stone City.

23
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,060
The districts and markets here

24
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,700
all open at 9.00 a.m.
There is plenty to see around here.

25
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,380
Especially in Black Stone Shopping Street.

26
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,500
You should look around.

27
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,740
The guards are strict

28
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:27,260
here in this city of sorcerers.

29
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:28,420
The three most famous families are

30
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:30,220
the Li, Long, and Qian families.

31
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,860
Don't worry about safety.

32
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,220
Didn't he say we'll be visiting
the Qian family about Silver Snake?

33
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,100
Swing it harder.

34
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:36,500
That's not urgent.

35
00:02:36,820 --> 00:02:38,780
Mr. Zhao said you can go shopping first.

36
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,580
It's okay to be back late.

37
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,460
Alright.

38
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,540
Keep practicing.

39
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,340
Okay.

40
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,500
Is food up ahead?

41
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,620
Fatty Tang, go get breakfast first.

42
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,060
Are we close friends?

43
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:58,060
What are you practicing?

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,060
I don't even know how to wield a sword,

45
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,540
but I can easily defeat you.

46
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,220
Are you looking for a fight?

47
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,420
What are you going to do about that?

48
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,380
Will you hit me?

49
00:03:08,380 --> 00:03:09,060
If you weren't a girl,

50
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
I would have beaten you up, believe me.

51
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,580
Could you have taken me down
if I were a man?

52
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,100
I just didn't want to fight you.

53
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,300
You hit me in the face.

54
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,860
It's still bruised.

55
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,340
If you hadn't been kind

56
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:19,340
and gave me half a bag of rice,

57
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,900
I would have beaten you long ago.

58
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,500
Liu.

59
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,460
Don't you think He is

60
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:37,220
rather shameless?

61
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,340
I don't think so.

62
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,060
Don't you think

63
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:44,220
she's a little into you?

64
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,620
You didn't
give her the rice for nothing.

65
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,580
Based on my experience,

66
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,780
you two might get together.

67
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,580
Bah!

68
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,220
Why would I even date her?

69
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,260
Fatty Tang.

70
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:55,540
One should always

71
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,740
be honest with oneself.

72
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,020
In terms of looks,

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:03:59,660
she more than matches you.

74
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:01,860
Why are you staring at me?

75
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,180
I don't like being stared at.

76
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:07,260
Oh, my head. It's wobbling.

77
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,660
I feel dizzy.

78
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:13,700
Chop.

79
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:19,820
Liu.

80
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:23,060
Up ahead is
Black Stone Commercial Street.

81
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,540
All of that hard traveling

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,300
was for this moment.

83
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,180
Really?

84
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,180
Aren't you here

85
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,500
for Liuxi's Sheep's Horn?

86
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,500
Don't talk about that.

87
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,500
Why are you still following us?

88
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,540
Who are you talking about?

89
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,180
Whoever responds to me.

90
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,060
A photo studio.

91
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:50,780
(Xincheng Studio)
Liuxi, can we take a photo?

92
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,260
Okay.

93
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,460
Let's go.

94
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,940
You better not come in.

95
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:02,140
Why? I need to make sure you're safe.

96
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,660
We're safe when you're here.

97
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,140
Who do you think you are?

98
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:17,120
(Xincheng Studio)

99
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:19,140
(Tea shop)

100
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,860
Stuffed tofu.

101
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,580
Freshly made stuffed tofu.

102
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:26,580
Come look.

103
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,460
Is this Black Stone Commercial Street's

104
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:30,260
most famous stuffed tofu?

105
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:32,260
Yes. They're delicious and fresh.

106
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,140
They smell so good.

107
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,020
Feel free to try some when you can.

108
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:39,060
Stuffed tofu.

109
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,140
Come look.

110
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,260
Watch where you're going.

111
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:51,900
Is this the Golden Web Staff?

112
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,740
It looks cool. Can I play with it?

113
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:54,820
You can't touch this.

114
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,900
This Golden Web Staff is very powerful.

115
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,500
How powerful is it?

116
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,340
Whenever monsters appear nearby,

117
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:01,900
you can...

118
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,420
I'm friendly. Friendly.

119
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:06,940
Kids,

120
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,380
this is the Golden Web Staff.

121
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:09,220
You can't touch it.

122
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:10,740
It's not a toy.

123
00:06:10,740 --> 00:06:11,820
Let me tell you,

124
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,100
the sorcerers
can control the local monsters

125
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:15,700
all thanks to this.

126
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,500
That's the Li family's sorcerer badge.

127
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,660
Well-spotted.

128
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,060
You're right.
It's the Li family's sorcerer badge.

129
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:29,140
These days,

130
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,540
only we true sorcerers

131
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,380
can recognize it at a glance.

132
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:34,540
The Li family's sorcerer badge.

133
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,620
That still exists?

134
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,900
I thought the Li family had died out.

135
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,420
They're just a legend.

136
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:45,780
Are you a descendant of the Li family?

137
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:47,060
Yes, I am.

138
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,660
You have some nerve
to enter Black Stone City.

139
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,060
Kids.

140
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,100
Let me tell you.

141
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:54,260
The disappearance
of the shadow puppet caravan

142
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,140
happened

143
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:57,060
because of the Li family.

144
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,580
Why is his clothing so dirty?

145
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,780
He must be broke.

146
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:03,500
Then again,

147
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,900
if the Li family

148
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:07,420
hadn't trained
their shadow puppets well,

149
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:08,540
this entire region

150
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:10,660
would only
know about the Long family sorcerers

151
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:12,020
instead of the Li family sorcerers.

152
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,420
In that sense,

153
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,340
we should thank you, right?

154
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,620
Come.

155
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,460
Delicious.

156
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,620
That's why, kids,

157
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,140
the Long family is still better.

158
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:30,940
Everyone, come.

159
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,580
Look here.

160
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,940
Three, two, one, smile!

161
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:37,460
Good.

162
00:07:38,780 --> 00:07:39,660
Liuxi.

163
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:40,940
After we leave the city,

164
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,820
I'll have the people picking us up

165
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:43,060
bring a better camera for us.

166
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,460
And we'll take another photo
in the desert?

167
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,940
Sure.

168
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:46,500
Why didn't you shave today?

169
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,660
I'll go back then.

170
00:07:47,660 --> 00:07:49,420
I've been missing for ages.

171
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,300
Does my godfather think I'm dead?

172
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:52,700
Be more optimistic.

173
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:53,540
Find something nice to bring back.

174
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:54,620
That's better than anything else.

175
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,260
Everyone, let's take another one.

176
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:57,940
Get ready.

177
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,340
Look here.

178
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,340
Both of us are in blue.

179
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,100
One, two, three, okay.

180
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,340
Thinking about all that right now
won't help.

181
00:08:09,820 --> 00:08:10,940
There are more shops there.

182
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,620
Let's check them out later.

183
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,380
What's the problem?

184
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,140
Okay, one last photo.

185
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,820
Come on, look here, get ready.

186
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,660
One, two, three, smile.

187
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,260
Okay.

188
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,660
I'm going to look at some pots.

189
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:21,460
Bye.

190
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:24,180
I want to look at that accessory shop.

191
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:26,180
Liu, slow down.

192
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,060
How long will the photos take?

193
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,860
It won't take long.
You'll be able to pick them up soon.

194
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:33,580
Okay.

195
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,740
Let's go on a walk first.

196
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:35,500
Let's go.

197
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,300
Boss.

198
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,060
Hello.

199
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:45,700
There are many accessories here.

200
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,020
This is quite unique.

201
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,060
Are there more over there?

202
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:54,100
These are all the latest styles.

203
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,660
Feel free to try on anything you like.

204
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:57,060
I'll take a look.

205
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,500
Can I try this?

206
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,860
Yes, there's a mirror here.

207
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,700
Okay.

208
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:33,160
(Instant Camera. Instant Photos.)

209
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,180
(Xincheng Studio)

210
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,820
Speaking of this Zhao Guanshou,

211
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:51,220
he bombards us
with information on the first day.

212
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:53,740
Then, he tells us to go shopping.

213
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:56,020
Is he trying to make us lower our guard?

214
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:57,500
What is he up to, anyway?

215
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,060
Can we not talk about that now?

216
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,260
I don't want to think about it.

217
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,420
You have to.

218
00:10:02,180 --> 00:10:03,740
This is all related to you.

219
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:05,020
Not only must you think about it,

220
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:06,460
but you also must think carefully.

221
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,940
Don't overlook any details.

222
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:10,940
Why are these people so annoying?

223
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,700
I say, we should just fight it out.

224
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:15,860
Settle everything at once.

225
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,180
Fight it out.

226
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,060
First, disrupt the enemy's plans.

227
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:19,700
Then, their reputation.

228
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,300
I disagree.

229
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,020
Later on...

230
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,300
Even if Zhao Guanshou

231
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,180
prepared a whole city's worth
of schemes for me,

232
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,260
I'll kick them all in the head.

233
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,580
What can he do to me?

234
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,820
In the end, it's survival of the fittest.

235
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,140
The strongest makes the rules.

236
00:10:29,140 --> 00:10:32,300
Yes, it's fine because you're strong.

237
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,820
You stand a chance at overthrowing them.

238
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:37,540
Still, if you are the ruler,
you have to govern it as well.

239
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,780
In your current state,

240
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:39,900
if you're the ruler,

241
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:42,380
you'll be exhausted
from fighting in a few years.

242
00:10:42,380 --> 00:10:43,780
What do you think I need you for?

243
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:45,580
If I'm the ruler,

244
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,340
you can just help me govern everything.

245
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:49,860
Not interested.

246
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,060
Remember what you said.

247
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,540
This is your loss,

248
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:54,820
so don't regret it later.

249
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,620
Tell me then,
what exactly am I going to lose?

250
00:10:57,620 --> 00:10:59,260
Imagine when I rule.

251
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,220
When I become a king,

252
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,100
you can write a memoir
about being the man of a king

253
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,460
when you get old.

254
00:11:04,460 --> 00:11:05,540
How cool is that?

255
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,540
Otherwise, you'll only be able

256
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:10,260
to write a book
about the life of an ordinary man.

257
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:12,140
It won't sell well.
Who's going to read it?

258
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:15,260
It's nice to be an ordinary person,
actually.

259
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,660
That's true.

260
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:17,540
But didn't you
find an extraordinary woman

261
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,140
for yourself?

262
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,900
Your life is
destined to be extraordinary.

263
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,060
Fine.

264
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,860
Who did Liu say she was
looking for yesterday

265
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,060
to outclass an extraordinary person
like me?

266
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:34,860
She said...

267
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,660
She said she was looking
for someone stronger than you.

268
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,180
I asked, "What about Gao Shen?"

269
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:43,220
She pretended to be sick,
saying she had a headache.

270
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,020
Then, she went back into her room.

271
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,380
I mean, these two silly youngsters,

272
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,100
it's obvious that they love each other.

273
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:51,580
I just don't get it.

274
00:11:52,540 --> 00:11:53,620
I never knew

275
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,220
you enjoyed playing matchmaker.

276
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,260
When a person gets rich,

277
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,100
they often want
to share their wealth with friends.

278
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,700
I'm blissfully in love.

279
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,060
Can't I share my happiness

280
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,020
with my friends?

281
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,700
Share your happiness, huh?

282
00:12:07,260 --> 00:12:09,060
A man like Gao Shen
is hard to come by, actually.

283
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,340
Well, it's true

284
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,580
that he's stubborn,

285
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,620
but he's simple and honest.

286
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:16,060
He falls in love with the role of a wife

287
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,300
before he falls in love
with a particular woman.

288
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,340
I don't get what you mean.

289
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,260
In Gao Shen's mind's eye,

290
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,340
the role of a wife

291
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:26,100
represents many beautiful things,

292
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,540
like mutual support

293
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,820
and sharing joys and sorrows.

294
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,780
So, no matter who becomes his wife,

295
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:33,660
he will always treat her well.

296
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:37,460
That's why Liu Qi entrusted Liu to him.

297
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,220
As for Gao Shen,

298
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:42,140
his heart is already chained to her.

299
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:46,020
Liu...

300
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,740
Mm-hmm.

301
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,540
Liu is young

302
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:50,580
and still at an age
where she fantasizes about love.

303
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:54,020
Her ideal lover is the kind of hero

304
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,580
who shows up like an angel

305
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,940
and rescues her from danger.

306
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,940
An arranged marriage
is unacceptable for her.

307
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,420
In any case, everyone's fate

308
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:04,620
is different.

309
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:06,900
Liu's emotional baggage

310
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,260
can't be resolved
with just a few words from you and me.

311
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,580
Why can't it be resolved?

312
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,580
Even if it can't be resolved,

313
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,420
we can always lend a helping hand.

314
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:15,700
How do we lend a helping hand?

315
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:16,660
Through you.

316
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:17,540
Me?

317
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,500
Look at Gao Shen. For such a tall guy,

318
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,580
he looks small in front of Liu.

319
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:23,500
He follows her around

320
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,700
and is often ridiculed by her.

321
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:29,020
Say, why is the course of love so bumpy

322
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:33,340
for kind-hearted people like us?

323
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,140
What is it?

324
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:37,100
How much did I suffer

325
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,580
while courting you back then?

326
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
We're talking about them.
Let's not talk about ourselves, okay?

327
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,100
Are you going to do it or not?

328
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,180
Alright, I'll see what I can do.

329
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,940
I'll do something about it.

330
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,500
I'm a nice person, ain't I?

331
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,300
A nice person.

332
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:57,100
This is the Sparrow Cane Head.

333
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,300
And this is

334
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,500
the gilded silver jar.

335
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,140
And look at these pieces of jade.

336
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,580
They're of exquisite craftsmanship.

337
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,740
They aren't different
from what you see in a museum.

338
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,860
These must be worth a lot.

339
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,020
This trip is really worth it.

340
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:11,340
We're going to be rich.

341
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:12,180
If we find the right way this time,

342
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,900
we'll be able to trade
with the inside of the pass,

343
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:14,700
That's right.

344
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,220
The shop owner told me

345
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:18,420
that he has some other old stuff.

346
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:19,700
I can check them out tomorrow.

347
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:21,220
What's more, they're Jun wares.

348
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:22,540
From what the shop owner told me,

349
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,500
Jun wares seem to be less valuable

350
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,140
inside the pass than outside the pass.

351
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,380
They care nothing about them.

352
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:29,300
We can work with them
on a long-term basis in the future.

353
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,220
Sounds great.

354
00:14:30,220 --> 00:14:31,660
I'll go take a look with you.

355
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:32,260
Okay.

356
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,900
Liu, you're scheduled to be examined
by the doctor tomorrow morning.

357
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:38,540
Oh, I forgot about that.

358
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:41,300
It's okay. Once you get well,
I'll lead you to prosperity.

359
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,860
Just thinking about it makes me happy.

360
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:45,900
Life is filled with hope.

361
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,620
Don't slack off, you two.

362
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:48,380
After all, there are
all sorts of troublemakers

363
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,100
inside the pass,
like Scorpion Eye and others.

364
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:50,780
That's right.

365
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:52,740
We have Liuxi looking out for us.

366
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:54,100
What do we have to fear?

367
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:54,660
Exactly.

368
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,500
But you can't rely on me alone.

369
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,420
And you, have you been practicing
with the knife?

370
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,300
I'll practice with it in a bit.

371
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:03,820
Come in.

372
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:06,620
Miss Ye.

373
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:08,140
We should go to the Qian family.

374
00:15:09,820 --> 00:15:10,580
Let's go.

375
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,540
Let's go.

376
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,540
Give it to me.

377
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,500
Liuxi.

378
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:20,540
That was a close call.

379
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,300
If this dropped,

380
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,580
the loss would be substantial.

381
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:33,440
(The Qian family)

382
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:29,660
Please come in.

383
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:51,460
Old Mrs. Qian.

384
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,380
Please call upon Silver Snake.

385
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:54,940
Ye Liuxi is back.

386
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,100
Is this bad news or good news?

387
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:09,500
When Silver Snake shows up,

388
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,660
God's message unfurls.

389
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,620
Miss Ye.

390
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:40,540
When it bites you,

391
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:44,740
it'll feel like a light mosquito bite.

392
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,780
It's okay. It doesn't hurt.

393
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:59,460
Hold on, there's no rush.

394
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:03,500
The first message

395
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:06,100
is the prophecy.

396
00:18:07,300 --> 00:18:10,500
The second message
is the interpretation of it.

397
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,540
The third message

398
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,100
is the remedy.

399
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:21,900
God won't close off your path.

400
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:26,300
If there's any unfavorable outcome,

401
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:31,260
there will always be a remedy.

402
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:34,020
Miss Ye.

403
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:35,540
Please.

404
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:02,820
Miss Ye.

405
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:04,940
Please keep in mind

406
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,260
that your prophecy is

407
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,380
"Old friends shall meet again
as enemies."

408
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:17,020
Does that refer to my blowing my cover

409
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:19,140
and falling out with Jiang Zhan?

410
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:29,620
The interpretation

411
00:19:30,580 --> 00:19:35,700
is about a reunion on Golden Hill.

412
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:37,740
Golden Hill?

413
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:41,740
Golden Hill
refers to Gold Mine Mountain.

414
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,820
As for the remedy,

415
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:56,260
"Dragon soars,
cleansing with vermilion branches".

416
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:01,020
What does that mean?

417
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:07,580
Silver Snake's prophecy
only reveals this much.

418
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,820
As for the rest of it,

419
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:15,780
you have to go back
and comprehend it yourself, Miss Ye.

420
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,340
Is that all?

421
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,420
Old Mrs. Qian.

422
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:31,740
Thank you.

423
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,300
Miss Ye.

424
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,100
You all may leave now.

425
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:37,300
Let's talk about this another day.

426
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:40,020
Let's go.

427
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,620
You don't have to follow us.

428
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,780
Talk about this another day?

429
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,780
I wonder what they're up to.

430
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,060
What does "dragon soars" mean?

431
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:39,900
I'm not sure.

432
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,700
But I noticed

433
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,220
that Zhao Guanshou's expression changed

434
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:47,580
when he heard that.

435
00:21:55,140 --> 00:21:57,740
Ever since Ye Liuxi's accident
two years ago,

436
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,300
trade across the pass
has practically ceased.

437
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,660
In fact,

438
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:04,380
hemotoxin isn't available anymore.

439
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:07,460
Only the Long family's warehouse
still has some of it.

440
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:11,340
In the past, whenever there was trouble
in Black Stone City,

441
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:14,900
the Zhao family, the Long family,
and the Qian family

442
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:16,140
would settle it through discussions.

443
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,180
But it's different now.

444
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,580
The Long family
is the dominant ruler.

445
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:21,940
Every month, the Long family
delivers medicine to me on time.

446
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:24,780
My life now

447
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,660
depends entirely on the Long family.

448
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:27,780
Do you think

449
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,820
I can defy the Long family?

450
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,100
It's a pity
that your excellent martial arts skills

451
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,220
are ruined by your illness.

452
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,700
Old Mrs. Qian.

453
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,380
You don't understand.

454
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,780
If it weren't for Ye Liuxi,

455
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:51,300
I would have

456
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,460
died long ago.

457
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,700
What do you mean?

458
00:22:58,860 --> 00:22:59,820
There was one time

459
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,700
when there was
a severe shortage of supplies.

460
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:04,620
Ye Liuxi had

461
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:07,540
personally delivered the medicine
to my home.

462
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,780
How did you know?

463
00:24:06,260 --> 00:24:08,300
Do you think the hemotoxin you bought
in the black market

464
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:09,540
was just a coincidence?

465
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,740
Your illness can't wait.

466
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:15,900
I shipped this in
from outside the pass today.

467
00:24:16,780 --> 00:24:17,820
Just accept it.

468
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,460
Why did you help me obtain the medicine?

469
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,540
There are no permanent friends

470
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,820
nor permanent enemies.

471
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
You can consider this

472
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,260
as an incomplete transaction.

473
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,380
Perhaps someday in the future

474
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,140
you'll need to use it for yourself

475
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:42,140
or even for Black Stone City

476
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,900
as a safeguard.

477
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,100
I think

478
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,500
Ye Liuxi wanted

479
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,940
to recruit you
to deal with the Long family, right?

480
00:24:58,940 --> 00:24:59,940
Maybe.

481
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,020
There was a day when I suddenly felt

482
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,420
that all conflicts in this world

483
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,780
could be resolved.

484
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,620
Old Mrs. Qian.

485
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,260
Do you think

486
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,100
if one person

487
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:17,420
can change the fate of an entire city?

488
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:19,860
Should we

489
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,180
ask Silver Snake first?

490
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,620
Slash.

491
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,460
Block.

492
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,820
Upswing.

493
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,660
Sweep.

494
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,220
Where's He?

495
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:00,140
I don't know who that is.

496
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:02,900
You don't know?

497
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:11,260
Isn't this just wasting my feelings?

498
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:27,780
Actually,

499
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:30,380
it didn't really hurt the brain at all.

500
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,020
It's just that this wound

501
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,580
hasn't completely healed yet.

502
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,300
Doctor, don't you need to check again?

503
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,100
You can be rest assured.

504
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,380
The sorcerers' treatment method

505
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:45,940
is different from other places.

506
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,140
Liu.

507
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:48,700
How are you feeling now?

508
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,060
It used to hurt a bit,

509
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:53,860
but it doesn't seem to hurt now.

510
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,380
What is this drop?

511
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,380
It's amazing.

512
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,220
By the way,

513
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,660
can my hair still grow here, doctor?

514
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:04,100
As long as you apply this medicine,

515
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:06,100
your hair will grow back quickly.

516
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,860
Really?

517
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,060
I'm relieved.

518
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,020
Remember.

519
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:11,300
Apply it once a day.

520
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,500
It might itch a bit in the start,

521
00:27:13,500 --> 00:27:15,060
but that's normal.

522
00:27:15,460 --> 00:27:16,620
Thank you, doctor.

523
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,700
I'll see you out, doctor.

524
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:21,260
Thank you, doctor.

525
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,100
Remember

526
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,500
to rub it in well.

527
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,780
Okay.

528
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,940
Thank you, doctor.

529
00:27:40,780 --> 00:27:41,780
Liu.

530
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
Take this.

531
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,860
If it still bothers you,

532
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,940
you can use a hairpin
to cover it for now.

533
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,780
And take it off
when your hair grows back.

534
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,700
Ding Liu.

535
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,460
I have something to tell you.

536
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:44,780
I ask everyone here

537
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:46,460
to bear witness to this.

538
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,060
Eat your food.

539
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,900
Qi once told me

540
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,820
that he wanted you to marry me

541
00:29:01,300 --> 00:29:02,620
when you're older.

542
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,260
I thought it was a good idea then,

543
00:29:06,660 --> 00:29:07,780
but now,

544
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:09,740
I've changed my mind.

545
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,140
These things

546
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,780
should be mutual.

547
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,220
Being forced together
won't end well for anyone.

548
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:19,780
After we return,

549
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:21,620
I'll make it clear to Qi

550
00:29:22,020 --> 00:29:23,460
that we're not compatible.

551
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,140
If we force it, it won't do good to us.

552
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:29,780
So, please don't worry about this.

553
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:33,900
That's all.

554
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:36,340
Let's continue eating.

555
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,260
Where are you going?

556
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:48,820
To check on the bowl.

557
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:49,580
Just to check on the bowl.

558
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,940
You're quite bold.

559
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,380
You still dare to go out alone?

560
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,220
Don't worry.

561
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,180
Feather Guards will send someone
to follow him.

562
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:12,660
(Three Meals)

563
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:17,660
(People's Restaurant)

564
00:30:30,300 --> 00:30:31,340
You're following me?

565
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,020
Do you think I wanted to come?

566
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:36,140
Mr. Zhao instructed me to do so.

567
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,300
Wherever you guys go,

568
00:30:37,300 --> 00:30:38,660
it's our job to ensure your safety.

569
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,260
You're protecting me?

570
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,420
You're like a small white dove.

571
00:30:42,820 --> 00:30:44,540
Only those in that uniform
can protect us.

572
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,780
Those with an eagle.

573
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,900
Eagle on the uniform.

574
00:30:48,260 --> 00:30:50,580
Falcon Guards
only protect important people.

575
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:54,260
My presence itself is a flatter to you.

576
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:15,300
Why did Zhao Guanshou fall down?

577
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:16,860
Mr. Zhao?

578
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,020
How is that possible?

579
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,620
There's no...

580
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:23,100
Fatty Tang.

581
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,860
Fatty Tang!

582
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,620
(Porcelain shop)

583
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:41,500
Boss.

584
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:43,220
My Golden Pheasant Bowl.

585
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,420
Sure. Come with me.

586
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:51,940
Where is it?

587
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,340
Please wait. I'll fetch it for you.

588
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,140
Alright.

589
00:32:05,020 --> 00:32:07,420
You're really something to find me here.

590
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:09,380
Where else would you go beside here?

591
00:32:09,380 --> 00:32:10,780
Trying to trick me?

592
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:13,780
I've checked it multiple times.

593
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,260
There's not a single scratch.

594
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,420
Take your time to have a good look.

595
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:18,060
Okay.

596
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:19,780
I'll go out
and keep watch for you.

597
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:20,460
Sure.

598
00:32:24,460 --> 00:32:25,740
What's this treasure?

599
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,220
Why did he close the door?

600
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,140
Don't mind that.

601
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,460
Look.

602
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,100
Move aside. Don't block the light.

603
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,380
There are so many complex forces
inside the pass.

604
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,260
There are sorcerers,

605
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,660
the Qian family, and also Scorpion Eye.

606
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:10,140
Old Shen, I'm getting confused.

607
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,900
Xiaoyu, you don't have to be confused.

608
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:20,140
You only need to understand one thing.

609
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,300
The world inside the pass

610
00:33:22,300 --> 00:33:24,380
is set up by two set of orders.

611
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,780
One set

612
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,660
is about fairness, justice,

613
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,580
morality, and emotions.

614
00:33:30,820 --> 00:33:32,260
The second set

615
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,780
is about gains and losses.

616
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:36,860
The Qian family

617
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:39,780
is just a fence-sitter

618
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,780
between these two order.

619
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,700
They're a messenger.

620
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:48,180
In short, a puppet.

621
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,380
I understand now.

622
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,820
Then, what is "Head west to exit Yumen"?

623
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:58,460
The prophecy of the Silver Snake

624
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:03,180
has countless interpretations
within the pass.

625
00:34:05,100 --> 00:34:09,180
So, to know exactly
what "Head west to exit Yumen" mean,

626
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:14,740
I'm afraid that's a question
for Long Zhi to answer.

627
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,680
