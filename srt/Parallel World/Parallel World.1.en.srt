(Outside of Qingrang Town)

5
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,960
(Ye Liuxi)

6
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,240
Don't move. I'm asking you a question.

7
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:16,640
Where is this?

8
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,160
Did you tie me up here?

9
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,600
So what if I did?

10
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:23,960
Who am I?

11
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:26,320
How should I know who you are?

12
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,400
(Here's a news bulletin.)

13
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,080
(Two days ago,
a cultural relics caretaker)

14
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,720
(went missing
on the way home from work.)

15
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,120
(After a police investigation,)

16
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,160
(a fugitive known as White Ram,)

17
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:58,400
(a suspect in cultural relics crimes,)

18
00:04:58,400 --> 00:04:59,920
(is now a major suspect.)

19
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,920
(We just received a report.)

20
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,640
(The suspect has been apprehended.)

21
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,960
(The police have dispatched officers
to the scene to capture the suspect.)

22
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,680
Help me!

23
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:08,440
I'm begging you.

24
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,040
What's going on?

25
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,560
I almost got killed.
Please call the police.

26
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,120
Is it her?

27
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:12,240
It's not her.

28
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,520
Here.

29
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:16,960
He's here.

30
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:17,560
Inside here.

31
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,960
Did you get your phone?

32
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
That girl called the police just now.

33
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:25,800
It's him.

34
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,280
You're fine now.

35
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
(Ye Liuxi)

36
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,360
Liuxi left from the west of Yumen Pass

37
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,560
and returned from the desert.

38
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,040
(He Xiaoyu)
Isn't this story interesting?

39
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,400
(Shen Mukun)
Pour me some wine.

40
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
Then we'll continue.

41
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:00,200
(Roaming the world with a sword.)

42
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,000
(Upholding justice in the martial world.)

43
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
(Today, the martial world is still here,)

44
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,440
(but the writers of the past are gone.)

45
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,120
(I've traveled all over in my life,)

46
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,120
(witnessing various strange events.)

47
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,880
(It's hard to distinguish
between what's actually real and fake.)

48
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:28,280
(Aren't you lacking inspiration
for your painting?)

49
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:29,840
(While I talk,)

50
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,720
(you can search for inspiration.)

51
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:39,020
(One year later, Li City)

52
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:46,200
Miss, do you want
to watch a shadow puppetry?

53
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,960
Come and watch. Don't miss it.

54
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,000
Northwest folk art. Shadow puppetry.

55
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,000
Mister, do you want
to watch a shadow puppetry?

56
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,520
Come and watch. Don't miss it.

57
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,120
Northwest...

58
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,560
Miss.

59
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,760
(Shadow Puppet Theater)
You're here again.

60
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,680
We have a new play today.

61
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,760
I'll charge you only 50%.

62
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,320
Honored guest, please take a seat.

63
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,000
I'll be right there.

64
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,120
(Tavern)
Beef and good wine have arrived.

65
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,360
Great.

66
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,600
Fill up the wine.

67
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,120
Here.

68
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,960
Another one.

69
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:35,540
(Shadow Puppet Theater)

70
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:43,560
Who is it?

71
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:52,480
I see you've come

72
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:54,200
several times.

73
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,200
Can you understand this?

74
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,760
It's all old singing styles.

75
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,480
Many young people don't like it.

76
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,520
Do you like it?

77
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,120
Are you

78
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,440
here for tourism?

79
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,520
With so many shadow puppeteers here,

80
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,880
there's only one person
handling the strings.

81
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:21,080
Impressive.

82
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,840
Miss, how should I address you?

83
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,920
My last name is Ye.

84
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,080
Ye Liuxi.

85
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,080
Ye Liuxi.

86
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:34,880
Nice name.

87
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,120
Why not take two with you?

88
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,240
I want to find someone.

89
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,120
I heard you have a nephew.

90
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,280
Named Chang Dong.

91
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:58,560
I heard he's quite skilled.

92
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,760
He once crossed the Dalpur alone on a bike.

93
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,800
People call him Sand Fang.

94
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,240
Once ordinary people get there,

95
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,000
they can only resign themselves to fate.

96
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,960
But he's a fang
that can pierce through the desert.

97
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,640
You

98
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,240
want to find Chang Dong as a guide?

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
Yes.

100
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,600
Maybe you don't know,

101
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,640
but two years ago,

102
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,920
something happened to Chang Dong.

103
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,960
It made headlines.

104
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,320
People cursed him so badly.

105
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:41,600
Are you talking about this?

106
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,900
(The Black Camellia Incident Truth)
The Black Camellia?

107
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,120
You...

108
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,960
You know about it
but still want to find Chang Dong?

109
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,880
I chose him because of his abilities.

110
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,480
He made one mistake.

111
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,560
That doesn't mean he lost his abilities.

112
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,360
(Guide Chang Dong's Stubborn Actions
Spark Disaster)

113
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,480
Follow me.

114
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,120
Two years ago,

115
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Chang Dong caused the death of 18 people.

116
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:25,160
The whole world was cursing him.

117
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,680
Not only him,

118
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,920
they also cursed Kong Yang as a slut.

119
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,320
He was with me

120
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
for about three months.

121
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:37,439
He couldn't stand it anymore,

122
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,279
and took his life.

123
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,159
Don't you pay tribute to your nephew?

124
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,359
People trusted him,

125
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,519
and asked him to be a guide.

126
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:48,399
But he relied on his experience
and acted stubbornly,

127
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,119
causing such a disaster.

128
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:51,839
I saw it in the news.

129
00:10:52,639 --> 00:10:54,159
Among the people who died at that time,

130
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,719
some had just become fathers.

131
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,039
In my eyes,

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:00,279
it wouldn't be enough
even if he died a few more times.

133
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:01,919
You can't say that.

134
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:04,159
In a place like the desert,

135
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:05,999
no one can be certain.

136
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,280
Miss.

137
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:13,080
Here's some advice for you.

138
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,400
The desert is too dangerous.

139
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,000
Only it bites people.

140
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,960
There's no reason for anyone to bite it.

141
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,360
Look at Chang Dong.

142
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,600
He even gave himself a nickname
"Sand Fang."

143
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:25,720
I can't help but laugh
whenever I hear it.

144
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,120
Miss.

145
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,480
Hello?

146
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,200
(Couldn't you catch me up?)

147
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,640
(Have you gotten used
to acting as an old man?)

148
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,720
Where did you get this photo?

149
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:05,680
Do you think I'd tell you
over the phone?

150
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,480
Weren't you looking for a guide?

151
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,440
I'll do it.

152
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,000
(Chang Dong.)

153
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,080
(You had wasted two years already.)

154
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,680
(Who knows if you are still good at it?)

155
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:15,840
(Here's the thing.)

156
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,000
(I'll give you three days.)

157
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,400
(If you can find me within that time,)

158
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,840
(it'll prove you are still clear
in the head.)

159
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,680
(Then, we can work together.)

160
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,480
If you can't find me,

161
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,000
you can keep on
playing with your shadow puppets.

162
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,120
(Chang Dong.)

163
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,440
(I want to go home.)

164
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,560
(You are the only one left.)

165
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,360
(No one will find us.)

166
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,160
(Black Camellia, Memorial Monument)
(I want to go home.)

167
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:12,560
Tell us.

168
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,440
Why did you come back alone?

169
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,040
(I'm sorry.)

170
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:17,000
(What's going on?)

171
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:17,720
(I'm sorry.)

172
00:14:17,720 --> 00:14:18,360
(Chang Dong.)

173
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,580
Why do you keep apologizing?

174
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:20,600
Give me back my son.

175
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:22,160
(Have you gotten used
to acting as an old man?)

176
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,080
(You had wasted two years already.)

177
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,800
(Who knows if you are still good at it?)

178
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
(Give me back my son.)

179
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:42,240
(You are the only one left
in Camellia Nineteen.)

180
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,640
(Kong Yang. Kong Yang.)

181
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:57,100
(Chang Dong)

182
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:07,320
Fifteen.

183
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:07,880
Sixteen.

184
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:08,400
Seventeen.

185
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,320
Eighteen.

00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,920
(Han and Tang Charm)
Last night,

187
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,160
I dreamed of great wealth.

188
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:25,740
(Payment Notice)
(Great wealth?)

189
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,440
(Your supermarket is almost bankrupt.)

190
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:32,040
(Rental Payment Notice)
(A woman sold a Sheep's Horn Cup today.)

191
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:35,160
(The experienced worker in my shop
examined it and said it's real.)

192
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,040
- (He hasn't been fooled in decades.)
- Shut up.

193
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:39,840
(Fatty Tang)
The Sheep's Horn Cup is the pride of my museum.

194
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:42,200
If it goes missing,
it will be a big news.

195
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:45,640
Fatty Tang.

196
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Dong.

197
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,800
It's been two years since we last met.

198
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,200
I had a dream last night.

199
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,020
I dreamt of meeting a noble person
coming from east, Dong.

200
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,760
Come on. Sit.

201
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:58,400
It's fine.

202
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:01,280
I've come to ask for your help.

203
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,360
What is it?

204
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,040
I remember back in the day,

205
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,560
you said you have a friend who is rich.

206
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:09,280
He opened several shops in Renhe Alley.

207
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,240
Who?

208
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:15,520
Bangs.

209
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:16,840
Who is calling for me?

210
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,360
(Password Login)

211
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,280
A few days ago,

212
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,600
I upgraded the surveillance
at my shops.

213
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,520
Alright, you can go off duty now.

214
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,600
Take your time and look at it.

215
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,000
There's only one camera at the entrance.

216
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,160
Your friend is impolite.

217
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,920
I'm helping him,

218
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:47,880
yet he won't even smile at me.

219
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,040
He was responsible
for more than a dozen lives.

220
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:51,560
I doubt you could smile if it were you.

221
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,320
Do you know about the Black Camellia?

222
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,560
That's him.

223
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:00,840
After bringing people in,
he went against them.

224
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:04,320
He chose the wrong camp.
They all got buried in the sandstorm.

225
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,920
Even his girlfriend had died in there.

226
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:07,120
That's him?

227
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:07,720
Yeah.

228
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:11,680
The families of the deceased
blocked his door and beat him severely.

229
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,880
It's all over the internet.

230
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,120
Go search for it.

231
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,600
I found it.

232
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,360
What's the matter?

233
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
(Give me back my son.)

234
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:39,840
(Why you come back alone?)

235
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:40,760
(How dare you come back?)

236
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,320
She has a car.

237
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:54,760
If we can find information
about the car owner,

238
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,440
it would be easy for us.

239
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,920
Is that woman named Ye Liuxi?

240
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,920
Leave it to me.

241
00:17:59,000 --> 00:17:59,600
I'll be right back.

242
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
I'll leave you guys to it.

243
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,000
Be quick.

244
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:04,640
I'll go and get some skewers
for you, Dong.

245
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,160
Just find something to placate him.

246
00:18:08,440 --> 00:18:09,400
Hurry up.

247
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:12,640
Here you go, Dong. It's still hot.

248
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,000
It's done.

249
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,680
I found her car plate
on the rental platform.

250
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,840
It has her phone number on it.

251
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,240
But the car owner's last name isn't Ye.

252
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:24,640
He lives in Qingrang Town,
near the border of Longgu.

253
00:18:27,560 --> 00:18:28,640
Qingyang Town.

254
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:31,200
(The next day)
Hello?

255
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,280
Is this Mr. Huang Defu?

256
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,520
(I am.)

257
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,000
Do you own a car
with the license plate XiMK0808?

258
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,520
(Yes. Is something the matter?)

259
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,600
Here's what happened.

260
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,800
There was a lady

261
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,120
who drove this car to our shop.

262
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,080
She left something behind.

263
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,920
I want to send it back to her,

264
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,040
but I don't know her address.

265
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,880
I haven't been driving that car
for a while.

266
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,200
I rented it to someone else.

267
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,080
It's a girl with the last name Ye.

268
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,160
If you want to look for her,

269
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,160
she's been selling melons
in Qingrang Town recently.

270
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,680
Selling melons in Qingrang Town?

271
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,420
Yes, it's right there at Qingrang Town.

272
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,720
(Qingyang Town, Longgu)
There's a restaurant across the street.

273
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,480
Hello, may I take your order?

274
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,280
I'll have a fast food meal.

275
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,160
- Would you like something to drink?
- No, thanks.

276
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:56,960
Alright.

277
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,320
(Welcome)
Do you need anything else?

278
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,560
No, thank you.

279
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,680
Please bring me a pot of water.

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,760
How much is the steamed bun?

281
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,600
Thank you.

282
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,000
Waitress.

283
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,560
The one selling melons.

284
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,720
Is she there every day?

285
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,580
You've been staring at her
ever since you came in here.

286
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,720
Is she really that good-looking?

287
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,660
She is just someone
who does that kind of job.

288
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,030
(Qingyang Hotel)

289
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:46,040
(Special service for you)

290
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:52,679
(Is she really that good-looking?)

291
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:54,799
(She is just someone
who does that kind of job.)

292
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,039
Hey. I'm Sunny.

293
00:21:12,289 --> 00:21:13,779
I just finished eating.

294
00:21:14,889 --> 00:21:15,609
I know.

295
00:21:16,019 --> 00:21:17,179
The second floor, right?

296
00:21:18,609 --> 00:21:19,369
Okay.

297
00:21:20,569 --> 00:21:21,529
Got it.

298
00:22:13,609 --> 00:22:14,419
Come in.

299
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,770
Should I go take a shower first?

300
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:29,120
No need. How much for just chatting?

301
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,840
The same, 300.

302
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:33,530
Because I came here today,

303
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,160
I can't take other jobs.

304
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:47,840
Go ahead.

305
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,300
What do you want to chat about?

306
00:22:50,010 --> 00:22:51,680
How long have you been in this place?

307
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,840
A little over a year.

308
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:57,120
Your colleagues...

309
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,680
Are you familiar
with the other girls in town?

310
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,120
You're a regular here, aren't you?

311
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,920
Tell me, who are you looking for?

312
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,120
I know everyone in this town
who's in our line of work.

313
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,200
Do you know someone named Ye Liuxi?

314
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,490
Ye Liuxi?

315
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,330
I haven't heard of her.

316
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,290
It sounds like a real name.

317
00:23:15,290 --> 00:23:17,120
Who in our line of work
uses real name?

318
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,200
If news gets back to their hometown,
they'll be so embarrassed.

319
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:21,970
She sells melons
at the street corner during the day.

320
00:23:22,490 --> 00:23:23,490
Oh, her.

321
00:23:23,490 --> 00:23:24,440
I know her.

322
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,400
But I've never spoken to her.

323
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,530
Who is she to you?

324
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,490
Childhood friend?

325
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:34,880
Ex-girlfriend?

326
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,940
- Runaway wife?
- It's none of your business.

327
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,440
Whether she's in our line of work,

328
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,530
that I don't know.

329
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,360
But I doubt it.

330
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:48,160
At most, she's a part-timer.

331
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,440
How so?

332
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,770
Because she also works as our driver.

333
00:23:53,970 --> 00:23:55,490
It's tough in our line of work.

334
00:23:55,490 --> 00:23:56,330
Don't you know?

335
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:59,490
We have to
walk the dangerous streets at night.

336
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:01,120
Just the other day,

337
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:04,050
a few of my friends
were stalked by a pervert.

338
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:07,640
They said the pervert
was wearing a skin mask.

339
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:10,250
A skin mask?

340
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:12,920
Oh, you know.

341
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,330
A soft skin mask putting on the face.

342
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:16,770
Revealing only eyes and nose.

343
00:24:16,770 --> 00:24:18,810
It's terrifying, especially at night.

344
00:24:19,920 --> 00:24:22,600
Afterward,
they hired that melon-seller girl

345
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,010
to drive them.

346
00:24:24,010 --> 00:24:25,330
Ten yuan for a one-way trip.

347
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:27,250
It was too expensive, so I didn't join.

348
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,680
But today,
when I came over, I was followed.

349
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,810
I'll hire her next time.

350
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,160
Here for a melon?

351
00:24:50,010 --> 00:24:51,010
Dropped the old man act?

352
00:24:51,570 --> 00:24:52,920
You're quite handsome.

353
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,730
You're getting straight to the point

354
00:24:58,730 --> 00:25:00,120
without exchanging pleasantries.

355
00:25:00,490 --> 00:25:02,290
I was even going to cut up a melon
for you to eat.

356
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,680
How do you know this photo isn't fake?

357
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:08,680
This outfit,

358
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:09,840
she never wore it before,

359
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:11,360
and only I have seen it.

360
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:12,440
Second question.

361
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:14,360
- Where is this Yardang located?
- Seadragon Heap.

362
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,570
How can you tell?

363
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,840
This place has a lot of salt and alkali,

364
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,330
along with gypsum mud.

365
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:24,400
Compared to other Yardangs,
it looks grayish-white.

366
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,840
On a sunny day,

367
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:27,570
it shimmers like scales,

368
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,050
hence the name Seadragon Heap.

369
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:31,570
How do you know
it isn't frost or snowfall?

370
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:32,970
Snow covers a large area,

371
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:34,440
unlike in the photo.

372
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,640
Frost forms when water vapor condenses,

373
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,360
typically occurring
around sunrise and sunset.

374
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
In the photo, the sun is bright,

375
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,010
so the frost would have melted.

376
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:42,680
This place is at a high latitude,

377
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,010
with long daylight hours.

378
00:25:44,010 --> 00:25:45,920
In the summer,
it doesn't get dark until around 11p.m.

379
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:48,530
Take me to Seadragon Heap.

380
00:25:48,970 --> 00:25:50,120
And I'll take you to find Kong Yang.

381
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:53,400
Finding a guide to Dalpur is easy,

382
00:25:53,810 --> 00:25:55,770
but getting someone
who knows Kong Yang's whereabouts?

383
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,440
You won't find another person.

384
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,010
Goose Head Dunes
is far from Seadragon Heap.

385
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,680
How could a body appear there,

386
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:05,200
embedded in clay?

387
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,400
How would I know?

388
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:08,200
How many times do you want me to say it?

389
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,360
I'm only responsible for finding people,
and you're in charge of guiding.

390
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,970
Whether go or not is up to you.

391
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,330
Are you taking it?

392
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,120
Just do it.

393
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,770
It's settled. Give me your phone.

394
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,810
When you're ready to leave,
give me a call.

395
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,090
I'll be here during the day.

396
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,880
If you can't find me, call me.

397
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:47,600
Chang Dong.

398
00:26:48,330 --> 00:26:49,490
Where are you staying at night?

399
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,330
What's the matter?

400
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,330
I want to shower at your place.

401
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,640
You've already paid for the room.

402
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,160
You should make use of the water.

403
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,880
I don't feel like going
to a public bathhouse either.

404
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:59,160
Can't you shower at your own house?

405
00:26:59,730 --> 00:27:01,160
This is my house.

406
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,170
(Han and Tang Charm)

407
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,810
History Museum.

408
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:36,230
(May Business Prosper)

409
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,090
That one you talked about.

410
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,920
The one who appraised
the Sheep's Horn Cup at your place.

411
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:44,330
Were they male or female?

412
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,090
Was it genuine or fake?

413
00:27:46,360 --> 00:27:47,090
She's a woman.

414
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:48,090
Let me tell you,

415
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,120
I and the master
both examined it closely.

416
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,920
That item is definitely genuine.

417
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,440
It's a whole piece of twisted agate.

418
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:55,440
It has exquisite jade carving,
and a golden cap on the mouth and nose.

419
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,810
Then why didn't you acquire it?

420
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,010
The Sheep's Horn Cup is quite famous.

421
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,770
The museum has one in its collection.

422
00:28:00,770 --> 00:28:03,160
At first glance,
you might think it's a fake.

423
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:05,050
You wouldn't assume it's real.

424
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:07,120
Plus, she's not selling it.

425
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,440
As soon as that woman left,

426
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:09,600
I realized my mistake.

427
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
Alright, alright, that's all.

428
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,400
(Han and Tang Charm)
Head west when you go out, for great wealth.

429
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,660
A noble person comes from the east,

430
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:17,560
Chang Dong.
[* "Dong" means "east"].

431
00:28:18,050 --> 00:28:19,730
Chang Dong is looking for Ye Liuxi.

432
00:28:19,730 --> 00:28:21,440
Ye Liuxi, Xi.
[*"Xi" means "west"]

433
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:23,330
Ye Liuxi.

434
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,330
Sheep's Horn Cup.

435
00:28:26,250 --> 00:28:27,600
Great wealth.

436
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:03,010
What's wrong?

437
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:03,600
Miss.

438
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:04,770
Are you feeling cold?

439
00:29:04,770 --> 00:29:07,010
How about resting at my place for a while?

440
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,010
Maybe have a drink to warm up?

441
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,360
Let me take a look.

442
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:12,440
Looks pretty good.

443
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,050
Do I look good?

444
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:14,090
I want to try it too. Let me try.

445
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,160
Don't lie to me, okay?

446
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:18,880
What's wrong?

447
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:19,250
Look.

448
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:23,290
I feel sorry for this woman.

449
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:24,600
She's in trouble.

450
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,530
This man has a bad reputation.

451
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:29,530
He puts drugs in people's drinks.

452
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,250
He specializes in terrible things.

453
00:29:31,250 --> 00:29:32,050
Really?

454
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:33,880
Anyway, I see that the woman

455
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,160
is quite willing too.

456
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,490
You're so annoying.

457
00:29:36,490 --> 00:29:38,730
Alright, I'm running out of time.
Give everything back right now.

458
00:29:38,730 --> 00:29:39,770
Isn't it my turn?

459
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:41,490
This is the lipstick I just bought.

460
00:29:41,490 --> 00:29:42,600
What are you doing?

461
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,570
Don't snatch it from me.

462
00:29:43,570 --> 00:29:44,810
You just say
you would let me try it?

463
00:29:57,720 --> 00:29:59,640
(Do Not Disturb)

464
00:30:05,810 --> 00:30:06,570
Ye Liuxi.

465
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:07,600
Ye Liuxi.

466
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:24,530
You called me?

467
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:30,290
Why are you calling my name
while facing a hotel room door?

468
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,250
You know I can't afford a hotel.

469
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:35,290
Just now, you...

470
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,250
I just parked my car
in the rear parking lot.

471
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:39,570
As soon as I got up here,
I heard you calling my name.

472
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,970
I said I was coming to your room
to take a shower.

473
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,810
Is this the second floor?
You're staying on the second floor?

474
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,810
Yes, I got the wrong person.

475
00:30:53,570 --> 00:30:54,290
Chang Dong.

476
00:30:56,090 --> 00:30:57,200
Are you okay?

477
00:30:57,770 --> 00:30:59,290
Why are you panting?

478
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:03,490
Come with me.

479
00:31:24,530 --> 00:31:26,120
The bathroom is inside.

480
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,330
Take your time.

481
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,600
