1
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,070
Qingzhi.

2
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:51,600
Qingzhi.

3
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,600
You're still alive.

4
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,110
Ye Liuxi.

5
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,960
You deserve to die miserably.

6
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:10,710
Kill him!

7
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,790
So many of Scorpion Eye have died.

8
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:18,920
All because I wrongly trusted Ye Liuxi.

9
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:23,870
Please kill me.

10
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:29,510
Get up.

11
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:38,120
Get up.

12
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:44,480
Even if I kill you,

13
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,920
we won't get Huyang City back.

14
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,790
Make amends for your deeds.

15
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,350
As long as I'm alive,

16
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,510
I will definitely kill her

17
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,000
for you

18
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,120
and to avenge Scorpion Eye's members.

19
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,070
Kill her?

20
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:09,750
Have you ever had feelings for her?

21
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,190
Kill them.

22
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:17,500
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

23
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,740
=Episode 25=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

24
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,750
(Right now, the Parasitic Flower)

25
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:40,000
(is only using her body at night.)

26
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
(When the flower finally blooms,)

27
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,120
(this girl's body)

28
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,600
will completely become

29
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:46,800
a corpse,
just an empty shell for fertilizer.

30
00:04:55,430 --> 00:04:56,160
Morning.

31
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,800
Are you going out?

32
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,360
There might be a fight at night.

33
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,000
I want to find a suitable weapon.

34
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,270
The shovel

35
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,870
is not handy at all.

36
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:09,870
You should ask Mr. Zhao for one.

37
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,270
Feather Guards are skilled in combat.

38
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,310
They have all sorts of weapons.

39
00:05:13,310 --> 00:05:14,720
Find something powerful.

40
00:05:18,310 --> 00:05:19,270
Liu.

41
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,750
I was just thinking,

42
00:05:24,190 --> 00:05:25,800
maybe you shouldn't go tonight.

43
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,510
The rest of us should be...

44
00:05:38,630 --> 00:05:39,950
Jiang Zhan asked to meet at 11:00 p.m.

45
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,430
After we finish eating,
let's take a break

46
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,800
and get ready to go.

47
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,310
By the way,

48
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:48,390
can we not bring Liu along tonight?

49
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,430
I'm worried about any potential danger.

50
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,950
Are you done yet?

51
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,920
It's like this.

52
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:56,540
When we just arrived
in the deserted village,

53
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:58,040
Sheep's Horn Cup was swapped out.

54
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,630
It indicates that Zhao Guanshou

55
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:01,070
must be playing tricks
behind the scenes.

56
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,870
And the kidnapping of Fatty Tang

57
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,720
might also be his doing
to stir up trouble.

58
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:06,360
I'm done eating.

59
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,070
I'm going for a walk for digestion.

60
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,630
Imagine.

61
00:06:16,630 --> 00:06:17,630
If we all leave,

62
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,160
leaving Liu alone,

63
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:19,950
it will not be safe.

64
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,920
We don't want to get Fatty Tang back

65
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:23,160
but lose Liu.

66
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,430
What do we tell Liu Qi after we go out?

67
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:27,480
Dong.

68
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,870
If Zhao Guanshou is up to something,

69
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:30,720
can we still leave here smoothly?

70
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
We tackle tasks one by one,

71
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,750
just like eating our meal
one bite at a time.

72
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,600
We need to meet two criteria
to go back to outside the pass.

73
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,630
First, safety.

74
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:41,000
Second, everyone must be present.

75
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,600
I have an idea.

76
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,000
We'll all go
to the Gold Mine Mountain together,

77
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,560
but in two groups.

78
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,390
Liuxi.

79
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,750
You and I will enter the mine

80
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:50,870
while you two stay outside.

81
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:52,870
Gao Shen,
your priority is to protect her.

82
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:57,750
Eating firstly, anything then.

83
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,360
No worries.

84
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,430
We don't know what the situation is

85
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,800
inside the mine.

86
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,750
If we all go in together

87
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:13,560
and something goes wrong,
we'll all be implicated.

88
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,430
So you two stay outside

89
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,310
to guard against Zhao Guanshou's tricks,

90
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,190
and in case

91
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,430
something happens to us,
we can count on you.

92
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,190
Gao Shen, do you have a suitable weapon?

93
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,830
I told the guards this morning.

94
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,040
I requested two iron staffs.

95
00:07:30,040 --> 00:07:31,480
Preferably a nunchuck with a chain.

96
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,950
I'm more familiar with that one.

97
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:33,720
Okay.

98
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:36,270
So, I'll leave the gun to you.

99
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,920
It's unsafe to bring a gun
into the mine.

100
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,070
It might cause a cave-in.

101
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:40,830
Liu, remember this.

102
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:42,270
You must appear weak.

103
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,870
Everyone thinks Gao Shen is hard to handle,
so they won't pay attention to you.

104
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:48,070
You're a stratagem.

105
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,600
Act at the critical moment,

106
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,360
and there will be unexpected results.

107
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,190
Got it.

108
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,510
Miss Ye.

109
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,510
Mr. Zhao.

110
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,830
Is there something you need?

111
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,630
We'll be setting off shortly.

112
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,430
So early?

113
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:04,270
It looks near,
but it is actually quite distant.

114
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,310
The Gold Mine Mountain

115
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,870
is not as close as you imagine.

116
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:07,480
Besides,

117
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,560
before we depart,

118
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,600
we need to make some preparations.

119
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,070
Can you give me 15 minutes?

120
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:14,040
Sure.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,950
Come over here.

122
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,680
Mr. Zhao.

123
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:23,190
This is Li Jin'ao,

124
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,720
a sorcerer from the Li family.

125
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:26,310
He would like

126
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:28,000
to visit the Demon Museum. Is that okay?

127
00:08:28,870 --> 00:08:29,950
Yes.

128
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,000
I have this.

129
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,080
Look, I have this.

130
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,000
Miss Ye, we've investigated thoroughly.

131
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,120
Strictly speaking,

132
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,840
Mr. Li Jin'ao is only related by surname

133
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,670
and has no other affiliations
with the Li family.

134
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,440
He's not recognized
by the Li ancestral shrine.

135
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
He doesn't qualify
as an authentic sorcerer.

136
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,750
Giving him a sorcerer badge
is merely a formality.

137
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,870
If he wants to enter the museum,

138
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,510
he's far from meeting the requirements.

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,000
This is what I mean, Mr. Zhao.

140
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,840
Could you do me a favor?

141
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,270
He's my friend,

142
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,910
and he just wants to have a look inside.

143
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,630
There's nothing confidential
in there anyway.

144
00:09:01,030 --> 00:09:02,600
If you're still concerned,

145
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,900
you can have someone keep an eye on him.

146
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:06,600
Miss Ye, it's a matter of protocol.

147
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,150
I...

148
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,000
Alright.

149
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,600
Go make the arrangements.

150
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,670
Yes, Mr. Zhao.

151
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:18,790
See you later.

152
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:24,840
Liu...

153
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:26,600
Don't talk. Go eat.

154
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:41,480
Li Jin'ao.

155
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:43,030
Could you lend us a rooster?

156
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:43,870
Sure.

157
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,550
Which one do you want?

158
00:09:45,550 --> 00:09:46,270
How about this?

159
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,390
Take both of them.

160
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:47,960
No need.

161
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,960
Just Ocean will do.

162
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,870
Right.

163
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:51,750
Ocean Guardian is fierce.

164
00:09:51,790 --> 00:09:52,840
It's not like Valley Guardian.

165
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,600
Nothing has happened yet,

166
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,700
but it has already scared itself.

167
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,870
Go ahead and eat.

168
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,270
Come with me.

169
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,870
What's wrong? Backache?

170
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,630
Let me give you a massage.

171
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,519
This belt is made of a softer material.

172
00:10:30,519 --> 00:10:32,320
You won't feel uncomfortable wearing it.

173
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,320
You're so kind to me.

174
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:37,679
How can I repay you?

175
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,039
How can you repay me?

176
00:10:43,879 --> 00:10:44,600
Well,

177
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,320
once we're at Gold Mine Mountain today,

178
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:48,759
I want you to stay calm,

179
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,960
keep a cool head,

180
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,759
and avoid getting into any accidents.

181
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:53,000
That's all I want.

182
00:10:59,360 --> 00:10:59,759
Here.

183
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:00,900
Let's try hanging the blade.

184
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,679
I wonder what Jiang Zhan
has prepared for me.

185
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,879
I keep hearing others talking about it.

186
00:11:09,679 --> 00:11:11,320
It's getting me quite excited.

187
00:11:12,879 --> 00:11:13,840
I also want to know

188
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:15,120
why he

189
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,120
left only me behind back then.

190
00:11:18,039 --> 00:11:18,639
Done.

191
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:23,679
Is it convenient?

192
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,120
Does it work for you?

193
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,600
Can I take it off?

194
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,480
Why?

195
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,879
It'll be easier
for me to draw the blade.

196
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:37,679
It's pretty convenient
hanging there too.

197
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,000
Sign here.

198
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:31,060
Mr. Zhao. Here are the records
of those leaving the city in recent months.

199
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:43,140
These are the records of people
who went in and out of the city in recent months.

200
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,279
(Records of go in and out the city)
I heard Jiang Zhan snuck into Black Stone City.

201
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:48,600
If I were him,

202
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,879
I would've dug several tunnels by now.

203
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,279
I wouldn't have come through here.

204
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,279
That's impossible.

205
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,600
Beneath Black Stone City,

206
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,879
there is a massive hemisepherical boulder.

207
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:59,360
It can't be dug through.

208
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,519
There's rock beneath this city?

209
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:01,320
That's right.

210
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,559
Once it was built,

211
00:13:02,559 --> 00:13:05,799
the city and the boulder
became joined together like a roly-poly.

212
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:06,879
Even if there's an earthquake,

213
00:13:06,879 --> 00:13:08,440
the city moves with the boulder.

214
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:10,279
It won't collapse.

215
00:13:10,279 --> 00:13:11,759
He can't escape through tunnels.

216
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:13,080
But, you failed to catch him.

217
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,000
How do we explain this situation?

218
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,320
What does this stamp mean?

219
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:20,399
It's the Long family.

220
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:22,840
So,

221
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,879
since there was nothing unusual,

222
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,519
we should hurry up and get going.

223
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,639
We still need to set things up
when we get to the mine.

224
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:29,480
Let's get into the cars.

225
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,159
There wasn't anything unusual?

226
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:43,879
Was the Longs' gold stamp not unusual?

227
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,879
He.

228
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,679
When the Longs enter and exit the city,

229
00:13:47,799 --> 00:13:49,320
do they just need to use their gold stamp?

230
00:13:49,679 --> 00:13:50,540
Isn't that a bit too casually?

231
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,519
That means anyone
who has the dragon-headed gold stamp

232
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:53,620
won't have to sign their names.

233
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,360
About that...

234
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,879
Ever since the sandstorm at Huyang City,

235
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,679
Mr. Zhao's relationship with Long Shen

236
00:14:00,679 --> 00:14:01,600
has been rather poor.

237
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,879
Mr. Zhao knows he was in the wrong,
so he keeps giving in every time.

238
00:14:03,879 --> 00:14:06,559
Feather Guards who are under him
will obviously follow his example.

239
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:09,080
Whenever the Longs are involved,

240
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,799
everyone just turns a blind eye.

241
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,000
No one dares to nitpick.

242
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:15,440
Jiang Zhan snuck into Black Stone City
a long time ago.

243
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,759
You've searched the entire city
and failed to find him.

244
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,180
Do you think
he might have moved in with the Longs?

245
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,639
Also, you couldn't find him
despite setting up inspection points,

246
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:23,700
but vehicles belonging to the Longs
weren't allowed to inspect.

247
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,320
Watch what you say, Liu.

248
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,480
These are just minor conflicts.

249
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,940
Even if Feather Guards and the sorcerers

250
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,860
have a bad relationship,
they won't protect Scorpion Eye.

251
00:14:29,879 --> 00:14:31,919
Sit tight. We're heading off now.

252
00:15:08,559 --> 00:15:09,320
He.

253
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:11,120
Do your family live in Black Stone City?

254
00:15:13,919 --> 00:15:15,320
They did at first.

255
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:16,679
Later on,

256
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:19,879
many markets were opening up,

257
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,879
so a lot of people
were sent to guard them.

258
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:26,159
Many residents were forced to move too.

259
00:15:26,159 --> 00:15:27,320
Basically all of those who left

260
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,200
never came back.

261
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:32,320
When I was young,

262
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,480
my family was chosen
to move to Huyang City.

263
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:37,840
The situation there was terrible.

264
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,759
I'm an only daughter.

265
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:42,759
My parents didn't want me
to suffer with them,

266
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,279
so they gathered a lot of money

267
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,679
and managed
to get me into Feather Guards.

268
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,559
I could get a better life there.

269
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,360
What happened after that?

270
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,519
Did you keep in touch with your parents?

271
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,399
I really wanted to keep in touch with them,

272
00:15:57,159 --> 00:15:59,120
so I trained very hard.

273
00:15:59,559 --> 00:16:00,840
I just wanted

274
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,399
to try my best
to take on those missions.

275
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,440
Maybe I would get the chance

276
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
to hear news of them.

277
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,000
Eventually,

278
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,320
Huyang City was destroyed.

279
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,360
My parents are probably gone too.

280
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:22,399
You teased me for saying "we"
when I talked about Feather Guards.

281
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:24,200
I was just trying
to give you a reminder.

282
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,519
I meant well.

283
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,600
I'm used

284
00:16:28,919 --> 00:16:31,679
to being "we" with Feather Guards.

285
00:16:32,559 --> 00:16:34,200
Even though I'm a substitute tongue,

286
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,519
I'm still a part of Feather Guards.

287
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:39,879
Who else am I along with?

288
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:42,840
I have no family and no friends.

289
00:16:43,679 --> 00:16:45,799
At least Feather Guards keep me fed.

290
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,639
Have you ever thought about not being
a substitute tongue anymore?

291
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,080
You won't be under anyone's control.
You'll have freedom.

292
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:55,399
That's too good to be true.

293
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:57,360
You're wrong about that.

294
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,200
There are just three steps.

295
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
Think it, do it, and make it happen.

296
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,480
As long as you dare to think about it,
you're a third of the way there.

297
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:09,119
If you don't even dare
to think about it,

298
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,640
then it'll seem nothing good
will come to you.

299
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:15,799
Miss Ye.

300
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,359
What you just said

301
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,160
made you sound like Fatty Tang.

302
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,119
You're usually quite quick-witted,

303
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,880
so why can't you tell who's the original
and who's the imitation?

304
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:17,310
(Gold Mine Mountain)

305
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:17,880
What's going on?

306
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,359
It's bleeding from seven orifices?

307
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:29,380
It is said that
if the Golden Snake's face is bleeding,

308
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:31,620
there's an 80 percent chance
of a major earthquake happening inside.

309
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:35,180
(Golden Snake Face)

310
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:39,279
Mr. Zhao. The Golden Snake
is bleeding from seven orifices today.

311
00:18:39,279 --> 00:18:40,880
- There might be an earthquake.
- Head in first.

312
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,440
Got it.

313
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,680
Get back into the car.

314
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,160
Release the lightning. Draw out the fire.

315
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,960
If we must
bring that rooster in with us,

316
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,480
I have an idea.

317
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,279
What a good idea.

318
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:00,359
It serves as a light source,

319
00:20:00,359 --> 00:20:02,300
and you can still find it
even if it flies away.

320
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:09,440
Miss Ye.

321
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,200
This team of Feather Guards

322
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,000
will take their orders from you.

323
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,559
We've cleared all the mine tunnels

324
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,400
inside the mine.

325
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:23,200
Even if people from Scorpion Eye
have gone in,

326
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,759
there will only be a few of them.

327
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,559
He.

328
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,480
What's the significance of 11:00 p.m.?

329
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,839
Red Flower Tree Inns turn off lights
at 11:00 p.m.

330
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,880
Jiang Zhan
wanted to meet at 11:00 p.m. too.

331
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:40,279
I'm not sure about its significance,

332
00:20:40,279 --> 00:20:40,960
but

333
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,880
11:00 p.m. is the start of the Zi hour.

334
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,680
The Zi hour is the furthest from noon
when Yang energy is at its peak.

335
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:56,119
Ye Liuxi.

336
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,319
You're quite punctual.

337
00:20:58,599 --> 00:20:59,349
You're here.

338
00:20:59,350 --> 00:21:00,830
Yeah, we were waiting only for you.

339
00:21:01,270 --> 00:21:02,400
Head into the mine.

340
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,480
I'll wait for you inside.

341
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,920
I didn't see anyone entering the mine.

342
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:12,680
Jiang Zhan.

343
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,830
Don't tell me you're not in there.

344
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:16,270
Golden Snake was bleeding

345
00:21:16,270 --> 00:21:18,270
from seven orifices during the day.

346
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,550
If you trick me to get in there

347
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,070
to have me buried by the earthquake,

348
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:23,640
it will be my loss.

349
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,270
I'll ask Golden Snake to show itself.

350
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:31,680
Look over there!

351
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,200
Do you believe me now?

352
00:21:41,590 --> 00:21:42,680
There's no need to rush.

353
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,750
We're here for Fatty Tang.

354
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,510
I need to know his condition.

355
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:50,030
How troublesome.

356
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,510
Liuxi.

357
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:01,550
Liuxi, I'm doing fine.

358
00:22:01,830 --> 00:22:02,750
I told Jiang Zhan

359
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,270
that he wouldn't be able
to get Sheep's Horn Cup in exchange for me

360
00:22:05,270 --> 00:22:07,680
and that if he starved me to skins and bones,

361
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:09,640
you might go back on your words.

362
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,000
So, I'm fed well.

363
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:13,030
I've been doing well.

364
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:14,070
Don't worry.

365
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,070
Don't worry.

366
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,960
Fatty Tang, are you in the mountainside?

367
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,300
What do you see from your surrounding?

368
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:23,030
There's a big cave and...

369
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,070
Didn't you say
this is the only entrance?

370
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:36,400
How did he enter?

371
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,000
Was it unguarded?

372
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,880
The entire mine

373
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:44,790
is guarded by Feather Guards.

374
00:22:44,790 --> 00:22:46,920
That place is also
protected by a wall of fire.

375
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,030
Even a bird flying by

376
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:50,200
will be turned to ashes.

377
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,720
Jiang Zhan neither took the entrance

378
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,680
nor passed by that place

379
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:55,920
to get into

380
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:57,160
Ghost Tooth Mine Tunnel.

381
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,640
How did he do that?

382
00:23:01,350 --> 00:23:03,480
Is it true that an earthquake will happen
if Golden Snake bleeds?

383
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:04,620
I can't say that for sure.

384
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,000
Collapses and blockages often happen

385
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:08,070
in Ghost Tooth Mine Tunnel.

386
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:10,500
The Seven Orifices Mine Tunnel
at the Golden Snake Face

387
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,030
is connected to the Golden Pool

388
00:23:12,030 --> 00:23:13,350
where the Golden Snake lives.

389
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:15,720
Once Golden Snake moves, it will also...

390
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,200
Wasn't Golden Snake sealed?

391
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
Why does it still pose danger?

392
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,960
No. Golden Snake is merely old and dense.

393
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:23,880
It's usually as lifeless as a dead tree,

394
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,440
but it's very powerful.

395
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,960
The Golden Pool
where he lives is very corrosive.

396
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,350
It can be deadly.

397
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:32,070
Miss Ye.

398
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,750
Are you sure

399
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,550
that you want to take this risk?

400
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:43,350
Liu, come here.

401
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,030
Deep down, everyone knows
what we are here for.

402
00:23:49,550 --> 00:23:51,510
We claim that it's to rescue Fatty Tang,

403
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:52,920
but that's a pretext.

404
00:23:53,310 --> 00:23:54,720
In the end,

405
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,310
it's all because Jiang Zhan
wants revenge for the city's destruction

406
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,030
and wants the Sheep's Horn Cup.

407
00:23:59,750 --> 00:24:01,110
We can't run away from this.

408
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,880
We might as well face it.

409
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:03,960
Today's the day.

410
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,680
Stay alert while you're outside.

411
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,680
We'll coordinate
from both inside and outside.

412
00:24:12,270 --> 00:24:14,310
There's certainly something off
about Zhao Guanshou.

413
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:15,830
If there's any danger,

414
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,040
just open fire or retreat.

415
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,880
- Understood.
- Safety comes first.

416
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:26,070
Give it to me.

417
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,880
Liuxi.

418
00:24:28,790 --> 00:24:30,790
Please return safely with Dong.

419
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,400
Take care of her.

420
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:36,310
Let's go.

421
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,880
I feel like we're walking into a trap
step by step.

422
00:26:16,790 --> 00:26:17,750
That's for sure.

423
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,750
For Jiang Zhan to choose this place,

424
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,160
it wouldn't make sense
if he didn't have the upper hand.

425
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,790
You're the type of person

426
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:27,350
who likes to crush your own ambitions

427
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,070
to elevate others' prestige.

428
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,550
You don't win fights by intimidation.

429
00:26:31,960 --> 00:26:34,110
It's 70% skill, 20% luck,

430
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:35,310
and 10% timing.

431
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:38,110
Even if everything seems set in stone,

432
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:39,880
there's always a chance to strike back.

433
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,830
You think
we'll suffer a big casualty today.

434
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:44,350
It's possible.

435
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,750
It's alright. We have each other.

436
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:56,920
Stop.

437
00:27:57,830 --> 00:28:00,240
Why aren't you
guarding Black Stone City?

438
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,070
Whose orders are you following?

439
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:04,720
How dare you
intrude into forbidden zone!

440
00:28:12,030 --> 00:28:12,960
Commander of Sorcerers,

441
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,830
why are you with Feather Guards?

442
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:16,440
Is there a change of plan?

443
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,350
They're not one of us!

444
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,400
How many bullets do we have left?

445
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:47,960
Not many.

446
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,750
How can I save her?

447
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:58,160
Kill someone for me.

448
00:28:58,880 --> 00:28:59,750
Liu.

449
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,750
Promise me

450
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:04,550
that you will get back safely

451
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,880
no matter what happens.

452
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,790
Promise me.

453
00:29:12,830 --> 00:29:14,480
All of us must get back safely together.

454
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,300
