00:01:58,170 --> 00:01:59,020
Good morning, Liuxi.

4
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,090
Your car isn't suitable.

5
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,730
Leave your car here and carpool with me.

6
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,610
What's wrong with my car?

7
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,830
Yesterday, you criticized me
for not having legal awareness.

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,940
Today, you're criticizing my car?

After reaching Hongliu,

12
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,890
Fatty Tang will have another car.

13
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,540
Your car isn't suitable for the desert.

14
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,860
You might not even arrive Xingyang.

15
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,650
Wait.

16
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:28,930
Liuxi.

17
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,890
I've already booked a hotel in Xingyang.

18
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,700
I'm not eating or staying with you guys.

19
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,140

I'm wondering if her car
can handle the desert.

There are no absolutes in everything.

43
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,020
She's skilled at driving,

Look at Liuxi.

55
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,330
The bun is only 1.5 yuan each.

56
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,620
Why would she
eat steamed buns and pickles instead?

57
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:03,890
You ordered alot.

58
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,380
There's meat too.

59
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,820
Here you go.

60
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:08,620
No, thanks.

61
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,450
I don't think he looks better than me
by eating so much food.

62
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:20,450
Ugh.

63
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:25,290
I think I'm considered a kind person,

64
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:27,410
but why am I so annoyed by her?

65
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,330
Because she's both poor and arrogant.

Isn't this cool?

69
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:40,330
It is.

70
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,410
Most importantly, it's cheap.

71

74
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,970

I have something else to do.

You?

84

You just arrived
but already eager to make money?

85
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:57,970
Why are you here?

86
00:07:59,450 --> 00:08:01,700
I was eating nearby
and happened to see you.

87
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,060
I've given you all my money,

88
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,140
so I'm financially tight right now.

89
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,770
But one should always
have money at hand.

90
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,620
That way, one won't feel anxious.

91
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:08,700
I have to earn money on my own.

92
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:10,650
Did you just find the job?

93
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,290
I asked around casually.

94
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,940
The job was available, so I took it.

95

You seemed skilled
judging by your stance.

96

I am, indeed.

97
00:08:20,290 --> 00:08:22,020
I love myself
whenever I look in the mirror.

98

If you work at night,

99
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,890
won't it
affect your driving skills at daytime?

100
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,410
Will it?

101
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,850
When have I ever driven slowly?

102
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:36,890
I'll leave you alone, then.

103

104
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,650

it's the perfect time for enjoying life.

108
00:08:48,650 --> 00:08:51,050
Why spend the time on carving leather?

109

I'll join you later.

00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:34,460
It was here.

132
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,610
It was in the bag.

00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:40,250
What's going on?

134
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:50,730
Maybe she has it with her?

135
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,890
That must be

141
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,890

Come here.

145
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,300
People like him should just be banned.

146

It's a crime to have him as a leader.

Why do people
like to take photos of others?

156
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:38,300
You even posted into a group chat.

You…

164
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:47,800
Should it not have dropped?

Hey.

176
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,940
When we eat later, tell Chang Dong

177
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,260
not to go to the restaurant.

178
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,840
Just eat instant noodles.

179
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,100
I think he'll be beaten up.

180
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,100
Beaten up?

181
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,200
What's going on?

182
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,320
Liuxi, I told him not to come.

183
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,840
He won't listen.

184
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,160
Don't worry.
Dong can handle a beating.

185
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:39,400
Worried?

186
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,500
He's the guide.

187
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,100
If he gets beaten up and have to rest,

188
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,500
we'll have to pay for a few more extra meals.

189
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:44,220
Expensive.

190
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,600
He has to eat anyway.

191
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,440
Dong.

192
00:13:58,080 --> 00:13:59,700
You had heat stroke yesterday.

193
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,100
You need meat.

194
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,100
Only the injured need to eat meat.

195
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,000
I don't need it.

196
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,480
I don't have any jobs today.

197
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,900
If you're wiling to pay,

198
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,640
I can be your bodyguard.

199
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,440
Discounted to 500.

200
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,220
I don't need a bodyguard.

201
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,200
500 is fine.

202
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,860
You pay then.

203
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,800
Is this it?

204
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,000
It's him. Let's go.

205
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:42,780
Is this him?

206
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:46,000
Yes. That's him.

207
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,680
Chang Dong.

208
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:55,000
It really is you.

209
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,780
Liuxi, hurry and help.

210
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,060
You're cowering

211
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,050
yet you want me to help?

212
00:15:01,050 --> 00:15:02,340
I can't fight.

213
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,940
You can.
You'll resolve it in no time.

214
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,060
Didn't I help him?

215
00:15:05,060 --> 00:15:06,820
I told him to hide, but did he listen?

216
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:08,420
Chang Dong, my nephew

217
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
is only six.

218
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,540
Tomorrow is his birthday.

219
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,380
Every day, he asks me

220
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,220
when his parents will be back.

221
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,360
When?

222
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,740
What am I supposed to say?

223
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,260
Tell me!

224
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:21,660
You can't just do nothing.

225
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,200
He said I have no sense of justice.

226
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:24,920
He told me not to cause trouble
that would delay the trip.

227
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:26,660
He shouldn't cause delays either.

228
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,500
Even if his leg gets broken now,

229
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,040
he will still have
to head into the desert tomorrow.

230
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,340
If he can't,

231
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:33,240
I'll break his other leg too.

232
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:35,600
If he has a pair of crutches,
he'll be balanced enough to walk.

233
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,540
Dozens of lives are on the line.

234
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,680
Say something.

235
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,420
Is it money?

236
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,640
- Is that it?
- Speak!

237
00:15:42,640 --> 00:15:43,720
How can you still eat?

238
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:44,920
- Speak!
- Stop eating!

239
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,860
Ye Liuxi.

240
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,840
Yeah?

241
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,200
I don't want any trouble today.

242
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,580
I don't want to get beaten up either.

243
00:15:52,580 --> 00:15:53,440
Help me.

244
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:54,640
800.

245
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,100
- Just now, it was 500.
- Keep talking and it's 1,000.

246
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:56,960
He's calling for help.

247
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,000
Fine. Let's go out.

248
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,680
Out!

249
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,060
What are you doing?

250
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:04,680
What are you doing?

251
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,960
Miss, this has nothing to do with you.

252
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,220
- We're after him.
- Stay away or you'll be hurt.

253
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,150
- Come at me then.
- Who even are you?

254
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:14,960
Let me be frank.

255
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,420
He hired me

256
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,800
only because I'm a three-time
national martial arts champion.

257
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:21,000
- Yeah, right.
- And I'm Jet Li, right?

258
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,680
- Let's go.
- Come on!

259
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,030
This place is tiny. Come.

260
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:27,660
- Let's find a place with more room.
- Let's go!

261
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:32,960
Chang Dong.

262
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:34,840
Why are you hiding behind her?

263
00:16:34,840 --> 00:16:36,040
Don't rush, bro.

264
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,040
You're fighting me now.

265
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,620
After you beat me,

266
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,860
you can do whatever you want to him.

267
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:41,820
Alright.

268
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,260
Miss.

269
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,260
Sorry about this.

270
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:46,680
Don't go too hard.

271
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,380
Stop wasting time.

272
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:50,860
All at once.

273
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:54,040
Let's go.

274
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,840
Bro, stop talking to her.

275
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,040
Let's just fight.

276
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:10,940
Is that all?

277
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,380
Do you even know why he's here?

278
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,200
You attacked without asking.

279
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:25,640
I'm here

280
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:28,120
to retrace the Camellia path

281
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,600
to find them.

282
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,200
Can you guarantee you'll find them?

283
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,900
Yes. That's right.

284
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:35,980
I can't guarantee it,

285
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,080
but if we don't find them now,

286
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,060
we'll try again

287
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,820
and again

288
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,680
until we find them.

289
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,740
Not even the professionals

290
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,860
could find them.

291
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,460
Give me one more chance.

292
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:48,360
Chang Dong.

293
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,760
They've been gone for over two years.

294
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:52,600
Fine. You're
finally doing something good.

295
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,820
We keep our word.

296
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,720
We may look down on you but…

297
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:57,090
Chang Dong.

298
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,930
We'll trust you one more time.

299
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,120
Let's go.

300
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,120
Thanks for earlier.

301
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:27,640
Dong.

302
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:30,340
I'll go check in first.

303
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,260
A room for you as well, Liuxi?

304
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,620
It's fine. I'll just sleep in my car.

305
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:51,400
Chang Dong.

306
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:02,800
I don't know what to say

307
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:04,560
but about this matter,

308
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:05,640
don't overthink it.

309
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:07,680
Focus on the Seadragon Heap.

310
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:10,440
Focus on our task.

311
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:11,800
Look to the future.

312
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,820
I didn't expect you

313
00:19:15,820 --> 00:19:17,720
to be capable of reassurance.

314
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,740
You look so pitiful.

315
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,460
You make it
sound like my heart is stone.

316
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,060
Martial arts champion.

317
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:28,340
How much do I owe you?

318
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,460
500?

319
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:33,680
Are going back on your word?

320
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,520
800 was the agreed price.

321
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,200
You gave me 200 extra.

322
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,280
Here.

323
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,200
I don't need it.

324
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,180
Dong.

325
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:02,520
Ye Liuxi is simmering ribs by herself
down there.

326
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,490
It's amazing.

327
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,340
It smells really good.

328
00:20:08,020 --> 00:20:09,680
She's quite funny.

329
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,490
Why wouldn't she stay in a hotel?

330
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:14,490
Why sleep in the car?

331
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:15,540
Ignoring served food,

332
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,970
just to cook for herself.
Isn't it a lot of work?

333
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,760
Is she even a Sheep's Horn champion?

334
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,520
Fatty Tang.

335
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
Do you want some warm soup?

336
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:23,330
Liuxi.

337
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:28,850
Smells good.

338
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:45,330
One bowl for 100.

339
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:18,900
Let's talk after eating.

340
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:34,850
(In July 1930,)

341
00:22:34,850 --> 00:22:36,500
(a man named Gan)

342
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:39,130
(suddenly appeared
on the streets of Fanlong City.)

343
00:22:39,130 --> 00:22:40,660
(Yumen Pass, Yardang Park)
When questioned by the police,

344
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:43,460
the man claimed
that he was exploring in Dalpur

345
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:47,180
but the next moment,
he was in the bustling Fanlong City.

346
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:49,610
(A popular theory)

347
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:50,330
(claims that the man
might have encountered...)

348
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,370
I'm getting tickets.

349
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:53,700
Tickets to this?

350
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,020
I've been here during elementary school.

351
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:56,740
Why should we go in again?

352
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,610
Because I want to.

353
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,260
How much is it?

354
00:22:59,530 --> 00:23:00,420
40.

355
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,500
What?

356
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:02,770
40.

357
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:04,370
It's on me.

358
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:05,940
I'll enter multiple times, then.

359
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,940
I'll go in for the first time,

360
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,500
come out,

361
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
and go in again.

362
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:10,740
For what?

363
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,020
Self-entertainment.

364
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:15,330
Two tickets to Yumen Pass.

365
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,460
Come on. Let's go.

366
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:18,660
Three tickets.

367
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:19,420
To where?

368
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:20,050
Yumen Pass.

369
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:21,610
Three tickets for 120.

370
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:22,660
Pay her.

371
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,260
Pay here.

372
00:23:24,850 --> 00:23:25,570
Liuxi.

373
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,050
Here.

374
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,090
Use an umbrella.

375
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,220
The sun is scorching.

376
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,130
Everyone, let's go inside.

377
00:23:29,290 --> 00:23:29,940
Next,

378
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,900
we'll enter a

379
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,050
very famous ruin.

380
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,180
The ancient Silk Road

381
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,260
divides into north and south from here.

382
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:37,370
We go west
out of the north to Yumen Pass,

383
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,900
and west
out of the south to Xingyang Pass.

384
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,090
Both of these roads are tough.

385
00:23:41,090 --> 00:23:42,050
Why?

386
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,660
Weren't there constantly

387
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,850
envoys and caravans passing through?

388
00:23:45,850 --> 00:23:48,330
I imagined Yumen Pass was huge.

389
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:48,940
Take a look.

390
00:23:49,740 --> 00:23:50,980
Maybe in another world,

391
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:54,370
there exists the Yumen Pass you imagine.

392
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,740
That Yumen Pass

393
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:57,180
might still be buried.

394
00:23:59,090 --> 00:24:00,290
A more romantic idea

395
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,770
is that it eroded away.

396
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:05,050
If an entire city
had been eroded by the wind,

397
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,220
it would be impossible to find.

398
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,660
Not necessarily.

399
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,460
The city might have disappeared,

400
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,740
but the sand is still there.

401
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:14,660
Perhaps

402
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:17,020
it was eroded by the wind
into a sand dune in the desert.

403
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:20,980
Or perhaps, during a sudden sandstorm,

404
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,290
it was carried up into the sky,

405
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,050
and became an entire city up in the air.

406
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,660
If you say

407
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:29,220
the wind carried the entire city
into the sky,

408
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,610
do you think

409
00:24:31,850 --> 00:24:34,290
it might reassemble into a city
during a storm?

410
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,020
If that's really the case, it'll be...

411
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:00,770
Liuxi.

412
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:03,220
Do you know why
Dong insisted on coming here?

413
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:05,130
I'm guessing

414
00:25:05,290 --> 00:25:05,980
this must be

415
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,700
the place where he
and his ex-fiancée, Kong Yang,

416
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,570
made their vows.

417
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,090
Are women these days so naive?

418
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,260
That's because Dong is handsome.

419
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:18,130
Right, Dong?
You made your vows here, didn't you?

420
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,460
It's so beautiful.

421
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:46,290
We should take photos.

422
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:48,220
Why don't you stop the car?

423
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:49,130
Ugh.

424
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,940
Liuxi, can you hear me?

425
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:56,050
Calling Liuxi.

426
00:25:57,020 --> 00:25:57,810
Yes?

427
00:25:58,610 --> 00:26:00,420
Don't you think Dong is too imposing?

428
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,740
There are so many beautiful sights
along the way,

429
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,500
but he doesn't stop the car

430
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:03,900
to let us take photos or anything.

431
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,940
He just stops
wherever he wants to see,

432
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,050
and we have to accompany him.

433
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,740
We don't have any say at all.

434
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,660
Look how he keeps driving ahead.

435
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:13,050
Can't you be more considerate?

436
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,180
Can't you tell?

437
00:26:15,530 --> 00:26:16,660
Even I can tell.

438
00:26:17,130 --> 00:26:18,530
The path he's taking now

439
00:26:18,530 --> 00:26:20,130
is the same as the one before.

440
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:22,660
Can't you allow someone
to reminisce old times for a moment?

441
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,850
One should be allowed
to have a few drinks,

442
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:27,130
bawl a little, or shed a few tears.

443
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:30,740
Perhaps, he's already
crying in the car right now.

444
00:26:31,090 --> 00:26:32,610
Be more understanding, okay?

445
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:34,370
Don't dwell on minor things, alright?

446
00:26:36,770 --> 00:26:38,940
Ye Liuxi, I heard that.

447
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,940
Sure. Whatever.

448
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:45,370
Dong.

449
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:47,020
What's wrong with the walkie-talkies?

450
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,810
They are connected together.

451
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:50,290
I don't mean anything else.

452
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,420
I just find the scenery beautiful.

453
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,290
I'm just saying we can take a picture.

454
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:53,940
It's nothing, really.

455
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,090
You can continue driving.

456
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,330
I didn't mean anything else.

457
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,700
We're approaching the Flowing Sand River

458
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,500
(Troika Desert)
located at the eastern edge of Dalpur.

459
00:27:03,610 --> 00:27:05,740
We're about to cross
the Hundred Mile Flowing Sand Belt.

460
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,180
When the wind is strong,
yellow sand

461
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:09,660
roll like a swift current.

462
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,460
In a moment,
we'll deflate the tires,

463
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:16,370
but keep the tire pressure around 1.8.

464
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:17,500
Shift gears right after starting.

465
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:20,530
If the car feels heavy,
there's a risk of getting stuck.

466
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:21,900
Shift the gear down immediately.

467
00:27:23,050 --> 00:27:24,850
Release the accelerator
and step on it again.

468
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,180
I'm afraid your car
won't make it through.

469
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:29,570
Let's switch cars for this route.

470
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,980
What?

471
00:27:49,350 --> 00:27:52,000
(Mouk Mountain Pass)

472
00:27:54,460 --> 00:27:55,610
You two can stay here tonight.

473
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,530
What about you?

474
00:27:57,700 --> 00:27:59,050
I'm going to Goose Head Dunes.

475
00:28:00,290 --> 00:28:01,740
What if we need to contact you?

476
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,700
What if we can't reach you?

477
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,500
That's impossible.

478
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,420
Don't worry, Liuxi.

479
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,130
As long as there's no wind,

480
00:28:13,130 --> 00:28:14,770
you can find him
by tracing his tire tracks.

481
00:28:15,530 --> 00:28:17,810
The problem is,
are we really letting him go alone?

482
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,420
Why don't you go, then?

483
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:22,050
I'm a coward. I'm scared.

484
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:24,220
Can we even sleep there?

485
00:28:24,460 --> 00:28:25,330
Let's go.

486
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,050
Let's eat and rest early.

487
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,090
I'll sleep in the car.

488
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,090
I'm used to it.

489
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,500
Come on.

490
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:37,090
A little higher.

491
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,090
Everyone, tone down your voice.

492
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:39,500
Gather around.

493
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:41,940
Can't you just let me sleep in peace?

494
00:28:41,940 --> 00:28:44,610
Let's go over our upcoming route.

495
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:46,570
Tomorrow,

496
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:49,460
we'll start from Seven Sand Slope
to Willow Ridge.

497
00:28:53,330 --> 00:28:54,020
Sir.

498
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:55,020
Isn't Goose Head Dunes

499
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,810
marked on the route map?

500
00:28:56,810 --> 00:28:57,610
Aren't we going?

501
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,370
The map is outdated.

502
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,500
We're no longer

503
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,460
going to that place.

504
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:02,900
Buddy.

505
00:29:03,460 --> 00:29:04,850
We can't go there.

506
00:29:05,290 --> 00:29:07,050
Haven't you heard
of the Black Camellia incident?

507
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,020
18 people died. That's bad luck.

508
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,220
Goose Head Dunes

509
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,810
has been abandoned

510
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,050
ever since the Black Camellia incident.

511
00:29:15,050 --> 00:29:16,500
I heard
it's the deadliest desert expedition

512
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,740
in recent years.

513
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,330
The leader of that expedition

514
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,290
should be blamed for this.

515
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,260
He's terrible.

516
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,460
Is that place really dangerous?

517
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:26,770
No, not really.

518
00:29:26,770 --> 00:29:28,740
Goose Head Dunes

519
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,290
is naturally
sheltered from strong winds.

520
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:31,660
So,

521
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:33,420
Goose Head Sand Dunes

522
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,850
is one of the safest areas

523
00:29:34,850 --> 00:29:37,220
in this desert.

524
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,810
The leader

525
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:41,260
was right to lead people there to camp.

526
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:42,940
But he had bad luck

527
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,610
and encountered a strong sandstorm.

528
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:46,050
Let me tell you.

529
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:48,330
The reason this incident

530
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:49,570
became such a big deal later on

531
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:51,850
was mainly
due to Black Camellia's Weibo post.

532
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,770
It claimed that none of them
wanted to go

533
00:29:54,770 --> 00:29:57,850
except for Chang Dong,
who insisted on going.

534
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:01,940
I can only say that they were unlucky.

535
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:04,900
Liuxi.

536
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:06,610
Liuxi.

537
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:08,850
Liuxi.

538
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:26,020
Yumen Pass, Guimen Pass.

539
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:30,260
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

540
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:34,330
You revel in your secret lover at home.

541
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:38,500
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

542
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:54,660
Yumen Pass, Guimen Pass.

543
00:30:54,660 --> 00:31:00,290
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry,

544
00:31:11,660 --> 00:31:13,900
Yumen Pass.

545
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,500
Guimen Pass.

546
00:31:21,130 --> 00:31:25,740
One step out of the pass,

547
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,220
and one's blood shall run dry.

548
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,180
What's this about?

549
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,600
