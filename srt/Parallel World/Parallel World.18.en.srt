00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,760
=Episode 18=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,180
Chang Dong.

4
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,380
Chang Dong, wake up.

5
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:33,460
Where's Liuxi?

6
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,740
I'm here. Come on.

7
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,020
Get out.

8
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,780
Where did Liuxi go?

9
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,060
Where's Liuxi?

10
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:44,620
Where is she?

11
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:46,980
Where is she?

12
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,500
I'm here.

13
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,100
Where's Liuxi? You're not her.

14
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,300
Liuxi has a slim waist.

15
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:08,220
She has a slim waist.

16
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:10,820
Get up.

17
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,300
Why?

18
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,620
Out of all my qualities,
you've only remembered my slender waist.

19
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:27,380
Huh?

20
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,240
-You're biting Liuxi.
-It hurts, you know.

21
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:01,620
Slow down.

22
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:03,620
You're gonna hurt Liuxi's hand.

23
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,660
Can't you eat slowly?

24
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,500
Naughty chicken.

25
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,740
You're awake, Dong.

26
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,700
How are you?

27
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:14,620
I'm fine.

28
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,260
Dong.

29
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,340
Thanks.

30
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,620
Dong.

31
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,380
Liuxi suggested
that Liu take a rest first.

32
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,700
So, we're staying here for now.

33
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:30,220
Look at this chicken.

34
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:32,460
It probably got thrown out
during the collision.

35
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,940
It's neck might be broken.

36
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,300
Liuxi has put a splint on it.

37
00:06:35,860 --> 00:06:36,340
Go.

38
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,060
I'll go check on Liu.

39
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,820
Did those vines catch up with us
in the end?

40
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,540
No, they didn't.

41
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,860
About what happened last night,

42
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,340
it was likely premeditated.

43
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,540
That's for sure.

44
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:52,820
All the chickens in this town died,

45
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:54,140
and the vines inexplicably decided

46
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,020
to sprout at precisely that moment.

47
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:57,220
It couldn't be a coincidence.

48
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,740
When we had just crossed the pass
yesterday,

49
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:03,300
I saw the Camellia cars being driven away.

50
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,780
You're saying
you saw the Camellia cars here?

51
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,140
How is that possible?

52
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,860
If someone deliberately fed the Camellia members
to the salt beast and the sand mounds

53
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,460
and then took the car away,

54
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,980
it's highly probable that the Scorpion Eye group
was behind it.

55
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,980
Someone intended to turn Kong Yang
and the others into that state.

56
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,460
What are you thinking?

57
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,740
Fatty Tang.

58
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,020
I'll go check on Liu.

59
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,180
Why...

60
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:11,940
Why are you staring at me like that?

61
00:08:15,460 --> 00:08:17,420
I hate individuals
who leave things unfinished.

62
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:19,900
Me too.

63
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:21,660
Is my waist slim?

64
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:39,660
Yes, it is.

65
00:08:43,180 --> 00:08:44,780
I never noticed it before.

66
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,140
Liu is awake.

67
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,580
Liu.

68
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,180
Surviving a major disaster
often brings good fortune.

69
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll whip up
some food for you.

70
00:09:12,260 --> 00:09:13,380
It'll be ready in a jiffy.

71
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,220
I'm dying.

72
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,420
I'm only twenty years old.

73
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,460
What's wrong?

74
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:23,340
Liuxi.

75
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:26,180
Those who've suffered a stab
to the head

76
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:28,260
take an unpredictable amount of time
to recover.

77
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:32,140
Yet I've been running around like crazy
and even got involved in a car crash.

78
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,980
Considering the situation yesterday,

79
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,690
running was the only viable choice,
wasn't it?

80
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:36,900
If you didn't run,

81
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,460
you would've been dead by now.

82
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,580
You might as well imagine
that the King of Hell was pursuing you.

83
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:45,300
See, you've survived another day,
haven't you?

84
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,860
I have a gift for you.

85
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:59,180
What's this? It's quite nice-looking.

86
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:01,100
This is the dagger
that was stuck in your head.

87
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:04,380
That's disgusting.

88
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,340
What's disgusting about it?

89
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,020
Think about it.

90
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,860
The dagger was stuck in your head,

91
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,020
yet it didn't kill you.

92
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,980
That means it recognizes you
as its sole master

93
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:14,780
and will forever be your loyal servant.

94
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,340
It'll protect you throughout its life.

95
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,620
It's your lucky charm.

96
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:21,580
That kinda makes sense.

97
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,220
Let's have a meal first.

98
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:26,460
We'll go to the doctor
when we reach Black Stone City.

99
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,460
Look who we have here.

100
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,820
It's you guys.

101
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,660
What a coincidence.

102
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,100
We meet again.

103
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:37,260
That sounds terrifying.

104
00:12:38,740 --> 00:12:40,060
All of you

105
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,260
have been through a lot lately, huh?

106
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,900
What kind of plant is that?

107
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:47,620
Verdant Maiden Vine.

108
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,980
The term "verdant" in the name

109
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:52,140
alludes to both dense clouds

110
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,900
and lush vegetation.

111
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,740
So,

112
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,820
we've named it Verdant Maiden Vine.

113
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,820
If this thing grows,

114
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,020
it grows like crazy.

115
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,860
It can block out the sun,

116
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,980
just like a dark storm cloud
looming over a city.

117
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,060
It has a fondness
for tangling living beings.

118
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,990
This is what is recorded
in the Demon Museum.

119
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,140
Oh, I even came up with a little rhyme.

120
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:21,820
♪As Verdant Maiden roams,
wild vine weaves her way♪

121
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,660
♪Birds ascend on high,
and no human's breath betrays♪

122
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:25,180
♪Upon her flower hairpin's grace♪

123
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:28,020
♪Behind her steps,
a thousand bones find their place♪

124
00:13:28,460 --> 00:13:29,700
I hope you enjoyed it.

125
00:13:30,780 --> 00:13:32,500
What does it mean by "flower hairpin"?

126
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:34,180
Well,

127
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,300
this kind of vine

128
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,140
differs from the typical vine plants.

129
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,900
Typical vine plants
are vulnerable to fire.

130
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,780
But if you use fire
to burn Verdant Maiden Vine,

131
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,700
it's like

132
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,540
putting a flower on its head.

133
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,500
It becomes even more dangerous.

134
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,780
The fire

135
00:13:49,780 --> 00:13:51,300
blazes like it's alive.

136
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:52,380
It will fight back

137
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,700
until it turns you into a charred mess.

138
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,820
It's got nothing to do with you.

139
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:56,850
What's the matter with him?

140
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,460
Fatty Tang.

141
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,020
You nearly got us all killed.

142
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,300
Hey, I wasn't inside.

143
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,500
It couldn't get to me,

144
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,420
so I didn't know about it.

145
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:02,900
Yeah, right.

146
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,860
Alright, alright.

147
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,460
So what exactly is the Demon Museum?

148
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:09,780
Is it just a shelf with items on display

149
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,700
or an actual place?

150
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:12,260
Or perhaps a collection book?

151
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,780
It's all of them.

152
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:17,980
Do you guys
know about the versatile grid shelf?

153
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,060
Yeah, I know.

154
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,420
It's the kind of shelf we have at home

155
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,580
with various-sized compartments
for placing things.

156
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,540
Known as a display shelf.

157
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,660
Know-it-all.

158
00:14:27,620 --> 00:14:29,260
He's quite right about it, actually.

159
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:31,100
Back in the day,

160
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,500
the sorcerers
built a massive display shelf

161
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:37,940
and locked up the exotic beasts in it.

162
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:41,020
They even sealed both sides
with thick walls.

163
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:46,420
This is roughly what it is.

164
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,660
The location of the Demon Museum

165
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:49,380
is to the south
of the Flowing Sand Yardang.

166
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,140
The salt beasts came out from there?

167
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,980
Yeah.

168
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,700
It's been neglected for years.

169
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,780
Some flaws are inevitable.

170
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,540
Have you guys

171
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:01,860
seen the map before?

172
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,420
The nearby landmarks are marked clearly.

173
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:05,220
It's called the Forbidden Zone.

174
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,020
People are worried
the exotic beasts might escape

175
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:09,300
and harm them.

176
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:11,420
They try to stay as far away
as possible.

177
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:14,380
So, the sorcerers compiled a book

178
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,620
called the Demon Museum.

179
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:18,240
It's divided into three volumes:
upper, middle, and lower.

180
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,900
The upper volume
contains records of harmless beasts,

181
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,660
like those goofy beasts

182
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:25,420
that can actually benefit humans.

183
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:27,660
Flowing Light is one of them.

184
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,500
It can light up the dark

185
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:31,500
and guide the way.

186
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,320
There's also the Silver Snake
worshiped by the Qian family.

187
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,060
Despite its small size,

188
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,540
it's said to have the power of prophecy.

189
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:39,140
And lastly, there's my puppet

190
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:40,580
used for shadow puppetry

191
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,340
called gnat.

192
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:43,860
They are all harmless.

193
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,500
The middle volume

194
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,580
records beasts that,
under normal circumstances,

195
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,020
won't harm people,

196
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:53,060
but after being used by humans,

197
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,860
they might pose harm as exotic beasts.

198
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,140
You've previously encountered

199
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:00,220
the most typical one,

200
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,860
Geminus.

201
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,980
If you get friendly with it,

202
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,740
it can help you with tasks.

203
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,500
If you don't, well...

204
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,580
As for the beasts
recorded in the lower volume,

205
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:11,340
I don't need to explain, do I?

206
00:16:11,540 --> 00:16:13,580
We rarely encounter them
in our daily lives.

207
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:17,020
For years, the one
that has run rampant in the world

208
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,660
is the salt beast.

209
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,980
It's the first time
I've seen Verdant Maiden Vine.

210
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,380
We can't stay here.

211
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:32,940
Staying here isn't safe.

212
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,100
The Scorpion Eye members

213
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,980
might come and claim the city.

214
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,420
Aren't the people in the city all dead?

215
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,580
Are you talking about those people
tangled up in the vine?

216
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:42,220
Yeah.

217
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,780
They aren't dead.

218
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,620
People from Scorpion Eye aren't foolish.

219
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,540
If they killed all those people,

220
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:49,820
having an empty city won't benefit them.

221
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:51,820
They have to keep them alive

222
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,940
for future forced labor.

223
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,100
In this kind of situation,

224
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,700
the Scorpion Eye guy from before

225
00:16:58,700 --> 00:17:00,780
should have infiltrated the city, right?

226
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,660
Could it be him?

227
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,700
Alright, let's pack up.

228
00:17:20,260 --> 00:17:21,260
Just say the word.

229
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,340
I'll come help you.

230
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:22,700
No need.

231
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,180
Come on.

232
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,260
It's okay. No need.

233
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,180
I just wanted to ask.

234
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,940
Are you guys
heading to Black Stone City?

235
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,660
Yeah.

236
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,340
Isn't that a coincidence?

237
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:38,060
You guys probably didn't know

238
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:40,460
that I'm heading to Black Stone City too.

239
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:42,340
What a coincidence.

240
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:44,280
I wonder how many people

241
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,420
this van can fit.

242
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,540
Uncle Ao,
what's the name of your rooster?

243
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,580
Ocean Guardian.

244
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,380
- Where did you get?
- Should we bring him along?

245
00:17:50,860 --> 00:17:52,170
Bringing a fellow from inside the pass

246
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,700
makes everything more convenient.

247
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:56,620
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

248
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,460
Li Jin'ao.

249
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,780
Have you been to Black Stone City?

250
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,980
Not yet.

251
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,900
That's quite a big city.

252
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,820
Do we need to be cautious
about anything when going there?

253
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,990
We haven't been there,
and don't want to cause trouble.

254
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,700
You have the customs clearance document
with you, right?

255
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,580
When you arrive at the city gate,

256
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:17,020
just show it to the city guards.

257
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,460
For people like you
who drive metallic van,

258
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:20,900
just mentioning your name

259
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,700
might get someone to come pick you up.

260
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,420
For someone like me,

261
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:28,300
I just have to show this sorcerer badge

262
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,100
and let them know

263
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,860
that I'm from the Li family.

264
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,420
I'm not boasting,

265
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,340
but the city guards
will need to show me respect.

266
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:36,940
Okay, thanks.

267
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,820
No problem. Any more questions?

268
00:18:39,940 --> 00:18:40,700
Go ahead and ask.

269
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,500
Nothing else.

270
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,780
Thanks, Uncle Ao.

271
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:46,260
Uncle Ao.

272
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,180
Black Stone City isn't

273
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,660
a place we can't simply barge into.

274
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,540
Valley Guardian.

275
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:50,740
That's right.

276
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:52,620
We can't leave Valley Guardian behind,
can we?

277
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,460
You're right.

278
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:55,820
Valley.

279
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,420
We don't have the document
he mentioned just now.

280
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,380
How can we get in?

281
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,580
If all else fails, we can forge one.

282
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,700
If we must,

283
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:09,980
we can try borrowing from someone else.

284
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,220
I don't think anyone will lend it to us.

285
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,380
What Liuxi said about borrowing

286
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:17,500
isn't the same as what you have in mind.

287
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:35,160
(Huangtu City Branch,
Red Flower Tree Inn)

288
00:19:45,700 --> 00:19:48,060
This place is much livelier
than where we stayed before.

289
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:49,340
The closer to Black Stone City,

290
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,780
the safer and more prosperous
is the place.

291
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:52,220
Finally, we can relax our guard.

292
00:19:58,940 --> 00:19:59,740
Hello.

293
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,140
I'd like a suite, please.

294
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,260
Please accept my sincerest thanks.

295
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,100
Riding in a metallic van
for the first time was a blast.

296
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:22,980
Where's the room?

297
00:20:23,660 --> 00:20:24,500
By the way,

298
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,300
I need to hurry up
and arrange a few gigs.

299
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,500
See you.

300
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,020
Alright.

301
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,940
Bye, Uncle Ao.

302
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:29,620
Thanks.

303
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,180
Goodbye.

304
00:20:30,180 --> 00:20:30,780
Thank you.

305
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:31,860
See you.

306
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:32,620
Uncle Ao, goodbye.

307
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:33,660
What does "goodbye" mean?

308
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:34,900
Goodbye.

309
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:35,980
I see. It means farewell.

310
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,980
See you, goodbye.

311
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,860
Goodbye.

312
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:47,100
Hey, do you want to watch a play?

313
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:49,340
It's shadow puppetry.

314
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,260
Watch these five fingers, okay?

315
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,980
Put some muscle into these two fingers.

316
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,300
Relax the other three fingers.

317
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,900
Hold the knife loosely, not too tight.

318
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,140
Don't strain your wrist.

319
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,500
Use your shoulder as the pivot point.

320
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,260
If you pivot from your wrist,

321
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,740
you'll get a swing like this.

322
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,020
Your attack range is only

323
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,100
about the blade's length.

324
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,540
Yes.

325
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,900
But if you pivot from your shoulder,

326
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,500
you add the knife's length
to your arm's reach.

327
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,100
Imagine how far you can wield

328
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,980
- and how long this radius can be.
- Right.

329
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,980
- Right?
- Yes.

330
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:14,940
Look.

331
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,700
Chop.

332
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,060
Hack.

333
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,900
Thrust.

334
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:18,660
Block.

335
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:19,620
Lift.

336
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,220
Sweep.

337
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,100
That's enough.

338
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,580
Liuxi, I've got these moves down.

339
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,060
But

340
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:30,420
there must be one killer move, right?

341
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,100
Isn't that right?

342
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,340
Teach me that ultimate move.

343
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:32,940
There is one.

344
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:34,860
In martial arts, what's unbeatable?

345
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,460
Speed.

346
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:36,900
Right, you've learned the techniques.

347
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,460
What do you need to practice next?

348
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,260
- I need to work on my speed.
- Hurry up then!

349
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,100
Chop.

350
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:45,020
Sweep, strike, strike, strike.

351
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,660
There we go!

352
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,820
You've graduated.

353
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:48,220
I've graduated.

354
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,380
You have graduated!

355
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,620
What?
You graduated in just a few minutes.

356
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:53,360
I see Liuxi
tailors her teaching to her students.

357
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:54,780
She's building your confidence first.

358
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,700
Where's Dong at?

359
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,140
He's fixing the car.

360
00:21:58,940 --> 00:21:59,620
Liu.

361
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:01,820
What are you doing?

362
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,860
Why does she look bald at the back?

363
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:06,740
You're talking nonsense. I'm not bald!

364
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,500
Is it the spot where I got stabbed?

365
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,620
Yes, just a little bit.

366
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:12,980
But it's no big deal.

367
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,740
You're young.
It'll grow back quickly. No worries.

368
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,020
What were you talking about?

369
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,640
Practicing with the knife.

370
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,940
Oh no! I am balding so young.

371
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,260
That won't happen. Don't worry.

372
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,140
Fatty Tang.

373
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,260
Keep practicing.

374
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:24,140
Don't stop.

375
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,700
Okay.

376
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,060
I'm going to find Dong.

377
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,500
Why did you hit me?

378
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:33,620
My hand just cramped up.

379
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,900
I can't control it.

380
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,380
What on earth?

381
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:37,980
Hand cramps?

382
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,340
People usually get leg cramps.

What's up?

385
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:01,220
Nothing. You go on.

386
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,700
Is your stomach hurt?

387
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,460
You wouldn't get it.

388
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:39,300
Is it menstrual...

389
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,740
Come on, take a break in the car.

390
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,580
What are you up to?

391
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,300

Yes, it is.

Wait for me a moment.

397
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:36,300
- After I'm done, we'll go back together.

Where's she?

I'm here.

Where's Liuxi? You're not her.

Liuxi has a slim waist.

Chang Dong.

But we should
see things through to the end.

424
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:14,060
Give me something as a keepsake.

425
00:26:19,340 --> 00:26:20,420
Alright.

426
00:26:20,420 --> 00:26:21,260
What do you want?

427
00:26:21,260 --> 00:26:22,340
Your leg.

428
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,020
Nothing much.

429
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:29,340
How about

430
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,940
cut your leg off from here?

431
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,220
If you take one of my legs,

432
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,980
I'll be crippled
for the rest of my life.

433
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,300
Who did I offend to deserve this?

434
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,660
Forget it then.

435
00:26:50,780 --> 00:26:51,500
Fine.

436
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,940
I'm scared of you.

437
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,740
If you're scared of me,
just give me your leg.

438
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:58,500
Can I have you?

439
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:03,980
What do you mean?

440
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,740
Didn't you say it's not the best time?

441
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,580
There's an old saying.

442
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:13,180
"Three strikes and you're out".
So, I'm afraid

443
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,420
that you won't reach out to me again.

444
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:17,020
Now you have hindsight.

445
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
Liuxi.

446
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:57,660
You came back very late last night.

447
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,980
Liuxi.

448
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:06,260
Are you dating someone?

449
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,340
Is it Dong?

450
00:29:11,100 --> 00:29:12,020
Nah, it's Fatty Tang.

451
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,780
Dong is great!

452
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:19,100
Why are you so happy?

453
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,180
I can't have neither the woman

454
00:29:21,180 --> 00:29:22,940
nor the man

455
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:24,500
I have a crush on,

456
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,060
but they're together now,

457
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:27,940
so I'm really happy!

458
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,500
What about you and Gao Shen?

459
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,300
Me?

460
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:34,460
Him? What does he have to do with me?

461
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:35,900
Can you please not mention him?

462
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:38,220
My head!

463
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,820
My head!

464
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:43,100
Does twisting your head
help relieve the pain?

465
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,900
Liuxi!

466
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:38,620
She betrayed you.

467
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:43,780
Kill her.

468
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,820
