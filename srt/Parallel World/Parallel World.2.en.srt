00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,820
=Episode 2=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,860
I'm in luck.

4
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,020
That's a critical moment.

5
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,300
That fat guy.

6
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,260
You did it, right?

7
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,500
What fat guy?

8
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,340
He just drank what he brought himself.

9
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,300
He deserved it.

10
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,060
Why?

11
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,780
Did you let him go?

12
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,220
I gave him a bathrobe.

13
00:03:10,060 --> 00:03:11,820
You gave him a bathrobe?

14
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:13,900
You're really kind-hearted.

15
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,500
At this temperature,

16
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,660
if someone spends the night naked
with the window open,

17
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,540
they could either get frostbitten
or freeze to death.

18
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,140
Once a person dies,
it becomes a murder case.

19
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:23,580
Many people saw you two
going upstairs together.

20
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,700
The police
would question you first.

21
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:25,780
I understand, Chang Dong.

22
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,420
Thank you.

23
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,780
Thank you for caring about me.

24
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:31,900
Ye Liuxi.

25
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,580
Before we get to the Seadragon Heap,

26
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,020
I hope you can follow the rules.

27
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:36,820
Have some legal awareness.

28
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,020
Don't cause any trouble for me later.

29
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:39,100
Afterward,

30
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,620
you can do whatever you want.

31
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,660
Alright.

32
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:52,340
Follow the rules.

33
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:53,460
Have some legal awareness.

34
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,100
Who are you? Do you know who I am?

35
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,500
Do you know me?

36
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,220
What day is it today?

37
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,740
Another one is messing with me.

38
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:22,180
What are you looking for?

39
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,380
I know this car.

40
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:26,580
How about you tell me?
I'll help you find it.

41
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,580
Dong!

42
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,180
Dong!

43
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,420
Fatty Tang?

44
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:41,100
Dong.

45
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:41,900
Don't move.

46
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,540
Dong, quickly tell her

47
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,820
we're a team.

48
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,340
You asked me to investigate her, right?

49
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,540
Quickly tell her.

50
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:52,900
Get up first.

51
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
Dong, do me a favor.

52
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:58,020
- I'm begging you.
- It was you who had him search my car?

53
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,340
I'm begging you.

54
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:01,140
Dong.

55
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:03,980
Yes.

56
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,460
I thought you were a decent person.

57
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:10,860
I didn't expect you
to do such shady things.

58
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,500
What did you find in my car?

59
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,740
I'm sorry.

60
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
I had him search your car

61
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,980
to see what kind of person you are.

62
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,940
But I've thought it over now.

63
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,460
Who you are

64
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,900
and what your identity is

65
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,700
don't matter.

66
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:33,060
As long as you can help me
find Kong Yang.

67
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:36,860
Alright.

68
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:39,020
Considering you let me take a bath,

69
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:40,860
I'll let this go.

70
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:43,220
Thanks.

71
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,260
Took a bath together?

72
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:46,340
Dong.

73
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,620
But Chang Dong,

74
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,940
there shouldn't be a second time.

75
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:53,180
After all,

76
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,740
I don't have much legal awareness.

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,180
Why did you search her car?

78
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,180
Dong.

79
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,500
Ye Liuxi is not playing fair.

80
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,260
She ripped off my friend's goods
in Li City.

81
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,380
He put the words out there,

82
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:21,660
saying whoever could recover the goods

83
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:23,340
would get at least 100,000 yuan
for travel expenses.

84
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,780
If it weren't for you going to Bangs'

85
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,300
to check his store's surveillance,

86
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:27,380
I wouldn't have known

87
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,860
that this is related to Ye Liuxi.

88
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:34,260
We haven't seen each other
for several years.

89
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,540
I haven't been doing well.

90
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,300
I opened a shop,

91
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,900
but I ended up losing money and in debt.

92
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,380
I can't even afford the rent.

93
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,460
You see,

94
00:06:41,460 --> 00:06:43,380
I need to earn this money, Dong.

95
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:46,460
I'm begging you. Please, Dong.

96
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:48,260
Just take me with you.

97
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,460
Alright, whether it's finding the goods

98
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,740
or settling the score with her.

99
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:53,460
Don't let it interfere with my business.

100
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,540
You can trust me, Dong.

101
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,020
I won't interfere with your business.

102
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,060
Dong.

103
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,580
Is this trip to the desert

104
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,660
to find the Camellia team member?

105
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:05,620
Yes.

106
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,700
Ye Liuxi is going too?

107
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:10,020
She says she can find the Camellia.

108
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,260
Dong.

109
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:16,500
Could you take me with you as well?

110
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,620
What are you going for?

111
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,860
The path you're taking

112
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,500
overlaps with the Silk Road

113
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,540
in many places.

114
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:27,020
There must be valuable things
in the sand.

115
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,780
They must be worth something by now.

116
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,500
What if I find one or two things there?

117
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,420
Fatty Tang.

118
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,220
The trip this time

119
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,500
is to find Kong Yang.

120
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:36,700
In my trunk,

121
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,260
I've got 18 body bags to fill.

122
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,420
I have a lot of things to do.

123
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,460
Dong, trust me.

124
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:41,380
I understand the rules.

125
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,140
Either contribute money or effort.

126
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,660
I'll do everything you say.

127
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,220
I won't freeload.

128
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,460
Hey, Dong.

129
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,140
You've got two beds here.

130
00:07:55,140 --> 00:07:56,060
Just let me stay here.

131
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,420
I don't have to book another room.

132
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:58,860
Sure.

133
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:00,580
You just got here

134
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,820
and you searched her car
without first checking into a room.

135
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,420
You're very clear about your priorities.

136
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,580
Don't tease me.

137
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,940
Let me tidy up quickly.

138
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,700
(Contact me if required)

139
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,680
(Contact me if required)

140
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:47,820
What's up?

141
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,340
Where are you? I need to meet you.

142
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,900
(Come to Desheng Street.)

143
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:53,940
Alright, be quick.

144
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,420
Welcome.

145
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:56,900
What would you like to eat?

146
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,260
You can sit inside.

147
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,220
Alright.

148
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,700
Come, handsome.

149
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,140
Take a seat.

150
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,300
(Plus-Size's Grilled Skewers)

151
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:08,820
What would you like to eat?

152
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,100
Whatever she's making.

153
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:16,940
I got it.

154
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:20,060
That girl not only looks pretty,

155
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:21,580
but also grills meat well.

156
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:23,500
You'll know when you taste it later.

157
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,120
(Plus-Size's Grilled Skewers)

158
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,620
Looking for me?

159
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
The guy you met yesterday is called Fatty Tang.

160
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,740
This time he's going with both of us.

161
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,420
I had him rent a car

162
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:40,580
to carry supplies.

163
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,620
- It's more reliable.
- Eat. Are you not eating?

164
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,860
Then I'll eat.

165
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,940
Alright.

166
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,900
We'll enter from Xingyang.

167
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:53,060
If everything goes smoothly,
we'll be out in four days.

168
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,820
Before entering the desert,

169
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:56,420
I'll contact the rescue team.

170
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,460
We will report our GPS location daily.

171
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:00,300
If we're out of contact for 48 hours,

172
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,340
they'll initiate a rescue.

173
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,020
Alright.

174
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,340
Sounds good.

175
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,260
The Seadragon Heap's area

176
00:10:08,260 --> 00:10:09,860
is bigger than half of the Fanlong City.

177
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,020
All directions look the same.

178
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,780
It's easy for people
to get disoriented in there.

179
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,420
What makes you so sure

180
00:10:17,060 --> 00:10:18,420
that you can find Kong Yang's location?

181
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,940
Are you doubting me?

182
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:24,700
It's not doubt.

183
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,180
Tell me a rough location.

184
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,700
I'll plan ahead

185
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:29,660
to avoid detours.

186
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,220
The shape of the Seadragon Heap

187
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:34,580
is like an oblique triangle.

188
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,220
Many people have been there.

189
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:37,500
But most of them

190
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:38,940
followed the path left by predecessors.

191
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,820
They go in and out quickly.

192
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:41,780
This path

193
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:43,660
is taken by many teams every year.

194
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,700
If Kong Yang were in this area,

195
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,140
she would have been found long ago.

196
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:49,260
So before,

197
00:10:49,260 --> 00:10:51,220
you must have entered
the Seadragon Heap's inland.

198
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:53,300
There are three points on this path.

199
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:54,980
This one.

200
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,380
A historical site, the Beacon Tower.

201
00:10:58,140 --> 00:10:58,700
This one.

202
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,140
It has two gasoline drums
filled with sand,

203
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:03,140
marked with red paint as a road sign.

204
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,270
Here.

205
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,630
A hundred-meter ditch

206
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
is stacked with camel skeletons.

207
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,440
Where were you roughly last time?

208
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,270
Beacon Tower?

209
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:24,750
In that area,
there's quite a bit of salt crush.

210
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:25,790
The road is pretty tough.

211
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:26,510
That's why

212
00:11:26,630 --> 00:11:28,440
they haven't found Kong Yang.

213
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,630
Is there a problem?

214
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:35,440
Alright.

215
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,630
We'll meet at Progress Bridgehead

216
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:38,720
at 4:30 a.m.

217
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,150
Why go to Progress Bridgehead?

218
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,510
Why not just meet at the hotel
and go together?

219
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:43,200
No reason.

220
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,840
Why the rush at 4:30 a.m. then?

221
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,870
Just because.

222
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,120
Aren't you going to explain?

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,720
Let's talk about it
when we meet tomorrow.

224
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,400

Benefit Today, Prosper Tomorrow.)

Shouldn't honesty
be a part of being human?

248
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,510
What do you mean?

249
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,000
Did you take that photo?

250
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:13,630
Have you really been to Seadragon Heap?

251
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,790
Is there some misunderstanding?

252
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:30,630
I intentionally

253
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,030
marked a place wrong on this map.

254
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,870
There's no Beacon Tower
at Seadragon Heap.

255
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,030
Yardang landforms are naturally bizarre.

256
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:41,600
What's the big deal
if I mentioned Beacon Tower?

257
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,600
Besides, I was talking
about the general direction.

258
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,000
Alright.

259
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,910
Point me there again.

260
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:58,440
I told you it's right here,
and there's no way it can be wrong.

261
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,440
Pretty smart, aren't you?

262
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,510
Sticking to your guns, I see.

263
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,720
There's no gasoline drum road sign
at Seadragon Heap.

264
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:12,870
No hundred-meter ditch
filled with camel skeletons.

265
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,270
No southeast in

266
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:17,030
and northwest out crossing route.

267
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,000
Seadragon Heap isn't
even shaped like a skewed triangle.

268
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,360
You've never been to Seadragon Heap.

269
00:15:22,390 --> 00:15:24,390
Okay, fine. My mistake.

270
00:15:24,870 --> 00:15:26,790
But I didn't mean to deceive you.

271
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,030
How are you going to resolve this?

272
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,550
I already know Kong Yang
is at Seadragon Heap,

273
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:36,000
and you don't know the exact location.

274
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,840
In other words,

275
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,390
I don't need you.

276
00:15:40,030 --> 00:15:41,200
I can go by myself.

277
00:15:41,510 --> 00:15:43,200
At worst, I'll just stay in Ying City,

278
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,030
and every once in a while,

279
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:46,440
I'll make a trip to Seadragon Heap

280
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,830
and search for her section by section.

281
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,200
Seadragon Heap covers

282
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,080
3,500 square kilometers.

283
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,790
One or two years should be enough.

284
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,870
So, tell me,

285
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,790
why should I bring you along?

286
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,240
Let me remind you.

287
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,510
One lie from a person,

288
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:07,270
and you can give them a second chance.

289
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,720
Once they tell two lies,

290
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,910
they're never worth trusting again.

291
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,630
I didn't mean to deceive you.

292
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,810
It's just that even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

293
00:16:21,870 --> 00:16:23,790
I can even trust this photo,

294
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:25,000
what else can't I trust?

295
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:26,510
That's not the main issue here.

296
00:16:29,390 --> 00:16:33,080
The main thing is,
it would terrify you if I told you.

297
00:16:55,030 --> 00:16:57,870
Let's meet at Progress Bridgehead
at 4:30 p.m.

298
00:16:57,870 --> 00:16:58,960
Be there or be square.

299
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,120
I'll tell you everything.

300
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,240
You'll find out everything
you want to know.

301
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:07,720
I promise.

302
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,160
See you.

303
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:32,030
It's a deal.

304
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:33,440
Hey, Dong.

305
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:34,790
How's this car?

306
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,080
We've been negotiating
all afternoon.

307
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:38,750
The owner of this car
bought it for 60,000 yuan.

308
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:40,960
He rents it to me for 2,000 per month.

309
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,720
A good deal, right?

310
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:44,720
Not bad.

311
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:49,590
Great, this car is really cool.

312
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,750
What time are you meeting her?

313
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,200
4:30 p.m.

314
00:17:54,590 --> 00:17:56,400
It's already past the time.

315
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,880
She hasn't shown up either.

316
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,440
What's this? What is it for?

317
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,030
Self-defense.

318
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:07,880
Don't scare me.
We live in a law-abiding society.

319
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:08,920
What do you need self-defense for?

320
00:18:10,030 --> 00:18:11,070
But then, you're right.

321
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:13,830
It's always good to be cautious.

322
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:16,720
I'm leaving.

323
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,310
Okay.

324
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,550
Just leave the car to me.

325
00:18:31,510 --> 00:18:33,030
Sorry for being late.

326
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,510
No worries.

327
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,480
So, shall we?
It's a one and a half-hour drive.

328
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Where to?

329
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,400
Are you scared?

330
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:45,880
Weren't you curious
to know everything about me?

331
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,480
Besides, a single pretty lady like me

332
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,550
entering the wilderness late at night,

333
00:18:51,550 --> 00:18:53,240
shouldn't I be the one feeling scared,

334
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,070
right?

335
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,750
Come down and walk around.

336
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
Look.

337
00:19:43,790 --> 00:19:44,920
You ran all the way out here

338
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:47,110
just to show me a dirt slope?

339
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:48,160
Of course not.

340
00:19:49,590 --> 00:19:51,400
In the wilderness late at night.

341
00:19:52,350 --> 00:19:53,310
Bare trees.

342
00:19:55,350 --> 00:19:56,680
Hanging noose.

343
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,310
What do you think is missing?

344
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,480
A ghost.

345
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,830
Have you ever had a nightmare?

346
00:20:12,310 --> 00:20:13,270
I've had one.

347
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:14,720
Listen up.

348
00:20:16,510 --> 00:20:17,350
In the dream,

349
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,110
I don't know where my home is

350
00:20:20,110 --> 00:20:21,400
or if I have any family.

351
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,880
I only know
I'm very familiar with the desert.

352
00:20:27,110 --> 00:20:28,640
The dream is quite blurry,

353
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,270
but there's one scene

354
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,510
that's particularly vivid.

355
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:36,350
I was hiding in a water tank
in a corner.

356
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:43,830
It scared me awake instantly.

357
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:45,440
After waking up,

358
00:20:46,030 --> 00:20:47,590
I found myself hanging here.

359
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:52,310
I don't remember how I got here.

360
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,830
I don't remember who I am.

361
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,240
(Purely for dramatic effect.)

362
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,310
I don't even remember this face.

363
00:20:58,310 --> 00:21:00,340
(Purely for dramatic effect.
Please do not imitate.)

364
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,270
Yet you're still alive?

365
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:08,790
Can't you think in a good way?

366
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:09,440
If I were dead,

367
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,070
who's talking to you? A ghost?

368
00:21:12,590 --> 00:21:13,510
How scary!

369
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,310
After I woke up,

370
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,200
I started to recall the cause and effect.

371
00:21:22,830 --> 00:21:25,400
Oh, is amnesia coming next?

372
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,200
In my mind,

373
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:30,830
a large jagged blank space appeared.

374
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:32,640
Jagged amnesia?

375
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:33,920
With shapes even.

376
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,790
I don't think it's amnesia.

377
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,400
I still remember many things.

378
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,680
I remember going to wholesalers

379
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,200
countless times.

380
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,880
I bought all sorts of stuffs,

381
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:49,960
such as clothes, shoes,

382
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:51,310
books, DVDs,

383
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,790
and even celebrity posters.

384
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,880
But I only remember things
before driving into the desert.

385
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,720
I don't remember anything after that.

386
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:03,720
If memory were a piece of paper,

387
00:22:04,510 --> 00:22:06,590
mine seems to have been torn.

388
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:07,790
In other words,

389
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,640
you happen to have completely forgotten

390
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:12,960
all the things I want to know, right?

391
00:22:15,590 --> 00:22:17,640
The way you put it makes it appear

392
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,030
as if I'm specifically picking on you

393
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:20,790
for forgetting the things
you're interested in.

394
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:22,510
It does seem like that.

395
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:24,960
That's what I meant.

396
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,030
Chang Dong, listen to me till the end.

397
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:32,960
After I woke up,

398
00:22:34,270 --> 00:22:35,750
I found a cloth bag,

399
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:38,270
the one I'm carrying right now.

400
00:22:42,350 --> 00:22:43,310
Seagull camera?

401
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,720
They were quite common
in the '80s and '90s.

402
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:48,400
Kong Yang's photo

403
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,960
was found inside it.

404
00:22:55,350 --> 00:22:57,110
And there's something even stranger.

405
00:22:57,590 --> 00:22:59,790
About this gold-inlaid Sheep's Horn Cup,

406
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:01,310
there's an identical one in the museum.

407
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:02,680
I went to Li City

408
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:05,590
and had it appraised
at a collectibles store.

409
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:07,480
The guy said this thing is at least

410
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,510
from the Tang Dynasty or earlier.

411
00:23:22,110 --> 00:23:25,000
When did you wake up from this?

412
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:27,720
A little over a year ago.

413
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,070
You're only checking it now?

414
00:23:30,070 --> 00:23:30,720
Chang Dong.

415
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,000
Do you think
people will explore the universe's mysteries

416
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,960
when they're struggling
to eat and stay warm?

417
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,400
I'm a down-to-earth person.

418
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,830
Secrets can't fly anyway.

419
00:23:39,510 --> 00:23:40,920
But people can starve.

420
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:44,000
Also, whether I know the truth or not,

421
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,830
everything's still the same routine for me.

422
00:23:46,590 --> 00:23:47,830
What's the rush?

423
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:49,880
When the day was about to break,

424
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,750
I saw a town called Qingrang Town.

425
00:23:52,270 --> 00:23:53,880
I got the photos developed

426
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,480
and found information

427
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,070
about Kong Yang, Camellia and you.

428
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:59,350
You already know everything
that happened afterward.

429
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,590
I was flat broke.

430
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:03,720
I had to figure out
how to make a living.

431
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:06,160
So, you started selling melons?

432
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:07,790
You're right.

433
00:24:10,550 --> 00:24:11,550
Barbecue too?

434
00:24:12,030 --> 00:24:13,920
Melons aren't available all year round.

435
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,350
During other times,
I had to do other things.

436
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:18,880
What about that leather-faced mask?

437
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:23,200
How do you know about that?

438
00:24:25,750 --> 00:24:28,310
Those girls
didn't have any sense of safety.

439
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,310
They were walking in dark alleys
late at night.

440
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:32,480
Even if I didn't follow them,
someone else would.

441
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,750
I ensured their safety.

442
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,640
What's wrong
with earning a bit of money for gas?

443
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,310
After making some money,

444
00:24:39,310 --> 00:24:41,270
I started thinking about finding my past.

445
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:44,480
I learned from those business folks

446
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,550
that I was sometimes a southerner,

447
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,510
sometimes a northerner,

448
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:50,070
sometimes married,
sometimes about to be married.

449
00:24:51,110 --> 00:24:52,880
I found out
I quite enjoyed making up stories

450
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,960
about my identity.

451
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,640
Do you ever think

452
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:02,590
that I'm exceptionally intriguing

453
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,030
like a mystery?

454
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,000
Do you think I'd believe that?

455
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,000
You can leave if you don't.

456
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
Am I stopping you?

457
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,000
I don't need you to find Kong Yang.

458
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,000
Chang Dong.

459
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,000
Chang Dong.

460
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:25,200
It's definitely not just a coincidence

461
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,640
that Kong Yang's photo ended up with me.

462
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,830
You want to leave me
and help them with the bodies?

463
00:25:29,830 --> 00:25:31,680
Do you think I want something from you?

464
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:33,830
Even if I did, are you even worth it?

465
00:25:33,830 --> 00:25:35,590
You can't even face yourself till now.

466
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,110
You need to hide
behind someone else's identity

467
00:25:37,110 --> 00:25:38,640
just to stand up straight.

468
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,160
This is how you'll be
for the rest of your life.

469
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,920
Keep playing with your shadow puppets.

470
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:45,000
I wish you an early Golden Knife Award.

471
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,070
Goodbye.

472
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:49,030
When trade falters, integrity prevails.

473
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,790
No need to make it personal
if cooperation fails.

474
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,750
I'm not one to take advantage of others.

475
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,510
Since we're in this together,

476
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:22,680
take the money.

477
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:35,830
All of this is what you've saved up.

478
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:36,830
You're right.

479
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,920
It's all my hard-earned money.

480
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:44,720
Alright.

481
00:26:45,070 --> 00:26:45,680
I'll take it.

482
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:51,960
(Qingrang Hotel)

483
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,720
Why did you just come back?

484
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,880
I had a really ominous dream just now.

485
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,640
In my dream, Ye Liuxi killed you.

486
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,880
Can you believe it?

487
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,070
What were you talking about?

488
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,350
You talked for such a long time.

489
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,680
We agreed
to enter the desert together tomorrow.

490
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,550
We leave at 10:00 a.m.

491
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,720
Where did this money come from?

492
00:27:28,070 --> 00:27:29,590
We'll have many expenses ahead.

493
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,750
This is her share.

494
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,440
If you're free,

495
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,680
you can count the money.

496
00:27:34,310 --> 00:27:36,480
Sure, I don't mind counting money.

497
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:40,270
Is this all small change?

498
00:27:45,750 --> 00:27:47,160
(There's a reason for everything.)

499
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:50,070
(Kong Yang's photo appearing here)

500
00:27:50,070 --> 00:27:51,590
(is definitely not just a coincidence.)

501
00:27:57,310 --> 00:27:58,830
When will you be back

502
00:27:58,830 --> 00:27:59,960
after taking Camellia into the desert?

503
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,440
This time, we're going west
along the Yumen Pass,

504
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,880
and we'll be back pretty soon.

505
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,350
Come with me,

506
00:28:05,510 --> 00:28:06,310
will you?

507
00:28:22,790 --> 00:28:23,480
Alright.

508
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:25,310
You little fool.

509
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,270
Thank you.

510
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,480
I thought you wouldn't come with me.

511
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:32,960
Why did you think that?

512
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:35,200
You don't like the desert, right?

513
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:36,350
True.

514
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:39,070
I don't like the desert.

515
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:42,110
But I like you.

516
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,960
I know you'll protect me.

517
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,000
Alright.

518
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:23,110
The total is 3,742.3 yuan.

519
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,920
Let's hit the sack.

520
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,790
Dong.

521
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,070
What do you think about Ye Liuxi?

522
00:29:42,110 --> 00:29:43,790
We're heading
to the desert together soon,

523
00:29:43,790 --> 00:29:45,000
and I don't know much about her.

524
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,680
I'm a bit uneasy.

525
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,350
Could she be the one

526
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,070
behind those serial murders?

527
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,240
Like I said,

528
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,680
if you don't provoke her,
she won't strike first.

529
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,400
Should I invite her for a meal

530
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:01,880
and make amends?

531
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:04,400
After all,
the last encounter was quite unpleasant.

532
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:08,790
Stay away from her.

533
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:11,550
She's the kind of person
who switches

534
00:30:11,550 --> 00:30:12,870
between speaking sense and talking nonsense.

535
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:13,750
She's unpredictable.

536
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,270
She's a bit like me in that regard.

537
00:30:16,680 --> 00:30:18,160
When I'm selling my counterfeit goods,

538
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,350
I talk a lot of nonsense too.

539
00:30:21,590 --> 00:30:22,720
Time to sleep.

540
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,200
Fatty Tang.

541
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:27,240
If one day,

542
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,510
you wake up from a nightmare

543
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,750
only to discover
that you're suspended from a big tree

544
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,160
in the remote wilderness,

545
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,510
with no one else in sight.

546
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:39,790
And you find yourself having memory loss.

547
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,350
How would you react?

548
00:30:43,790 --> 00:30:45,200
I'd definitely be scared out of my wits.

549
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:50,590
So, with your level of courage,

550
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,960
it's best to put that Sheep's Horn
out of your mind.

551
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:55,750
What are you trying to say?

552
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:57,510
I'm going to sleep.
