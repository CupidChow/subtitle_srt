(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

00:01:41,112 --> 00:01:43,912
=Episode 6=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,350
Hey,

4
00:01:58,350 --> 00:01:59,710
will we see the shadow puppets tonight?

5
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,590
It's not strange if we see that.

6
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,280
If we can't find Kong Yang this time,

7
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,560
what should we do?

8
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,560
I have prepared for that.

9
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:12,310
Only when people die, they don't get buried.

10
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,150
I always felt like something was missing.

11
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,000
What about you?

12
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,310
If this trip doesn't pay off,

13
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,430
aren't you right back where you started?

14
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,030
I am not in a hurry.

15
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,430
The people who want to kill me should be worried.

16
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:30,840
Why do you think someone wants to kill you?

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,240
Do you think I have the personality

18
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,280
to hang myself?

19
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,840
It's obvious that someone hoisted me up there.

20
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,520
I was unconscious. It was easy to kill me.

21
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,520
One cut will do.

22
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,030
But I'm not dead.

23
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:48,030
Well, then let me live without knowing anything.

24
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:50,030
And someone had to leave me a bag

25
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:52,590
with something in it
that would make people suspicious.

26
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:55,840
Isn't it obvious someone wants me
to find the truth on my own?

27
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,430
You asked me

28
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,030
why it took me so long to investigate something

29
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,190
that happened over a year ago.

30
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,240
I did it on purpose.

31
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,720
I take my time doing idle work.

32
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,072
(Plus-Size's Grilled Skewers)

33
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:10,120
I just wanted to see

34
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,590
if those guys would lose their cool.

35
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,750
Turns out, there's really no clue.

36
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:18,280
They are really slow, like turtles.

37
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,470
I investigated
from Kong Yang to Camellia Incident,

38
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,080
then to you.

39
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Now I am here.

40
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,120
Isn't that just walking into

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,000
someone's trap step by step?

42
00:03:29,590 --> 00:03:30,520
So I said

43
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:33,800
the real worry is the people behind it.

44
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,150
Well, if you say so,

45
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:40,560
the worse it gets.

46
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:42,910
I don't care about that.

47
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:45,470
I have already died once.

48
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,280
I'm looking at the landscape on borrowed life.

49
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:51,360
I realize

50
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,750
I'm not as open and transparent as you.

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,710
What kind of environment

52
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:57,310
can produce your character?

53
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:14,840
Fatty Tang!

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,920
He's got a lot of nerve now,

55
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,360
hanging out with those guys.

56
00:04:32,950 --> 00:04:33,870
Liuxi!

57
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:34,390
What a coincidence.

58
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:35,750
We meet again.

59
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,720
Buddy.

60
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,870
It's hard to make a living.

61
00:04:38,190 --> 00:04:40,360
So we decided to pull out early.

62
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,310
And we followed your flags for shelter and rest.

63
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,920
The wind is strong.

64
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:46,360
Let's change to another place to pitch the tent.

65
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,190
Okay.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:48,830
Come with me.

67
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:02,560
Get our stuff.

68
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,390
Who's there?

69
00:05:58,830 --> 00:05:59,680
Who!

70
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:01,800
Who are you?

71
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,360
Chang Dong, what's wrong with you?

72
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,360
Do you know why I asked you to leave?

73
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,510
Fatty Tang.

74
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,920
If it wasn't for all the years
we've known each other,

75
00:06:18,310 --> 00:06:20,270
you'd be dead here and I'd leave you alone.

76
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,390
You made your choice.

77
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:24,630
Hui Ba is desperate for money.

78
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:25,870
And sooner or later something will happen.

79
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,830
If you want to die with him,

80
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,160
then suit yourself.

81
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:31,310
Stop there.

82
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,480
Come back, Chang Dong.

83
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:33,480
Come on!

84
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,630
What did I do?

85
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,630
Tell me!

86
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,830
I already knew

87
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,680
what you and Ye Liuxi were thinking.

88
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:44,830
You two already knew

89
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,160
that I kept an eye on the Sheep's Head of hers.

90
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:46,920
Right?

91
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
Then you just watched me act up,

92
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,600
and saw when I stole this thing.

93
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,630
I want to ask you
that I did have this idea,

94
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,680
but did I steal it?

95
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:54,120
No!

96
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,680
I didn't do anything!

97
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,630
So what do you think?

98
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,920
Is it a crime to think about it?

99
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,000
Cut the crap.

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,680
All right.

101
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,680
I'll tell you what Hui Ba and I did.

102
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,950
I gave him my number to each other.

103
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,920
And told him that I'm in the antiques business.

104
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:10,480
If he has anything precious, just call me.

105
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,870
That's all that I did.

106
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,040
We have known each other for many years.

107
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,390
Can you give me some self-respect?

108
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,600
But you scold me. Listen.

109
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,600
If you don't give me an explanation today,

110
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,750
I'm stuck here.

111
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,950
I'll stay here and freeze to death.

112
00:07:23,950 --> 00:07:25,480
I mean it!

113
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,240
All right, get up.

114
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,000
You're acting like a child.

115
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,510
No way.

116
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:34,560
I just sit here.

117
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:37,070
I'm so aggrieved.

118
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,310
What did I do?

119
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,720
And how can you treat me like that?

120
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,360
Are you up or not?

121
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,120
No.

122
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:45,560
I just sit here.

123
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,270
What did I do?

124
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:48,870
Why do you treat me like that?

125
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,390
Fine. I leave you alone.

126
00:07:51,950 --> 00:07:53,160
Go ahead.

127
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,480
What's this?

128
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,270
Oh my god!

129
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,480
Dong!

130
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:06,360
Help!

131
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,830
Fatty Tang!

132
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:10,830
Dong!

133
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:11,600
Help me!

134
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:16,870
Help!

135
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:20,310
Fatty Tang!

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:21,870
Fatty Tang.

137
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:22,830
What happened?

138
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,310
Dong.

139
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:26,390
This place is haunted!

140
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:28,160
I don't know what dragged me away.

141
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,160
Dong, let's get out of here.

142
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,040
We can't stay here.

143
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,830
Dong, we should leave now.

144
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:32,150
Let's go.

145
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:32,600
We can't stay here.

146
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,750
Keep your feet off the ground.

147
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,440
There is a ghost here!

148
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:37,150
We can't put our feet on the ground.

149
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,240
Ghost!

150
00:08:38,670 --> 00:08:39,390
Fatty Tang.

151
00:08:39,390 --> 00:08:40,320
There is a ghost!

152
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,360
Keep your feet off the ground.

153
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:43,550
It's fine.

154
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,440
Keep your feet off the ground.

155
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,120
Fatty Tang.

156
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:46,910
Fatty Tang.

157
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:48,750
There is a ghost!

158
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,390
Keep your feet off the ground.

159
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:49,960
What's wrong with him?

160
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,360
Keep your hands and feet off the ground.

161
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,120
-Keep your hand off the ground.
-Fatty Tang.

162
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:54,960
Fatty Tang.

163
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,000
Keep your hand off the ground.

164
00:08:58,440 --> 00:08:59,240
Fatty Tang.

165
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:01,960
Listen.

166
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,440
Answer me if you hear me clearly.

167
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,150
Just now you were sitting on the ground talking,

168
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,870
what was pushing you, tugging you?

169
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Tugging...

170
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:15,270
Yes.

171
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:15,910
I was tugged!

172
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:16,910
Who did that?

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,480
It was so fast.

174
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,670
I couldn't see much.

175
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,200
Really.

176
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,000
Did he meet the ghost?

177
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,870
I really couldn't see clearly.

178
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:30,550
Well, what do you feel was tugging at you?

179
00:09:30,550 --> 00:09:32,200
Hand or rope?

180
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:33,720
Dong.

181
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:36,440
Dong, help!

182
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,150
I don't know.

183
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,840
I have no idea.

184
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:41,240
Where is he tugging at you?

185
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:42,840
I am asking you!

186
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:44,670
My feet!

187
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,390
He tugged at my feet!

188
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,080
My feet.

189
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,790
Do you tell the truth?

190
00:09:56,790 --> 00:09:57,550
Yes.

191
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
I was with him just now.

192
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,120
I saw it.

193
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:06,750
Dong.

194
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,240
It's dangerous!

195
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,480
We can't stay here.

196
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,550
This place is so evil.

197
00:10:10,550 --> 00:10:11,670
We have to get out of here.

198
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:12,840
Get everybody.

199
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Let's leave here.

200
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,270
Dong. We should go!

201
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,720
Buddy.

202
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:19,630
It's inappropriate to pitch a tent

203
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,790
in some place like Hailongdui.

204
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:22,960
The weather is bad these two days.

205
00:10:23,270 --> 00:10:24,200
And

206
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,270
something weird happened.

207
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,000
I'd rather believe it.

208
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:30,270
The country town is a hundred kilometers away.

209
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:32,270
I suggest

210
00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:34,600
that tonight, we can work hard,

211
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,270
and drive two hours more to go back to the country.

212
00:10:37,630 --> 00:10:39,080
It's too much trouble.

213
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,000
We just settled in.

214
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,600
And it will take at least one or two hours
to pull out of the camp.

215
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,720
It's difficult to drive on this dark, dusty day.

216
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,120
We usually drive for two hours,

217
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:53,200
but today we have to run for at least four hours.

218
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,750
By the time we got to the county, it was dawn.

219
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,080
I think

220
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,030
we just ignore everything,

221
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,840
and sleep here tonight.

222
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,870
Yes.

223
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,440
There's nothing evil here.

224
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,910
If there is a ghost,

225
00:11:06,910 --> 00:11:08,480
you would be dead.

226
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
How could he tug at you for fun?

227
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,960
Do not open your eyes
and cover your head with the quilt.

228
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,390
Just sleep it off.

229
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:15,360
Yes.

230
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,870
When you go number one,

231
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:18,550
just use that water bottle.

232
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,550
Such a coward.

233
00:11:20,550 --> 00:11:21,750
All right.

234
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:23,510
Let's have a rest here.

235
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:25,200
Pack up and go to sleep.

236
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:26,550
I'll go to sleep.

237
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:27,750
Let's go to sleep.

238
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:30,910
Dong.

239
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,630
Dong.

240
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:37,320
What should I do?

241
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:41,270
Tonight, you sleep here.

242
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,240
It's crowded and safe.

243
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:46,030
You go back to the county in the morning.

244
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,670
All right. Go get sleep.

245
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,030
I have to go inside.

246
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:52,510
Inside...

247
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,630
So straight.

248
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:26,000
Looks like he was tugging fast and hard.

249
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,870
There's nothing weird about that.

250
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:31,870
What's your opinion?

251
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,390
Don't blame the ghosts.

252
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:35,670
If ghosts could do that,

253
00:12:35,670 --> 00:12:36,910
they'd rule the earth by now.

254
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,840
Judging from the print on his feet,

255
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,600
it looks like a rope.

256
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,320
But the rope can't pull people on its own.

257
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,670
What if a snake did it?

258
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,120
There are pit vipers here.

259
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,000
But they are thin and short.

260
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,510
I mean,

261
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,870
Fatty Tang weighs 150 pounds anyway.

262
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:54,390
That pit viper can't tug him.

263
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,910
Whatever it is.

264
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,630
Maybe I will be the next one to get tugged.

265
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:08,960
If it tugs me,

266
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,670
I probably know what it is.

267
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,910
Last time Fatty Tang was safe

268
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:14,240
because it stopped.

269
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,840
If it doesn't stop this time?

270
00:13:16,150 --> 00:13:17,240
This place is so big,

271
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,670
that no one can find you if you were dragged away.

272
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:20,480
How's your reaction speed?

273
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:22,320
If we were this far apart

274
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,440
and I suddenly flew away,

275
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:24,840
would you hold me right away?

276
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:26,840
Of course.

277
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,790
Well, we should go together.

278
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,720
I'll hold on to you if you get yanked,

279
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
and vice versa.

280
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,000
If we get yanked together,

281
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,550
well, we can take half of it.

282
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:37,270
Do you know what it is?

283
00:13:37,270 --> 00:13:39,480
Are you scared? Stand aside.

284
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:35,870
Are you cold?

285
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,150
Yes.

286
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:48,670
What are you doing?

287
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,720
Keep you out of the wind.

288
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:56,080
If we knew that,

289
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,270
we would have worn thicker clothes.

290
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,960
I wear a lot.

291
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:06,840
I don't think
anything's going to happen again tonight.

292
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,960
What do you think?

293
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,510
Sometimes that's just the way it is.

294
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:13,480
The more things you fear will happen,

295
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:15,390
and the more things
you look forward to will not happen.

296
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,030
Let's go back.

297
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:25,670
Well.

298
00:15:27,840 --> 00:15:29,150
Do you have cold medication in your car?

299
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:31,270
No.

300
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,320
Liuxi.

301
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,030
I put your food in here.

302
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,910
Call me if you need anything.

303
00:16:31,910 --> 00:16:32,720
Thanks.

304
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:34,270
Fatty Tang.

305
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:36,790
Why are you walking with your head hanging down?

306
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:38,240
Why are you so listless?

307
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,390
Dong.

308
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,440
Can we leave today?

309
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:45,960
I can't leave now.

310
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,550
How about this.

311
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,480
I will draw you a map.

312
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,030
All you have to do is follow the ruts

313
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
and the flags, and you're out.

314
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,270
You are safe when you get to the Yi'er Highway.

315
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,630
You are here now.

316
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:04,160
You follow the ruts

317
00:17:04,510 --> 00:17:05,590
and go north.

318
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,880
Then you will watch Yardang landforms.

319
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,310
And you go about a kilometer east

320
00:17:09,310 --> 00:17:11,240
and

321
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,350
you will see the flags.

322
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,880
Then you follow the flags,

323
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,550
go south,

324
00:17:18,070 --> 00:17:18,960
and go east.

325
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,750
Dong, I'm ready to go now.

326
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:28,110
Take care.

327
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:47,640
I'll go out later

328
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,030
and search the area.

329
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:49,960
Are you with me?

330
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,350
That's a bad photo.

331
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:53,920
You don't understand.

332
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,790
Contrast is in fashion now.

333
00:17:57,030 --> 00:17:58,000
That is

334
00:17:58,270 --> 00:17:59,880
a beautiful woman

335
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,880
who sweeps a dirty alley

336
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:04,350
and digs coal in a mine.

337
00:18:04,350 --> 00:18:06,240
You really know it, right?

338
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,270
Aren't you talking about me?

339
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:10,270
I've been in fashion my whole life.

340
00:18:10,270 --> 00:18:12,200
Any one of my pictures is a big trend.

341
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,400
Liuxi is the most beautiful.

342
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,640
Yes.

343
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,750
No one here can compete with you.

344
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,830
So it was a trend that you had to pee that night?

345
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:29,680
Chang Dong, do you know how you'll die in the future?

346
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,070
Can you do palm reading?

347
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:33,920
Yes.

348
00:18:34,310 --> 00:18:35,830
Give me your hands.

349
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,000
You will be killed by me.

350
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,790
Is there any way to fix it?

351
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:09,550
Yes.

352
00:19:09,550 --> 00:19:10,640
Take me to dinner three times a week.

353
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,960
There are no less than three meat dishes.

354
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:13,750
Every month you send me protection money.

355
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:14,680
Bow when you see me.

356
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,830
Kowtow to me on festivals.

357
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,000
It doesn't count if you don't make a sound.

358
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,680
Well, I'd love to die.

359
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,070
Are you done yet?

360
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,350
Yes.

361
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,270
Let's move fast.

362
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,240
Listen.

363
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,070
We will be divided into

364
00:19:29,590 --> 00:19:31,000
four groups

365
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,350
in four directions.

366
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:32,750
Okay.

367
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,400
Take it.

368
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,880
All right.

369
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,000
Listen. Leave the mark.

370
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,640
Or we'll get lost.

371
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,790
You bet.

372
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:40,920
Let's go.

373
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:42,590
Making a fortune

374
00:19:42,590 --> 00:19:44,750
should go ahead regardless.

375
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,000
Okay.

376
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:46,310
Let's go.

377
00:19:46,510 --> 00:19:47,200
Go quick.

378
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:47,830
Hurry up!

379
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:58,880
See.

380
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,510
You can't get away with him.

381
00:20:01,510 --> 00:20:02,720
How many times has this been?

382
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,070
I'd say at least three times.

383
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:05,790
You're never going to get away with him.

384
00:20:05,790 --> 00:20:07,790
Why don't you try and fall in love with him?

385
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,310
Dong.

386
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:13,550
What's going on?

387
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:15,830
Dong.

388
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:16,550
What happened?

389
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:17,070
Dong.

390
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:18,400
There must be a ghost.

391
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:19,400
Something happened!

392
00:20:19,510 --> 00:20:20,640
Dong, it's terrible.

393
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,480
The flags are missing.

394
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:24,960
What?

395
00:20:27,270 --> 00:20:28,270
It's normal.

396
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,590
The wind last night was so strong.

397
00:20:29,590 --> 00:20:30,880
Maybe the flags were pulled up.

398
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,350
It's so strange.

399
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,790
The ruts are missing too.

400
00:20:33,790 --> 00:20:35,400
When I went out,

401
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,160
I was following the ruts.

402
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,830
All of sudden, the ruts turned.

403
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,110
So I just followed.

404
00:20:40,110 --> 00:20:41,200
After a while,

405
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,830
I found

406
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,440
that the ruts were so close to the Yardang.

407
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:45,720
I just went down.

408
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:46,550
I took a look.

409
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,510
Generally speaking,

410
00:20:48,510 --> 00:20:49,440
even if the car is close to there,

411
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,240
it's still a little distance.

412
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:52,310
But no.

413
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,920
I gave myself courage and took a look.

414
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,240
I found

415
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,270
that the ruts

416
00:20:57,270 --> 00:20:59,270
go straight to that Yardang.

417
00:20:59,270 --> 00:21:01,830
It looks like
the car was swallowed by the Yardang.

418
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:04,680
This isn't where we were at all.

419
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,240
There's something in the sand that hurts us.

420
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,960
It's going to carry me away.

421
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,480
Dong.

422
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,750
Get up first.

423
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,400
Fatty Tang, you are fine.

424
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,510
Am I running into a ghost wall?

425
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,350
Dong, am I not allowed to leave here?

426
00:21:16,350 --> 00:21:16,960
Am I going to die here?

427
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
Fatty Tang, have a rest.

428
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:18,750
Fatty Tang.

429
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,200
Have a rest.

430
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,440
I will drive to the place you mentioned.

431
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,680
Dong, it's too horrible.

432
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,440
I am so scared.

433
00:21:27,680 --> 00:21:28,510
I can't stand it here.

434
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,200
Liuxi.

435
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,030
What?

436
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:54,510
I come to apologize.

437
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,640
To be frank,

438
00:21:57,830 --> 00:22:00,350
I wanted to steal your stuff
since the first time you got to the car.

439
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,030
Your Sheep's Head.

440
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,750
I knew it from your Moments,

441
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,480
and you are carrying it.

442
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,440
Later, when we got the Dalpur,

443
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,960
I still wanted to steal it.

444
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,270
I've always had that thought.

445
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:14,440
Liuxi. It's my fault.

446
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:16,070
I shouldn't have thought that.

447
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:17,830
I apologize to you.

448
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:19,590
My apology.

449
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:20,960
I was wrong before.

450
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,550
Cut the crap.

451
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,590
Liuxi.

452
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,030
I want you to help me

453
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,310
get out of here.

454
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:15,680
Hui Ba just came by

455
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:17,350
and said
someone would deliver food to us as usual.

456
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:19,480
Good service.

457
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,350
They get used to it.

458
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:22,590
Well, look who you should thank for.

459
00:23:23,510 --> 00:23:25,310
All right, report what you got today.

460
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:28,070
Nothing.

461
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:30,440
But Fatty Tang was correct.

462
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:33,680
That rutting looks like it's been swallowed.

463
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,680
There is also a strange thing
that he didn't notice.

464
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,720
I drove out of the camp,

465
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,640
like, a mile or so.

466
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:44,270
I noticed that my ruts had suddenly broken.

467
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:45,720
But there are other tracks.

468
00:23:46,550 --> 00:23:49,070
Like the ruts were your dog?

469
00:23:49,070 --> 00:23:49,880
You can recognize them?

470
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:51,640
I modified the tires,

471
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:53,310
so I know all the patterns.

472
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
The rutting broke suddenly.

473
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,720
Not a trace.

474
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,270
Oh right.

475
00:23:58,510 --> 00:24:00,480
I also looked at other ruts.

476
00:24:00,550 --> 00:24:02,590
None of them belong to
any of the vehicles in the camp.

477
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,070
Now we're at Hailongdui.

478
00:24:05,070 --> 00:24:06,640
Or maybe we are not.

479
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:09,550
How is Fatty Tang?

480
00:24:17,750 --> 00:24:19,480
They must gain a lot today.

481
00:24:21,350 --> 00:24:22,310
Hui Ba told you so?

482
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:23,200
I asked him,

483
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,350
but he said they had spent the day in vain.

484
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:26,240
We're back.

485
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,640
They didn't pick up a single stone.

486
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,510
We're back.

487
00:24:29,310 --> 00:24:30,160
Buddies.

488
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:30,750
Oh, we're back.

489
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,310
But you can tell by the way he scolds his men.

490
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,790
If he gained nothing,

491
00:24:35,110 --> 00:24:37,640
his cursing could be heard throughout the camp.

492
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,830
Today, he doesn't get angry,

493
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:41,350
instead, he is in a good mood.

494
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,350
I finally eat the meat.

495
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:45,880
We don't have to worry about them

496
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:47,680
if they find the rare stones.

497
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,200
In case they found something strange...

498
00:24:50,830 --> 00:24:52,550
I can't help it if he doesn't tell me.

499
00:24:53,590 --> 00:24:55,400
How about I pull him out tonight

500
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,590
and beat him into admitting it?

501
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:01,110
Well, I kind of get it.

502
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,830
Whatever is going on with you,

503
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:04,720
you can just fight it out.

504
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:15,110
Liuxi, I can't die here.

505
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:15,680
You have to protect me.

506
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,030
You want me to keep you alive?

507
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:19,680
So what can I get in turn?

508
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:22,750
Liuxi, I will be at your service all my life.

509
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:24,070
Starting today,

510
00:25:24,070 --> 00:25:25,640
I will follow your lead.

511
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,550
I'll do whatever you want me to do.

512
00:25:27,550 --> 00:25:27,920
Liuxi.

513
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,400
There are so many of them who are afraid of you.

514
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,830
You must be better than them.

515
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:32,920
I don't know what you're capable of,

516
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:35,070
but my life depends on you.

517
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,350
I beg you that take me away.

518
00:25:36,350 --> 00:25:37,830
I don't want to die here, Liuxi.

519
00:25:37,830 --> 00:25:38,750
I'm begging you.

520
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,550
Liuxi, please promise me.

521
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:40,400
Fatty Tang.

522
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,200
I pray you.

523
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,510
Let me tell you.

524
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:47,550
You see, there are many people here.

525
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,720
If I had to pick one to take out,

526
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,550
I'd pick Chang Dong.

527
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,550
Not because of our friendship,

528
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,720
but because he's the most useful.

529
00:25:57,510 --> 00:25:59,880
If I only have a 70% chance of survival,

530
00:25:59,880 --> 00:26:02,830
then with him, I have a 90% chance.

531
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,240
Do you understand?

532
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:06,240
Yes.

533
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,000
I understand.

534
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,590
I think something's going to happen here, too.

535
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,400
Maybe the first one to die

536
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,510
is you.

537
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,240
Liuxi, I must be the first one!

538
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,110
I mean it.

539
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:29,480
You can't let me die.

540
00:26:29,550 --> 00:26:31,270
Well, there is still hope.

541
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:36,440
To break through the pack,

542
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:39,830
you have to be tougher than the wolves.

543
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,920
You want to be alive,

544
00:26:42,110 --> 00:26:44,790
so you have to spare no effort to arm yourself.

545
00:26:45,790 --> 00:26:46,790
Until then,

546
00:26:47,350 --> 00:26:49,480
you don't have to beg me.

547
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,400
Maybe I'll have to find a way

548
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:53,030
to win you over.

549
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:17,880
Suit himself.

550
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,350
Fatty Tang.

551
00:27:19,270 --> 00:27:20,640
Every man has his own fate.

552
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:29,960
What are you doing?

553
00:27:30,510 --> 00:27:31,680
I am asking you.

554
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:35,030
It pisses me off to see you like this.

555
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,240
How dare you hang around here?

556
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,790
You are such a  coward.

557
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:39,110
Get out of here.

558
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,590
Didn't you hear me?

559
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,640
Go ahead.

560
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:46,720
What?

561
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,440
Why so much nonsense?

562
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:48,310
I don't want to see you.

563
00:27:48,830 --> 00:27:50,920
Did I bring you here?

564
00:27:51,070 --> 00:27:51,880
Yes, so what?

565
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:53,720
I just opened a junk shop.

566
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:55,640
Does it help if I'm brave?

567
00:27:55,790 --> 00:27:57,590
I can identify the antiques.

568
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,440
Just grab one of those things.

569
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:01,400
I'll tell you which dynasty it's from in a minute,

570
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:03,440
and how much it's worth. Can you do that?

571
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,750
Look at you showing off.

572
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:07,790
Send him in.

573
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,750
I have some questions.

574
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,270
Go inside. The boss wants to see you.

575
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:17,200
Silly, I didn't know you had this kind of skill.

576
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,480
Are you done yet? Hurry up!

577
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:58,310
And you guys!

578
00:28:58,310 --> 00:28:59,640
Get back and pack. Get out of here.

579
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,960
What are you doing here? Hurry up!

580
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:05,510
Be quick.

581
00:29:08,590 --> 00:29:09,960
Hold it!

582
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,920
Bro, it's right up ahead.

583
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:50,960
Okay.

584
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,310
Make a mark.

585
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,590
Let's go.

586
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,270
Okay.

587
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,160
Let's leave here.

588
00:30:00,310 --> 00:30:01,240
Okay.

589
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,830
The longer poison sting of a scorpion
would look better.

590
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,350
You do it for me.

591
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:37,830
Okay.

592
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:47,790
Dong.

593
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,200
Liuxi.

594
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,270
Hui Ba and his men dug a coffin.

595
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,400
Coffin?

596
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:55,550
It's not exactly a dig.

597
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:57,510
Huo Ya fought with the people.

598
00:30:57,510 --> 00:30:59,200
They took shovels, slashed at each other,

599
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,680
and cut a hole in the Yardang.

600
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,750
I've wanted to punch you for a long time.

601
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:04,720
Have a try?

602
00:31:04,750 --> 00:31:05,310
Come on!

603
00:31:05,310 --> 00:31:06,110
How dare you!

604
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:06,680
That's enough.

605
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,110
You two are never done, are you?

606
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,510
Stop fighting.

607
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:20,480
Calm down.

608
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:21,480
When they looked,

609
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,590
it was a dark coffin.

610
00:31:24,030 --> 00:31:26,960
Then they took a picture and showed it to me.

611
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,920
Let me identify which dynasty this belongs to.

612
00:31:30,510 --> 00:31:33,160
I Bluetooth it to my phone.

613
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,590
It looks like a Han Dynasty picture brick.

614
00:31:47,550 --> 00:31:49,750
Didn't you eat? Push a little harder!

615
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,590
Stop now.

616
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:57,400
Get up!

617
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:05,550
There is a painting.

618
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:07,720
The painting is art.

619
00:32:07,830 --> 00:32:08,590
It is worth a lot.

620
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:09,030
Bro.

621
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:09,790
We will be rich!

622
00:32:09,790 --> 00:32:11,030
Dig it!

623
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:11,400
Use your hands!

624
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,350
Go for it!

625
00:32:18,790 --> 00:32:19,960
Be quick.

626
00:32:20,270 --> 00:32:29,030
One, two, pull!

627
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:29,400
One...

628
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,440
Wait a second. Stop now.

629
00:32:41,816 --> 00:32:46,530
