=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:43,820
=Episode 14=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,220
So? Have you decided?

4
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,700
Are you guys going to the market with me

5
00:01:55,700 --> 00:01:57,180
or are you going straight out
of the pass?

6
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:58,300
Liuxi.

7
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,460
With just the few of us,

8
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,860
it will be equivalent to suicide

9
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:02,060
when we go back
and cross the Flowing Sand Yardang.

10
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:04,500
Besides, we don't even know
how to get out.

11
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,540
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

12
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,540
He and the others
talked about so many real cases.

13
00:02:08,540 --> 00:02:10,460
Since the market is safer
with more people,

14
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:12,260
why not go there first
to gather information

15
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:13,140
and replenish supplies?

16
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:15,100
We can make a decision by then.

17
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,020
I think that's a good idea.

18
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,620
After going to such great lengths
to get here,

19
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,980
we can't just return empty-handed.

20
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:19,620
In my opinion,

21
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,740
we should explore every stall
in the market one by one.

22
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,660
If there are really many old things
in the pass,

23
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,300
we can find some with collectible value.

24
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,020
We might be able to come here often
in the future.

25
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,780
We can exchange the new for the old,

26
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,700
resell them,

27
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,740
and we'll make a killing.

28
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,100
I have a way to sell them.

29
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:32,820
We can start a company

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,460
and make a fortune quietly.

31
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,340
You seem pretty excited.

32
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,300
Aren't you afraid
of the sand monsters anymore?

33
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:49,260
Liuxi, there's a saying,

34
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,260
"Fortune favors the brave,

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,940
but punishes the timid". Right, Dong?

36
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:02,900
I'll go with you guys.

37
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:11,340
He.

38
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:12,980
He.

39
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:13,860
What are you looking at?

40
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,780
Hurry and eat.

41
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:26,420
If you're not busy,

42
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,020
go inside and get some fabric.

43
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:29,060
We can use it for patching tires later.

44
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,300
Alright.

45
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,580
Liuxi.

46
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,100
Dong.

47
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:42,900
Did you already know Chang Dong
before this?

48
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,660
Yes.

49
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,260
Was he popular

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:46,460
with people before?

51
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,700
Not at all.

52
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,980
He doesn't even look at me properly.

53
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,420
Liuxi, let me tell you.

54
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,460
He used to be amazing.

55
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:54,660
He guided many exploration
and research teams from many countries

56
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:56,060
and made a fortune.

57
00:03:56,060 --> 00:03:57,340
I knew a few bosses

58
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,340
who wanted Dong to take them
to the no man's land for a spin.

59
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,540
The money was right in front of him,

60
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,820
but he still refused to go.

61
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,500
Everyone in this circle knew

62
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,620
that he used to be so impressive.

63
00:04:03,860 --> 00:04:04,980
They even gave him a nickname.

64
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,420
Sand Fang.

65
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,500
What do you think of this nickname?

66
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,740
Doesn't it sound infuriating?

67
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:11,500
But he's not like that anymore.

68
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,180
He has

69
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:14,500
completely changed.

70
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,020
All because of the Camellia incident.

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,500
He now looks like a different person.

72
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,260
Last time,

73
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,340
I used to pay my respects to him
when I saw him,

74
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,420
but behind his back, I would curse...

75
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:23,620
Okay, enough.

76
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,380
Leave.

77
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,380
Liuxi.

78
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:42,940
He

79
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:44,300
wants me to ask you.

80
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,300
What's with

81
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,020
the point deduction?

82
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,540
Oh, the points deduction.

83
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,820
If I'm not mistaken,

84
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,580
Old Qian lost 39 points,

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,540
He lost 24,

86
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:55,900
and Fries lost 12 points.

87
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:57,940
Liu.

88
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,340
Go and call Gao Shen.

89
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:00,620
Separate Old Qian and the others.

90
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,860
Make them draw a map

91
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,100
from here to the market one-on-one.

92
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:03,780
Include

93
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:05,300
how long it takes

94
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,380
and what to watch out for.

95
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,540
Make them list it all out.

96
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,580
The more detailed,

97
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,700
the more points they get.

98
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,860
Okay.

99
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:11,700
Since we're talking about points,

100
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,420
of course, the higher the points,
the safer they'll be.

101
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,140
Why not let the three of them
draw it together?

102
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,420
It'll be easier.

103
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:18,260
Liu.

104
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,100
Tell him.

105
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,980
If let the three of them work together

106
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,900
to create a fake map

107
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:25,580
and lead us to the Flowing Sand Yardang,

108
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,100
we will be done for then.

109
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,500
We can't let them communicate.

110
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,580
We must keep them separated,

111
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,620
make them suspect

112
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,900
and compete with each other.

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,420
My mind is really...

114
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:37,900
Gao Shen.

115
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,060
We have something to do.

116
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:44,620
These three maps

117
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,540
have minor differences.

118
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,980
I'll tidy them up.

119
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,060
We can leave soon.

120
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,620
Dong.

121
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,700
To the west,

122
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,740
there's the market
where He and the others used to live,

123
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:52,860
Yellow Soil City.

124
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:53,700
He said

125
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,020
they originally left Yellow Soil City

126
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,460
(Yellow Soil City, Red Flower Tree)
to escape a disaster,

127
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:57,860
and it took them about ten days on foot.

128
00:05:58,060 --> 00:05:59,020
If we drive,

129
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,260
we should be able to reach there sooner.

130
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,300
Normally,

131
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,820
(Red Flower Tree, Red Brick City)
this journey takes about a day.

132
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,060
But our tires won't hold up.

133
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:06,660
I estimate it will take at least
two days.

134
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,900
Between markets, it's quite desolate.

135
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,140
The people here seem to believe

136
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,500
that outside the market and at night,

137
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,740
exotic beasts will appear.

138
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,700
So, we need to find a place to stay

139
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:17,980
before sunset.

140
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Sounds like
something out of a ghost story.

141
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,820
Once the sun sets,

142
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,020
we won't be able to find the inn.

143
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,940
Their inns here
are called "Red Flower Tree".

144
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,500
"Red Flower Tree"?

145
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,180
Is it a franchise?

146
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,260
The tree itself is fake,

147
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,740
but there are red fabric strips
hanging from the branches.

148
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,740
(Red)
If we see a tree like that,

149
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:33,020
we can wait under it.

150
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,220
Before the sun sets,
someone will come to collect the tree

151
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,660
and they'll also take the guests.

152
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,580
What if

153
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,780
we don't catch the tree collection
in time?

154
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:40,660
Then we'll become targets

155
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,180
for the exotic beasts.

156
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,820
Exciting.

157
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,140
Don't you think those who dare
operate the Red Flower Tree on the road

158
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,220
are all capable people?

159
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,940
In places like this,

160
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,900
they will definitely have one or two
capable people to take charge.

161
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,500
But don't have
too high expectations either.

162
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,740
Absolute safety

163
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,820
is something no one can guarantee.

164
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:55,340
We might encounter a shady business.

165
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:57,020
But we don't have gold leaf.

166
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:59,180
What if our phones have no signal
and we can't pay?

167
00:06:59,180 --> 00:06:59,980
They said

168
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,820
that if we go there,

169
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,460
we can exchange items for accommodation.

170
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,580
We brought so many stuff with us.

171
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:04,340
That should be enough.

172
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:07,660
Alright.

173
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:08,460
That's about it.

174
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,420
Let's gather our things.

175
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:10,860
Our things

176
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:11,940
and the things in the cellar.

177
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:12,740
Liuxi.

178
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:14,220
Do we need to take

179
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,660
all of their stuff in the cellar?

180
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:16,300
Of course not.

181
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,580
Only useful items.

182
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,340
What will they do then?

183
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:20,940
How did we manage

184
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:22,180
when we were outside the cellar?

185
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,700
We were self-reliant, weren't we?

186
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,420
Share this word with them.

187
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:43,900
Careful.

188
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:44,380
Okay.

189
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,660
Dong.

190
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:09,140
Can you discuss with Liuxi

191
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,980
to not take everything?

192
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,500
They have an elderly and a child here.

193
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,140
What will they do without food?

194
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,140
She told you to

195
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,420
take everything?

196
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,060
Alright.

197
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,540
Let me rephrase that.

198
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,340
When you're moving things,

199
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,140
Liuxi

200
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,620
isn't watching over you anyway.

201
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,220
If you miss anything,

202
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,380
nobody will know.

203
00:08:36,660 --> 00:08:37,460
So you're saying...

204
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,780
I didn't say anything.

205
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:44,420
Fatty Tang.

206
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:46,900
And also,

207
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,900
there's just that little bit
of supplies.

208
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,260
They can't last much longer.

209
00:08:49,260 --> 00:08:50,460
The word from Liuxi,

210
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,620
"Self-reliance",

211
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,620
share that with them.

212
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:58,940
Come with me.

213
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,260
Hurry up and come in.

214
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:07,220
Fatty Tang is too soft-hearted.

215
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:08,660
Isn't being soft-hearted

216
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,340
a fortunate thing?

217
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:11,700
What do you mean?

218
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,660
Few people

219
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,020
have a naturally compassionate heart.

220
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,380
Most people,

221
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,740
when starving to death,

222
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,380
won't share a mouthful of food with you.

223
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,420
When humiliated or bullied,

224
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,700
the first reaction is
to retaliate with blood.

225
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,900
Only when receiving love,

226
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,820
do they think about sharing it.

227
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,740
If Fatty Tang can be soft-hearted,

228
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:31,260
it means he's been treated kindly

229
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,460
in some way.

230
00:10:32,460 --> 00:10:33,940
That seems to be the case.

231
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,020
These are the things we left for you.

232
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,540
We're leaving soon.

233
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:45,100
I want to say something to you.

234
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,580
Living like this isn't a solution.

235
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:47,820
You can't escape disasters forever.

236
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,140
Learn to become strong on your own.

237
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,340
You need to live peacefully
with disasters, understand?

238
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,660
Hurry, take the things down quickly.

239
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:53,220
Quick.

240
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,740
Thank you.

241
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,140
Hurry up.

242
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,620
Fatty Tang.

243
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:01,980
We're leaving.

244
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,820
I'm coming.

245
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,380
Quick, hold these.

246
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,900
Take care of yourselves.

247
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:29,620
Old Shen

248
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:31,260
Where did they go?

249
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,580
How can there be so many exotic beasts?

250
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,140
Is it two different worlds?

251
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:40,060
Didn't I just say that?

252
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,900
That's just a story.

253
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:43,420
It's all made up.

254
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,420
Fictional.

255
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,420
Those exotic beast from inside the pass

256
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:49,340
are just like the animals here.

257
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
You can think of them

258
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,060
as material for creativity

259
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,660
or sources of inspiration.

260
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,700
Although it's a story,

261
00:11:58,700 --> 00:12:00,100
I always feel like there are

262
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,940
many things in this world

263
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:04,380
that can't be explained or touched.

264
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:04,900
Yeah.

265
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,700
It's like Land of Peach Blossoms.

266
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:12,220
It's filled with mystery
and imagination in there.

267
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:13,940
You can't even explain it all.

268
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,980
The Bone of Liuxi.

269
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:26,420
The Soul of Wangdong.

270
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:29,420
Life and death destiny.

271
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:30,300
Connections between two worlds.

272
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:31,740
This story

273
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:32,660
is kind of interesting.

274
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,700
Why no red flower trees?

275
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:33,060
That's right.
We haven't spotted one on this journey.

276
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,180
Is Old Qian tricking us?

277
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:37,500
This place has no landmarks at all.

278
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,980
It's really hard
to walk in a straight line here.

279
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,180
If the wheels just veer slightly,

280
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,580
we might end up going
in the wrong direction forever.

281
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,740
We've got some experience
dealing with the sand monsters.

282
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,700
But what if we
encounter some other kind of monster?

283
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,780
What do we do then?

284
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:53,060
Liuxi.

285
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:55,820
Old Qian said there are exotic beasts
in the desert at night.

286
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,180
Shouldn't we be armed and ready?

287
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,780
Better than empty-handed, right?

288
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,020
Fatty Tang.

289
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,020
You should grab a weapon too.

290
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,580
Give me one.

291
00:14:01,660 --> 00:14:02,820
We're running low on bullets.

292
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,660
This gun's nearly scrap metal.

293
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,500
Look.

294
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,180
It looks like a lantern.

295
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:14,140
I heard about this when I was a kid.

296
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:16,540
When it's pitch black outside,

297
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:18,860
if there are two lights in the sky

298
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:20,220
and a long ladder,

299
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,420
it's actually a snake's two eyes.

300
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,140
You see that long ladder?
It's a snake's tongue.

301
00:14:24,460 --> 00:14:25,740
If you climb up,
you'll get eaten by the snake.

302
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,420
Dong.

303
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,140
I think it looks like a mouth.

304
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,300
We should take it slow.

305
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,780
I've never seen

306
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:34,140
a mouth that glows like that.

307
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,580
Look at that person.

308
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:01,740
What's hanging from his waist?

309
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,540
A rooster.

310
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:36,060
Are you going to stay at the inn too?

311
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:36,940
Yeah.

312
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:38,340
Where are you folks coming from?

313
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,340
Red Brick City

314
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:40,980
It's a good place.

315
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,260
What should I call you?

316
00:15:42,260 --> 00:15:43,060
Chang Dong.

317
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,900
I'm Li Jin'ao.

318
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,660
Your rooster's quite impressive.

319
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,700
Not a single grain of rice
spilled on the ground.

320
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,780
This rooster of mine

321
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,260
is not just an ordinary rooster.

322
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:56,980
Are you guys traveling at night

323
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,700
without bringing a rooster
for some extra courage?

324
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,860
We were in a hurry

325
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,740
and didn't have time for that.

326
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,220
People driving the metallic van

327
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,940
are not interested in this.

328
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:08,860
Hey there, Ao.

329
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,260
You can call me Liu.

330
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,420
You're really something.

331
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,740
You've got some serious guts.

332
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:14,380
I've never stayed
in a place like this before.

333
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,540
Dong always scared me.

334
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:17,220
He said the inn is super creepy.

335
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,780
He's right.

336
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,140
Red Flower Tree Club

337
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,420
can get pretty rowdy.

338
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,700
Humans are staying here.

339
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,660
Others are also staying here.

340
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:26,540
How can this be okay?

341
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:28,140
What if something goes wrong?

342
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,180
Dong, why didn't you tell me earlier?

343
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,660
You know I'm a bit of a scaredy-cat.

344
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,380
It's not like it's news to you.

345
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,380
No worries.

346
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,380
Just stick to the rules.

347
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,620
Actually,

348
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,060
it's not as bizarre as they say.

349
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,220
It's not that spooky.

350
00:16:40,460 --> 00:16:41,220
Besides,

351
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,420
everyone staying here

352
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,100
is no pushover.

353
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:44,860
Ao.

354
00:16:44,860 --> 00:16:46,580
You're really good
at boosting yourself up.

355
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,940
Our whole crew here

356
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:50,140
need all our courage
just to walk at night.

357
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:52,780
With that rooster tied to your waist,

358
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,060
it looks like you're sunbathing.

359
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,100
Ao, you must be really something.

360
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,780
Something like what?

361
00:16:58,780 --> 00:16:59,580
I'm

362
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,580
just a market performer
with shadow puppets.

363
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,260
Once I settle in here,

364
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,300
I'll have to put on a few shows.

365
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,500
Everyone.

366
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,980
If you all are free,

367
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,940
come check it out.

368
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:09,060
Sure.

369
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:11,740
It's about time.

370
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
I should start collecting the tree.

371
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,500
Just follow along.

372
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:14,780
What's this called again?

373
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,740
I remember someone told me about it.

374
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:17,620
I just forgot.

375
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:18,420
Oh, my memory.

376
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,940
What's it called?

377
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,020
Flowing Light.

378
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:22,500
Yes, that's it.

379
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,940
On a late night like this,

380
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:26,180
people in the inn
won't dare to wander around.

381
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,460
They'd let Flowing Light lead the way.

382
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,300
This thing

383
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,260
is clumsy.

384
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,900
Always in a straight line.

385
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,260
Never waits for anyone.

386
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,540
Did you see that?

387
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:40,140
This is how it works.

388
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:41,380
Follow along.

389
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,340
Alright.

390
00:17:44,140 --> 00:17:46,220
Not bad, Liu.

391
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,700
You've got quite the gift of gab.

392
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,340
Qi taught me that.

393
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,020
A young girl without inhibitions

394
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:52,740
makes people find you cute.

395
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,380
But if you overdo it,

396
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,660
people will become suspicious.

397
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,500
Dong.

398
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:59,140
That Li guy mentioned
he's a shadow puppeteer.

399
00:17:59,140 --> 00:17:59,940
Who would believe that?

400
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,940
Didn't he say
he has a show tonight?

401
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:02,740
We'll find out

402
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,620
when the time comes.

403
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,380
This way.

404
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:24,940
Metallic van?

405
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:26,380
Thanks.

406
00:18:26,380 --> 00:18:26,940
Appreciate it.

407
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:28,060
Is this your car?

408
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:28,860
No.

409
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,540
The car's entrance is over there.

410
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,100
Where?

411
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,220
Over here.

412
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,740
Right here.

413
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:43,620
Cars over here.

414
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:08,180
Esteemed guests.

415
00:19:08,180 --> 00:19:09,220
(Red Flower Tree Club)
Please park your car here.

416
00:19:09,380 --> 00:19:10,820
I'll wait inside.

417
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,460
Then, we can check in at the front desk.

418
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:13,620
Alright.

419
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:14,820
Let's unload the luggage first.

420
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,700
Wow, such a nice car.

421
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,340
Put this on.

422
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:25,500
Who knows if you have

423
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,620
any arch-enemies

424
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:27,580
waiting for you inside the pass?

425
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,220
Watch your step.

426
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,460
Enjoy your meal, everyone.

427
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,220
If you need anything else,
please let us know.

428
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,140
If you need anything, just tell me.

429
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,180
Guests.

430
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,180
Watch your step.

431
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:50,700
Please, sit over here.

432
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:51,380
Come on.

433
00:19:59,140 --> 00:19:59,940
Hello.

434
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,300
I'd like a room, please.

435
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:03,700
You can pay for the room with gold leaf

436
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:04,860
or exchange with something else.

437
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,060
This list

438
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,700
are listed with things
we're interested in.

439
00:20:07,700 --> 00:20:09,220
You can also barter with goods.

440
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,700
It feels like the primitive world here.

441
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:14,220
Our store has a permit
from Black Stone City.

442
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:15,460
Do you have a problem with that?

443
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:16,860
No.

444
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:18,460
Electricity is supplied until 11:00 p.m.

445
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,940
After 11:00 p.m.,

446
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,900
please refrain from
walking around in public areas.

447
00:20:21,980 --> 00:20:23,420
Otherwise, if anything happens,

448
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,060
you're responsible for your injuries.
We won't be held accountable.

449
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,260
The bathroom and restroom

450
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,300
are both on the first floor.

451
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:31,500
Dry batteries,
disinfectant water, and pliers.

452
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,620
Is that enough?

453
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,900
It's almost enough for accommodation.

454
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,940
As for how the exchange works,

455
00:20:36,180 --> 00:20:36,940
we'll settle this once you check out.

456
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:42,740
Where is the room?

457
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,140
On the second floor.

458
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:58,140
(Room 212)

459
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,900
Today, we'll stay together.

460
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,780
It's safer that way.

461
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,460
If there aren't enough beds,
we can sleep on the floor.

462
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:03,100
Sounds good.

463
00:21:03,100 --> 00:21:04,220
It's safer to stay together.

464
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:06,420
Yeah, sleeping on the floor is fine.

465
00:21:06,420 --> 00:21:08,020
We're not the delicate type anyway.

466
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:09,780
Let's put our stuff away and go eat.

467
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:11,060
Didn't they say the power would be cut off later?

468
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:13,460
To think the outside world
can't survive a year without power.

469
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,820
Look at their attire.

470
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,860
Times are different on both sides.

471
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:19,900
Let's tidy up and go eat.

472
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:24,780
Boss.

473
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:28,540
Look at how good your business is here.

474
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:29,500
How about it?

475
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Why don't you spend a little money

476
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:32,140
to invite me for a performance?

477
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,100
Let me tell you.

478
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,220
As soon as my performance starts,

479
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:35,020
I can elevate this atmosphere of yours

480
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:37,300
with a snap.

481
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,220
Don't bother me.

482
00:21:38,820 --> 00:21:39,980
It won't cost much.

483
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,660
These people look just like
Old Qian and the others.

484
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:46,180
Can we get any useful information
from them?

485
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,300
Take a look at this bowl.

486
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,580
It's too ordinary.

487
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,820
I thought there were antiques everywhere
beyond the pass.

488
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:53,540
Liuxi.

489
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,420
Aren't you going to take off
your mask and eat?

490
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:02,740
Impressive.

491
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,020
There aren't many customers anyway.

492
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,300
Why should I invite you
to perform shadow puppetry?

493
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:07,060
Can't you see how full this place is?

494
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,380
There's only one empty table.

495
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:09,940
This place is full.

496
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,100
There aren't many tables.

497
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,380
People like you
are already getting special treatment.

498
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,020
Consider yourselves lucky
to stay here for free.

499
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,060
I'll do it.

500
00:22:16,060 --> 00:22:17,540
What kind of world is it now?

501
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:19,780
To have people offering things
to invite you to perform.

502
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:20,860
If customers are willing to pay,

503
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:21,620
that's their business.

504
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,100
I don't care.

505
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:22,500
I...

506
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:23,420
Did you hear that?

507
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:25,460
People like this.

508
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,500
Who are they?

509
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,020
To receive special treatment

510
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:28,980
and stay for free.

511
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,340
Let's invite him to perform.

512
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:31,100
No.

513
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:33,020
Dong can do it.

514
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:35,500
Our resources are indeed abundant.

515
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:36,900
However, we shouldn't waste them.

516
00:22:36,940 --> 00:22:38,540
If Liuxi wants to watch, then let her be.

517
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,580
Why are you being stingy?

518
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,700
It's on me.

519
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,420
The first time I've seen
someone better at flattery than me.

520
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,420
Ao.

521
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:46,900
Here.

522
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,100
I'm coming.

523
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,260
Take a seat.

524
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:57,020
I'm really worried
I won't be able to perform.

525
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,140
Thank you.

526
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,260
Come on.

527
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,700
Choose a play.

528
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:01,860
See for yourself.

529
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,180
Which show do you want to watch?

530
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,020
Summoning Spirits?

531
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,860
This is where shadow puppetry began.

532
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,620
Hence,

533
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:09,100
it's always the first play
in the repertoire.

534
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,340
Let's watch this one.

535
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:11,300
No problem.

536
00:23:21,980 --> 00:23:23,180
Come on,

537
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,420
little fellows.

538
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,980
Get ready to work.

539
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:37,900
Nice.

540
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:44,580
(Those things that are riding the camels
are shadow puppets.)

541
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,420
(Yet, there are no sight of the poles.)

542
00:23:47,900 --> 00:23:48,820
(No one is controlling the strings.)

543
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,740
It's gnat.

544
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,940
(The ghost fire can transform.)

545
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,220
(It's more like gnats.)

546
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,260
(It's a common type of insect
in this area.)

547
00:24:03,500 --> 00:24:04,940
(Do you think it's possible that)

548
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:06,860
(it flew here from the pass?)

549
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,980
Everyone.

550
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:16,780
We're officially starting the show now.

551
00:24:16,820 --> 00:24:18,580
Just these three items will do?

552
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:21,540
That's enough.

553
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,020
My musical instrument
can replace an entire troupe.

554
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,540
Everyone, pay attention.

555
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,140
Liu.

556
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,860
Add some more dishes
for him in a while.

557
00:24:53,140 --> 00:24:53,940
Get some alcohol.

558
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:55,860
Get him drunk.

559
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:56,980
Get information from him.

560
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,860
He knows something.

561
00:24:59,140 --> 00:24:59,940
Understood.

562
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:18,860
(Red Flower Tree, No. 37)

563
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,180
Ao.

564
00:25:22,180 --> 00:25:23,980
Your shadow puppetry is impressive.

565
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:25,500
Do you want a drink?

566
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:27,380
Thank you.

567
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:29,140
Thank you all for watching.

568
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:30,260
A toast to everyone.

569
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,060
Come on, Ao.

570
00:25:32,060 --> 00:25:32,940
Eat more.

571
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,740
This dish is delicious.

572
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,980
I want to eat this too.

573
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:38,140
Don't just eat, Ao.

574
00:25:38,140 --> 00:25:39,300
Have a drink. Bottoms up.

575
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:39,900
Okay?

576
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,780
Here, I'll have one with you.

577
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:42,100
Alright.

578
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,500
Here.

579
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,220
I've seen a lot of shadow puppetry.

580
00:25:47,780 --> 00:25:49,140
However, this is the first time

581
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,140
I've seen such good performance.

582
00:25:50,140 --> 00:25:51,220
The one you're talking about

583
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,220
are string-controlled puppets.

584
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:54,100
That kind of puppetry

585
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,540
can only move at the joints.

586
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,100
It's stiff.

587
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:59,380
There are so many performers who do that.

588
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:01,180
You can often see them in the market.

589
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:02,580
They're not skilled.

590
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,180
They're not skilled at all.

591
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,860
Come on, Ao.

592
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,460
Let's fill up your cup.

593
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:10,900
Let's talk about
the story of Summoning Souls.

594
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:15,460
Summoning Souls has a history.

595
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:16,860
It's said that we're not originally

596
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:18,740
from here.

597
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,380
In ancient times, a great general

598
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:25,020
who missed his deceased wife

599
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:27,100
sought the advice of a certain sorcerer

600
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,860
who said there was a method

601
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:32,100
to let the general see his wife again.

602
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:36,100
So, behind a curtain,
the spirit of the wife was summoned.

603
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,020
The general,
unable to contain his longing,

604
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:39,980
lifted the curtain,

605
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,580
wanting to be reunited with his wife.

606
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,460
The sorcerer was shocked.

607
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,780
He tried to stop the general.

608
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,820
However,

609
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:48,540
the general reached out

610
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:50,220
only to find that what he held in his hand

611
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,700
were gnats that formed a shadow puppet.

612
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,820
The general watched as his wife

613
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:56,860
transformed into countless dots of light.

614
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:57,900
He became extremely angry.

615
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,140
Later, the general discovered

616
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,700
the origin of gnats and the sorcerer's strange arts

617
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:06,260
to be from a mysterious desert.

618
00:27:06,420 --> 00:27:08,020
He feared that the sorcerers

619
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:10,060
possessed more esoteric knowledge

620
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,020
that could undermine his rule.

621
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:14,220
So, he imprisoned
the sorcerers and their families,

622
00:27:14,220 --> 00:27:15,500
exotic beasts, arts,

623
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:18,580
as well as the Feather Guards
responsible for their transport.

624
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:22,180
They were all sealed
within that mystical space.

625
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:23,540
They were cut off from the world.

626
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:28,380
This is the origin of the Yumen Pass.

627
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,100
We are all descendants

628
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,300
sealed into the forbidden land
thousands of years ago.

629
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,220
This explains

630
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:37,940
how realistic that scene was

631
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:38,540
for such a thing to happen.

632
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,300
I used to wonder

633
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,580
how can a shadow puppetry
be so emotional.

634
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,500
I understand now.

635
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,700
It's because I've never seen
someone as skillful as you before.

636
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,220
I'm not.

637
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,220
I...

638
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,300
I'm ashamed.

639
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,500
However,

640
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,620
I am indeed a sorcerer
from the Li family.

641
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,060
The sorcerer badge.

642
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,740
I'm not making this up.

643
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,100
I have the badge.

644
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,060
I am

645
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,540
telling the truth.

646
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,700
Nowadays,

647
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:08,820
except for the Long family's sorcerers,

648
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,180
I won't talk about them,

649
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:12,780
but they are indeed capable
of handling those exotic beasts.

650
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,700
There's also the Qian family.

651
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,100
Who even are they?

652
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:18,260
They are just puppets of Silver Snake.

653
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:19,300
Feather Guards.

654
00:28:19,820 --> 00:28:21,820
Those are just patrol soldiers.

655
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,660
Our Li family

656
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:26,500
controls the shadow puppet troupe.

657
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:30,180
What a shame.

658
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:32,260
Our ancestors

659
00:28:32,260 --> 00:28:33,340
were not competent.

660
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:38,580
I haven't mastered the shadow puppetry.

661
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:39,740
Shadow puppet troupe.

662
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,180
Is it the nine trading caravans

663
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,380
that travel in and out of the pass?

664
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:43,980
Exactly.

665
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:46,020
People

666
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,620
can't leave the pass.

667
00:28:47,620 --> 00:28:51,020
One step outside, and it's a bloodbath.

668
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,140
Throughout history,

669
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:54,740
those who can come and go

670
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,860
are all controlled by Li family's shadow puppet troupe.

671
00:28:57,860 --> 00:28:58,940
Why is it a shadow puppet?

672
00:28:59,340 --> 00:28:59,940
People

673
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:02,140
can't leave Yumen Pass.

674
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,780
Hence, this shadow puppet

675
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:04,900
is non-human.

676
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:07,140
However, it can do human things.

677
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,020
Isn't that just perfect?

678
00:29:09,300 --> 00:29:10,140
Look at me.

679
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,620
Do I look like a shadow puppet?

680
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,500
I can tell that you're a shadow puppet.

681
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,340
You're joking, Ao.

682
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,820
Don't joke about such things.

683
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
Shadow puppet.

684
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,540
You can tell them apart at first glance.

685
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,380
It's...

686
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,300
It's just...

687
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,980
They are a cardboard this thick.

688
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,020
Even if it's torn,

689
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,460
it won't bleed.

690
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,140
It doesn't feel pain when it's burned.

691
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:43,060
When it's burned,
it smells like burning hair.

692
00:29:43,060 --> 00:29:44,020
Ao.

693
00:29:44,020 --> 00:29:46,300
You keep talking
about the shadow puppet troupe.

694
00:29:46,540 --> 00:29:48,620
How do they come out from the pass?

695
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,260
This is a big secret.

696
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,180
How could I possibly know?

697
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:12,340
Ao.

698
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,740
Where are you going?

699
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,020
Yellow Soil City.

700
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,220
I heard that

701
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,220
someone is causing trouble there.

702
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,220
As the heir of a prestigious family,

703
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,500
I must seize every opportunity

704
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:29,860
to stand out.

705
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:40,780
Alright.

706
00:30:40,780 --> 00:30:42,220
Isn't lights out at 11:00 PM?

707
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,220
Let's go.

708
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:48,940
Landlady.

709
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:52,180
Please assist that sorcerer
back to his room.

710
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,260
Sure.

711
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,100
By the way,

712
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,140
don't be alone
when you take a shower later.

713
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,660
At least one person
should be in the room.

714
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,340
(Public bathroom)

715
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,500
(Male bathroom)

716
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:41,620
Gao Shen.

717
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:43,740
Did you see anything?

718
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:46,060
What?

719
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,020
I didn't see anything.

720
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,340
Is that you, Dong?

721
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,580
You guys are really slow.

722
00:32:58,340 --> 00:33:00,460
It takes a long time
for us girls to wash our hair.

723
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,420
I'll go up first.

724
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,820
Are you done showering, Liuxi?

725
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,220
Why don't you wait for me?

726
00:33:04,420 --> 00:33:06,460
Dong, you and Gaoshen,
whichever isn't done yet later,

727
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:07,460
can you wait for me?

728
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,460
Let's go upstairs together.

729
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:09,500
Sure.

730
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,140
Okay.

731
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,420
Sir, our shop is closing now.

732
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,700
I'm sorry.

733
00:33:16,340 --> 00:33:17,140
It's not even 11:00 p.m. yet.

734
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:17,780
It's still early.

735
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:19,300
You need to wake up early tomorrow.

736
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,460
What's going on?

737
00:33:27,460 --> 00:33:28,580
It's not even 11:00 p.m. yet.

738
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,660
The lights are going out
earlier and earlier.

739
00:33:31,460 --> 00:33:32,380
It's about time.

740
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,340
Hurry up and go back
to your room.

741
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,660
You startled me.

742
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,220
Dong, why did you come back with Liuxi?

743
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:39,860
Why aren't you speaking?

744
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:45,980
