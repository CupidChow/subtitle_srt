(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,960
=Episode 12=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:54,760
Hey.

4
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:57,000
Hey, come here.

5
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:01,430
You don't know who they are.

6
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,950
Why are you bringing them here?

7
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,510
Think about it.

8
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,040
They are driving the iron car!

9
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,030
If we can get in with them,

10
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,400
it's only good for us!

11
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,280
And they don't look like bad guys.

12
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:13,400
So be polite to them.

13
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:15,630
Then you sleep here.

14
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:27,910
Buddy.

15
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,360
You were so fierce.

16
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,080
Old Qian.

17
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,190
What do you mean by that?

18
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,750
My last name is not Qian.

19
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,030
So

20
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:42,750
don't follow that girl and call me that.

21
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,240
Several hundred years ago,

22
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:47,400
people like us were venerable

23
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:48,800
outside the pass.

24
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,150
We were given
the honorific title of Alchemist.

25
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:55,310
All your tricks are used to cheat people.

26
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:57,240
Don't make a fool of yourself.

27
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,120
If you have the power to subdue demons,

28
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,630
why are you afraid of those sand people?

29
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,520
Indeed, I can't do that.

30
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:06,960
But my peers,

31
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,840
the Alchemists outside the pass
did a big event.

32
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,240
It was called

33
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:14,520
keeping demons all isolated
in the Yumen Pass.

34
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,960
Have you heard about it?

35
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:19,120
Keeping demons all isolated
in the Yumen Pass?

36
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,240
Well, we did.

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:23,120
But we don't know exactly what happened.

38
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:24,630
Oh god.

39
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:26,000
It's time for another story.

40
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,590
He can't stop.

41
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,150
Anyway,

42
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,710
I learned from a book

43
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:34,800
that the General

44
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,990
wanted to do something unprecedented

45
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:40,310
that his predecessors hadn't done.

46
00:03:41,750 --> 00:03:43,710
He planned to annihilate those evil demons,

47
00:03:44,190 --> 00:03:45,280
devils, ghosts,

48
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,360
monsters, voodoo,

49
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,710
and witchcraft.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:51,310
Destroy them all.

51
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:52,310
What's the plan?

52
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,060
Gather all demons up,

53
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,840
and give them to the Alchemists.

54
00:03:58,150 --> 00:03:59,590
Then those Alchemists

55
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:01,430
dispelled them into the Yumen Pass,

56
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:03,310
and sealed the entrance.

57
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:04,590
By doing so,

58
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,750
inside and outside the pass are
like two worlds

59
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:09,710
without communication.

60
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,630
Anyway,

61
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,280
the Alchemists and Feather Guards

62
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,590
who took the demons inside,

63
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,920
also came in.

64
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:20,160
They didn't find until they were here

65
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:22,240
that the demons outside the pass

66
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,270
just escaped from the Yumen Pass.

67
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,040
Instead of calling them demons,

68
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,240
we call them exotic beast inside the pass.

69
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,270
After the monsters were taken inside,

70
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:33,920
the Alchemists and Feather Guards
who could control them

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,310
just occupied the Black Stone City as rulers,

72
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,630
and spent many years figuring out
how to step into and out of here.

73
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:44,240
There are no demons outside the pass.

74
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
I had watched movies in the markets.

75
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,750
Those from outside the pass
dare to go out at night.

76
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,000
They lit up the whole city

77
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,750
with lamps,

78
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,750
just like day time.

79
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,190
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

80
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,160
It's a song kids can sing.

81
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,600
Well, don't think about stepping
out of the pass.

82
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,190
Because

83
00:05:06,830 --> 00:05:09,390
no one's ever been able to do that.

84
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:13,680
Just sleep.

85
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,800
Did you hear what he said?

86
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,950
No one is able to step out of the pass.

87
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:38,870
But how can you do it?

88
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,360
What's your identity?

89
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,390
Mom.

90
00:07:03,288 --> 00:07:06,390
(Warding against demons.)

91
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:59,680
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight...

92
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,040
That's not enough for us.

93
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,360
What?

94
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,920
Say it again.

95
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,360
What happened?

96
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,750
It's different now.

97
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:37,960
Give me the car keys.

98
00:08:40,550 --> 00:08:41,320
Why?

99
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,670
I want to get something to eat.

100
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,200
I just saw He had a handful of rich
and went up.

101
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,550
Maybe she is going to make breakfast.

102
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,120
Although we stayed here,

103
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,320
we can't take advantage of them.

104
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:53,000
It's okay. I can go to get some food.

105
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,150
Messy beauty.

106
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,030
Don't procrastinate.

107
00:09:33,030 --> 00:09:34,320
Just get the stuff.

108
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,910
We have to make breakfast.

109
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,550
At most,

110
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,670
I can make your bed together.

111
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:12,120
Just one time.

112
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,000
Morning.

113
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:01,440
It's supposed to be a sandstorm today.

114
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,270
Is this unusual?

115
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,670
Dong.

116
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:08,840
Liuxi.

117
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,030
Come here.

118
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:15,550
Today is supposed to be different.

119
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,480
Did the sand people do?

120
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,480
Yes.

121
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,150
It's got hand prints all over it,

122
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,630
including the machine cover.

123
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:32,670
Well, it's a mercy thing
they did to the car.

124
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,720
There is a spare tire.

125
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,480
So we still have three tires left.

126
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,480
There's nothing wrong
with the bodywork,

127
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,720
just the tires.

128
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,360
We have to mend the tire.

129
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,630
But the tire is in such a state

130
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:58,320
that stitches or glue may not help.

131
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,720
The sand people knew how to vandalize a car.

132
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,390
With the tire ruined,
how do we get out of here?

133
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,000
Liu.

134
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,510
Find some ragged quilts

135
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:08,790
and clothes.

136
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:10,360
Anyway, try anything.

137
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:11,150
Okay.

138
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:12,870
Dong.

139
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,150
Can we mend it?

140
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:16,000
Do we still have time to get out of here?

141
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,480
Where can we go?

142
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:19,120
Ultimately,

143
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,390
we got in trouble with the sand people.

144
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:23,670
Fatty Tang,

145
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,270
Unload the luggage first.

146
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:27,390
Later,

147
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:28,720
I will find a hidden place

148
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:31,200
where I can hide the detached tires.

149
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:32,750
If the sand people come,

150
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:33,750
they can just bite the iron.

151
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:34,910
At least we can drive the car.

152
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:38,080
Okay.

153
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,790
Bring this to Old Qian.

154
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:05,910
Breakfast is ready. Tell them to eat.

155
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:08,750
Keep it less noisy.

156
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
Time to eat.

157
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:43,960
It's chocolate.

158
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,960
Good stuff.

159
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,600
I told you.

160
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:04,750
You can't find these in our markets.

161
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,200
Call Fries down.

162
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,390
Where did you get the gun?

163
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:23,270
Maybe Qi put it to me.

164
00:14:23,270 --> 00:14:24,440
Our best defense...

165
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,630
Give these to them.

166
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:26,870
We have to...

167
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:27,550
Let Liuxi decide.

168
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:29,030
Reinforce the doors and windows.

169
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:30,440
Okay.

170
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,240
Take a look around.

171
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,670
See if there are any wooden doors.

172
00:14:35,670 --> 00:14:36,730
- Liuxi. Dong.
- Find all.

173
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,440
We found guns in the bag.

174
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:44,480
You should take out earlier.

175
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:45,550
Well,

176
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:47,030
we just found out.

177
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:00,120
Why is there a sandstorm inside the pass?

178
00:15:03,550 --> 00:15:05,510
But it's different from the one outside.

179
00:15:09,790 --> 00:15:10,910
Where are He and others?

180
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:23,510
Dong! Liuxi!

181
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:26,270
They locked the cellar!

182
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,000
He!

183
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,270
- He!
- He!

184
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:44,550
Liu! Be careful!

185
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:09,840
Come on!

186
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,270
Come with me.

187
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,000
Watch out!

188
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:46,960
Chang Dong!

189
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,630
Go hide over there.

190
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,200

Liuxi.

Gao Shen!

193
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,640
You two keep an eye on the middle.

194
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:55,750
Cover for each other!

195
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,350
I promise
there's no risk behind your back.

196
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,400
So do you.

197
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,720
I will let you know when I can't resist.

198
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:13,440
Fatty Tang!

199
00:18:14,070 --> 00:18:15,400
When you see the sand people fall down,

200
00:18:15,550 --> 00:18:17,590
make sure they don't get up again!

201
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,480
Okay!

202
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:19,550
Liu!

203
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,680
Can you snipe?

204
00:18:21,830 --> 00:18:22,550
Yes!

205
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:24,590
Liuxi. Give her the gun!

206
00:18:24,590 --> 00:18:25,720
Liuxi, I'm here.

207
00:19:31,790 --> 00:19:32,480
Stop.

208
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:33,680
Don't come over here.

209
00:20:30,590 --> 00:20:32,830
An ant crawled out of its ear.

210
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,830
It's a fallen golden ant.

211
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,510
Chang Dong, any sand people we missed?

212
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:52,510

217
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:45,720
She is Kong Yang.

Well, now, it's getting worse.

00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:38,440
Liuxi. Do you really leave Dong alone?

282
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,160
Let him be alone for a while.

283
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,720
Miss Ye.

284
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,720
It's scrap I found in the yard.

285
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,440
Okay. Burn it up.

286
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:50,960
Open the cooking pot.

287
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,790
If you're sensible,
just come out of here.

288
00:27:08,790 --> 00:27:09,790
We can still have a talk.

289
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,070
Don't come inside,

290
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:12,510
or

291
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,790
I will burn your stuff.

292
00:27:13,790 --> 00:27:14,750
Okay.

293
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,270
I can do it for you.

294
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,350
Throw it.

295
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,070
Will this kill anyone?

296
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:28,830
Didn't they just want us all dead?

297
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,480
If we really burn them to death...

298
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,480
Don't worry.

299
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,640
Greedy people are generally afraid of death.

300
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:47,750
Come out!

301
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,350
Stop! We are ready to come out!

302
00:28:20,310 --> 00:28:21,160
Does it taste good?

303
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,880
What were you thinking?

304
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,920
Nothing?

305
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:38,550
Liuxi!

306
00:28:39,070 --> 00:28:39,830
No! Stop!

307
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,200
It has nothing to do with her.

308
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:41,790
Liuxi.

309
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,350
Then tell me.

310
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:44,440
What were you thinking?

311
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:48,790
The manners and morals
of the time are arduous.

312
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:51,270
He's uncles have been gone for days.

313
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,640
I think something happened to them.

314
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,480
We don't have much stuff.

315
00:28:55,830 --> 00:28:58,590
I don't know
how we're going to get through this.

316
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:00,640
When I looked at your things,

317
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:01,920
I knew that they are hot items

318
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,440
on the market.

319
00:29:03,440 --> 00:29:05,000
And your car is great,

320
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,200
being always in demand.

321
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,720
You have an insatiable appetite.

322
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:09,590
Can you guys be able to save these things?

323
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,790
Look at yourself! Want to rob our stuff?

324
00:29:11,790 --> 00:29:13,190
It's hard to say whether it's good or bad.

325
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,030
Are you going to scheme against us
with you guys?

326
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:16,030
You wish!

327
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,510
Didn't you say
the sand people came out at midnight?

328
00:29:20,510 --> 00:29:22,240
Of course.

329
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,550
They don't like daytime.

330
00:29:24,550 --> 00:29:26,640
But when there's a big sandstorm,

331
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,440
and the dust covers the sky,

332
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:32,110
maybe the sand people will follow the dust.

333
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,110
I just wanted to take a bet.

334
00:29:35,110 --> 00:29:36,200
A bet?

335
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,070
You must know
what is the result of losing.

336
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,200
It has nothing to do with them.

337
00:29:41,350 --> 00:29:42,720
It's all my idea.

338
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,790
I asked them

339
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,480
to go to the cellar before,

340
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:48,550
and I stayed at the gate.

341
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:50,480
When I heard something unusual,

342
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,590
I took the barrier and blocked the gate.

343
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:54,790
They had to listen to me.

344
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,640
This place and all stuff are mine now.

345
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,030
Are you going to chase us away?

346
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:07,400
Do I look nice?

347
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,790
I'm just not sure what to do with you guys.

348
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,590
I don't have to clean up that mess, do I?

349
00:30:13,590 --> 00:30:14,590
We have to

350
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:16,590
burn the sand people.

351
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:17,830
They can't be kept.

352
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:19,830
Otherwise, there will be more sand people.

353
00:30:28,310 --> 00:30:29,480
Can we just bury them?

354
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:32,160
No. We must burn them.

355
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:35,030
The sand people were haunted
by the fallen golden ants.

356
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:36,350
There is no hope.

357
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:38,110
Burning is the only way to clean it up.

358
00:30:38,110 --> 00:30:39,680
If we bury them,

359
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,720
the fallen golden ants will be alive again.

360
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:43,880
No end of trouble for the future.

361
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,020
Why are you still here?

362
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:01,750
Go.

363
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,030
Take Fries and barricade the entrance.

364
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:04,830
Go!

365
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:13,070
Burn it. It can't be kept.

366
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:14,030
