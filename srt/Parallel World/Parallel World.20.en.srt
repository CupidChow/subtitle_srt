1
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,070
I've been watching you for a while now.

2
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:19,000
I want you

3
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,190
to take me out with you.

4
00:00:22,120 --> 00:00:23,320
That's not possible.

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,230
Only I can go out of the pass.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,230
Stop the chatter and get going.

7
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,520
Today, I must leave here.

8
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:14,980
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

9
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,840
=Episode 20=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

10
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,140
Welcome Gate is really something,
isn't it?

11
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:23,460
It's like a magic portal.

12
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,580
Imagine if we negotiate authorization
with Black Stone City

13
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,460
and redirect it to outside the pass

14
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,540
Won't that be fantastic?

15
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,020
Why are you always obsessed with money?

16
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:32,820
Can't you simply appreciate things?

17
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,340
Why does everything
have to be about making a profit?

18
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:36,980
Why can't we have both at the same time?

19
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:38,660
If we redirect it to outside the pass,

20
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:41,180
there won't be any more congestion
during the Spring Festival.

21
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:49,620
What's on your mind?

22
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,020
The people at Welcome Gate
are quite formidable,

23
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,060
yet they have to obey Black Stone City.

24
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:56,020
What's so special
about Black Stone City anyway?

25
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,900
Fatty Tang, get in the car.

26
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,340
It's a long way to Black Stone City.

27
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,700
The gas tank has been filled.

28
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,700
You might get a little wet
before landing,

29
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,900
so don't panic later.

30
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:18,860
(Welcome)

31
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:28,900
(Welcome Gate)

32
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:13,180
(Black Stone City, 400 Kilometers Ahead)

33
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:25,780
(Black Stone City, 400 Kilometers Ahead)

34
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,500
Dong, what did you hang that for?

35
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,140
We'll stay here for a couple more days

36
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,140
and wait for Li Jin'ao.

37
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:11,500
When he sees that,
he'll know we're here.

38
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,500
Why wait for him?

39
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,620
Welcome Gate is really strange.

40
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,380
And those women too.

41
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,300
I suspect

42
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:20,060
that they might be from the book

43
00:05:20,060 --> 00:05:21,220
"Demon Museum".

44
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:22,900
Coincidentally, Li Jin'ao

45
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,260
is heading to Black Stone City.

46
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,100
It should take him a day or two

47
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,940
to get here.

48
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:29,940
How strange that they let us through
without any reason.

49
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,820
They even provided us gasoline and food.

50
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,660
It's as if they're afraid

51
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,500
that we won't make it
to Black Stone City.

52
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,260
(Red Flower Tree Inn, No. 16)

53
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:53,460
(Black Stone City Branch,
Red Flower Tree Inn)

54
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:01,540
What's it?

55
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,220
You want some too?

56
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,540
Can you eat this?

57
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,580
I can share it with you,

58
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,700
but from now on,
you have to be on our side.

59
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,740
Deal?

60
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:20,500
Enough, enough.

61
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:21,900
Just this one, okay?

62
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,180
Do we seriously
need to carry Geminus around with us?

63
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,940
If we release it,
it might report to Scorpion Eye.

64
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,740
Keeping it might come in handy someday.

65
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,420
That's true.

66
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,940
When the time comes,
we can make it turn into you.

67
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,340
Let it put on a little show for us.

68
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,660
It can even help us pass the time.

69
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,300
What kind of show do you want from it?

70
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:01,980
If Li Jin'ao doesn't show up today,
let's hit the road.

71
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,100
Is everything packed up?

72
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:05,980
Why are you in such a rush

73
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:07,820
to meet my husband and kid
from Black Stone City?

74
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:14,180
A kid as well? Are you for real?

75
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,700
Go and take a stroll.

76
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,180
Uncle Ao?

77
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,260
Uncle Ao.

78
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,740
I told you, our meeting is meant to be.

79
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,820
Everyone, come quickly.

80
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:43,820
Uncle Ao is here.

81
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:45,140
Uncle Ao.

82
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,460
Uncle Ao.

83
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:48,460
Come here, give me a hug.

84
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,620
Have a seat.

85
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,180
Hello, everyone.

86
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,260
Here, have some water, Uncle Ao.

87
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:01,940
Thank you.

88
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,420
Did you hang that thing outside?

89
00:08:06,420 --> 00:08:07,140
Yeah.

90
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:08,620
I had a feeling that it was you.

91
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,780
I just knew it.

92
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,500
As soon as I saw it,

93
00:08:11,500 --> 00:08:13,140
I knew for sure you all are in here.

94
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,820
Why did you guys just arrive here?

95
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,780
I thought by now

96
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:18,660
you all would have
already entered Black Stone City.

97
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,100
There were some delays
a couple of days ago,

98
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,300
and we thought you'd be here soon.

99
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,020
So, we're here to wait for you
and give you a lift.

100
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,540
Are you all here

101
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,580
to wait for me?

102
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,540
Yeah.

103
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,940
You all are very kind.

104
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:39,580
Thank you.

105
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,860
How is Geminus doing?

106
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,580
It's doing well.

107
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,460
It's practically part of our crew now.

108
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,340
That's great.

109
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,460
How was your journey?

110
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:50,220
The journey was pretty smooth.

111
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,020
When you passed through Welcome Gate,

112
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:54,260
how was your feeling?

113
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,100
I was totally baffled at that moment.

114
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,900
I thought it was way too advanced.

115
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:01,220
I didn't expect it to be like that.

116
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,420
I thought it was just a big doorway.

117
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:06,140
Uncle Ao, what exactly
are those welcoming attendants?

118
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:07,580
I noticed they
left water footprints with each step.

119
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,700
Are they some kind of water spirits?

120
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,740
No, they are not.

121
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,100
They are Water Eyes.

122
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,100
The Water Eye
is an exotic beast shaped like water.

123
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,940
This creature
has male and female counterparts.

124
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:21,140
Male and female Water Eyes
can communicate instantly,

125
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:24,340
even if they're miles apart.

126
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,780
There's a saying,
"A Water Eye sees a thousand miles

127
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,500
and distinguish the finest details".

128
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:31,260
Water Eyes

129
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,620
are like a pair of eyeballs.

130
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:33,900
What the female Water Eye sees,

131
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,700
the male Water Eye instantly perceives,

132
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,540
and vice versa.

133
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:40,300
Please sit up straight

134
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:42,340
and remove your hats and masks.

135
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,300
So, this inspection

136
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,100
is just the people from Black Stone City
keeping an eye on things?

137
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:46,660
You're right.

138
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:50,020
Entering Black Stone City
is a pretty serious deal.

139
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:53,020
So, you see,
you must undergo strict scrutiny.

140
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:55,300
Anyway, since you
are going to Black Stone City,

141
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,660
do you have any plans?

142
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:01,900
Let me share mine first.

143
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,660
Well, I definitely

144
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,740
have to visit the East and West Markets.

145
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,300
I heard they're bustling.

146
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:09,580
There's one more thing
I've always wanted to see.

147
00:10:10,540 --> 00:10:11,540
It's the Black Stone Shopping Street.

148
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:38,020
(Black Stone City)

149
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,580
This is somewhat like the city walls
in our place.

150
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
There are actually people here
to receive you.

151
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,460
What a grand reception.

152
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,660
I'll go.

153
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,060
(Zhao Guanshou)

154
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,420
Ye Liuxi.

155
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:05,620
You're back.

156
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,540
Who are you?

157
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:18,340
And who am I?

158
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,260
I'm the leader
of the Black Stone City Feather Guards,

159
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,460
Zhao Guanshou.

160
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,340
Follow me into the city.

161
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,820
I'll gladly answer all your questions.

162
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:34,020
Are these

163
00:12:34,020 --> 00:12:35,580
your friends from outside the pass?

164
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:37,380
I see.

165
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:39,260
Get in the car.

166
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,260
Let's head into the city.

167
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,740
Liuxi.

168
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:03,060
Are they members of Feather Guards?

169
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,460
He said
he's the leader of Feather Guards,

170
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,500
named Zhao Guanshou.

171
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:06,820
He wants us to follow him first.

172
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:07,660
No.

173
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,900
Don't follow him just like that.

174
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,860
We've been deceived many times
on this journey.

175
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,980
They have so many people and cars,

176
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,540
we won't be able to escape
even if we want to.

177
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,020
Let's go.

178
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,260
(Black Stone City Museum)

179
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,740
Miss Ye.

180
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,900
Should we send your friends back first

181
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,020
to rest?

182
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:47,900
Where is this?

183
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,060
Is it highly confidential?

184
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:52,860
This is equivalent
to a museum outside the pass.

185
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:53,740
Liuxi.

186
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Please?

187
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,380
Can my friends come along?

188
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,340
Sure.

189
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:00,820
This way.

190
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,420
We're together.

191
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:09,180
I'm sorry.

192
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,540
Please wait here.

193
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,620
Wait here.

194
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:30,420
I know

195
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,340
there are many things
that you can't remember.

196
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:33,660
It's okay.

197
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:35,980
After walking through this place,

198
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:37,020
you'll understand everything.

199
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,900
Inside the pass,

200
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,780
Black Stone City
is the oldest and largest territory.

201
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:49,460
There are also two big mountains.

202
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,460
One of them is the Black Stone Mountain,

203
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:54,300
(Map of inside the pass)

204
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,340
and the other
is the Gold Mine Mountain.

205
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:00,620
Come. This way, please.

206
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:31,700
Shadow puppets.

207
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,900
What's the deal with this Sima Road?

208
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:43,020
Sima Road?

209
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:46,820
Are you referring to the tomb complex
of the shadow puppets?

210
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:50,580
The shadow puppets are exotic beasts

211
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:52,260
that resemble humans

212
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,780
but more delicate in material.

213
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,540
They are susceptible to damage
from the wind and rain.

214
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,860
After some time,

215
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:01,220
they undergo
a process of self-replacement.

216
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,100
To honor their contributions

217
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:05,380
and provide them
with a proper resting place,

218
00:17:05,380 --> 00:17:06,620
after they are placed in coffins,

219
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,460
the exotic beast, sand eye,
will construct graves for them.

220
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:12,860
Sand eyes feed on sand

221
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:15,660
while acting as guardians of the graves.

222
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:18,460
In case of
malicious erosion by the wind or water,

223
00:17:18,460 --> 00:17:20,620
they can promptly make repairs.

224
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,100
Follow me.

225
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,620
(The Bone of Liuxi.
The Soul of Wangdong.)

226
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
(The Bone of Liuxi.
The Soul of Wangdong.)

227
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:44,140
These six characters

228
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:45,540
can be read forward

229
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:47,020
or backward.

230
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,220
Soul to the east, bone to the west.

231
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,180
Isn't it a coincidence?

232
00:17:53,420 --> 00:17:55,860
Ye Liuxi. Chang Dong.

233
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:58,220
It's also Xi vs. Dong, right?
[*West vs. east]

234
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,300
What does
"The Bone of Liuxi" have to do with me?

235
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,220
Let's move on.

236
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,460
What's this?

237
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:26,500
This painting

238
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,100
depicts the Beast Head revolt.

239
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:31,180
Legend has it that when the Nandou Stars

240
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:34,220
stand still in the noonday sky,

241
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:37,220
there will be a great turmoil
in the pass.

242
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:42,380
Over a thousand years ago,

243
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:44,940
a divine omen occurred

244
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:48,540
as a village woman gave birth to a boy.

245
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:51,740
He was named Li Wangdong.

246
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,740
The ignorant commoners

247
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:00,100
claimed the abuse of Black Stone City's
four major families

248
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:02,620
led to the constant turmoil
inside the pass.

249
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:08,060
After Li Wangdong grew up,

250
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:12,460
he founded the Beast Head organisation.

251
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,740
He aimed to overthrow the rule
of Black Stone City

252
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:19,060
and sought external help

253
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,220
to rescue the people inside the pass

254
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:23,860
and open the Yumen Pass.

255
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,180
For this purpose,

256
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,380
he sponsored gold
to Lord Li from outside the pass

257
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:31,620
to enlist an army of a hundred thousand.

258
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:36,460
However,

259
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:39,460
as he was about to lead the army
into the pass,

260
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,540
the lord betrayed him

261
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,780
and almost killed him outside the pass.

262
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:51,860
Eventually,

263
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:54,500
Beast Head fell apart.

264
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,860
Li Wangdong saw that the situation
was lost.

265
00:19:58,420 --> 00:20:00,780
Thus, at the moment
when the Nandou Stars disappeared,

266
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,060
he drew his sword and committed suicide.

267
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,940
The Li family's sorcerers
reanimated the shadow puppets,

268
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:12,420
forming the shadow puppet caravan
once again.

269
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,180
Over the next thousand years,

270
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,260
they traversed the Yumen Pass
to enter and exit Black Stone City,

271
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:21,580
engaging in trade with the outside.

272
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:24,500
Feather Guards and the sorcerers

273
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:27,020
restored order inside the pass.

274
00:20:27,220 --> 00:20:28,540
The Qian family found out

275
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,820
the person born on the next occurrence
of the Nandou Stars

276
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:34,180
would appear simultaneously
with the Sheep's Horn.

277
00:20:35,180 --> 00:20:36,100
Besides that,

278
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,940
it would be a baby girl.

279
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,820
The Silver Snake had once prophesied

280
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:46,340
that when the Sheep's Horn reappeared
and the Beast Head awakened,

281
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:49,820
chaos would, once again, ensue.

282
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,740
The Qian family found out

283
00:20:54,580 --> 00:20:56,220
(Old Mrs. Qian)
the meaning of "Nandou breaks Yumen".

284
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,660
What did you find out?

285
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:26,900
She's in the village
in the north of Flowing Sand Yardang.

286
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:35,380
With the area
around Flowing Sand Yardang being vast,

287
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:36,820
finding a baby girl

288
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,420
would not be an easy task.

289
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:39,700
No matter how big the search is,

290
00:21:40,380 --> 00:21:41,780
she must be found

291
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,820
and killed

292
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,660
to prevent the calamity of the past
from recurring.

293
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:48,820
The fate within the pass

294
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:51,380
and the destinies
of the four major families

295
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:55,380
are all tied to this one baby girl.

296
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,940
Those born on the day
when Nandou graces the sky

297
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,220
shall carry forth their family name.

298
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,420
A male shall bear the name Wangdong,
while a female shall be named Liuxi.

299
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,740
At that time,
the shadow puppetry magic will fail,

300
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,780
and the shadow puppet caravan
will be paralyzed.

301
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,940
The individual
granted access to Yumen Pass

302
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,260
is bound to create chaos.

303
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,380
This is the big disaster in the pass.

304
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,460
"Head west to exit Yumen".

305
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:18,340
More than two decades ago,

306
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,220
you were born in a village

307
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,460
near Flowing Sand Yardang.

308
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,700
Since your birth,

309
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,700
not a single shadow puppet
within the pass

310
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:27,340
has managed to stand once more.

311
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,780
I have finally understood.

312
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,620
The puppets and I are irreconcilable.

313
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,500
We simply can't co-exist.

314
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:48,980
I'm destined to rebel.

315
00:22:49,180 --> 00:22:50,660
If I'm such a significant threat to you,

316
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,300
why not simply kill me

317
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,220
to end it once and for all?

318
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,300
If things

319
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,580
were as simple as you say,

320
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:59,820
it wouldn't be the great calamity
inside the pass.

321
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:03,900
Ye Liuxi.

322
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:07,460
Whether it's you or Li Wangdong,

323
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,860
you two are destined

324
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,180
to lead long lives in this pass.

325
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:13,540
The people in the pass can't kill you,

326
00:23:15,100 --> 00:23:16,300
but those outside can.

327
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:21,100
We don't want another Beast Head revolt.

328
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,220
We've spent over decades

329
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,500
to finally track you down.

330
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,620
Fortunately, we've found you soon.

331
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:37,940
If we were a few years late,

332
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:39,980
you might have become a problem.

333
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:48,300
We brought you back to Black Stone City

334
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,180
and enrolled you in Feather Guards

335
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:55,020
to transport supplies
in and out of Yumen Pass.

336
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:09,540
However, no one could have known

337
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:11,460
that the uprising of Scorpion Eye
would happen so soon

338
00:24:11,740 --> 00:24:13,820
with Jiang Zhan as the leader.

339
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,260
Scorpion Eye's momentum

340
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,660
was like another Beast Head.

341
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,660
Not long after that,

342
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:29,780
Huyang City on the northeast border fell

343
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,380
and became Scorpion Eye's stronghold.

344
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,060
The Qian family

345
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,020
had Silver Snake prophesied three times.

346
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,860
The first prophecy was
"Nandou breaks Yumen".

347
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,300
The second prophecy was a disaster.

348
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:50,900
"Head west to exit Yumen".

349
00:24:51,460 --> 00:24:52,420
As for the third time,

350
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:55,460
a salvation method was provided.

351
00:24:56,340 --> 00:25:00,060
What's strange is

352
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:03,820
that the third prophecy
mirrored the second,

353
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:06,140
both saying "Head west to exit Yumen".

354
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,140
The Qian family said

355
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:12,100
both prophecies
signify disaster and opportunity.

356
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:14,340
So, Ye Liuxi,

357
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,500
you are both the one who tied the bell

358
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:17,900
and the one who will untie it.

359
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:21,060
Based on the Silver Snake's prophecy,

360
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,340
we decided to send you undercover
with Scorpion Eye.

361
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:25,660
However,

362
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,540
my cover had been compromised.

363
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,260
That's right. Not long after that,

364
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:33,300
Jiang Zhan decided

365
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,780
to hang you outside Huyang City

366
00:25:37,940 --> 00:25:39,620
as a warning to others.

367
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:42,060
Although we have spies

368
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,820
embedded within Huyang City,

369
00:25:43,820 --> 00:25:45,660
rescuing someone from prison

370
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:46,860
is far from easy.

371
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:51,100
I found the leader of the sorcerers,
Long Shen,

372
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,940
and discussed a solution.

373
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:56,340
You've probably
heard this saying before.

374
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,940
"Amid a midnight sandstorm,

375
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:02,300
a faint Yellow Soil City
appearing in the midair

376
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,380
is actually

377
00:26:03,380 --> 00:26:05,300
the city spirit of Yumen Pass".

378
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:09,820
So, this Yumen Pass

379
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:12,580
is not the same as the one
referred to by outsiders.

380
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:17,100
This is a model
of the reconstructed city in Yumen Pass.

381
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,100
As for the gate of Yumen Pass,

382
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:28,580
we call it the Demon Museum.

383
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:31,060
It's located south
of Flowing Sand Yardang,

384
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:33,820
a passage connecting
the inner and outer parts of the pass.

385
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,820
Within the Demon Museum

386
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:37,860
sealed

387
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:39,460
the most ferocious beasts of the pass.

388
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,500
The phrase "One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry"

389
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,740
means that anyone from inside the pass

390
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:46,140
enters the Demon Museum
in an attempt to leave

391
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,580
will inevitably meet their demise.

392
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,700
But

393
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,340
there is one exception,

394
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,660
and that is you,

395
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:57,660
as you

396
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,220
have the Bone of Liuxi inside you.

397
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,820
I want you

398
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,580
to take me out with you.

399
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,140
I don't want to leave anymore.
Take me back.

400
00:27:24,140 --> 00:27:25,340
I don't want to leave anymore.

401
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,900
I don't want to leave anymore.
Take me...

402
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:30,340
Take me back.

403
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:56,780
"One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry".

404
00:27:56,780 --> 00:27:58,260
I wasn't joking, was I?

405
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:21,060
