=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,540
=Episode 8=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:48,930
Fine.

4
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:53,180
Let's go back.

5
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:58,850
Dong.

6
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:00,650
Wow.

7
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,700
That bag is full.

8
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,970
It's real.

9
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,780
Regardless of whether it's real or fake,
let's grab it all first.

10
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,620
You're pretty quick.

11
00:02:12,620 --> 00:02:13,410
Look, Dong!

12
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,090
Is this "surviving disaster
brings fortune"?

13
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:19,860
Fatty Tang.

14
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:22,490
Later, we'll return to Seadragon Heap.

15
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,780
You head straight
down the road to Ying City.

16
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,300
Are you still going back?

17
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:28,490
Give him the satellite phone.

18
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,780
Keep in touch.

19
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,740
We'll ask for your help when needed.

20
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,650
Deliver some supplies.

21
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,650
Won't you bail on us?

22
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:34,860
Definitely not.

23
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:35,780
Then,

24
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:38,090
am I delivering it to you there?

25
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,620
What are you afraid of?

26
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,900
We'll just need your help
to deliver it at the intersection.

27
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:44,180
That's no problem at all.

28
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,300
Alright, we're leaving here.

29
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:48,490
I'll miss you guys.

30
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:49,970
Then come along with us?

31
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:50,860
No need, really.

32
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:52,690
I'll hold down the fort.

33
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:54,060
I will wait for your call.

34
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:52,580
That's leather.

35
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,580
It comes in white, light gray and dark.
It also differs in texture.

36
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:59,210
The best material is
used for carving talents and beauties.

37
00:03:59,650 --> 00:04:00,780
The not-so-good material

38
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,300
is for carving warriors and clowns.

39
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,000
The worst

40
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,370
goes to props.

41
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,300
Even in leather carving,
material quality depends on character.

42
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,580
Such a snob.

43
00:04:13,460 --> 00:04:15,780
So why did you pick me
to go in the desert?

44
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,210
That's the rough draft.

45
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,780
You need to plan before carving.

46
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,700
The movable parts need to be jointed.

47
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,780
So, the head and limbs
need separate drafts.

48
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,300
It's like disassembling the organs
into pieces.

49
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,580
It's ruthless.

50
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:19,290
Chang Dong.

51
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:22,850
Do you really
enjoy making shodow puppets?

52
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:24,780
No, not really.

53
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,820
Not really?

54
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:36,410
If you've gone through
some really tough times,

55
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:38,380
and no one's there to help,

56
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:40,020
yet you don't want to give up,

57
00:05:40,410 --> 00:05:43,410
you can only turn to some other things
to substitute and fill the void,

58
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:44,700
thus shifting your focus.

59
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,820
Anything works,

60
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:51,050
whether it is alcohol,
beauties or even shadow puppets.

61
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,650
So, you still haven't given it up yet.

62
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,260
Is it because
you haven't found a way out?

63
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,300
It's because I've grown accustomed to it.

64
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,210
If so, I can't learn that.

65
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:05,820
I have no painful experience.

66
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:09,850
Never experienced any pain before?

67
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:13,090
Maybe. Sometimes I feel like...

68
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:17,900
I might haven't even cried before.

69
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:24,500
Who's there?

70
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,260
Who?

71
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,260
Wait.

72
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:39,700
He seems to be Hui Ba's cook.

73
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,650
(Cook)
Was he the one

74
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:45,460
who made pancakes
and cooked the lamb soup for us?

75
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:48,140
Yes, he was scared away last night.

76
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:49,980
It seems he has been
scared out of his wits.

77
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:53,970
You're pretty tough.
You even found your way back.

78
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,410
What's he doing?

79
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,850
Using an umbrella.

80
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:07,530
Why are you using an umbrella?
It's not raining.

81
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:11,290
It's raining sand.
Everything is getting buried.

82
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,820
Without an umbrella,

83
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,340
you'll be buried.

84
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:15,530
Who's buried?

85
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:16,530
Ba.

86
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,610
He went back to the coffin.

87
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:21,340
How was he buried?

88
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:24,090
With sand, in a straight line.

89
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,500
What about the coffin?

90
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,700
Watch him. I'll go get a rope.

91
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:31,860
It'll be trouble if he runs away.

92
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,460
You...

93
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:40,210
Should I have coaxed him to sleep?

94
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:41,900
No, but at least you...

95
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,580
Alright, it's fine.

96
00:07:50,850 --> 00:07:51,820
Hold on.

97
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:03,850
He dropped his umbrella.

98
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,260
Okay.

99
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:10,210
You use it.

100
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:32,530
Are you still
pondering Seadragon Heap 2?

101
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:39,690
Have you ever considered

102
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,410
that if there really is Seadragon Heap 2,

103
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,220
it doesn't take living folks.

104
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:46,620
There's a chance

105
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:47,930
the cook

106
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:49,980
didn't go insane when Hui Ba died.

107
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:52,100
Instead, he returned to that spot later,

108
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:56,100
and maybe he saw something
or went through something that scared him silly.

109
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,810
But he didn't vanish.

110
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:01,100
So, are you suggesting

111
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,860
dead people vanish

112
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,340
while the living ones stick around?

113
00:09:05,690 --> 00:09:06,500
It's a possibility.

114
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:09,100
What's on your mind?

115
00:09:19,050 --> 00:09:20,410
For the past few nights,

116
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:21,900
we've had some bizarre stuff happen,

117
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:23,860
all accompanied

118
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,290
by strong winds and sandstorms.

119
00:09:28,450 --> 00:09:29,500
And there's that song.

120
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:36,290
♪Unmindful as I step into the gate,
tears trace down my face♪

121
00:09:36,740 --> 00:09:41,620
♪One step out of the pass,

122
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:47,650
♪Yumen Pass, the gate of hell♪

123
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:53,860
♪One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry♪

124
00:09:53,860 --> 00:09:55,810
So, everything we've been through
on this journey

125
00:09:55,810 --> 00:09:57,780
is somehow connected to Yumen Pass.

126
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:03,050
Do you remember what you said earlier?

127
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:04,900
It seems like

128
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,900
I've been in some really harsh places,

129
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,050
(just trying to survive.)

130
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,930
Am I from inside the pass?

131
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:19,530
I'm not sure.

132
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:22,500
But you mentioned earlier

133
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:25,380
that you used to be a delivery driver,

134
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,330
driving a big truck,

135
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:31,140
delivering shoes, clothes and books.

136
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,140
But who were you

137
00:10:33,690 --> 00:10:35,020
delivering these things to?

138
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,780
Help me close the door.

139
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,740
There's a kid here.

140
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,900
It seems like another orphan.

141
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,260
Where are you taking me?

142
00:11:16,690 --> 00:11:18,380
You'll find out once we arrive.

143
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,320
- It's raining sand!
- It's okay.

144
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,140
It's raining sand!

145
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,180
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

146
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:53,900
It's raining sand!

147
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:54,700
Calm down.

148
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,940
- It's raining sand.
- Are you familiar with this place?

149
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:00,660
It's raining sand.

150
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:03,980
Get in the car.

151
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,380
It's raining sand.

152
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:15,580
It's raining sand.

153
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:21,940
How is it?

154
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:22,860
There.

155
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,560

172
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,500
After five days of sightseeing,

173
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,780
all the marvelous sights
have turned into mere heaps of earth.

174
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:23,380
How are you doing?

175
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,740
You've been observing for quite a while.

176
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:30,300
This place resembles the photos,

177
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,140
but I can't shake the feeling

178
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:33,860
that Kong Yang isn't here.

179
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:36,300
I also doubt that this place
knows who I am.

180
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:12,660
It's okay. Go ahead.

181
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,580
It's Fatty Tang.

182
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,500
Hello.

183
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,460
(Dong.)

184
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,900
(Ying City sure is wonderful.)

185
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,020
I have to say,
the city environment is superior.

186
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:02,420
Dong, how's it going on your end?

187
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,020
Do you need any supplies, like oil?

188
00:15:04,020 --> 00:15:06,100
I'll purchase
and send them to you if you do.

189
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:07,780
Sure, go ahead and send them over.

190
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,060
I'll pay you back when you arrive.

191
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:10,220
Don't be so courteous.

192
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:11,340
No need to pay me back.

193
00:15:11,620 --> 00:15:12,620
(By the way, Dong.)

194
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,020
(How's the investigation
with Liuxi going?)

195
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,900
Not much progress,

196
00:15:18,020 --> 00:15:21,060
but we found one of Hui Ba's men
who got frightened on that night.

197
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,420
We plan to bring him along.

198
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,420
(Well, you must be running low on supplies.)

199
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:27,300
(I'll buy supplies
and bring them to you tomorrow morning.)

200
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,380
Hang on, Dong.

201
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,500
There's something I need to tell you.

202
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:32,700
(I was free lately,)

203
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,820
(so I did some online research
on Liuxi's past leads,)

204
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:36,580
(and I actually found something.)

205
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:39,420
(I wouldn't have been able to recognize it before,
but now I can definitely tell.)

206
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,140
(It looks almost exactly
like the picture of Liuxi)

207
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:42,060
(in Hui Ba's book.)

208
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,300
(It's strikingly identical.)

209
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,740
Do you know what Liuxi traded
with these people in the past?

210
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,340
(Gold nuggets, Dong.)

211
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,820
(Liuxi used to
carry gold nuggets with her)

212
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,860
(and scared these guys out of their wits.)

213
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:54,660
(Dong.)

214
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,060
Alright, send it to me.

215
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,580
(Okay.)

216
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:06,340
Is this you?

217
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:11,420
Am I beautiful?

218
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:17,180
Don't you think

219
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:19,780
the key to this whole thing
lies with you?

220
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,260
Are you saying

221
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:24,340
I summoned the Yumen Pass?

222
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,300
It's possible.

223
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,380
Let's take a moment to recall.

224
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,020
During this time,

225
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,260
have you noticed anything unusual
about yourself?

226
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:35,860
We've been together every day,

227
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,820
so can't you notice
if there was anything unusual about me?

228
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,300
Your leg injury?

229
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,940
Do you honestly believe Yumen Pass
is like a fly,

230
00:16:56,540 --> 00:16:58,340
attracted to my blood's scent?

231
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:00,980
Give it a try.

232
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,340
I'll get the tools.

233
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:03,860
Are you serious?

234
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:16,460
Look.

235
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,060
What are you looking at?

236
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,380
Look at the sand.

237
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:52,460
The wind leads.

238
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,100
The wind?

239
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:04,900
There's a saying in Dalpur, "Wind leads
at the head, water follows at the tail."

240
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:08,260
They believe
both wind and water are alive.

241
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:10,540
When water ceases to flow and dries up,

242
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:12,340
that's where the tail is.

243
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,940
And where the wind rages the most,

244
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,100
that's where the head is.

245
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,620
We might have just encountered one.

246
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,460
This is the first time

247
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,460
I've seen the wind
visibly grow before my eyes.

248
00:19:04,940 --> 00:19:05,940
Are you okay?

249
00:19:06,580 --> 00:19:07,540
I'm okay.

250
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:10,140
The Abnormal Sand reappeared.

251
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,180
Have we entered another world again?

252
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:14,860
- Let's go, then.
- Where to?

253
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:15,860
Where Hui Ba's body is.

254
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,300
Okay.

255
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,860
When Huo Ya left,

256
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:17,380
he clearly stated
that the mark was gone.

257
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,900
Let's follow it.

258
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,500
See if the shadow coffin is there.

259
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:24,620
Go.

260
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,940
It's raining sand.

261
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,380
It's raining sand.

262
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:37,260
It's raining sand!

263
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,580
- What's going on with you?
- It's raining sand!

264
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:40,900
No, something's wrong.

265
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,900
It's raining sand.

266
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,940
The Yardang landform has changed,

267
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:45,820
but

268
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,780
it should be the right place.

269
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,340
Did he see something happen here?

270
00:20:51,340 --> 00:20:53,620
So, that's why he's so terrified.

271
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,260
It's raining sand!

272
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:57,260
I'll go check it out.

273
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:00,900
Wait here.

274
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:03,420
It's raining sand!

275
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,500
On that night,

276
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,660
the shadow coffin was here,

277
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,380
and the corpse

278
00:21:14,780 --> 00:21:15,820
was placed there.

279
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:18,780
Seems like it has been taken away.

280
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:21,580
Everything changed in just one night.

281
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,980
That was quite an undertaking.

282
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,260
Who would have such abilities to do so?

283
00:21:28,180 --> 00:21:30,700
There should be a shovel right there.

284
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,340
Seems like it.

285
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:02,740
I don't remember

286
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:05,380
seeing this earthen platform that night.

287
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,180
Me neither.

288
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:17,380
Hold on.

289
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:20,020
The soil here is soft.

290
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:24,260
The main component of Seadragon Heap
is sandy mudstone,

291
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:26,020
which has a high hardness.

292
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:28,380
On the other hand,
this is just a regular earthen platform.

293
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:30,020
How is that possible?

294
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:32,940
It's raining sand!

295
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,580
It's raining sand!

296
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,300
The way he mentioned the sand,

297
00:22:40,660 --> 00:22:44,220
could this earthen platform have been formed
by the accumulation of falling sand?

298
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,460
(It's raining sand.)

299
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,100
Everything is getting buried.

300
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,860
Without an umbrella, you'll be buried.

301
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,060
Who's buried?

302
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,220
Ba.

303
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,420
- It's raining sand.
- In that case,

304
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,260
the bodies of Hui Ba and the others

305
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,220
should be down there.

306
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,180
The satellite phone has no signal.

307
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,980
It seems like our inference is correct.

308
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,020
You are indeed the key to this.

309
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,060
Don't you think it's absurd?

310
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,100
Yes.

311
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:26,900
It is absurd.

312
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:30,940
It looks like not everyone can do it

313
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,580
except for you.

314
00:23:34,540 --> 00:23:36,260
If you're a native of this place,

315
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,100
in your world,

316
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,460
you're equivalent to a key.

317
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,500
Once detected,

318
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,220
strange phenomena
will occur near the gate.

319
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:47,220
I know. Just like an automatic switch.

320
00:23:47,220 --> 00:23:50,660
Swipe your ID, and the gate will open.

321
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:55,220
So, these Seadragon Heaps
are checkpoints.

322
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,260
It's quite possible.

323
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,780
You even brought a drone.

324
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,800
Have you ever used it?

325
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:12,380
I'm broke.

326
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:15,500
Let's give it a try later.

327
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,780
You must pay for it if you break it.
I rented this.

328
00:25:45,660 --> 00:25:47,100
The Yardang is gray-white in color,

329
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,780
but the earthen platform is yellowish.

330
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:50,300
It's hard to distinguish up close,

331
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,140
but it'll be clear from a distance.

332
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,460
(Sima Road)

333
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,980
There's an earthen platform here.

334
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:06,700
Look.

335
00:26:07,580 --> 00:26:09,060
Two parallel lines.

336
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,220
It looks like a road.

337
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:46,060
The earthen platforms
resemble streetlamps.

338
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:47,740
They are evenly distributed
on both sides.

339
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,460
The width is about a hundred meters.

340
00:26:49,660 --> 00:26:52,140
Longitudinally,
there's one every kilometer.

341
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,060
I counted them.

342
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,460
Ten on each side. Twenty in total.

343
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:57,580
But this doesn't look like a road.

344
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,500
Where does it lead to?

345
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:07,460
It looks like the Sima Road.

346
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:08,580
What's the Sima Road?

347
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:10,980
In somewhere
emperor and empress are buried,

348
00:27:11,700 --> 00:27:14,380
there will be a Sima Road on the entrance

349
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,940
leading to the mausoleum.

350
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:19,180
If it's like a Sima Road
that leads to a mausoleum,

351
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,940
the Yumen Pass
should be a colossal tomb, right?

352
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:29,460
You still can't remember anything?

353
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:30,760
Remember what?

354
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:34,860
After everything you've been through,

355
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,060
can't you remember anything at all?

356
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,300
I can't.

357
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,180
I told you already.

358
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,860
This is not a normal form of amnesia.

359
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,740
It's called jagged amnesia.

360
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:45,140
It's not easy to recover from.

361
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,220
Fine then.

362
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:50,260
You're the only one
with jagged amnesia in this world.

363
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,740
Just say what you want.

364
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,980
What are you planning to do next?

365
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,100
There's one last thing.

366
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:04,660
To see how this Yumen Pass
disappeared with my own eyes.

367
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:07,380
Let's recall everything
that had happened.

368
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:11,380
First, you were cut by the salt crusts.

369
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:13,340
Your blood spilled on the ground.

370
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:16,500
That night, we saw
ghost fire and shadow puppets

371
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,500
at Hui Ba's campsite.

372
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:24,900
Then, you bled on the ground
the second time.

373
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,580
That night, Fatty Tang...

374
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,580
Fatty Tang was dragged away.

375
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,220
Save me, Dong!

376
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,820
The next morning,

377
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:34,780
the tire marks and flags disappeared.

378
00:28:34,780 --> 00:28:36,100
Where did the flags go?

379
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:38,500
Hao Ya and the others
discovered the shadow coffin platform.

380
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:42,660
That night, Hui Ba and...

381
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:45,060
Hui Ba and his men died.

382
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:50,260
Then, everything returned to normal.

383
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:51,060
No.

384
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:55,060
The tire marks
appeared on the third morning.

385
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:56,660
That's when everything return to normal.

386
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,220
Dong.

387
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:03,660
The tire marks and flags
have reappeared.

388
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:08,180
We have a signal now.

389
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,300
So, it's safe to assume

390
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:15,780
you're some kind of medium
that can open the gateway.

391
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:16,860
In other words,

392
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:20,140
you can summon the vanished Yumen Pass.

393
00:29:20,980 --> 00:29:21,980
Go on.

394
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:25,500
In other words,
the Yumen Pass you wrote in your notes

395
00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:29,180
is the one we're looking for.

396
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:32,820
The second time,
from Fatty Tang being dragged away

397
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:33,900
to Hui Ba's death,

398
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:37,260
and until the third morning
when the tire marks appeared,

399
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,260
it had been at least twenty-four hours.

400
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,140
If my inference is correct,

401
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:45,300
as long as we stay at the location
where Hui Ba died,

402
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:51,900
we'll be able to witness
the disappearance of Yumen Pass.

403
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,100
So, the guy became a madman
because he was scared by what he saw.

404
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,180
Maybe.

405
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:05,180
What if both of us get scared too?
What should we do?

406
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,740
Are you sure
you want to keep on investigating?

407
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:16,100
Initially, it was my obsession
to get Black Camellia members' bodies.

408
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,620
But both of us have come this far now.

409
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,260
If I give up now,

410
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:23,540
I'll never forgive myself.

411
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:28,500
I won't give up until I find them.

412
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:31,100
Aren't you the same?

413
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,620
Alright.

414
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:36,780
Let's go check it out later.

415
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,100
First, let's dig out the shadow coffin.

416
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:59,340
Let's see if there are any changes
when Yumen Pass disappears.

417
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,140
Come here.

418
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,380
What's wrong?

419
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,060
Block the wind for me.

420
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,540
Let me tell you a scary story.

421
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:00,540
No.

422
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:03,420
We've been here for so long.

423
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,780
It'll be boring if we keep quiet.

424
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,060
I'm not bored.

425
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,500
Chang Dong.

426
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,020
If you become a madman afterwards,

427
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:20,060
I won't just leave you alone. I promise.

428
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,380
I'll tie a rope around you.

429
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:31,420
You'll stay by my side.

430
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:34,380
I'll sell melons
while you perform shadow puppetry.

431
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,560
I'll make some barbecue

432
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,680
while you keep the fire burning.

433
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,940
I'll give you all my love.

434
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,220
I think I'll pass.

435
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:10,460
What's wrong?

436
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,860
My leg's gone numb. Hey, don't.

437
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,620
Don't touch it.

438
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,940
I said my leg's numb, so don't touch me.

439
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,020
You'll feel better if massage it.

440
00:33:18,020 --> 00:33:18,860
No.

441
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,940
Just let me sit here for a while.

442
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:21,100
I'll be fine in a moment.

443
00:33:24,340 --> 00:33:25,940
Chang Dong, I'm going to kill you.

444
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,500
Does it feel better now?

445
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,700
It's actually much better now.

446
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,780
Are you still going to kill me?

447
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,580
A little higher.

448
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,500
Never mind, I'll do it myself.

449
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:43,420
Come.

450
00:33:50,300 --> 00:33:51,100
Stand here.

451
00:33:52,460 --> 00:33:53,220
Block the wind.

452
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,700
Turn around.

453
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,220
Look, Liuxi.

454
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:39,280
