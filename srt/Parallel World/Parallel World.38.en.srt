00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,300
=Episode 38=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:49,390
The day we entered the mine,

4
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:51,830
I was imprisoned in the cave

5
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:53,870
by Long Zhi.

6
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:55,790
Liu.

7
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:56,670
Wake up.

8
00:01:56,670 --> 00:01:57,830
Liu. Look at me.

9
00:01:57,910 --> 00:01:58,710
Liu!

10
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:03,270
Liu. I'm the real Gao Shen.

11
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,390
Take me instead.

12
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:11,070
Take me instead!

13
00:02:20,470 --> 00:02:23,510
(I heard from the guards that you were
heading to Black Stone City,)

14
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,550
(so I decided to escape.)

15
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:32,270
(But during my escape...)

16
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:32,670
Over there.

17
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,710
(I ran into a dead end,)

18
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,990
(so I had no choice
but to jump into the Golden Pool.)

19
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,550
My body was corroded
by the pool's water.

20
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:44,750
But luckily,

21
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,590
Golden Snake saved me.

22
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,830
Its saliva alleviated my symptoms.

23
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:59,030
But when I woke up again,

24
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:03,070
I had become a monster
covered in snake scales.

25
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,590
(After some time passed,)

26
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,590
(I got used to it.)

27
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:31,750
(When I got hungry,)

28
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:34,110
(I ate the meat and bones
from the sacrificial pit.)

29
00:03:35,230 --> 00:03:36,230
(When I got bored,)

30
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,390
(I swam in the Golden Pool.)

31
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,070
(I could do whatever I wanted.)

32
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:47,270
It was not that bad.

33
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,150
Liuxi.

34
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,690
These are fragments
of the Sheep's Horn Cup.

35
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:07,470
I found them at the bottom of the pool.

36
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,590
After you get out,

37
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:18,150
you can try to restore it.

38
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,550
I've pieced it together.

39
00:04:20,910 --> 00:04:21,950
Not a single piece is missing.

40
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:33,270
There's one more thing.

41
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:35,830
Before,

42
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,590
I betrayed you all.

43
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,430
I pointed a gun at you.

44
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:45,630
Yet, you're willing to find me now.

45
00:04:47,710 --> 00:04:49,510
I'm very grateful to you.

46
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:53,390
But I hope you can tell everyone

47
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,390
that I'm dead.

48
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:00,510
Liu might be upset,

49
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,150
but she'll get over it after a while.

50
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,630
She talks tough,

51
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:11,670
but she has a soft heart.

52
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:21,030
She

53
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:25,550
might be with me out of sympathy.

54
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:39,910
But as you can see,

55
00:05:42,270 --> 00:05:43,990
with my current condition,

56
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,270
it's impossible for me to be with her.

57
00:05:55,870 --> 00:05:56,910
Gao Shen.

58
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,710
Go with me, okay?

59
00:05:59,190 --> 00:06:00,510
We don't have to leave the pass.

60
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:03,670
I'll find a place for you to settle.

61
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:05,070
Then, we can look for doctors

62
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,110
or even sorcerers.

63
00:06:06,150 --> 00:06:07,790
We'll try one by one.

64
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:09,750
We'll definitely find a way to cure you.

65
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,510
Liuxi.

66
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,950
Please

67
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,590
let me stay here alone.

68
00:06:46,510 --> 00:06:48,110
Gao Shen.

69
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,550
Gao Shen.

70
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:01,270
Wait for my message.

71
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,990
Thank you.

72
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:26,790
You're awake.

73
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:31,590
What's wrong?

74
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,830
Do you have a headache?

75
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:34,510
Don't worry, Dong.

76
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,990
I've healed up a while ago.

77
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,270
I just needed a good rest
before we pick up Liuxi and Gao Shen.

78
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,070
Liu.

79
00:07:47,070 --> 00:07:49,510
You didn't know
about your godfather's secret business.

80
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:51,390
He's been arrested.

81
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,830
After this, whether you want to work

82
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,990
or study,

83
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,590
Fatty Tang and I will support you.

84
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,150
Yeah, Liu.

85
00:07:59,150 --> 00:07:59,950
We're here to help.

86
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:03,630
Alright, thanks, Dong.

87
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:05,790
And Tang.

88
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:08,710
This is the first time you call me Tang.

89
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:10,910
Your respect for me has leveled up.

90
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,550
Find someone
to repair the Sheep's Horn Cup.

91
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:34,630
Li Jin'ao.

92
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:37,270
Who's that?

93
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:39,150
Regarding Gao Shen's situation,

94
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:40,590
what's the outlook?

95
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,390
Not good.

96
00:08:47,590 --> 00:08:48,830
Miss Ye.

97
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:50,510
Come take a look.

98
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,830
This.

99
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,710
Use the saliva with caution.

100
00:08:56,830 --> 00:08:57,710
Excessive use may

101
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:59,190
lead to a Human-Snake transformation.

102
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:01,390
Everything

103
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,510
exists in a dynamic balance.

104
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:05,430
Saliva can be protective,

105
00:09:05,430 --> 00:09:07,230
but it can also be a poison.

106
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:09,310
Using lots of saliva

107
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:12,190
can stop the decay of the flesh.

108
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,390
But on the skin's surface,

109
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:15,270
a permanent layer

110
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,510
of Golden Pool-resistant
snake scales will form.

111
00:09:18,670 --> 00:09:19,790
And then,

112
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:21,710
the brain will be damaged.

113
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:24,270
The person will
lose his memory little by little.

114
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,550
Eventually,

115
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:28,550
he'll forget he's a human.

116
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:31,110
He'll transform into a Human Snake.

117
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,150
How terrifying.

118
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:34,110
If what you're saying is true,

119
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:35,990
this is bad.

120
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:39,870
Those snake scales
had already formed on his skin

121
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,750
when you last saw him.

122
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:43,030
He might not have much time left.

123
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:45,470
Maybe the next time you see him,

124
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,510
he'll have turned into a Human Snake.

125
00:09:48,510 --> 00:09:49,830
In the past nine months,

126
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:51,950
I've cross-referenced all the records
of exotic beasts

127
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:53,830
we acquired from the market

128
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:56,270
with the sorcerers.

129
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:57,910
There can be no mistakes.

130
00:09:59,670 --> 00:10:00,710
There's a hope though.

131
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:01,830
Miss Ye.

132
00:10:02,270 --> 00:10:03,550
Come with me.

133
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:04,590
Come.

134
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,470
I have

135
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:12,590
a bold and crazy idea.

136
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:15,990
We can merge Gao Shen
with a shadow puppet.

137
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,910
People had done it before.

138
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:21,110
What do you think?

139
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:23,790
How do we do it?

140
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:28,150
The concept is simple,

141
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,270
but the details are complicated.

142
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,950
I'll have to go to the museum
to check the records.

143
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,550
I'll do everything I can to save Gao Shen.

144
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:40,950
After merging with the shadow puppet,

145
00:10:40,950 --> 00:10:43,270
Gao Shen may display
the characteristics of the puppet.

146
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,630
Still, it's better than
becoming a beast or a Human Snake.

147
00:10:46,070 --> 00:10:48,150
But the shadow puppetry magic has lost.

148
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:50,590
No shadow puppet can stand up now.

149
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:53,150
For a shadow puppet to stand up,

150
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,910
Bone of Liuxi must die,

151
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:56,670
so the shadow puppets can be restored.

152
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:58,670
But you see,

153
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,070
this part of your bone here,

154
00:11:02,310 --> 00:11:04,630
isn't it dead now?

155
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:05,910
Doesn't it mean

156
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:08,110
you've restored the shadow puppets?

157
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:10,590
So, in other words,

158
00:11:10,590 --> 00:11:11,750
as long as Gao Shen and I agree,

159
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,190
we can implement it right away?

160
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,230
But there's a challenge.

161
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:18,510
For a human
and a shadow puppet to merge,

162
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,590
this shadow puppet

163
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:22,390
has to be carved to perfection.

164
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,510
Since Gao Shen is disfigured now,

165
00:11:24,550 --> 00:11:26,790
where can we find an artist,

166
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:29,270
who knows
what Gao Shen looked like before

167
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:31,870
and is able to carve him perfectly?

168
00:11:32,430 --> 00:11:34,030
You see. This is the challenge.

169
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,910
Well.

170
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,830
I happen to know such

171
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:40,270
Mr. Artist.

172
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:43,390
Mr. Artist?

173
00:11:49,530 --> 00:11:51,310
(Spicy Lamb Hooves)

174
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,990
(Public phone)

175
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:04,790
(Shadow Puppet Theater)

176
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:15,610
(Shadow Puppet Theater)

177
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,630
Use both hands.

178
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,710
Dong.

179
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:50,030
You're back.

180
00:12:50,070 --> 00:12:51,070
Yeah.

181
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:52,310
Please.

182
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,150
Come inside.

183
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:27,830
Dong.

184
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:32,790
Here.

185
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:06,430
Liuxi.

186
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:09,110
I'm willing to become a shadow puppet.

187
00:14:09,990 --> 00:14:11,430
Have you thought it through?

188
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,310
If you become a shadow puppet,

189
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:14,830
you'll only look like a human,

190
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:17,190
but you'll still be different
from a real one.

191
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,030
I'm content with that.

192
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:21,470
I can see the sun,

193
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,190
speak,

194
00:14:24,190 --> 00:14:25,950
and have a human appearance

195
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,510
to walk in the sunlight.

196
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,310
I'm content with that.

197
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:53,590
Li Jin'ao.

198
00:14:57,830 --> 00:14:58,990
Miss Ye.

199
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,830
Aren't you about to leave the pass soon?

200
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:02,750
Why do you have time to drop by?

201
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:04,390
You're worried, aren't you?

202
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:05,790
Rest assured.

203
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:08,070
I've arranged everything
for your departure,

204
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:09,870
and I promise
we will take care of our tasks

205
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:11,670
after you leave the pass.

206
00:15:16,670 --> 00:15:18,190
What is this?

207
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:21,270
I...

208
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:22,510
Take it.

209
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,470
I'm really

210
00:15:24,470 --> 00:15:25,510
not interested in this.

211
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:26,550
I'll leave then.

212
00:15:44,790 --> 00:15:46,230
Thank you.

213
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:51,150
Thank you for trusting me, Miss Ye.

214
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:52,830
Don't worry.

215
00:15:53,630 --> 00:15:56,070
I'll protect it with my life.

216
00:15:56,630 --> 00:15:59,030
I'll keep it by my side at all times.

217
00:16:01,310 --> 00:16:02,310
Thank you.

218
00:16:03,870 --> 00:16:04,910
I...

219
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:07,910
Alright, stop.

220
00:16:08,790 --> 00:16:10,430
No sentimentality. See you.

221
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,430
Thank you for trusting me, Miss Ye.

222
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:33,550
Who'd have thought sorcery isn't the key
to dealing with exotic beasts,

223
00:16:33,550 --> 00:16:35,670
but the staff's gold is.

224
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:37,910
Gold

225
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,150
is always useful.

226
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,510
That fact will never change.

227
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,870
But I think there are things

228
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:42,830
that should change a little.

229
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:45,790
For example,
Feather Guards and sorcerers.

230
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,230
Why should the families
get to monopolize?

231
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:50,570
Why should only the heirs
get to be part of the organization?

232
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:53,270
Everyone should have a right to choose.

233
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:57,310
From now on, Feather Guards and sorcerers
are just jobs.

234
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,310
They're not family businesses anymore.

235
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:01,950
Anyone who wants to be a Feather Guard
can take up that job.

236
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:03,750
Anyone who has enough skills

237
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,990
can join the sorcerers.

238
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:07,190
Of course, if the people
who inherit the jobs from their fathers

239
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,190
don't want to take up the mantle,  it's fine.

240
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,590
They can always be tradesmen.

241
00:17:12,310 --> 00:17:14,190
I think that's good too.

242
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:15,950
I'll leave things in your hands, then.

243
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:17,270
Sure.

244
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,670
I'll be back real soon.

245
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:19,750
Safe journey.

246
00:17:26,990 --> 00:17:27,950
Liuxi.

247
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:29,990
I got someone to fix this.

248
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,870
Ye Liuxi is leaving the pass.

249
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,190
She has both Sheep's Horn Cups.

250
00:17:50,950 --> 00:17:52,910
If she opens the pass,

251
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,670
won't that worry you?

252
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,870
Why should I worry?

253
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:05,030
This is "Head west to exit Yumen".

254
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:36,070
How about this?
You sure you can do this?

255
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:39,190
Can you catch up with me?

256
00:18:39,510 --> 00:18:40,390
Give me that.

257
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,240
Stop there.

258
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:04,710
What's wrong?

259
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:06,950
Is something bothering you?

260
00:19:08,710 --> 00:19:09,910
We work with Miss Ye

261
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:13,430
and took over Black Stone City
in nine months.

262
00:19:13,550 --> 00:19:15,630
Not even Li Wangdong

263
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:16,910
could achieve that back then.

264
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,590
Right?

265
00:19:17,590 --> 00:19:18,590
Yeah, true.

266
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,830
But

267
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:21,990
taking over Black Stone City

268
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:23,590
is nothing.

269
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:25,750
Our Miss Ye

270
00:19:26,510 --> 00:19:28,270
is someone who can leave the pass.

271
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:29,990
Next,

272
00:19:30,510 --> 00:19:32,510
she'll destroy Yumen's demons.

273
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:33,470
Then we

274
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:34,870
can leave the pass

275
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,750
and live the good life.

276
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:38,550
That won't do, bro.

277
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:41,310
They have metallic vans
everywhere outside the pass.

278
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:42,870
Not to mention planes,

279
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,590
cannons,

280
00:19:43,710 --> 00:19:44,990
and a ton of people.

281
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,070
We're outnumbered,

282
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:48,430
and their tools

283
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,510
are better than ours.

284
00:19:49,510 --> 00:19:50,750
- We can't fight them.
- Yeah.

285
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,430
If they lock us up like we're monsters,

286
00:19:52,430 --> 00:19:53,910
it's going to be hell.

287
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:55,390
Bro.

288
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:56,710
I say

289
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:58,230
we go with the ambush plan.

290
00:19:58,470 --> 00:19:59,630
Run after we get a hit.

291
00:19:59,630 --> 00:20:00,990
Then run back to get another hit.

292
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:01,790
We will be boss.

293
00:20:02,030 --> 00:20:03,430
What is it with them?

294
00:20:03,570 --> 00:20:04,750
If they're at someone else's turf,

295
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:05,870
they should lay low

296
00:20:05,870 --> 00:20:08,070
and get along with the people there.

297
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,790
But they still think about robbery
and if they'll be locked up.

298
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:26,990
Do I really have to bring these guys
out of the pass?

299
00:20:27,230 --> 00:20:29,070
Do you want to leave the pass, He?

300
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,110
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

301
00:20:40,190 --> 00:20:41,710
When I was with Feather Guards,

302
00:20:41,830 --> 00:20:43,230
I heard them talk about it.

303
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,310
The Demon Museum has a curse within it.

304
00:20:45,790 --> 00:20:48,030
Anyone inside the pass, if they leave,
they get sucked dry.

305
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,270
Every single drop of blood they have.

306
00:20:49,310 --> 00:20:50,270
That's why

307
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:52,710
I've never thought about leaving.

308
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,430
What if

309
00:20:55,270 --> 00:20:57,470
you don't have to be drained?
Will you want to leave?

310
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:06,590
Not really.

311
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,190
When I was watching the movies,

312
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:10,630
I envied the people in there a little.

313
00:21:10,630 --> 00:21:11,990
But that was just fantasy.

314
00:21:12,470 --> 00:21:14,710
If I really go out,
there are a lot of people out there.

315
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:16,670
How am I supposed to adapt?

316
00:21:16,670 --> 00:21:18,270
I think my life now is alright.

317
00:21:19,510 --> 00:21:20,270
And,

318
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:22,100
we keep thinking about leaving,

319
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
but we haven't been thinking
how the people will look at us.

320
00:21:24,470 --> 00:21:25,270
If it were me

321
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:27,790
seeing so many
strangers coming out of nowhere,

322
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:28,710
I wouldn't be surprised.

323
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:29,830
I would be shocked.

324
00:21:30,390 --> 00:21:31,150
So

325
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:34,230
if you have to stay inside the pass
your whole life,

326
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:35,670
would that sit well with you?

327
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:42,070
I think life inside the pass is alright.

328
00:21:42,430 --> 00:21:44,190
There might be a gold mine out there,

329
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:46,030
but I prefer my own place.

330
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:48,990
Even if

331
00:21:49,070 --> 00:21:51,750
a lot of stuff inside the pass
isn't better than anything outside,

332
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,830
we can still solve the problems
our own way.

333
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:56,310
Why do we have to move
to someone else's turf

334
00:21:56,550 --> 00:21:57,790
and live according to their whim?

335
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,190
I've always

336
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:01,390
had one goal.

337
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:04,070
Open the pass and break Yumen.

338
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,230
If I want to open the pass,

339
00:22:06,590 --> 00:22:09,150
I'll have to release the exotic beasts
in the Demon Museum.

340
00:22:09,510 --> 00:22:10,710
These beasts

341
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:13,150
might torment the people
inside and outside the pass.

342
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:16,190
But if we destroy these beasts,

343
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,830
my Bone Mender,

344
00:22:20,030 --> 00:22:21,590
Chang Dong's Heartstring,

345
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:23,830
Gao Shen's shadow puppet,

346
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,310
and your substitute tongue,

347
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,830
will all be gone.

348
00:22:30,630 --> 00:22:32,590
You can't rely on something

349
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,750
while trying to destroy its source
at the same time.

350
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:43,190
But this has been my life's dream.

351
00:22:46,990 --> 00:22:48,590
(Yet now,)

352
00:22:48,590 --> 00:22:50,750
(I have another dream.)

353
00:22:53,230 --> 00:22:56,230
(A world that is free
of murder and bloodlust.)

354
00:22:57,430 --> 00:23:00,230
(You guys and Chang Dong
changed me.)

355
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:18,750
You see.

356
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:21,430
Dong is feeling better now.

357
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:24,710
Since he is here to pick Liuxi up this time,
she might come out.

358
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:26,030
We're picking her up like this?

359
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,290
Looks embarrassing, don't you think?

360
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:29,670
You want to bang some drums
and swing a banner around?

361
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:31,230
You are so not creative.

362
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,790
If Liuxi comes out,

363
00:23:32,790 --> 00:23:34,510
what's the first thing
she'll want to see?

364
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:35,750
Dong and me.

365
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:38,990
The atmosphere.

366
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:42,190
The air of familiarity, unfamiliarity,
nostalgia,

367
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:45,230
and something
that says 'it's been so long'.

368
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:47,470
How should we do that?

369
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:49,410
Dong.

370
00:23:50,390 --> 00:23:51,550
Just an example.

371
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,230
We'll take Liuxi's old van

372
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:54,310
and show it to her.

373
00:23:54,310 --> 00:23:55,590
When she sees

374
00:23:55,590 --> 00:23:57,590
that the van and us are still the same,

375
00:23:57,590 --> 00:23:59,750
she'll think about her experience
over these months.

376
00:24:00,150 --> 00:24:01,510
And the air of nostalgia

377
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,790
will hit.

378
00:24:03,230 --> 00:24:05,470
Oh, shut it. Drive that old van
all the way to Seadragon Heap?

379
00:24:05,790 --> 00:24:07,150
There is no way we can do that.

380
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,390
That might be Liuxi.

381
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,630
It's just the wind.

382
00:24:19,630 --> 00:24:20,670
Not sure.

383
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:23,590
It's windy time for this area.

384
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,110
Liuxi.

385
00:24:51,590 --> 00:24:53,150
No matter what you choose to do,

386
00:24:53,150 --> 00:24:54,710
I'll go with you.

387
00:24:56,750 --> 00:24:57,990
I'll be waiting for you to come back.

388
00:25:39,190 --> 00:25:40,110
Dong.

389
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:41,510
What if Liuxi comes out

390
00:25:41,510 --> 00:25:43,030
and doesn't know we're here?

391
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:44,990
Why don't I release some gnats?

392
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,270
The gnats can fly to her,
and when she sees the gnats,

393
00:25:47,270 --> 00:25:48,950
she'll know where we are.

394
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,790
That's alright.

395
00:26:28,070 --> 00:26:29,230
Dong.

396
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,590
Sorry.

397
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,470
It's alright.

398
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,950
(After a long, long time,)

399
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,110
(I can)

400
00:26:56,110 --> 00:26:59,550
(freely go in and out
of Black Stone City's treasure chamber.)

401
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,270
(After going through books
in and out of the pass,)

402
00:27:02,270 --> 00:27:05,950
(I get the gist of what's happening
in and out of the pass.)

403
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:10,310
(In the language
of people outside the pass,)

404
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,430

(a long, long time ago,)

(the worlds)

406
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:18,030
(outside and inside the pass
were connected.)

407
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:20,230
(For some reason,)

408
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,510
(they were broken up)

409
00:27:21,630 --> 00:27:24,430
(and turned into parallel worlds.)

410
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:26,430
(They cannot touch each other.)

411
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:29,550

00:27:29,550 --> 00:27:31,950
(species, and geography
of these worlds)

413
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:34,390
(took different paths of development.)

414
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:36,750
(In a realm unseen,)

415
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:38,950
(these worlds share a connection.)

416
00:27:39,310 --> 00:27:42,630
(The outsiders may
call it a different name.)

417
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,630
(We from the inside call it Yumen Pass.)

418
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:50,390
(The Demon Museum inside the pass
is one of the entrances.)

419
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:55,750
(To go in or out of the pass,
you either must have Sheep's Horn Cups,)

420
00:27:55,750 --> 00:27:59,230
(or a special physique like Ye Liuxi.)

421
00:27:59,750 --> 00:28:01,990
(Or else, if the people inside the pass
leave the pass,)

422
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,990
(they'll be like fish out of water.)

do you know what it said?

What?

457
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:56,630
It said that on this trip,

458
00:30:57,030 --> 00:31:00,030
I will do well in my endeavors.

494
00:33:40,990 --> 00:33:42,830
if Gao Shen and Liu

495
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:44,270
got married in the end.

live inside the pass after that?

get a boy or a girl?

00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,510
I told you

502
00:33:58,510 --> 00:34:00,670
I heard this story from someone else.

Ye Liuxi and Chang Dong

00:34:05,390 --> 00:34:07,630
What happens inside and outside
of the pass

506
00:34:08,510 --> 00:34:10,030
is just a legend.

507

00:34:15,790 --> 00:34:17,430

509
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:19,270
This story,

510
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,670
at this point,

511
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:25,030
has come to an end.

512
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:31,910

513

514
00:34:34,270 --> 00:34:35,830
got together and talked.

516
00:34:38,470 --> 00:34:39,990

518
00:34:41,470 --> 00:34:42,990
aren't you staying in the inn?

519
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:06,070
Come here, He.

520
00:35:06,070 --> 00:35:06,910
Take a photo.

521
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:15,310
Alright.

522
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:17,310
Let's eat something good.

523
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,750
What is she drawing?

524
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:34,790
Check it out yourself.

525
00:35:44,590 --> 00:35:45,870
Are you drawing something?

526
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:47,670
I'm drawing my mother.

527
00:35:47,670 --> 00:35:48,710
Yeah, right.

528
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:51,230
There's no way your mother is a robot.

529
00:35:51,670 --> 00:35:52,670
Little one.

530
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:55,830
Let's go.

531
00:35:56,630 --> 00:35:57,430
Let's go home.

532
00:36:01,110 --> 00:36:03,390

533
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:08,910

Come, let's hop.

535
00:36:14,110 --> 00:36:16,590
Raise your legs.

536
00:36:22,990 --> 00:36:27,230

537
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:31,670
