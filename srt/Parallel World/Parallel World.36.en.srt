(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
=Episode 36=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,300
Liuxi.

4
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,740
Why don't I

5
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,900
get someone to make you some gloves?

6
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:10,420
Does it not look cool?

7
00:02:35,100 --> 00:02:39,600
(Ying City)

8
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
(May 24th, Wednesday)

9
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,460
(On May 25th, two years ago,)

10
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,060
(the day of Camellia's tragedy,)

11
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:22,700
I planted the Heartstring in you,

12
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,940
extending your life by three years.

13
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:25,780
Chang Dong.

14
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,500
Your time is running out.

15
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,900
Don't you want to extend your life?

16
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,900
Miss Ye.

17
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,300
I have a question.

18
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,500
Are we really going to
fight our way in like this?

19
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,260
Why not?

20
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,980
What about Feather Guards
and the sorcerers?

21
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,700
I know they're nothing to you,

22
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:05,100
but I'm a bit concerned.

23
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,620
I'm worried Black Stone City

24
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,500
will use exotic beasts to fight.

25
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,140
The exotic beasts are usually

26
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:14,140
very peaceful.

27
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,260
Of course.

28
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,060
Occasionally,

29
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,340
they might hurt someone,

30
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,660
but I can guarantee

31
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,340
Black Stone City is behind that.

32
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,260
Really.

33
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:26,300
Yes.

34
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:28,540
Why fight the exotic beasts
if they did nothing to us?

35
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:30,540
We won't fight them.

36
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:32,700
We won't fight them.

37
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,140
Oh my.

38
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,900
I actually have the same idea

39
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,700
as the great Miss Ye.

40
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,980
Miss Ye, you're brilliant.

41
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,340
Really. Also,

42
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,900
there aren't many exotic beasts left.

43
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,180
If we kill them,

44
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,740
they might go extinct.

45
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,140
I've calculated

46
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:51,340
the entire battle.

47
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:53,020
We won't win any advantages.

48
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:53,860
Right.

49
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,100
We can't kill them.

50
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:55,500
Okay.

51
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,660
No killing.

52
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:57,460
Uncle Ao.

53
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,700
What are you talking to Geminus about?

54
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:01,900
I was talking to...

55
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:11,900
How many times

56
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:14,180
before you'll remember?

57
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,460
Any news
about the Silver Silkworm Heartstring?

58
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,540
You're asking me?

59
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,060
None, for now.

60
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:32,420
I've been reading all the books.

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,980
I've asked all the elderly sorcerers.

62
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:35,940
My conclusion is

63
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,180
the Heartstring

64
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:38,580
is a Long family secret technique.

65
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,540
Right now,
only two people can extend his life.

66
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:42,660
One is Long Zhi.

67
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
The other is Long Shen.

68
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:46,740
Liuxi.

69
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,500
We've been fighting the entire time.

70
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,500
There aren't many arrows left.

71
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:54,180
If we waste our arrows
on the beasts guarding the city,

72
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,340
it might not be effective,

73
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,490
and there are Feather Guards.

74
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,540
I'm going on a walk.

75
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,940
Stay safe, Miss Ye.

76
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:07,340
We must take Black Stone City tomorrow.

77
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:11,460
Tomorrow night

78
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,300
is the last day of Chang Dong's 3 years.

79
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:17,500
Even if Ye Liuxi has the Silver Silkworm Heartstring,

80
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:19,700
as long as we don't pluck it,

81
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:21,220
Chang Dong will die.

82
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,340
Let's not
talk about the Heartstring for now.

83
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,140
Long Zhi.

84
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:33,020
Why do you refuse
to use Gao Shen and Jiang Zhan

85
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:34,780
to negotiate with Ye Liuxi?

86
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,380
Long Zhi.

87
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,060
I imprisoned Gao Shen
in Gold Mine Mountain.

88
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,220
He escaped a few days ago.

89
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:49,100
He likely died in the Golden Pool.

90
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:51,380
What about Jiang Zhan?

91
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,580
Why not hand him over?

92
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:58,620
You know
what Jiang Zhan means to Ye Liuxi.

93
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:00,620
Long Zhi.

94
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,460
The unworthy,

95
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:04,980
the undeserving,

96
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,100
and the impossible

97
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,700
have no meaning even if you keep them.

98
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,180
Chang Dong is in our hands.

99
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,580
Ye Liuxi wants to save him.

100
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,020
She will surrender tomorrow.

101
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,380
What if

102
00:07:22,700 --> 00:07:24,580
Ye Liuxi doesn't care about him?

103
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,060
Her bow

104
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,140
is not a weapon we can defend against.

105
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,180
Ye Liuxi has a bow,

106
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,860
but she has limited arrows.

107
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,420
In the last nine months,

108
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,780
she marched from Flowing Sand dunes
to Black Stone City.

109
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,660
Her armed supply must be quite low.

110
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,860
We'll send out the exotic beasts first

111
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,580
to stop her at the first line of defense.

112
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,020
Then, we'll go after her followers.

113
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,020
We can definitely win.

114
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,460
Dong.

115
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,740
Was the mission tough?

116
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,100
What's this?

117
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:40,500
Does Qi not have space for you two?

118
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:45,700
We just missed you.

119
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,980
Yeah, we missed you.

120
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:59,220
The bed is still the best.

121
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:00,980
Dong.

122
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:02,890
We haven't received any news
from inside the pass.

123
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,020
We've been to Seadragon Heap
so many times.

124
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,940
We tried everything we can.

125
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:07,980
Fatty Tang.

126
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,980
Yes, Dong.

127
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,740
Liu and I were thinking

128
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:14,500
what if Long Zhi wasn't lying?

129
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,140
If the Heartstring
can only last three years,

130
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:17,380
tomorrow is the day.

131
00:09:17,380 --> 00:09:19,100
- We can't let you face it alone.
- That's right.

132
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,540
We'll be by your side.

133
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,820
Understood.

134
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:25,180
You're here to collect my body, right?

135
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,860
No.

136
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,300
Don't say something that depressing.

137
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,460
That's great.

138
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,940
At least, I won't be alone

139
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:33,460
and only found days after my death.

140
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:34,780
That'd be undignified.

141
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,980
Are you two thirsty?

142
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:40,220
We're hungry.

143
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,380
I'm hungry too.

144
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,180
Are you here to mooch off me?

145
00:09:44,740 --> 00:09:45,620
Also,

146
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:47,220
you'll be sleeping on the floor later.

147
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:49,820
Don't steal
the bed of someone who's dying.

148
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,340
What are you saying?

149
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,500
What?

150
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,940
Say,
when will Dong's Heartstring expire?

151
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:23,340
Is it midnight on the 24th

152
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,900
or on the 25th?

153
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:26,660
Or is it somewhere in between?

154
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,180
You're confusing me.

155
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,740
It's midnight anyway, right?

156
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,220
I get that.

157
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,220
It's midnight soon.

158
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,500
Midnight on the 24th means tonight.

159
00:10:38,540 --> 00:10:39,900
Yes. If Dong is still fine

160
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:40,780
after midnight tonight,

161
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,180
it means...

162
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,820
Everything is fine.

163
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,220
Yes.

164
00:10:43,060 --> 00:10:44,380
So what we need to do now is,

165
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:46,620
when Dong comes back later,
we'll stay up until midnight.

166
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,780
We can't let him sleep.

167
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,820
We can't sleep either?

168
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,940
Of course, we can't sleep.

169
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,700
Can you stay awake?

170
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,460
I can.

171
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,940
The two of us will talk to him
about anything and everything.

172
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,980
Dong, does this outfit look good on me?

173
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,360
You've probably never seen it before.

174
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,100
It looks

175
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:05,860
kind of strange.

176
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,020
Strange? This is fashionable.
What do you know?

177
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,380
Liu, since you're wearing this,

178
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,780
you should dance for Dong right away.

179
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,420
Why should I dance?
You should dance too.

180
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:14,100
No, I can't dance at all.

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:14,620
Get up.

182
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:16,300
I'm not wearing a dress,
why should I dance?

183
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,860
Who says you can only dance in a dress?

184
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,940
Hurry up and dance for Dong.

185
00:11:18,940 --> 00:11:19,820
No. You get up and dance.

186
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,940
Come on. Get up.

187
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:22,100
You need to cooperate a bit.

188
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,860
What are you doing, Dong?

189
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,940
It's been so long since
I slept this way.

190
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:31,820
Dong is going to sleep
on the floor with us.

191
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,460
That's great.

192
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:35,580
I really miss the days
when we used to sleep in a row together.

193
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:38,260
Yeah, I miss my old life.

194
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:41,860
Dong.

195
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,700
You've been back and forth on this trip,

196
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,500
so it must have been really hard for you.

197
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:50,380
Do you miss Liuxi?

198
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:52,140
Who doesn't miss Liuxi?

199
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:53,580
Dong.

200
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,380
Although we can't see Liuxi now,

201
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,020
I hope Liuxi,

202
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,220
Gao Shen,

203
00:11:58,660 --> 00:11:59,580
and He

204
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,220
can stay together

205
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,780
like the three of us.

206
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,660
That way,

207
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,100
even if they go through anything,

208
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:09,860
they can take care of each other,

209
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,660
and their days won't be too hard.

210
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:43,940
Stop.

211
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,100
Are you blind?

212
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:46,700
I'm sorry, Miss Long.

213
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,340
There was a landslide just now.

214
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,740
You can just tell us
what you need us to do.

215
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,540
What's wrong?

216
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:47,540
I'm scared.

217
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,220
I told you not to play around.

218
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,740
Come back.

219
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,900
Golden Snake.

220
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:41,220
Most exotic beasts here
are afraid of gold.

221
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,780
Except for you.

222
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,420
Not only are you not afraid,

223
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,140
but you also like to hide
in the Gold Mine Mountain.

224
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,980
You are
truly unique among exotic beasts,

225
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,820
just like me.

226
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,060
It's precisely because of this

227
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:57,260
that the beasts in the pass

228
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,460
all respect you.

229
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:02,060
You are the true Beast Head.

230
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,760
I know you've been out of touch
with the world for many years.

231
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,740
But now,

232
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:14,860
I need your help.

233
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:45,820
Once I take down Black Stone City

234
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:48,220
and take control inside the pass,

235
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,380
I will absolutely not allow
the people and beasts in the pass

236
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,100
to suffer from oppression and slavery.

237
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,020
I'll do as I say.

238
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:01,340
Trust me.

239
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:21,180
(11:55 p.m.)

240
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:49,180
Not dead, still breathing.

241
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:21,740
(9:04 a.m.)

242
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,020
Dong.

243
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:48,860
Dong?

244
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,740
Dong?

245
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,100
Fatty Tang.

246
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:03,500
Dong.

247
00:18:03,980 --> 00:18:04,620
Dong.

248
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:05,580
Move, let me see.

249
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,100
Let me see.

250
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,900
Dong.

251
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,140
Dong.

252
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:14,460
Quick, call the hospital.

253
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:16,340
Call the hospital.

254
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,820
Stop. Who goes there?

255
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:28,980
Report in.

256
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,020
I want to see Zhao Guanshou,

257
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:31,700
Long Shen, and Old Mrs. Qian.

258
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,900
They're not people you can meet
just because you want to.

259
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,980
Tell them my name is Ye Liuxi.

260
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,900
Open the door.

261
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:03,180
Ye Liuxi.

262
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:06,820
Are you here to surrender?

263
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,860
Go get your father to negotiate with me.

264
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,220
It seems that Chang Dong

265
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,540
does not mean much to you.

266
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,340
I can easily take down Black Stone City.

267
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,300
Go back and tell that to your elders.

268
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,060
You're really stubborn.

269
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:50,380
- They are leaving.
- The exotic beasts are flying away.

270
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:51,140
They're flying away.

271
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,540
- The exotic beasts are gone.
- They flew away.

272
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,740
All the exotic beasts have run away.

273
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,700
Miss Long.

274
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,680
Commander of Sorcerers asked you to return.

275
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,060
Hurry up.

276
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,460
The patient's condition is critical.

277
00:20:40,460 --> 00:20:41,700
Hurry.

278
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,580
Alright.

279
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,140
You two,

280
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:47,860
please wait outside.

281
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:49,300
Get prepared.

282
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:49,860
Okay.

283
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,860
Inject 0.5 milliliters of adrenaline.

284
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,460
Start resuscitation.

285
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:23,020
(Chang Dong.)

286
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,660
(You have to live well.)

287
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:27,780
If you don't make it past the 25th,

288
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:29,780
it means that I lost.

289
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:32,060
If there are any unresolved grudges,

290
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,900
we'll settle it together
on the other side.

291
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:43,940
Aren't we doing well now?

292
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:47,340
If you live past that day,

293
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:50,100
every extra day you have
is another day I'll hang on.

294
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:53,380
Please take care of yourself.

295
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,340
Live well.

296
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,340
Enjoy a comfortable life.

297
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:01,860
Don't let my hard work inside
be in vain.

298
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,620
(Did you hear me?)

299
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,340
(If I come back one day,)

300
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,500
and I see you in a miserable state,

301
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,700
you're in for a thrashing.

302
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,580
Alright.

303
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,700
People of Black Stone City, listen up.

304
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,060
We, Scorpion Eye, are entering the city.

305
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,100
But after we enter the city,

306
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,260
we won't plunder,

307
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,020
massacre,

308
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,700
or indiscriminately kill.

309
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:10,300
We won't kill civilians.

310
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,900
We won't kill surrendered Feather Guards
and sorcerers either.

311
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:17,740
From now on, everyone will be equal,
and there will be no more killing.

312
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,660
You can live your lives peacefully.

313
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,020
But you have to surrender

314
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,660
the killer of Mr. Zhan.

315
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:25,460
After you surrender,

316
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,780
everyone can live in peace,

317
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,300
and the world will be at peace.

318
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:32,060
Don't listen to their nonsense.
Shoot them.

319
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:45,140
Miss Ye.

320
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,380
Feather Guards, fire!

321
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,060
Attack.

322
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,340
Attack!

323
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:38,380
Miss Long.

324
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,300
It's too dangerous here.

325
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,340
You should leave now.

326
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,540
I can't.

327
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,900
I'm waiting here for Ye Liuxi.

328
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:46,020
Mr. Long has already given the order.

329
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,820
It's all over.

330
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:47,820
It's too dangerous here.

331
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,660
You need to leave now.

332
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:49,500
Or it'll be too late.

333
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,020
Shut up.

334
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:08,860
Get up!

335
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,780
Quickly!

336
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,580
Charge!

337
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,500
Kill them!

338
00:25:32,420 --> 00:25:33,580
I'm sorry, Miss Long.

339
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:34,660
Forgive me.

340
00:25:34,660 --> 00:25:35,300
Let go of me.

341
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,100
Let's go.

342
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,820
(Once the war starts,)

343
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,540
(there will inevitably
be bloodshed and casualties.)

344
00:25:56,940 --> 00:26:00,060
(My brothers,
who charge into battle with me...)

345
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:02,500
Charge!

346
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:04,300
(Their families)

347
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,780
(and innocent civilians...)

348
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,660
(What should happen to them?)

349
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,740
He!

350
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:26,340
Be careful!

351
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:44,940
The gate is open.

352
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,820
Charge.

353
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:48,500
Hurry.

354
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,220
Charge!

355
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,380
Advance!

356
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,620
Brothers!

357
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,180
Attack!

358
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,980
Charge!

359
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,660
Charge!

360
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:13,260
(I don't want them
to sacrifice themselves for my victory.)

361
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,060
Hurry!

362
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,740
Catch up quickly.

363
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,100
(I need to figure out a way)

364
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,990
(to negotiate with Black Stone City
as soon as possible)

365
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,340
(and end this war peacefully.)

366
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:36,580
Miss Qing!

367
00:27:47,060 --> 00:27:48,140
Don't resist.

368
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,660
We won't harm the innocent.

369
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,060
Don't move.

370
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,220
Crouch down.

371
00:28:01,220 --> 00:28:02,180
Don't move.

372
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:02,780
Crouch down.

373
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:03,660
Crouch down.

374
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:04,490
Drop your weapons.

375
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,940
Don't move.

376
00:28:07,420 --> 00:28:08,020
Stay still.

377
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:08,860
Drop them.

378
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:11,260
Stop.

379
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,180
Don't run. Stay still.

380
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,500
Don't move.

381
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:18,820
Stay still.

382
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,620
Don't move.

383
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:09,820
Everyone.

384
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,980
Given the current situation,

385
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,820
whether it's the Nandou Stars' prophecy,

386
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:15,220
Silver Snake's prophecy,

387
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:17,260
or the state of the conflict,

388
00:29:17,420 --> 00:29:18,500
the outcome is clear.

389
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,620
You all agree, right?

390
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:23,300
How many markets inside the pass

391
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:24,580
have you taken control of?

392
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,580
You just entered Black Stone City.

393
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,540
We can still fight back.

394
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,580
The outcome is clear?

395
00:29:31,900 --> 00:29:32,990
You're saying that too early.

396
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,980
You'll know if something is good or not

397
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,860
by taking a bite.

398
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,260
I don't need
to conquer all of Black Stone City

399
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:40,860
to declare victory.

400
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,260
Since we're here to negotiate a deal,

401
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,020
let's get straight to the point.

402
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:50,820
Alright.

403
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:53,020
I have three conditions.

404
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:56,060
The Silver Silkworms Heartstring,

405
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,340
Jiang Zhan, and Gao Shen.

406
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:00,980
As long as
you can meet all my conditions,

407
00:30:01,660 --> 00:30:04,260
I promise not to harm Black Stone City.

408
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:08,140
By then, Feather Guards and sorcerers

409
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,380
can live peacefully inside the city

410
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,900
without facing exile or extermination

411
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:14,860
like Li Wangdong's case back then,

412
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:18,980
hiding and fleeing like a bereaved dog.

413
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:21,860
What do you think?

414
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:25,340
Miss Ye.

415
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,140
Firstly,

416
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:29,140
the Silver Silkworms Heartstring

417
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:30,660
is lost.

418
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:33,380
As for Gao Shen,

419
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:37,180
he escaped from the mine prison
a few days ago.

420
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,780
Jiang Zhan has no issues.

421
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,180
We can hand him over to you.

422
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:46,380
Three conditions,
and two have fallen through,

423
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,860
one is uncertain.
Can this still be considered a deal?

424
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,380
The Silver Silkworms Heartstring
was lost in the Flowing Sand dunes.

425
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,940
It's in your hands.

426
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:55,420
Yes.

427
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,340
It's in my hands.

428
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,660
But since this Heartstring
wasn't given by you,

429
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:03,940
it can't be counted as your achievement.

430
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,260
What if

431
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,140
I agree to use the Heartstring

432
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:13,180
to save Chang Dong?

433
00:31:18,340 --> 00:31:20,060
Since Mr. Long

434
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:21,460
is so sincere,

435
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:24,020
I'll consider

436
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,340
this condition met.

437
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:38,000
