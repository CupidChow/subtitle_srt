00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:39,220
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:43,620
=Episode 9=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,660
What is this?

4
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,660
It looks like an eye.

5
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:13,340
The sand is falling in a line.

6
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,980
So it's the sand that buried Hui Ba
and the others' bodies.

7
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:42,620
It reminds me of sardines.

8
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,860
Look, the tail looks like sand,

9
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,900
though it doesn't sway with the wind.

10
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,980
They're gathered as one,

11
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,060
yet they're all distinct
from one another.

12
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,740
When the entire thing moves,

13
00:02:54,340 --> 00:02:55,860
it's like a school of sardines.

14
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,580
If it's alive,

15
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,420
it means it can be killed.

16
00:03:09,380 --> 00:03:10,060
Be careful.

17
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,300
Go over there.

18
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,620
Ye Liuxi.

19
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,500
Hurry!

20
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:58,860
Hurry.

21
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,900
Quickly go to the back.

22
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,820
What were you going to cut
with the knife just now?

23
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:36,620
It's to save you.

24
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,060
I know you're trying to save me.

25
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,660
Let me ask you.

26
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,300
Were you trying to cut my leg

27
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,220
or the sand?

28
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,300
It depends on the situation.

29
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,780
Liuxi, let's make it clear right now.

30
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,740
If we encounter a similar situation again, please

31
00:04:55,980 --> 00:04:58,300
try your best
to keep my body parts intact.

32
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,700
You shouldn't make decisions
about my arms, legs,

33
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,660
or any other part of my body
unless I ask for it myself.

34
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:04,620
Is that clear?

35
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,980
Alright. I understand.

36
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,380
Yumen Pass

37
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:37,340
seems to have disappeared.

38
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,140
Let's go take a look.

39
00:05:57,540 --> 00:05:59,300
The earthen platform
for the shadow coffin is gone.

40
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:12,540
So, ghost fire,

41
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:15,140
shadow coffin, and the Abnormal Sand

42
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,340
only exist in another world.

43
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:22,340
Once Yumen Pass closes or disappears,

44
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,540
everything will return to normal.

45
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,860
Look, the aerial footage
we took earlier.

46
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,620
Could it be that the end of Sima Road
is Yumen Pass?

47
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,380
Have you heard
of the Land of Peach Blossoms?

48
00:06:57,740 --> 00:07:00,500
Are you trying to say
that Yumen Pass is a similar place?

49
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,140
The question is, where are the people?

50
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,580
If these two times are
counted as entering the gate,

51
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,740
why haven't we seen a single person?

52
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,700
And who were those supplies for?

53
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,940
Our supplies are running out.

54
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,660
Let's go back to Ying City to rest.

55
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,340
Now that we have experienced,

56
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,140
we'll come better prepared next time.

57
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,940
Fatty Tang,
send the head cook back later.

58
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,380
And don't forget
to report to the police.

59
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:00,700
Three people died.

60
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,340
We should give an account.

61
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,380
(Understood, Dong. I'll report it.)

62
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,580
Coming.

63
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,260
Excuse me, did Mr. Dong from Room 513

64
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,540
ask for a kettle?

65
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,260
You're a staff?

66
00:08:32,420 --> 00:08:34,940
Part-time. I'll be in charge
of all the rooms on this floor tomorrow.

67
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:36,260
I brought you a kettle.

68
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:42,820
There's a shared laundry room downstairs
if you need to do laundry.

69
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:44,180
We have all kinds of laundry detergent.

70
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,660
But you'll have to operate it yourself.

71
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,380
Alright.

72
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:48,180
I'll leave now.

73
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,260
Wishing you a pleasant stay.

74
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:08,000
(Fatty Tang)

75
00:09:08,260 --> 00:09:09,420
(Hey, Fatty Tang.)

76
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:12,620
Dong, I've brought him
to the mahjong center.

77
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,980
What an interesting name it has.

78
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,620
Mahjong Heaven.

79
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:20,840
(Mahjong Heaven)

80
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,200
(Ying City Hotel)

81
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,980
You put your clothes in with mine?

82
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,980
It's to save time,
electricity, water, and money.

83
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,940
I don't want to wait too long.

84
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:56,060
I've set it for a 15 minutes quick wash.
Is that okay?

85
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,260
Sure.

86
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,660
Is Fatty Tang not back yet?

87
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:13,940
He probably made a lot of money
and went somewhere to enjoy himself.

88
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,260
What are you thinking about?

89
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,260
I'm thinking, why is it me?

90
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:42,140
Why is it the both of us?

91
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,380
We're clearly from two different worlds.

92
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:50,060
Why are we connected?

93
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,900
What exactly is
the connection between us?

94
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:53,940
Sounds disgusting.

95
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:56,700
Are you drunk?

96
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,860
I'm getting goosebumps.

97
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,220
I have no idea
what connection I have with you.

98
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:22,500
But if I have to be

99
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:25,220
connected to someone in this world,

100
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:29,060
and if you're that person,

101
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,620
I guess I can accept it.

102
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:42,020
Let's run another cycle.
It'll be cleaner.

103
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,660
Housekeeping.

104
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,500
You really know how to do housekeeping?

105
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,740
What's so hard about it?

106
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,260
An old housekeeper took me
to service a couple of rooms. It's easy.

107
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:31,660
I even tried a few rooms myself.

108
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:33,420
I also asked the guests
if they were satisfied.

109
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,580
They all said they were satisfied.

110
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,020
Some even asked for my phone number,

111
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:38,420
saying it's a pity for me to do this
and they offered me a better job.

112
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,940
Talented people really shine
wherever they go.

113
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,460
Well then, Miss Talent, please come in.

114
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,300
Chang Dong.

115
00:13:52,580 --> 00:13:55,020
Do you know how a civilized hotel guest
is supposed to behave?

116
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,700
When I knock on their door and ask

117
00:13:56,700 --> 00:13:58,820
if they need room service,
they would say, "No, I don't."

118
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,060
I'm not one of those hotel guests,
so I need room cleaning service.

119
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:01,140
When are we going back
to Seadragon Heap?

120
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,140
I haven't decided yet.

121
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,060
Then please hurry.

122
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:12,540
I want to find out where I came from
as soon as possible.

123
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,540
(Fatty Tang)

124
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,620
Hey, Fatty Tang.

125
00:15:34,140 --> 00:15:35,260
(Is Chang Dong speaking?)

126
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:38,660
Who are you?

127
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,060
(My surname is Liu.)

128
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,300
(Liu Qi.)

129
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,220
What is your relationship with Hui Ba?

130
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,660
(Coming straight to the point, huh?)

131
00:15:50,660 --> 00:15:52,300
(Hui Ba and I are from the same town.)

132
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,660
If anything happens, I've got his back.

133
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:57,660
If he strikes it rich,
I'll get a piece of the pie.

134
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,620
So, what do you want with me?

135
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,740
(Don't overthink it, pal.)

136
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:06,020
I just want to chat with you
and ask some questions.

137
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,660
(Hui Ba's men)

138
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,980
(are mostly useless.)

139
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:12,460
(They failed
to bring back his dead body.)

140
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,100
(They also made up a bunch of lies.)

141
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:15,820
(I don't like that.)

142
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:18,220
(So, I want to ask someone
with a sound mind.)

143
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,260
Didn't you give my friend a hard time?

144
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:21,580
(No, we didn't.)

145
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,220
(We kindly invited him over,)

146
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:25,660
but he got a little agitated.

147
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:28,940
He got hurt, but it's not our fault.

148
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,020
Where can we meet?

149
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,740
(Dadongguan.)

150
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,780
There's a mahjong center nearby
called Mahjong Heaven.

151
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,900
I'll be here all afternoon today.

152
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:44,260
Alright. Should I go there alone,
or can I bring someone with me?

153
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,340
It's up to you.

154
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,420
You can bring as many people
as you like.

155
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:59,020
(Mahjong Heaven)

156
00:17:03,620 --> 00:17:05,260
Qi, they're here.

157
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:06,980
Dong.

158
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,700
Sit down.

159
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:10,020
Have a seat.

160
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:10,740
Liuxi.

161
00:17:11,260 --> 00:17:12,820
(Liu Qi)
Look at you, you're so useless.

162
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,460
Next time, if you get chased by a dog,

163
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,020
you should first assess the situation.

164
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,060
Fight only if you can.

165
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:22,060
If you can't, pretend to be helpless
and put on a smile.

166
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,460
Once it lets its guard down,

167
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,740
smash it with a brick

168
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,700
as hard as you can. Understand?

169
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,020
Got it.

170
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,460
You're really embarrassing me.

171
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:32,940
Sorry for the trouble.

172
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:37,140
Sit down.

173
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,740
You must be Miss Ye, right?

174
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:45,940
I've not been
in this business for years.

175
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,700
There are people who got on the list,

176
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:51,020
and I didn't care much about it.

177
00:17:51,460 --> 00:17:52,700
But over these past couple of days,

178
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,460
I've asked around about your background.

179
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,660
Hurry up. It's your turn.

180
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:11,700
I heard that you'd been
robbed three times

181
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,980
while driving a Dongfeng van.

182
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,500
But you got out of them unscathed.

183
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,820
You even boasted

184
00:18:21,540 --> 00:18:22,900
that there's no pass that you,

185
00:18:22,900 --> 00:18:24,460
Ye Liuxi, can't go through.

186
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,300
You talk pretty big.

187
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,580
It's a no man's land, after all.

188
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,260
You, a lone woman with a van,

189
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,220
are bound
to come across all sorts of things.

190
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,460
It would've been inconvenient
without something to defend yourself.

191
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,020
Otherwise, you wouldn't
have made the list.

192
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,820
But this is the city,

193
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:47,220
and we must follow the rules
when doing business.

194
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:51,700
Yeah.

195
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:53,260
You're right.

196
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:57,020
So, Qi, would you mind
lending us a first aid kit?

197
00:18:57,020 --> 00:18:59,460
Otherwise, if we go outside
and someone sees us,

198
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,060
they might think
we got beaten up in here.

199
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:02,260
It'll affect your business.

200
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,260
I'll hold this tile.

201
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,420
Whose turn is it?

202
00:19:10,060 --> 00:19:11,020
Whose turn is it now?

203
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,260
Let me do it.

204
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:17,900
Hui Ba's men and my friend

205
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,220
should have clarified the situation.

206
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,580
So, what do you want with us this time?

207
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:24,380
Huo Ya told me

208
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:27,180
that Hui Ba got killed
by a flying iron shovel.

209
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:28,900
When I asked

210
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:31,300
why they didn't
bring back his dead body,

211
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,460
he said the body was gone.
Can you believe that?

212
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,740
So, Qi, what do you think happened?

213
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:40,020
In my opinion,

214
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,060
they must have
dug up something valuable.

215
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,060
I have experienced

216
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:44,940
this kind of thing many times before.

217
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,700
When people get greedy,
they do bad things.

218
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,220
Qi.

219
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,140
But that doesn't make sense.

220
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,340
Huo Ya could have easily

221
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,620
fabricated a more plausible story.

222
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,340
Now that both of you

223
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,260
are here with the same story,

224
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,500
my conclusion is

225
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:08,060
that this

226
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,020
is true.

227
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,220
Since it's true,

228
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,060
we may leave now, right?

229
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:17,740
Don't go yet.
I'm almost winning the game.

230
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:20,060
Miss Ye, there's no hurry
in finishing this game.

231
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:23,620
Don't you have to treat
Fatty Tang's wounds?

232
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:25,860
Let me tell you all a story.

233
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:29,620
It happened

234
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,580
nearly 30 years ago.

235
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:32,760
(30 years ago)

236
00:20:32,860 --> 00:20:36,020
I was preparing to leave the desert

237
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,020
and return to Ying City that day.

238
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:39,620
On my way back,

239
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:41,940
I came across several trucks.

240
00:20:42,820 --> 00:20:46,380
They were loaded with goods
that were shining with gold.

241
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:50,500
Just when I was about
to take a closer look...

242
00:21:11,660 --> 00:21:12,460
Let's continue our game.

243
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:15,860
It's been so many years since then,

244
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,820
but I can never forget

245
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:20,380
the shadow puppet driving the truck.

246
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:23,220
I wanted to go back there
to take a look,

247
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:24,740
but I didn't have the courage.

248
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:27,220
I remember
there were nine trucks in total.

249
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,860
Huo Ya told me

250
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,300
that when the shadow coffin was opened,

251
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:36,540
you counted the shadow puppets,
and there were nine of them as well.

252
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,980
You see,

253
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:43,340
it turns out that I already
have something to do with this.

254
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:45,820
How about this?

255
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,060
Let's be frank with each other.

256
00:21:48,460 --> 00:21:50,980
Qi, what do you want?

257
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:52,220
Tell me your purpose,

258
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,460
and I'll weigh the pros and cons.

259
00:21:53,660 --> 00:21:55,820
If it can be done, we'll be friends.

260
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:57,060
If it can't be done,

261
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:58,100
we'll follow the rules.

262
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,700
Either we make peace over dinner

263
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:03,260
or mark our respective territories.
What do you think?

264
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,460
Hui Ba's dead body
has to be collected.

265
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,100
I have to honor my friendship with him.

266
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,940
Qi.

267
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:27,980
That's not very nice of you.

268
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,780
Sorry for this.

269
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,900
It's a habit of mine
to probe into people's secrets.

270
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,860
That being said,

271
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:38,020
it taught both of you
a lesson, didn't it?

272
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
One should be careful when doing things.

273
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,340
Don't give others any opportunity
to take advantage of you.

274
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,180
You searched my room, too?

275
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,220
Miss Ye, your stuff

276
00:22:55,300 --> 00:22:56,580
is quite interesting.

277
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,460
Both of you are capable people,

278
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,780
and working with capable people
requires sincerity.

279
00:23:10,420 --> 00:23:12,220
So, here's my suggestion.

280
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Let's see if it's feasible.

281
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:17,660
I provide the capital,
and you provide the effort.

282
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,620
I don't have high demands.

283
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:21,180
One.

284
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:22,620
Retrieve Hui Ba's body.

285
00:23:23,020 --> 00:23:23,540
Two.

286
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:27,060
Help me unravel the mystery
of the shadow puppet troupe.

287
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,540
If you can do that,

288
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:31,180
everything on the vehicle belongs to me.

289
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:32,420
Qi.

290
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,780
Actually...

291
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:34,820
I win.

292
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,900
- This matter...
- Sure.

293
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,020
I like taking other people's money

294
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:43,900
to do my own thing.

295
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:53,300
Since it's settled,

296
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,340
we need to open up our hearts

297
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,940
to build rapport.

298
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,660
Eating and drinking

299
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,380
are essential.

300
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:03,100
It's not troublesome.

301
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,900
Let's eat here.

302
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,380
Later,

303
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:08,780
I'll introduce two friends to you.

304
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,180
Do you really plan to take his money?

305
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,380
Why not?

306
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,300
We can't miss out on free money.

307
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,020
Some money can't just be taken.

308
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,060
Don't just look at the immediate gain.
What if it's illegal?

309
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:33,700
Then it's on his poor judgment
for investing in the wrong stocks.

310
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,260
What does that have to do with me?

311
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,620
Where are your manners?

312
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:05,340
I'm hungry.

313
00:25:07,140 --> 00:25:08,660
Let me introduce you.

314
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:12,980
This is my goddaughter.

315
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:14,460
(Ding Liu)
Ding Liu.

316
00:25:14,460 --> 00:25:15,100
(Ding Liu)
Liu.

317
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,780
(Gao Shen)
This is Gao Shen.

318
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,420
(Gao Shen)

319
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,500
He works for me.

320
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:23,420
This is what I'm thinking.

321
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,700
We just met,

322
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:28,140
and we don't trust each other much.

323
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,780
If I invest my money,

324
00:25:30,780 --> 00:25:33,260
and you guys create chaos

325
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,340
but then come back telling me,

326
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:37,140
"Qi, we didn't find anything",

327
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,180
I'll feel

328
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,060
uneasy about it.

329
00:25:41,420 --> 00:25:42,340
So,

330
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:45,220
I'm sending two people as well.

331
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:45,980
Don't worry.

332
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,540
They can be of help.

333
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,580
They won't be a burden.

334
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:53,220
Liu is very capable.

335
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:56,980
When she takes care of the business for me,
no one causes trouble.

336
00:25:58,900 --> 00:25:59,820
Qi.

337
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,940
You know what happened to Hui Ba.

338
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,340
So it's understandable
if you want to keep an eye on us.

339
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,940
But sending your goddaughter

340
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,700
is too much, isn't it?

341
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,980
I'm getting old.

342
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,300
In the past two years,
I've been hesitating

343
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:18,820
whether or not
to hand over my current affairs to Liu.

344
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,860
She lacks experience.

345
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,100
A jade needs to be polished
to become valuable.

346
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,580
If she succeeds,
it's her own achievement.

347
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:25,540
If she fails outside,

348
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:26,940
then I'll accept it.

349
00:26:27,340 --> 00:26:28,940
After all,
she's not my biological daughter.

350
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:31,780
Alright, both of them can come.

351
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:32,940
But there's one thing.

352
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,340
They need to know who's in charge.

353
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,740
We can have assistance,

354
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,180
but we don't need leaders.

355
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,140
That's for sure.

356
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,420
You guys do everything you want.

357
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,580
As for this buddy here,

358
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:45,220
I can take care of him for you.

359
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:50,980
Qi...

360
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:54,020
Chang Dong, pass me a lamb chop.

361
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:55,580
A big one. I can't reach it.

362
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,340
Liuxi.

363
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,460
What are you calling me for?

364
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,020
You decide what you want to do,

365
00:27:18,020 --> 00:27:19,580
and you speak for yourself.

366
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,580
You're not even speaking up yourself.

367
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,260
Why should others rush?

368
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,500
I can't stay here.

369
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,580
Speak louder. I can't hear you.

370
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,540
I won't stay here.

371
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,380
I don't need your supervision.

372
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,740
Qi.

373
00:27:47,660 --> 00:27:49,420
Indeed, Fatty Tang is not suitable
to stay here.

374
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,820
You see, he was born in Li City,
from a family of antique enthusiasts.

375
00:27:52,820 --> 00:27:55,220
Those bronzes and pottery,
he can casually take a look,

376
00:27:55,220 --> 00:27:56,380
weigh them,

377
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,780
and know which dynasty they belong to,

378
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:58,940
whether they are valuable or not.

379
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,020
Oh, Fatty Tang, you told me

380
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:04,300
you are a member

381
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,460
of that Antique Appraisal
and Evaluation Committee, right?

382
00:28:06,980 --> 00:28:08,180
You're a member of it, right?

383
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:08,980
That's right.

384
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:10,780
I joined last year.

385
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:11,980
That's why, Qi.

386
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,020
Aren't you looking
for the shadow puppet troupe?

387
00:28:15,020 --> 00:28:17,340
If we don't have any experts
on this trip,

388
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:20,140
we might return without any results.

389
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,460
Don't get angry by then.

390
00:28:25,780 --> 00:28:27,180
Alright, let's drink.

391
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:30,460
Consider it settled.

392
00:28:30,460 --> 00:28:31,900
Starting tomorrow,

393
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:34,380
Gao Shen and Ding Liu will follow

394
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,460
the two of you.

395
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,220
Come, let's drink.

396
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,580
Do you think those two
are difficult to handle?

397
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:02,260
Qi said that both of them
are formidable players.

398
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,420
So, we need to be careful.

399
00:29:05,220 --> 00:29:06,140
Don't act recklessly.

400
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,140
Chang Dong and that girl

401
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:10,620
are a couple.

402
00:29:10,620 --> 00:29:11,420
Is that so?

403
00:29:12,780 --> 00:29:13,660
I couldn't tell.

404
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,620
Only a blockhead like you
couldn't see it.

405
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,460
So what if they are a couple?

406
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,180
Then it's easy to handle.

407
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:25,340
It's too easy to make a couple
turn against each other.

408
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,260
Go and take a look.

Later,

421
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:41,180
I'll go and meet Chang Dong.

422
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:47,820
Actually, when I carefully thought
about everything,

423
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:49,940
perhaps entering the Sima Road

424
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,140
doesn't count as entering the pass.

425
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,780
Then, what is the Sima Road?

426
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,740
This Sima Road,

427
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:57,060
perhaps, it's the necessary path
to enter the pass.

428
00:30:57,540 --> 00:30:59,740
But all of this is related to you.

429
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,380
Let's assume,

430
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,900
that every time you enter the pass,

431
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,460
you have to go through blood,
sandstorms, and the Sima Road.

432
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:09,420
But in the sandstorm, it's hard for people
to see the main road clearly.

433
00:31:09,420 --> 00:31:11,460
People lose their partners, vehicles,

434
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:12,620
and direction.

435
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:13,660
These

436
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,740
seem more like
a defensive protection mechanism,

437
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:17,580
driving away those
who mistakenly enter this place.

438
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:19,380
They'd run away out of fear

439
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,020
and even spread the word,

440
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:23,180
reminding future generations
to stay away from this place.

441
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,260
Fatty Tang is an example.

442
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,580
He was so scared

443
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:28,860
that he couldn't even find his way back
the next day.

444
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:31,940
As of now,

445
00:31:31,940 --> 00:31:33,540
we still haven't found
where entrance of the pass is.

446
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:34,620
But we can be certain

447
00:31:35,140 --> 00:31:37,980
that this Sima Road
has become an important area.

448
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:41,180
Shadow coffin. Strange eye.

449
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,060
Only I was attacked, not you.

450
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,780
Perhaps that is
because I'm from inside the pass.

451
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:48,140
So, whether it's the sand or the eyes,

452
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,980
they all tend to be lenient toward me.

453
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,540
And that song,

454
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,380
"One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry".

455
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,580
Up to now,

456
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,740
we can only be sure

457
00:31:57,740 --> 00:32:00,260
that the shadow puppets
come from inside the pass.

458
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:02,820
If you really are from inside the pass,

459
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,620
then you're not just
an ordinary person from inside.

460
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,000
