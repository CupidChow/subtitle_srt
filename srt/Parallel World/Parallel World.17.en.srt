1
00:00:29,260 --> 00:00:30,460
Walk quickly.

2
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:33,140
Walk. Hurry.

3
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,820
Come on. Walk.

4
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:37,620
I told you.

5
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,140
You'll know one day.

6
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,620
Between two Lingzhi mushrooms,

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,140
who's the weed, who's the immortal.

8
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,020
Miss Qing, Lord Zhan.

9
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,820
Everything is ready.

10
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:34,820
We can move anytime.

11
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,200
Most of the people

12
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:44,120
in Yellow Soil City have already fled.

13
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,680
The market doesn't have much.

14
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:47,630
Qingzhi.

15
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,600
Taking this city down is nothing

16
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:51,550
compared
to you stepping out of the pass.

17
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,960
Zhao Guanshou is
guarding the entrance of the pass.

18
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,550
If I leave the pass, it will alert him.

19
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:59,960
It will delay our mission
in Black Stone City.

20
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,150
Let's wait and see.

21
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:25,700
(Jiang Zhan)

22
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:35,110
This time around,

23
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,510
I will make Black Stone City
pay in blood.

24
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:15,280
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

25
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:18,100
=Episode 17=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

26
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,710
Can you do me a favor?

27
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,000
Can you help me draft something?

28
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:54,880
I want to make a sheath for this knife.

29
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,030
Don't worry.
I'm not asking you to make it.

30
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll buy some leather tomorrow
and make it myself

31
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:04,760
based on your draft.

32
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,760
What kind do you want?

33
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:14,240
A nice one.

34
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:16,070
I mean,

35
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:17,710
how do you want to hang the knife?

36
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,630
Hang it here.

37
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,270
And then,

38
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:33,440
you can put a leg strap here.

39
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:35,030
Why a leg strap?

40
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,390
The knife is heavy.

41
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,680
This way, it can balance a bit.

42
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,830
Wait for me a moment.

43
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,950
Come with me.

44
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,270
Why?

45
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:08,360
To take the measurements.

46
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,930
The measuring tape is in the car.

47
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:11,390
Is it necessary?

48
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,710
If it's too long, I'll just cut it.

49
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:15,470
What if it's too short?

50
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:16,120
Extend it?

51
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,390
Come on.

52
00:07:54,030 --> 00:07:54,880
How do you measure?

53
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:57,950
Well,

54
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,950
open your coat.

55
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,440
What's the matter?

56
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:26,880
Come.

57
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:33,110
Stand straight.

58
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,280
Spread your arms.

59
00:08:59,070 --> 00:09:00,320
When do you plan to tell me

60
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,070
that you like me?

61
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,400
What?

62
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
With your personality,

63
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,110
if I wait for you to say it,

64
00:09:12,110 --> 00:09:13,400
how long do I have to wait?

65
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,590
Maybe you feel

66
00:09:14,590 --> 00:09:16,070
that Kong Yang's matter
has just been settled,

67
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:17,640
so now is not the best time.

68
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,560
But I'm the type
who likes to be straightforward.

69
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,950
If I like you today,

70
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:23,680
I'll feel restless

71
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
if I don't say it today.

72
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,800
Having a secret crush is not my style.

73
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,160
If you wait half a year,

74
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,750
I won't be able
to survive those six months.

75
00:09:35,590 --> 00:09:37,800
So, I found a compromise.

76
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,830
Let's each take a step back

77
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,830
and respect each other.

78
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,800
I'll adjust to your pace.

79
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,870
You'll make me feel at ease in my heart.

80
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:54,870
Just admit that you like me.

81
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,320
Then, we'll go at your pace.

82
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:00,160
Is that okay?

83
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,350
Liuxi.

84
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:15,320
Is it that difficult?

85
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,520
It's not against your heart.

86
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,920
If I say it, we have to move forward.

87
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,680
If I don't say it,
we can still back away.

88
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:24,470
Why back away?

89
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,470
You do whatever you like.

90
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,590
You never think ahead.

91
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:32,680
But, Liuxi,

92
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:34,590
I can't afford to like you.

93
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:36,750
I'm not a threat.

94
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,990
Have you never thought about it?

95
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,710
Let's not consider other things.

96
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,870
Up till now,
your memory still hasn't come back yet.

97
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:48,830
If

98
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,590
you truly have a lover

99
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:53,680
and one day, you do remember your past

100
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:54,710
and reunite with your lover,

101
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,870
what about me?

102
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:56,950
Where should I go?

103
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,300
I haven't finished measuring.

104
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,660
Dong, Liuxi.

105
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,940
Liu has regained her consciousness.

106
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,380
The doctor is with her now.

107
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,300
Fatty Tang, wake up.

108
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,100
Liu woke up.

109
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:40,900
Do you have a headache?

110
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:42,500
No.

111
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:43,900
How about your body?

112
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,940
Do you feel anything?

113
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:46,060
No, I don't feel anything.

114
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,980
Can you tell me what number this is?

115
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:51,620
Four.

116
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,180
Two.

117
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,220
One.

118
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,660
Did I get them right?

119
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:05,060
She has overcome
the most challenging phase.

120
00:12:05,540 --> 00:12:07,580
She just has to get one more checkup

121
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,980
in Black Stone City after this.

122
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,740
The next few days are crucial.

123
00:12:11,140 --> 00:12:12,020
Make sure she rests well.

124
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:12,740
Okay.

125
00:12:12,740 --> 00:12:13,260
Thank you.

126
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:16,380
- Thank you, doctor.
- Don't mention it.

127
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,020
Don't get too happy too soon.

128
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,260
Maybe this is
just a temporary improvement.

129
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,500
Nonsense.

130
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:25,980
Liuxi.

131
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:27,740
Don't yell at me.

132
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,180
I can't bear your scolding
with my current condition.

133
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:32,740
Alright.

134
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:34,620
Your head is
more precious than gold now.

135
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,740
Liuxi, you don't seem happy.

136
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,820
Did someone upset you?

137
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:43,580
No.

138
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,140
I'm just worried about you.

139
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,660
That's touching, Liuxi.

140
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:52,780
But don't make me too emotional either.

141
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:56,220
I can't handle emotions right now.

142
00:12:58,300 --> 00:12:59,100
Liu.

143
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:01,180
You'll get better.

144
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,620
Look at me.

145
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:04,100
My eyes have already healed.

146
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,020
I'm sorry.

147
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,020
Liuxi.

148
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:22,980
Listen to me.

149
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,140
What do you want to say?

150
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,700
Do you think I didn't understand?

151
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,500
Your hidden message.

152
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:29,580
I've understood it all.

153
00:13:29,580 --> 00:13:30,700
What else do you want to say?

154
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:35,900
If there's nothing more,

155
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:38,700
I'm heading to bed now.

156
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:02,740
(You do whatever you like.)

157
00:14:02,740 --> 00:14:04,140
You never think ahead.

158
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:05,300
But, Liuxi,

159
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:07,140
I can't afford to like you.

160
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,980
(Have you never thought about it?)

161
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,820
Up till now,
your memory still hasn't come back yet.

162
00:14:54,820 --> 00:14:55,540
If

163
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:59,020
you truly have a lover,

164
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,740
and one day, you do remember your past

165
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:02,740
and reunite with your lover,

166
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,660
what about me?

167
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:05,100
Where should I go?

168
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,100
What are you doing?

169
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:29,260
Since Liu is much better now,

170
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:31,700
Liuxi says
it's safer for us to live together.

171
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Live together?

172
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,220
Sure.

173
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:38,500
The rooster is guarding us,
so it's safe.

174
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:39,900
Gao.

175
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:40,940
Come over here.

176
00:15:41,180 --> 00:15:42,100
I have a question for you.

177
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,380
Take a seat.

178
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,420
What is it?

179
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:53,540
What's the situation
between you and Liu?

180
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:56,820
Other couples
have on-and-off relationships.

181
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:59,620
But for you two, it doesn't seem like
you are ever together.

182
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,020
We're not lovers.

183
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,260
Qi arranged for me to protect her,

184
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,690
but she hates it
when I try to look after her.

185
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
What do you think about her, though?

186
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,420
I

187
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,700
don't know.

188
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,340
Alright.

189
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:19,940
If you have nothing to do,

190
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,020
come with me to buy gasoline.

191
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:25,100
You're not telling the truth.

192
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,060
I really don't know.

193
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,140
Liuxi.

194
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:46,300
You're here to help me pack up?

195
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,580
That's great.

196
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,760
Better than waking up
and seeing that person immediately.

197
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:54,180
Liuxi.

198
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,740
Come sit with me for a chat.

199
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,580
Stay with me for a while.

200
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:04,420
Here. Take a seat.

201
00:17:14,940 --> 00:17:16,660
What's the deal with you and Gao Shen?

202
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,740
My head.

203
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:22,100
Can you please not mention
that annoying person?

204
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,060
I have a headache.

205
00:17:23,060 --> 00:17:25,620
If you really don't like him, tell him.

206
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:27,500
You can find another man,

207
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,820
so he will give up on you.

208
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,060
I wish I could.

209
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,980
But Dong doesn't like me.

210
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,100
Try harder.

211
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,260
Liuxi.

212
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:38,540
Are you making fun of me?

213
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:39,620
He's already yours,

214
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,700
and you tell me to try harder?

215
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,780
When did he become mine?

216
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,020
Isn't it obvious?

217
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,700
Liuxi.

218
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:49,140
Dong is a bit reserved,

219
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,180
but this reservedness

220
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:51,940
is much better than being a playboy.

221
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,860
You wouldn't like it if he was a playboy
who flirted with everyone.

222
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,580
I'm not exaggerating it.

223
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,060
I've seen it all.

224
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,740
What's a reserved person like?

225
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,700
Just like Dong.

226
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,340
He doesn't easily fall in love.

227
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,700
Even if he does, he hides it.

228
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:11,380
But, once he gets serious about it,

229
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:12,980
he will make it happen.

230
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,580
Doesn't Gao Shen fit this description,
too?

231
00:18:18,580 --> 00:18:19,700
He?

232
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,540
He and Dong

233
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,580
are not even on the same level, okay?

234
00:18:24,060 --> 00:18:25,380
Don't get worked up.

235
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:26,580
You still have an injury.

236
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:28,540
If you don't want to say,
we can discuss it later.

237
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,660
No.

238
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,700
Let's talk about it now.

239
00:18:30,700 --> 00:18:31,740
Actually,

240
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:36,140
his father owes a debt of gratitude
to my godfather.

241
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:38,860
When his father fell seriously ill,

242
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:42,740
my godfather
covered his father's medical expenses.

243
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,460
Gao Shen was grateful for that,

244
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,780
so he became my godfather's bodyguard.

245
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:51,300
When I first saw him,
he looked quite handsome.

246
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,940
I called him Shen a few times,

247
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,860
which was what young girls do
when they have a crush.

248
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:57,660
He didn't pay much attention
to me though.

249
00:18:58,660 --> 00:18:59,900
Then one day,

250
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,140
I heard

251
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,980
my godfather asking Gao Shen

252
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,260
to marry me

253
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:06,540
when I grow up.

254
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:08,460
Isn't it ridiculous?

255
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:09,420
This is the modern era,

256
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:11,460
and my godfather
is still considering arranged marriages.

257
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
What happened after that?

258
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,940
After that,

259
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,020
Gao Shen suddenly

260
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,460
started being nice to me.

261
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,580
Liuxi.

262
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:26,380
To be honest,

263
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:28,660
if Gao Shen had just
confronted my godfather

264
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,740
and told the latter that he would
only marry the one he loved,

265
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:32,900
I would have respected him.

266
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,260
Now,

267
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,980
what is this?

268
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:41,780
Perhaps he hasn't even figured out

269
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:44,300
his true feelings yet.

270
00:19:59,660 --> 00:20:00,860
Getting gasoline is

271
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:02,100
as difficult as reaching the sky.

272
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:04,740
I exchanged a large pile of money
for only two boxes.

273
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,980
And I can't get them now.

274
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,180
I'll have to wait until tonight
to pick them up.

275
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,140
You're all right now?

276
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,620
That's quite funny.

277
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,460
Those people were
watching a movie over there.

278
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,460
I asked them, "What kind of movie
are you watching?"

279
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,340
"Is there a movie
with monsters and demons?"

280
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,460
They scolded me.

281
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,780
They said the days are tough,

282
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,020
yet I asked for movies
with monsters and demons.

283
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:25,340
Didn't you deserve this?

284
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,300
What we don't lack here
are monsters and demons.

285
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:29,740
Didn't you find something
more interesting?

286
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,180
I did.

287
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,660
I saw a damaged statue
of a lady.

288
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,140
I was wondering how it ended up
like that.

289
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,180
It's missing arms and legs.

290
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:40,900
But it's okay.

291
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:41,820
It's the Eastern Venus.

292
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:42,980
I can sell it for a good price.

293
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,140
What is the Eastern Venus?

294
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:47,700
That's for another day.

295
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,540
Liuxi.

296
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,460
Let's sell Valley Guardian.

297
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,820
Why did you bring up the rooster

298
00:20:59,180 --> 00:21:00,540
all of a sudden?

299
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:02,260
We need money right now.

300
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,260
I heard

301
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:06,740
the chickens here
died from fowl plague recently.

302
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:09,980
Surely, now is the time Valley Guardian
is most valuable.

303
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,460
Why don't you ask for its permission?

304
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:13,660
I have to notify it even about this?

305
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,380
Liu.

306
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,060
Why are you out of bed?

307
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,380
I am here for some fresh air.

308
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,020
Did you tell the doctor?

309
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,020
The doctor said it's okay.
I'll just have to be careful.

310
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,700
How do you feel?

311
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:28,860
I don't feel anything right now.

312
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,100
But Dong,

313
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:32,620
I can't shake this constant worry

314
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,420
about "blood clot compressing nerves"

315
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:36,100
and "premature onset of dementia".

316
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,540
It feels like they're all
waiting for me down the road.

317
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,140
Don't think like that.

318
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,300
Didn't the doctor say you're fine?

319
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,220
You're perfectly fine now.

320
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,660
You are the most important right now.

321
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,340
If you have any requests,
just let us know.

322
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,260
We'll rest for another two days,

323
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,100
and then we'll head to Black Stone City.

324
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,620
Dong.

325
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,140
Who are you peeling this for?

326
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:15,980
Liuxi, what's wrong?

327
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,300
I'll check it out.

328
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:19,300
Stay here.

329
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:19,860
Okay.

330
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:43,700
Get onto the bed.

331
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:26,780
Gao Shen!

332
00:25:26,980 --> 00:25:27,780
Liuxi!

333
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,580
Liuxi.

334
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:43,180
You guys head out first.

335
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,180
Liuxi.

336
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,500
Liuxi!

337
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,140
Get to the rooftop.

338
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,300
Let's go.

339
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:20,820
Where's my knife?

340
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:21,540
Huh?

341
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:24,100
I'll fetch it.

342
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:24,780
Here, take this.

343
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:28,980
Come on, Liu.

344
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:29,860
Hurry up.

345
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:30,620
Don't be afraid.

346
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Come on.

347
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,380
Hurry up!

348
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:33,820
Just jump!

349
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,900
Don't be afraid. I'll catch you.

350
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:40,140
Fatty Tang.

351
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,260
Get in the car! Liu, you get in first.

352
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:42,220
Get in!

353
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,260
Gao Shen!

354
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,140
Hurry up!

355
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,180
Watch out, Liuxi!

356
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:51,660
Where is Dong?

357
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,740
Let me do it.

358
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,620
They're catching up with us!

359
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,300
Come on, drive faster!

360
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,300
Watch out!

361
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,660
I'll burn you all.

362
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:09,540
I'll burn you all to death.

363
00:28:23,140 --> 00:28:24,500
They're right behind us!

364
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:26,180
Hurry! They're catching up!

365
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:33,380
Drive through them.

366
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,540
Liuxi.

367
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:18,920
(Camellia)

368
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:23,260
Camellia?

369
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:03,580
