00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,720
=Episode 11=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

4
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,040
What are these?

5
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:05,570
Why is the sky so dark?

6
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,570
Is it nighttime?

7
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,320
Be careful.

8
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:23,970
What is that?

9
00:03:25,970 --> 00:03:26,920
I'll go check.

10
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:27,600
No.

11
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,690
Don't move.

12
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,690
There's a sound coming from the roof.

13
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:42,890
What's going on?

14
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:13,690
Let's go.

15
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,050
Will that thing follow us?

16
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:27,080
Who knows?

17
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:28,580
I've checked it. It's not following us.

18
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:30,100
We should be
out of Seadragon Heap by now.

19
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:31,690
We've been driving for so long

20
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,050
but haven't seen any new Yardangs.

21
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,840
Something's not right.

22
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,960
Do you want some candy?

23
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:39,160
Look.

24
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:47,890
We should already enter the pass now.

25
00:04:55,490 --> 00:04:58,280
I've never seen
such a beautiful night sky.

26
00:04:58,570 --> 00:05:00,320
The moon inside the pass is so big.

27
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,840
The stars are so close to us.

28
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:04,930
I didn't see any pass entrance or such.

29
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,160
Let's take it one step at a time.

30
00:05:07,890 --> 00:05:10,160
Let's find a path and some water.

31
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,610
There will be an oasis if there is water,

32
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,960
and we'll find people
around the oasis.

33
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,570
I'll check the car.

34
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:31,930
Liuxi.

35
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:33,200
I know you want to go back,

36
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,200
but we can't find the exit now.

37
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,400
Don't worry.

38
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,130
If there's real danger,
I'll look out for you.

39
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,960
Don't tease me.

40
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,130
I've figured it out.

41
00:05:41,130 --> 00:05:42,320
In a situation like earlier,

42
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,810
with one or two more of those creatures,

43
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:45,050
everyone can only save themselves.

44
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:45,720
I understand.

45
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,460
Then, why did you come looking for me?

46
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,200
I want to become stronger.

47
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:52,760
Is there still time?

48
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:54,890
There's time.

49
00:05:54,890 --> 00:05:55,370
Three steps.

50
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,490
Three steps?

51
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,960
- First step.
- Take a picture of me.

52
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,760
You need to believe that you are strong.

53
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,720
Even if you're weak,
you need to believe yourself.

54
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:02,720
Second.

55
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,320
You need to be confident.

56
00:06:04,450 --> 00:06:05,370
You may not win the fight,

57
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,320
but you should still

58
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,840
snatch, tear, pinch, grab and kick.

59
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,890
Do you know
confidence can intimidate people?

60
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,400
I understand.

61
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,080
You understand.

62
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,810
Now, show me.

63
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,760
- Roar.
- Roar.

64
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:15,680
- Tear.
- Tear.

65
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,240
- Pinch.
- Pinch.

66
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,000
- Grab.
- Grab.

67
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
- Kick.
- Kick.

68
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:18,810
Roar.

69
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:21,280
Tear.

70
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:22,130
Tear.

71
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:22,840
Pinch.

72
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:23,490
Pinch.

73
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:24,400
Grab.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,370
Grab.

75
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:25,960
Kick.

76
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:26,720
Kick.

77
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,890
Even if you can't fight,

78
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:30,080
you need to find ways to hurt it.

79
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,160
That would be helpful. Understand?

80
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,570
Yes.

81
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:33,760
The third step. You are truly strong.

82
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,400
Liuxi.

83
00:06:34,450 --> 00:06:35,960
I want to learn the third step directly.

84
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:40,780
It's good enough if you can
master the first two steps quickly.

85
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:41,520
Let's go.

86
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,660
Even if you're not fully strong,
being half strong is great too.

87
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,280
Let's go, Fatty Tang.

88
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,720
I want to become stronger, Dong.

89
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,130
(Abandoned Village)

90
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:56,200
There's a village up ahead.

91
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:57,760
Let's go and take a look.

92
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,570
It's abandoned.

93
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:26,050
This place is abnormal.

94
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,640
It's too quiet.

95
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,690
Was that thing just now alive?

96
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,280
Could it also be coming this way?

97
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:40,760
Let me tell you.

98
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,720
It might be
hiding in one of these houses.

99
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,130
If it had that kind of intelligence,

100
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,250
it wouldn't have
charged toward a moving car.

101
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:50,810
Looks like
we'll be staying here tonight.

102
00:07:51,890 --> 00:07:52,640
Later,

103
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,200
let's check all around this place.

104
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,130
Gao Shen.

105
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,280
Go find a wooden stick and make a torch.

106
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,490
Okay. I'll go look for one.

107
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:29,890
Don't we have flashlights?

108
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:31,280
Why are we using torches?

109
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,090
Some things are afraid of fire

110
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:35,490
but not of light.

111
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,210
Chang Dong.

112
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:44,280
Run, Fries!

113
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:47,800
Be careful!

114
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:48,850
Grab him!

115
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,160
There's still one more!

116
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,280
Stop!

117
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,730
Hurry!

118
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,400
Go!

119
00:09:59,130 --> 00:09:59,920
It's a person!

120
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,970
What's the situation, Gao Shen?

121
00:10:04,330 --> 00:10:05,160
We caught him.

122
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,010
It's a human.

123
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:20,280
I'll kill you!

124
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,010
I'll kill you!

125
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:22,440
I...

126
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,560
I'll kill you!

127
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,640
It's a woman!

128
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:28,130
Who?

129
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,210
It's a woman.

130
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:29,920
A woman.

131
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,520
That's enough.

132
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,610
She's really a woman.

133
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,760
Alright.

134
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:43,490
Take her away, Liu.

135
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:43,970
Let's go.

136
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:47,760
Even a woman can fight so fiercely.

137
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:52,130
It's a good thing
Dong and Liuxi aren't here.

138
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,400
Otherwise, they'll know
I can't even fight a woman.

139
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:00,560
Why are you three hiding?

140
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,520
They say people
who drive a vehicle are bad.

141
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,560
Can't we be afraid?

142
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,920
Can you put out the fire?

143
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:15,220
No one will survive
if it attracts the sand people here.

144
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,560
You do the questioning.

145
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,210
All three of them
are from inside the pass.

146
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,210
Don't say too much.

147
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
Speak nicely.

148
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:43,090
The three of you.

149
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,610
Choose a representative,
and let's have a chat.

150
00:11:56,340 --> 00:11:58,160
(Old Qian)

151
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,970
Don't worry.

152
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:00,610
We'll just chat.

153
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,090
After that,
we'll each go our separate ways

154
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:03,400
without troubling each other.

155
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,340
(He)

156
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,370
Really?

157
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,240
You have an elderly and a child here.

158
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:16,370
The three of you together won't beat me.

159
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,260
If I wanted to fight you,
I would have done it earlier.

160
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,090
Now I'm talking to you calmly.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,730
It's called sincerity, understand?

162
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,370
I'm the kind of person

163
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,760
who usually trades sincerity
for sincerity.

164
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,560
If that doesn't work,

165
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,130
then I'll have to use my knife.

166
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,740
(Fries)

167
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,920
My name is He.

168
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,890
This is Fries,

169
00:13:08,890 --> 00:13:10,250
and this is Old Qian, a fortune teller.

170
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:12,540
Why aren't you sleeping?
It's late at night.

171
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,660
Why are you hiding
in this broken house?

172
00:13:14,850 --> 00:13:16,160
We were sleeping.

173
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,010
We heard a commotion
so we came out.

174
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:19,520
Who knew you'd come straight to us?

175
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:20,730
You were sleeping?

176
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:22,160
Where?

177
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:39,400
Alright, you can go.

178
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:43,970
Are you really letting us go?

179
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:44,890
Yes.

180
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,490
Hurry. Let's go.

181
00:13:47,850 --> 00:13:48,520
Let's go.

182
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:55,160
Hurry.

183
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,560
How can you let them go?

184
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,890
They're from inside the pass.

185
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:04,040
- We should get some information from them.
- That He is not a scheming person.

186
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:06,370
The three of them
don't seem like bad people.

187
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,890
They slipped up earlier,

188
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:08,760
saying they were sleeping.

189
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:10,440
In a village this small,

190
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,610
where could they be sleeping?

191
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,760
Now that they're leaving,
where can they go?

192
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,520
They were afraid of our torch
attracting the sand people.

193
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:18,850
Wait for it.

194
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:20,920
They'll be back
in less than five minutes.

195
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,970
Gao Shen.

196
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,730
You guard the entrance.

197
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,490
The rest of us

198
00:14:27,490 --> 00:14:29,090
will check all the rooms.

199
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,730
There's nothing inside.

200
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,250
They're back.

201
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,090
Are you really good people?

202
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:56,610
Yes.

203
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,610
He.

204
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,010
Come and help.

205
00:15:21,400 --> 00:15:22,760
You and Old Qian go down first.

206
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:28,760
Go down.

207
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,730
Don't worry.

208
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:36,160
There are no chairs.

209
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,730
Just sit wherever you can.

210
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:39,040
Thank you.

211
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:39,730
Give me one.

212
00:15:42,970 --> 00:15:44,090
Where are you guys from?

213
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,890
You've got guts
to be out on a night like this.

214
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:49,850
That's my dad's book.

215
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,680
I love reading it too.

216
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,760
But I can't find the second volume.

217
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,140
(The Book and the Sword)
Books are scarce in the market now.

218
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,920
The times are tough.

219
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,250
Do you know
who the author of this book is?

220
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,920
Jin Yong.

221
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,010
It's written right there.

222
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,330
Have you seen him before?

223
00:16:09,330 --> 00:16:11,250
How is that possible?
He's from outside the pass.

224
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,540
It looks like there are other people

225
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,010
living in this cellar.

226
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:20,970
A few uncles.

227
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:23,610
They've been out to the market
for several days.

228
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:27,330
What about the other people
in your village?

229
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:27,970
Where do they live?

230
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,400
What village?

231
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,250
This area was struck by a salt beast
over a decade ago.

232
00:16:32,370 --> 00:16:33,610
It annihilated many families.

233
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,920
It's been deserted for a long time.

234
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:37,520
We're here to escape the disasters.

235
00:16:39,730 --> 00:16:41,330
Times are tough now.

236
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,730
It's chaotic.

237
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,090
After the salt beast,
the sand people came.

238
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,610
We thought this place was an oasis

239
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,520
with ready-made houses,

240
00:16:50,890 --> 00:16:53,010
water, and trees, so we settled here.

241
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,800
Wear this. Don't take it off.

242
00:16:55,610 --> 00:16:56,730
When you meet that thing later,

243
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,010
don't make a sound, no matter what.

244
00:16:58,850 --> 00:16:59,890
With this around your neck,

245
00:17:00,130 --> 00:17:01,540
I'll recognize you if anything happens.

246
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,850
Sis.

247
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,920
I understand.

248
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,640
Don't worry, I can run fast.

249
00:17:05,680 --> 00:17:06,810
If there's any danger,

250
00:17:06,810 --> 00:17:08,530
I'll come back in a flash.

251
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,160
There are corns, sis.

252
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:33,570
Hurry up.

253
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:47,530
But we dare not stay up there.

254
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:50,050
That thing.

255
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:51,810
Just smelling us can drive it insane.

256
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,640
I saw it with my own eyes.

257
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,610
It can drill holes in walls
half a meter thick.

258
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,680
Are you talking about those creatures
covered in sand?

259
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,200
Are they alive or dead?

260
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,400
Although they

261
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,050
appear half-dead,

262
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,200
they've actually been dead
for a long time.

263
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,400
The sand people are formed
as people are turned into sand

264
00:18:09,810 --> 00:18:11,370
by fallen golden ants
shortly after death.

265
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:12,920
What are fallen golden ants?

266
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,160
Fallen golden ants
look like regular ants

267
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:18,130
and only inhabit the vicinity
of the Flowing Sand Yardangs.

268
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:24,890
They crawl into the person's body
through the ears,

269
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:27,000
turning the bodies into sand.

270
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,760
The bodies turned into sand
by the fallen golden ants

271
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,200
are called the sand people.

272
00:18:35,370 --> 00:18:37,130
The sand people looks like people.

273
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:39,850
But they have
long been turned into sand.

274
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,810
As soon as the fallen golden ants die,

275
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:43,850
they become useless.

276
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,610
My dad said

277
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:48,000
that if you encounter them,

278
00:18:48,440 --> 00:18:49,770
either you'll be killed,

279
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,440
or you'll have to kill them.

280
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,160
We've driven so far.

281
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,240
Can they catch up?

282
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,090
That thing has a keen sense of smell.

283
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,480
It can follow your scent.

284
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:00,960
Also,

285
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:02,400
if you encounter it,

286
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,290
never let it touch you.

287
00:19:04,890 --> 00:19:07,530
It's said that it has a smell

288
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:09,400
that won't dissipate for days.

289
00:19:09,770 --> 00:19:10,810
Humans can't smell it,

290
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,570
but the sand people can.

291
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:15,570
If it suffers a loss from you,

292
00:19:15,810 --> 00:19:17,570
it will gather its comrades

293
00:19:17,850 --> 00:19:19,850
and come after you together.

294
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,850
Chang Dong.

295
00:19:27,050 --> 00:19:27,850
The car.

296
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:30,570
Should we clean it?

297
00:19:30,810 --> 00:19:31,330
We should.

298
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,400
I'll go.

299
00:19:32,770 --> 00:19:33,530
Car?

300
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,000
What's wrong?

301
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:36,570
Where are you going?

302
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,890
Did you encounter it?

303
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:40,090
I have perfume. Can I spray it?

304
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:41,160
No, don't.

305
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,720
What if you encounter it outside now?

306
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,000
You're lucky that you're in here now.

307
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:45,680
It's better to wait.

308
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:47,260
Hey, fortune teller.

309
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,890
Didn't you say
that if it couldn't smell,

310
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:50,620
it would return
to the Flowing Sand Yardang?

311
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,200
Wait a second.

312
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,480
What is this Flowing Sand Yardang?

313
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:56,370
At first, the sand people
were dead bodies.

314
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:58,090
The bodies were
embedded in Flowing Sand Yardangs

315
00:19:58,090 --> 00:20:00,640
and then turned into sand by fallen golden ants
to become the sand people.

316
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,680
Which Yardang is this?

317
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,400
The Seadragon Heap.

318
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,200
Is there any way to save a sand people?

319
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,720
Even God can't save the dead.

320
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:23,960
The sand people

321
00:20:24,530 --> 00:20:25,810
don't recognize anything.

322
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:28,370
They only recognize blood and flesh,
and they're not afraid of pain.

323
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,800
My dad said that when the sand people
dig through houses,

324
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,980
they won't stop even when their fingers
are worn to the bones.

325
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,610
I don't know if we can kill them all.

326
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:43,770
It's too stuffy down here.
I'm going out for some fresh air.

327
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,680
Dong, it's dangerous up there.

328
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,330
Dong.

329
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,680
Why don't you listen?

330
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:09,130
What's on your mind?

331
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,480
Look.

332
00:21:14,050 --> 00:21:16,370
The Gleam Star, Sparkle Star,

333
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,720
Blaze Star, Radiance Star,

334
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,130
Brilliance Star,

335
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:20,960
and Flame Star.

336
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,610
The Six Stars of Nandou.

337
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,850
But they are so close to each other.

338
00:21:30,680 --> 00:21:32,050
And also, over here.

339
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,960
The positioning is off too.

340
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:41,480
Wrong.

341
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,680
It's all wrong.

342
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:47,640
So?

343
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,050
So inside the pass

344
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:51,290
is another dimension.

345
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,200
A parallel world.

346
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:02,560
(Warding against demons)

347
00:22:04,570 --> 00:22:06,290
Although there are many dangers
inside the pass,

348
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:08,130
I have an inexplicable

349
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,090
sense of familiarity here.

350
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,200
I'm from inside the pass for sure.

351
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:20,920
The sand people we encountered earlier

352
00:22:21,530 --> 00:22:22,640
was Yu from Camellia.

353
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:33,720
What if it was Kong Yang?
Would you be able to handle it?

354
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,850
If we met her head-on,

355
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,330
and you can't do it,

356
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:42,330
would you want my help?

357
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:52,530
No, thanks.

358
00:22:52,850 --> 00:22:53,920
I can handle it myself.

359
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,130
What if I encountered her before you do?

360
00:22:58,890 --> 00:23:00,920
Do you want me to bring her to you,

361
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,330
or should I settle her

362
00:23:02,530 --> 00:23:03,640
and let you know after that?

363
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:04,720
Which do you prefer?

364
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,000
Don't get me wrong.

365
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,160
If I were in her shoes,

366
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,680
I would want my boyfriend

367
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,960
to remember my beautiful face,

368
00:23:16,610 --> 00:23:18,290
rather than the face of a sand people.

369
00:23:21,920 --> 00:23:22,720
Got it.

370
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,330
If there's anything you want to entrust to me,
just let me know.

371
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:42,850
I didn't expect Ding Liu's perfume
to come in handy.

372
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,050
(Since we're meeting your friends later,)

373
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,260
(what do you think of this outfit?)

374
00:24:05,130 --> 00:24:06,160
Passable.

375
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,090
You look great in anything.

376
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Help me pick one
out of these two perfumes.

377
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,770
Which smells better?

378
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,200
Sure.

379
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:27,160
Both smell similar, though.

380
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:28,160
You have to pick one.

381
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:29,770
Okay.

382
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
Let me smell again.

383
00:24:32,610 --> 00:24:33,400
Come here.

384
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,130
How about that one?

385
00:24:40,290 --> 00:24:41,090
It tickles.

386
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,290
This one.

387
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:42,890
This one?

388
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:44,480
This one?

389
00:24:48,850 --> 00:24:49,640
Does it smell good?

390
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,780
I'll spray some on your car
to cover the smell.

391
00:25:24,890 --> 00:25:25,680
Liuxi.

392
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:28,480
If

393
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:32,160
you encountered Kong Yang before me,

394
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,640
and if

395
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,240
she became a sand people,

396
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,610
then I would entrust her to you.

397
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:52,080
(Flowing Sand Yardang)

398
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,640
