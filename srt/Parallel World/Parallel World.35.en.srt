2
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:36,960
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:39,719
I failed to bring them back.

4
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,200
These are their personal belongings.

5
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:52,280
I am truly sorry.

6
00:00:56,159 --> 00:00:57,359
Chang Dong.

7
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:00,719
From today onward,

8
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,079
I consider this matter resolved.

9
00:01:03,759 --> 00:01:06,439
I think you've done what you could
to bring the fallen home.

10
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,560
I also hope

11
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:13,120
that you can move on from this.

12
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:35,680
Hello?

13
00:01:36,719 --> 00:01:37,560
(Dong.)

14
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,200
(There's a job offer for
transporting goods to the desert.)

15
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:40,799
(Do you want...)

16
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:41,400
I'll go.

17
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:43,319
As long as
it's the Seadragon Heap route,

18
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:44,000
I can do it.

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,519
(Sure. That's settled then.)

20
00:01:45,519 --> 00:01:46,599
(I'll contract with the client.)

21
00:01:46,599 --> 00:01:47,239
(Wait for my reply.)

22
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:48,920
Okay.

25
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,840
(Aren't you talking about me?)

26
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,120
My whole life is fashion.

27
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,439
You can take any part of my life
and turn it into a movie.

28
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:42,060

(This story is a work of fiction.)

31
00:06:19,959 --> 00:06:20,920
I'll go and take a look.

32
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,959
Miss Ye! It's Feather Guards!

33
00:07:03,959 --> 00:07:05,959
Feather Guards have marched in!

34
00:07:05,959 --> 00:07:07,279
Did you see clearly?

35
00:07:14,199 --> 00:07:16,199
Ye Liuxi, show yourself!

36
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:17,480
Ye Liuxi!

37
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,639
Come and meet your doom!

38
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:24,000
Oh, my goodness.

39
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,920
Show yourself, Ye Liuxi!

40
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,959
They're over there!

41
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,639
Ye Liuxi, show yourself!

42
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:29,480
They're over there.

43
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,480
This way.

44
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:34,920
I saw everything clearly.

45
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,639
They're terrifying.

46
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,399
It's Scorpion Eye.

47
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:37,319
We need to leave now.

48
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:39,279
Look how cowardly you are.

49
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,399
You're just like Fatty Tang.

50
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,439
Li Jin'ao.

51
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:45,040
You're a member of the Li family
and have a sorcerer badge.

52
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:46,720
You've roamed around on your own before.

53
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,120
Why are you panicking now?

54
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,399
Those from Scorpion Eye

55
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:52,360
kill others without even flinching.

56
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:53,639
Plus, everyone knows

57
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,730
that you killed Jiang Zhan.

58
00:07:54,839 --> 00:07:56,920
It's obvious
they're here for revenge.

59
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:57,879
I know.

60
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,360
No.

61
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,680
Can you not be so calm?

62
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:02,680
If they come rushing,

63
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,879
we're all going to die.

64
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:04,839
Hush.

65
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,320
If you wish to stay alive,

66
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,759
I have an idea.

67
00:08:10,959 --> 00:08:12,279
You do?

68
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,160
What is it?

69
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,750
You dabbled in shadow puppets before.

70
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:16,399
The drunkard who beat the princess,

71
00:08:16,399 --> 00:08:17,360
do you know?

72
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:21,639
The princess's husband, Guo Ai, hit her.
According to the law,

73
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:24,879
his father, Guo Ziyi,
would also be implicated.

74
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,720
So, what did he do?

75
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:31,480
He tied up his son
and brought him to the imperial court.

76
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,679
He wasn't affected by his son

77
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,679
and was cleared of guilt.

78
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:36,720
You can do the same.

79
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,320
Tie me up and hand me over
before the fight breaks out.

80
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:40,440
This is called

81
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,919
recognizing the situation

82
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,600
and doing what's right.

83
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:45,799
Maybe Scorpion Eye would be so happy

84
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,450
that they treat you guys extremely well.

85
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,919
Can you not joke around?

86
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,039
I'm being serious.

87
00:08:53,759 --> 00:08:55,320
You only have one chance.

88
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,559
You won't get another.

89
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,279
What about you?

90
00:09:06,039 --> 00:09:07,600
Your idea

91
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,480
is indeed a good one,

92
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,559
but I, Li Jin'ao, care about my dignity.

93
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,919
I won't commit an act of betrayal
in a moment of crisis.

94
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,320
Alright then.

95
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,600
From now on, you two will join me.

96
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,159
Go on.

97
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,679
See what's happening.

98
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,759
Kill the traitor, Ye Liuxi!

99
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,679
Avenge Mr. Zhan!

100
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,080
Sacrifice Ye Liuxi as an offering!

101
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
A life for a life!

102
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:08,320
Ye Liuxi won't even get a proper burial.

103
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:12,759
Show yourself.

104
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,159
Get out here now.

105
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:15,519
Come out, Ye Liuxi.

106
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:16,240
Get out here.

107
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
Ye Liuxi, show yourself!

108
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,600
Ye Liuxi!

109
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,559
Come out!

110
00:10:19,759 --> 00:10:21,080
Miss Ye!

111
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:24,799
Miss Ye.

112
00:10:25,919 --> 00:10:26,679
The situation there...

113
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:28,120
Where's Ye Liuxi?

114
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,399
You killed our Mr. Zhan.

115
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,159
I'll make you pay with your life.

116
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,860
That's what's happening out there.

117
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,440
You two stay in the car.

118
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,960
No.

119
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:46,720
You can't go over there.

120
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,440
They'll kill you.

121
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,399
Don't worry.

122
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:50,720
Long Zhi has already

123
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,320
done the hardest bit for me.

124
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,590
How does she know
the scorpion's whistle?

125
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:06,679
It's not strange about that.

126
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:07,799
She's a mole. A traitor.

127
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,750
Why else would Mr. Zhan fall for her trap?

128
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,120
He.

129
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,600
Did Miss Ye
blow the scorpion's whistle just now?

130
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,759
Why does Miss Ye know
the scorpion's whistle?

131
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,679
Kill Ye Liuxi!

132
00:11:24,679 --> 00:11:26,320
Kill her!

133
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,039
Look at her eyes!

134
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,080
She drew the scorpion liner.

135
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:40,799
This woman

136
00:11:40,799 --> 00:11:43,320
is just putting on an act.

137
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
Drawing the scorpion liner?

138
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,750
As if you have the right to do so.

139
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,840
Come down and die!

140
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,759
Come out!

141
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,320
Kill her!

142
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,759
Ye Liuxi.

143
00:11:56,519 --> 00:11:57,940
Today will be the day of your death

144
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,200
for killing Mr. Zhan.

145
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,360
Come out!

146
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
Did you see it for yourself?

147
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,320
Are you kidding me?

148
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,320
Miss Qingzhi and dozens of our comrades

149
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:08,990
saw what you did.

150
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,759
How can it be a lie?

151
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:12,200
That's right!

152
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,080
You believe what Qingzhi says?

153
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:15,879
In my opinions,

154
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,279
she's more likely the one
who killed Jiang Zhan.

155
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:19,879
If not, why isn't she here

156
00:12:19,879 --> 00:12:21,240
to avenge Jiang Zhan's death

157
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,639
when it's such an important to do?

158
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:25,159
It doesn't matter
if Miss Qingzhi is here or not today.

159
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,159
You're going to die today!

160
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:28,440
That's right!

161
00:12:28,559 --> 00:12:29,559
She's afraid to confront me,

162
00:12:29,559 --> 00:12:30,879
so that's why she's not here, right?

163
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,919
Miss Qingzhi is here!

164
00:12:55,759 --> 00:12:56,960
Ye Liuxi.

165
00:12:56,960 --> 00:12:58,559
Look at you trying to sow discord

166
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,679
by falsely accusing Miss Qingzhi.

167
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,000
I saw everything!

168
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:04,600
It was you who cut off Mr. Zhan's arm

169
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,320
in Gold Mine Mountain.

170
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,279
Do you admit it?

171
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,759
That's right!

172
00:13:08,759 --> 00:13:10,120
It was you!

173
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,200
Scorpion Eye,

174
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,120
please don't act rashly.

175
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,480
Use your words.

176
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:17,639
Don't do anything rash.

177
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,159
I admit that.

178
00:13:22,679 --> 00:13:24,600
Jiang Zhan defied his superior,

179
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
so I cut off his arm.

180
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,740
It's a small punishment
to prevent a greater one.

181
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,960
That's all.

182
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,519
I didn't kill him.

183
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:34,159
Defied his superior?

184
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,440
How are you his superior?

185
00:13:36,879 --> 00:13:38,590
That's right! What makes you his superior?

186
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,640
Scorpion Eye follows a strict hierarchy.

187
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:42,480
The Scorpion Leader
holds the most power.

188
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,279
Jiang Zhan defied me,
the Scorpion Leader.

189
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,519
Ye Liuxi.

190
00:13:47,679 --> 00:13:49,000
You killed Jiang Zhan,

191
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,039
and now you're trying to trick everyone.

192
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,680
When did you become the Scorpion Leader?

193
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,200
Don't listen to her nonsense.

194
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,120
Kill her!

195
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,000
Fire away!

196
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,279
Have you gone mad?

197
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,960
I'm warning you.

198
00:14:07,039 --> 00:14:07,940
Stay calm, you hear me?

199
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:10,919
Quiet.

200
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,720
Not stopping, huh?

201
00:14:11,919 --> 00:14:12,720
Not stopping, huh?

202
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:13,919
Not stopping, huh?

203
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:16,080
Long Zhi.

204
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,039
You're the spy in Scorpion Eye,

205
00:14:19,039 --> 00:14:20,559
and you're now
trying to frame me instead.

206
00:14:21,879 --> 00:14:23,159
Even when you're about to die,

207
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,790
you can still come up with so many lies.

208
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,559
Listen up, Scorpion Eye.

209
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:27,759
Release the scorpions.

210
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:35,279
I want her body
to be pierced a thousand times

211
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,480
and die of poisoning.

212
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:06,490
She can't escape now.

213
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:14,399
Golden Scorpion!

214
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,440
It's really Golden Scorpion.

215
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,480
Look. It's Golden Scorpion.

216
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,060
Golden Scorpion?

217
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,080
How could this be?

218
00:15:40,799 --> 00:15:44,480
Didn't Golden Scorpion die
in the fight against the salt beast?

219
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,279
The scorpions are retreating.

220
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,159
It's the retreat of the scorpions.

221
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,559
After Golden Scorpion was injured badly,

222
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:06,759
I left it here to rest and recover.

223
00:16:06,919 --> 00:16:08,639
After founding Scorpion Eye,

224
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,480
I made sure every person had a scorpion.

225
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,480
People raise people,
and scorpions raise scorpions.

226
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:15,120
The scorpions of Scorpion Eye

227
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,120
are large in size

228
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,200
because they're all
my Golden Scorpion's disciples.

229
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,279
Don't listen to her.

230
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,960
Kill her!

231
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,919
In the past, I was Miss Qing, the leader.

232
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,440
Jiang Zhan was only Mr. Zhan.

233
00:16:37,879 --> 00:16:40,080
He was only my second-in-command.

234
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:41,919
He could not call himself the leader.

235
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,039
You can certainly
use tricks to deceive outsiders,

236
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:47,240
but scorpions won't fake it.

237
00:16:48,279 --> 00:16:50,080
As the daughter
of the Long sorcerer family,

238
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:52,700
you couldn't bear to let Feather Guards
lead the charge,

239
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,159
so I decided to wait here.

240
00:16:55,559 --> 00:16:56,720
I waited for you to personally

241
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,000
lead my Scorpion Eye to me.

242
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,600
Is she telling the truth?

243
00:17:03,679 --> 00:17:06,359
Is it true? Is it?

244
00:17:09,599 --> 00:17:11,119
Is she telling the truth?

245
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,720
Are you a sorcerer from Black Stone City?

246
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,240
Hurry up and answer!

247
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,200
Run, quickly!

248
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,400
Run!

249
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,400
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

250
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:20,400
He.

251
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,359
Quick.

252
00:18:21,359 --> 00:18:23,839
Get in the car.
Close all the doors and windows.

253
00:18:39,319 --> 00:18:39,680
Miss Ye.

254
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,410
What should we do now?

255
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,039
Does it have anything to do with me?

256
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:47,359
Am I supposed to be responsible
for your lives?

257
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,680
If I take up that responsibility,
will you acknowledge me as your leader?

258
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,519
Follow them. Take them on.

259
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,799
Let's just bow to her.

260
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:11,680
Get them!

261
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,160
I should've listened to you just now.

262
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,160
Long Zhi tricked us all.

263
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,880
This is our Miss Qing.

264
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,400
Acknowledge her.

265
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,510
You are our leader.

266
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,830
We'll follow your orders, Miss Xi.

267
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,920
There are a few boxes over there.

268
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,680
Go get them.

269
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,270
(After I severed my hand,)

270
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,350
(I remembered everything from before.)

271
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,830
(Turns out,
I can freely go in and out of the pass,)

272
00:22:21,830 --> 00:22:23,830
(unbound by the Demon Museum.)

273
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:26,480
(Only the one with bargaining chips)

274
00:22:27,400 --> 00:22:29,160
(is qualified to sit
at the negotiation table.)

275
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,310
(I've been
preparing for this for so long,)

276
00:22:35,550 --> 00:22:37,070
(without letting anyone know,)

277
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,750
(just for today.)

278
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,720
Everyone.

279
00:22:44,750 --> 00:22:45,830
Pay close attention.

280
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,790
Where did she get so many weapons?

281
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,400
What are you standing around for?
Grab them.

282
00:23:06,510 --> 00:23:07,440
Charge!

283
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:09,550
Fire!

284
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,270
Fire!

285
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,960
(In the days when I
was a slave in the Gold Mine Mountain,)

286
00:23:24,030 --> 00:23:26,440
(I had enough
of being exploited and bullied.)

287
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,030
(Those Feathered Guards
never saw us as human beings.)

288
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,240
(When I escaped
from the bottom of the Golden Pool,)

289
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:37,930
(I only wanted to avenge my village
that the salt beast slaughtered.)

290
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,550
(Later, I formed Scorpion Eye)

291
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:44,680
(to lead everyone to a better life.)

292
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,070
(I never expected)

293
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:49,200
(to have so many comrades)

294
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,980
(willing to fight
alongside me in the end.)

295
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,440
(I want to change my own destiny.)

296
00:23:57,160 --> 00:23:58,790
(I want to take them on a fight.)

297
00:24:00,310 --> 00:24:00,960
(Open the pass)

298
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,920
(to the outside world.)

299
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:04,880
(To live a peaceful life,)

300
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:09,400
(like how the movies
from outside the pass described.)

301
00:24:18,350 --> 00:24:20,590
(But then I met Chang Dong)

302
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,920
(and the friends
I've fought side by side with.)

303
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:39,110
(I can't let them get hurt.)

304
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:55,200
(Next up,)

305
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,200
(Black Stone City.)

306
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:10,840
(Nine months later)

307
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,720
Miss Xi, it's ready.

308
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:40,590
Bone Menders were originally
parasitic exotic beasts found in iron ore.

309
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,240
There's only one pair in the world.

310
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:45,480
There's one in Black Stone City,

311
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:47,680
and the other was taken by us.

312
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,160
Wear it,

313
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,070
and it will reconnect your meridians.

314
00:25:53,070 --> 00:25:54,400
Though it's an iron hand,

315
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,960
it's as agile as a real hand.

316
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,750
However, for the Bone Mender to acknowledge you,
it must meld with your bones and blood.

317
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,310
To wear it,
you must endure excruciating pain.

318
00:26:03,310 --> 00:26:03,920
Let's do it.

319
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,240
Gao Shen.

320
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:39,960
It's time to eat.

321
00:27:43,590 --> 00:27:45,480
After you eat,
I'll take you to meet Miss Long.

322
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:56,680
Is he dead?

323
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,830
Gao Shen.

324
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:00,030
Gao Shen.

325
00:28:08,110 --> 00:28:09,310
What are you wearing?

326
00:28:23,310 --> 00:28:24,350
You can try to run,

327
00:28:24,350 --> 00:28:25,790
but you won't get far.

328
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,070
Quick.

329
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:10,160
Over there.

330
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,110
Hurry.

331
00:29:11,110 --> 00:29:12,200
Fire!

332
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,480
The Golden Pool
corrodes bones and flesh.

333
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,000
He's done for.

334
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,940
