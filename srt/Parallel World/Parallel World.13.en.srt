Bear with it.

38

Liuxi.

39
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,040
Spray your wound with it.

40
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:46,840
No, thanks.

41
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,400
Be gentle.

42
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,600
Where's Dong?

43
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,520
He's waiting in a side room upstairs.

44
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,680
Do you guys think

45
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,400
Dong will plan
to leave this place?

46
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,240
Dong is capable.

47
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,400
As soon as he came,
he took care of everything.

48
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,680
What about us?

49
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,800
We dreamed of solving the puzzle,

50
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:04,660
but I didn't expect it
to be so dangerous.

51
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,880
I came here to search for my past.

52
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,240
That's why I'm here.

53
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,520
As for you guys,

54
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
that will depend on Liu's opinion.

55
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:13,400
Now that you mention it,

56
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,360
Liu's godfather,

57
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:16,880
Liu Qi, provided the funds
for us to come here.

58
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,160
We can't go back empty-handed,
or he'll scold us.

59
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:21,440
Liu Qi doesn't know how dangerous it is
inside the pass.

60
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,800
It's better to return safely
than risk your lives here.

61
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:25,200
My godfather said

62
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,080
he sent me here to toughen me up.

63
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,800
If I survive in such a dangerous place,

64
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,400
he would trust me to handle matters.

65
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,440
The worst case is that we die here.

66
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,440
That's up to fate.

67
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,400
I'm not his biological child, anyway.

68
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,400
Liu.

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,160
Qi has repeatedly reminded me
to ensure your safety.

70
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,600
He values you more than anything else.

71
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,640
What? Are you having second thoughts now?

72
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,920
I just think we might not be able
to leave the pass yet.

73
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,640
The car needs repairs,

74
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,340
and the fuel condition is uncertain.

75
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,520
If we go back the way we came,

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,690
we may encounter the sand monsters
at Flowing Sand Yardang again.

77
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,680
It's said that stepping out of here
will run your blood dry.

78
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,280
Liuxi.

79
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:01,040
Do you think

80
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,800
there will be bloodshed
when we leave the pass?

81
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,480
Don't bother looking.

82
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,440
We've checked all those things.

83
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,720
They're all from the 70s and 80s.

84
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,920
They're worthless.

85
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,600
But when I looked at clothes of Old Qian,

86
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,000
they seemed to be from the 90s.

87
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,680
When we saw the shadow coffins earlier,

88
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:25,360
the shadow puppets' clothes
were from different eras,

89
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,040
but there wasn't anything
from the last 20 years.

90
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,200
Doesn't that mean

91
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,720
the Ghost Camel Caravan

92
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,760
hasn't delivered goods for a long time?

93
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,320
No.

94
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
There's one from 2008 here.

95
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,880
It means they're still stocking up
inside the pass.

96
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,560
That's strange.

97
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:39,880
Here's one more.

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,960
This is a gem.

99
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Look, Liuxi.

100
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,680
(Crossroads of Love)
This book is precious to Liu. It's a treasure.

101
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:45,560
Why?

102
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,760
It's her manual to young love,

103
00:06:46,760 --> 00:06:48,380
and it accompanied her
through all the seasons.

104
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,560
Don't listen to his nonsense.

105
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,160
Is it true?

106
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
Back in middle school,

107
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,400
we did enjoy angst romance genres

108
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,040
that are tear-jerking
and heart-wrenching.

109
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:58,440
Heart-wrenching how?

110
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,960
In simple terms,

111
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,600
the male lead
has a deceased ex-girlfriend,

112
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,480
and then,

113
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,680
to win his heart,

114
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,040
the female lead
puts in relentless efforts to achieve that.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,680
How foolish is that?

116
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,600
How can you compete with a dead person?

117
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,920
The author

118
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:17,480
must have a masochistic tendency.

119
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,080
I'm so tired.

120
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,480
Let's go to sleep.

121
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:31,440
Fatty Tang.

122
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,720
Bring Chang Dong's shadow puppet box to him.

123
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,840
Don't tell him I asked you to.

124
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,360
It's late now.

125
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,280
He won't be able to carve it.

126
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:39,880
Just go when I ask you to.

127
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:43,280
Bring the other three's blankets
up to him as well since you're going.

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,480
Liuxi.

129
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:54,480
Do you think the sand monsters
will come again?

130
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,120
If they come again,

131
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
the weak ones up there will...

132
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,320
So what if they're weak?

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:00,280
They deserve punishment
after pulling such shameless acts.

134
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,160
Besides, if Dong can sleep,
they can too.

135
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:03,560
Tell them to quit the petty act.

136
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,240
I bet those three upstairs

137
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,640
are up to something again.

138
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
It's great that Dong is watching them.

139
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:09,720
We can sleep soundly without worry.

140
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,960
(At most,)

141
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:03,160
(I'll help you fold it.)

142
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,760
How was it?

143
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:29,040
Delivered?

144
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,120
Yes.

145
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,280
You didn't spill my name, did you?

146
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,480
Why would I?

147
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,000
But you guessed it right.

148
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,480
Dong started carving right away
after seeing it.

149
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,160
Wouldn't it be like this?

150
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,330
Hey, can you be fast
with the water boiling?

151
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,740
Who are you calling?
My name isn't "hey".

152
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:21,660
Isn't it ready yet, Fatty Tang?

153
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:22,420
Almost, Liuxi.

154
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,620
I don't care what you do

155
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:25,980
but make sure to bring the food up
when it's time to eat.

156
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,240
Liuxi.

157
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,410
Dong is still inside
carving shadow puppets.

158
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,100
Just pretend he doesn't exist.

159
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:34,660
We'll make food. It's up to him
whether he wants it or not.

160
00:10:34,660 --> 00:10:35,980
If he talks to you, let him.

161
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:36,980
If he doesn't, don't talk to him.

162
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,660
Liuxi.

163
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,660
I don't think you should stop us
from talking to him.

164
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,020
He'll suffocate.

165
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:44,220
I'm close with him. I'll go talk to him.

166
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,020
Don't move.

167
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,440
Don't do anything.

168
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,260
Liuxi, try to talk to Dong.

169
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,580
Give it one more day.

170
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
Why?

171
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:58,810
I'll wait until
his hunger gets the better of him,

172
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,710
so he'll come out obediently,

173
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,820
eat, sleep, and clean himself up.

174
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:10,000
You three,

175
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:12,720
come to me one by one
after you are done eating.

176
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,760
I have something to ask you all.

177
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:15,520
You there.

178
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:16,800
I mean you.

179
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,520
You first.

180
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:57,680
Have a seat.

181
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,040
My whole body is aching from the fight
with the sand monsters yesterday.

182
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:09,920
I'm very tired today.

183
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:13,000
When I'm tired, I don't like to talk,

184
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,560
but I love to listen to people talk.

185
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,280
How about this?

186
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,680
Let's play a game.

187
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:23,520
You speak, and I'll listen.

188
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:26,160
I'll ask one question,

189
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
and you'll tell me everything you know.

190
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,520
Don't make me ask more questions.

191
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,480
For each additional question I ask,
one point will be deducted.

192
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,200
Relax.

193
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:38,320
You definitely know the answers
to my questions.

194
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,880
But the same question

195
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,880
sounds different

196
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,760
when it's asked by different people.

197
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,840
What I fear the most

198
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:51,800
is when what you say
doesn't match what others say.

199
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,200
The sand monsters.

200
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:56,960
Do they only exist here?

201
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,840
Or are they everywhere?

202
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,040
They only exist here.

203
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:03,040
The origin of sand monsters

204
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:06,120
(starts with an exotic beast
called "the salt beast".)

205
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:11,160
(The salt beast has a voracious appetite
and is bloodthirsty by nature.)

206
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,960
(It loves to lick the salt)

207
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,800
(from the Flowing Sand Yardang.)

208
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,920
(Every dozen years)

209
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:23,000
(or maybe over 100 years,)

210
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,560
(it'll awaken once.)

211
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
(However,)

212
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:30,080
(once it awakens,)

213
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,080
(the villages nearby)

214
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,840
(will meet with disaster.)

215
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,840
Collecting pig bristles here.

216
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,480
Dyestuff, anyone?

217
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,280
Oh, my goodness.

218
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,720
Aren't you freezing in just that?

219
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:07,720
Are you thirsty, young man?

220
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:08,520
Here.

221
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,640
Have some water.

222
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,440
Why would I, a peddler,

223
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:46,320
cry my wares in the desert

224
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,960
in the middle of the night?

225
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,600
Am I crazy?

226
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:52,640
Who am I doing this for?

227
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,840
This is a trap.

228
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,160
Do you understand?

229
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,760
You walked right into it yourself.

230
00:14:58,760 --> 00:14:59,760
Don't blame me for doing this.

231
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,960
I'm rich.

232
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,560
I'm rich.

233
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,600
Anybody wants
to sharpen your knives and scissors?

234
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,680
Collecting pig bristles here.

235
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,360
Collecting hair here.

236
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,160
Dyestuff, anyone?

237
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:30,000
Collecting pig...

238
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,320
(Among the exotic beasts,)

239
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:08,880
(the salt beast is relatively rare.)

240
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,360
(It only roams here.)

241
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,040
(The salt beast spends most of its time)

242
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,400
(in slumber.)

243
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,400
(Sometimes for decades)

244
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:16,840
(and sometimes for over 100 years.)

245
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,280
(So,)

246
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,920
(although the salt beast
has caused trouble here,)

247
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,200
(people still live here.)

248
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,480
If they're lucky,

249
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,840
in their lifetime, they may never encounter.

250
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:30,680
A vicious shapeshifter,
the salt beast lurks in the pass.

251
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,240
(According to the books,)

252
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,120
(it's very good
at adapting to its surroundings)

253
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,360
(and can change its facial features
at will)

254
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,920
(to resemble whatever it meets.)

255
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,800
(If it meets a human,
its face becomes that of a human.)

256
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,520
(One has to look out for it)

257
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,760
(and take strict precautions against it.)

258
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,480
(At first,)

259
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,040
(it would pose as an outsider
visiting the village)

260
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:54,160
(and settle down.)

261
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:55,960
(Gradually,)

262
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,520
(the villagers would dwindle in numbers,)

263
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:03,120
(but there would be no traces
of their bodies.)

264
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,840
(After a period of activity,
the salt beast)

265
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,760
(would return to the Flowing Sand Yardang
to go into a dormant state.)

266
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,160
When the salt beast is slumbering,

267
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:15,280
the sand mounds
and the nearby water-devouring swamp

268
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,240
serve as its guards.

269
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,480
No one can get near there.

270
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:20,600
Even if someone manages to enter,

271
00:17:20,600 --> 00:17:22,200
they'll get infested
by the fallen golden ants

272
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,160
and become sand monsters.

273
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:25,120
As a result,

274
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:27,680
the Flowing Sand Yardang
becomes a forbidden area.

275
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,360
Ordinary incompetents
can't get near there.

276
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,840
The sand mounds can't move.

277
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
Where did these sand monsters

278
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,040
come from?

279
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:37,400
It's just bad luck,

280
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,120
anyway.

281
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:40,960
Unless...

282
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,120
Unless what?

283
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,360
Unless someone feeds it.

284
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,520
I've never heard of that.

285
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,240
What's the point
of feeding the salt beast?

286
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,320
That's insane.

287
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,320
We're just small fry.

288
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,600
We don't know much.

289
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,240
You should ask people at the market.

290
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,560
There are lots of people there,
and they're well-informed.

291
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,960
You can find out all sorts
of interesting things

292
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,960
at the market.

293
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,240
Are there a lot of cars at the market?

294
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,040
Can we buy gasoline there?

295
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,320
Yeah, you can.

296
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:13,200
It's just that few people
can afford to drive trucks.

297
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:14,800
Gasoline is too expensive.

298
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,440
And there's been
less and less of it over the years.

299
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,800
It can't be brought into the pass.

300
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,720
Gold leaf is used as the currency here.

301
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,520
You can also
trade goods for other goods.

302
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Things from outside the pass

303
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,320
are especially popular.

304
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,320
If you want to buy things
or ask about something,

305
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,160
you should go to the main market.

306
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,400
The bigger the market,

307
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,000
the more Feathered Guards
and sorcerers there are.

308
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:34,520
They can not only maintain public order

309
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,880
but also summon exotic beasts,

310
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:38,400
making them farm,
generate electricity, transport goods,

311
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,880
and do all sorts of hard labor.

312
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,840
I heard that life in Black Stone City,
the most prosperous city,

313
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,040
isn't much different
from life outside the pass.

314
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:48,760
They say one step out of the pass
and one's blood shall run dry.

315
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,040
If no one can step out of the pass,

316
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
then which of you have witnessed it
with your own eyes?

317
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,160
My parents.

318
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:58,320
That's how Fries lost his parents.

319
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,920
Last year, the three of them were fine
living in the neighboring village.

320
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,800
Then, five people came
from Red Brick City,

321
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,720
saying they
wanted to step out of the pass.

322
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,480
They offered money

323
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,920
to some people to act as their guides,

324
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,920
but in the end,

325
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
they never returned.

326
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,560
Their families went searching for them

327
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,560
and found the remains
of the seven people

328
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,400
near the Flowing Sand Yardang.

329
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,920
So, in order to step out of the pass,

330
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,800
one has to pass
through the Flowing Sand Yardang?

331
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,360
I don't know.

332
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,600
Rumor has it

333
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,480
that there are many ways
to step out of the pass.

334
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:34,560
But in the end,

335
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:37,600
they all turn into bizarre ways to die.

336
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,000
This kind of secret

337
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,080
is known only
to the Feathered Guards in Black Stone City.

338
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:49,680
Chang Dong.

339
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,240
Where are you going?

340
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,080
Whatever happened to you and Camellia,

341
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:08,240
I promise I'll uncover the truth.

342
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,920
About me

343
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,480
and Camellia,

344
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,280
forget it all.

345
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,440
Forget them.

346
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,880
Only then can you start anew.

347
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,040
Kong Yang.

348
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:33,080
I really wished

349
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:35,000
I had died with you back then.

350
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,520
Silly.

351
00:21:43,840 --> 00:21:45,960
That wasn't your fault.

352
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:41,160
Chang Dong.

353
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:48,400
Chang Dong.

354
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,040
What are you doing?

355
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,520
You've been hiding here for three days.

356
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,480
Are you still unable to accept the fact?

357
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:59,360
I came to terms with it two years ago.

358
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,680
So, what are you doing now?

359
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:04,160
You can't accept the fact
that Kong Yang had transformed?

360
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,480
Liuxi.

361
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,000
Kong Yang is dead.

362
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:21,400
Regardless of what transformed her,

363
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,040
she's no longer the same person.

364
00:23:25,680 --> 00:23:27,040
It's indeed painful,

365
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:29,760
but I won't go as far

366
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,560
as not being able to comprehend it.

367
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,000
What about you?

368
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,360
Why didn't you let them talk to me?

369
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:45,400
Every time Fatty Tang
came to deliver food,

370
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:48,680
he always seemed hesitant.

371
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,720
He clearly had something to say,

372
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,800
but in the end, he didn't speak up.

373
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:54,920
It's probably because

374
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:56,780
you forbid them
from talking to me.

375
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,640
What are you up to?

376
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,440
What do you think I'm up to?

377
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,520
You're likely here to tell me

378
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,600
that you won't allow them
to persuade me.

379
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,920
It's my choice whether I want to eat,

380
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,320
but if I want to survive,

381
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,040
I'll have to get up by myself and eat.

382
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,960
Tell me not to assume

383
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:17,480
that everyone has to revolve around me.

384
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,960
Until when

385
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:20,840
I'm on the brink of starving to death,

386
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,120
you'll only come to mock me

387
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,720
and give me a kick.

388
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,920
Yes, that's exactly what I had in mind.

389
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,240
You've got it right.

390
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,640
There's another possibility.

391
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,600
You just want me to calm down.

392
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,640
You'll wait until I figure things out

393
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:42,880
and come back to see if

394
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,560
I'm worth

395
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,520
lending a hand to.

396
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,080
Let's go.

397
00:24:59,120 --> 00:24:59,960

Come, let me carry it.

It's okay.

436
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:45,040
Give it to me.

Alright.

there won't be any more
special treatment.

You're awake.

Get some more sleep.
