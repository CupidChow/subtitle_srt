1
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:22,390
Lord Zhan.

2
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,390
Look,

3
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,480
the slaves we're saving today.

4
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:26,120
Those being sent to the gold mine.

5
00:00:29,870 --> 00:00:31,160
The others are already in position.

6
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,600
You guys ambush them here.

7
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,030
I'll deal with Feather Guards.

8
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,840
Lord Zhan.

9
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:39,280
We're outnumbered.

10
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,670
Halt.

11
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:02,840
Don't run.

12
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,430
Quick. Protect Lord Zhan.

13
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,200
Halt.

14
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:20,000
=Parallel World=
(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

15
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:24,100
=Episode 24=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

16
00:03:31,910 --> 00:03:34,080
You met Ye Liuxi
in the countryside?

17
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,680
Does she enjoy the country life?

18
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:55,520
That one called Chang Dong,

19
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,840
is he in a relationship with her?

20
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,950
Did you know?

21
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,310
She used to be mine.

22
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:44,920
Oh, I'm so tired today.

23
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,160
I don't know why, but I feel so tired.

24
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,430
Here, I'll share some with you.

25
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:59,600
Then I'll provide you
with a one-stop service.

26
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,600
Here too.

27
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:06,000
Be patient while I
help you spread it evenly.

28
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,600
Liu.

29
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,880
Yes?

30
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,830
I'm worried that Jiang Zhan

31
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:27,000
won't let Fatty Tang off.

32
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,460
What?

33
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,190
When I was in the deserted village,

34
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:32,160
I swapped the Sheep's Horn.

35
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
Why?

36
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:43,360
I was just following orders.

37
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,680
I didn't know anything.

38
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,240
I'm sorry.

39
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,040
Mr. Zhao.

40
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,070
Miss Ye has arrived.

41
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:29,870
Miss Ye?

42
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:30,870
What's the matter?

43
00:06:31,430 --> 00:06:33,120
Didn't you want to cooperate with me?

44
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,510
I've thought it over.

45
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,600
What are your thoughts?

46
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,800
What if I agree to collaborate with you

47
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,680
and help you deal with Jiang Zhan,

48
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,830
but you turn around and come after me?

49
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,480
Nandou breaks Yumen.

50
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:52,190
You won't trust me no matter what.

51
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,040
You're overthinking it.

52
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,480
I've always said,

53
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,360
you're born to be someone extraordinary,

54
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,430
so you won't meet a bad end.

55
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,950
Mr. Zhao, I'm not foolish.

56
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,870
I'm sure I won't meet a bad end.

57
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,040
But losing an arm or a leg,

58
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,600
going deaf or mute,
or a lifetime of imprisonment,

59
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,720
I can't bear that.

60
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,750
Miss Ye.

61
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,270
You're free to come and go

62
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:15,160
between the two sides of the pass.

63
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,920
We desperately need someone like you

64
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,070
to continue
transporting resources for us.

65
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:22,120
If we injure you

66
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,190
or lock you up,

67
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,830
what benefits will that bring us?

68
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,360
It's mainly because I haven't felt

69
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,680
that you're urgently in need

70
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,800
of me to continue
transporting resources.

71
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:33,240
Competition creates pressure,
right?

72
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
The world is more peaceful
without Scorpion Eye.

73
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,750
For people inside the pass,

74
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:39,080
living several decades
with limited supplies

75
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,080
is not a big deal.

76
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,800
So, what do you want then?

77
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:48,720
Mr. Zhao, please don't ask me.
I'm not articulate.

78
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,040
I want to cooperate,
but I'm also worried.

79
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,720
It's up to you

80
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,480
to give me a peace of mind.

81
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:56,000
That makes sense.

82
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Tonight,

83
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,040
I will hold a meeting
in the sorcerers' tower.

84
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,190
I will convey your ideas

85
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,120
to the Long and Qian families.

86
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,870
We will discuss
and come to a conclusion.

87
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,070
A satisfactory answer
will be given to you tomorrow.

88
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,430
Really?

89
00:08:16,870 --> 00:08:18,430
I'm sorry, Mr. Zhao.

90
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:20,680
I doubted you.

91
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,920
When I first entered Black Stone City,

92
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,190
I suspected you had ulterior motives.

93
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:31,120
I know I'm overthinking it.

94
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:35,750
But I've lost part of my memory,
after all.

95
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,720
Please don't take it to heart.

96
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,200
Not at all.

97
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,080
Miss Ye.

98
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,480
From now on, we're friends.

99
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,910
You don't need to be so formal.

100
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,870
I'll be heading back now.

101
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,030
I'll leave you to your matters.

102
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,240
Feather Guards are known
for their martial prowess, right?

103
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,150
Is Mr. Zhao
also quite skilled in combat?

104
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:12,360
I heard people say
that when Mr. Zhao was young,

105
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,750
one swing
of his eagle-head iron staff

106
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,390
could keep dozens of people at bay.

107
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,480
You've seen it too.

108
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,390
The one he uses as a cane.

109
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:20,670
Now, he's older,

110
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:23,030
and the previous sandstorm
in Huyang City

111
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:25,270
has affected his hearing and vision,

112
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:26,720
so no one has seen him fight since then.

113
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,480
Why are we talking
about these irrelevant things now?

114
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,960
Isn't finding Fatty Tang
the most important thing now?

115
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,150
How many days has it been?

116
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:34,750
There's still no news from Jiang Zhan.

117
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,910
Liu, try looking at it
from a different perspective.

118
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,080
Jiang Zhan has been
hiding in Black Stone City for so long,

119
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,120
but no one has caught him.

120
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,390
It means he's good at hiding
and careful in his actions.

121
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:44,750
They would risk getting exposed

122
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,480
if they were to swap him
in Black Stone City.

123
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:51,360
After all, this is
us Feather Guards' territory.

124
00:09:52,150 --> 00:09:52,910
Right.

125
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,240
I think so, too.

126
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,000
Us?

127
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,840
He.

128
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,960
When have Feather Guards

129
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,240
considered you as one of their own?

130
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,460
They even cut off your tongue.

131
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,670
Can you endure that?

132
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:06,720
I don't care if you want to endure that,

133
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,840
but you keep considering

134
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,550
Feather Guards as your own.

135
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:11,360
Don't you find it ridiculous?

136
00:10:12,910 --> 00:10:14,750
Liu, He is just used to saying that.

137
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:15,720
Liuxi.

138
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,320
Come with me.

139
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,240
Why didn't you let me speak just now?

140
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,670
Liu is right.

141
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,790
When it comes to Feather Guards,

142
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,270
He is like a frog
being boiled in tepid water.

143
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,750
She's used to it.

144
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,870
So she's not self-aware.

145
00:10:47,270 --> 00:10:49,550
It's actually good
that Liu pointed it out.

146
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,120
If we can win He over,

147
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,600
having a Feather Guard by our side

148
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,440
will make things more convenient.

149
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:59,440
Speaking of Feather Guards,
I just remembered.

150
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,390
When I was in Zhao Guanshou's room,

151
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:02,790
I carefully observed it.

152
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:05,150
Whether it's the doors,
windows, or drawers,

153
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,270
none of them have locks.

154
00:11:08,030 --> 00:11:09,870
There are no guards at the door, either.

155
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:12,360
Why is that?

156
00:11:13,390 --> 00:11:14,960
Is there some kind of mechanism?

157
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,790
Good day.

158
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,000
Li Jin'ao.

159
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:27,200
Come here. I have something to ask you.

160
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:27,670
Please, not now.

161
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,390
Can we talk later?

162
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:29,440
I need to use the restroom.

163
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,200
I'll be quick.

164
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:31,320
Very quick.

165
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:33,320
Let me ask you.

166
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,510
In the Demon Museum,

167
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,670
are there any exotic beasts that can

168
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,240
guard homes or treasures?

169
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,840
You're probably

170
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,240
asking about Thiefless.

171
00:11:40,510 --> 00:11:42,440
This creature is an exotic beast
from the lower volume.

172
00:11:42,670 --> 00:11:44,000
It recognizes its master and the house.

173
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:45,440
When its master is present,

174
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,510
everything is normal.

175
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:48,080
But as soon as its master leaves,

176
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,360
it's as if a thin film

177
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:52,200
covers the room.

178
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,720
It's colorless, odorless, and invisible.

179
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,550
Once someone breaks in

180
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:58,320
or touches something they shouldn't,

181
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:00,000
Thiefless will...

182
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,480
Snap.

183
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,750
It will capture the intruder instantly.

184
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:02,670
How does it capture them?

185
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:03,910
How?

186
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:05,550
How would I know?

187
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,120
But

188
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:09,320
I once knew a child

189
00:12:09,510 --> 00:12:12,240
who was captured by Thiefless.

190
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:15,200
He said that Thiefless

191
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,390
can make a person

192
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:17,750
unable to breathe.

193
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:18,960
And then

194
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,440
shrink them to the size of a bean.

195
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,840
A bean?

196
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,550
Since it's a bean,

197
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:24,510
it's at most

198
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:25,790
this big.

199
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,750
When the master enters,

200
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,120
he may not even see it.

201
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,390
One step over it,

202
00:12:29,390 --> 00:12:30,510
and that person turns to dust.

203
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,440
What happened to that child later?

204
00:12:32,510 --> 00:12:33,320
He's fine.

205
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,390
Because Thiefless

206
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:36,360
has this characteristic.

207
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:39,870
It can sense the age of the thief.

208
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,750
If they are under 22 years old,

209
00:12:42,870 --> 00:12:44,600
it will just capture them
but won't kill them.

210
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,960
This Thiefless is quite interesting.

211
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,270
It's lenient with the young.

212
00:12:48,870 --> 00:12:50,240
But is this thing

213
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,960
particularly prone
to causing accidental harm?

214
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:54,150
When its master is not present,
it prevents outsiders from entering.

215
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:56,390
When he's present, one can't
touch anything without permission.

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:57,960
One can't touch anything
without permission?

217
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:00,870
The master
has to say "please come in" explicitly.

218
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:03,270
In fact,
it's meant for Thiefless to hear.

219
00:13:03,510 --> 00:13:04,360
With that,

220
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,320
even if a guest accidentally

221
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,600
touches something they shouldn't,

222
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,390
Thiefless won't harm them.

223
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,670
No wonder Zhao Guanshou didn't
say "please come in" to me.

224
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:17,080
This is all I know.

225
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,870
I've said it all.

226
00:13:21,390 --> 00:13:22,720
I bet

227
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,720
the museum

228
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,360
will definitely
provide comprehensive information.

229
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:28,960
I got it.
I know you weren't allowed in last time.

230
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,390
I'll help you ask,

231
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:32,550
so that they'll let you in next time,
okay?

232
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:33,550
Okay.

233
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,200
Thank you.

234
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:36,440
Well then, you two chat.

235
00:13:36,670 --> 00:13:37,600
I need to go to the restroom.

236
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,000
Go ahead.

237
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:38,960
Alright. Goodbye.

238
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,790
If his room

239
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,840
really has Thiefless,

240
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,960
and he's not there,

241
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,870
we'd be dead if we entered.

242
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,320
If he's there,

243
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,600
we can't steal in front of him anyway.

244
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,550
Watch your words.

245
00:13:53,550 --> 00:13:55,320
How is returning stuff
to the rightful owner stealing?

246
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,670
Alright.

247
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,870
I have an idea.

248
00:14:05,390 --> 00:14:06,440
Liu.

249
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:08,440
Gao Shen.

250
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,200
Are you looking for Fatty Tang?

251
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,440
Then you'll have to do me a favor
to see him.

252
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:39,120
You want Geminus

253
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,200
to impersonate Zhao Guanshou?

254
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:42,840
He has caused us so much trouble before.

255
00:14:43,030 --> 00:14:44,750
It's finally a chance to use him.

256
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:49,510
Take this.

257
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,080
Come back.

258
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:56,870
Hurry.

259
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,550
Good boy.

260
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:00,960
Come here.

261
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,870
Liuxi, come quickly.

262
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:04,320
Jiang Zhan is speaking again.

263
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,670
Ye Liuxi.

264
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,200
Tomorrow at 11:00 p.m.,

265
00:15:29,550 --> 00:15:32,080
bring the Sheep's Horn
and the substitute tongue

266
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,550
to Soul Mountain Gate

267
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,120
at the Gold Mine Mountain.

268
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,120
To Soul Mountain Gate

269
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,360
at the Gold Mine Mountain.

270
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,870
Have you been to the Gold Mine Mountain?

271
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,790
No, Miss Ye.

272
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,320
Gold Mine Mountain,

273
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:54,870
for an ordinary Feather Guard like me,

274
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:56,080
is forbidden territory.

275
00:15:56,270 --> 00:15:58,510
Getting in there is even harder than
entering Black Stone City.

276
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:03,080
Maybe you should go ask Mr. Zhao.

277
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,550
It seems we need
to get the Sheep's Horn quickly.

278
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,670
Liu, how old are you this year?

279
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:11,840
20.

280
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,000
What about you, Gao Shen?

281
00:16:14,270 --> 00:16:15,150
I'm 21.

282
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,000
Alright.

283
00:16:18,150 --> 00:16:20,480
Both of you go with us
to Zhao Guanshou's house.

284
00:16:23,670 --> 00:16:25,510
Jiang Zhan requested to meet you
at the Gold Mine Mountain.

285
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,360
As Silver Snake said,

286
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,320
"A reunion on Golden Hill".

287
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,720
So when will the third prophecy

288
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,750
be deciphered?

289
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,840
I'm sorry. Please give me two more days.

290
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,440
Isn't the gold mine
under Feather Guards's jurisdiction?

291
00:16:42,870 --> 00:16:44,440
Why did Jiang Zhan choose that place?

292
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,080
Could it be that there are his people
among Feather Guards?

293
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:48,480
That can't be true.

294
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,270
You're overthinking it.

295
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:52,150
How could there be any Scorpion Eye
in Feather Guards?

296
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
Instead, there is a deep-rooted history

297
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:55,960
between the Gold Mine Mountain
and Jiang Zhan.

298
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,870
What kind of history?

299
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,480
When Jiang Zhan was in his teens,

300
00:16:58,750 --> 00:17:00,480
he once worked
in the Gold Mine Mountain.

301
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,360
What surprises us was

302
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,830
that he escaped from the mine

303
00:17:04,830 --> 00:17:07,440
and later
became the leader of Scorpion Eye.

304
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,110
But no one can tell

305
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:10,880
from which tunnel tunnel he escaped.

306
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,000
Is that just speculation?

307
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,550
The mine tunnels are everywhere
in the mountain,

308
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:16,550
and each tunnel

309
00:17:16,550 --> 00:17:18,350
extends into the mountainside.

310
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:20,480
Over time, they become like a dense web.

311
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:22,000
Even experienced miners

312
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,480
can't clearly tell

313
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,880
the exact layout
and direction of each tunnel.

314
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:31,750
This is a terrain map

315
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,240
of the Gold Mine Mountain.

316
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,960
You can take it back and study it.

317
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:40,180
(Gold Mine Mountain's Terrain Map)

318
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,590
They will press a hot iron

319
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:47,000
onto your leg to leave a scar.

320
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,200
This is...

321
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,550
This is Golden Snake Face.

322
00:17:52,550 --> 00:17:55,350
Underneath the gold mine
lies the suppressed Golden Snake's body.

323
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:56,550
Look.

324
00:17:57,350 --> 00:18:00,550
These seven mine entrances
happen to form

325
00:18:00,550 --> 00:18:02,000
the seven orifices

326
00:18:02,030 --> 00:18:02,830
(Gold Mine Mountain's Terrain Map)
of Golden Snake's face.

327
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:03,380
(Gold Mine Mountain's Terrain Map)

328
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,880
But people
can't enter these mine entrances.

329
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:06,920
Since ancient times,

330
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:08,590
they have been used
for worshiping Golden Snake.

331
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:11,070
I'm going to see Jiang Zhan tomorrow.

332
00:18:11,310 --> 00:18:12,920
Can you provide me with any help?

333
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:14,310
Feel free to make any requests.

334
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,110
At the very least,
you should send Feather Guards.

335
00:18:16,110 --> 00:18:17,350
They have to enter with me.

336
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,240
Alright.

337
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,160
I'll send the most elite Feather Guard

338
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,200
to escort you.

339
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,720
Miss Ye.

340
00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:27,200
Why don't you go back first?

341
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,960
We still have some time
before departure.

342
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,720
I plan to make a quick visit
to the sorcerers' tower.

343
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,110
In that case, I'll leave first.

344
00:18:34,110 --> 00:18:34,880
Alright.

345
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,110
I had quite a conversation
with Zhao Guanshou today.

346
00:18:56,110 --> 00:18:57,310
That should be enough for you
to imitate him.

347
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:58,240
Read with me.

348
00:18:58,350 --> 00:18:59,880
Two days.

349
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:00,750
Feather Guards.

350
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,790
Feather Guards.

351
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:02,720
Please leave.

352
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:03,920
Please leave.

353
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:04,440
You can't come in.

354
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,160
You can't come in.

355
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,350
Please come in.

356
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:08,240
Please come in.

357
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,240
This way.

358
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,200
Who's there?

359
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,550
Come out.

360
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,160
Come out.

361
00:19:56,350 --> 00:19:57,110
Don't.

362
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:14,400
Mr. Zhao.

363
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,550
Please come in.

364
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,550
Please come in.

365
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:31,830
Please come in.

366
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,440
Please come in.

367
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,510
Aren't we funny like this?

368
00:20:54,510 --> 00:20:55,590
Keep your voice down.

369
00:20:56,350 --> 00:20:57,550
Be serious.

370
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,750
Stay here.

371
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,830
No moving. No laughing.

372
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:18,400
Let's go.

373
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,000
The cabinet.

374
00:21:26,510 --> 00:21:27,350
Liu.

375
00:21:37,510 --> 00:21:38,000
You.

376
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,510
Hold this.

377
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,550
Put it away.

378
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,960
Isn't this Dong?

379
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,960
Valley Guardian.

380
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,310
It's the Geminus.

381
00:22:13,920 --> 00:22:16,030
Oh no, Thiefless.

382
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:21,480
Run.

383
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:27,720
Go!

384
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:29,720
Go!

385
00:22:33,510 --> 00:22:34,440
It's too late.

386
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:36,550
Quick, turn back into Zhao Guanshou.

387
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,680
Hurry! Turn back into Zhao Guanshou.

388
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:39,270
You fool!

389
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:41,070
If you don't want to die,
change back now.

390
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,440
I know.

391
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,920
Zhao Guanshou, I'm scared.

392
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,680
I'm very scared.

393
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:47,880
Zhao Guanshou, quickly.
Turn back into Zhao Guanshou.

394
00:23:13,310 --> 00:23:14,030
Liu.

395
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:14,790
Get out first.

396
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,240
Quick.

397
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:41,720
It sacrificed itself to save us.

398
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,550
It just likes to scare people.

399
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,400
It never intended to harm anyone.

400
00:23:55,030 --> 00:23:56,160
Where's the Sheep's Horn?

401
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,310
Right here.

402
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:58,550
We need to leave.

403
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,480
Let's go.

404
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,440
You're fine, Geminus.

405
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:27,240
It was just a transformation.
Let's summon it back.

406
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,310
From now on, no more scaring people.

407
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:41,590
Let's go.

408
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,310
This one is different
from the previous one.

409
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,830
Oh yeah, there was a magazine.

410
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:51,440
Liuxi.

411
00:24:51,550 --> 00:24:52,830
This is a travel magazine.

412
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,750
Why was it in Zhao Guanshou's study?

413
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,720
Did you know? I've read this before.

414
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:57,480
I even bought one.

415
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,920
The first time I ever saw you

416
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,070
was in this magazine.

417
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,160
Zhao Guanshou reads travel magazines?

418
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,110
That's strange.

419
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:05,550
Liuxi, open it and take a look.

420
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,510
There's nothing interesting in here.

421
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:07,110
Don't move.

422
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,310
Take a look.

423
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,030
Isn't that you?

424
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:15,440
This...

425
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:18,680
At that time, Camellia was doing fine.

426
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,200
The magazine wanted to do an interview.

427
00:25:21,590 --> 00:25:22,880
I was recommended to them.

428
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,440
Camellia's sponsor
also wanted more publicity,

429
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
so they sent me.

430
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:28,030
Dong was right on the cover.

431
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,790
I was shocked when I saw it.

432
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:31,920
Something's not right though.

433
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,550
Zhao Guanshou is an old man.

434
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,240
Why would he collect a magazine
featuring Dong?

435
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,880
Why would he keep a magazine

436
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:41,510
about you?

437
00:25:42,790 --> 00:25:44,030
I always thought

438
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:46,440
I was dragged into this by bad luck.

439
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,000
It doesn't look like it now.

440
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,830
It's okay. Sit down for now.

441
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:58,750
We have a few more clues now, right?

442
00:25:58,750 --> 00:25:59,830
Whatever happens in the future,

443
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:01,590
we can be prepared in advance.

444
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,680
Alright.

445
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:06,440
Don't be anxious either.

446
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,550
If what you said is true,

447
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:09,200
and someone
has been planning this for a long time,

448
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,110
we can't unravel the mystery so easily.

449
00:26:11,110 --> 00:26:12,550
I'm not anxious.

450
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:15,830
The whole situation,
no matter how convoluted it is,

451
00:26:15,830 --> 00:26:16,920
we'll unravel the mystery bit by bit.

452
00:26:18,070 --> 00:26:19,920
I just hope that we,

453
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:21,550
all of us,

454
00:26:21,550 --> 00:26:22,510
won't get separated in the end.

455
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,750
Don't talk nonsense.

456
00:26:24,790 --> 00:26:25,880
Even if we do get separated,

457
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,070
we'll find each other again.

458
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:28,070
Right?

459
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,070
Don't overthink it.

460
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,790
Liuxi.

461
00:26:33,790 --> 00:26:35,920
Have you seen how this magazine
interviewed Dong?

462
00:26:35,920 --> 00:26:36,830
Look at this description.

463
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,160
At that time, the magazine asked...

464
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,400
See? Look at this.

465
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,200
What's this here?

466
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,400
Is it cream or the coffee?

467
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:44,790
I don't know either.

468
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:45,440
These lips...

469
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,070
This man looks gentle on the outside,

470
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:48,640
but it's hard to imagine what's inside.

471
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,790
Qingzhi.

472
00:27:23,270 --> 00:27:25,240
Do you still remember,
when we were kids,

473
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,160
I taught you to read and write here

474
00:27:27,550 --> 00:27:28,680
while you taught me how to fight?

475
00:27:32,830 --> 00:27:33,790
Get up.

476
00:27:34,350 --> 00:27:35,270
Again.

477
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:42,400
I do.

478
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,440
He.

479
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:00,440
Liu.

480
00:29:00,830 --> 00:29:01,510
Liu, wake up.

481
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,030
She won't wake up.

482
00:29:03,030 --> 00:29:04,070
What did you do to her?

483
00:29:04,070 --> 00:29:04,960
Lower your voice.

484
00:29:05,790 --> 00:29:07,480
If you lure Ye Liuxi over,

485
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,440
she might die.

486
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,510
Substitute tongue.

487
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,240
You're Scorpion Eye.

488
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,880
Look at her head.

489
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:16,960
It's a Parasitic Flower.

490
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:19,480
It likes to live
in the human body's wounds.

491
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,750
In 6 months,
it'll take over the host's body.

492
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,790
I've never seen it
parasitize the head before.

493
00:29:26,790 --> 00:29:28,070
Stop beating around the bush.

494
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:30,030
Right now, the Parasitic Flower

495
00:29:30,030 --> 00:29:31,720
is only using her body at night.

496
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:33,880
When the flower finally blooms,

497
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,720
this girl's body

498
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,310
will completely become

499
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,480
a corpse,
just an empty shell for fertilizer.

500
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,350
Just what do you want?

501
00:29:47,830 --> 00:29:49,070
I want to save her,

502
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,550
but you need to agree to one condition.

503
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,240
How can I save her?

504
00:29:56,590 --> 00:29:58,110
Kill someone for me.

505
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:02,110
Don't worry.

506
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:04,590
I'll erase He's memories.

507
00:30:04,830 --> 00:30:06,070
No one will know.

508
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,240
I think the parasitic flower
is unnecessary.

509
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:13,510
Keeping a few cards up our sleeves

510
00:30:13,510 --> 00:30:14,960
is always useful.

511
00:30:27,110 --> 00:30:28,030
Tomorrow,

512
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:31,550
I will take down this Gold Mine Mountain

513
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,110
and kill Ye Liuxi with my own hands.

514
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:39,240
Do you really

515
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:43,000
have no feelings for her anymore?

516
00:30:43,830 --> 00:30:45,550
Since that day in Huyang City,

517
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,270
she has and will only be my enemy.

518
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:57,420
