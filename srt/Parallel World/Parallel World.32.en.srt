(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,160
=Episode 32=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:53,460
Liuxi.

4
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:55,820
Actually,
this is not the only village here.

5
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:58,740
Your home might not
be in this deserted village.

6
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,140
It's here.

7
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:02,260
I remember.

8
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:15,060
Take care of our daughter.

9
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,540
(Keeping this hand)

10
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,820
(means I won't get my memories back.)

11
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:14,380
(Do I have to carry
this blankness until I die?)

12
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:17,860
(Is all this worth it)

13
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,540
(for this hand?)

14
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,540
I was wondering why
I couldn't see the Dragon Head Yardang.

15
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,900
It has collapsed.

16
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,300
A collapsed dragon head

17
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
is a bad omen.

18
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,620
Don't talk nonsense.

19
00:03:50,620 --> 00:03:52,700
It would be bad if the bosses heard you.

20
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:55,380
Why did we stop?

21
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,580
We've arrived
at our destination for today.

22
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,540
We have found the Dragon Head Yardang.

23
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:18,900
Miss Long, please give your orders.

24
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,620
Should we
activate the Fireline Cover Net?

25
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,500
Activate the Fireline Cover Net.

26
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,140
The Fireline Cover Net
has been activated.

27
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,140
What is this thing?

28
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:55,980
Look.

29
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:58,700
Miss Ye.

30
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,420
I know what that is.

31
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:02,180
This thing is called
a Fireline Cover Net.

32
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:04,460
Once it covers this area,

33
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,540
we will be very safe.

34
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:06,780
Things like flies and mosquitoes,

35
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,940
especially exotic beast,

36
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,340
won't be able to come inside.

37
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:10,500
As long as you don't leave,

38
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,180
you'll be the safest you'll ever be.

39
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,940
Will humans get burned to death
if they pass through?

40
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,020
No, they won't.

41
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,140
It is only targeted

42
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,260
at exotic beasts, not humans.

43
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:21,860
You can come and go as you please.

44
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:25,940
But...

45
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,620
But why is this net so big?

46
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:28,500
It means we're now

47
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,100
very close to the Demon Museum.

48
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,060
It turned invisible,
which means it has been fully activated.

49
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:35,980
We're safe.

50
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,180
Chang Dong.

51
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,900
I'm fine.

52
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:10,980
I'm fine.

53
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,220
Do you remember the plan we discussed?

54
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,340
There's a difficulty in this.

55
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:23,740
We need to create chaos

56
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:24,940
to cover our tracks.

57
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,780
Let's use a sand monster.

58
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:06,380
Hey, little guy. You did great.

59
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,540
But,

60
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,620
I'm a little nervous.

61
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,460
As a sorcerer,

62
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,780
and a descendant of the Li family,

63
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,900
I dedicated my life
into shadow puppetry,

64
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,540
but tonight's performance

65
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,380
might be the most important one
in my entire life

66
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,220
because it will

67
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,620
involve the lives and deaths of many.

68
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,020
Spit it out.

69
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:38,340
Spit it out.

70
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,060
Come on. Spit it out.

71
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,020
Water isn't good for his wounds.

72
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:25,300
Also, I've already
wiped him down during the day.

73
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:26,420
No need to repeat it at night.

74
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:28,980
As for him, he's recovering well.

75
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:30,900
You don't have to watch
him all the time.

76
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,180
It's getting late.

77
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:37,900
Why don't you head back to rest?

78
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:40,420
I'll come again later.

79
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,760
(Tonight at Zi hour,
Flowing Light will lead the way.)

80
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:18,700
(Tonight at Zi hour,
Flowing Light will lead the way.)

81
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:45,340
Don't you have to look after Gao Shen?

82
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,140
He's doing fine,

83
00:09:47,140 --> 00:09:48,500
and he's in stable condition.

84
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,140
Look, it's coming out.

85
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,020
What's up with you guys today?

86
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,420
You've been here all day.

87
00:10:04,420 --> 00:10:06,740
Li Jin'ao's shadow puppetry is starting.
Aren't you going there?

88
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,420
Miss Ye, we have received orders

89
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,780
to ensure your safety,
starting from today.

90
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,620
Accompany me to the bathroom.
I can't go on my own.

91
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,180
Are you still a kid?

92
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,900
Go by yourself.

93
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,380
I'm scared and dared not go alone.

94
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:37,940
Come with me.

95
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,300
Stop pulling.

96
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,620
I want to watch the performance.

97
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
I want to stay here.

98
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,820
I need to pee but am afraid to go alone.
It's too dark outside.

99
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:44,920
So annoying. Hurry up and leave.

100
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,140
Don't block the view.

101
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,100
Sit down.

102
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:49,340
Alright,

103
00:10:49,340 --> 00:10:50,380
I'll go by myself.

104
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,220
Do it further.

105
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,140
Do it far away.
We don't want to smell it.

106
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:00,060
Good!

107
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,700
Good!

108
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,740
Fatty Tang.

109
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,820
Go and try if Liuxi's blood

110
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:18,500
can break the Fireline Cover Net.

111
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,220
Dong.

112
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,140
What if it doesn't work?

113
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:23,980
It's okay.

114
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:25,900
We are planning to use blood

115
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:27,020
to make a show anyway.

116
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,060
Where are you going?

117
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,940
I need a wee.

118
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,300
You may go.

119
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,300
But remember,
don't step out of that circle.

120
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:02,660
There were reports of sand monsters
appearing just now.

121
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:05,740
Go ahead.

122
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,340
Alright.

123
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,220
Thank you.

124
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,100
Be careful.

125
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:17,860
Where are you going?

126
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,540
I'm going to pee.

127
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,780
Are you a three-year-old?

128
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,020
You pee squatting.

129
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,100
None of your business.

130
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:48,180
Good!

131
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:52,700
He.

132
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,940
He.

133
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,620
We won't be able

134
00:14:00,620 --> 00:14:02,220
to take you with us this time.

135
00:14:02,660 --> 00:14:04,660
Feather Guards will surely
retaliate against you.

136
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,220
I think,

137
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:09,340
maybe you should
run with Li Jin'ao and the others.

138
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:17,020
Take...

139
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,380
Take care?

140
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,540
Take care.

141
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,460
I'll take care.

142
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,740
You take care too!

143
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,780
He.

144
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,380
When we come back,

145
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:27,420
we'll look for you.

146
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,300
When that time comes,

147
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,820
leave a note for me
in the cellar of that deserted village.

148
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:33,220
I'll definitely find you.

149
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:34,060
By then,

150
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:36,180
I'll have the substitute tongue,

151
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,300
and I'll bring it to you.

152
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:40,060
Then you'll be able to speak again.

153
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:43,600
This method is indeed effective.
It can damage the Fireline Cover Net.

154
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:49,200
It was fine just now.
How is it suddenly so windy?

155
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,700
How are we
supposed to watch the show now?

156
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,600
Remember.

157
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,520
You need to find an opportunity

158
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:01,800
to gather everyone indoors
as much as possible.

159
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:03,600
No matter what happens outside.

160
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,080
In their haste, they can't organize
an immediate counterattack.

161
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,040
The more Feather Guards
are in disarray,

162
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,120
the better for our plan.

163
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:12,960
Don't leave.

164
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,280
You.

165
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,360
Tie that up.

166
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:17,400
Secure the tents.

167
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,560
You guys,

168
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,800
bring that frame over
and block the door.

169
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,080
Listen to me.

170
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,000
What happens next on the show

171
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,680
will be even more exciting
than the last.

172
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,240
Come on, let's continue.

173
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:35,320
(Time is running out. It can only imitate
about seventy to eighty percent.)

174
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:37,160
(There will be some discrepancies
in its form.)

175
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:37,760
Time to get ready.

176
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,040
(We can't think too much about it now.)

177
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,240
(The physical movements alone
should scare them for a while.)

178
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:41,880
Leave it to me.

179
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:50,680
A sand monster!

180
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,120
A sand monster is here!

181
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,760
Everyone, stay calm.

182
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,760
A sand monster has taken Gao Shen away.

183
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:01,240
Hurry!

184
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,720
Where?

185
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,760
Over there.

186
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,560
Let's go in that direction.

187
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:07,280
No, no, no.

188
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,240
Not this way.

189
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,200
It's that way.

190
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,280
That way.

191
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:13,960
Get bows and arrows!

192
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:14,720
Shoot him down!

193
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:17,800
Stop!

194
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:18,880
Stop right there!

195
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:22,800
There!

196
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,440
Stop!

197
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:24,320
Chase him!

198
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
Count the number of people.

199
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,560
Good heavens.

200
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,840
You bunch of dimwits!

201
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,680
How can the Fireline Cover Net
to be damaged?

202
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
How did you all allow
a creature to come in?

203
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,720
And take a person away?!

204
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,680
Seriously, use your brains.

205
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,080
Gao Shen.

206
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,960
Gao Shen was dragged away
by a sand monster.

207
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:20,280
What happened?

208
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:21,600
He probably wasn't dragged too far.

209
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:22,720
You all hurry and go.

210
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,440
Dead or alive,
he has to come back to us.

211
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,000
Fatty Tang.

212
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:27,800
Get the car. Find him, quickly.

213
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:28,440
Okay.

214
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,880
What do we do? That's a sand monster.

215
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,120
It's going to be okay, Liu.

216
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,400
Let's go by car.

217
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,160
A sand monster
can't be faster than a car.

218
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,280
You boasted about how powerful
your net was.

219
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,720
But it couldn't hold up
for a single night!

220
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,280
I...

221
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,080
Get lost.

222
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:48,960
Fine.

223
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,000
Liuxi.

224
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,200
Liu, get in the car quickly.

225
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,560
Let's go.

226
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:58,600
Hurry.

227
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,040
Miss Ye.

228
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:09,960
Miss Ye.

229
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,440
It's too dangerous, Miss Ye.
You can't go.

230
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,320
Why not?

231
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,280
Don't bother yourself with it.

232
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,440
We'll send a car

233
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,160
to follow your car
and search along the way.

234
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,000
You stay at the camp and wait for news.

235
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,480
We are only following orders,

236
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
so please don't
make it difficult for us.

237
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,440
Fine.

238
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,360
Over here.

239
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,400
Good.

240
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,440
No, the color of the clothes
is a bit light.

241
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,440
Darker.

242
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,280
Darker still.

243
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:52,600
Yes.

244
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:53,960
The hair won't do.

245
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,360
It's too short.

246
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:56,280
Make it longer.

247
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,440
Longer.

248
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,280
Yes, just like this.

249
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:02,920
You're all wonderful, dearies.

250
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,880
Go, go.

251
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:11,240
Yes, turn, good.

252
00:23:41,560 --> 00:23:43,000
Keep a close eye on them.

253
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,360
The others don't matter.

254
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,240
But Ye Liuxi and Chang Dong

255
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
must not have any mishaps.

256
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,320
I'll take a look
where the Fireline Cover Net had issues.

257
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,640
Keep a close eye on them.

258
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,280
Yes, sir.

259
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,640
Chang Dong.

260
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,760
Don't just sit there, get up.

261
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,720
Come over here to my side.

262
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,240
Turn.

263
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:20,360
Turn.

264
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:27,360
Chang Dong.

265
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:30,320
Lower your head a bit.

266
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,080
Raise your hands a bit.

267
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:35,960
Both hands.

268
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:38,440
You're too stiff.

269
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,600
Relax.

270
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,120
Hug.

271
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,000
Hurry up. I'm telling you, trust me.

272
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,240
I've been doing
shadow puppetry for so many years.

273
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,360
I know all about this stuff
between men and women.

274
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,800
Hug, both hands.

275
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,760
Hold around the waist.

276
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,560
Use some strength.

277
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,680
Hug closer to the chest.

278
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:06,520
That's it.

279
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,160
Now, this is what I call a hug.

280
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:12,160
Liuxi.

281
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,440
Fatty Tang and the others will circle around

282
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,120
in Flowing Sand Yardang,
waiting for you.

283
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Once you're on the car,

284
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,560
release gnats immediately
and find the exit to the outside world.

285
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,360
It's okay even if Feather Guards follow.

286
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,680
Their car isn't as fast as ours.

287
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:28,640
How are your legs? Are you okay?

288
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:30,920
I'm fine.

289
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,720
Chang Dong, I'm leaving.

290
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:53,800
Hey...?

291
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:55,720
At least say it
if you're going to switch scenes.

292
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:08,960
Don't worry.

293
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,720
I'll be back soon.

294
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:37,480
(I left a book on Gao Shen's body.)

295
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:42,160
As soon as you leave here,
show it to Liuxi.

296
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:43,560
Absolutely don't forget it.

297
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,040
Who goes there?

298
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,360
Qingzhi.

299
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,000
No.

300
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:45,960
You're Long Zhi.

301
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,600
Geminus?

302
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,880
How did it end up in your hands?

303
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,920
Chang Dong is smart,

304
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,080
but even the most elaborate plans

305
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:14,520
fail when there's a mole.

306
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,080
Are you referring to He?

307
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,320
Or Li Jin'ao?

308
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,240
See for yourself.

309
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,320
Gao Shen.

310
00:28:43,160 --> 00:28:44,120
Gao Shen.

311
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:49,600
