00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:43,540
=Episode 30=
(This story is a work of fiction)

3
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,400
You're still awake.

4
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,790
Are you alright?

5
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,350
Yeah.

6
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,720
Thought you were feeling unwell.

7
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,880
I just worried about you,

8
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,840
and stood at the door for a while.

9
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:46,510
I didn't knock.

10
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,470
Didn't want to disturb your rest.

11
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,440
Are you alright?

12
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:00,720
Maybe you should see a doctor.

13
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,470
Why are you laughing?

14
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,160
I'm laughing

15
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:12,720
because

16
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,510
you're good...

17
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,910
looking.

18
00:03:18,950 --> 00:03:19,560
Don't worry.

19
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:20,840
I'm fine.

20
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:22,910
Just tired, is all.

21
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,320
You don't like this place?

22
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:27,230
Me neither.

23
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:29,790
Zhao Guanshou's men said

24
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,400
arrangements are done.

25
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:34,040
We can set off tomorrow at the earliest.

26
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
We're setting off tomorrow,
what do you think of it?

27
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:44,840
No.

28
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,750
But we

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,230
are injured and weak.

30
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
Things are uncertain too.

31
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,980
I can't see what's waiting for us.

32
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:56,350
This isn't like you.

33
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,790
Why the sudden doom and gloom?

34
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,460
Even if you can't see the road ahead,

35
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,230
you can still keep walking.

36
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,400
One step at a time.

37
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,160
But what if there's no road at all?

38
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:11,510
Some people don't have legs,

39
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,600
but there's always a road.

40
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,200
But let's just say

41
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,910
I don't have legs, I can still

42
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:20,310
walk the path with a crutch.

43
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:26,160
Yeah.

44
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:30,870
True.

45
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,280
Alright.

46
00:04:34,640 --> 00:04:35,550
Get some rest now.

47
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,640
I need to sleep as well.

48
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:39,200
Weren't you going to wash up?

49
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:40,820
But you were going to sleep?

50
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:44,940
Oh, forgot about that.

51
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:45,760
Okay.

52
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:46,640
I'll wash up, then.

53
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,110
Chang Dong.

54
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,720
You're acting strange.

55
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,600
Li Jin'ao said you took a stroll
this morning

56
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,580
and came back only after a long time.

57
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,230
Did something happen?

58
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:03,760
Nothing.

59
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,620
It's alright if you don't wanna say it.

60
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,550
Like I said,

61
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,400
no matter what happens,

62
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,670
we have to talk face to face.

63
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,400
Talk about everything.

64
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:17,400
No matter what the result is,
I can accept it.

65
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:30,670
It's nothing, really.

66
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:35,140
I'll be waiting for you to talk to me.

67
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,040
Take it away.

68
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:57,200
Follow them.

69
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,400
Miss.

70
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:02,110
Why does the Heartstring

71
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
require live humans?

72
00:06:03,990 --> 00:06:05,470
I didn't say that.

73
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:06,960
So they're...

74
00:06:07,110 --> 00:06:09,840
I don't want live or long dead humans.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,960
I need fresh corpses.

76
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:16,840
Miss.

77
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:17,870
Look at these.

78
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,300
Anyone that catches your eyes?

79
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:27,840
Me?

80
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,280
Yeah, you.

81
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:29,870
You. Come out.

82
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:31,670
Don't just stand there.

83
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:34,790
You should feel honored
Miss Long wants you.

84
00:06:34,790 --> 00:06:36,960
Better a Long's slave than a miner.

85
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:37,790
I refuse.

86
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,350
I like to stay at the mine.

87
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:39,870
You...

88
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:40,840
Why do you refuse?

89
00:06:41,870 --> 00:06:43,640
Because you stink.

90
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:44,670
You...

91
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:46,600
What did you say?

92
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:47,600
Jiang Zhan.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,840
Tie him up right now.

94
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:53,040
Protect the Miss Long!

95
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,040
Hurry.

96
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,040
Come with me.

97
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:55,640
After them.

98
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,110
Don't let them get away.

99
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:15,760
Sir, Golden Snake is ashore.

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:17,140
We have to leave this place now.

101
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,990
There's only one exit
in Gold Mine Mountain.

102
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,350
They must still be around.

103
00:07:23,990 --> 00:07:25,400
Stay here until they come out.

104
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,350
We'll take the gold later.

105
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,910
I've made up my mind

106
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,160
to escape through Golden Pool's underside.

107
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:33,110
That pool melts flesh and bones.

108
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:34,160
Are you sure about that?

109
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,040
Li Wangdong carved this
on the stone wall.

110
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:39,080
If we dilute Golden Snake's saliva
and smear it on ourselves,

111
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,640
we can jump into the Golden Pool.

112
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:43,040
Qingzhi.

113
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,860
It's just the Golden Snake's saliva.

114
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,820
You really believe Li Wangdong?

115
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:48,600
I do.

116
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,790
Come with me. Out of the way.

117
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,640
Faster, Qingzhi.

118
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,040
Qingzhi.

119
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,600
(Qingzhi , Jiang Zhan.
Luck follows great misfortune)

120
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,960
Qingzhi, I'm scared.

121
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,040
Quick, catch them.

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,000
(Qingzhi , Jiang Zhan.
Luck follows great misfortune)

123
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,160
The Golden Pool melts flesh and blood.

124
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:46,910
These fools

125
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:49,120
are dead meat.

126
00:09:33,310 --> 00:09:36,880
I think it's Black Stone City's Welcome Lake.

127
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,520
We escaped Gold Mine Mountain.

128
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,710
Golden Snake's saliva was useful.

129
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,120
Everything Li Wangdong wrote is true.

130
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,040
Qingzhi.

131
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,830
So where are we going next?

132
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:53,340
What's the most chaotic place
inside the pass?

133
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:56,400
From what I've heard, it's Huyang City.

134
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
Then that's where we're going.

135
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,760
From now on, aside from Qingzhi,

136
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,590
I will have another name.

137
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,120
Ye Liuxi.

138
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,310
I'll find salt beast
and have my revenge.

139
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,190
Then I'm leaving the pass

140
00:10:12,430 --> 00:10:13,910
and have the name of Ye Liuxi

141
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:16,710
known to everyone
in and outside the pass.

142
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,950
You're awake.

143
00:10:50,710 --> 00:10:51,710
How do you feel?

144
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:08,280
What did you do to Qingzhi?

145
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:10,360
Where is Qingzhi?

146
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,190
She's not dead yet.

147
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
Where am I?

148
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,070
Where is Qingzhi?

149
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,670
Why did you wipe Qingzhi's memory?

150
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:22,830
What do you guys really want?

151
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:37,310
I kindly saved you,

152
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:41,280
and you're saying things I don't like
the moment you wake up.

153
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:45,160
Ye Liuxi!

154
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,790
Get some rest. That way,
you and Ye Qingzhican live a bit longer.

155
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,480
Hold it, Ye Liuxi!

156
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:53,670
My name is Long Zhi.

157
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,830
Gao Shen's been fine
these couple of days.

158
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:05,550
Looks like
if we made it through the pass

159
00:12:05,550 --> 00:12:06,950
and got him treated at a medical center,

160
00:12:06,950 --> 00:12:08,430
he should be fine.

161
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,420
Our trip will be complete.

162
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:11,590
As long as we're all fine.

163
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,360
You're so optimistic.

164
00:12:13,830 --> 00:12:15,790
You didn't get anything good
for your godfather,

165
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,590
and he has to pay for Gao Shen's treatment.

166
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:19,400
We're going to be yelled at
when we get back.

167
00:12:19,590 --> 00:12:20,760
Don't worry.

168
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:22,360
I'll deal with my godfather.

169
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:23,400
And

170
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,040
don't think my godfather's that shallow.

171
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,000
He's not a miser.

172
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,240
Once I tell him what happened
inside the pass,

173
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,520
he's going to be so curious.

174
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,740
It's easy for him
to buy a ticket and go to a city,

175
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:36,070
but not easy to go inside the pass.

176
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,430
Are you trying to run a travel agency?

177
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:40,070
It's called business.

178
00:12:40,670 --> 00:12:41,280
Liuxi.

179
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,190
If my godfather

180
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:43,900
wants you to bring him along,

181
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,190
don't hold back on him.

182
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:47,590
Quote him the highest price.
Five figures, six figures, whatever.

183
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:48,670
He is rich anyway.

184
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:50,190
He.

185
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:52,480
Once we leave here,

186
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,190
I need your help with something.

187
00:12:54,310 --> 00:12:56,670
If you have time,
go to the West Market's old goods store.

188
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,830
See

189
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,640
if there's any good stuff. Old stuff.

190
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:00,480
If you find anything,

191
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:01,120
just

192
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:02,760
pay for it

193
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,640
and buy the stuff.

194
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:04,550
I'll need it.

195
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:08,670
Liuxi.

196
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:09,880
Can you

197
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,280
seek out Zhao Guanshou

198
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,880
and get He a pair of tongues?

199
00:13:13,590 --> 00:13:16,310
Connect the substitute tongue to her,
and she can keep the primary tongue.

200
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:18,070
That way, she can talk

201
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:19,280
and not be under control.

202
00:13:19,910 --> 00:13:20,710
Sure.

203
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,430
And maybe
that'll make you a couple too.

204
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:27,400
Hey, you're cheeky.

205
00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:30,280
Just make any request you want.

206
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,430
They'll agree to it,

207
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,880
but whether they do it or not

208
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:34,550
is another story.

209
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:36,830
Dong.

210
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:37,880
What

211
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:38,790
is that supposed to mean?

212
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:40,710
Zhao Guanshou is nice to us now

213
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,400
all because he has to keep a front up.

214
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,160
One day,

215
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:45,000
when the time comes,

216
00:13:45,520 --> 00:13:46,640
he'll turn into our enemy.

217
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,670
The closer He is to us,

218
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,380
the easier she'll be dragged into this.

219
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:51,950
Alright, enough.

220
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:53,310
We're having breakfast.

221
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:54,710
Don't be such an absolutist.

222
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:57,160
I'll do it.

223
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:01,590
I'm full.

224
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:34,900
Spreading negativity
first thing in the morning.

225
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:35,830
That's unlike you.

226
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,830
One of them is in the pass,

227
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:42,550
the other is outside.

228
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,400
What the future holds for them,
no one knows.

229
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:48,300
Fatty Tang should toss his hope away
as soon as he can.

230
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:23,950
Here's Geminus.

231
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:25,880
If you miss me,

232
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:27,310
just conjure another me.

233
00:15:27,910 --> 00:15:29,070
It'll help you kill some time.

234
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,910
No way.

235
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,190
I heard the lads said you're leaving.

236
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:42,590
Yeah.

237
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,120
They say

238
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,240
you're leaving the pass.

239
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,670
This is a death wish!

240
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:50,190
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

241
00:15:51,190 --> 00:15:52,430
We're actually from outside the pass.

242
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,000
Ye Liuxi

243
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,670
is the legendary Bone of Liuxi.

244
00:15:57,190 --> 00:15:58,360
She led us into the pass.

245
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,950
The Bone of Liuxi.

246
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,240
The Soul of Wangdong.

247
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:06,830
I see.

248
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,670
Why don't you pack up too?

249
00:16:10,790 --> 00:16:11,710
And come with us.

250
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,430
We'll let you off halfway through.

251
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,140
The further you get away, the better.

252
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,790
Everything's moved.

253
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,760
Rooms are checked too.

254
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:18,400
Let's go.

255
00:16:18,670 --> 00:16:19,070
Chang Dong.

256
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,070
You'll take Gao Shen's car, right?

257
00:16:21,070 --> 00:16:22,190
You're still not fully healed.

258
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,040
I'm worried about you.

259
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:23,790
Sure.

260
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,640
Li Jin'ao is coming with us.

261
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,590
Alright.

262
00:16:26,590 --> 00:16:28,640
Then Fatty Tang and I
will take turns driving your car.

263
00:16:28,640 --> 00:16:30,040
You'll sit behind us.

264
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,310
I'll get the luggage.

265
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,910
There's an extra spot behind.

266
00:16:33,910 --> 00:16:35,950
Why don't we bring He along?

267
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:36,950
That's alright.

268
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:38,760
If she wants to see us off,

269
00:16:38,950 --> 00:16:39,760
she can go with us.

270
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:44,120
Let's go.

271
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:11,440
Liu.

272
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:13,790
Since we have nothing to do,

273
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:15,870
why don't we take a personality test?

274
00:17:16,040 --> 00:17:16,830
Sure.

275
00:17:20,070 --> 00:17:20,870
Say your family

276
00:17:21,590 --> 00:17:23,550
died in a fire.

277
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:25,040
Everyone

278
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,000
thought it was an accident.

279
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,070
A few years later,

280
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:31,830
you ran into someone

281
00:17:31,920 --> 00:17:33,040
and fell in love with him.

282
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,390
By chance, you found out

283
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,720
that the fire

284
00:17:37,240 --> 00:17:38,280
was caused

285
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,440
by him tossing a cigarette butt.

286
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,550
Of course, he

287
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,480
didn't think the cigarette butt

288
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,870
would cause a big fire.

289
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,420
What would you do, then?

290
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,040
He's so crass.

291
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,590
He can't litter cigarette butts.

292
00:17:51,390 --> 00:17:53,040
It's just an example.

293
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:56,480
That counts as manslaughter.

294
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,440
I would call the cops.

295
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,870
Justice is important.

296
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,240
But you

297
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,590
have already fallen in love with him.

298
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:04,630
So what if I do?

299
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:06,280
Even married couples can get divorced.

300
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,100
If I love the wrong person,
I can always turn back.

301
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,440
Besides, he killed my family.

302
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,180
If I don't do anything, how am I
supposed to face them in the afterlife?

303
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:20,550
Is it possible for you

304
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,110
to forgive him?

305
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,590
It's going to be hard to forgive.

306
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,240
That's my family he killed.

307
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,310
Even if it was an accident,

308
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:32,240
it still wouldn't sit well with me.

309
00:18:35,590 --> 00:18:37,000
What does that say about me?

310
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:41,520
It's good. It means you

311
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,240
can let things go.

312
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:44,960
What about you?

313
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:45,960
What would you do?

314
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:50,310
Take a guess.

315
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,920
I never seen something this impressive.

316
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,720
But my shop is a small one.

317
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,040
It can't take everyone in, I'm afraid.

318
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,790
See the people in those two cars?

319
00:19:23,790 --> 00:19:25,280
Take care of them the best you can.

320
00:19:25,310 --> 00:19:26,200
Everyone else

321
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:28,350
will be setting up tents outside and patrol.

322
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:29,760
Is that alright?

323
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,110
Yeah, no problem.

324
00:19:31,110 --> 00:19:32,000
Got it.

325
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,110
Hey, Feather Guards.

326
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:39,000
(Red Flower Tree Inn)
The journey has been long and tiring.

327
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,680
(Deserted Village Second Branch)
You've escorted us all the way here.

328
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,870
Thanks.

329
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,960
Let me bow to you.

330
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:46,830
Good. Good.

331
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,240
Well,

332
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:51,720
I'll humbly show you my skills
and perform for you.

333
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:52,630
It's free.

334
00:19:53,830 --> 00:19:54,280
Want it?

335
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:55,390
We want it.

336
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:56,720
I can't hear you.

337
00:19:57,350 --> 00:19:58,630
We want it!

338
00:19:59,000 --> 00:19:59,680
You want it?

339
00:20:00,110 --> 00:20:01,150
We want it!

340
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,350
Alrighty. Let's do this, then.

341
00:20:02,350 --> 00:20:03,150
You smiled.

342
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:06,200
The show begins.

343
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,060
Once all these people leave later,

344
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,140
come to my room,

345
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:11,980
but don't let anyone catch you.

346
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:16,140
I heard that.

347
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,540
Can't you be discreet
when talking about such things? I'm still young.

348
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,260
Sure.

349
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:19,980
You come over too.

350
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,300
What are you thinking about?

351
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,380
He.

352
00:20:32,620 --> 00:20:34,780
I need to trouble you
to look after Gao Shen.

353
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:35,700
Dong.

354
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:37,300
Do I have to come too?

355
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,060
Aren't you already staying with me?

356
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:43,180
If you're unwilling to come with,
go and keep He company.

357
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,660
What are you talking about?

358
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,220
What's so mysterious

359
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,940
that you have to say it in the dark?

360
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,460
Yes, you're right.

361
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,380
What I'm about to say

362
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,980
concerns you.

363
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,860
From how you came to this world,

364
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:25,540
to how you lost your memories,

365
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,780
and how we met

366
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,140
until how we entered the pass together.

367
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:32,240
Maybe there are things
you can't link together,

368
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:33,400
but don't worry.

369
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,460
Listen to everything I say
without interrupting me.

370
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:37,620
But remember, the most important thing is

371
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,620
for you to regain your memories.

372
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,240
If you can't remember anything,

373
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:43,600
just listen and don't take it seriously.

374
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,060
Well, you have to
take some of it seriously.

375
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,460
Your real name is

376
00:21:56,140 --> 00:21:57,460
Ye Qingzhi.

377
00:21:59,420 --> 00:22:00,780
Since your birth,

378
00:22:01,220 --> 00:22:02,540
the Six Stars of Nandou inside the pass

379
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,820
rose to the sky

380
00:22:03,820 --> 00:22:04,900
and stayed there until now.

381
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:07,340
The name Ye Liuxi is

382
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:10,220
the name you started using
after establishing Scorpion Eye.

383
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:13,180
I told you Liuxi
is an extraordinary person.

384
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,060
First it's Nandou in the sky,
then it's head west to exit Yumen,

385
00:22:16,220 --> 00:22:18,100
and now she's Miss Qing,
the head of Scorpion Eye.

386
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,860
But why would Liuxi

387
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,860
head to Li City to search for Dong?

388
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,460
Two years ago,

389
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,900
Liuxi and her men
opened the Demon Museum,

390
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:29,220
causing the separation
of Yumen's body and soul.

391
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,900
Outside the pass,

392
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,700
a massive sandstorm started up.

393
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,060
At that time,

394
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,580
I was leading Camellia.

395
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:37,580
We were camped at Goose Head Dunes.

396
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:45,820
Wait.

397
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:49,700
You can't blame Liuxi for that.
That's considered a natural disaster.

398
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,140
Moreover,
we can't believe everything they said.

399
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,900
Actually, ever since
I found out I am Qingzhi,

400
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:58,020
I had been wondering,

401
00:22:58,540 --> 00:23:00,020
was it really my decision

402
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,660
to open the Demon Museum.

403
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,860
You never brought it up,
so I didn't either.

404
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,500
You can continue.

405
00:23:16,940 --> 00:23:17,620
Sure.

406
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,500
I miraculously survived.

407
00:23:22,180 --> 00:23:23,140
Long Zhi

408
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:26,220
needed someone from outside the pass
who was capable of killing Ye Liuxi.

409
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,740
She thought she could use me.

410
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:29,700
That's why

411
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,620
she took the photo of Kong Yang.

412
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,580
I did use that photo to find you.

413
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:37,260
So that's how it happened.

414
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:39,940
What happened next, Dong?

415
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:40,580
After that,

416
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:43,140
there was the sandstorm
in Huyang City over a year ago.

417
00:23:44,140 --> 00:23:46,300
At that time, Liuxi's plan failed.

418
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,820
Long Zhi used the Doppel on Jiang Zhan.

419
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,500
This thing here.

420
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,780
From Jiang Zhan's perspective,

421
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,980
Liuxi and Long Zhi
have exchanged identities.

422
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:01,660
Later, Long Zhi used the Devourer on Liuxi,

423
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:03,740
so her memories from inside the pass

424
00:24:04,340 --> 00:24:06,540
and some important memories
from outside the pass

425
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,620
were all devoured.

426
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:09,860
Long Zhi is so ruthless.

427
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,780
This is why they all think Liuxi
is the betrayer from Black Stone City

428
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:14,300
when she returned to the pass.

429
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:15,580
You're right.

430
00:24:18,740 --> 00:24:20,780
Here's the situation now.

431
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,140
Long Zhi and Feather Guards

432
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,220
are determined to kill Liuxi.

433
00:24:27,540 --> 00:24:28,620
That's their ultimate goal.

434
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,460
It won't change.

435
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,840
That's because it involves fundamental interests,
iso there's no room for negotiation.

436
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,020
What should Liuxi do?

437
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,780
But they have two restrictions.

438
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:36,860
One.

439
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:39,500
Liuxi must die inside the pass.

440
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,740
The furthest she could die is the gray zone.

441
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:46,460
If she died further out, it wouldn't
be considered dying inside the pass,

442
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,760
and they won't be able
to restore the shadow puppets.

443
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,820
Can't they just
forget about the shadow puppets?

444
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:51,860
They have food and water.

445
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,780
Isn't it being the local tycoon enough?

446
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,100
Secondly.

447
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:57,900
People from inside the pass
can't kill Liuxi,

448
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,940
so they could only seek help
from people outside the pass.

449
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,180
Currently, the only ones inside the pass
who could kill Liuxi

450
00:25:03,180 --> 00:25:04,220
are I,

451
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:04,820
Gao Shen,

452
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:06,380
and the two of you.

453
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:10,180
She chose you

454
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:13,180
because you're a survivor
from Camellia's tragedy.

455
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:14,220
The way she sees it,

456
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:15,700
I opened the Demon Museum

457
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,620
and caused Camellia's demise,

458
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,660
so you and I
have a grudge against each other, right?

459
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:24,380
But wait, Dong.

460
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,180
Liuxi didn't even know

461
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,780
you guys would be stationed there.

462
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:28,460
That's right.
It's just a butterfly effect.

463
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,500
What happens if the butterfly flutters its wing,
and a storm rages at sea,

464
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,500
causing a ship to sink?

465
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:35,340
- Can they blame the butterfly?
- He's right.

466
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:38,940
Your defense arguments

467
00:25:39,020 --> 00:25:40,060
are so far-fetched.

468
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,140
If it were me,

469
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,980
if my friends and family

470
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,900
died in a tragedy,

471
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,620
I would never forgive that person,

472
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,360
no matter if it was
an accident or intentional act.

473
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:50,780
An eye for an eye.

474
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,980
Isn't that what revenge is for?

475
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,500
So did you gather all of us here tonight

476
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:57,940
because you have a plan?

477
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,140
Long Zhi and I
have encountered each other before.

478
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:04,220
She's a ruthless woman,

479
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,620
and the things she says

480
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:06,940
don't seem to be empty threats.

481
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,060
So,

482
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,420
if I don't kill you,

483
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,460
Fatty Tang,

484
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:12,100
Gao Shen,

485
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,020
and Liu,

486
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,380
they will all be used as leverage.

487
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:17,620
The three of you
won't be able to leave the pass.

488
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,380
But I will never kill Liuxi.

489
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:21,700
Long Zhi's plan won't work.

490
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,020
Liu.

491
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,980
There are times when people

492
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:26,900
can't withstand being threatened.

493
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,660
What if she kills Gao Shen

494
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,420
or Fatty Tang

495
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,580
if you refuse her?

496
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,180
Have you ever thought

497
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,820
about what kind of situation
you'll be facing?

498
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,020
So,

499
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,780
to avoid such a situation,

500
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,980
we need to take the initiative
and break the deadlock.

501
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,500
When we set out this time,

502
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:47,580
we've also brought Li Jin'ao with us,

503
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,420
and He.

504
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:52,260
That's because we're
at a disadvantage inside the pass.

505
00:26:52,660 --> 00:26:54,900
This means that everyone who can help

506
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:56,020
is coming along.

507
00:26:56,660 --> 00:26:57,460
Dong.

508
00:26:58,940 --> 00:26:59,900
What are your plans?

509
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,700
I only have two goals.

510
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,500
First,

511
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:04,340
you,

512
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,260
Gao Shen,

513
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:05,900
and Liu

514
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,260
need to safely leave the pass.

515
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:08,500
Second,

516
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:10,940
it's Liuxi.

517
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:14,740
It would be the best if you're
willing to live outside the pass.

518
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:16,380
But if you're not willing,

519
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,820
I don't want them

520
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:20,260
to continue threatening you
and deceiving you.

521
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:25,620
When we arrive in Flowing Sand Yardang
in a few days,

522
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,620
we'll need to find a way

523
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:30,500
to leave without attracting attention.

524
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,460
Dong.

525
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:33,060
Gao Shen's condition is still unstable.

526
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,660
The five of us leaving together

527
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:36,220
would be too obvious.

528
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,780
That's right.

529
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:39,500
So we need someone

530
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,580
to cover for us.

531
00:27:41,420 --> 00:27:42,180
I have an idea.

532
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,260
Once we reach Flowing Sand Yardang,

533
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:45,980
I'll look for a chance

534
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,860
to negotiate with Long Zhi,

535
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,340
and stall for time.

536
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:52,220
Liuxi, you'll seize this chance
to get the three of them out of here.

537
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:55,100
Gao Shen
isn't in a good situation right now,

538
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:57,580
and the two of you aren't good at fighting,

539
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,420
so the three of you should leave first.

540
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,260
What about you?

541
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,100
I'll stay and keep her occupied.

542
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,740
What's more,

543
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,420
I have Li Jin'ao and He with me.

544
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,820
With their help,

545
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,820
it wouldn't be that difficult.

546
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,860
If you're worried about me,

547
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,780
hurry back to get me

548
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:22,700
once you successfully sent them away.

549
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:25,340
By that time,
it'll be just the two of us.

550
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:26,940
It's easier for us to escape.

551
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:31,140
Dong.

552
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,780
Once we leave,

553
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,100
does it mean we'll never return again?

554
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:40,460
It's possible.

555
00:28:43,660 --> 00:28:45,260
What about He?

556
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:47,540
