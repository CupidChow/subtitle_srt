(Adapted from Wei Yu's novel "Parallel World")

2
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,660
=Episode 15=
(This story is a work of fiction.)

3
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,100
You startled me.

4
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:49,460
Dong, why did you

5
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,460
come back with Liuxi?

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,220
Why aren't you speaking?

7
00:01:58,460 --> 00:01:59,860
Listen, Dong.

8
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,740
This place is sketchy, for sure.

9
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:03,740
They cut the power 15 minutes early.

10
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:05,220
I will go wash up real quick.

11
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:24,900
What are you looking for?

12
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,860
Chang Dong.

13
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,020
Chang Dong.

14
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,140
What are you looking for?

15
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:51,700
Don't you use toothpaste
when brushing your teeth?

16
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:13,660
What...

17
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,020
What the heck is that?

18
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:23,780
What are you doing with the keys?

19
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,140
Forget it.

20
00:03:35,820 --> 00:03:37,380
We are not sure what it is anyway.

21
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,500
Better safe than sorry.

22
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,820
It might be some thieving exotic beast.

23
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,980
Why would it target us?

24
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,700
It even tried to steal our car keys.

25
00:03:59,140 --> 00:04:00,860
How's your injury?

26
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:03,180
It's fine.

27
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,420
Let me check.

28
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,420
It's really better now.

29
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,340
It's really better now.

30
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,420
Let me see.

31
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,260
Didn't you say it's fine now?

32
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,020
Why are you pressing on it?

33
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:18,260
If you press on it...

34
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:22,980
Your injury's almost healed.

35
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,620
Liuxi, are you guys saying

36
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:36,660
that thing can shapeshift at will

37
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,180
just for stealing?

38
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:39,060
Why else, then?

39
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:41,060
It is not going to roam around this inn

40
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,020
while pretending to be Dong,

41
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:43,220
harming his reputation, right?

42
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:45,260
How does that harm his reputation?

43
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:47,300
Who knows?
Someone might like watching Dong.

44
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
Right, Liuxi?

45
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,100
- Who has such bad taste?
- Alright, let's get some sleep.

46
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,420
If something happens tonight,

47
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,740
even if someone knocks,

48
00:04:56,740 --> 00:04:57,580
just ignore them.

49
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:59,420
- What if I need to use the restroom?
- Hold it in.

50
00:04:59,620 --> 00:04:59,980
Hold...

51
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:04,660
Fine, I will.

52
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:17,900
Who's that?

53
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:20,300
Is that Li Jin'ao's voice?

54
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:22,700
Why would he dare to go out now?

55
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,380
Does his sorcerer badge
really make him safe?

56
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,780
He must be drunk.

57
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,100
Yeah.

58
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,340
He nearly drank all the alcohol tonight.

59
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:30,380
Did he...?

60
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,620
Don't be afraid, Valley!

61
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,820
Valley.

62
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:34,180
Valley.

63
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:34,860
Come back!

64
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:35,900
Gao Shen, let's go.

65
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,820
Let's go check it out.

66
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,260
Liuxi.

67
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,780
You shouldn't go.

68
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:41,180
Just stay here.
It's safer if you stay here, Liuxi.

69
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,460
Valley.

70
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,100
Valley.

71
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
Valley.

72
00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:50,980
Va...

73
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,780
Valley.

74
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,500
Come back, Valley!

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,660
Valley!

76
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:55,980
Come back. Don't be afraid.

77
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,900
Valley.

78
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,140
Valley.

79
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,260
Va...

80
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,100
Valley.

81
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:05,900
Valley.

82
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:08,380
Come out!

83
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,540
Here's a slap, idiot.

84
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:13,940
You idiot.

85
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,180
You seem pretty out of it now, huh?

86
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:19,580
Running away faster than me whenever there is
just a little trouble. I'll smack you!

87
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,700
Stop hitting it.

88
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,500
It's you who hang it upside down every day,
yet you blame it for being slow-witted.

89
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,980
I was just trying to toughen it up.

90
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:27,020
Well, congratulations.

91
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,540
It's now adept
at turning things upside down.

92
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,020
So, what's up with your rooster earlier?

93
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:37,260
Valley Guardian doesn't
usually act like that.

94
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,340
It's mainly
because it's afraid of scorpions.

95
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,860
What? Its name is "Valley Guardian"?

96
00:06:43,300 --> 00:06:45,020
Didn't you say that it's impressive?

97
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,260
So, why is it afraid of scorpions?

98
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,780
Hey, you all should be careful too.

99
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,460
This inn has people from Scorpion Eye.

100
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,900
Scorpion Eye?

101
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:58,860
At the time, I was sleeping.

102
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,380
I woke up late at night
because I had to pee.

103
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:02,860
So, I went to the restroom.

104
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,060
And then...

105
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:19,140
(Public Bathroom)

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,580
So what is that thing?

107
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:52,700
I was terrified.

108
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,780
I panicked and didn't react in time.

109
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,100
Now that I think about it,

110
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:58,260
that thing was also an exotic beast.

111
00:07:58,660 --> 00:08:00,540
It's called "Geminus".

112
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:02,460
That thing, you see...

113
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:03,940
It can imitate others.

114
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:06,980
Yes, it really likes doing that.

115
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,620
It can mimic you perfectly, real quick.

116
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:10,020
It will just stare at you

117
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,260
to mimic your character and face.

118
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:13,420
In a snap,

119
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,580
it can imitate you perfectly.

120
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,140
This beast's favorite thing

121
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,580
is when you get scared.

122
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,060
It'll be happy.

123
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:25,860
But what it hates the most
is when you're not afraid of it.

124
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:27,180
It will think

125
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,620
you're ignoring it.

126
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,260
Then it gets really sad.

127
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,340
It would think that

128
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:32,540
itself is not good at mimicking

129
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:34,540
and can't imitate well enough.

130
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,020
Indeed, not so well.

131
00:08:44,020 --> 00:08:47,220
Geminus, over 60 years old,

132
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:49,260
can even mimic human speech.

133
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:51,540
But there are some limitations.

134
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,860
Like if you say "one, two, three, four",

135
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,860
it can also

136
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,980
say "one, two, three, four"

137
00:08:57,980 --> 00:08:59,500
and "four, two, three, one".

138
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:01,460
But even if you threaten to kill it,

139
00:09:01,460 --> 00:09:03,340
it can't say "five".

140
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:05,260
So what's the use, then?

141
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,180
Don't jump to conclusions.

142
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,380
Once you tame it, it's useful.

143
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:12,460
Think about it.
It can mimic the people you know,

144
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:14,940
spread fake news and stir the pot.

145
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,260
How terrifying is that?

146
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,660
So where did that Geminus go?

147
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,460
Well, I yelled.

148
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,180
And it got sucked in.

149
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,380
I looked up

150
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:27,660
and there was a person not far away.

151
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,700
That Geminus

152
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,900
was sucked right into his bag.

153
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:37,980
By this time,

154
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,140
Valley Guardian wasn't scared yet.

155
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,980
The key was when that guy moved aside,

156
00:09:41,980 --> 00:09:44,100
and suddenly, a giant scorpion appeared.

157
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,820
So this Valley Guardian
has a scorpion phobia.

158
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:53,420
Was that guy from Scorpion Eye?

159
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:59,180
Hey, can we keep it down?

160
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,180
Sure thing.

161
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,660
What's wrong?

162
00:10:01,660 --> 00:10:03,580
Are people from Scorpion Eye horrifying?

163
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,020
You bet.

164
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:07,220
How big are regular scorpions?

165
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:11,060
Only those from Scorpion Eye
can raise giant scorpions.

166
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:12,380
I heard

167
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,780
their leader would

168
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:17,780
draw a scorpion on the corner of eye
before killing people.

169
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:20,340
How terrifying!

170
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:26,980
Two years ago,

171
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:29,540
out in the Huyang Forest
near Huyang City,

172
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,660
they hanged
over a hundred Feather Guards

173
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,020
and left them swinging!

174
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:37,340
It's not peaceful around here, either.

175
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:41,140
Some twenty years ago,
when the celestial sign appeared,

176
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,860
I told everyone

177
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:46,300
this chaos wouldn't
end for at least a century.

178
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,580
What celestial sign?

179
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:49,540
"Nandou in the sky".

180
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,420
"Nandou in the sky"?

181
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,460
It means in broad daylight,

182
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:56,660
the Six Stars of Nandou
are up there in the sky.

183
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:01,180
Have you not heard of
"Nandou in the sky,

184
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:02,820
head west to exit Yumen"?

185
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:04,100
Uncle Ao.

186
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:06,220
What does
"head west to exit Yumen" even mean?

187
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,140
It's normal if you don't know.

188
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,860
After all, you're not like us sorcerers,

189
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,540
who naturally know more.

190
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,260
Back then, they specially

191
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,540
consulted the Silver Snake

192
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,020
to check if sealing Yumen Pass

193
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,620
would have any flaws.

194
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,380
In the end,
Silver Snake only gave them five words,

195
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,900
"Nandou will bust open Yumen".

196
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,620
What's the point of sealing it, then?

197
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,940
Others could just bust it open.

198
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,620
Let's not rush.

199
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:38,180
After that,
they asked Silver Snake twice more.

200
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,260
The second time,
it foresaw the disaster of Yumen Pass.

201
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,140
"Head west to exit Yumen".

202
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,900
Fortunately,

203
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:50,260
it revealed the decryption method
in the third prediction.

204
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,260
What is it?

205
00:11:51,260 --> 00:11:52,300
It's the same answer.

206
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,460
If I had known,

207
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,300
I would have had a metallic van
like yours long ago.

208
00:11:56,620 --> 00:12:00,260
So have the Nandou Stars appeared
during the day before?

209
00:12:00,340 --> 00:12:01,300
Of course.

210
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,580
I never make baseless claims.

211
00:12:02,580 --> 00:12:04,060
I always have a basis for what I say.

212
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:07,580
The last time it appeared,
it should have been around 1000...

213
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,820
No, more than that.

214
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:12,220
Around 1200 to 1400 years ago.

215
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,340
Stop looking at me.

216
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,580
Okay, time to sleep.

217
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:33,660
You sleep on the couch.

218
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:34,300
Thank you.

219
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:42,480
(Red Flower Tree Inn, No. 37)

220
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,260
What's wrong?

221
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,980
Can't you wait till morning
to talk about it?

222
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:51,500
I can't.

223
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,180
I can't sleep.

224
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,100
There are too many things on my mind.

225
00:13:57,220 --> 00:13:58,460
Aren't you also not asleep?

226
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:00,980
It's all because of Li Jin'ao.

227
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,300
He said

228
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,100
the leader of Scorpion Eye

229
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,380
tends to draw a scorpion

230
00:14:07,380 --> 00:14:09,940
on the eye before killing someone.

231
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,340
That matches you.

232
00:14:11,980 --> 00:14:12,820
Also,

233
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:15,300
Feather Guards were hanged
in the Huyang Forest.

234
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:16,500
That matches you, too.

235
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:19,820
So, are you
from Feather Guards or Scorpion Eye?

236
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:22,220
I don't know.

237
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,780
What do you think?

238
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,500
You act like a thug.

239
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:32,420
Thanks.

240
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,820
At first glance,
you look more like a Scorpion Eye.

241
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,860
But if Feather Guards

242
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:40,780
are also arrogant and overbearing,

243
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,140
saying you're a Feather Guard
isn't excessive either.

244
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:47,060
But why wasn't I hanged to death?

245
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:50,700
One step out of the pass,
and one's blood shall run dry.

246
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,300
They said only shadow puppets
could step in and out of the pass.

247
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,020
So, what does that make me?

248
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,100
And what about Kong Yang's photo?

249
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:06,380
The more I think,
the harder it is to fall asleep.

250
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,540
You used to fall asleep
as soon as you lay down.

251
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:11,760
You're having trouble sleeping now?

252
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,540
Look.

253
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:20,420
So far,

254
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,980
our goals and directions

255
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,260
are still aligned.

256
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:24,580
So helping you

257
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,620
is also helping myself.

258
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,820
Let's take this watch face

259
00:15:30,820 --> 00:15:32,660
as a representation
of the people inside the pass.

260
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,340
Like He, Old Qian, and the others.

261
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:40,860
They roughly told us about this world.

262
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:43,500
We know this is the world
inside the pass.

263
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:46,180
There are no demons outside the pass.

264
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,500
I watched movies in the markets.

265
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:53,700
Those from outside the pass
dare to go out at night.

266
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:57,580
They lit up the whole city with lamps,

267
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,260
just like daytime.

268
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,100
We'll take this

269
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,220
as Li Jin'ao and his gang.

270
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:07,220
They can be considered
extraordinary talents, right?

271
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:08,580
A special class.

272
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,180
They know more things,

273
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:13,660
like the "Nandou in the sky".

274
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,220
In broad daylight,

275
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:18,380
the Six Stars of Nandou
appear in the sky.

276
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:20,380
Haven't you heard of this?

277
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,980
"Nandou in the sky,
head west to exit Yumen"?

278
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,780
It sounds a bit superstitious,

279
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:29,620
but if the people inside the pass
are not enlightened,

280
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:32,780
most of them will believe it.

281
00:16:35,300 --> 00:16:36,300
This one.

282
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:37,700
- The ones in power...
- I know.

283
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,820
The sorcerers and Feather Guards.

284
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,140
The core.

285
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:42,980
Exactly.

286
00:16:46,220 --> 00:16:48,180
We can confirm a few things now.

287
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,020
Inside and outside the pass
are definitely not the same world.

288
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:55,880
Secondly,

289
00:16:57,180 --> 00:16:59,140
inside the pass,
there are unique creatures.

290
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,820
The locals call them

291
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,780
exotic beasts or demons.

292
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:05,460
Their social structure
is like a simplified old society.

293
00:17:06,420 --> 00:17:06,780
Excuse me.

294
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,860
Be careful of the steps.

295
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:11,140
Thirdly, those in power,

296
00:17:11,620 --> 00:17:13,020
the sorcerers and Feather Guards,

297
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:14,380
control resources,

298
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,420
protect the people,

299
00:17:15,420 --> 00:17:17,100
and can even control exotic beasts.

300
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,540
If their rule

301
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:21,420
is not too harsh,

302
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,500
their position
can be considered unshakable.

303
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:30,460
Only after we enter the Yellow Soil City
can we get more information.

304
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:33,780
But that also means
it'll get more dangerous.

305
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:35,220
Yeah.

306
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,460
Didn't Li Jin'ao say

307
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:39,300
that Scorpion Eye has appeared here?

308
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:42,780
I just feel that

309
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,300
the further we go, the harder it gets.

310
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:56,500
We've been inside the pass for so long,
and you still can't remember anything?

311
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,500
I can't.

312
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,420
I really can't.

313
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,100
I would have told you
if I remembered anything.

314
00:18:03,020 --> 00:18:04,340
For a person as ostentatious as me,

315
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,740
even if I'm doing poorly
inside the pass,

316
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,100
logically speaking, someone should
come looking for me, right?

317
00:18:09,100 --> 00:18:10,140
But look.

318
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,580
No one came.

319
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,780
Don't speak too soon.

320
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:21,300
Perhaps there are wanted posters of you
in Yellow Soil City everywhere.

321
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,500
Doomsayer.

322
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:24,860
Why are you such a doomsayer?

323
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,300
There's something outside.

324
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,340
I want to have chicken tonight.

325
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:20,660
Let's stew it up for nutrition.

326
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,380
That requires an old hen.

327
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,380
Roosters need to be stir-fried.

328
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:27,580
Take the chicken wings and thighs.

329
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,460
Chop them off, then barbecue.

330
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:32,060
Then chop up the body.

331
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,660
Sprinkle some cumin.

332
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:36,620
Add some green onions.

333
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,780
It's gone.

334
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,260
It can really understand human speech.

335
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,500
I have an idea.

336
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,380
Sure.

337
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,660
Valley.

338
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,540
Valley.

339
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:18,500
Valley.

340
00:20:28,420 --> 00:20:30,380
Have some eggs, Liuxi.

341
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,620
Whose chicken is this?
Claims it or I'll slaughter it.

342
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:45,660
That guy might be a Scorpion Eye.

343
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,140
It's fine if we don't meet him head on.

344
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,540
But if we do, be careful.

345
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,780
Which guy?

346
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,580
The one wearing a hat and vest

347
00:20:51,580 --> 00:20:52,260
who just went out.

348
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,180
Spare the chicken.

349
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,540
It's you again?

350
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:02,180
Just let me take a look.

351
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,940
It may not necessarily be my chicken.

352
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,220
Valley Guardian, what are you doing here?

353
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,820
Sorry about that.

354
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,700
My bad.

355
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:14,940
There won't be a next time.

356
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:15,780
I promise.

357
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:16,460
Okay.

358
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,340
Thanks.

359
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,540
Are you okay, my Valley?

360
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,700
I found it.

361
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,380
It was under the table.

362
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:30,300
I wonder which glutton

363
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,860
hung it upside down under the table.

364
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:34,980
How can someone do that?

365
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,580
I did it.

366
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,460
And you're still acting so righteous?

367
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:48,420
Okay. Enjoy your meal.

368
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,140
No rush.

369
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,140
Ouch!

370
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,340
What's wrong with you?

371
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:54,340
Where does your strength come from?

372
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:55,540
Help!

373
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,820
Don't just sit there and eat,
all of you.

374
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,620
Help!

375
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,060
Oh my!

376
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,380
You're so strong!

377
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,660
What are you guys doing?

378
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,260
Last night,
we discussed something private.

379
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,500
It's nothing much.

380
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:14,740
We were just reminiscing

381
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,900
about how we used to commit crimes,

382
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:18,620
so we didn't want anyone to overhear.

383
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:20,680
Otherwise, another round of killing
would be too troublesome.

384
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:21,980
Who would have expected

385
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:22,980
that your rooster would come

386
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,060
and eavesdrop on everything?

387
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:26,340
Tell me. What should we do now?

388
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,300
You...

389
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:30,260
Are you kidding?

390
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:33,060
How could a rooster understand you?

391
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:36,780
Fine.

392
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,780
Even if it heard you,

393
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:40,100
it can't say it out.

394
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:42,180
Isn't that the same
as not hearing you?

395
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,020
It's facts!

396
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,180
I don't think so.

397
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:46,860
I think you commanded it to do so

398
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,700
because you'd know whatever it hears.

399
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:51,900
I think there must

400
00:22:51,900 --> 00:22:53,820
be some misunderstanding here.
Let me explain.

401
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,620
My Valley Guardian

402
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:57,140
is a chicken
that loves lively atmosphere.

403
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,300
Sometimes when it sees people

404
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
arguing or fighting on the street,

405
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:02,180
it won't budge
no matter how you drag it away.

406
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,060
I think if you

407
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,100
had had a normal conversation last night,

408
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,620
it definitely wouldn't
have been interested.

409
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,300
Don't you think?

410
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,580
So you're saying our conversation
was abnormal?

411
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,260
Alright.

412
00:23:12,620 --> 00:23:14,420
Let's do this. To put my mind at ease,

413
00:23:14,420 --> 00:23:15,580
between you and the chicken,

414
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,940
one must die.

415
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,420
You choose.

416
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,220
Don't think you can just
fool your way out of this.

417
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:26,900
Just look at
the kind of vehicle we came in.

418
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,340
I

419
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,180
shall give it up.

420
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,900
Liuxi, you've even
snatched the chicken from him.

421
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,060
Who knows how to kill a chicken?

422
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,740
Kill it? No.

423
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:01,900
I can't do it. I...

424
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:02,980
No.

425
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:03,900
This chicken has a smell.

426
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:04,980
I can't do it.

427
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,220
Please, don't bring it over.

428
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,340
Liuxi, my grandpa taught me

429
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,700
that the rooster used for courage

430
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,260
is best if it has a vibrant crown

431
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,820
and has eyes like fire

432
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,420
and feathers like satin.

433
00:24:20,420 --> 00:24:21,900
This chicken meets all the criteria.

434
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,700
It indeed does.

435
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,740
Given all the inexplicable events
that happened on our way here,

436
00:24:25,740 --> 00:24:27,460
I think this chicken might
come in handy someday.

437
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:29,100
Now is not the time

438
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,500
even if we have to kill it.

439
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:36,620
Alright, then.

440
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:38,220
We'll keep it.

441
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:40,020
Let's go. Pack our bags.

442
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,780
Let's go.

443
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,520
(Red Flower Tree Inn, No. 37)

444
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,940
Goodbye,

445
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,980
Valley Guardian.

446
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,220
I bought you for nothing.

447
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:52,860
These bandits. Robbers.

448
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,420
Cunning weasels.

449
00:26:02,660 --> 00:26:03,740
Excuse me, sir.

450
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,300
Hold on.

451
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,380
Yes, sir?

452
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,700
Hold on.

453
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,700
Why are these chicken in a cage?

454
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,100
Don't even mention it.

455
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,460
A customer heard there was
a chicken plague in Yellow Soil City.

456
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,620
He insisted that our chickens weren't healthy
and he was afraid his chicken would've been infected.

457
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,180
So, someone just
paid for all these chickens

458
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:22,620
and asked us to deal with them.

459
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:24,500
But they look rather healthy.

460
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:25,380
Yeah.

461
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,940
Look how lively this one is.

462
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:31,820
Exactly.

463
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,340
How about this?

464
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:34,860
Since I'm leaving soon anyway,

465
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,780
can you secretly

466
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,820
sell one to me at a cheaper price?

467
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,340
Please?

468
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,100
Well...

469
00:26:40,460 --> 00:26:41,300
Well...

470
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,740
Sell one to me.

471
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:44,740
Alright, then.

472
00:26:44,740 --> 00:26:45,500
Choose one.

473
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:46,940
Be quick.

474
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:47,940
Okay.

475
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,180
Thanks.

476
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:02,700
Look.

477
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:03,500
Oh, this one.

478
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:17,780
Get the chickens.

479
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:27,780
Calm and steady.

480
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:29,060
Composed as well.

481
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:31,420
You have
a bit of Valley Guardian's spirit.

482
00:27:31,700 --> 00:27:33,140
Alright. I'll choose you.

483
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
Ocean Guardian.

484
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:06,100
Isn't that the Scorpion Eye guy
from the Red Flower Tree Inn?

485
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,460
It really is.

486
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,020
What's going on?

487
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,780
Is he trying
to hitch a ride or pull a scam?

488
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:14,460
If he doesn't provoke us,
we won't disturb him.

489
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,380
Let's not care about him.
We'll just drive past him.

490
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,220
What a prick. He's blocking our way?

491
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,340
He probably doesn't know
that we've already figured him out.

492
00:28:26,340 --> 00:28:27,620
Dong, stop the car.

493
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,860
I want to see what he's up to.

494
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,020
Don't act impulsively.

495
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,140
Impulsiveness leads to trouble.

496
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,420
Don't bother me.

497
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,780
The car's full. We can't take you.

498
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:52,780
It's not that.

499
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,220
I just

500
00:28:54,620 --> 00:28:55,820
want to ask for directions.

501
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:58,700
You guys driving a metallic van
must know this road well.

502
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:02,660
I want to go to the Seven-Day Well.

503
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:05,140
Is this the right road?

504
00:29:06,580 --> 00:29:07,420
Have a look.

505
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,020
Here.

506
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,420
Watch out. Knife!

507
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:22,340
There's a scorpion!

508
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,580
Where's my gun?

509
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,340
Liu.

510
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,180
Quick!

511
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,300
Our scorpions are as tough as rocks.

512
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,300
A sting means certain death.

513
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:39,620
You'll all die here today.

514
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,740
I'll deal with this scorpion.

515
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,580
Get off the car first.

516
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,340
Dong, leave this guy to me.

517
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,180
You go help them.

518
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:55,500
- Can you handle him?
- Yes. I got this.

519
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,940
I can't see anything.

520
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,660
Did I go blind?

521
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:17,340
Liuxi.

522
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:18,980
Be careful.

523
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,700
Chang Dong.

524
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,500
Dong, Liuxi.

525
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,100
I think I've gone blind.

526
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,620
I can't see anything.

527
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,740
Why is there a gun?

528
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,660
You guys aren't from around here.

529
00:30:48,660 --> 00:30:50,460
I've dealt with a lot of people like him

530
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,700
when I was taking care
of my godfather's business.

531
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:54,580
You're something, Liu.

532
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,580
There's a horn growing on your head.

533
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,820
- What horn?
- Liu, don't move.

534
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,180
What's happening to Liu?

535
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,060
What were you yelling for?

536
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,500
What horn?

537
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:17,820
Why are you all looking at me like that?

538
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:19,980
It's nothing.
We're just messing with you.

539
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:23,420
Yeah, he's right.

540
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,500
What's going on?

541
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:29,020
What are you guys talking about?

542
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,740
Liu.

543
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,380
Hurry.

544
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,460
Help her get in the car.

545
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:40,020
Don't be afraid.

546
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:47,000
