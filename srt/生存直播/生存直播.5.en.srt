and put them in storage.

175
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:28,393
-Okay.
-Okay.

176
00:10:28,463 --> 00:10:31,593
Jin-guk and Hui-su, can you go to
the supply room and check the cameras?

177
00:10:31,663 --> 00:10:32,563
-Okay.
-Okay.

178
00:10:32,633 --> 00:10:35,663
Someone needs to clean up the cables
and lights in the auditorium. How about...

179
00:10:35,733 --> 00:10:36,763
I'll do it.

180
00:10:39,273 --> 00:10:42,343
I left early yesterday,
so I'll clean up the auditorium.

181
00:10:42,643 --> 00:10:44,713
There's a lot to do,
so you can't do it alone.

182
00:10:45,073 --> 00:10:46,573
I can do it alone.

183
00:10:48,643 --> 00:10:49,583
Okay.

184
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:53,413
So-hyun, can you organize the receipts we
received while preparing for the festival?

185
00:10:53,483 --> 00:10:54,453
Okay.

186
00:10:55,453 --> 00:10:57,953
Then I'll end the meeting here.
Good job, guys.

187
00:10:58,123 --> 00:10:59,893
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job, everyone.

188
00:11:15,543 --> 00:11:16,503
Baek Ho-rang.

189
00:11:19,373 --> 00:11:20,273
Yes?

190
00:11:29,223 --> 00:11:31,853
You can put the cables
in the supply room later.

191
00:11:32,493 --> 00:11:33,353
Right.

192
00:11:33,853 --> 00:11:34,723
Okay.

193
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,833
-Where did you go yesterday?
-What do you mean?

194
00:11:46,903 --> 00:11:49,503
During part two of the festival.
I looked for you, but I couldn't find you.

195
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:53,513
I left in the middle of it
because it wasn't fun.

196
00:11:53,743 --> 00:11:55,783
Hey. What else should we buy?

197
00:11:55,943 --> 00:11:57,743
You want to buy more?
This is already a lot.

198
00:11:57,813 --> 00:12:00,483
Baek Ho-rang didn't eat before. I want
to get her something while we're here.

199
00:12:00,553 --> 00:12:02,883
-Jae-hee.
-Oh, Woo-sol.

200
00:12:02,953 --> 00:12:04,653
I messaged you on Face earlier.

201
00:12:04,723 --> 00:12:05,693
Hello.

202
00:12:05,753 --> 00:12:07,423
He is...

203
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,523
He's in my class. How should I put it?
He's him.

204
00:12:10,593 --> 00:12:13,333
Why would you introduce me like that?

205
00:12:13,593 --> 00:12:14,633
He's a friend.

206
00:12:14,803 --> 00:12:17,463
-Woo-sol is...
-A close friend of Jae-hee's.

207
00:12:17,763 --> 00:12:19,873
Hi. Is your hair naturally brown?

208
00:12:19,933 --> 00:12:21,673
Yes. Is your hair naturally curly?

209
00:12:21,773 --> 00:12:22,873
Yes.

210
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:24,973
What's this?
What's with this conversation?

211
00:12:25,143 --> 00:12:27,513
Hey, Kim Yu-shin.
Go buy some more food. Hurry.

212
00:12:27,573 --> 00:12:29,213
Okay. I'll see you again, Woo-sol.

213
00:12:29,283 --> 00:12:30,813
Goodbye.

214
00:12:32,883 --> 00:12:34,453
What is this? Is he a new fling?

215
00:12:34,513 --> 00:12:36,483
What? Who? Him?

216
00:12:36,553 --> 00:12:37,823
Oh, gosh. Never.

217
00:12:37,883 --> 00:12:39,653
Gosh, he isn't?

218
00:12:39,723 --> 00:12:41,893
That's why I purposely didn't mention
Do Woo-jae.

219
00:12:41,963 --> 00:12:43,363
I was happy for no reason.

220
00:12:43,423 --> 00:12:45,293
What's there for you to be happy about?

221
00:12:45,363 --> 00:12:48,803
It's just because I want you
to start seeing someone else.

222
00:12:48,863 --> 00:12:51,033
That way, Do Woo-jae will--

223
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,673
-Woo-sol.
-Yes?

224
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,103
I'm sorry,

225
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,903
but I don't want to hear Do Woo-jae's name
for the time being.

226
00:12:57,103 --> 00:12:59,613
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking straight.

227
00:12:59,673 --> 00:13:02,143
From now on, if I need to mention him,
I'll call him "that jerk".

228
00:13:03,613 --> 00:13:05,883
Do you want something to eat? I'll buy.

229
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:09,683
The uncertainty of information.
The information that is spread around us

230
00:13:09,783 --> 00:13:12,693
is in fact...

231
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:42,623
Hello?

232
00:14:00,003 --> 00:14:01,303
You got prettier, Ho-rang.

233
00:14:03,603 --> 00:14:05,543
Stop glaring at me like that.

234
00:14:06,773 --> 00:14:08,113
Did you eat?

235
00:14:10,183 --> 00:14:12,753
Why did you call me?

236
00:14:12,953 --> 00:14:15,623
My personal information was released
because of you.

237
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,353
I was living perfectly well,

238
00:14:18,423 --> 00:14:20,953
but I had to shut down my account
because of you.

239
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:22,763
It's really annoying.

240
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:25,333
Are you asking me

241
00:14:25,433 --> 00:14:27,993
to be considerate of your personal
information when you're the assailant?

242
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:29,003
My gosh.

243
00:14:29,603 --> 00:14:32,803
You dare to look at me in the eye
just because I was being nice?

244
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,043
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

245
00:14:35,573 --> 00:14:38,103
Why do you think I called you here?

246
00:14:38,473 --> 00:14:40,673
I'm sure you wanted to ask me
to cover it up.

247
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:42,983
I'm sure you remember
everything you did too.

248
00:14:43,043 --> 00:14:46,483
Excuse me. First of all, I'm not sure
if it's even that big of a deal.

249
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,823
Also, I have no intention to cover it up.

250
00:14:49,053 --> 00:14:52,193
Covering it up before it gets bigger
only benefits you,

251
00:14:52,253 --> 00:14:53,393
not me.

252
00:14:54,023 --> 00:14:57,123
I'll just get cursed at for a bit,
but it will end.

253
00:14:57,663 --> 00:15:00,463
But that's not the case for you.
Aren't I right?

254
00:15:12,473 --> 00:15:14,213
You're scared right now.

255
00:15:15,443 --> 00:15:18,013
You acted like such a hot shot,

256
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:21,353
but you're afraid that people will find
out that you're a loser who got beaten up.

257
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:24,923
Isn't this hilarious?

258
00:15:24,993 --> 00:15:28,093
You're the one who got beaten up,
but you're the one who's scared right now.

259
00:15:29,793 --> 00:15:31,623
I came to see this.

260
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:38,373
I

261
00:15:40,103 --> 00:15:42,503
remember everything about the time

262
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:46,013
you claim to have no memory of.

263
00:15:47,743 --> 00:15:50,513
Every day, when I'm asleep or eating,
I'm reminded of it all of a sudden.

264
00:15:52,283 --> 00:15:54,283
So let me ask you something too.

265
00:15:57,683 --> 00:15:58,893
Why did you

266
00:16:00,593 --> 00:16:02,223
do that to me?

267
00:16:02,723 --> 00:16:04,163
I'm not sure.

268
00:16:04,563 --> 00:16:06,593
I don't really remember,

269
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:12,173
but it's probably because
you were an easy target.

270
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,573
It's been a while, so I wanted to get
something to eat with you,

271
00:16:18,643 --> 00:16:20,673
but I guess we can't today
because of my part-time job.

272
00:16:21,673 --> 00:16:24,983
There's some left, so you can drink this.

273
00:16:27,313 --> 00:16:28,523
I'll see you again.

274
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:44,933
...limited opportunities to approach
important information.

275
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:48,073
Furthermore,
if you can't obtain information...

276
00:16:51,673 --> 00:16:53,473
What do you think, Ko Eun-taek?

277
00:16:54,173 --> 00:16:55,113
About what?

278
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:57,213
What happened with Baek Ho-rang.

279
00:17:01,613 --> 00:17:02,583
I'm not sure.

280
00:17:04,623 --> 00:17:05,752
But

281
00:17:06,423 --> 00:17:08,563
don't you think it's too much
for her to clean up by herself?

282
00:17:08,993 --> 00:17:10,993
There are a lot of people
in the auditorium too.

283
00:17:14,262 --> 00:17:16,133
She won't like it if I go,

284
00:17:16,463 --> 00:17:19,433
so I think it would be good for someone
other than me to go.

285
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,042
I'm leaving now.

286
00:17:40,453 --> 00:17:43,993
-What are you doing?
-Just checking this.

[2020 Seoyeon Festival]

288
00:17:44,793 --> 00:17:47,263
The video from the festival?
You're already working on it?

289
00:17:47,633 --> 00:17:50,563
Yes. There's the filming
for the film festival soon,

290
00:17:50,633 --> 00:17:52,703
and I think Eun-taek wanted me to do it
today.

291
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:53,833
I see.

292
00:17:54,433 --> 00:17:55,503
What about the keys?

293
00:17:55,803 --> 00:17:58,303
I got my keys from Jin-guk.

294
00:17:58,873 --> 00:18:00,743
I'll get going now. I have tutoring after.

295
00:18:00,813 --> 00:18:01,983
All right, then.

296
00:18:03,513 --> 00:18:05,183
-Bye now.
-Bye!

297
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:11,523
I don't want to!

298
00:18:11,583 --> 00:18:12,993
So-hyun,

299
00:18:13,223 --> 00:18:14,793
can you talk to him?

300
00:18:14,853 --> 00:18:17,423
He keeps telling me to get dressed
like an elementary kid for the video.

301
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:20,163
Who else would do it? You think we can
get an actor just for that role?

302
00:18:20,233 --> 00:18:22,233
Why would you make me do such a thing?

303
00:18:22,303 --> 00:18:25,633
That's because you look the most childish
and cutest.

304
00:18:32,073 --> 00:18:35,143
If you've had a fling for a whole year,
it's about time you date.

305
00:18:35,213 --> 00:18:36,843
It's nothing like that.

306
00:18:38,013 --> 00:18:40,153
I'm submitting the receipts tomorrow.

307
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:41,753
Do you guys have any?

308
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:42,983
No, we don't.

309
00:18:44,653 --> 00:18:48,393
So-hyun, I want to check the footage
from the festival.

310
00:18:48,453 --> 00:18:50,463
I just need to backup the files
on the hard drive, right?

311
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:53,433
The footage? Hui-su already checked them.

312
00:18:53,493 --> 00:18:55,403
-Hui-su did?
-Yes.

313
00:18:55,463 --> 00:18:57,963
What? It's nothing urgent,
so I was told to work on them.

314
00:18:58,033 --> 00:18:59,603
-You?
-Yes.

315
00:19:01,133 --> 00:19:02,303
I see.

316
00:19:03,273 --> 00:19:05,273
Let me check again.

317
00:19:05,343 --> 00:19:06,373
Okay.

318
00:19:11,243 --> 00:19:12,983
Doesn't she look like an assailant
from the photo?

319
00:19:13,053 --> 00:19:15,113
-I bet there's a story behind it.
-I knew something was off.

320
00:19:15,183 --> 00:19:16,923
-She's quite ugly.
-Yes.

321
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:18,793
She's a little too skinny.

-Isn't that Baek Ho-rang?

Ho-rang!

We made this at our booth.
Do you want to try some?

No, I'm fine.

I'm Lee Na-hyun from Class Two.

We were in the same class
for special lectures.

329

They've been talking about you
the whole day.

333
00:19:40,543 --> 00:19:42,243
I guess they really have nothing better
to do.

334
00:19:42,313 --> 00:19:45,353
Ho-rang, you must be exhausted.

335
00:19:45,413 --> 00:19:48,153

like to steal her boyfriend.

you just go for it.

is true or not,

Your life is really boring nowadays,

thanks to someone,

397

00:35:34,233 --> 00:35:35,233
Okay.

525
00:35:36,363 --> 00:35:37,233
Okay.

526
00:35:39,873 --> 00:35:41,433
You're good at lying.

527
00:35:41,833 --> 00:35:44,243
Hey, this wasn't lying.

528
00:35:46,773 --> 00:35:49,413
By the way, did we fall asleep here?

529
00:35:49,783 --> 00:35:52,343
Not me. What about you?

530
00:35:53,713 --> 00:35:55,453
I did? When?

531
00:35:55,513 --> 00:35:57,223
When we were talking about the endings.

532
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:00,953
How come you never watch
the ending of this movie?

533
00:36:01,023 --> 00:36:02,753
Hey, you should've woken me up.

534
00:36:14,303 --> 00:36:15,733
I'm glad, though.

535
00:36:17,003 --> 00:36:18,603
You seemed more relaxed than before.

536
00:36:24,413 --> 00:36:26,483
Let's go now.
Your parents must be worried.

537
00:36:39,093 --> 00:36:40,893
So are you going to be home alone tonight?

538
00:36:41,393 --> 00:36:42,763
Probably.

539
00:36:43,463 --> 00:36:44,903
Do you want to come out if you're bored?

540
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,603
I'm going to go to the library later.

541
00:36:46,673 --> 00:36:49,843
No. It's a lot of fun to be alone.

542
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:52,073
Oh, well. You'll probably
fall asleep if you go to the library

543
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,373
and snore like you did last night.

544
00:36:53,443 --> 00:36:56,683
What? I snored? No, I didn't.

545
00:36:56,743 --> 00:36:59,283
You snored,
and you slept in a weird position.

546
00:36:59,343 --> 00:37:01,313
You slept with your eyes open.

547
00:37:01,383 --> 00:37:02,983
I couldn't sleep because of you.

548
00:37:03,283 --> 00:37:04,383
Stop lying.

549
00:37:07,323 --> 00:37:08,853
-Isn't this something
-Hey, Ko Eun-taek.

550
00:37:08,923 --> 00:37:11,163
-something your father used to wear?
-This is high fashion.

551
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:13,433
Why do I see Kim Yu-shin in front of me?

552
00:37:14,563 --> 00:37:16,193
-I dressed up.
-Am I seeing things?

553
00:37:16,763 --> 00:37:19,163
No. You're not.

554
00:37:20,103 --> 00:37:21,903
Hey, Baek Ho-rang!

555
00:37:22,203 --> 00:37:24,173
What? She's with Eun-taek. Let's go.

556
00:37:27,573 --> 00:37:30,543
Baek Ho-rang.
Did you guys go somewhere together

557
00:37:31,783 --> 00:37:33,413
-like this?
-Oh, right.

558
00:37:33,483 --> 00:37:35,783
-Baek Ho-rang and I were watching--
-We live in the same complex.

559
00:37:35,883 --> 00:37:37,623
That's why

560
00:37:37,683 --> 00:37:40,253
we bumped into each other
in front of the bakery.

561
00:37:42,153 --> 00:37:43,463
Why are you guys together?

562
00:37:43,663 --> 00:37:45,863
I was going to go to the library with you.
He's...

563
00:37:45,923 --> 00:37:47,763
I came
because you didn't pick up your phone.

564
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:49,803
-But where's the bread?
-What?

565
00:37:49,863 --> 00:37:51,603
You said you went to get bread.
Where is it?

566
00:37:52,663 --> 00:37:56,373
Oh, right. They said the bread

567
00:37:56,703 --> 00:37:58,503
isn't ready yet.

568
00:37:58,803 --> 00:38:00,043
Stop asking.

569
00:38:00,243 --> 00:38:02,573
Then you must not have had
anything to eat.

570
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:04,843
Eun-taek, Woo-jae, and I
are going to go eat, so come with us.

571
00:38:05,143 --> 00:38:06,213
-Me too?
-Yes.

572

I know a place near here. Let's go there.

573

you won't be able to last long.

Having faith in the lecture isn't enough.

582
00:38:28,873 --> 00:38:31,273
You must have self-determination too.

583
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:32,743
Okay. I'll do my best.

584
00:38:32,803 --> 00:38:34,743

on my hands now anyway.

start attending classes next week.

Is that so? Hi.

594
00:39:01,273 --> 00:39:02,273
Right.

Do the two of you go to the library
in the morning on weekends?

There's nothing else to do
other than studying.

598

That's strange. When I go to the library,
there's nothing for me to do. Right?

599

You live such a strict life.

600
00:39:15,383 --> 00:39:17,423
I can see why the two of you are friends.

What are you saying?
Don't compare me to you.

604
00:39:23,363 --> 00:39:24,893
The two of you are the same. Eat up.

605

-Hello?
[-Hey, Baek Ho-rang. Where are you?]

-I'm eating right now.

-Oh, and with Do Woo-jae.
[-What?]

610

Enjoy your meal.

611
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,713
[Why is he there?]

612
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:46,453
It somehow ended up like this.

613
00:39:46,613 --> 00:39:47,913
[Okay. Let's hang up.]

614
00:39:48,813 --> 00:39:50,223

-Kang Jae-yi.
-I see.

616
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:56,593
Did you guys break up at the Han River?

617
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:00,333
My goodness, Ho-rang.

618
00:40:00,393 --> 00:40:03,433
It's nice that she's always
straightforward. It's nice.

619
00:40:04,733 --> 00:40:07,273
Is that something
I shouldn't have mentioned? I'm sorry.

620
00:40:07,333 --> 00:40:11,373
As you may, I'm not in the state of mind
where I have to consider things.

621
00:40:11,443 --> 00:40:13,213
No, it's okay.

622
00:40:13,943 --> 00:40:16,373
But did you really break up
because of that?

623
00:40:16,443 --> 00:40:17,983
No. Eat your food.

624
00:40:18,043 --> 00:40:19,043
Okay.

625
00:40:33,393 --> 00:40:34,893
What do you think? Does it look okay?

626
00:40:35,193 --> 00:40:37,003
Baek Ho-rang. What unit do you live in?

627
00:40:37,063 --> 00:40:39,263
Me? Unit 805. Why?

628
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,273
I see. It's nothing.

629
00:40:43,903 --> 00:40:45,403
Then I'll get going first.

630
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:47,543
Want me to walk you home?

631
00:40:47,813 --> 00:40:49,673
It's fine.
We're right in front of my place anyway.

632
00:40:49,743 --> 00:40:51,983
That's right.
She's going to go with me anyway.

633
00:40:52,043 --> 00:40:53,283
You should go now too.

634
00:40:53,353 --> 00:40:55,083
I'm grateful that you came to see me,

635
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,483

to do when I get home too.

636
00:40:57,553 --> 00:41:00,593
Gosh.
I woke up in the morning to come see you.

637
00:41:00,653 --> 00:41:02,553
Then you should come with us.

638
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:07,093
Okay, Ho-rang.
Call me when you get home. Okay?

639
00:41:07,293 --> 00:41:08,293
Go.

640
00:41:08,733 --> 00:41:09,763

00:41:17,573 --> 00:41:19,043

643
00:41:19,103 --> 00:41:21,243
Why?
She said we were in front of her house.

-Yes.

so you wouldn't look at your phone.

696
00:44:41,343 --> 00:44:42,773
You should go home now.

697
00:44:42,843 --> 00:44:45,243
Why are you annoying me
by coming to my house?

698
00:44:45,313 --> 00:44:46,983
Don't you have any place to be
on the weekend?

699
00:44:47,053 --> 00:44:50,053
I don't. You know that we broke up.

700
00:44:55,023 --> 00:44:57,563
Oh, right. Why did you meet up
with Do Woo-jae earlier?

701
00:44:57,623 --> 00:44:59,893
He came by to go to the library
with Ko Eun-taek.

702
00:45:00,263 --> 00:45:01,763
I met him by chance too.

703
00:45:02,263 --> 00:45:05,333
-Hold on. Something's strange.
-What is?

704
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,003
Do Woo-jae came to see Ko Eun-taek,

705
00:45:08,073 --> 00:45:09,433
but how did he see you?

706
00:45:10,003 --> 00:45:11,643
Were the two of you together this morning?

707
00:45:14,473 --> 00:45:15,543
Oh, right.

708
00:45:16,573 --> 00:45:19,713
There was a situation for that.

709
00:45:20,413 --> 00:45:21,413
Really?

710
00:45:23,883 --> 00:45:25,753
But you're lasting
for a long time this time.

711
00:45:26,453 --> 00:45:27,753
When will you get back with him?

712
00:45:28,323 --> 00:45:30,963
I'm not getting back with him.
It's for real this time.

713
00:45:31,023 --> 00:45:32,563
For real, my foot.

714
00:45:40,703 --> 00:45:41,703
Are you serious?

715
00:45:42,433 --> 00:45:45,373
Yes. I did my best,
so I don't have any lingering feelings.

716
00:45:46,003 --> 00:45:48,913
If anyone should have regrets, it should
be Do Woo-jae, that jerk, not me.

717
00:45:49,743 --> 00:45:51,543
Don't be so sure.

718
00:45:52,583 --> 00:45:55,813
That might have been the best he could do.

719
00:45:56,983 --> 00:45:59,253
I'm just saying that everyone has
different methods.

720
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:00,653
Also,

721
00:46:02,123 --> 00:46:04,163
you are quite the exhausting type.

722
00:46:04,223 --> 00:46:06,423
My gosh. I came here to comfort you.

723
00:46:06,493 --> 00:46:08,393
You should be on my side.

724
00:46:10,533 --> 00:46:13,773
But how did the two of you meet?

725
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:17,643
We attended the same academy
in middle school.

726
00:46:17,873 --> 00:46:20,313
I liked him when I first saw him,
so I talked to him first.

727
00:46:20,613 --> 00:46:22,573
What made you fall for him?

728
00:46:22,643 --> 00:46:23,683
No idea.

729
00:46:23,783 --> 00:46:25,983
I guess his looks are my type.

730
00:46:26,043 --> 00:46:27,113
And one more thing.

731
00:46:27,183 --> 00:46:30,383
Even when he's mad, he talks so calmly.

732
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:32,923
That made him look so cool.

733
00:46:33,283 --> 00:46:34,953
Now that I think about it,
there's this one too.

734
00:46:35,023 --> 00:46:37,963
We were arguing once when I ran out
of breath, and he brought me water.

735
00:46:38,023 --> 00:46:39,863
Isn't that so sweet of him?

736
00:46:41,233 --> 00:46:43,903
You said you don't know, but seems
like you can talk about him for days.

737
00:46:43,963 --> 00:46:46,433
I don't know. I just liked him.

738
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,133
It was fun with him even when we weren't
doing anything,

739
00:46:49,203 --> 00:46:51,443
and I felt so comfortable around him.

740
00:46:53,103 --> 00:46:54,413
[Is it too absurd
to talk about movie tickets?]

741
00:46:54,473 --> 00:46:55,543
No. Well,

742
00:46:55,713 --> 00:46:58,343
it's nice to talk about absurd things
once in a while.

743
00:47:00,483 --> 00:47:01,513
Keep going.

744
00:47:03,313 --> 00:47:04,753
[Did you sleep well, Ho-rang?]

745
00:47:05,583 --> 00:47:06,893
[I'm glad, though.]

746
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:09,193
[You seemed more relaxed than before.]

747
00:47:11,093 --> 00:47:14,163
Did he say anything when you two
were eating?

748
00:47:15,163 --> 00:47:16,533
What? Woo-jae?

749
00:47:16,593 --> 00:47:17,663
Yes.

750
00:47:17,733 --> 00:47:19,663
No, let's stop talking about him.

751
00:47:19,733 --> 00:47:21,333
Let's talk about you. What about you?

752
00:47:21,403 --> 00:47:23,203
Don't you have anyone
you've been messaging with?

753
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:24,573
What?

754
00:47:28,613 --> 00:47:29,913
What's with the reaction?

755
00:47:29,973 --> 00:47:31,843
I just said that for fun,
and you fell right for it.

756
00:47:31,913 --> 00:47:33,853
What's going on? Do you have someone?

757
00:47:34,113 --> 00:47:35,313
No, it's nothing like that.

758
00:47:35,383 --> 00:47:37,023
What are you talking about?

759
00:47:37,083 --> 00:47:39,783
You were like this just now.

760
00:47:40,353 --> 00:47:42,223
What is it? Who is it? Tell me.

761
00:47:42,293 --> 00:47:45,193
So, how long has it been since you had
a crush on Ho-rang?

762
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,093
It hasn't been long since I found out,

763
00:47:47,433 --> 00:47:48,563
but it's been a while.

764
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,663
Does she know that you like her?

765
00:47:51,033 --> 00:47:52,433
Yes, I told her.

766
00:47:52,503 --> 00:47:54,133
No way!

767
00:47:54,203 --> 00:47:56,673
It's like the two people you'd
least expect to ever date,

768
00:47:56,733 --> 00:47:58,973
so it's even harder to imagine them
together.

769
00:48:00,003 --> 00:48:01,473
But you two look good together.

770
00:48:02,443 --> 00:48:04,783
You must've been so worried about her
when the incident broke out.

771
00:48:05,383 --> 00:48:07,583
Yes, which is why I just called her now
and she didn't pick up.

772
00:48:09,113 --> 00:48:10,923
Maybe it's because she's with Jae-yi
right now.

773
00:48:10,983 --> 00:48:13,323
Jae-yi? She's with Ho-rang right now?

774
00:48:13,383 --> 00:48:15,793
She asked me for Ho-rang's house address
because she was going over.

775
00:48:15,853 --> 00:48:18,363
What? She was so eager to get rid of me.

776
00:48:20,263 --> 00:48:23,233
Woo-jae, have you not talked to Jae-yi
since then?

777
00:48:23,293 --> 00:48:24,763
No, I haven't.

778
00:48:24,833 --> 00:48:25,963
Hey,

779
00:48:26,233 --> 00:48:28,203
I couldn't ask because Ho-rang was there,

780
00:48:28,273 --> 00:48:31,143
but it clearly seems to me that you two
still have feelings for each other.

781
00:48:31,203 --> 00:48:32,903
So why did you break up?

782
00:48:35,073 --> 00:48:36,843
I felt like if it was going to happen,

783
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:40,383
it'd be better to break up
when we still have

784
00:48:40,453 --> 00:48:42,183
some good feelings left for each other.

785
00:48:42,253 --> 00:48:44,253
What a difficult man you are.

786
00:48:45,223 --> 00:48:48,253
Guys, when is So-hyun coming?
What's taking her so long?

787
00:48:48,323 --> 00:48:49,723
-Ji So-hyun?
-Yes.

788
00:48:49,793 --> 00:48:51,223
She's not coming today.

789
00:48:51,293 --> 00:48:53,523
-What?
-She's studying at a cafe today.

790
00:48:53,593 --> 00:48:55,563
What? You should've told me earlier!

791
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:57,503
I came here with you two just for So-hyun!

792
00:48:57,563 --> 00:49:00,263
I only came for So-hyun, you know.

793
00:49:00,333 --> 00:49:01,803
Why did you have to do that?

794
00:49:02,833 --> 00:49:06,403
I didn't mean to eavesdrop,

795
00:49:06,473 --> 00:49:10,073
but I received that message too.

796
00:49:10,243 --> 00:49:11,113
Sorry?

"Baek Ho-rang loves the number 16."

798
00:49:13,643 --> 00:49:15,083
-You too?
-Yes.

799
00:49:15,153 --> 00:49:17,383
No way! Who could it be?

800
00:49:17,453 --> 00:49:18,753
No idea.

801
00:49:18,823 --> 00:49:20,553
How did you get it?

802
00:49:20,693 --> 00:49:22,823
I deleted it right away
because I had a bad feeling about it.

803
00:49:22,893 --> 00:49:24,663
It's nothing.

804
