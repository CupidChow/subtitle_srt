1
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:06,810
So Hyeon, you're still here.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,630
Youâ€”

Timing and subtitles brought to you by the ðŸš¨On AirðŸŽ™Team @Viki.com

4
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:28,880
Bye, Ho Rang. I'll see you tomorrow.

5
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:30,400
Okay.

6
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,460
Weren't you going to say something, So Hyeon?

7
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:41,220
Just now, what were you saying?

8
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,000
Oh, that. To-today, good job.

9
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,690
You too. See you tomorrow.

10
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:07,360
Have a safe trip seniors! 

11
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,560
All right. Itinerary, emergency contact information, and supplies.

12
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:14,520
Make sure you check everything. Alright, any questions? 
 - Episode 6 -

13
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,720
Teacher! How are we doing room assignments?

14
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,620
Hey, Baek Ho. Since our bags are going to be heavy, do you want to split up some stuff?

15
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:23,280
- I'll bring the shampoo and conditioner. You bring the face wash. 
 - Alright.

16
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,360
Then, I'll bring the flat iron. Oh, what else do I need?

17
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,870
Then I guess I won't have to bring conditioner. Right?

18
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,660
Crazy, what are you talking about? We'll be in separate rooms.

19
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,590
Oh, you're right.

20
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:43,170
You can bring the pants you wore when we watched the movie.

21
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,980
You looked totally comfortable.

22
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:48,480
Hey, don't insult my pants. Those are expensive.

23
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:57,920
Our video is 5 minutes 30 seconds long. Wanna watch?

24
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,830
Baek Ho Rang, can you give me the USB?

25
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:05,050
I put it in here earlier. Where did it go?

26
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,570
I believe we can narrow it down.

27
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:17,470
- Let me take a look. Send it to me.
- Okay.

28
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:19,870
- Oh, there are ten seconds left. 
 - Until what?

29
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:22,970
Until Eun Taek Sunbaenim walks in. Oh, now there's 5 seconds left.

30
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:27,550
Come on, no matter what there's no way a human being can arrive at the exact secâ€”

31
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:34,510
Wow.

32
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:37,030
Of course.

33
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,210
- You guys know that you are in charge of the program tomorrow, right? 
 - Yes. 
 - Are you sure we don't need to check it again?

34
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,700
You've already checked it six times. It's perfect.

35
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:49,110
Alright, then. We're just going to check the fitting on the screen and finish.

36
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:52,670
Okay.

37
00:02:52,670 --> 00:02:56,460
You and me. We live on like that.

38
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,960
Like that, we laugh and cry again.

39
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,260
What did you record with?

40
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:03,870
My phone. Why? Is there a problem?

41
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:06,420
Who records audios with a phone? This isn't a guide recording.

42
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,560
Jung Hee Soo, what were you doing not checking this when editing?

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,590
Oh, I thought she would know.

44
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:15,740
Oh, sorry. I should've checked earlier.

45
00:03:15,740 --> 00:03:17,360
Re-do this by the end of the week.

46
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,420
End of this week? When we leave for the retreat tomorrow, this week will be over.

47
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:25,090
You can do it after you come back from the trip. You also have the weekend.

48
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,190
Sorry. Let's do it together.

49
00:03:28,190 --> 00:03:31,360
Baek Ho Rang's in charge of cleaning. Everyone else is dismissed.

50
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,620
Okay.

51
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:37,270
I'll match whenever you're free. Give me a text.

52
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,200
Okay.

53
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,410
Hello?

54
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:58,910
Hey, should I bring my hair straightener or curler?

55
00:03:58,910 --> 00:04:01,700
- Oh, that's right. Tomorrow's the retreat. 
 - What?

56
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:04,050
Because of someone, I've been busy cleaning the broadcasting room.

57
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,850
- I forgot that it was the retreat tomorrow. 
 - What?

58
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:08,650
Should I bring the curler or the straightener?

59
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:11,560
- Yeah, I'll probably be working even after I get back. 
 - Whatever, I'll just bring the flat one.

60
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:15,390
- Alright, talk to you later. 
 - Hey, hey!

61
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:20,170
So, which hair tool is she bringing?

62
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:24,050
Straightenâ€” huh? What the heck?

63
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,300
I heard everything. Kang Jae Yi's voice is naturally loud.

64
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:32,560
You were reassured that I was quiet for a while?

65
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,290
And I let a few things slide when you were going through the rough time.

66
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,250
I wrote down every time you did something wrong. Should I show you?

67
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,960
Oh, forget it.

68
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,590
October 5th, 4 minutes late. October 12th, 13 minutes and 20 seconds late.

69
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:46,930
- October 15th, didn't return supplies to the closet. 
 - Hey.

70
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,250
Wow, you were late a lot.

71
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,120
I really hate people who aren't on time.

72
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:54,480
When was the time you told me I was pretty decent?

73
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,570
Oh, the pretty decent times. There are a few.

74
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:00,330
October 16th, on time. October 19th, returned supplies to the closet.

75
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,460
Ahh! I get it, so be quiet.

76
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,460

 Broadcasting Department: Ji So Hyeon, Jung Hee Soo, Kim Eun Ha, Kim Hee Won.

78
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:33,850
- What is that? 
 - Nothing special.

79
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:38,200
But did you see this?

80
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:42,820
You know we have to do the folk dance? Isn't that so lame?

81
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,120
- Hey, can't you knock? 
 - Let me use your laptop.

82
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:52,380
Why are you using mine instead of yours?

83
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:57,660
Ugh, what is this? Are you going to a funeral for an overnight trip?

84
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:02,290
- Your tastes suck 
 - Why you littleâ€”

85
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,670
[Kang Jae Yi] 
Sorry.

86
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:18,640
I downloaded something from Netflix and realized that I used your account.

87
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,600
- It's okay. 
 - I already sent money to your account and I'll log out right now.

88
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,960
You don't need to respond.

89
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:35,530
I said don't lie down!

90
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,260
Hey, can't I use your mattress? It's so comfortable.

91
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:41,130
You're acting like you own this place.

92
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:43,580
You even packed like you're immigrating somewhere.

93
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:47,660
Hey! It's only this size because it's one day.

94
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:50,840
But why aren't your parents home? I thought I'd need to meet them so I even brought juice.

95
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,890
Forget the juice and get up. You said you wanted to do your makeup.

96
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:57,140
Just five minutes.

97
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:59,060
Yes.

98
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,130
(Checks messages from yesterday)

99
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:17,870
Ugh.

100
00:07:29,130 --> 00:07:32,350
Hey, I used some of your wet tissues.

102
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,470
- That's that, right? 
 - What, this?

103
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:44,100
Yeah, a lot of people use it. Let me see.

104
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:51,090
- Let's go. 
 - No.

Seoyeon High School

106
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:59,070
So excited about the retreat! Are you scared it will be empty and canceled? I heard they are mixing us up!

107
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,130
Hi, Ji So Hyeon.

108
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,010
- Hi, So Hyeon. 
 - Hi, Yoo Sin.

109
00:08:09,010 --> 00:08:12,310
- But this is the bus for class 3â€” 
 - Which brings me to my request.

110
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:15,420
Trade seats with me. Please!

111
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:18,190
- No. Hurry and go. 
 - No, please!

112
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,120
- I even bought a bunch of snacks for So Hyeon. 
 -You can give these to her and go.

113
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,020
Is everyone here?

114
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:26,920
Let's take attendance!

115
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,550
- Kim Hyun Sung? 
 - Yes.

116
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,390
- Do Woo Jae. 
 - Yes.

117
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:32,430
- Ra In Sung? 
 - Teacher!

118
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,150
Huh? Park Eun Bi?

119
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:39,140

[Hot Men's Chatroom] 
 [Yoo Sin] Woo Jae, thankfully I saw that you also wore a hat today.

122
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,380
The bus for Class 1 should be nearby~ Love you!

123
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,740
Ugh, Kim Yoo Sin.

124
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,600
But why isn't Kim Yoo Sin here?

125
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,690
Isn't he lost somewhere?

126
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:07,920
What are you doing here, Do Woo Jae?

127
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,870
Oh. Hi.

128
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:16,760
I'm not lending it to you.

129
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,430
Everyone here? Don't get too excited and put your seatbelt on.

130
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:32,570
- Hey, Kang Jae Yi. Have you seen this? 
 - Yeah, I saw it.

131
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,430
- Isn't it obvious? 
 - Right?

132
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:36,400
- It's obviously this. 
 - It's this.

133
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:39,510
What are you saying? Don't you know that top=up and bottom=down?

134
00:09:39,510 --> 00:09:42,710
People also differentiate between top and bottom this way, so it's this.

135
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,650
Hey, think about it. When kids crawl around when they're young,

136
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:49,380
do you think that their arms and legs start off by being considered their 'bottom' but then change later on?

137
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:55,410
No, it's not. It's the same with them.

138
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:00,130
Kids, we're all here.

139
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:03,470
Look alive! Make sure you collect your trash.

140
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:06,660
Someone wake up those sleeping in the back!

141
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:09,950
Kang Jae Yi! Wake up!

142
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,980
Hey, Baek Ho Rang.

- Do you want me to take it? 
 - Really? Thank you!

147
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:05,230
I'll take it. One, twoâ€” oh!

148
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:08,940

00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,740
Thank you. I'll take it.

155
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,870
One, two, three!

156
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:37,970
Everyone, move quickly! Gather around.

157
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:39,610
Did you like it?

158
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:43,280
Mmm. It was the happiest moment of my life.

159
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:48,550
Oh, so it was? Because of someone, it was the worst moment of my life.

160
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:51,700
Okay, the first item on the agenda is folk dancing.

161
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,600
Please welcome the teacher with a warm welcome.

162
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:59,240
First, let's stand arms-length apart.

163
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,570
We'll begin when you're all ready. Hold both of your partner's hands and girls take a step with your right foot. One.

164
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:10,230
Two. Turn around and clap two times.

165
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:15,670
Then, get closer with your partner. I'll show you how.

166
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:19,470
Just trust me, So Hyeon. I'm a great dancer.

167
00:12:35,550 --> 00:12:37,590
What are you doing? You have to step back.

168
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,060
Huh?

169
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,770
What the heck. You said to trust you.

170
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:46,480
I know, right?

171
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:56,720
- Should we dance again? 
 - Okay.

172
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:01,550
Argh. I really hate this dance.

173
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:05,170
Why did we come all this way just to do a pig dance?

174
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:07,390
- What are you talking about? 
 - What?

175
00:13:07,390 --> 00:13:11,730
Pork dance, pig dance.

176
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:16,490
- Never mind. 
 - What the heck!

177
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:18,650
Look at them!

178
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:24,230
- Can you let go? 
 - Oh. Sorry.

179
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,100
Next, group two get on the stage please.

180
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:34,770
You guys are really intense. Can I take a look?

181
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:36,240
Yeah.

182
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:41,790
I thought that the broadcasting team was the most intense, but you guys are the same.

183
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:45,050
Why are you doing this? It looks bothersome.

184
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:50,160
Then why are you doing broadcasting? If you think about it, you're weirder.

185
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:53,180
Well... it just happened that way.

186
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:55,370
It just happened that way for me, too.

187
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:58,510
Hey, everyone's already heard that you guys are awkward.

188
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:02,770
- I'm not cold. 
 - It looked like your clothes were riding up when dancing earlier.

189
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,910
Do Woo Jae, the teacher wants to see you.

190
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,600
Okay.

191
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,910
How was he with Kang Jae Yi earlier?

192
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,680
Earlier? Oh, on the bus?

193
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,300
It was quite a scene. You should've seen their faces.

194
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:25,200
Hey, Go Eun Taek. Hold this for a sec.

195
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:26,890
This?

196
00:14:27,930 --> 00:14:31,470
Is it fair that we have to dance in such hot weather?

197
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,150
What the heck? You don't have a hair tie, do you?

198
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,870
Would I?

199
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:41,560
Oh. Do you want at least this?

200
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,280
Hey, how can you tie your hair with that?

201
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:46,940
Why? I think it would work.

202
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:19,730
How is it? Is it uncomfortable?

203
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:23,810
It's not uncomfortable, but isn't it weird?

204
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:34,380
No. It looks pretty.

205
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:50,620
Where did Do Woo Jae go?

206
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,550
I don't know.

207
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:58,590
- Look at those two. 
 - What are they? Are they dating?

208
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:01,510
But, Baek Ho Rang, what happened with that situation earlier?

209
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:03,970
Didn't it become calm pretty fast?

210
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:06,830
Applause. Next is team 3.

211
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:12,130
I know. It's annoying.

212
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,220
753411

213
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,050
Oh right, when you posted your statement. The sixteen number what it means?

214
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:06,830
Oh that? I don't know. Someone told me through DM.

215
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:15,390
I for sure had it at the field earlier.

216
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:18,440
We'll take a look. Room 345, right?

217
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,390
Yes. Thank you.

218
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:26,570
- Isn't he good looking? 
 - I don't know.

219
00:17:26,570 --> 00:17:29,470
Did you try calling me?

220
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:32,420
I tried three times, but I told you there's no answer.

221
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:34,970
Student 345. One moment.

222
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:37,050
Someone picked this up.

223
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:40,130
Oh, really? That's a relief.

224
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:42,050
Please follow me.

225
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:44,190
Go ahead without me.

226
00:17:45,270 --> 00:17:48,040
- Come here.
 - Hurry.

227
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,430
Girls from class 5 want to hang out.

228
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:52,610
- Who? Who? 
 - The red-headed girl. 
 - When?
 - Later.

229
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:10,820
My hat!

230
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:14,510
Don't you think that our guard is handsome? He's really cute.

231
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:16,690
Hey, but is that yours?

232
00:18:16,690 --> 00:18:20,380
- What did you say? 
 - I asked if that's yours.

233
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:22,920
It is Do Woo Jae's. He left it in the bus earlier.

234
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:26,870
Now that we're talking about it, you give it to Go Eun Taek and ask him to give it to Do Woo Jae.

235
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,810
Really? All right.

236
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:34,490
Speaking of Do Woo Jae, he laughed a lot when he saw you today.

237
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:36,690
It's the first time I saw him with such an expression.

238
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:38,700
- Do Woo Jae? 
 - Yes.

239
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,870
He was probably laughing at how funny I was.

240
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:45,490
Well, how is it going on for you?

241
00:18:45,490 --> 00:18:48,290
- What about me? 
 - Wasn't there someone you've been chatting with?

242
00:18:48,290 --> 00:18:51,680
No, or should I say someone you're flirting with?

243
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:54,400
- It's nothing like that. 
 - What do you mean nothing?

244
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,540
So, which school is he from? Where does he live? How many times do you guys contact each other a day?

245
00:18:57,540 --> 00:19:00,750
Forget it. It's already complicated, so don't ask.

246
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:03,400
If he's a nice kid, you should just date. What is there to think about?

247
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:06,110
Don't think it much. Just for it. That's the answer.

248
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:08,070
Why don't you just go for it?

249
00:19:08,070 --> 00:19:09,660
Hey, Iâ€”

250
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:12,280
Lights are out in one minute!

251
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,280
Am I nuts?

252
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,950
Do Woo Jae 

253
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:29,300
Who was just now?

254
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:32,640
Gosh. That scared me.

255
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,010
Do Woo Jae is unavailable. 
 Press to call again.

256
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:40,070
What do I do?

257
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:42,850
Hey, what's the matter?

258
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,930
Nothing.

259
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:49,410
Sorry. I pressed the wrong button.

260
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,440
Is there something you want to say?

261
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:03,180
Yes, you left your hat on the bus. I'll give it to you tomorrow.

262
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:06,100
Okay.

263
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:11,200
What I'm going to do? I'm stupid.

264
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:14,260
It's going to collapse!

265
00:20:16,550 --> 00:20:18,170
Instead of tomorrow, do you want to give it to me now?

266
00:20:18,170 --> 00:20:21,670
Holy!

267
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:24,940
Hey, where did you put the curling iron earlier?

268
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,480
I'll come over. Stay there.

269
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,390
I already came out. The supervisor isn't here.

270
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:08,690
I told you to stay there.

271
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,910
I don't think he left yet.

272
00:21:42,810 --> 00:21:44,440
Here.

273
00:21:45,080 --> 00:21:46,740
Thank you.

274
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:55,590
Did you call me out at this time to get this?

275
00:21:55,590 --> 00:21:57,120
No.

276
00:22:01,550 --> 00:22:03,600
It's because I missed you.

277
00:22:11,660 --> 00:22:14,190
I missed you, Jae Yi.

278
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:45,500
What's with your expression?

279
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,710
I can't delete this. Send it to me.

280
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:50,920
Send me the pictures we took on the bus too.

281
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:56,650
Photos 

282
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,120
Ji So Hyeon 

283
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,760
Why don't we meet for a bit?

284
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:14,160
Did you get your phone?

285
00:23:24,290 --> 00:23:26,030
So Hyeon.

286
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:30,360
My phone... Did you perhapsâ€”

287
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,320
I took it.

288
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:38,250
- Why? 
 - There was something I wanted to confirm. I was right.

289
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:43,360
It was you. The person who uploaded Baek Ho Rang's picture.

290
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:49,130
And the person who wrote stories to provoke Baek Ho Rang, who sent DM to Park Hye Rim

291
00:23:49,130 --> 00:23:53,350
and the one who posted the photo online during the festival, it was all you.

292
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:57,130
So Hyeon.

293
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:59,060
You can't do that.

294
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:02,470
- How could you take someone else's phoneâ€” 
 - What?

295
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:07,280
Did you think others would live correctly except you?

296
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:13,180
- Why did you do it? 
 - Did I not tell you?

297
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:16,750
I was in the same class as her in middle school.

298
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,580
She doesn't even remember a classmate she spent a whole year with.

299
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:25,530
She has no regard for me, and that pisses me off.

300
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:29,350
You also know this, So Hyeon.

301
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:32,840
When she talks, she looks down on people and manipulates them.

302
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:35,880
She was also a nobody like me in the first year.

303
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,100
But she continues getting attention when she didn't even deserve it.

304
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:43,360
We were on the same level, and she still pretends to be different.

305
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:47,590
That's why I let her know. Baek Ho Rang...

306
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:51,350
That's not the place she should be in.

307
00:24:51,350 --> 00:24:53,860
She belongs right here, below.

308
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:01,890
It was a little disappointing when the people thought she was the bully.

309
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:05,260
- What do you mean by that?  
 - That's true.

310
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:09,500
She acted like she didn't know her place,

311
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:12,450
so she had it coming.

312
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:14,320
"Had it coming"?

313
00:25:16,030 --> 00:25:22,420
So Hyeon, do you think I made up that post?

314
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:28,450
Do you know that? Actually, Baek Ho Rang

315
00:25:28,450 --> 00:25:31,570
hates the number 16.

316
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:35,490
You're curious too, aren't you? About what happened that day.

317
00:25:38,300 --> 00:25:43,060
School violence. That's right.

318
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:49,000
That day, Baek Ho Rang was beaten up by Lee Sun Joo.

319
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:01,940
Two years ago 

320
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:06,230
16 

321
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:23,120
Happy birthday!

322
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,690
Happy birthday!

323
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:31,060
- Who is that? 
 - My best friend. 
 - Best friend!

324
00:26:31,060 --> 00:26:36,560
- Now that you've seen me, that's enough, right? I'll get going now. 
 - Where are you going?

325
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:41,120
Are you trying to insult me after I set all this up for you?

326
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:44,900
Sit down.

327
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:48,930
Let's go and play.

328
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,290
- You're insane! 
 - Who wants that?

329
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,570
Get it away!

330
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:59,520
So cute!

331
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:06,400
An elephant needs to spin around like this.

332
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:30,160
â™« Open your eyes Mind your own business â™«

333
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:36,420
- I think she smells. 
 - I have perfume. Wait a sec.

334
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:39,260
- It's expensive, so don't spray much. 
 - Okay

335
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:42,640
â™« Whose warmth prayer â™«

336
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,100
â™« A helping hand â™«

337
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:51,260
How many times should I spray it?

338
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:56,600
â™« But I go high â™«

339
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:03,370
â™« Yeah, but I go high â™«

340

Clean this before you go. I'd be in trouble if the owner called our school.

344
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:27,010
You wouldn't like that either, would you?

345
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:14,090
â™« But I go high, yeah â™«

Angel Karaoke

350
00:31:01,370 --> 00:31:04,890
Is that true?

351
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:08,480
- If you're bluffing, youâ€”  
 - I saw it with my own eyes.

352
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:15,130
She hung out with them pretending to be all good, and in the end sheâ€”

353
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:19,030
I felt so much pity for her. But then, what's with this now?

354
00:31:19,030 --> 00:31:23,730
She kept quiet about it and couldn't even remember me.

355
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:29,120
So Hyeon, you hate her too. I know all about it. You guys were close before and then you had a falling-out.

356
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:32,320
She will never confess that she was bullied.

357
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:38,220
Look at her now, she can't say anything and she is being framed as a bully, but she's staying quiet.

358
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:42,410
- So, as long as you pretend you don't know anythingâ€” 
 - Wait.

359
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:45,130
I haven't gotten all of this straight yet.

360
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,040
Can you just shut up for a moment?

361
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,270
Let me lay this out for you.

362
00:31:49,270 --> 00:31:51,410
So Baek Ho Rang...

363
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:55,880
ended your friendship because she didn't want to show you how pathetic she is.

364
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:59,830
Do you get it now?

365
00:31:59,830 --> 00:32:04,830
She hid from you all this time because she was scared to tell you she got beat up.

366
00:32:12,150 --> 00:32:13,660
What did you say?

367
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,280
It's your birthday next month. What do you want to do?

368
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:22,300
Let's go to the amusement park. We can wear headbands and take pictures.

369
00:32:22,300 --> 00:32:25,850
Hey, we're not kids.

370
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:28,010
- Should I search up admission prices? 
 - Yeah.

371
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:35,120
Baek Ho Rang, are you stupid or what? Keep your mouth shut.

372
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,610
What was that? Why does she type like that?

373
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:42,350
Hey, she's a friend. She's just joking around.

374
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:49,880
So we're going to the amusement park on your birthday, then.

375
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:52,980
I promise! I promise.

376
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:07,590
- Hey! Ji So Hyeon! 
 - Hey!

377
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,590
Ta-da! I bought spicy rice cakes!

378
00:33:09,590 --> 00:33:13,630
- Sounds good, right? 
 - Didn't you say you ate with Lee Sun Joo?

379
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:16,800
I did, but how should I put it?

380
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:24,230
I felt like my day wouldn't be complete if I didn't have spicy rice cakes with you right now?

381
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:28,930
- What was that? 
 - It just is.

382
00:33:28,930 --> 00:33:31,900
The time of day when I'm most comfortable.

383
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:37,920
So I'm going to stop by often.

384
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:40,350
Without letting you know beforehand, like today.

385
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:47,860
But, what if we end up going to different high schools?

386
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:51,440
Even if we do, we can still meet up every day.

387
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,890
Well, we do live near each other.

388
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,890
It's unfair now that I think about it.

389
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:20,520
You looked way too fine after breaking up with me, Do Woo Jae.

390
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:23,950
- Did I look that way? 
 - Yeah, completely.

391
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,260
I did try to live normally.

392
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:30,990
After breaking up with you, Jae Yi.

393
00:34:30,990 --> 00:34:33,800
What the hell, Do Woo Jae.

394
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,190
But I wasn't okay at all.

395
00:34:37,190 --> 00:34:43,070
Without you, there wasn't a reason to get angry or laugh.

396
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:46,740
I wasn't happy at all.

397
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,020
That's how I knew for sure

398
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:55,560
that the feelings I had for you were very special to me.

399
00:34:56,920 --> 00:35:01,700
We fought a lot, but it turns out

400
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,100
they were still meaningful.

401
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:11,010
It might also be the reason I became selfish.

402
00:35:13,390 --> 00:35:14,890
Jae Yi,

403
00:35:17,030 --> 00:35:20,100
go out with me again.

404
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:27,050
I'll try my absolute best.

405
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:38,560
Hey, Do Woo Jae, it's the same for me.

406
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:45,290
After we broke up, I also thought of you every day and wondered how you were coping.

407
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:47,700
I'll also do my absolute best.

408
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,450
If you answer late, I'll wait as long as it takes.

409
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:52,890
I'll try harder to understand you.

410
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:58,800
So from now on, don't think on your own and make decisions by yourself.

411
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,430
I'm going to kill you.

412
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:03,630
Okay, I won't.

413
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:10,700
Let's go in now. You'll catch a cold.

414
00:36:12,130 --> 00:36:18,540
Wait. You know, Woo Jae, should we keep us getting back together a secret?

415
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,530
- Why? 
 - The thing is...

416
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:26,060
I kind of talked crap about you, so there needs to be a transition period.

417
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:33,030
- You're so honest. 
 - Well, it wasn't really talking crap.

418
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,720
I just told everyone I knew that I would never date you again.

419
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,530
- You told everyone you knew... 
 - Come on, just hear me out.

420
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:42,160
I guess you talked to a lot of people.

421
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:47,460
- Helâ€” 
 - Where are you, Baek Ho Rang?

422
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:50,530
That's what I should be saying. Why aren't you picking up?

423
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:53,570
- Where are you? 
 - Me? I just returned to the dorm.

424
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,700
- But why are there kids from different class? 
 - What?

425
00:36:56,700 --> 00:37:01,110
- Damn it. 
 - Why, what is it? 
 - I came outside because I thought you'd be out.

426
00:37:01,110 --> 00:37:02,230
Okay, I'm hanging up.

427
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:05,630
Okay. Come in quickly! I'll be washing up.

428
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,600
What is it?

429
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:19,310
Hey, don't hang up until I get back to the dorm.

430
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:23,330
It's right around the corner. What are you so afraid of?

431
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:25,270
I'm walking right now,

432
00:37:25,270 --> 00:37:27,980
but I hear something behind meâ€”

433
00:37:54,320 --> 00:38:00,240
What? Why aren't you saying anything? Hey, if you're so scared, why don't you call your flirt?

434
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:04,380
When you're having a flirt, you're finding excuses to callâ€”

435
00:38:08,470 --> 00:38:10,220
Is she talking about me?

436
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:15,740
No. That...

437
00:38:24,170 --> 00:38:26,480
I'd like it if she were talking about me.

438
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:43,230
I'll check this area. Okay.

439
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:45,810
Hey, follow me.

440
00:38:54,470 --> 00:39:00,300
Gosh. What is that? Why they're out at this time? Don't they sleep?

441
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:03,190
Because kids like you won't listen and will walk around.

442
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:08,210
What are you saying? I went out to look for Kang Jae Yi because she didn't come back in.

443
00:39:08,210 --> 00:39:10,090
Kang Jae Yi?

444
00:39:10,090 --> 00:39:12,650
Now that I think about it, Do Woo Jae wasn't in the room either.

445
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:16,560
They must be seeing each other.

446
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,560
Is that what it was?

447
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:22,760
Kang Jae Yi told me to just go for it and confessâ€”

448
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:27,670
Confess what?

449
00:39:27,670 --> 00:39:32,810
Does it have to do with the flirt she said earlier?

450
00:39:32,810 --> 00:39:38,880
Enough, you already heard it, why do you keep asking?

451
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,040
- Give me your arm. 
 - My arm?

452
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,810
What about you?

453
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:50,780
Why are you out here so late?

454
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,600
I just couldn't fall asleep

455
00:39:55,600 --> 00:39:59,550
Did you forget to write what time to sleep in your planner?

456
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:03,330
- Come on. 
 - What is it then?

457
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,830
Did something happen?

458
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:13,990
Nothing happened. Just because.

459
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:22,760
Do you remember that day we went to the roof while we were preparing for the festival?

460
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:25,750
- The first time we went to the roof? 
 - Yeah.

461
00:40:25,750 --> 00:40:31,050
I told you earlier that there is a person who keeps breaking their promises, right?

462
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:36,630
What should I do? I don't think I'll be able to keep my promise.

463
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,570
Can we meet another day?

464
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,630
She sent me a message, and she said she wants to meet with me.

465
00:40:44,610 --> 00:40:47,800
I told her I don't want to

466
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,870
but it felt a bit weird.

467
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,560
Go Eun Taek,

468
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:04,400
can I ask who it is that you're talking about?

469
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:11,630
If you don't want to say it, you don't have to.

470
00:41:11,630 --> 00:41:13,820
I was just curious.

471
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,470
It's my mom.

472
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,070
When I was younger my parents got divorced

473
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:29,010
and my mom left home after that.

474
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:34,500
I see.

475
00:41:34,500 --> 00:41:37,000
I didn't know.

476
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,110
She promised me that she'd come back,

477
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:43,260
then she never contacted me.

478
00:41:45,670 --> 00:41:47,650
She's not that great of a mom, is she?

479
00:41:50,710 --> 00:41:52,600
So I resent her.

480
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,400
She shouldn't have made the promise.

481
00:42:00,140 --> 00:42:03,080
Couldn't it have been because she was scared?

482
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:12,310
Because she loved you, and only wanted to show her best to you.

483
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,710
I understand her.

484
00:42:18,190 --> 00:42:21,130
The more you like someone,

485
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:25,310
the more you want to hide.

486
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:33,450
I'm not sure, I don't really get it.

487
00:42:33,450 --> 00:42:35,530
It sounds like an excuse.

488
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:41,490
The other person is hurt without even knowing the reason,

489
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:43,950
and that behavior shows that she doesn't care.

490
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:50,730
That's why I dislike them.

491
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:52,980
People who lie.

492
00:43:01,050 --> 00:43:05,030
I'm sorry, I got too serious didn't I?

493
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:10,500
Should we go? No one should be there now.

494
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:13,440
Sure, let's go.

495
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,220
Ji So Hyeon, did you sleep well?

496
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:36,000
Yeah, hi.

497
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:37,810
Good morning.

498
00:43:37,810 --> 00:43:41,200
Why are your eyes so puffy? Did you not sleep well.

499
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:44,920
- Oh, just a little. 
 - Oh! I left my charger in the room.

500
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:48,060
Baek Ho Rang, stay right here and don't leave me.

501
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:56,590
What are you hiding?

502
00:43:56,590 --> 00:43:59,310
Don't try to know.

503
00:43:59,310 --> 00:44:01,920
You should just

504
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:04,540
see things the way they seem.

505
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,560
Hey, Baek Ho Rang.

506
00:44:13,250 --> 00:44:18,430
Bring the luggage closer, so you don't block the people who are passing.

507
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:33,830
Jung Hee Soo

508
00:44:33,830 --> 00:44:39,360
Jung Hee Soo, I will shut my mouth just as you said, so you should stop here. 

509
00:44:47,560 --> 00:44:48,810
My hands are dry.

510
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,700
Does anyone have hand cream?

511
00:44:57,870 --> 00:44:59,660
Thank you.

512
00:45:01,250 --> 00:45:03,400
Why am I so tired?

513
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,150
Right? My neck is hurting.

514
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:10,520
We did over-exert ourselves.

515
00:45:12,060 --> 00:45:15,910
Hold on, if you guys are tired why are you just sitting here?

516
00:45:15,910 --> 00:45:20,620
I'm waiting for So Hyeon, but why are you two here?

517
00:45:20,620 --> 00:45:22,470
Are you waiting for someone?

518
00:45:23,790 --> 00:45:27,840
Go Eun Taek and I are going the same way.

519
00:45:28,710 --> 00:45:30,520
- Okay. 
 - What?

520
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:32,380
Ok. Let's just say it's that way.

521
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:35,620
- What about you, Kang Jae Yi? 
 - Me?

522
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:38,110
I'm just...

523
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:39,530
They're coming.

524
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,660
I'm leaving now.

525
00:45:40,660 --> 00:45:43,140
I'll get going, see you guys at school.

526
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:45,710
Bye.

527
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,470
Look at her avoiding Woo Jae.

528
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:51,480
I'll get going too.

529
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,130
Bye.

530
00:45:54,460 --> 00:45:56,490
Are you guys going home?

531
00:45:56,490 --> 00:45:58,030
Wanna go eat?

532
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:01,460
We were going to get dinner, wanna go together?

533
00:46:03,710 --> 00:46:05,990
I don't mind.

534
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:11,090
Then let's go together.

535
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,220
Do you want to eat pizza? There's a new pizza store.

536
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,470
Wait up!

537
00:46:20,690 --> 00:46:25,250
So Hyeon, did you sleep early yesterday?  I called you, but you didn't answer.

538
00:46:25,250 --> 00:46:28,870
I was tired yesterday, so I went to sleep early. What about you?

539
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:32,800
Because I couldn't contact you, I went to his room and I slept there.

540
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,030
Aren't you and Woo Jae in the same room?

541
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,950
Why wasn't he there when I came?

542
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:39,480
The thing is,

543
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,120
- he went out to see Kang Jae Yi. 
 - Hey, what are you two doing?

544
00:46:44,120 --> 00:46:46,490
You guys went the other way, why did you guys come here?

545
00:46:46,490 --> 00:46:49,000
- We came in the opposite direction on purpose. 
 - Wow!

546
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,610
What, did you guys know?

547
00:46:51,610 --> 00:46:54,380
- Are you guys dating again? 
 - How did you know?

548
00:46:54,380 --> 00:46:57,190
- Hey, Do Woo Jae, did you tell them? 
 - No.

549
00:46:58,020 --> 00:46:59,690
What?

550
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:05,390
Thank you.

551
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:08,700
- Eat up. 
 - Thanks.

552
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,150
- Eat this, So Hyeon. 
 - Thanks.

553
00:47:11,150 --> 00:47:13,380
Tell me exactly. When did you guys get back together?

554
00:47:13,380 --> 00:47:15,690
Exactly, I thought you guys would never get back together.

555
00:47:15,690 --> 00:47:17,540
When did I ever say that?

556
00:47:17,540 --> 00:47:20,120
What, you spend an hour at my houseâ€”

557
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:24,630
Don't say nonsense. Hey, that's why I didn't tell you about us.

558
00:47:24,630 --> 00:47:26,890
How did you guys start dating again?

559
00:47:26,890 --> 00:47:30,680
Exactly, who decided to get back together first?

560
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:37,520
The thing is, he left his hat on the bus and I went to give it back and...

561
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:40,780
No one went first.

562
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:46,350
Why aren't you guys surprised, am I the only one who didn't know?

563
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:49,370
Now that it's come to this, don't you think you are the problem?

564
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:52,530
I was surprised when Eun Taek said he liked Ho Rang.

565
00:47:52,530 --> 00:47:56,420
Go Eun Taek, do you like her? Since when?

566
00:47:56,420 --> 00:47:57,980
You're surprised too.

567
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:01,420
Kim Yoo Sin, how did youâ€”

568
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:04,050
How did you know that he liked me?

569
00:48:04,050 --> 00:48:08,330
Baek Ho Rang, is he the flirt that you've been talking about?

570
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:10,380
- Eat up. 
 - Hey, stop!

571
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:12,540
So Hyeon is getting bored, let's talk about something else.

572
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:14,700
No, I'm listening.

573
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:16,890
Congrats on getting back together.

574
00:48:16,890 --> 00:48:19,160
Thanks, Ji So Hyeon.

575
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,370
Can I have the menu?

576
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:45,140
Did something happen?

577
00:48:45,140 --> 00:48:49,220
- What? 
 - You weren't eating earlier.

578
00:48:49,220 --> 00:48:51,240
I'm fine.

579
00:48:51,240 --> 00:48:55,830
I seriously had no idea that you liked Baek Ho Rang.

580
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,140
You're not feeling disappointed, right?

581
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:03,970
Me? Why would I?

582
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:08,110
Because you guys aren't on good terms.

583
00:49:08,110 --> 00:49:12,250
I told you that that's between me and her.

584
00:49:12,250 --> 00:49:17,060
I hope it works out for you guys.

585
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:21,240
Are things still bad between you guys?

586
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,470
I still dislike her.

587
00:49:26,480 --> 00:49:31,280
I'm going to keep more distance because I hate her more now.

588
00:49:33,900 --> 00:49:38,400
So, stay beside her.

589
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:39,520
What?

590
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:45,890
It was nice seeing so many people on Baek Ho Rang's side.

591
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:50,360
So Hyeon.

592
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:53,510
- Here. 
 - Thank you.

593
00:49:53,510 --> 00:49:56,220
Where are you going? We're going downtown.

594
00:49:56,220 --> 00:49:59,110
I'm going to take So Hyeon home, that's okay, right?

595
00:49:59,110 --> 00:50:01,660
- What about you guys? 
 - We're going home.

596
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:02,730
It's late.

597
00:50:02,730 --> 00:50:05,400
Okay then, bye everyone, see you at school.

598
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,060
Bye.

599
00:50:07,060 --> 00:50:09,020
- Bye. 
 - I'll carry it.

600
00:50:09,020 --> 00:50:10,660
It's fine.

601
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,500
Let's go.

602
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:32,230
It's coming soon, in 3 minutes.

603
00:50:32,230 --> 00:50:34,140
Have you scheduled the recording?

604
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,420
Please! I'm going to do it in the weekend.

605
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:39,020
I just wanted to ask if we could hang out after you finish recording.

606
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:43,950
Hang out? Kang Jae Yi also asked me the same thing earlier.

607
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:46,860
Is there anywhere that you want to go?

608
00:50:46,860 --> 00:50:51,820
Rather than wanting to go, there's somewhere I need to find.

609
00:50:51,820 --> 00:50:55,300
Someone recommended a list.

610
00:51:06,130 --> 00:51:07,900
What is it?

611
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,190
I'm sorry, you get going first.

612
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:14,590
What?

613
00:51:14,590 --> 00:51:19,060
I have something to do, I'll see you later.

614
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,930
Is something wrong?

615
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:24,960
I'll tell you later.

616
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:29,340
I'll explain everything later.

617
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,250
I downloaded apps for couples again and switched back my passcode to your birthday.

618
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:49,300
- And also the profile pictureâ€” 
 - So Hyeon, would you like to eat another one?

619
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,020
- No, it's okay. 
 - Really?

620
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:53,630
I should do it now since we're talking about it.

621
00:51:56,890 --> 00:52:00,280
Crazy, what is this?

622
00:52:04,490 --> 00:52:06,250
I'm sorry, I know this isn't the right place. 
 [Evidence that Baek Ho Rang is a bully.]

623
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:10,700
But I still can't have my profile on SNS because she bullied me.

624
00:52:10,700 --> 00:52:16,710
And watching her being famous on social media made me want to die.

625
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:26,000
I have somewhere to go, so I'll leave first, sorry.

626
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,720
I'm sorry.

627
00:52:30,260 --> 00:52:32,470
Where are you right now?

628
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,520
Evidence that Baek Ho Rang is a bully. 

629
00:52:45,910 --> 00:52:50,080
You got here quickly. It hasn't been long since we just spoke.

630
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,830
I happened to be in the area.

631
00:52:59,700 --> 00:53:04,320
What? Are you disappointed because I'm completely fine?

632
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,490
That was when I didn't know that it was you.

633
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:14,500
I had a bad feeling since I first saw you. So I did some searching and

634
00:53:15,280 --> 00:53:18,020
it was you.

635
00:53:18,020 --> 00:53:21,100
Gut feelings are really something, you know.

636
00:53:22,370 --> 00:53:24,360
You knew...

637
00:53:25,670 --> 00:53:27,220
that it was me?

638
00:53:27,220 --> 00:53:31,630
How could I not? You left a trail of clues pointing at you.

639
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:35,050
I heard you're in charge of the corner segment.

640
00:53:35,050 --> 00:53:36,330
Corner?

641
00:53:36,330 --> 00:53:40,620
After you used the word 'corner' by mistake... 
 [Broadcasting team? Student Council?]

642
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:43,060
I looked over the messages you sent during lunchtime.

643
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:44,420
You're a picky eater, Ho Rang.

644
00:53:44,420 --> 00:53:46,660
Talking to you on Face... 
 [Lunchtime on September 22nd]

645
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:49,090
is fascinating.

646
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:54,560
Ji So Hyeon - in charge of lunch broadcast on September 22nd.

647
00:53:54,560 --> 00:53:56,970
Jung Hee Soo (2); Kim Eun Ha (1)

648
00:53:56,970 --> 00:54:00,750
Jung Hee Soo (2); Kim Eun Ha (1)

649
00:54:00,750 --> 00:54:05,990
I could check some people on the broadcasting team, but the problem was the student council.

650
00:54:05,990 --> 00:54:09,860
And happened that the student council had a meeting that day. 
 [Student Council Schedule, September 22nd] 
 [Not from the Student Council]

651
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:11,440
I was lucky.

652
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:16,110
After eliminating some names from my list, I had you and some sophomore students left.

653
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:21,690
And with everything I found, the culprit verified her age for me, I was grateful for that.

654
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:26,220
I knew you were stupid but I didn't know you were this dumb.

655
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:33,620
So? Is this everything you have?

656
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:41,290
L-let me explain, Ho Rang. I-I always told you.

657
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:48,280
You're the idiot.

658
00:54:50,290 --> 00:54:54,700
I posted that for you to see.

659
00:54:54,700 --> 00:54:56,300
What?

660
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,860
I said I posted it for you to see.

661
00:54:59,860 --> 00:55:03,040
You'd be a fool if you couldn't discover it was me after seeing that post.

662
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:07,820
If I was intimidated would I have waited here for you to come?

663
00:55:07,820 --> 00:55:11,730
Hey, Ho Rang. Please, think a little.

664
00:55:11,730 --> 00:55:13,950
Your problem is that you're too obvious.

665
00:55:13,950 --> 00:55:17,890
Jung Hee Soo, why are you doing this to me?

666
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:24,140
That's the wrong question.

667
00:55:24,140 --> 00:55:27,500
You should be asking "How much do you know"?

668
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,880
"How much do you know"?

669
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:33,320
Aren't you curious?

670
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,060
You got beat up that day.

671
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:40,500
I saw it all.

672
00:55:45,140 --> 00:55:48,780
You're lucky you're famous now.

673
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:52,510
You looked like such a loser that day.

674
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:55,510
Do you know how terrible I felt?

675
00:55:57,180 --> 00:56:00,890
That's right. You should know your place.

676
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:02,990
Why did you ignore it?

677
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:07,360
Ho Rang, you're already too late.

678
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:11,400
You're not the first person to come to me.

679
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:16,460
- What are you saying now? Is there someone whoâ€” 
 - Yeah.

680
00:56:16,460 --> 00:56:18,810
There she is.

681
00:56:23,270 --> 00:56:28,350
She was the first to come to me.

682
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,040
Ji So Hyeon.

683
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:45,040
Baek Ho Rang.

684
00:56:53,730 --> 00:56:54,760
What are you doing here?

685
00:56:54,760 --> 00:57:01,210
I should be asking you that. What are you doing here?

686
00:57:01,210 --> 00:57:05,170
Answer me! What are you doing here?

687
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:10,220
I only found out recently.

688
00:57:10,220 --> 00:57:15,240
I'll explain everything, but more importantly are you okay?

689
00:57:18,140 --> 00:57:20,260
Am I okay?

690
00:57:21,640 --> 00:57:23,660
It must've been fun for you

691
00:57:23,660 --> 00:57:27,980
You knew everything but pretended you didn't and watched me. I must have looked like a fool to you.

692
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:32,070
No, that isn't it.

693
00:57:32,860 --> 00:57:35,670
How much did you know?

694
00:57:35,670 --> 00:57:38,470
Tell me.

695
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:43,650
I can't understand.

696
00:57:43,650 --> 00:57:48,660
Seeing you here makes me even angrier than what she did to me all this time. Do you know it?

697
00:57:48,660 --> 00:57:54,660
Right, Baek Ho Rang, so listen to me, please.

698
00:57:54,660 --> 00:57:59,650
Ji So Hyeon, you shouldn't have come here today.

699
00:58:06,170 --> 00:58:08,540
Baek Ho Rang!

700
00:58:08,540 --> 00:58:10,750
So Hyeon!

701
00:58:10,750 --> 00:58:16,580
If you had trusted me more, I wouldn't have done this to you.

702
00:58:16,580 --> 00:58:18,200
You.

703
00:58:19,910 --> 00:58:22,020
I'll see you later.

704
00:58:24,190 --> 00:58:25,950
Baek Ho Rang!

705
00:58:34,860 --> 00:58:38,220
Baek Ho Rang! Baek Ho Rang! Hey!

706
00:58:40,580 --> 00:58:44,110
How could you only think about yourself every single time?

707
00:58:44,110 --> 00:58:46,480
You did the same thing two years ago.

708
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:51,280
Do you how much I resented you for pushing me aside so suddenly?

709
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:56,460
And after discovering what happened, I couldn't sleep at all 'cause I was so sorry.

710
00:58:57,360 --> 00:58:59,350
But I pretended not to know,

711
00:58:59,350 --> 00:59:04,060
because you didn't want people to find out. So I kept my mouth shut and did what I could.

712
00:59:04,060 --> 00:59:07,820
What else am I supposed to do?

713
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:16,480
You should've pretended not to know until the end.

714
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:19,500
- What? 
 - You!

715
00:59:22,860 --> 00:59:25,970
You're pitying me right now.

716
00:59:25,970 --> 00:59:32,210
And you're terrible at it. If you were really looking out for me, you should have hidden this until the end!

717
00:59:32,210 --> 00:59:38,160
You shouldn't have met her to protect me! You should have cursed me and asked me

718
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:42,430
- why I didn't tell youâ€” 
 - I also wanted to do that.

719
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:45,590
I almost hated you for life for not knowing the whole story.

720
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,720
I wanted to curse you and

721
00:59:47,720 --> 00:59:51,730
ask you why you didn't tell me, but...

722
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:56,520
How could I do that?

723
00:59:58,180 --> 01:00:01,850
You are still a friend to me.

724
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,070
Am I not one to you?

725
01:00:10,450 --> 01:00:12,120
Ji So Hyeon.

726
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,920
Don't overreact.

727
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:19,130
Our relationship ended

728
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:25,060
two years ago.

729
01:00:29,060 --> 01:00:31,140
Baek Ho Rang.

730
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:33,920
Please.

731
01:00:33,920 --> 01:00:36,070
Please.

732
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:53,330
This is why I don't like you.

733
01:00:54,330 --> 01:00:58,170
How can I see you hereafter, I am embarrassed.

734
01:01:01,470 --> 01:01:08,060
Let's not get involved with each other hereafter.

 - You must be really scared.

01:02:35,860 --> 01:02:38,700
- Hey, Jung Hee Soo! 
 - Leave the broadcasting club.

740
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,100
What did you say to Baek Ho Rang?

741
01:02:40,100 --> 01:02:41,270
I'm leaving the broadcasting club.

742
01:02:41,270 --> 01:02:43,960
Eun Taek, I'll tell you.

743
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:46,150
What Baek Ho Rang couldn't tell you.

744
01:02:46,150 --> 01:02:47,530
Say something before you leave.

745
01:02:47,530 --> 01:02:49,760
Everything in that post is true.

746
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:51,730
Your expression is an eyesore.

747
01:02:51,730 --> 01:02:55,800
Is that all you can say to someone who has been waiting for you?

748
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:59,660
Today, for the first time, I'm regretting saying that I like you.

Her, her.

752
01:03:08,830 --> 01:03:10,540
The one that has a lot of guys.

753
01:03:10,540 --> 01:03:12,490
Crazy, really.

754
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:15,360
- That's her. 
 - Seriously.

755
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:19,920
Excuse me, do you have any lip tint?

756
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,720
Yeah.

757
01:03:25,410 --> 01:03:28,110
Do you have any other color?

758
01:03:30,680 --> 01:03:32,700
What about this?

759
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:37,010
- You only have male friends, right? 
 - What?

760
01:03:37,010 --> 01:03:42,080
The said that you have no girl friends and all your friends are guys.

761
01:03:43,380 --> 01:03:47,470
Well, it's more comfortable talking to guys.

762
01:03:47,470 --> 01:03:51,940
It's not that I feel uncomfortable talking to guys.

763
01:03:51,940 --> 01:03:54,360
Why are you making up excuses?

764
01:03:54,360 --> 01:04:00,450
It's always like that, people think that those different than them are weird.

765
01:04:00,450 --> 01:04:02,570
- Are you dating them? 
 - No.

766
01:04:02,570 --> 01:04:07,340
Then, there's nothing weird about it.

767
01:04:07,340 --> 01:04:10,890
But this is definitely weird.

768
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:14,040
I wouldn't use this either.

769
01:04:14,040 --> 01:04:16,680
Is it really bad?

770
01:04:25,060 --> 01:04:27,220
Excuse me, then.

771
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,340
Could you go buy one with me later?

772
01:04:35,020 --> 01:04:37,920
Or just tell me which would be good.

773
01:04:37,920 --> 01:04:41,150
I have to go buy a cushion later.

774
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,220
Let's go together then.

775
01:04:45,470 --> 01:04:47,130
Okay.

776
01:04:52,900 --> 01:04:54,420
Are you smart?

777
01:04:54,420 --> 01:04:55,730
A bit.

778
01:04:55,730 --> 01:05:03,290
So annoying.
