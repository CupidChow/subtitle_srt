I ate because I knew you put hard work
into packing that lunch,

I thought you'd be cold...

00:52:23,860 --> 00:52:26,819
I just have to play audio
from the 1st to the 3rd floor, right?

875
00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:28,825
Yes, when I tell you to
over the walkie-talkie.

876
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:30,955
Okay.

877
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,525
How do I turn this on?

878
00:52:35,930 --> 00:52:37,535
Press this,

879
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:39,695
and go like this.

880
00:52:43,510 --> 00:52:45,309
I'll get going now.
I'll send you a signal.

881
00:52:45,310 --> 00:52:46,475
Okay.

882
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:54,749
[ Can you hear me? ]

883
00:52:54,750 --> 00:52:55,985
Yes, I can.

884
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,619
This is so cool.

885
00:52:58,620 --> 00:53:00,759
I guess this is why people use this
instead of their phones.

886
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:01,955
What are you talking about?

887
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,925
It's more convenient when you have
to talk to more than one person.

888
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:07,465
I'm on the third floor now. Turn it on.

889
00:53:07,930 --> 00:53:09,095
Okay.

890
00:53:16,670 --> 00:53:19,639
You're doing well. No mistakes.
Someone taught you well.

891
00:53:19,640 --> 00:53:21,345
No, I'm just a good student.

892
00:53:21,650 --> 00:53:23,075
Eun-taek,

893
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:25,875
how come you're not scolding me today?

894
00:53:25,950 --> 00:53:26,979
About what?

895
00:53:26,980 --> 00:53:29,689
I didn't go with the script
during the show today.

896
00:53:29,690 --> 00:53:32,315
I thought you'd get mad at me,
but you aren't saying anything.

897
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:37,125
Good job.

898
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:39,925
What?

899
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:42,769
I was going to say something
if I didn't have to go out in the middle,

900
00:53:42,770 --> 00:53:45,039
but I later realized that it's nothing
I should fret over.

901
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,295
[ It wasn't so bad. ]

902
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,609
People loved it too.

903
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:49,739
See?

904
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:52,379
Instead of going exactly by the script

905
00:53:52,380 --> 00:53:54,079
like So-hyun and you,

906
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,679
sometimes, it's better to be spontaneous
like me.

907
00:53:56,680 --> 00:53:58,979
That doesn't mean that you should do this
every time.

908
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,419
Next time, tell me in advance. Got it?

909
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,215
Yes, I got it.

910
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,959
I'm done checking the third floor.
You can turn it off now.

911
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:09,055
Okay.

912
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:16,425
[ Ho-rang, ]

913
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,265
you're right.

914
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,205
Sometimes,

915
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:26,575
unexpected things lead to good results.

916
00:54:27,510 --> 00:54:28,745
[ That being said, ]

917
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,945
good job on your very first show.

918
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,615
I forgot to tell you this earlier.

919
00:55:15,660 --> 00:55:16,925
You sent the story

920
00:55:18,600 --> 00:55:19,955
for the lunch broadcast, right?

921
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,325
What?

922
00:55:22,930 --> 00:55:25,435
Well, yes.

923
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:27,369
I didn't know it'd get picked.

924
00:55:27,370 --> 00:55:29,065
I just wrote it in the heat of the moment.

925
00:55:29,070 --> 00:55:30,935
And it got picked for the story.

926
00:55:31,810 --> 00:55:34,145
- So I'm trying to say...
- I'm sorry, Jae-yi.

927
00:55:37,250 --> 00:55:38,945
When I listened to the story,

928
00:55:39,620 --> 00:55:41,745
I realized this must've been hard on you.

929
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:45,585
No. It's not like
I didn't have any part in it.

930
00:55:45,720 --> 00:55:46,815
Jae-yi.

931
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,355
What?

932
00:55:49,260 --> 00:55:52,499
Do you remember the first time we met?
When we were in middle school?

933
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,995
[ Can I sit here? ]

934
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:56,595
[ Of course. ]

935
00:55:56,930 --> 00:55:59,465
[ I talked to you first because
I liked you at the prep school. ]

936
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,269
[ Back then, you had a straight face on, ]

937
00:56:01,270 --> 00:56:03,065
[ so I thought you hated me. ]

938
00:56:03,340 --> 00:56:06,409
[ I told you.
It was because I liked you first. ]

939
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:09,505
[ Hey, that was no way to look at
a girl you had a crush on. ]

940
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,515
[ Actually, I was really happy inside ]

941
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,489
[ because you sat next to me. ]

942
00:56:14,490 --> 00:56:16,345
[ English Study Questions ]

943
00:56:22,290 --> 00:56:25,255
[ Do you want to
have dinner with me later? ]

944
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:30,565
[ And your handwriting on the note
asking me out for dinner was so cute. ]

945
00:56:32,570 --> 00:56:34,169
When we had our first meal in private,

946
00:56:34,170 --> 00:56:37,005
I loved listening to your stories.

947
00:56:37,340 --> 00:56:38,435
Same here.

948
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:41,075
I was grateful that you listened to

949
00:56:41,510 --> 00:56:42,845
all of my stories.

950
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:48,585
I liked you
because you were different from me.

951
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:52,459
It was hard for me to express my feelings.

952
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:55,325
I held them back until I couldn't anymore.
And I barely managed to share it.

953
00:56:56,030 --> 00:56:58,125
But you always told me everything.

954
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:04,065
After fighting with you at the Han River,
I had all sorts of thoughts.

955
00:57:05,300 --> 00:57:07,295
"I should've suggested
to go there another time."

956
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:10,065
"I should've told her I already ate"

957
00:57:10,270 --> 00:57:11,739
"and I didn't feel good."

958
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,205
I should have told you how I really felt.

959
00:57:15,210 --> 00:57:19,075
Then, we wouldn't have fought that day.
I regretted it,

960
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,045
but this wasn't the first time.

961
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:27,385
What are you trying to say?

962
00:57:28,660 --> 00:57:31,055
I liked you because we were so different.

963
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,365
But we went through so much pain
because of our differences.

964
00:57:36,430 --> 00:57:37,969
- I don't want to listen to you.
- Jae-yi.

965
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:39,065
Bye.

966
00:57:48,910 --> 00:57:51,575
To cover it up and turn the other way,

967
00:57:54,250 --> 00:57:56,045
we are way too exhausted.

968
00:57:57,360 --> 00:57:58,785
Hey, Woo-jae.

969
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,285
That brings me to my next point.

970
00:58:04,830 --> 00:58:05,925
We should...

971
00:58:14,970 --> 00:58:16,235
...break up.

972
00:58:21,010 --> 00:58:22,245
That's the right thing to do.

973
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,915
Hey. How is that right?

974
00:58:27,120 --> 00:58:29,885
I was happy because for the first time,
you opened up to me.

975
00:58:30,150 --> 00:58:31,955
But you want to break up with me?

976
00:58:32,090 --> 00:58:34,185
You're so selfish.

977
00:58:35,130 --> 00:58:36,285
You can't say that

978
00:58:37,600 --> 00:58:38,799
all of a sudden.

979
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:40,125
It didn't happen all of a sudden.

980
00:58:40,830 --> 00:58:42,165
Fine. Let's break up.

981
00:58:43,130 --> 00:58:45,265
Like you said, it was a lot for me too.

982
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:48,565
Let's break up.

983
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,185
[ I checked it. You can turn it off. ]

984
00:59:06,620 --> 00:59:07,759
Are we done then?

985
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:09,925
[ Yes. Good job. I'll go up. ]

986
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,055
[ Oh, right. Ho-rang. ]

987
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,399
- What?
- I planned to give this in person

988
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:16,525
but you might not like it,
because you might cringe at it.

989
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:19,735
- What is it?
[ - Do you see my bag on the chair? ]

990
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:21,235
[ Open it. ]

991
00:59:31,180 --> 00:59:33,175
[ To Baek Ho-rang ]

992
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:46,495
[ I heard it's your birthday soon. ]

993
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:50,365
[ - It's for your birthday.
- Happy birthday! ]

994
00:59:54,510 --> 00:59:56,035
[ Ta-da. ]

995
00:59:57,270 --> 00:59:58,375
[ It's so childish. ]

996
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:00,205
[ - Look.
- What is this? ]

997
01:00:01,310 --> 01:00:02,849
[ Happy birthday. ]

998
01:00:02,850 --> 01:00:05,845
[ - Happy birthday.
- Let's do this together. ]

999
01:00:09,790 --> 01:00:11,815
[ That got on my clothes. ]

[ So do you think you can make up
with your ex-boyfriend? ]

1011
01:02:23,530 --> 01:02:24,635
Woo-jae.

1012
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,099
[ - So-hyun.
- I made myself clear. ]

1013
01:02:27,100 --> 01:02:28,169
[ Let's stop. ]

1014
01:02:28,170 --> 01:02:30,309
So-hyun told you to stop calling her.
Don't call her.

1015
01:02:30,310 --> 01:02:33,139
[ You said you don't expect much
from people. Am I one of them? ]

1016
01:02:33,140 --> 01:02:36,109
I think you might be a bit different.

1017
01:02:36,110 --> 01:02:39,375
So this is what I want to tell you.
