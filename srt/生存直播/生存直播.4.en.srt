00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:21,680
Guys, it's the festival season!

9
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:24,150
[15 days until the festival]

10
00:00:24,220 --> 00:00:26,590
[School schedule of 2020]

11
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:27,090
There are 15 days left until the festival.

12
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:29,890
-Stay on your toes.
-Okay.

13
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:31,360
Let me do a brief checkup.

14
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,290
-Check if you're missing anything.
-Okay.

15
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,130
Hui-su. Jin-guk. Get the list of
performing teams from the student council.

16
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,830
-Arrange the teams first.
-Okay.

17
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:40,200
Seong-jun. Eun-ha.
Tell the performing teams

18
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,200
-to bring their music in a flash drive.
-Okay.

19
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,110
Hee-won. Young-jae. I want you
to go to the auditorium to find a spot

20
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:47,840
-to install secondary cameras.
-Okay.

21
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:50,550
So-hyun. Ho-rang. Keep checking
the stories for the segment.

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,550
Pick some good ones and give me an update.

23
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,780
-Okay.
-Yes.

24
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,250
So that's covered.

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,720
Then, is that all for the segment?

26
00:00:57,950 --> 00:00:58,950
The segment?

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,220
From the feedback we got last time,
confrontation will be our theme.

28
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:05,060
Do you have anything to add to that theme?

29
00:01:05,790 --> 00:01:09,730
Since it's a festival, it'd be better
if the students can somehow get involved.

30
00:01:10,730 --> 00:01:13,000
Why don't we give out better prizes?

31
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:16,370
Or how about giving out questionnaires
to every class?

32
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:18,670
We can't give out better prizes
due to our budget.

33
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:21,910
It will be hard to bring out
honest answers with questionnaires.

34
00:01:21,980 --> 00:01:23,480
I see. Is that so?

35
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:26,210
How about a live stream?

36
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,580
-Live stream?
-Yes. We can live stream on YouTube.

37
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:31,690
If we can communicate live
through comments,

38
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:32,920
the viewers might like it.

39
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:36,259
Yes. I love it. It's like
broadcasting your radio show.

40
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,229
-That sounds fun.
-Yes.

41
00:01:38,289 --> 00:01:41,130
Then, do you think
we'll do an awesome job this year?

42
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,560
We'll win first place.

43
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,400
Then, let's go with Ho-rang's suggestion
and do a live stream.

44
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:47,670
-Okay.
-Sounds good.

45
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:50,070
Starting tomorrow,
we'll start preparing for the festival.

46
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,610
-Come here by 8 a.m.
-Okay.

47
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,240
This is it for today's meeting. Well done.

48
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,240
-Good job.
-Good work.

49
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:56,310
-Good work.
-Good job.

Ho-rang.

51
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,060
Yes? What?

52
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:09,990
[Ho-rang.]

53
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,960
Ho-rang.

54
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,060
Are you okay?

55
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,520
I'm okay.

56
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Nothing.

57
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:55,970
I left early that day
because I wasn't feeling well.

58
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:00,240
I'm serious. It was nothing.

59
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,510
Okay, then. Good work today.

60
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,750
-I'll get going.
-Okay.

61
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,120
Eun-taek.

62
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,190
Thank you for your present.
I'll use it well.

63
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,730

[Just now]

65
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:30,610
[I didn't expect this kind of highlight.]

66
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:30,610
My gosh. Whatever.

67
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,980
It's so frustrating.
Why won't you tell me?

68
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,980
Why are you clinging to me these days?

69
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:37,650
You're never clingy.

70
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,079
What is your class doing this year?

71
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:41,650
Our class? A mini arcade.
What about you guys?

72
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,790
I heard that we're making
some kind of snack food.

73
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,720
I see. No.

74
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,160
Stop deflecting my question.
Did something happen?

75
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,590
Hey, what do you think?

76
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,329
Gosh, I can't find anything
when I want to shop.

77
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,300
I wanted to buy everything
when I didn't have money.

78
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,829
You broke up with Woo-jae again, right?

79
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,370
That's it. Right.

80
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,940
That's why your eyes are all sunken.

81
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,740
What are you saying?
I'm completely fine right now.

82
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:07,880
Only people who cry after a breakup
are new to dating.

83
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:09,980

because you got mad.]

-Fine. Yes. You'll regret it, Woo-jae.

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:41,580
[And when you missed him,
I bet you wept and wept.]

97
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:46,110
Whatever. Don't even bring it up.
I'm so annoyed.

98
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,450
I'll never get back with him.

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,820
-How many times was it?
-What?

100
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:54,190
I think I've heard that over ten times
just in the first semester.

101
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:55,860
We're really over this time.

102
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,490
I'll stop repeating my mistakes.
I'll forget him completely.

103
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:02,030
You want to wear that with your uniform?

104
00:05:02,360 --> 00:05:03,870
No. I'll wear it now.

Of course.

Right. She gave up her custody
for her own life, so it would be

Oh, my. How many times is this?

[Baek Ho-rang is so annoying.]

[Store Entrance]

353
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,080
You can take those.

354
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:43,640
[Store Entrance]

355
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:47,850
[So-hyun won't text me back!]

356
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,020
[It's all your fault!]

357
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:53,150
He keeps texting me
because you won't text him back.

358
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:56,260
If he's not your type, make it clear.

359
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,260
I never said that.

360
00:19:58,330 --> 00:20:01,660
Lies. You like guys
with bold facial features.

361
00:20:01,830 --> 00:20:03,960
I do? No, I don't.

362
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:07,330
Nonsense. That's why you had a crush
on Hee-min...

363
00:20:14,270 --> 00:20:16,110
I'll carry these.

364
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,640
You can pay for the rest.

365
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:21,650
Ji So-hyun.

366
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:27,490
That was two years ago.

367
00:20:28,490 --> 00:20:29,890
Don't act like you know me so well

368
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:32,060
just because you knew me briefly
two years ago.

369
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,060
We spent too much time together.

370
00:20:38,230 --> 00:20:39,400
We shouldn't have.

371
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,910
[Store Entrance]

372
00:20:52,810 --> 00:20:55,820
[Is it true that we'll have
guest performances from Yeonri High?]

373
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,990
Hey, the Yeonri kids are dancing
at the festival, right?

374
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Yes.

375
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:04,260
Do Woo-jae,

376
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,560
I know it's none of my business,

377
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,000
but you're making me care, you idiot!

378
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,700
Get to the point. What is it?

379
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:17,970
Did you seriously break up with Jae-yi?

380
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:21,810
If not, then talk it out already.

381
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:23,610
Don't drag the fight out.

382
00:21:23,910 --> 00:21:26,410
Is Jae-yi doing fine?

383
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,780
If you're so curious, ask her yourself.

384
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:32,850
Whatever. You can take care of the rest.

385
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:35,460
I've been single for two years now.

386
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,790
I'm in no position to help others.

387
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:52,240
[You're so selfish.]

388
00:21:52,570 --> 00:21:54,570
[Like you said, it was a lot for me too.]

389
00:21:55,510 --> 00:21:56,580
[Let's break up.]

390
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:12,290
-Why are you back?
-I forgot this here.

391
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:15,160
Are you really okay on your own?

392
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:17,130
It won't take too long. You can just go.

393
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,200
Good work today.

394
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:19,900
-See you tomorrow.
-Yes.

395
00:22:27,310 --> 00:22:28,780
Did you leave something else too?

396
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:35,880
What are you doing at this hour?

397
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,050
My goodness!

398
00:22:39,190 --> 00:22:40,450
What are you doing here?

399
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:42,390
I'm just dropping this off.

400
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,720
The supplies?

401
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,690
Yes. If not, I'd have to carry it
back to school tomorrow.

402
00:22:47,090 --> 00:22:48,300
All right. Good job.

403
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,430
Hold on.

404
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,600
What if the door was locked?

405
00:22:54,430 --> 00:22:55,740
I would've left it at the door.

406
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,270
Hey, you can't do that!
People pass by here all the time.

407
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,370
Who would take these?

408
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,310
I wouldn't take them even if
they are given for free.

409
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:05,680
Whatever. It all worked out
since you're still here anyway.

410
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:08,380
When are you leaving?

411
00:23:08,450 --> 00:23:11,220
One of the video files crashed,
so I just need to work on that.

412
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,290
Right now?

413
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:14,690
It doesn't take long,
maybe about 20 minutes?

414
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:16,560
Where are you going?

415
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:17,620
To the rooftop.

416
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:20,260
Let's go together.

417
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:21,830
It's fine. You can go first.

418
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,930
Why not? Let's go together.
I've always wanted to go to the rooftop.

419
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:28,270
And it'd be nice to learn
how filming works.

420
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,440
You're going to go like that?

421
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:32,370
Why?

422
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:36,480
It's cold at night. Put this on at least.

423
00:23:54,760 --> 00:23:55,760
Here.

424
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,030
Do this, and you're zooming in.

425
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:02,270
The other way, you're zooming out.

426
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:04,000
Try taking a photo.

427
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,580
Here.

428
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:13,010
That's not bad for a first-timer.

429
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:16,320
Of course. You know how many photos
I've uploaded on my feed?

430
00:24:54,790 --> 00:24:56,520
You said you didn't like the song,
but you listen to it quite often.

431
00:24:58,060 --> 00:24:59,060
Often?

432
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,730
This is the first time I've played it
in front of you.

433
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:05,770
Right. First time.

434
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:11,140
By the way, you seem to like the wind.

435
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,070
You also opened the window
after I had closed it.

436
00:25:14,140 --> 00:25:16,540
So you shouldn't have closed it
when I had opened it.

437
00:25:18,850 --> 00:25:20,480
I like it because it's cool.

438
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:25,790
When I feel the breeze,
it helps my frustration

439
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:27,820
go away a bit.

440
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:35,930
[She was the one who ran into me.]

441
00:25:41,740 --> 00:25:43,400
Why won't you speak up for yourself?

442
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:45,170
What?

443
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,140
To those students who badmouth you.

444
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:50,510
"That's not what happened."

445
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:52,150
"You got the wrong idea."

446
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,950
Isn't it easier to just defend yourself,

447
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:56,280
instead of not doing anything?

448
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,150
Easier said than done.

449
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,090
I can speak up for myself
a thousand times.

450
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,560
No one will listen.

451
00:26:03,490 --> 00:26:04,820
And besides,

452
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,260
I don't expect them to anyway.

453
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:19,740
[I don't think I can meet that day.]

454
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,910
[I'm sorry.]

455
00:26:20,970 --> 00:26:23,610
[Can we meet on another day?]

456
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,450
What is it?

457
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,450
You're right.

458
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:36,120
Easier said than done.

459
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:40,090
Do you want me to

460
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,930
lend you my ears?

461
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:43,400
What do you mean?

462
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,030
You can vent if you're angry.

463
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,000
I'll listen.

464
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:50,570
It's just that

465
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:53,370
someone keeps breaking her promises to me.

466
00:26:54,510 --> 00:26:56,110
Right. You must be angry.

467
00:26:56,910 --> 00:26:59,050
I knew that she wouldn't keep
her promise again.

468
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:00,410
And when she broke her promise again,

469
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,820
I got disappointed again,
which is pathetic.

470
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:05,720
I guess you still expect

471
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,820
something from that person,

472
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:10,120
seeing that you're still disappointed.

473
00:27:10,790 --> 00:27:12,530
Well, is that so?

474
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:16,630
But there's no need
to feel pathetic for that.

475
00:27:16,700 --> 00:27:18,630
The one who broke the promise is at fault.

476
00:27:19,130 --> 00:27:21,100
It's not your fault.

477
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:24,940
Other people want to pass the blame
on other people when it's their fault.

478
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:27,510
But why do you carry all that blame
by yourself?

479
00:27:27,570 --> 00:27:28,840
It's exhausting.

480
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
It's because

481
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,050
I'm the captain.

482
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:39,590
Anyway,

483
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,990
keep giving her the benefit of the doubt.

484
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:45,460
Keep doing that
and if you're disappointed,

485
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,490
you can just blame other people too.

486
00:27:47,930 --> 00:27:51,260
People say one doesn't get disappointed
if there's no expectation.

487
00:27:51,770 --> 00:27:54,570
But that's not a great feeling either.

488
00:27:56,070 --> 00:27:57,670
You're talking about yourself, right?

489
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,880
By the way,

490
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,150
am I also one of them?

491
00:28:05,750 --> 00:28:06,750
What do you mean?

492
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,280
That you don't expect anything
from other people.

493
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:11,650
Am I one of them?

494
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:17,260
You?

495
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,530
You're

496
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,130
a bit different.

497
00:28:31,970 --> 00:28:34,640
Can't we come up here often
to film more videos?

498
00:28:34,970 --> 00:28:36,480
I love it here.

499
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,730
Gosh. I'm exhausted.
Should I take a taxi home?

500
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:55,900
What do you say?

501
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,100
-Sure.
-Wait.

502
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,970
-Ho-rang.
-Yes?

503
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,480
You know that day
when I brought you sushi?

504
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,710
I see. Yes.

505
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,880
When I went back to the library,

506
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:15,950
I noticed that I was 15 minutes
behind my schedule.

507
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:20,220
What a surprise. I didn't know
you were capable of being late.

508
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,390
Exactly.

509
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,490
I thought that
it was a coincidence that day.

510
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,630
When I'm with you,
I feel at ease and can be myself.

511
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:31,900
And I thought I felt that way
because you were a decent person.

512
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,570
But I realized that wasn't why today.

513
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,710
I kept thinking the whole time
we were walking here.

514
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,780
And when I thought carefully about this,

515
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,220
I could sort out my thoughts.

516
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:54,450
What are you trying to say?

517
00:29:58,590 --> 00:29:59,690
What I'm saying is...

518
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,930
I'm saying that...

519
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,840
I think I like you, Ho-rang.

520
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:27,220
I like you, Ho-rang.

-I won't bother you. Please?
-No.

00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:38,370
-Look at that.
-My gosh. Seriously?

1057
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,040
What?

1058
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,270
Stop them.

1059
00:59:43,270 --> 00:59:44,540
Young-jae, kill the lights.

1060
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,180
Kill the lights!

1061
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,770
Ho-rang.

1062
01:00:46,340 --> 01:00:47,340
Will you hold my hand?

1063

1066
01:01:55,360 --> 01:01:56,930
[Did you try calling Ho-rang?]

1067
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:58,570
[I did, but she won't answer it.]

1068
01:01:58,630 --> 01:02:00,130
[What if she drops out of school?]

1069
01:02:00,200 --> 01:02:01,170
[You look pretty, Ho-rang.]

1070
01:02:01,230 --> 01:02:02,540
[You're scared right now.]

1071
01:02:02,600 --> 01:02:04,800
You pretended to be some big shot student.

1072
01:02:04,870 --> 01:02:07,070
You're scared they'll find out
you were beaten up like a loser.

1073
01:02:07,140 --> 01:02:09,010
[What are you hiding?]

1074
01:02:09,080 --> 01:02:11,780
[Tell me what happened that day.]

1075
01:02:12,680 --> 01:02:15,480
[Is that why you won't say anything?]

1076
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,120
Eun-taek.

1077
01:02:17,720 --> 01:02:19,090
Do you trust me?
