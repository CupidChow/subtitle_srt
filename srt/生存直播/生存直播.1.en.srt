00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:06,380
A while ago, my friends stopped being my friends and I got dumped by my boyfriend for that reason.
[October 2020]

2
00:00:06,380 --> 00:00:11,360
Now that they cut ties with me, we aren't on the same level, so he wouldn't date me.

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:12,800
But...

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:16,540
The most upsetting thing in this situation is

5
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:20,380
the fact that I still miss him.

6
00:00:20,380 --> 00:00:22,650
If I hold on to him now

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:25,390
am I really crazy?

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,170
- Yeah, you're crazy.
 - This is crazy.
- Why would you want to see him? So frustrating.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:36,410
If you want to live your life meeting his expectations, then hold him back.

10
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:40,970
If not, you should consider yourself lucky that you got rid of a jerk like him.

11
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:46,820
Mr. Ex Boyfriend, you are listening, right?

12
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:48,850
- Don't you understand the guy?
- He's trash.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:52,650
I don't know on which level you are, but

14
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,440
get it together!

15
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,280
- A lot of comments are pouring in.
- Congrats on 200,000 followers.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
- Congrats, Unni.
-  Isn't this an advertisement? 

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,420
It isn't an advertisement.

18
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:06,930
-  Do you have a boyfriend?
- A fling?

19
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,830
Since this isn't my personal broadcast, I'll skip that.

20
00:01:11,830 --> 00:01:14,560
It's time for you to go down, Ho Rang. 

21
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,460
It's time for you to go down, Ho Rang. 

22
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:20,580
She was so fake. 

23
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,060
- Wow, her personality is amazing.
- If it were me, I wouldn't have come out.

24
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:24,340
 She's such an eyesore.

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,890
As expected, you can't trust people's looks.

26
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,740
Wow, her personality is really something.

27
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,350
I will reveal

28
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:32,410
Baek Ho Rang's truth.

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:35,290
I will reveal Baek Ho Rang's truth.

30
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:44,110
 Hold on, is today really the first day of school???
 Seoyeon High School

31
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:45,520
 Welcome to High School

00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,680
- Episode 1 - 
One Month Ago

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:51,330
All students born in 02, join this chat.

34
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,040
What's the concept of your new semester?

35
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,400
 Why are you doing this cringy stuff? Just live the way you are.

36
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,160
I'm going for a clumsy but mysterious concept.

37
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:02,110
I want to be her. Ho Rang.

38
00:02:02,110 --> 00:02:05,490
Ho Rang? Who's that?

39
00:02:05,490 --> 00:02:08,160
She's the one that got popular from that one hashtag.

40
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:12,350
She's at our school.

41
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:18,950
Hello.

42
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,110
They won't allow us to wear non-uniform clothes this year for the festival.

43
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,200
- They are way too strict.
- Exactly.

44
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:27,460
- Why a uniform?
- I am seeing my boyfriend that day.

45
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:29,980
Give me a highlighter.

46
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:32,680
What's this? Did you buy that to copy her?

47
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,280
- What?
- Your cardigan.

48
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:39,650
You're right. I thought I saw it somewhere. It was on Baek Ho Rang's feed.

49
00:02:46,130 --> 00:02:48,770
What are you talking about? I got this as a gift.

50
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,430
Also, watch what you say.

51
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,990
What, who's she following?

52
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:57,220
 Unni you're very pretty.
Where did you buy that?

53
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,660
Can you teach me how you do your makeup? 

54
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,400
I'm not copying her, why would I follow—

55
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:03,980
Baek Ho Rang.

56
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,170
Hurry over.

57
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,930
Sorry.

58
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:18,820
Hold on, you need to wipe this.

59
00:03:18,820 --> 00:03:20,410
Seriously.

Kim Eun Ha / Jung Hee Soo

62
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,030
8:15-8:35 is preparing for questions, and 8:35-40 is the technology check.

63
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:40,560
We'll be crazy busy this week, too.

64
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,320
Right? On the first day of school, too.

65
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,160
We have one minute until 8:35.

66
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,860
What?

67
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:47,500
Already?

68
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,730
What are you doing? Hurry!

69
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:01,560
- Sunbae, hello.
- Hello.

70
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:06,390
Where's Jung Hee Soo?

71
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:13,330
Right. She said she was on her way.

72
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,270
Hey! Where are you?

73
00:04:22,590 --> 00:04:24,350
Check the second-floor monitor.

74
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,120
If it keeps getting disconnected,

75
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:28,370
go inside and check the cables first.

76
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:29,820
Got it.

77
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:33,220
Turn on the TV.

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,810
I didn't do this. Ho Rang, did you do this?

79
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:39,260
What? Not yet.

80
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,940
Hurry up! It's due today.

81
00:04:43,220 --> 00:04:46,170
Assemblyman 

82
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,260
Look! That's her.

83
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,630
Jeez! Really. She must think she's something.

84
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:52,500
Right.

85
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,730
If you keep being like that, people will think you really are like that.

86
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,070
- What?
- You're definitely snobby, but people might think that's all you are.

87
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,860
Kim Yoo Sin, don't let people walk all over you.

88
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,500
No, I don't let people do that to me— Oh! Kang Jae Yi!

89
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,560
- Safe.
- Sorry.

90
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,300
Gosh, I'm tired. Give me a sip.

91
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,600
- No, you'll drink it all.
- Just give me some.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,070
I said no, seriously.

93
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,870
We'll begin the morning broadcast soon.

94
00:05:21,870 --> 00:05:24,830
It's So Hyeon.
All students should be respectfully seated.

95
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:29,310
Repeating, we'll begin the...  
She has a sweet voice. My heart...

96
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,910
 morning broadcast soon. All students should be respectfully seated.

97
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,360
- You drank it all?
-Yeah, can't I?

98
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,060
I bought it for So Hyeon!

99
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,590
- How would I know that?
- Why did you drink it? Go buy another one!

100
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,800
You buy it!

101
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,530
- Go buy it!
- I can't hear you!

102
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,500
I request that everyone take their seats in their respective classes.

103
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,200
- I need someone to help tidy up the wires.
- I'll do it.

104
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,030
Thank you.

105
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,980
You're late.

106
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:12,600
- The thing is—
- By thirteen minutes and fifty-seven seconds.

107
00:06:15,790 --> 00:06:19,300
I told you it's a broadcasting accident if you're even three seconds late.

108
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,400
Sorry.

109
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,700
- Yes, sir.
- You are all doing a good job.

110
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:28,830
- Hello. 
- Are you all doing well?

111
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,850
It's this way.

112
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:34,480
Get everything ready quickly.

113
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:43,350
Seoyeon High School

114
00:06:45,890 --> 00:06:48,080
We're starting in three seconds.

115
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,640
 On Air 

116
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:59,420
Hello, Seoyeon High School students. Did you spend your vacation well?

117
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:02,360
Now that we are back in school after a long time,

118
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:07,060
I'll make my speech short so you can start your classes.

119
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,830
As all of you already know, next month

120
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:15,460
there is a festival at our school.

121
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,280
- They said the Changjo band will be there.
- Really?

122
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,280
- Yeonri High School band will be there too.
- Are they pretty?

123
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:25,220
Let's try to do well on our mock exams and also in the college test.

124
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:29,360
Have fun only during the festival.

125
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,880
Is he telling us to study or to have fun?

126
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,730
He means we should have fun while not having fun.

127
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,670
Hey, we won't get caught for makeup during the festival, right?

128
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:39,260
- Right. Because we aren't even going to wear our uniforms.
- I heard that we should wear our uniforms.

129
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:40,810
What? Who said that?

130
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,290
Those girls earlier.

131
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,790
Your boyfriend is in the student council, but why are you the only one that doesn't know?

132
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,400
Do Woo Jae!

133
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:53,180
 Don't keep talking because I'm not there. I can hear everything in the broadcasting room. 

134
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:55,430
I'm pretty much right there with you.

135
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,760
 -What the heck? LOL
- It really is a big nose.

136
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,220
 Did you confirm the deposit? 

137
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:10,690
Yes, I did.

138
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,280
Let's start the meeting.

139
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,240
First off,

140
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,860
since it's our first day, I'll be reading only the announcements.

141
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:37,080
- I'll talk fast, so I'll take questions after.
- Okay.

142
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:40,430
We have the mock exam by the end of September, so we'll be checking the sound right away.

143
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:44,890
- Let's split up into groups and each group will check the sound twice.
-  Okay.

144
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:46,700
Next month's festival.

145
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:51,220
Before the festival, we have to frequently check the speaker in the auditorium. The freshmen can practice with the equipment.

146
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,350
Got it.

147
00:08:53,350 --> 00:08:56,960
Jung Hee Soo will stay and clean the storage room.

148
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,990
S-sure.

149
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:02,530
What about an announcer?

150
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:06,490
We should select an announcer. The previous one left quite a while ago.

151
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:13,660
We can't stop here, we must run.

152
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:17,790
Prepare to end.
Until we reach our final destination of success.

153
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,130
We'll end with one last song. 

154
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:24,630
This was Ji So Hyeon of SHBS till now. Thank you. Ah, one minute, please.

155
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:27,660
There is a story I haven't read.

156
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:32,390
Hello. I want to confess my feelings to my crush with this message.

157
00:09:32,390 --> 00:09:35,820
I've been wondering whether to say it or not.

158
00:09:37,140 --> 00:09:39,350
I'll say it now.

159
00:09:39,350 --> 00:09:42,690
Go Eun Taek, I came here because of you.

160
00:09:42,690 --> 00:09:47,880
Can you give an answer to my confession once I come out?

161
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:54,360
This was So Hyeon of SHBS till now. Thank you.

162
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,490
So your dream of being an announcer was a lie?

163
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:14,790
Yeah, honestly, since I first saw you—

164
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,400
Can you leave?

165
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,510
- I have to get out too—
- The broadcasting club.

166
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:22,430
Leave.

167
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:35,200
On Air

168
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,250
It's been about three months since you fired her.

169
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,180
I didn't fire her. She left on her own.

170
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:44,270
Anyway, we need to hurry and pick another announcer.

171
00:10:44,270 --> 00:10:46,520
It was difficult for us during the break because we had to carry the burden of having one less person.

172
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,680
You're right.

173
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:49,830
Okay, let's pick one.

174
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:52,880
Sung Joon and Eun Ha. You both are in charge of the bulletin boards and recruiting.

175
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,590
What about instead of the notice board, we scout out someone this time?

176
00:10:56,590 --> 00:10:58,980
- Who?
- Ho Rang Sunbae.

177
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:01,020
- Are you talking about Baek Ho Rang?
- Yes.

178
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,260
I heard that they're holding a popularity contest for booths during this year's festival.

179
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:06,070
I think they'll probably give us better placement with Ho Rang Sunbae in the picture as well.

180
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:07,570
That would be great.

181
00:11:07,570 --> 00:11:10,010
Right? It would suit our overall image.

182
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:12,420
It would be good if she joined,

183
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,910
but wouldn't there be some negatives?

184
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:16,290
- Ah, of course, there are.
- Why?

185
00:11:16,290 --> 00:11:20,830
Well, there are those rumors that are floating around.

186
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:24,160
I heard those too. I heard she's a "my way, or the highway" type.

187
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:27,560
Isn't that a good thing? I think she's pretty cool for speaking her mind.

188
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:31,920
No, that's not it. I don't know if she's self-aware or not, but she definitely doesn't think before she speaks.

189
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,610
Did you see it yourself, or did you hear about it?

190
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:38,540
Well, I heard it here and there.

191
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:42,530
It's not confirmed, I just heard about it.

192
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:46,320
Okay then, I'll talk to her about it.

193
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:51,160
 Scout Baek Ho Rang

194
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,480
What class is she in?

195
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,440
- I don't want it.
- Why?

196
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,750
I don't want to do it. What do you mean why?

197
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:01,250
You don't have to dance on stage at the festival, you can just stand there.

198
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,190
I'll speak to them.

199
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,070
What is it?

200
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,020
Seoyeon High School Dance Team Application

201
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,300
Guys, don't worry about it.

202
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,700
We'll become closer and do a bunch of fun activities together.

203
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,320
It would help you out a lot.

204
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,980
- Think about it once, and let me know—
- Hey kids, if it's about Ho Rang, you can talk to me about it.

205
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,890
We don't even need to stand there.

206
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:18,380
We can just sit around and read books during the festival.

207
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:21,180
Of course, we don't even have to sit. We can just lay down.

208
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:23,880
I don't want to. I'm not doing it.

209
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,300
What?

210
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:28,820
Why are you pretending to think about me, when all you're doing is helping yourselves?

211
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:32,590
Could you please go, if you're done talking?

212
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:42,570
It's fine. I told you she only listens to me.

213
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,340
I'll talk to her, okay.

214
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,860
Ho Rang, wait up.

215
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:52,170
A snake's tongue. The snake's tongue that appears in this question,

216
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:53,830
is someone who backstabs another.

217
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:57,730
If things don't work out their way while pretending to be nice to that person. Right?

218
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:00,000
That's what it's talking about, right Young Gi.

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,780
Right?
sponsor: trendyroomm

220
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:03,240
Talking about humans like you.

221
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,390
- What does sweet-talking mean?
- I have no idea.

222
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,740
Right?

223
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:08,360
- Teacher?
- What?

224
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,720
May I go to the nurse's office?

225
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,590
The nurse's office? Why?

226
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,220
My stomach hurts.

227
00:13:14,220 --> 00:13:15,610
Sure, go.

228
00:13:15,610 --> 00:13:17,770
Ho Rang, wake up Yoo Sin before you go.

229
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:22,150
Kim Yoo Sin! That guy really sleeps every day.

230
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:27,540
Yes.

231
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:32,160
You can send it to that address.

232
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:49,560
 What? I thought you went to the nurse's office.

233
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:50,830
Are you sick?

234
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,790
No, I'm just tired

235
00:14:03,490 --> 00:14:05,490
Then, the 'X' here.

236
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:08,030
You subtract one from this equation.

237
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,680
What will be the answer if you square negative two plus three?

238
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,510
Seven.

239
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,870
Right, do you understand?

240
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:14,730
Yes.

241
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:16,030
That's it for today.

242
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,330
If you have a question, let me know.

243
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:19,220
Okay.

244
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:21,100
Hey.

245
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,990
Your life is exact down to the second, huh? Aren't you tired of it?

246
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:27,000
It's nice. Everything is clear.

247
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,770
What did you decide on doing for the festival?

248
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:38,970
Something similar to last year. We'll be doing this and that.

249
00:14:38,970 --> 00:14:44,580
Ah, and Go Eun Taek, do you have any interest in meeting girls? Of course, you don't.

250
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,730
- Yeah, I don't.
- Yeah.

251
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:48,140
I just thought that maybe you would.

252
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:50,700
Why are you asking me that out of the blue? Do you know any girls?

253
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:53,000
No, Jae Yi told me to ask you.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,470
- That's right, you have a thing going on with Kang Jae Yi.
- Hey!

255
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:56,990
Do Woo Jae!

256
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,220
She's here again.

257
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,720
Is this the second time?

258
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,990
No, it's the third.

259
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,580
Breaking up and getting back together three times. You two are really something.

260
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,200
She's cute.

261
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,720
- Give it
- What?

262
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,190
My pouch.

263
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,580
I worked really hard to buy that.

264
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:24,850
What can I do with such a goody-two-shoes boyfriend? Let me use you this one time, please?

265
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,160
Give me my pouch.

266
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,850
I just bought it!

267
00:15:32,850 --> 00:15:34,660
Kang Jae Yi.

268
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:38,810
Jae Yi, this whole school is going to crumble because of you.

269
00:15:38,810 --> 00:15:40,090
Calm down.

270
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:42,740
Ah, Teacher.

271
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,390
What?

272
00:15:47,390 --> 00:15:49,220
Hold on.

273
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,130
Here.

274
00:15:54,130 --> 00:15:56,440
What is this? Why did you put on an act if you were going to give it to me anyway?

275
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,690
Let's try calming down for real Jae Yi.

276
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,650
I'm heading to the cafeteria, are you going too?

277
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,260
Yeah.

278
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,780
Do you usually confiscate things, too?

279
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:18,270
No, just penalty points.

280
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:19,750
You said she was in class one?

281
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:22,160
- Who?
- Baek Ho Rang.

282
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:25,840
Are you going there now?

283
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:28,460
Yeah, I'm going.

284
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,330
 Did class go well?

285
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,080
 I don't want to wake up.

286
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,020
Ji Soo, what are you doing after this?

287
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,890
Our school starts at 8:30.

288
00:16:40,890 --> 00:16:42,740
Park Sang Min
Our school starts at 8:30.

289
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,880
Excuse me.

290
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,750
Is Baek Ho Rang here?

291
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:00,560
She isn't.

292
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:03,460
I see, thanks.

293
00:17:04,530 --> 00:17:07,200
- Hey, why did you use this lipstick?
- I don't know.

294
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,380
What was her name?

295
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,650
- What was the name of that girl with 270,000 followers? Baek–
- Baek Ho Rang?

296
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,880
Right, that's it.

297
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,570
I don't know. She said that she won't be participating in the festival.

298
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,920
- Ah, really?
- Yeah, really. I went to her just a while ago.

299
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:19,200
She crinkled up her face so much, I almost hit her.

300
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,690
She thinks she amounts to something.

301
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,780
But, isn't she something?

302
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,960
Someone needs to beat some sense into her.

303
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,420
You'd think she's a celebrity or something.

304
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:29,670
I went to her class earlier and sat at her seat.

305
00:17:29,670 --> 00:17:31,770
She told me to clean it and leave.

306
00:17:31,770 --> 00:17:33,700
Seriously? Is she crazy?

307
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,120
She's really too much.

308
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,100
Let's go.

309
00:17:40,190 --> 00:17:40,920
❤ trendyroomm

310
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:45,220
 It's a relief that you said you'd do it again. We're in your hands.

311
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:48,290
Again?

312
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:50,920
Yes, yes. When I contacted you through Face previously.

313
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:53,100
I'm saying this because I don't have a Face account.

314
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,540
Who did you contact on there?

315
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:56,360
 Isn't this your page?

316
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:58,970
Recently there have been a lot of fake accounts.

317
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,390
I like this kind of vibe.

318
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:08,770
Took a pic like my left one. Then tied my hair and took another one right away.

319
00:18:08,770 --> 00:18:10,940
Send a Message

320
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,230
 Hello.

321
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:16,620
Hello.

322
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:28,070
A heart-fluttering story, this is the third story of the first second-semester lunch broadcast.

323
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,270
The girl I have a crush on recently told me her ideal type

324
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:32,900
I think I'll get a boyfriend.

325
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:35,260
Who? Is it someone from our school or from Yeonri?

326
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:39,060
It's someone from a rural area. We're talking on Face, and if he's alright I'll start dating him.

327
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:41,620
Where does he live? Let me see his picture.

328
00:18:42,530 --> 00:18:45,560
Ah, he's cute. Hey, how did you meet him? Through an app?

329
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,570
No, through Face.

330
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:49,160
That's crazy. He looks like that one guy.

331
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,820
That one model.

332
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:53,390
- Who is it?
- Hold on a second.

333
00:18:53,390 --> 00:18:57,320
I told him that and he told me he wanted to call me, all of a sudden.

334
00:18:58,330 --> 00:18:59,590
What?

335
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,060
 I don't have a Face. Who is this? 

336
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,380
It's Seoyeon High's Park Hye Rim.

337
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:05,340
Her identity's been revealed, and she even has a Face username.

338
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,630
Let me see, did you find it?

339
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,160
 Wake up, you're a fake account. 

340
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,120
 That's so low. Why do you live like that? 

341
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,690
 I looked at Baek Ho Rang's feed and headed over here. 

342
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,030
Baek Ho Rang, is it fun?

343
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:38,820
Is it fun to publicly expose someone like this?

344
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,830
I never exposed you for this.

345
00:19:41,830 --> 00:19:46,230
Also, you're the one that used my name for some fun.

346
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:51,600
You don't have to delete your account or anything, even if you've been exposed. Just leave it.

347
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,990
I'll visit it from time to time.

348
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,930
Everyone hates you.

349
00:20:03,930 --> 00:20:09,970
Don't you know? You might think that everyone's interested in you just because you wear expensive clothes and pretend that you have it all.

350
00:20:09,970 --> 00:20:13,140
- When you weren't here, they were—
- Hey.

351
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,420
Could you do me a favor and move?

352
00:20:18,530 --> 00:20:22,620
I don't like sharing the same list with a fake like you.

353
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:46,810
So, you're saying you definitely changed the chord.

354
00:20:46,810 --> 00:20:48,180
Yes.

355
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:51,720
I'll ask you again. Did you change it or not?

356
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,280
I didn't.

357
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,000
I'm so sorry.

358
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,930
Why are you crying? This isn't the time for you to be crying.

359
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,870
How about we continue in ten minutes?

360
00:21:09,130 --> 00:21:11,160
Should we go out?

361
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:13,590
Let's go.

362
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,490
Cleaning: Kim Hee Won
Set up chairs in auditorium at 6 pm.

363
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:21,090
Setting up the auditorium? What is that?

364
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:23,870
Ah, that is... We were talking about it before you got here.

365
00:21:23,870 --> 00:21:27,290
They told us to set up the chairs before the festival.

366
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,540
Who said so?

367
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:33,280
- Earlier, the student council president did.
- They always pass their responsibilities to us.

368
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,520
Don't do it, that's their job.

369
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,660
We've verified and checked the sound system, right?

370
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:39,430
Yes.

371
00:21:39,430 --> 00:21:41,780
Alright, good work. Finish up here and go.

372
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:44,350
Bye.

373
00:21:45,630 --> 00:21:49,250
 Scout Baek Ho Rang 

374
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,240
Park Hye Rim was running a fake account.

375
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,730
Doesn't it make you cringe?

376
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,890
But, are you sure it was a fake account?

377
00:21:57,890 --> 00:22:00,190
Baek Ho Rang could've just made it up.

378
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,160
Well, I'm not sure. Seeing how she usually acts, it wouldn't be completely out of the question.

379
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:05,090
That's right. She usually says whatever she wants and looks down on everyone.

380
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:07,350
- You agree, right? C'mon.
- Yeah, I totally agree.

381
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:09,690
- I told her to do it.
- Yeah.

382
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,880
But I don't know, she kept saying no.

383
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:15,020
What is it?

384
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,290
Where are you?

385
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:19,210
I'm already outside. I have to go buy a phone.

386
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:20,690
Hey, I waited for you!

387
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:23,020
- Why a phone? Because of what happened in the cafeteria earlier?
- Yeah.

388
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:27,180
I broke it then. I'm getting frustrated, so stop asking me and hang up.

389
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:42,800
Are you Baek Ho Rang?

390
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:48,630
I went to your class, but you weren't there.

391
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,900
Ah, I'm the head of the broadcasting club, Go Eun Taek.

392
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,060
Can I talk to you for a second?

393
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,560
I heard that you rejected offers from other clubs.

394
00:23:02,560 --> 00:23:05,320
But we do give more community service hours than they would.

395
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,920
It'll help in real life, too.

396
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:11,130
We're looking for someone that'll be an anchor for our booth.

397
00:23:11,130 --> 00:23:13,070
- If you're alright with it, could you—
- Ah.

398
00:23:13,070 --> 00:23:16,220
From day one, everything's so annoying.

399
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:22,370
Are you going to do it?

400
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:28,930
- I won't.
- You could just say that.

401
00:23:28,930 --> 00:23:31,950
You kept listening to me, even though it was annoying you.

402
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:35,630
If I said I didn't want to, would you have left right away?

403
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:39,690
Then I won't do it, I'm not going

404
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,660
to such a lowly place.

405
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:45,030
You're exactly as I've heard.

406
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:49,020
Are you acting like that on purpose for fame?

407
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:53,400
Or are you famous because of that mess of an act?

408
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,600
Whatever the case is, read the situation at hand.

409
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:57,950
Even if you act this rudely,

410
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:01,390
there won't be anyone that will take interest in you.

411
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,330
Hey.

412
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:13,360
Go Eun Taek, what are you complaining about?

413
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:17,270
Do you have a problem with my attitude?

414
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,610
Or are you upset because of how embarrassed you are at your rejection?

415
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:25,740
Didn't you come looking for me because you need me?

416
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:32,190
Holding on to someone that was minding their own business, then crossing the line and getting angry over rejection.

417
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:39,630
Don't you think that's really rude of you?

418
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:45,860
Stop pissing me off and stay in your lane.

419
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:50,370
I'm already frustrated because of the nobodies that were following me around today.

420
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,390
Do everything here.

421
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:18,540
Yes.

422
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:21,480
Also, if you look over there, there's a mic that we borrowed from earlier.

423
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:23,520
Could you take that with you, too? I'll leave that to you.

424
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,590
Where?

425
00:25:25,590 --> 00:25:27,090
If you look over there.

426
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,540
Why are you telling her to do that?

427
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,040
You put it away.

428
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:34,400
Go Eun Taek. It's been a while. How was your break?

429
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,960
And isn't putting away the chairs your job?

430
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,110
It's not our job exactly, it's technically the school's responsibility.

431
00:25:41,110 --> 00:25:43,230
That's something we all should work on together.

432
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,890
Then we should share the workload, instead of passing it over to us.

433
00:25:47,800 --> 00:25:49,480
Cut me some slack.

434
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:51,260
Today we—

435
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:54,210
Look at that, I got a call.

436
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,820
The vice-principal said he'll be letting us eat out.

437
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,000
Just this once, only for today. Please?

438
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,080
Work hard.

439
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,600
You.

440
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:10,090
Yes.

441
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:13,130
If something like this happens in the future, make sure to let Ji So Hyeon or I know.

442
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:18,480
Him looking down on you is the same thing as him looking down on our entire club.

443
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,360
Yes.

444
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,500
You guys, too.

445
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,760
Got it.

446
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:28,770
What time are you coming in?

447
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,740
How many chairs are left?

448
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,770
About fifty.

449
00:26:33,770 --> 00:26:36,880
I'll finish up here, you guys can go.

450
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:40,620
It's late.

451
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,840
Thank you.

452
00:26:49,890 --> 00:26:51,790
 Late.

453
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:33,430
Mom
 That's right. School must've started today.

454
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:36,690
Make sure to eat well.

455
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:39,290
She's being too much.

456
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:44,540
New upload

457
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:16,540
 Seoyeon High School Broadcasting Club

458
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:13,090
I told you to close it multiple times, but you couldn't hear me.

459
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,140
Yes, so the music video I prepared for today is this.

460
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:07,710
The reason why is because I think my future life is similar to the season of spring.

461
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:10,850
Jae Yi, it isn't spring.

462
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:11,930
It's winter.

463
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:15,350
Since when? But this is right.

464
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,490
Hey, did you all know this?

465
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:19,910
You didn't know either.

466
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,470
 I'll show you soon! You just wait. 

467
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,680
dys_u111

468
00:31:34,180 --> 00:31:37,610
 I'm going to an interview for the broadcasting club, so I can see So Hyeon. 

469
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:40,800
 I'm shy. What should I say when I go? 

470
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:47,650
Listen up. Starting next week, you all will be studying independently in your classroom.

471
00:31:47,650 --> 00:31:48,880
See you next week.

472
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:50,300
Goodbye.

473
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,540
Let's go see a movie.

474
00:31:53,290 --> 00:31:54,620
Lunch Menu

475
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:57,080
Is there no hope today?

476
00:31:57,080 --> 00:31:59,190
Baek Ho Rang, do you want to go to the cafeteria?

477
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:00,680
No, it's bothersome.

478
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:04,920
No, you should come with me because you are the one that's going to buy me food.

479
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:07,700
In return, I have unlimited data, so I'll turn on my mobile hotspot for you.

480
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,240
I have unlimited data too.

481
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:12,490
Really? Buy it for me. You earn good money!

482
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:14,410
Your family is rich.

483
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:18,220
My parents are rich, but I'm poor.

484
00:32:18,220 --> 00:32:21,970
Come with me. I have to buy So Hyeon a drink.

485
00:32:21,970 --> 00:32:24,790
If that's what you're buying, go by yourself.

486
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,920
Let's go together, Ho Rang. I'll hold your books for you!

487
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:32,740
SHBS's broadcast will be starting now.

488
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:34,790
It's So Hyeon.

489
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:39,180
There are a lot of people. You can go and buy it.

490
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:43,020
What the heck?

491
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,820
Please, I want Chocky-mong.

492
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:54,760
Sunbae. Sunbae!

493
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:56,850
Have this, please.

494
00:32:56,850 --> 00:32:57,660
Thanks.

495
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,080
I want to hear this story.

496
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,250
Have a good day.

497
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,450
This is the last story.

498
00:33:02,450 --> 00:33:05,720
 My dear friend, it's almost your birthday. 

499
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:09,220
 The birthday party we had in the third year of middle school was really fun. 

500
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,520
 Do you remember? Angel Karaoke. 

501
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:18,820
 We also put cake on each other's faces and wore elephant hats and all. 

502
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:25,750
 I really liked the time we had back then.

503
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:28,750
 It's been two years already.

504
00:33:28,750 --> 00:33:31,530
We've really changed a lot during this time, haven't we?

505
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:37,520
 Because I was reminded of our old days, I prepared a birthday gift. 

506
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:41,320
 Look forward to it, my friend. I love you. 

507
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:44,570
You both must have been really good friends.

508
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,350
- Hurry.
- This is fun!

509
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,920
 Baek Ho Rang

510
00:34:06,920 --> 00:34:09,180
Oh gosh! This is crazy.

511
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:26,360
You were a member of the broadcasting club in middle school?

512
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,230
Oh, yes.

513
00:34:27,230 --> 00:34:29,590
- Do you know how to handle cameras?
- Yes, of course.

514
00:34:29,590 --> 00:34:33,230
- And you should have a fair knowledge of media terminology.
- Absolutely.

515
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,450
You see, when I was in middle school—

516
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,660
I have wasted, to be exact, thirteen minutes on the lies you have been telling us.

517
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:45,020
I'm not lying, but–

518
00:34:45,020 --> 00:34:47,920
You don't need light on a broadcasting club.

519
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:53,230
Thanks for coming. You may leave.

520
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,860
Be more gentle.

521
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,510
That's it for today, right?

522
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:05,500
The guy that just left is the last one.

523
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:12,630
 Broadcasting Club SHBS Application
Name: Baek Ho Rang

524
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:18,630
I can sit down, right? I've come for an interview.

525
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:27,500
No, you can't.

526
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,760
- Why not?
- It just ended.

527
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,170
What are you saying?

528
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,550
That guy literally just left. I saw him.

529
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:35,570
Right. I think it hasn't finished yet.

530
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:39,130
Yes Sunbae, we have to let them take the interview if they applied for it.

531
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:45,220
Sit down.

532
00:35:52,030 --> 00:35:54,290
The Director of Patent Permission Division and

533
00:35:54,290 --> 00:35:55,930
the Director of Gagwan Tourism met on the seventh day

534
00:35:55,930 --> 00:36:00,550
of the seventh month in their seventies.

535
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,830
I want to know your motivation for applying to the broadcasting club.

536
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:08,300
I changed my mind.

537
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,820
I decided to have a career in this field.

538
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,170
To be honest, it's because I think it would look good on my school record.

539
00:36:15,170 --> 00:36:18,240
So, you didn't come with other intentions?

540
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,590
Must I have other intentions?

541
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:28,790
Alright, we'll end the interview here. Is there anything you want to add?

542
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:29,770
No, I don't.

543
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:31,690
Alright, then.

544
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:35,320
Oh, but...

545
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:39,020
That story during the lunch broadcast...

546
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,990
Who wrote it?

547
00:36:40,990 --> 00:36:44,610
It was sent in anonymously, so I can't tell you that.

548
00:36:44,610 --> 00:36:46,420
Is that so? Okay then.

549
00:36:46,420 --> 00:36:48,390
Why are you asking?

550
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:53,810
Just... I thought it was interesting.

551
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,850
[Staff Only] 

552
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,700
- What?
- What the heck, Baek Ho Rang!

553
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:20,830
Why did you suddenly take off like that?

554
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:23,760
I'm going to the classroom now. I'm hanging up.

555
00:37:39,150 --> 00:37:41,290
Didn't she say she wouldn't apply?

556
00:37:41,290 --> 00:37:43,220
Exactly.

557
00:37:43,220 --> 00:37:45,250
What do you think?

558
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,750
Yeah, well...

559
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,930
I'm okay with it if you are.

560
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:53,770
You did a good job with the interviews, So Hyeon.

561
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,520
You, too.

562
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:04,670
 I suddenly remembered that even on his birthday, 

563
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:06,060
 you can anticipate it friend. 

564
00:38:06,060 --> 00:38:07,670
 I used it as a replica. 

565
00:38:08,660 --> 00:38:11,620
Just wait for me to become an assemblyman.

566
00:38:11,620 --> 00:38:14,510
I'm going to drop by somewhere today. You can go home first.

567
00:38:14,510 --> 00:38:16,320
Why? Where are you going?

568
00:38:16,320 --> 00:38:17,470
Rodeo.

569
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:19,370
I was also going to go there.

570
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,650
Let's go together.

571
00:38:23,120 --> 00:38:24,580
- This is a new item, right?
- Yes.

572
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:27,290
You can wear it inside out, too.

573
00:38:27,290 --> 00:38:31,390
- I'll take this then.
- Okay. Please wait.

574
00:38:31,390 --> 00:38:33,940
Baek Ho Rang, I'm your friend, right?

575
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:36,160
If you become successful one day, you can't forget me.

576
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:38,200
Why are you suddenly talking like that?

577
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,640
Ho Rang, what are you going to do after graduating?

578
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,780
How about creating a brand and being a young CEO?

579
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,740
- Is that what you're going to do?
- Ummm...

580
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,790
I haven't thought about that yet.

581
00:38:46,790 --> 00:38:50,330
Would you hire me as an employee?

582
00:38:50,330 --> 00:38:52,210
Wasn't your dream to be an assemblyman?

583
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:54,750
That was the case up till a few days ago, but not anymore.

584
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:58,670
Usually, I change my dreams every day, but today—

585
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,980
I got a call again, wait a minute.

586
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:05,190
Hello?

587
00:39:05,190 --> 00:39:06,750
Mr. Kwon?

588
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,990
Why do you keep calling me?

589
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:13,080
Did my mom already get off work?

590
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:19,540
 Your dad and I will be home late today. Order some food. 

591
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,630
 010-384-0110 

592
00:39:23,630 --> 00:39:27,090
 It's Go Eun Taek. Contact me when you see this. 

593
00:39:28,820 --> 00:39:32,100
- I'll ring up the transaction for you now. 
- Yes.

594
00:39:34,530 --> 00:39:36,310
 Am I an autumn tone or a spring tone? 

595
00:39:36,310 --> 00:39:38,820
 Autumn. I have the same tone. Share some makeup tips with me. 

596
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:41,000
- Check your Face messages.
- What lenses do you use?

597
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:43,230
I'm going to go and buy another tint later.

598
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,840
Seeing that I keep failing, I think I don't know my tone yet.

599
00:39:46,840 --> 00:39:48,010
Alright.

600
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,290
Oh, right. Remember the girl I told you about last time?

601
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,190
- She finally confessed to her assistant teacher.
- Oh, that's good.

602
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:55,920
Well, though it's true their age difference isn't that big.

603
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,760
Everyone was watching. How could she think about confessing?

604
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,300
And it's even...

605
00:40:01,300 --> 00:40:03,610
Hey, Do Woo Jae, are you listening?

606
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:05,500
Who did you say confessed to whom?

607
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,040
Our Woo Sol is here.

608
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,360
Unni, let me have a sip too.

609
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:10,750
Try it.

610
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:11,830
How did you know we were here?

611
00:40:11,830 --> 00:40:15,590
You were also here? Mom wants you to go to the academy and call her.

612
00:40:15,590 --> 00:40:18,330
Jae Yi. This cafe is really pretty, right?

613
00:40:18,330 --> 00:40:21,570
- Let's take a selfie.
- Okay, let's use your phone.

614
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:25,060
Wow.

615
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:27,060
One more.

616
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:32,520
One, two, three.

617
00:40:34,520 --> 00:40:36,230
Wow, I think they turned out really well.

618
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,300
But, where does she get all these products from?

619
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,690
Who? Oh, Baek Ho Rang?

620
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,100
I'm so envious.

621
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,460
Last time she was wearing designer clothes as well.

622
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:49,770
Unni, didn't you say you were in the same class as her?

623
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:51,680
That's right. But we're not close.

624
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:54,100
People say she has a very nasty personality.

625
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:56,420
That's true. People also wrote that on the school confessions.

626
00:40:56,420 --> 00:40:58,230
I know. They talk too much there.

627
00:40:58,230 --> 00:41:00,970
I could only hear your voice in your class, Jae Yi.

628
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,850
What? Why are you being like this to me?

629
00:41:02,850 --> 00:41:06,360
What? Why are you like this?

630
00:41:06,360 --> 00:41:09,770
Woo Sol, you must suffer so much having to live with him.

631
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:12,820
No, Unni. I'm the one who needs to thank you.

632
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:14,720
We still have a little more time. Should we shop for lipstick?

633
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,320
Sure. I also need to fix my makeup.

634
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:19,350
I really hope I find the perfect lipstick this time.

635
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:21,130
- Yeah, let's go.
- Let's go.

636
00:41:22,070 --> 00:41:24,060
- What? Are you coming too?
- Yes.

637
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,210
Oppa, do you even know what tint colors are there?

638
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:27,500
Well... Red?

639
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,100
Red?

640
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,550
Unni, he said red-toned is "red".

641
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:33,190
How old-fashioned.

642
00:41:33,190 --> 00:41:34,790
- Sol, let's go ourselves.
- Sure.

643
00:41:34,790 --> 00:41:37,430
Let's go.

644
00:41:37,430 --> 00:41:38,820
Wait for me!

645
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:42,180
Girls, wait! Let's go together!

646
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:44,070
9:00 pm -10:00 pm: Memorize English Vocabulary
10:00 pm - 12:00 am: Edit Videos

647
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:02,130
 Video editing

648
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,370
 Scout Baek Ho Rang 

649
00:42:10,730 --> 00:42:13,490
 Go Eun Taek here. Reply to me after reading this.

650
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:18,830
 Wannabe Announcer Baek Ho Rang 

651
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:23,790
Don't you think it's very rude to call at this hour—

652
00:42:23,790 --> 00:42:26,690
So? Have I passed?

653
00:42:26,690 --> 00:42:29,720
Yes. Come to the broadcasting room by 12:30 pm tomorrow.

654
00:42:29,720 --> 00:42:31,860
Okay. You don't have anything else to say, right?

655
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:34,760
I'm going to check the time so don't be lat—

656
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,700
What the heck? Hello?

657
00:42:44,990 --> 00:42:47,250
 Scout Baek Ho Rang

658
00:42:47,250 --> 00:42:51,160
People's relationships can be defined in 

659
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:53,540
a movie by...

660
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:58,940
the color they use to fill the atmosphere and day.

661
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:00,650
Why don't you try contacting Ho Rang Sunbae ?

662
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,400
How would I have her number?

663
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,010
Try messaging her on something.

664
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:07,040
We'll end today's airing here.

665
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:11,040
This was Ji So Hyeon from HSBS.

666
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,790
Hello.

667
00:43:11,790 --> 00:43:15,090
The last song is Paul Kim's "Hey".

668
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:26,980
What time is it right now?

669
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:29,190
1:10 pm? Oh.

670
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,390
That clock is 5 minutes early? 1:05 pm, then.

671
00:43:32,390 --> 00:43:36,600
I'm not actually asking you for the time. Didn't you hear me say you had to be here by 12:30 pm yesterday?

672
00:43:36,600 --> 00:43:38,690
I was eating lunch.

673
00:43:38,690 --> 00:43:41,320
I eat a bit slowly.

674
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,870
I'm not messing around with you right now.

675
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:45,580
I'm not messing around either.

676
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,320
- Just leave.
- What?

677
00:43:51,320 --> 00:43:55,300
If you're going to do as you want, then it isn't too late for you to just leave.

678
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,260
Sorry. Since today was my first day, I miscalculated how long things would take.

679
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,320
I'll be careful starting tomorrow.

680
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:28,530
I'm serious. I'll be here right on time.

681
00:44:30,220 --> 00:44:32,430
Sit down for our meeting.

682
00:44:37,250 --> 00:44:38,480
These members are from the first year.

683
00:44:38,480 --> 00:44:41,080
Hello.

684
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,670
She's a sophomore.

685
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:43,790
Hi, Baek Ho Rang.

686
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:46,420
- Hey.
- Sure, hi.

687
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:49,550
This is the second in command Ji So Hyeon. She's in her second year.

688
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:51,820
Baek Ho Rang will soon be our announcer, if she can adjust.

689
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:54,960
Then So Hyeon can go back to choosing stories.

690
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:58,480
Thanks for working on that with us until now.

691
00:45:00,290 --> 00:45:04,300
Do I read the stories?

692
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:06,490
No.

693
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:09,600
- Why?
- Because it is anonymous, only me and Ji So Hyeon do it.

694
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:13,240
For the time being, read the script well without making a broadcast-accident.

695
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:15,250
Hey!

696
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:18,410
What's the big deal about the stories?

697
00:45:18,410 --> 00:45:21,050
Then in the first place–

698
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:28,800
In the first place, I wouldn't have asked.

699
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,420
It's anonymous so...

700
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:35,250
Go wash that and come because you were late.

701
00:45:35,250 --> 00:45:38,040
What? That?

702
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:39,930
- Me?
- The storage room was clean.

703
00:45:39,930 --> 00:45:41,730
Good job.

704
00:45:43,420 --> 00:45:45,520
What a prick.

705
00:45:54,280 --> 00:45:56,770
I heard that Park Hye Rim didn't come to school today also.

706
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,570
She was so embarrassed that day. Even if I were her, I wouldn't come.

707
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:03,190
Baek Ho Rang, the girl who became famous because of the Keroshi advertisement,

708
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,820
doesn't it feel like she is copying Yoo Na?

709
00:46:05,820 --> 00:46:07,800
-  Don't compare them.
- Get your act together.

710
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:10,390
So fearless, mentioning their real names.

711
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:23,520
New Message

712
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:29,960
Do you want to know the words that Baek Ho Rang hates the most?

713
00:46:43,890 --> 00:46:45,120
Oh shoot!

714
00:46:45,120 --> 00:46:47,120
Sorry.

715
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:49,060
Are you okay?

716
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:04,470
Here. Mop the floor again with this

717
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,500
and finish it with this.

718
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:11,710
Hey, Go Eun Taek, when will you let me read the stories?

719
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:15,090
Even I should be learning something, right?

720
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:20,330
When will you let me know the account?

721
00:47:21,060 --> 00:47:23,960
Depending on how you perform.

722
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:26,600
Make sure to clean those edges as well.

723
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,020
Ji So Hyeon is such a flirt. She flirts with all the boys.

724
00:47:51,020 --> 00:47:54,190
She is only close with Go Eun Taek and Do Woo Jae in the class.

725
00:47:54,190 --> 00:47:56,560
Aren't Do Woo Jae and Kang Jae Yi dating again?

726
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:59,380
That's what. Why a guy with a girlfriend?

727
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:01,290
What about a guy with a girlfriend?

728
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:07,360
False rumors start spreading only because of girls like you who have gossip as a hobby.

729
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:10,030
That Seo Hyeon Jae is also close to me.

730
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:12,560
Jae Yi, it is not Seo Hyeon Jae, it's Ji So Hyeon.

731
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,980
Yeah right, that Ji So Hyeon!

732
00:48:13,980 --> 00:48:17,700
Anyway, stop talking behind people's backs.

733
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,130
So Yi Hyeon! Sorry, Ji So Hyeon.

734
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:25,010
Try not to do things that will give people the wrong impressions about you.

735
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:28,460
I've never done such a thing. What is it?

736
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:31,080
Stop smiling. It's really annoying.

737
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,750
Hey Do Woo Jae. Your hand.

738
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,860
- Where to? To get snacks?
- Yes.

739
00:48:35,860 --> 00:48:39,370
I'm running low on sugar, so buy me some Chocky-Mong.

740
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:49,320
Do you like these?

741
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:56,060
If you do you can have it. I don't like them.

742
00:48:56,060 --> 00:48:58,060
Thank you.

743
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:04,470
- If you want to open it now, then can I have just one?
- Sure.

744
00:49:05,890 --> 00:49:07,340
Here.

745
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,020
Thank you.

746
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:12,180
By the way, is the broadcasting club still recruiting?

747
00:49:12,180 --> 00:49:13,470
Are you asking if we already found someone?

748
00:49:13,470 --> 00:49:16,270
Yes. I was interested in joining too.

749
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:19,730
Oh really? We already did.

750
00:49:19,730 --> 00:49:22,530
She's my friend, Baek Ho Rang.

751
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,010
Are you close to her?

752
00:49:24,010 --> 00:49:27,120
Yes. She may seem a little rude,

753
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,320
but she's not that rude and she's also silly.

754
00:49:31,320 --> 00:49:34,890
Don't tell anyone, but she does anything I say.

755
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:40,490
So, if she's giving you a hard time just tell me. I'll give her a scolding.

756
00:49:40,490 --> 00:49:42,270
The both of you must be really close friends.

757
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:46,760
She really needs someone to take care of her.

758
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,280
But she rejected all clubs and entered the broadcasting club. Why?

759
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:54,530
She doesn't even care about her resume.

760
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,300
Anyway, So Hyeon, what do you like?

761
00:49:57,300 --> 00:50:00,620
Me? I like things like these.

762
00:50:02,100 --> 00:50:04,630
I got it. I'll buy more sweet things next time.

763
00:50:04,630 --> 00:50:06,590
Reply to my Face messages.

764
00:50:06,590 --> 00:50:07,450
Bye.

765
00:50:07,450 --> 00:50:09,390
Bye.

766
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:28,090
 Hi! I'm a first-year student. There's a guy who keeps troubling... 

767
00:50:28,090 --> 00:50:29,720
 Hello! I had a huge fight with my boyfriend. He isn't picking up my calls or replying to my messages. What should I do? 

768
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:33,700
No Smoking

769
00:50:33,740 --> 00:50:35,770
 Smoking Ban - A promise for everyone's sake 

770
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,100
When you did the interview,

771
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:48,130
you asked who wrote the story, right?

772
00:50:49,400 --> 00:50:53,480
Is your entering the broadcasting club related to it?

773
00:50:56,810 --> 00:50:58,820
Shall I tell you?

774
00:51:02,740 --> 00:51:04,920
Why are you acting close to me?

775
00:51:04,920 --> 00:51:07,750
I guess life is better for you now.

776
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,760
Don't go jumping to conclusions.

777
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:15,740
Also, cut your interest in me.

778
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:28,240
Tada. Isn't it pretty?

779
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:30,840
Why are you avoiding me suddenly?

780
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:34,330
If I did this much, you should understand and leave me.

781
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,770
Ji So Hyeon, is it true?

782
00:51:48,220 --> 00:51:49,680
 Who is on rearranging duty?

783
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:50,990
Hold on. I'll tell you.

784
00:51:50,990 --> 00:51:52,820
This week's to-do list
I got it.

785
00:51:52,820 --> 00:51:53,650
 I have checked.

786
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,240
 Confirmed.

787
00:51:55,240 --> 00:51:57,060
Good job.

788
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:11,710
 If I do my work in the broadcasting club sincerely, you'll show me the stories, right?

789
00:52:13,220 --> 00:52:15,070
Talk about this after being sincere.

790
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:17,620
Eun Taek, hi.

791
00:52:17,620 --> 00:52:20,720
- You came early today also. For the broadcasting club?
- Yeah.

792
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,830
You are also early.

793
00:52:22,830 --> 00:52:26,450
I came a little early so that I wouldn't have to wait so long for the bus.

794
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:28,070
It became so.

795
00:52:28,070 --> 00:52:29,850
Which bus do you take?

796
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,290
Bus 98.

797
00:52:31,290 --> 00:52:33,460
Then, normally at what time do you leave home?

798
00:52:33,460 --> 00:52:37,690
Bus 98 comes every five minutes.

799
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:41,950
Why lie? Uselessly.

800
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,520
I'll go first. Bye.

801
00:52:43,520 --> 00:52:45,530
Ah that—

802
00:52:58,740 --> 00:53:00,090
You came?

803
00:53:00,090 --> 00:53:04,190
You're not the type to come in that early, either.

804
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:07,320
What is this? Why are you here at this hour?

805
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:11,080
I told you I'd try hard.

806
00:53:11,080 --> 00:53:13,970
So what? Did you come here this early to clean?

807
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:18,250
Yeah, so make sure you keep your promise.

808
00:53:18,250 --> 00:53:20,880
- What?
- You said you would give me the account soon.

809
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,040
Make sure you keep that promise.

810
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:28,800
From now on, I'm going to give it my best.

811
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,850
So you can look forward to it.

812
00:53:39,260 --> 00:53:41,610
Then start with the mic bench...

813
00:53:41,610 --> 00:53:45,240
♫  Let’s turn on your light, you don't know that yet  ♫

814
00:53:45,240 --> 00:53:47,260
You're here?

815
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:48,350
♫  Leave it to the flow  ♫

816
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:52,040
I just got here, so meet me at the classroom.

817
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:54,120
I already moved it all.

818
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,060
♫  Everyone gets surprised  ♫

819
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:57,430
♫   You're shining enough  ♫

820
00:53:57,430 --> 00:53:59,800
Oh, crap.

821
00:53:59,800 --> 00:54:00,960
What are you doing?

822
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:03,860
I'm almost done, you go ahead.

823
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:10,900
♫  Really, really do, as you wish your light  ♫

824
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:32,970
That's not how you do it.

825
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,030
Then how?

826
00:54:34,030 --> 00:54:35,850
Hand it over.

827
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,440
If you clean it like that, it'll break.

828
00:54:38,440 --> 00:54:42,800
Wipe deep on the inside. You can just dust off on the outside.

829
00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:47,580
Alright, give it back.

830
00:54:47,580 --> 00:54:49,160
When are you going home?

831
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,370
After I'm done with this?

832
00:54:54,390 --> 00:54:56,260
You're so bad at that.

833
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:59,790
What is? Isn't this how you do it?

834
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:02,820
It is. Go on.

835
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:05,650
You're making me feel bad. Hey!

836
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:07,730
Just go home!

837
00:55:07,730 --> 00:55:10,130
Let's do it together.

838
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:48,560
- I heard Baek Ho Rang joined your broadcasting team.
- Yeah.

839
00:55:48,560 --> 00:55:52,190
- It hasn't been a week yet.
- How is it?

840
00:55:52,190 --> 00:55:55,700
At first, it really sucked

841
00:55:55,700 --> 00:55:58,590
but now I think it's gotten better.

842
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:01,910
Do we have literature next?

843
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,900
Yes.

844
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,490
Woo Jae, can you put this on my desk?

845
00:56:06,490 --> 00:56:08,840
I'm going to stop by the broadcasting room first.

846
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:10,350
Thank you.

847
00:56:26,570 --> 00:56:29,190
What the heck, did we not lock up before we left this morning?

848
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,300
It's a good thing we got here first.

849
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:32,960
If Taek Sunbae was here, we'd be dead already, huh?

850
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:34,930
I know, right?

851
00:56:34,930 --> 00:56:37,760
What did Ho Rang Sunbae ask us to clean today? Equipment?

852
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:39,200
Yes, she asked us to clean the equipment.

853
00:56:39,200 --> 00:56:40,850
What did you get from her for cleaning the storage yesterday?

854
00:56:40,850 --> 00:56:42,970
I got makeup. What about—

855
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:45,020
What did you get?

856
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:51,870
Say it again.

857
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:55,730
What did you get?

858
00:56:55,730 --> 00:57:00,860
The thing is... Ho Rang Sunbae told me that she'd give us some of her sponsored products.

859
00:57:00,860 --> 00:57:05,310
So then... You're saying that you've been doing the cleaning this entire time.

860
00:57:05,310 --> 00:57:08,800
She also said she would tag us on her feed.

861
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,890
So that's why you cleaned as well.

862
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:12,790
Yes.

863
00:57:15,260 --> 00:57:18,710
Do you hear

864
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,560
what you're saying right now?

865
00:57:22,830 --> 00:57:23,600
 Broadcasting club captain Go Eun Taek 

866
00:57:23,600 --> 00:57:24,850
 Eun Taek: Where are you?

867
00:57:24,850 --> 00:57:27,270
 Classroom. I am not in-charge of anything today. 

868
00:57:27,270 --> 00:57:30,360
Ho Rang! Ho Rang! Ho Rang! Have you seen this?

869
00:57:31,860 --> 00:57:35,730
 I am Park Hye Rim. The one who was blamed for impersonation. First of all, I'll state that the rumors aren't true.

870
00:57:35,730 --> 00:57:38,220
 A year ago, Baek Ho Rang asked if she could use my phone.

871
00:57:38,220 --> 00:57:39,840
What the heck? You seem so calm.

872
00:57:39,840 --> 00:57:41,640
She's talking crap, aren't you getting upset?

873
00:57:41,640 --> 00:57:45,390
I thought it was big news. She is very dumb.

874
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,710
 Lastly, I'd like to say one thing. 

875
00:57:48,710 --> 00:57:53,090
 Ho Rang, is it true that you love the number sixteen? 

876
00:58:00,860 --> 00:58:02,910
- Seriously?
- I hate her.

877
00:58:02,910 --> 00:58:04,790
Did you see her face?

878
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:07,350
We'll begin the SHBS afternoon broadcast.

879
00:58:07,350 --> 00:58:09,360
 Hello, my beloved friend. 

880
00:58:09,360 --> 00:58:12,530
 After the Elephant Hat, did you receive my second gift? 

881
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:17,330
 You were surprised, right? I really wanted to see your reaction, but it's too bad. 

882
00:58:17,330 --> 00:58:20,390
Next time, I'll prepare something that you'll really like. 

883
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:24,810
Oh, and I kept myself a secret from the friend who sent you the gift

884
00:58:24,810 --> 00:58:28,060
 because I was feeling shy. I hope you like it a lot. 

885
00:58:28,060 --> 00:58:29,720
 I'll see you later. 

886
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:35,820
I wonder if you and your friend are still close, or is that now a thing of the past?

887
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:38,850
I'll start this next song.

888
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:41,590
These moments are when–

889
00:58:46,500 --> 00:58:48,420
You're listening, right?

890
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:52,780
I'm not scared at all because you're doing this, so come in front of me and say it to my face.

891
00:58:52,780 --> 00:58:56,020
Don't spout this bull crap in hiding.

Can't you do this one thing properly? 

903
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,230
You took me in without knowing that I'm like this?

904
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:52,930
Go. We really don't need you now.

905
00:59:52,930 --> 00:59:55,010
She was always like that. Don't think too much about it.

906
00:59:55,010 --> 00:59:56,530
You seem to know Baek Ho Rang well.

907
00:59:56,530 --> 00:59:58,790
I just knew her for a bit in middle school.

908
00:59:58,790 --> 01:00:00,700
You really get on my nerves.

909
01:00:00,700 --> 01:00:03,130
Hey Baek Ho Rang! Let's talk.

910
01:00:03,130 --> 01:00:06,800
People who don't keep their promises and lie are the people I hate the most.

911
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:08,870
You don't have anything to hide, I guess.

912
01:00:08,870 --> 01:00:11,290
Do well.

913
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:18,620
– Epilogue –

914
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:15,650
I told you many times to close it, but you didn't listen.
