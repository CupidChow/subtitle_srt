00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,625
I really looked everywhere,
but I couldn't find her.

180
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,725
My gosh.

181
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:19,525
I miss Ho-rang.

182
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,065
Me too.

183
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,765
It seems like you and Ho-rang got
really close while we were broken up.

184
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:27,235
Well...

185
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:30,035
She's a better person
than I thought she was.

186
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,509
But the more I think about it,
the more annoyed I'm getting.

187
00:10:32,510 --> 00:10:34,649
If it's true, admit it,
and if it's not, she should deny it.

188
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,475
Why won't she say anything
and make everyone nervous?

189
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:38,845
My gosh.

190
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:55,865
We agreed to post up the ads for
the video festival today, right?

191
00:10:56,270 --> 00:10:57,369
What?

192
00:10:57,370 --> 00:11:00,535
- Oh, right. Yes.
- If you're busy, do you want help?

193
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,365
No, it's okay.

194
00:11:06,680 --> 00:11:08,245
She wasn't in her classroom.

195
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,245
Baek Ho-rang.

196
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:15,145
I went to the nurse's office just in case,

197
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,215
but she wasn't there.

198
00:11:18,790 --> 00:11:20,055
Oh, okay.

199
00:11:22,030 --> 00:11:23,285
Aren't you curious?

200
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:26,125
About what?

201
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:28,529
You're not looking for her,

202
00:11:28,530 --> 00:11:30,195
and you're just sitting here.

203
00:11:32,670 --> 00:11:34,065
I'm waiting for her.

204
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:36,235
We made a promise.

205
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,345
But I'm not sure.

206
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:47,345
I hope it doesn't take her a long time.

207
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,055
Are you nervous?

208
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:59,155
Don't be nervous.

209
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,525
She'll tell you herself.

210
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:14,075
[ Isn't this hilarious? ]

211
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:17,405
[ You're the one who got beaten up, but
you're the one who's scared right now. ]

212
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:24,420
[ Baek Ho, Kim Yu, Kang Jae ]

213
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:21,385
[ Ho-rang. Was our school always this big? ]

214
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,149
[ Just tell me where you are,
and I'll go to you by myself. ]

215
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:25,220
[ Me too. ]

216
00:12:24,490 --> 00:12:31,300
[ Baek Ho, Kim Yu, Kang Jae ]

217
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,829
[ If we say we're going together,
do you think she'll tell us? ]

218
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,855
[ Why not? I'm Baek Ho-rang's best friend. ]

219
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:34,295
[ I'm curious. ]

220
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:39,235
I wonder how your friends will react
after seeing that.

221
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:03,129
So-hyun will promote the page tomorrow.

222
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:05,795
Today, we're going to put up the posters
on each floor's bulletin board.

223
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,129
We can split into groups of two
and each take a floor.

224
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:09,295
- Okay.
- Okay.

225
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,395
Are there any questions?

226
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:17,435
Then what happened with Ho-rang?

227
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:22,379
I'm asking because she and I
are in the same group.

228
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,375
I thought we finished that discussion
this morning.

229
00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,915
Oh, right.

230
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,289
We can re-edit the video,

231
00:13:29,290 --> 00:13:32,755
but there are other things like preparing
the stage and such, which is why I asked.

232
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:36,285
I was wondering if there were
any changes since then.

233
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:39,359
If Baek Ho-rang comes,
I'll give her a different task,

234
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,329
so let's have someone cover for her
until then.

235
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:43,065
Team A's almost done filming, right?

236
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:44,839
Yes. We're going to finish up today.

237
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,499
Should we join Team B tomorrow?

238
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,905
Yes. Thank you.

239
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:50,465
Eun-taek.

240
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,480
Ho-rang left the group chat.

241
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,050
[ Baek Ho-rang left the group. ]

242
00:13:54,650 --> 00:13:56,145
- What?
- Really?

243
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:00,180
- She really left the group.
- She did.

244
00:14:00,050 --> 00:14:02,090
[ Baek Ho-rang ]

245
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,985
[ Ko Eun-taek,
I'm quitting the broadcasting team. ]

246
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:14,629
- Eun-taek.
- Let's talk later.

247
00:14:14,630 --> 00:14:16,765
She won't tell you anything
even if you go see her.

248
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:20,739
- What?
- When I told you I'd tell you about her,

249
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:22,905
you said that you wanted to
hear it from her directly.

250
00:14:23,140 --> 00:14:26,075
She won't tell you anything
even if you go now.

251
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,845
The post on the community

252
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,175
was written by me, Eun-taek.

253
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:44,325
- She's the worst.
- What?

254
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:49,295
Hey. Why did you ignore my messages?
I was worried about you.

255
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,599
Is it that hard to message me back?

256
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:53,895
You have no affection for people.

257
00:14:57,510 --> 00:14:59,605
Where are you going? Wait a second.

258
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:07,645
Here.

259
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,549
It's obvious.

260
00:15:09,550 --> 00:15:11,485
You didn't have lunch again, right?

261
00:15:11,890 --> 00:15:14,215
Eat this first and let's talk.

262
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,029
I turned off my phone.

263
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,329
Okay.

264
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,729
I understand, so take this...

265
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,965
Because annoying people kept messaging me.

266
00:15:29,940 --> 00:15:32,205
I need to go. Can you let go of me?

267
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:42,545
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

268
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:46,115
What did you just do right now?

269
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,135
I get it.

270
00:15:58,870 --> 00:16:00,335
Tell me before you leave.

271
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,239
About what?

272
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:10,305
You know that I'm always straightforward.

273
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:11,675
What was that post about?

274
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,715
You know you've been acting strange
since that message was posted, right?

275
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:20,115
You said it wasn't true.
You told me that it wasn't true.

276
00:16:21,690 --> 00:16:23,829
Hey. Say something.

277
00:16:23,830 --> 00:16:25,995
You're really frustrating me.

278
00:16:28,230 --> 00:16:31,025
Why must I explain myself to you?

279
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,395
What?

280
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:36,435
Everything in that post

281
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:40,675
is true.

282
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,609
- Hey.
- That's unbelievable.

283
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:45,845
- I can't believe it.
- She admitted to it.

284
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,645
Your expression is a sight for sore eyes.

285
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,449
Hey, you...

286
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,585
If you can't believe me, just talk
about me behind my back like them.

287
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,859
Don't act like we're close and pretend
like you're the one who was hurt.

288
00:16:56,860 --> 00:16:58,055
It's annoying.

289
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,555
Hey, Baek Ho-rang.

290
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:03,765
Hey, Kang Jae-yi.

291
00:17:04,969 --> 00:17:06,834
We only started talking a few months ago.

292
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:09,265
Do you really think we're close?

293
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:11,935
You must've forgotten,

294
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,375
but I've always been like this.

295
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,775
Stop overreacting and making lame excuses
like we're friends and shut your mouth.

296
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:31,555
Baek Ho-rang.

297
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,265
Get out of my way.

298
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,645
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,045
Do you know why

300
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:53,515
Baek Ho-rang joined the broadcasting team?

301
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:57,045
She joined to find out about

302
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,685
the broadcasting team's account.

303
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,899
The letter from today's lunch broadcast.
Who wrote that letter?

304
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:08,369
[ I wrote that story. ]

305
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:10,199
So, come to me and say it to my face

306
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,439

from behind the keyboard.

307

from the memories of that time, ]

309
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:21,110

living her life like nothing happened. ]

00:18:24,920 --> 00:18:26,375
[ I wanted her to hear it. ]

00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,949
[ She's afraid that it will interfere
with her popularity, ]

[ so she joined the broadcasting team
to keep an eye on me. ]

317
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,985
Every day was a nightmare for me.

318

Ko Eun-taek.

319
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,325
This is

320
00:18:43,830 --> 00:18:46,665
the answer that you wanted to hear
so badly.

321
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:49,465
I am

322
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:52,735
the victim of the Baek Ho-rang incident.

323
00:19:04,290 --> 00:19:07,559
How rude. I asked her
because I was worried about her,

324
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,629
but she made such a big deal out of it.

325
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,659
She forgot about every time
I took her side, didn't she?

326
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,895
You forgot, didn't you?

327
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:17,625
I have to admit,

328
00:19:18,270 --> 00:19:21,335
I did suspect her a little.

329
00:19:21,510 --> 00:19:23,865
But that doesn't mean that she can talk
so harshly to her friend.

330
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,535
She should've just made it clear.

331
00:19:26,710 --> 00:19:29,305
Jae-yi, when is the discipline committee
taking action on her?

332
00:19:29,410 --> 00:19:31,519
- What disciplinary committee?
- Ho-rang!

333
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,875
Isn't there an anti-bullying committee
at your school?

334
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,249
It was back in middle school.
Why would they do anything now?

335
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,089
And we don't even know
if it's true or not yet.

336
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,429
There are proof and a victim.
Of course it's true.

337
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:44,685
Hold on.

338
00:19:45,230 --> 00:19:46,825
There's a victim?

339
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,699

00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:20,929
[ Don't you feel bad for... ]

352
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:22,929
[ We all knew that she was
a terrible person all along. ]

353
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:24,765
[ Ms. Ho-rang! It's okay, you're pretty. ]

354
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,939
[ I can say it was a good day ]

355
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,739
[ - after looking at your face.
- Please message me. ]

356
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:29,505
[ I'm proud of Korea for having Ho-rang. ]

357
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:39,315
[ SHBS Captain Ko Eun-taek ]

358
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:57,299
[ I'm in front of your house right now. ]

359
00:20:57,300 --> 00:21:00,595
[ I'll wait for you for ten minutes
and leave after. ]

360
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:22,185
[ I'll wait for you for ten minutes
and leave after. ]

361
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,845
How long have you been waiting here?

362
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,975
I had a lot to think about.

363
00:22:22,690 --> 00:22:24,715
It's fine. At least you're here now.

364
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,155
I have so many questions to ask you,

365
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,125
but let me ask you this.

366
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,125
Are you ready now?

367
00:22:41,910 --> 00:22:43,565
To tell me what you were going to tell me.

368
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:46,635
Are you ready?

369
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:56,015
I didn't feel good about texting you
that I was quitting the broadcasting team,

370
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,385
so I wanted to tell you in person.

371
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,985
Anything else?

372
00:23:08,570 --> 00:23:09,665
No.

373
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:15,039
I know you didn't say it,

374
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:16,605
but you were tired of it.

375
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,675
When the incident broke out
and everyone was going all over,

376
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:23,745
things at the broadcasting team
must've gone chaotic too,

377
00:23:25,550 --> 00:23:26,815
and

378
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,619
I didn't want to be...

379
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:30,715
Baek Ho-rang!

380
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,885
Is that all you can say

381
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,395
to someone who has been waiting for you?

382
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:43,995
I spent the whole weekend
waiting for you to text me,

383
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:47,435
worried to death that something
may have happened to you.

384
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,835
So, that's all you want to say?

385
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:55,045
Everyone is busy talking about you,

386
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:57,575
yet you won't say anything.

387
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,975
How can I trust you then?

388
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:02,845
If, by chance,

389
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,215
any of that is true,

390
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:10,225
I even thought

391
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:12,455
of letting you two meet

392
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:14,455
so that you can apologize properly.

393
00:24:15,030 --> 00:24:17,165
While you were avoiding me
and ignoring my texts and calls,

394
00:24:17,430 --> 00:24:20,035
my head was exploding with thoughts.

395
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:24,065
But I held on

396
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:29,075
because you said you'd tell me one day.

397
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:35,815
Were you scared

398
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,915
that the rumors might be true?

399
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,355
Yes.

400
00:24:48,370 --> 00:24:49,565
You must've been.

401
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:55,635
Maybe I believed you too easily
because you said

402
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:57,635
that you'd wait for me until I tell you.

403
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,315
You don't have to wait any longer.

404
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,255
Don't wait.

405
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:17,385
I don't think I can say anything to you
anyway.

406
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:24,895
Just think whatever you want.

407
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:31,135
That'll be easier for both of us.

408
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,575
Do you mean what you're saying?

409
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:37,605
Yes.

410
00:25:38,250 --> 00:25:40,915
It's so much better now
that it's all out in the open.

411
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:43,285
We should've done this earlier.

412
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,985
That would've saved us
from unnecessary overthinking.

413
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,185
That's what I came out to tell you.

414
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,199
I'm going to quit the broadcasting team,

415
00:25:52,200 --> 00:25:54,425
so recruit a new member or whatever.

416
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,735
And since we're talking,

417
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:04,305
isn't it better to be the perpetrator

418
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:07,005
than to be a victim?

419
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:16,245
Remember how I told you

420
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:20,755
that I like you?

421
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:26,925
I'm regretting telling you
that I like you for the first time.

422
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:30,965
Fine.

423
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:33,665
You can live on like that.

424
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,865
You can keep living on,
pushing people away

425
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,705
even when they wait for you.

426
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:47,915
You want to quit the broadcasting team?

427
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,815
Go ahead.

428
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,085
If that's what you want, then so be it.

429
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:53,415
[ "Just Me and You" ]

430
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,055
[ What's this? ]

431
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:00,589
They gave me these on my way out.

432
00:28:00,590 --> 00:28:01,689
You like things like these.

433
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:02,785
You can have them.

434
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,255
[ I'll wait ]

435
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,395
until you're ready to tell me.

436
00:28:08,470 --> 00:28:09,725
[ Don't wait. ]

437
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:13,395
I don't think I can say
anything to you anyway.

438
00:28:42,030 --> 00:28:43,225
Hui-su.

439
00:28:44,670 --> 00:28:46,065
Is that really you?

440
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,895
What?

441
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,939
You were mentioned
on Seoyeon High Confessions.

442
00:28:49,940 --> 00:28:52,405
I was wondering if it was really you.

443
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,305
Why are you looking at me?

444
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:00,599
Just tell the truth
and make things easier for you.

445
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,795
Say that it wasn't.

446
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,505
If she really was the victim, how could
she sit there like nothing happened?

447
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:08,735
I don't think I could.

448
00:29:11,910 --> 00:29:14,375
Well, the truth is...

449
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:17,775
Everyone is here, right?

450
00:29:27,790 --> 00:29:29,695
I called for this meeting
to make an announcement.

451
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,925
I wanted to have a meeting this morning

452
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,435
because Baek Ho-rang dropped out.

453
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,505
So I want to divide our roles again.

454
00:29:46,010 --> 00:29:47,209
For the last month,

455
00:29:47,210 --> 00:29:50,015
I want Young-jae and So-hyun
to take care of the announcer position.

456
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,885
As for Team B, like we discussed,
I want Eun-ha to help out with the props.

457
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:55,315
Okay.

458
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:58,285
I know that you are confused
about what happened recently.

459
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:00,055
But I hope

460
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:02,325
you'll do your best for the last month.

461
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,199
- Okay.
- Okay.

462
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,325
Good work.

463
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,795
- Good work.
- Good work.

464
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,245
Are you okay, Eun-taek?

465
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:26,385
After telling you everything yesterday,

466
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:28,485
I thought about what I did.

467
00:30:29,060 --> 00:30:32,585
And I was worried that
it might have come as a big shock to you.

468
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:35,495
I was going to find out anyway.

469
00:30:36,830 --> 00:30:37,955
Thank you

470
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,365
for believing everything that I said.

471
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:43,965
I didn't believe everything you said.

472
00:30:46,470 --> 00:30:48,165
You know the stories you sent?

473
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,605
Are you sure you wrote them
in the heat of the moment?

474
00:30:51,880 --> 00:30:52,905
What?

475
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,245
Oh, those. I couldn't make it obvious
that I wrote them.

476
00:30:57,550 --> 00:30:59,645
The stories had to be chosen
for the broadcast.

477
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,515
And I just wanted her to hear them.

478
00:31:05,290 --> 00:31:07,185
I see. Okay.

479
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,525
Then, I'll get going.

480
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,605
I told your teacher that
you'll have a work-study day at home.

481
00:31:22,810 --> 00:31:24,605
Okay. I see.

482
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:32,349
- Did you stay up all night?
- Yes.

483
00:31:32,350 --> 00:31:35,245
The client wanted me to change
the proposal out of the blue.

484
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:36,915
Where's Dad?

485
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:39,529
He'll be on a business trip
until tomorrow.

486
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:40,955
Didn't I tell you?

487
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,255
This wouldn't be the first time.

488
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:49,195
Should I drop out of school?

489
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,735
Why?

490
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,675
No, I mean...

491
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,845
Is it because of
the school violence thing?

492
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:07,985
How did you know?

493
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,389
All of the employees at my company
are quite young.

494
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,985
They showed it to me.

495
00:32:14,060 --> 00:32:15,255
Is it true?

496
00:32:17,730 --> 00:32:18,795
No.

497
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:23,795
That's all I need.

498
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,969
If you avoid it and hide
because you're scared,

499
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:29,005
you'll basically be admitting it.

500
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,735
Why don't you hang in there a bit more?

501
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:43,115
Ho-rang, I need to get some sleep.

502
00:32:53,870 --> 00:32:55,465
[ Did you see Ho-rang yesterday? ]

503
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:02,035
Your face says it all.
Did you have a fight with her?

504
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,445
But why do you look like
you are more hurt?

505
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,919
I doubt that you would have kept quiet
given your character.

506
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:13,345
I'm sure you pointed out
all the right things.

507
00:33:13,650 --> 00:33:15,685
But why do you seem more hurt?

508
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:22,595
Hey.

509
00:33:22,830 --> 00:33:25,155
You know, I broke up with Jae-yi recently.

510
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:28,429
When I was fighting with Jae-yi,
I thought I was rational.

511
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:31,335
And I thought I based
my arguments on logic.

512
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,305
But I didn't.

513
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:37,175
Nothing is black and white
in a relationship.

514
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:42,975
You know, just saying.

515
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,745
You remind me of myself not long ago.

516
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,155
You should follow your heart too.

517
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:53,485
I don't know what got you to agonize
yourself like this, but the thing is,

518
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:57,555
the most painful part was
not being able to see her.

519
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:04,695
I learned that lesson
the hard way this time.

520
00:34:05,510 --> 00:34:08,105
- Let's eat some chips.
- Chips.

521
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,979
What were you talking about?
He looks awful.

522
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:14,874
Right.
His face got so slim just overnight.

523
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,289
Eun-taek, did Ho-rang reach out to you?

524
00:34:19,290 --> 00:34:20,849
She didn't come to school today.

525
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,115
- Jae-yi. Here.
- Yes?

526
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,184
- Thank you.
- Sure.

[ I thought about some other things
that you liked. ]

700
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,895
[ You like to get fresh air from the roof. ]

701
00:46:53,710 --> 00:46:55,909
[ When someone compliments you,
you act like you don't care, ]

702
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:57,675
[ but secretly, you feel really happy. ]

703
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:02,305
[ Even though you didn't tell me,
I already knew. ]

704
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,285
[ Your face shows it when you like
or dislike something. ]

705
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:12,855
[ That's why when I wasn't sure,
I always checked your expression first. ]

706
00:47:14,460 --> 00:47:17,255
[ But why couldn't I do that this time? ]

707
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:21,295
[ You always told me everything ]

708
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:24,265
[ with your behavior and your expressions. ]

709
00:47:27,810 --> 00:47:30,675
[ It might've been because I heard
what I wanted to hear. ]

710
00:47:35,950 --> 00:47:37,275
[ You told me that ]

711
00:47:38,680 --> 00:47:40,789
[ the more you love someone, ]

712
00:47:40,790 --> 00:47:43,485
[ the more you want to hide. ]

713
00:47:46,930 --> 00:47:48,755
[ I think I understand that
a bit more now. ]

714
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:55,595
[ That's why I'm regretting it. ]

715
00:47:57,640 --> 00:48:00,165
[ I regret not understanding you properly
and losing you. ]

716
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:04,935
[ I'm sorry. ]

717
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,315
[ I'm really sorry. ]

718
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:29,049
Why is it always cold
right around the CSAT?

719
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,590
- My brother will probably repeat a year.
- I think the same goes for us.

720
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:31,949
[ Let's ace that exam! ]

721
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,120
[ Let's ace that exam! ]

722
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:35,159
Did you hear? Baek Ho-rang is
quitting school.

723
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,089
- Really?
- Yes.

724
00:48:36,090 --> 00:48:37,859
- Who told you?
- I don't know.

725
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,829
- No way.
- I'm serious.

726
00:48:39,830 --> 00:48:41,359
Whose seat is that empty one?

727
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,925
- Ho-rang's.
- Ho-rang's.

728
00:48:43,930 --> 00:48:45,229
Let's start class.

729
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:47,399
Remember the assignment I gave you
last week?

730
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:49,635
- No.
- Come on.

731
00:48:51,940 --> 00:48:53,935
[ Baek Ho-rang ]

732
00:48:55,540 --> 00:48:56,709
Hey.

733
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,675
Hey.

734
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:00,275
Yu-shin, what's for lunch today?

735
00:49:00,350 --> 00:49:01,719
Barley rice, seaweed soup,

736
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:03,549
duck meat, fried kimchi, and yogurt.

737
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,149
That's the worst.

738
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,459
Do you want to go to the snack bar?

739
00:49:06,460 --> 00:49:07,859
You're not eating with Woo-jae today?

740
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:10,189
He ate first because he has
a student council meeting today.

741
00:49:10,190 --> 00:49:13,325
Is that right? All right, then.
I'll have a bulgogi burger.

742
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,195
- Hey!
- So-hyun!

743
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:17,829
You don't have a broadcast schedule today?

744
00:49:17,830 --> 00:49:19,999
No. Someone else is on it today.

745
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:21,769
We're heading to the snack bar.
You want to join?

746
00:49:21,770 --> 00:49:24,535
Sorry, I have to be somewhere.

747
00:49:24,840 --> 00:49:26,365
It's important.

748
00:49:26,910 --> 00:49:27,905
What is it?

749
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:31,079
Why does she look so happy?

750
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,645
I don't know. She's so adorable.

751
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:38,115
It's this. When I uploaded
the karaoke photo on Confessions.

752
00:49:38,190 --> 00:49:39,855
You showed us already
a couple of days ago.

753
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:41,255
Did I?

754
00:49:41,960 --> 00:49:43,115
Right.

755
00:49:43,460 --> 00:49:46,999
Now that I think about it,
there's something else.

756
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:48,695
- What is it?
- Hey, Hui-su.

757
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:00,179
Why are you here?
You should be eating lunch.

758
00:50:00,180 --> 00:50:02,605
Don't mind me. Just keep doing
what you were doing.

759
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:05,179
- Hui-su!
- Yes?

760
00:50:05,180 --> 00:50:06,715
Tell us. What is it?

761
00:50:07,050 --> 00:50:08,275
Well,

762
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:11,985
it's...

763
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,695
Before we begin, I have an announcement
to make.

764
00:50:22,400 --> 00:50:23,765
We're going

765
00:50:24,870 --> 00:50:26,029
live for today's show.

766
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,665
- Live?
- Live?

767
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:29,599
Who's hosting?

768
00:50:29,600 --> 00:50:31,435
Shouldn't Young-jae do it?

769
00:50:31,840 --> 00:50:33,509
Eun-taek, then I'll...

770
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:34,575
No worries.

771
00:50:34,980 --> 00:50:36,205
The host is

772
00:50:38,310 --> 00:50:39,545
coming soon.

773
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:52,155
No way!

774
00:52:26,320 --> 00:52:27,755
Ko Eun-taek,

775
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:35,195
the truth is,

776
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:44,905
I'm not the perpetrator. I'm a victim.

777
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:55,175
What I couldn't tell you is...

778
00:53:29,120 --> 00:53:30,285
Don't tell me.

779
00:53:31,020 --> 00:53:32,245
You don't have to.

780
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:41,555
It's fine.

781
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,925
It's all going to be fine.

782
00:54:25,210 --> 00:54:26,465
That's why

783
00:54:30,280 --> 00:54:33,005
I thought I'd be able to say the truth.

784
00:54:35,450 --> 00:54:37,185
You can say whatever you want.

785
00:54:39,020 --> 00:54:40,815
I'll take care of everything else.

786
00:54:56,500 --> 00:54:58,169
- I'm serious.
- Please turn on the TV!

787
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,639
Our show is starting soon!

788
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:00,679
- What?
- What?

789
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,179
- What?
- They're broadcasting on TV today?

790
00:55:02,180 --> 00:55:03,979
Please turn the TV on.

791
00:55:03,980 --> 00:55:05,809
Young-jae, we're holding
a live show today?

792
00:55:05,810 --> 00:55:07,379
I wasn't told that.

793
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:08,749
Earlier at the Broadcasting Studio...

794
00:55:08,750 --> 00:55:11,045
Young-jae, you can get going now.
I'll explain it to her.

795
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:12,245
Okay.

796
00:55:13,760 --> 00:55:15,315
Are you going to stay here?

797
00:55:17,030 --> 00:55:18,629
Isn't that Baek Ho-rang?

798
00:55:18,630 --> 00:55:21,555
- What?
- No way.

799
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:25,565
Hello.

800
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,995
I'm Baek Ho-rang.

801
00:55:28,540 --> 00:55:30,569
It's her.

802
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:33,605
[ I wanted to say something to everyone, ]

803
00:55:35,210 --> 00:55:37,475
[ and that's why I'm on camera today. ]

804
00:55:39,710 --> 00:55:41,545
[ I think this will be ]

805
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:45,315
the first and the last time I'll say this.

806
00:55:47,460 --> 00:55:48,555
I'm...

807
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:01,595
To tell you the truth,

808
00:56:06,410 --> 00:56:08,635
I'm a victim of school bullying.

809
00:56:09,580 --> 00:56:11,349
- What is she saying?
- What does she mean?

810
00:56:11,350 --> 00:56:12,879
- She's not the perpetrator?
- What?

811
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:15,349
[ It took me two whole years ]

812
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:16,579
[ to bring myself to say this. ]

813
00:56:16,580 --> 00:56:18,289
What is she talking about?

814
00:56:18,290 --> 00:56:20,515
[ It was my birthday. ]

815
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:22,389
[ My so-called friends called me ]

816
00:56:22,390 --> 00:56:25,785
[ to come to the karaoke
for my birthday party, ]

817
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:28,425
[ and there, ]

818
00:56:28,930 --> 00:56:31,095
[ I was bullied. ]

819
00:56:33,100 --> 00:56:34,865
[ But even then, ]

820
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:39,935
[ I couldn't tell anyone, ]

821
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,849
[ not even to the one person ]

822
00:56:43,850 --> 00:56:45,875
[ who genuinely thought of me
as her friend. ]

823
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,875
[ Even more than the fact
that I was beaten up ]

824
00:56:50,750 --> 00:56:52,615
[ and it was physically hurting, ]

825
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,299
[ I was more scared
of how everyone would think of me. ]

826
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:03,995
- Is she serious?
- No way.

827
00:57:05,730 --> 00:57:09,435
[ "She was probably bullied
because there was a good reason." ]

828
00:57:10,340 --> 00:57:12,705
I was scared of

829
00:57:13,070 --> 00:57:16,505
people's thoughtless comments
and pitiful eyes at me.

830
00:57:17,810 --> 00:57:20,915
[ Here's what I could do
when I was being bullied. ]

831
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:23,445
I closed my eyes

832
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:27,715
and kept quiet.

833
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:31,055
And I thought, "It will go away someday."

834
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:35,055
I tried to get through it
with that in mind.

835
00:57:39,600 --> 00:57:41,965
But in the end, I became the bully.

836
00:57:43,770 --> 00:57:45,735
[ Whether I was the bully or the victim, ]

837
00:57:45,810 --> 00:57:48,509
[ I still had to deal with being stared at
by so many people. ]

838
00:57:48,510 --> 00:57:50,105
[ So I don't care anymore. ]

839
00:57:50,710 --> 00:57:52,449
[ I thought being the bully ]

840
00:57:52,450 --> 00:57:54,715
[ might be less embarrassing
than being the victim. ]

841
00:57:54,750 --> 00:57:57,315
What is this all about?

842
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,685
- Ho-rang.
[ - But it wasn't. ]

843
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:05,185
[ What my friends wanted ]

844
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:07,895
was the truth.

845
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,665
[ My friends ]

846
00:58:12,930 --> 00:58:14,635
[ wanted to know the truth ]

847
00:58:15,600 --> 00:58:17,405
[ even if they didn't want to face it ]

848
00:58:19,870 --> 00:58:22,235
or believe it.

849
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:28,745
So

850
00:58:30,720 --> 00:58:33,815
I decided to speak out instead of hiding.

851
00:58:38,190 --> 00:58:39,955
Not just for me,

852
00:58:42,600 --> 00:58:44,325
but for my friends too.

853
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,645
Hey, Jeong Hui-su.

854
00:59:07,460 --> 00:59:08,755
Stop the act now.

855
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,325
What are you talking about?

856
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,155
I was scared of her.

857
00:59:13,490 --> 00:59:15,225
I'm sure you know too, So-hyun.

858
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,065
You know how much Baek Ho-rang hurt me.

859
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:20,299
Ever since she joined
the broadcasting team, I...

860
00:59:20,300 --> 00:59:22,495
Ho-rang lost
the flash drive at the festival

861
00:59:22,870 --> 00:59:24,165
because of you.

862
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:26,569
- Really?
- She did that?

863
00:59:26,570 --> 00:59:28,605
- What?
- Was she lying all along?

864
00:59:28,840 --> 00:59:31,009
- To say that you were scared,
- What's this about?

865
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:32,979
- you obviously weren't.
- What is that?

866
00:59:32,980 --> 00:59:34,875
- What is that?
- She's right.

867
00:59:35,180 --> 00:59:38,715
- Let me see.
- Hey, bring it.

868
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:42,215
I hated her.

869
00:59:42,490 --> 00:59:43,925
Why? I can't do that?

870
00:59:44,530 --> 00:59:46,885
Well, sure. Let's leave it at that.

871
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:49,629
The evidence photo you showed
to your friends earlier.

872
00:59:49,630 --> 00:59:51,225
Can you show that to me too?

873
00:59:51,630 --> 00:59:52,965
Let me verify that.

874
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,795
Who knows?

875
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:00,705
Perhaps, I might find similar photos
somewhere when I start digging.

876
01:00:02,710 --> 01:00:03,805
Let me see it.

877
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,849
- Seriously?
- She really lied?

878
01:00:09,850 --> 01:00:11,549
- Unbelievable.
- I can't believe it.

879
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,959
- Is this really happening?
- She faked it?

880
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:15,385
- No way.
- Gosh.

881
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:19,725
Fine. Yes!

882
01:00:20,730 --> 01:00:22,225
It was all an act.

883
01:00:22,530 --> 01:00:25,029
I did all of that because
I wanted her to be miserable.

884
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:26,699
- What?
- Seriously?

885
01:00:26,700 --> 01:00:28,599
- Can you believe this?
- She's crazy.

886
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,295
What about you guys?

887
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:33,469
Let's be honest. You were badmouthing her

888
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:35,135
because this was the perfect chance.

889
01:00:36,010 --> 01:00:38,345
Why are you looking at me like that?

890
01:00:38,810 --> 01:00:41,175
Why are you treating me like a psychopath?

891
01:00:41,750 --> 01:00:44,189
You didn't like her from the start too!

892
01:00:44,190 --> 01:00:46,289
Why are you pretending
you had no part in this?

893
01:00:46,290 --> 01:00:47,455
Darn it.

894
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:51,389
You crazy witch!

895
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:54,029
- Hey, say that again. What?
- Hey, what are you doing?

896
01:00:54,030 --> 01:00:55,429
You come here!

897
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,169
- Stop it.
- You!

898
01:00:57,170 --> 01:01:00,635
I am afraid of how people
will look at me now.

899
01:01:02,140 --> 01:01:03,695
But from now on,

900
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:07,475
I will not run away because I'm scared.

901
01:01:12,980 --> 01:01:15,345
And because people who love me

902
01:01:19,320 --> 01:01:21,155
are with me now.

903
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:36,095
Good job, Ho-rang.

904
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:40,765
I have nothing hiding from you now.

905
01:02:42,093 --> 01:02:43,188
I know.

906
01:02:45,410 --> 01:02:47,635
Thank you for giving me time, Eun-taek.

907
01:04:20,158 --> 01:04:23,412
[ Live On ]

908
01:04:23,868 --> 01:04:25,033
[ Eun-taek. ]

909
01:04:26,008 --> 01:04:27,503
[ Do you want to meet tomorrow? ]

910
01:04:27,638 --> 01:04:29,007
[ - So-hyun. ]
- Yes?

911
01:04:29,008 --> 01:04:30,447
It's been so long, right?

912
01:04:30,448 --> 01:04:33,373
Do you remember when we dated?

913
01:04:34,048 --> 01:04:36,043
[ It's Woo-jae and my 1,000th day
anniversary soon. ]

914
01:04:36,178 --> 01:04:37,717
[ We'll get a present for each other ]

915
01:04:37,718 --> 01:04:39,947
[ and exchange it on that day
as a surprise. So it's a secret. ]

916
01:04:39,948 --> 01:04:41,983
[ I'm sorry for making you wait long. ]

917
01:04:42,488 --> 01:04:44,483
I like you, Eun-taek.

918
01:04:46,258 --> 01:04:47,723
[ The waiting was worth it. ]

919
01:04:48,558 --> 01:04:49,653
Ho-rang.
