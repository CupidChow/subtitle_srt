00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:34,800
[Echoes of the Self]

2
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,090
But in the end,

3
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:45,060
you still died because of me.

4
00:00:57,870 --> 00:01:00,700
I thought I could change everything.

5
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,680
But I found out
I couldn't change anything at all.

6
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,080
I never expected to have actually
returned to 3 years ago.

7
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,080
By some twist of fate,

8
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:14,240
I became Princess Fu Wei of Daqing.

9
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:22,270
I thought it was heaven's blessing,

10
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:27,490
allowing me to save myself

11
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:30,330
and protect you too.

12
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,820
So I pushed you away again and again.

13
00:01:38,039 --> 00:01:39,280
I never thought...

14
00:01:50,330 --> 00:01:52,190
But did you ever ask what I wanted?

15
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,810
Fu Wei.

16
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,360
You say

17
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,320
you caused my death in our past life,

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,760
and now you want to protect me.

19
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,280
So you push me away.

20
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:09,530
But what if I say

21
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,880
I don't want your protection?

22
00:02:16,829 --> 00:02:18,760
What if I just want to be with you?

23
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,150
Yan.

24
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:40,860
I've been

25
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,870
to countless battlefields,

26
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:46,700
never thought

27
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:50,050
I'd be protected like this now.

28
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,560
Even now, when I think about it...

29
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:57,690
I still get a little angry.

30
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,710
I don't care if you're human or ghost,

31
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,820
I've chosen you.

32
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,190
What's your choice?

33
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,670
You only get one chance.

34
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,790
You'll regret it.

35
00:03:26,810 --> 00:03:27,740
I won't.

36
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,770
Fu Wei,

37
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:33,910
do you know?

38
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:35,960
Actually,

39
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,190
since meeting you,

40
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,190
I've had several dreams.

41
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:43,930
In those dreams,

42
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,829
at the Imperial City gate,

43
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,730
arrows poured down.

44
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,240
I fell in the snow,

45
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,360
and someone ran toward me.

46
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:59,620
She called my name over and over.

47
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:03,690
So,

48
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:07,710
it wasn't just a dream,

49
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,170
was it?

50
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,710
It was how our story ended.

51
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,420
I'm not afraid.

52
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,860
I even look forward to that day coming.

53
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:25,170
Because in my dreams,

54
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,530
you ran to me without hesitation

55
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:32,600
and called me Yan.

56
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,270
It's wonderful.

57
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,060
So between us,

58
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,490
it wasn't just a chance encounter,

59
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,500
but a bond spanning lifetimes.

60
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:07,940
I will find a way

61
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,270
to keep you alive.

62
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,080
Your Highness, where are you going?

63
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,580
You've already achieved your goal.

64
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,700
Where I'm going

65
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,200
is none of your business.

66
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,930
Your Highness, please wait.

67
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your Highness.

68
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,840
I am the Princess of Daqing.

69
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,420
Your Highness is
the Crown Prince of Yunrui.

70
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,380
Our marriage

71
00:06:03,410 --> 00:06:06,610
concerns diplomatic relations
between our two nations.

72
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:13,050
If Your Highness abandons me
on our wedding night,

73
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:14,640
once word gets out,

74
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:16,360
it will cause scandal

75
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,540
and harm both our nations.

76
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,280
I urge Your Highness

77
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,810
to think carefully before acting.

78
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,880
Don't you know how you came by

79
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:45,330
this princess title yourself?

80
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:51,210
I don't understand
what Your Highness is talking about.

81
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:53,610
You don't understand?

82
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,130
I'll make you understand soon enough.

83
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,720
Rest assured.

84
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,250
I won't harm you, the substitute, for now.

85
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Once I find the real Princess Fu Wei,

86
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,130
I'll settle accounts with you then.

87
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,760
Why would the real princess  send
a substitute for the marriage alliance?

88
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,880
Behind this,

89
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,200
is there a sinister conspiracy?

90
00:07:32,230 --> 00:07:33,990
The marriage alliance with Daqing,

91
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,270
the posthouse bandits,

92
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:36,930
the Mid-Autumn Festival
assassination attempt,

93
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:38,460
and the loan sharking case.

94
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:41,340
These matters seem unrelated,

95
00:07:42,140 --> 00:07:44,700
yet they're intricately connected.

96
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:47,170
Liang Feng.

97
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:48,970
Your Highness.

98
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,670
Go find the real Princess of Daqing.

99
00:07:50,670 --> 00:07:51,310
Huh?

100
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,050
Only by finding
the real Princess of Daqing

101
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,909
can we solve all these mysteries.

102
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:58,590
Yes.

103
00:08:00,690 --> 00:08:01,580
This way,

104
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,250
Fu Wei can truly be safe.

105
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:07,710
[Crown Prince's Mansion]

106
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,530
By order of the Crown Prince,

107
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,320
effective immediately,

108
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,180
Crown Princess,
you're confined to your chambers.

109
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,560
No one knows that I killed Fu Wei.

110
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:20,670
How could Li Shu suspect my identity?

111
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,900
I cannot sit and wait for my doom.

112
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,210
[Prince Yan's Mansion]

113
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Miss.

114
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,640
This Seven-Star Lamp
is an ancient divine object.

115
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:35,650
Using it to extend your life

116
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:37,679
may give you a chance of survival.

117
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,710
Are you ready?

118
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,130
Please.

119
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,120
In a moment,

120
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:49,080
you will lose your five senses.

121
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,450
Your Highness.

122
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:56,600
You must think this through carefully.

123
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
The life extension
through the Seven-Star Lamp

124
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:00,660
means two people will share one life,

125
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,480
and there's no turning back.

126
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:14,400
This girl has her heart set on you.

127
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,130
And you are in love with her too.

128
00:09:16,310 --> 00:09:17,590
If you want to save her,

129
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:19,890
you must bind your fates as one.

130
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,480
As long as she can live,

131
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,070
whatever the cost,

132
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:26,240
I am willing to pay it.

133
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:27,810
To save her,

134
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:30,500
you're willing to sacrifice
your own lifespan.

135
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:32,390
Does she know about this?

136
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,880
She doesn't need

137
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,040
to know this.

138
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,570
The laws of Yin and Yang.

139
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,600
The balance of the five elements.

140
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,920
Blood as the guide.

141
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:08,680
Soul as the bond.

142
00:10:30,050 --> 00:10:30,910
Your Highness.

143
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:33,000
From now on,

144
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:36,610
your fates will be bound together,

145
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,820
sharing life and death.

146
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:45,150
If your fate is too heavy to bear,

147
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,390
I will change your fate

148
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,720
for you.

[Crown Prince's Mansion]

150
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:44,520
I want to see

151
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:47,280
what the Crown Prince actually knows.

152
00:12:37,730 --> 00:12:38,650
Die!

Who are you?

155
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:04,640
You don't need to know who I am.

156
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:06,590
Do you remember

157
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,250
this token?

158
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,760
Let me go!

Why do you have this in your possession?

161
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,380
Speak!

162
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:19,870
You used the pretext of confiscating
property to dispatch your private army

163
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:21,200
into the Cui's Mansion,

164
00:13:21,370 --> 00:13:23,090
transferring money

165
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
and erasing all traces of the crime.

166
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:27,920
This token

167
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:32,730
is stained with the blood
of 48 members of my Cui family!

168
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,360
The Marquis of Zhenguo's Mansion?

169
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,520
Lord Cui?

170
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,600
When did I ever harm your family?

171
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,230
You don't need to explain to me.

172
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:45,460
Go make your explanation before them
in the underworld...

173
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,100
Enough.

174
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,090
Take him away

175
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,320
and interrogate him thoroughly.

176
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,930
I can't kill you,

177
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,400
but I won't be captured by you either.

What happened at this mansion tonight

181
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:23,740
must not be leaked.

182
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,160
Otherwise, you'll be killed without mercy.

183
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:27,540
Yes, Your Highness.

184
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,670
Yes, Your Highness.

185
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,690
Could the loan sharking case

186
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,010
actually be connected to the Crown Prince?

187
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,670
What secrets does the Crown Prince
really have?

188
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,750
Here.

189
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,500
The medicine is bitter,

190
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,700
so I brought you some preserved fruits.

191
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:35,460
Your hand is injured...

192
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,020
It's nothing,

193
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,960
just a minor scratch.

194
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:43,180
By the way,

195
00:15:43,210 --> 00:15:44,070
what are...

196
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,380
your plans

197
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,770
for the next step?

198
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:53,720
Everything

199
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,860
started because of the Princess.

200
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,530
In my previous life,

201
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:02,920
the Princess of Daqing
was killed within Yunrui's borders.

202
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,640
Daqing seized the opportunity to invade,

203
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,900
leading to years of war

204
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:08,690
and unbearable suffering for the people.

205
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,860
Although in this life,

206
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,220
the Princess escaped from the posthouse,

207
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:14,890
it seems that everything

208
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:17,340
hasn't really changed at all.

209
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,770
So

210
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,220
the Princess of Daqing

211
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,510
cannot fall into anyone else's hands.

212
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,560
It seems Your Highness

213
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,610
has already begun investigating.

214
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,820
Your Highness.

215
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:33,540
Lieutenant Liang sent a message

216
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,940
that the Princess of Daqing
has been found.

217
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:01,760
Your Highness,

218
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:03,220
there's a secret message.

219
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:08,470
[Prince Yan has found
Princess of Daqing's whereabouts]

220
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,849
The Princess of Daqing has been found.

221
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,790
[The Crown Prince and Prince Yan
have found the real princess]

222
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,280
The show

223
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,700
begins now.
