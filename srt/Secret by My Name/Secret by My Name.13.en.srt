1
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,579
(This Zhao Rou did not come
with good intentions.)

2
00:00:18,099 --> 00:00:20,259
(What exactly
is her purpose behind all this?)

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,619
(I need to find a way)

4
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:23,899
(to use force against force.)

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,699
Miss Mary, Ms. Li is busy right now.

6
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:27,179
None of you is stopping me today.

7
00:00:27,180 --> 00:00:30,059
I want to see for myself
whether anyone still runs Tan Group at all.

8
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,738
I already told you today.

9
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:33,618
I must get this batch of goods.

10
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,540
(Here comes the force.)

11
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:35,499
One day late,

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,539
and my charity gala
cannot afford the delay.

13
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,459
But your delivery cycle is next Friday.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:42,820
And you did not send us
an email in advance.

15
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:45,379
Miss Mary.

16
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,058
Your company's order

17
00:00:47,059 --> 00:00:49,659
clearly states delivery is next Friday.

18
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,578
What do you mean

19
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:52,658
by making a scene now?

20
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,018
What is written on the order

21
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,860
is the final delivery date.

22
00:00:55,939 --> 00:00:56,739
But

23
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,179
I need this batch today
to meet my performance target.

24
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:00,579
Tan Group

25
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,019
cannot deliver it?

26
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,539
What does Miss Mary take

27
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:06,259
Tan Group Design Department for?

28
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:09,258
You may use
all your connections to ask around.

29
00:01:09,259 --> 00:01:10,939
If today even our Design Department

30
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,579
cannot deliver this,

31
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:17,539
then I would like to see which company
in the market dares to take this order.

32
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,780
What?

33
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:19,899
Does Tan Group

34
00:01:19,900 --> 00:01:22,459
not treat its diamond clients as gods?

35
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:23,939
Of course.

36
00:01:25,499 --> 00:01:27,140
At any time,

37
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,939
Tan Group always puts
customer demands first.

38
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,579
You are?

39
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,659
I am the Vice Chairman of the Board.

40
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:33,860
Zhao Rou.

41
00:01:35,979 --> 00:01:36,739
Hello.

42
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:38,099
From today onward,

43
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,659
my subordinate
will liaise with Miss Mary.

44
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,140
Designer Li.

45
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:43,980
Suspend all business activities.

46
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,900
From today onward,
Miss Mary will not be seeing her again.

47
00:01:48,059 --> 00:01:48,900
This way, please.

48
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,579
Fine.

49
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:05,859
=Secret By My Name=

50
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,639
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

51
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,459
=Episode 13=
Shujing.

52
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,659
=Episode 13=
That client just now

53
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,498
seems to be a diamond level VIP.

54
00:02:11,499 --> 00:02:14,099
It's fine. None of you need to get involved.

55
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:15,920
Why don't you go and apologize,

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,600
personally lead everyone
to work overtime and rush it?

57
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,450
Even if it still can't be finished in time,
at least it saves face for them.

58
00:02:20,499 --> 00:02:22,778
Otherwise, Vice Chairman Zhao
just took office,

59
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,379
and she'll probably
come after you first.

60
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,179
(This is exactly what I was waiting for,
for her to light this fire.)

61
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,020
(So I won't be caught off guard.)

62
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,240
Why don't I apologize on your behalf?

63
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,979
After all, they're our diamond VIP.

64
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:35,618
Today the client
changed the schedule at will,

65
00:02:35,619 --> 00:02:36,780
and we put up with it.

66
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:38,760
Then tomorrow or the day after,
if they keep pushing

67
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:41,120
to cut Tan Group's design fees,
what are we supposed to do?

68
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,459
Endless concessions

69
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,859
will only make them push further,

70
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,340
trampling over our bottom line.

71
00:02:45,819 --> 00:02:46,939
None of you need to interfere.

72
00:02:47,060 --> 00:02:48,790
If anything happens,
I'll take responsibility.

73
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,060
Alright.

74
00:02:51,059 --> 00:02:52,058
Designer Li really does

75
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,020
take full responsibility alone.

76
00:02:54,539 --> 00:02:56,938
If I hadn't arrived in time today,

77
00:02:56,939 --> 00:02:58,058
Tan Group would have

78
00:02:58,059 --> 00:03:00,580
lost a diamond level VIP outright.

79
00:03:00,662 --> 00:03:02,370
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)

80
00:03:05,762 --> 00:03:07,082
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)

81
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:18,659
What does you mean by this?

82
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,379
Is this killing one to warn a hundred,

83
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,618
using me as an example?

84
00:03:21,619 --> 00:03:23,379
Such a perfect opportunity,

85
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,460
of course.

86
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:26,139
I hereby announce

87
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:28,939
that Designer Li
has been dismissed by the company.

88
00:03:30,339 --> 00:03:32,580
I just spoke
with Miss Mary on the phone,

89
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:34,400
and she explained
the full background of the matter.

90
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,259
Li Shujing.

91
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,500
Effective today,

92
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:37,780
you are reassigned to the factory

93
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,500
to retrain and relearn operations.

94
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,338
Designer Li has already been dismissed.
There is no need for her to go to the factory.

95
00:03:45,339 --> 00:03:46,259
First,

96
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,498
this is a compromise proposed
by Miss Mary.

97
00:03:48,499 --> 00:03:50,259
She suggested that Li Shujing

98
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:52,699
be sent to the factory
to correct her professional discipline.

99
00:03:53,059 --> 00:03:53,859
Second,

100
00:03:54,219 --> 00:03:55,460
Tan Group

101
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,098
does not punish its own people

102
00:03:57,099 --> 00:03:58,579
to appease a client.

103
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,459
But Li Shujing...

104
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,859
Ms. Zhao, I think you have spent
too many years in the overseas division.

105
00:04:02,099 --> 00:04:04,020
You are back now, yet you
no longer protect your own people.

106
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,220
Who would still be willing
to work for you like that?

107
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,659
It seems

108
00:04:14,779 --> 00:04:16,539
my record at Tan Group

109
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:18,600
(Personal Resume. Li Shujing)
will need a few more lines added again.

110
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,580
Clear all this junk

111
00:04:28,659 --> 00:04:29,979
out of my sight.

112
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:33,745
I am sorry.

113
00:04:36,779 --> 00:04:38,099
This bag

114
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,380
is yours.

115
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,619
Consider it a parting gift.

116
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:44,940
Do not come in tomorrow.

117
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,599
This cup

118
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,507
might as well be used
as Li Shujing's urn.

119
00:04:56,419 --> 00:04:58,499
If anyone touches
a single sheet of paper here again,

120
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,739
I will have her clutch
her resignation letter

121
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,220
and walk into the incinerator.

122
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,780
Mr. Tan,

123
00:05:05,859 --> 00:05:07,780
why are you so angry?

124
00:05:08,219 --> 00:05:09,979
You care so much about Li Shujing,

125
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:12,340
yet she does not seem grateful at all.

126
00:05:13,099 --> 00:05:14,940
This has nothing to do
with Ms. Zhao, does it?

127
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,499
It does not concern me.

128
00:05:19,179 --> 00:05:20,738
But once Li Shujing

129
00:05:20,739 --> 00:05:22,380
is sent to Chuangyang Factory,

130
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,340
she becomes my responsibility.

131
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,179
Tell me,

132
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:28,499
will it be a production accident,

133
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,260
or a falling load of steel?

134
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,780
Then you had better pray she survives.

135
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:38,299
Otherwise, I promise
every strand of your hair

136
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,340
will end up in the machines.

137
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:44,259
You frightened me.

138
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:45,700
Mr. Tan.

139
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,419
I played along pretty well, didn't I?

140
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,949
Designer Li,

141
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:06,349
now that you have what you wanted,

142
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,257
don't forget next spring's designs...

143
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,419
The New Spring Collection.

144
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,778
Across the entire market,

145
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,299
I will work exclusively on your project.

146
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:20,260
Designer Li is refreshingly decisive.

147
00:06:20,539 --> 00:06:21,658
However,

148
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:23,499
there is one thing I am curious about.

149
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:26,580
A designer
with an overseas background like you,

150
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,859
why insist on going
to that rundown factory?

151
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,499
Mr. Tan,

152
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,380
you seem quite free lately.

153
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:47,020
You even have time

154
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,738
to reminisce with me.

155
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:51,499
Ms. Zhao was thriving overseas.

156
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,900
Why not stay on some island
enjoying the sunshine,

157
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,700
and instead rush back home?

158
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,580
As for me,

159
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,179
a man with time to spare,

160
00:07:00,859 --> 00:07:01,939
I'm interested in buying in.

161
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,940
I wonder
if Ms. Zhao would be interested.

162
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,819
As for my appetite,

163
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,099
it is quite large.

164
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:10,979
I am willing to take on any game.

165
00:07:11,099 --> 00:07:12,820
I just wonder

166
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,659
whether you have
any impressive leverage to offer.

167
00:07:17,859 --> 00:07:19,940
If Ms. Zhao returned

168
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:21,820
to push Tan Jianfei out,

169
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,220
then my hand

170
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,260
is more than strong enough.

171
00:07:29,739 --> 00:07:31,979
Right now the brothers are at odds.

172
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:33,699
But when the time comes,

173
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,020
you will surely
band together for profit again.

174
00:07:36,837 --> 00:07:39,032
I am not playing along with that.

175
00:07:47,020 --> 00:07:49,299
(Still hoping to squeeze money
out of the overseas division.)

176
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,298
(Those overseas messes,)

177
00:07:51,299 --> 00:07:52,819
(I still want you brothers)

178
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,619
(to hurry up and plug those holes.)

179
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:13,082
(Tan Group Textile Mill.
Fabric Dyeing Plant)

180
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,499
This side is done already.

181
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,260
Spread that out more. Lay it flat.

182
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:37,738
Hello.

183
00:08:37,739 --> 00:08:39,219
Are you Master Zhao?

184
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,820
Doesn't this look a bit uneven?

185
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:44,339
Neither Chairman Tan
nor Young Chairman Tan showed up.

186
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,458
Why did they send
an unfamiliar woman instead?

187
00:08:46,459 --> 00:08:48,420
Probably just here to go
through the motions.

188
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,259
The color of this batch of fabric

189
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,658
comes out differently every time.

190
00:08:52,659 --> 00:08:54,820
There is always
a color deviation from the sample.

191
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,580
It is very hard
to pass customer inspection.

192
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,339
Chuangyang Factory focuses
on handmade customization

193
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:09,099
and intangible heritage plant dyeing.

194
00:09:09,659 --> 00:09:12,700
The oxidation time and condition of the dye
determine how the color develops.

195
00:09:12,939 --> 00:09:16,538
With today's lighting,
temperature, and humidity,

196
00:09:16,539 --> 00:09:18,779
the oxidation time should be extended
by two more minutes.

197
00:09:18,939 --> 00:09:21,060
Humidity should be controlled
at fifty percent.

198
00:09:21,299 --> 00:09:23,240
Only then can you ensure
that every batch of fabric

199
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,940
comes out with consistent color.

200
00:09:25,659 --> 00:09:26,899
Are you sure?

201
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:30,698
If handmade intangible heritage fabrics
are to be produced steadily

202
00:09:30,699 --> 00:09:31,820
for the market,

203
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:33,658
relying solely on passed down experience

204
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:35,019
is simply not enough.

205
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:37,940
You have to extract
scientific patterns from it.

206
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:15,538
That will do.

207
00:11:15,539 --> 00:11:16,538
Two dye immersions,

208
00:11:16,539 --> 00:11:18,499
with oxidation time
and humidity properly controlled.

209
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,779
This is the final product.

210
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,540
The color looks perfect.

211
00:11:22,659 --> 00:11:24,259
It matches the sample exactly.

212
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:26,538
Do you still think I came here

213
00:11:26,539 --> 00:11:27,899
just to go through the motions?

214
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,619
From today on,

215
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,178
follow the oxidation schedule

216
00:11:32,179 --> 00:11:33,940
I provided, strictly.

217
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,940
For every shade lighter
in future bulk orders,

218
00:11:37,059 --> 00:11:39,340
one zero will be deducted
from your year end bonus.

219
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,418
This young woman is impressive.

220
00:11:41,419 --> 00:11:42,940
Yes, absolutely.

221
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:49,298
(Such defective fabric...)

222
00:11:49,299 --> 00:11:50,499
(Why does it look exactly like)

223
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,739
(the batch that got
my father convicted back then?)

224
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,379
(Coming to the fabric mill
was the right move.)

225
00:11:56,539 --> 00:11:58,460
(What on earth is being hidden here?)

226
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,578
(I have to get to the bottom of it.)

227
00:12:00,579 --> 00:12:04,139
(That batch of fabric back then,
who handled it before it became defective?)

228
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:10,139
Finally done.

229
00:12:16,419 --> 00:12:17,979
How are you adjusting to the factory?

230
00:12:21,020 --> 00:12:23,099
I'm asking you now as the chairman.

231
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,540
I'm doing just fine at the factory.

232
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:27,619
No need for you to worry, Mr. Tan.

233
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:28,779
Is that all?

234
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,979
Your health isn't good.

235
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:35,619
Traditional dyeing here
is heavy manual work.

236
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,379
You really need to rest more.

237
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:42,379
Mr. Tan has learned
how to care about people now?

238
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,940
When you burned that videotape,

239
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,220
did you ever think I might suffocate?

240
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,499
If I told you

241
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,099
I burned the tape to protect you,

242
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,779
could you believe me just once?

243
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:56,899
Zhao Rou suddenly parachuted in

244
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,259
and started targeting you here.

245
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,538
I still haven't figured out

246
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:00,859
what she's really after.

247
00:13:01,299 --> 00:13:02,578
You must stay alert.

248
00:13:02,579 --> 00:13:03,460
Do you understand?

249
00:13:03,939 --> 00:13:06,820
Are you afraid I'll see that videotape,

250
00:13:07,179 --> 00:13:09,619
take revenge on you,
and drag you down with me?

251
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:13,339
If you're not prepared

252
00:13:13,340 --> 00:13:15,220
to go to hell with me,

253
00:13:15,939 --> 00:13:17,540
then stay away from me.

254
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,220
Tan Jianfei,

255
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,580
if you dare interfere
with my business again,

256
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:24,019
I'll rip out your heart

257
00:13:24,459 --> 00:13:26,979
and make it kneel in repentance
at my father's grave.

258
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,000
Then what were we before?

259
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,779
A lapse you gave into
while still clear headed?

260
00:13:32,699 --> 00:13:33,658
Did you ever once think

261
00:13:33,659 --> 00:13:35,220
of standing shoulder
to shoulder with me?

262
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,460
Tan Jianfei.

263
00:13:36,819 --> 00:13:38,619
This is my final warning to you.

264
00:13:39,260 --> 00:13:40,540
Stay away from me.

265
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,859
The more you hide from me,

266
00:13:43,659 --> 00:13:44,859
the more I will hate you.

267
00:13:53,462 --> 00:13:54,074
Shujing.

268
00:13:54,075 --> 00:13:54,932
