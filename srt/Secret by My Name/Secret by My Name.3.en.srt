They gave up on you.

What do you think?

00:02:15,324 --> 00:02:16,325
I do not believe it.

00:02:17,764 --> 00:02:19,364

(Have I really done something wrong?)

33
00:03:57,164 --> 00:03:59,284
That winter down jacket
supply chain tied to Wang Jinkai,

34
00:03:59,285 --> 00:04:00,900
we still have not
secured the authorization?

35
00:04:02,084 --> 00:04:03,285
It is strange.

36
00:04:03,445 --> 00:04:04,564
For some reason,

37
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,285
Jianfei is unusually strict
about this segment.

38
00:04:08,005 --> 00:04:10,483
But for the spring and summer supply chain,
he has loosened up.

39
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:11,644
The profits are not low either.

40
00:04:11,965 --> 00:04:12,803
No.

41
00:04:12,804 --> 00:04:14,644
We have to secure the winter line.

42
00:04:15,005 --> 00:04:16,964
Do not forget what you promised me.

43
00:04:18,644 --> 00:04:19,565
Shujing.

44
00:04:20,084 --> 00:04:21,165
Do not worry.

45
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:23,723
What I promised you,

46
00:04:23,724 --> 00:04:25,484
I will deliver.

47
00:04:27,445 --> 00:04:28,564
But we still need

48
00:04:28,565 --> 00:04:29,724
to take this step by step.

49
00:04:33,284 --> 00:04:34,765
I was too impatient.

50
00:04:37,724 --> 00:04:39,125
Are you free this afternoon?

51
00:04:40,005 --> 00:04:41,885
Once this is settled,

52
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:43,724
let us go see a movie.

53
00:04:44,964 --> 00:04:45,724
No.

54
00:04:46,245 --> 00:04:47,484
I have a debt to collect.

55
00:04:49,644 --> 00:04:51,044
Wang Jinkai

56
00:04:51,284 --> 00:04:53,644
still has not paid enough interest.

57
00:05:00,485 --> 00:05:01,885
Are you done packing yet?

58
00:05:02,844 --> 00:05:03,924
It is just a trip abroad.

59
00:05:03,925 --> 00:05:05,323
Why are you in such a hurry?

60
00:05:05,324 --> 00:05:06,244
You have no idea.

61
00:05:06,245 --> 00:05:07,084
Move.

62
00:05:12,885 --> 00:05:14,365
Do you have everything?

63
00:05:18,164 --> 00:05:19,365
Why are you here?

64
00:05:20,045 --> 00:05:22,445
I brought Mrs. Wang to see you off.

65
00:05:28,084 --> 00:05:29,124
You are shameless.

66
00:05:29,125 --> 00:05:31,005
So everything she said was true.

67
00:05:31,204 --> 00:05:33,885
You are really leaving
your family behind for this woman.

68
00:05:35,844 --> 00:05:37,044
That bag of yours,

69
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:38,885
it is full of cash, is it not?

70
00:05:39,425 --> 00:05:40,924
Mr. Wang, your bank accounts are frozen,

71
00:05:40,925 --> 00:05:42,844
yet you still managed
to carry this much cash.

72
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:45,124
Are you planning to take this lady

73
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,804
and live it up somewhere else?

74
00:05:46,805 --> 00:05:49,524
Mr. Wang, you really are resourceful.

75
00:05:50,284 --> 00:05:51,765
Take this woman and leave.

76
00:05:52,365 --> 00:05:54,325
But the money in the bag stays here.

77
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,004
- What are you doing?
- I still have a child to raise.

78
00:05:57,005 --> 00:05:59,084
You. Get out of the way!

79
00:06:00,964 --> 00:06:01,763
Li Shujing.

80
00:06:01,764 --> 00:06:03,325
I will kill you.

81
00:06:28,204 --> 00:06:29,404
Miss,

82
00:06:29,724 --> 00:06:30,924
are you really sure

83
00:06:30,925 --> 00:06:32,884
you want to spend your life

84
00:06:32,885 --> 00:06:34,205
with a bankrupt old man like this?

85
00:06:34,605 --> 00:06:35,724
I...

86
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:39,684
Wang Jinkai,

87
00:06:39,685 --> 00:06:40,723
listen carefully.

88
00:06:40,724 --> 00:06:42,163
Consider this money our severance.

89
00:06:42,164 --> 00:06:43,765
Do not come looking for me again.

90
00:06:44,084 --> 00:06:44,643
Lan...

91
00:06:44,644 --> 00:06:45,843
I still have money.

92
00:06:45,844 --> 00:06:46,203
I...

93
00:06:46,204 --> 00:06:47,484
I have plenty.

94
00:06:47,485 --> 00:06:49,325
You still have money for other women?

95
00:06:49,485 --> 00:06:51,083
That money belongs to me and the child.

96
00:06:51,084 --> 00:06:52,404
- Mine.
- It is all mine.

97
00:06:52,605 --> 00:06:54,205
- It is my money.
- Mine.

98
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,323
Mine.

99
00:06:55,324 --> 00:06:56,724
- Give it back.
- That is mine.

100
00:06:59,964 --> 00:07:01,524
Mr. Wang, do not rush.

101
00:07:01,565 --> 00:07:03,724
The real show has only just begun.

102
00:07:04,445 --> 00:07:05,765
What you are owed,

103
00:07:06,084 --> 00:07:08,125
I have not finished paying yet.

104
00:07:08,404 --> 00:07:10,164
From today onward,

105
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:12,445
you are nothing but a stray.

106
00:07:40,164 --> 00:07:42,005
Ms. Li's technique at taking things

107
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:44,284
is far less sharp than it was back then,

108
00:07:44,324 --> 00:07:45,365
when you undid my belt.

109
00:07:47,324 --> 00:07:49,284
Young Chairman Tan
really knows how to joke.

110
00:07:49,605 --> 00:07:50,723
I am only here to retrieve

111
00:07:50,724 --> 00:07:53,125
the competency assessment materials
Mr. Wang misplaced.

112
00:07:53,524 --> 00:07:54,925
The Group never said

113
00:07:55,605 --> 00:07:57,164
that a design director

114
00:07:57,805 --> 00:07:59,685
was expected to do petty theft.

115
00:08:00,964 --> 00:08:03,365
Then it seems Young Chairman Tan
should promote me.

116
00:08:04,005 --> 00:08:05,964
After all, what I cut away for you

117
00:08:06,245 --> 00:08:08,524
was not just a piece of moldy lining,

118
00:08:08,925 --> 00:08:11,325
but an entire
supply chain rotten to the core.

119
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:12,963
Why not hand me

120
00:08:12,964 --> 00:08:14,644
the Asia Pacific
fabric procurement rights?

121
00:08:14,964 --> 00:08:16,925
I guarantee the summer collection

122
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,724
will use only Class A materials
safe even for infants.

123
00:08:24,485 --> 00:08:25,885
Or we could strike a deal.

124
00:08:26,245 --> 00:08:27,524
You cancel the engagement

125
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,164
with Tan Zuoyan,

126
00:08:29,805 --> 00:08:31,404
and I will give you a diamond mine.

127
00:08:31,685 --> 00:08:33,200
After all, marrying into the Tan family,

128
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,480
is that not about gaining something
sharp enough to cut deep?

129
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:37,444
Young Chairman Tan,
you are seriously undervaluing

130
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:39,244
what a strategic marriage is worth.

131
00:08:39,404 --> 00:08:41,565
The token your brother gave me

132
00:08:41,804 --> 00:08:43,724
is far sharper than any diamond.

133
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,004
Besides,

134
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,525
your brother and I are truly in love.

135
00:08:56,404 --> 00:08:57,484

00:08:57,524 --> 00:08:59,084
