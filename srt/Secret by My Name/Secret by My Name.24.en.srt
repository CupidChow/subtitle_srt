1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,118
The Li family patents

2
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:07,999
are the last batch

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,880
of key patents
that need to be transferred.

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:12,119
Chairman Tan has been waiting for this.

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,439
Give me a little more time.

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,038
I didn't expect Li Shujing's father

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:18,240
to leave a safeguard before he died.

8
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:20,079
To transfer the full patent rights,

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:22,240
it requires Li Shujing's
personal signature.

10
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,560
Chairman Tan said

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:25,359
you won't disappoint him.

12
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,040
Right.

13
00:00:26,319 --> 00:00:27,519
I won't disappoint him.

14
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,638
I'm useful.

15
00:00:28,639 --> 00:00:29,478
Please make sure

16
00:00:29,479 --> 00:00:30,998
you tell my father that.

17
00:00:30,999 --> 00:00:31,840
And also,

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,318
you have tomorrow's flight details.

19
00:00:33,319 --> 00:00:33,879
Could you...

20
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,240
Mr. Tan, don't rush.

21
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,479
Once the job is done,

22
00:00:37,599 --> 00:00:38,639
there will be

23
00:00:38,679 --> 00:00:40,240
a seat for you on that plane.

24
00:00:43,599 --> 00:00:44,598
I just...

25
00:00:44,599 --> 00:00:45,919
Assistant Zhou, I mean no disrespect.

26
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,799
I just want

27
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,240
to talk to my father.

28
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:50,719
I can't reach him right now,

29
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,080
and it's making me uneasy.

30
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:52,959
You will...

31
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,199
You'll take me with you, right?

32
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,679
Don't forget, Mr. Tan,

33
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,399
you are his son.

34
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,200
Yes.

35
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:01,279
We're father and son.

36
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,560
We're father and son.

37
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:05,800
Father

38
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:07,399
won't abandon me.

39
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:11,199
I'll finish the task.

40
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:22,759
=Secret By My Name=

41
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:24,469
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

42
00:01:24,470 --> 00:01:27,577
=Episode 24=

43
00:01:52,879 --> 00:01:53,880
Miss Lin,

44
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,640
get ready for the gates of hell to open.

45
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:59,160
You sound pretty pleased, Mr. Tan.

46
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,238
Just watched a mad dog

47
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,959
get beaten down.

48
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,319
Felt satisfying, didn't it?

49
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,199
Not very fair of you though,

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,160
enjoying the show
while leaving us waiting.

51
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,959
It is worth the wait.

52
00:02:10,079 --> 00:02:11,399
And here it is.

53
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,119
It's done.

54
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,719
Finally over.

55
00:02:23,007 --> 00:02:24,007
(Yusheng)

56
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,399
(I'm pretty impressive, right?)

57
00:02:32,639 --> 00:02:33,640
Uncle Tan.

58
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:34,919
Let's talk.

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,277
(Century-old Distillery)

60
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:38,678
Since

61
00:02:38,679 --> 00:02:40,479
you managed to find me,

62
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:41,600
a conversation seems fair.

63
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,279
Otherwise,

64
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,360
we may

65
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,879
never meet again.

66
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:46,920
Never again?

67
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:50,800
You stole other people's futures.

68
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:52,399
You still think you get one?

69
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:56,040
So, Miss Li,

70
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,839
you still have another move?

71
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,238
I'm all ears.

72
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,520
All these years,

73
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,240
I keep dreaming of that day.

74
00:03:04,679 --> 00:03:07,119
My father is hanging
in the center of the living room.

75
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,398
My mother, half-mad,

76
00:03:08,399 --> 00:03:09,920
is hammering at the piano.

77
00:03:10,119 --> 00:03:12,200
It was the birthday gift
my father gave me.

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,279
Every note is burned into my memory.

79
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,800
My mother kept repeating,

80
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,290
B-flat.

81
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,360
The seventh key.

82
00:03:22,839 --> 00:03:25,360
Only blood makes it sound right.

83
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,594
All this crazy talk,

84
00:03:28,595 --> 00:03:30,116
what's the point?

85
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:33,080
At first, I thought it was nonsense too.

86
00:03:33,559 --> 00:03:34,958
That's why all these years,

87
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:37,200
I never really questioned
what my mother said.

88
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,399
Until I saw Yusheng die.

89
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,879
That pool of blood,

90
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,959
was red like fire,

91
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:49,360
as vivid as my worst nightmare.

92
00:03:52,559 --> 00:03:54,080
I still don't understand

93
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,398
all this nonsense.

94
00:03:55,399 --> 00:03:56,879
Back then, when our family developed

95
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,520
that new fabric,

96
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,439
everyone said the patent was fake.

97
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:04,080
But what was the truth?

98
00:04:05,119 --> 00:04:06,959
You know it better than anyone.

99
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,077
(Clothing Design Patent Certificate)

100
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,480
The seventh setting.

101
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,639
Contaminated with blood.

102
00:04:24,559 --> 00:04:25,678
I checked the maintenance logs

103
00:04:25,679 --> 00:04:27,079
at the Chuangyang factory.

104
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,318
That machine's parameter settings

105
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,238
line up exactly

106
00:04:30,239 --> 00:04:32,040
with the critical seventh step.

107
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,960
And the person who altered that machine

108
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,999
and signed the log was you.

109
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:40,879
Tan Zheng'en.

110
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,519
You killed my father.

111
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,720
You destroyed my family.

112
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,480
A thief who stole patents.

113
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,280
A murderer.

114
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,720
Do you think you can walk away?

115
00:04:58,920 --> 00:04:59,759
Fine.

116
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,639
Then let's gamble.

117
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,079
Let's see

118
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,559
who heaven decides
to stand with in the end.

119
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,319
But I'm not a gambler.

120
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:10,600
Tan Zheng'en.

121
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,600
My father is watching you right now.

122
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,040
Waiting for you to pay for your sins.

123
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:24,720
Uncle Tan.

124
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,590
Take care of yourself.

125
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,599
Hello.

126
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:55,879
How is it on your end?

127
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,558
The police are already there.

128
00:05:57,559 --> 00:05:58,719
Tan Zheng'en won't be flying.

129
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,639
I'll pick you up.

130
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,040
Okay.

131
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:03,960
What happened?

132
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,102
Are you hurt?

133
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:06,540
Send me your location.

134
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,600
I'm fine.

135
00:06:07,657 --> 00:06:09,136
Just got my hand caught.

136
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:10,800
See you soon.

137
00:06:55,119 --> 00:06:56,240
Tan Zuoyan.

138
00:07:01,439 --> 00:07:02,800
All of this…

139
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:08,319
is finally coming to an end.

140
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,759
You never imagined the ending...

141
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,720
would look like this, did you?

142
00:07:22,799 --> 00:07:24,280
What are you trying to do?

143
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:31,519
This is all because of you.

144
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,079
I was abandoned because of you.

145
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,399
Because of you,

146
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,759
I became

147
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:40,040
nothing.

148
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:42,720
It's all your fault.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,879
I couldn't even be a dog anymore.

150
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:51,240
Not even that.

151
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,920
So tell me.

152
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,160
What do you think I want?

153
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:04,439
Tan Zheng'en never planned
to take you with him.

154
00:08:05,799 --> 00:08:07,439
He couldn't even save himself.

155
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:11,840
Liar!

156
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,360
Then come to hell with me.

157
00:08:18,439 --> 00:08:20,519
If you die, so will Tan Jianfei!

158
00:08:21,640 --> 00:08:23,199
I can already picture it.

159
00:08:23,439 --> 00:08:25,840
I can see his face the moment

160
00:08:26,095 --> 00:08:27,639
he's standing over your body.

161
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,159
Let me go.

162
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,360
It'll be perfect.

163
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,160
Absolutely perfect.

164
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:36,079
Perfect!

165
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:49,279
Where do you think you're going?

166
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,240
Tan Jianfei is already on his way.

167
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,799
- What if he can't find you
- Let me go.

168
00:08:55,439 --> 00:08:57,119
How should I kill you

169
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,320
so it hurts him the most?

170
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:02,119
Let me go.

171
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,639
Let me go!

172
00:09:03,719 --> 00:09:05,200
I'm not Tan Zuoyan!

173
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,759
I'm a dog.

174
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,360
Just a dog!

175
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:11,999
All my life,

176
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,359
I've never won once.

177
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,720
But this time,

178
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,519
I won!

179
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,519
The dog finally won!

180
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:40,039
Stop it.

181
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:41,958
You'll beat him to death!

182
00:09:41,959 --> 00:09:43,440
Tan Jianfei!

183
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,560
I almost lost you.

184
00:09:52,799 --> 00:09:53,960
Don't leave me.

185
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,119
Even if it's hell,

186
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,119
I'll go with you.

187
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,119
You're holding me too tight.

188
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:04,399
I can't breathe.

189
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,279
This time,

190
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,279
I'll never let you go again.

191
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:14,560
Then remember

192
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,615
to tie a bow.
