1
00:00:31,187 --> 00:00:33,487
Director Li's on boarding ceremony
is quite memorable.

2
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,727
Do you need me to show you
how to erase the records completely?

3
00:00:47,147 --> 00:00:48,407
You despicable fool.

4
00:00:48,427 --> 00:00:49,807
Where did you hide it?

5
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:56,206
Young Chairman Tan's way
of saying good morning

6
00:00:56,546 --> 00:00:57,807
is quite distinctive as well.

7
00:00:58,986 --> 00:01:00,966
You failed
to capture the bacon and eggs,

8
00:01:01,147 --> 00:01:04,087
but you did record your own people
installing the GPS the wrong way around.

9
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:08,087
Would you like me to enroll them
in a technical training course?

10
00:01:09,387 --> 00:01:10,167
Hello?

11
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:12,567
Tan Fijian sent you, didn't he?

12
00:01:13,347 --> 00:01:15,007
No.

13
00:01:21,547 --> 00:01:22,526
Li Shujing.

14
00:01:23,707 --> 00:01:26,007
The Tan Group is not
your playground for revenge.

15
00:01:30,507 --> 00:01:32,465
Do you believe I could send you back

16
00:01:32,466 --> 00:01:33,927
to that rainy night you crawled out of?

17
00:01:35,466 --> 00:01:37,160
So early in the morning,
Young Chairman Tan,

18
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,966
and already in such a temper?

19
00:01:40,226 --> 00:01:42,807
Are you afraid
I will take your president's chair,

20
00:01:43,067 --> 00:01:45,046
or are you afraid I will take your

21
00:01:45,946 --> 00:01:47,126
heartbeat?

22
00:01:50,867 --> 00:01:54,346
Li Shujing. Do you really think the Tan Group
is scrap fabric for you to cut at will?

23
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,146
You are being far too naive right now.

24
00:01:56,147 --> 00:01:58,207
Is Young Chairman Tan
showing concern for me?

25
00:01:58,466 --> 00:02:00,647
Is it possible that
I am concerned about you as well?

26
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:03,207
After all, everything I am doing

27
00:02:03,386 --> 00:02:04,626
is to help you clear out

28
00:02:04,627 --> 00:02:06,207
those stubborn old men on the board.

29
00:02:07,106 --> 00:02:08,326
That way,

30
00:02:09,946 --> 00:02:12,246
I can help the Tan Group

31
00:02:13,826 --> 00:02:15,366
set aside a thicker reserve

32
00:02:15,667 --> 00:02:17,127
for what lies ahead.

33
00:02:19,107 --> 00:02:20,167
Li Shujing.

34
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,727
I am not interested in playing
mind games with you anymore.

35
00:02:23,746 --> 00:02:24,727
This scar

36
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:26,206
has hurt me for eight years.

37
00:02:26,627 --> 00:02:28,740
I do not believe there is nothing
of me left in your heart.

38
00:02:29,346 --> 00:02:31,146
I believe there is still
a way for us to go back...

39
00:02:31,147 --> 00:02:31,967
Shujing,

40
00:02:32,066 --> 00:02:33,407
I am back from my trip.

41
00:02:38,147 --> 00:02:39,167
Jianfei.

42
00:02:41,186 --> 00:02:42,326
Zuoyan.

43
00:02:42,346 --> 00:02:44,366
Young Chairman Tan
came to see me for a chat,

44
00:02:45,267 --> 00:02:47,567
and to offer a bit of business advice.

45
00:02:52,947 --> 00:02:54,247
Let me formally introduce her.

46
00:02:54,586 --> 00:02:55,646
Li Shujing.

47
00:02:55,707 --> 00:02:57,185
A fashion designer,

48
00:02:57,186 --> 00:02:58,326
and also my

49
00:03:00,186 --> 00:03:01,247
fiancee.

50
00:03:10,547 --> 00:03:11,447
Hello.

51
00:03:13,306 --> 00:03:15,127
We are family now.

52
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:30,459
=Secret By My Name=

53
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,425
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

54
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,275
=Episode 2=

55
00:03:44,987 --> 00:03:46,687
How did you and my brother meet again?

56
00:03:46,827 --> 00:03:47,847
At a gathering.

57
00:03:47,947 --> 00:03:48,806
Really?

58
00:03:49,707 --> 00:03:50,886
Then why did I hear

59
00:03:51,066 --> 00:03:52,527
it was a traffic accident?

60
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,646
You must be mistaken.

61
00:03:58,746 --> 00:03:59,866
Come to my office later.

62
00:03:59,867 --> 00:04:00,146
We...

63
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,567
Sorry, Young Chairman Tan.

64
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:03,326
I still have work to finish.

65
00:04:14,667 --> 00:04:16,826
That was an easy bluff,
and you gave it away.

66
00:04:16,827 --> 00:04:17,847
Looks like

67
00:04:18,107 --> 00:04:19,967
there really is no feeling
between you and him.

68
00:04:22,347 --> 00:04:23,606
Qian.

69
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,686
Look at how you drew this waistline.

70
00:04:28,587 --> 00:04:30,087
It has no structure at all.

71
00:04:30,467 --> 00:04:32,366
Come to my office tonight.

72
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,767
I will show you step by step
how it should be done.

73
00:04:36,746 --> 00:04:39,126
Should Mr. Wang's
lesson be livestreamed?

74
00:04:39,347 --> 00:04:41,287
It would be perfect for the board to see

75
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:43,745
how you used substandard materials
as an excuse

76
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:45,560
to block the Autumn Winter Alpine fabrics,

77
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,840
then turned around and approved
twenty tons of inferior cotton

78
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:48,967
for the childrenswear line.

79
00:04:50,626 --> 00:04:51,606
Get out.

80
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,167
Li Shujing, you...

81
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:58,226
I am blocking it.

82
00:04:58,227 --> 00:04:59,226
Yes, I am.

83
00:04:59,227 --> 00:05:00,527
And what can you do about it?

84
00:05:01,946 --> 00:05:04,065
If you have the courage,
take it up with the dead.

85
00:05:04,066 --> 00:05:07,385
Or what, do you want me to go with you
and pay a visit to your father's coffin?

86
00:05:07,386 --> 00:05:09,366
Mr. Wang, you really
have a sharp sense of humor.

87
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:11,446
What you just tore up

88
00:05:11,706 --> 00:05:14,400
was a special rebate list from the supplier.

89
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,280
So tell me,
do these baby garment threads,

90
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,760
with formaldehyde far above the limit,

91
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,327
destroy a child's lungs first,

92
00:05:19,587 --> 00:05:22,346
or do they ruin the tires on the luxury car
you bought with kickbacks?

93
00:05:22,347 --> 00:05:23,527
I am warning you.

94
00:05:24,027 --> 00:05:24,986
Here,

95
00:05:24,987 --> 00:05:27,185
do not casually accuse

96
00:05:27,186 --> 00:05:28,906
a veteran of the Tan Group.

97
00:05:28,907 --> 00:05:30,527
You could be sued for defamation.

98
00:05:31,987 --> 00:05:34,647
Whether it is defamation or not,
you know that best yourself.

99
00:05:36,186 --> 00:05:39,006
Approve the application now,

100
00:05:39,266 --> 00:05:40,305
and I might overlook

101
00:05:40,306 --> 00:05:42,287
the price of the watch on your wrist,

102
00:05:43,186 --> 00:05:44,466
which happens to equal

103
00:05:44,467 --> 00:05:47,126
the amount you cut
from the childrenswear safety budget.

104
00:05:51,587 --> 00:05:52,566
Li Shujing.

105
00:05:52,706 --> 00:05:54,287
You think you are impressive?

106
00:05:54,347 --> 00:05:55,666
This batch of fabric,

107
00:05:55,667 --> 00:05:57,407
I will not approve it.

108
00:05:57,626 --> 00:05:59,806
Just wait for
the Autumn Alpine line to collapse.

109
00:06:00,347 --> 00:06:01,606
I want to see

110
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:04,486
whether you can still stay
at the Tan Group.

111
00:06:07,027 --> 00:06:08,006
Just wait.

112
00:06:14,987 --> 00:06:16,287
How is the investigation going?

113
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,446
To get rid of him,

114
00:06:18,626 --> 00:06:20,767
we will need something much heavier.

115
00:06:30,146 --> 00:06:31,926
My brother really
is generous with his trust.

116
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:35,305
Leaving someone like you

117
00:06:35,306 --> 00:06:36,527
working alone late at night,

118
00:06:36,987 --> 00:06:38,866
without worrying
you might sneak into storage,

119
00:06:38,867 --> 00:06:39,825
find some rope,

120
00:06:39,826 --> 00:06:41,767
and tie a neat bow for him as well.

121
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,527
If Young Chairman Tan
misses the past that much,

122
00:06:45,587 --> 00:06:46,505
why not take me now,

123
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:48,527
somewhere your brother could never find?

124
00:06:49,987 --> 00:06:51,207
This time,

125
00:06:51,467 --> 00:06:53,366
I would make sure it is tighter,

126
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,327
so you would never

127
00:06:55,667 --> 00:06:56,806
get away again.

128
00:06:56,946 --> 00:06:58,967
You almost made that sound tempting.

129
00:07:09,066 --> 00:07:11,825
Shujing. If you were working late,
you should have told me earlier.

130
00:07:11,826 --> 00:07:13,327
Staying up this late
is not good for you.

131
00:07:14,066 --> 00:07:15,145
I stopped by the florist,

132
00:07:15,146 --> 00:07:16,446
and got held up a bit.

133
00:07:17,467 --> 00:07:18,446
Do you like them?

134
00:07:21,946 --> 00:07:24,366
Looks like my brother
does not know Shujing at all.

135
00:07:24,467 --> 00:07:26,006
She does not like flowers.

136
00:07:26,306 --> 00:07:26,866
She likes...

137
00:07:26,867 --> 00:07:28,167
I used not to.

138
00:07:28,787 --> 00:07:29,967
Now I do.

139
00:07:34,587 --> 00:07:35,486
Jianfei,

140
00:07:36,467 --> 00:07:37,566
what are you

141
00:07:37,667 --> 00:07:38,647
doing here?

142
00:07:38,706 --> 00:07:40,686
I came to discuss with Shujing

143
00:07:42,347 --> 00:07:43,366
how to deal with

144
00:07:43,667 --> 00:07:44,806
some old things.

145
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:48,207
Jianfei,

146
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:50,185
you have not changed,

147
00:07:50,186 --> 00:07:51,366
still joking around.

148
00:07:52,306 --> 00:07:53,407
But,

149
00:07:55,706 --> 00:07:57,926
this parking lot at two in the morning

150
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:00,207
is not the place for catching up.

151
00:08:02,347 --> 00:08:03,046
Alright.

152
00:08:03,146 --> 00:08:04,906
It is time for you to go home.

153
00:08:04,907 --> 00:08:06,606
Your brother and I should leave as well.

154
00:08:08,946 --> 00:08:09,847
Excuse us.

155
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,207
(Li Shujing)

156
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:22,446
(I want to see)

157
00:08:22,706 --> 00:08:24,366
(how long this act can really last.)

158
00:08:33,186 --> 00:08:34,167
So?

159
00:08:34,227 --> 00:08:35,185
This piece of evidence,

160
00:08:35,186 --> 00:08:36,207
is it big enough?

161
00:08:37,306 --> 00:08:39,745
Not bad, kid. You actually dug this up.

162
00:08:39,746 --> 00:08:41,527
I am warning you,
do not get physical with me.

163
00:08:41,827 --> 00:08:43,046
Well done.

164
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:50,767
(Wang Jinkai.)

165
00:08:51,307 --> 00:08:52,446
(Eight years.)

166
00:08:53,146 --> 00:08:55,086
(The debt you owe the Li family)

167
00:08:55,467 --> 00:08:57,966
(is long overdue,
and interest must now be paid in blood.)

168
00:08:58,812 --> 00:09:01,586
(Tan Group)

169
00:09:01,587 --> 00:09:04,407
Mr. Wang's so called thermal technology
is quite remarkable.

170
00:09:06,067 --> 00:09:07,545
Every gram of filling inside

171
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:10,206
exceeds radiation limits
by one hundred and twenty seven times.

172
00:09:10,266 --> 00:09:12,367
A number that happens
to match your son's birthday.

173
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:14,887
I have no idea
what you are talking about.

174
00:09:15,706 --> 00:09:17,346
Ten years ago,
you were still on your knees

175
00:09:17,347 --> 00:09:18,745
begging me for mercy,

176
00:09:18,746 --> 00:09:20,846
and now you are trying
to look respectable.

177
00:09:21,107 --> 00:09:22,265
Everyone knows

178
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:24,767
what kind of intentions
you brought with you into the Tan Group.

179
00:09:28,827 --> 00:09:30,625
I also have records of your foolish son

180
00:09:30,626 --> 00:09:32,806
making deals with suppliers
of substandard materials.

181
00:09:34,426 --> 00:09:36,446
Shall we circulate them
for everyone to see?

182
00:09:38,707 --> 00:09:41,440
You and your son went to great lengths
to siphon money from the Tan Group,

183
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,946
reckless and malicious to the core.

184
00:09:42,947 --> 00:09:45,326
But this is no longer
a simple matter of kickbacks.

185
00:09:46,827 --> 00:09:47,745
Would you like

186
00:09:47,746 --> 00:09:48,665
me to explain

187
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:50,887
how serious crimes
endangering public safety can be?

188
00:09:55,187 --> 00:09:56,025
Fei.

189
00:09:56,026 --> 00:09:57,905
I have devoted years
of my life to the Tan Group,

190
00:09:57,906 --> 00:10:00,167
risking everything for it.

191
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:01,846
How could I possibly do such a thing?

192
00:10:02,146 --> 00:10:02,887
Right?

193
00:10:04,026 --> 00:10:06,127
Once this matter is exposed,

194
00:10:06,187 --> 00:10:08,167
the impact on the Tan Group

195
00:10:08,626 --> 00:10:09,846
would be devastating.

196
00:10:10,187 --> 00:10:11,046
So,

197
00:10:11,187 --> 00:10:12,846
this cannot be resolved so easily.

198
00:10:17,347 --> 00:10:19,025
So the two of you planned this together

199
00:10:19,026 --> 00:10:20,247
to set me up?

200
00:10:20,746 --> 00:10:21,607
Enough.

201
00:10:21,707 --> 00:10:22,745
Take Wang Jinkai away.

202
00:10:22,746 --> 00:10:24,247
Handle him according to procedure.

203
00:10:25,827 --> 00:10:27,706
This entire batch
must be destroyed immediately.

204
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:28,966
None of it can enter the market.

205
00:10:29,227 --> 00:10:30,106
No, Fei...

206
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:30,826
Fei, you...

207
00:10:30,827 --> 00:10:32,206
You cannot do this.

208
00:10:32,347 --> 00:10:33,385
My brother is unconscious,

209
00:10:33,386 --> 00:10:34,966
the company is unstable.

210
00:10:35,227 --> 00:10:35,946
And there is more.

211
00:10:35,947 --> 00:10:36,785
This woman

212
00:10:36,786 --> 00:10:38,446
forged my brother's recordings.

213
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:43,046
She forced her way into the Tan Group,
and her intentions are obvious.

214
00:10:43,107 --> 00:10:44,127
Get up.

215
00:10:44,386 --> 00:10:45,025
Let me tell you,

216
00:10:45,026 --> 00:10:45,706
Li Shujing,

217
00:10:45,707 --> 00:10:47,926
you are finished at the Tan Group.

218
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,367
You dare hit me?

219
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:03,686
Tan Zuoyan.

220
00:11:03,947 --> 00:11:04,745
Li Shujing.

221
00:11:04,746 --> 00:11:06,226
The two of you will pay for this!

222
00:11:06,227 --> 00:11:07,046
Move.

223
00:11:07,786 --> 00:11:08,346
Do not move.

224
00:11:08,347 --> 00:11:09,527
My apologies, everyone.

225
00:11:09,746 --> 00:11:11,846
I truly could not
tolerate someone like that

226
00:11:12,227 --> 00:11:13,926
making such accusations against my

227
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,167
fiancee.
