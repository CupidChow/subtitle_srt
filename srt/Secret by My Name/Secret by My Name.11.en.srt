(Tan Group Flagship Store
Building Collapse Incident Report)

2
00:00:33,579 --> 00:00:34,618
(Eight years ago.)

3
00:00:34,619 --> 00:00:36,779
(It happened
at the exact time my father died.)

4
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,779
(And Tan Group never disclosed
this incident to the public.)

5
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:41,899
(All news, reports, and records)

6
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,619
(were deliberately erased.)

7
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:46,699
(Not even in the shareholders' meeting archives
is there any trace of it.)

8
00:00:47,379 --> 00:00:49,339
(What exactly were they trying to hide?)

9
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,500
Help me look into something.

10
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,899
The Tan Group flagship store
collapse from eight years ago.

11
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:19,939
You're still up this late?

12
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:26,060
If you run into any trouble,

13
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:27,739
you should tell me.

14
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:29,060
As long as you speak up,

15
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:30,780
I'll do everything I can for you.

16
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,140
Then wire me some money.

17
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,739
Let's start with

18
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,860
ten billion.

19
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,819
I'm joking.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:46,739
Didn't realize you were that rich.

21
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:55,420
Don't work yourself too hard lately.

22
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:56,860
Get some rest.

23
00:02:06,187 --> 00:02:08,019
(Liang Yusheng, I found
the former flagship store manager)

24
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:08,939
Who is it?

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,019
(I found
the former flagship store manager.)

26
00:02:14,619 --> 00:02:15,819
Little boy.

=Episode 11=

30
00:02:55,539 --> 00:02:57,180
Long time no see, Uncle Zhao.

31
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,740
Do you remember me?

32
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:07,379
I'm Li Zhengzhi's daughter.

33
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,099
I don't know you.

34
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,900
Leave now.

35
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,139
Uncle Zhao.

36
00:03:13,779 --> 00:03:15,859
I came today to hear a story.

37
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:18,300
Do you still remember, eight years ago,

38
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,740
the Tan Group flagship store collapse?

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,659
A lot of people died in that accident.

40
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,778
Don't push me.

41
00:03:30,779 --> 00:03:31,979
Leave. Now.

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,740
What are you trying to do, Uncle Zhao?

43
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,379
Send me to meet my father?

44
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:42,819
You remember this photo, don't you?

45
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:47,539
Aren't they all your friends?

46
00:03:50,339 --> 00:03:51,500
Uncle Zhao,

47
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,299
if you want to live in peace,

48
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,379
don't carry debts on your back.

49
00:04:15,539 --> 00:04:16,539
(Dad.)

50
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:19,460
(I'm about to clear your name.)

51
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:44,220
Tan Jianfei, stop right there!

52
00:04:49,419 --> 00:04:50,739
Tan Jianfei!

53
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,260
Give it back to me!

54
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,978
Let go of me!

55
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,260
Let go of me!

56
00:05:26,299 --> 00:05:28,059
You call this your secret?

57
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,380
Tan Jianfei.

58
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,699
Do you have any idea

59
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,539
how much it took for me

60
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,859
to get this evidence?

61
00:05:43,350 --> 00:05:44,349
Shujing.

62
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:48,460
So as long as someone stands
in the way of your revenge,

63
00:05:49,419 --> 00:05:51,619
you'll kick them aside
without hesitation?

64
00:05:54,979 --> 00:05:56,460
I was the fool.

65
00:05:58,099 --> 00:06:00,299
For ever trusting someone
with the surname Tan.

66
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,940
Tan Jianfei.

67
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:12,820
Don't make me hate you even more.

and his shop, search again.

102
