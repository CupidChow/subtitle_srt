1
00:00:09,312 --> 00:00:11,713
Get everyone from Tan Zuoyan's department
together right now.

2
00:00:11,832 --> 00:00:14,312
Call an emergency meeting
for the Autumn Winter Alpine Collection.

3
00:00:14,313 --> 00:00:15,033
You!

4
00:00:17,633 --> 00:00:18,633
So, are you going

5
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,473
or not?

6
00:00:24,193 --> 00:00:25,112
Just so you know,

7
00:00:25,913 --> 00:00:28,233
there are plenty of people
eyeing this project.

8
00:00:29,393 --> 00:00:30,673
Alright, Zuoyan.

9
00:00:30,992 --> 00:00:32,311
Just focus on your work for now.

10
00:00:32,312 --> 00:00:33,632
Work comes first.

11
00:00:36,432 --> 00:00:37,673
I'll do whatever you say.

12
00:00:50,632 --> 00:00:52,073
Where did he touch you?

13
00:00:52,233 --> 00:00:52,912
Here?

14
00:00:53,153 --> 00:00:53,833
Here?

15
00:00:54,272 --> 00:00:55,233
Or here?

16
00:00:55,592 --> 00:00:57,952
Li Shujing. What exactly are you trying to do?

17
00:00:59,153 --> 00:01:00,272
What is it?

18
00:01:00,873 --> 00:01:03,233
I'm Zuoyan's fiancée.

19
00:01:03,553 --> 00:01:04,991
Isn't the wedding

20
00:01:04,992 --> 00:01:06,833
something we have to prepare for
sooner or later?

21
00:01:07,153 --> 00:01:09,272
I know exactly
what is really going on between you two.

22
00:01:09,312 --> 00:01:11,032
Does telling this lie
even mean anything?

23
00:01:12,432 --> 00:01:13,993
This could be a lie,

24
00:01:14,072 --> 00:01:15,513
or it could be the truth.

25
00:01:16,193 --> 00:01:17,433
Why not

26
00:01:17,553 --> 00:01:19,832
give me everything I want?

27
00:01:20,152 --> 00:01:21,513
Can you do that?

28
00:01:23,792 --> 00:01:25,552
If you can,

29
00:01:25,872 --> 00:01:27,153
I promise,

30
00:01:27,553 --> 00:01:28,752
at the wedding,

31
00:01:29,352 --> 00:01:31,032
I'll wear only the shackles you gave me.

32
00:01:37,393 --> 00:01:37,912
Didn't you

33
00:01:37,913 --> 00:01:40,073
want to put these shackles on me
eight years ago?

34
00:01:42,953 --> 00:01:45,752
Now you're the one wearing them,

35
00:01:46,913 --> 00:01:49,472
while watching me walk the red carpet

36
00:01:51,792 --> 00:01:53,273
over the Tan Group's ruin.

37
00:01:54,753 --> 00:01:55,913
You want to play with fire?

38
00:01:57,792 --> 00:01:59,032
I can burn the entire Tan Group

39
00:01:59,033 --> 00:02:00,433
into your bridal chamber.

40
00:02:01,072 --> 00:02:02,192
But remember,

41
00:02:03,352 --> 00:02:04,952
the ones locked in these flames

42
00:02:05,512 --> 00:02:07,392
will only be two dead people,
you and me.

43
00:02:26,912 --> 00:02:28,379
=Secret By My Name=

44
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,192
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

45
00:02:30,193 --> 00:02:31,111
=Episode 5=
You little shorty,

46
00:02:31,112 --> 00:02:32,951
=Episode 5=
why are you picking a fight with me?

47
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:34,353
You grew taller but not any smarter.

48
00:02:34,353 --> 00:02:36,320
Playing deaf and mute
with me every single day, are you?

49
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,592
Who are you calling brainless?

50
00:02:37,593 --> 00:02:39,111
Li Shujing, are you out of your mind?

51
00:02:39,112 --> 00:02:40,472
Who are you calling crazy?

52
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:41,391
Lin Xi, listen.

53
00:02:41,392 --> 00:02:43,032
Stop playing innocent.

54
00:02:43,033 --> 00:02:45,200
You only got where you are
by being Tan Jianfei's living seal.

55
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,073
Do you really think
you are the Group's lucky charm now?

56
00:02:47,232 --> 00:02:48,032
Miss Li.

57
00:02:48,033 --> 00:02:49,160
How noble you must be.

58
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:51,192
With trash drafts like this,
you are worse than a third-rate designer,

59
00:02:51,193 --> 00:02:52,511
and you're trying to apply
for a top-level patent?

60
00:02:52,512 --> 00:02:53,872
Do you really think Tan Group
belongs to your family?

61
00:02:53,873 --> 00:02:55,992
I will ask one last time.
Are you signing this or not?

62
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,032
I am not signing it. No!

63
00:02:58,033 --> 00:02:59,600
Even if Tan Jianfei comes,
I'm not signing.

64
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:00,992
Sign it or do not, I do not care.

65
00:03:23,193 --> 00:03:25,593
Li Shujing is a madwoman!

66
00:03:26,392 --> 00:03:27,552
Tan Jianfei.

67
00:03:27,713 --> 00:03:29,231
So this is the kind of crazy woman

68
00:03:29,232 --> 00:03:30,800
you rejected my engagement
for back then?

69
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:33,392
Is it interesting?

70
00:03:34,993 --> 00:03:37,672
That crazy woman treats me
like a live target.

71
00:03:37,713 --> 00:03:39,473
And you call this interesting?

72
00:03:39,753 --> 00:03:41,872
Do you still want me
to do this project for you?

73
00:03:41,913 --> 00:03:43,593
The project is yours.

74
00:03:44,232 --> 00:03:46,313
But I am quite interested
in watching this show.

75
00:03:47,392 --> 00:03:48,793
Let me remind you of one thing.

76
00:03:49,512 --> 00:03:50,633
Li Shujing

77
00:03:51,153 --> 00:03:52,832
is not someone to mess with.

78
00:03:53,072 --> 00:03:54,432
Tan Jianfei.

79
00:03:54,512 --> 00:03:57,032
Are you using me
to deal with Li Shujing,

80
00:03:57,033 --> 00:03:59,272
or throwing me out there
for her to shoot at?

81
00:03:59,473 --> 00:04:01,593
What exactly is going on
with this project?

82
00:04:04,512 --> 00:04:05,312
Hang in there.

83
00:04:05,313 --> 00:04:05,952
Hang...

84
00:04:08,753 --> 00:04:09,593
Hey!

85
00:04:11,232 --> 00:04:12,392
Please move.

86
00:04:13,832 --> 00:04:15,272
Tan Jianfei!

87
00:04:15,753 --> 00:04:17,432
Hang in there, my foot!

88
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:20,353
It makes me so mad!

89
00:04:20,353 --> 00:04:22,431
That woman launched
a charity collaboration and took away

90
00:04:22,432 --> 00:04:24,233
seventy percent of our pre-sales.

91
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,713
She monopolizes fabric suppliers
under the banner of charity.

92
00:04:26,752 --> 00:04:28,833
The whole industry is siding with her.

93
00:04:29,033 --> 00:04:30,231
Even the board is pressuring me.

94
00:04:30,232 --> 00:04:32,280
They force me to halt
the Autumn Winter Alpine project.

95
00:04:32,513 --> 00:04:37,393
Tan Jianfei went all out
just to keep me away from this project.

96
00:04:41,153 --> 00:04:42,273
This is infuriating.

97
00:04:42,593 --> 00:04:43,872
Calm down.

98
00:04:43,913 --> 00:04:45,191
Her so-called ethical business

99
00:04:45,192 --> 00:04:46,432
is far from spotless.

100
00:04:49,073 --> 00:04:49,913
Look.

101
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:51,632
The rural factories she partners with

102
00:04:51,633 --> 00:04:53,032
cannot meet production at all.

103
00:04:53,033 --> 00:04:54,551
Those so-called handwoven textiles

104
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,300
(Revealing the Fraud Behind the Rural
Poverty-Relief Weaving Factory)

105
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:55,551
(and the Shell-Company Shareholding Structure)

106
00:04:55,552 --> 00:04:57,111
are actually mass-produced goods

107
00:04:57,112 --> 00:04:59,033
repackaged from overseas factories.

108
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:00,992
Hold on.

109
00:05:02,225 --> 00:05:04,332
(Xijie Apparel Legal Representative:
Tan Jianfei 75%)

110
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:06,849
This company's legal representative...

111
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,582
(Xijie Apparel Legal Representative:
Tan Jianfei 75%)

112
00:05:09,033 --> 00:05:10,311
This is a shell company

113
00:05:10,312 --> 00:05:11,992
controlled by Tan Jianfei.

114
00:05:13,992 --> 00:05:17,473
Lin Xi is claiming the moral high ground
to clean up Tan Group's image.

115
00:05:19,073 --> 00:05:20,832
Send all this to the media immediately.

116
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,231
There is more.

117
00:05:22,232 --> 00:05:25,833
The so-called poverty relief workshop
in her promo shut down two years ago.

118
00:05:26,913 --> 00:05:29,040
We can find a few former workers
and put them on camera.

119
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:32,072
We will tear apart her
carefully crafted charity image.

120
00:05:32,232 --> 00:05:33,632
Even so,

121
00:05:34,153 --> 00:05:35,231
we still cannot

122
00:05:35,232 --> 00:05:36,992
reclaim the Autumn Winter Alpine project.

123
00:05:37,552 --> 00:05:38,472
And we may be facing

124
00:05:38,473 --> 00:05:40,153
an even fiercer backlash from them.

125
00:05:42,192 --> 00:05:43,752
The top priority now

126
00:05:44,273 --> 00:05:46,793
is to find her weakness
as soon as possible.

127
00:06:04,352 --> 00:06:05,632
She drew this family portrait

128
00:06:06,073 --> 00:06:07,872
when she was seven.

129
00:06:08,393 --> 00:06:10,672
She didn't finish the old man's face.

130
00:06:11,432 --> 00:06:13,273
Do you think she already sensed

131
00:06:13,953 --> 00:06:15,552
that Tan Group would one day

132
00:06:15,633 --> 00:06:17,233
drive her family to ruin?

133
00:06:24,513 --> 00:06:25,512
You still love

134
00:06:25,752 --> 00:06:28,072
digging through old trash,

135
00:06:28,232 --> 00:06:29,551
just like you did

136
00:06:29,552 --> 00:06:31,473
when you stole her diary back then.

137
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:35,033
You were the one who said

138
00:06:35,633 --> 00:06:37,593
Shujing would marry me one day,

139
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:39,473
and I had to protect her.

140
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:41,872
Now you say
you want to marry her yourself.

141
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:45,593
Zuoyan,

142
00:06:46,752 --> 00:06:48,393
your acting is terrible.

143
00:06:48,872 --> 00:06:50,473
A performance this clumsy

144
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:52,353
will not last very long.

145
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,432
Well,

146
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,112
people change.

147
00:07:03,552 --> 00:07:04,552
Back then,

148
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:07,751
the old man was set on
making me inherit Tan Group.

149
00:07:07,752 --> 00:07:09,072
But what happened later?

150
00:07:10,273 --> 00:07:11,473
He changed.

151
00:07:12,312 --> 00:07:13,833
Shujing changed too.

152
00:07:16,273 --> 00:07:17,791
She will not love you anymore.

153
00:07:17,792 --> 00:07:19,472
She will marry me,

154
00:07:19,473 --> 00:07:21,473
and the one who protects her will be me.

155
00:07:22,552 --> 00:07:23,832
The way you protect her

156
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,820
is by turning her into
a sacrifice of the Tan family.

157
00:07:25,872 --> 00:07:27,512
Do you even know what you are doing?

158
00:07:28,312 --> 00:07:29,872
If she were to find out

159
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:32,072
that you do not carry Tan blood at all,

160
00:07:32,352 --> 00:07:33,952
do you think she would stay with you?

161
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,913
Do you think she cares about that?

162
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,272
She has known everything
for a long time.

163
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:40,552
And yet she still chose to marry me. Why?

164
00:07:40,633 --> 00:07:41,351
Because only I can.

165
00:07:41,352 --> 00:07:42,752
Only me.

166
00:07:43,192 --> 00:07:45,512
I am the only one
who can give her what she wants most.

167
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,432
What you want most is nothing more than
what little the Tan family has left.

168
00:07:59,552 --> 00:08:00,952
What Shujing wants

169
00:08:00,953 --> 00:08:02,871
is for the entire Tan family
to be wiped out.

170
00:08:02,872 --> 00:08:04,192
-And me... -And you.

171
00:08:04,672 --> 00:08:06,351
The bloodline of the Tan family
she hates most

172
00:08:06,352 --> 00:08:08,793
is flowing through your veins.

173
00:08:10,393 --> 00:08:11,393
Jianfei,

174
00:08:11,473 --> 00:08:13,033
every time you touch her,

175
00:08:13,073 --> 00:08:15,312
what do you feel?

176
00:08:15,552 --> 00:08:18,992
Is it her warmth,

177
00:08:19,752 --> 00:08:23,153
or the rough feel of the rope
your father used to strangle her father?

178
00:08:56,873 --> 00:08:59,071
Li Shujing, I can't stand you anymore.

179
00:08:59,072 --> 00:09:00,632
You asked me out and still showed up

180
00:09:01,113 --> 00:09:01,792
late...

181
00:09:04,113 --> 00:09:05,112
Who are you?

182
00:09:05,113 --> 00:09:06,193
Where is Li Shujing?

183
00:09:15,353 --> 00:09:17,193
Mr. Tan,

184
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:19,473
you don't look like

the Wild Lemon you forced into my mouth
when we were eighteen?

00:09:31,072 --> 00:09:33,433
So are you pretending to be drunk?

190
00:09:35,233 --> 00:09:36,872
Too bad you are this wasted,

191
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:40,353
you cannot even mix a proper drink.

when you bit into my collarbone

sounded far more honest.

Tan Jianfei,

201
00:10:08,113 --> 00:10:08,912
why do you always

202
00:10:08,913 --> 00:10:10,872
act like the victim?
