Tell me why.

5
00:00:25,340 --> 00:00:26,779
A businessperson's promise

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,419
must be exchanged for
something of value.

7
00:00:28,739 --> 00:00:30,380
So what do you have tonight?

8
00:00:30,459 --> 00:00:32,259
So you had planned this all along.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,220

10
00:00:35,619 --> 00:00:36,899
to lure me in.

will you always stay with me?

but market fluctuations
aren't something we can control.

97
00:07:03,339 --> 00:07:05,940
Besides, their overseas division
does have serious problems.

98
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,520

to be hiding such a huge trouble.

end up appearing at Tan Group?

your engagement to Tan Jianfei

108
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:34,940
was called off long ago, wasn't it?

109
00:07:35,339 --> 00:07:37,499
So, why keep helping Tan Group
suppress the news?

110
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,340
Who else is backing you?

111
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,979

Is she inside? Bring her out to see me.

130
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,298
You can't go in.

131
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,298

- Okay.

If you want her to help you,

139
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,979
I'm afraid you'll have to go to a crossroads
and burn a few stacks of joss paper.

140
00:08:55,659 --> 00:08:57,660
What exactly did you want Zhao Rou
to help you with?

141
00:08:58,340 --> 00:08:59,779
Maybe I can help you.

142
00:09:00,319 --> 00:09:01,899
You're saying
that your sister, Zhou Jing,

died in the flagship store

144

never paid the full compensation?

Yes.

146

00:09:14,659 --> 00:09:16,178
But judging from the account,

151
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,019
Tan Group's operations
aren't in bad shape.

152
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,580
How could there be large-scale layoffs?

153
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,300
I'm telling the truth.

154

at first.

156

that it'd take a long time
to go through the procedures.

157
