1
00:00:14,060 --> 00:00:15,100
No wonder.

2
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:17,320
You were so determined
to take the Autumn Season project.

3
00:00:17,860 --> 00:00:18,840
Turns out all of this

4
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,419
is evidence of them passing off
inferior goods as premium ones.

5
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:33,579
This is bad.
They're setting the place on fire.

6
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:39,460
They've already found us.

7
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,539
They're not just trying
to destroy the evidence.

8
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:42,139
They want...

9
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:43,220
They want us silenced.

10
00:00:45,019 --> 00:00:45,979
You go first.

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,978
Even if I die here today,

12
00:00:47,979 --> 00:00:49,540
I won't drag you down with me.

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,899
Li Shujing, are you out of your mind?

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:54,579
Move. Now.

15
00:01:05,659 --> 00:01:06,339
Hello?

16
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:07,540
Save us now.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:10,739
Shujing.

18
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,907
(Liang Yusheng)

Shujing.

22
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:49,099
=Episode 15=
You scared me half to death.

23
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:49,899
This is a hospital.

24
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:50,980
Stop shouting nonsense.

25
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,459
Mr. Tan, you're awake.

26
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:55,620
That's wonderful.

27
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,459
Last night, as you instructed,

28
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,179
I went to pick you and Designer Li up.

29
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:02,258
But then the moment I reached the factory gate,
it was already thick with smoke.

30
00:02:02,259 --> 00:02:03,338
You held your breath

31
00:02:03,339 --> 00:02:04,860
and dragged Designer Li out yourself.

32
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,739
I was already conscious
when the secretary arrived.

33
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,179
You were the one who passed out.

34
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:13,459
Dead weight. Heavy as a rock.

35
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,459
Yes.

36
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,859
You really terrified Designer Li.

37
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,379
She held onto you, crying and shouting.

38
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:20,680
Designer Li really has a stubborn mouth.

39
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:22,579
One second she says
she's cutting ties with me.

40
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,539
The next,

41
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:24,740
she's shedding tears for me.

42
00:02:25,619 --> 00:02:27,020
Who cried for you?

43
00:02:27,339 --> 00:02:29,300
Is it really that hard
to admit I matter to you?

44
00:02:29,779 --> 00:02:30,500
I...

45
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,820
Turns out I was treating you
heart to heart,

46
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,420
while you were playing
mind games with me.

47
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,979
No need to hide it from her.
We share information.

48
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:44,218
This is footage of Zhao Rou
outside the factory last night.

49
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:47,180
Once I found the two of you, I followed
the ambulance straight to the hospital.

50
00:02:47,539 --> 00:02:49,111
My car was left at the factory gate.

51
00:02:49,112 --> 00:02:50,707
Zhao Rou didn't know it was mine.

52
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:57,099
You're sloppy when you act.

53
00:02:57,499 --> 00:03:00,259
Why was this batch
in the warehouse discovered?

54
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,040
Destroy it immediately.

55
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,640
All records from the Overseas Division
related to money laundering transfers.

56
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,807
There cannot be
a single trace this time.

57
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:08,818
Do you hear me?

58
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,538
I hear you.

59
00:03:09,539 --> 00:03:10,300
Get out.

60
00:03:10,659 --> 00:03:11,740
So it really was her.

61
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:16,058
Zhao Rou's funds in the Overseas Division
ran into trouble.

62
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:18,259
She wanted to patch it up
with the accounts at home.

63
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,395
If I don't send her in
for a couple of years,

64
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,737
all her years of scheming
would go to waste.

65
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:26,180
Wait.

66
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:27,900
Give it a few days.

67
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,338
I'm afraid if she goes in now,

68
00:03:29,339 --> 00:03:31,379
she'll only confess
to the Overseas Division laundering.

69
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:35,618
I want her to say it herself first,

70
00:03:35,619 --> 00:03:37,300
the truth about the factory back then.

71
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,259
What would you two like to drink?

72
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,460
I've gotten used to overseas habits.

73
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,899
I'll have a Hawaiian bean.

74
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,299
Make it an Americano.

75
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,179
Pretentious.

76
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,218
And for this one,

77
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,819
just give her a cup of plain water.

78
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:52,139
She's a factory girl
headed back to the floor.

79
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,979
What taste would
a factory girl even have?

80
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,539
Ms. Zhao, do you think
you've already won?

81
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:03,259
Whether I control the domestic market

82
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:06,020
is not for a small fry
like you to decide.

83
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:08,180
Besides, you were the one
who asked me here today.

84
00:04:08,219 --> 00:04:09,098
What,

85
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:11,020
can't stand staying
at the factory anymore?

86
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,098
I asked Ms. Zhao here today
because I wanted to talk about

87
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:15,979
those overseas projects
of yours that lost money.

88
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,060
Trying to bluff me?

89
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:20,419
Who said my
overseas projects lost money?

90
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,738
If I were operating at a loss,

91
00:04:22,739 --> 00:04:26,299
would Tan Group
have parachuted me onto the board?

92
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,220
What a pity.

93
00:04:32,339 --> 00:04:34,259
(File folder)
I came today in good faith,

94
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:36,340
hoping to extend
an invitation to Ms. Zhao.

95
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,900
Thank you.

96
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,539
But since Ms. Zhao won't accept it,

97
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:47,140
I'll have to take this file

98
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:49,059
and ask someone else
to transfer me back.

99
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:51,120
(No way.)

100
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,659
(This can't be evidence.)

101
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,820
(I just had the traces wiped.)

102
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:56,340
(How could she...)

103
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,739
This cafe isn't bad.

104
00:05:03,299 --> 00:05:05,139
I don't care
what kind of made up nonsense

105
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,739
you claim is in that folder.

106
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,499
If you want to investigate,

107
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,580
go right ahead.

108
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:14,260
Let's see who actually dares to move.

109
00:05:16,419 --> 00:05:17,739
Very well then.

110
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,900
Ms. Zhao, take care.

111
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,020
Goodbye.

112
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:28,460
Take your time savoring

113
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,140
that Hawaiian coffee bean yourself.

114
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,140
Idiot.

115
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,900
How could you let them
get leverage on us?

116
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,560
Do I really have to step in myself
over something this small?

117
00:05:51,859 --> 00:05:53,220
Please don't be angry.

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,739
I don't think
she's actually found evidence.

119
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,419
I just got back to the country,

120
00:05:57,539 --> 00:05:58,338
after all.

121
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,299
People are bound to be suspicious.

122
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:02,380
Before tomorrow morning,

123
00:06:02,539 --> 00:06:05,020
I'll take care of the overseas accounts,
funds, and liabilities.

124
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,178
But if within three days

125
00:06:06,179 --> 00:06:08,140
anyone can still dig up evidence,

126
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,960
then after all these years
you've enjoyed yourself at the company,

127
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,500
it'll be time for you
to make a sacrifice.

128
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:19,739
(Who exactly is the mysterious person
behind Zhao Rou?)

129
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:28,460
Look, these recent dye jobs
are much better.

130
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,379
Yes, much better than before.
Just keep a closer eye on the timing.

131
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,619
Ms. Zhao, what brings you here?

132
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,939
Are you here to inspect the work?

133
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,658
Ms. Zhao. How did the batch of fabric
delivered today turn out?

134
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:37,659
No issues.

135
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,979
I was rotating through anyway,
so I came by to take a look.

136
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,059
That Li...

137
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:42,979
Rou Rou?

138
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,099
You're back from overseas?

139
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,098
Master Zhao, you're still working
at this factory and haven't retired yet?

140
00:06:50,099 --> 00:06:51,538
I told you long ago,

141
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:53,538
Zhao Rou from the Overseas Division
was trained by me.

142
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:54,380
Now tell me,

143
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:56,140
who still dares say I was bragging?

144
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:59,020
(I can't hide it anymore.)

145
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:01,859
(Li Shujing actually ran
into this old man.)

146
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:04,619
(My past is no longer a secret.)

147
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,939
Master Zhao,
please get back to your work.

148
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,658
I'm guessing Ms. Zhao came to see me

149
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:11,778
to discuss some new targets.

150
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:12,820
Alright.

151
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,380
You really don't hide
your hostility toward Tan Jianfei.

152
00:07:22,299 --> 00:07:23,460
What do you mean?

153
00:07:23,779 --> 00:07:25,940
Have you never considered

154
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:28,340
that men have pride too?

155
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:30,979
He also wants a woman's admiration,

156
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,380
and her approval.

157
00:07:33,739 --> 00:07:35,380
If you have something
to say, say it plainly.

158
00:07:35,437 --> 00:07:37,820
Tan Jianfei was shut down by you,

159
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,299
so of course I stepped in
to comfort him.

160
00:07:40,925 --> 00:07:42,778
Mr. Tan may not say it out loud,

161
00:07:42,779 --> 00:07:43,738
but deep down,

162
00:07:43,739 --> 00:07:46,380
he greatly admires someone like me
from the Overseas Division.

163
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,900
And of course,

164
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,340
he also thinks

165
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,739
I'm a woman who knows how to please.

166
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,579
Why are you here?
You should have told me earlier.

167
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:06,400
I wouldn't have asked
the secretary to pick me up.

168
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:07,858
You...

169
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,178
Are you heading home first,

170
00:08:09,179 --> 00:08:10,739
or going straight back to the company?

171
00:08:13,219 --> 00:08:14,499
Where do you want me to go?

172
00:08:16,219 --> 00:08:18,099
Since I left the executive level,

173
00:08:18,237 --> 00:08:20,870
have you been in frequent contact
with the Overseas Division?

174
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,099
What's wrong?

175
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,979
Did something happen?

176
00:08:29,219 --> 00:08:30,979
Didn't Zhao Rou go looking for you?

177
00:08:33,739 --> 00:08:35,739
She's far more considerate than I am.

178
00:08:36,859 --> 00:08:39,219
Whether it's in life or in work,

179
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,340
she knows exactly
how to meet your needs.

180
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:43,899
Well informed, and well mannered.

181
00:08:46,779 --> 00:08:47,779
Jealous?

182
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,379
Who's jealous?

183
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:52,099
What are you doing?

184
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,619
Tan Jianfei, this is a hospital.

185
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:55,899
And you still dare get jealous
over me and Zhao Rou?

186
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,899
I haven't even brought up
you and Liang Yusheng yet.

187
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,698
Are you crazy?
Liang Yusheng is my brother.

188
00:08:59,699 --> 00:09:01,658
What did you say?
"Liang Yusheng is my brother."

189
00:09:01,659 --> 00:09:03,619
Move. Someone's coming in.

190
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,660
Kiss me once and I'll go.

191
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:05,979
You've lost your mind.

192
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,680
If you don't kiss me, I'm not leaving.

193
00:09:07,779 --> 00:09:08,538
Tan Jianfei.

194
00:09:08,539 --> 00:09:09,420
Hurry up.

195
00:09:12,299 --> 00:09:13,180
One more.

196
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:14,739
Tan Jianfei, have you no shame?

197
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:15,420
Hurry.

198
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,578
Satisfied now?

199
00:09:17,579 --> 00:09:19,899
Then tell me, are you still going
to be jealous over Zhao Rou?

200
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:21,778
I'm telling you,

201
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,379
I wasn't jealous.

202
00:09:23,539 --> 00:09:24,420
That won't do either.

203
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,360
You should still be jealous
when you should.

204
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,698
Fine, jealous.

205
00:09:27,699 --> 00:09:28,619
