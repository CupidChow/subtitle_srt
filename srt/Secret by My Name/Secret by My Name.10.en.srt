1
00:00:11,779 --> 00:00:12,739
Shujing.

2
00:00:12,860 --> 00:00:15,000
It's four in the morning,
nonstop calls like this.

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,699
Do you think
I'm some kind of AI hotline?

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:18,339
Tan Zheng'en got away last night.

5
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:19,780
But don't worry about him yet.

6
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:21,139
Why not?

7
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,059
Go find someone named Zhao Youcai first.

8
00:00:23,259 --> 00:00:24,459
And do it fast.

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,059
Zhao Youcai?

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:31,980
Something feels

11
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,619
off.

12
00:00:44,737 --> 00:00:45,899
=Secret By My Name=

13
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:47,599
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,845
=Episode 10=

15
00:00:51,112 --> 00:00:52,220
(Termination Letter)

16
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,939
Back then, my father opened this bottle

17
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:03,060
to celebrate my seat on the board.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,899
Now it seems fitting to use it

19
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,019
(Termination Letter)

20
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:12,459
to mourn my loyalty.

21
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:15,459
Leave with some dignity.

22
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:17,819
Don't force me
to expose your dirty secrets.

23
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,459
Dignity?

24
00:01:20,619 --> 00:01:22,099
You mean like you,

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,099
kept on a leash by Li Shujing,

26
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:27,459
treated like a dog at her bedside,
yet calling it devotion?

27
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:29,340
And still bragging about love?

28
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:34,500
I'm warning you.

29
00:01:34,580 --> 00:01:36,860
Don't say her name
with that filthy mouth again.

30
00:01:37,499 --> 00:01:38,900
Stay away from her.

31
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,379
Sorry.

32
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,019
I'm sorry.

33
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:46,539
What a touching show

34
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:48,459
of loyalty and love.

35
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:52,258
Tell me, if she ever finds out
about what happened back then,

36
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,218
that you knew everything in advance,

37
00:01:54,219 --> 00:01:56,498
and even took part in it,

38
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:57,618
once she learns the truth,

39
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:59,459
do you think she would...

40
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,579
Do you think she would

41
00:02:00,979 --> 00:02:02,659
stab you herself?

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:03,980
I wasn't involved.

43
00:02:11,699 --> 00:02:13,099
That's something

44
00:02:13,619 --> 00:02:15,300
only you believe.

45
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,099
Pass this message to her for me.

46
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,379
That secret

47
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:23,939
hidden inside those bite marks

48
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,419
is enough for you two

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:28,379
to keep turning on
each other for a lifetime.

50
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,620
Dad.

51
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:46,379
You always said datura is poisonous.

52
00:02:46,619 --> 00:02:49,659
But without a bit of aggression,
how do you strike a snake at its weak spot?

53
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:51,419
Just wait.

54
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:54,659
Someone will come very soon

55
00:02:57,339 --> 00:02:58,580
to pay for their sins.

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:02:59,979
(Tan Zuoyan.)

57
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,340
(Li Shujing.)

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,819
(What are you planning to do next?)

59
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,379
(Dad.)

60
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,179
(That factory of yours back then)

61
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:22,060
(has now been rated as one of the city's
outstanding old industrial sites.)

62
00:03:22,339 --> 00:03:24,539
(Even though it's still
in the Tan family's hands,)

63
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:26,500
(I'll find a way)

64
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:28,460
(to take it back.)

65
00:03:34,819 --> 00:03:36,739
Zhao Youcai.

66
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:39,699
We should start
with the list of old factory sites.

67
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,579
Dragged out by Li Shujing
at four in the morning,

68
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:46,340
summoned and dismissed at will,

69
00:03:46,379 --> 00:03:47,739
and left me there alone.

70
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:48,538
Mr. Liang,

71
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,099
do you think that's appropriate?

72
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:53,259
(Nurses' Station)

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,938
Why are you waiting here for me?

74
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:57,579
If someone hears this,
they'll think I did something to you.

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:59,020
I don't care what people think.

76
00:03:59,659 --> 00:04:01,859
You've always had one foot in each camp,

77
00:04:02,339 --> 00:04:04,460
physically here, but loyal elsewhere.

78
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:05,579
So tell me.

79
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,979
Why did Li Shujing look for you?

80
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,979
Nothing.

81
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,938
She just asked
about her mother's recovery.

82
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:13,580
Her mom felt unwell early this morning.

83
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,139
Right.

84
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,139
You climb out of bed
at four and leaves me,

85
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:18,979
then feeds me

86
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,419
such a lousy excuse.

87
00:04:20,499 --> 00:04:21,579
Mr. Liang,

88
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,979
what exactly are we to each other?

89
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:24,979
Can't you
at least sweet-talk me a little?

90
00:04:32,739 --> 00:04:33,858
(Did Li Shujing)

91
00:04:33,859 --> 00:04:35,700
(stumble onto something crucial?)

92
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,820
(Is that why she rushed to verify it?)

93
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:40,380
(Should I tell the old man about this?)

94
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,179
Let me treat you to breakfast.

95
00:04:48,539 --> 00:04:50,099
At the hospital cafeteria?

96
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,819
If you don't feel like it...

97
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,340
I never said I wouldn't eat.

98
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,260
Let's go.

99
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,140
Surprised to see me?

100
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:19,538
We only just

101
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:21,580
ended our partnership not long ago.

102
00:05:21,739 --> 00:05:23,619
You've already lost across the board.

103
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,480
What leverage do you have
to negotiate with me?

104
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,380
You don't seriously think

105
00:05:31,419 --> 00:05:33,700
Tan Jianfei
is some kind of saint, do you?

106
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,538
You think he's told you

107
00:05:35,539 --> 00:05:36,780
everything?

108
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:39,939
You should clean up

109
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,859
your own mess first.

110
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,419
But next time,

111
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,658
if you dare touch my mother again...

112
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,979
Even once,

113
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,099
Ms. Li,

114
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:53,619
will you kneel and beg me again?

115
00:05:55,299 --> 00:05:56,619
You're insane.

116
00:05:58,020 --> 00:05:58,940
Li Shujing.

117
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,140
Li Shujing.

118
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,459
Consider this

119
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,820
my farewell gift to you.

120
00:06:15,139 --> 00:06:16,920
Gossip and scandal
are everyone's favorite pastime.

121
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,619
Who doesn't love talking

122
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:22,340
about a woman accused of loose morals?

123
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:25,579
(Tan Group executives entangled in chaos)
Tan Group executives entangled in chaos,

124
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,979
truly disgraceful.

125
00:06:31,299 --> 00:06:32,019
The Tan Group

126
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:34,539
has no need for a director
with moral stains.

127
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,619
Li Shujing, get out of the Tan Group.

128
00:06:40,339 --> 00:06:42,140
Moral stains?

129
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,859
Everyone here,

130
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,580
keeping mistresses,

131
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,299
hiding lovers away,
there are plenty of you, aren't there?

132
00:06:48,820 --> 00:06:49,700
So what,

133
00:06:50,339 --> 00:06:52,059
it's double standards
when it comes to me?

134
00:06:52,140 --> 00:06:53,819
Ever since you joined the Tan Group,

135
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,658
trouble has followed one after another.

136
00:06:55,659 --> 00:06:56,778
You're nothing but bad luck.

137
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:57,940
Get out now.

138
00:06:58,419 --> 00:06:59,418
Yeah, get out.

139
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,178
That's right.

140
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,320
This is beyond disappointing.

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,580
I want to see who dares.

142
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:15,680
Track down the person who posted this.

143
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,179
I want results within thirty minutes.

144
00:07:17,219 --> 00:07:18,059
Yes.

145
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:24,778
Li Shujing runs
the company's most critical brand.

146
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:26,619
If she's gone, do you really think a bunch
of well-fed deadweight

147
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:28,900
like you can keep the Tan Group afloat?

148
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,940
I don't want to hear this again.

149
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,020
Otherwise,

150
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:34,619
all of you can get out.

151
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:35,820
Meeting adjourned.

152
00:07:37,099 --> 00:07:38,220
Let's go.

153
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,099
Don't take those comments to heart.

154
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,780
It's fine.

155
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,619
I'm not that fragile.

156
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:04,780
You've been going through those files
for nearly three hours.

157
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,140
You should take a break.

158
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,979
Thanks.

159
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:21,939
There's no way

160
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:23,979
Zhao Youcai just disappeared.

161
00:08:24,525 --> 00:08:26,282
(Tan Jianfei)

162
00:08:30,487 --> 00:08:32,520
(Tan Jianfei)

163
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,260
Come swimming with me.

164
00:08:43,779 --> 00:08:44,619
Alright.

165
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,019
I didn't realize

166
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,418
Young Chairman Tan
was such a strong swimmer.

167
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:57,540
You wouldn't know.

168
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,899
This is a Tan Group original,

169
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:02,019
a crisis-response drill.

170
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,019
Watch.

171
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:05,259
Buoyancy check passed.

172
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:09,060
Impressive, Young Chairman Tan.

173
00:09:09,819 --> 00:09:11,859
The whole company
should learn from this.

174
00:09:12,762 --> 00:09:14,732
Li Shujing, don't.

175
00:09:14,779 --> 00:09:17,345
- Three, two, one. Smile.
- Don't.

176
00:09:17,419 --> 00:09:18,499
Delete it.

177
00:09:22,537 --> 00:09:23,557
Stop filming.

178
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:29,979
Delete it right now.
Delete it. Give it to me.

179
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,019
- Keep one. Just one.
- Delete it. You can't post it.

180
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:32,938
Fine, I'll delete it.

181
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,859
Then trade it
for Wang Jinkai's old files.

182
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,019
So you didn't come just to swim.

183
00:09:45,539 --> 00:09:46,578
After all,

184
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,578
the Autumn Winter
Alpine Collection launch

185
00:09:48,579 --> 00:09:50,139
is coming up fast.

186
00:09:53,459 --> 00:09:54,700
If you wanted it,

187
00:09:54,819 --> 00:09:56,259
you could have told me directly.

188
00:09:56,779 --> 00:09:58,099
Anything I can give, I will.

189
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:05,019
Feeling moved?

190
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:06,680
How are you going to thank me?

191
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,259
Now I owe you a reward too?

192
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:10,060
That's pretty stingy for a grown man.

193
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,019
Aren't you good at swimming?

194
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:15,899
Teach me.

195
00:10:16,059 --> 00:10:17,060
Sure.

196
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,139
But my lessons aren't cheap.

197
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:21,739
If you fail,

198
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,700
you owe me a lifetime pass.

199
00:10:26,659 --> 00:10:27,658
Don't push me.

200
00:10:27,659 --> 00:10:28,739
Leave now.

201
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:32,019
What are you planning to do, Uncle Zhao?
Send me off to meet my father?
