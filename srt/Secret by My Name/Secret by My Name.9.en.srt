You can't bear to let me
fend for myself and die?

3
00:00:22,939 --> 00:00:24,500
I'll spare your life.

4
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,779
Not just yours.

5
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:29,739
Every single member of the Tan family
all of you must stay alive.

6
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:32,860
And wait for me to push you
into hell with my own hands.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:35,299
I just want you to stay.

00:00:35,779 --> 00:00:36,660
I...

9
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,659
I can be your accomplice.

10
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,460
I can come here with you
of my own free will.

11
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:45,259
Whatever you want, I'll give it to you.
All I ask is that you stay.

12
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:47,500
Tan Jianfei.

13
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:50,619
What exactly
are you promising me right now?

14
00:00:50,900 --> 00:00:52,179
Even your own biological father

15
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:54,259
left you here to fend for yourself.

16
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,938
If you want to negotiate with me,

17
00:00:56,939 --> 00:00:57,539
then wait until

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:00:59,500
you're sitting at the very top.

19
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,259
I just want you to stay.

20
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,259

the garden of your soul

22
00:01:11,219 --> 00:01:13,099

B-flat only sounds right with blood.

No. Mom.

00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,259
Mom, it's Jing'er.

Tan Jianfei.

77
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:29,259
Do you really think
that in the Tan Group,

78
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,099
you can control everything?

79
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:34,979
Don't you?

80
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:48,460
(It's time to go back.)

81
00:04:58,659 --> 00:04:59,899
Seems Mr. Tan

82
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,979
hasn't been doing so well either.

83
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:10,780
Save the sarcasm.

84
00:05:10,859 --> 00:05:12,859
I've heard enough.

85
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:22,259
About what we discussed before,
have you made up your mind?

86
00:05:22,260 --> 00:05:24,059
There's nothing to think about.

87
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,659
I've always believed

88
00:05:31,539 --> 00:05:33,700
that you are the chairman
of the Tan Group.

89
00:06:00,779 --> 00:06:01,580
Go.

90
00:06:01,812 --> 00:06:11,220
(Tan Jianfei)

91
00:06:22,099 --> 00:06:22,819
We found it.

92
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:23,738
The West City warehouse.

93
00:06:23,739 --> 00:06:24,460
Move.

94
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,939
You men

95
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,619
only know how to fight and kill all day.

96
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,960
Rushing over there like this,

97
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:33,320
aren't you afraid Wang Jinkai
will drag everyone down with him?

98
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:34,580
Why are you here?

99
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,939
Of course I'm here to help

100
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,780
my little brother.

101
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,940
So what's your plan?

102
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,459
Before coming here,

103
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:45,619
I looked closely into

104
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:47,380
Wang Jinkai's family background.

105
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,700
My plan

106
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,499
is to take a gamble.

107
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,619
To see if he still has even
a trace of humanity left.

108
00:07:09,625 --> 00:07:10,744
Li Shujing.

109
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,380
You're finally awake.

110
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,979
Do you really think

111
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,979
you deserve everything you have now?

112
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,859
Relying on that face of yours

113
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,900
to lure the Tan brothers?

114
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:39,900
Let me tell you this.

115
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:41,218
Without that face,

116
00:07:41,219 --> 00:07:42,780
you are nothing.

117
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,778
You think ruining my face

118
00:07:44,779 --> 00:07:46,260
would make me afraid of you?

119
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,059
Fine.

120
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:51,380
Beg me.

121
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,340
Beg me the way your father did,

122
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,900
kneeling back then.

123
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:01,059
Believe it or not, I might show mercy

124
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:04,299
and leave you half that face.

125
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,580
So you can cry at your mother's grave.

126
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:10,218
Then you'd better take my tongue too.

127
00:08:10,219 --> 00:08:12,260
Otherwise, every disgusting thing
you've done

128
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:14,579
I will tell your daughter,

129
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,419
word for word, in the future.

130
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:17,739
You…

131
00:08:21,937 --> 00:08:23,697
You're the one who should be begging.

132
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,379
Fine.

133
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,978
Then I'll grant your wish.

134
00:08:30,979 --> 00:08:32,298
I'll send you off together,

135
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:33,700
a doomed pair to the end.

136
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,140
So stubborn to the last.

137
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:38,899
Dad.

138
00:08:41,819 --> 00:08:42,658
What?

139
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,739
You want your daughter

140
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,099
to watch you become a killer?

141
00:08:45,179 --> 00:08:46,298
Wang Jinkai.

142
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:47,899
If you stop right now,

143
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,300
I'll have the Tan Group

144
00:08:49,459 --> 00:08:51,259
drop several charges against you.

145
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:53,580
At worst, you serve a couple of years.

146
00:08:54,179 --> 00:08:56,578
But if you keep going like this,

147
00:08:56,579 --> 00:08:58,700
there will be no way back.

148
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,619
Do you really want to do something
in front of your daughter

149
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,139
that will haunt her

150
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:07,180
for the rest of her life?

151
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:19,698
Daddy's playing
a game of saving the princess.

152
00:09:19,699 --> 00:09:20,818
Daddy's the big villain.

153
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,578
Sis will take you
to rescue the princess, okay?

154
00:09:22,579 --> 00:09:23,938
Okay.

155
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:24,739
Let's go.

156
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,820
Come on.

157
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,820
Loop it around.

158
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,180
That's right.

159
00:09:37,819 --> 00:09:38,979

169
00:10:13,299 --> 00:10:14,899
Are you a bad person?

170
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:24,619
What you want

171
00:10:27,179 --> 00:10:28,660
is on Zhao Youcai.

172
00:10:35,779 --> 00:10:36,779
Are you okay?

00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:39,220

175

would you still choose me?

177
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:02,220
I'd tear out your heart
with my own hands

178
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:06,220

It hurts.

180
