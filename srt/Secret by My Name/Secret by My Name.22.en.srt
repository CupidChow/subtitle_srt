1
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:27,399
Well, isn't this my former fiancée.

2
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:28,760
What,

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,960
you're already my sister-in-law now?

4
00:00:32,359 --> 00:00:34,640
The thought of becoming family with you

5
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,799
had me hesitating for a long time.

6
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,719
Being part of the Tan family isn't easy.

7
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,359
That's fine.

8
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:42,239
My husband

9
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,520
can take my last name.

10
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,920
After all, he agrees to anything I say.

11
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,240
Husband?

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,999
Looks like
you are back in your old post.

13
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:56,959
I came all the way back

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:57,879
to help you,

15
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:59,279
don't you owe me

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,520
a "thank you"?

17
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,279
Looks like HR

18
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,919
is getting more and more useless.

19
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,039
They hire without even looking at

20
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:10,479
what the previous boss

21
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,160
thought of him.

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,399
Then I'm really curious

23
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,479
what kind of evaluation

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,039
you have of me.

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,440
Short-sighted.

26
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,360
Narrow-minded.

27
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,119
Like a dog.

28
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:36,798
Young Chairman Tan,
you've been up high for too long.

29
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:38,720
You don't understand that people like me

30
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,839
are very useful.

31
00:01:42,419 --> 00:01:44,179
Seems you know quite well

32
00:01:44,339 --> 00:01:46,379
that you aren't suited for the top spot.

33
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,500
Young Chairman Tan.

34
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:52,539
Chairman Tan has been waiting for you.

35
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:54,340
Miss Li may come along as well.

36
00:02:14,237 --> 00:02:15,379
=Secret By My Name=

37
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,311
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

38
00:02:17,312 --> 00:02:19,098
=Episode 22=

39
00:02:19,099 --> 00:02:20,780
You've just recovered, Chairman.

40
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,819
You should be resting at home.

41
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,419
When no one's around,

42
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,460
call me Dad.

43
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,419
At the office,

44
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:30,819
it's still Chairman.

45
00:02:31,619 --> 00:02:33,060
I'm not used to anything else.

46
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:37,261
The last time I saw you,

47
00:02:37,262 --> 00:02:38,740
you were still a child.

48
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:39,778
Time flies.

49
00:02:39,779 --> 00:02:40,859
You've grown up.

50
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,060
You haven't changed.

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,699
Still so composed.

52
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,180
Composed?

53
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:49,179
You mean when I was in the hospital,

54
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,900
you didn't pull the tubes

55
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,340
and stab me a few times?

56
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,979
I regret it.

57
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,220
Seeing you makes me regret it even more.

58
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,019
People always

59
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:00,218
have to do a few things

60
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,659
they regret

61
00:03:01,779 --> 00:03:02,900
before they grow up.

62
00:03:04,619 --> 00:03:06,379
If you strike slower than your opponent,

63
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,740
(Wu Qiyu)
you die.

64
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:14,340
My mother going missing
was your doing too.

65
00:03:15,539 --> 00:03:17,139
Just a small gift.

66
00:03:17,219 --> 00:03:18,419
Were you satisfied?

67
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:26,378
My son likes you,

68
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,538
but that doesn't mean

69
00:03:27,539 --> 00:03:28,459
he can be with you

70
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,778
forever.

71
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,180
People who know the rules

72
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,379
live longer.

73
00:03:34,059 --> 00:03:36,259
My father followed the rules too well,

74
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,139
and you played him to his death.

75
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:40,020
Tan Zheng'en,

76
00:03:40,219 --> 00:03:41,819
you won't be so lucky forever.

77
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:44,060
Karma will come for you soon.

78
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,539
Karma?

79
00:03:50,779 --> 00:03:52,099
You think Lin Xi

80
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,139
and that

81
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,058
immature brat

82
00:03:54,059 --> 00:03:56,180
can do anything to me?

83
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:58,900
Moving domestic assets,

84
00:03:58,939 --> 00:04:00,419
shutting down local factories,

85
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,699
laying off workers,
setting up shell companies overseas,

86
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,900
taking over
core business and tech teams,

87
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:06,299
and now you're even planning

88
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,859
to sell company shares

89
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,099
to foreign capital.

90
00:04:09,539 --> 00:04:10,299
Do you really expect

91
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,580
the board to watch you short the company

92
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:14,300
and still applaud?

93
00:04:16,059 --> 00:04:17,658
The Tan Group is mine.

94
00:04:17,659 --> 00:04:18,938
How it develops

95
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,058
is my call.

96
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,220
The Tan Group belongs
to everyone in this building.

97
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,659
It belongs to the workers
who toiled day and night.

98
00:04:24,779 --> 00:04:26,220
It belongs to my mother.

99
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,579
The Tan Group,

100
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,019
the place you're standing in now,

101
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,338
is the life's work

102
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,658
of my mother and me.

103
00:04:32,659 --> 00:04:34,419
What right do you have to point fingers?

104
00:04:37,179 --> 00:04:38,099
Miss Li.

105
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,020
Your father's patents

106
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,139
fed the group

107
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:43,140
for eight full years.

108
00:04:43,339 --> 00:04:44,579
Now the group

109
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,699
needs to grow,

110
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,820
to stay alive.

111
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,539
Isn't that just continuing

112
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,179
your father's legacy?

113
00:04:50,219 --> 00:04:51,299
Shouldn't you,

114
00:04:51,339 --> 00:04:52,739
of all people, support it?

115
00:04:52,779 --> 00:04:54,700
You really have no shame.

116
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:58,859
I know

117
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,778
Lin Xi gave you

118
00:04:59,779 --> 00:05:01,538
the materials on my overseas company.

119
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:02,820
So what?

120
00:05:03,179 --> 00:05:05,139
Right now, the Tan Group's patents,

121
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:05,939
technology,

122
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,899
and production lines

123
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,739
are all in my hands.

124
00:05:12,539 --> 00:05:14,059
In three hours,

125
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,700
at 9 o'clock US time,

126
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:17,699
I'll sign

127
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:19,979
the share transfer agreement.

128
00:05:20,179 --> 00:05:21,379
That money

129
00:05:21,380 --> 00:05:23,418
is enough for me
to build another Tan Group,

130
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,739
another legend!

131
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,098
You're negotiating with me

132
00:05:28,099 --> 00:05:29,098
using an empty shell.

133
00:05:29,099 --> 00:05:30,900
Do you really think it's enough?

134
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,978
Back then,
when you were driven into a corner,

135
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:35,619
you abandoned my mother,

136
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:38,499
and made her lose everything.

137
00:05:39,099 --> 00:05:39,978
You left her alone

138
00:05:39,979 --> 00:05:41,979
to die in a cold hospital.

139
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,940
But don't forget,

140
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:47,940
I'm your son.

141
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,499
Why don't you see

142
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,580
how sharp my blade has become

143
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:56,260
after all these years?

144
00:06:02,299 --> 00:06:03,780
This version of you

145
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,619
is finally worthy of being my son.

146
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:07,059
But,

147
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:08,380
remember this.

148
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,260
A blade pointed at me

149
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,220
won't keep you safe.

150
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,460
You scheming old scoundrel, Tan.

151
00:06:23,539 --> 00:06:25,140
I won't let you have it easy.

152
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,179
Let me out.

153
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,099
If you've got the guts, then kill me.

154
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:31,059
Let me out, Tan Zheng'en.

155
00:06:32,179 --> 00:06:33,260
Let go of me.

156
00:06:33,419 --> 00:06:34,859
Tan Zheng'en, what do you want?

157
00:06:36,179 --> 00:06:37,460
Take a guess.

158
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,739
Do you think

159
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:40,780
her blood will finish draining

160
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:42,020
within three hours?

161
00:06:42,339 --> 00:06:43,459
Despicable.

162
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:45,019
If you've got time to curse here,

163
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,538
you'd better use it to figure out

164
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:47,939
how to save her.

165
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,418
You don't have much time

166
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:50,539
left.

167
00:06:50,739 --> 00:06:51,298
He's right.

168
00:06:51,299 --> 00:06:52,419
Let's go now.

169
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:08,179
Wait.

170
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,340
Where are we supposed to go?

171
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,340
We can't panic right now.

172
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:14,979
Think carefully again.

173
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:17,020
What did you see in the video just now?

174
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,099
The video.

175
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,499
Hey, Yusheng.

176
00:07:23,539 --> 00:07:24,579
Come to Yanxin Plaza.

177
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:26,059
Lin Xi was being followed.

178
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,059
I was worried,

179
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,140
so I followed them.

180
00:07:28,299 --> 00:07:28,858
Sister.

181
00:07:28,859 --> 00:07:29,900
I'll go save her.

182
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,178
Be careful.

183
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:32,059
Okay.

184
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,819
You be careful too.

185
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,020
I'll be right there.

186
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,140
Hey, sir.

187
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,459
What are you doing?

188
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,738
You shouldn't be here.

189
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:00,659
Leave now.

190
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,979
Is there a restroom nearby?

191
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,539
My stomach's killing me.

192
00:08:35,779 --> 00:08:37,020
Lin Xi.

193
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,979
