1
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,800
Chairman, sir.

2
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:28,359
Let me stay.

3
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,839
I can be useful to you.

4
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,160
Vice President Tan.

5
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:34,640
When the Tan Group,

6
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,160
was first founded,

7
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,800
how many worked there?

8
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:39,280
And do you know

9
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:42,439
how many of them
are still in this building?

10
00:00:43,479 --> 00:00:45,240
No one dares say they're useful,

11
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,039
unless they can

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,799
lay their value right in front of me.

13
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,200
Bank accounts in Luxembourg.

14
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,280
Chinese-owned factories in Greece.

15
00:00:57,799 --> 00:01:00,159
The Golden Triangle docks.
A shipping fleet in South Africa.

16
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,560
I can handle all of it. Just say the word.

17
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:09,799
That's what Jianfei

18
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,480
doesn't have.

19
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:15,000
He lacks the boldness.

20
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,400
And he's not ruthless enough.

21
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:19,400
Chairman.

22
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:20,879
Are you

23
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:21,959
displeased?

24
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,159
No.

25
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,719
You did very well.

26
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,280
I just don't want two identical blades.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,280
When did you realize it?

28
00:01:33,959 --> 00:01:36,040
When I was treated like a stray dog

29
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,879
and kicked out of the company.

30
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:41,719
He's the master.

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,280
You're the dog.

32
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
That will never change,

33
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:46,319
no matter what.

34
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:51,000
But Zuoyan,

35
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:53,040
sometimes the dog

36
00:01:53,319 --> 00:01:54,680
is smarter than its master.

37
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,760
Because it's been through

38
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,480
too much danger,

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:00,079
hardship,

40
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,359
and cruelty.

41
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,200
Hence,

42
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,799
it's become

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:06,640
more alert,

44
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,319
more vicious,

45
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:09,719
and more decisive.

46
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,400
As long as it doesn't bite its owner,

47
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:15,759
it can stay in this family

48
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,560
for as long as it wants.

49
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,360
I'm a dog.

50
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,560
But I won't be his dog.

51
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,000
Chairman.

52
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,000
When you pull out
of the domestic market,

53
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:28,759
I'll leave with you,

54
00:02:29,639 --> 00:02:30,360
but he won't.

55
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,719
Zuoyan.

56
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:33,719
All these years,

57
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,360
you've endured too much.

58
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,439
About you coming back,

59
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,120
Xiao Zhou

60
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:40,479
will take care of it.

61
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,520
Father.

62
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,080
Is the only thing

63
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,280
that sets me apart from him

64
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:49,240
my mother?

65
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,199
Zuoyan.

66
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,719
This world

67
00:02:56,719 --> 00:02:58,120
has no justice.

68
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,639
Don't ask.

69
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,759
Don't think.

70
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,639
You'll feel better.

71
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,480
=Secret By My Name=

72
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,900
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

73
00:03:40,025 --> 00:03:42,850
=Episode 21=

74
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:48,639
The board

75
00:03:48,639 --> 00:03:50,280
and the shareholders are in chaos.

76
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,319
No one knows where to stand anymore.

77
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Tan Zheng'en really played
a brilliant move.

78
00:03:57,719 --> 00:03:59,159
Starting with Zhao Rou's death,

79
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:00,520
all the scapegoats

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,840
were already in place.

81
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,000
No one expected the mysterious figure
behind Zhao Rou to be Tan Zheng'en.

82
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:07,960
Even the invisible hand

83
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,800
behind the board was him.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,199
He's been plotting this for a long time.

85
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:14,120
He's not showing any mercy.

86
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,360
His killing move

87
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:19,319
doesn't have to be our dead end.

88
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,120
I'll find the opening

89
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,879
and bring him to justice.

90
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:29,120
Why do you seem not surprised at all?

91
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,600
Nothing he does

92
00:04:32,879 --> 00:04:33,959
would surprise me.

93
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:36,839
But you...

94
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,639
You're lying quietly in my arms,

95
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,480
it doesn't feel real.

96
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,600
But once we get out of here,

97
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,360
we'll never have
moments like this again.

98
00:04:55,959 --> 00:04:56,800
Right now, this place

99
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,519
feels like a safe haven.

100
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,319
I really wish we could be
trapped here forever.

101
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,000
I've already been trapped.

102
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,439
For a full eight years.

103
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,040
Eight years?

104
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,240
Wouldn't that rot you?

105
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,319
If I rot with you,

106
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,720
that's a pretty perfect ending.

107
00:05:24,737 --> 00:05:27,787
(Liang Yusheng)

108
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,120
Hey, Yusheng.

109
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:31,360
Sister.

110
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:33,079
Why haven't you moved at all?

111
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,079
Are you hurt? Did something happen?

112
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,360
You can't just

113
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,680
leave me waiting like this.

114
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,000
Ms. Li really is meticulous.

115
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:43,879
You kidnap me,
and even arrange backup for yourself.

116
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,800
So who kidnapped who, really?

117
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,480
I'm the kidnapper.

118
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,199
So the one who dies is you.

119
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:51,560
What.

120
00:05:52,079 --> 00:05:53,319
Afraid I'll lose myself

121
00:05:53,839 --> 00:05:55,079
and crush you right here?

122
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,000
But Liang Yusheng can't save me.

123
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,079
Did I call just to listen to you two

124
00:06:00,079 --> 00:06:01,560
being all lovey-dovey?

125
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,279
Does either of you even care about me?

126
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,560
You are young and strong.

127
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:06,360
You live just fine.

128
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,199
I'm hanging up.

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:12,839
Ms. Li.

130
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,560
My body isn't that strong.

131
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:17,759
I can't take this kind of abuse.

132
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,800
The one abusing you is
searching everywhere for you.

133
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,500
(Assistant Zhou)

134
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,240
Who made you upset, young man?

135
00:06:41,399 --> 00:06:42,600
You're even angry in a cute way.

136
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,439
Let me buy you another drink.

137
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,240
Consider it

138
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,240
paid companionship.

139
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,759
Am I really that cheap to you?

140
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:55,000
Or,

141
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,199
how about a blood oath drink?

142
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,720
Let's go somewhere else.

143
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,079
If I have a good time drinking,

144
00:07:00,839 --> 00:07:01,800
I will pay more.

145
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,759
Wasn't it fun

146
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,879
last time we drank?

147
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:10,519
Don't be silly.

148
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,240
Your performance last time

149
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,879
was pretty unforgettable.

150
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,759
So what are you really here for?

151
00:07:23,279 --> 00:07:24,879
I've already been in your bed,

152
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:26,839
and now I want to be on your boat.

153
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:28,360
How about it?

154
00:07:34,079 --> 00:07:36,160
Pass a message
to those two lovebirds.

155
00:07:36,439 --> 00:07:37,759
If they don't come back soon,

156
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,600
the Tan Group is going to cut and run.

157
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,759
What's left behind then

158
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,240
will be worse than hell.

159
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,199
What's so scary about hell?

160
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,360
You would still
leave yourself a way out.

161
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,959
I'll accept it on their behalf.

162
00:07:54,439 --> 00:07:55,639
It's not free, okay?

163
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:19,480
Don't worry.

164
00:08:19,839 --> 00:08:21,600
I never take free stuff from anyone.

165
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:34,560
You little brat.

166
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:50,399
Chairman Tan.

167
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,559
This woman

168
00:09:00,559 --> 00:09:02,000
is always so exasperating.

169
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,480
Young people like to pick roses.

170
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,440
You only understand when you're older

171
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,639
that crushed roses are the ones

172
00:09:12,039 --> 00:09:12,840
that matter.

173
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,200
(That old nincompoop Tan Zheng'en)

174
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:18,759
(always acting on a whim.)

175
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,759
(I'd better run a full check)

176
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:21,720
(on Li Shujing's.)

177
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:24,279
(Could she have left
something important)

178
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:25,480
(in the office?)

179
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:28,039
(After all...)

180
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:31,919
Tell your boss

181
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,320
my presence is costly.

182
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,039
Keep this up and I'm out.

183
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,799
So you finally grew a conscience

184
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,320
and are done with evil deeds?

185
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:44,080
Why are you here?

186
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,000
At a time like this,

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,039
you're still packing up?

188
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,279
Who do you think I came for?

189
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,559
If I weren't worried about you,

190
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:56,759
do you think I'd bother pretending
to pack Shujing's resignation stuff?

191
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,000
I told you,

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,279
even if it's hell,
I'd leave you a back door.

193
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,039
So why won't you pull out?

194
00:10:04,879 --> 00:10:07,039
But I'm already stuck
at the center of the storm.

195
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,200
That's why I want you
out of this vortex,

196
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:10,559
so we can both walk away intact.

197
00:10:11,039 --> 00:10:12,159
Do you get it?

198
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:16,240
Miss Lin.

199
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,080
Chairman Tan wants you in his office.

200
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:19,759
Got it.

201
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,360
Stop working with him.

202
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:39,759
You can have me

203
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,639
for the rest of your life.

204
00:10:43,759 --> 00:10:44,480
I know.

205
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,320
In the end,

206
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,960
I still chose your side.
