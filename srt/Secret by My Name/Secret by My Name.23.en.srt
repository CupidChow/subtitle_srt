1
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,819
I thought I'd made a solid plan.

2
00:00:16,419 --> 00:00:17,979
I even had your help.

3
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:22,139
I thought we could definitely
bring down the Tan Group

4
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:25,099
and bring down Tan Zheng'en.

5
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,739
But I still overestimated myself.

6
00:00:32,979 --> 00:00:33,978
I'd long prepared myself

7
00:00:33,979 --> 00:00:36,380
to pay a heavy price for this.

8
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:41,780
I just never imagined...

9
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:47,180
that you'd be the one sacrificed.

10
00:00:53,299 --> 00:00:54,619
Kid.

11
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:59,939
Do you think I was destined to be alone?

12
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:04,339
Everyone who gets too close to me

13
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,619
always seems to end up with misfortune.

14
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:11,620
You lost so much blood,

15
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,140
and all I could do was watch.

16
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:19,860
I was completely helpless.

17
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:24,620
I'm the one who deserves to die.

18
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,220
No one deserves to die.

19
00:01:34,339 --> 00:01:36,340
We're all struggling forward
the best we can.

20
00:01:44,499 --> 00:01:45,138
You pulled him

21
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:46,860
out of the abyss.

22
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,140
He just did something worthwhile

23
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,739
because you're worth it.

24
00:01:55,779 --> 00:01:57,539
Don't you want to see
the Tan Group collapse?

25
00:01:58,139 --> 00:02:00,179
Don't you want to see them
fall flat on their faces?

26
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,900
We're about to succeed.

27
00:02:06,619 --> 00:02:08,260
We'll all be reborn,

28
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,060
and we'll carry Yusheng's share with us.

But you're a Tan too.

00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:42,859
I know.

00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:44,659
That's exactly why

69
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,859
there are things only I can do.

70
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,619
Our deal with Mr. You
was supposed to be signed next week,

71
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,778
but they wired the money early

72
00:05:50,779 --> 00:05:51,899
to the wrong account.

73
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,699
Now the company accounts are frozen.

74
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,778
All incoming
and outgoing funds are suspended.

75
00:05:55,779 --> 00:05:57,260
We didn't have a choice.

76
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,538
And the overseas accounts?

77
00:05:58,539 --> 00:05:59,579
They're affected too.

78
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:02,418
Given the unfreezing process,
this could drag on for another month.

79
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:03,259
And that's not all.

80
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,080
We also got a call
from the banking regulator.

81
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:05,538
They may

82
00:06:05,539 --> 00:06:07,059
send down an inspection team.

83
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:08,460
Darn it.

(Li Shujing)

86
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,858
This was your doing.

87
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:35,099
You snake.

88
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,179
What?

89
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:40,979
When you pull dirty tricks,

90
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:42,460
you call it strategy.

91
00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:43,780
When I did it,

92
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,499
suddenly I'm the villain?

93
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,738
Do you even realize

94
00:06:46,739 --> 00:06:48,978
how much damage this causes the company?

95
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,979
The Tan Group isn't
as fragile as you think.

96
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:52,820
Once it gets past this,

97
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:54,220
it'll come back stronger.

98
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,979
Curse you!

99
00:06:59,739 --> 00:07:00,940

100
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,019
Looks like you should

101
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,340
focus on your recovery,

102
00:07:04,859 --> 00:07:06,299
so you don't overdo it later.

103
00:07:11,299 --> 00:07:13,658
There are three hours left
before the accounts get frozen.

104
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:15,338
Let's see if your overseas backers

105
00:07:15,339 --> 00:07:16,780
still dare to sign after that.

106
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:17,780
You...

107
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,539
Mr. Tan.

108
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:22,940
Chairman Tan wants to see you.

109
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:25,699
And this

110
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,659
is for you.

111
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:33,699
(All of Tan Group's core patents)

112
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,340

Little brother.

114
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:40,859
Looks like

115
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,820
you're not having it easy either.

116
00:07:50,859 --> 00:07:51,939
The company's

117
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,179
probably finished.

118
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:55,178
The Tan family hasn't even spoken yet.

119
00:07:55,179 --> 00:07:56,580
Why should we be panicking?

120
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,739
Didn't you hear?

121
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,259
They've hollowed out the company

122
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,619
and moved everything overseas.

123
00:08:00,659 --> 00:08:01,538
For real?

124
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,580
What?

125
00:08:06,779 --> 00:08:07,859
You?

126
00:08:08,299 --> 00:08:09,419
Where's Chairman Tan?

127
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,619
The chairman hasn't been well lately.

128
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:14,738
So he's decided

129
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:15,939
that Mr.Tan

130
00:08:15,940 --> 00:08:17,419
will act as chairman for now.

131
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,658
Something this serious happens,

132
00:08:31,659 --> 00:08:34,179
and Chairman Tan just walks away?

133
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,140
Director Zhang.

134
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:41,859
If I'm sitting in this seat,

135
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,779
then every decision the company makes
is my responsibility.

136
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:46,499
So how is that

137
00:08:46,699 --> 00:08:47,818
walking away?

138
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:48,940
And where's Tan Jianfei?

139
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,058
Chairman Tan isn't here,

140
00:08:50,059 --> 00:08:51,099
and neither is he.

141
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:54,859
Director Zhang.

142
00:08:55,819 --> 00:08:58,019
Take a good look.

143
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,619
My last name is Tan too.

144
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:00,499
But...

145
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,660
Sit down.

146
00:09:17,299 --> 00:09:18,499
Tan Jianfei

147
00:09:18,579 --> 00:09:20,139
turned against his own people,

148
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,418
colluded with outsiders
to undermine the company,

149
00:09:22,419 --> 00:09:24,700
and caused
the company accounts to be frozen.

150
00:09:25,579 --> 00:09:26,700
Effective immediately,

151
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:28,739
he is stripped of his board authority

152
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,060
and all positions.

153
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,259
Get your people together.

154
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,298
Be ready to move.

155
00:09:41,299 --> 00:09:42,658
I'll send you Tan Group's

156
00:09:42,659 --> 00:09:44,060
key financial files later.

157
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,219
Young Chairman Tan,
you really are going all in.

158
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,820
Don't lose your nerve now.

159
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,658
Tan Zheng'en has transferred

161
00:09:50,659 --> 00:09:52,660

Shujing's father left behind.

If we don't act now,

163
00:09:54,419 --> 00:09:55,499
