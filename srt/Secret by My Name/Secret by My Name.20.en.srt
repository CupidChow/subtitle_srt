1
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:19,700
You're late.

2
00:00:20,780 --> 00:00:22,339
I'm not your employee anymore.

3
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,820
I don't need to clock in on time, do I?

4
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:27,099
Back when you worked for me,

5
00:00:27,139 --> 00:00:28,579
I never made you clock in either.

6
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:32,699
So the ever-busy Mr. Tan asked me out

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,059
just to check my attendance records?

8
00:00:35,099 --> 00:00:37,059
Trying to take back
my perfect-attendance bonus?

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:41,579
Sounds like
you didn't check your payslip.

10
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,179
There was never

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,619
a perfect-attendance bonus.

12
00:00:45,659 --> 00:00:47,619
Then why did you ask me out?

13
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,659
The factory.

14
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,500
I owe you an explanation.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,740
Things escalated too suddenly.

16
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:57,618
When I asked to meet,

17
00:00:57,619 --> 00:00:59,100
I didn't expect you to come.

18
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:03,220
That's a fair assumption.

19
00:01:04,579 --> 00:01:06,820
After all, you were the one
who kicked me out.

20
00:01:07,259 --> 00:01:08,618
By all logic,

21
00:01:08,619 --> 00:01:10,379
I should cut ties with you completely.

22
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:13,500
But that would let you off too easily.

23
00:01:15,419 --> 00:01:16,459
Because

24
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:19,099
I'm the fear buried in your heart.

25
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:21,258
You're afraid I'll expose

26
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:22,539
everything you've done.

27
00:01:23,779 --> 00:01:24,899
So you deserve

28
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:27,019
to be condemned by your conscience

29
00:01:27,419 --> 00:01:28,539
day and night.

30
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:32,498
You are indeed my deepest fear.

31
00:01:32,499 --> 00:01:34,900
But you don't understand why.

32
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:37,659
Right now, you're standing alone
at the edge of a cliff.

33
00:01:38,059 --> 00:01:39,420
This cliff

34
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:42,140
is a scale of good and evil
sharpened by fate itself.

35
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,620
One wrong step,

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:47,299
and it'll pierce your ankle,

37
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,260
leaving you bleeding

38
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,860
and in unbearable pain.

39
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:53,659
Li Shujing,

40
00:01:54,419 --> 00:01:55,500
stop now.

41
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,340
Don't keep digging.

42
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:01,939
No matter who's hiding behind the board,

43
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,900
I will drag him into the open.

44
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:08,179
A climber doesn't stop moving

45
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,579
just because of the wind.

46
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:12,179
Whether I walk this cliff,

47
00:02:12,419 --> 00:02:13,739
and how I walk it,

48
00:02:14,499 --> 00:02:15,859
that's my choice.

52
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:32,699
Have things been arranged
with the factory?

53
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,658
Alright. You don't need to come
to the office today.

54
00:02:36,659 --> 00:02:38,379
Have someone keep an eye on Li Shujing.

55
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:40,259
Don't let her out of your sight.

56
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,020
Otherwise, start looking for a new job.

(Liang Yusheng)

58
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,780
Why is he calling?

59
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:54,659
Hello?

60
00:02:54,819 --> 00:02:55,938
What did you do to my sister?

61
00:02:55,939 --> 00:02:57,218
What are you talking about?

62
00:02:57,219 --> 00:02:58,218
She sent me

63
00:02:58,219 --> 00:03:00,099
a strange message,
then turned off her phone.

64
00:03:00,219 --> 00:03:01,139
She said

65
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,259
the wind was too strong.

66
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:05,220
The wind was too strong?

67
00:03:05,980 --> 00:03:07,579
A climber doesn't stop moving

68
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:08,899
just because of the wind.

69
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,020
Something has happened to her.

70
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:13,659
Who are you?

71
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,620
Shujing!

72
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:27,740
Why are you here?

73
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,620
I thought you wouldn't come.

74
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,180
My heart has long since
become bound to yours.

75
00:03:36,387 --> 00:03:37,466
Your heartbeat

76
00:03:37,539 --> 00:03:40,300
will betray your hiding place
with every gust of wind.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,580
No matter where you are,

78
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,500
I'll find you.

79
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,819
But you should know who kidnapped me.

80
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:52,500
Doing this

81
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:55,180
may damage
whatever bond still exists between you.

82
00:03:56,339 --> 00:03:57,539
A bond?

83
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,300
That old man has been lying there
for years.

84
00:04:00,819 --> 00:04:02,180
Did he ever think about a bond?

85
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,580
Eight years.

86
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:17,060
This is the second time
you have played this game.

87
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,460
What?

88
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:21,300
Are you planning

89
00:04:22,179 --> 00:04:23,178
to leave bite marks

90
00:04:23,179 --> 00:04:24,539
on my other collarbone as well?

91
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:28,020
You said it yourself.

92
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:29,659
It's been eight years.

93
00:04:30,539 --> 00:04:33,059
My methods should be
more refined by now.

94
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,499
For example,

95
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,299
the rope binding you today

96
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,659
is not tied in a pretty bow.

97
00:04:41,179 --> 00:04:42,499
And for another,

98
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,539
I prepared this as well.

99
00:04:47,299 --> 00:04:48,900
Let's talk here.

100
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,659
Tell me what really happened back then.

101
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,338
I already said it.

102
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:55,020
I want everything.

103
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,700
I understand you,

104
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:59,499
just as you understand me.

105
00:05:00,099 --> 00:05:01,979
I know you're hiding something.

106
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,859
What if I refuse to speak?

107
00:05:09,099 --> 00:05:10,539
Would you kill me?

108
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:16,218
We live under the rule of law now.

109
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:17,859
Murder is a crime.

110
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,619
But

111
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:23,099
suicide isn't.

Does your dad

136
00:06:37,219 --> 00:06:39,499
really plan to spare no one?

137
00:06:41,219 --> 00:06:42,419
Why?

00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:45,700

Why won't he even spare my family?

141
00:06:50,539 --> 00:06:53,019
Mr. Li. Rather than waiting for others
to grant you a way out,

142
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,820
you should choose a path for them
yourself.

143
