1
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,540
(What exactly happened back then?)

2
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:30,020
(In that videotape,)

3
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:32,419
(what were you
really trying to tell me?)

4
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:36,939
Come to think of it,

5
00:00:37,259 --> 00:00:39,339
I should have come
to see your father long ago,

6
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,339
but I never knew where to go.

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,058
After thinking it over,

8
00:00:43,059 --> 00:00:44,379
I still ended up here.

9
00:00:46,339 --> 00:00:48,460
This is where he
brought me into the trade.

10
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,619
If it hadn't been for him back then,

11
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:53,258
I would never have risen so smoothly,

12
00:00:53,259 --> 00:00:54,540
or entered the Overseas Division.

13
00:00:54,619 --> 00:00:55,939
Get to the point.

14
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:58,140
I don't want to argue with you here.

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:03,780
You really aren't much like your father.

16
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:06,619
Your father was easygoing

17
00:01:06,740 --> 00:01:07,979
and gentle by nature.

18
00:01:08,299 --> 00:01:10,299
I learned from him for so many years,

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:13,099
and never once saw him lose his temper.

20
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,800
So that gave you the right

21
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,739
to do whatever you wanted
and make him the scapegoat?

22
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,019
So my family, the Lis,

23
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,418
were simply meant to be sacrificed

24
00:01:20,419 --> 00:01:21,780
to prop up Tan Group's glory?

25
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,138
That's something
you should ask Tan Jianfei.

26
00:01:24,139 --> 00:01:26,739
No one is more suited
than him to inherit Tan Group.

27
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:29,138
If he truly wanted to go all in for you,

28
00:01:29,139 --> 00:01:31,780
he would have gotten hold
of Tan Group's evidence long ago.

29
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:33,819
So that batch of fabric back then

30
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,179
was swapped by you.

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:36,659
What fabric?

32
00:01:37,059 --> 00:01:39,340
At the time, I was focused
on entering the Overseas Division.

33
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:40,939
I knew nothing about that matter.

34
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:44,140
Are you going to hit me now?

35
00:01:44,419 --> 00:01:46,299
If you keep spouting nonsense here,

36
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:48,780
I really might lose control and hit you.

37
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,900
You demons who feed on others in hell

38
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:54,019
will all face
retribution sooner or later.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,019
Get out.

40
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,339
=Secret By My Name=

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,099
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

42
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:29,195
=Episode 16=

43
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:46,338
Li Shujing already knows what happened
at the factory back then,

44
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:48,680
and she also knows about the money
laundering in the Overseas Division.

45
00:02:48,939 --> 00:02:50,379
No, she doesn't.

46
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,180
I handled that matter cleanly.

47
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,640
She's only suspicious. Just suspicion.

48
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,640
Back then, on that rainy night,
Tan Jianfei was there,

49
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:59,240
and he still managed
to keep it from Li Shujing.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:02,058
You've known Li Shujing for only a few days,
and she's already suspected you to pieces.

51
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:03,300
What?

52
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:04,538
You mean...

53
00:03:04,539 --> 00:03:05,699
Once there's suspicion,

54
00:03:06,099 --> 00:03:07,459
there must be action.

55
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,538
Before Li Shujing

56
00:03:08,539 --> 00:03:10,218
gets hold of all the evidence,

57
00:03:10,219 --> 00:03:11,379
this has to be finished.

58
00:03:11,779 --> 00:03:13,379
You mean...

59
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,259
I mean

60
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,180
you already understand.

61
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:23,220
Don't force me
to move against your family.

62
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,740
Leave no loose ends.

63
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:38,740
Why?

64
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,620
Why?

65
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,939
I've done so much for Tan Group.

66
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,460
Why does it end like this?

67
00:04:15,339 --> 00:04:16,939
What are you doing?

68
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,538
It's been so many days,

69
00:04:20,539 --> 00:04:21,819
and you haven't even called once.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,980
Do you think that just because
you're at the factory now,

71
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:25,400
you don't need to report to your boss?

72
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:27,178
I'm working at the factory now.

73
00:04:27,179 --> 00:04:28,739
I'm busy all day long.

74
00:04:29,299 --> 00:04:30,939
Mr. Tan, are you asking me to report

75
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:32,619
personal matters or work matters?

76
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,900
I don't have time
to report every little thing.

77
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,019
Alright.

78
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,739
It's me who wants to report to Ms. Li.

79
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:44,218
I just wanted to tell you

80
00:04:44,219 --> 00:04:45,619
that in my thorn-filled life,

81
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,859
only one flower has ever bloomed.

82
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:48,460
And that flower is you.

83
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:50,699
- Have you no shame at all?
- Honestly.

84
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,579
There are so many people here.

85
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:54,218
Can you at least mind the setting?

86
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:55,700
You went so long without calling me

87
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,440
that I came up
with a hundred different reasons

88
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,419
just to get you to see me.

89
00:04:58,739 --> 00:05:00,738
I thought about saying
there was a company meeting,

90
00:05:00,739 --> 00:05:02,580
or that the factory
needed new equipment.

91
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:04,580
But every time I stood in front of you,

92
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,780
all I could manage to say

93
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:08,419
was how badly I missed you.

94
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:11,940
You're really like a kid.

95
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:16,220
Tan Jianfei,

96
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,539
but

97
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,098
what's between us

98
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:22,538
has never been just romance.

99
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:23,539
I know.

100
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:24,859
That's why

101
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:28,059
you need to make full use of me,
use every bit of my value.

102
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,739
You have to leverage all my connections
and my family background.

103
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,979
Even if you hate me,

104
00:05:34,900 --> 00:05:36,299
don't forget that you also love me.

105
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,499
What are you looking at?

106
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,340
Am I extra handsome today?

107
00:05:46,419 --> 00:05:49,739
I'm checking
how stupid a really big fool can be.

108
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,298
Hurry up.

109
00:06:00,299 --> 00:06:01,780
This is so embarrassing.

110
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,538
Did you hear?

111
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:15,739
The Overseas Division
is buried in massive debt.

112
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,507
Doesn't that mean Vice Chairman Zhao
has to take responsibility?

113
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,179
Misusing company funds
counts as a financial crime, doesn't it?

114
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,939
Legal is about to take her away.

115
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:24,499
How many years would that get her?

116
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:27,340
If she really goes down...

117
00:06:30,179 --> 00:06:31,099
Ms. Zhao,

118
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,059
what exactly is going on?

119
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,778
Didn't you say we'd never be exposed?

120
00:06:34,779 --> 00:06:35,778
And who is he?

121
00:06:35,779 --> 00:06:39,340
Didn't you say that once we were back,
we could cover everything with assets?

122
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:41,819
Are they arresting us now
to press charges?

123
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:42,819
What's going on?

124
00:06:42,820 --> 00:06:45,000
We're all just employees.
Let them finish the investigation first.

125
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,059
Get away from me.

126
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,418
Say something.

127
00:06:47,419 --> 00:06:48,298
Say something.

128
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:49,459
Say it.

129
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:50,820
Say something!

130
00:06:52,099 --> 00:06:53,140
Are you okay?

131
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,340
Do you think I wanted to be exposed?

132
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:01,020
I should just die.

133
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:03,859
All of you want me dead.

134
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,179
Every single one of you

135
00:07:07,859 --> 00:07:10,139
just wants to see me
make a fool of myself.

136
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,140
Move. Move.

137
00:07:25,225 --> 00:07:28,970
(Cellphone 8-5432-402 0062)

138
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:30,539
Hello.

139
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,380
You did very well.

140
00:07:32,539 --> 00:07:33,900
Using failed investments

141
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,859
to cover up the money laundering.

142
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:37,859
Can you spare my life?

143
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,139
I beg you.

144
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:40,218
But remember this.

145
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:41,579
Only the dead

146
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,020
can keep a secret forever.

147
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:55,819
The Overseas Division
led by Vice Chairman Zhao

148
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,619
misappropriated a large amount
of company funds

149
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,179
for personal investments,

150
00:07:59,219 --> 00:08:00,538
all of which failed,

151
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,900
causing incalculable losses
to the company.

152
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,940
The Legal Department
has now filed a lawsuit.

153
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:06,298
Everyone present,

154
00:08:06,299 --> 00:08:08,419
if anyone accepted benefits
from Zhao Rou,

155
00:08:08,979 --> 00:08:10,539
report it to the company voluntarily.

156
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,539
Ms. Zhao,

157
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,539
you suspended me last time.

158
00:08:25,739 --> 00:08:27,499
This time it's truly
self destruction through

159
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:28,580
repeated wrongdoing.

160
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,699
Design Director Li Shujing

161
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:38,019
was reassigned to the factory
due to Zhao Rou's actions.

162
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:40,199
Now, in the name of the Board,
I am transferring her back.

163
00:08:40,199 --> 00:08:41,540
Does anyone here object?

164
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,259
No. No objections.

165
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,739
Since you refuse to talk
about what happened back then,

166
00:08:46,299 --> 00:08:48,259
I won't hesitate
to return it blow for blow.

167
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:49,779
A debt answered with a debt.

168
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:51,660
Why do you keep pushing me?

169
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,099
When you forced my father to his death,

170
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,859
did you ever think
of sparing him a way out?

171
00:08:57,819 --> 00:08:59,859
You were the one who leaked
today's news, weren't you?

172
00:09:00,699 --> 00:09:02,060
Trying to bury the truth.

173
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,259
Then of course
I had to add fuel to the fire.

174
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:09,340
Only then will you,

175
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,460
pour everything out in court.

176
00:09:13,059 --> 00:09:14,340
Come with me to the rooftop.

177
00:09:16,179 --> 00:09:18,019
I'll tell you
what really happened that year.

178
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:30,660
Shujing.

179
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,300
Say it here.

180
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,379
I'll only say it to you.

181
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,940
You'd better come up
before Legal gets to me.

182
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:17,340
What exactly are you trying to say?

183
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,220
Why can't Tang Jianfei hear it?

184
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,820
Of course I have to keep it from him.

185
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,259
Otherwise, how could he have told you
what was on that tape?

186
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,099
What did you just say?

187
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,219
When your father died,

188
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,180
Tang Jianfei was there.

189
00:10:38,299 --> 00:10:41,379
He watched your father die
with his own eyes.

190
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,979
The wind

191
00:11:02,059 --> 00:11:04,060
can never erase the truth.

192
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:06,499
You didn't mishear a thing.

193
00:11:07,699 --> 00:11:09,139
I'll say it again.

194
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:12,060
When your father died,

195
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,670
Tang Jianfei
was standing right beside him.

196
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:24,899
Once you come to your senses,

197
00:11:25,179 --> 00:11:26,940
stop telling yourself lies.

198
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,460
Lies?

199
00:11:30,939 --> 00:11:33,259
Who's the one lying to themselves?

200
00:11:33,419 --> 00:11:35,779
You're choosing to look away,

201
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:38,820
just to preserve that sweet,
blood-stained illusion.

202
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:41,300
Have you ever thought about this?

203
00:11:42,459 --> 00:11:43,820
The moment you look up,

204
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,778
you'll see that rough hemp rope

205
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:49,460
pressed tight
against your father's neck,

206
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:52,019
never letting him rest in peace.

207
00:12:03,059 --> 00:12:04,259
You've said all this,

208
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,820
so where's the proof?

209
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,540
Anything that truly happened

210
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,420
is like paper once burned.

211
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:14,460
It always leaves marks
that can't be erased.

212
00:12:19,779 --> 00:12:21,460
I'm asking you, where is the evidence?

213
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:24,460
Isn't that something
you need to uncover yourself?

214
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,580
Do you dare to tear open

215
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,019
that scabbed-over wound,

216
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,660
and face the raw,
bleeding truth beneath it?
