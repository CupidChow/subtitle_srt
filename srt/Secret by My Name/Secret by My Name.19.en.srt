1
00:00:20,099 --> 00:00:22,340
Tan Jianfei,
have you completely lost your mind?

2
00:00:24,159 --> 00:00:26,660
You actually tried to stage an accident
with a mentally ill patient.

3
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,340
That is not how you get compensation.

4
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,419
What a shame.

5
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:39,740
I was counting on this

6
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:41,659
to make a quick fortune.

7
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:49,860
I did not hurt your mom.

8
00:00:50,299 --> 00:00:51,220
I know.

9
00:00:52,619 --> 00:00:54,299
But a moment of innocence

10
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,180
does not erase past sins.

11
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:03,699
You're an Asura
who crawled out of hell.

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,880
There are so many doctors and nurses
at that hospital.

13
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:14,099
Your mom managed to leave
under so many eyes watching,

14
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,939
someone had to be behind it.

15
00:01:17,139 --> 00:01:18,819
That hospital is no longer safe.

16
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,980
I've already transferred my mom.

17
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:23,420
It's only half an hour
from the hospital to the villa.

18
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:25,179
You should understand

19
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:26,939
this was a warning.

20
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,140
Who is it?

21
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:31,700
I'm not sure.

22
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,939
Tan Jianfei,

23
00:01:35,419 --> 00:01:36,179
do you really think

24
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,900
playing dumb will make them stop?

25
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:43,579
The things you keep avoiding

26
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:46,539
are already eating away at you
in the dark,

27
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,579
trying to drag you into the abyss.

28
00:01:51,499 --> 00:01:52,900
You are my abyss.

29
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,299
Tan Jianfei, I'm warning you.

30
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,338
Until your wounds heal,

31
00:02:04,339 --> 00:02:06,099
don't do anything reckless again.

32
00:02:06,499 --> 00:02:07,899
I don't want your epitaph

33
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,539
to say you died because of me.

34
00:02:11,419 --> 00:02:12,420
That's bad luck.

35
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:27,579
Perhaps the one
who should stop acting recklessly

36
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:28,539
is you.

(Tan Group)

41
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:48,859
She leaked the company's

42
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:50,899
Alpine design drawings,

43
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,539
and still has the nerve to stay here.

44
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,139
She has no shame at all.

45
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:54,618
Exactly.

46
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:55,500
If I see her...

47
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,299
It's her.

48
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,699
She leaked our company secrets.

49
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,060
How could she do that?

50
00:03:02,779 --> 00:03:04,979
What are you chatting about so happily
this early?

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,180
Why don't you share it with me?

52
00:03:06,260 --> 00:03:07,139
It's nothing.

53
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,040
If you dared to do something dirty,
what are you afraid of?

54
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:12,360
You leaked the company's
Alpine design drawings to a competitor.

55
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,939
Do you really think
you still belong here?

56
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:16,620
I leaked the designs?

57
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:17,538
Ms. Li,

58
00:03:17,539 --> 00:03:19,620
Mr. Tan would like you
in the conference room.

59
00:03:24,619 --> 00:03:26,979
I believe everyone
has seen this document.

60
00:03:27,019 --> 00:03:29,179
(Spring Haute Couture)
As for Michelle's designs this season,

61
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,139
whether in color

62
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,419
or tailoring,

63
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,620
they're strikingly similar to ours.

64
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:37,379
Ms. Li, these materials were
all in your hands, weren't they?

65
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,300
So many people in the company
have seen the designs.

66
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:43,058
On what grounds do you assume

67
00:03:43,059 --> 00:03:44,500
that I was the one who leaked them?

68
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:45,780
Do you have evidence?

69
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,300
Or is all of this

70
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,900
nothing more than your own speculation?

71
00:03:51,619 --> 00:03:54,259
It's true that many people
saw the design drafts.

72
00:03:54,619 --> 00:03:55,498
However,

73
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:57,900
the one person
who knew the complete design concept

74
00:03:58,059 --> 00:03:59,220
was only you.

75
00:04:00,099 --> 00:04:01,459
Ms. Li studied design.

76
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,859
Surely someone has told you

77
00:04:02,939 --> 00:04:04,340
that design elements

78
00:04:04,779 --> 00:04:06,378
can look broadly similar,

79
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,819
but design concepts

80
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,340
are always one of a kind.

81
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:10,460
Isn't that so?

82
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:16,460
Design should be sacred and pure.

83
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,819
I never imagined

84
00:04:18,939 --> 00:04:20,539
that one day,

85
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,979
design itself would become
a tool to frame someone,

86
00:04:23,219 --> 00:04:24,340
or that a paintbrush

87
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,499
could turn into
a blade of deceit and intrigue.

88
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,939
On top of that,

89
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:34,299
I also collected photos
of Ms. Li dining with Michelle's owner.

90
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,380
Of course,

91
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:39,819
everyone is free to believe

92
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,820
it was just a meal between friends,

93
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,900
if you want to.

94
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,259
She looks so proper on the surface,

95
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,059
who would have thought
she was a traitor?

96
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:50,899
How could she do something like this?
Mr. Tan, you're too kind.

97
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,780
She never should have been allowed in.

98
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:55,099
She must be kicked out of Tan Group.

99
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,940
Yes, throw her out.

100
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,619
People like her can't stay.

101
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,499
A backstabbing traitor.

102
00:05:01,219 --> 00:05:03,260
Design Director Li Shujing,

103
00:05:03,979 --> 00:05:05,659
for leaking company secrets

104
00:05:05,659 --> 00:05:07,320
and abusing her authority
for personal gain,

105
00:05:07,659 --> 00:05:09,499
in accordance with company regulations,

106
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,619
you're hereby relieved of all duties.

107
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,979
The company reserves the right
to pursue further liability.

108
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:15,659
Everyone present,

109
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:18,340
those in favor of this decision,
please raise your hands.

110
00:05:22,859 --> 00:05:23,780
Li Shujing,

111
00:05:25,339 --> 00:05:26,499
you're fired.

112
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,340
Before you leave,
hand in your badge and access card,

113
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,619
so you don't find an excuse
to sneak back at night to steal things.

114
00:06:24,099 --> 00:06:25,099
Have you lost your mind?

115
00:06:25,739 --> 00:06:27,340
Do you realize you almost got run over?

116
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:28,580
What?

117
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,820
Afraid I'd die under your car?

118
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:34,260
Afraid you'd be the one
to send me to hell?

119
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,379
Have you forgotten

120
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,140
what your Tan family has done?

121
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:41,020
I've been in hell
for a long time already.

122
00:06:41,099 --> 00:06:43,920
You did this just because you got fired?
You really think...

123
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,179
I did it because I got fired?

124
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:50,340
No.

125
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,820
It's because every single person
in the Tan family

126
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,179
makes me sick.

127
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,099
Tan Jianfei,

128
00:06:58,979 --> 00:07:01,580
so you dare say
you knew nothing about the designs?

129
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:06,920
(One week earlier)

130
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:21,820
You scared me.

131
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,739
Why are you acting
like a big dumb puppy?

132
00:07:24,339 --> 00:07:25,780
Why are you here at this hour?

133
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,419
Ms. Li, you're working this late.

134
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:28,658
Are you trying

135
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:30,220
to rack up more overtime pay from me?

136
00:07:31,539 --> 00:07:33,019
I want to personally oversee

137
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,820
every step
of Michelle's Spring Alpine line.

138
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,179
Otherwise, I won't feel at ease.

139
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,978
This season's color palette, tailoring style,

140
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:45,259
and element choices

141
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,340
are all still provisional.

142
00:07:46,779 --> 00:07:47,900
Nothing's been finalized yet?

143
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,659
We do have Plans B, C, and D,

144
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,459
but I'm not confident yet

145
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,700
which one should be Plan A.

146
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:58,940
Perfect timing.

147
00:07:58,979 --> 00:08:00,298
I know Michelle's owner.

148
00:08:00,299 --> 00:08:00,738
Last week,

149
00:08:00,739 --> 00:08:02,338
when I played golf with him,

150
00:08:02,339 --> 00:08:03,059
he said

151
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,659
he's not flying abroad this weekend.

152
00:08:04,820 --> 00:08:06,539
Book an afternoon tea with him for me.

153
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:10,220
I'm not your assistant.

154
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,579
If there's nothing in it for me,

155
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,579
I'm not doing it.

156
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,699
Tan Jianfei,

157
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:16,419
this is your family's company.

158
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:18,899
Your spring stock gains

159
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:21,099
have nothing to do with me.

160
00:08:21,219 --> 00:08:22,019
Okay?

161
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,940
So?

162
00:08:23,339 --> 00:08:25,178
The board looks at your design drafts.

163
00:08:25,179 --> 00:08:26,580
That's your KPI.

164
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,099
Unless...

165
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,220
Unless what?

166
00:08:32,859 --> 00:08:34,099
Unless

167
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:36,220
you bribe me a little.

168
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,938
Tan Jianfei.

169
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:39,859
This is the office.

170
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,379
This is my company.

171
00:08:49,299 --> 00:08:50,340
Enough. Stop it.

172
00:08:50,779 --> 00:08:53,139
The afternoon tea with Michelle's owner

173
00:08:53,419 --> 00:08:55,220
was booked by you.

174
00:08:55,939 --> 00:08:59,219
Of course. Otherwise,
how could they have taken photos

175
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:01,060
from such perfectly chosen angles?

176
00:09:02,699 --> 00:09:03,820
Tan Jianfei,

177
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,859
this is exactly
the kind of thing you would do.

178
00:09:08,059 --> 00:09:09,739
After all, your surname is Tan.

179
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,460
Every time I think of
those filthy things,

180
00:09:13,539 --> 00:09:14,259
you people

181
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:16,739
keep showing up to remind me

182
00:09:17,819 --> 00:09:19,660
just how disgusting

183
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:22,460
the Tan family is.

184
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,899
I knew Tan Group was a swamp
that devours people,

185
00:09:45,419 --> 00:09:46,578
yet I still jumped into

186
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:48,420
such a crude and obvious trap.

187
00:09:53,819 --> 00:09:55,460
Things always have a turning point.

188
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,698
I don't think Tan Jianfei

189
00:09:57,699 --> 00:09:59,739
will become someone like Tan Zheng'en.

190
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,979
Maybe

191
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,820
there's more to this.

192
00:10:02,939 --> 00:10:04,019
Why should I bother guessing

193
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:05,540
what cards a family of devils
is holding?

194
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:09,619
If the ending is destined to destroy me,

195
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,899
then the only difference is
whether I burn myself to ashes

196
00:10:12,819 --> 00:10:14,660
or someone else burns me down.

197
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:23,899
(Tan Jianfei)
(2:00 PM, café.)

198
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,660
What more does he want to explain?

199
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:33,460
(Lin Xi)
(Where are you? Dinner tonight.)

200
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,540
(It really is just dinner.)

201
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,220
I'll go sound out Tan Jianfei first.

202
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,660
As for you,

203
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,700
mind your boundaries.
