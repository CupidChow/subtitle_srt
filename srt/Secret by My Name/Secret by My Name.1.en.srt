1
00:00:20,168 --> 00:00:21,228
(Tan Group.)

2
00:00:21,447 --> 00:00:24,347
(Eight years ago,
you brought my family to ruin.)

3
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,468
(Are you ready to settle the score?)

4
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:37,507
Father.

5
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:41,068
(From this moment on,)

6
00:00:41,462 --> 00:00:42,961
(everything here)

7
00:00:43,168 --> 00:00:44,907
(belongs to the Tan Group.)

8
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,227
From today onward,

9
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:51,867
you are nothing more than an outcast.

10
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,148
An outcast,

11
00:00:54,450 --> 00:00:56,589
left to survive on scraps.

12
00:00:58,607 --> 00:00:59,988
Mr. Tan.

13
00:01:00,647 --> 00:01:02,148
It is time to collect the interest.

14
00:01:16,912 --> 00:01:18,619
=Secret By My Name=

15
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,211
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

16
00:01:21,212 --> 00:01:22,166
=Episode 1=

17
00:01:22,167 --> 00:01:24,806
This suit is our department's
latest design.

18
00:01:24,807 --> 00:01:27,206
It uses the most popular
striped elements of the moment.

19
00:01:27,207 --> 00:01:29,307
A design this drawn out,

20
00:01:30,048 --> 00:01:32,227
are you trying to make
the Tan Group a laughingstock?

21
00:01:34,328 --> 00:01:36,420
Do not try to brush me off
with this kind of work again.

22
00:01:45,007 --> 00:01:46,548
Or you can leave the Tan Group.

23
00:01:46,968 --> 00:01:47,708
Do you understand?

24
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:49,566
Speak.

25
00:01:49,567 --> 00:01:50,366
Did you understand?

26
00:01:50,367 --> 00:01:51,708
I understand.

27
00:01:54,768 --> 00:01:55,446
Fei.

28
00:01:55,447 --> 00:01:56,268
Fei.

29
00:01:57,688 --> 00:01:58,908
Do not be anxious.

30
00:01:59,287 --> 00:02:00,726
Design work like this

31
00:02:00,727 --> 00:02:02,286
needs time to be refined.

32
00:02:02,287 --> 00:02:03,327
You know that.

33
00:02:03,328 --> 00:02:05,867
Change the peak lapel
to a lightweight double breasted lapel.

34
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:07,867
Raise the waistline by two centimeters.

35
00:02:25,248 --> 00:02:27,668
Replace the gold plated buttons
with obsidian buttons.

36
00:02:41,767 --> 00:02:44,228
As for this moldy lining,

37
00:02:49,487 --> 00:02:53,828
if President Wang tries it on himself,
it would actually suit him quite well.

38
00:02:53,848 --> 00:02:55,708
So it was you.

39
00:02:56,088 --> 00:02:57,886
Miss Li, eight years ago,

40
00:02:57,887 --> 00:03:00,307
you were driven out in disgrace.

41
00:03:00,848 --> 00:03:02,446
And now you still have the nerve

42
00:03:02,447 --> 00:03:04,067
to come back and show your face.

43
00:03:04,887 --> 00:03:07,027
Mr. Wang, your memory seems rather poor.

44
00:03:11,928 --> 00:03:13,166
When you were overseas last week

45
00:03:13,167 --> 00:03:15,527
and lost two rosewood production lines,

46
00:03:15,528 --> 00:03:17,606
the way you knelt
and begged your creditors for mercy

47
00:03:17,607 --> 00:03:19,508
was far more sincere
than anything you show now.

48
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:23,148
You swore you would
repay everything within one month.

49
00:03:23,167 --> 00:03:24,087
Make a sound like a dog,

50
00:03:24,088 --> 00:03:25,828
and I will let you leave today.

51
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:27,747
Woof.

52
00:03:29,248 --> 00:03:30,347
Woof, woof.

53
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:32,708
You... Give that back to me.

54
00:03:50,887 --> 00:03:53,967
Mr. Wang is now perfectly suited
to endorse Tan Group's new product line.

55
00:03:53,968 --> 00:03:56,548
After all,
the theme of predatory capital

56
00:03:56,808 --> 00:03:59,027
is something you portray effortlessly.

57
00:04:00,047 --> 00:04:00,967
Security.

58
00:04:00,968 --> 00:04:02,067
Someone come here.

59
00:04:02,167 --> 00:04:02,967
Security.

60
00:04:02,968 --> 00:04:05,307
Get this woman out of here.

61
00:04:08,368 --> 00:04:09,587
Get out.

62
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:22,027
You should never have come back.

63
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:25,268
I came back this time
to take a few things.

64
00:04:25,768 --> 00:04:27,027
Your power.

65
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:28,907
His life.

66
00:04:29,848 --> 00:04:30,948
And also,

67
00:04:34,528 --> 00:04:36,667
the thing you hold every night
when you sleep.

68
00:04:39,008 --> 00:04:40,708
My old school uniform.

69
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:48,900
(Tan Group)

70
00:04:49,888 --> 00:04:52,880
I am very pleased to work with all of you
to create a brilliant future together.

71
00:04:53,047 --> 00:04:54,227
I appreciate your support.

72
00:04:58,212 --> 00:04:59,072
Li Shujing.

73
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,805
You went to great lengths
to stage all of this.

74
00:05:03,448 --> 00:05:04,628
Did you really think

75
00:05:05,848 --> 00:05:07,427
this would get you into the Tan Group?

76
00:05:13,968 --> 00:05:18,227
Li Shujing's consulting agreement

77
00:05:20,607 --> 00:05:21,948
was signed

78
00:05:22,848 --> 00:05:24,007
by me personally.

79
00:05:24,008 --> 00:05:26,547
Mr. Tan disappeared for two years,
and has finally reappeared.

80
00:05:31,408 --> 00:05:33,388
An agreement signed by the dead

81
00:05:33,807 --> 00:05:35,427
is overruled by rules set by the living.

82
00:05:36,848 --> 00:05:38,427
From today onward,

83
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:41,587
every single stitch of
the Autumn Winter Alpine Collection

84
00:05:42,127 --> 00:05:44,107
will follow my rules.

85
00:06:11,408 --> 00:06:12,587
We are not going home yet.

86
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:14,787
We are going somewhere else.

87
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,347
Eight years.

88
00:06:39,487 --> 00:06:41,547
And all you learned was
how to burn discarded drafts.

89
00:06:43,367 --> 00:06:45,308
When you bit through
my collarbone back then,

90
00:06:46,167 --> 00:06:47,828
you were far more ruthless
than you are now.

91
00:06:49,927 --> 00:06:52,347
I am designing funeral invitations
for the Tan Group.

92
00:06:53,208 --> 00:06:54,467
The main image

93
00:06:55,088 --> 00:06:57,547
should be the bite mark
on your collarbone. What do you think?

94
00:06:58,047 --> 00:06:59,667
After all, this is the Tan Group's

95
00:06:59,968 --> 00:07:01,748
only thing that was ever real.

96
00:07:04,687 --> 00:07:06,246
Instead of burning these useless drafts,

97
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:07,667
you might as well burn me.

98
00:07:08,167 --> 00:07:10,347
That was your plan
eight years ago anyway.

99
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,547
Back then, you were a truant teenager.

100
00:07:13,648 --> 00:07:16,188
Now, you are the president
of the Tan Group.

101
00:07:17,127 --> 00:07:19,027
It does make me feel

102
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,188
more accomplished than before.

103
00:07:26,448 --> 00:07:28,347
Then this time,
remember to change the knot.

104
00:07:28,687 --> 00:07:30,667
The bow you tied back then

105
00:07:31,008 --> 00:07:32,547
was far too easy to break free from.

106
00:08:03,127 --> 00:08:04,068
Li Shujing.

107
00:08:04,687 --> 00:08:07,447
Every sheet of paper you burn here
proves that you still cannot forget

108
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:08,567
the fool who willingly let you

109
00:08:08,568 --> 00:08:09,868
tie him up back then.

110
00:08:10,328 --> 00:08:11,427
But let me make this clear.

111
00:08:12,888 --> 00:08:14,308
The Tan Group today

112
00:08:14,768 --> 00:08:17,068
has no room
for two living corpses in its coffin.

113
00:08:17,607 --> 00:08:19,606
You do not seriously think
that in these eight years

114
00:08:19,607 --> 00:08:21,628
all I learned was how to mourn, do you?

115
00:08:24,807 --> 00:08:26,107
Look closely.

116
00:08:26,367 --> 00:08:28,868
I carved my own tombstone long ago

117
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,907
into climbing pitons.

118
00:08:31,127 --> 00:08:32,508
So tell me,

119
00:08:32,648 --> 00:08:35,188
from which floor of the Tan Group

120
00:08:35,927 --> 00:08:37,647
will the sound of bones and lies

121
00:08:37,648 --> 00:08:39,468
shattering together
be loud enough to hear?

122
00:08:42,808 --> 00:08:44,547
Then take your pitons

123
00:08:44,688 --> 00:08:45,988
and move into the top floor.

124
00:08:46,288 --> 00:08:48,388
After all, the teeth that once
bit through my collarbone

125
00:08:48,808 --> 00:08:51,667
were never meant to belong
to a well behaved girl.
