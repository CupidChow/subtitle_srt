Tan Jianfei!

14
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,819
I called you, but you didn't answer.

15
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:01,218
Good thing I rushed over.

16
00:02:01,219 --> 00:02:02,980
Your fever's hit forty degrees.

17
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,099

A bad woman like me

21
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,300
has a tough life.

22
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,180
Don't talk about yourself like that.

23
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:36,659
The videotape...

24
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,859
Can we still find a backup?

25
00:02:45,619 --> 00:02:47,060
Tan Jianfei...

26
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,020
You were dreaming last night,

27
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,340
calling his name over and over.

28
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,500
That won't happen again.

29
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,294
Throw it away.

30
00:03:49,219 --> 00:03:50,939
Do we really have to go this far?

31
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:53,139
When I was twelve,

32
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,939
he taught me how to mix pigments.

33
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:57,580
He said

34
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,099
black has to be mixed with blood

35
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,099
to achieve the purest darkness.

36
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:14,979
You forced my hand.

37
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,938
The legendary Vice Chairman Zhao
has actually returned from overseas.

38
00:04:20,939 --> 00:04:22,960
Watch what you point at.
Do you want to lose your job?

39
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,939
Where is Li Shujing?

40
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,340
She seems to be in the design studio.

41
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,380
Seems?

42
00:04:30,739 --> 00:04:33,140
If I hear the word "seems" again,

43
00:04:33,412 --> 00:04:35,072
you won't need to come back.

44
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,380
I hear the company's
hired a new designer.

45
00:04:46,539 --> 00:04:48,619
Quite something, apparently.

46
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,780
Stirring the whole place into chaos.

47
00:04:52,219 --> 00:04:54,139
I've long heard
that the Vice Chairman Zhao

48
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,880
who oversees
overseas operations is well-known.

49
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,900
So young, yet already so high up.

50
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,020
I'm nothing compared to that.

51
00:05:02,179 --> 00:05:03,299
Compared to me,

52
00:05:03,779 --> 00:05:05,140
you're simply not worthy.

53
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:07,179
As for our team,

54
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,780
there's no room for random nobodies.

55
00:05:09,979 --> 00:05:11,538
You'd better learn

56
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,739
how to be an obedient tailor.

57
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:14,940
Understand?

58
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,539
And if I don't?

59
00:05:17,219 --> 00:05:18,499
Simple.

60
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:21,220
Then I'll make you understand.

61
00:05:29,425 --> 00:05:33,819
(Mijing Club)

62
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,098
So the famous Young Chairman Tan

63
00:05:36,099 --> 00:05:37,978
is sneaking drinks here,

64
00:05:37,979 --> 00:05:39,419
honey whiskey, of all things.

65
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,178
That sweet of a taste

66
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:42,619
doesn't look like the pastime

67
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:43,899
of someone who just got slapped.

68
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,739
Didn't you keep an eye
on your little lapdog,

69
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,840
so you came to watch me
make a fool of myself?

70
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,099
You look like you've
got plenty of time too.

71
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,899
Too bad that lapdog

72
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,099
has nothing on his mind
but those pieces of evidence.

73
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:59,059
It's three in the morning
and he's still replaying surveillance footage.

74
00:05:59,219 --> 00:06:01,820
All he ever thinks about
is helping Li Shujing dig up proof.

75
00:06:02,287 --> 00:06:03,580
How boring.

76
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,670
Isn't Li Shujing his sister?

77
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:11,619
Didn't expect Young Chairman Tan
to be this naive.

78
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:14,340
They're not even related by blood.

79
00:06:14,859 --> 00:06:16,338
Between a man and a woman,

80
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,260
there's no such thing
as pure friendship.

81
00:06:29,419 --> 00:06:30,139
Shujing.

82
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,099
Stay away from me.

83
00:06:34,219 --> 00:06:36,059
You think Zhao Rou
is only here for power?

84
00:06:36,219 --> 00:06:37,658
She's far more dangerous than that.

85
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,619
So what?

86
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:41,140
You want me to kneel
and beg for your help?

87
00:06:43,419 --> 00:06:45,059
Shujing, can you calm down for a second?

88
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,259
Who was it that casually burned

89
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,940
the evidence I worked so hard to get?

90
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:50,419
And now you're pretending to care?

91
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,340
If you can't make her
leave the Tan Group right now,

92
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:56,178
then stop acting concerned
in front of me.

93
00:06:56,179 --> 00:06:57,700
So all this time,

94
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:01,099
I was just a tool for your revenge
against the Tan Group?

95
00:07:01,419 --> 00:07:02,499
A tool?

96
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,140
I've always relied on myself.

97
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:09,900
But then I trusted you.

98
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:11,580
What did I get in return?

99
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:15,139
You turned eight years of my effort

100
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,979
into a complete joke.

101
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:19,178
Shujing.

102
00:07:19,179 --> 00:07:20,580
- Let go of me!
- Listen to me.

103
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,340
Get out.

104
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,460
You...

105
00:07:24,539 --> 00:07:26,659
I said get out, right now.
Did you hear me?

106
00:07:28,219 --> 00:07:29,260
Let's go, Yusheng.

107
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,419
The fabric shipment is settled.

108
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,218
Based on the people you remembered,

109
00:07:45,219 --> 00:07:47,579
those tied to Wang Jinkai
and Zhao Youcai,

110
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,658
along with the names in our new ledger,

111
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:50,900
none of them refused.

112
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:53,619
I knew it.

113
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:56,499
The Tan Group is rotten
from top to bottom.

114
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,820
Even if they all went to hell,

115
00:07:59,299 --> 00:08:01,220
very few would be innocent.

116
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:05,020
Without securing the videotape
Wang Jinkai left behind,

117
00:08:05,350 --> 00:08:07,499
we're still missing a critical piece.

118
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,780
For now, all we can prove

119
00:08:09,975 --> 00:08:11,255
is that they're all involved.

120
00:08:11,419 --> 00:08:13,580
But to uncover the truth
about Uncle Li back then,

121
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,820
we'll need another approach.

122
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,859
They were all working
for Tan Zheng'en anyway.

123
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,899
Dragging them down together

124
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,099
is already enough.

125
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:25,739
As for what happened to Dad back then,

126
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:27,819
I think I need to go back

127
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,419
to where it all began and investigate.

128
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,819
You mean

129
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:32,340
you're going to the factory yourself?

130
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,659
That's too dangerous.

131
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,940
No matter how dangerous that place is,

132
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,899
I'm going in.

133
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,499
Then promise me,

134
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,139
if anything comes up,
tell me right away.

135
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:46,619
