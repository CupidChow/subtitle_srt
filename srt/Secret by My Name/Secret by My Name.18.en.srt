1
00:00:05,975 --> 00:00:09,532
(Tan Group)

2
00:00:17,579 --> 00:00:19,258
Ms. Li, you may not be tall,

3
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,659
but you have a strong presence.

4
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,419
You couldn't care less about rules
when entering your superior's office.

5
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:28,220
Rules are meant for people
who deserve them.

6
00:00:28,459 --> 00:00:30,660
Not for a cold-blooded capitalist
like you.

7
00:00:31,299 --> 00:00:32,340
Tan Jianfei.

8
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:34,419
I really want to cut your heart open

9
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,059
and see just how black it is.

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,220
Go on.

11
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:44,780
Be my guest.

12
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,220
Tan Jianfei.

13
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,938
I do not have time for

14
00:00:47,939 --> 00:00:49,500
these childish power games.

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:52,899
You'd better take a look
at these Tan Group files.

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:54,979
See exactly
what Tan Group has been doing.

17
00:01:09,737 --> 00:01:11,186
(Labor Arbitration Rulings)

18
00:01:11,187 --> 00:01:12,832
(Layoff List)

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,218
Where did you get these?

20
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,019
What?

21
00:01:18,419 --> 00:01:20,900
Planning to track down these victims

22
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:22,500
and drive them to death again?

23
00:01:24,059 --> 00:01:27,299
Tan Group is a corporation of this scale,
yet it shortchanges workers' compensation.

24
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:29,099
If this gets out,

25
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,579
do you think Tan Group's stock price
will survive?

26
00:01:31,699 --> 00:01:34,299
And once these materials are exposed,

27
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,698
who knows what else will be dragged out
from behind Tan Group?

28
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:37,780
For example,

29
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,980
Tan Group has been deliberately shifting
business lines and assets.

30
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:42,579
I will handle this.

31
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,780
You just do your job

32
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,819
and stay out of everything else.

33
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,138
On the day the shrine collapsed,

34
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:51,739
the gods turned their backs on me,

35
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,498
yet they left me these hands

36
00:01:53,499 --> 00:01:55,019
to deliver judgment upon you.

37
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,780
If I don't intervene,

38
00:01:57,339 --> 00:01:59,019
would I not be betraying the gods?

39
00:02:00,419 --> 00:02:02,220
Tan Jianfei, choose your path wisely.

40
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:07,019
You think you are chasing
the truth of the past,

41
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,700
but it's just a minor reflecting the cracks
in the human heart.

42
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:11,780
When the reflection

43
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
begins to consume the one it mirrors,

44
00:02:16,539 --> 00:02:18,020
even your cries for help

45
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:21,060
will be swallowed into the void.

46
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:27,699
You, and everyone around you,

47
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:30,180
will be swallowed whole.

48
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:33,259
Never to see the daylight again.

49
00:02:38,312 --> 00:02:39,320
(1872662330)

50
00:02:41,779 --> 00:02:42,580
Hello?

51
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:44,218
Is this Designer Li?

52
00:02:44,219 --> 00:02:45,139
This is Master Zhao.

53
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:46,379
Hello, Master Zhao. What is it?

54
00:02:46,659 --> 00:02:49,139
Could you ask around with the board

55
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:51,740
why they have the right
to shut down our Chuangyang Factory?

56
00:02:52,059 --> 00:02:55,579
The factory did lose money
for a few quarters,

57
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,498
but things have turned around.

58
00:02:57,499 --> 00:02:59,580
We're a model factory in the city.

59
00:02:59,659 --> 00:03:01,220
Please don't worry, Master Zhao.

60
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,580
I'll submit an application to the board

61
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,640
and see if the old factory zone
can be reopened.

62
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,500
Alright, alright.

63
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,500
You knew about this long ago,
didn't you?

64
00:03:11,219 --> 00:03:12,498
Mr. Tan, you're so busy.

65
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:14,780
Yet you still found time
to seal the old factory zone.

66
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,058
Was it to cover up

67
00:03:16,059 --> 00:03:17,899
the disgraceful,

68
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:20,220
filthy past of Tan family?

69
00:03:20,779 --> 00:03:21,659
Li Shujing,

70
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,338
be reasonable.

71
00:03:23,339 --> 00:03:24,299
I never wanted

72
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,538
to hide the truth.

73
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:25,979
I just...

74
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:26,900
Just what?

75
00:03:27,819 --> 00:03:28,938
Just that Tan Group

76
00:03:28,939 --> 00:03:30,259
will forever remain

77
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,819
a gray zone the sun never reaches?

78
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:33,859
(This matter)

79
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,440
(was definitely not proposed
by the board.)

80
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,419
(It must have been someone)

81
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:38,360
(with power great enough
to go over the board's head)

82
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,920
(who made this decision unilaterally.)

83
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,379
(If I tell Shujing,)

84
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,859
(will she be in danger
if she keeps digging?)

85
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,659
Tell the employees of the old factory

86
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,579
that I will represent the board
and handle this as soon as possible.

87
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:55,338
What? My mother heard this morning
that the factory was shutting down,

88
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,580
and she ran out?

89
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:58,020
Yes, Ms. Li.

90
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:00,658
The moment she heard the news report,
she completely lost control.

91
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,259
The three of us
couldn't catch up to her.

92
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,419
Try to stay calm.

93
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,200
Check the surveillance first.
I'm on my way.

94
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:05,740
Okay.

95
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:09,139
I'll go with you to look for her.

96
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:11,580
Tan Jianfei,

97
00:04:12,059 --> 00:04:13,859
this had better have nothing
to do with you.

98
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,218
I don't want my mom

99
00:04:15,219 --> 00:04:16,780
to ever be used as leverage again.

100
00:04:17,499 --> 00:04:18,939
Stay away from us.

101
00:04:40,362 --> 00:04:41,619
=Secret By My Name=

102
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:43,336
(Adapted from the novel
Hotpot Loves Tangyuan by Ye Yijian)

103
00:04:43,337 --> 00:04:46,457
=Episode 18=

104
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,179
My mom is missing.

105
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,580
I lost my mom.

106
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:01,539
No.

107
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,859
Mrs. Li wouldn't just disappear.

108
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:04,460
We'll find her together.

109
00:05:04,539 --> 00:05:06,820
I've searched the entire hospital.

110
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:08,499
I checked the cameras too.

111
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,700
She ran out by herself

112
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:13,780
and was never captured again.

113
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,858
It's quiet near the hospital.

114
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,579
There aren't many cars passing through.
She couldn't have gone far.

115
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:22,619
Let's keep looking together.
We'll find her.

116
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,059
We have to find Mrs. Li
before nightfall.

117
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:26,939
Shujing,

118
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,539
search around the care center.

119
00:05:28,779 --> 00:05:29,499
Yusheng,

120
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,460
let's think where else Mrs. Li
might have gone.

121
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:33,738
Somewhere farther from the hospital.
We'll split up.

122
00:05:33,739 --> 00:05:35,020
We will find her.

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,298
This had better not be
another Tan Group scheme.

124
00:05:42,299 --> 00:05:42,978
How many lives

125
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:44,780
are they planning to destroy?

126
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:49,139
(Tan Group...)

127
00:05:49,140 --> 00:05:51,059
(What exactly are they plotting?)

128
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,659
(Zhao Rou already died
for the overseas division.)

129
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,220
(Could it be that the mess
still hasn't been cleaned up?)

130
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,419
(Could the next one to be sacrificed)

131
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,900
(be me?)

132
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,218
Be careful.

133
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:05,780
I know you're anxious,

134
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,900
but don't get hurt

135
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,979
at a time like this.

136
00:06:09,299 --> 00:06:10,179
Don't worry.

137
00:06:14,339 --> 00:06:15,059
(Yes.)

138
00:06:15,659 --> 00:06:16,820
(Tan Group)

139
00:06:16,859 --> 00:06:18,340
(is not worth risking myself for.)

140
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,539
Mom!

141
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:32,580
Mom!

142
00:06:38,099 --> 00:06:38,940
Mr. Tan.

143
00:06:39,179 --> 00:06:40,260
We got the thing.

144
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,140
That person has left.

145
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,218
Mr. Tan.

146
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,299
I don't understand.

147
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,418
Why meet out here

148
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:49,900
in the middle of nowhere

149
00:06:50,179 --> 00:06:51,940
when we have big offices?

150
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:54,460
Walls have ears.

151
00:06:54,779 --> 00:06:55,820
We can't be too careless.

152
00:06:57,779 --> 00:06:59,179
Go back and keep investigating.

153
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:01,900
Find out who approved the proposal
to shut down the old factory zone.

154
00:07:02,179 --> 00:07:03,619
So what does that make me now?

155
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:05,099
A figurehead?

156
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,260
Stripped of real power?

157
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:07,380
Yes.

158
00:07:07,419 --> 00:07:08,658
The board

159
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,979
seems to be under a pair of invisible hands.

160
00:07:11,579 --> 00:07:13,120
I'll get to the bottom of it
as soon as possible.

161
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,780
Could someone be forming factions

162
00:07:14,859 --> 00:07:16,659
or manipulating procedures in secret?

163
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:19,900
(You, and everyone around you,)

164
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:23,299
(will be swallowed into the void.)

165
00:07:24,299 --> 00:07:26,419
(Never to see the daylight again.)

166
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,978
(Tan Group has been shifting)

167
00:07:29,979 --> 00:07:31,780
(production lines and assets overseas.)

168
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:34,179
(Who's really behind all this?)

169
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:35,659
(Not Zhao Rou.)

170
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:37,659
(Not Tan Zuoyan.)

171
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:39,059
(Could it be...)

172
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,380
Why are you here?

173
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:47,140
Where did you hide my mom?

174
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,619
Shujing.

175
00:07:49,859 --> 00:07:50,619
Believe me.

176
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:52,140
I have nothing to do with this.

177
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,580
I drove around nearby.

178
00:07:55,859 --> 00:07:57,059
I couldn't find your mom either.

179
00:07:57,419 --> 00:07:59,140
You warned me just moments ago,

180
00:07:59,339 --> 00:08:00,979
and my mom disappeared right after.

181
00:08:00,979 --> 00:08:02,520
You really expect me to believe
that was a coincidence?

182
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,299
I do.

183
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:06,900
From beginning to end,

184
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,059
I never once meant to hurt you

185
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,340
or your family.

186
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,900
Tan Jianfei,

187
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,739
you're never satisfied
with just waiting.

188
00:08:15,539 --> 00:08:16,858
You always acted on them,

189
00:08:16,859 --> 00:08:17,739
didn't you?

190
00:08:18,219 --> 00:08:19,780
You drove my father to his death

191
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:21,220
and pushed my mother into madness.

192
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,940
She's barely a shattered soul now.

193
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:26,738
And you won't even leave me

194
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,124
that fragile body to hold on to?

195
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,338
♪Have you ever heard that?♪

196

are in your hands.

198
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,739
If you refuse to believe me,

199
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,420
then sentence me to death.

200
00:08:40,912 --> 00:08:45,698
♪I refuse to behave♪

201
00:08:45,699 --> 00:08:47,480
What gives them the right
to treat us like this?

202
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,619
Why?

203
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:51,139
We gave them everything we had.

204
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:55,499
They killed Li, and now they're coming
for me and my daughter.

205
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:57,800
- The factory was our lifeline!
- Mrs. Li. Why did you run out here?

206
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:58,298
Why?

207
00:08:58,299 --> 00:08:59,298
- Mrs. Li.
- Why?

208
00:08:59,299 --> 00:09:00,820
Jing told you
to go home for dinner.

209
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:02,139
Jing...

210
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,180
Jing.

211
00:09:03,699 --> 00:09:04,820
My daughter.

212
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:06,938
Jing is my daughter.

213
00:09:06,939 --> 00:09:07,698
Yes.

214
00:09:07,699 --> 00:09:08,339
She said

215
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,139
you're the best mother in the world.

216
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,139
Who are you?

217
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,619
I...

218
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,458
I know.

219
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:17,540
You are...

220
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:20,099
You're Jing's boyfriend.

221
00:09:20,939 --> 00:09:22,538
I saw your photo

222
00:09:22,539 --> 00:09:24,019
in her notebook.

223
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,899
She must

224
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,340
like you very much.

225
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:27,979
She likes me?

226
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,700
What's your name?

227
00:09:35,459 --> 00:09:35,938
Mrs. Li,

228
00:09:35,939 --> 00:09:37,340
my name is Tan Jianfei.

229

No.

230
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:42,619
You're not human.

231
00:09:42,719 --> 00:09:44,460
You're the venomous snake
from the Tan family.

232
00:09:44,837 --> 00:09:46,619
You're going to...
You're going to kill us!

233
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:47,178
No. No. No.

234
00:09:47,179 --> 00:09:48,259
No, no, no.

235
00:09:48,299 --> 00:09:49,899
I won't let you hurt Jing.

236
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,099
I'll kill you.

237
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:51,938
I'll kill you!

238
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:52,458
Mrs. Li.
