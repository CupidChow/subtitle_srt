=Episode 5=

3
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:27,920
Why are you running?

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:30,120
My Lord,

5
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,800
please spare my life.

6
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
I swear,

7
00:00:33,400 --> 00:00:34,760
I will not say anything.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,640
I'd rather

9
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,000
have your soul scattered than believe you.

10
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,640
Once and for all.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,840
I set up the Spiritual Lock Barrier

12
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,640
and sealed your heart meridians
with the 10,000-year-old ice silk.

13
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,080
Without circulation, the Heaven-overturning Mark

14
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,260
will gradually dry up in seven days.

15
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:56,560
The Immortal Lord is
in a closed-door cultivation.

16
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,080
No visitors are allowed in the next seven days.

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,020
(Qingxu Realm)

18
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,440
Mo Chenyuan is in
a closed-door cultivation for seven days.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,160
It's the perfect time for us to take action.

20
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,440
Feng Ruoyao really has no magic power anymore?

21
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,400
Last time when I fought her,

22
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,760
I found that her power

23
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
all came from the bracelet on her wrist.

24
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,960
Without the bracelet,

25
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:34,720
she'll be completely defenseless.

26
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,560
She can't even beat an ordinary fairy maid.

27
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,880
Good.

28
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:40,920
Let's take this chance

29
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,800
to get rid of Feng Ruoyao first.

30
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:50,220
Mo Chenyuan is so sly.

31
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,260
I refused to help him lift the mark,

32
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,740
so he's avoiding me

33
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,180
on the excuse of closed-door cultivation.

34
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,300
I guess this story has to end in tragedy.

35
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,620
I feel so disturbed right now.

36
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:06,020
I can't come up with a good ending.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:10,580
What are you doing here?

38
00:02:21,500 --> 00:02:23,860
Haven't you learned enough
from the destruction of your whip?

39
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,940
It seems that I'll have

40
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,460
to teach you a lesson in person today.

41
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,340
(The Immortal Lord is My Sweet Puppy,
by Xiaoxiao Sheng)

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,340
Xiaoxiao Sheng.

43
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,780
Feng Ruoyao,

44
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,620
what's your excuse this time?

45
00:02:45,740 --> 00:02:46,780
So what?

46
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,700
Drop the act.

47
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,500
Just stand up.

48
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,460
There is no one else here.

49
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,380
Help!

50
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:08,260
Help!

51
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,700
Feng Ruoyao.

52
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,220
Xinlan.

53
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,420
Feng Ruoyao, what did you do to Xinlan?

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,260
You came so quickly.

55
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:22,460
Looks like

56
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,100
you planned it very well.

57
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,380
Our child.

58
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:31,020
Our child is gone.

59
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:35,300
You demon witch.

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,940
Arrest her.

61
00:03:37,380 --> 00:03:38,220
Today,

62
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,180
I'll let her pay for my child's death.

63
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
(The bracelet is broken.)

64
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,220
(Oh, no.)

65
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,060
(Feng Ruoyao must be in trouble.)

66
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,780
In the next seven days,

67
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,340
you must not use your magic power.

68
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,020
Otherwise, the mark will hurt you,

69
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,020
damage your heart meridians,

70
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:00,980
penetrate your lungs,

71
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,580
and it can never be removed.

72
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,900
(No.)

73
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,220
(She has no magic power.)

74
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,780
(I must get out and help her.)

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,940
It's the rule of the Qingxu Realm.

76
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:27,260
Unforgivable sinners

77
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,220
must be killed by the Marrow-cleansing Whip.

78
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:34,260
Marrow-cleansing Whip is used
for removing tendons, cleaning your soul,

79
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:35,980
and exorcising evil.

80
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:40,300
It's created for killing
a heinous demon witch like you especially.

81
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,340
Kill the demon witch!

82
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:43,300
Kill the demon witch! Kill the demon witch!

83
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,740
You think I grew up in fear?

84
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:49,540
If I die here today,

85
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:50,940
our Demon Clan

86
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,980
will definitely wipe out your Qingxu Realm.

87
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,660

You are dying.

94
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,220
I don't think you can take one more strike.

95

Why don't you kneel and beg me for your life?

96

97
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,220
