00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,700
My favorite thing

4
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:21,380
is not to watch fireworks,

5
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:23,660
but to watch them with you.

6
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:28,100
I know.

7
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:38,180
Passing through the calamity
in the Mortal World was like a dream.

8
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:43,740
I thought when you became
the Immortal Lord again,

9
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:46,740
you wouldn't care about
what happened to us in the Mortal World.

10
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:52,340
How can I not care about

11
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,820
everything I've been through with you?

12
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:13,980
(Penglai Immortal Pavilion)

13
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:14,900
So beautiful!

14
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:16,780
Every day from now on,

15
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,260
you'll enjoy with me

16
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:21,860
the full-blown flowers

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:23,740
and the bright stars.

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:26,700
Do you like it?

19
00:01:32,860 --> 00:01:33,700
Mo Chenyuan,

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:37,100
have I ever

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:39,500
said a serious word to you?

22
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,220
I love you,

23
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,860
really, really love you.

24
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,260
(I love you too,)

25
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,900
(Feng Ruoyao.)

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,340
Haoli,

27
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,380
come back to the Lingxiao Sect with me.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,540
My parents will take us in.

29
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:42,140
Our immortal roots have been severed

30
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:43,580
and we've lost our magic power!

31
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:46,420
Do we have to find shelter there
for the rest of our lives?

32
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,780
Then where can we go?

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:52,860
The Xuanming Realm has a wide variety
of evil magic arts.

34
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,820
There must be a chance for us
to regain our power.

35
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:56,780
No.

36
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:58,540
We are immortal cultivators.

37
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,580
How can we learn evil magic arts?

38
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,460
Haoli,

39
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,540
don't go to the Xuanming Realm.
I'm scared.

40
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,820
As long as I can trample Mo Chenyuan
under my feet,

41
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,980
not to mention the Xuanming Realm,

42
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:17,220
I'll even go to hell.

43
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,940
Xinlan,

44
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:20,500
one day,

45
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:24,940
I promise you'll be more honorable than
the Immortal Lady of the Qingxu Realm.

46
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:46,020
Be patient, everyone.

47
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,420
One by one, everyone gets a share.

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,240
Your Ladyship,

49
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,620
it's hard for us
to seek sweetness in hardships.

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,380
Could you write more sweet scenes?

51
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:56,980
Do you all like sweet scenes?

52
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,060
Yes.

53
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:58,900
Sure.

54
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,820
In that case,

55
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,460
one spiritual stone for 1,000 words.

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,420
Welcome to order.

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,380
I want to read kissing scenes.

58
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,700
I want to read night naughty scenes.

59
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,860
Two spiritual stones for you to change
the night scenes into daytime scenes.

60
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,460
Two spiritual stones.

61
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,260
OK, don't rush. One by one.

62
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,740
I'll try my best to satisfy everyone.

63
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:17,900
OK, next one.

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,820
Your Ladyship,
I want to read naughty scenes.

65
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,100
OK.

66
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,300
Wow.

67
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,420
The immortal maids in the Qingxu Realm

68
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:45,180
are all open and bold.

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm rich!

70
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,140
What are you writing?

71
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:50,100
Nothing, give it back!

72
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,820
Give it back to me.

73
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,260
Why don't you want me to read it
if there's nothing?

74
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,460
Honey.

75
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:02,860
Do you have to go?

76
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:07,900
You are no longer a match for me.

77
00:05:08,420 --> 00:05:09,260
There's

78
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:11,420
no need for me to stay.

79
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:12,660
Honey.

80
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,620
Honey.

81
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,180
You are only focused on cultivation.

82
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,180
Can't you

83
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,980
feel my heart?

84
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,300
In my heart,

85
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,580
there are never such useless things.

86
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,470
Honey,

87
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:29,580
you are the only one I care about.

88
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:30,820
My duty

89
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,300
is to unify the Three Realms.

90
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,860
People of different moral convictions
cannot get along.

91
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:34,700
There's

92
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,220
no chance of us.

93
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:41,500
Honey,

94
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,540
I swear to heaven.

95
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:47,400
I'm willing to give up my position
as the Immortal Lord

96
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:50,900
to be with you

97
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,740
for the rest of my life.

98
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:58,860
But I'm the Demon Lady
of the Xuanming Realm.

99
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,020
Throughout my life,

100
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,900
I can't marry you.

101
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,300
Honey.

102
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:17,500
I'll marry you.

103
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:20,860
I'll marry you.

104
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,140
What

105
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:28,780
did you say?

106
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,290
I said

107
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,060
I'm willing to give up

108
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:36,020
my position as the Immortal Lord

109
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,780
to be with you

110
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,960
for the rest of my life.

111
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:43,540
Even if the earth and heaven get old,

112
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,820
I'll never let you down.

113
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:00,100
You know,

114
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,580
sometimes the Demon Clan

115
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,420
will make money by fair means or foul.

116
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,460
Your Ladyship's means

117
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:09,260
are truly extraordinary.

118
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:13,740
I didn't do any of the things

119
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,180
in your book,

120
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:17,660
but you've made a fortune from it.

121
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:19,780
It's unfair, isn't it?

122
00:07:20,820 --> 00:07:22,540
So, what do you want?

123
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,180
I'll get half of the money you earn.

124
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:27,980
No way.

125
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:29,660
I worked so hard

126
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:32,260
to write all the words in the book.

127
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,860
I won't let you work hard alone.

128
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,860
I don't know how to write a book.

129
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,540
But I can

130
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,220
do something else.

131
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,460
Mo Chenyuan,

132
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,020
let go of me.

133
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:54,420
Zixia and the others are watching us.

134
00:07:55,700 --> 00:07:57,340
Oh my, official display of affection.

135
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:59,140
They're going to drive the fans crazy.

136
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,940
Ship them!

137
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,700
I know.

138
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,060
Official display of affection.

139
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,380
I never thought

140
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:09,180
you are such an Immortal Lord.

141
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:14,980
Isn't it good to double your sales?

142
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,220
Oh my, official display of affection.

143
00:08:31,540 --> 00:08:33,140
They're going to drive the fans crazy.

144
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,100
Oh, no.

145
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,220
His Lordship is annoying.

146
00:08:40,380 --> 00:08:41,900
He never lets us watch
the critical moments.

147
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,420
I bet one spiritual stone.

148
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:45,020
I'm sure it'll be in the next issue.

149
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:46,060
I'll make a purchase.

150
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,740
Me too.

151
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:50,900
You're doing it on purpose.

152
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:51,820
Hmph!

153
00:08:58,980 --> 00:08:59,860
What do you think?

154
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,820
I know

155
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,620
you think I make things up

156
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,860
and make money using you.

157
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,420
Then what's the reason?

158
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:11,740
I am regretful.

159
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,300
You've looked forward to many things,

160
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:14,580
but I haven't done anything.

161
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,940
It's not true.

162
00:09:21,620 --> 00:09:22,500
It's OK.

163
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:23,820
From now on,

164
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,900
I'll follow your book

165
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:26,180
to make it up to you.

166
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:30,460
What's wrong?

167
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,740
The immortal root of a fetus?

168
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,380
What's that?

169
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,420
Yao,

170
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,660
you are pregnant.

171
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:41,660
Oh?

172
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:43,260
No way.

173
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,820
You still have
the Heaven-overturning Mark.

174
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,460
When did we do the dual cultivation?

175
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,740
When we were in the Mortal World,

176
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,900
I didn't have the mark.

177
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:02,020
We made a trip down

178
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,260
and brought a fetus up.

179
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:06,920
Yao,

180
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,180
we have to get married quickly.

181
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,460
Yeah.

182
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,500
Flame Feather.

183
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,420
I have grown a new Flame Feather.

184
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,060
When it's fully grown,

185
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,940
I'll be able to lift your mark.

186
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:29,820
(Xuanming Token)

187
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,060
Wuyou's Xuanming Token?

188
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:57,200
♪Ancient paintings mottled,
flying flowers splashing♪

189
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:04,400

190
