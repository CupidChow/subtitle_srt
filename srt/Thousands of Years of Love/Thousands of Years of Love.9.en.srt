=Episode 9=

3
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,440
My master's Qionghua Residence
is in front.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,680
She is proficient in the secret magic
of the Five Elements.

5
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:27,040
You'll know when you get there.

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,300
This forest is arranged according to
the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:38,720
The terrain is complicated.

8
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,440
Be careful when you walk.

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,440
The forest is arranged according to
the Five Elements and Eight Trigrams.

10
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,920
The terrain is complicated.

11
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,280
Be careful when you walk.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,560
How do you know?

13
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,120
Master.

14
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,360
Master.

15
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,720
Where are you, Master?

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
Master, we're here.

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,120
Master.

18
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,680
Hmph.

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:22,880
You finally came.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:25,040
I've missed my Xuanming
Snow Mountain Wine.

21
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:25,960
Give it to me quickly.

22
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,520
Be patient.

23
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:28,520
This time,

24
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,200
I've brought a new flavor,

25
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,760
Qingxu Mist Wine.

26
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,080
You know me well.

27
00:01:35,480 --> 00:01:37,120
This is the husband
I've found for myself,

28
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,000
Mo Chenyuan.

29
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:40,200
Our story is too long.

30
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:42,600
You might as well
read the story book.

31
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,960
This is my autographed book,
a public display of our affection.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,040
Neither the old nor the young
will be cheated.

33
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,360
Greetings.

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,280
Yeah.

35
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,400
Come in.

36
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,920
So

37
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:08,640
you recognized her a long time ago?

38
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,160
Why don't you tell her?

39
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,240
She hasn't recognized me.

40
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:17,720
You're really petty.

41
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,680
No, I'm not.

42
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,160
She has tried to beat me
since we were young.

43
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,600
If I told her that the little boy
is now an Immortal Lord,

44
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,960
how could she agree to marry me?

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,800
No need to explain.

46
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,160
You are petty indeed.

47
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,440
Ruoyao has a hot temper.

48
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,760
If you let the cat out of the bag,

49
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:36,360
she won't let you off easily.

50
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,280
I have my way to please her.

51
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,720
As for my Heaven-overturning Mark,

52
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,480
please help me to deal with it.

53
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,240
I warned you so many times,

54
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
but you still used your magic
to break through the Spirit Shield.

55
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,160
It's a waste of my efforts.

56
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,760
How do you have the nerve
to come to me?

57
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,640
Ruoyao brought me here.

58
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,680
She has no idea about this.

59
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,000
Then you should wait
another 10,000 years.

60
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,960
You'll be saved when the new
Eternal Ice Silk grows.

61
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,480
Here, our fresh fruits. They're sweet.

62
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,320
Try it.

63
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:26,720
The sweet apricot blooms every 300 years
and bears fruits every 300 years.

64
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,440
Try it.

65
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,040
So sour!

66
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:44,320
You've been tricked, you fool!

67
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,600
I don't like sour food.

68
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,240
Who told you it's sour?

69
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,680
Where

70
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:24,160
were you just now?

71
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,880
I went to the Snow Pond.

72
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:29,280
It's deep in the mountain.

73
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,640
Do you know the way?

74
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,480
It's not hard to find.

75
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,520
That mountain path twists and turns.

76
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
Isn't it hard for you to find?

77
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,000
Mo Chenyuan, you must have been here.

78
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,200
No.

79
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,200
No?

80
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:46,960
Do you know?

81
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,600
When you lie,

82
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,040
your eyes never blink.

83
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,200
Do you really believe my lie?

84
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:01,840
I saw you talking to Master today.

85
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
There's something wrong with you.

86
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,520
You must have known each other
for a long time.

87
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,000
If you don't tell me,

88
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,480
I'll go ask Master.

89
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,520
If I find out about it,

90
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:09,480
you're finished.

91
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,760
OK.

92
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,760
I'll tell you.

93
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:20,480
Feather.

94
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,440
My master said

95
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,240
when I meet the man who's destined for me,

96
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,240
the feather would fall off,

97
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:33,440
and then, I'd marry him
and cultivate together with him as a couple.

98
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,120
My feather is amazing, isn't it?

99
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,230
You don't have one.

100
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,560
You...

101
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,680
Are you Ice Block?

102
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,400
Yes.

103
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:49,520
But over 100 years ago,

104
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,400
you were recuperating
in the Xuanming Realm at ease

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,640
because you knew I couldn't beat you.

106
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,360
No.

107
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,680
Because I knew

108
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:01,440
you would be good to me.

109
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:05,880
You liar.

110
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,200
You ate my food and drank my water.

111
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,680
And now you're making a fool out of me.

112
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,440
I really want to be
your immortal spouse

113
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,360
and engage in dual cultivation
with you.

114
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,600
I was

115
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,720
talking nonsense when I was a child.

116
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,760
