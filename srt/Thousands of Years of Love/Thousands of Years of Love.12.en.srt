00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,160
Your Highness,

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,160
in the water, there are many...

5
00:00:24,380 --> 00:00:25,220
Yaoyao!

00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:10,860

17
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,620
When I was in my hometown,

18
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:28,380
I heard that there is a specialty
in Sheng called fireworks.

19
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,220
When they are ignited with fire

20
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:31,940
and rise in the night sky,

21
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,220
it's like a beautiful fairyland
with flowers in full bloom.

22
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:36,420
I didn't expect to see them today.

23
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,460
They're even more beautiful
than I imagined.

24
00:02:38,980 --> 00:02:41,620
When the people of Sheng are happy,

25
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,260
we set off fireworks.

26
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,020
If you like them,

27
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:46,780
I'll bring you to see them again.

28
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:50,380
By the way, I've also heard that

29
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,660
if you make a wish at the fireworks,

30
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,740
the gods in heaven

31
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,180
will bless you.

32
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,340
Is it true?

33
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,460
Do you have a wish?

34
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,880
♪Don't reveal the secret♪

35
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,030
I wish

36
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,900
my parents good health

37
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,460
and peace in life.

38
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
What about you?

39
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:19,100
I wish Yaoyao

40
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,020
a life of peace

41
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:23,020
and prosperity.

42
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,260
Why do you

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,060
wish me a life of peace and prosperity?

44
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,580
Because you are the only one
in this world

45
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,580
who wishes me well.

46
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,980
I naturally wish you peace
and prosperity.

47
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:45,780
But you are a prince.

48
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,460
You should please the princess.

49
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:50,900
Don't you want to marry her?

50
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:57,060
Whoever marries the Princess of Chen
will be the Crown Prince.

51
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,820
This is a test from Father.

52
00:04:00,260 --> 00:04:01,100
So you...

53
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,780
Although he is the legitimate son,

54
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:06,620
ever since we were young,

55
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,340
I have never lost.

56
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,460
This time is no exception.

57
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,940
I will win the princess's heart
before he does.

58
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,420
I am the son of a concubine.

59
00:04:19,780 --> 00:04:21,380
How can I be worthy of the princess?

60
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:24,940
Then,

61
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,660
why don't you marry me?

62
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,220
Yaoyao,

63
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:48,060
you are a good girl.

64
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,380
I'm not worth your time.

65
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:10,900
Your Highness, what happened?

66
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:12,820
Yin Moting.

67
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:14,780
That's a lovely name.

68
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,420
But he is the son of a concubine.

69
00:05:16,740 --> 00:05:17,780
He'll never be

70
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,060
the Crown Prince.

71
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:21,340
With the phoenix's destiny,
you are to marry a Crown Prince.

72
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,060
I don't believe in destiny.

73
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,420
I will only marry the man I love.

74
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:33,300
The Princess of Chen has arrived.

75
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,460
I'm Chenxi.

76
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,940
Greetings, Your Majesty.

77
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,820
You are the princess?

78
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:54,220
Did you drink all night again?

79
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,220
What nonsense are you talking about?

80
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,220
I sent a letter of marriage
to ask for the Crown Princess.

81
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:01,460
Do you think

82
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:03,380
I've asked for the wrong person?

83
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,100
Your Highness, you've come all the way
from Chen

84
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:09,700
to unite with us by marriage.

85
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,020
You can choose between my two sons.

86
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,020
Whoever you like,

87
00:06:15,540 --> 00:06:17,980
give your jade Ruyi to him.

88
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
I

89
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,980
will not let you down.

90
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:33,620
Your Highness,

91
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,860
this is the betrothal gift
from Sheng to Chen.

92
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,660
It represents a marriage proposal.

93
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:38,580
I know.

94
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,340
That's why I'm giving it to you.

95
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,780
I want to marry you.

96
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,620
Will you accept it or not?

97
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,020
I am the legitimate son of the queen.

98
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,940
Are you crazy not to choose me?

99
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:52,620
Your Majesty,

100
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,580
is this your biological son?

101
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,100
You and the Second Prince are peaceful

102
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,340
and extraordinary.

103
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,580
But why is this one

104
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,180
trying to bite me like a mad dog?

105
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,420
- You!
- Moxuan!

106
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:07,300
Don't be rude.

107
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,500
Your Majesty, you have two sons.

108
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,860
But the marriage contract

109
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,100
doesn't specify
who I'm to be married to.

110
00:07:14,540 --> 00:07:17,420
I think I have the right
to choose for myself,

111
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,580
right, Your Majesty?

112
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,060
Even so,

113
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,540
you should know

114
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,460
this is a very important choice.

115
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:29,220
It's necessary
to make everyone convinced.

116
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,500
I understand.

117
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:37,460
Your Majesty, please allow me
to give the two princes three questions.

118
00:07:37,940 --> 00:07:40,020
It'll be clear

119
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:41,620
who's better for me.

120
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,300
The first question.

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,860
Princes, please answer.

122
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:00,420
What is the heaviest thing

123
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,460
in Sheng?

124
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:18,780
(Kunlun Mountain)

125
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:24,620
The Kunlun Mountain
is the highest mountain in Sheng.

126
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:26,860
It's naturally the heaviest.

127
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,140
Hmm.

128
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,220
