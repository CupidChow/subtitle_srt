00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,460
(For thousands of years,)

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,949
(the conflict between the immortals
of the Qingxu Realm)

5
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:26,740
(and the demons of the Xuanming Realm)

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:28,620
(caused wars several times,)

7
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:31,300
(all ended in the defeat of the Demon Clan,)

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,420
(until the strongest Demon Lady Feng Ruoyao)

9
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:36,580
(came into the picture.)

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:44,860
(Mo Chenyuan, Immortal Lord of the Qingxu Realm)

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:47,380
(Feng Ruoyao, Demon Lady of the Xuanming Realm)

12
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:02,860
(Mo Chenyuan,
Immortal Lord of the Qingxu Realm,)

13
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:05,820
(was defeated by Feng Ruoyao with a single blow)

14
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:09,220
(and captured by the Demon Clan from then on.)

15
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:24,060
(A hundred years have passed,)

16
00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:27,100
(but the Immortal Lord
is still trapped in the Demon Clan.)

17
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:31,660
(The entire Qingxu Realm is wary
because of this,)

18
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,900
(not daring to attack the Demon Clan.)

19
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:36,020
(And the Demon Clan…)

20
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,100
Feng Ruoyao, Demon Lady of the Xuanming Realm,

21
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:44,740
is hereby requesting Your Lordship
to return to Heaven.

22
00:01:48,940 --> 00:01:51,060
I am your captive.

23
00:01:52,180 --> 00:01:53,860
I can't just leave like that.

24
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,060
I'm begging you.

25
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:57,540
Please go back.

26
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,300
You have been slacking off here
for a hundred years.

27
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,020
I have to serve you gourmet food every day,

28
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,100
and you only drink the snow spring water
from the top of the Kunlun Mountain.

29
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:06,540
Please know

30
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,940
that I can't afford to keep a prisoner like you.

31
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,380
This is your problem,

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,380
not mine.

33
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:19,140
Mo Chenyuan, I swear that today I'll…

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:19,980
Don't move.

35
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:24,540
Stand still.

36
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,740
- You…
- It's only been a hundred years.

37
00:02:31,100 --> 00:02:33,180
You are already getting impatient.

38
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:36,260
When you defeated me back then,

39
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:40,460
you said you'd keep me here
for thousands of years.

40
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,460
It was a promise you made.

41
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:50,900
And now, you can't wait to get me out of here.

42
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,340
You are being cruel, Your Ladyship.

43
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,740
I am being cruel?

44
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:59,500
Because of your protective golden light,

45
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:00,540
for the past one hundred years,

46
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:02,380
I haven't even been able to touch your finger.

47
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:05,260
You've been well-fed every day.
How am I the cruel one?

48
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,340
So, you are saying,

49
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,340
if I let you touch me,

50
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,860
you'll let me stay?

51
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,860
Failed again?

52
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,700
He still refuses to leave?

53
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,140
I've lived for 936 years.

54
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:39,460
I have never seen
a shameless immortal like him.

55
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:43,220
We captured him back then
to humiliate the Qingxu Realm.

56
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:44,460
But now,

57
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:47,860
the Three Realms are all thinking of me
as a joke.

58
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,060
That's not true.

59
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,100
Hey,

60
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,820
the entire Three Realms

61
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,790
are actually making up stories about you two.

62
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,360
(Romance between the Immortal Lord)
The Immortal Lord and the Demon Lady.

63
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,960
(and the Demon Lady by Xiaoxiao Sheng)
The Immortal Lord and the Demon Lady.

64
00:04:05,420 --> 00:04:06,900
What kind of a

65
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,500
crazy moron wrote this?

66
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:09,580
He has no idea

67
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,660
what kind of a life I've been living
for the past hundred years.

68
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,020
Romance? Give me a break.

69
00:04:20,540 --> 00:04:24,100
(One hundred years ago)

70
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,180
This immortal

71
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,140
is handsome and charming.

72
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,180
It'll be a shame to kill him.

73
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:30,740
Why don't I

74
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,300
make him my kept man?

75
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,820
He can

76
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:40,900
warm the bed for me.

77
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,220
(I was attracted to his pretty face,)

78
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:53,220
(and I forgot that the immortals
all have protective golden light.)

79
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,900
Your Ladyship,
were you trying to take advantage of me

80
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,900
while I was sleeping?

81
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:00,580
How could you say that?

82
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,460
I will be

83
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,380
responsible for you.

84
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,460
(Form alliance between the two realms
through marriage)

85
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
This is the marriage contract.

86
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,340
Sign it and marry me.

87
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,380
From now on, we'll be a wedded couple.

88
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,580
The Qingxu Realm
will merge into the Xuanming Realm.

89
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,820
We'll become family.

90
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:18,160
Otherwise…

91
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:22,740
Mo Chenyuan,

92
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,500
don't be ungrateful and look for trouble.

93
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:26,742
You've been locked
by the Immortal-Locking Chain,

94
00:05:26,766 --> 00:05:28,300
the most precious treasure of our Demon Clan.

95
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:30,260
No matter how you struggle,

96
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,580
you can't…

97
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,540
You were asking me

98
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,180
to sign the marriage contract,

99
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:40,820
otherwise,

100
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,620
you'd

101
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:43,860
do what?

102
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,460
Otherwise…

103
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:50,900
Otherwise, I'll

104
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:52,940
keep you as a prisoner

105
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,460
and confine you in the Xuanming Realm

106
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:56,420
for thousands of years.

107
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,060
Fine by me.

108
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,460
Why do I feel like

109
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:09,460
I'm being blackmailed?

110
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,940
Neither can I kill him, defeat him,

111
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:16,460
send him away, nor can I touch him.

112
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:21,040
What should I do with him?

113
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,620
Your Ladyship,

114
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:27,660
your Flame Feather

115
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:29,740
is about to shed.

116
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:32,900
Nonsense.

117
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
My Flame Feather is deeply rooted.

118
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,980
- But, it's…
- But what?

119
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,460
I think you are too old to see things clearly.

120
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,820
You should go back and rest.

121
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:42,010
I… Well…

122
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:43,060
Hmm?

123
00:06:43,460 --> 00:06:44,300
I…

124
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,500
You are the ancient divine beast Phoenix,

125
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,540
and you are extremely distinguished.

126
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,500
But you should know

127
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,780
that during the molting period,

128
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:10,820
both your spiritual power
and cultivation base will be gone,

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:15,260
until the new Flame Feather grows out.

130
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,860
Only then can you get your power back.

131
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,940
(Although I am the Demon Lady,)

132
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,460
(if I lose my power,
I'm afraid I won't live for long.)

133
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,820
(Qingxu Order Token?)

134
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,220
(Could it be)

135
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,980
(something bad happened to the Qingxu Realm?)

136
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:39,540
Just as you expected,

137
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,740
Mo Haoli plans to seize power tomorrow.

138
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:46,900
He tried every means to marry Xinlan

139
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:50,140
just to gain the support of the Lingxiao Sect

140
00:07:50,540 --> 00:07:52,300
and to seize the position of the Immortal Lord.

141
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,300
Since you already knew,

142
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,500
why didn't you stop Mo Haoli
from getting married?

143
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,500
Why would I?

144
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,380
But, since it has come to this point,

145
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:04,820
it's time for me to go back.

146
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:07,620
Mo Chenyuan,

147
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,300
I knew you refused to leave for a reason.

148
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,620
If you don't tell me today,

149
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,140
I'd rather risk losing my cultivation base

150
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:15,660
to destroy your protective golden light

151
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:16,980
and die with you.

152
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:18,340
I don't mind telling you.

153
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:21,420
My father arranged a marriage for me.

154
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,300
But I didn't want to marry that girl.

155
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:24,740
Therefore,

156
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,820
I've been hiding here

157
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,820
to get a peace of mind.

158
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,940
And now, she's got married.

159
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,060
Sorry for bothering you for all these years.

160
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:36,860
I'll take my leave now.

161
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:42,340
Feng Ruoyao,

162
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,980
may we meet again

163
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,340
somewhere in the future.

164
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,580
I'll be waiting for you in the Qingxu Realm.

165
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,780
After all,

166
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:57,300
you don't have much time left.

167
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,700
(Xuanming Hall)

168
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,660
When you grow up,

169
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:15,100
you will meet a man who's destined for you.

170
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:16,740
By then,

171
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,980
your Flame Feather will fall off.

172
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,180
As long as

173
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,380
you cultivate with that man,

174
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,420
a new Flame Feather will grow out,

175
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,140
and your cultivation base

176
00:09:28,180 --> 00:09:30,420
will also improve greatly.

177
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,380
Dual cultivation.

178
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:41,320
