I'm the Crown Prince.

Who dares to do anything?

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:26,640
Yaoyao, you leave first.

6
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,320
Kill them.

7
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:31,080
Stop the remnants of Chen.

8
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,840
Kill them on the spot!

9
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,840
Leave.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:46,920
Leave, Yaoyao.

11
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,000
Yaoyao!

12
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Yaoyao.

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,130
Yaoyao.

(Mo Chenyuan,)

15
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,320
(Feng Ruoyao doesn't want to kill you.)

16
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,120
(I'll do it for her.)

17
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,360
Yaoyao.

18
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,360
Yaoyao!

19
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,240
Yaoyao.

20
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,040
The position of the Immortal Lady

21
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,840
is mine after all.

22
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,960
Yaoyao.

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,400
You'll be fine.

24
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,560
It's OK. You'll be fine.

25
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,240
Look.

26
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,480
Look.

27
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,240
It's snowing.

28
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,120
Yes.

will grow old together.

32
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,360
Yes.

33
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:32,040
Definitely.

34
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,080

38

was meeting you.

39
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,680
If there is a next life...

40
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,720
I don't want a next life.

41
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,880
I want us to be together.

42
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,480
You must

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,570
remember to find me.

44
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,440
No, don't leave me.

45

We will

46

47
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:14,640
Promise me.

48
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:16,320
Promise me,

49
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:19,280
will you?

50
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:21,640

I promise you,

54
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,600
we'll watch the fireworks together

55
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,520
and grow old together.

56
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,960

61
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:47,040
What's your name?

00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:56,080
still treat me so well.

What is my fault?

88
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,480
I was born to be the Immortal Lady!

89
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,760
If you hadn't been so blind,

or Feng Ruoyao hadn't acted against me,

00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,920
I should have been
the Immortal Lady long ago!

92
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,480
You have no sense of remorse.

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,520
Your death is not to be regretted.

let me go!

97
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,560
I'll break your immortal root

98
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,160
and relegate you to the Mortal World

99
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,960
so that you can start afresh.

100
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,000
Xinlan!

Mo Chenyuan,

106
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
don't forget the thing on you.

107
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,320
With the Heaven-overturning Mark on you,
you're no match for me.

108
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,480
Why is it useless?

109
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:45,400
I've just restored my primordial spirit.

110
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
I haven't returned to the Realm yet.

111
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,080
The mark can't turn against me.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,680
I have the tally.

00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:34,960

00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,800
you're trying to
mess up the Three Realms

I'll spare your life.
