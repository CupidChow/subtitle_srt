3
00:00:18,580 --> 00:00:19,860
What's the Second Prince's answer?

4
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:25,100
(Popular Support)

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:27,700
Popular support.

6
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:32,140
Your Majesty is a wise king.

7
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:35,580
You must care most
about popular support.

8
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,300
What could be more important
than popular support?

9
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:43,980
The Second Prince's answer is excellent.

10
00:00:50,020 --> 00:00:50,860
The second question.

11
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:54,420
Please find the most precious thing

12
00:00:54,540 --> 00:00:55,660
in this hall.

13
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:12,980
Excuse me, Father.

14
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,020
This is the imperial jade seal.

15
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,100
Whoever holds this

16
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,100
can command the whole kingdom.

17
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,540
In the hall,

18
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:28,380
nothing is more precious than this.

19
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:47,420
Moting,

20
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:49,420
what do you mean?

21
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:55,260
In this hall,

22
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:57,380
even in the kingdom,

23
00:01:57,860 --> 00:01:58,820
the most precious thing

24
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,540
is the ruler of the kingdom,

25
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,860
you, Father.

26
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,740
You've always flattered
and pleased Father.

27
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,460
But you've clearly made a wrong answer.

28
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,740
This imperial jade seal

29
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,820
is just a stone.

30
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,660
The one who can command the kingdom

31
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,740
is the king,

32
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,060
the wise king who can

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,500
lead our kingdom

34
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,860
to greatness.

35
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,610
Exactly.

36
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,740
What the Second Prince said is true.

37
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:39,820
Your Majesty is wise.

38
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,660
Your Majesty is wise.

39
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:01,780
Why is Your Highness so sure

40
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,420
that the king will allow you
to choose for yourself?

41
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,540
He asked me to be the Crown Princess
of his kingdom

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,460
without specifying that

43
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,020
which of his sons I would marry.

44
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:14,060
He wanted to use my marriage

45
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:15,500
to choose the right Crown Prince.

46
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,820
So I didn't come up with the questions

47
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,060
to select

48
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,980
my future husband.

49
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,140
Instead, they were aimed
at choosing the future Crown Prince.

50
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:25,780
Since the Second Prince

51
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,700
got two of the three questions right,

52
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,220
he's already won.

53
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,540
Why did you give them a third question

54
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:32,400
saying

55
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:34,580
whoever finds you will marry you?

56
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,860
Because I know

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,580
he will find me.
