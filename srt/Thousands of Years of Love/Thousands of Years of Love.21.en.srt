(Xuanming Token)

4
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,440
Wuyou's Xuanming Token?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,640
It's not good.

6
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:28,100
Something's happened
in the Xuanming Realm.

7
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,280
Who has sunk

8
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,120
my realm in blood?

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,360
I must tear him to shreds!

10
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,040
You finally came.

11
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:45,880
Mo Chenyuan,

12
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,160
you've fallen
into my Soundproof Shield.

13
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,840
You can't ask the Qingxu Realm
for reinforcements.

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,240
Today is the day

15
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:55,560
you and Feng Ruoyao will die!

16
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,720
I have severed your immortal roots,

17
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,480
not expecting you to become demons.

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,320
There are more ways to defeat you

19
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,960
than immortal cultivation.

20
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:09,000
Do you think I can't kill you

21
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,120
just because
you've severed my immortal root?

22
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:12,140
Mo Haoli,

23
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:14,640
did you kill Wuyou?

24
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,610
He wouldn't kneel to me.

25
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:18,190
So I

26
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:19,820
had to kill him.

27
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,610
Your Demon Clan

28
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,340
collapsed at the first blow.

29
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:26,940
Monster.

30
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:37,820
Mo Haoli,

31
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:39,700
I spared your life out of kindness.

32
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:42,980
How dare you sneak
into the Xuanming Realm to do evil?

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:44,420
Mo Chenyuan,

34
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,180
you only let me live to torture me

35
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,620
and mock me.

36
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,620
Everything you owe me,

37
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,340
I'm going to get it back from you!

38
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:08,340
Feng Ruoyao,

39
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,980
without your Flame Feather,

40
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,380
as the Demon Lady,

41
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,980
you're useless.

42
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:01,740
Mo Haoli,

43
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:05,260
Father gave you
the Heaven-overturning Mark,

44
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:08,500
but he taught me this move
by the Void Realm.

45
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:11,540
As long as I don't hurt you
with my magic power,

46
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,860
I have many ways to deal with you.

47
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:16,980
You can't trap me for long.

48
00:05:23,540 --> 00:05:24,860
She is your wife.

49
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,300
Because she is my wife,

50
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:27,860
she should give everything to me.

51
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,380
I love you so much.

52
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,580
Why are you doing this to me?

53
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:11,020
Yao.

54
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,020
Mo Chenyuan,

55
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:18,860
you are such a great lover.

56
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,220
You're even protecting her
with your protective golden light.

57
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:24,740
Let me see how long you can protect her.

58
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:26,820
Open your eyes

59
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,020
and watch closely

60
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,540
how I kill the woman you love the most.

61
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,700
The Heaven-overturning Mark.

62
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,540
You are risking your life.

63
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,620
You've been threatening me
for so long with this mark.

64
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,980
But you don't know

65
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:16,340
I can choose to die with you!

66
00:07:16,940 --> 00:07:18,340
But you'll also die!

67
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,660
Don't.

68
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:26,500
Don't.

69
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,860
As long as you're fine,

70
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,060
that's enough.
