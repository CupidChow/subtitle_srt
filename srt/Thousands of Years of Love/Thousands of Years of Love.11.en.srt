00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:15,060
=Thousands of Years of Love=

2
00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
=Episode 11=

3
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:22,160
In front of him,

4
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,320
a beautiful woman

5
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,680
is offering herself,

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,480
but the Immortal Lord isn't interested.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:30,040
Deep in his heart,

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,440
in heaven and on earth,

9
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,160
in his past and present life,
he only loves one woman.

10
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:37,360
Zixia,

11
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:40,140
is the Love Story of the Immortal Lord
in the Mortal World sweet?

12
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:41,190
Yes.

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,610
But I've heard that

14
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:45,840
when you go down by the Wangchuan River,
you'll lose your memory.

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,860
If a beauty really
offers herself to His Lordship,

16
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,780
do you think he will...

17
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,260
Dare he?

18
00:00:57,580 --> 00:00:58,420
Uh...

19
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:02,740
But I heard from Yingzhao

20
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:03,860
that His Lordship

21
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,260
has been reincarnated in a kingdom
called Sheng,

22
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,700
where he's the son of a concubine,

23
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,860
not taken seriously.

24
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:13,380
I don't think any beauty
will offer herself to him.

25
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:17,460
What's up?

26
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,500
Your Ladyship,

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,580
this morning, Lord Mo Haoli
sneaked into the armory

28
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,180
and took the Soul Breaking Pestle.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,220
I'm afraid he's trying
to harm His Lordship.

30
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,540
I knew

31
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,100
he would play tricks sooner or later.

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,300
We'll have our memories erased
when we go down.

33
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,940
But even if we go to Mo Chenyuan,

34
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:42,580
what can we do to him?

35
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,700
This is the Soul Breaking Pestle

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,100
that can destroy his soul.

37
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:51,260
In this life,

38
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,540
he'll die
with his heart pierced through.

39
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,260
By then, he'll be resurrected
as an immortal.

40
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,580
Heaven and earth will shake.

41
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,860
You and I will be by his side.

42
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,580
We'll recover
our immortal consciousness with him.

43
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:03,940
At that time,

44
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:05,860
we only need to use this pestle

45
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:07,380
to break his soul.

46
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,580
(In heaven and earth,)

47
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,100
(this life and the next,)

48
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,620
(with me here,)

49
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,940
(no one can harm Mo Chenyuan.)

50
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,580
(Kingdom of Sheng)

51
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:35,460
Legend has it that

52
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,072
(20 years later)
the princess of Chen was born

53
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:38,380
(20 years later)
with auspicious signs.

54
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,980
Everyone says she is
the reincarnation of a phoenix.

55
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:42,740
Whoever marries her

56
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,940
will be able to unify the six kingdoms.

57
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:50,580
(Yin Moxuan, Eldest Prince of Sheng)

58
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,460
(Yin Moting, Second Prince of Sheng)

59
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,220
Unfortunately,

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,740
she won't even look at a son

61
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:00,620
born of a palace maid like you.

62
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,340
Why are you

63
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,500
making a fool of yourself?

64
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,300
Moxuan, although Chen is a small kingdom,

65
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,700
they try to unite with us by marriage.

66
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:12,500
Father ordered me
to wait for the princess.

67
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,180
I dare not defy His Majesty's order.

68
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,180
Your Highness,

69
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,750
what do you want?

70
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:48,780
No!

71
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:49,900
Be quiet!

72
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:51,850
- Take it off.
- No!

73
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:52,900
Hurry up.

74
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,340
Your Highness.

75
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,820
Hurry up.

76
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,220
Your Highness.

77
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:30,260
Your Highness.

78
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,380
(The Second Prince)

79
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,220
(is elegant and refined.)

80
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:51,940
(He's more pleasing
than the Eldest Prince.)

81
00:04:57,580 --> 00:04:58,980
Our people pretended to be merchants

82
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,700
and saw the princess in Chen.

83
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,820
They've drawn this portrait.

84
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:06,140
Does the Eldest Prince have one?

85
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,460
No.

86
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:16,060
Your Highness, look,

87
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,420
the one who saved your maid

88
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:21,220
is the Second Prince of Sheng.

89
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:22,860
Coincidentally,

90
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,620
like your maid,

91
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,580
he was also born of a palace maid.

92
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,300
Birds of a feather flock together.

93
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,820
It's absolutely right.

94
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:32,820
(This Eldest Prince)

95
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:34,220
(is an annoying idiot.)

96
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:36,960
Moxuan, Father said if education is provided
without discrimination,

97
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:39,020
even children would be ashamed
of the domineering policies.

98
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,980
If an ignorant man learns from a man of virtue
and talent, he can also achieve great things.

99
00:05:42,420 --> 00:05:43,420
Be cautious with your words.

100
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,340
Don't use Father as an excuse.

101
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:47,460
What nonsense are you talking about?

102
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,580
He is saying you're arrogant

103
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:51,140
and not as educated as a child.

104
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,420
You lowly maid!

105
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,340
How dare you...

106
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,460
Moxuan,

107
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,780
we are here to pick up the princess

108
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:58,420
instead of venting anger on others.

109
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:02,060
I don't need you to lecture me.

110
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:05,980
You brought this on yourself.

111
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:08,900
Your Highness,

112
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:09,900
let's go.

113
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,300
Your Highness, you must have
had a difficult journey.

114
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,260
I'll show you around

115
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:20,260
to get a knowledge of our customs.

116
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,460
Are you all right?

117
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,980
I'll show you the scenery
of our kingdom.

118
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,260
What's your name?

119
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:54,940
Yin Moting.

120
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,860
Yin Moting?

121
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:00,260
I am the youngest in my family.

122
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:02,500
My parents and siblings call me Yaoyao.

123
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,100
Yaoyao?

124
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:07,940
Good name.

125
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:12,220
Aren't you also a prince?

126
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:14,620
How could he bully you?

127
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,580
Princes are not all the same.

128
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,420
His mother is the queen.

129
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:22,940
My mother is just a palace maid.

130
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,860
Your Highness, look.

131
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,860
This is the highest mountain
in our kingdom,

132
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,260
the Kunlun Mountain.

133
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,340
(A lowly maid)

134
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,900
(dares to embarrass me in public.)

135
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,860
(Today, I'll let you die
without a burial place.)

136
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:40,460
Your Highness,

137
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,820
in the water, there are many...

138
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,860
