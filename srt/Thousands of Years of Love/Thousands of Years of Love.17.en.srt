I miss you so much.

When I was away from you,

I missed you every day.

From now on,

13
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:47,960
I will never leave you
for so long again.

00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,560
By the way,

Why?

20
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,800
Because I'm the Princess of Chen.

21
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:28,640
You destroyed my kingdom

22
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,360
and killed my parents.

23
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:33,440
Now you ask me why.
