00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,920
Moting.

4
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,520
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:41,680
In my heart,

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,400
I only remember the Moting who has been
engaged to me since our childhood.

7
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,200
But I forgot

8
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,920
I should call you Your Highness now.

9
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:51,560
It was a joke between our parents
when we were kids.

10
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,120
We've never been officially engaged.

11
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:56,760
Now I am married.

12
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,600
Let's not mention it again.

13
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Also,

14
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:02,140
Prime Minister Lin
is my respected mentor.

15
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:03,640
You are his daughter.

16
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,640
I regard you as my own sister.

17
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:09,160
I've loved you for so many years.

18
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,800
I've always wanted to marry you.

19
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,560
How could you do this to me?

20
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,760
Your Highness,

21
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:19,600
please show mercy

22
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:22,280
and give Moting and me a way out.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
- Yaoyao.
- You, go on.

24
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,160
- Thank you, Your Highness...
- Don't rise.

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
Your marriage
is an important world affair.

26
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,640
I don't dare to expect you
to discard your wife to marry me.

27
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,040
I only ask to be your concubine.

28
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,520
Alright, it's your turn now.

29
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,880
Kneel down.

30
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:51,320
May I speak now?

31
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,800
Before we were born,
my mother and Mrs. Lin

32
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,680
did get us engaged for fun.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,680
I don't want to ask about the past.

34
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,680
Now,

35
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,080
she wants to be your concubine.

36
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:04,960
Do you agree?

37
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:07,320
If you don't agree,

38
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,560
I have no choice but to die.

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,800
Yin Moting,

40
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,960
listen carefully.

41
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,040
I am the Princess of Chen.

42
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,640
I'll never share my husband.

43
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:16,880
Between me and her,

44
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,520
you have to make a choice.

45
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,520
I will honor my word.

46
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:26,360
I've made a lifelong commitment to you.

47
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:27,960
I won't choose anyone else.

48
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,320
Is that true?

49
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,200
Yes.

50
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,570
From now on,

51
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,720
I'm the only woman in your life

52
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:44,880
and you won't have any other woman?

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:45,880
Of course.

54
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,160
Not only do I have no other woman,

55
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,120
but I'm going to love you

56
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,520

Mo Chenyuan and Feng Ruoyao
have consummated their marriage.

have awakened in advance.

98

What about them?

99
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,280
Have they recovered their memories?

Mo Chenyuan will unify the six kingdoms

he gets killed on the battlefield
