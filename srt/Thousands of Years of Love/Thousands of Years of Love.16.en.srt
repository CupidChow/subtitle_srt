00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
=Episode 16=

3
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,040
Yaoyao,

4
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Father sent me
to attack the Kingdom of Li.

5
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,080
I have to leave the capital
for several months.

6
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,200
Why is it so sudden?

7
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,240
It's too dangerous. Don't go.

8
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,800
To curb Moxuan's power,

9
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:47,840
the attack on Li is important.

10
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:49,200
I must go.

11
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:52,520
Don't worry.

12
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,560
I will come back safely.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,800
Promise me

14
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,880
you'll come back safely.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:02,800
OK.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,680
I'll watch the fireworks with you
when I get back.

17
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,440
Yeah.

18
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,860
(Ziguang Hall)

19
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,080
May your heart be like mine.

20
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,440
It has been over two months.

21
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,720
I wonder

22
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,200
how the war is going

23
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:46,000
and how he is doing over there.

24
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,000
What's wrong with you, Your Highness?

25
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,800
I'm fine.

26
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,520
Your Highness,

27
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:00,520
if you don't eat or drink,

28
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,680
your health will break down.

29
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,800
If His Highness knows that you are sick,

30
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,000
he'll be so worried.

31
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,160
I'm fine.

32
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,840
I just have no appetite.

33
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,200
What is that?

34
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:14,400
You mean this?

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,060
(For Lu Chenxi)
This

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,080
is the letter from His Highness.

37
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,680
- Give it to me.
- No.

38
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:24,400
You should eat first.

39
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:28,280
Read the letter after you eat.

40
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,400
OK.

41
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,400
I will eat lest Moting will be worried.

42
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,360
Don't forget

43
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,920
I'm your brother's concubine now.

44
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,440
Mo Chenyuan is as blind as a bat.

45
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,360
I can't bear to see you sleep alone.

46
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:16,240
When Feng Ruoyao kills him,

47
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,000
I'll not only make you the Queen
of the Mortal World

48
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:24,880
but also the Immortal Lady
of the Qingxu Realm.

49
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,160
How long do I have to wait?

50
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,680
Be patient.

51
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,840
When Mo Chenyuan
returns with his troops,

52
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:52,160
it's his time to die.

53
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,440
(Moting said in his letter)

54
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:09,960
(that he was fine)

55
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:12,400
(and was about to return.)

56
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,600
(Chen is next to Li.)

57
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,360
(I hope he'll visit my parents)

58
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,560
(on his way back.)

59
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,160
Your Highness.

60
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:23,200
Stop, Your Highness!

61
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:25,760
Go away!

62
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,000
Are you writing a letter?

63
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,000
You've come uninvited.

64
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,200
What can I do for you?

65
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,360
The Crown Prince has returned.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:40,880
I came specifically to see you.

67
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:42,320
Is he back?

68
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,520
He's coming back

69
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,920
with your parents' bodies.

70
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,680
What did you say?

71
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,560
The Crown Prince volunteered
to lead the attack on Chen.

72
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,800
What do you mean?

73
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,520
Didn't he go to attack Li?

74
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,920
May your heart be like mine.

75
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,640
So you're unaware of it.

76
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,960
No wonder you're still
in the mood for romance

77
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,360
when your kingdom
and home are destroyed.

78
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,400
Say it.

79
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,960
What is the purpose of your visit?

80
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,280
Your Highness.

81
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,440
Nanny.

82
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,480
Nanny,

83
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,160
what are you doing here?

84
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,200
- I thought you...
- Your Highness,

85
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,720
your husband

86
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,640
led an army to destroy Chen.

87
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,320
Now the people of Chen have no homes.

88
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,240
Yin Moting, the cruel monster,

89
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,360
he also...

90
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:51,600
He also killed our king and queen
with his own hands.

91
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:00,080
Your father and mother
were killed by your husband,

92
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,400
my princess.

93
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,600
In terms of hypocrisy

94
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,320
and schemes,

95
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,240
who can compare to my younger brother?

96
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:11,840
You fell into his trap when you first
arrived in Sheng.

97
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:14,920
No way.

98
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,600
We fell for each other back then.

99
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,080
He's been true to me.

100
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:22,920
When you pretended to be a palace maid

101
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,320
to secretly investigate me
and Yin Moting,

102
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,960
you mustn't have dreamed that

103
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,440
he had already got your portrait.

104
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,400
(This is indeed my outfit in Chen.)

105
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:36,760
Before you knew him,

106
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,000
he had already
started to scheme against you.

107
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:41,440
He used your reputation of the Phoenix

108
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:42,920
to take the position
of the Crown Prince.

109
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,880
Then he attacked Chen off guard.

110
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:49,960
Do you have to wait for him
to unify the six kingdoms

111
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,040
before you realize

112
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,200
that you're just a pawn in his game?

113
00:07:00,320 --> 00:07:02,040
Why are you telling me this?

114
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,640
I'm not here to help you.

115
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,360
I just don't want you
to live in his lies until you die.

116
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:12,960
He will be back soon.

117
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,600
You might as well ask him

118
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,240
what your kingdom is like now.

119
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
Also,

120
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:23,120
lit the last incense
for your deceased parents.

121
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:25,680
Your Highness.

122
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,640
Your Highness.

123
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:31,840
