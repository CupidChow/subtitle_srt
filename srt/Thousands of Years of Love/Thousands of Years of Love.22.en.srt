00:00:15,060 --> 00:00:17,380
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,440
You've been watching it for 300 years.

4
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:45,200
Can you stop watching it?

5
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:49,360
You'd better discipline
you and Mo Chenyuan's good daughter.

6
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:52,240
You said this place has
the strongest spiritual energy.

7
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,720
Did you lie to me?

8
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,840
When did I ever lie to you?

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,480
But it's been 300 years.

10
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,680
Why hasn't Mo Chenyuan
got out of the Flame Feather?

11
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:04,640
That's definitely not my problem.

12
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,120
Are you saying it's my fault?

13
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,000
My dear Ruoyao,

14
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:13,920
why don't you move on?

15
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:15,760
You shouldn't be so obsessed.

16
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:17,360
You'd better give up, OK?

17
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,560
Educate your daughter well

18
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,720
and raise a good Immortal Lady

19
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,880
for the Qingxu Realm, OK?

20
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,160
OK.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,200
But you should

22
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,520
do it yourself, Master.

23
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:29,760
Look how well
you've raised Mo Chenyuan.

24
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,880
Oh, no. Mo Chenyuan

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,880
can learn everything by himself.

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
But your daughter, Mo Xiaofeng,

27
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
is like you in every way.

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,880
So what?

29
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,800
What's wrong with me?

30
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,520
Hey, kid!

31
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,760
My Lingzhu Herb!

32
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,760
Put it down quickly.

33
00:01:50,760 --> 00:01:51,880
Kid!

34
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,160
Greetings, Your Ladyship.

35
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
What brings you here today?

36
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:08,040
Someone wants to ask Your Ladyship

37
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,520
if The Romance between
the Immortal Lord and the Demon Lady

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,200
will discontinue.

39
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,840
Absolutely not.

40
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,250
Do you understand
the lack of inspiration?

41
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,880
If you are my fans,

42
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:18,560
you should be patient.

43
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,480
Your fans can wait,

44
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,800
but the Qingxu Realm can't wait.

45
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,550
The position of the Immortal Lord
has been vacant for long.

46
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,040
It's time for the Qingxu Realm

47
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,840
to welcome a new Immortal Lord.

48
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,920
But Mo Xiaofeng is only 300 years old.

49
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,520
Aren't you too impatient?

50
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,640
Mo Xiaofeng is indeed too young.

51
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:38,600
She should be the next Lady.

52
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,040
You people of the Qingxu Realm
are so fickle, cold, and unfeeling.

53
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,400
Forget it.

54
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:47,960
As long as it's not Mo Haoli.

55
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,480
Mo Haoli?

56
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,040
Well,

57
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,800
did I not make it clear?

58
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,300
(Invitation)
Your Ladyship,

59
00:02:56,320 --> 00:02:58,480
tomorrow is the enthronement banquet
for the new Immortal Lord.

60
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,120
Please make sure you're present.

61
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,600
It depends on my mood.

62
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,800
No, you must come.

63
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,080
Alright, I know.

64
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,080
Be sure to come.

65
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,320
Got it.

66
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,120
I'd like to see

67
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,360
who is worthy of the title
of the Immortal Lord.

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Why isn't anyone here, Mom?

69
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:36,280
Yeah.

70
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,640
Didn't Yingzhao say

71
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,920
there's an enthronement ceremony
for the new Immortal Lord?

72
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,440
Yao.

73
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:17,960
Yao.

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,160
Who are you?

75
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,400
Don't you have anything to do?

76
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,120
Yes, I do.

77
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
I have many things to do.

78
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,840
I want to watch fireworks,

79
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:45,960
release the Kongming lantern,
and have snowball fights with you.

80
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,720
And also,

81
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,440
enjoying tea on spring nights,

82
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,240
reading and burning incense,

83
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,040
sitting in meditation

84
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,600
to relieve...

85
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,320
Relieve what?

86
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,080
Relieve

87
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,480
my yearning for you.

88
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,280
Then,

89
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,080
do you know

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,240
what else to do on spring nights?

91
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:21,680
Xiaofeng is still here.

92
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
What to do?

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,920
Mom, tell me.

94
00:05:27,760 --> 00:05:29,100
To

95
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,590
discuss

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,360
the cooperation between
the Qingxu and Xuanming Realms

97
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:34,920
and

98
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,040
consider

99
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,760
how you'll live
after you marry into the family.
