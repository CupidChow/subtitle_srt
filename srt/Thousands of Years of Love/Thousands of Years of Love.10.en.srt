I can teach you.

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,400
First, you kowtow to me 180 times.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,480
Then you offer to me a humble apology,
anyway...

7
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:51,600
Is it good?

8
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:53,680
Do you like it?

9
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:56,480
No, it isn't.

36

Last night, I flipped through
the ancient classics.

37
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:10,000
Guess what?

38
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,360
Coincidentally,

39
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:13,960
the Flame Feather

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,960
happens to be able to restrain
the Heaven-overturning Mark.

41
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,400
The phoenix

42
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,960
is indeed marvelous.

43
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:22,880
But

44
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,120
my Flame Feather

45
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,680
was broken in the Void Realm.

46
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:26,880
That's easy.

47
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:27,860
Dual cultivation.

48
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,920
Dual cultivation

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,760
helps your Flame Feather to grow.

50
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,080
But we can't do dual cultivation
when he has the mark on him.

51
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,800
If I can't do dual cultivation,
I can't grow a new Flame Feather.

52
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,600
If I can't grow a new Flame Feather,
I can't break his mark.

53
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,800
It's a dead end.

54
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,360
Ah.

55
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:45,840
You don't have to do dual cultivation

56
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,680
with that one man.

57
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:57,800
Let's go.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,000
Ridiculous.

59
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,320
Let's go back to the Qingxu Realm.

60
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:05,320
Oh, the young people are so stuffy.

61
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,680
Welcome back, Your Lordship.

62
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,120
Mo Chenyuan,

63
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,120
since you've returned
from the Qionghua Residence,

64
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,160
it's time to settle our score.

65
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:19,280
Mo Haoli,

66
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,040
I've sent you to the Remorse Cliff.

67
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,720
How dare you leave the prison
without permission?

68
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,840
Your mother left the prison.

69
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:28,280
Why can't I?

70
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,040
She killed my mother.

71
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,800
Father sealed her in the Void Realm
before he died

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,920
to trap her for a lifetime.

73
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,520
Mo Chenyuan,

74
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,040
you don't even honor Father's last will.

75
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,160
What right have you got
to be the Immortal Lord?

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,160
Yes, my mother made a big mistake,

77
00:04:48,440 --> 00:04:49,880
but when she was held in the Void Realm,

78
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,040
she was tortured day and night
by the heavenly punishment.

79
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,140
She has already atoned for her sins.

80
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:56,320
She only suffered a little physically.

81
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,000
But my mother lost her life.

82
00:04:58,320 --> 00:04:59,760
What kind of atonement is that?

83
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
According to the laws
of the Qingxu Realm,

84
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,920
the criminals
imprisoned in the Void Realm

85
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,360
should never be released.

86
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,600
Offenders will be sent
to the Mortal World

87
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,600
and punished
with the Heart Piercing Calamity.

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,680
Mother's debt will be paid by her son.

89
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:18,200
I'm willing to be punished.

90
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:29,840
What are you doing?

91
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,640
I'm taking you back
to the Xuanming Realm.

92
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:33,240
You have lost all your power.

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,960
Aren't you afraid to go back?

94
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,880
I'll take you and your mother with me.

95
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,800
With you, the Immortal Lord,

96
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,080
who dares to make trouble?

97
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,680
Mo Chenyuan,

98
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,520
are you so stupid as to take
the Heart Piercing Calamity?

♪Don't look back and wet your sleeves♪

100

101

Are you still making fun of me
at this time?

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,840
Are you leaving or not?

103
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,760
I can't leave.

104
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:04,800
I am the Immortal Lord
of the Qingxu Realm.

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,640
If I leave now,

106
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,680
I'd be admitting defeat to Mo Haoli.

107
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,560
But Mo Haoli obviously tries
to drive you out of the Qingxu Realm

108
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,480
and take your position.

109
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,840
Do you still insist on doing this?

110
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,040
Do you

111
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,640
