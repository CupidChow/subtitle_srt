=Episode 19=

3
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,240
You're back.

4
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:51,320
Yuan.

5
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm back.

6
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,520
I remember everything now.

7
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:14,550
(This bottle of immortal dew
is brewed with immortal peaches.)

8
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,280
(That little glutton must love it.)

9
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,200
(I wonder)

10
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,200
(if she is still in Qionghua.)

11
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,280
What are you doing here?

12
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,840
I heard that you are going out
for experience.

13
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,680
The world is a dangerous place.

14
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,600
I've got a magic weapon
from your father and brother

15
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:38,840
for you to carry with you.

16
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,560
Why do you give me this?

17
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,600
I know you're prejudiced against me.

18
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,440
But in my heart,

19
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:50,840
you and Haoli are the same.

20
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,280
(The concubine was just a mortal)

21
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,440
(and was brought to the Qingxu Realm
by Father.)

22
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,200
As long as you're dead...

23
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,560
(She lived a life of honor.)

24
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:11,160
Everything will be Haoli's.

25
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,160
(But she wasn't satisfied.)

26
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,560
(She even tried to use a magic weapon)

27
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,640
(to kill me.)

28
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,680
(Misuse of a magic weapon
will result in repercussions.)

29
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,400
(She got what she deserved,)

30
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,080
(only that you were implicated)

31
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,600
(for no reason)

32
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,900
(and had suffered for so many years.)

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,040
Yuan.

34
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,480
Yuan.

35
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,200
Yuan.

36
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,520
(She brought death)

37
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,920
(to herself,)

38
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,320
(but your father
had always doted on her.)

39
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,080
(He would definitely)

40
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,000
(hate you for her death.)

41
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,680
(To protect you,)

42
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:43,040
(I had no choice but to do that.)

43
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,360
Mother,

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,720
I've taken back everything
that belongs to me.

45
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:03,680
You will never have to suffer again.

46
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:26,360
The Qingxu Realm?

47
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,240
I'm back?

48
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,240
How come my heart
was pierced in the end?

49
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,080
Did Mo Chenyuan fail
in passing through the calamity?

50
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,160
Mo Chenyuan!

51
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,280
Mo Chenyuan.

I remember in the Mortal World,

64

you loved watching fireworks.

65
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,360
When I was in my hometown,

66
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,000
I heard that there is a specialty
in Sheng called fireworks.

67
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,320
When they are ignited with fire

68
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,920
and rise in the night sky,

69
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,320
it's like a beautiful fairyland
with flowers in full bloom.

70
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,400
I didn't expect to see them today.

71
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:18,600
My favorite thing

72
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,200
is not to watch fireworks,

73
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,520
