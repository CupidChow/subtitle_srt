3
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:22,200
We've united with Chen by marriage.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,660
To show their loyalty,

5
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,460
Chen even married their princess to me.

6
00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:28,100
If we betray our alliance,

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:30,340
we'll be despised by the world.

8
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,660
The alliance and marriage

9
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,260
are a strategy to lower Chen's guard.

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,020
His Majesty's ambition
is to unify the world.

11
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,620
You should be aware of that, right?

12
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:49,100
If Father insists
on annexing the Kingdom of Chen,

13
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,740
please recommend me

14
00:00:51,940 --> 00:00:52,980
to lead the army.

15
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:54,780
The Crown Princess

16
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:56,860
is the Princess of Chen.

17
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:59,100
If you lead the army,

18
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,900
people will be suspicious.

19
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:04,620
So,

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,860
I recommended

21
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:09,300
the Eldest Prince.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,100
No.

23
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:15,380
He is brave enough in battle,

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:16,580
but he is cold-hearted.

25
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,220
If he takes the lead
and commands the army,

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:20,140
the people of Chen will suffer.

27
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,420
Sir, you've always been on my side.

28
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:24,940
This time, please help me

29
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,220
as always.

30
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,020
Your Highness,

31
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:32,340
you reneged on your engagement
to my daughter

32
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:35,580
without even making her a concubine.

33
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,420
How can I still help you?

34
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,940
Sir,

35
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:44,940
I've never promised
to marry your daughter.

36
00:01:45,460 --> 00:01:46,380
Our engagement was only

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,260
made by our parents for fun
in our childhood.

38
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,260
Moreover, the Crown Princess and I...

39
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,900
Your Highness, say no more.

40
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,020
I only

41
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:58,060
have this one daughter.

42
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,980
Whoever wishes to marry her,

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,660
I'll recommend him

44
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,140
to His Majesty,

45
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:06,980
for example,

46
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,220
the Eldest Prince.

47
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,140
I'm willing to take her as my concubine

48
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:23,380
in exchange for you
to recommend me to His Majesty.

49
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:26,500
Is that true?

50
00:02:26,820 --> 00:02:28,100
You know me.

51
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,500
I've never been immersed in love.

52
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:34,980
Good.

53
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:38,380
Good.

54
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:45,340
(Ziguang Hall)

55
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:54,700
Your Highness.

56
00:02:55,060 --> 00:02:56,100
Is His Highness back?

57
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,180
His Highness

58
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,420
came back
with the Prime Minister's daughter.

59
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,260
What do you mean?

60
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:02,820
He said

61
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:05,460
he would marry her soon.

62
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,500
Look at that flower.

63
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,860
It's so beautiful.

64
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,340
It's in full bloom.

65
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,140
Do you remember?

66
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,340
When we were young,

67
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,820
every time we went out to play,

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,100
you would pick a flower for me.

69
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:36,780
Greetings, Your Highness.

70
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:38,980
I'm not yet married,

71
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,460
otherwise, I should call you Sister.

72
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:45,860
How dare you slap me?

73
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,260
Stop.

74
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,700
Yin Moting,

75
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,540
are you helping her against me?

76
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,700
I've asked Father for permission

77
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,500
to marry Qianyu as my concubine.

78
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:18,940
We are a family now.

79
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:23,580
Liar!

80
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:32,100
How dare you slap His Highness?
Someone!

81
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,060
