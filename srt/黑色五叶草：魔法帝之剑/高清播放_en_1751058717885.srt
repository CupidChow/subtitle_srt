1
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,170
Why?

2
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:31,340
Why do you get in my way, Julius?!

3
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:35,840
Because what you're trying to do is wrong, Conrad.

4
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:39,260
You must give up.

5
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,930
You don't have enough magic left in you to resist--

6
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:43,560
The one who's wrong…

7
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:48,020
is you!

8
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:25,760
That sword!

9
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,730
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia!

10
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:42,280
He shortened his own life?

11
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,670
I must create it.

12
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,260
A world where everyone respects each other

13
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,720
and laughs with one another!

14
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,640
How could I be wrong
to want such a world?!

15
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,810
Is this for real?

16
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:42,050
Because there is no future
where you're headed.

17
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:59,230
Even you deny me?!

18
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:03,070
If you seal me right now,

19
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,570
you'll lose access to the Imperial Sword!

20
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:09,030
It does pain us
to lose our national treasure.

21
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:14,370
But we no longer have
enough power to get it back.

22
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:17,380
I take full responsibility for this

23
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:19,710
as the next Wizard King.

24
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:28,760
I won't give up. I will not, Julius!

25
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:31,350
Never giving up is my…

26
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,990
SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

27
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:42,750
CLOVER KINGDOM

28
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,080
Welcome, everyone,

29
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,290
to the festival of magic battles
that takes place once a decade,

30
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,420
the Triumph!

31
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,300
The Triumph is a tournament of duels

32
00:06:30,380 --> 00:06:33,930
to decide the strongest Magic Knight!

33
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:36,310
It's long been said

34
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:38,430
that the mage who wins this tournament

35
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,850
would eventually be chosen
as the Wizard King!

36
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:44,560
As you know,

37
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:47,820
there are nine Magic Knights Squads
consisting of mages

38
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,820
who specialize in battle.

39
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,030
And under the direction
of the Wizard King,

40
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:55,780
the strongest mages
from the top Magic Knights Squad

41
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:58,910
protect the peace
of the Clover Kingdom every day.

42
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,290
We will determine
the strongest member of the Magic Knights.

43
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:05,590
Today is sure to be a memorable day!

44
00:07:06,380 --> 00:07:08,420
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:10,010
The Triumph commences…

46
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:15,470
Now! Shall we?

47
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:30,440
By the way, Klaus,

48
00:07:30,530 --> 00:07:33,320
why were we chosen
as the masters of the ceremony?

49
00:07:33,410 --> 00:07:36,570
Because we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

50
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,240
the Golden Dawn Squad, of course!

51
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,000
Turn off the Amplification Magic first
before you talk!

52
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,830
Oh my, it totally slipped my mind!

53
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,460
Well… pardon the belated introduction.

54
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:48,340
My name is Mimosa Vermillion,
and I'll be your commentator.

55
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:50,000
This here is Klaus.

56
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:53,300
Now is not the time
for introducing ourselves!

57
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:56,550
Who in the world
chose Mimosa as a commentator?

58
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:59,060
But, man, look at all these people.

59
00:07:59,140 --> 00:08:01,020
It's almost a full house.

60
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:04,100
Of course it is. Because, you see…

61
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:14,320
Yuno, my love!

62
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:23,080
In the first round is Yuno,
the vice captain of the Golden Dawn Squad.

63
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,250
Hooray, hooray, Yuno! Go, go, Yuno!

64
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,960
So Pretty Boy is in the first round.

65
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:35,180
Of course, everyone wants to see him.

66
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,180
Right?

67
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:39,850
I only want to see
my dearest little sister, Marie.

68
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,600
As expected from Gauche…

69
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,270
Man, I'm so ready to fight too!

70
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:47,350
I wish Asta could have joined us.

71
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,860
He's in exile because of the demon trial.

72
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,400
What a drag.

73
00:08:53,490 --> 00:08:55,610
Why am I even on the roster?

74
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:57,160
Go for it!

75
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:59,120
Oh, here he comes!

76
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,950
What's that?

77
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,700
Hey, who the hell is that?

78
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,420
Up against Yuno is, um…

79
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,920
"the Masked One"?

80
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,260
There's no way you could enter
with such a ridiculous name…

81
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,380
Oh, you're right.

82
00:09:18,550 --> 00:09:20,640
What's with their getup?

83
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,390
Mocking Yuno, are they?

84
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:27,440
Festival of magic battles, the Triumph.

85
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:30,810
The first round is
Yuno vs. the Masked One.

86
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:31,900
The match begins!

87
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:52,040
Attaboy, Asta!

88
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:57,920
The first attack is by Yuno!

89
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:00,220
He used strong Wind Magic,

90
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,600
but the Masked One cut it in half,

91
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,640
completely neutralizing it!

92
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,930
I guess it's begun.

93
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,830
Well then, Julius, shall we begin as well?

94
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:29,370
Uh-huh!

95
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:32,380
Barrier Magic, "Voodoo Shangrila"!

96
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:44,760
What is this enormous magical power?!

97
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:48,020
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

98
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,650
Today, I will change this country!

99
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,170
How fragile you look, Julius.

100
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:24,640
I absorbed only a little bit of magic,
and this is the toll it takes on you?

101
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,850
I never expected to meet you again.

102
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:31,350
I see. So, back then, you…

103
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:35,150
Yes, I hope
you didn't mind me breaking the seal.

104
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:39,150
You were distracted for a second.

105
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:41,740
And are you still…?

106
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,410
My ambition
has not changed a bit since then.

107
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,620
I must create a world

108
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:52,080
where everyone can respect each other

109
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,290
and laugh with one another.

110
00:11:54,830 --> 00:11:56,460
And for that…

111
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:00,300
My soldiers, it's time for domination.

112
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:03,680
We shall overthrow the Clover Kingdom!

113
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:07,010
Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.

114
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,620
Stop it, Conrad!

115
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,510
All right, old man?

116
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,270
Oh, thank you!

117
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,070
Everyone, this way!

118
00:13:01,150 --> 00:13:03,280
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

119
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:09,950
Klaus, leave this to me!

120
00:13:26,510 --> 00:13:29,430
Why am I being targeted?!

121
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:34,930
Yuno!

122
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:38,900
Jeez, what's up with these guys?!
They totally ruined my perfect disguise!

123
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:42,610
Here I thought you were some lost kid
from the festival who wandered in.

124
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:44,190
Who are you calling a kid?!

125
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,690
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

126
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,530
Whoa!

127
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:50,280
Stupid Asta!

128
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:52,620
You could have told me
you were participating!

129
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,700
Noelle!

130
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,700
I know you probably can't feel it,

131
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:59,370
but it seems like everyone here
is getting their magical power absorbed.

132
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:02,040
Those with little magical power
are unable to move!

133
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:04,920
Oh no, really?! Are you okay?

134
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,460
I'm a royal!

135
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:09,550
A little loss of magic is nothing to me!

136
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,050
Well then, that just means

137
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,930
I'll have to work harder than anyone here!

138
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,600
Don't get too carried away.

139
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,390
I got your back!

140
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,100
You just need to look ahead!

141
00:14:21,190 --> 00:14:23,110
Yeah! Thanks!

142
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:53,220
Those three?

143
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:55,600
But that's impossible!

144
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,680
You must know them
if you're a Wizard King.

145
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,230
Those three who had their status
as Wizard King revoked

146
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:03,860
because of their austerity and cruelty…

147
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:07,020
Who the heck are you?! Is this your doing?

148
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:09,990
What's with this child?
How come he can move?

149
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:11,240
Uh-huh?

150
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,410
He doesn't have
any magical power to begin with.

151
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:17,410
No juice to speak of, huh? What a weirdo.

152
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:22,620
There is no way my soldiers would be
defeated by someone with no magic.

153
00:15:22,710 --> 00:15:24,420
How interesting.

154
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:30,880
I managed to revive them with my magic
and the power of the Imperial Sword.

155
00:15:35,010 --> 00:15:39,930
Unlike you, those three have become
great supporters of my cause.

156
00:15:40,850 --> 00:15:43,560
The four of us will create a new world!

157
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:45,270
That's right.

158
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:47,190
And you're in our way.

159
00:15:47,270 --> 00:15:50,360
Say what?!
I don't know what exactly you're up to,

160
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,860
but I know that you're the bad guys!

161
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:54,530
I will defeat you!

162
00:15:54,610 --> 00:15:56,490
Aren't you a lively one?

163
00:15:57,580 --> 00:16:00,080
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!

164
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,380
He neutralized magic?

165
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:14,510
Conrad, I found a new toy you might like.

166
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,840
You wanna play?

167
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,100
Wizard King, are you all right?!

168
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,440
No, Marx! Stay back!

169
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:31,610
Well, well, that's interesting magic.

170
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,910
Huh, so he's not gonna answer me.

171
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:38,030
I take it I should do whatever I want?

172
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,530
Do not hurt him unnecessarily.

173
00:16:40,620 --> 00:16:43,000
Have the decency
to finish him in one blow.

174
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,120
Hey, my toy!

175
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:52,000
-Asta!
-La!

176
00:16:52,090 --> 00:16:53,920
Thanks, you all!

177
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:05,310
Oh? Nice magic you got there.

178
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:09,560
It's useless against a Wizard King.

179
00:17:09,650 --> 00:17:11,770
What can a normal Magic Knight do?

180
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:17,200
A peasant kid with no magic like him
is a Magic Knight?

181
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,870
It seems things have fallen far, Julius.

182
00:17:21,990 --> 00:17:23,290
I wouldn't be so sure.

183
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,120
Come again?

184
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,330
I don't think we've fallen that much.

185
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,880
Not me, nor the Magic Knights Squads.

186
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:37,090
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

187
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,110
Thanks for waiting!

188
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:00,030
A strong helper is here to assist you!

189
00:18:00,110 --> 00:18:03,030
Wait, what is this sinister magical power?

190
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:07,830
It looks like I can paint
another masterpiece based on this!

191
00:18:07,910 --> 00:18:09,040
You're fighting me!

192
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,080
I'll burn you to ashes
with the flame of justice!

193
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,630
That silhouette… You must be…

194
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,220
Kaiser.

195
00:18:20,050 --> 00:18:21,590
It's been a while.

196
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,510
Captain Yami!

197
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,430
My bad.

198
00:18:24,510 --> 00:18:27,680
I was taking a dump,
and it took me a while so I'm late.

199
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,640
And who are these guys?

200
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,520
Not exactly sure,

201
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,360
but I know they're really bad!

202
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,520
And things are really bad too!

203
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,990
For real? Your vocabulary is really bad.

204
00:18:38,070 --> 00:18:40,110
He isn't wrong, you know.

205
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:43,070
It'd be difficult
to defeat them as we stand.

206
00:18:43,570 --> 00:18:45,580
One possibility would be…

207
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,240
Yami.

208
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:50,960
Please head to the Magic Tool
Research Lab's Branch Zero right away.

209
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,130
I need you to bring the magic tool
we're co-developing with Nero.

210
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,250
-No, thanks.
-Huh?!

211
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:01,970
If I went, then who'll have your back?
You're totally vulnerable.

212
00:19:02,930 --> 00:19:05,970
I have no interest in going through
what I did back then again.

213
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:08,390
Yami…

214
00:19:08,470 --> 00:19:11,520
I mean, if that's all you need,
we can send this guy.

215
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,400
-Hey, kid, you're up.
-Huh?

216
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:16,230
Yo, Finral. You heard him.

217
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,190
Go to Branch Zero with him.

218
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,360
Yes, sir!

219
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,740
But if I went, this place would be…

220
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,780
So this is where you were hiding.

221
00:19:26,870 --> 00:19:28,790
Stop running around.

222
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:30,750
I can't kill you swiftly.

223
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:44,720
Oh?

224
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,640
Stop blubbering and go already!

225
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,310
If you don't come back soon,
I'll kick their butts all by myself!

226
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,230
Yes, sir!

227
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,900
Captain Yami!

228
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:59,320
Quickly, Asta!

229
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:03,490
Because of that black barrier,
it's difficult to maintain spatial magic!

230
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,820
You're a member of the Black Bulls Squad!

231
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,370
Listen to your captain!

232
00:20:08,450 --> 00:20:09,870
Nice, Noelle!

233
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:11,500
Whoa, whoa.

234
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,460
A magic like that exists in this era?

235
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:17,330
Well, I guess I can analyze it later.

236
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:19,000
Whoa.

237
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,630
Voiuvre's Roar!

238
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:32,560
Running away is pointless, I guess.

239
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:36,730
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

240
00:20:36,810 --> 00:20:39,730
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

241
00:20:47,870 --> 00:20:50,370
Their defense is getting
harder and harder.

242
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,950
The kids have come far.

243
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:55,870
No, they've got a long way to go.

244
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:58,960
A long way to go
before they can fight alongside me.

245
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:06,680
I'm sorry, I wasn't able to contain them.

246
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,720
No, you've done well.

247
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:12,220
Thanks to you, I got to send
my guys out on an errand.

248
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:15,180
Whatever you do, it is pointless.

249
00:21:15,270 --> 00:21:17,650
If the Imperial Sword's magic
is activated,

250
00:21:17,730 --> 00:21:20,060
the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed.

251
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:23,400
Repeating the same thing
from ten years ago.

252
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,400
Wait, wasn't the Imperial Sword
something that could absorb

253
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,320
and store magical power and stuff?

254
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:33,950
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

255
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,710
It can unleash
the stored magical power all at once.

256
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:42,340
Right now, the magical power
absorbed from everyone at the stadium

257
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:44,380
is stored inside the Imperial Sword.

258
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,840
With his magic,

259
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:50,760
he could abuse that magical power
and the Imperial Sword as he wishes.

260
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:54,970
"Abuse"? I'm using it to save the world.

261
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:58,100
I'd say it's the proper way to use it.

262
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:08,450
Are you all right, Wizard King?

263
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,530
We have completed
the evacuation of the audience.

264
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:14,120
All that's left is to defeat the rebels.

265
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,450
Fuegoleon and Nozel.

266
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,620
Have you gotten any stronger?

267
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:23,710
I never expected to fight
this monster again.

268
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,050
Oh yeah, back then,

269
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,680
Nozel got spooked, fell down,
cried, and soiled his pants, didn't he?

270
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,840
Want me to dunk you in mercury, foreigner?

271
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,430
Hey, those guys weren't there back then.

272
00:22:34,510 --> 00:22:35,390
Who are they?

273
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:38,640
That woman's magic,
which produces magic soldiers…

274
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,890
I remember seeing it
in my great-grandfather's journal.

275
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:44,730
My sister was captivated by it,
so I remember it well.

276
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,650
No way!

277
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:49,400
Historical figures who died long ago…

278
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,410
Wait, does that mean
former Wizard Kings have returned?

279
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,200
Seriously?

280
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,620
I gotta get their autographs
and scalp them.

281
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,960
The former Wizard Kings have been revived?

282
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:04,250
It's so strange. I'm awake for a change,

283
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,880
but this is like a dream.

284
00:23:07,250 --> 00:23:09,630
It gives me lots of inspiration!

285
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,470
But maybe now's not the time for that.

286
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:19,020
You seem to have gathered enough people,

287
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,430
but this is where it ends.

288
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:36,200
There are countless singular points
where veins of mana interact.

289
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:38,330
This stadium is one of them.

290
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:40,750
Ten years ago,

291
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:42,870
I altered this stadium

292
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:44,540
and turned it into a weapon.

293
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,800
You all interrupted me
before I could activate it.

294
00:24:23,500 --> 00:24:25,250
The festival stadium.

295
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,840
Also known as
the "Triumph" flying fortress.

296
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:34,260
Now, there's no way to escape.

297
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:39,010
Julius, it's time to turn the hands
of the clock you took away from me.

298
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,190
Here we are. This is Branch Zero.

299
00:24:51,610 --> 00:24:53,030
Hey!

300
00:24:53,110 --> 00:24:56,780
I'm Asta from
the Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad!

301
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:58,030
Open the door!

302
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,370
That won't do, Asta.

303
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:04,500
Only a limited number of nobles
know about this lab.

304
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,250
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magic…

305
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,590
You are…

306
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,470
You must be the Black Bulls.

307
00:25:17,470 --> 00:25:21,260
I'm Millie Maxwell,
the coordinator at this branch.

308
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:22,970
Come on, hurry up.

309
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:24,350
Alright!

310
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:27,100
We've been debriefed about the situation.

311
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:30,110
From here on, she will show you around.

312
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:33,320
I'll leave you to it.

313
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:34,740
Nero!

314
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,820
The magic tool Julius needs

315
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:41,330
is stored in a place quite far away.

316
00:25:41,830 --> 00:25:43,950
Right now, Sally is making an adjustment.

317
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,410
Experiment, experiment!

318
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,500
So Sally is here too, huh?

319
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:53,170
Nero, you've watched the Clover Kingdom

320
00:25:53,250 --> 00:25:55,380
over the last 500 years, right?

321
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:59,550
Do you know the people
who attacked the stadium?

322
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,970
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,390
I don't know everything, but…

324
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:07,230
the mastermind is Conrad Leto.

325
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,190
What?

326
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:10,650
I believe you've at least heard the name?

327
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:12,150
Conrad?

328
00:26:13,110 --> 00:26:13,980
You don't mean…

329
00:26:17,190 --> 00:26:18,030
Yes.

330
00:26:18,570 --> 00:26:21,280
He used to be
a Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom.

331
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:24,950
He's the predecessor of Julius Novachrono.

332
00:26:25,910 --> 00:26:27,450
A former Wizard King.

333
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:32,960
But I thought the former Wizard King
died from a disease ten years ago.

334
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,170
I'll explain.

335
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,170
Get on.

336
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,300
Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King.

337
00:26:43,390 --> 00:26:45,930
Before he was chosen as the Wizard King,

338
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:48,730
he was known as a powerful man
in the Clover Kingdom.

339
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,520
He became a Magic Knight captain,

340
00:26:53,060 --> 00:26:56,280
establishing an impressive track record
with his squad.

341
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:59,360
The citizens trusted him,

342
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,660
and his abilities were recognized.

343
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,070
He was finally chosen
to be the Wizard King.

344
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:07,240
But he changed.

345
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:10,580
He rebelled against the Kingdom,

346
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:13,580
and as a result,
his status as the Wizard King was revoked.

347
00:27:14,210 --> 00:27:15,750
"Rebelled against"?

348
00:27:18,090 --> 00:27:20,420
He tried to destroy the country.

349
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:24,220
What?! The Wizard King's job
is to protect the peace for everyone.

350
00:27:24,300 --> 00:27:26,720
Why did he try to do something so crazy?

351
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,220
I don't know.

352
00:27:29,020 --> 00:27:30,680
But he used Lemiel's…

353
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:33,850
He used
the first Wizard King's magic item,

354
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:37,190
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia,
to make it happen.

355
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:40,440
Julius and the others learned of his plan

356
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,070
and sealed Conrad to stop him.

357
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:44,200
"Sealed"?

358
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:48,330
They announced that he died of an illness
so as not to panic the citizens.

359
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,160
The current Wizard King, Julius,

360
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:55,790
couldn't defeat him, even with all
the Magic Knights Squad elites.

361
00:27:56,590 --> 00:27:57,920
Julius had no choice

362
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,590
but to use his Time Magic
to continue sealing him.

363
00:28:01,670 --> 00:28:03,630
He's incredibly strong.

364
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,010
What kind of magic does he use?

365
00:28:06,090 --> 00:28:06,970
Key Magic.

366
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,310
He can open or close
anything and everything

367
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,310
with a key he creates with his magic.

368
00:28:12,890 --> 00:28:15,310
The magic space he opens with his key

369
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:17,440
can absorb anything.

370
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,110
Magic tools, grimoires.

371
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,860
Even magic itself…

372
00:28:21,940 --> 00:28:22,860
Magic itself?!

373
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,990
What? No way!

374
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:25,910
Yes.

375
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:29,240
He can steal the magic of others.

376
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:33,000
And he can use it as he pleases.

377
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:38,040
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

378
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,060
How far are we going?

379
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:56,100
The security is extremely tight.

380
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,310
Indeed.

381
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,020
Because beyond this point…

382
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,330
This is the innermost part of Branch Zero.

383
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:20,040
This is where we store and research
the most important magic tools in the lab.

384
00:29:21,170 --> 00:29:24,380
Is what we've been asked to retrieve
also rare?

385
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,300
Yes.

386
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
It controls the power
of the Imperial Sword

387
00:29:27,970 --> 00:29:29,930
that Prince Lemiel was developing.

388
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:33,140
Something that serves as a sheath
for the Imperial Sword.

389
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:35,480
It's still a prototype,

390
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,020
but we'll have to use it to seal Conrad.

391
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,320
How?!

392
00:29:47,150 --> 00:29:51,780
I had high hopes hearing that
it was a magic tool Lemiel was working on.

393
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:54,540
But it turns out it was just a toy.

394
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,830
-Don't!
-Sally!

395
00:30:00,130 --> 00:30:02,000
Demon Slayer!

396
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:07,630
Oh?

397
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:13,260
Finral!

398
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:19,690
I know you.

399
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,780
How did you find this place?!

400
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:28,570
You're Secré Swallowtail,

401
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:31,160
a member of the Black Bulls Squad.

402
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:33,330
And you too, Asta.

403
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,080
Noelle Silva.

404
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,450
Finral Roulacase.

405
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:42,040
Memory Exchange Magic, which allows
you to peek at someone else's memory.

406
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,630
It's a magic of poor taste,

407
00:30:44,710 --> 00:30:48,220
but thanks to that,
I was able to easily locate this place.

408
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,970
You used Marx's…

409
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,970
I'll tell you one more thing.

410
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:57,180
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

411
00:30:57,270 --> 00:31:01,230
Surrender immediately
and offer your magical power as a tribute.

412
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:02,940
Resistance is futile.

413
00:31:03,610 --> 00:31:05,730
My Legion Magic soldiers

414
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:09,190
will stop at nothing
until their last bit of power is spent!

415
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:12,990
One of the former Wizard Kings, Princia.

416
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,160
The Imperial Sword is supplying her
with the magical power it stored,

417
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:18,910
and her magic will have no limit.

418
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:22,460
The Magic Knights Squads
have been wiped out.

419
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:26,460
The citizens and the major facilities
of the kingdom have all been seized.

420
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:28,210
No way…

421
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:30,130
Impressive, no?

422
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:32,260
Tens of thousands…

423
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:36,470
She can create even more magic soldiers.

424
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:40,600
You're being invaded by a military power
equal to an entire country.

425
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,650
Those captains who helped you escape…

426
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,980
Captain Yami!

427
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:53,910
As you can see, they just went to sleep.

428
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,490
The people at the stadium…

429
00:31:56,990 --> 00:31:58,910
Brother Nozel!

430
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,540
You're the youngest daughter
of the Silvas?

431
00:32:02,620 --> 00:32:05,420
A leftover child
of the Steel War Princess,

432
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,920
Acier Silva.

433
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:11,550
How pathetic of Nozel
to fall before his little sister.

434
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,180
To think that a coward like him

435
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:16,720
is the Magic Knights Captain!

436
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:20,520
Sea Dragon's Roar!

437
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:31,440
Noelle! Dammit!

438
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:33,320
Oh?

439
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,950
Still rough around the edges,
but this water magic is of high purity.

440
00:32:37,530 --> 00:32:38,910
I will take it.

441
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:49,630
When there is such a clear difference
in abilities, it's so easy to take magic.

442
00:32:52,550 --> 00:32:55,430
My magic…

443
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:04,060
Bastard… What did you do to Noelle?!

444
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:06,690
Learn this the hard way.

445
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:10,520
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar.

446
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,780
That's Noelle's magic…

447
00:33:20,870 --> 00:33:21,790
Give it back to her!

448
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:39,140
I'll defeat you here and now!

449
00:33:39,220 --> 00:33:42,640
So this is Anti-Magic,
the power to neutralize magic.

450
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:28,350
Demon-Destroyer!

451
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,570
What a wonderful power you possess.

452
00:34:34,150 --> 00:34:36,150
It can neutralize not only magic,

453
00:34:36,230 --> 00:34:39,150
but also phenomena derived from magic.

454
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:42,030
I'd like to take your magic as well,

455
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:44,410
but perhaps I should refrain.

456
00:34:45,160 --> 00:34:47,660
I wouldn't want it
to affect my other magic.

457
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:49,790
Let's talk.

458
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:52,420
The paths we walk are one and the same.

459
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,460
What the heck are you talking about now?!

460
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,630
Of course they're not!

461
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:59,590
The magic tool developed by Lemiel,
the first Wizard King,

462
00:34:59,670 --> 00:35:01,340
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia.

463
00:35:02,430 --> 00:35:05,560
It is quite compatible with my Key Magic.

464
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:09,980
The Imperial Sword was created
to leave behind the exceptional magic

465
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:13,060
of great mages and heroes
as a legacy for future generations.

466
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:16,650
It stores every Wizard King's magic
and wisdom,

467
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:19,740
not to mention a part of their souls.

468
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,990
And one more thing.

469
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:24,820
Using the function to absorb, store,

470
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:28,240
and unleash the magical power all at once,

471
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,000
I will compound
the generations of Wizard Kings' magic…

472
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,120
FLAME EARTH WATER WIND

473
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,580
…with the plethora of magic I've stolen

474
00:35:34,670 --> 00:35:37,630
and create Gargantuan Compound Magic!

475
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:42,930
Our goal is to drive that
into the vein of the earth here.

476
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,890
It will cause unprecedented disaster.

477
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:49,270
The foundation of the continent
will be destroyed,

478
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:51,770
and every single citizen will die.

479
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,440
But have no fear.

480
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:57,860
The Imperial Sword
can store the departed souls.

481
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,360
So we will select

482
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:02,650
and bring back only those people
who are valuable enough

483
00:36:02,740 --> 00:36:04,410
to live in the new world!

484
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:07,120
I've seen it in people's memories.

485
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,250
I was once loathed
and disliked because of my magic.

486
00:36:10,330 --> 00:36:12,410
So I know exactly how you feel.

487
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,170
Those with magical power own everything,

488
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:18,040
and those without die helplessly.

489
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:20,630
It's impossible, Asta.

490
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,800
We must destroy everything first.

491
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,640
Join me and together we'll create

492
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:31,930
an ideal world where everyone respects
each other and laughs with one another!

493
00:36:32,850 --> 00:36:36,940
Everyone who lives there respects
each other and laughs with one another.

494
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:40,020
That's the country I want to create
when I become the Wizard King!

495
00:36:40,110 --> 00:36:41,400
No!

496
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:44,150
That's bullshit!

497
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:49,660
The Wizard King is there
to protect the nation and its people!

498
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,160
I will not let you destroy it!

499
00:36:52,250 --> 00:36:54,660
That's not what the Wizard King does!

500
00:36:55,540 --> 00:36:58,380
An ideal world will be built
upon the meaningless lives

501
00:36:58,460 --> 00:37:00,670
of those who are oppressed.

502
00:37:01,550 --> 00:37:04,510
I can give meaning to their lives!

503
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,380
Why can't you see that?!

504
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,350
Of course I can't!
What you're saying is absolutely crazy!

505
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:17,230
You don't see
the true nature of the world yet.

506
00:37:17,810 --> 00:37:18,730
I'm disappointed.

507
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,190
Shut up!

508
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:25,150
You're just thinking of yourself!

509
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:36,660
Why can't you understand?!

510
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,340
I know you've experienced it!

511
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:46,760
The unfairness! The betrayal!
And the inequality of this country!

512
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,350
Choose, Asta.

513
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,520
Walk this path with me

514
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,980
or die.

515
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,960
Give up already, Asta.

516
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,670
You are me.

517
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:26,090
You can be me.

518
00:38:27,550 --> 00:38:30,970
By dawn tomorrow,
the fusion of magic will be complete.

519
00:38:31,050 --> 00:38:33,350
At that point, you will be…

520
00:38:36,220 --> 00:38:41,230
Give… Noelle back… her magic…

521
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:44,190
I see.

522
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,360
It's truly regrettable.

523
00:38:50,530 --> 00:38:51,490
I will

524
00:38:52,410 --> 00:38:53,910
not give up.

525
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:57,450
Never giving up

526
00:38:58,450 --> 00:39:00,870
is my magic!

527
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,800
I have no magical power left.

528
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,680
What do I do?

529
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,640
But we still have to give it a try!

530
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,110
You… you're Yuno!

531
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,110
Millie!

532
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,200
He insisted he came to help you all.

533
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:36,830
Drink up, Sally!

534
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,870
Okay.

535
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:42,920
Sorry, but we'll have to play this by ear.

536
00:39:43,460 --> 00:39:44,830
Play it by ear?

537
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,380
Sounds fun!

538
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:47,920
Not at all.

539
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,840
It's the phrase
I hate the most in the world.

540
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:17,450
Yuno…

541
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,580
I never thought I'd use it like this,

542
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,460
but let's try and activate it
with all the magic we have!

543
00:40:29,550 --> 00:40:30,840
Nonsense.

544
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,720
It may be. But…

545
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:35,050
I can hit you thanks to everyone's help!

546
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,050
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

547
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:47,770
He's a monster!

548
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,400
We'll retreat for now!

549
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,550
It's me. How is the fusion of magic going?

550
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:18,010
Uh-huh? We're at about 20%.

551
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:20,220
Generally speaking, it's going well.

552
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:23,600
It should be completed by dawn,
as scheduled.

553
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,060
Understood.

554
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:27,150
Thank you.

555
00:41:27,230 --> 00:41:29,230
For walking this path with me.

556
00:41:29,900 --> 00:41:31,360
Finally, we'll create it.

557
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:32,940
The strongest country

558
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:35,740
with no tears and where no one
is robbed of what they have!

559
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:40,120
Once again, save the poor lost souls…

560
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:46,330
What I seek is a world
where no one oppresses or is oppressed.

561
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:51,170
I trust that you can achieve that, Conrad.

562
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:52,840
Yes.

563
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:55,170
How about the veins?

564
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:59,140
Uh-huh? I found the perfect one.

565
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:01,300
It's at a village called Hage,

566
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:05,060
in the Forsaken Realm
where the demon's skeleton lies.

567
00:42:13,440 --> 00:42:18,030
My Key Magic is useless
unless I borrow someone's power.

568
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:22,910
That's why it is meaningful
that I'm the one who finishes this.

569
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:26,830
One day, I will even change this country.

570
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:33,500
Never giving up is my magic!

571
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,720
Never giving up…

572
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:03,160
Where am I?

573
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:06,950
Oh, Noelle!

574
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:09,710
You're awake.

575
00:43:09,790 --> 00:43:12,380
I'm sorry that all I could provide
was first aid.

576
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,710
Mimosa.

577
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:15,920
You're safe.

578
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:24,260
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

579
00:43:24,890 --> 00:43:26,760
It's still under construction,

580
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:28,560
so only a few members know about it.

581
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,270
We were almost captured
and our magic stolen,

582
00:43:33,350 --> 00:43:35,440
but the captains let us escape.

583
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:44,410
Take care of the kid for me.

584
00:43:46,620 --> 00:43:49,040
I don't know what happened afterwards,

585
00:43:49,120 --> 00:43:51,330
but if they're not here yet…

586
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:56,210
Hey, are you okay?

587
00:43:56,290 --> 00:43:58,460
Asta! Please excuse me.

588
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,670
Asta!

589
00:44:00,760 --> 00:44:03,180
You should not move
until the treatment is over.

590
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:07,180
Conrad… needs to be stopped.

591
00:44:07,970 --> 00:44:10,310
He's going to destroy this kingdom.

592
00:44:10,890 --> 00:44:12,230
If we don't do something,

593
00:44:12,310 --> 00:44:14,730
it will happen tomorrow at dawn!

594
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:16,150
At dawn?

595
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,400
But if the enemies are so formidable…

596
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:20,610
Why would a former Wizard King…

597
00:44:20,690 --> 00:44:22,990
What could we possibly do by ourselves?

598
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:28,200
What could we do?

599
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,330
Now that it's come to this,
we should run away!

600
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:33,370
There's nothing we can do with so few,

601
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:35,750
and who knows when they'll find us here!

602
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,750
Let's run!

603
00:44:36,830 --> 00:44:38,250
To some other country!

604
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:40,760
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.

605
00:44:41,460 --> 00:44:44,260
This is not a problem we alone can solve…

606
00:44:44,340 --> 00:44:46,760
Yes, we could ask other nations for help.

607
00:44:47,470 --> 00:44:50,560
There are injured people.
Getting them to the border would be tough.

608
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,940
If the enemy is the former Wizard King,
do we have any chance of winning?

609
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:55,900
With Julius gone…

610
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,020
What could we do by ourselves?

611
00:44:59,980 --> 00:45:02,780
We gotta do something!

612
00:45:02,860 --> 00:45:04,320
If we cave in,

613
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:07,740
then who will protect this kingdom
and everyone in it?

614
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,410
Aren't we the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom?!

615
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,420
We've been able to live
happily and peacefully

616
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:20,670
thanks to the Wizard King
and the Magic Knights Squads!

617
00:45:21,170 --> 00:45:26,090
Before we joined, or when we were kids,
or even before we were born,

618
00:45:26,630 --> 00:45:29,680
the Magic Knights Squads
were fighting for us.

619
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:35,690
And the Wizard King has stood
at the helm to protect this kingdom.

620
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:39,190
It's thanks to those efforts
made by one person for another

621
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:42,440
that the Clover Kingdom exists now.

622
00:45:42,530 --> 00:45:44,490
That's why we are here!

623
00:45:44,570 --> 00:45:45,700
Asta…

624
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,240
I can't just sit and watch!

625
00:45:48,820 --> 00:45:50,030
It's my turn to protect

626
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:54,500
what the Wizard King
and the captains have protected!

627
00:45:55,250 --> 00:45:59,670
But it's not just me. It's our turn!

628
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:03,170
I can heal an injury like this
with my fighting spirit!

629
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:07,010
And then I will kick his butt,
for real this time!

630
00:46:17,230 --> 00:46:19,770
With all of us, we can stop Conrad!

631
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:23,940
We may not be strong enough by ourselves,

632
00:46:24,030 --> 00:46:27,610
but if we come together,
we can become an immense force!

633
00:46:28,780 --> 00:46:32,280
That's why we,
the Magic Knights Squads, are strong!

634
00:46:33,370 --> 00:46:36,200
If all the Magic Knights Squads
join their power,

635
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:38,500
we could face any enemy!

636
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:41,830
I'm not forcing you to come with me.

637
00:46:42,710 --> 00:46:44,170
Like Sekke said,

638
00:46:44,250 --> 00:46:47,800
you can still escape to the Heart Kingdom
or elsewhere if you go now.

639
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:53,350
But if any of you
is willing to lend me your power…

640
00:46:55,890 --> 00:46:58,890
Jeez, what you suggest is so reckless.

641
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:03,110
But coming from you, who's trying to do
the most reckless thing,

642
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,320
I guess I can't say no.

643
00:47:17,160 --> 00:47:20,540
I'm not letting you go alone.
Not a chance.

644
00:47:27,170 --> 00:47:29,220
The Wizard King isn't here!

645
00:47:29,300 --> 00:47:31,550
We don't have the captains to rely on!

646
00:47:31,630 --> 00:47:33,760
But that doesn't matter!

647
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:36,310
Now it's our turn to carry on!

648
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,930
We'll fight on their behalf!

649
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,560
I'll say it again.

650
00:47:41,640 --> 00:47:45,610
We are the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom!

651
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:48,070
Right here, right now!
We'll surpass our limits,

652
00:47:48,150 --> 00:47:49,860
and protect this country!

653
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,820
Yeah!

654
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:54,200
And what is the actual plan?

655
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:56,530
I'm going to figure that out now!

656
00:47:56,620 --> 00:47:57,830
What?!

657
00:47:57,910 --> 00:48:00,040
I can't take this anymore, bwa-ha!

658
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,420
Now that it has come to this,
I have to escape, even if it's just me!

659
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:06,840
Huh?

660
00:48:06,920 --> 00:48:08,050
Bwa-ha!

661
00:48:13,430 --> 00:48:14,640
Without any plans…

662
00:48:17,430 --> 00:48:21,140
Stop boasting, you imbecile!

663
00:48:31,240 --> 00:48:33,650
Lady Big-sis-leon! Everyone else, too!

664
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,160
I didn't know you were alive! Ouch!

665
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:40,040
Who are you calling "Big-sis-leon"?

666
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:41,160
And don't assume I'm dead.

667
00:48:42,290 --> 00:48:44,870
I was away for training.

668
00:48:47,790 --> 00:48:48,840
But it seems…

669
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:52,550
something fun is going on.

670
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,180
I've also been away
on a mission with Jack.

671
00:48:57,760 --> 00:49:01,390
Which is why I didn't get caught by
pursuers and was able to arrive here.

672
00:49:02,770 --> 00:49:04,190
Same for me.

673
00:49:04,270 --> 00:49:06,350
We must go rescue everyone.

674
00:49:06,440 --> 00:49:07,690
Hehe.

675
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:11,360
Some of the people who went on a mission
with us are fine as well.

676
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:16,240
They're out there,
surveilling that huge flying fortress.

677
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:20,700
It looks like Yami
and the other captains are alive.

678
00:49:21,290 --> 00:49:24,410
They're trapped inside a barrier though.

679
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:25,870
Captain Yami!

680
00:49:25,960 --> 00:49:27,460
My brother Nozel!

681
00:49:27,540 --> 00:49:30,210
Yami! I'm so glad!

682
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:32,380
But I don't get it.

683
00:49:32,460 --> 00:49:35,720
Why have the enemy captured
the citizens and the Magic Knights Squads

684
00:49:36,220 --> 00:49:37,470
but are keeping them alive?

685
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,800
Because they need their magical powers.

686
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:44,600
If they absorb power through the Sword
and supply it to their members,

687
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:46,730
they will never run out of magical power.

688
00:49:46,810 --> 00:49:49,360
Hehe, so they're the feed.

689
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:53,110
Oh man! He also mentioned
that he needs lots of magical power

690
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,240
for his crazy ambition to come true!

691
00:49:55,820 --> 00:49:57,910
So that's why he's keeping them alive.

692
00:49:57,990 --> 00:50:00,820
So if their magical power runs out,
Yami and the others will be…

693
00:50:01,830 --> 00:50:03,370
We don't have much time left.

694
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:04,910
Asta, everyone.

695
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:07,750
Let's join forces
to take back this kingdom.

696
00:50:08,250 --> 00:50:09,210
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

697
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:14,050
Before we do, we must eat-la!

698
00:50:23,760 --> 00:50:26,930
Oh! Charmy, you're okay!

699
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,850
Yup. Thanks to Rouge and Captain Yami,
who let me escape.

700
00:50:31,810 --> 00:50:33,610
Oh! You all!

701
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:36,440
Noelle, I'm glad you're okay.

702
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:39,910
Our base was trapped
inside the barrier as well.

703
00:50:40,530 --> 00:50:44,240
Henry and Gordon are trapped inside,
but they're okay for now.

704
00:50:44,330 --> 00:50:45,410
Then,

705
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:49,000
we gotta go get them, right?

706
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:52,080
The base of the Black Bulls…

707
00:50:56,130 --> 00:50:59,340
The Imperial Sword has collected
the magical power of all the citizens,

708
00:50:59,430 --> 00:51:02,010
which will be driven into
a "singular point" vein of mana.

709
00:51:02,090 --> 00:51:06,310
Ha! Then that's the end for this kingdom.

710
00:51:06,390 --> 00:51:08,100
The enemy Wizard Kings

711
00:51:08,180 --> 00:51:12,020
must have been revived with
the Imperial Sword and Conrad's magic.

712
00:51:12,980 --> 00:51:17,530
So if we destroy the Imperial Sword,
do we stop the power of the Wizard Kings?

713
00:51:18,360 --> 00:51:20,530
Judging from Conrad's actions,

714
00:51:20,610 --> 00:51:22,030
that's highly likely.

715
00:51:23,200 --> 00:51:24,030
Very well!

716
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:27,660
The final goal is to destroy
the Imperial Sword and neutralize it!

717
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:31,460
Go and prepare for encountering the enemy!

718
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:35,670
We don't have much time before dawn,
our time limit!

719
00:51:45,050 --> 00:51:47,510
I still can't use
the spells in my grimoire,

720
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:50,600
but thanks to Charmy,
my magic has returned.

721
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:54,270
I'll focus on what I can do now!

722
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:10,790
Yuno!

723
00:52:15,960 --> 00:52:17,540
Are you ready, Asta?

724
00:52:18,250 --> 00:52:19,090
Yeah!

725
00:52:22,510 --> 00:52:26,100
BLACK BULLS SQUAD BASE

726
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:31,020
This is strange. When I got back
from training, there was only Henry here.

727
00:52:31,100 --> 00:52:34,940
And former Wizard Kings have been revived,
and they've taken over the capital…

728
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,280
I'm going to retake the base!

729
00:52:47,370 --> 00:52:50,410
First, we will go and rescue
those at the Black Bulls base.

730
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:53,830
Are you sure?

731
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:58,090
This plan depends on how much
fighting power we can preserve.

732
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:03,220
For that, we need something that allows us
to move safely but in large numbers.

733
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:04,130
I see.

734
00:53:05,010 --> 00:53:06,260
Don't you get it?

735
00:53:06,930 --> 00:53:09,100
At your base, that's possible.

736
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:15,310
But Conrad is a formidable foe
who uses many types of magic at will.

737
00:53:15,940 --> 00:53:19,190
Normal magic attacks will be canceled out.

738
00:53:19,270 --> 00:53:21,480
And that's where you come in, Asta.

739
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:26,530
Since you have Anti-Magic,
which neutralizes any kind of magic,

740
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,200
only you have the chance to defeat Conrad.

741
00:53:29,910 --> 00:53:31,700
This is the key point of the plan.

742
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:35,080
Please stop Conrad. Can I count on you?

743
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:37,040
Yes, sir!

744
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,630
All right!

745
00:53:48,930 --> 00:53:50,350
Welcome back, everyone.

746
00:53:50,890 --> 00:53:52,180
And we have so many guests…

747
00:53:52,260 --> 00:53:54,220
That's the story, Henry.

748
00:53:54,310 --> 00:53:56,560
Can you do it?

749
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,440
Okay!

750
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:06,150
Well then! You recover
the magic you lost by eating-la!

751
00:54:08,860 --> 00:54:15,450
I've never felt
this much magical power before!

752
00:54:38,140 --> 00:54:39,770
Cool!

753
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,610
So this is the flying style
of the Black Bulls!

754
00:54:42,690 --> 00:54:45,730
Is this really going to fly?

755
00:54:45,820 --> 00:54:51,110
If there's enough magical power,

756
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:52,910
I think it will--

757
00:54:57,790 --> 00:55:00,460
More than we expected, huh?

758
00:55:00,540 --> 00:55:01,960
Hehe!

759
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:03,540
Severing Magic…

760
00:55:06,130 --> 00:55:09,300
Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

761
00:55:10,630 --> 00:55:12,340
Briar Magic…

762
00:55:13,140 --> 00:55:14,640
Crimson Vine Spear.

763
00:55:23,940 --> 00:55:25,820
A drop in a bucket, was it?

764
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:28,320
Hehe! How annoying.

765
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:30,740
What?!

766
00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:31,950
Bwa-ha!

767
00:55:38,870 --> 00:55:42,420
Hehe! Looks like this is worth severing!

768
00:55:43,130 --> 00:55:45,130
We will stop them here!

769
00:55:45,790 --> 00:55:48,130
You all go on ahead!

770
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:50,550
Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!

771
00:55:50,630 --> 00:55:52,260
This will be pointless if you go!

772
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:55,550
But those two alone couldn't…

773
00:55:56,140 --> 00:55:57,930
It might be impossible, yes.

774
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:58,850
Then,

775
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:00,520
how about three?

776
00:56:08,610 --> 00:56:09,780
World Tree Magic…

777
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,990
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

778
00:56:21,330 --> 00:56:23,210
Now, go while you can!

779
00:56:23,290 --> 00:56:24,540
Captain Vangeance!

780
00:56:24,630 --> 00:56:27,380
Are you ready?

781
00:56:50,150 --> 00:56:51,190
Yuno.

782
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,240
I'm leaving the Wizard King in your care.

783
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,360
Well then,

784
00:56:55,450 --> 00:56:57,910
let's have the barbarous guests leave.

785
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,080
Listen up, everyone!

786
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:09,420
We are minus three captains,
but we'll head into enemy territory…

787
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:11,170
No, Asta.

788
00:57:11,250 --> 00:57:12,170
You tell them.

789
00:57:17,930 --> 00:57:20,180
Okay, let's go, everyone!

790
00:57:20,260 --> 00:57:22,020
We'll kick their butts

791
00:57:22,100 --> 00:57:25,230
and get the Clover Kingdom back!

792
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,230
Yeah!

793
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:34,700
A report from my soldiers.

794
00:57:34,780 --> 00:57:38,620
The rebels have started to move.
How shall I deal with them?

795
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,870
So you're here.

796
00:57:42,040 --> 00:57:45,040
That's right. I knew you would come.

797
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:48,130
It is time for the finale.

798
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:50,880
I saved you the best seat.

799
00:57:51,750 --> 00:57:53,960
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

800
00:57:54,050 --> 00:57:56,130
even after I've lost most of my power?

801
00:57:56,220 --> 00:57:59,180
Those you love, those you want to protect.

802
00:57:59,720 --> 00:58:04,140
Burn into your eyes the image of
your trusted ones dying miserable deaths.

803
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:07,690
Die as you agonize
over how powerless you are.

804
00:58:08,730 --> 00:58:11,770
This is the beginning
of a new Clover Kingdom.

805
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:14,900
Let us turn a new page!

806
00:58:29,000 --> 00:58:31,630
What is that?!

807
00:58:33,710 --> 00:58:36,880
Whoa, it's enormous!

808
00:58:36,970 --> 00:58:41,640
It's incomparable to the one that was
at the Magic Knights Squad base!

809
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,100
Everyone, look!

810
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:54,020
Well, well, let me see
the last squeeze of power you have.

811
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:55,780
And let me teach you

812
00:58:56,490 --> 00:59:00,780
that the Wizard King
is never caught off-guard!

813
00:59:08,290 --> 00:59:10,710
So, what are you going to do?

814
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,630
This is the power of the Wizard King?

815
00:59:15,710 --> 00:59:18,470
It's in another league! What should we do?

816
00:59:19,340 --> 00:59:20,430
Asta!

817
00:59:21,840 --> 00:59:23,550
It's not your turn yet!

818
00:59:24,050 --> 00:59:26,520
What do we do?
More like, what don't we do?

819
00:59:26,600 --> 00:59:30,310
We've always surpassed our limits, right?

820
00:59:34,730 --> 00:59:36,440
Ready, you guys?

821
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,650
-Let's show him what we're made of!
-Yeah!

822
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,620
Flame Magic: Exploding Fireball!

823
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:46,620
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

824
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:49,620
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

825
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:51,830
Everyone!

826
00:59:52,330 --> 00:59:54,210
Are you ready?

827
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:56,710
Yeah!

828
01:00:01,220 --> 01:00:04,260
Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Refrain!

829
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:09,770
Go!

830
01:00:23,660 --> 01:00:26,120
Bwa-ha! Again?!

831
01:00:26,200 --> 01:00:27,330
Now's the chance!

832
01:00:27,410 --> 01:00:29,700
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

833
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:34,710
Well, well.

834
01:00:34,790 --> 01:00:39,170
Whoa, whoa, we're about to arrive
at the enormous barrier!

835
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,130
The space is shut off from here on,

836
01:00:42,220 --> 01:00:44,180
so I can't break through with my magic.

837
01:00:44,970 --> 01:00:46,930
So, I'm counting on you.

838
01:00:52,140 --> 01:00:53,980
I know you can do this.

839
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:55,650
Asta!

840
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:10,790
Stop running around!

841
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:18,540
Thanks for voluntarily walking
into the trap.

842
01:01:18,630 --> 01:01:21,250
Magic like this will not--

843
01:01:21,340 --> 01:01:23,590
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

844
01:01:25,090 --> 01:01:27,550
Finral, now! Do it quickly!

845
01:01:27,640 --> 01:01:30,810
Alright! Not said this in a while,
but remember I'm your senior!

846
01:01:31,970 --> 01:01:33,560
Good. Now…

847
01:01:41,230 --> 01:01:42,440
Didn't I tell you?

848
01:01:42,530 --> 01:01:44,360
I'm never caught off-guard!

849
01:01:58,460 --> 01:02:00,500
Thank you so much!

850
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:11,140
Uh-huh? This special barrier has been
fortified with the Imperial Sword,

851
01:02:11,220 --> 01:02:14,890
so even if it gets broken,
it'll regenerate and not be a problem.

852
01:02:14,980 --> 01:02:20,440
To create the perfect world, we should
get rid of those who get in our way.

853
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:22,270
This is the end!

854
01:02:22,770 --> 01:02:23,690
For you!

855
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:33,990
I love it, I love it! Struggle for me.

856
01:02:34,080 --> 01:02:36,710
Mana Zone: Fangs of Riot…

857
01:02:36,790 --> 01:02:37,750
Double Attacks!

858
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,420
Was that supposed to hurt me?!

859
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,880
Now! Fire at will!

860
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,220
One more time!

861
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,600
Are you ready?

862
01:03:01,770 --> 01:03:04,020
I love it, you guys.

863
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:05,570
Bring it on!

864
01:03:17,450 --> 01:03:20,620
-Go!
-Go!

865
01:03:30,220 --> 01:03:32,590
Ha! Are you serious?

866
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,890
You guys are amazing!

867
01:03:35,720 --> 01:03:36,600
However!

868
01:03:37,970 --> 01:03:39,140
Everyone!

869
01:03:39,810 --> 01:03:41,390
I'm counting on you, Asta!

870
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:43,730
You defeat him!

871
01:03:43,810 --> 01:03:47,190
Alright! I'm off!

872
01:03:49,740 --> 01:03:51,150
Hey, check that out.

873
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,160
Conrad?!

874
01:03:53,740 --> 01:03:55,120
Why is he there?

875
01:03:56,120 --> 01:03:58,120
Oh, the singular point…

876
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:01,920
Is it the skeleton of a demon?

877
01:04:05,750 --> 01:04:07,710
Uh-huh!

878
01:04:08,380 --> 01:04:12,180
Don't you dare get in our way!

879
01:04:20,020 --> 01:04:22,690
Asta! You go to Conrad!

880
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:27,690
Give him all you got!

881
01:04:28,780 --> 01:04:29,780
Yeah!

882
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:43,500
Let's go, Bell!

883
01:04:43,580 --> 01:04:44,420
I'm ready!

884
01:04:45,750 --> 01:04:46,960
Going all out!

885
01:04:56,090 --> 01:04:57,720
Spirit Assimilation…

886
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:58,850
Spirit Dive!

887
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,270
All units! Get into your positions!

888
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:08,570
Just as planned, we succeeded
in splitting the enemy force!

889
01:05:09,980 --> 01:05:12,440
Now each of you will fight to the end

890
01:05:12,530 --> 01:05:15,360
with the pride of a Magic Knights Squad!

891
01:05:15,990 --> 01:05:18,950
If you don't,
then you have me to answer to!

892
01:05:19,580 --> 01:05:23,250
And not one of you
is allowed to die either.

893
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:26,790
If you slack off, or if you die,

894
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:28,960
then I will burn you to death myself!

895
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,550
Listen well, all of you.

896
01:05:32,630 --> 01:05:34,220
If you don't want to die,

897
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:36,510
then fight on, even if it kills you!

898
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:39,350
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

899
01:05:41,390 --> 01:05:45,270
No tricks to speak of
for fighting against me?

900
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:49,520
Just my luck to have
such a boring fool as my enemy.

901
01:05:49,610 --> 01:05:51,320
"Tricks"?

902
01:05:52,110 --> 01:05:54,530
Why would I need tricks to face you?

903
01:05:55,110 --> 01:05:56,570
Princia Funnybunny.

904
01:05:57,110 --> 01:06:01,030
A mighty warrior among the Wizard Kings,
whose combat strength

905
01:06:01,120 --> 01:06:03,120
is worth a thousand soldiers!

906
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:07,000
The records say that you've never lost

907
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:09,880
in any combat where you were involved.

908
01:06:10,460 --> 01:06:12,590
Why would I rely on some silly tricks

909
01:06:12,670 --> 01:06:15,300
when facing such a foe!

910
01:06:16,090 --> 01:06:18,590
Very well, I take back my words.

911
01:06:19,640 --> 01:06:22,560
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

912
01:06:23,890 --> 01:06:26,230
If you want me to play with you,

913
01:06:26,310 --> 01:06:28,270
then show me your strength first.

914
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:36,950
A test of strength?
I accept the challenge.

915
01:06:37,740 --> 01:06:41,740
But I hope you don't hold back on me!

916
01:06:54,590 --> 01:06:55,670
Next…

917
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,550
Where are you aiming?

918
01:07:03,810 --> 01:07:07,520
Did you actually think
you managed to lure me in?

919
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:10,020
Just the opposite, silly you!

920
01:07:10,100 --> 01:07:13,360
I'm the one who lured you here.

921
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:15,070
The truth is,

922
01:07:15,150 --> 01:07:17,940
we can use the magical power

923
01:07:18,030 --> 01:07:21,320
that's fueling this flying fortress
as our own!

924
01:07:21,910 --> 01:07:23,780
So, as long as I'm in here,

925
01:07:23,870 --> 01:07:27,620
I can replenish my magic endlessly!

926
01:07:31,870 --> 01:07:34,290
And you think you've won just for that?

927
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,710
Against us?

928
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,170
"Us"?

929
01:07:38,210 --> 01:07:40,970
Hey, hey, Pretty Boy.

930
01:07:41,050 --> 01:07:43,180
Didn't anyone teach you

931
01:07:43,260 --> 01:07:46,220
that a damsel in distress
should be rescued gently?

932
01:07:47,310 --> 01:07:49,980
I'm a Virgo, you know!

933
01:07:51,520 --> 01:07:53,230
The earlier attack…

934
01:07:54,060 --> 01:07:55,900
This is what he was aiming for.

935
01:07:57,320 --> 01:07:58,440
I'll remember that.

936
01:07:59,280 --> 01:08:00,650
Are you ready to go?

937
01:08:00,740 --> 01:08:03,240
Can't have my subordinates taking risks

938
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:06,910
without me, the captain,
surpassing my limits first, can I?

939
01:08:06,990 --> 01:08:08,450
Right, you guys?

940
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
You don't need to tell me.

941
01:08:13,750 --> 01:08:17,420
We will show you the might
of the Magic Knights Squads, here and now!

942
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,420
Yuno! We will back you up!

943
01:08:21,260 --> 01:08:23,300
You focus on attacking!

944
01:08:32,890 --> 01:08:34,150
Uh-huh?

945
01:08:34,690 --> 01:08:37,650
Don't make me yawn,
you nearly dead idiots.

946
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:42,570
These guys here have been kept alive

947
01:08:42,650 --> 01:08:46,700
so that we could suck their magical power
to fuel the fortress.

948
01:08:46,780 --> 01:08:52,040
They have little magical power left.

949
01:08:52,540 --> 01:08:53,540
And?

950
01:08:53,620 --> 01:08:56,290
Is your grit going to help
regain your magical power?

951
01:08:57,130 --> 01:08:59,550
Huh? Surpassing limits?

952
01:08:59,630 --> 01:09:02,550
You can't get strong that quickly!

953
01:09:05,300 --> 01:09:08,600
You called yourself Wizard King
when you didn't even know that?

954
01:09:09,510 --> 01:09:10,560
Unbelievable.

955
01:09:12,140 --> 01:09:15,060
Bring it on, bastards!

956
01:09:15,140 --> 01:09:19,110
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

957
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,170
Here it is! Grey!

958
01:09:45,930 --> 01:09:48,090
Okay!

959
01:09:48,180 --> 01:09:50,640
Magic Conversion!

960
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,450
Thank you…

961
01:10:10,530 --> 01:10:13,160
I can't use strong magic,

962
01:10:13,240 --> 01:10:15,250
but I can manage this much
without my grimoire…

963
01:10:15,330 --> 01:10:17,460
Looks like we can handle this.

964
01:10:18,080 --> 01:10:18,920
Right.

965
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:22,380
The revived Wizard Kings
and the magic to destroy this kingdom…

966
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,380
If Asta can touch the Imperial Sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

967
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:26,880
they can all be neutralized.

968
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:30,550
All we have to do is to stop them
until he can do that!

969
01:10:32,470 --> 01:10:33,810
How pitiful…

970
01:10:35,310 --> 01:10:37,020
I'm saying this for your sake.

971
01:10:37,100 --> 01:10:38,310
Surrender now.

972
01:10:38,390 --> 01:10:43,190
And, please, leave
and go somewhere out of our sight.

973
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:46,150
That's mighty nice of you.

974
01:10:46,740 --> 01:10:50,740
Isn't it your purpose to kill us off?

975
01:10:50,820 --> 01:10:57,410
If you were nobles and royals
who only think of benefitting themselves,

976
01:10:57,500 --> 01:10:59,250
then I'd have no mercy for you.

977
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:04,420
But your hearts aren't impure like theirs.

978
01:11:04,960 --> 01:11:05,880
Retreat now!

979
01:11:06,460 --> 01:11:08,930
If you promise not to get in our way,

980
01:11:09,010 --> 01:11:10,680
I will let you go.

981
01:11:12,180 --> 01:11:13,680
That means,

982
01:11:13,760 --> 01:11:16,850
"Just shut up and watch
as this country breaks apart," right?

983
01:11:17,600 --> 01:11:18,430
In that case…

984
01:11:19,140 --> 01:11:21,940
We would not retreat even if it kills us!

985
01:11:25,020 --> 01:11:27,780
Being foolish is… pitiful.

986
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,410
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Church.

987
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:46,590
And here you thought you could beat me
with this level of magical power.

988
01:11:47,210 --> 01:11:48,840
My mana zone allows me

989
01:11:48,920 --> 01:11:52,590
to lower the temperature
of a space to below freezing!

990
01:11:55,300 --> 01:12:00,310
Amateurs won't be able
to even breathe in this space!

991
01:12:04,810 --> 01:12:06,730
Move…

992
01:12:06,820 --> 01:12:08,360
I don't understand.

993
01:12:08,440 --> 01:12:11,740
You were also oppressed by this world.

994
01:12:11,820 --> 01:12:14,740
Why do you reject our ideas?!

995
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,490
Don't underestimate us…

996
01:12:17,330 --> 01:12:20,750
Everyone's giving their all to survive.

997
01:12:20,830 --> 01:12:23,710
Even if it's hard, they're not giving up!

998
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:29,260
You have no right to take away
the lives of people like that!

999
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:32,680
Indeed.

1000
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,390
No one has the right to do so.

1001
01:12:37,010 --> 01:12:39,100
And that's why I must do what I must.

1002
01:12:39,810 --> 01:12:42,690
In order to create a world
where those without magic

1003
01:12:42,770 --> 01:12:45,560
and outsiders can smile as they live!

1004
01:12:45,650 --> 01:12:47,770
But that doesn't justify--

1005
01:12:49,280 --> 01:12:52,110
Being weak is also pitiful.

1006
01:12:56,780 --> 01:12:58,990
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1007
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:08,630
It's useless. You will never reach me.

1008
01:13:13,470 --> 01:13:14,880
Go to sleep.

1009
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:16,890
I refuse.

1010
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,890
I just need to burn everything down.

1011
01:13:21,850 --> 01:13:23,100
Mana Zone…

1012
01:13:23,180 --> 01:13:24,190
Full Release!

1013
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,150
Flame Magic…

1014
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:29,440
Calidos Brachium…

1015
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,110
Purgatory!

1016
01:13:38,620 --> 01:13:39,660
Now!

1017
01:13:40,870 --> 01:13:42,790
Time to play!

1018
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:57,800
Your name was Mereoleona, was it?

1019
01:13:58,510 --> 01:14:01,140
You made me use my fist.

1020
01:14:01,640 --> 01:14:05,060
You are very interesting.

1021
01:14:19,280 --> 01:14:22,330
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone.

1022
01:14:23,160 --> 01:14:25,450
Very good, Mereoleona.

1023
01:14:25,540 --> 01:14:27,580
I will admit it.

1024
01:14:27,670 --> 01:14:29,080
You are strong!

1025
01:14:29,710 --> 01:14:33,380
But not as strong as me!

1026
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,380
What are we going to do, Yuno?

1027
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:40,970
At this rate,
Yami and the others won't last.

1028
01:14:41,050 --> 01:14:41,930
I know!

1029
01:14:50,350 --> 01:14:51,650
Captain Nozel!

1030
01:14:55,110 --> 01:14:57,860
Yuno, don't try to do something you can't.

1031
01:14:58,360 --> 01:14:59,780
You are strong.

1032
01:15:00,490 --> 01:15:03,030
Try and face
what you are capable of right now.

1033
01:15:04,990 --> 01:15:07,370
Don't worry about us.

1034
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,550
Please buy me a little more time!

1035
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:24,810
I'll finish him with the next blow!

1036
01:15:31,980 --> 01:15:34,730
Hey, hey, beardy macho man!

1037
01:15:34,820 --> 01:15:37,150
Did you run out of energy at the start?

1038
01:15:39,610 --> 01:15:41,450
Your taste in nicknames is horrible!

1039
01:15:43,870 --> 01:15:45,370
No matter how you look at it,

1040
01:15:45,450 --> 01:15:49,040
I'm obviously more of
a "cute and girly" kind of macho!

1041
01:16:22,030 --> 01:16:23,490
Don't you know any other moves?

1042
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:32,250
This guy…

1043
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:36,250
He's pouring all his magical power
into this blow!

1044
01:16:45,430 --> 01:16:47,300
You powered your way through after all.

1045
01:16:48,180 --> 01:16:50,640
A rather unrefined move, Pretty Boy!

1046
01:17:01,240 --> 01:17:04,910
Aren't you interesting?!

1047
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:25,260
So you've been protecting
this land all these years…

1048
01:17:28,050 --> 01:17:29,560
Lemiel.

1049
01:17:29,640 --> 01:17:31,970
The world you envisioned,

1050
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:35,390
I will make it come true.

1051
01:17:37,560 --> 01:17:40,730
Conrad!

1052
01:17:41,820 --> 01:17:45,280
So you've arrived, Asta!

1053
01:17:47,700 --> 01:17:50,370
You were a little too late, Asta.

1054
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:54,120
This is…

1055
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:55,120
Stop!

1056
01:17:55,210 --> 01:17:56,620
…the end.

1057
01:18:05,050 --> 01:18:09,470
And a new beginning for this world!

1058
01:18:35,660 --> 01:18:37,410
Give up, Asta.

1059
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:41,170
I drove the magic of the Imperial Sword
into the singular point.

1060
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:46,010
No one can stop
the destruction of this kingdom!

1061
01:18:51,640 --> 01:18:53,010
Not yet!

1062
01:18:54,260 --> 01:18:57,180
I'll pull that sword out
and kick your butt!

1063
01:18:57,730 --> 01:18:59,560
I'm really persistent.

1064
01:18:59,650 --> 01:19:02,400
If I decide to do something,
I'll do it even if it kills me!

1065
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,690
It's you who should give up!

1066
01:19:05,400 --> 01:19:09,030
Then you understand me, Asta.

1067
01:19:13,120 --> 01:19:16,450
-Never giving up is my magic!
-Never giving up is my magic!

1068
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:26,960
If someone like you had been around me,

1069
01:19:27,050 --> 01:19:30,220
then my loneliness
may not have been as bad,

1070
01:19:31,930 --> 01:19:33,970
Mereoleona.

1071
01:19:40,770 --> 01:19:41,600
Hey.

1072
01:19:46,110 --> 01:19:47,360
The battle…

1073
01:19:49,950 --> 01:19:51,950
is not over yet!

1074
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,580
Impossible!

1075
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,870
Her power increased?!

1076
01:19:59,790 --> 01:20:00,620
You!

1077
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:02,620
How can you still move?

1078
01:20:05,420 --> 01:20:06,550
Ugh, Big-sis-leon.

1079
01:20:06,630 --> 01:20:08,210
What's up! Lady Mereoleona!

1080
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:10,380
Good morning, big sister!

1081
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:12,680
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1082
01:20:14,050 --> 01:20:14,930
Big sister!

1083
01:20:19,980 --> 01:20:21,190
It's my grit!

1084
01:20:22,810 --> 01:20:24,150
Also,

1085
01:20:24,230 --> 01:20:26,820
if I kick the bucket in a place like this,

1086
01:20:27,610 --> 01:20:31,570
they'll surely laugh at me!

1087
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:51,220
And one more thing!

1088
01:20:52,380 --> 01:20:54,510
Unless I stay the strongest,

1089
01:20:55,640 --> 01:21:00,310
I won't be able to call
a certain someone "my rival"!

1090
01:21:02,890 --> 01:21:06,270
Drawing strength from your comrades…

1091
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:10,070
That sure is a trick I'll never learn.

1092
01:21:10,650 --> 01:21:11,650
However…

1093
01:21:14,950 --> 01:21:16,820
Well done, Mereoleona.

1094
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:20,330
To think that I'd lose in a fist fight.

1095
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:22,660
You just might be

1096
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:27,130
strong enough to fight me
when I go all out!

1097
01:21:28,630 --> 01:21:32,300
Oh man, you're really strong.

1098
01:21:32,380 --> 01:21:34,840
You even made me use my trump card.

1099
01:21:35,590 --> 01:21:38,350
Had I met you when I was the Wizard King,

1100
01:21:38,430 --> 01:21:41,100
I might have made you my advisers.

1101
01:21:41,180 --> 01:21:42,350
Maybe!

1102
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:48,190
You are wrong!

1103
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,110
Don't give me that crap.

1104
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:57,110
No one knows
what's right and what's wrong!

1105
01:21:57,820 --> 01:21:59,490
We're the same as you!

1106
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:05,370
Conrad and I, we fight for our beliefs!

1107
01:22:08,330 --> 01:22:09,750
I get that!

1108
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:12,960
In a fight like this,
there's no right or wrong!

1109
01:22:14,760 --> 01:22:16,630
But to protect what matters to us…

1110
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:20,640
we both plant our feet and fight!

1111
01:22:21,220 --> 01:22:22,220
Combo Spell…

1112
01:22:22,720 --> 01:22:24,180
Dimension Slash!

1113
01:22:24,730 --> 01:22:25,980
Scorching Light!

1114
01:22:40,120 --> 01:22:41,160
I won't lose…

1115
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:45,040
I won't lose to something like this!

1116
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:46,790
That's too bad!

1117
01:22:46,870 --> 01:22:49,370
Asta, I'm borrowing your skill!

1118
01:22:50,380 --> 01:22:54,050
I hate losing more than anything too!

1119
01:23:10,810 --> 01:23:12,560
Whatever.

1120
01:23:13,150 --> 01:23:16,320
I don't care about preserving
magical powers for the fortress anymore.

1121
01:23:17,190 --> 01:23:23,080
I'll use all my power to crush you all!

1122
01:23:30,870 --> 01:23:32,670
Reconsider, Asta.

1123
01:23:34,040 --> 01:23:38,090
This crazy world is not worth protecting.

1124
01:23:38,920 --> 01:23:42,840
Let's build a new world together!

1125
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:50,020
I don't care about your new world!

1126
01:23:50,690 --> 01:23:53,610
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1127
01:23:54,270 --> 01:23:55,110
Nonsense.

1128
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:59,320
Becoming a Wizard King in this world
will change nothing.

1129
01:24:01,070 --> 01:24:02,200
That's right.

1130
01:24:02,280 --> 01:24:03,490
Nothing…

1131
01:24:42,740 --> 01:24:45,320
All routes are shut down.

1132
01:24:46,660 --> 01:24:49,160
Your sword will never reach me.

1133
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:51,410
No matter how you struggle,

1134
01:24:51,500 --> 01:24:53,750
this is your limit.

1135
01:24:55,500 --> 01:24:57,670
I'll say it one last time.

1136
01:24:58,420 --> 01:25:00,090
Come with us, Asta.

1137
01:25:02,090 --> 01:25:04,630
You can be my successor.

1138
01:25:05,390 --> 01:25:07,720
Become the Wizard King in the new world.

1139
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:16,690
Not in a million years!

1140
01:25:16,770 --> 01:25:19,940
Someone can't turn you
into the Wizard King.

1141
01:25:20,030 --> 01:25:22,570
You become one on your own merits!

1142
01:25:22,650 --> 01:25:25,530
And there is a way!

1143
01:25:27,240 --> 01:25:28,620
If there isn't,

1144
01:25:30,290 --> 01:25:31,910
I'll make one!

1145
01:25:36,460 --> 01:25:41,300
I've always been told
to surpass my limits!

1146
01:25:48,140 --> 01:25:50,970
That was a good hit.

1147
01:25:51,770 --> 01:25:53,810
So I didn't parry and took it.

1148
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:57,230
Along with your ambition.

1149
01:25:59,310 --> 01:26:01,820
But playtime is over, Asta.

1150
01:26:02,480 --> 01:26:04,990
If we can't walk the same path together,

1151
01:26:05,070 --> 01:26:07,570
then there is no point
in holding back anymore.

1152
01:26:07,660 --> 01:26:09,030
Asta.

1153
01:26:09,120 --> 01:26:15,080
The biggest reason I asked you to join us
is not because of your power.

1154
01:26:15,750 --> 01:26:18,920
Nor is it because
you were in the same boat as me.

1155
01:26:19,920 --> 01:26:22,960
I wanted you,
who has the same ambition as me,

1156
01:26:23,050 --> 01:26:25,010
to be rewarded!

1157
01:26:26,260 --> 01:26:29,800
But I was not able
to open your eyes to the truth.

1158
01:26:31,350 --> 01:26:32,600
How regrettable…

1159
01:27:13,970 --> 01:27:15,890
I'm neutralizing him with my Anti-Magic,

1160
01:27:16,730 --> 01:27:17,890
but I can't keep up!

1161
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:23,730
Now!

1162
01:27:27,360 --> 01:27:28,780
I've been waiting

1163
01:27:29,360 --> 01:27:32,780
for the moment you'd take it easy
and drop your guard!

1164
01:27:32,870 --> 01:27:35,290
Exploding Fireball!

1165
01:27:36,500 --> 01:27:40,000
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1166
01:27:42,790 --> 01:27:44,170
Full Reflection!

1167
01:27:51,260 --> 01:27:53,350
Ice Wedge Magic…

1168
01:27:53,890 --> 01:27:55,890
World End Martyr!

1169
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:04,810
This is what…

1170
01:28:05,650 --> 01:28:08,110
"taking it easy" means!

1171
01:28:11,660 --> 01:28:14,950
You learn something new every day,
don't you, young one?

1172
01:28:16,330 --> 01:28:17,950
Thanks for nothing, old fart!

1173
01:28:18,950 --> 01:28:20,710
Hurry up, Asta!

1174
01:28:20,790 --> 01:28:23,580
Our magic won't last much longer!

1175
01:28:24,790 --> 01:28:26,590
Black Hurricane!

1176
01:28:28,920 --> 01:28:32,340
It's admirable how you can
keep your spirits up,

1177
01:28:32,430 --> 01:28:34,590
but your movements are getting slow!

1178
01:28:38,220 --> 01:28:40,350
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1179
01:28:46,940 --> 01:28:49,730
No matter how much you struggle,

1180
01:28:50,360 --> 01:28:52,740
this gap between us will never be filled!

1181
01:28:53,950 --> 01:28:56,370
This is the power of the Wizard King!

1182
01:29:03,120 --> 01:29:04,500
I will never…

1183
01:29:05,130 --> 01:29:09,800
acknowledge a guy like you
as the Wizard King!

1184
01:29:10,960 --> 01:29:14,380
Crap, if I let my guard down,
my Black form will become undone.

1185
01:29:14,880 --> 01:29:18,010
I need to land a hit
with everything I've got left!

1186
01:29:18,100 --> 01:29:21,350
Stop seeing your dreams
in the Wizard King!

1187
01:29:21,430 --> 01:29:24,020
No one, not even the first Wizard King,

1188
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:28,020
has been able to bring
revolution to this kingdom.

1189
01:29:28,110 --> 01:29:30,820
In fact, far from changing the nation,

1190
01:29:30,900 --> 01:29:34,280
Julius ended up getting beaten
by the Elves in the earlier war,

1191
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:38,280
and the Clover Kingdom
almost faced its doom.

1192
01:29:38,370 --> 01:29:41,410
They can't protect anything.
They can't change anything.

1193
01:29:41,490 --> 01:29:44,910
Wizard Kings are utterly useless!

1194
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:47,420
That's not true…

1195
01:29:50,170 --> 01:29:55,300
The current Wizard King protected
all the citizens in exchange for his life!

1196
01:29:55,840 --> 01:29:57,550
Same with the first Wizard King!

1197
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,930
He protected everyone
at the expense of his life,

1198
01:30:01,010 --> 01:30:03,180
and even after that,
for hundreds of years,

1199
01:30:03,770 --> 01:30:06,060
he kept on sleeping

1200
01:30:06,940 --> 01:30:11,230
so he could help us and this country!

1201
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:21,450
Clover leaves each represent
faith, hope, and love.

1202
01:30:22,410 --> 01:30:25,120
Within the fourth leaf dwells good luck.

1203
01:30:26,290 --> 01:30:29,540
In the fifth leaf resides the devil.

1204
01:30:33,050 --> 01:30:35,260
Is he about to die again?

1205
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,880
Man, what a piece of work.

1206
01:30:37,970 --> 01:30:42,100
I guess I'll get the payment
in a lump sum later.

1207
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:47,310
You became the Wizard King

1208
01:30:47,390 --> 01:30:51,360
because a lot of people acknowledged you,
didn't you?

1209
01:30:52,190 --> 01:30:55,490
Betraying those people
makes you unfit to be one!

1210
01:30:56,570 --> 01:30:58,200
I won't acknowledge you!

1211
01:31:00,160 --> 01:31:04,290
Wizard Kings inspire people!

1212
01:31:04,950 --> 01:31:08,250
They can be someone's hopes and dreams!

1213
01:31:08,330 --> 01:31:10,380
They are not useless at all!

1214
01:31:12,840 --> 01:31:16,760
You don't understand
the true nature of this country yet.

1215
01:31:17,420 --> 01:31:20,840
The discrimination and prejudice
rampant in this country

1216
01:31:20,930 --> 01:31:24,510
have crushed people's dreams
and hopes again and again!

1217
01:31:24,600 --> 01:31:28,890
Unless we make a fundamental change,
this country will not change!

1218
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:31,940
That's not for you to decide!

1219
01:31:32,860 --> 01:31:33,730
Right now,

1220
01:31:33,820 --> 01:31:36,820
regardless of their social status,
everyone from peasants to royals

1221
01:31:36,900 --> 01:31:40,570
is working hard together
to make this a better country!

1222
01:31:41,110 --> 01:31:42,910
So don't get in our way!

1223
01:31:42,990 --> 01:31:46,160
A country cannot change
with such simple measures!

1224
01:31:46,240 --> 01:31:48,750
Don't get in my way!

1225
01:31:53,750 --> 01:31:56,800
What the hell?
I'm not sure what's going on,

1226
01:31:56,880 --> 01:32:00,220
but I feel like
I finally got to talk to the real you.

1227
01:32:01,380 --> 01:32:02,550
Shut up.

1228
01:32:03,260 --> 01:32:08,480
I'm no longer interested in listening to
pipe dreams from a kid who knows nothing!

1229
01:32:13,060 --> 01:32:16,360
Crap! My Black form is coming undone!

1230
01:32:16,440 --> 01:32:19,860
True, there was a time
when I trusted the country and its people

1231
01:32:19,940 --> 01:32:25,120
and tried to bring changes
to the Clover Kingdom as the Wizard King.

1232
01:32:25,200 --> 01:32:27,870
But people betray you.

1233
01:32:27,950 --> 01:32:30,370
You must know what that's like.

1234
01:32:30,960 --> 01:32:34,500
Just because a small portion
of your community changed,

1235
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,760
do you seriously think
that a whole country will change?

1236
01:32:39,590 --> 01:32:41,090
It's not that they change.

1237
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:43,760
It's that we bring change together!

1238
01:32:43,840 --> 01:32:45,510
The world you're trying to create

1239
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:50,100
is an egotistical world
where you're the only one who's laughing!

1240
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:54,020
I want to laugh with everyone.
I want to become happy with everyone!

1241
01:32:54,900 --> 01:32:59,150
I will change this country with everyone!

1242
01:32:59,230 --> 01:33:01,490
A country where everyone who lives there

1243
01:33:01,570 --> 01:33:04,740
respects each other
and laughs with one another!

1244
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:08,740
That's what I'm going to create!

1245
01:33:19,750 --> 01:33:21,920
My magic is back!

1246
01:33:25,260 --> 01:33:26,640
Noelle!

1247
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,560
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

1248
01:33:34,640 --> 01:33:36,310
Yeah!

1249
01:33:36,400 --> 01:33:37,730
What a futile struggle.

1250
01:33:38,230 --> 01:33:41,900
You defying us only pushes us
away from an ideal world!

1251
01:33:42,400 --> 01:33:44,110
Why can't you see that?!

1252
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,320
An ideal world

1253
01:33:48,410 --> 01:33:50,910
isn't something that's forced upon you.

1254
01:33:51,410 --> 01:33:53,410
It's something you earn yourself!

1255
01:33:54,410 --> 01:33:56,170
Noelle! Look at me!

1256
01:33:58,420 --> 01:33:59,590
Mirror Magic…

1257
01:34:00,300 --> 01:34:01,920
Mirror Brigade!

1258
01:34:04,800 --> 01:34:07,590
I used to resent this world as well.

1259
01:34:08,180 --> 01:34:10,760
I couldn't learn to control
my magical powers

1260
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:12,770
and was abandoned by my family.

1261
01:34:12,850 --> 01:34:15,980
I thought I was alone in the world.

1262
01:34:17,270 --> 01:34:19,900
But I now have friends

1263
01:34:20,820 --> 01:34:23,530
who make me feel I belong!

1264
01:34:24,070 --> 01:34:25,950
They accept me with my shortcomings,

1265
01:34:27,200 --> 01:34:31,740
and they stay right beside me
as we move forward!

1266
01:34:32,830 --> 01:34:34,370
Combo Spell…

1267
01:34:35,200 --> 01:34:36,870
Mirror Meteo…

1268
01:34:40,170 --> 01:34:41,000
Dragon!

1269
01:34:44,590 --> 01:34:46,760
Magic Conversion!

1270
01:34:46,840 --> 01:34:48,840
Ice to Water!

1271
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:51,640
Right here, right now…

1272
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:54,640
Fate Manipulation…

1273
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:56,020
Absolute Evasion!

1274
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:58,810
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

1275
01:34:59,730 --> 01:35:02,400
I will surpass my limits!

1276
01:35:06,240 --> 01:35:07,530
Jeez.

1277
01:35:07,610 --> 01:35:09,160
Just go already!

1278
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:11,410
Leave it to me!

1279
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,660
The world can be changed.

1280
01:35:18,290 --> 01:35:20,960
Fate can be manipulated!

1281
01:35:22,290 --> 01:35:25,130
I will not let you destroy

1282
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:31,930
even the possibility of it!

1283
01:35:48,400 --> 01:35:50,150
How about that?

1284
01:35:50,240 --> 01:35:53,910
If that's not enough for you,
then I can do this all day.

1285
01:35:55,490 --> 01:35:56,330
But…

1286
01:36:00,000 --> 01:36:02,790
Start over with us, together.

1287
01:36:04,210 --> 01:36:05,710
I don't mean to boast,

1288
01:36:06,300 --> 01:36:09,050
but I can't do anything
without everyone's help!

1289
01:36:09,800 --> 01:36:12,260
I nearly died many times,

1290
01:36:12,340 --> 01:36:15,850
but I was able to come this far
with their help!

1291
01:36:15,930 --> 01:36:17,100
Shut up!

1292
01:36:21,100 --> 01:36:24,150
I want to create a world where everyone
can laugh together in a way

1293
01:36:24,230 --> 01:36:26,730
that everyone can accept.

1294
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:31,570
If you have to kill
a lot of people to create it,

1295
01:36:32,070 --> 01:36:34,820
no one will accept that!

1296
01:37:05,520 --> 01:37:07,770
You… What is your name?

1297
01:37:07,860 --> 01:37:10,280
Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1298
01:37:10,360 --> 01:37:12,780
From the royal house of Silva…

1299
01:37:13,740 --> 01:37:14,570
I see.

1300
01:37:15,780 --> 01:37:17,450
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1301
01:37:18,450 --> 01:37:22,210
You're a royal, and yet
you can empathize with the weak.

1302
01:37:23,370 --> 01:37:26,790
If a person like you exists,
then surely this world…

1303
01:37:29,960 --> 01:37:31,800
Hey, hey, hey…

1304
01:37:32,970 --> 01:37:35,550
Are you serious, Conrad?

1305
01:37:37,680 --> 01:37:40,060
I can still fight!

1306
01:37:41,430 --> 01:37:42,600
Me too.

1307
01:37:43,940 --> 01:37:47,480
But it looks like
it's my turn to go to sleep.

1308
01:37:48,820 --> 01:37:50,940
It was a lot of fun.

1309
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:56,740
I did it…

1310
01:37:57,370 --> 01:37:58,280
I did it!

1311
01:37:58,870 --> 01:37:59,700
Everyone!

1312
01:38:01,290 --> 01:38:03,160
Not… yet…

1313
01:38:05,370 --> 01:38:06,960
Not yet…

1314
01:38:09,790 --> 01:38:15,220
It's a forbidden spell
that's activated in exchange for my life.

1315
01:38:16,720 --> 01:38:18,760
Doom's Gate.

1316
01:38:27,850 --> 01:38:30,650
I will not give up.

1317
01:38:30,730 --> 01:38:32,730
I will not give up, Asta.

1318
01:38:48,120 --> 01:38:51,630
I will… not give up either.

1319
01:38:52,920 --> 01:38:55,630
I'm going to be the Wizard King.

1320
01:38:56,670 --> 01:39:00,890
In order to be the Wizard King…

1321
01:39:02,310 --> 01:39:03,640
I am!

1322
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,480
Right here!

1323
01:39:08,730 --> 01:39:10,150
Asta!

1324
01:39:16,240 --> 01:39:18,030
Asta, take this.

1325
01:39:20,490 --> 01:39:21,450
The Wizard King!

1326
01:39:22,240 --> 01:39:24,410
You won't need an explanation.

1327
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:26,910
That sword will show you.

1328
01:39:27,710 --> 01:39:29,250
The future of this nation…

1329
01:39:29,330 --> 01:39:30,170
The space…

1330
01:39:31,080 --> 01:39:32,250
…is in your hands.

1331
01:39:37,510 --> 01:39:38,340
I feel it.

1332
01:39:39,220 --> 01:39:41,890
This is everyone's power!

1333
01:39:42,930 --> 01:39:44,350
Their hopes and dreams!

1334
01:39:48,940 --> 01:39:49,980
I feel everyone…

1335
01:39:51,020 --> 01:39:52,360
everyone is there!

1336
01:39:54,520 --> 01:39:56,940
Master Nacht, please stop it!

1337
01:39:57,690 --> 01:40:02,450
You've been working non-stop
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom!

1338
01:40:03,160 --> 01:40:07,410
If you give away your magical power
on top of that, you'll pass out!

1339
01:40:07,500 --> 01:40:09,710
I don't mind passing out

1340
01:40:11,210 --> 01:40:15,130
if that means someone
who's doing the right thing gets rewarded.

1341
01:40:18,210 --> 01:40:19,170
Right here…

1342
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:20,720
Right now…

1343
01:40:22,050 --> 01:40:23,050
Let's all…

1344
01:40:26,310 --> 01:40:29,310
surpass our limits.

1345
01:40:33,850 --> 01:40:34,980
The Imperial Sword?

1346
01:40:35,770 --> 01:40:37,780
What is going on?

1347
01:40:41,320 --> 01:40:43,240
Go, Asta!

1348
01:41:00,840 --> 01:41:03,340
With this…

1349
01:41:13,810 --> 01:41:18,020
You bastard, how badly
do you want to destroy this country?!

1350
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:20,070
Oh, you have no idea!

1351
01:41:20,150 --> 01:41:21,530
It needs to be destroyed!

1352
01:41:22,320 --> 01:41:24,360
This nation is rotten to its core.

1353
01:41:24,860 --> 01:41:28,410
The very foundation of it
needs to be destroyed.

1354
01:41:28,490 --> 01:41:33,290
I have to save everyone. I must!

1355
01:41:33,370 --> 01:41:38,590
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?!

1356
01:41:38,670 --> 01:41:42,380
All those who are unreasonably oppressed!

1357
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:44,760
For their sake, I…

1358
01:41:56,730 --> 01:41:57,810
I will…

1359
01:41:59,190 --> 01:42:00,650
I will…

1360
01:42:04,780 --> 01:42:07,320
Even if you're a peasant
or don't have magical power,

1361
01:42:07,410 --> 01:42:09,830
you can be stronger
than anyone else in the world.

1362
01:42:10,660 --> 01:42:13,330
You can be everyone's hope!

1363
01:42:13,910 --> 01:42:16,750
And to prove it…

1364
01:42:20,840 --> 01:42:21,920
I am going to be

1365
01:42:22,460 --> 01:42:24,090
the Wizard King!

1366
01:42:50,870 --> 01:42:54,200
Did I… lose?

1367
01:42:56,080 --> 01:42:58,040
Then why…

1368
01:42:58,120 --> 01:43:01,340
why do I feel so at ease?

1369
01:43:07,130 --> 01:43:09,260
Now I see it.

1370
01:43:10,430 --> 01:43:13,510
Asta. Become the Wizard King.

1371
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:20,150
Share that warm world of yours
with every citizen in this nation.

1372
01:43:21,150 --> 01:43:24,150
Never giving up is your magic.

1373
01:43:24,650 --> 01:43:25,820
I know you can…

1374
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,570
You all…

1375
01:43:42,250 --> 01:43:44,090
I see.

1376
01:44:06,900 --> 01:44:08,490
Cheerful and honest,

1377
01:44:09,070 --> 01:44:12,110
he knew how to empathize with the peasant.

1378
01:44:12,780 --> 01:44:17,540
Conrad used to be
a strong, kind man like Asta.

1379
01:44:18,700 --> 01:44:21,330
But he was framed by the royalists,

1380
01:44:21,420 --> 01:44:24,630
and ever since his squad
and his wife were slaughtered,

1381
01:44:25,250 --> 01:44:26,840
he changed.

1382
01:44:29,260 --> 01:44:30,300
Asta.

1383
01:44:30,380 --> 01:44:32,130
Thank you for stopping him.

1384
01:44:33,680 --> 01:44:38,180
Why was I able to use
the Imperial Sword at the end?

1385
01:44:38,270 --> 01:44:39,140
What do you mean?

1386
01:44:39,230 --> 01:44:42,650
When I hit the Imperial Sword
with my Demon-Slayer Sword,

1387
01:44:42,730 --> 01:44:45,360
the magic of the Imperial Sword
must've been neutralized.

1388
01:44:46,230 --> 01:44:47,440
So I was wondering…

1389
01:44:49,320 --> 01:44:51,320
Well, that's because…

1390
01:44:55,490 --> 01:44:57,830
Generations of Wizard Kings…

1391
01:45:00,580 --> 01:45:04,830
…generations of Wizard Kings
lent you their miraculous power.

1392
01:45:04,920 --> 01:45:08,170
Wow, that sounds so cool!

1393
01:45:08,250 --> 01:45:10,590
Silly, he's teasing you.

1394
01:45:10,670 --> 01:45:11,970
That's not true!

1395
01:45:12,050 --> 01:45:14,390
Generations of Wizard Kings.

1396
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:18,810
The clovers responsible for the future
of this kingdom are growing up nicely.

1397
01:45:18,890 --> 01:45:21,730
-You making fun of Prince Lemiel?
-How about it, Asta?

1398
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,400
The Wizard King is incredible, right?

1399
01:45:24,480 --> 01:45:25,650
I knew that, sir!

1400
01:45:25,730 --> 01:45:28,730
And one day,
I'll be that incredible myself.

1401
01:45:29,320 --> 01:45:30,860
I will become the Wizard King!

1402
01:49:30,310 --> 01:49:32,100
Don't you be slacking here.

1403
01:49:32,180 --> 01:49:34,480
I worked my butt off, you know?!

1404
01:49:38,440 --> 01:49:40,280
The place was a total shambles,

1405
01:49:40,360 --> 01:49:43,360
but it looks like things might be
restored sooner than I thought.

1406
01:49:43,450 --> 01:49:44,490
Yeah.

1407
01:49:49,280 --> 01:49:52,000
Conrad was the Wizard King, too, huh?

1408
01:49:53,750 --> 01:49:54,580
Ouch!

1409
01:49:55,750 --> 01:49:56,580
Not a chance.

1410
01:49:58,880 --> 01:49:59,710
You're right!

1411
01:50:01,380 --> 01:50:03,510
I'm going to be the Wizard King, anyway.

1412
01:50:03,590 --> 01:50:04,930
No, I will!

1413
01:50:05,010 --> 01:50:06,510
I'm going to be the Wizard King!

1414
01:50:07,090 --> 01:50:09,180
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1415
01:50:09,260 --> 01:50:10,890
Wanna go?

1416
01:50:10,970 --> 01:50:12,980
The Triumph was canceled,

1417
01:50:13,060 --> 01:50:16,020
but you and me gotta settle this match!

1418
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:18,520
Not a chance.

1419
01:50:26,110 --> 01:50:28,820
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
