1
00:01:28,247 --> 00:01:29,165
Why?

2
00:01:29,707 --> 00:01:32,335
Why do you get in my way, Julius?!

3
00:01:32,418 --> 00:01:36,839
Because what you're trying to do is wrong, Conrad.

4
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:40,259
You must give up.

5
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:42,928
You don't have enough magic left in you to resist--

6
00:01:43,012 --> 00:01:44,555
The one who's wrong…

7
00:01:47,058 --> 00:01:49,018
is you!

8
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,764
That sword!

9
00:02:27,973 --> 00:02:29,725
The Imperial Sword, Elsdocia!

10
00:02:41,487 --> 00:02:43,280
He shortened his own life?

11
00:02:50,996 --> 00:02:53,666
I must create it.

12
00:02:58,254 --> 00:03:01,257
A world where everyone respects each other

13
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:03,717
and laughs with one another!

14
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,639
How could I be wrong
to want such a world?!

15
00:03:14,061 --> 00:03:15,813
Is this for real?

16
00:03:40,754 --> 00:03:43,048
Because there is no future
where you're headed.

17
00:03:56,437 --> 00:04:00,232
Even you deny me?!

18
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:04,069
If you seal me right now,

19
00:04:04,153 --> 00:04:06,572
you'll lose access to the Imperial Sword!

20
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,034
It does pain us
to lose our national treasure.

21
00:04:10,659 --> 00:04:15,372
But we no longer have
enough power to get it back.

22
00:04:15,956 --> 00:04:18,375
I take full responsibility for this

23
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,711
as the next Wizard King.

24
00:04:26,425 --> 00:04:29,762
I won't give up. I will not, Julius!

25
00:04:29,845 --> 00:04:32,348
Never giving up is my…

26
00:05:27,653 --> 00:05:31,991
SWORD OF THE WIZARD KING

27
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,752
CLOVER KINGDOM

28
00:06:19,580 --> 00:06:21,081
Welcome, everyone,

29
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:24,293
to the festival of magic battles
that takes place once a decade,

30
00:06:24,376 --> 00:06:25,419
the Triumph!

31
00:06:27,671 --> 00:06:31,300
The Triumph is a tournament of duels

32
00:06:31,383 --> 00:06:34,928
to decide the strongest Magic Knight!

33
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:37,306
It's long been said

34
00:06:37,389 --> 00:06:39,433
that the mage who wins this tournament

35
00:06:39,516 --> 00:06:41,852
would eventually be chosen
as the Wizard King!

36
00:06:43,937 --> 00:06:45,564
As you know,

37
00:06:45,648 --> 00:06:48,817
there are nine Magic Knights Squads
consisting of mages

38
00:06:48,901 --> 00:06:50,819
who specialize in battle.

39
00:06:50,903 --> 00:06:53,030
And under the direction
of the Wizard King,

40
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:56,784
the strongest mages
from the top Magic Knights Squad

41
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:59,912
protect the peace
of the Clover Kingdom every day.

42
00:07:00,454 --> 00:07:03,290
We will determine
the strongest member of the Magic Knights.

43
00:07:03,374 --> 00:07:06,585
Today is sure to be a memorable day!

44
00:07:07,378 --> 00:07:09,421
Thank you for waiting.

45
00:07:09,505 --> 00:07:11,006
The Triumph commences…

46
00:07:14,051 --> 00:07:16,470
Now! Shall we?

47
00:07:30,109 --> 00:07:31,443
By the way, Klaus,

48
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:34,321
why were we chosen
as the masters of the ceremony?

49
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:37,574
Because we're members
of the strongest Magic Knights Squad,

50
00:07:37,658 --> 00:07:39,243
the Golden Dawn Squad, of course!

51
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,995
Turn off the Amplification Magic first
before you talk!

52
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,831
Oh my, it totally slipped my mind!

53
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:46,458
Well… pardon the belated introduction.

54
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:49,336
My name is Mimosa Vermillion,
and I'll be your commentator.

55
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:51,004
This here is Klaus.

56
00:07:51,088 --> 00:07:54,299
Now is not the time
for introducing ourselves!

57
00:07:54,383 --> 00:07:57,553
Who in the world
chose Mimosa as a commentator?

58
00:07:57,636 --> 00:08:00,055
But, man, look at all these people.

59
00:08:00,139 --> 00:08:02,015
It's almost a full house.

60
00:08:02,808 --> 00:08:05,102
Of course it is. Because, you see…

61
00:08:14,153 --> 00:08:15,320
Yuno, my love!

62
00:08:18,907 --> 00:08:24,079
In the first round is Yuno,
the vice captain of the Golden Dawn Squad.

63
00:08:25,497 --> 00:08:30,252
Hooray, hooray, Yuno! Go, go, Yuno!

64
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:33,964
So Pretty Boy is in the first round.

65
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,175
Of course, everyone wants to see him.

66
00:08:36,258 --> 00:08:37,176
Right?

67
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,846
I only want to see
my dearest little sister, Marie.

68
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,599
As expected from Gauche…

69
00:08:43,682 --> 00:08:46,268
Man, I'm so ready to fight too!

70
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:48,353
I wish Asta could have joined us.

71
00:08:48,437 --> 00:08:52,858
He's in exile because of the demon trial.

72
00:08:52,941 --> 00:08:54,401
What a drag.

73
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,612
Why am I even on the roster?

74
00:08:56,695 --> 00:08:58,155
Go for it!

75
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:00,115
Oh, here he comes!

76
00:09:00,949 --> 00:09:01,950
What's that?

77
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,703
Hey, who the hell is that?

78
00:09:07,831 --> 00:09:10,417
Up against Yuno is, um…

79
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,921
"the Masked One"?

80
00:09:14,004 --> 00:09:17,257
There's no way you could enter
with such a ridiculous name…

81
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:18,383
Oh, you're right.

82
00:09:19,551 --> 00:09:21,637
What's with their getup?

83
00:09:22,221 --> 00:09:24,389
Mocking Yuno, are they?

84
00:09:25,974 --> 00:09:28,435
Festival of magic battles, the Triumph.

85
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:31,814
The first round is
Yuno vs. the Masked One.

86
00:09:31,897 --> 00:09:32,898
The match begins!

87
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,043
Attaboy, Asta!

88
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,924
The first attack is by Yuno!

89
00:09:59,007 --> 00:10:01,218
He used strong Wind Magic,

90
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:03,595
but the Masked One cut it in half,

91
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:05,639
completely neutralizing it!

92
00:10:06,223 --> 00:10:07,933
I guess it's begun.

93
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:28,829
Well then, Julius, shall we begin as well?

94
00:10:28,912 --> 00:10:30,372
Uh-huh!

95
00:10:30,455 --> 00:10:33,375
Barrier Magic, "Voodoo Shangrila"!

96
00:10:42,467 --> 00:10:45,762
What is this enormous magical power?!

97
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,016
You have no idea how long
I've been waiting for this day.

98
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:53,645
Today, I will change this country!

99
00:11:16,919 --> 00:11:21,173
How fragile you look, Julius.

100
00:11:21,256 --> 00:11:25,636
I absorbed only a little bit of magic,
and this is the toll it takes on you?

101
00:11:27,387 --> 00:11:29,848
I never expected to meet you again.

102
00:11:30,474 --> 00:11:32,351
I see. So, back then, you…

103
00:11:32,434 --> 00:11:36,146
Yes, I hope
you didn't mind me breaking the seal.

104
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:40,150
You were distracted for a second.

105
00:11:41,234 --> 00:11:42,736
And are you still…?

106
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:47,407
My ambition
has not changed a bit since then.

107
00:11:48,116 --> 00:11:50,619
I must create a world

108
00:11:50,702 --> 00:11:53,080
where everyone can respect each other

109
00:11:53,163 --> 00:11:55,290
and laugh with one another.

110
00:11:55,832 --> 00:11:57,459
And for that…

111
00:11:57,542 --> 00:12:01,296
My soldiers, it's time for domination.

112
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:04,675
We shall overthrow the Clover Kingdom!

113
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:08,011
Legion Magic: Gehenna Game.

114
00:12:27,072 --> 00:12:28,615
Stop it, Conrad!

115
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:52,514
All right, old man?

116
00:12:52,597 --> 00:12:55,267
Oh, thank you!

117
00:13:00,814 --> 00:13:02,065
Everyone, this way!

118
00:13:02,149 --> 00:13:04,276
Steel Magic: Fierce Spiral Lance!

119
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,949
Klaus, leave this to me!

120
00:13:27,507 --> 00:13:30,427
Why am I being targeted?!

121
00:13:35,098 --> 00:13:35,932
Yuno!

122
00:13:36,558 --> 00:13:39,895
Jeez, what's up with these guys?!
They totally ruined my perfect disguise!

123
00:13:39,978 --> 00:13:43,607
Here I thought you were some lost kid
from the festival who wandered in.

124
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,192
Who are you calling a kid?!

125
00:13:45,275 --> 00:13:47,694
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar!

126
00:13:48,528 --> 00:13:49,529
Whoa!

127
00:13:49,613 --> 00:13:51,281
Stupid Asta!

128
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:53,617
You could have told me
you were participating!

129
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:54,701
Noelle!

130
00:13:54,785 --> 00:13:56,703
I know you probably can't feel it,

131
00:13:56,787 --> 00:14:00,373
but it seems like everyone here
is getting their magical power absorbed.

132
00:14:00,457 --> 00:14:03,043
Those with little magical power
are unable to move!

133
00:14:03,126 --> 00:14:05,921
Oh no, really?! Are you okay?

134
00:14:06,004 --> 00:14:07,464
I'm a royal!

135
00:14:07,547 --> 00:14:10,550
A little loss of magic is nothing to me!

136
00:14:10,634 --> 00:14:12,052
Well then, that just means

137
00:14:12,135 --> 00:14:14,930
I'll have to work harder than anyone here!

138
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,599
Don't get too carried away.

139
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:19,392
I got your back!

140
00:14:19,976 --> 00:14:22,104
You just need to look ahead!

141
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:24,106
Yeah! Thanks!

142
00:14:52,509 --> 00:14:54,219
Those three?

143
00:14:54,302 --> 00:14:56,596
But that's impossible!

144
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:59,683
You must know them
if you're a Wizard King.

145
00:14:59,766 --> 00:15:02,227
Those three who had their status
as Wizard King revoked

146
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,855
because of their austerity and cruelty…

147
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:08,024
Who the heck are you?! Is this your doing?

148
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,986
What's with this child?
How come he can move?

149
00:15:11,069 --> 00:15:12,237
Uh-huh?

150
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,407
He doesn't have
any magical power to begin with.

151
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:18,410
No juice to speak of, huh? What a weirdo.

152
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:23,623
There is no way my soldiers would be
defeated by someone with no magic.

153
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:25,417
How interesting.

154
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:31,882
I managed to revive them with my magic
and the power of the Imperial Sword.

155
00:15:36,011 --> 00:15:40,932
Unlike you, those three have become
great supporters of my cause.

156
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,561
The four of us will create a new world!

157
00:15:44,644 --> 00:15:46,271
That's right.

158
00:15:46,354 --> 00:15:48,190
And you're in our way.

159
00:15:48,273 --> 00:15:51,359
Say what?!
I don't know what exactly you're up to,

160
00:15:51,443 --> 00:15:53,862
but I know that you're the bad guys!

161
00:15:53,945 --> 00:15:55,530
I will defeat you!

162
00:15:55,614 --> 00:15:57,490
Aren't you a lively one?

163
00:15:58,575 --> 00:16:01,077
Barrier Magic: Voodoo Regalia!

164
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,377
He neutralized magic?

165
00:16:11,588 --> 00:16:15,508
Conrad, I found a new toy you might like.

166
00:16:15,592 --> 00:16:17,844
You wanna play?

167
00:16:24,226 --> 00:16:26,102
Wizard King, are you all right?!

168
00:16:26,186 --> 00:16:28,438
No, Marx! Stay back!

169
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,609
Well, well, that's interesting magic.

170
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:36,905
Huh, so he's not gonna answer me.

171
00:16:36,988 --> 00:16:39,032
I take it I should do whatever I want?

172
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:41,534
Do not hurt him unnecessarily.

173
00:16:41,618 --> 00:16:43,995
Have the decency
to finish him in one blow.

174
00:16:44,621 --> 00:16:46,122
Hey, my toy!

175
00:16:51,294 --> 00:16:53,004
-Asta!
-La!

176
00:16:53,088 --> 00:16:54,923
Thanks, you all!

177
00:17:02,764 --> 00:17:06,309
Oh? Nice magic you got there.

178
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:10,563
It's useless against a Wizard King.

179
00:17:10,647 --> 00:17:12,774
What can a normal Magic Knight do?

180
00:17:13,358 --> 00:17:18,196
A peasant kid with no magic like him
is a Magic Knight?

181
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,865
It seems things have fallen far, Julius.

182
00:17:22,993 --> 00:17:24,286
I wouldn't be so sure.

183
00:17:24,995 --> 00:17:26,121
Come again?

184
00:17:26,204 --> 00:17:29,332
I don't think we've fallen that much.

185
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,876
Not me, nor the Magic Knights Squads.

186
00:17:34,212 --> 00:17:38,091
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked
Lightless Blade Storm!

187
00:17:56,776 --> 00:17:58,111
Thanks for waiting!

188
00:17:58,194 --> 00:18:01,031
A strong helper is here to assist you!

189
00:18:01,114 --> 00:18:04,034
Wait, what is this sinister magical power?

190
00:18:05,994 --> 00:18:08,830
It looks like I can paint
another masterpiece based on this!

191
00:18:08,913 --> 00:18:10,040
You're fighting me!

192
00:18:10,123 --> 00:18:13,084
I'll burn you to ashes
with the flame of justice!

193
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:16,629
That silhouette… You must be…

194
00:18:18,590 --> 00:18:20,216
Kaiser.

195
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:22,594
It's been a while.

196
00:18:23,636 --> 00:18:24,512
Captain Yami!

197
00:18:24,596 --> 00:18:25,430
My bad.

198
00:18:25,513 --> 00:18:28,683
I was taking a dump,
and it took me a while so I'm late.

199
00:18:29,267 --> 00:18:30,643
And who are these guys?

200
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,520
Not exactly sure,

201
00:18:32,604 --> 00:18:34,356
but I know they're really bad!

202
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:36,524
And things are really bad too!

203
00:18:36,608 --> 00:18:38,985
For real? Your vocabulary is really bad.

204
00:18:39,069 --> 00:18:41,112
He isn't wrong, you know.

205
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:44,074
It'd be difficult
to defeat them as we stand.

206
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:46,576
One possibility would be…

207
00:18:47,077 --> 00:18:48,244
Yami.

208
00:18:48,328 --> 00:18:51,956
Please head to the Magic Tool
Research Lab's Branch Zero right away.

209
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,126
I need you to bring the magic tool
we're co-developing with Nero.

210
00:18:56,586 --> 00:18:58,254
-No, thanks.
-Huh?!

211
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:02,967
If I went, then who'll have your back?
You're totally vulnerable.

212
00:19:03,927 --> 00:19:06,971
I have no interest in going through
what I did back then again.

213
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,391
Yami…

214
00:19:09,474 --> 00:19:12,519
I mean, if that's all you need,
we can send this guy.

215
00:19:12,602 --> 00:19:14,396
-Hey, kid, you're up.
-Huh?

216
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:17,232
Yo, Finral. You heard him.

217
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:19,192
Go to Branch Zero with him.

218
00:19:19,275 --> 00:19:20,360
Yes, sir!

219
00:19:20,443 --> 00:19:22,737
But if I went, this place would be…

220
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,784
So this is where you were hiding.

221
00:19:27,867 --> 00:19:29,786
Stop running around.

222
00:19:29,869 --> 00:19:31,746
I can't kill you swiftly.

223
00:19:44,884 --> 00:19:45,718
Oh?

224
00:19:46,302 --> 00:19:48,638
Stop blubbering and go already!

225
00:19:48,721 --> 00:19:52,308
If you don't come back soon,
I'll kick their butts all by myself!

226
00:19:52,392 --> 00:19:53,226
Yes, sir!

227
00:19:57,772 --> 00:19:58,898
Captain Yami!

228
00:19:58,982 --> 00:20:00,316
Quickly, Asta!

229
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,487
Because of that black barrier,
it's difficult to maintain spatial magic!

230
00:20:05,655 --> 00:20:07,824
You're a member of the Black Bulls Squad!

231
00:20:07,907 --> 00:20:09,367
Listen to your captain!

232
00:20:09,451 --> 00:20:10,869
Nice, Noelle!

233
00:20:11,494 --> 00:20:12,495
Whoa, whoa.

234
00:20:12,579 --> 00:20:15,457
A magic like that exists in this era?

235
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:18,334
Well, I guess I can analyze it later.

236
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:20,003
Whoa.

237
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:24,632
Voiuvre's Roar!

238
00:20:30,013 --> 00:20:33,558
Running away is pointless, I guess.

239
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:37,729
Dark Magic: Dark Cloaked Black Blade!

240
00:20:37,812 --> 00:20:40,732
Flame Magic: Spiral Flames!

241
00:20:48,865 --> 00:20:51,367
Their defense is getting
harder and harder.

242
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:53,953
The kids have come far.

243
00:20:54,037 --> 00:20:56,873
No, they've got a long way to go.

244
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:59,959
A long way to go
before they can fight alongside me.

245
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:07,675
I'm sorry, I wasn't able to contain them.

246
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:09,719
No, you've done well.

247
00:21:10,261 --> 00:21:13,223
Thanks to you, I got to send
my guys out on an errand.

248
00:21:13,806 --> 00:21:16,184
Whatever you do, it is pointless.

249
00:21:16,267 --> 00:21:18,645
If the Imperial Sword's magic
is activated,

250
00:21:18,728 --> 00:21:21,064
the Clover Kingdom will be destroyed.

251
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:24,400
Repeating the same thing
from ten years ago.

252
00:21:24,484 --> 00:21:28,404
Wait, wasn't the Imperial Sword
something that could absorb

253
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:31,324
and store magical power and stuff?

254
00:21:32,116 --> 00:21:34,953
Is it really possible
to destroy a country with it?

255
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:38,706
It can unleash
the stored magical power all at once.

256
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:43,336
Right now, the magical power
absorbed from everyone at the stadium

257
00:21:43,419 --> 00:21:45,380
is stored inside the Imperial Sword.

258
00:21:46,548 --> 00:21:47,840
With his magic,

259
00:21:47,924 --> 00:21:51,761
he could abuse that magical power
and the Imperial Sword as he wishes.

260
00:21:52,345 --> 00:21:55,974
"Abuse"? I'm using it to save the world.

261
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:59,102
I'd say it's the proper way to use it.

262
00:22:07,652 --> 00:22:09,445
Are you all right, Wizard King?

263
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,532
We have completed
the evacuation of the audience.

264
00:22:13,116 --> 00:22:15,118
All that's left is to defeat the rebels.

265
00:22:15,201 --> 00:22:17,453
Fuegoleon and Nozel.

266
00:22:17,537 --> 00:22:19,622
Have you gotten any stronger?

267
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:24,711
I never expected to fight
this monster again.

268
00:22:25,295 --> 00:22:27,046
Oh yeah, back then,

269
00:22:27,130 --> 00:22:30,675
Nozel got spooked, fell down,
cried, and soiled his pants, didn't he?

270
00:22:30,758 --> 00:22:32,844
Want me to dunk you in mercury, foreigner?

271
00:22:32,927 --> 00:22:35,430
Hey, those guys weren't there back then.

272
00:22:35,513 --> 00:22:36,389
Who are they?

273
00:22:36,472 --> 00:22:39,642
That woman's magic,
which produces magic soldiers…

274
00:22:39,726 --> 00:22:41,894
I remember seeing it
in my great-grandfather's journal.

275
00:22:42,895 --> 00:22:45,732
My sister was captivated by it,
so I remember it well.

276
00:22:45,815 --> 00:22:46,649
No way!

277
00:22:47,358 --> 00:22:50,403
Historical figures who died long ago…

278
00:22:50,486 --> 00:22:54,407
Wait, does that mean
former Wizard Kings have returned?

279
00:22:56,075 --> 00:22:57,201
Seriously?

280
00:22:57,285 --> 00:22:59,621
I gotta get their autographs
and scalp them.

281
00:22:59,704 --> 00:23:01,956
The former Wizard Kings have been revived?

282
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:05,251
It's so strange. I'm awake for a change,

283
00:23:05,335 --> 00:23:06,878
but this is like a dream.

284
00:23:08,254 --> 00:23:10,632
It gives me lots of inspiration!

285
00:23:11,257 --> 00:23:13,468
But maybe now's not the time for that.

286
00:23:17,805 --> 00:23:20,016
You seem to have gathered enough people,

287
00:23:20,099 --> 00:23:21,434
but this is where it ends.

288
00:23:31,319 --> 00:23:37,200
There are countless singular points
where veins of mana interact.

289
00:23:37,283 --> 00:23:39,327
This stadium is one of them.

290
00:23:40,286 --> 00:23:41,746
Ten years ago,

291
00:23:41,829 --> 00:23:43,873
I altered this stadium

292
00:23:43,956 --> 00:23:45,541
and turned it into a weapon.

293
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:49,796
You all interrupted me
before I could activate it.

294
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:26,249
The festival stadium.

295
00:24:27,083 --> 00:24:30,837
Also known as
the "Triumph" flying fortress.

296
00:24:32,505 --> 00:24:35,258
Now, there's no way to escape.

297
00:24:35,341 --> 00:24:40,012
Julius, it's time to turn the hands
of the clock you took away from me.

298
00:24:46,519 --> 00:24:49,188
Here we are. This is Branch Zero.

299
00:24:52,608 --> 00:24:54,026
Hey!

300
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:57,780
I'm Asta from
the Black Bulls Magic Knights Squad!

301
00:24:57,864 --> 00:24:59,031
Open the door!

302
00:24:59,115 --> 00:25:00,366
That won't do, Asta.

303
00:25:01,075 --> 00:25:05,496
Only a limited number of nobles
know about this lab.

304
00:25:06,122 --> 00:25:09,250
To enter, you have to spell out
a secret password with your magic…

305
00:25:13,755 --> 00:25:14,589
You are…

306
00:25:15,631 --> 00:25:17,467
You must be the Black Bulls.

307
00:25:18,468 --> 00:25:22,263
I'm Millie Maxwell,
the coordinator at this branch.

308
00:25:22,764 --> 00:25:23,973
Come on, hurry up.

309
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:25,349
Alright!

310
00:25:25,433 --> 00:25:28,102
We've been debriefed about the situation.

311
00:25:28,686 --> 00:25:31,105
From here on, she will show you around.

312
00:25:32,565 --> 00:25:34,317
I'll leave you to it.

313
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:35,735
Nero!

314
00:25:37,278 --> 00:25:39,822
The magic tool Julius needs

315
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:42,325
is stored in a place quite far away.

316
00:25:42,825 --> 00:25:44,952
Right now, Sally is making an adjustment.

317
00:25:45,036 --> 00:25:47,413
Experiment, experiment!

318
00:25:48,956 --> 00:25:50,500
So Sally is here too, huh?

319
00:25:51,083 --> 00:25:54,170
Nero, you've watched the Clover Kingdom

320
00:25:54,253 --> 00:25:56,380
over the last 500 years, right?

321
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,551
Do you know the people
who attacked the stadium?

322
00:26:01,719 --> 00:26:02,970
I'm sorry.

323
00:26:03,054 --> 00:26:05,389
I don't know everything, but…

324
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:08,226
the mastermind is Conrad Leto.

325
00:26:08,309 --> 00:26:09,185
What?

326
00:26:09,268 --> 00:26:11,646
I believe you've at least heard the name?

327
00:26:12,146 --> 00:26:13,147
Conrad?

328
00:26:14,106 --> 00:26:14,982
You don't mean…

329
00:26:18,194 --> 00:26:19,028
Yes.

330
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:22,281
He used to be
a Magic Knight of the Clover Kingdom.

331
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,952
He's the predecessor of Julius Novachrono.

332
00:26:26,911 --> 00:26:28,454
A former Wizard King.

333
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:33,960
But I thought the former Wizard King
died from a disease ten years ago.

334
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,170
I'll explain.

335
00:26:37,338 --> 00:26:38,172
Get on.

336
00:26:40,716 --> 00:26:44,303
Conrad Leto, the 27th Wizard King.

337
00:26:44,387 --> 00:26:46,931
Before he was chosen as the Wizard King,

338
00:26:47,014 --> 00:26:49,725
he was known as a powerful man
in the Clover Kingdom.

339
00:26:50,977 --> 00:26:53,521
He became a Magic Knight captain,

340
00:26:54,063 --> 00:26:57,275
establishing an impressive track record
with his squad.

341
00:26:57,775 --> 00:27:00,361
The citizens trusted him,

342
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:02,655
and his abilities were recognized.

343
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:05,074
He was finally chosen
to be the Wizard King.

344
00:27:05,908 --> 00:27:08,244
But he changed.

345
00:27:09,579 --> 00:27:11,581
He rebelled against the Kingdom,

346
00:27:11,664 --> 00:27:14,584
and as a result,
his status as the Wizard King was revoked.

347
00:27:15,209 --> 00:27:16,752
"Rebelled against"?

348
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:21,424
He tried to destroy the country.

349
00:27:21,507 --> 00:27:25,219
What?! The Wizard King's job
is to protect the peace for everyone.

350
00:27:25,303 --> 00:27:27,722
Why did he try to do something so crazy?

351
00:27:28,264 --> 00:27:29,223
I don't know.

352
00:27:30,016 --> 00:27:31,684
But he used Lemiel's…

353
00:27:32,268 --> 00:27:34,854
He used
the first Wizard King's magic item,

354
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:38,190
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia,
to make it happen.

355
00:27:39,317 --> 00:27:41,444
Julius and the others learned of his plan

356
00:27:41,527 --> 00:27:43,070
and sealed Conrad to stop him.

357
00:27:43,571 --> 00:27:45,197
"Sealed"?

358
00:27:45,281 --> 00:27:49,327
They announced that he died of an illness
so as not to panic the citizens.

359
00:27:50,161 --> 00:27:52,163
The current Wizard King, Julius,

360
00:27:52,246 --> 00:27:56,792
couldn't defeat him, even with all
the Magic Knights Squad elites.

361
00:27:57,585 --> 00:27:58,920
Julius had no choice

362
00:27:59,003 --> 00:28:02,590
but to use his Time Magic
to continue sealing him.

363
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,634
He's incredibly strong.

364
00:28:05,343 --> 00:28:07,011
What kind of magic does he use?

365
00:28:07,094 --> 00:28:07,970
Key Magic.

366
00:28:08,512 --> 00:28:11,307
He can open or close
anything and everything

367
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,309
with a key he creates with his magic.

368
00:28:13,893 --> 00:28:16,312
The magic space he opens with his key

369
00:28:16,395 --> 00:28:18,439
can absorb anything.

370
00:28:19,106 --> 00:28:21,108
Magic tools, grimoires.

371
00:28:21,776 --> 00:28:22,860
Even magic itself…

372
00:28:22,944 --> 00:28:23,861
Magic itself?!

373
00:28:23,945 --> 00:28:25,988
What? No way!

374
00:28:26,072 --> 00:28:26,906
Yes.

375
00:28:27,573 --> 00:28:30,242
He can steal the magic of others.

376
00:28:30,785 --> 00:28:33,996
And he can use it as he pleases.

377
00:28:37,166 --> 00:28:39,043
Sealing Magic: Inverse Release.

378
00:28:53,474 --> 00:28:55,059
How far are we going?

379
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:57,103
The security is extremely tight.

380
00:28:57,186 --> 00:28:58,312
Indeed.

381
00:28:58,396 --> 00:29:00,022
Because beyond this point…

382
00:29:14,203 --> 00:29:16,330
This is the innermost part of Branch Zero.

383
00:29:16,956 --> 00:29:21,043
This is where we store and research
the most important magic tools in the lab.

384
00:29:22,169 --> 00:29:25,381
Is what we've been asked to retrieve
also rare?

385
00:29:25,464 --> 00:29:26,298
Yes.

386
00:29:26,882 --> 00:29:28,884
It controls the power
of the Imperial Sword

387
00:29:28,968 --> 00:29:30,928
that Prince Lemiel was developing.

388
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:34,140
Something that serves as a sheath
for the Imperial Sword.

389
00:29:34,849 --> 00:29:36,475
It's still a prototype,

390
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:39,020
but we'll have to use it to seal Conrad.

391
00:29:46,485 --> 00:29:47,319
How?!

392
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:52,783
I had high hopes hearing that
it was a magic tool Lemiel was working on.

393
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,536
But it turns out it was just a toy.

394
00:29:57,496 --> 00:29:59,832
-Don't!
-Sally!

395
00:30:01,125 --> 00:30:03,002
Demon Slayer!

396
00:30:07,465 --> 00:30:08,632
Oh?

397
00:30:13,429 --> 00:30:14,263
Finral!

398
00:30:19,226 --> 00:30:20,686
I know you.

399
00:30:24,315 --> 00:30:25,775
How did you find this place?!

400
00:30:27,151 --> 00:30:29,570
You're Secré Swallowtail,

401
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:32,156
a member of the Black Bulls Squad.

402
00:30:32,656 --> 00:30:34,325
And you too, Asta.

403
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,077
Noelle Silva.

404
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,454
Finral Roulacase.

405
00:30:39,246 --> 00:30:43,042
Memory Exchange Magic, which allows
you to peek at someone else's memory.

406
00:30:43,584 --> 00:30:45,628
It's a magic of poor taste,

407
00:30:45,711 --> 00:30:49,215
but thanks to that,
I was able to easily locate this place.

408
00:30:49,298 --> 00:30:50,966
You used Marx's…

409
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,968
I'll tell you one more thing.

410
00:30:56,097 --> 00:30:58,182
Citizens of the Clover Kingdom!

411
00:30:58,265 --> 00:31:02,228
Surrender immediately
and offer your magical power as a tribute.

412
00:31:02,812 --> 00:31:03,938
Resistance is futile.

413
00:31:04,605 --> 00:31:06,732
My Legion Magic soldiers

414
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:10,194
will stop at nothing
until their last bit of power is spent!

415
00:31:10,861 --> 00:31:13,989
One of the former Wizard Kings, Princia.

416
00:31:14,824 --> 00:31:18,160
The Imperial Sword is supplying her
with the magical power it stored,

417
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:19,912
and her magic will have no limit.

418
00:31:20,955 --> 00:31:23,457
The Magic Knights Squads
have been wiped out.

419
00:31:23,541 --> 00:31:27,461
The citizens and the major facilities
of the kingdom have all been seized.

420
00:31:28,045 --> 00:31:29,213
No way…

421
00:31:29,296 --> 00:31:31,132
Impressive, no?

422
00:31:31,215 --> 00:31:33,259
Tens of thousands…

423
00:31:33,342 --> 00:31:37,471
She can create even more magic soldiers.

424
00:31:37,555 --> 00:31:41,600
You're being invaded by a military power
equal to an entire country.

425
00:31:41,684 --> 00:31:44,645
Those captains who helped you escape…

426
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,982
Captain Yami!

427
00:31:50,526 --> 00:31:54,905
As you can see, they just went to sleep.

428
00:31:56,157 --> 00:31:57,491
The people at the stadium…

429
00:31:57,992 --> 00:31:59,910
Brother Nozel!

430
00:32:00,578 --> 00:32:03,539
You're the youngest daughter
of the Silvas?

431
00:32:03,622 --> 00:32:06,417
A leftover child
of the Steel War Princess,

432
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,918
Acier Silva.

433
00:32:08,002 --> 00:32:12,548
How pathetic of Nozel
to fall before his little sister.

434
00:32:13,257 --> 00:32:15,176
To think that a coward like him

435
00:32:15,259 --> 00:32:17,720
is the Magic Knights Captain!

436
00:32:19,013 --> 00:32:21,515
Sea Dragon's Roar!

437
00:32:28,981 --> 00:32:32,443
Noelle! Dammit!

438
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:34,320
Oh?

439
00:32:34,403 --> 00:32:37,948
Still rough around the edges,
but this water magic is of high purity.

440
00:32:38,532 --> 00:32:39,909
I will take it.

441
00:32:46,916 --> 00:32:50,628
When there is such a clear difference
in abilities, it's so easy to take magic.

442
00:32:53,547 --> 00:32:56,425
My magic…

443
00:33:02,264 --> 00:33:05,059
Bastard… What did you do to Noelle?!

444
00:33:05,142 --> 00:33:07,686
Learn this the hard way.

445
00:33:08,354 --> 00:33:11,523
Water Creation Magic: Sea Dragon's Roar.

446
00:33:19,114 --> 00:33:21,784
That's Noelle's magic…

447
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:22,785
Give it back to her!

448
00:33:38,092 --> 00:33:40,135
I'll defeat you here and now!

449
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,639
So this is Anti-Magic,
the power to neutralize magic.

450
00:34:28,017 --> 00:34:29,351
Demon-Destroyer!

451
00:34:32,062 --> 00:34:34,565
What a wonderful power you possess.

452
00:34:35,149 --> 00:34:37,151
It can neutralize not only magic,

453
00:34:37,234 --> 00:34:40,154
but also phenomena derived from magic.

454
00:34:40,654 --> 00:34:43,032
I'd like to take your magic as well,

455
00:34:43,115 --> 00:34:45,409
but perhaps I should refrain.

456
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:48,662
I wouldn't want it
to affect my other magic.

457
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:50,789
Let's talk.

458
00:34:50,873 --> 00:34:53,417
The paths we walk are one and the same.

459
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,461
What the heck are you talking about now?!

460
00:34:55,544 --> 00:34:56,628
Of course they're not!

461
00:34:57,296 --> 00:35:00,591
The magic tool developed by Lemiel,
the first Wizard King,

462
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,343
the Imperial Sword Elsdocia.

463
00:35:03,427 --> 00:35:06,555
It is quite compatible with my Key Magic.

464
00:35:07,723 --> 00:35:10,976
The Imperial Sword was created
to leave behind the exceptional magic

465
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:14,063
of great mages and heroes
as a legacy for future generations.

466
00:35:14,563 --> 00:35:17,649
It stores every Wizard King's magic
and wisdom,

467
00:35:17,733 --> 00:35:20,736
not to mention a part of their souls.

468
00:35:21,362 --> 00:35:22,988
And one more thing.

469
00:35:23,072 --> 00:35:25,824
Using the function to absorb, store,

470
00:35:25,908 --> 00:35:29,244
and unleash the magical power all at once,

471
00:35:29,328 --> 00:35:31,997
I will compound
the generations of Wizard Kings' magic…

472
00:35:32,081 --> 00:35:33,123
FLAME EARTH WATER WIND

473
00:35:33,207 --> 00:35:35,584
…with the plethora of magic I've stolen

474
00:35:35,667 --> 00:35:38,629
and create Gargantuan Compound Magic!

475
00:35:38,712 --> 00:35:43,926
Our goal is to drive that
into the vein of the earth here.

476
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,888
It will cause unprecedented disaster.

477
00:35:47,971 --> 00:35:50,265
The foundation of the continent
will be destroyed,

478
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,768
and every single citizen will die.

479
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,437
But have no fear.

480
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:58,857
The Imperial Sword
can store the departed souls.

481
00:35:58,941 --> 00:36:00,359
So we will select

482
00:36:00,442 --> 00:36:03,654
and bring back only those people
who are valuable enough

483
00:36:03,737 --> 00:36:05,406
to live in the new world!

484
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:08,117
I've seen it in people's memories.

485
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:11,245
I was once loathed
and disliked because of my magic.

486
00:36:11,328 --> 00:36:13,414
So I know exactly how you feel.

487
00:36:13,497 --> 00:36:16,166
Those with magical power own everything,

488
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,044
and those without die helplessly.

489
00:36:19,128 --> 00:36:21,630
It's impossible, Asta.

490
00:36:21,713 --> 00:36:23,799
We must destroy everything first.

491
00:36:23,882 --> 00:36:27,636
Join me and together we'll create

492
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:32,933
an ideal world where everyone respects
each other and laughs with one another!

493
00:36:33,851 --> 00:36:37,938
Everyone who lives there respects
each other and laughs with one another.

494
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:41,024
That's the country I want to create
when I become the Wizard King!

495
00:36:41,108 --> 00:36:42,401
No!

496
00:36:42,484 --> 00:36:45,154
That's bullshit!

497
00:36:45,237 --> 00:36:50,659
The Wizard King is there
to protect the nation and its people!

498
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:53,162
I will not let you destroy it!

499
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,664
That's not what the Wizard King does!

500
00:36:56,540 --> 00:36:59,376
An ideal world will be built
upon the meaningless lives

501
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,670
of those who are oppressed.

502
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:05,507
I can give meaning to their lives!

503
00:37:05,591 --> 00:37:07,384
Why can't you see that?!

504
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:13,348
Of course I can't!
What you're saying is absolutely crazy!

505
00:37:15,267 --> 00:37:18,228
You don't see
the true nature of the world yet.

506
00:37:18,812 --> 00:37:19,730
I'm disappointed.

507
00:37:20,355 --> 00:37:22,191
Shut up!

508
00:37:22,274 --> 00:37:26,153
You're just thinking of yourself!

509
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:37,664
Why can't you understand?!

510
00:37:40,918 --> 00:37:43,337
I know you've experienced it!

511
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,758
The unfairness! The betrayal!
And the inequality of this country!

512
00:37:52,763 --> 00:37:54,348
Choose, Asta.

513
00:37:54,431 --> 00:37:56,517
Walk this path with me

514
00:37:57,809 --> 00:37:59,978
or die.

515
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,960
Give up already, Asta.

516
00:38:23,502 --> 00:38:24,670
You are me.

517
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,089
You can be me.

518
00:38:28,549 --> 00:38:31,969
By dawn tomorrow,
the fusion of magic will be complete.

519
00:38:32,052 --> 00:38:34,346
At that point, you will be…

520
00:38:37,224 --> 00:38:42,229
Give… Noelle back… her magic…

521
00:38:44,314 --> 00:38:45,190
I see.

522
00:38:46,441 --> 00:38:49,361
It's truly regrettable.

523
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,489
I will

524
00:38:53,407 --> 00:38:54,908
not give up.

525
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,453
Never giving up

526
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:01,873
is my magic!

527
00:39:11,133 --> 00:39:12,801
I have no magical power left.

528
00:39:13,635 --> 00:39:14,678
What do I do?

529
00:39:14,761 --> 00:39:17,639
But we still have to give it a try!

530
00:39:29,276 --> 00:39:31,111
You… you're Yuno!

531
00:39:32,112 --> 00:39:33,113
Millie!

532
00:39:33,196 --> 00:39:36,199
He insisted he came to help you all.

533
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:37,826
Drink up, Sally!

534
00:39:38,577 --> 00:39:39,870
Okay.

535
00:39:41,455 --> 00:39:43,915
Sorry, but we'll have to play this by ear.

536
00:39:44,458 --> 00:39:45,834
Play it by ear?

537
00:39:45,917 --> 00:39:47,377
Sounds fun!

538
00:39:48,003 --> 00:39:48,920
Not at all.

539
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,840
It's the phrase
I hate the most in the world.

540
00:40:16,031 --> 00:40:18,450
Yuno…

541
00:40:23,497 --> 00:40:26,583
I never thought I'd use it like this,

542
00:40:26,667 --> 00:40:30,462
but let's try and activate it
with all the magic we have!

543
00:40:30,545 --> 00:40:31,838
Nonsense.

544
00:40:31,922 --> 00:40:33,715
It may be. But…

545
00:40:33,799 --> 00:40:36,051
I can hit you thanks to everyone's help!

546
00:40:36,927 --> 00:40:39,054
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

547
00:40:47,521 --> 00:40:48,772
He's a monster!

548
00:40:50,357 --> 00:40:51,400
We'll retreat for now!

549
00:41:12,295 --> 00:41:15,549
It's me. How is the fusion of magic going?

550
00:41:15,632 --> 00:41:19,010
Uh-huh? We're at about 20%.

551
00:41:19,511 --> 00:41:21,221
Generally speaking, it's going well.

552
00:41:21,888 --> 00:41:24,599
It should be completed by dawn,
as scheduled.

553
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,059
Understood.

554
00:41:26,643 --> 00:41:28,145
Thank you.

555
00:41:28,228 --> 00:41:30,230
For walking this path with me.

556
00:41:30,897 --> 00:41:32,357
Finally, we'll create it.

557
00:41:32,441 --> 00:41:33,942
The strongest country

558
00:41:34,025 --> 00:41:36,737
with no tears and where no one
is robbed of what they have!

559
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:41,116
Once again, save the poor lost souls…

560
00:41:41,700 --> 00:41:47,330
What I seek is a world
where no one oppresses or is oppressed.

561
00:41:47,414 --> 00:41:52,169
I trust that you can achieve that, Conrad.

562
00:41:53,003 --> 00:41:53,837
Yes.

563
00:41:54,337 --> 00:41:56,173
How about the veins?

564
00:41:56,757 --> 00:42:00,135
Uh-huh? I found the perfect one.

565
00:42:00,635 --> 00:42:02,304
It's at a village called Hage,

566
00:42:02,387 --> 00:42:06,057
in the Forsaken Realm
where the demon's skeleton lies.

567
00:42:14,441 --> 00:42:19,029
My Key Magic is useless
unless I borrow someone's power.

568
00:42:19,821 --> 00:42:23,909
That's why it is meaningful
that I'm the one who finishes this.

569
00:42:24,409 --> 00:42:27,829
One day, I will even change this country.

570
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:34,503
Never giving up is my magic!

571
00:42:42,636 --> 00:42:44,721
Never giving up…

572
00:43:03,323 --> 00:43:04,157
Where am I?

573
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:07,953
Oh, Noelle!

574
00:43:08,995 --> 00:43:10,705
You're awake.

575
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:13,375
I'm sorry that all I could provide
was first aid.

576
00:43:13,458 --> 00:43:14,709
Mimosa.

577
00:43:15,669 --> 00:43:16,920
You're safe.

578
00:43:22,175 --> 00:43:25,262
This is a Golden Dawn emergency shelter.

579
00:43:25,887 --> 00:43:27,764
It's still under construction,

580
00:43:27,848 --> 00:43:29,558
so only a few members know about it.

581
00:43:29,641 --> 00:43:34,271
We were almost captured
and our magic stolen,

582
00:43:34,354 --> 00:43:36,439
but the captains let us escape.

583
00:43:42,988 --> 00:43:45,407
Take care of the kid for me.

584
00:43:47,617 --> 00:43:50,036
I don't know what happened afterwards,

585
00:43:50,120 --> 00:43:52,330
but if they're not here yet…

586
00:43:55,876 --> 00:43:57,210
Hey, are you okay?

587
00:43:57,294 --> 00:43:59,462
Asta! Please excuse me.

588
00:44:00,672 --> 00:44:01,673
Asta!

589
00:44:01,756 --> 00:44:04,175
You should not move
until the treatment is over.

590
00:44:05,635 --> 00:44:08,179
Conrad… needs to be stopped.

591
00:44:08,972 --> 00:44:11,308
He's going to destroy this kingdom.

592
00:44:11,892 --> 00:44:13,226
If we don't do something,

593
00:44:13,310 --> 00:44:15,729
it will happen tomorrow at dawn!

594
00:44:15,812 --> 00:44:17,147
At dawn?

595
00:44:17,230 --> 00:44:19,399
But if the enemies are so formidable…

596
00:44:19,482 --> 00:44:21,610
Why would a former Wizard King…

597
00:44:21,693 --> 00:44:23,987
What could we possibly do by ourselves?

598
00:44:28,116 --> 00:44:29,200
What could we do?

599
00:44:29,284 --> 00:44:32,329
Now that it's come to this,
we should run away!

600
00:44:32,412 --> 00:44:34,372
There's nothing we can do with so few,

601
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:36,750
and who knows when they'll find us here!

602
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:37,751
Let's run!

603
00:44:37,834 --> 00:44:39,252
To some other country!

604
00:44:39,336 --> 00:44:41,755
Maybe the Heart Kingdom will take us in.

605
00:44:42,464 --> 00:44:45,258
This is not a problem we alone can solve…

606
00:44:45,342 --> 00:44:47,761
Yes, we could ask other nations for help.

607
00:44:48,470 --> 00:44:51,556
There are injured people.
Getting them to the border would be tough.

608
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:54,935
If the enemy is the former Wizard King,
do we have any chance of winning?

609
00:44:55,018 --> 00:44:56,895
With Julius gone…

610
00:44:56,978 --> 00:44:59,022
What could we do by ourselves?

611
00:45:00,982 --> 00:45:03,777
We gotta do something!

612
00:45:03,860 --> 00:45:05,320
If we cave in,

613
00:45:05,403 --> 00:45:08,740
then who will protect this kingdom
and everyone in it?

614
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:13,411
Aren't we the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom?!

615
00:45:14,746 --> 00:45:18,416
We've been able to live
happily and peacefully

616
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,670
thanks to the Wizard King
and the Magic Knights Squads!

617
00:45:22,170 --> 00:45:27,092
Before we joined, or when we were kids,
or even before we were born,

618
00:45:27,634 --> 00:45:30,679
the Magic Knights Squads
were fighting for us.

619
00:45:31,429 --> 00:45:36,685
And the Wizard King has stood
at the helm to protect this kingdom.

620
00:45:36,768 --> 00:45:40,188
It's thanks to those efforts
made by one person for another

621
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:43,441
that the Clover Kingdom exists now.

622
00:45:43,525 --> 00:45:45,485
That's why we are here!

623
00:45:45,568 --> 00:45:46,695
Asta…

624
00:45:47,278 --> 00:45:49,239
I can't just sit and watch!

625
00:45:49,823 --> 00:45:51,032
It's my turn to protect

626
00:45:51,116 --> 00:45:55,495
what the Wizard King
and the captains have protected!

627
00:45:56,246 --> 00:46:00,667
But it's not just me. It's our turn!

628
00:46:01,251 --> 00:46:04,170
I can heal an injury like this
with my fighting spirit!

629
00:46:04,254 --> 00:46:08,008
And then I will kick his butt,
for real this time!

630
00:46:18,226 --> 00:46:20,770
With all of us, we can stop Conrad!

631
00:46:22,105 --> 00:46:24,941
We may not be strong enough by ourselves,

632
00:46:25,025 --> 00:46:28,611
but if we come together,
we can become an immense force!

633
00:46:29,779 --> 00:46:33,283
That's why we,
the Magic Knights Squads, are strong!

634
00:46:34,367 --> 00:46:37,203
If all the Magic Knights Squads
join their power,

635
00:46:37,287 --> 00:46:39,497
we could face any enemy!

636
00:46:40,749 --> 00:46:42,834
I'm not forcing you to come with me.

637
00:46:43,710 --> 00:46:45,170
Like Sekke said,

638
00:46:45,253 --> 00:46:48,798
you can still escape to the Heart Kingdom
or elsewhere if you go now.

639
00:46:49,382 --> 00:46:54,345
But if any of you
is willing to lend me your power…

640
00:46:56,890 --> 00:46:59,893
Jeez, what you suggest is so reckless.

641
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:04,105
But coming from you, who's trying to do
the most reckless thing,

642
00:47:04,189 --> 00:47:05,315
I guess I can't say no.

643
00:47:18,161 --> 00:47:21,539
I'm not letting you go alone.
Not a chance.

644
00:47:28,171 --> 00:47:30,215
The Wizard King isn't here!

645
00:47:30,298 --> 00:47:32,550
We don't have the captains to rely on!

646
00:47:32,634 --> 00:47:34,761
But that doesn't matter!

647
00:47:35,261 --> 00:47:37,305
Now it's our turn to carry on!

648
00:47:37,388 --> 00:47:40,934
We'll fight on their behalf!

649
00:47:41,518 --> 00:47:42,560
I'll say it again.

650
00:47:42,644 --> 00:47:46,606
We are the Magic Knights Squads
of the Clover Kingdom!

651
00:47:46,689 --> 00:47:49,067
Right here, right now!
We'll surpass our limits,

652
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,860
and protect this country!

653
00:47:50,944 --> 00:47:52,821
Yeah!

654
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:55,198
And what is the actual plan?

655
00:47:55,281 --> 00:47:57,534
I'm going to figure that out now!

656
00:47:57,617 --> 00:47:58,827
What?!

657
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,037
I can't take this anymore, bwa-ha!

658
00:48:01,871 --> 00:48:05,416
Now that it has come to this,
I have to escape, even if it's just me!

659
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:07,836
Huh?

660
00:48:07,919 --> 00:48:09,045
Bwa-ha!

661
00:48:14,425 --> 00:48:15,635
Without any plans…

662
00:48:18,429 --> 00:48:22,142
Stop boasting, you imbecile!

663
00:48:32,235 --> 00:48:34,654
Lady Big-sis-leon! Everyone else, too!

664
00:48:35,238 --> 00:48:38,158
I didn't know you were alive! Ouch!

665
00:48:38,241 --> 00:48:41,035
Who are you calling "Big-sis-leon"?

666
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:42,162
And don't assume I'm dead.

667
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:45,874
I was away for training.

668
00:48:48,793 --> 00:48:49,836
But it seems…

669
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:53,548
something fun is going on.

670
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:57,177
I've also been away
on a mission with Jack.

671
00:48:58,761 --> 00:49:02,390
Which is why I didn't get caught by
pursuers and was able to arrive here.

672
00:49:03,766 --> 00:49:05,185
Same for me.

673
00:49:05,268 --> 00:49:07,353
We must go rescue everyone.

674
00:49:07,437 --> 00:49:08,688
Hehe.

675
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,358
Some of the people who went on a mission
with us are fine as well.

676
00:49:13,234 --> 00:49:17,238
They're out there,
surveilling that huge flying fortress.

677
00:49:18,114 --> 00:49:21,701
It looks like Yami
and the other captains are alive.

678
00:49:22,285 --> 00:49:25,413
They're trapped inside a barrier though.

679
00:49:26,039 --> 00:49:26,873
Captain Yami!

680
00:49:26,956 --> 00:49:28,458
My brother Nozel!

681
00:49:28,541 --> 00:49:31,211
Yami! I'm so glad!

682
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:33,379
But I don't get it.

683
00:49:33,463 --> 00:49:36,716
Why have the enemy captured
the citizens and the Magic Knights Squads

684
00:49:37,217 --> 00:49:38,468
but are keeping them alive?

685
00:49:39,093 --> 00:49:40,803
Because they need their magical powers.

686
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:45,600
If they absorb power through the Sword
and supply it to their members,

687
00:49:45,683 --> 00:49:47,727
they will never run out of magical power.

688
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:50,355
Hehe, so they're the feed.

689
00:49:50,438 --> 00:49:54,108
Oh man! He also mentioned
that he needs lots of magical power

690
00:49:54,192 --> 00:49:56,236
for his crazy ambition to come true!

691
00:49:56,819 --> 00:49:58,905
So that's why he's keeping them alive.

692
00:49:58,988 --> 00:50:01,824
So if their magical power runs out,
Yami and the others will be…

693
00:50:02,825 --> 00:50:04,369
We don't have much time left.

694
00:50:04,452 --> 00:50:05,912
Asta, everyone.

695
00:50:05,995 --> 00:50:08,748
Let's join forces
to take back this kingdom.

696
00:50:09,249 --> 00:50:10,208
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

697
00:50:10,291 --> 00:50:15,046
Before we do, we must eat-la!

698
00:50:24,764 --> 00:50:27,934
Oh! Charmy, you're okay!

699
00:50:28,017 --> 00:50:31,854
Yup. Thanks to Rouge and Captain Yami,
who let me escape.

700
00:50:32,814 --> 00:50:34,607
Oh! You all!

701
00:50:35,692 --> 00:50:37,443
Noelle, I'm glad you're okay.

702
00:50:37,944 --> 00:50:40,905
Our base was trapped
inside the barrier as well.

703
00:50:41,531 --> 00:50:45,243
Henry and Gordon are trapped inside,
but they're okay for now.

704
00:50:45,326 --> 00:50:46,411
Then,

705
00:50:47,620 --> 00:50:49,998
we gotta go get them, right?

706
00:50:51,332 --> 00:50:53,084
The base of the Black Bulls…

707
00:50:57,130 --> 00:51:00,341
The Imperial Sword has collected
the magical power of all the citizens,

708
00:51:00,425 --> 00:51:03,011
which will be driven into
a "singular point" vein of mana.

709
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:07,307
Ha! Then that's the end for this kingdom.

710
00:51:07,390 --> 00:51:09,100
The enemy Wizard Kings

711
00:51:09,183 --> 00:51:13,021
must have been revived with
the Imperial Sword and Conrad's magic.

712
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:18,526
So if we destroy the Imperial Sword,
do we stop the power of the Wizard Kings?

713
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:21,529
Judging from Conrad's actions,

714
00:51:21,612 --> 00:51:23,031
that's highly likely.

715
00:51:24,198 --> 00:51:25,033
Very well!

716
00:51:25,116 --> 00:51:28,661
The final goal is to destroy
the Imperial Sword and neutralize it!

717
00:51:29,329 --> 00:51:32,457
Go and prepare for encountering the enemy!

718
00:51:32,999 --> 00:51:36,669
We don't have much time before dawn,
our time limit!

719
00:51:46,054 --> 00:51:48,514
I still can't use
the spells in my grimoire,

720
00:51:48,598 --> 00:51:51,601
but thanks to Charmy,
my magic has returned.

721
00:51:51,684 --> 00:51:55,271
I'll focus on what I can do now!

722
00:52:10,953 --> 00:52:11,788
Yuno!

723
00:52:16,959 --> 00:52:18,544
Are you ready, Asta?

724
00:52:19,253 --> 00:52:20,088
Yeah!

725
00:52:23,508 --> 00:52:27,095
BLACK BULLS SQUAD BASE

726
00:52:28,304 --> 00:52:32,016
This is strange. When I got back
from training, there was only Henry here.

727
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,937
And former Wizard Kings have been revived,
and they've taken over the capital…

728
00:52:46,406 --> 00:52:48,282
I'm going to retake the base!

729
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:51,411
First, we will go and rescue
those at the Black Bulls base.

730
00:52:52,787 --> 00:52:54,831
Are you sure?

731
00:52:54,914 --> 00:52:59,085
This plan depends on how much
fighting power we can preserve.

732
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:04,215
For that, we need something that allows us
to move safely but in large numbers.

733
00:53:04,298 --> 00:53:05,133
I see.

734
00:53:06,008 --> 00:53:07,260
Don't you get it?

735
00:53:07,927 --> 00:53:10,096
At your base, that's possible.

736
00:53:11,097 --> 00:53:16,310
But Conrad is a formidable foe
who uses many types of magic at will.

737
00:53:16,936 --> 00:53:20,189
Normal magic attacks will be canceled out.

738
00:53:20,273 --> 00:53:22,483
And that's where you come in, Asta.

739
00:53:22,567 --> 00:53:27,530
Since you have Anti-Magic,
which neutralizes any kind of magic,

740
00:53:27,613 --> 00:53:30,199
only you have the chance to defeat Conrad.

741
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:32,702
This is the key point of the plan.

742
00:53:33,202 --> 00:53:36,080
Please stop Conrad. Can I count on you?

743
00:53:37,123 --> 00:53:38,040
Yes, sir!

744
00:53:47,300 --> 00:53:48,634
All right!

745
00:53:49,927 --> 00:53:51,345
Welcome back, everyone.

746
00:53:51,888 --> 00:53:53,181
And we have so many guests…

747
00:53:53,264 --> 00:53:55,224
That's the story, Henry.

748
00:53:55,308 --> 00:53:57,560
Can you do it?

749
00:53:58,186 --> 00:54:01,439
Okay!

750
00:54:02,398 --> 00:54:07,153
Well then! You recover
the magic you lost by eating-la!

751
00:54:09,864 --> 00:54:16,454
I've never felt
this much magical power before!

752
00:54:39,143 --> 00:54:40,770
Cool!

753
00:54:40,853 --> 00:54:43,606
So this is the flying style
of the Black Bulls!

754
00:54:43,689 --> 00:54:46,734
Is this really going to fly?

755
00:54:46,817 --> 00:54:52,114
If there's enough magical power,

756
00:54:52,198 --> 00:54:53,908
I think it will--

757
00:54:58,788 --> 00:55:01,457
More than we expected, huh?

758
00:55:01,541 --> 00:55:02,959
Hehe!

759
00:55:03,042 --> 00:55:04,544
Severing Magic…

760
00:55:07,129 --> 00:55:10,299
Death Scythe: Lunatic Slash!

761
00:55:11,634 --> 00:55:13,344
Briar Magic…

762
00:55:14,136 --> 00:55:15,638
Crimson Vine Spear.

763
00:55:24,939 --> 00:55:26,816
A drop in a bucket, was it?

764
00:55:26,899 --> 00:55:29,318
Hehe! How annoying.

765
00:55:30,736 --> 00:55:31,737
What?!

766
00:55:31,821 --> 00:55:32,947
Bwa-ha!

767
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:43,416
Hehe! Looks like this is worth severing!

768
00:55:44,125 --> 00:55:46,127
We will stop them here!

769
00:55:46,794 --> 00:55:49,130
You all go on ahead!

770
00:55:49,213 --> 00:55:51,549
Captain Jack! Captain Charlotte!

771
00:55:51,632 --> 00:55:53,259
This will be pointless if you go!

772
00:55:54,552 --> 00:55:56,554
But those two alone couldn't…

773
00:55:57,138 --> 00:55:58,931
It might be impossible, yes.

774
00:55:59,015 --> 00:55:59,849
Then,

775
00:55:59,932 --> 00:56:01,517
how about three?

776
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:10,776
World Tree Magic…

777
00:56:11,402 --> 00:56:12,987
Great Mistilteinn Tree!

778
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:24,206
Now, go while you can!

779
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:25,541
Captain Vangeance!

780
00:56:25,625 --> 00:56:28,377
Are you ready?

781
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:52,193
Yuno.

782
00:56:52,276 --> 00:56:54,236
I'm leaving the Wizard King in your care.

783
00:56:55,279 --> 00:56:56,364
Well then,

784
00:56:56,447 --> 00:56:58,908
let's have the barbarous guests leave.

785
00:57:05,331 --> 00:57:07,083
Listen up, everyone!

786
00:57:07,166 --> 00:57:10,419
We are minus three captains,
but we'll head into enemy territory…

787
00:57:11,003 --> 00:57:12,171
No, Asta.

788
00:57:12,254 --> 00:57:13,172
You tell them.

789
00:57:18,928 --> 00:57:21,180
Okay, let's go, everyone!

790
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:23,015
We'll kick their butts

791
00:57:23,099 --> 00:57:26,227
and get the Clover Kingdom back!

792
00:57:27,061 --> 00:57:29,230
Yeah!

793
00:57:33,192 --> 00:57:35,695
A report from my soldiers.

794
00:57:35,778 --> 00:57:39,615
The rebels have started to move.
How shall I deal with them?

795
00:57:40,366 --> 00:57:41,867
So you're here.

796
00:57:43,035 --> 00:57:46,038
That's right. I knew you would come.

797
00:57:47,206 --> 00:57:49,125
It is time for the finale.

798
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:51,877
I saved you the best seat.

799
00:57:52,753 --> 00:57:54,964
Is that why you kept me alive until now,

800
00:57:55,047 --> 00:57:57,133
even after I've lost most of my power?

801
00:57:57,216 --> 00:58:00,177
Those you love, those you want to protect.

802
00:58:00,720 --> 00:58:05,141
Burn into your eyes the image of
your trusted ones dying miserable deaths.

803
00:58:05,224 --> 00:58:08,686
Die as you agonize
over how powerless you are.

804
00:58:09,729 --> 00:58:12,773
This is the beginning
of a new Clover Kingdom.

805
00:58:12,857 --> 00:58:15,901
Let us turn a new page!

806
00:58:29,999 --> 00:58:32,626
What is that?!

807
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,882
Whoa, it's enormous!

808
00:58:37,965 --> 00:58:42,636
It's incomparable to the one that was
at the Magic Knights Squad base!

809
00:58:42,720 --> 00:58:44,096
Everyone, look!

810
00:58:49,101 --> 00:58:55,024
Well, well, let me see
the last squeeze of power you have.

811
00:58:55,608 --> 00:58:56,776
And let me teach you

812
00:58:57,485 --> 00:59:01,781
that the Wizard King
is never caught off-guard!

813
00:59:09,288 --> 00:59:11,707
So, what are you going to do?

814
00:59:13,959 --> 00:59:16,629
This is the power of the Wizard King?

815
00:59:16,712 --> 00:59:19,465
It's in another league! What should we do?

816
00:59:20,341 --> 00:59:21,425
Asta!

817
00:59:22,843 --> 00:59:24,553
It's not your turn yet!

818
00:59:25,054 --> 00:59:27,515
What do we do?
More like, what don't we do?

819
00:59:27,598 --> 00:59:31,310
We've always surpassed our limits, right?

820
00:59:35,731 --> 00:59:37,441
Ready, you guys?

821
00:59:38,108 --> 00:59:40,653
-Let's show him what we're made of!
-Yeah!

822
00:59:40,736 --> 00:59:44,615
Flame Magic: Exploding Fireball!

823
00:59:44,698 --> 00:59:47,618
Lightning Magic: Thunderbolt Destruction!

824
00:59:47,701 --> 00:59:50,621
Poison Magic: Forbidden Fruit!

825
00:59:50,704 --> 00:59:52,832
Everyone!

826
00:59:53,332 --> 00:59:55,209
Are you ready?

827
00:59:55,292 --> 00:59:57,711
Yeah!

828
01:00:02,216 --> 01:00:05,261
Mirror Magic: Large Reflect Refrain!

829
01:00:08,722 --> 01:00:10,766
Go!

830
01:00:24,655 --> 01:00:27,116
Bwa-ha! Again?!

831
01:00:27,199 --> 01:00:28,325
Now's the chance!

832
01:00:28,409 --> 01:00:30,703
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel Gate!

833
01:00:34,832 --> 01:00:35,708
Well, well.

834
01:00:35,791 --> 01:00:40,170
Whoa, whoa, we're about to arrive
at the enormous barrier!

835
01:00:40,671 --> 01:00:43,132
The space is shut off from here on,

836
01:00:43,215 --> 01:00:45,175
so I can't break through with my magic.

837
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:47,928
So, I'm counting on you.

838
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:54,977
I know you can do this.

839
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:56,645
Asta!

840
01:01:09,742 --> 01:01:11,785
Stop running around!

841
01:01:15,789 --> 01:01:19,543
Thanks for voluntarily walking
into the trap.

842
01:01:19,627 --> 01:01:22,254
Magic like this will not--

843
01:01:22,338 --> 01:01:24,590
Sealing Magic: Eternal Prison!

844
01:01:26,091 --> 01:01:28,552
Finral, now! Do it quickly!

845
01:01:28,636 --> 01:01:31,805
Alright! Not said this in a while,
but remember I'm your senior!

846
01:01:32,973 --> 01:01:34,558
Good. Now…

847
01:01:42,232 --> 01:01:43,442
Didn't I tell you?

848
01:01:43,525 --> 01:01:45,361
I'm never caught off-guard!

849
01:01:59,458 --> 01:02:01,502
Thank you so much!

850
01:02:07,049 --> 01:02:12,137
Uh-huh? This special barrier has been
fortified with the Imperial Sword,

851
01:02:12,221 --> 01:02:15,891
so even if it gets broken,
it'll regenerate and not be a problem.

852
01:02:15,975 --> 01:02:21,438
To create the perfect world, we should
get rid of those who get in our way.

853
01:02:21,522 --> 01:02:23,273
This is the end!

854
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:24,692
For you!

855
01:02:31,573 --> 01:02:34,994
I love it, I love it! Struggle for me.

856
01:02:35,077 --> 01:02:37,705
Mana Zone: Fangs of Riot…

857
01:02:37,788 --> 01:02:38,747
Double Attacks!

858
01:02:40,624 --> 01:02:42,418
Was that supposed to hurt me?!

859
01:02:43,002 --> 01:02:44,878
Now! Fire at will!

860
01:02:51,010 --> 01:02:52,219
One more time!

861
01:02:57,141 --> 01:02:59,601
Are you ready?

862
01:03:02,771 --> 01:03:05,024
I love it, you guys.

863
01:03:05,524 --> 01:03:06,567
Bring it on!

864
01:03:18,454 --> 01:03:21,623
-Go!
-Go!

865
01:03:31,216 --> 01:03:33,594
Ha! Are you serious?

866
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:35,888
You guys are amazing!

867
01:03:36,722 --> 01:03:37,598
However!

868
01:03:38,974 --> 01:03:40,142
Everyone!

869
01:03:40,809 --> 01:03:42,394
I'm counting on you, Asta!

870
01:03:42,478 --> 01:03:44,730
You defeat him!

871
01:03:44,813 --> 01:03:48,192
Alright! I'm off!

872
01:03:50,736 --> 01:03:52,154
Hey, check that out.

873
01:03:52,821 --> 01:03:54,156
Conrad?!

874
01:03:54,740 --> 01:03:56,116
Why is he there?

875
01:03:57,117 --> 01:03:59,119
Oh, the singular point…

876
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:02,915
Is it the skeleton of a demon?

877
01:04:06,752 --> 01:04:08,712
Uh-huh!

878
01:04:09,379 --> 01:04:13,175
Don't you dare get in our way!

879
01:04:21,016 --> 01:04:23,685
Asta! You go to Conrad!

880
01:04:27,356 --> 01:04:28,690
Give him all you got!

881
01:04:29,775 --> 01:04:30,776
Yeah!

882
01:04:43,122 --> 01:04:44,498
Let's go, Bell!

883
01:04:44,581 --> 01:04:45,415
I'm ready!

884
01:04:46,750 --> 01:04:47,960
Going all out!

885
01:04:57,094 --> 01:04:58,720
Spirit Assimilation…

886
01:04:58,804 --> 01:04:59,847
Spirit Dive!

887
01:05:03,934 --> 01:05:06,270
All units! Get into your positions!

888
01:05:06,353 --> 01:05:09,565
Just as planned, we succeeded
in splitting the enemy force!

889
01:05:10,983 --> 01:05:13,443
Now each of you will fight to the end

890
01:05:13,527 --> 01:05:16,363
with the pride of a Magic Knights Squad!

891
01:05:16,989 --> 01:05:19,950
If you don't,
then you have me to answer to!

892
01:05:20,576 --> 01:05:24,246
And not one of you
is allowed to die either.

893
01:05:25,164 --> 01:05:27,791
If you slack off, or if you die,

894
01:05:27,875 --> 01:05:29,960
then I will burn you to death myself!

895
01:05:31,837 --> 01:05:33,547
Listen well, all of you.

896
01:05:33,630 --> 01:05:35,215
If you don't want to die,

897
01:05:35,299 --> 01:05:37,509
then fight on, even if it kills you!

898
01:05:38,427 --> 01:05:40,345
-Let's go!
-Yeah!

899
01:05:42,389 --> 01:05:46,268
No tricks to speak of
for fighting against me?

900
01:05:46,351 --> 01:05:50,522
Just my luck to have
such a boring fool as my enemy.

901
01:05:50,606 --> 01:05:52,316
"Tricks"?

902
01:05:53,108 --> 01:05:55,527
Why would I need tricks to face you?

903
01:05:56,111 --> 01:05:57,571
Princia Funnybunny.

904
01:05:58,113 --> 01:06:02,034
A mighty warrior among the Wizard Kings,
whose combat strength

905
01:06:02,117 --> 01:06:04,119
is worth a thousand soldiers!

906
01:06:04,995 --> 01:06:07,998
The records say that you've never lost

907
01:06:08,081 --> 01:06:10,876
in any combat where you were involved.

908
01:06:11,460 --> 01:06:13,587
Why would I rely on some silly tricks

909
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,298
when facing such a foe!

910
01:06:17,090 --> 01:06:19,593
Very well, I take back my words.

911
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:23,555
Legion Magic: Endless Domination!

912
01:06:24,890 --> 01:06:27,226
If you want me to play with you,

913
01:06:27,309 --> 01:06:29,269
then show me your strength first.

914
01:06:35,609 --> 01:06:37,945
A test of strength?
I accept the challenge.

915
01:06:38,737 --> 01:06:42,741
But I hope you don't hold back on me!

916
01:06:55,587 --> 01:06:56,672
Next…

917
01:06:56,755 --> 01:06:58,548
Where are you aiming?

918
01:07:04,805 --> 01:07:08,517
Did you actually think
you managed to lure me in?

919
01:07:09,101 --> 01:07:11,019
Just the opposite, silly you!

920
01:07:11,103 --> 01:07:14,356
I'm the one who lured you here.

921
01:07:14,439 --> 01:07:16,066
The truth is,

922
01:07:16,149 --> 01:07:18,944
we can use the magical power

923
01:07:19,027 --> 01:07:22,322
that's fueling this flying fortress
as our own!

924
01:07:22,906 --> 01:07:24,783
So, as long as I'm in here,

925
01:07:24,866 --> 01:07:28,620
I can replenish my magic endlessly!

926
01:07:32,874 --> 01:07:35,294
And you think you've won just for that?

927
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:36,712
Against us?

928
01:07:37,296 --> 01:07:38,171
"Us"?

929
01:07:39,214 --> 01:07:41,967
Hey, hey, Pretty Boy.

930
01:07:42,050 --> 01:07:44,177
Didn't anyone teach you

931
01:07:44,261 --> 01:07:47,222
that a damsel in distress
should be rescued gently?

932
01:07:48,307 --> 01:07:50,976
I'm a Virgo, you know!

933
01:07:52,519 --> 01:07:54,229
The earlier attack…

934
01:07:55,063 --> 01:07:56,898
This is what he was aiming for.

935
01:07:58,317 --> 01:07:59,443
I'll remember that.

936
01:08:00,277 --> 01:08:01,653
Are you ready to go?

937
01:08:01,737 --> 01:08:04,239
Can't have my subordinates taking risks

938
01:08:04,323 --> 01:08:07,909
without me, the captain,
surpassing my limits first, can I?

939
01:08:07,993 --> 01:08:09,453
Right, you guys?

940
01:08:10,996 --> 01:08:12,998
You don't need to tell me.

941
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:18,420
We will show you the might
of the Magic Knights Squads, here and now!

942
01:08:18,503 --> 01:08:20,422
Yuno! We will back you up!

943
01:08:22,257 --> 01:08:24,301
You focus on attacking!

944
01:08:33,894 --> 01:08:35,145
Uh-huh?

945
01:08:35,687 --> 01:08:38,648
Don't make me yawn,
you nearly dead idiots.

946
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:43,570
These guys here have been kept alive

947
01:08:43,653 --> 01:08:47,699
so that we could suck their magical power
to fuel the fortress.

948
01:08:47,783 --> 01:08:53,038
They have little magical power left.

949
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:54,539
And?

950
01:08:54,623 --> 01:08:57,292
Is your grit going to help
regain your magical power?

951
01:08:58,126 --> 01:09:00,545
Huh? Surpassing limits?

952
01:09:00,629 --> 01:09:03,548
You can't get strong that quickly!

953
01:09:06,301 --> 01:09:09,596
You called yourself Wizard King
when you didn't even know that?

954
01:09:10,514 --> 01:09:11,556
Unbelievable.

955
01:09:13,141 --> 01:09:16,061
Bring it on, bastards!

956
01:09:16,144 --> 01:09:20,107
Flame Magic: Prison Death Scattershot!

957
01:09:44,923 --> 01:09:46,174
Here it is! Grey!

958
01:09:46,925 --> 01:09:49,094
Okay!

959
01:09:49,177 --> 01:09:51,638
Magic Conversion!

960
01:10:08,905 --> 01:10:11,450
Thank you…

961
01:10:11,533 --> 01:10:14,161
I can't use strong magic,

962
01:10:14,244 --> 01:10:16,246
but I can manage this much
without my grimoire…

963
01:10:16,329 --> 01:10:18,457
Looks like we can handle this.

964
01:10:19,082 --> 01:10:19,916
Right.

965
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:23,378
The revived Wizard Kings
and the magic to destroy this kingdom…

966
01:10:23,462 --> 01:10:26,381
If Asta can touch the Imperial Sword
with his Demon-Slayer Sword,

967
01:10:26,465 --> 01:10:27,883
they can all be neutralized.

968
01:10:28,467 --> 01:10:31,553
All we have to do is to stop them
until he can do that!

969
01:10:33,472 --> 01:10:34,806
How pitiful…

970
01:10:36,308 --> 01:10:38,018
I'm saying this for your sake.

971
01:10:38,101 --> 01:10:39,311
Surrender now.

972
01:10:39,394 --> 01:10:44,191
And, please, leave
and go somewhere out of our sight.

973
01:10:45,317 --> 01:10:47,152
That's mighty nice of you.

974
01:10:47,736 --> 01:10:51,740
Isn't it your purpose to kill us off?

975
01:10:51,823 --> 01:10:58,413
If you were nobles and royals
who only think of benefitting themselves,

976
01:10:58,497 --> 01:11:00,248
then I'd have no mercy for you.

977
01:11:00,916 --> 01:11:05,420
But your hearts aren't impure like theirs.

978
01:11:05,962 --> 01:11:06,880
Retreat now!

979
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:09,925
If you promise not to get in our way,

980
01:11:10,008 --> 01:11:11,676
I will let you go.

981
01:11:13,178 --> 01:11:14,679
That means,

982
01:11:14,763 --> 01:11:17,849
"Just shut up and watch
as this country breaks apart," right?

983
01:11:18,600 --> 01:11:19,434
In that case…

984
01:11:20,143 --> 01:11:22,938
We would not retreat even if it kills us!

985
01:11:26,024 --> 01:11:28,777
Being foolish is… pitiful.

986
01:11:30,278 --> 01:11:34,407
Ice Wedge Magic: World End Church.

987
01:11:42,749 --> 01:11:47,587
And here you thought you could beat me
with this level of magical power.

988
01:11:48,213 --> 01:11:49,839
My mana zone allows me

989
01:11:49,923 --> 01:11:53,593
to lower the temperature
of a space to below freezing!

990
01:11:56,304 --> 01:12:01,309
Amateurs won't be able
to even breathe in this space!

991
01:12:05,814 --> 01:12:07,732
Move…

992
01:12:07,816 --> 01:12:09,359
I don't understand.

993
01:12:09,442 --> 01:12:12,737
You were also oppressed by this world.

994
01:12:12,821 --> 01:12:15,740
Why do you reject our ideas?!

995
01:12:15,824 --> 01:12:17,492
Don't underestimate us…

996
01:12:18,326 --> 01:12:21,746
Everyone's giving their all to survive.

997
01:12:21,830 --> 01:12:24,708
Even if it's hard, they're not giving up!

998
01:12:25,333 --> 01:12:30,255
You have no right to take away
the lives of people like that!

999
01:12:32,841 --> 01:12:33,675
Indeed.

1000
01:12:34,759 --> 01:12:37,387
No one has the right to do so.

1001
01:12:38,013 --> 01:12:40,098
And that's why I must do what I must.

1002
01:12:40,807 --> 01:12:43,685
In order to create a world
where those without magic

1003
01:12:43,768 --> 01:12:46,563
and outsiders can smile as they live!

1004
01:12:46,646 --> 01:12:48,773
But that doesn't justify--

1005
01:12:50,275 --> 01:12:53,111
Being weak is also pitiful.

1006
01:12:57,782 --> 01:12:59,993
Legion Magic: Blink Castling.

1007
01:13:05,582 --> 01:13:09,628
It's useless. You will never reach me.

1008
01:13:14,466 --> 01:13:15,884
Go to sleep.

1009
01:13:16,676 --> 01:13:17,886
I refuse.

1010
01:13:18,970 --> 01:13:21,890
I just need to burn everything down.

1011
01:13:22,849 --> 01:13:24,100
Mana Zone…

1012
01:13:24,184 --> 01:13:25,185
Full Release!

1013
01:13:25,977 --> 01:13:27,145
Flame Magic…

1014
01:13:29,064 --> 01:13:30,440
Calidos Brachium…

1015
01:13:31,858 --> 01:13:33,109
Purgatory!

1016
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:40,659
Now!

1017
01:13:41,868 --> 01:13:43,787
Time to play!

1018
01:13:55,215 --> 01:13:58,802
Your name was Mereoleona, was it?

1019
01:13:59,511 --> 01:14:02,138
You made me use my fist.

1020
01:14:02,639 --> 01:14:06,059
You are very interesting.

1021
01:14:20,281 --> 01:14:23,326
It's not often
that I get to use this on someone.

1022
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:26,454
Very good, Mereoleona.

1023
01:14:26,538 --> 01:14:28,581
I will admit it.

1024
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:30,083
You are strong!

1025
01:14:30,709 --> 01:14:34,379
But not as strong as me!

1026
01:14:37,882 --> 01:14:39,384
What are we going to do, Yuno?

1027
01:14:39,467 --> 01:14:41,970
At this rate,
Yami and the others won't last.

1028
01:14:42,053 --> 01:14:42,929
I know!

1029
01:14:51,354 --> 01:14:52,647
Captain Nozel!

1030
01:14:56,109 --> 01:14:58,862
Yuno, don't try to do something you can't.

1031
01:14:59,362 --> 01:15:00,780
You are strong.

1032
01:15:01,489 --> 01:15:04,033
Try and face
what you are capable of right now.

1033
01:15:05,994 --> 01:15:08,371
Don't worry about us.

1034
01:15:18,298 --> 01:15:20,550
Please buy me a little more time!

1035
01:15:24,095 --> 01:15:25,805
I'll finish him with the next blow!

1036
01:15:32,979 --> 01:15:35,732
Hey, hey, beardy macho man!

1037
01:15:35,815 --> 01:15:38,151
Did you run out of energy at the start?

1038
01:15:40,612 --> 01:15:42,447
Your taste in nicknames is horrible!

1039
01:15:44,866 --> 01:15:46,367
No matter how you look at it,

1040
01:15:46,451 --> 01:15:50,038
I'm obviously more of
a "cute and girly" kind of macho!

1041
01:16:23,029 --> 01:16:24,489
Don't you know any other moves?

1042
01:16:32,330 --> 01:16:33,248
This guy…

1043
01:16:33,832 --> 01:16:37,252
He's pouring all his magical power
into this blow!

1044
01:16:46,427 --> 01:16:48,304
You powered your way through after all.

1045
01:16:49,180 --> 01:16:51,641
A rather unrefined move, Pretty Boy!

1046
01:17:02,235 --> 01:17:05,905
Aren't you interesting?!

1047
01:17:20,545 --> 01:17:26,259
So you've been protecting
this land all these years…

1048
01:17:29,053 --> 01:17:30,555
Lemiel.

1049
01:17:30,638 --> 01:17:32,974
The world you envisioned,

1050
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:36,394
I will make it come true.

1051
01:17:38,563 --> 01:17:41,733
Conrad!

1052
01:17:42,817 --> 01:17:46,279
So you've arrived, Asta!

1053
01:17:48,698 --> 01:17:51,367
You were a little too late, Asta.

1054
01:17:54,287 --> 01:17:55,121
This is…

1055
01:17:55,204 --> 01:17:56,122
Stop!

1056
01:17:56,205 --> 01:17:57,624
…the end.

1057
01:18:06,049 --> 01:18:10,470
And a new beginning for this world!

1058
01:18:36,663 --> 01:18:38,414
Give up, Asta.

1059
01:18:38,498 --> 01:18:42,168
I drove the magic of the Imperial Sword
into the singular point.

1060
01:18:42,251 --> 01:18:47,006
No one can stop
the destruction of this kingdom!

1061
01:18:52,637 --> 01:18:54,013
Not yet!

1062
01:18:55,264 --> 01:18:58,184
I'll pull that sword out
and kick your butt!

1063
01:18:58,726 --> 01:19:00,561
I'm really persistent.

1064
01:19:00,645 --> 01:19:03,398
If I decide to do something,
I'll do it even if it kills me!

1065
01:19:03,481 --> 01:19:05,692
It's you who should give up!

1066
01:19:06,401 --> 01:19:10,029
Then you understand me, Asta.

1067
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:17,453
-Never giving up is my magic!
-Never giving up is my magic!

1068
01:19:24,836 --> 01:19:27,964
If someone like you had been around me,

1069
01:19:28,047 --> 01:19:31,217
then my loneliness
may not have been as bad,

1070
01:19:32,927 --> 01:19:34,971
Mereoleona.

1071
01:19:41,769 --> 01:19:42,603
Hey.

1072
01:19:47,108 --> 01:19:48,359
The battle…

1073
01:19:50,945 --> 01:19:52,947
is not over yet!

1074
01:19:57,660 --> 01:19:58,578
Impossible!

1075
01:19:58,661 --> 01:19:59,871
Her power increased?!

1076
01:20:00,788 --> 01:20:01,622
You!

1077
01:20:02,248 --> 01:20:03,624
How can you still move?

1078
01:20:06,419 --> 01:20:07,545
Ugh, Big-sis-leon.

1079
01:20:07,628 --> 01:20:09,213
What's up! Lady Mereoleona!

1080
01:20:09,297 --> 01:20:11,382
Good morning, big sister!

1081
01:20:11,466 --> 01:20:13,676
Good morning, Lady Mereoleona!

1082
01:20:15,053 --> 01:20:15,928
Big sister!

1083
01:20:20,975 --> 01:20:22,185
It's my grit!

1084
01:20:23,811 --> 01:20:25,146
Also,

1085
01:20:25,229 --> 01:20:27,815
if I kick the bucket in a place like this,

1086
01:20:28,608 --> 01:20:32,570
they'll surely laugh at me!

1087
01:20:50,505 --> 01:20:52,215
And one more thing!

1088
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:55,510
Unless I stay the strongest,

1089
01:20:56,636 --> 01:21:01,307
I won't be able to call
a certain someone "my rival"!

1090
01:21:03,893 --> 01:21:07,271
Drawing strength from your comrades…

1091
01:21:07,772 --> 01:21:11,067
That sure is a trick I'll never learn.

1092
01:21:11,651 --> 01:21:12,652
However…

1093
01:21:15,947 --> 01:21:17,824
Well done, Mereoleona.

1094
01:21:18,783 --> 01:21:21,327
To think that I'd lose in a fist fight.

1095
01:21:22,495 --> 01:21:23,663
You just might be

1096
01:21:24,664 --> 01:21:28,126
strong enough to fight me
when I go all out!

1097
01:21:29,627 --> 01:21:33,297
Oh man, you're really strong.

1098
01:21:33,381 --> 01:21:35,842
You even made me use my trump card.

1099
01:21:36,592 --> 01:21:39,345
Had I met you when I was the Wizard King,

1100
01:21:39,428 --> 01:21:42,098
I might have made you my advisers.

1101
01:21:42,181 --> 01:21:43,349
Maybe!

1102
01:21:46,435 --> 01:21:49,188
You are wrong!

1103
01:21:50,773 --> 01:21:52,108
Don't give me that crap.

1104
01:21:52,191 --> 01:21:58,114
No one knows
what's right and what's wrong!

1105
01:21:58,823 --> 01:22:00,491
We're the same as you!

1106
01:22:01,075 --> 01:22:06,372
Conrad and I, we fight for our beliefs!

1107
01:22:09,333 --> 01:22:10,751
I get that!

1108
01:22:10,835 --> 01:22:13,963
In a fight like this,
there's no right or wrong!

1109
01:22:15,756 --> 01:22:17,633
But to protect what matters to us…

1110
01:22:19,343 --> 01:22:21,637
we both plant our feet and fight!

1111
01:22:22,221 --> 01:22:23,222
Combo Spell…

1112
01:22:23,723 --> 01:22:25,183
Dimension Slash!

1113
01:22:25,725 --> 01:22:26,976
Scorching Light!

1114
01:22:41,115 --> 01:22:42,158
I won't lose…

1115
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:46,037
I won't lose to something like this!

1116
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:47,788
That's too bad!

1117
01:22:47,872 --> 01:22:50,374
Asta, I'm borrowing your skill!

1118
01:22:51,375 --> 01:22:55,046
I hate losing more than anything too!

1119
01:23:11,812 --> 01:23:13,564
Whatever.

1120
01:23:14,148 --> 01:23:17,318
I don't care about preserving
magical powers for the fortress anymore.

1121
01:23:18,194 --> 01:23:24,075
I'll use all my power to crush you all!

1122
01:23:31,874 --> 01:23:33,668
Reconsider, Asta.

1123
01:23:35,044 --> 01:23:39,090
This crazy world is not worth protecting.

1124
01:23:39,924 --> 01:23:43,844
Let's build a new world together!

1125
01:23:48,432 --> 01:23:51,018
I don't care about your new world!

1126
01:23:51,686 --> 01:23:54,605
My dream is to become the Wizard King!

1127
01:23:55,273 --> 01:23:56,107
Nonsense.

1128
01:23:56,941 --> 01:24:00,319
Becoming a Wizard King in this world
will change nothing.

1129
01:24:02,071 --> 01:24:03,197
That's right.

1130
01:24:03,281 --> 01:24:04,490
Nothing…

1131
01:24:43,738 --> 01:24:46,324
All routes are shut down.

1132
01:24:47,658 --> 01:24:50,161
Your sword will never reach me.

1133
01:24:50,995 --> 01:24:52,413
No matter how you struggle,

1134
01:24:52,496 --> 01:24:54,749
this is your limit.

1135
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,669
I'll say it one last time.

1136
01:24:59,420 --> 01:25:01,088
Come with us, Asta.

1137
01:25:03,090 --> 01:25:05,634
You can be my successor.

1138
01:25:06,385 --> 01:25:08,721
Become the Wizard King in the new world.

1139
01:25:15,561 --> 01:25:17,688
Not in a million years!

1140
01:25:17,772 --> 01:25:20,941
Someone can't turn you
into the Wizard King.

1141
01:25:21,025 --> 01:25:23,569
You become one on your own merits!

1142
01:25:23,652 --> 01:25:26,530
And there is a way!

1143
01:25:28,240 --> 01:25:29,617
If there isn't,

1144
01:25:31,285 --> 01:25:32,912
I'll make one!

1145
01:25:37,458 --> 01:25:42,296
I've always been told
to surpass my limits!

1146
01:25:49,136 --> 01:25:51,972
That was a good hit.

1147
01:25:52,765 --> 01:25:54,809
So I didn't parry and took it.

1148
01:25:55,893 --> 01:25:58,229
Along with your ambition.

1149
01:26:00,314 --> 01:26:02,817
But playtime is over, Asta.

1150
01:26:03,484 --> 01:26:05,986
If we can't walk the same path together,

1151
01:26:06,070 --> 01:26:08,572
then there is no point
in holding back anymore.

1152
01:26:08,656 --> 01:26:10,032
Asta.

1153
01:26:10,116 --> 01:26:16,080
The biggest reason I asked you to join us
is not because of your power.

1154
01:26:16,747 --> 01:26:19,917
Nor is it because
you were in the same boat as me.

1155
01:26:20,918 --> 01:26:23,963
I wanted you,
who has the same ambition as me,

1156
01:26:24,046 --> 01:26:26,006
to be rewarded!

1157
01:26:27,258 --> 01:26:30,803
But I was not able
to open your eyes to the truth.

1158
01:26:32,346 --> 01:26:33,597
How regrettable…

1159
01:27:14,972 --> 01:27:16,891
I'm neutralizing him with my Anti-Magic,

1160
01:27:17,725 --> 01:27:18,893
but I can't keep up!

1161
01:27:23,481 --> 01:27:24,732
Now!

1162
01:27:28,360 --> 01:27:29,778
I've been waiting

1163
01:27:30,362 --> 01:27:33,782
for the moment you'd take it easy
and drop your guard!

1164
01:27:33,866 --> 01:27:36,285
Exploding Fireball!

1165
01:27:37,495 --> 01:27:40,998
From there, Flame Bondage Formation!

1166
01:27:43,792 --> 01:27:45,169
Full Reflection!

1167
01:27:52,259 --> 01:27:54,345
Ice Wedge Magic…

1168
01:27:54,887 --> 01:27:56,889
World End Martyr!

1169
01:28:04,230 --> 01:28:05,814
This is what…

1170
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:09,109
"taking it easy" means!

1171
01:28:12,655 --> 01:28:15,950
You learn something new every day,
don't you, young one?

1172
01:28:17,326 --> 01:28:18,953
Thanks for nothing, old fart!

1173
01:28:19,954 --> 01:28:21,705
Hurry up, Asta!

1174
01:28:21,789 --> 01:28:24,583
Our magic won't last much longer!

1175
01:28:25,793 --> 01:28:27,586
Black Hurricane!

1176
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:33,342
It's admirable how you can
keep your spirits up,

1177
01:28:33,425 --> 01:28:35,594
but your movements are getting slow!

1178
01:28:39,223 --> 01:28:41,350
One Horn Bull Thrust!

1179
01:28:47,940 --> 01:28:50,734
No matter how much you struggle,

1180
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:53,737
this gap between us will never be filled!

1181
01:28:54,947 --> 01:28:57,366
This is the power of the Wizard King!

1182
01:29:04,123 --> 01:29:05,499
I will never…

1183
01:29:06,125 --> 01:29:10,796
acknowledge a guy like you
as the Wizard King!

1184
01:29:11,964 --> 01:29:15,384
Crap, if I let my guard down,
my Black form will become undone.

1185
01:29:15,884 --> 01:29:19,013
I need to land a hit
with everything I've got left!

1186
01:29:19,096 --> 01:29:22,349
Stop seeing your dreams
in the Wizard King!

1187
01:29:22,433 --> 01:29:25,019
No one, not even the first Wizard King,

1188
01:29:25,102 --> 01:29:29,023
has been able to bring
revolution to this kingdom.

1189
01:29:29,106 --> 01:29:31,817
In fact, far from changing the nation,

1190
01:29:31,900 --> 01:29:35,279
Julius ended up getting beaten
by the Elves in the earlier war,

1191
01:29:35,362 --> 01:29:39,283
and the Clover Kingdom
almost faced its doom.

1192
01:29:39,366 --> 01:29:42,411
They can't protect anything.
They can't change anything.

1193
01:29:42,494 --> 01:29:45,914
Wizard Kings are utterly useless!

1194
01:29:47,041 --> 01:29:48,417
That's not true…

1195
01:29:51,170 --> 01:29:56,300
The current Wizard King protected
all the citizens in exchange for his life!

1196
01:29:56,842 --> 01:29:58,552
Same with the first Wizard King!

1197
01:29:58,636 --> 01:30:01,930
He protected everyone
at the expense of his life,

1198
01:30:02,014 --> 01:30:04,183
and even after that,
for hundreds of years,

1199
01:30:04,767 --> 01:30:07,061
he kept on sleeping

1200
01:30:07,936 --> 01:30:12,232
so he could help us and this country!

1201
01:30:16,487 --> 01:30:22,451
Clover leaves each represent
faith, hope, and love.

1202
01:30:23,410 --> 01:30:26,121
Within the fourth leaf dwells good luck.

1203
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:30,542
In the fifth leaf resides the devil.

1204
01:30:34,046 --> 01:30:36,256
Is he about to die again?

1205
01:30:36,840 --> 01:30:38,884
Man, what a piece of work.

1206
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:43,097
I guess I'll get the payment
in a lump sum later.

1207
01:30:46,809 --> 01:30:48,310
You became the Wizard King

1208
01:30:48,394 --> 01:30:52,356
because a lot of people acknowledged you,
didn't you?

1209
01:30:53,190 --> 01:30:56,485
Betraying those people
makes you unfit to be one!

1210
01:30:57,569 --> 01:30:59,196
I won't acknowledge you!

1211
01:31:01,156 --> 01:31:05,285
Wizard Kings inspire people!

1212
01:31:05,953 --> 01:31:09,248
They can be someone's hopes and dreams!

1213
01:31:09,331 --> 01:31:11,375
They are not useless at all!

1214
01:31:13,836 --> 01:31:17,756
You don't understand
the true nature of this country yet.

1215
01:31:18,424 --> 01:31:21,844
The discrimination and prejudice
rampant in this country

1216
01:31:21,927 --> 01:31:25,514
have crushed people's dreams
and hopes again and again!

1217
01:31:25,597 --> 01:31:29,893
Unless we make a fundamental change,
this country will not change!

1218
01:31:30,477 --> 01:31:32,938
That's not for you to decide!

1219
01:31:33,856 --> 01:31:34,732
Right now,

1220
01:31:34,815 --> 01:31:37,818
regardless of their social status,
everyone from peasants to royals

1221
01:31:37,901 --> 01:31:41,572
is working hard together
to make this a better country!

1222
01:31:42,114 --> 01:31:43,907
So don't get in our way!

1223
01:31:43,991 --> 01:31:47,161
A country cannot change
with such simple measures!

1224
01:31:47,244 --> 01:31:49,747
Don't get in my way!

1225
01:31:54,752 --> 01:31:57,796
What the hell?
I'm not sure what's going on,

1226
01:31:57,880 --> 01:32:01,216
but I feel like
I finally got to talk to the real you.

1227
01:32:02,384 --> 01:32:03,552
Shut up.

1228
01:32:04,261 --> 01:32:09,475
I'm no longer interested in listening to
pipe dreams from a kid who knows nothing!

1229
01:32:14,062 --> 01:32:17,357
Crap! My Black form is coming undone!

1230
01:32:17,441 --> 01:32:20,861
True, there was a time
when I trusted the country and its people

1231
01:32:20,944 --> 01:32:26,116
and tried to bring changes
to the Clover Kingdom as the Wizard King.

1232
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,869
But people betray you.

1233
01:32:28,952 --> 01:32:31,371
You must know what that's like.

1234
01:32:31,955 --> 01:32:35,501
Just because a small portion
of your community changed,

1235
01:32:36,084 --> 01:32:39,755
do you seriously think
that a whole country will change?

1236
01:32:40,589 --> 01:32:42,090
It's not that they change.

1237
01:32:42,591 --> 01:32:44,760
It's that we bring change together!

1238
01:32:44,843 --> 01:32:46,512
The world you're trying to create

1239
01:32:46,595 --> 01:32:51,099
is an egotistical world
where you're the only one who's laughing!

1240
01:32:51,600 --> 01:32:55,020
I want to laugh with everyone.
I want to become happy with everyone!

1241
01:32:55,896 --> 01:33:00,150
I will change this country with everyone!

1242
01:33:00,234 --> 01:33:02,486
A country where everyone who lives there

1243
01:33:02,569 --> 01:33:05,739
respects each other
and laughs with one another!

1244
01:33:05,823 --> 01:33:09,743
That's what I'm going to create!

1245
01:33:20,754 --> 01:33:22,923
My magic is back!

1246
01:33:26,260 --> 01:33:27,636
Noelle!

1247
01:33:32,516 --> 01:33:35,561
Water Creation Magic: Valkyrie Armor!

1248
01:33:35,644 --> 01:33:37,312
Yeah!

1249
01:33:37,396 --> 01:33:38,730
What a futile struggle.

1250
01:33:39,231 --> 01:33:42,901
You defying us only pushes us
away from an ideal world!

1251
01:33:43,402 --> 01:33:45,112
Why can't you see that?!

1252
01:33:47,155 --> 01:33:49,324
An ideal world

1253
01:33:49,408 --> 01:33:51,910
isn't something that's forced upon you.

1254
01:33:52,411 --> 01:33:54,413
It's something you earn yourself!

1255
01:33:55,414 --> 01:33:57,165
Noelle! Look at me!

1256
01:33:59,418 --> 01:34:00,586
Mirror Magic…

1257
01:34:01,295 --> 01:34:02,921
Mirror Brigade!

1258
01:34:05,799 --> 01:34:08,594
I used to resent this world as well.

1259
01:34:09,177 --> 01:34:11,763
I couldn't learn to control
my magical powers

1260
01:34:11,847 --> 01:34:13,765
and was abandoned by my family.

1261
01:34:13,849 --> 01:34:16,977
I thought I was alone in the world.

1262
01:34:18,270 --> 01:34:20,898
But I now have friends

1263
01:34:21,815 --> 01:34:24,526
who make me feel I belong!

1264
01:34:25,068 --> 01:34:26,945
They accept me with my shortcomings,

1265
01:34:28,196 --> 01:34:32,743
and they stay right beside me
as we move forward!

1266
01:34:33,827 --> 01:34:35,370
Combo Spell…

1267
01:34:36,204 --> 01:34:37,873
Mirror Meteo…

1268
01:34:41,168 --> 01:34:42,002
Dragon!

1269
01:34:45,589 --> 01:34:47,758
Magic Conversion!

1270
01:34:47,841 --> 01:34:49,843
Ice to Water!

1271
01:34:51,178 --> 01:34:52,638
Right here, right now…

1272
01:34:54,473 --> 01:34:55,641
Fate Manipulation…

1273
01:34:55,724 --> 01:34:57,017
Absolute Evasion!

1274
01:34:57,100 --> 01:34:59,811
Spatial Magic: Fallen Angel's Wingbeat!

1275
01:35:00,729 --> 01:35:03,398
I will surpass my limits!

1276
01:35:07,235 --> 01:35:08,528
Jeez.

1277
01:35:08,612 --> 01:35:10,155
Just go already!

1278
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:12,407
Leave it to me!

1279
01:35:16,495 --> 01:35:18,664
The world can be changed.

1280
01:35:19,289 --> 01:35:21,959
Fate can be manipulated!

1281
01:35:23,293 --> 01:35:26,129
I will not let you destroy

1282
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:32,928
even the possibility of it!

1283
01:35:49,403 --> 01:35:51,154
How about that?

1284
01:35:51,238 --> 01:35:54,908
If that's not enough for you,
then I can do this all day.

1285
01:35:56,493 --> 01:35:57,327
But…

1286
01:36:00,998 --> 01:36:03,792
Start over with us, together.

1287
01:36:05,210 --> 01:36:06,712
I don't mean to boast,

1288
01:36:07,295 --> 01:36:10,048
but I can't do anything
without everyone's help!

1289
01:36:10,799 --> 01:36:13,260
I nearly died many times,

1290
01:36:13,343 --> 01:36:16,847
but I was able to come this far
with their help!

1291
01:36:16,930 --> 01:36:18,098
Shut up!

1292
01:36:22,102 --> 01:36:25,147
I want to create a world where everyone
can laugh together in a way

1293
01:36:25,230 --> 01:36:27,733
that everyone can accept.

1294
01:36:29,317 --> 01:36:32,571
If you have to kill
a lot of people to create it,

1295
01:36:33,071 --> 01:36:35,824
no one will accept that!

1296
01:37:06,521 --> 01:37:08,774
You… What is your name?

1297
01:37:08,857 --> 01:37:11,276
Noelle. Noelle Silva.

1298
01:37:11,359 --> 01:37:13,779
From the royal house of Silva…

1299
01:37:14,738 --> 01:37:15,572
I see.

1300
01:37:16,782 --> 01:37:18,450
You're a good girl, Noelle.

1301
01:37:19,451 --> 01:37:23,205
You're a royal, and yet
you can empathize with the weak.

1302
01:37:24,372 --> 01:37:27,793
If a person like you exists,
then surely this world…

1303
01:37:30,962 --> 01:37:32,798
Hey, hey, hey…

1304
01:37:33,965 --> 01:37:36,551
Are you serious, Conrad?

1305
01:37:38,678 --> 01:37:41,056
I can still fight!

1306
01:37:42,432 --> 01:37:43,600
Me too.

1307
01:37:44,935 --> 01:37:48,480
But it looks like
it's my turn to go to sleep.

1308
01:37:49,815 --> 01:37:51,942
It was a lot of fun.

1309
01:37:56,905 --> 01:37:57,739
I did it…

1310
01:37:58,365 --> 01:37:59,282
I did it!

1311
01:37:59,866 --> 01:38:00,700
Everyone!

1312
01:38:02,285 --> 01:38:04,162
Not… yet…

1313
01:38:06,373 --> 01:38:07,958
Not yet…

1314
01:38:10,794 --> 01:38:16,216
It's a forbidden spell
that's activated in exchange for my life.

1315
01:38:17,717 --> 01:38:19,761
Doom's Gate.

1316
01:38:28,854 --> 01:38:31,648
I will not give up.

1317
01:38:31,731 --> 01:38:33,733
I will not give up, Asta.

1318
01:38:49,124 --> 01:38:52,627
I will… not give up either.

1319
01:38:53,920 --> 01:38:56,631
I'm going to be the Wizard King.

1320
01:38:57,674 --> 01:39:01,887
In order to be the Wizard King…

1321
01:39:03,305 --> 01:39:04,639
I am!

1322
01:39:05,307 --> 01:39:08,476
Right here!

1323
01:39:09,728 --> 01:39:11,146
Asta!

1324
01:39:17,235 --> 01:39:19,029
Asta, take this.

1325
01:39:21,489 --> 01:39:22,449
The Wizard King!

1326
01:39:23,241 --> 01:39:25,410
You won't need an explanation.

1327
01:39:26,119 --> 01:39:27,913
That sword will show you.

1328
01:39:28,705 --> 01:39:30,248
The future of this nation…

1329
01:39:30,332 --> 01:39:31,166
The space…

1330
01:39:32,083 --> 01:39:33,251
…is in your hands.

1331
01:39:38,506 --> 01:39:39,341
I feel it.

1332
01:39:40,217 --> 01:39:42,886
This is everyone's power!

1333
01:39:43,929 --> 01:39:45,347
Their hopes and dreams!

1334
01:39:49,935 --> 01:39:50,977
I feel everyone…

1335
01:39:52,020 --> 01:39:53,355
everyone is there!

1336
01:39:55,523 --> 01:39:57,943
Master Nacht, please stop it!

1337
01:39:58,693 --> 01:40:03,448
You've been working non-stop
since you got back to the Clover Kingdom!

1338
01:40:04,157 --> 01:40:08,411
If you give away your magical power
on top of that, you'll pass out!

1339
01:40:08,495 --> 01:40:10,705
I don't mind passing out

1340
01:40:12,207 --> 01:40:16,127
if that means someone
who's doing the right thing gets rewarded.

1341
01:40:19,214 --> 01:40:20,173
Right here…

1342
01:40:20,882 --> 01:40:21,716
Right now…

1343
01:40:23,051 --> 01:40:24,052
Let's all…

1344
01:40:27,305 --> 01:40:30,308
surpass our limits.

1345
01:40:34,854 --> 01:40:35,981
The Imperial Sword?

1346
01:40:36,773 --> 01:40:38,775
What is going on?

1347
01:40:42,320 --> 01:40:44,239
Go, Asta!

1348
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,342
With this…

1349
01:41:14,811 --> 01:41:19,024
You bastard, how badly
do you want to destroy this country?!

1350
01:41:19,107 --> 01:41:21,067
Oh, you have no idea!

1351
01:41:21,151 --> 01:41:22,527
It needs to be destroyed!

1352
01:41:23,320 --> 01:41:25,363
This nation is rotten to its core.

1353
01:41:25,864 --> 01:41:29,409
The very foundation of it
needs to be destroyed.

1354
01:41:29,492 --> 01:41:34,289
I have to save everyone. I must!

1355
01:41:34,372 --> 01:41:39,586
Who exactly do you mean by "everyone"?!

1356
01:41:39,669 --> 01:41:43,381
All those who are unreasonably oppressed!

1357
01:41:43,465 --> 01:41:45,759
For their sake, I…

1358
01:41:57,729 --> 01:41:58,813
I will…

1359
01:42:00,190 --> 01:42:01,649
I will…

1360
01:42:05,779 --> 01:42:08,323
Even if you're a peasant
or don't have magical power,

1361
01:42:08,406 --> 01:42:10,825
you can be stronger
than anyone else in the world.

1362
01:42:11,659 --> 01:42:14,329
You can be everyone's hope!

1363
01:42:14,913 --> 01:42:17,749
And to prove it…

1364
01:42:21,836 --> 01:42:22,921
I am going to be

1365
01:42:23,463 --> 01:42:25,090
the Wizard King!

1366
01:42:51,866 --> 01:42:55,203
Did I… lose?

1367
01:42:57,080 --> 01:42:59,040
Then why…

1368
01:42:59,124 --> 01:43:02,335
why do I feel so at ease?

1369
01:43:08,133 --> 01:43:10,260
Now I see it.

1370
01:43:11,428 --> 01:43:14,514
Asta. Become the Wizard King.

1371
01:43:14,597 --> 01:43:21,146
Share that warm world of yours
with every citizen in this nation.

1372
01:43:22,147 --> 01:43:25,150
Never giving up is your magic.

1373
01:43:25,650 --> 01:43:26,818
I know you can…

1374
01:43:30,155 --> 01:43:31,573
You all…

1375
01:43:43,251 --> 01:43:45,086
I see.

1376
01:44:07,901 --> 01:44:09,486
Cheerful and honest,

1377
01:44:10,069 --> 01:44:13,114
he knew how to empathize with the peasant.

1378
01:44:13,781 --> 01:44:18,536
Conrad used to be
a strong, kind man like Asta.

1379
01:44:19,704 --> 01:44:22,332
But he was framed by the royalists,

1380
01:44:22,415 --> 01:44:25,627
and ever since his squad
and his wife were slaughtered,

1381
01:44:26,252 --> 01:44:27,837
he changed.

1382
01:44:30,256 --> 01:44:31,299
Asta.

1383
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:33,134
Thank you for stopping him.

1384
01:44:34,677 --> 01:44:39,182
Why was I able to use
the Imperial Sword at the end?

1385
01:44:39,265 --> 01:44:40,141
What do you mean?

1386
01:44:40,225 --> 01:44:43,645
When I hit the Imperial Sword
with my Demon-Slayer Sword,

1387
01:44:43,728 --> 01:44:46,356
the magic of the Imperial Sword
must've been neutralized.

1388
01:44:47,232 --> 01:44:48,441
So I was wondering…

1389
01:44:50,318 --> 01:44:52,320
Well, that's because…

1390
01:44:56,491 --> 01:44:58,826
Generations of Wizard Kings…

1391
01:45:01,579 --> 01:45:05,833
…generations of Wizard Kings
lent you their miraculous power.

1392
01:45:05,917 --> 01:45:09,170
Wow, that sounds so cool!

1393
01:45:09,254 --> 01:45:11,589
Silly, he's teasing you.

1394
01:45:11,673 --> 01:45:12,966
That's not true!

1395
01:45:13,049 --> 01:45:15,385
Generations of Wizard Kings.

1396
01:45:15,468 --> 01:45:19,806
The clovers responsible for the future
of this kingdom are growing up nicely.

1397
01:45:19,889 --> 01:45:22,725
-You making fun of Prince Lemiel?
-How about it, Asta?

1398
01:45:23,518 --> 01:45:25,395
The Wizard King is incredible, right?

1399
01:45:25,478 --> 01:45:26,646
I knew that, sir!

1400
01:45:26,729 --> 01:45:29,732
And one day,
I'll be that incredible myself.

1401
01:45:30,316 --> 01:45:31,859
I will become the Wizard King!

1402
01:49:31,307 --> 01:49:33,100
Don't you be slacking here.

1403
01:49:33,184 --> 01:49:35,478
I worked my butt off, you know?!

1404
01:49:39,440 --> 01:49:41,275
The place was a total shambles,

1405
01:49:41,359 --> 01:49:44,362
but it looks like things might be
restored sooner than I thought.

1406
01:49:44,445 --> 01:49:45,488
Yeah.

1407
01:49:50,284 --> 01:49:52,995
Conrad was the Wizard King, too, huh?

1408
01:49:54,747 --> 01:49:55,581
Ouch!

1409
01:49:56,749 --> 01:49:57,583
Not a chance.

1410
01:49:59,877 --> 01:50:00,711
You're right!

1411
01:50:02,380 --> 01:50:04,507
I'm going to be the Wizard King, anyway.

1412
01:50:04,590 --> 01:50:05,925
No, I will!

1413
01:50:06,008 --> 01:50:07,510
I'm going to be the Wizard King!

1414
01:50:08,094 --> 01:50:10,179
-Can't hear you.
-Don't ignore me!

1415
01:50:10,263 --> 01:50:11,889
Wanna go?

1416
01:50:11,973 --> 01:50:13,975
The Triumph was canceled,

1417
01:50:14,058 --> 01:50:17,019
but you and me gotta settle this match!

1418
01:50:18,437 --> 01:50:19,522
Not a chance.

1419
01:50:27,113 --> 01:50:29,824
I'm going to be the Wizard King!
