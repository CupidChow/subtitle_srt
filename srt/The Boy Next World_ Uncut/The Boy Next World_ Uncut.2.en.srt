1
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:11,970
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

2
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:15,120
If someone suddenly told you
he’s from a parallel world

3
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:15,960
would you believe him?

4
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,410
And he knew everything

5
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:19,560
from the room I live in
to what I eat for breakfast.

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,140
But I’ve never really
crossed paths with him before.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,540
You've never met him,
or you just didn't notice?

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:28,020
You and me, being a couple?

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,210
If he doesn’t know
me here, I’ll start over.

10
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,470
I’m going to be your boyfriend.

11
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:37,890
Please let me make a move on you.

12
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:04,670
Ai Cir, what the hell are you doing?

13
00:01:05,069 --> 00:01:06,030
Where’s Phukan?

14
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,430
What are you talking about?

15
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,100
I’ll go get the doctor.

16
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:12,850
Phu.

17
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:15,580
Phukan, my boyfriend.

18
00:01:16,180 --> 00:01:17,200
Listen to me, Ai Cir.

19
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,760
You got hit by a car.
You’re confused right now.

20
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,120
I’ve known you my whole life,
and you don’t have a boyfriend.

21
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,970
You’ve never had one.

22
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:28,340
I’m asking where Phukan is!

23
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:35,539
I don’t know.

24
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,009
I’ll go get the doctor.

25
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,220
If you’re an ordinary person
who’s always lived an ordinary life...

26
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,210
I’m telling you, I know
exactly how that felt.

27
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:43,200
I was no different from anyone else

28
00:02:43,950 --> 00:02:46,210
graduating from high school
and getting into college.

29
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,760
Waking up late, running late for class.

30
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,230
Cramming the night before exams.

31
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,560
Copying homework from friends.

32
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:56,570
Using AI to help with assignments.

33
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,000
Hey. Who's that?

34
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,760
Fighting with friends
and making up afterward.

35
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:12,920
And I thought I’d live that
simple life to the end of my days.

36
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:25,220
Until someone knocked
my door and told me...

37
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:31,650
he was from a parallel world.

38
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,000
EP II: The Identity of the Stranger

39
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:30,230
Please let me make a move on you.

40
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,280
Gosh, what should I do?

41
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:58,090
Forget it. Whatever will be, will be.

42
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:17,320
I know it sounds crazy

43
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:21,370
but I’m about to tell you the chaotic
story of my life from here on.

44
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,390
Phu.

45
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:30,930
Are you okay?

46
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,030
No.

47
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:35,840
I keep running into P’ Cir
wherever I go lately.

48
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:38,480
Ai Jin says I just didn’t notice

49
00:06:38,830 --> 00:06:41,150
but I never ran into him before this.

50
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:42,590
Tee, think about it.

51
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:46,490
I mean, how could someone like me
have a chance to run into P’ Cir?

52
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:48,730
But it’s been like that
for the past few days now.

53
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:50,409
I’ve been wearing the lucky color

54
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,400
and hanging this doll
exactly as the books say.

55
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:55,040
But I don’t know why
everything is so chaotic.

56
00:06:55,550 --> 00:06:58,330
I think he likes you.

57
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:00,790
No way. Impossible.

58
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,600
A guy like P’ Cir likes me?

59
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,820
Impossible.
That’s never going to happen.

60
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:08,050
Even if the world ends,
it’s still impossible.

61
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,060
How many times have you said no, Phu?

62
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,520
So how do you explain P’ Cir’s actions?

63
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:16,050
Everyone knows that
he's totally the type

64
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:18,100
who doesn’t care about anyone.

65
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:19,460
Super introverted.

66
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,350
A handsome who’s quiet,
withdrawn, with walls built around him.

67
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:26,960
Anyone trying to get through
would just hit those walls.

68
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:28,110
And what’s this?

69
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:30,670
He waited around just to give you stuff?

70
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:34,340
Trust me, P’ Cir likes you.

71
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:36,460
That’s not true.

72
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:43,220
Tee, look at Phu.
He doesn’t believe me.

73
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:48,000
So why do you think
there’s no way he’d like you?

74
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,370
Because I’m the least
interesting person in the group.

75
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,350
Huh?

76
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:57,159
You see, Ai Achi is the campus
prince and Jin is super cool.

77
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,470
You’re the campus belle and a cheerleader.

78
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:01,070
And you’re a total package.

79
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,100
If anyone’s gonna be liked,
it’s gotta be you guys.

80
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,390
Not me.

81
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:12,270
Phu, you seriously don’t
realize how cute you are?

82
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:15,080
It wouldn’t be surprising if he likes you.

83
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,960
But didn’t he get hit by a car?

84
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:25,260
His brain might’ve...
you know, been affected.

85
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,520
Hello.

86
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,090
It’s me.

87
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,390
Hey!

88
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:40,419
How did you get my number?

89
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:42,650
Because I’m your boyfriend.

90
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:47,550
Please don’t joke around.

91
00:08:47,840 --> 00:08:48,940
I never joke around.

92
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:51,670
Are you scared?

93
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,360
Am I crossing the line?

94
00:08:56,210 --> 00:09:00,180
I’m not scared. I’m just… surprised.

95
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,310
So why are you calling me?

96
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:05,210
I have something to tell you.

97
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,540
What is it?

98
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,730
Miss you.

99
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,360
That’s all I wanted to say.
Study hard, okay?

100
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,690
Is it P’ Cir?

101
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:19,530
What did he say?

102
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,300
Nalin, please tell me there’s
no such thing as parallel worlds.

103
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:27,970
Like Marvel, Dr. Strange,
Earth-66, or something like that.

104
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:29,160
They aren’t real, right?

105
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,820
What? What parallel worlds?

106
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:33,870
I know right? How could it be possible?

107
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,410
If they do exist, then this
P’ Cir isn’t the P’ Cir we know.

108
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,450
He's another P’ Cir, that’s
why he knows everything.

109
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,540
Even though I’m into
all this spiritual stuff

110
00:09:41,570 --> 00:09:43,240
I still can’t bring myself to believe it.

111
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:44,890
And he said he missed me…

112
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,720
- Miss you?
- Really?

113
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,870
P’ Cir said he missed you?

114
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:55,280
Well… I... I need to pee.
I’ll go pee first.

115
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:55,950
Hey!

116
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:00,240
I wanna know what’s inside.

117
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,500
Sweets.

118
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,400
Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there?

119
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:02,060
Damn it, Ai Rome,
I’m soaked because of you!

120
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,960
The fuck? Are you a dog or something?

121
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:09,350
Why so serious?

122
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:12,050
You’re yelling at me like I got you soaked.

123
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,710
What? You think I can just magically
make the rain or storm happen?

124
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:17,360
You’re making no sense.

125
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,430
Damn, cursing at me like I’m the rain god.

126
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:23,380
Watch out, or lightning’s
gonna hit you right on the head.

127
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,130
More like your head!

128
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:26,820
How could it not be your fault?

129
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:30,100
I shouldn’t have gone
to buy fish food with you.

130
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,160
Damn, I thought it’d be a small bag

131
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,770
but it turned out to be this huge!

132
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:36,040
Wrong, you idiot. Only this big.

133
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:36,750
Oh.

134
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:41,430
Seriously, are you raising fish
to sell at the market or something?

135
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,450
Bastard.

136
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,760
It took forever to drop off the fish
food at your place and come back.

137
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:46,930
And now look! It’s pouring!

138
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:48,510
Don’t you dare look down on my babies.

139
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,340
My koi are worth hundreds
of thousands each!

140
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:56,220
- You’re not making any sense. I’m out.
- You’re one to talk.

141
00:11:56,290 --> 00:11:57,070
Bastard.

142
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,700
You're talking crap.

143
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:05,400
Wait, Ai Cir, where are you going?
Class is about to start.

144
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,060
Is it raining hard outside?

145
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:09,890
Can’t you really tell?

146
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,890
And where are you going?

147
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,210
Phu always forgets his umbrella.

148
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:19,160
His class should be over now.
I’ll go give him the umbrella.

149
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,400
Hey wait! But the prof’s almost here!

150
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,180
You’re gonna skip class like this?

151
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:29,150
Come on, just let him go.
It’s his life, you know.

152
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:30,570
You’re being way too nosy.

153
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,240
It’s not like I want to
stick my nose in his life.

154
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,520
But think about it.

155
00:12:38,020 --> 00:12:42,490
If he forgets to go to the hospital
today, who are they gonna call?

156
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,980
Sir Isaac Newton?

157
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,970
Isaac Newton my ass!

158
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:49,900
Of course they’re gonna call you.

159
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,950
Don’t ask a stupid question
when you already know.

160
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,470
Not now, please. Not now.

161
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,170
I don’t have a ride.

162
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:11,670
Mr. Angel, can I please have
an umbrella fall right in front of me?

163
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,590
I promise I’ll return it to
the exact spot when I’m done.

164
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,650
Ugh, I’m gonna end up
like a soaked puppy again.

165
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:55,940
Was I too late?

166
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,410
How did you get here?

167
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,060
You forgot an umbrella again.

168
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:10,300
Yes, I did. But how did you know?

169
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,100
I won’t ask anymore.

170
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,150
I’ve been asking that question
so much lately, it’s become a habit.

171
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:19,190
I’m not curious anymore.

172
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,170
So… why are you all soaked?
You have an umbrella.

173
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,790
I just found out it was
raining, so I rushed over.

174
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:33,600
Here, let me help.

175
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,960
Sorry, it’s a habit.

176
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,880
Do you always do this?

177
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:46,150
I mean, carry things for me

178
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,980
bring me an umbrella,
and keep helping me.

179
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:52,420
‘Phu.’

180
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,830
Yes?

181
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
Not ‘me’.

182
00:14:56,830 --> 00:14:58,290
Can you refer to yourself as ‘Phu’?

183
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:01,200
No way.

184
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:04,710
Why are you laughing?

185
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,110
You’re still the same.

186
00:15:24,900 --> 00:15:25,900
Are you saying…

187
00:15:27,890 --> 00:15:29,550
I sound like Phukan from the other world?

188
00:15:30,660 --> 00:15:31,700
You believe me now?

189
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:34,540
I don’t know.

190
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,530
If I don’t believe you,
then it means you’re crazy.

191
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,350
But since I don’t want you to be crazy

192
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,830
I’ll try to make myself believe you.

193
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:45,840
And what if I say yes?

194
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:49,400
What if I tell you that you don’t
want to refer to yourself as Phu

195
00:15:49,430 --> 00:15:51,380
but in the end, you will?

196
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,660
I think we need to talk.

197
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:15,970
If I guess the passcode correctly...

198
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:19,930
will you refer to yourself as Phu?

199
00:16:22,550 --> 00:16:24,260
Don't you think I could be scared of you?

200
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,930
Sorry, I got too ahead of myself.

201
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:40,990
So tell me, what passcode did I set?

202
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,290
Can I really answer that?

203
00:16:43,790 --> 00:16:45,650
Of course. I’m asking, aren’t I?

204
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,960
You're as cute as ever,
always so kind to me.

205
00:16:50,330 --> 00:16:51,340
P’ Cir.

206
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:53,920
The passcode.

207
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,420
It’s your dad’s birthday.

208
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,310
Now, can you finally tell…

209
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,440
Phu

210
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:23,410
whether you always carry things
for Phu like this in that world?

211
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:25,940
Phu.

212
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:30,170
Well, you guessed the code right,
so I’m just doing what I promised.

213
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,700
Please come in.
We have a lot to talk about.

214
00:17:51,870 --> 00:17:52,860
P’ Cir!

215
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:56,240
Phu, I've missed you
so much, I’m going crazy.

216
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:58,640
Please let go of me.

217
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,390
You haven't changed at all.

218
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:03,710
You're still the person I know.

219
00:18:04,630 --> 00:18:05,850
You care about everyone.

220
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:11,230
It may seem like... I'm out of my mind.

221
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:17,170
Anyone else would have yelled
at me by now, but you still care.

222
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:23,230
When I woke up, I thought
I was really going insane.

223
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:24,500
Phu.

224
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:34,240
Everyone told me that
we don’t know each other.

225
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,340
That you don’t know me.

226
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,520
You’ve been going on about dating
Nong Phukan since you woke up

227
00:18:40,590 --> 00:18:43,580
but you’ve never even spoken to him!

228
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,730
I don’t want to scare you

229
00:18:47,290 --> 00:18:51,760
but I don’t know what to do
to make you believe me.

230
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:56,650
P’ Cir, let go.

231
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:03,100
I’m sorry.

232
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,420
It’s… okay.

233
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,790
You’re just…

234
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,830
confusing me with another me.

235
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:30,560
You said we’re a couple.
When exactly did that happen?

236
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:40,650
In high school.

237
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,940
When I was in Grade 10?

238
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,130
Yes, during the sports day.

239
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:49,870
But we were on different teams.

240
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,260
You were on team yellow,
I was on team blue.

241
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:53,600
You were a drum major.

242
00:19:54,150 --> 00:19:56,330
The third baton—I was forced into it.

243
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:59,710
You kept dropping the baton on your
head just so you could get replaced.

244
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:02,700
Your head would get a bump every day

245
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,520
because they wouldn’t let you switch.

246
00:20:04,650 --> 00:20:05,760
How did you know?

247
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,710
We didn’t even know
each other back then.

248
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:10,850
Let me ask you something.

249
00:20:11,530 --> 00:20:12,610
You and me…

250
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:14,160
The other me.

251
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,300
How did we get to know each other

252
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:19,160
when we never even talked to
or met each other in this world?

253
00:20:19,940 --> 00:20:20,940
We’ve talked before.

254
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,040
I can ignore this call.

255
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,340
No, you should answer it.

256
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:51,830
I’m not going.

257
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,720
I told you I'm not going.
I’m hanging up.

258
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,560
Was that P’ Wim?

259
00:21:07,070 --> 00:21:08,240
You know Ai Wim?

260
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:12,620
Well, if it’s P’ Wim,
who doesn’t know him?

261
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,670
He’s both the student
president and a university MC.

262
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:19,080
I see him all the time.

263
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:20,700
But you didn’t see me?

264
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,260
Are you upset?

265
00:21:42,510 --> 00:21:43,380
P’ Cir.

266
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,570
P’ Cir krub.

267
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:02,980
- P’ Cir krub.
- I’m supposed to get my stitches out today.

268
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:05,650
Oh, then why aren’t you going?

269
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:09,450
I’d rather stay here.

270
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,720
With you.

271
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:15,270
No, you to get your stitches out.

272
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:17,270
What time is your appointment?

273
00:22:20,450 --> 00:22:21,790
Don’t tell me it’s now?

274
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:25,780
Get up, you need to go now! Up!

275
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,830
I want to stay with you.

276
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:30,610
No, you need to get your stitches removed.

277
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,530
Get up. Don't act so heavy, get up!

278
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:37,940
Come on.

279
00:22:43,390 --> 00:22:45,150
Are you the patient’s friend?

280
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:48,240
Why didn’t you bring
him back to the hospital?

281
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:51,510
The doctor already said to monitor
his condition for a few more days.

282
00:22:51,530 --> 00:22:54,820
So how could he just run off like that?

283
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,820
Do you realize we were all over
the hospital searching for him?

284
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,320
Well… I…

285
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,210
You’re going to say he’s fine?

286
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:05,510
But Mr. Rames was unconscious for
three days without any known cause.

287
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:07,520
What would you do
if his condition worsened?

288
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:11,260
Even if the brain CT scan
shows nothing wrong

289
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:13,800
how could he just sneak out
of the hospital like that?

290
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,050
That’s just childish!

291
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:17,750
So when exactly was he
supposed to get discharged?

292
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,050
Today.

293
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:24,320
There’s still the concussion issue as well.

294
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:25,660
What?

295
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,290
It’s nothing serious.

296
00:23:29,510 --> 00:23:32,660
Mr. Rames woke up and
was just a little confused

297
00:23:32,800 --> 00:23:35,190
but his memory will settle down soon.

298
00:23:35,370 --> 00:23:36,470
You don’t have to worry.

299
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:40,810
And please don’t let him run
away from the hospital again.

300
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:44,820
Though it’s better if he doesn’t
end up getting admitted again.

301
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:02,160
Confused? Concussion?
What if everything he's done…

302
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
My head hurts.

303
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,570
Phu, what’s wrong?

304
00:24:12,370 --> 00:24:13,400
Are you not feeling well?

305
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,120
I’m fine.

306
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:22,570
Please don’t make me worry.

307
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:24,080
What are you doing?

308
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,510
But you said your head hurts.

309
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:29,980
It’s your fault.

310
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,120
Why did you run away from the hospital?

311
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,810
I wanted to see you.

312
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,890
But that's not a reason
to run away from the hospital.

313
00:24:49,770 --> 00:24:51,400
Aren’t you going to talk to me?

314
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,730
P’ Cir krub.

315
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:02,960
P’ Cir krub.

316
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,920
Sneaky boy.

317
00:25:14,080 --> 00:25:15,900
Can you answer me now?

318
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,750
I...

319
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:28,180
I wanted to make sure that this place…

320
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,850
this world, has you in it.

321
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:36,550
Everyone tells me you’re not my boyfriend.

322
00:25:38,030 --> 00:25:38,990
They say…

323
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,190
I need to get plenty of rest,
and that I'm confused.

324
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,430
But I’m not confused.

325
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:54,630
See? You’re still here with me.

326
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:01,560
You do realize, don’t you?

327
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,850
This Phu right here isn’t that Phukan.

328
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:17,330
That’s true.

329
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,770
You’re not my boyfriend yet.

330
00:26:33,270 --> 00:26:36,530
Even though I’m not,
I can still worry about you.

331
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,990
And if you want me to worry about you

332
00:26:41,710 --> 00:26:45,750
you have to promise me that you
won’t run away from the hospital

333
00:26:46,600 --> 00:26:49,720
skip your doctor’s appointments,
or cause trouble for anyone.

334
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:51,410
Do you understand?

335
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:52,880
What if I say no?

336
00:27:00,150 --> 00:27:01,340
Please, P’ Cir.

337
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,050
Please.

338
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:08,780
Promise me you won’t do it again.

339
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:12,230
No more running away
from the hospital, okay?

340
00:27:19,450 --> 00:27:20,570
Sneaky boy.

341
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:40,020
How did it end up like this?

342
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:46,210
Ai Phu, you shouldn’t
have made that promise.

343
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,020
You keep asking trouble for every day.

344
00:27:50,790 --> 00:27:52,060
Thank you for taking me home.

345
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,460
But I should be the one
taking the patient home.

346
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:58,570
Not the other way around.

347
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,390
It's only right that I took you home.

348
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,790
Your car’s being repaired, right?

349
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,230
How did you—

350
00:28:06,990 --> 00:28:08,000
I won’t ask anymore.

351
00:28:09,510 --> 00:28:10,900
Take care on your way home.

352
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,190
Don’t worry about me.

353
00:28:18,470 --> 00:28:19,470
I’m already home.

354
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,070
My room’s just downstairs.

355
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,650
In this building?

356
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:41,250
You’ve already promised me.

357
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,790
So, see you tomorrow.

358
00:28:59,290 --> 00:29:03,030
You and I live in the same condo? For real?

359
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,240
Someone like him would actually like me?

360
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:21,900
He’s not from another planet, right?

361
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,680
Definitely an alien.

362
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:37,430
No doubt.

363
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:42,670
Did you wait long?

364
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,720
I just got here.

365
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,850
I don’t think so.

366
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,660
Look, the water’s already warm.

367
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,140
You just got out of the hospital.

368
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:55,590
What if you get sick again?

369
00:29:55,750 --> 00:29:57,710
The nurse warned you
to take care of yourself.

370
00:29:57,920 --> 00:30:00,730
But you'll get sunstroke
if you sit in the sun like this.

371
00:30:04,190 --> 00:30:05,670
Don’t underestimate the weather here.

372
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,010
Be careful, or you'll die from heatstroke.

373
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,570
P' Cir, I’m being serious.

374
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:21,480
So am I.

375
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,710
Then why are you smiling?

376
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,600
You don’t make me feel like
you’re someone else at all.

377
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:34,680
I’m glad you’re letting us
get to know each other.

378
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,030
Like this.

379
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,040
Hey!

380
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,100
What’s wrong, Phu?

381
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:52,300
Shit, I left the clothes out.

382
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,770
I’m screwed.

383
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,820
Wait, Phu! Wait! Hold on!

384
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,240
I need to grab my uniform.
I don’t have any clean ones left.

385
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,250
I’ll do it.

386
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,490
It’s okay, I’ll do it.

387
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,960
I said I’ll do it. Come here.

388
00:31:10,030 --> 00:31:10,860
P’ Cir!

389
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,250
Let me go, I’m not being stubborn.

390
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,070
I’ll do it. Just stay here.

391
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:38,580
Here.

392
00:31:47,390 --> 00:31:48,420
Are you teasing me?

393
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,810
Worry about yourself first.

394
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,150
Sit down.

395
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:58,990
You’re one to talk.

396
00:31:59,450 --> 00:32:01,130
Come here, I’ll dry your hair for you.

397
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,640
Seriously, you worry
about me but not yourself?

398
00:32:13,710 --> 00:32:16,040
Because someone always
forgets to think about himself.

399
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:18,610
You're not scolding me, are you?

400
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:20,690
I wouldn’t dare scold you.

401
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,440
P’ Cir, I’m sorry! Does it hurt?

402
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:30,610
Let me take a look.

403
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:32,920
Does it hurt?
I'm sorry, I didn’t mean to.

404
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:33,730
Phu.

405
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,940
Stay still. Should we
have a doctor look at it?

406
00:32:35,990 --> 00:32:36,680
Phu.

407
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:39,460
I'm sorry, I forgot you just had
your stitches removed. So sorry.

408
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,220
- I didn’t mean to.
- Phu!

409
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,400
Yes?

410
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,560
If you don't get off me,
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

411
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:01,130
Well...

412
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:05,000
I’d better change into something
else before I catch a cold.

413
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,350
Makes me think of the old times.

414
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:42,940
What’s this, P’ Cir?

415
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:45,120
Paper cup phone.

416
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:48,010
I know that.

417
00:33:48,510 --> 00:33:52,460
You know, I used to help a kid
make these for homework.

418
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,700
and brought one to school to play with.

419
00:33:55,010 --> 00:33:58,840
But my friends said I was acting too old.

420
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,700
Didn't you ask me how
we got to know each other?

421
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:09,370
Are you saying we got to
know each other through this?

422
00:34:24,050 --> 00:34:27,120
Knock, knock… knock.

423
00:34:32,340 --> 00:34:33,870
- Give it back!
- This way! This way!

424
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:34,929
Catch it!

425
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,679
It's dangerous. Give it back!

426
00:34:37,699 --> 00:34:39,159
- Let us play with it for a bit.
- Throw it to me!

427
00:34:40,570 --> 00:34:41,770
Now you've made me angry!

428
00:34:41,790 --> 00:34:43,679
Ooh, you're angry?

429
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:45,280
- Come take it if you can!
- One more time.

430
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,310
Throw it to me.

431
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,280
Shit!

432
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:51,350
Shit, the Grade 12 room is downstairs.

433
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:53,710
Phu, it’s yours. Take it back.

434
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,389
Hey, you can't just ditch me like this.

435
00:34:58,490 --> 00:34:59,500
Hey, what’s that?

436
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:01,170
Someone's tugging on the string.

437
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,490
Pull it back.

438
00:35:02,510 --> 00:35:04,550
I can’t. Look, someone’s really tugging it.

439
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,750
Just throw it away.
No one will know it’s from our room.

440
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,300
- No one knows my ass!
- Do it.

441
00:35:09,330 --> 00:35:12,180
Above us is the rooftop, so how
could they not know it’s from our room?

442
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,800
Then go ahead and talk.
We’re out of this. Go ahead.

443
00:35:19,070 --> 00:35:20,080
Here I go.

444
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,750
Knock, knock, knock. Who’s there?

445
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:37,420
Nong Grade 10 calling
P’ Grade 12, is anyone there?

446
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,460
If you hear me, please
send an alien signal back.

447
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,650
Hey, someone’s answering!

448
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,860
- Go ahead, keep talking.
- Yeah.

449
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:53,660
Can I have the cup back?

450
00:35:55,890 --> 00:36:00,040
If you want it back,
you have to guess who I am.

451
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,580
Wait a second!

452
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:11,290
That’s definitely not it.

453
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,540
You got the wrong story.
When did I ever smile sweetly?

454
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:15,370
Who put that filter on me?

455
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:18,200
You really answered me like that.

456
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,500
I clearly remember that when you walked in

457
00:36:21,530 --> 00:36:24,830
you were shaking with
fear and kept saying sorry.

458
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,910
But you were too cute, I couldn’t
bring myself to scold you.

459
00:36:29,740 --> 00:36:31,440
That was the first time we met.

460
00:36:31,950 --> 00:36:34,680
That’s not true. No one answered me.

461
00:36:35,710 --> 00:36:37,360
The you in this world didn’t answer me.

462
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,650
The me in this world must be stupid.

463
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:50,160
No, you’re not.

464
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:55,450
Phukan in this world might be too
slow to catch up with the cup thieves.

465
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,490
You believe me?

466
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:06,630
I was going to talk to you
about this, so might as well now.

467
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,570
Apart from knowing my passcode

468
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:13,920
what else can you show me
to prove we're a couple?

469
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:15,780
What do you want me to do?

470
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:21,180
What else do you know about me?

471
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:23,540
You believe in auspicious colors.

472
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,820
Everyone knows that.

473
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:28,280
So you bought a white car since
it's for Thursday-born people.

474
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,170
And your mom said
blue cars are hard to sell.

475
00:37:30,190 --> 00:37:32,130
You might've heard it from someone.

476
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:34,350
You don’t wear lucky colors on your clothes

477
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,280
but you do in your underwear.

478
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:39,740
Everyone knows that too.

479
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,950
Today’s Saturday, so you’re wearing purple.

480
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:46,380
Probably with a guitar pattern.

481
00:37:47,630 --> 00:37:48,630
How did you know?

482
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,310
It’s your favorite underwear.

483
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,420
- But I like it.
- Oh!

484
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,690
It looks cute on you.

485
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,480
One more thing.

486
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:05,740
There’s a mole on your right hip,
a palm below your waist.

487
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:06,900
Hey!

488
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,410
How did you know?

489
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,290
Believe me now?

490
00:38:14,410 --> 00:38:15,770
What choice do I have?

491
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,980
I didn’t even know about the mole before.

492
00:38:19,840 --> 00:38:23,280
So, you’ve taken off…

493
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,730
Phu.

494
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,930
Yes?

495
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:30,030
You might not know me in this world.

496
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,530
I'm not your boyfriend or your lover.

497
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:40,280
But… can I just stay close to you?

498
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,060
What a modest wish.

499
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:12,320
I know you want to pat my head.

500
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,560
Then I'll give you a bonus.

501
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:19,660
You can pat my head anytime you want.

502
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:55,540
Let me ask for this too.

503
00:39:57,750 --> 00:39:59,130
Hope it’s not too modest.

504
00:40:15,820 --> 00:40:16,820
Sawasdee krub, P’ Cir.

505
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:18,930
Where’s Phu?

506
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,200
Probably in the cafeteria.
You wanna see him?

507
00:40:23,570 --> 00:40:24,990
No, I have class.

508
00:40:29,460 --> 00:40:31,100
I think you should tell him the truth.

509
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,160
What does that mean?
What do you know?

510
00:40:41,550 --> 00:40:42,580
Nothing much.

511
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,340
I'm just rambling.

512
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:51,580
It’s all up to you.

513
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:54,170
I’m just saying.

514
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:57,110
I’m off now.

515
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:09,890
Maybe he’s really from another world.

516
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,460
He knows things you didn’t even know about.

517
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,590
Fine, I’ll believe him.

518
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,030
But you’re not his boyfriend, Ai Phu.

519
00:41:21,050 --> 00:41:23,630
I mean, you are, but
not the you in this world.

520
00:41:25,630 --> 00:41:26,650
Listen, Ai Phu.

521
00:41:27,130 --> 00:41:29,070
Phukan is P’ Cir’s boyfriend.

522
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:32,660
But that Phukan isn’t you.
Is that clear?

523
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,280
Yeah, crystal clear.

524
00:41:36,890 --> 00:41:38,470
So what are you gonna do next?

525
00:41:40,620 --> 00:41:41,670
I don’t know.

526
00:41:43,260 --> 00:41:46,640
How can he be this ridiculously handsome?

527
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,170
And…

528
00:42:05,470 --> 00:42:06,540
His lips are...

529
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:08,930
super soft too.

530
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,680
So crazy handsome.

531
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:24,140
With those lips and nose
put together on his sharp face...

532
00:42:26,470 --> 00:42:28,920
who could keep their heart from racing?

533
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,630
No.

534
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:36,700
The Phukan P’ Cir wants
to see isn’t you, Ai Phu.

535
00:42:37,610 --> 00:42:39,190
He’s your boyfriend in another world.

536
00:42:46,330 --> 00:42:48,250
You shouldn’t bite off
more than you can chew.

537
00:42:51,220 --> 00:42:53,090
Did I say I was gonna do something?

538
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:58,410
Yeah, you did.
You said a lot too.

539
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:02,340
You were voicing your thoughts
out loud and talking to yourself.

540
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:04,710
The whole cafeteria
thinks you’re crazy now.

541
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,350
- Ai Jin.
- What?

542
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,360
Take a seat.

543
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,520
What’s up, buddy?

544
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,970
I’ve made up my mind.

545
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:20,100
I’m gonna help P’ Cir return to that world.

546
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:28,920
I don’t think you should.

547
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:31,230
No, I’ve made up my mind.

548
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:37,260
The person who’s hurting isn’t just
this P’ Cir, but also the other me.

549
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:39,880
This P’ Cir says I’m his boyfriend.

550
00:43:40,270 --> 00:43:43,430
Then what if the P’ Cir who’s never
talked to me go to that Phukan?

551
00:43:43,890 --> 00:43:45,260
If your boyfriend suddenly changed

552
00:43:45,850 --> 00:43:48,190
who do you think is the most
heartbroken right now?

553
00:43:50,320 --> 00:43:51,810
I know my heart skips a beat for him

554
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,380
but I don’t want to come between lovers.

555
00:43:57,780 --> 00:43:58,780
I’ve made up my mind.

556
00:44:01,190 --> 00:44:03,200
I’m gonna go see P’ Cir.
Clear the plate for me.

557
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:12,070
This is so tangled up, Ai Phu.

558
00:44:26,710 --> 00:44:28,750
Everyone’s just as much of a headache.

559
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,990
There’s gotta be a way.

560
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:45,150
There must be shamans or spiritual
masters who can send him back.

561
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:48,560
Or maybe we need to create
a magic circle like Doctor Strange?

562
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:51,540
Oh, but he came here without using one.

563
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:12,000
You’re okay, Phu?
Are you hurt anywhere?

564
00:45:14,070 --> 00:45:16,140
Just when I had decided to send him back

565
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:24,780
this guy, the one I once thought
was crazy, is changing my world.

566
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:28,950
He’s making my heart beat
in a way it never has before.

567
00:45:31,660 --> 00:45:33,090
What should I do?

568
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:42,320

569
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:22,140
Knock, knock, knock.
Who’s there?

570
00:46:30,320 --> 00:46:33,230
Nong Grade 10 calling
P' Grade 12, is anyone there?

571
00:46:34,410 --> 00:46:37,280
If you hear me, please
send an alien signal back.

572
00:47:22,710 --> 00:47:24,390
You should have answered him, Ai Cir.

573
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:30,840
I'll find a way to send
you back to your world

574
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,620
so you can be with
the Phukan you belong to.

575
00:47:33,150 --> 00:47:34,680
I know how you feel about him.

576
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:38,290
But let me make it clear—you’ve
got nothing going on with him.

577
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:41,010
As far as I know,
you only talked to him once.

578
00:47:41,120 --> 00:47:42,350
- And that time you—
- Ai Wim.

579
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:50,910
Aren’t you gonna kiss?
