1
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,360
Who are you?

2
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,880
Let me go!
I need to go find Phu!

3
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,560
You can’t go anywhere.

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:21,240
You have to wait for the other Cirrus to return to his world.

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:24,200
Lukprae, your fiancé.

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:28,120
No matter how hard you try,
P' Cir will never look at you.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,400
Even if you're not my P' Cir,...

8
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:32,960
but please tell him.

9
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:35,200
Wherever he is,

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,040
I love him.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,880
P’ Cir, I finally understand my feelings.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
- I’m a selfish guy.
- Phu.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,440
I don’t want to lose you.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:07,080
Whether it’s the other
Phukan or your fiancée

15
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:09,120
I don’t want to lose you to any of them.

16
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:11,360
Phu, where are you?

17
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,000
Can you hear me, Phu!? Phu!

18
00:01:14,039 --> 00:01:17,000
You may not be my P' Cir anymore.

19
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,039
Phu!

20
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:22,440
Answer me!

21
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,400
I’m begging you, Phu.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
Let me out! Phu!

23
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
Phu!

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,360
Please tell the person I love that…

25
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,080
'I love you, P' Cir.'

26
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:40,800
I really love you.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,120
Time to go back.

28
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,800
EP IX: Truth from the Parallel World

29
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,960
I really love you.

30
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,520
And…

31
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,400
Goodbye.

32
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,360
Please tell the person I love that…

33
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:26,160
'I love you, P' Cir.'

34
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,680
I really love you.

35
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:00,280
Are you going to leave me, Phu?

36
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,720
P’ Cir.

37
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,200
Please don’t push me away.

38
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,760
I'll do anything, just as long
as you let me stay by your side.

39
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Whenever you need me, I'll be
the one to play the flute for you.

40
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,280
Whenever you can't sleep

41
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,880
let me lull you to sleep.

42
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:36,080
And I’ll help you buy
the offerings every year.

43
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,720
When you're lonely,
I won't let you feel lonely again.

44
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,320
I’ll never ever let you feel lonely again.

45
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:48,280
But can I ask for just one thing, Phu?

46
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,720
Please don’t push me away.

47
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,080
I can't go on without you anymore.

48
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,280
Not anymore.

49
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,680
P’ Cir, is it really you?

50
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
It’s me.

51
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,360
Do you remember the paper cup phone?

52
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,920
Knock, knock, knock.

53
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,920
A signal from outer space.

54
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,680
And the flute?

55
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,240
I’ll be the one to play it for you.

56
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:52,440
‘The person you know who.’

57
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:05,560
Do you remember?
That person still cares about you.

58
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,320
You know who it is.

59
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,440
Do you love me, P’ Cir?

60
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,480
Yes.

61
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,720
I love you more than anything.

62
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:40,159
Listen to me, P’ Cir.

63
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,440
Listen. You have to listen.

64
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,600
I’m listening.

65
00:07:50,640 --> 00:07:52,000
I love you, P’ Cir.

66
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:05,000
♪ Please don’t doubt my sincerity ♪

67
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,880

68
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:14,720

♪ You know who it is ♪

71
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:29,040
You’re saying I returned
to my original world?

72
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:34,080
Yeah, because you didn’t
have a scar right here.

73
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
That’s why I know it wasn’t you.

74
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:40,120
But others said you had amnesia.

75
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:43,720
Did I…

76
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,480
do anything to you?

77
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:54,040
No, he's just different from you.

78
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,240
Though he looks just like you

79
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:59,680
he's more sharp-tongued
and short-tempered.

80
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:01,640
But he wasn’t mean to me.

81
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,880
He was kind to me, but
he’s just not the P' Cir I know.

82
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:26,480
So, did you meet…

83
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,920
the other Phukan?

84
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
No.

85
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,320
All I remember is that
when I ran in to push you

86
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,080
my entire body went numb.

87
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,520
And then, I felt like I’d died.

88
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:55,080
The next thing I knew,
it felt like I woke up in a dream.

89
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:01,040
It was a long and very strange dream.

90
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:03,600
And I couldn’t escape from it.

91
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:08,800
What happened next?

92
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
That’s it.

93
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,560
What? How come?

94
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,440
Well, I was scared.

95
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,040
Scared of what?

96
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,480
I was scared I’d never see you again.

97
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:32,320
I was scared I'd never
see you again either.

98
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:34,680
And I know now.

99
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,480
Know what?

100
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,800
That it can't be just any P' Cir.
It has to be you.

101
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,120
I’m sorry.

102
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:49,600
Why are you apologizing?
It’s not your fault.

103
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,840
I’m the one who owes you an apology.

104
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,440
It’s my fault.

105
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,000
If I hadn’t pushed you away, you
wouldn't have been in that accident.

106
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:02,040
If I hadn’t said those things…
If I hadn’t been selfish and stubborn…

107
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,560
If I hadn’t run away from you,
you wouldn’t have gotten hurt.

108
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,200
And you wouldn’t have had to—

109
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,960
Phu, you don’t have to apologize anymore.

110
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,280
You didn’t do anything wrong.

111
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,120
I should be the one to apologize.

112
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,160
I’m sorry.

113
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,640
What are you apologizing to me for?

114
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,040
For a lot of things.

115
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:38,720
There’s no need to apologize anymore.

116
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,280
But can you promise me?

117
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,280
I promise.

118
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,120
Let me finish first.

119
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,640
No matter what it is, I’ll promise.

120
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:56,640
Then don’t leave me.

121
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,240
I promise I won’t ever leave you.

122
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,160
Even if you push me away, I won’t leave.

123
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,040
I was gonna give him an earful.

124
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,960
But looks like things
turned out well after all.

125
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,400
At last, I’ll finally be free for real.

126
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,440
Why are you looking at me like that?
Ai Cir’s back to normal now.

127
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,400
I know he’s been an asshole
these past few days

128
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,240
but cut him some slack, okay?

129
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,400
If he hadn’t lost his memory, he
never would’ve treated Phu that way.

130
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,360
He’s been crazy about
Phu since high school.

131
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,400
Even went as far as lying
that they were dating—

132
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:23,120
Shit! I screwed up!

133
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,360
What if I told you I already knew?

134
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,600
No way. How could you possibly know?

135
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,800
I don’t think I’ve told anyone about this.

136
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,200
P’ Cir told me a while back.

137
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:38,160
I’ve been his friend for years,
and he only just told me.

138
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,240
There's no way he told you first.

139
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,680
P’ Wim.

140
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:51,960
I have something to tell you.

141
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
What is it?

142
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:02,920
I’m not falling for your tricks.
Stop making that scary face at me.

143
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:12,960
Ai Jin.

144
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,960
- I’m getting scared—
- I can hear people's thoughts.

145
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,600
That’s not funny.

146
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:26,520
Do you take me for a fool?

147
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,800
I’m not stupid enough
to believe in that nonsense.

148
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:32,440
I can hear everyone’s
thoughts, including yours.

149
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,080
I told you I’m not stupid.
Why do you keep treating me like I am?

150
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,560
I've never thought you were stupid.

151
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,680
Then why are you doing this to me?

152
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,960
How many times have
you treated me like a joke?

153
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,920
I’m being serious.

154
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,600
I’m done talking to you.

155
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:55,680
And don’t bother talking to me
until you stop treating me like this.

156
00:15:03,840 --> 00:15:05,440
Damn it, the hell he didn’t tease me!

157
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,440
How many times has he made me
feel like I’m just some joke to him?

158
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:10,720
Fuck! And why am I this pissed?

159
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,200
Let go.

160
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,680
I said let go.

161
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:21,280
Please listen to me.

162
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:22,960
I said let go.

163
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,160
I've known that P' Cir likes Ai Phu
since my first day here.

164
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,440
I know that P' Cir asked
you to get close to Ai Phu.

165
00:15:33,880 --> 00:15:36,320
I know he's been secretly
taking care of Ai Phu all this time.

166
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,840
And I know you’re
worried about both of them.

167
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,800
And I also know that

168
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:46,040
you know P' Cir was lying about
coming from a parallel world.

169
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:51,320
All this time, I never teased you.

170
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,880
I just heard your thoughts.

171
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,400
Please believe me.

172
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:07,240
P’ Wim.

173
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:15,120
If you can really hear my thoughts

174
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,640
then you should be able to tell
what I'm thinking right now.

175
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,920
I don’t know.

176
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,480
I knew it! You really
enjoy messing with me!

177
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,640
How many times have you done this to me?!

178
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,480
Just when I was about to believe
you, you pull this on me again!

179
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:44,200
Just tell me what you want me to do!

180
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:50,360
Or do you just want me to be
some idiot you can easily manipulate?

181
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,920
This isn’t funny to me, you know.

182
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,760
Don't play around with
other people's feelings.

183
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,200
It’s because I like you.

184
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:09,800
The moment I realized I like you...

185
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,800
I couldn’t hear your thoughts anymore.

186
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:24,599
This is the only thing
I want you to believe me on.

187
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,920
Phu, how are you feeling?

188
00:17:47,320 --> 00:17:49,280
Where have you been?
You didn’t reply our texts.

189
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,560
We were worried sick.
Why didn’t you pick up the phone?

190
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,960
Did your brain finally
start working again?

191
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,400
Tee, don’t say that.

192
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,160
Don’t stop me. Do you have any
idea what your P' Cir said to me?

193
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,640
He just didn’t remember at the time.

194
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,400
Don’t defend him.

195
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,200
That’s why I asked if his brain finally
remembered who his boyfriend is now.

196
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:23,920
I’m still mad.

197
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,200
How could he let his
crazy fiancée slap you?

198
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:27,840
What?

199
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:34,040
Don’t tell me you don’t remember.
You’re a downright asshole.

200
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,400
I’m really angry now.

201
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,120
Lin.

202
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,320
Will you stop already?

203
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:42,840
Good.

204
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:48,600
You really don’t remember
the time you lost your memory?

205
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:57,440
He really can’t remember.
I can vouch for that.

206
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,360
Hold on.

207
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,560
Who’s my fiancée,
and what did she do to you?

208
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,800
Er, well…

209
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:06,760
Why didn’t you tell me about it?

210
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,120
I forgot.

211
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,120
Phu, you almost got slapped.

212
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:14,480
But Ai Tee stepped in just in time.

213
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,920
I didn’t get hit at all.
Completely unharmed.

214
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,840
That’s right, Phu was safe.

215
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,800
So you have to answer
our questions, P’ Cir.

216
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,640
Ask away.

217
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,960
You love Phu, right?

218
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,760
Yes.

219
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,600
So you’ll take good care of him, right?

220
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:50,080
That’s exactly what I intend to do.

221
00:19:52,120 --> 00:19:55,600
So we don’t have to worry about
that incident happening again, right?

222
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,240
I’ll prove it to you.

223
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,640
Please make sure you’re not just all talk.

224
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:07,240
You have no idea how much we love Phu.

225
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,240
And vengeance is terrifying, you know.

226
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,840
My love for Phu is just
as strong as anyone’s.

227
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,480
Phu, isn’t it too late to blush now?

228
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,840
I’m not blushing. Who’s blushing?

229
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:33,280
So where are Ai Jin and Ai Achi?

230
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,720
Ai Jin said he’s going to the SU room.

231
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:40,000
As for Achi… just ignore him.

232
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,680
He can go to hell for all we care,
as long as he doesn’t cause any trouble.

233
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,320
C’mon, please trust P’ Chi.
You’re the only one for me.

234
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,720
I mean it, I'm not just sweet-talking you.

235
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,680
When have I ever lied to you?

236
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Right?

237
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:23,560
Er, I gotta hang up now.
The professor just arrived.

238
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,560
Talk to you later, bye-bye.

239
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:34,800
Can I talk to you for a second?

240
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,360
What’s up?

241
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:50,040
Heard you finally got
the dog out of your mouth.

242
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,920
- Dog?
- Yeah, the one in your mouth.

243
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:54,480
Whatever.

244
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:57,240
Ai Rome, did you know about my fiancée?

245
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,320
Look, I’ve got something
juicier than your fiancée stuff.

246
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,640
You can’t remember when
you lost your memory, right?

247
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,120
Damn, your boyfriend's
friend has a fucking foul mouth.

248
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,840
She said you’re ugly as hell
and even called you a dog.

249
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,440
Damn. She even told you not to
donate your body when you die.

250
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,640
'Cause people will find out
you've got no brain.

251
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,800
Her words stung to the core.

252
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,600
But I argued my ass off for you.

253
00:22:20,600 --> 00:22:23,240
Saying you’ve got a brain,
you’re just not using it.

254
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,160
- Ai Rome.
- Hey, no need to thank me.

255
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:27,560
What about my fiancée?

256
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,000
Why don’t you ask your boyfriend?

257
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:32,840
Why are you asking me?

258
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
I don’t want Phu to stress over it.

259
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,160
So you’re asking me instead?

260
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:40,160
Shit, even though my brain’s fucked up?

261
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,400
- That’s true.
- Huh? What?

262
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,760
Fine, I’ll tell you, but only what I know.

263
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:52,000
Your fiancée has practically
claimed she’s your other half.

264
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:55,720
She said she’s gonna take
your last name no matter what.

265
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,680
Man, she really went all out.

266
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,960
Can you believe that in just one day,
everyone in the faculty knows?

267
00:23:01,240 --> 00:23:04,960
Wait, no. I bet the whole university
knows by now that she’s your fiancée.

268
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,920
She’s been so extra about it,
even the dogs and cats know.

269
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,400
If you don’t believe me,
go ask the housekeeper auntie.

270
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,840
Even she knows it too.

271
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,720
There’s still more.

272
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:20,160
The craziest part is,
your fiancée didn’t stop.

273
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,040
She tracked Phu down
and talked shit to him.

274
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:29,640
Then she grabbed his head and
started slapping him. Slap! Slap! Slap!
What Rome says, divide it by ten.

275
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:31,480
I still feel bad for Phu.

276
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:35,160
But I don’t know how it ended,
because I’m not the nosy type.

277
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,720
But I heard Phu missed classes
for two weeks to see the doctor.

278
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:48,280
One Week Later

279
00:23:57,320 --> 00:23:59,200
- Eww!
- Ai Phu, what the hell?

280
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:00,840
Guys.

281
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,280
What?

282
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,840
I think P’ Cir’s been
acting strange lately.

283
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,200
He’s cheating on you?!

284
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,040
I knew it was gonna happen.
Does he wanna mess with us?

285
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,480
Come on, guys. Let’s go!

286
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:14,640
I told you hot guys are assholes.
I know it for a fact.

287
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,600
Jeez, that’s not it. Just listen.

288
00:24:17,000 --> 00:24:19,320
P’ Cir’s been acting strange lately.

289
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,760
So here’s the deal.

290
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:35,280
Jeez, Ai Phu. Quit showing off
your hubby, it's pissing me off.

291
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,000
I’m not showing off. How’d
you think I’m showing him off?

292
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:44,840
I don’t really want to
take Ai Chi’s side, but it’s...

293
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:48,280
Bragging, flaunting, boasting.
You name it, Phukan.

294
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:51,120
There’s more. You gotta listen.
Warning: Someone's about
to show off his boyfriend.

295
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:52,880
Single people, please
watch with discretion.

296
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:59,840
I called Ai Achi sleazy, and he argued
that he wasn’t sleazy, just shameless.

297
00:25:00,360 --> 00:25:01,680
Can you believe him, P’ Cir?

298
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,720
I don’t like—

299
00:25:05,920 --> 00:25:07,240
No! My snack!

300
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:14,760
I don’t get it.
You’re obviously showing off.

301
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:18,280
Listen carefully. There’s still more.

302
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,560
I’ll get them for you.

303
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,800
You want green tea, right?

304
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:33,920
No.

305
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,720
What about bread?

306
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Soft drink?

307
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,400
No.

308
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,240
Cake, right?

309
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,360
None. Of. Them.

310
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,920
I want to eat yogurt.

311
00:25:51,280 --> 00:25:54,000
And do you know what happened after that?

312
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,800
How would I know? Just spill it.

313
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,640
When I got home, I found...

314
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:08,680
There’s more, and it’s
really strange. Trust me.

315
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,640
I’ll open it.

316
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:13,680
It’s okay, I can do it.

317
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,800
Let me do it.
You might get yourself cut.

318
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,200
Just think about it.

319
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,560
He wouldn’t even let me
open the package I ordered.

320
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,840
And that’s not all.

321
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,760
- Where's the architecture faculty?
- Oh.

322
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:32,920
He was even worried when
someone asked me for directions.

323
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,120
See? P’ Cir’s really been acting strange.

324
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:42,880
Ai Phu.

325
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,920
Right? You think so too, right?

326
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,800
Do you know what this condition is called?

327
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:49,760
You know?

328
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,240
He’s obsessed.

329
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,680
With you.

330
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:04,480
- Er, Ai Phu, there’s something—
- That must be him.

331
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,960
P’ Cir

332
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,280
Damn, they’re both just as obsessed.

333
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:12,320
Hurry up and answer.

334
00:27:12,760 --> 00:27:16,240
I can see you wanna talk to
him so bad, and it’s annoying me.

335
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:17,600
Yeah.

336
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,680
It’s okay, we can talk later.

337
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,240
Go ahead, Phu.

338
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,160
I’m off then.

339
00:27:28,560 --> 00:27:30,320
Mind your step, be careful not to fall.

340
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
Falling in love?

341
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,840
Look at your friend, he’s deep in it now.

342
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:41,800
I bet they’ll end up getting
it on this time for sure.

343
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,160
Take that!

344
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,920
You’d better stay within my reach.

345
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:56,000
Hey, what’s wrong?

346
00:27:57,320 --> 00:27:58,360
Why are you looking at me?

347
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:18,880
I’m fine from here.

348
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:24,160
You have class, and you
promised you wouldn’t skip.

349
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,360
But can I walk you to your classroom.

350
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:30,520
P’ Cir.

351
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,000
Fine, I’ll go.

352
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:37,480
Call me when your class is over.

353
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:41,320
Okay. Understood.

354
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,920
Nong Phu will obey P' Cir’s every command.

355
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,760
Bye-bye.

356
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,000
Pay attention to class.

357
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:06,080
Ai Phu, my buddy.
Can you help me with something?

358
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,160
- Come on.
- Wait.

359
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,240
Let go!

360
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:20,600
Come on, please help me.
You just gotta meet someone.

361
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,160
Who?

362
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,400
A pitiful girl.

363
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:29,040
Huh? You didn’t just hit and quit, did you?

364
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,760
I’m not gonna take a slap for you.

365
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,880
No, no, hear me out first.
I haven’t slept with her yet.

366
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,160
Please listen to me.

367
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,200
This girl’s really pitiful.

368
00:29:43,680 --> 00:29:46,840
She came crying to me, saying
she really needed to talk to you.

369
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:50,440
She said she was forced
by her family to do all that.

370
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:54,520
I really don’t think
she wanted to treat you that way.

371
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,520
That’s why she came to ask me for help.

372
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:59,480
Man, she’s pitiful as hell.

373
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,400
Can you please meet her?

374
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,280
So who exactly is this girl?

375
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,440
Come on, you’ll find out
once you get inside.

376
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,640
Look, you know what?

377
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,200
It's really hard as hell to
find a time to catch you alone.

378
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,960
- Come on. She’s waiting.
- Achi.

379
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,320
Hurry up, it won’t
take long. Trust me.

380
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:31,600
Achi, stop pushing me. Ai Achi!

381
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,000
Hey, what’s wrong with you?
I told you I don’t wanna skip class.

382
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,640
We finally got to meet.

383
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:46,160
Ai Achi, what’s the meaning of this?

384
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:49,000
This is the pitiful girl I told you about.

385
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:52,160
She’s P’ Cir’s fiancée who’s
everyone’s talking about, right?

386
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,200
Look, you gotta hear Prae’s side of
story first. Damn, she’s really pitiful.

387
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:02,360
Listen to me, Prae never wanted to
get engaged to P' Cir in the first place.

388
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,680
She was forced by her family and his mom.

389
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,840
She never wanted to be the villain
or ruin your relationship.

390
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:13,400
She asked me to bring you to her so you can
clear things up. That’s it, happy ending.

391
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:19,840
What do you want? Just say it.

392
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,520
Ai Phu, be nice.

393
00:31:23,080 --> 00:31:25,200
Will you stop already?
I’m getting angry now.

394
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:37,360
A man-stealer and a stalker,
how should I deal with this?

395
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,800
What are you talking about?

396
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,400
Cir’s mom told me everything. You
didn’t just start messing around with Cir.

397
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,280
You tricked him into stalking
you for years, didn’t you?

398
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,600
With what? I wonder.

399
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:58,320
You look so innocent,
but you’re actually really evil.

400
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,840
You tricked a guy into
obsessing over you so much

401
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,880
that he moved into the same condo as you.

402
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:07,960
Seriously, are you that
desperate to get Cir?

403
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,680
What the hell are you on about?

404
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:12,760
I’m speaking the truth.

405
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:16,760
Cir is mine, and has been for a long time.

406
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,440
We got engaged before
I left to study abroad.

407
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,760
Cir is well aware that I’m his bride-to-be.

408
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:29,600
But you! You’re the reason he’s changed.

409
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,480
Are you happy now that
you stole someone else’s man?

410
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:39,760
Shit, this is nothing like she told me.

411
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:45,160
I don’t know what you’re talking about,
but P' Cir and I just met this year.

412
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:50,720
Besides, he told me that
he’s never been engaged to you.

413
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:54,280
Everything is just your imagination.

414
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,440
Are you satisfied now?

415
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,040
No.

416
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
What are you doing?

417
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:09,200
I just want to say something to you.

418
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,520
I don’t know how you were brought up.

419
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:16,160
But running around causing
trouble like this is disgusting.

420
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,440
If you’re so confident that
P' Cir loves you, then go to him.

421
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,360
Why bother messing with someone else?

422
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,960
I don’t care about myself, but
you’re dragging my friend into this.

423
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:28,840
If you don’t care about
your prestigious background

424
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,720
you should at least think about yourself.

425
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:35,440
No one wants to see a woman chasing
after a man like this. Especially me!

426
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:37,280
You!

427
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,120
- Prae!
- You stole my Cir from me!

428
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,480
Knock it off!

429
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:44,520
Cir.

430
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,120
Yes, it’s me.

431
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,200
Didn't I tell you I wouldn't
get engaged to you?

432
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,800
I don’t love you.

433
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:58,360
Cir.

434
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,440
- Please hear me out first.
- Let go.

435
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,600
- Please don’t say that.
- I said let go!

436
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,719
Don't ever bother me or Phu again.

437
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:20,000
And if you don’t listen,
don’t say I didn’t warn you.

438
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,000
Are you okay, Phu?

439
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:27,600
I’m fine.

440
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,040
Shit, Ai Tee's gonna bury me alive.

441
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,920
I shouldn’t have done it, damn it.

442
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:23,560
P’ Cir, I’m really fine.

443
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,280
P’ Cir, I’m perfectly fine.

444
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,120
I’m sorry, you got hurt because of me.

445
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:47,880
Don’t apologize, it’s not your fault.

446
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:52,600
You didn’t slap me or pull my hair.
And you didn’t insult me either.

447
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,160
Or are you going to cheat on me
and be with that woman?

448
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:02,160
Phu, listen to me.

449
00:36:03,800 --> 00:36:05,120
That will never happen.

450
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,520
There will never be a day
when I cheat on you for anyone.

451
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
I believe you.

452
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:38,120
So… have you spoken to your fiancée yet?

453
00:36:42,120 --> 00:36:45,320
I called her and made it clear
that there won’t be any engagement.

454
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,720
And what did she say?

455
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,200
She screamed in my ear.

456
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,760
So that’s why you’ve
been acting strange lately.

457
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,760
I was worried about your safety.

458
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,560
Come on, P’ Cir.

459
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:15,120
In case you didn’t notice, I’m a guy.
I can... protect myself.

460
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,400
This will be gone in no time.
It’s just one slap.

461
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,240
So what are you going to do next?

462
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,120
I won’t marry her.

463
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:41,560
Please believe me.

464
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,760
I will never marry Lukprae.

465
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,280
My choice is clear.

466
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,000
It has been for a long time.

467
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:03,680
You are the most
important person in my life.

468
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,960
Like I said, I believe you.

469
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,440
Phu.

470
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,360
P’ Zone.

471
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,480
You're here to see P' Cir?

472
00:38:49,960 --> 00:38:52,280
Yeah, that’s what I planned.

473
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,520
Did you make plans with him?

474
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,160
He’s likely meeting
with the professor today.

475
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,160
Probably won’t be back until evening.

476
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:05,600
I’m here to give him a present from Dad.

477
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,560
It’s okay if I don’t see him.

478
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:10,640
I was gonna leave it in his room anyway.

479
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,400
But since I’ve run into you,
I’ll just leave it with you.

480
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,480
You know the passcode to P' Cir’s room?

481
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:20,440
Of course.

482
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,080
I believe you do too.

483
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,640
How would I know?

484
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:29,400
You already know.

485
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,800
And I think you've known
since you were born.

486
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,880
Hey.

487
00:39:52,280 --> 00:39:53,960
My birthday, P’ Cir?

488
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,280
Unbelieveable.

489
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:11,440
Wow, he’s got four monitors.

490
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,440
And two MacBooks as well?

491
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:09,680
Why do you have a yearbook
from my year, P' Cir?

492
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,520
P’ Cir in this world didn’t know me.

493
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:30,680
Did he?

494
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,320
A man-stealer.

495
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,400
And a stalker.
How should I deal with this?

496
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,840
What are you talking about?

497
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,560
Thank you.

498
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,920
Cir’s mom told me that you didn’t
just start messing around with him.

499
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,800
You tricked him into stalking
you for years, didn’t you?

500
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,640
You look so innocent,
but you’re actually really evil.

501
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:11,400
You tricked a guy into
obsessing over you so much

502
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:13,280
that he moved into the same condo as you.

503
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,400
We never knew each other...

504
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:22,040
until this P' Cir came
from another world, did we?

505
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,440
Thank you.

506
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:41,880
Sorry for lying.

507
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:49,240
Would you believe me
if I told you we were a couple?

508
00:42:50,040 --> 00:42:51,800
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

509
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,680
You’re saying we’re a couple
in some parallel world?

510
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:02,360
Sorry for lying.

511
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,720
Why are you following me?

512
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:25,400
I need to get the assignment
from you, that’s why.

513
00:43:27,920 --> 00:43:31,000
And I didn’t wanna wait
in the SU room either.

514
00:43:32,920 --> 00:43:34,200
Who are you trying to avoid?

515
00:43:36,520 --> 00:43:38,520
No, I’m not avoiding anyone.

516
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:54,960
Enough about me.
Let’s talk about you.

517
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,800
I’m glad you’re happy,

518
00:44:00,360 --> 00:44:01,800
But have you told Phu the truth yet?

519
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,640
As someone who’s seen his friend
has an unrequited love for 4-5 years

520
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:06,760
it’s quite nerve-wracking.

521
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:08,120
But honestly.

522
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:10,480
- When you confessed to me that you—
- Ai Wim.

523
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:13,600
What?

524
00:44:16,040 --> 00:44:17,320
Why are you making that face?

525
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:22,560
Did you come into my room?

526
00:44:23,360 --> 00:44:24,800
Don't try to change the subject.

527
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:27,720
I'm asking if you’ve told Phu

528
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,280
that you lied about coming from
some goddamn parallel world.

529
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,400
When the truth is you’ve
liked him since high school.

530
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,880
Did you come into my room!?

531
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:44,000
Why?

532
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:50,440
I didn’t put the yearbook here.

533
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:03,680
Phu.

534
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,320
I hope this world gets a happy ending.

535

00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,280
P’ Cir, it’s time to wake up.

537
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:48,800
You’re such a liar.

538
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:51,920
And what are you going to do?

539
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:54,520
I will do everything I can, Wim.

540
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:57,480
Because I can't go back to the life I had before.

541
00:45:58,080 --> 00:45:59,400
Everyone is worried about you.

542
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,160
Would it be a good idea to listen to them?

543
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:03,920
It was you all along, right?

544
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,880
I promise you won't see me again,

545
00:46:07,880 --> 00:46:12,080
but can you let me take care of you forever?
