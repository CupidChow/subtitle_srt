1
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,400
Sawasdee krub.

2
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:13,000
Mom sent someone to deal with Phu.

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:16,440
She sent someone to ask
how much money he’d want

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:17,440
to break up with you.

5
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:18,400
What?

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:19,640
Just date Ai Cir.

7
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:23,360
Are you and P’ Cir really together?

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
What if someone who cares
a lot about you lies to you?

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,040
I'd feel sad.

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,200
Can you promise me that
you won’t go anywhere?

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:36,200
As long as you want me to stay

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,960
I’ll be right here.

13
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,440
Need us with you today, Phu?

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:13,520
Today’s the day.

15
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,480
Ai Phu must be really down.

16
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:22,720
You okay, Phu?

17
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,120
Make sure you eat.
You’ve got errands to run all day.

18
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,880
The fuck’s going on today?
What a noisy morning!

19
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:39,520
The notifications woke me up.

20
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,920
Go to hell.

21
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:43,440
Shit!

22
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,360
It’s Phu’s dad’s deathday.

23
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,240
Just sleep and don’t wake up ever again.

24
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,400
You're a real asshole.

25
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,880
I’m sorryyyyyyyyy.
Ai Phu, I’m sorry.

26
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,520
Love you, buddy.
You can lean on my shoulder.

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:56,759
Who'd want your nasty shoulder?

28
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,200
- Don’t, Phu. You’ll get rabies.
- Call me and I’ll be there.

29
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,600
Come on, let’s take a shower.

30
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,120
You’ve got a ton to do today.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,000
I need to go buy things.

32
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:26,920
I know.

33
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,720
You’re getting offerings
for your dad, right?

34
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,360
Then we’d better hurry, or we’ll be late.

35
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,040
Right, I need to get moving.

36
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,440
I have to call for a ride too.
Don’t know when my car will be ready.

37
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:50,720
I’m coming with you.

38
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,840
I can go alone.
I do it every year.

39
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,920
Let me come with you.

40
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,320
Wait for me here.

41
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,040
You okay, Ai Phu?

42
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:55,360
Are you alright?

43
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,960
We’re here for you.

44
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Dude, say something!

45
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,160
Don’t worry about Phu.
He’s with me.

46
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:15,200
Don't forget about our deal.

47
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,440
Just wait for it.

48
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:23,640
What are you doing?

49
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,520
Wow, one message and
the whole gang goes silent.

50
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,680
But at least they’ll stop being worried.

51
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:37,159
Anyway, you used my phone without asking.

52
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,520
So, can I use your phone?

53
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,120
You can’t just ask after you did it.

54
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,400
But I ask every time.

55
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
That’s not the same thing.

56
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,920
I’m not talking to you anymore.

57
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,680
So, where were you just now?

58
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:53,920
Oh.

59
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,120
Have you ever ridden a tuk-tuk?

60
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Tuk-tuk?

61
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,280
You okay, P’ Cir?

62
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,520
This is a piece of cake.

63
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:31,480
I didn’t expect to see this side
of you, given how perfect you are.

64
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:33,840
What a tight grip.
Afraid to lose it?

65
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:38,640
It’s not going anywhere.
No need to grip it that tight.

66
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,040
Stop it.

67
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:00,640
Hainanese Chicken Rice

68
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,880
Give me this one, please.

69
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:52,400
P’ Cir, this place is super tasty.

70
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,920
Only two more stops.
We’re almost done.

71
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,840
But let’s grab some noodles here first.

72
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,480
Are you hungry?

73
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,120
Not really, but...

74
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,040
Just a little.

75
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,600
I’m fine, don’t worry.

76
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,440
Well, let’s just say I’m hungry.

77
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:45,800
We need to buy from here anyway,
so might as well eat here too.

78
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,960
Feels like I’m torturing a young master.

79
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:53,880
Come on, let’s get inside.

80
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:01,920
Rolled Rice Noodles in Clear Broth
Auntie, I’m turning up the fan.

81
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,320
Feeling better?

82
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,760
I told you I'm fine.

83
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,800
If being soaked in
sweat is fine, then sure.

84
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,800
Do I look that bad?

85
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:29,160
I guess.

86
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:34,360
Only two more places left.

87
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,800
We’ll grab noodles here,
then get some radish cakes.

88
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,760
That’ll wrap up today’s mission.

89
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,160
But we’ll have to see
if the shop’s even open.

90
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:49,560
The auntie there only
sells when she feels like it.

91
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:51,800
Her shop’s in that alley.

92
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:57,520
It’s a gamble every year whether
I’ll get offerings for my dad.

93
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,440
Sometimes I even have to owe him.

94
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,000
And if I had to make them myself…

95
00:11:03,840 --> 00:11:05,800
Well, I can already see the disaster.

96
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:10,920
Are you tired, P’ Cir?

97
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:16,080
This is nothing.
I want to do this.

98
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:19,920
I respect your dad, even
though we never knew each other.

99
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,960
More than I respect my own dad.

100
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,000
Here you go.

101
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,960
- Thank you.
- Wow.

102
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:41,640
Here, P’ Cir, try it.

103
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,800
This noodle shop was my dad’s favorite.

104
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,880
He liked the peppery aroma ‘cause
it made the broth go down smoothly.

105
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,760
Even when he was sick, he kept
complaining that he wanted it.

106
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:56,880
My mom had to bring
me here to buy it for him.

107
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,760
Even though he couldn’t eat it.

108
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:07,920
Do you do this every year?

109
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,360
Well, since my dad passed, yeah.

110
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,200
He passed away when I was in junior high.

111
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,920
After that, my mom barely
came back to Thailand.

112
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:24,520
I have two aunts, my eldest
aunt and my second aunt.

113
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,160
At first, both of them
wanted to take me in.

114
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,120
But my second aunt already had a family.

115
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,160
So I decided to live with my
eldest aunt until I went to university.

116
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,360
When I got to university

117
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,640
I told her that I’d do
everything on my own.

118
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,920
Since then, I’ve had to
wake up early every year

119
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,120
to buy my dad’s favorite food
and snacks, and some flowers.

120
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
Wait here, I’ll be right back.

121
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:28,840
At least drink something
sweet to boost your energy.

122
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,360
I hope green tea’s fine.

123
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:07,480
Boiled chicken, garlic chives cakes

124
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,840
steamed buns, mung bean pudding

125
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:13,160
rolled rice noodles, radish cakes.

126
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
And…

127
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,280
You’re missing flowers, right?

128
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,440
Did I buy the wrong ones?

129
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,280
No, it’s right.

130
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,800
Do you do this every year?

131
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:42,320
Does that mean,
in the world you came from

132
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,960
my dad’s gone too?

133
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:52,200
Why does Phukan in that world
have P’ Cir, but not Phukan in this one?

134
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,040
Phu.

135
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:57,840
Even though his dad’s no
longer with him, he still has you.

136
00:14:58,200 --> 00:14:59,480
What about me?

137
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,800
Phukan.

138
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,520
Never mind.

139
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,320
I was just kidding.

140
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,080
I just wanted to say it.

141
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:20,720
That’s all.

142
00:15:29,560 --> 00:15:30,840
It’s really nothing, P’ Cir.

143
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,120
I’m just feeling a bit sensitive today.

144
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:39,360
Let’s go, it’s getting really hot.

145
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,520
Phu.

146
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,360
I may not be able to change the past.

147
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,720
But from now on,
I'll always be here for you.

148
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,440
Do you really mean it?

149
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,880
You’re not lying to me, right?

150
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
I promise.

151
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:31,080
Get here at 12:30.
Don’t be late, don’t bail. Urgent.

152
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:33,240
What the hell? Why aren’t
you answering the phone?

153
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:34,920
And what kind of bullshit is this?

154
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,320
I’ve known you my whole life, so
why are you stingy with your words?

155
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,680
Jeez. Afraid your saliva will
turn into gold or something?

156
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,680
What the hell am I,
your slave, Ai Cir?

157
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,560
Urgent. Urgent my ass.

158
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,520
So why the hell am I following
his order? It’s my day off.

159
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:54,840
Sorry.

160
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
You little bastard.

161
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:01,080
I don't think my height
qualifies as 'little'.

162
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,720
- How did you get here?
- I sent P' Cir the location.

163
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,200
What did you say?

164
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,600
- I said—
- Not that.

165
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,720
What I mean is, why did you
send the location to Ai Cir?

166
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,640
Why did he tell me to come here?

167
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,800
And what do you mean by ‘urgent’?

168
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,040
Of course, it’s urgent.

169
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:17,880
The movie I told you about
only has one show left.

170
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,760
And it’s in…

171
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,960
15 minutes.

172
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,120
Huh?

173
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,880
That’s why I said it’s urgent.

174
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:27,600
Let’s go, I’ve got the tickets.

175
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,040
I told you I’m not going.

176
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,160
Even if you use Ai Cir to
threaten me, I’m still not going.

177
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,000
Ai Cir actually sold me out?

178
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:49,920
Someone who can’t think
about anything but Phukan

179
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,040
tricked me into coming here?

180
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,760
Impossible. No way.

181
00:18:53,240 --> 00:18:55,920
It just doesn’t make any sense at all.

182
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,400
And you know what makes the least sense?

183
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:01,920
How the hell did I end up sitting here?

184
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:06,360
Someone like this damn kid
made Ai Cir do what he said?

185
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,880
There’s no fucking way.

186
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,880
I’ve been friends with him my whole life.

187
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,760
I can't even ask him to do
what he doesn't want to.

188
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:16,600
But this kid got Ai Cir to trick me
into watching a movie with him?

189
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:19,520
Ugh, did he make a deal
with the Devil or something?

190
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:20,680
I wanna make one too.

191
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:28,680
Two Days Ago

192
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,080
Dream on.
Even if you chained me up

193
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,640
I still wouldn’t watch
a movie with you.

194
00:19:40,800 --> 00:19:42,120
He won’t go with you?

195
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:45,800
That’s right. I’ve been
asking him for a few days now.

196
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,240
It’s a movie he wants to see.

197
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,640
Stop reading people’s minds.

198
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,160
I can’t stop it. I can hear as
soon as they’re within my range.

199
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,600
You’re the only exception, though.

200
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,160
What?

201
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,560
You and your friend are complete opposites.

202
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,080
Your mind is complete blank.

203
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,880
While his mind races annoyingly fast.

204
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
Something like that.

205
00:20:23,560 --> 00:20:24,560
Help me with something.

206
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,520
No. Ai Wim is my friend.

207
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,480
The anniversary of
Ai Phu's dad is in two days.

208
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,000
He gets gloomy every year.

209
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,840
He can go buy offerings for
his dad on his own in the morning.

210
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,240
But by evening, he’ll call
and ask us to stay with him.

211
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:54,760
All night.

212
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,040
This year, I’ll make sure
no one goes to his place.

213
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:02,360
Where?

214
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:03,720
Sorry?

215
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,720
Where do you want Ai Wim to go?
Just send me the location.

216
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,520
What’s so fucking funny?

217
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:18,920
We’re not alone here.

218
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:29,800
Cheese flavor.
You should like it.

219
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,440
Focus on the movie.

220
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,240
Or you'll miss the story.

221
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,200
You can yell at me after this.

222
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,840
It's spilled.

223
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,760
You’re really clumsy.

224
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:24,000
Shit, what’s wrong with me?

225
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,480
Why am I getting goosebumps?

226
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:31,200
Why are my cheeks burning?

227
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,680
And why is my heart racing?
Did I not get enough sleep?

228
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,760
Ugh, what’s wrong with you, Ai Wim?

229
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,240
P’ Cir, this is my house.

230
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,880
I lived here until high school.

231
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,240
Come on, let’s get inside.

232
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,000
I don’t come here much anymore

233
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:51,520
but my mom has someone clean it every week.

234
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,200
I guarantee it’s spotless.

235
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,280
Phu.

236
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,200
You don’t have to force yourself to smile.

237
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,560
If you feel like crying,
you can cry with me.

238
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:15,320
You don’t have to hold it in
when you’re in front of me.

239
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,240
I don’t want anyone to worry.

240
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
But I want to.

241
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:28,040
I don’t want anyone to know
I’m still not over it.

242
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,320
But I already know that.

243
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,640
And I don’t want my mom to worry, either.

244
00:24:37,680 --> 00:24:41,720
But do you really think
your mom doesn’t know?

245
00:24:46,760 --> 00:24:47,800
Phu.

246
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:50,360
I’m here for you.

247
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,440
I don't get it, but I have to pretend I do.

248
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,480
When my dad passed

249
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,400
he wanted to be cremated
and have his ashes scattered.

250
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,680
I didn’t agree with it at all.

251
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,200
I wanted to keep his ashes close

252
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,800
so I could visit him whenever I wanted.

253
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:31,360
But my mom followed his wishes.

254
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,160
I just don’t get why we had to do that.

255
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:37,560
Why couldn’t he have left me
at least something of his?

256
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:39,840
But I understand him.

257
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:46,240
He probably wanted Mama
and me to let go and move on.

258
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:51,840
But I’m still sad and
heartbroken by what he did.

259
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:57,160
And I know Mama is crying alone now.

260
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,640
Not a single year have I been okay.

261
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,240
Not even once.

262
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,400
You've done so well.

263
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:12,040
You're the best at this.

264
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,800
Let me be weak for just a moment.

265
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,440
I’ll go back to smiling
for my dad like I always do.

266
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,080
Take all the time you need.

267
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:46,520
Why are you standing here, Phu?

268
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:51,920
And who’s this?

269
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,560
P’ Thorn.

270
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,120
How did you get here, P’ Thorn?

271
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,680
Mom asked me to brought you some food.

272
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,720
Actually, she asked me to check
on you because she’s worried.

273
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:35,240
I figured you'd want to be
alone with Uncle on this day.

274
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,000
That’s why I didn’t
expect to see anyone else.

275
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,160
Oh, I forgot to introduce you.

276
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:53,280
P’ Cir, this is P’ Thorn, my cousin.

277
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:56,840
He’s the son of my
second aunt I told you about.

278
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:04,960
So… P’ Thorn, this is P’ Cir,
a senior at my university.

279
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,800
- And…
- Phu’s boyfriend.

280
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,760
From the look on my little cousin’s face

281
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:19,720
I don’t think that’s the case.

282
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,320
And don’t speak thoughtlessly
in front of my uncle.

283
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:33,280
You see, P’ Thorn, technically
he’s my boyfriend, but…

284
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:38,960
Maybe not now,
but I will be in the future.

285
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:43,000
And I’m not afraid to say it right here.

286
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,960
So how have you been?

287
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:56,760
You haven’t stopped by lately.
Everyone’s been really missing you.

288
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:02,560
I've been really busy lately,
so I haven’t had time to stop by.

289
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:04,960
Has Auntie been missing me?

290
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,240
You’re her favorite nephew after all.

291
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:12,000
Then, please tell Auntie
that I’m doing well.

292
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:13,560
Really well.

293
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:18,600
And I’ll stop by if I have time
because I miss Thanya as well.

294
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:22,360
Ai Tharn’s gonna be upset if he hears that.

295
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:27,720
He’s too wrapped up
in his boyfriend to miss me.

296
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,680
You can say that again.

297
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,080
Are you okay?

298
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,040
I’d like to talk to Papa.

299
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,360
Then I’ll wait outside.

300
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,520
Can I have a moment alone with my dad?

301
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,840
Let me know when you're done.

302
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:36,520
Papa, this year has been really lively.

303
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,400
You have many people visiting you.

304
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:46,560
Pa…

305
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:50,440
What should I do?

306
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:55,520
I think...

307
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,920
I've fallen in love.

308
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:15,720
How did I end up eating with him?

309
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,760
A meal should come after a movie.

310
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:25,880
You haven’t eaten since morning, have you?

311
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:28,920
You can read my mind?

312
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,720
I can tell what you think
by looking at your face.

313
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,120
Shall we call a truce?

314
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:47,480
Why should I do that?

315
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,840
I don’t think I’ve done
anything to upset you.

316
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:52,000
You’ve got the nerve to say that, prick.

317
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,000
You piss me off whenever we meet.

318
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,440
I’ve tried my best to be friendly with you

319
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,480
but when have you ever talked to me nicely?

320
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:01,600
You either walk away
or say some nonsense shit.

321
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,160
If you don’t wanna
give your friend's info

322
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,280
just tell me straight up.

323
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,160
Don’t pull this crap.
I don’t like it.

324
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,720
If I tell you straight up...

325
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:16,160
would you like me?

326
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,240
What kind of logic is that?

327
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,840
Then what if I tell you
the reason you're sitting here?

328
00:32:29,800 --> 00:32:30,800
Spill it.

329
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:34,200
Promise me first that if I tell you

330
00:32:34,840 --> 00:32:36,320
you'll watch a movie with me again.

331
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:37,560
Just fucking tell me.

332
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,560
I made a deal with P’ Cir.

333
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:45,120
If he got you to watch a movie with me

334
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,240
I’d keep everyone away
from the two of them.

335
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,760
What the duck?

336
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,080
My friend wouldn’t do this to me.

337
00:32:58,720 --> 00:32:59,720
Don’t believe him.

338
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,760
Hey, Ai Cir. Did you really
sell me out to this bastard?

339
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:10,720
Now, make me happy and tell me
that you didn’t use me as a trade.

340
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:14,680
I’ve known you for so long.
You wouldn't do this to me, right?

341
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:17,840
Yeah, I sold you out.

342
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,400
Shall we plan our next movie date?

343
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:46,880
Can we talk for a sec?

344
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:50,560
Sure.

345
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,520
Did you mean what you said?

346
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:57,720
About what?

347
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,440
About dating Phu.

348
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,360
I’m serious.

349
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,760
Do you know why no one
from our family came today?

350
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:15,560
No.

351
00:34:16,880 --> 00:34:19,239
We haven’t forgotten
about my uncle’s passing.

352
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,120
My mom’s still mourning.

353
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,760
We all are.

354
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,080
But today is the day
Phu wants to be alone with his dad.

355
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:35,719
It’s become an unspoken rule...

356
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:38,960
that we don’t disturb him.

357
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,480
All these years, aside from our family

358
00:34:45,679 --> 00:34:47,440
Phu’s never brought
anyone to visit his dad.

359
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:50,480
So I want to know exactly who you are.

360
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,840
I’m someone who wants to take care of Phu.

361
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:02,440
He wouldn’t have brought
you here if that’s all you were.

362
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:09,680
You know what?

363
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:12,520
It won’t be easy.

364
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:17,800
Then I’ll prove it.

365
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,240
Don’t Let Phu down.

366
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,400
I can’t promise that.

367
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:34,280
Because I’m not sure
if my actions will let him down.

368
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:39,520
But I promise I’ll always be by his side.

369
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:45,920
You’d better keep your word.

370
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,840
Trust me, you don’t want
us siblings to join forces.

371
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,480
He’ll probably sneak off
to cry again today.

372
00:36:04,920 --> 00:36:06,000
Comfort him for me.

373
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:08,080
I have to go now.

374
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,320
You're leaving already?

375
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:11,840
Well, he has someone
new to comfort him now.

376
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
I suppose this big cousin
isn’t needed anymore.

377
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,280
Wait.

378
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,800
Why do you trust me?

379
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:30,680
Because you’re standing here today.

380
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,800
Your big cousin has left.

381
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:15,520
P’ Thorn must have realized
I’m not in the mood to talk.

382
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:29,240
You know, P’ Cir?

383
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:35,600
My dad was the kindest person in the world.

384
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,240
He was the coolest person in the world.

385
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,760
And he loved me the most in the world too.

386
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,320
I’ll never forget him.

387
00:37:57,000 --> 00:37:58,800
My mom will never forget him either.

388
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,520
Even if there’s nothing
left that belongs to him...

389
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:10,160
we still have countless memories of him.

390
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:17,440
That’s right.

391
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:22,080
Your dad loved you the most in the world.

392
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:33,280
So do I.

393
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,720
I also love Phu the most in the world.

394
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:41,520
I’ll take care of him from now on, Father.

395
00:38:44,120 --> 00:38:45,200
P’ Cir.

396
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,880
I haven’t introduced myself yet.

397
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:54,920
I’m Cir.

398
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,680
I’m Phu’s senior from high school.

399
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:06,000
Before I met Phu, I used
to think my life was empty.

400
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
No purpose.

401
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,040
No desire.

402
00:39:17,240 --> 00:39:21,720
Phu is the first person
who’s given my life a purpose.

403
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:27,080
That’s why I want to take care of him.

404
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,520
To be with him.

405
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:39,840
I’m far from being a good person.

406
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,360
I may be selfish at times.

407
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,400
But there’s one thing I can say for sure.

408
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,200
I love Phu.

409
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,200
I don’t want to leave him alone.

410
00:40:05,120 --> 00:40:06,920
I don’t want him to cry.

411
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,120
Or feel lonely.

412
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:20,480
I promise I’ll take the best care of him.

413
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:25,560
You can rest easy now.

414
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,680
I love you, Phu.

415
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,360
I love you.

416
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:08,440
A little more. Just a little longer.

417
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,120
Let me be with this man
for just a little longer.

418
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,040
When should we watch the next movie?

419
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:29,840
Are you deaf or what?
I told you I’m not going.

420
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:33,560
You don’t have classes on Wednesday, right?

421
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,080
How many times do I have to turn you down?

422
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,880
And I haven’t dealt with
you yet for tricking me.

423
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,200
And Ai Cir too.

424
00:41:41,520 --> 00:41:43,920
Damn it.
If I see him on Monday

425
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,640
I swear I’m gonna kick his ass.

426
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,040
You think I won’t do it?

427
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:51,640
You know what?

428
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:54,600
I’ve helped him so much,
and look at how he repays me.

429
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:56,720
He sold me out like I’m nothing.

430
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,440
This is so unfair.

431
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:13,440
Damn… so soft.
His lips are so fucking soft.

432
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,920
You! Why did you kiss me?

433
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,960
I’m hitting on you.

434
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:22,360
Huh?

435
00:42:24,760 --> 00:42:28,400
You were oblivious, so I had
to make things more obvious.

436
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:34,080
I’m leaving now.
See you Monday.

437
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,120
Hitting on me my ass.

438
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,320
What the hell is wrong with my heart?

439
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:57,520
Ai Wim, you must be out of your mind.

440
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:01,400
Your heart's skipping
a beat over that jerk?

441
00:43:47,720 --> 00:43:48,720
You must be hungry.

442
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Take a seat.

443
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:22,720
Guys, I’m leaving.

444
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:23,920
Oh.

445
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,640
Look at your friend.
So fucking naïve.

446
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,600
Come on, let’s grab some food.

447
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,480
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

448
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:34,960
Good job, Jin.

449
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,160
Phu.

450
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,720
Phu.

451
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,600
Why are you spacing out?

452
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,080
It’s dark already?

453
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,720
I got lost in thought.

454
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:10,960
Have you eaten yet?
Are you hungry?

455
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:12,520
Should we get takeout?

456
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:15,640
Now I’m feeling hungry all of a sudden.

457
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,760
Let’s order some food.

458
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,000
It’s been so long since I cleaned you.

459
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,480
Are you okay, Phu?

460
00:46:51,360 --> 00:46:52,360
Yeah.

461
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:57,240
You’ve been lost in thought a lot lately.

462
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,960
I’m just thinking about my dad.

463
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:07,840
I’m like this around this time of year.
You should be used to it by now.

464
00:47:11,360 --> 00:47:12,600
This flute…

465
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:16,520
It’s my dad’s keepsake.

466
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:21,960
Oh, I’m sure you already know that.

467
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,240
But I don’t know how to play it.

468
00:47:26,040 --> 00:47:29,400
My dad had wanted to teach me,
but I didn’t want to learn.

469
00:47:29,880 --> 00:47:33,280
Now that he’s gone,
I can’t learn it on my own.

470
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,240
So all I can do is keep it
and take it out to clean.

471
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:43,440
My dad loved playing the flute so much

472
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:44,720
that he played it every day.

473
00:47:45,120 --> 00:47:47,640
Because he met my mom in a marching band.

474
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:52,400
He’d play love songs for her every day.

475
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,280
To win her heart.

476
00:47:56,560 --> 00:47:57,600
Isn't that just romantic?

477
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,280
Mind if I borrow it?

478
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,160
From now on...

479
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:30,320
I’ll be the one playing the flute for you.

480
00:49:34,400 --> 00:49:36,160
How could you do this to me, P’ Cir?

481
00:49:38,320 --> 00:49:39,600
What am I gonna do now?

482
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:43,880
You don’t have to do anything.

483
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:50,120
Just let me stay right here beside you.

484
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,600
Remember.
You’re the only Phukan I have.

485
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:44,520
Phu.

486
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,360
Why did you turn off your phone?

487
00:52:46,560 --> 00:52:47,760
And why didn’t you wake me up?

488
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:57,640
What’s the matter?

489
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:03,840
I can’t ask to prolong
this any longer, P’ Cir.

490
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:06,480
What do you mean?

491
00:53:08,680 --> 00:53:09,960
You need to go back.

492
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,920
Why, Phu?

493
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:16,880
You need to go back.

494
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:19,840
Back to that Phukan.

495
00:53:19,880 --> 00:53:21,000
I can’t go back.

496
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:24,760
There has to be a way to
bring you back to that Phukan.

497
00:53:25,320 --> 00:53:26,320
I’ll help you.

498
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,840
I’ll do whatever it takes
to get you back to that world.

499
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:32,720
Because you have to go back.

500
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:39,680
Do you... want to send me away already?

501
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:42,480
I don’t want to.

502
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:44,720
But I have to.

503
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,200
Why is that?

504
00:53:48,640 --> 00:53:51,320
Because the one you love
is the other Phukan.

505
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:53,600
The one who’s been
with you for four years.

506
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:57,480
The one you said you wanted
to protect isn’t this Phukan.

507
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:00,480
I’m hurting so much.

508
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:05,800
If we're alike, with the same
thoughts and personality

509
00:54:06,600 --> 00:54:09,920
then I know better than anyone
that he's crying right now

510
00:54:10,320 --> 00:54:11,640
from losing his lover.

511
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:15,000
I’ve already lost my dad.

512
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:18,160
I know exactly how it
feels to lose someone.

513
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:21,960
If someone I love appeared
in front of me one day

514
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:24,080
and told me we don't know each other

515
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:26,720
have never spoken,
or have no relationship whatsoever

516
00:54:27,600 --> 00:54:29,560
how do you think I’d feel?

517
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:31,440
Imagine how devastated I’d be.

518
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:39,280
I can’t love you.
I’m not supposed to.

519
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:42,800
Phu, please listen to me.

520
00:54:43,520 --> 00:54:45,760
- No.
- There’s something I need to tell you.

521
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,080
The truth is…

522
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,280
I won’t hear it.

523
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,560
Phu, I need to tell you something.

524
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:54,480
Not now, P’ Cir.

525
00:54:57,320 --> 00:54:58,440
I’m not ready.

526
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:02,480
I need time to think.

527
00:55:04,360 --> 00:55:05,360
I’m begging you.

528
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:09,120
I...

529
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,280
I’ll listen...

530
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,000
when I’m ready.

531
00:55:16,840 --> 00:55:17,840
Please.

532
00:55:48,360 --> 00:55:49,480
You’re an idiot, Ai Phu.

533
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,640
You love him, but he’s not yours.

534
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,320
Phu!

535
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:30,720
P’ Cir!

536
00:56:31,040 --> 00:56:33,240
No, no, no, P’ Cir, wake up, P’ Cir!

537
00:56:34,440 --> 00:56:37,600
Shit, we ran over the wrong guy.
That’s Khun Rames.

538
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:39,720
P’ Cir!

539
00:56:40,840 --> 00:56:42,960
Stay with me.
Don’t leave me, P’ Cir.

540
00:56:46,920 --> 00:56:48,960
P’ Cir!

541
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,280
EP VII: The Third Cirrus

542
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,360
You’re awake, P’ Cir?

543
00:57:24,520 --> 00:57:25,640
Are you hurt anywhere?

544
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:28,120
Are you okay?

545
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:48,080
Who are you?

546
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,200
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

547
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:03,840
We met again.

548
00:58:04,280 --> 00:58:06,600
The doctor told me that Cirrus might have dementia.

549
00:58:07,080 --> 00:58:07,960
Rames.

550
00:58:09,080 --> 00:58:11,400
Lukprae, your fiancée.

551
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:14,640
He doesn’t even recognize me.
He doesn’t know what we are.

552
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,240
I don't even know if he's still the same P' Cir I used to know.

553
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,240
Let me go!

554
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,360
I need to go see Phu right now!

555
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:21,880
You can’t go anywhere.

556
00:58:21,880 --> 00:58:25,720
You have to wait for the other Cirrus come back to his world.
