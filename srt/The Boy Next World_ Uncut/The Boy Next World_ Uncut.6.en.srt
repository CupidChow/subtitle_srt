1
00:00:10,600 --> 00:00:12,640
Why were you late, P’ Cir?

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:13,960
I’m sorry.

3
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:18,800
Who are you?
You’re not P’ Cir.

4
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,480
Time to wake up.

5
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,080
You’re the reason I want
to fight for the first time.

6
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:30,280
Don’t you dare, Ai Phu.

7
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:31,840
Keep in mind.

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,400
You’re just the substitute.

9
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,880
- Khun Sisira.
- Yes?

10
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,480
Khun Rames’ mother wants to
know how much money you’d want…

11
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,600
…to break up with her son.

12
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,840
How about saving your money
for heart disease patients?

13
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,360
Maybe it’ll make your hearts nobler.

14
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,840
What kind of family is this?
And she still calls herself a mother?

15
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
What kind of family does this?

16
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,440
Sawasdee krub.

17
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:45,120
Someone please tell me
what the hell day this is.

18
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,960
Why are random people
showing up out of nowhere?

19
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,480
EP VI: The Meaning of Family

20
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,320
Ai Cir, something’s been bugging me.

21
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,200
No.

22
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,240
Ai Cir, how long have
you and I been friends?

23
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,200
You can do the math yourself.

24
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:11,920
If you know me this well

25
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,440
then you must know what I'm thinking.

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Ai Cir.

27
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,440
Ai Cir.

28
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Ai Cir.

29
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,600
Phu and I are together.

30
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,520
Since when?

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:46,120
- In my dream.
- What?

32
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:47,880
In your dream?

33
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,720
- You’re saying you’re his boyfriend—
- In my dreams.

34
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,960
Yes, I dreamed about it.

35
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,120
Ai Wim.

36
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,920
If you like someone so much
that you dream about them

37
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,920
seeing them as your lover

38
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,880
seeing yourself being
with them since high school

39
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,800
experiencing happiness
you never dared to dream of...

40
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,480
what would you do?

41
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,880
So that's why you said he was
your boyfriend when you woke up.

42
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,480
Wait a minute.

43
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,840
Don’t tell me you actually told
him that, and he believed you?

44
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,520
No, I didn’t tell him about the dream.

45
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:48,320
Shit.

46
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,080
Don’t tell me that you told
him you’re from a parallel world.

47
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:03,920
Ai Cir.

48
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
Hi there.

49
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,640
Hey! Why are you with Phu, Ai Zone?

50
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:42,600
Why are you here?

51
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,880
I heard about Mom.

52
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,360
You know that Dad and I are
keeping an eye on her secretary.

53
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,840
Does Dad even care?

54
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:52,360
Brother.

55
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,200
But you shouldn’t have approached Phu.

56
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,440
I was just worried.

57
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,040
P’ Cir.

58
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,120
I’m fine.

59
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,000
Why don’t you come in?

60
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:26,600
Hey, wait for me!
You can’t just leave me out of this.

61
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,840
Are you okay, Phu?

62
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,840
It’s my mom, right?

63
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,120
What happened?

64
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:54,000
Mom sent someone to deal with Phu.

65
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,920
She sent someone to ask how much
money he’d want to break up with you.

66
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,520
What?

67
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:06,560
Damn it, I fucking knew someone
like her wouldn’t just stay put.

68
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,000
I think Mom’s targeting Phu.

69
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,800
Why do you think that?

70
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:24,960
You know that this guy is
Ai Cir’s younger brother, right?

71
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:26,600
As for that hag—

72
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,680
Uh, no.

73
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,280
Uh, their mother’s a total psycho.

74
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,600
Back when their parents still loved
each other, she was already crazy.

75
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:39,559
She treated their dad like
he was her personal property.

76
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,039
He couldn’t do anything or talk to anyone.

77
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,520
But he put up with it.

78
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,680
Well, until...

79
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,320
Mom harassed our elementary school teacher

80
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,080
until she committed suicide.

81
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,800
Is being just a teacher not
enough to make ends meet

82
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,240
that you have to spread your legs
for someone else’s husband?

83
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:19,000
In public, you're committed to education.

84
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:24,360
But how many parents have you
sold yourself to behind closed doors?

85
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,640
That's not true. I’d never do that.

86
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:27,840
Really?

87
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,880
Are you saying what I saw isn’t true?

88
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,760
Since you dare to mess
with someone like me.

89
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:36,760
Get up. Now.

90
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:43,360
You really want to know
what hell is like, don’t you?

91
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,880
That hag incited the parent
association, bribed the school.

92
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,040
Sawasdee ka, take care on your way home.

93
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,040
Prink, you bitch. Whore!

94
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:57,360
You’ve got me, but you’re
still whoring yourself out!

95
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,760
What are you talking about?
Who are you?

96
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,480
But their dad knew nothing about it.

97
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,200
He thought that if he
never saw the teacher again

98
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,000
that hag would calm down.

99
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,280
The fuck are you looking at!

100
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,560
Are you curious? Then I’ll tell you.

101
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:14,680
This bitch is a fucking whore!

102
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:16,840
You better watch your husbands!

103
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,120
No, it’s not like that.

104
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,600
It’s not what you think.
It’s not true.

105
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,760
No.

106
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,360
But…

107
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,600
We can’t let a hooker teach our children.

108
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,760
Send her back to the brothel.

109
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
Even as a teacher, she’s still a whore.

110
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,760
The principal should take care of this.

111
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:35,760
Resignation Letter

112
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:45,360
He only found out later when...

113
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,520
the teacher was longer in this world.

114
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,120
That’s when Uncle said he wanted a divorce.

115
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,720
So what happened next?
Did P’ Cir’s mom agree to it?

116
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:11,760
You think she would? She
went nuts and attacked these two.

117
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:14,440
Ordering people to beat her
own kids in front of their dad.

118
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:18,800
And she was satisfied seeing
him unable to do anything.

119
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:21,520
She declared that if he wanted a divorce

120
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,680
he had to leave one of them with her.

121
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,840
But you know what the one left
behind has to go through, right?

122
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
So…

123
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Your dad chose P’ Zone.

124
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,800
He made the right choice.

125
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,040
Zone’s younger than me.

126
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:54,400
But just because you're older doesn’t
mean you're stronger or tougher.

127
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:56,880
You were only eight years old.

128
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
I’m okay.

129
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Alright.

130
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,440
You can probably imagine what
that hag is capable of by now.

131
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,960
She doesn’t see Ai Cir as her son.

132
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
He’s merely a tool for revenge.

133
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,080
Just a showpiece for her status.

134
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,480
I bet you can’t imagine
what Ai Cir had to bargain for

135
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,240
just to get out and live on his own.

136
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,600
What did you trade for that?

137
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,760
My entire life’s freedom.

138
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,560
What does it mean?

139
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,920
It means he traded
his four years of university

140
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,840
for the rest of his life.

141
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:54,800
After graduation, he’s got
no right to disobey anymore.

142
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:57,880
Damn it, how could you accept that, Ai Cir?

143
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,640
You’re not an eight-year-old anymore!

144
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,000
Fight back, damn it!

145
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:02,920
I agree with P’ Wim.

146
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,720
Things are different now.

147
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:07,880
And Dad has changed as well.

148
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:10,720
Negotiating is useless.

149
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,560
- But I think—
- Zone.

150
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,880
No, I don’t agree with you.

151
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:19,880
You have your own life.

152
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,960
You can live your life.
No need to give it up for anyone.

153
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,320
When my dad passed away

154
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:32,680
he told me that he wanted me
to live the happiest life I could.

155
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,120
Because my life is mine to live.

156
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,760
He said not to get stuck in sorrow.

157
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,920
You too, P’ Cir.

158
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,240
You have to live a happy life.

159
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,320
You can’t just throw it away.

160
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
I’m okay.

161
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,560
I’m so frustrated.

162
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,000
I’m frustrated for you.

163
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
Thank you.

164
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,640
It might’ve been useless
back then, but not now.

165
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,000
What are you trying to say?

166
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:30,200
I never had a purpose in life.

167
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,480
Until I met Phu.

168
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:43,600
If I hadn’t met you in high school

169
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,320
I wouldn’t have had
the guts to leave that house.

170
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
And I won’t go back.

171
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,520
Because I have someone I want to be with.

172
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:00,480
What can I do to help you?

173
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
Why don’t you just date Ai Cir?

174
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:17,200
Well, if you want to rebel,
then rebel all the way.

175
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,720
Make your mom restless.

176
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,280
And things aren’t the same as
back then. Times have changed.

177
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,840
She can’t just do whatever
she wants anymore.

178
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,600
She’s got money, and so do you.

179
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,720
If she dares to hire people,
then hire some back.

180
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,840
Lure her out to make
her show her real intentions.

181
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,640
I can't use Phu as bait.

182
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,240
Why not?

183
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:40,440
Do you realize what you just said?

184
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:45,320
Of course, I know I’m
making myself a bigger target.

185
00:15:45,840 --> 00:15:48,880
But so what? Why should I be afraid?

186
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,920
I agree with P’ Wim.

187
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:55,040
Let’s show her that
you have your own life too.

188
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:59,880
And honestly, I’m so pissed
she threw money at me like that.

189
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:02,280
- Phu.
- Don’t ‘Phu’ me.

190
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,640
I really like your brother’s boyfriend.

191
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,040
I’m with you on that one.

192
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:25,640
Next time, give me a
heads-up before you come.

193
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:29,680
Worried about the one upstairs?

194
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:34,080
I always just show up.
Never call ahead before.

195
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
At least you’re aware.

196
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,160
Even if you’re my brother,
I won’t give him to you.

197
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,080
P’ Cir.

198
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,880
Dad worries about you.

199
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:59,280
Then go tell him not to worry.

200
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,600
Are you still mad at him?

201
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,920
You know that he’s always
felt guilty about what happened.

202
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
Especially about you.

203
00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,800
Tell him to get over it already.

204
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,040
It’s been years now.

205
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:27,000
- Can’t you just get mad at me instead?
- Zone.

206
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,320
If I were older than you,
or if I’d been born before you

207
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,320
you wouldn’t have had
to suffer at Mom’s hands.

208
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,320
Ozone.

209
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,240
Even if I were younger
or had been born after you

210
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,640
I’d never let you stay with that woman.

211
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,640
It’s better that it’s me.

212
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,680
Tell Dad that I’ll drop by if I have time.

213
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,280
It’s my turn now, Brother.

214
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,000
Are you mad at me, P’ Cir?

215
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:28,920
Because you were too impulsive.

216
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,480
I just wanted to help.

217
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,320
I can’t stand the way she’s treating you.

218
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,520
That’s not family.

219
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,440
To me, family wouldn’t do that.

220
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,960
But she’s capable of more than you think.

221
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
I’m not afraid.

222
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:49,920
P’ Wim said that after what
happened to your teacher

223
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,920
she hasn’t done
anything so blatantly since.

224
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,560
That’s true.

225
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:56,560
She lost a lot because of that.

226
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:01,760
But it’s a different matter from
you agreeing to Ai Wim’s offer.

227
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:04,040
What offer?

228
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:08,600
The one where I’m
supposed to live with you.

229
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:13,440
Well, P’ Wim said your mom might hire
someone to stay in the rooms next to ours.

230
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,920
If you want to convince her,
you’ll have to do what P’ Wim said.

231
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,600
Let’s go. You still
have to pack your stuff.

232
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,840
Since you guys are already a couple

233
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,280
why not just move in together?

234
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,200
That way, you wouldn’t have to
worry about someone hurting Phu.

235
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:36,920
I’m doing you a favor here, you know.

236
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,920
Let me help.

237
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:08,240
Are you really sure you
want me to stay here?

238
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Of course.

239
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
I guess.

240
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Stubborn.

241
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:17,040
Stubborn to help you.

242
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:23,720
If you keep this up, you'll lose
your virginity without realizing it.

243
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,280
You won’t do anything to me.

244
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:28,800
Right?

245
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:30,200
Did I do anything last time?

246
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:36,040
You said it was for nursing.

247
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,680
Now I’ll say we’re a couple.

248
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,200
So I guess I can... do it now.

249
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,360
Right?

250
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,160
Wait, P’Cir.

251
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,760
P' Cir, hold on.

252
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,760
Phukan.

253
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,040
Scared of me now?

254
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,000
Why should I be scared?
This is no big deal.

255
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,160
Go ahead. Go for it.

256
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:59,560
Come on. Just do it. Go ahead.

257
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,000
Stubborn kid.

258
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,200
Don’t cry later if it actually happens.

259
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,000
Can’t promise that.

260
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:21,640
I’ve never done it,
so I don’t know if it hurts.

261
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,920
I might cry because it hurts.

262
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,680
I’ll sleep on the couch.

263
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:48,800
But… the bed’s warmer.

264
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,480
Watch yourself tonight, stubborn kid.

265
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,280
I’m not afraid.

266
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,640
You were afriad to hurt me
when you flicked my forehead.

267
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:00,920
So you won’t do anything to me.

268
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,880
Can’t sleep.

269
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,200
Not sleepy yet?

270
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:17,400
Can I sit with you?

271
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:21,120
No.

272
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,040
I’ll do it for real this time.

273
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:34,640
But I can’t sleep.

274
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,320
When did you remove it?

275
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,600
Since I moved, there's
no point in leaving it there.

276
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:08,000
Go to bed already.

277
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:15,760
Fine.

278
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,440
I’m not sleepy.

279
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,640
If you wake up in the morning

280
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:06,640
And find a big bouquet of flowers

281
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:12,560
You have no idea who it belongs to

282
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:16,280
Don’t be surprised

283
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,920
Because it belongs to you

284
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,120
At night before bed

285
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:30,560
A number you’re not familiar with

286
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:36,760
Sends you an 'I miss you' message

287
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:39,520
With such gentle words

288
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:45,000
Wishing you sweet dreams and an early night

289
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,880
Don't worry that it went
to the wrong person

290
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:57,400
Don't guess, just accept it

291
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:03,440
Please don’t doubt my sincerity

292
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:09,240
It’s from the same person
you’re familiar with

293
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,600
The one who’s always
watched over you from afar

294
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:20,320
Do you remember?
That person still cares about you

295
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:25,760
You know who it is

296
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:35,920
My good boy.

297
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:40,000
Time to sleep.

00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:48,080

306
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
Let’s get started.

307
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,880
Hey, have you seen Ai Cir?

308
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,600
You’re asking me?

309
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,920
What am I, his bodyguard?

310
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,160
You’re basically like his mom,
but you don't even know.

311
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,240
Then how would I know?

312
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,840
Just ask me where Ai Cir is.

313
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:17,320
For what? I don’t even
wanna know, so why should I?

314
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:18,600
Are you crazy?

315
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,880
Just ask.

316
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:32,200
Fine. Where’s Ai Cir then?

317
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:37,080
He’s with his partner.

318
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,840
Huh? What?

319
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:42,480
- When did he get a partner?
- He’s taken?

320
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,360
Mission accomplished.

321
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:47,080
There was no sign at all.
This is so sudden.

322
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:50,960
Look at the fish’s round eyes. See?

323
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,840
Shit. What the fuck’s going on?

324
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:04,400
Ai Phu.

325
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:08,440
The delicate egg I’ve always
protected has been cracked open.

326
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:09,920
How did this happen?

327
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:20,520
Tasty?

328
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,040
Let me ask you again.

329
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:36,480
You’re really not afraid of my mom?

330
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,040
I’ll say it again.

331
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,760
No, I’m not afraid at all.

332
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,080
I may look soft, but I won’t
let anyone walk all over me.

333
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,760
I’m starting to get scared.

334
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:56,280
I don’t like picking fights with
anyone, but don’t start with me.

335
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,560
Especially with someone I lo—

336
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,320
Someone you…?

337
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,760
Shit.

338
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:08,080
I don’t believe it. I can't accept it.

339
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,440
Why were you talking to yourself?

340
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:13,240
Damn it, can’t you see?

341
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:16,400
Word’s out all over campus
that Phu’s got a boyfriend.

342
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,360
He knows I’m scared of P’ Cir
but still goes out with him.

343
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:21,200
What the hell?

344
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,440
Whose room do I run to now
when I need to lay low?

345
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:25,120
How could your friend do this?

346
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:26,520
Why is he so easy?

347
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,880
Why couldn’t he play hard to get?

348
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,200
I don’t get it. What the hell?

349
00:31:30,280 --> 00:31:32,400
Hey, we’re just as lost as you.

350
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,600
Jeez, you.

351
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:36,040
Oh?

352
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,560
- Lin, where are you going?
- Lin.

353
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:40,560
Well… Nalin.

354
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:44,480
Phu, I wanna ask you something.

355
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,440
Are you and P’ Cir really together?

356
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,000
Yes, we’re together.

357
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,560
What the fuck?!

358
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,880
My friend finally got his cherry popped.

359
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:17,960
Achi, it’d be great if you
could just shut the hell up.

360
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:20,440
Come here, Achi. Come.

361
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Ouch!

362
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:26,120
Look at your friend.

363
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,080
How could he be holding a guy’s hand

364
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:30,360
while publicly announcing that he’s taken?

365
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,080
He’s got no shame at all.

366
00:32:32,120 --> 00:32:34,880
Oh wow, you of all people giving lectures?

367
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,160
- You hit me again.
- Want me to go again?

368
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,320
I’m happy.

369
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:42,680
About what?

370
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,120
That you finally have
someone to take care of you.

371
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:52,960
I’m also happy that
P’ Wim’s found an excuse for me.

372
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Even if it’s just a fake
relationship, I don’t mind.

373
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:19,480
- Ai Wim!
- What the fuck?!

374
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,960
- The fuck was that for?
- I got you good, huh?

375
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,840
Where’s Ai Cir?

376
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:28,480
How would I know?
I’m done taking care of him.

377
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,520
If you wanna know, go ask his boyfriend.

378
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:34,560
You know, I’ve never
been this happy before.

379
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:37,440
Damn, that hag must be choking
on her own blood right now.

380
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,120
What was that? Hagfish?

381
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,720
By the way, do you know
what fish is the most musical?

382
00:33:45,160 --> 00:33:46,160
What fish?

383
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,240
A bass.

384
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,120
Ugh, what kind of fucking joke is that?

385
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,160
I didn’t say anything about fish.

386
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,600
What’s in your ears, wet wipes?

387
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,760
You can’t even make sense of what I said.

388
00:33:56,120 --> 00:33:58,280
If you’ve got time,
how about seeing a doctor?

389
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,480
I'll help pay for the ear checkup.

390
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:04,600
Nah, I went yesterday.
Couldn’t find one.

391
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:06,320
- Couldn't find what?
- The doctor.

392
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:10,040
Goddamn it, I can’t get anything
serious out of you, Ai Rome.

393
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,719
Why are you asking about Ai Cir?
What do you want from him?

394
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,159
If you’ve got a question,
go ask his boyfriend.

395
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:18,480
Shit, that’s right.

396
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,040
I haven't decided on a question.

397
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,159
Fucking hell.

398
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:25,920
Hey, Ai Wim.

399
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:27,800
Ai Wim.

400
00:34:28,199 --> 00:34:30,320
- What now?
- Ai Cir’s got a boyfriend?

401
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:34,400
Damn it, were you dunking your
head in a fishpond when I said that?

402
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,520
I literally announced it
right in front of you, asshole.

403
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,639
You’re still asking
if he’s got a boyfriend?

404
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,679
Yeah, he does.
And you better remember it.

405
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,239
Fuck, I’m going crazy.

406
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,639
Why can't any of my friends just be normal?

407
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,679
Since when?
Hey, where are you going?

408
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,360
It’s none of your business.

409
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,440
Just go home and watch
that damn lionfish of yours.

410
00:34:54,239 --> 00:34:55,239
What did I do wrong?

411
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:57,480
Ai Wim, don’t talk bad—
Ai Wim!

412
00:34:58,080 --> 00:34:59,760
Ai Wim, come back— Damn it.

413
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,240
There, there. It’s okay, my lionfish baby.

414
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:06,760
Why aren’t any of my friends
the least bit normal?

415
00:35:07,880 --> 00:35:09,560
One burden's gone, but another's left.

416
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,240
No, Ai Wim.

417
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:29,920
You can't just throw away your pride

418
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,680
and ask that asshole Rome to walk with you.

419
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:48,120
- Sawasdee krub.
- Oh, shit!

420
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,480
I thought you were a ghost!

421
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,280
You're happy to see me.

422
00:35:57,200 --> 00:35:58,280
What are you talking about?

423
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:00,440
Because I’m human, not a ghost.

424
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,160
That’s why you’re happy to see me.

425
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:05,080
Right?

426
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,280
Don’t act like you can read my mind.

427
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,720
I’m not.

428
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,760
Hey, wanna watch a movie next week?

429
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,960
There's an indie film coming out next week.

430
00:36:17,520 --> 00:36:18,840
But it’s only showing twice.

431
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:21,920
It’s not being promoted in Thailand.
If you miss it, you miss it.

432
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,360
I think you might like it.

433
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,240
How do you know I'd like it?
And why should I go with you?

434
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:32,160
When did we ever get close?

435
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:38,200
I’m Jin, and that’s both my
first name and nickname.

436
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,120
I'm a sophomore in Arts, 20 years old.

437
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,680
Blood type AB. Gray’s my favorite.

438
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,400
- Because it’s a mix of white—
- Hold on.

439
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:45,880
Why are you telling me this?

440
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,040
We don't know each other yet,
so I thought I'd introduce myself.

441
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,080
I didn’t ask for it.

442
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,240
You asked when we became close.

443
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:57,800
I'd say after this.

444
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:05,200
I’m not going.

445
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,400
We’re not even close,
so why should I go?

446
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:10,200
End of story.

447
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:11,880
Phu’s dating P’ Cir now.

448
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,080
I won’t have anyone to watch movies with.

449
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:23,480
If you don’t go with me,
I’ll have to invite Phu.

450
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,320
And I’m sure you know what he’s like.

451
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:35,680
No. Why should I go with you? No way.

452
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,520
What are you doing?

453
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,160
I’m going to walk you.
Aren’t you afraid of ghosts?

454
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,520
Don’t worry, I won’t
pester you anymore today.

455
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,440
Don’t tell me you’ll try again later.

456
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,440
Exactly what you think.

457
00:37:58,960 --> 00:37:59,960
Damn it.

458
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:16,360
Yay, it’s done!

459
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,160
Good job.

460
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:35,640
Praise me more, P’ Cir.

461
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,640
What do you want me to say?

462
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:45,480
Anything. I just want
you to praise me again.

463
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,720
My Phu is the best.

464
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,000
Let me ask you something.

465
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
What is it?

466
00:39:13,480 --> 00:39:17,520
If someone who cares a lot
about you and wants the best for you...

467
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:22,880
...lies to you, what would you do?

468
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,280
Are you lying to me?

469
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,760
I...

470
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:40,080
I’m just asking because I’m curious…

471
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,040
about what you think of liars.

472
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,960
Well, maybe you should reply first?

473
00:40:01,720 --> 00:40:07,040
I think I’ll go to bed now
so you can focus on the phone.

474
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:16,600
P’ Cir.

475
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,560
If the person who lies to me
is someone I care about

476
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:26,280
I have to admit that I’d be upset.

477
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,920
But I’d probably ask them why they lied.

478
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,560
And decide whether or not to be angry.

479
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:40,480
Good night.

480
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,000
Did you give my Line to Phu’s friend?

481
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,720
He won’t stop texting me.

482
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,640
Keeps asking me to go
watch a movie with him.

483
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,200
I told him I’m not going.

484
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:07,080
Did you tell him I like indie films?

485
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:08,800
Answer me, Ai Cir.

486
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,440
I’m really pissed, you know.

487
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:13,040
He texted me again.

488
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,760
Phu.

489
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
Wake up, Phu.

490
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,320
Phu, wake up.

491
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,320
Phu.

492
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:00,560
Are you okay?

493
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:02,920
I came in because I heard a sound.

494
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,000
It’s okay now.

495
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:17,760
It’s okay.

496
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,600
I’m here now, Phu.

497
00:42:39,480 --> 00:42:40,520
Feeling better?

498
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:45,720
I’m sorry.

499
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:47,680
Why are you apologizing to me?

500
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:51,520
I don’t know.

501
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:02,520
P’ Cir, I’m gonna wipe my eyes.

502
00:43:02,640 --> 00:43:05,040
Don’t do it.
Your eyes are all red.

503
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:11,080
- Let go, P’ Cir.
- No.

504
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,360
- Let go.
- No.

505
00:43:40,600 --> 00:43:41,880
Better now?

506
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:48,600
I dreamed about my dad.

507
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:50,720
What happened in the dream?

508
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:55,320
No idea. I can’t remember.

509
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:59,520
All I know is that around
the anniversary of his death

510
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,600
I always dream about him.

511
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:07,520
And when I wake up… I can’t stop crying.

512
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:09,920
I’ll feel lonely.

513
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:14,320
Like I'm the only one left in the world.

514
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,240
But this time, it’s different.

515
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:25,640
Thank you for being here.

516
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:11,400
You should go to bed.

517
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:15,200
Why?

518
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:20,240
I... might not be able to hold back.

519
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:43,560
Phu.

520
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:48,800
If I let you go, can you go
back to your room and sleep?

521
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:16,280
Phu.

522
00:47:22,720 --> 00:47:23,960
I think…

523
00:47:26,320 --> 00:47:27,520
I can help you.

524
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:30,760
Phukan.

525
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:50,960
I’ve already warned you.

526
00:47:55,120 --> 00:47:56,880
You’ve done it for me before.

527
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:03,240
I just… want to do it for you too.

528
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,120
Can I?

529
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
Teach me.

530
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:25,200
Okay.

531
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:11,800
Can you handle it?

532
00:49:36,760 --> 00:49:37,760
I’m sorry.

533
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,320
It’s okay, I’m fine.

534
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,600
I shouldn’t have taken advantage
of you when you were crying.

535
00:50:19,840 --> 00:50:21,120
It’s not like that.

536
00:50:22,120 --> 00:50:24,440
I was the one who started it.

537
00:50:25,360 --> 00:50:27,040
Don’t do this again, okay?

538
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:32,480
You did it for me,
so I did it for you too.

539
00:50:33,160 --> 00:50:34,280
It’s different.

540
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:36,440
I did that willingly.

541
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,440
I was willing too.

542
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:43,520
Hey.

543
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:45,080
Yes?

544
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,280
Where are you going?

545
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:50,240
Didn’t I tell you?

546
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:51,640
- Don’t—
- Tonight...

547
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:54,360
you won’t do anything to me, right?

548
00:50:56,600 --> 00:51:02,640
Then just for tonight, stay with me.

549
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:04,800
Please.

550
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,000
Please, please, please.

551
00:51:13,080 --> 00:51:15,200
Just once won’t make me less dangerous.

552
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:41,240
I’m sorry I suck at it.

553
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:46,280
You’ll get better.

554
00:51:49,880 --> 00:51:50,920
P’ Cir.

555
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:57,880
Can you promise me
that you won’t go anywhere?

556
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:05,440
♪ Only when I met you did I understand ♪
Uh, no, it’s nothing.

557
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:10,000
♪ Why flowers bloom so beautifully ♪

558
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,880
♪ You must be the water,
graceful and delicate ♪
As long as you want me to stay…

559
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:20,840
♪ That fills my heart ♪
I’ll be right here.

560
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:26,320
Can I keep you safe forever?
Good night krub.

561
00:52:31,800 --> 00:52:35,560
Can I keep you safe?

562
00:53:01,280 --> 00:53:04,360
Hello, Auntie. I’m back.

563
00:53:05,760 --> 00:53:06,960
How’s Cir doing?

564
00:53:10,440 --> 00:53:14,600
I think it’s time for me
to go meet my fiancé.

566
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:38,680
Can I have your number?

567
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:43,600
What do you need it for?
To worship it or something?

568
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:47,320
A number is for calling,
why would I worship it?

569
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:51,960
I’m being sarcastic.
It means I’m not giving it to you.

570
00:53:54,240 --> 00:53:56,200
How about Line?

571
00:53:56,600 --> 00:53:58,680
- Nope, I don’t use it.
- You’re so out of date.

572
00:53:59,200 --> 00:54:01,120
Hey, you’re dissing me?

573
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,920
Seriously, has there been
a single time since we met

574
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,560
that you didn’t mess with me?

575
00:54:07,600 --> 00:54:11,840
Since we started talking,
I haven’t dissed you at all.

576
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:13,640
You fucking bastard!

577
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:18,480
You fucking bastard.

578
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:22,400
What are you laughing at?

579
00:54:23,960 --> 00:54:25,560
You really speak your mind, don’t you?

580
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,520
Ugh, I really don’t wanna owe anyone.

581
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:40,920
Thanks for walking me anyway.

582
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,880
Got it.

583
00:55:08,760 --> 00:55:10,880
Shit! It's the anniversary of his dad's death today!

584
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,960
You're going to buy things for your dad, right?

585
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,080
Can I go with you?

586
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:17,760
Phu, why are you standing here?

587
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:18,760
P’ Thorn.

588
00:55:18,760 --> 00:55:20,680
- And who is this?
- I’m Phu’s boyfriend.

589
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:25,680
Dad used to play love songs on the flute for mom every day.

590
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,840
You still don't realize it,
so I want to make it clear once and for all.

591
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:30,120
How about I ask you out?

592
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:34,360
From now on, I’ll be playing the flute for you.
