1
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:11,760
I know how you feel about Phu.

2
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,280
But let me make it clear—you’ve
got nothing going on with him.

3
00:00:16,040 --> 00:00:17,160
Aren’t you gonna kiss?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,120
How could I possibly tell you the truth?

5
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:22,160
When I’m…

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,800
I’ve figured out what
to do about us kissing.

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,000
I think you can’t live without Phu.

8
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,720
So I’ll be his substitute
until you return to that world.

9
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,840
Your body’s pretty warm, P’ Cir.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,320
At least I’m useful to you.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:55,920
Do you really want me to go back, Phu?

12
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
No, I’m just worried about your feelings.

13
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,560
What about you?
Do you want to go back?

14
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,840
I don’t know.

15
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:26,080
For me, I’m fine with anywhere
as long as I have you.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,600
We parked pretty far, didn’t we?

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
And the rain just won’t stop.

18
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,039
But we’re already soaked from the rain.

19
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,240
How about we just run through it?

20
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,680
Phu.

21
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes?

22
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,960
Can we come to university together?

23
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,039
If it’s not too much trouble

24
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,880
can I drop you off at your faculty
and then pick you up after?

25
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:06,680
No, you can't.

26
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:21,600
Because I promised Ai Jin that
we’d come together tomorrow.

27
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,320
But any other day is fine.

28
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,640
Jin?

29
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,079
Yeah, Ai Jin, my friend.

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
You've met him before.
The one who likes to stare at the sky.

31
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
Just the two of you?

32
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:45,400
You’re not jealous, are you?

33
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,520
I am.

34
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,960
I don't want you to go with him.

35
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,680
But there’s nothing between Ai Jin and me.

36
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,240
You sure?

37
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,480
Yeah.

38
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,400
What about… me?

39
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:17,600
Oh! The rain has stopped.

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,079
Come on, let’s go home.

41
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,320
You’re really not gonna
answer me, stubborn kid?

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,440
Oh, look! A rainbow!

43
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,400
Come on, let’s go home.

44
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,720
Come on.

45
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:35,200
Oh, I forgot to tell you. I’m seeing
a movie with Ai Jin tomorrow.

46
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,080
EP IV: Closing the Distance

47
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,040
How was it?
Did you understand the movie?

48
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,240
Not at all. I've been
waiting for you to sum it up.

49
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,480
It's a satire on the feudal
system and capitalism.

50
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Even without titles or nobility in this
era, people still judge based on money.

51
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:49,360
Lots of symbols, a bit
hard to interpret, but still fun.

52
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,800
So, what did you learn from the movie?

53
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,240
Cheese popcorn and cola
were so good. I loved it.

54
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,240
You’re really something.

55
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,160
Even though you don’t understand
the movies I drag you into

56
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,680
you never turn me down.

57
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:08,280
That’s because you treat
me to food every time.

58
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:11,520
And if I don’t come with you, who will?

59
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,960
How’s it going with P’ Cir?

60
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,320
P’ Cir? What… What about him?

61
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,840
Why are you asking about him?

62
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,560
Did he mind you coming with me?

63
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I got my answer.

64
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,720
What?

65
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,920
I’m not… doing anything bad.
It’s just a movie outing.

66
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,320
And he’s not my boyfriend.

67
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,640
Sometimes I wonder if you can read my mind.

68
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,159
You seem to know everything.

69
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:50,800
Ai Jin, I’m curious.

70
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,040
Why do you guys want me
and him to be together so much?

71
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:57,920
We’ve only been talking
for less than two weeks.

72
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,680
Because he's the first one
to give all his attention to you

73
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,760
without even noticing us.

74
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,040
For longer than you think.

75
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,200
People in our group are odd, Phu.

76
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,760
So am I.

77
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:22,000
Believing in superstition
doesn’t make you odd.

78
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:26,120
We’re odd people, but you’ve
never said anything about it.

79
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:30,640
You’d only say, ‘That’s not
odd. It’s perfectly normal.’

80
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,400
You accept all of us for who we are.

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,520
Believe me when I say you're the cutest.

82
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,280
If P’ Cir saw you the way
we do, I’d just be happy.

83
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:46,920
And you’re so good-hearted
that it’s worrying.

84
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,720
You believe whatever anyone tells you.

85
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
Really?

86
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,440
I don’t think so.

87
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Phu.

88
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:06,960
Have you seen P’ Lion around?

89
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,880
P’ Lion…

90
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,680
Lionel Richie?

91
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:14,920
Your senior.

92
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,840
Oh, you mean P’ Wim?

93
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:19,960
No, I haven’t seen him. Why?

94
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:22,880
Nothing.

95
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,720
It’s just that he’s
honest with his thoughts.

96
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,400
Oh, are you waiting for me, P’ Cir?

97
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,800
Why did you walk in the rain?

98
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:08,880
Why didn’t your friend give you a ride?

99
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
I asked him to drop me off at 7-Eleven.

100
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:15,480
But just my luck, some random
car splashed water all over me.

101
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,200
Look at me, I smell terrible.

102
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,480
See?

103
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,320
Your jacket’s gonna get dirty.

104
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,440
Forget about the jacket.

105
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,760
Take care of yourself first
or you’ll catch a cold.

106
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:51,040
Hey, the water’s dripping.

107
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:52,240
It’s just a floor.

108
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,160
But it’s gonna smell bad.

109
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
It’s okay, I’ll wipe it.

110
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,080
It’s not okay. No.

111
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,280
No. Let me go.

112
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,320
Come here.

113
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,120
Hey, what are you doing?
Put me down.

114
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,440
Stubborn.

115
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
I’m not stubborn.
I’m telling you to put me down.

116
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,360
Hey! P’ Cir, put me down.

117
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,280
You’re all cold.

118
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,640
‘Cause I got soaked in the rain.

119
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:19,240
What are you doing?

120
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:20,800
Don’t be stubborn, Phu.

121
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I’m not being stubborn.
What are you trying to do?

122
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:26,480
If you’re not stubborn,
then let me help you shower.

123
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,480
Hey!

124
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,400
Don’t be stubborn, Phu.

125
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,280
I’m not being stubborn, you are!

126
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:35,040
What? I’m what?

127
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,720
You’re trying to take my clothes off.

128
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:38,600
How will you shower if
you don’t take them off?

129
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,720
You may have seen that Phukan
naked, but not this Phukan.

130
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,560
Sorry, I was just worried.

131
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,600
I know.

132
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:59,040
You can leave now, P’ Cir.

133
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,920
P’ Cir.

134
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:07,880
Phu.

135
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,520
I...

136
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,040
Can I kiss you?

137
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,400
Please let me do it.

138
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:16,920
You should leave now.

139
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,160
I’m happy.

140
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,480
About what?

141
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,960
That you’re reacting to me too.

142
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:37,840
Hey! What are you saying?
You think I can't get embarrassed?

143
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:38,960
Get out now.

144
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,200
Get out! Is it fun teasing
someone who's never done it?

145
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:42,720
Never?

146
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,160
Yeah, never! What a baby, right?

147
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,320
Get out now!

148
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,640
Get out.

149
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:53,760
Whatever!
When I stop being embarrassed

150
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:55,320
you’ll be cleaning the floor for me!

151
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:29,240
How did you get my number?

152
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,360
Never mind, I got my answer.

153
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:48,080
What did you mean by what you said before?

154
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,760
What did you find out?

155
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,840
Nothing much.

156
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,120
You have secrets you can’t tell.

157
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,280
And I’ve got a couple of my own

158
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,200
that if I said them, people
would think I’m insane.

159
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,720
When did you get to know Ai Phu?

160
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:12,120
When did you start liking him?

161
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,080
And how did you know
he was going to study here?

162
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:27,000
I never thought someone like P’ Cir
would eavesdrop on others.

163
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,120
How did you know?

164
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,160
I asked, and you answered me yourself.

165
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:39,080
I’ve told you my secret.

166
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,080
Impossible.

167
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,760
You, of all people, actually said that?

168
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:55,080
Don’t worry, I’m not
trying to be your enemy.

169
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
As long as you don’t hurt my friend,
I’m always ready to support you.

170
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:05,000
Actually, I’ve been doing
it for almost two years.

171
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:07,960
Probably since I started
getting to know Phu.

172
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:13,520
Because when I got to know
him, I got to know you too.

173
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:21,800
You can hear?

174
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:24,720
Within a limited range.

175
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,040
You don't have to worry about
me telling anyone what I heard.

176
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
Ai Phu should hear it straight from you.

177
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,600
And there’s no need to get jealous.

178
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:38,080
I just feel at ease with someone
who doesn't have hidden agendas.

179
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,600
Hearing thoughts, huh?

180
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,680
Somethinng so unbelievable…

181
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:03,400
But you’ve got no right to judge, Ai Cir.

182
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,240
Ooh, with that sneeze, I wonder
if someone’s thinking about you.

183
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,080
Don’t think so. I’ve had a cold since
morning and can’t stop sneezing.

184
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,400
Ai Phu.

185
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,280
Did you betray me?

186
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,160
What do you mean?

187
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,440
You said I was
the hottest guy in the campus

188
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,120
so how could you fall for P’ Cir?

189
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,800
Are you trying to say I’m not
as hot? I’m not having that.

190
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,200
And what? You’ve just met him.
Why are you so easy?

191
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,240
Hey.

192
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,240
Ahem, take this!

193
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,520
Ouch, shit!

194
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,680
Why are you calling my friend easy?

195
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,000
Why did you slap me? It hurts.

196
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,520
This is a cafeteria!

197
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,040
You should’ve gotten hit harder.

198
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,760
What the fuck? You guys
are ganging up on me.

199
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,320
Don’t change the subject.

200
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,680
I heard you were walking
with him under an umbrella.

201
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
Tell me, how did it happen?

202
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,920
And you guys too.

203
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:12,440
I was gone for just a few days,
how’d you let him steal Phu?

204
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:15,240
Don’t hit my face.
It’s my only good trait.

205
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
Annoying.

206
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,520
Don’t listen to this barking dog, Phu.

207
00:17:19,480 --> 00:17:22,160
How could you say that to Phu
when you’re promiscuous yourself?

208
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
You’d sleep with anyone
as long as they don’t have tails.

209
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:28,319
I heard he hooked up with
a Grade 11 student recently.

210
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:30,960
Boned her the first day they met.
That’s just the worst.

211
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,600
You can just call me out directly.

212
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,920
Scum.

213
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,120
You don’t have to belittle
P’ Cir by comparing him to Ai Chi.

214
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:44,080
P' Cir can make anyone
swoon just by looking at him.

215
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,240
Just look at his face.

216
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,760
He must be the type to
do things the right way

217
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:55,080
giving off the vibe of being
protective and caring, right?

218
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,240
Stop daydreaming.

219
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,240
No such man exists even
in your dad's generation.

220
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:12,760
So what’s the deal? Tell me.

221
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:17,160
Umm… Well…

222
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:20,280
Could you back up a bit?

223
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:27,080
Since P’ Cir is here to
pick Phu up, we’d better go.

224
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,160
- Sawasdee ka.
- Sawasdee ka.

225
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,560
Hi, my name’s Achi.

226
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,960
Did you wait long?

227
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,080
Hey, do you know me?

228
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,120
Have you eaten yet?

229
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,440
- Not yet.
- I’m a friend of…

230
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,480
Forget it, he’s completely ignoring me.

231
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,240
If you haven’t eaten, how about
we go grab something outside?

232
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:55,480
Or do you want your favorite stewed eggs?

233
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,120
Well...

234
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,400
You’re really amazing
in so many different ways.

235
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,200
Do you have something to say to me?

236
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:21,880
Well, my friends talks
about you a lot, you know.

237
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:25,680
People from my faculty,
both juniors and seniors.

238
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,720
After I started talking to you

239
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:32,200
I realized just how much
people around me talk about you.

240
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,360
Don’t pay attention to them.

241
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:38,480
It's not that I care,
I just think it’s a pity.

242
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,520
What do you mean?

243
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:44,960
If I had noticed earlier,
we probably would’ve talked sooner.

244
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,720
And I would’ve gotten to
know P’ Cir from this world too.

245
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,800
Do you think the you from
this world would like me?

246
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:04,600
Of course.

247
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,080
How do you know?
He might not like me.

248
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:10,840
I’m both clumsy and goofy.

249
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,080
With how cute you are,
how could I not like you?

250
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:19,760
Really? I don’t see
anything cute about me.

251
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,840
It’s right here.

252
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,120
And if you meet the me from this world

253
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:35,760
please be as kind to him
as you are to me right now.

254
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,880
I’ll just be like this.

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,680
How about we go have hotpot?
I really want hotpot. I'm hungry.

256
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:51,640
You changed the subject.

257
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:53,760
I didn’t.

258
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,240
Sawasdee krub, Khun Rames.

259
00:21:18,280 --> 00:21:19,280
What do you want?

260
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:23,400
Khun Ratri wishes to see you.

261
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,280
I’m not going.

262
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,200
She’s ordered me to pick you up.

263
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,920
I said I’m not going.

264
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,080
And I don’t have to go with you.

265
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,440
You okay?

266
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Yes.

267
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,840
Good. Let’s go.

268
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
What about…

269
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,160
Don’t worry. Let’s go.

270
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:57,000
Your mother has ordered me
to invite you for dinner.

271
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,560
She wants to know how you’re doing.

272
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,960
If you're concerned about
how I’ll get home, don’t worry.

273
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:12,080
Just go have dinner with your mom.

274
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,280
Then you can take my car key.

275
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,440
No way, your car’s expensive.
What if I drive it onto the curb?

276
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:31,720
And if you don’t want that guy to
send you home, you can drive yourself.

277
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,480
Don’t worry about me.
I can get back on my own.

278
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:36,240
The condo’s close by.

279
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,360
Well, I’m going now.

280
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,280
Bye-bye.

281
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:52,600
I’ll drive myself.

282
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,200
As you wish, Khun Rames.

283
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:07,720
Man, it’s so cold.

284
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,600
It’s already November,
but the rain’s still coming down.

285
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,840
I really wanted to go eat
something warm with P’ Cir.

286
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:33,080
What a shame.

287
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:39,600
So cold.

288
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:59,320
Let me know when you get to your room.

289
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:14,640
Phu, message me when you get to your room.

290
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:23,520
Are you stuck in the rain?

291
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:47,440
Please reply if you see my message.

292
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:57,760
You might be annoyed, but I’m worried.

293
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,040
Khun Ratri said
she’ll return a little late.

294
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,600
Why don’t you go rest in your room?

295
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,520
When she gets here,
I’ll have someone notify you.

296
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,840
I’ll wait here. I’ll leave
as soon as dinner’s over.

297
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
It might take a while.

298
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:36,400
Since when can you give me orders?

299
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:40,360
I’m just informing you
as your mother instructed.

300
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,800
Phu, I was worried sick.
Did you make it to your room?

301
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
I made it.

302
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,680
Sorry I didn’t answer your call, P’ Cir.

303
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:48,200
It was raining so hard
that I didn’t hear it.

304
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,680
Thank goodness, you’ve
made it to your room.

305
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:57,280
Have you arrived there yet?
I’ve been back for a while now.

306
00:26:57,880 --> 00:26:58,920
I just got here.

307
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,320
Oh, by the way, if I don’t pick up
next time, it means I didn’t hear it.

308
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,480
Sometimes I forget to turn
the sound back on after muting.

309
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,480
But you can keep calling me.

310
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,800
So, no matter what I do

311
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,280
you won’t be annoyed, right?

312
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,480
That means I can hold your hand.

313
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Hug you.

314
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,120
Huh?

315
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,320
And kiss you too.

316
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,680
Hey, how come?

317
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:36,880
Don’t we have to be a couple
first before we can do that?

318
00:27:37,920 --> 00:27:40,280
Then be my boyfriend, you stubborn kid.

319
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:44,800
I’m not stubborn, and
I won't be your boyfriend.

320
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,240
If I’m a stubborn kid,
then what are you?

321
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,160
A bear with a glare?
Your frown is so intense.

322
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,960
I can be whatever you want me to be.

323
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,720
Wow, we’ve been on the phone for this long.

324
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,520
I should hang up now.

325
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:39,560
I’m hungry. I think
I’ll make some noodles.

326
00:28:41,240 --> 00:28:43,640
Go have dinner, I’ll hang up now.

327
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,000
P’ Cir.

328
00:28:49,520 --> 00:28:52,200
If you ever need anything,
feel free call me.

329
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,040
Calling out of worry is fine too.

330
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:57,600
Don't worry about annoying me,
because you've never annoyed me.

331
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,600
Phu loves talking to you, P’ Cir.

332
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,440
I’ll hang up now.

333
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:27,520
P’ Cir will be worried if he finds out.

334
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,480
Better take some meds.

335
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,160
Where are you going?

336
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:57,360
I’m leaving.

337
00:29:58,160 --> 00:29:59,160
You can’t leave.

338
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,840
Khun Ratri wishes to speak with you.

339
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,880
She said that if you can’t wait,
you may rest and talk tomorrow.

340
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:14,640
I think your boss won't be back today,
and we likely won't talk tomorrow.

341
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:18,400
If you insist on leaving

342
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:23,440
Khun Ratri asked me to inform you
that you're not following the rules.

343
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,400
Which one?

344
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:28,320
Contacting your father.

345
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,040
That’s not a rule.

346
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:35,080
You know very well that it's an order.

347
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,560
She wants to discuss your
future after graduation as well.

348
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:50,760
She said the freedom she
gave you is coming to an end.

349
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,720
Good.

350
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,000
I have something to say
to your boss as well.

351
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,680
It's been a while.

352
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,280
You haven't changed at all.

353
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:41,280
You’ve got a cold?

354
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,480
Get away from me, I might catch it.

355
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,480
Ai Phu, that’s gross!

356
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,800
Phu, spread those germs so this
annoying prick can finally shut up.

357
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,720
Jeez, no.

358
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,000
Phu.

359
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,120
You alright? Took any meds yet?

360
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,960
Yeah, but my nose is still
stuffy, and I’m feeling dizzy too.

361
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,760
Don’t put your face down,
you’ll have trouble breathing.

362
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,360
Will you be able to work
on the report tomorrow?

363
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,000
Yes.

364
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:21,760
I think you should get some rest.

365
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,760
But it’s a group project.

366
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:29,320
I’ll be fine.

367
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,400
You’re underestimating your health.

368
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,840
Does P’ Cir know you’re sick?
I didn't see him this morning.

369
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:42,160
No, he went back to his
mom's place yesterday.

370
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:46,240
He probably hasn't come back yet
since he hasn't texted me.

371
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:49,920
But you absolutely can't tell him.

372
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,400
If he finds out, he'll
definitely worry about me.

373
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:04,800
Hey.

374
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:06,160
Hey.

375
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,720
Now that we're all here…

376
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:14,520
What's going on with you
and P’ Cir? Tell me straight up.

377
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,240
Ai Phu!

378
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,040
Shh! This is a library!

379
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,360
I’m sorry.

380
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,400
Hey, don’t touch me!

381
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:32,880
Shh, keep it down.
This is a library!

382
00:33:33,320 --> 00:33:34,600
Shut it and go to the toilet.

383
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:37,040
Sorry, I didn’t mean to.

384
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,360
Ma.

385
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,760
Mama

386
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:51,840
I’m sick.

387
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:55,360
How did you get sick?

388
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,120
I was only out in the rain for two days.

389
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,480
You got what you deserved, you know that?

390
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:07,640
Why did you go out in the rain?

391
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:11,199
Well... it’s rainy season.

392
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:13,920
It's been raining every day.

393
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:16,199
Take care of yourself then.

394
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,760
Don't forget to eat
and take your medicine.

395
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,080
And don’t stay up too late.

396
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:26,080
You always end up playing games all night.

397
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,320
Says who?

398
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,400
I actually go to bed early now.

399
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,280
As soon as someone wishes me good night

400
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,199
I fall asleep right away.

401
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,239
Wait, someone’s wishing you good night?

402
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:44,639
It hasn’t been that
long since we last talked

403
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,480
and now you have someone
saying good night to you?

404
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
I won’t tell you.

405
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:55,199
I’ll tell you when you get back.

406
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:04,080
Ma, I want to eat your sour
curry with acacia omelet.

407
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,400
I’m sorry, sweetie.

408
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,640
I don’t think I’ll be back soon.

409
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,720
I still can't bring myself
to go back to Thailand.

410
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,200
I understand.

411
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,400
I’m—

412
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,040
I’m kidding, Ma.

413
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:31,360
There’s a place near my dorm that
makes really delicious sour curry.

414
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,120
I can just eat from there.

415
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,680
I’m sorry, sweetie

416
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,400
Ma.

417
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:49,920
I just took some
medicine, so I’m sleepy.

418
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,280
I’m going to bed now.

419
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,240
It’s almost Pa’s anniversary.

420
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,520
I miss Papa and Mama.

421
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,360
Don't scold me, Pa.

422
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:42,920
I’m crying because I’m sick.

423
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,640
P’ Cir, when will you come back?

424
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,400
You’re here?

425
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,240
You said you wanted to talk to me.

426
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,720
I said I’d talk to you at dinner.

427
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:45,200
I have no intention of wasting my time.

428
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,960
That’s a lesson you taught me.

429
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,600
Fine.

430
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,720
You didn’t obey the rules.

431
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:11,120
Rule number one:

432
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,400
I must attend only
the university of your choice.

433
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,240
Rule number two:

434
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,360
I must achieve first-class honors.

435
00:39:22,120 --> 00:39:23,120
Rule number three:

436
00:39:24,920 --> 00:39:26,840
I must graduate within four years.

437
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:28,920
Rule number four:

438
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:32,480
I mustn’t cause any scandals
that would tarnish your reputation.

439
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,120
And rule number five:

440
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:39,480
My freedom lasts only
until the day I graduate.

441
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,360
I don’t think I’ve
broken any of your rules.

442
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:48,960
There’s one more.

443
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,160
No meeting your father.

444
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:59,800
You said you wouldn’t see that man again

445
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,800
but you didn’t say I’m not allowed to.

446
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,720
Since when did you dare to argue with me?

447
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,160
I'm explaining, not arguing.

448
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:14,360
Don't tell me you've even
forgotten your own words.

449
00:40:15,320 --> 00:40:16,600
Not to mention the time.

450
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:22,160
Is it because of your father
that you're defying me like this?

451
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,080
You’re getting involved with that boy

452
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:30,360
because your father told you
to ruin my reputation, right?

453
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,240
Believe whatever you want.

454
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,080
But I’m really seeing that boy.

455
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:46,200
And if you still believe that
this is your ex-husband’s doing

456
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,840
then that’s up to you.

457
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:52,880
Fine.

458
00:40:56,360 --> 00:41:01,280
You can do whatever you want,
as long as you’re still studying.

459
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,040
But once you graduate

460
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,040
your life will be in my hands.

461
00:41:09,800 --> 00:41:14,520
And when that time comes,
your father won’t be able to help you.

462
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,640
P’ Cir

463
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:49,040
P' Cir

464
00:41:56,520 --> 00:41:58,240
What’s up, P’ Cir?

465
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,360
What’s wrong with your voice?
Are you okay, Phu?

466
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,960
When are you coming back?

467
00:42:08,520 --> 00:42:10,040
You’re sick, aren’t you?

468
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,240
No, I’m not.

469
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:15,040
I’m heading back now.

470
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,200
Do you want anything?
I’ll buy it for you.

471
00:42:18,680 --> 00:42:20,320
I’m really not sick.

472
00:42:21,120 --> 00:42:22,600
Please believe me.

473
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:27,240
What a stubborn kid.

474
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,720
Alright, I believe you.

475
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,160
So, do you want anything?

476
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:43,280
I want to eat sour curry
with acacia omelet.

477
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,920
Can you buy it for me?

478
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,080
I’ll buy it for you. Anything else?

479
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:52,960
Cooling gel patch.

480
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,840
Oh, but I’m not sick or anything.

481
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,720
Just want you to buy it for me.

482
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,880
Okay, I believe you’re fine.

483
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,400
Then I’m hanging up now.

484
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:10,680
P’ Cir.

485
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:13,160
Yes?

486
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:20,360
What is it, Phu?
Do you want anything else?

487
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,280
Please hurry.

488
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,440
I miss you.

489
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,160
Is it okay to leave it like this?

490
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:04,080
Didn’t I tell you?

491
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:08,120
I’ll give him freedom until he graduates.

492
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:10,200
Besides…

493
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,240
Caging a dog that has tasted freedom

494
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:18,640
will make it suffer more.

495
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:44,880
When are you coming?

496
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,400
Phukan, I’m here.

497
00:45:03,640 --> 00:45:04,640
Phu!

498
00:45:10,200 --> 00:45:11,240
Phu!

499
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Phu.

500
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:25,680
Phu, I’m here.

501
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:43,960
P’ Cir.

502
00:45:49,360 --> 00:45:50,400
I’m sick.

503
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,120
I’m here now, my boy.

504
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,400
I’m here.

505
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:08,760
It’s okay now.

506
00:46:21,480 --> 00:46:24,480
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

507
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,400
Your friend hasn’t shown up for
my class for three periods now.

508
00:46:34,640 --> 00:46:37,680
Three weeks ago, he was
admitted in the hospital.

509
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:40,640
But where has he been these past two weeks?

510
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:44,480
I know that Rames can ace the exams.

511
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,120
But if he doesn’t attend enough
classes, there's nothing I can do.

512
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:52,200
Ugh, why does it have to be me again?

513
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:58,760
I just found out too that
he hasn't been attending classes.

514
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:03,280
Alright, if he comes,
tell him to come see me.

515
00:47:03,440 --> 00:47:05,680
His classmates have all
submitted their assignments.

516
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,280
Oh? Why didn’t you ask
someone in the class to tell him?

517
00:47:08,600 --> 00:47:11,200
I’m not even in this class section.

518
00:47:11,880 --> 00:47:15,560
Anyone, please take this burden off me.

519
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,920
If it’s about Rames, it’s got to be you.

520
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,160
Me again. It’s always me every time.

521
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,360
Why the fuck did he take
the course I didn’t enroll in?

522
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:32,400
Why aren’t you picking up, Ai Cir?

523
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,840
Achi.

524
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,760
Oh! P’ Wim, sawasdee krub.

525
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,040
Have you seen Ai Cir?

526
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,040
Why are you asking me?

527
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:55,400
‘Cause he's been coming here a lot lately.

528
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:57,680
Have you?

529
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:00,360
What’s going on?

530
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:01,920
Why are you sitting here?

531
00:48:03,080 --> 00:48:04,680
Are you here to watch the sky with me?

532
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,280
Watch the sky my ass.

533
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:09,560
My ass.

534
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,040
Why the fuck are you laughing?

535
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Don’t you remember P’ Wim?
Last year’s university pageant host.

536
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,640
The one that ended in disaster
after two contestants fought over you?

537
00:48:19,720 --> 00:48:21,000
Don't dig up the past.

538
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:22,880
P’Wim.

539
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:26,480
If you want to know
something, just ask my friend.

540
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,080
He fucking knows everything.

541
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:30,360
Ai Jin, he’s looking for P’ Cir.

542
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:33,120
It’s okay, I’ll go to his
place to look for him.

543
00:48:34,840 --> 00:48:35,920
Don’t want to bother you.

544
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:38,040
You won’t find him there.

545
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,360
Ai Phu said he went to his mom’s place.

546
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:44,440
What? His mom’s place?

547
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:46,200
That’s what I heard.

548
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:48,040
This is bad.

549
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,040
Ai Zone, did you know your mom
summoned your bro back home?

550
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:57,840
Yes!

551
00:48:59,320 --> 00:49:00,600
What’s up with P’ Wim?

552
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:03,320
He really says what’s on his mind.

553
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,680
P’ Cir.

554
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:16,760
Can you take care of me forever?

555
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,080
Why is P' Cir with Phu today?

556
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:21,000
I’m sick, so P' Cir came to stay over.

557
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,920
Together?!

558
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:23,520
Can I talk to your friend?

559
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:25,240
Wanna go watch a movie with me next month?

560
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,400
You little bastard!

561
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,160
P' Cir, you said you’ve never had fun before, right?

562
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,280
Let’s take a photo with me.

563
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,160
How do you feel,

564
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,360
about a different future?
