1
00:00:11,680 --> 00:00:13,360
P' Cir, you really came back.

2
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,600
If you could really hear other people’s thoughts,

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:17,760
you’d know what I’m thinking right now.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,920
Stop being crazy!

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:21,360
I told you I'm not going to marry you.

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:22,720
I don’t love you.

7
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,840
Have you told him the truth yet,

8
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:27,920
about the lie you told him,
saying you came from a parallel world?

9
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,960
I didn't put my yearbook here.

10
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,720
Phu.

11
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,000
Phu, hear me out first.

12
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:54,480
P’ Cir.

13
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:57,400
Can I ask you something?

14
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,360
- I—
- Are you from a parallel world?

15
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:07,400
Answer me.

16
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,800
Yes or no, answer me.

17
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,240
No.

18
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,560
Everything.

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,280
All of it.

20
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,680
When you said we were a couple.

21
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,600
Was it all a lie?

22
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,320
I’m sorry.

23
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,720
Hold on, Phu.
Please hear me out first.

24
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
No.

25
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:05,640
Wait, let me explain first.
I didn't mean to.

26
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,160
- When I woke up—
- I’m not listening!

27
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,600
I don't want to hear
anything from you anymore.

28
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,760
Let go.

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,680
I’m begging you, Phu.
Please hear me out first.

30
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,600
Let me go.

31
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,440
If what you said about
loving me isn't a lie…

32
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,040
then please let me go.

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,600
I’m sorry.

34
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,600
EP X: The Convergence of Time

35
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,240
P’ Cir, wake up. It’s morning.

36
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,720
Phu.

37
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:33,159
Liar.

38
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,280
How could you do this to me?
Why did you lie to me?

39
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,880
Everything between us
was all a lie, wasn't it?

40
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,080
We've never known each other before.

41
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,320
No wait, it's just me who didn't know you.

42
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,560
And everything you said about
loving me, it was all a lie, wasn't it?

43
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,159
Why have you done this?

44
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:55,320
Why did you deceive me?

45
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,000
Answer me!
Why are doing this to me?!

46
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,080
- How could you do this to me?!
- It’s not like that, Phu.

47
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,160
It’s not like that.

48
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,000
Let’s break up.

49
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,760

67

Did you cry?

68
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,680
Should I get you a cold compress?
Your eyes are all red.

69
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,680
No, you don’t need to.

70
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,200
Phu.

71
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,440
I don’t want to talk to you.

72
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:43,640
I don't want to see your face right now.

73
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:28,840
Ai Cir, I’m sorry.

74
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,440
Why are you apologizing to me?

75
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
Because I brought up what you...

76
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,880
Umm… what you lied about.

77
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,840
It’s got nothing to do with you.

78
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:53,880
Whether you say anything or not...

79
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,200
Phu would’ve found out anyway.

80
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:05,560
I've been such a coward
that I couldn't speak until now.

81
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,520
It makes sense if Phu hates me.

82
00:10:10,960 --> 00:10:12,720
Hey, don’t think like that.

83
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:15,000
Phu doesn't hate you.

84
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:20,120
I think… he’s just angry with you now.

85
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:25,200
So what should I do?

86
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,440
Hey, do you think that guy,
Ai Jin, can help you?

87
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:45,000
I think Phu might be
willing to listen to him.

88
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:50,000
But… I don’t wanna call him.

89
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,040
He keeps talking nonsense about
mind-reading and all that crap.

90
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,560
He’s not lying.

91
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,560
Huh?

92
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:03,960
He can really read people’s minds.

93
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,240
He knows everything about me and Phu.

94
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,200
He’s not lying.

95
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:14,760
Unlike me.

96
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,280
You don’t have to call him.

97
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:22,160
Everything is all my fault.

98
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:37,080
So… what are you gonna do next?

99
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,960
Everything.

100
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:42,280
Every option.

101
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:46,880
Every possible way I could do, Ai Wim.

102
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,520
I can't lose him no matter what.

103
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:57,200
I can no longer go back to being
the person I was without him.

104
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,880
Hey.

105
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,600
So this is what it’s like
not knowing beforehand.

106
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:40,400
Normally, I can tell when
someone’s approaching me.

107
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,680
But I guess you don’t believe me.

108
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,240
I talked to Ai Cir.

109
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:52,560
How is P’ Cir holding up?

110
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,840
I met Ai Phu this morning and
found out that he knows the truth now.

111
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,520
He was such a mess.

112
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:04,880
You found out because
Phu told you, or because…

113
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,880
You might’ve seen my friend
being all whiny, but you know what?

114
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:14,680
Ai Phu would never talk
badly about the one he loves.

115
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,440
Even if he’s angry enough to lose it

116
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:24,160
he’d never let anyone
slam P' Cir for lying to him.

117
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,160
But P' Cir didn’t lie to him, though.

118
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:33,480
What did you know?

119
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,080
Do you believe me now?

120
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,480
I'm asking, what exactly did you know?

121
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,280
You know what?

122
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,760
I haven't talked about the fact that I
can hear people's thoughts in a long time.

123
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Why?

124
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:00,640
If I do, people will just think I'm crazy.

125
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,840
Some even accused me of lying,
or that I'm just seeking attention.

126
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,000
Just think about it.

127
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,840
If someone told you
they could hear your thoughts...

128
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,080
how would you feel?

129
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,360
That's a mind invasion.
No one would be okay with that.

130
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:26,360
Those people either yelled
at me or ran away from me.

131
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:30,400
But mostly, they ran away.

132
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:33,840
That's why I don’t tell people much.

133
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,680
So why are you telling me?

134
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:45,200
Because I like you.

135
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,560
I don’t want to take
advantage of the one I like.

136
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:56,160
I want to tell him so he’ll
have a chance to run away.

137
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,320
Why should I run away from you?

138
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:02,960
I can hear people’s thoughts.
Are you okay with that?

139
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,280
I don’t know. Maybe, I guess.

140
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:09,680
Because I swear a lot in my head.

141
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:12,280
But I swear out loud too.

142
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,480
Why are you laughing?
I’m being serious.

143
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:24,120
Maybe this is why I can't
hear your thoughts anymore.

144
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:29,120
What do you mean?
You can hear them, and then you can't?

145
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,200
Like turning a switch on and off?

146
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:33,800
Because you say exactly what you think.

147
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:46,160
I don’t have to worry, be
suspicious, or be cautious around you

148
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,840
because you’ll tell me
exactly how you feel.

149
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:54,320
And because I like you, I don't want
to eavesdrop on your thoughts anymore.

150
00:15:56,000 --> 00:16:00,120

Of course I am.

176
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,360
Not hearing thoughts
is scarier than I thought.

177
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:11,920
Even if you can read my mind,
I’m not gonna run away from you.

00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:27,760
So take an umbrella with you.

196
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:35,840
Thank you.

197
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:38,080
One Year Ago

198
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
Thank you.

199
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:34,440
Thank you.

200
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,680
It was me.

201
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:48,640
It’s been me all along.

202
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:51,480
Why?

203
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,320
You do it.

204
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,600
- Me?
- Yeah.

205
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,240
They’re fighting because of you.

206
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:06,560
Hey, P' Cir left this for
you since this morning.

207
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:11,000
If you’re fighting,
try to talk it out calmly.

208
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:30,960
Eat something, okay?
I'm worried about you.

209
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:37,760
Phu, everyone’s worried about you.

210
00:21:39,920 --> 00:21:41,120
Maybe you should hear him out.

211
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,880
There’s no guardian angel.

212
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:41,120
No lucky charm.

213
00:22:45,560 --> 00:22:47,840
It’s been you all along, right?

214
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,360
Right?

215
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,120
Why are you doing this?

216
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,440
Phu.

217
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,120
I’m not good with words,
but you should already know.

218
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,600
I don't even know
if you'll watch this video.

219
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,880
I may not be able to explain it
in beautiful sentences.

220
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,520
And I might end up making you angrier.

221
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,720
But I've always wanted
to tell you something.

222
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,920
I know I’m just a liar.

223
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,080
But the one thing I’ve never lied about...

224
00:25:27,800 --> 00:25:28,920
is my love for you.

225
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,160
I’ve loved you since high school.

226
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,120
Five years ago.

227
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:52,400
Knock, knock, knock.
Who’s there?

228
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,640
You probably don’t remember.

229
00:26:00,880 --> 00:26:04,800
Do you know that you’re
the one who saved my life?

230
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:16,520
You made me want to live for myself.

231
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:24,080
I was born as nothing more than
a tool for my parents’ revenge.

232
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:29,440
I had no life, no freedom.

233
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:36,720
Yet everyone believe
I was born with everything.

234
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,320
Without having to try.

235
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,200
Or strive for anything.

236
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,560
But... that’s not true at all.

237
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:00,520
You were the only one who knew.

238
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:03,560
The only one who saw.

239
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,800
The only one who protected me.

240
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,640
I think you're talking nonsense.

241
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,960
You guys are just jealous
that the girls like him

242
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,240
because he’s competent, right?

243
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,760
But you don't know how much
effort he put in to get this good.

244
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:27,240
That was the first time I cried
because someone spoke about me.

245
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:31,880
At first, I didn’t understand what it was.

246
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:39,640
But then the guy who was born
to follow orders understood.

247
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,800
I’m not a robot.

248
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:47,120
I’m a human.

249
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:52,560
With flesh and blood, emotions and feelings.

250
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,440
And the first feeling I learned was...

251
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,400
loving someone.

252
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:15,040
It was me, Phu.

253
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,680
Since then, I've wanted
to take care of you.

254
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:24,840
Is there a university you're aiming for?

255
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:29,960
Yes, I want to attend the university
where my dad studied.

256
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,280
It was me who followed you here to study.

257
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:47,040
It was me... who came to live
in the same condo as you.

258
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,080
Take care on your way home.

259
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,760
Don’t worry about me.
I’m already home.

260
00:28:58,600 --> 00:29:03,120
It’s me who wants to see you every day

261
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,120
so I can have the strength
to keep going on in this world.

262
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:17,880
You probably think I'm disgusting
for acting like a total psycho.

263
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:23,480
I’m sorry.

264
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:32,600
But I swear I never would’ve
wanted anything from you...

265
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:38,760
if it weren’t for the day
I got hit by a car.

266
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,440
When I was about to die...

267
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:49,000
my only regret was that...

268
00:29:56,080 --> 00:29:59,440
I never got the chance to know you.

269
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,280
We never had the chance…

270
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:12,880
to know each other at all.

271
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:22,240
Why did we never have the chance
to get to know each other, Phu?

272
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,880
You’re the reason I want to keep living.

273
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
You are my life.

274
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,000
I’m not from a parallel world.

275
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,160
I just love you.

276
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,400
You don’t have to forgive me.

277
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Everything is all my fault.

278
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:20,200
That’s enough, P' Cir.
Don’t say anymore.

279
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,960
If you wake up in the morning

280
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:39,240
And find a big bouquet of flowers

281
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:48,400
You have no idea who it belongs to

282
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:52,920
Don’t be surprised

283
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:59,960
Because it belongs to you

284
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,000
At night before bed

285
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:13,080
A number you’re not familiar with

286
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:23,600
Sends you… an 'I miss you' message

287
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:26,720
With such gentle words

288
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:33,760
Wishing you sweet dreams and an early night

289
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:45,000
Don't worry that it went
to the wrong person

290
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:51,320
Don't guess, just accept it

291
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:02,680
Please don’t doubt my sincerity

292
00:33:04,560 --> 00:33:09,720
It’s from the same
person you’re familiar with

293
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:17,040
The one who’s always
watched over you from afar

294
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:23,080
Do you remember?
That person still cares about you

295
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,360
You know who it is

296
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:34,160
Every time the rain falls

297
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:41,120
You rush forward, your
body drenched and freezing

298
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,320
All your heart desires is an umbrella

299
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:53,200
Don't be surprised

300
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:58,960
If you happen to see it lying there

301
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:06,200
I promise...

302
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,360
I won’t appear before you again.

303
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:18,560
It’s not your fault. Please come
back to me, I’m begging you.

304
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,120
Could you not leave me?

305
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,560
But may I...

306
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,639
may I continue... taking care of you?

307
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:01,640
Can you come back to me?

308
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,200
I’m sorry.

309
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
P’ Cir…

310
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:37,280
No, this isn’t what I want.

311
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:14,400
Excuse me, have you seen P’ Cir?

312
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:15,520
No.

313
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,040
What about you?
Have you seen P’ Cir?

314
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,480
- No.
- No.

315
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:35,560
Hey, aren’t you Ai Cir’s boyfriend?

316
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:36,880
P’ Rome!

317
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,080
Have you seen P’ Cir?

318
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,680
- Have you seen him?!
- Hey, let go.

319
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:42,000
- Have you seen P’ Cir?!
- Why are you all drenched?

320
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,680
Jeez, stop, stop.

321
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,840
Step back first. Step back.

322
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,960
That’s it.

323
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:54,320
Bro, let me make myself clear.
I'm only interested in fish.

324
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:56,240
Besides, you’re my friend’s boyfriend.

325
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,720
I don’t wanna cheat my friend.

326
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:00,600
Or cheat on my friend?

327
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,480
Have you seen P’ Cir?

328
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,280
- Why don’t you just call him?
- I did, but he didn’t pick up.

329
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:07,840
I asked around, but nobody knows.

330
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:10,120
Have you seen P’ Cir?
Just tell me, please.

331
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,920
Whoa, stop shaking me like a boba tea!

332
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:17,840
Has no one ever told you not
to stir the water in a fish tank?

333
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,120
Fish can get dizzy, you know.

334
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:22,040
What a fucking day!
Ai Cir’s just as bad.

335
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,440
- You saw P’ Cir?!
- Yeah.

336
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,960
- You really saw him?!
- Take it easy, bro!

337
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:29,480
- You’re giving me a headache.
- Then answer me!

338
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,400
Fine. Let me go first.

339
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,800
Good.

340
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:43,600
Last I saw him... oh, it was
in front of the classroom.

341
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,400
Wait, but he didn’t go to class.

342
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:50,080
I saw him answer a call,
then he just ran off.

343
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,120
- Where did he go?
- Yeah. Where did he go?

344
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,160
I don’t know.

345
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:04,200
Hey bro, don’t cry.
People will think I’m bullying you.

346
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:08,040
Come on, don’t cry.
I’ll help you think, okay?

347
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:10,920
Ugh, fuck my life.

348
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,440
What the hell’s going on today?

349
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:19,080
Hold on, I think Ai Cir said something.

350
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,320
- What did he say?
- What was it?

351
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,600
Oh, I remember now!

352
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,560
He said he’s going back home
to settle on marrying his fiancée.

353
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,600
"What Rome says, divide it by ten."

354
00:38:40,040 --> 00:38:42,200
Your memory is so on point, Ai Rome.

355
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,640
Well then, I’ll go now. See you.

356
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,280
Phu! Are you alright?

357
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,880
P’ Wim, take me to P’ Cir’s house.

358
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Right now!

359
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:20,240
Aren't you going to eat, Cir?

360
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
Eat.

361
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:34,760
What's wrong?

362
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,080
Are you not feeling well?
Do you need medicine?

363
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,480
I’m full.

364
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,800
I want to talk about the wedding.

365
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,840
Good to see you so eager about it.

366
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:11,040
I’ll organize the wedding for you
and Lukprae right after you graduate.

367
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:15,000
I won’t get married.

368
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:22,800
Think carefully.

369
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:29,680
You know exactly what
I can do... to you and that kid.

370
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:33,840
Once you graduate

371
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:39,240
you’re going to work at my
company and marry Lukprae.

372
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,840
I’ve already mapped out your future.

373
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:53,040
Save it for yourself.

374
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,240
Rames.

375
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:56,360
Get back here now.

376
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,240
Hey! Who’s that?
How did you get in here?!

377
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:26,040
You little bastard! Don’t let us catch you!

378
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:37,760
- Let me go!
- Phu!

379
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:42,800
P’ Cir.

380
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,560
Cir, what’s the meaning of this?

381
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,720
Phu, how did you get here?

382
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,000
Are you going to break up with me?

383
00:41:58,040 --> 00:41:59,080
No.

384
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:02,160
And are you thinking
about breaking up with me?

385
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:04,920
Not at all.

386
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,760
So no matter what happens...

387
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,720
you won’t stop loving me?

388
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,960
No way, Phu.

389
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,840
Then tell your mom and
fiancée what we are to each other.

390
00:42:27,440 --> 00:42:28,720
Can I say that?

391
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,240
Say it.

392
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,080
Mother.

393
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,560
You and I…

394
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,280
we’re together.

395
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,200
We love each other.

396
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:00,080
That’s right, P’ Cir.

397
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
We love each other.

398
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:26,280
What you do, who you love, or
what you declare is your business.

399
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,920
But after you graduate

400
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:33,680
you will marry only
the woman I’ve chosen for you.

401
00:43:34,400 --> 00:43:35,440
But Mother!

402
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:37,480
Wait.

403
00:43:38,640 --> 00:43:41,360
Just a few more months.
Can’t you wait?

404
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:46,880
Soon, you’ll own him
for the rest of his life.

405
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,520
I won’t take orders from you anymore.

406
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:01,920
If you want to hurt me...
or do anything to me, go ahead.

407
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,280
I’ll never just sit by and
watch you touch the one I love.

408
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,280
But you’re my son.

409
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:16,760
You’re my personal property.

410
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,400
I’m not your property.

411
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,800
Yes, you are.
You’re my property.

412
00:44:23,720 --> 00:44:25,280
The remaining share.

413
00:44:27,320 --> 00:44:28,440
Don’t you remember?

414
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:33,400
I am a person.

415
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:35,760
Not your property!

416
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:38,160
Cir.

417
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:41,000
You’re my property!

418
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,760
You’ll never escape from me.

419
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:48,520
If you want to leave, trade
another property for yourself.

420
00:44:50,080 --> 00:44:54,400
Do you think your father
will let your little brother go?

421
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:56,240
Your father has chosen!

422
00:44:57,080 --> 00:45:01,560
He chose to abandon you and me.
Bear this in mind!

423
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:05,400
You and I have been abandoned.

424
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:07,920
I have no one left.

425
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:10,640
Do you hear me?! I have no one left!

426
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:27,320
Trade your little brother for yourself.

427
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:31,920
And I’ll let you go.

428
00:45:32,720 --> 00:45:33,720
Mother!

429
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:36,960
How can you still call yourself a mother?!

430
00:45:37,720 --> 00:45:39,120
I’m not your mother.

431
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,920
I’m your owner.

432
00:45:42,880 --> 00:45:45,560
Property for property.

433
00:45:46,840 --> 00:45:51,320
Bring your little brother
to suffer with me in your place.

434
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,160
If that’s what you want, Mom.

435
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:17,800
I’m here to take my brother’s place.

436
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:20,440
Ramil.

437
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:24,640
Glad you still remember my name.

438
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:29,720
But since you said that if you're
going to give up this property

439
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:32,120
you need to replace it with a new one…

440
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:36,560
I'm here to take my brother's place.

441
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,200
Right, Dad?

442
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:55,520
Khun Aisoon, how did you get in here?

443
00:46:56,000 --> 00:46:57,560
Get out of my house now!

444
00:46:58,680 --> 00:46:59,920
I’m here to exchange our sons.

445
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,320
How the hell could you do this?!

446
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:09,440
It’s Zone’s decision.

447
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,880
That’s right.

448
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,000
This is my decision.

449
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:15,920
I’ve talked with Dad
about this for a while now.

450
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,920
Thanks for everything you’ve done for me.

451
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:21,600
Now it’s my turn to do something for you.

452
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:23,520
Zone, you can’t do this.

453
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,720
You think I’ll just accept this?

454
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:33,360
Didn’t I tell you both…
not to set foot here again?

455
00:47:33,680 --> 00:47:36,280
- Get out!
- Do you really want me to leave?

456
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:40,800
Can I trade myself for them?

457
00:47:58,440 --> 00:47:59,440
You should leave.

458
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,920
If you want to take Rames, go ahead.

459
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:07,600
Mother.

460
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:08,920
But Ramil has to stay.

461
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,680
A property must be traded for another.

462
00:48:20,280 --> 00:48:22,560
- Mother, what about me?
- Hold on.

463
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,960
How about a chat with your new fiancé?

464
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,000
Let me go.
You’re spouting nonsense.

465
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,560
Just go, Brother.
I’ll handle the rest.

466
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,400
You, come with me.

467
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,480
Cir.

468
00:48:41,520 --> 00:48:42,600
I’m sorry, son.

469
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:57,760
Ugh, let go of me!

470
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:01,240
Come on guys, I’m still here!

471
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:06,120
What a trouble maker.

472
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,200
Where are you going, Phu?

473
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:24,360
I’m going to buy you some water
so you can have some space to think.

474
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,440
I’m not running away.

475
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:28,720
Really?

476
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:33,800
Can you stay?

477
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,880
I’m sorry.

478
00:49:56,920 --> 00:49:58,280
You know what, P’ Cir?

479
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:01,720
You can be happy.

480
00:50:04,120 --> 00:50:05,320
Can I really?

481
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:09,160
Am I your happiness?

482
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:13,880
Yes.

483
00:50:15,320 --> 00:50:16,920
You’re my happiness.

484
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:38,440
Then... happiness will
stay with you forever.

485
00:50:48,680 --> 00:50:49,960
Thank you, Phu.

486
00:50:54,160 --> 00:50:56,040
You are the meaning of my life.

487
00:51:49,080 --> 00:51:50,360
P’ Cir, hurry up.

488
00:52:35,520 --> 00:52:36,520
Are you tired?

489
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:40,360
Tired from what?

490
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,360
Jeez, why are you making that face?

491
00:52:47,800 --> 00:52:48,960
The answer is no.

492
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,040
You’ve taken care of me for so
many years. You must be more tired.

493
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:56,440
- I’m not—
-Don’t lie.

494
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:02,320
I just want to take care of you.

495
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:06,960
But sometimes it might be... too much.

496
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:22,880
When I lose something, you’re
the one who finds it for me, right?

497
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:30,880
So… you know that I always forget
things, forget where I left them

498
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,080
or what I like to eat

499
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,200
because you’ve been watching me?

500
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:39,440
You like to eat bread with
green tea in the morning.

501
00:53:40,080 --> 00:53:42,960
And you always forget things
in the back pocket of your pants.

502
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:46,680
When it rains, you always
forget your umbrella.

503
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,320
And you eat soft-boiled
stewed eggs every Thursday.

504
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:55,160
So I told the shop owner
to keep some aside for you.

505
00:53:56,240 --> 00:53:59,440
As for… the lucky underwear.

506
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,200
It once fell onto my balcony.

507
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,480
What? Really?

508
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:06,720
Yeah.

509
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,520
What about the mole on my hip?

510
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,400
I saw you changing clothes
during the sports day.

511
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,360
Really?

512
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:28,200
Yes. That’s why I stood in
front of the tent to block the view.

513
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,360
So, what else?

514
00:54:41,400 --> 00:54:43,240
I was hit by a car because...

515
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,080
I saw the thieves trying
to break into your car.

516
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:50,840
That was my car?

517
00:54:51,360 --> 00:54:53,800
You mean when the thieves
came back to get back at you?

518
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:03,840
Phu, are you okay?
Are you angry with me?

519
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:08,160
I’m not angry.

520
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,200
I just never knew how much
you've done for me all this time.

521
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:14,160
And yet I still got angry with you.

522
00:55:17,840 --> 00:55:19,000
I’m sorry.

523
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:24,120
I was just upset and hurt that
you weren’t being honest with me.

524
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,120
All these years, I've
always thought I was lucky.

525
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,840
But I never knew someone
had been taking care of me.

526
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,160
I'm sorry for realizing it so late.

527
00:55:47,120 --> 00:55:48,560
It was my fault for being afraid.

528
00:55:49,800 --> 00:55:54,560
If I hadn’t been hit by that car,
I wouldn’t have seen a different future.

529
00:56:02,480 --> 00:56:06,800
But I swear, your scar really
disappeared at that time.

530
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,400
I wasn’t imagining things.

531
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:11,040
And you were like
a completely different person.

532
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:20,560
I may not come from a parallel world.

533
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:26,920
But what if I told you that…
parallel worlds are real?

534
00:56:28,680 --> 00:56:29,880
Would you believe me?

535
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:20,960
Phu?

536
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:00,000
Thanks.

537
00:58:02,080 --> 00:58:03,080
For what?

538
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,320
For helping me with those tight-lipped
club members and their budgets.

539
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,960
If you hadn’t helped me read their minds

540
00:58:10,280 --> 00:58:12,560
I’d probably still be stuck
on the financial statements.

541
00:58:15,200 --> 00:58:16,920
I’m glad I could help.

542
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:27,120
Can you hear what I’m thinking?

543
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,640
Nope.

544
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,760
Aren’t you gonna ask what I’m thinking?

545
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,960
So what are you thinking?

546
00:58:49,160 --> 00:58:50,200
I like you.

547
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:54,440
Come again?

548
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:57,000
I think I like you.

549
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:10,600
So... can I ask you to be my boyfriend?

550
00:59:16,800 --> 00:59:17,960
Will you be my boyfriend?

551
00:59:25,800 --> 00:59:26,800
Do you like me?

552
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:40,840
I’m so happy that you
speak what's on your mind.

553
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:56,760
P’ Cir, come over here.

554
01:00:29,440 --> 01:00:33,240
You once told me that
if you could turn back time

555
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:35,680
you’d answer me.

556
01:00:47,840 --> 01:00:49,480
Knock, knock, knock.

557
01:00:50,600 --> 01:00:51,600
Who’s there?

558
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:58,440
Nong Phukan calling P’ Cirrus.
Can you hear me?

559
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:06,320
If you hear me, please
send an alien signal back.

560
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:28,440
Cirrus, the one who loves Phukan.

561
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,280
Are you serious?

562
01:01:37,720 --> 01:01:40,200

I’m just telling the truth.
