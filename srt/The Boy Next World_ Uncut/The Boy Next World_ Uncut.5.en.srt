1
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:12,740
Why do you guys want me
and him to be together so much?

2
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:16,129
Because P’ Cir is the first one
to give all his attention to you

3
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:17,850
without even noticing us.

4
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:20,760
If I had noticed, we probably
would’ve talked sooner.

5
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,500
If you meet the me from this world

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,420
please be as kind to him
as you are to me right now.

7
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:26,740
You can hear?

8
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,820
Within a limited range.

9
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,890
You can do whatever you want.

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,630
But once you graduate,
your life will be in my hands.

11
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,810
Phu, I’m here.

12
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,300
Phu!

13
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,720
P’ Cir.

14
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,810
I’m sick.

15
00:01:30,789 --> 00:01:32,000
I’m here now, my boy.

16
00:01:33,700 --> 00:01:34,700
I’m here.

17
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,570
It’s okay now.

18
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,590
EP V: Truth and Memory

19
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,750
I'll go get the medicine for you.

20
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:51,270
Why were you late, P’ Cir?

21
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,010
I’m sorry.

22
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:03,200
I didn’t think it’d take this long.

23
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:05,600
I’m sick.

24
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:09,180
I have a fever, and
I can barely breathe.

25
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:12,000
My body’s still hot.
Go ahead and feel it.

26
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,750
And I couldn’t focus
in class at all yesterday.

27
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,810
I couldn’t even read what I
wrote down, and I kept nodding off.

28
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,180
So my friends told me to go home.

29
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:23,580
I’m sick, but I’m not that sick.

30
00:04:24,030 --> 00:04:25,780
My good grades are all thanks to the gang.

31
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:28,020
And this report counts
for 40% of the grade.

32
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:31,030
I don’t like being a burden to anyone.
I don’t want to be like this.

33
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:32,900
I feel so bad about it.

34
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:48,409
It’s okay, you didn’t do anything wrong.

35
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:58,520
Can you kiss me again, P' Cir?

36
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:34,550
What time did you take your medicine?

37
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:46,250
I bought you the sour soup.
Eat it so you take can your medicine.

38
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:05,240
Do you want me to help?

39
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,680
I don’t know.

40
00:07:12,350 --> 00:07:13,360
I can help.

41
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:19,680
I don’t know.

42
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:31,270
Why are you looking at me like that?

43
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,440
It's because of you that I’m like this.

44
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,490
You need to take your medicine.

45
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,470
No, not now.

46
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,650
Then when?

47
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,260
When it calms down.

48
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:56,620
Is that so?

49
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:18,830
What did you do in the bathroom?

50
00:10:19,830 --> 00:10:20,840
You really wanna know?

51
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:23,980
Not anymore.

52
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:33,940
Next time, you have
to tell me if you’re sick.

53
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,850
You went home,
so I didn’t want you to worry.

54
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:43,370
But there’s no one looking after you.

55
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,170
I can look after myself.

56
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,290
I’ve been doing it for years.

57
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:03,140
But now you have me.

58
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,810
I'll go get your medicine.

59
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
P’ Cir.

60
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:30,790
Can you… take care of me forever?

61
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,350
Never mind.

62
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,420
Forget it.

63
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:44,870
I’m sleepy. I should sleep.

64
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,680
P’ Cir.

65
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:00,530
Can you stay here tonight?

66
00:12:03,410 --> 00:12:04,520
Stay with me.

67
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,360
Sleep now.

68
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:24,590
I’ll stay by your side.

69
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,810
Get well soon, my boy.

70
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,400
Morning krub.

71
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,060
Morning.

72
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,090
Why do you look like you’ve seen a ghost?

73
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,180
It’s morning, time to wake up.

74
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,060
What’s wrong, P’ Cir?

75
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:54,340
Weren’t you sick, Phu?
Feeling better now?

76
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,090
I’m not sick.

77
00:13:59,930 --> 00:14:01,780
You’re sick. Yes, you are.

78
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:03,170
Yesterday—

79
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,120
You still had a fever.

80
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,030
I...

81
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:14,130
Can I touch you?

82
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,870
Who are you? You’re not P’ Cir.

83
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:22,810
P’ Cir wouldn’t do this.

84
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,850
- Phu.
- You’re not my P’ Cir.

85
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,320
What did you do to my P’ Cir?

86
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,520
- Phu, please listen to me.
- Let go.

87
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,790
Phu, hear me out.

88
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,480
Phu! Phu!

89
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:57,040
How does it feel to see a different future?

90
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,980
What do you mean?

91
00:15:14,630 --> 00:15:16,410
You have your Phukan.

92
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,840
And I have my Phukan in my world too.

93
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,800
I’m asking, what do you mean?

94
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,690
Different paths...

95
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:35,000
lead to different futures.

96
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:38,970
If you want a future with Phu...

97
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:43,180
then stop being a coward.

98
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,940
Time to wake up.

99
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,680
This fucking dream again.

100
00:16:51,210 --> 00:16:52,590
I’m sorry for lying.

101
00:16:58,250 --> 00:17:01,320
If I’d told you that I’m not
from a parallel world that day

102
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:04,069
would you have been mad at me?

103
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:11,339
I liked you so much that I deluded
myself into thinking I answered you.

104
00:17:12,369 --> 00:17:13,680
That I was your boyfriend.

105
00:17:17,869 --> 00:17:21,950
I made it all up in my head
and ended up dreaming about it.

106
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:29,130
But when I saw a different picture...

107
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,600
I really wanted that picture to come true.

108
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:41,250
And I don’t want to be a stranger...

109
00:17:45,450 --> 00:17:46,940
...to you anymore.

110
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,100
Four Years Ago

111
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:32,120
Ai Cir, you know what movie my dad got?

112
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:34,220
Fuck, it’s such an indie film.

113
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,750
The entire movie has nothing
in it except a single image.

114
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:40,920
The story’s told through dialogue
and ambient sounds.That’s all.

115
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,290
It was so fucking boring.

116
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,870
But you know what?
I watched it to the end.

117
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:48,940
You think I like indie films? I think I do.

118
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:51,200
I think you like indie films.

119
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:52,820
Phu, let’s play hooky.

120
00:18:53,790 --> 00:18:56,470
You can’t. If you skip again,
the teacher’s gonna kill me.

121
00:18:56,490 --> 00:18:58,010
Jeez, what a teacher’s pet.

122
00:18:58,050 --> 00:19:00,070
Teacher’s pet, teacher’s
pet, teacher’s pet!

123
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,360
- I’m out! Catch me if you can!
- Wait!

124
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,900
Hey, don’t run in the hallway!

125
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,090
We’re sorry. Hey! Don’t run!

126
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:18,150
Hey, do you know that
senior, P’ Cir, from Grade 12?

127
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:19,700
Why?

128
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:21,390
I fucking hate that guy.

129
00:19:21,970 --> 00:19:24,090
The dude that all
the girls are crazy about?

130
00:19:24,330 --> 00:19:27,560
He looks like a total asshole.
How the hell do they fangirl over him?

131
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,090
And I just got yelled at by the teacher.

132
00:19:30,590 --> 00:19:31,590
You know what she said?

133
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,300
‘You should try harder in class.
Look at Rames in Grade 12.’

134
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:39,930
‘He can get into any university.
He’s got a bright future ahead of him.’

135
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,600
How many do you think he’s banged?

136
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,120
Probably tons.

137
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,560
Damn it.

138
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:53,220
By the way, I heard his family’s rich.

139
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,010
You think he bribed the teacher?

140
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,670
Maybe he saw the exam beforehand.
That’s why he got a perfect score.

141
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,980
I think you're talking nonsense.

142
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:03,470
You guys are just jealous
that the girls like him

143
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,730
because he’s competent, right?

144
00:20:06,190 --> 00:20:10,150
But you don't know how much
effort he put in to get this good.

145
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,070
Nobody’s born competent.

146
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,140
He might've spent his
time taking extra classes

147
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,800
and doing practice exams.

148
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,020
Unlike you guys, who keep playing around.

149
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:22,550
And we don’t even know him that well.

150
00:20:22,610 --> 00:20:25,330
You should spend your time doing
homework before you get yelled at.

151
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:26,830
He's in good guy mode again.

152
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:29,380
You make me feel like
a total dick every time.

153
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,930
I’m not. You’re clearly jealous of him.

154
00:20:32,420 --> 00:20:35,140
Try putting in as much effort as he does.

155
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Ai Wim.

156
00:20:40,290 --> 00:20:41,290
Wim.

157
00:20:44,090 --> 00:20:47,550
Can you make friends with
Nong Phukan in Grade 10 for me?

158
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,720
Me?

159
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,870
Yeah. I’m begging you.

160
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:43,340
You’re awake?

161
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:46,000
What were you doing, P’ Cir?

162
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,260
Tying the paper cup phone to the balcony.

163
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,500
So you don’t have to
lean over. It’s dangerous.

164
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:05,840
Phu.

165
00:22:07,210 --> 00:22:08,570
I have something to tell you.

166
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,670
What was that?

167
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,920
No, it’s nothing.

168
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:28,990
What? You make me curious.

169
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:37,930
I just wanted to say
that you didn’t button up.

170
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:11,090
I haven’t showered since yesterday.

171
00:23:12,290 --> 00:23:14,240
I’m going to take a shower.

172
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:33,620
Don’t you dare, Ai Phu.

173
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,650
Keep in mind, you’re just the substitute.

174
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:19,230
I’ll have the pork chop
with cheesy baked spinach

175
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:21,020
and one portion of BBQ chicken wings.

176
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:23,150
Make it quick, quick, quick, please.

177
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,220
Why are you ordering so much, Achi?

178
00:24:25,290 --> 00:24:26,710
What I eat is my damn business.

179
00:24:27,470 --> 00:24:28,980
I’ll have the fish and chips, please.

180
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:30,740
Spicy grilled chicken steak, please.

181
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,210
I’ll have the lemon smoothie too.

182
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,840
When are you gonna stop ordering?

183
00:24:34,860 --> 00:24:37,060
I need a drink, damn it.

184
00:24:37,340 --> 00:24:39,390
What if I choke on the pork chop and die?

185
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,670
Then I’ll have the striploin, please.

186
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,230
What about you, Phu?

187
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,030
How about the fish salad?
I’ll get you the soup.

188
00:24:51,130 --> 00:24:53,050
Sounds good, it’ll make
it easier to swallow.

189
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:57,020
Jeez, you think Ai Phu’s
a three-year-old or something?

190
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,730
That won’t be enough for him.

191
00:24:59,210 --> 00:25:00,630
Ai Phu, get the pork chop like me.

192
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,170
Come on, Phu’s sick. It’ll
be too heavy for the stomach.

193
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,780
Fish steak's better.

194
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:06,820
That’s right. How
about the salmon steak?

195
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,450
Yeah, I’ll go with that.

196
00:25:09,870 --> 00:25:10,880
He’ll go wit that.

197
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,710
So…

198
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:32,180
- Why is he here too?
- Didn’t you invite him?

199
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:35,640
Fuck! I invited him out of politeness!

200
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,700
Who would’ve thought
that Ai Phu was with him?

201
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,820
I thought he was sick
and had nothing to eat.

202
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,280
Imagine how shocked I was when
I found a guy in our friend's room!

203
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:46,300
I almost grabbed him by the collar

204
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:48,280
and asked what the fuck
he did to my friend.

205
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:50,940
But when he looked at me…

206
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,550
You punched him in the face?

207
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,880
I paid respect to him

208
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:56,180
and asked if he wanted
to join us for a meal.

209
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,590
Pretty smooth, right?

210
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:00,690
I’ll take the same as Phu.

211
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:12,830
Me?

212
00:26:13,930 --> 00:26:17,490
So, why were you with Phu, P’ Cir?

213
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:21,300
Oh, I was sick, so P’ Cir stayed over.

214
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
Stayed over?

215
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,180
Together?

216
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,990
We’ve been living together
for a long time now.

217
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:32,150
- Living together?
- For a long time too?

218
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:38,030
What Ai Phu means is that they’ve
been living in the same condo.

219
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:40,630
P’ Cir heard Ai Phu was
sick, so he took care of him.

220
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,840
- Oh.
- Oh.

221
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,850
Why did you guys make that sound?

222
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,950
- Nothing!
- Nothing!

223
00:26:49,110 --> 00:26:52,410
- That’s our normal voices, right?
- Yes. Really.

224
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:54,070
Yeah, completely normal.

225
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:01,280
I thought Ai Phu got his cherry
popped. Dude’s too naive.

226
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:06,600
Aw, I thought they were
living together. What a shame.

227
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:10,770
It’s kind of concerning
that Phu’s so clueless.

228
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,750
As his best friend,
it’s my duty to protect him.

229
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:21,130
How should I hint to Phu
that P' Cir likes him?

230
00:27:21,790 --> 00:27:22,790
I’m so worried.

231
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:30,410
His face’s still red.
Is the fever coming back?

232
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:32,930
I shouldn’t have let Phu come downstairs.

233
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,770
He took his meds three hours ago.

234
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:39,970
Though he said he was feeling
better, but I’m still worried.

235
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:44,320
When he gets better, there’s
something I want to tell him.

236
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,990
So hungry. When’s the food coming?

237
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,340
It’s loud as usual today.

238
00:28:14,570 --> 00:28:17,430
Damn it, Ai Cir, took
you forever to call me.

239
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,810
I was about to die waiting.

240
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,190
What do you want?

241
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,510
You went to your mom’s place yesterday?

242
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:30,860
Ai Cir, are you okay? What
did that hag do to you this time?

243
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,480
Don’t you laugh.

244
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:35,970
I was worried sick about you.

245
00:28:36,110 --> 00:28:39,260
I thought that old bat was gonna
chain you up and lock you in her house.

246
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,120
She’s such a fucking selfish woman.

247
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,900
When I realized where you were,
I immediately called your brother.

248
00:28:46,430 --> 00:28:47,640
But he's not any better.

249
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:50,610
I don’t get how you two can be so calm.

250
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:53,120
Your mom’s a nightmare,
and you’re both just chilling?

251
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,470
What’s the point of blowing up?

252
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,200
And you think she’ll turn into
a fairy godmother if you stay calm?

253
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:07,650
She called me over because
my dad came to see me last week.

254
00:29:11,230 --> 00:29:13,590
So that’s why Ai Zone told me to calm down.

255
00:29:15,230 --> 00:29:17,800
Didn’t your dad come to see you
while you were hospitalized?

256
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:21,010
But isn’t that hag too much?

257
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:24,470
You were in the hospital, but
she didn’t even bother showing up.

258
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,960
But the minute your dad came,
she was all like, 'this is my son!'

259
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:31,190
Fucking ridiculous.

260
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,780
Is that all you wanted to ask?

261
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:38,130
Hey, don’t hang up yet.
Prof. Kate asked for you.

262
00:29:38,630 --> 00:29:39,950
She wants you to go find her

263
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:41,100
when you get to the uni.

264
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,400
You’ve skipped class for three Fridays now.

265
00:29:43,430 --> 00:29:45,740
Everyone’s handed in their work except you.

266
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,160
Okay, I’ll go in on Monday.

267
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,070
You’re unbelieveable, Ai Cir.

268
00:29:51,230 --> 00:29:53,360
I know why you're like this.

269
00:29:53,690 --> 00:29:56,190
But can you please try making some friends?

270
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,970
Ty to open up a little.

271
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,560
At least try to find
a friend or two in the class.

272
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:03,690
- But not ones like Ai Rome.
- Can I talk to your friend?

273
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:07,080
That freak spends all
day talking about fish.

274
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,270
Listening to him ramble
on about deep-sea fish

275
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:11,540
makes me wanna hang myself every time.

276
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:14,130
Do you have any idea
how tough it is for me?

277
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,100
Everyone keeps asking me.

278
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:19,130
‘What’s wrong with P’ Cir?
Is he mad at me?’

279
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,820
‘Hey Ai Wim, what
the hell’s up with Ai Cir?’

280
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:25,390
‘Ai Wim, can you borrow Ai Cir’s
notes and make a copy for me?’

281
00:30:26,780 --> 00:30:28,250
Why the hell can’t they just ask you

282
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:29,270
these simple questions—

283
00:30:29,290 --> 00:30:30,580
Wanna watch a movie with me?

284
00:30:36,350 --> 00:30:37,360
Who the hell are you?

285
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:40,730
There’s a film festival next month.

286
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,880
You’ll enjoy it if you like movies.

287
00:30:44,670 --> 00:30:45,670
You little bastard.

288
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,440
I may be younger than you

289
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,680
but I’m nowhere
near being called little.

290
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,440
Are you messing with me?

291
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,280
I’m just standing,
not messing with you at all.

292
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:57,360
Ugh, you’re doing it now!

293
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,990
And how come you're with Ai Cir?

294
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,190
You asked me about P' Cir,
so I told him about you.

295
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:04,060
He called you.

296
00:31:04,390 --> 00:31:06,200
So I asked him if I could talk to you.

297
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,290
You’re fucking messing with me.

298
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,260
I told you I’m not.

299
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:13,340
So, are you gonna
watch a movie with me?

300
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,920
Why the hell would I go?

301
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:25,430
You know Ai Wim?

302
00:31:27,380 --> 00:31:29,150
He’s asked Ai Phu about you before.

303
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:32,920
You think he’ll watch a movie with me?

304
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:36,630
Why don’t you ask him?

305
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,340
Why is it silent?

306
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,270
You’re keeping your mind blank?

307
00:31:55,310 --> 00:31:56,450
Because you’re with me, huh?

308
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,880
No one goes without thinking.

309
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:08,230
Whether it’s a lot or a little,
we all think in the end.

310
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:11,050
No one likes having their thoughts read.

311
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:13,820
But you think when you’re with Phu.

312
00:32:14,970 --> 00:32:15,970
A lot too.

313
00:32:16,540 --> 00:32:18,790
I’ve never hidden my feelings for him.

314
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,600
Not even a single day.

315
00:32:21,350 --> 00:32:24,210
I don’t care if anyone knows.

316
00:32:28,570 --> 00:32:31,930
If P' Wim won’t watch a movie
with me, I’ll have to ask Phu.

317
00:32:38,550 --> 00:32:39,570
You’re cursing.

318
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:45,970
Leave it to me.

319
00:32:56,120 --> 00:32:58,400
See you, Phu.
Sawasdee ka, P’ Cir.

320
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,690
See you on Monday.

321
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,180
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

322
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,590
Are you okay, P’ Cir?

323
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,690
Why?

324
00:33:19,660 --> 00:33:23,880
Well… you look like
you’re lost in your thoughts.

325
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:28,340
No, it’s nothing.

326
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,820
I’m sorry. They were a bit noisy.

327
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:35,810
I’m the one who should apologize.

328
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:37,760
About what?

329
00:33:38,350 --> 00:33:39,980
Your friends rushed back because of me.

330
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:42,470
It’s okay, I’ll see them on Monday anyway.

331
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:46,110
By the way, don’t tease Ai Achi too much.

332
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,950
He’s scared of out his wits now.

333
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:49,650
I didn’t do anything.

334
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:54,730
Oh, so you’re saying
you’re naturally intimidating?

335
00:33:56,530 --> 00:33:58,560
So, did P’ Wim need anything?

336
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:02,700
Ai Jin said you stepped out to call him.

337
00:34:11,969 --> 00:34:13,770
He called because he found out

338
00:34:13,800 --> 00:34:15,300
I was summoned home
because of my dad.

339
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,320
What’s so strange about that?

340
00:34:21,010 --> 00:34:23,650
It’s strange because my parents
 divorced when I was eight.

341
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:32,270
I shouldn’t have asked.

342
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,350
I don’t mind.

343
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:36,389
It’s between the two of them.

344
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:39,070
And it happened a long time ago.

345
00:34:41,429 --> 00:34:42,650
Do you still want to know?

346
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:48,150
I do. I want to know about you.

347
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,989
I have one younger brother.

348
00:34:57,770 --> 00:34:59,560
When they divorced...

349
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:05,950
my dad took my brother to live
with him and left me with my mom.

350
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,530
It seems like a perfect arrangement.

351
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,080
But the problem is…

352
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,660
that woman doesn’t
see me as her son at all.

353
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:21,790
Why?

354
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,310
I don’t know, Phu.

355
00:35:25,470 --> 00:35:31,110
She probably sees me as
the best tool to get revenge on my dad.

356
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:34,290
To make him pay for filing for divorce.

357
00:35:36,570 --> 00:35:40,900
She felt humiliated and
embarrassed because of it.

358
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,480
She said that the divorce made
her too ashamed to face people.

359
00:35:49,070 --> 00:35:51,720
It shouldn’t be like that.
You’re her child.

360
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:53,780
It doesn’t matter, Phu.

361
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:59,300
For that woman, she always
has to be number one.

362
00:36:02,090 --> 00:36:03,440
She’s always right.

363
00:36:05,510 --> 00:36:07,950
I must admit that
my dad's really impressive

364
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,840
for putting up with her
for almost ten years.

365
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:19,990
Even though she hurt every
woman who got close to him.

366
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,520
And the funny thing is…

367
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:30,820
family was never her priority.

368
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,940
Work always came first.

369
00:36:35,610 --> 00:36:39,160
Family was just for appearances for her.

370
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,880
But when she was humiliated, she got upset.

371
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,260
But that’s not family.

372
00:36:52,330 --> 00:36:54,040
That’s exactly what family is to me.

373
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,780
I was told to study.

374
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,240
To be the best.

375
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,570
I had to obey everything that woman said.

376
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:10,810
I grew up like this.

377
00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:16,490
Ai Wim once asked me to skip school.

378
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:19,780
But as soon as she found out

379
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,630
she ordered my nanny to
beat me until she was satisfied.

380
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,450
Ai Wim was there when I was being beaten.

381
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:36,100
No matter how much he begged
her to beat him too, she wouldn’t.

382
00:37:38,250 --> 00:37:40,070
The cruel part was that…

383
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,680
she forced him to…

384
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,440
…watch me get beaten…

385
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,250
…until I couldn’t walk.

386
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:04,330
When his parents found
out, they were furious.

387
00:38:04,780 --> 00:38:09,110
They were really angry, but they
couldn’t do anything to that woman.

388
00:38:25,630 --> 00:38:27,460
I used to envy other kids.

389
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:30,950
They got to play and have fun.

390
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:33,130
Because I never did.

391
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:37,540
But it didn’t take long
for me to realize that

392
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:40,420
I shouldn’t want anything at all.

393
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:47,070
Knowing how painful it was
to never have something…

394
00:38:52,870 --> 00:38:54,410
…shutting off my emotions…

395
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:58,280
…might be easier.

396
00:38:59,750 --> 00:39:00,760
P’ Cir.

397
00:39:05,170 --> 00:39:06,640
Until I met you, Phu.

398
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:16,950
You’re the reason I want
to fight for the first time.

399
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,280
You’ve got me.

400
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,610
You said you never had fun, right?

401
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:34,060
Let’s go, P’ Cir.

402
00:39:38,860 --> 00:39:41,670
Do what? Phu, no. Phu!

403
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,760
Here.

404
00:39:54,450 --> 00:39:55,450
It’s okay.

405
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,340
Try again.

406
00:40:45,590 --> 00:40:46,590
I failed too.

407
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,090
It’s okay, we still have more coins.

408
00:41:40,770 --> 00:41:45,550

409
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:43,880

It’s so cute.

415
00:42:05,870 --> 00:42:08,130
Should I buy you a new one? A bigger one.

416
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:12,400
No way, you put so much
effort into catching this.

417
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,270
And you’ve already given it to me.

418
00:42:18,370 --> 00:42:19,440
It’s a keepsake.

419
00:42:19,870 --> 00:42:22,140
But it’s such a tiny one.

420
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:28,260
That doesn’t matter.
It’s a trophy of honor.

421
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:31,310
So, how did you feel
when you finally caught it?

422
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:36,140
I feel like buying one
would’ve been cheaper.

423
00:42:38,450 --> 00:42:40,650
It’s about honor and pride, P' Cir.

424
00:42:41,130 --> 00:42:43,600
You don’t get the same pride
buying it as you do catching it.

425
00:42:44,610 --> 00:42:47,560
And you shed blood and tears for this.

426
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:50,950
Do you come here often?

427
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,860
Yeah, I used to come with Ai Achi.

428
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:56,290
But not so much lately.

429
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,240
My friend’s distracted by a girl.
Or maybe a guy?

430
00:43:00,760 --> 00:43:02,480
He’s the type who can’t live without love.

431
00:43:02,590 --> 00:43:04,880
If he’s single today, he’ll
find a partner by tomorrow.

432
00:43:05,250 --> 00:43:06,750
That’s why we don’t
come here as much.

433
00:43:07,560 --> 00:43:09,440
I know it’s a waste of money

434
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:14,250
but I live by the rule that
if it’s fun, it’s worth it.

435
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,290
And today, it was worth it.

436
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,630
P’ Cir, let’s take a photo.

437
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:37,180
Come on.

438
00:43:52,170 --> 00:43:53,170
Smile, P’ Cir.

439
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:01,600
Give me a smile. A scowl
doesn’t look good on you.

440
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,090
I am smiling.

441
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:06,520
A straight line isn’t a smile.

442
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:08,680
Do it like this.

443
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:12,550
But this is the best I can do.

444
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:14,490
That’s not true.

445
00:44:14,900 --> 00:44:16,970
You usually smile for
me way more than this.

446
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,480
Hurry up, it’s counting down.

447
00:44:29,130 --> 00:44:30,360
Can I do this instead?

448
00:44:34,150 --> 00:44:38,130
I told you to smile for
the camera, not do this.

449
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,240
I think…

450
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,880
I’d better do this instead.

451
00:45:14,330 --> 00:45:16,060
You said you’ve never had fun.

452
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,050
You said you’ve never felt anything.

453
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:19,880
That’s clearly not true.

454
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:21,720
You’re so skilled at this.

455
00:45:22,150 --> 00:45:24,160
How can I believe
you have only that Phukan?

456
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:28,230
And I told you to smile, not to kiss.

457
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:31,540
I’ll take this one.

458
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:33,770
This is mine.

459
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:35,780
Exchange for this.

460
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,530
I just want a keepsake too.

461
00:45:49,790 --> 00:45:50,920
You're still angry with me?

462
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:52,470
I’m not angry.

463
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,090
You clearly are.

464
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,720
Can you read my mind?
How did you know I’m angry?

465
00:46:00,550 --> 00:46:01,560
I can’t do that.

466
00:46:02,810 --> 00:46:07,880
In that case, can you tell
me if you’re angry with me?

467
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:11,440
I’m not angry.

468
00:46:12,380 --> 00:46:15,190
I’m… embarrassed.

469
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:22,830
Did you have fun today?

470
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:28,360
What if I said it was
the best day of my life?

471
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,260
That’s enough.

472
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,820
As long as you’re
happy, I’ll give it to you.

473
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:40,320
You mean… give me a kiss?

474
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:42,140
I meant the photostrip.

475
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:01,490
Khun Sisira.

476
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:02,520
Yes?

477
00:47:05,390 --> 00:47:07,630
How did you know my name?

478
00:47:08,880 --> 00:47:09,940
That’s not important.

479
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:13,810
It’s important.
This is an invasion of privacy.

480
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:16,980
Do you have business with me?

481
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:19,080
Yes.

482
00:47:19,430 --> 00:47:21,110
You know Khun Rames, don’t you?

483
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:23,960
P’ Cir.

484
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:30,560
And what does that have to do with you?

485
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:35,300
His mother asked me to find
out how much money you'd want...

486
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:38,180
…to break up with her son.

487

English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

488
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:38,370
Ai Cir, are you really gonna go to
the university that old hag told you to?

489
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:39,970
Do I even have a choice?

490
00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,460
If you don’t want to,
just run away abroad.

491
00:48:48,110 --> 00:48:50,040
P’ Wim, I’m here to submit
the evaluation forms.

492
00:48:51,500 --> 00:48:54,770
You call on me for everything.
It’s always Phukan now.

493
00:48:55,270 --> 00:48:56,670
I’m not the class rep, you know.

494
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,380
Come on, just consider
it as helping me out.

495
00:49:00,620 --> 00:49:01,620
I’ll leave them here.

496
00:49:02,460 --> 00:49:05,140
If there’s nothing else,
I’ll go home now.

497
00:49:06,310 --> 00:49:07,320
Wait, Phu.

498
00:49:08,500 --> 00:49:09,510
Yes?

499
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:14,290
Is there a university you're aiming for?

500
00:49:18,700 --> 00:49:19,710
Yes.

501
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:24,460
I want to attend the university
where my dad studied.

502
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:30,160
I want to go to…

503
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:41,790
I gotta go.

504
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:42,880
Bye-bye.

505
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:48,900
Luck’s on your side.

506
00:49:55,560 --> 00:49:56,560
Sawasdee krub.

507
00:49:56,680 --> 00:49:58,850
Hey! Why are you with Phu, Ai Zone?

508
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:00,460
Mom sent someone to deal with Phu.

509
00:50:00,670 --> 00:50:01,460
What?

510
00:50:01,490 --> 00:50:04,500
She sent someone to ask
how much money he’d want

511
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:05,690
to break up with you.

512
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:07,950
Why don’t you just date Ai Cir?

513
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,000
Since you guys are already a couple

514
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:12,260
why not just move in together?

515
00:50:13,290 --> 00:50:16,590
Can you promise me
you won’t go anywhere?

516
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:20,840
As long as you want me
to stay, I’ll be right here.
