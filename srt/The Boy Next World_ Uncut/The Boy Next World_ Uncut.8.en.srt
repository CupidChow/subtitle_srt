1
00:00:10,040 --> 00:00:11,960
You’re getting offerings
for your dad, right?

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:13,200
Let me come with you.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,040
Why are you standing here, Phu?

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:15,880
P’ Thorn.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:17,720
- Who’s this?
- I'm Phu's boyfriend.

6
00:00:18,040 --> 00:00:20,960
You were oblivious, so I had
to make things more obvious.

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:22,120
I’m hitting on you.

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,600
From now on, I’ll be the
one playing the flute for you.

9
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,000
I can’t ask to prolong
this any longer, P’ Cir.

10
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,600
You need to go back.

11
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:33,880
Phu!

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,160
P’ Cir, don’t leave me like this!

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:47,840
I don’t want you
to leave like this, P’ Cir!

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:51,160
Shit, we ran down the wrong guy.

15
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,920
That’s Khun Rames.

16
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,400
You promised you wouldn’t leave me, P’ Cir!

17
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,560
Come on, wake up, P’ Cir!

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,520
Take him! Come on! Hurry!

19
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,880
- Let me go!
- Come on!

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,080
Let me go, damn it!

21
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,800
Hurry up!

22
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,280
Hey! Where are you taking P’ Cir?!

23
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,600
Hey!

24
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,280
Hey!

25
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:23,320
P’ Wim! Help me!
Please help P’ Cir!

26
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
They’ve taken him, P’ Wim!

27
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,560
- Are you sure it's this hospital?
- Yes.

28
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,480
Dad had it checked and confirmed it,
but it took longer than we expected.

29
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:16,880
Hang on, Zone.

30
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,840
Phu, you sure you’re okay?

31
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,880
Yes, I’m fine.

32
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,400
But it’s P’ Cir I’m worried about.

33
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:29,320
I saw him get knocked down
right in front of me, and… and…

34
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,800
He'll be fine.
He has to be fine.

35
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,400
That's right, stay positive.
Someone like Ai Cir won't die easily.

36
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:53,960
Let’s go.

37
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:03,120
Hey!

38
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,880
How the hell could you do
this to P’ Cir!? How could you!?

39
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,080
Calm down, Phu.

40
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,240
Khun Ramil.

41
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,240
Glad you still remember me.

42
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,600
I heard about my brother’s
accident, so I’m here to visit.

43
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,120
Khun Ratri doesn’t allow visitors.

44
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,680
Didn’t know my mom was a doctor
who gets to decide who can and can’t visit.

45
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,360
Khun Ratri has only one son.

46
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,800
So it's only natural
for her to be worried.

47
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,360
I already know that.

48
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,720
Whether it's now or later,
she has only one son.

49
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,080
Because if something
happens to my brother...

50
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:56,640
you know who that one
son will be, don't you?

51
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:02,800
And who you’ll have to serve in the future.

52
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,960
Don't forget that my mom needs an heir.

53
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,600
Think twice before you do anything.

54
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,880
I’ll inform Khun Ratri first.

55
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
Go ahead.

56
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,640
Phu, calm down.

57
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,600
I know. I…

58
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,159
Sorry, I’m just angry.

59
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,800
I understand,
but if we want to see Ai Cir

60
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:38,320
we need to hold it in no matter
how much we want to kill this bastard.

61
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,040
- Zone.
- Hang on.

62
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:57,880
Go ahead.

63
00:05:58,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Hold on.

64
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,800
Khun Ratree has a message for you.

65
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:09,200
As soon as she arrives,
you must get out of her sight.

66
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,560
Then give her my message.

67
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:17,000
She'll be seeing my face
so much, she'll get sick of it.

68
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,400
I'll go talk to the doctor first.

69
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,880
P’ Cir, I’m sorry.

70
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,080
If I hadn’t run away from you,
none of this would have happened.

71
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:42,120
Why did you do that?

72
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:48,840
If something happens to you,
I'll never forgive myself.

73
00:07:56,520 --> 00:08:01,480
As long as you wake up,
I'll do whatever you say.

74
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,520
There's something I want to say to you too.

75
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,040
So please wake up soon.

76
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,640
You’re awake, P’ Cir?

77
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,880
Are you hurt anywhere?

78
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,679
Are you okay?

79
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,600
Who are you?

80
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,880
EP VIII: Cirrus’s Time Dimension

81
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,040
We meet again.

82
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Phu.

83
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,400
Calm down and listen to me.

84
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:51,240
The doctor says
Ai Cir might have memory loss.

85
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,960
What if it's more than that, P’ Wim?

86
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,480
What else could it be?
He's already awake.

87
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,160
Or you're saying he’s gone
back to some parallel world?

88
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,880
I've heard enough from you.

89
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,960
Since there's nothing wrong
with me, just let me go home.

90
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,800
As I informed you earlier.

91
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,680
We need to monitor
your condition for a while.

92
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:36,160
- You've suffered a head injury—
- Enough.

93
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:37,800
I don’t want to hear it.

94
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:41,640
All your talking is giving me a headache.

95
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
The IV tube is really annoying.

96
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
Well then, I'll take my leave now.

97
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,840
Suit yourself, doc.

98
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,880
If it weren’t for the order, you
wouldn’t be here with me all day.

99
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,280
How are you feeling, P’ Cir?

100
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:12,880
Why are you crying?

101
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
Sorry?

102
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,480
I’m asking why you're crying.

103
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,760
And why are you in my room?

104
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,000
And why did you leave
right after you called the doctor?

105
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:29,880
Well, the doctor had to check on you.

106
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,080
- And you were hit by a car—
- I’m asking why you left.

107
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,960
You came and left as you pleased.

108
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,640
Do you think this is a convenience store

109
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,440
where you can come
and go as you please?

110
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:46,000
That’s because you don’t know me.

111
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,480
Don’t do this again.

112
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,520
It’s annoying.

113
00:13:02,080 --> 00:13:03,080
What?

114
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:10,680
I...

115
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,480
I don’t like it.

116
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:25,200
What don’t you like?

117
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Me?

118
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,320
No.

119
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:34,800
Tears.

120
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,240
I don’t like people getting
all teary in front of me.

121
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,960
What’s the point of crying?
Tears won't solve anything.

122
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,880
Your name is Phu, right?

123
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,600
Don't cry in front of me again.

124
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,480
I don’t like it.

125
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:05,400
Do you really not remember me?

126
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,480
Why should I remember you?

127
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,600
- Not even just a bit?
- No.

128
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,960
So persistent.

129
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:13,360
Why?

130
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:29,920
All I remember is having a fever
and falling asleep at the condo.

131
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,160
Next thing I knew, I woke up here.

132
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
That’s all?

133
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:38,160
That’s all.

134
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,200
The scar.

135
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:54,840
Your scar.

136
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,800
- Where’s your scar?
- What are you doing?

137
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,200
- Your scar.
- What are you doing?

138
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
- The scar on your forehead.
- What scar?

139
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,560
Look who finally showed up.

140
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,000
You’re P’ Cir’s mother.

141
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,760
Why did you only show up now?
He’s been in the hospital since yesterday.

142
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,480
Rames.

143
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,640
I just came by to let you know.

144
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,240
Meet Lukprae, your fiancée.

145
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:44,800
Long time no see, Cir.

146
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,720
From this moment on…

147
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,520
I’ll be your fiancée.

148
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,840
Let me out.
I need to go find Phu.

149
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,440
You can’t leave.
It’s not time yet.

150
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,160
Then when the hell is that?!

151
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:26,360
Phu’s about to get hit by a car.

152
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,600
I need to go help him now.
Let me out!

153
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Phu’s fine.

154
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,760
Phu will be alright.

155
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
How do you know that?

156
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,760
Because he will be safe in every world.

157
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
What do you mean?

158
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,280
We are all skeptical
no matter time dimension.

159
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,280
Come on.

160
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,800
I know that deep down, you have
an inkling that this can’t be just a dream.

161
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,800
What is this place?

162
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:21,839
No idea.

163
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,400
I thought it was inside my mind.

164
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:27,119
But the previous Cirrus said...

165
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,400
it’s a time dimension.

166
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,360
What do you mean by
‘the previous Cirrus’?

167
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:36,880
The previous Cirrus,
and the ones before him.

168
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,680
And the ones before them.

169
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:42,840
As for the reason we ended up here.

170
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:45,760
The answer is, I don’t know.

171
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:50,160
Why can we see other worlds’ timelines?

172
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,400
I have no idea either.

173
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:55,640
And why are we brought together like this?

174
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,880
Still no idea.

175
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:02,040
But all I know is that the previous Cirrus

176
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,720
would pull us towards
an identity named Phukan.

177
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:13,680
Just like how you saw
my world and my Phukan.

178
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,680
It’s easier if I show you.

179
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,480
Nong Grade 10 calling
P’ Grade 12, is anyone there?

180
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,600
If you hear me, please
send an alien signal back.

181
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:59,560
If Nong Grade 10 wants the cup
back, you have to guess who I am.

182
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:07,520
On that day, in my world, I answered him.

183
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,840
I answered him because
I had a dream the night before.

184
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:43,640
A very long one at that.

185
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,200
I saw myself and Phukan in another world.

186
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:53,240
A world where it took us
over ten years to finally meet.

187
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,160
And the previous guy showed me.

188
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,200
Wanna see?

189
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,400
Wait!

190
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,720
- Sawasdee krub, Khun Rames.
- Please go ahead.

191
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:38,640
Hold on, wait for me!

192
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,440
Why the long face?

193
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:58,600
Your happiness might just fly away.

194
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:00,880
I’m not your friend.

195
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:07,760
I’m sorry.

196
00:21:08,840 --> 00:21:12,800
Give me your name.
I'll notify HR to issue a warning.

197
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:15,880
But I was just greeting you.
I haven’t done anything yet—

198
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:18,480
Then you should make an effort
to learn some basic information

199
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,400
so you can know who's who around here.

200
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:26,000
It’ll help you figure out the right
way to greet someone like me.

201
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,680
We all have different personalities.

202
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,280
But one thing we have in common
is that Phukan will change us.

203
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:42,600
He was too mean to Phukan in this world.

204
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:51,960
If you can’t handle this simple
paperwork, what can you even do?

205
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,880
Do it again.

206
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:56,600
He’d keep being mean to Phukan...

207
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,720
if it weren’t for that incident.

208
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,240
Someone like you should
just die, you bastard!

209
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:09,560
Khun Cir!

210
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,960
Khun Cir, look at me.

211
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:13,280
Khun Cir.

212
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:16,040
Don’t fall asleep, Khun Cir.
Look at me.

213
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,800
- Khun Cir!
- Because of the stabbing, he saw...

214
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,440
...another world…

215
00:22:27,240 --> 00:22:29,800
I offer my condolences
to Khun Ramil’s family.

216
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,480
…different from his.

217
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,000
Tired, stubborn kid?

218
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:43,040
Along with many others.

219
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,880
Ozone!

220
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,640
Get it now?

221
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,160
We are all different.

222
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,720
But the one thing we have in
common is Phukan, our only light.

223
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,840
The guy before me made me see it.

224
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:24,520
Now it’s my turn to show you.

225
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:33,000
And in the future

226
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:39,480
it’ll be your duty to make
the next Cirrus see it too.

227
00:23:40,040 --> 00:23:42,400
Let me out.
I need to go find Phu.

228
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,800
It’s not time yet.

229
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,840
Then when the hell is it?!

230
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:49,640
Let me out!
I need to go find Phu now!

231
00:23:49,800 --> 00:23:52,720
Relax. You won’t be leaving anytime soon.

232
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,000
Not until the other Cirrus
returns to his world first.

233
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,240
Just like when you... entered my body.

234
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,760
And you just left?

235
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,160
Right now, he doesn’t know me.

236
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,160
He’s got no idea who I am.

237
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,000
He doesn’t know
about our relationship.

238
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,120
I don’t even know if he’s still my P' Cir.

239
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:43,520
And he didn’t even argue
about the whole fiancée thing.

240
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,840
So what do you expect me to do?

241
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:48,480
Tell him that I'm his boyfriend?

242
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Ai Jin.

243
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,040
He’s not my P’ Cir anymore.

244
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,160
I should’ve told him.

245
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,360
I should’ve been honest...

246
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:15,360
about my feelings for him.

247
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,680
I shouldn’t have let
things turn out like this.

248
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:22,840
If I hadn't hesitated...
If I hadn't let him go back...

249
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,200
It’s alright, Phu.

250
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,240
I’m always here for you.

251
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,320
P’ Cir, where are you?

252
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,520
Why didn't you keep your promise?

253
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,120
I may not be able to change the past.

254
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,480
But from now on,
I'll always be here for you.

255
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:09,160
Phu.

256
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,080
Are you out of your mind, Ai Cir?

257
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:39,560
- I’m perfectly fine.
- Then why the fuck did you do that?

258
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:41,680
What did I do?

259
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,160
It’s that damn Lukprae.

260
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,120
How could you just
follow your mom's orders?

261
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:50,160
- That’s why I’m asking what I did.
- Are you messing with me?

262
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,840
If that's the best your brain can
come up with, then that's that.

263
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:55,520
- You!
- Hey, hey, come on.

264
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,080
Ai Cir’s just woken up.

265
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:01,080
I think his brain's a little messed up,
so he's probably a bit confused.

266
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,280
I mean, he got hit by a car, dude.

267
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,120
It’s lucky enough that he didn’t die.

268
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,240
Even if his bark got an upgrade.

269
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,160
Did you tell him you’re not his boyfriend?

270
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,080
Ai Wim.

271
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,880
Don’t you get basic human language?

272
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,960
Cir, you asshole! You’re Phu’s boyfriend.

273
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,880
It’s not just me.
Ai Rome knows too.

274
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:27,720
Your brother knows, everyone
at the university knows.

275
00:28:28,560 --> 00:28:31,840
And your mom knows too, that’s
why she sent that damn fiancée over.

276
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,760
What the fuck
is wrong with you, Ai Cir?

277
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:36,120
You seriously have memory loss?

278
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,240
You were losing your mind
over Phu just last month

279
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:42,120
but now you don’t even
care about how he feels?

280
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:44,880
Fucking jerk.

281
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:46,880
How could you do this to Phu?

282
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:49,960
My ears hurt.

283
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,480
Hey. Calm down, man.

284
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:58,040
Just act as if he’s gone bonkers
for now, like a fish out of water.

285
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,680
This ain’t fucking funny!

286
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,040
Message received.

287
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,200
What are you gonna do about Phukan?

288
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,960
That kid is just a stranger to me.

289
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,200
Ai Cir, I get that you’re
not like everyone else

290
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,920
but I never thought you’d
be this much of an asshole.

291
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:22,320
Phu almost got hit by a car because of you.

292
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,760
What happened to the guy who
wouldn’t let his mom control his life?

293
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,880
Who was it that said he’d fight for Phu?

294
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
Damn it.

295
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,560
Mark my word.

296
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,560
If you get into any more shit,
I’m not helping you anymore.

297
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:41,440
- Damn it!
- Ai Wim.

298
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:46,600
Ai Cir, I think—

299
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,120
All your friends are...

300
00:29:50,160 --> 00:29:51,840
...so ill-mannered, Cir.

301
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:58,480
And your fiancée’s rude as hell,
eavesdropping on us.

302
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:00,360
Who are you talking about?

303
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:02,120
No one. Just saying it casually.

304
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,560
Or if anyone’s bothered
by it, they can own up to it.

305
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:07,800
Cir.

306
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:12,520
Don’t you have anything
better to do with your life

307
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,080
than show up in front of me?

308
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:19,520
Well, I’m your fiancée,
so I have to take care of you.

309
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,200
When did I ask you to?

310
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,720
Cir, you shouldn’t talk to me like that.

311
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:32,840
Go ahead, feel free to tell my mom on me.

312
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:35,240
And tell her I say thanks

313
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:38,720
for choosing someone who drives me crazy.

314
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,480
If I were her, I’d have run
out of the room by now.

315
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,120
Oh, you’re still here?

316
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,240
Look, the guy doesn’t want you.

317
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,480
So why are you still here?
Aren’t you embarrassed?

318
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:51,720
Can you be quiet for a second?

319
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,120
Can’t you see we’re
trying to talk? So rude.

320
00:30:56,920 --> 00:30:57,920
Cir.

321
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:01,240
It’s because of that kid, right?

322
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,880
Just leave already.

323
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,200
No, I won’t!

324
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,880
I said leave!

325
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:14,200
- But…
- Leave.

326
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,480
Get out.

327
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,120
I knew it, dude.
It’s just like Ai Wim told me.

328
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,800
That woman was so clingy
with you when you were younger.

329
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:42,920
And she was as possessive as a mother dog.

330
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,640
She’s exactly like your mom.

331
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,760
How the hell could you want to marry her?

332
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:51,480
Ai Rome.

333
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,960
Yes, sir! What’s up?

334
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,960
Hey, don’t make that face.

335
00:31:57,640 --> 00:32:00,880
If you’ve got something
to say, don’t hold back.

336
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:04,480
Did I really get hit by a car?

337
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,720
Yeah. You got hit by
a car on December 9th.

338
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,560
Today’s the 11th.

339
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:11,600
Why’d you ask?

340
00:32:13,160 --> 00:32:14,160
Nothing.

341
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,880
Look, I don’t really wanna say much.

342
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,320
You know I’m not much of a talker.

343
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:27,400
Besides, I don’t know much
about you and Nong Phukan.

344
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:28,680
But you know what?

345
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,920
I’ve been going around
praying to all kinds of gods

346
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,440
hoping the only thing
you’ve got is amnesia.

347
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,840
Because at least that can heal
and you can get back to normal.

348
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
To be honest.

349
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,200
I liked you more when
you were with Nong Phu.

350
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:51,800
Get some rest.

351
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:06,520
Fucking bastard, you were so
obsessed with Phu, but look at you now!

352
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:09,480
If Phukan cries, I’mma
kick you in the face.

353
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:11,960
How did you get here?

354
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,600
I’m sorry on my friend’s behalf.

355
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,480
Er, how’s Phu?

356
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
Not good.

357
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,720
I... I don’t know what to say,
but I’m sorry on my friend’s behalf.

358
00:33:38,360 --> 00:33:39,800
You're angry on my friend’s behalf?

359
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:43,880
Well, yeah! Ai Cir was being a jerk
and said he doesn’t know Phukan.

360
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,400
How could I not be pissed?

361
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,840
But don’t be mad at him.

362
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,120
- This matter is—
- I know that.

363
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:56,560
This matter is too
complicated for us to handle.

364
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,720
I know, right? It’s a brain thing,
so it has to be handled by a doctor.

365
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:04,720
And Ai Cir’s already got an
attending physician handling it.

366
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,679
Thank you.

367
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,719
What are you thanking me for?

368
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,480
For siding with my friend.

369
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:33,520
Ai Wim... How... Forget about...?

370
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,120
You... Avoided... How... React?

371
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,600
What... Do... Wim?

372
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,560
- What’s on your mind?
- I just realized

373
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,159
I was avoiding you because you kissed—

374
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
Ugh, why am I telling you this?

375
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,800
Embarrassed... This... Crazy...

376
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,440
Damn... Heart... Racing...

377
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:11,200
P’ Cir.

378
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,960
Still strutting around
without a shred of guilt, I see.

379
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,280
I’m just walking my way.

380
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,360
- You’re the one who came to me.
- Shameless.

381
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:43,360
Cir’s mom told me that you
were trying to seduce him.

382
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:51,120
I don’t know where you
got those twisted ideas.

383
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,200
But get this through your thick skull.

384
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:56,520
Cir likes women.

385
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:01,880
No matter how hard you try,
he’ll never be interested in you.

386
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:03,360
Is P’ Cir interested in you?

387
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,160
What did you say?

388
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:07,040
My question is:

389
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:12,080
Since you’re a woman,
is P’ Cir interested in you?

390
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,960
Are you saying I’m nothing to him—

391
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:19,000
Since I’m insignificant,
why bother coming to see me?

392
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,400
To let you know that I’m his fiancée.

393
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,800
His future wife.

394
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,240
The one his mother has chosen for him.

395
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:31,800
He’s taken.

396
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,440
So get your lowly thing away from him.

397
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,080
Does P' Cir have any
interest in you as his fiancée?

398
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,040
- Don’t you get what I’m saying?!
- ‘Cause if he was interested in you

399
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:44,040
you wouldn’t be here bothering me.

400
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,920
You’re begging for a slap!

401
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,000
Hey!

402
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:50,800
When a man slaps
a woman, that's bullying.

403
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,760
When women slap
each other, it's fair game.

404
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,040
Wanna slap? Come at me.

405
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,280
- Let go of me!
- Bring it on!

406
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,320
Don’t you know who I am?

407
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,880
I’m not your mom.
Why should I care who you are?

408
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,400
You wanna go?!

409
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:15,360
Hey.

410
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,520
Spill it now. How the hell does
your boyfriend have a fiancée?

411
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:26,320
I can’t believe you actually escaped
from the hospital twice in a row.

412
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:29,000
I didn’t escape.

413
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,120
- The doctor said I’m fine.
- Really?

414
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,080
- Yeah.
- But you weren’t properly discharged.

415
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:36,240
If Ai Wim finds out,
you’re gonna get an earful.

416
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,600
Keep it to yourself,
don’t let him find out.

417
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,360
- Why?
- He’s a fucking pain.

418
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,520
I’m tired of his bitching too.

419
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,000
- I’ve been meaning to ask.
- What?

420
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,600
- Why the fuck are you tying your hair?
- Why the fuck are you asking?

421
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:51,760
- I can do whatever I want with my hair.
- Tee, calm down.

422
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:53,760
You promised Phu that
you wouldn’t get involved.

423
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,280
I’m not gonna kill anyone.

424
00:37:55,400 --> 00:37:57,360
Just gonna give a piece
of my mind. Don’t stop me.

425
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,840
How could you do this to Phu?

426
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:01,880
Who the hell are you?

427
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:05,520
It’s fine if you forgot me, but how
could you forget your boyfriend?

428
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:07,800
You kept saying Ai Phu
was so important to you.

429
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:10,120
When he wasn’t interested,
you kept chasing after him.

430
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,760
Now that you’ve had him,
you’re acting like a complete jerk?

431
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,640
Hey, calm down.

432
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:17,480
In case you didn’t know,
my friend got hit by a car.

433
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:19,240
His brain’s been affected.

434
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:24,160
Oh, you got hit by a car
and lost your memory.

435
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:26,440
And your brain’s stopped working too?

436
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:30,600
Hey, you’re going too far.
Did you have to insult him?

437
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,080
Glad you noticed.

438
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,760
That’s why I’m asking
if his brain’s stopped working.

439
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,720
It can’t be helped that you lost
your memory from the accident.

440
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,160
But how could you let your
fiancée slap your boyfriend?

441
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,680
At least try protecting
your boyfriend for once.

442
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,240
Even a dog has more conscience than you.

443
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:47,680
That’s enough, Tee.

444
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:50,320
Phu already said it’s not P' Cir's fault.

445
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:52,000
It’s just an excuse.

446
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:54,720
What did you mean by that earlier?

447
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,920
I meant that even a dog
is smarter than you.

448
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,200
Phukan got slapped?

449
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:06,560
No, Tee happened to pass by
and stepped in just in time.

450
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:11,040
So Phukan told us about
how you... can’t remember him.

451
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,560
- Hey! Where are you going?
- Wait, what’s the rush?

452
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:20,280
The dog’s friend wants to chat.

453
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,520
Go bark somewhere else.

454
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:25,840
You can understand dogs?
Guess that makes you a dog too.

455
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:27,840
So we’re having a barking competition now?

456
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,200
You wanna piece of me?

457
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,240
No, you’re not my type.

458
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,160
I’ll tell you what.

459
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:36,720
My sick fish in the pond is cuter than you.

460
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,800
- I’mma slap a senior today!
- Go ahead.

461
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,160
- Calm down, Tee!
- Come on, hit me. Go ahead.

00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,120
P’ Cir.

468
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,640
Are you okay?

469
00:40:32,120 --> 00:40:33,360
Why wouldn’t I be okay?

470
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,960
Your name is Phukan, right?

471
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:45,280
Phu, short for Phukan.

472
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,600
My name’s Cir, short for Cirrus.

473
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,960
Yes, I know.

474
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:55,560
How did you know?

475
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,400
No one calls me by my full nickname.

476
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,360
Your LINE display name is Cirrus.

477
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:16,720
Are we a couple?

478
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:25,640
Well, everyone says you’re my boyfriend.

479
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,960
But I don’t remember at all.

480
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:31,440
I only remember my family and my friends.

481
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,360
I can even remember stock prices.

482
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,520
But I have no memory of
Phukan or anyone around him.

483
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,280
It’s not surprising.

484
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,800
I couldn’t remember you before either.

485
00:41:57,440 --> 00:41:59,000
So how did we come to know each other?

486
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,800
I was your underclassman at your school.

487
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:11,600
And I’m also your underclassman here.

488
00:42:13,360 --> 00:42:15,000
I’m a sophomore in the Faculty of Arts.

489
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:18,400
The food at my faculty’s
cafeteria is really good.

490
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:21,160
Especially the stewed eggs.

491
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,680
Every Thursday, they sell
soft-boiled stewed eggs.

492
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,960
You’ve had them with me before.

493
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:35,440
Every morning, I like to
eat bread with green tea.

494
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:41,000
That’s why you often buy them for me.

495
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Is that all?

496
00:42:53,320 --> 00:42:55,080
Do you believe in parallel worlds, P’ Cir?

497
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,280
Do you believe in parallel worlds, Phu?

498
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:09,880
Nonsense.

499
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:18,880
Then it’s pointless.

500
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,520
It’s over. You’re not him.

501
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:34,600
I’d like to be alone, please.

502
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,400
P’ Cir.

503
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,920
I miss you so much.

504
00:44:39,360 --> 00:44:40,400
P’ Cir.

505
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,760
I wish I could turn back time.

506
00:45:16,960 --> 00:45:18,200
I love you.

507
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,880
Can you come back to me?

508
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,120
I don’t want to lose you.

509
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,160
Yay! You did it! Whoo!

510
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:13,400
It’s so cute.

511
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:21,720
I told you to smile for
the camera, not do this.

512
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:23,120
This is better.

513
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,920
From now on, I’ll be the one
playing the flute for you.

514
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:37,080
How could you do this to me, P’ Cir?

515
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:38,680
What am I gonna do now?

516
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,680
You don’t have to do anything.

517
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,120
Just let me be here.

518
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,120
Can you promise me
that you won’t go anywhere?

519
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,800
As long as you want me to stay...

520
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:54,560
I’ll be right here.

521
00:47:17,920 --> 00:47:18,920
P’ Cir.

522
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:31,440
You told me you loved me.

523
00:47:33,480 --> 00:47:35,120
But I never gave you a response.

524
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,040
I know it might be too
late to say this now.

525
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:44,920
But I’m sorry for pushing you away.

526
00:47:48,280 --> 00:47:50,320
Even though you said you
wanted to take care of me.

527
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:56,040
I finally understand my feelings.

528
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,800
I’m a selfish guy.

529
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:03,160
Whether it’s the other
Phukan or your fiancée

530
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:05,200
I don’t want to lose you to any of them.

531
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:10,800
You may not be my P' Cir anymore, but...

532
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,920
Could you give him my message?

533
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:19,160
No matter where he is...

534
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:26,000
please tell the person I love that...

535
00:48:33,360 --> 00:48:34,520
'I love you, P' Cir.'

536
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:39,840
I really love you.

537
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,600
And…

538
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,560
Goodbye.

539
00:49:40,080 --> 00:49:41,480
Where are you going, Phu?

541
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,360
Goodbye.

542
00:51:04,360 --> 00:51:05,280
Aren’t you really gonna reply to me?

543
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:08,560
What the hell’s going on?

544
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:11,680
That fucking dream felt way too real.

545
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,680
Ai Cir, where the hell are you!?

546
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:29,320
You told me you had a fever
three days ago. Three damn days!

547
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,240
I thought you were fucking dead!

548
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:34,040
Shut the hell up, will ya?
My head hurts.

549
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:36,360
But you’re the one calling me.

550
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,320
You’re fucking useless. Damn it.

551
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,280
What the— Hey! Ai Cir—

552
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,480
Oh!

553
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:16,680
P’ Cir.

554
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:28,760
You haven't left your room in
days, so I’ve been getting worried.

555
00:52:29,080 --> 00:52:30,480
Wait, no.

556
00:52:30,560 --> 00:52:32,640
I mean, I didn’t come to look for you.

557
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:34,600
I didn’t sneak by your door every day.

558
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,960
No. I mean, P’ Wim asked me to
bring you something for your fever.

559
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:45,960
I’m sorry.

560
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,040
I guess you don’t know me.

561
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:53,800
Then I’ll be on my way.

562
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:05,280
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

563
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:23,080
Phukan?

564
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:30,000
You know me, P’ Cir?

565
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,200
P’ Cir really came back.

566
00:53:44,600 --> 00:53:46,080
Did you tell him the truth?

567
00:53:46,440 --> 00:53:48,000
As someone who has seen a friend
in a one-sided love situation

568
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:49,720
for four or five years,

569
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:50,880
it's nerve-wracking.

570
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:54,120
If you could hear the voice in my head,

571
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,240
you’d know exactly what I’m thinking right now.

572
00:53:55,560 --> 00:54:00,280
And did you meet that Phukan?

573
00:54:00,680 --> 00:54:01,520
Phu.

574
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:03,440
I have something to tell you.
