1
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:24,320
What now?

2
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,160
Let’s bounce!

3
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:02,440
My car’s right there.
I’m heading home now.

4
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,400
See ya, bye-bye.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,680
Drive safe.

6
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:41,120
What happened to the patient?

7
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,120
GI trauma. Male, 22 years old.

8
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,360
He was hit by a car and
is unresponsive, GCS E1.

9
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:47,600
Sluggish pupillary response with M1 and V1.

10
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,600
Oxygen level 97, breathing is normal.

11
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,720
There's an injury on
the right side of the head.

12
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:59,039
Gosh, I’m drenched.

13
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,079
This doesn’t look like a good sign.

14
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,800
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

15
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,800
Morning krub.

16
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,680
Morning.

17
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,560
Did you enjoy watching me sleep?

18
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,159
Do I look like I enjoyed it?

19
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,600
Your smile gives you away.

20
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:46,560
What’s there to see? My hair’s
a mess and my face is all greasy.

21
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,200
Who says it’s greasy?

22
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,480
It still smells nice and feels soft.

23
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,120
Quit it. It’s already morning.

24
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,840
Can I have a few more minutes?

25
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,720
Please.

26
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,760
Stop acting cute with me.

27
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,560
Can’t I act cute with you?

28
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,520
You always can, My P’ Cir.

29
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:46,680
What was that dream?

30
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:51,200
What was it? Why can’t I remember?

31
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,600
Can you stop already? I’m awake.

32
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,600
Shit, I’m late!

33
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,440
Ow!

34
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,320
Yellow, pink, green, blue,
purple, red—they’re all here.

35
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,240
So where’s my orange baby?

36
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:12,920
Achi

37
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:20,200
Hello, Achi. I can’t find my underwear.
I’ve been looking forever.

38
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,680
What color is it this time?

39
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:24,400
Orange. It’s Thursday,
so I’ve got to wear orange.

40
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,960
Thu

41
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:29,760
Ai Phu, any color’s the same.
Just get here fast.

42
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,520
Ai Phu can’t find his
underwear again. He’s so whiny.

43
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,600
I’m not whiny.

44
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:37,680
You’re only a notch less
whiny than a newborn.

45
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:39,560
Hey, Ai Jin.

46
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Hello, Ai Phu.

47
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,320
Jin, I can’t find my orange baby.

48
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:44,200
I know that.

49
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,520
What do I do?

50
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,520
If I wear the wrong color,
something’s bad gonna happen.

51
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,960
You know I have to wear
the lucky color of the day.

52
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,240
If I don’t, bad things always happen.

53
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:56,880
Yeah, I know.

54
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:58,560
But you need to get moving now.

55
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,440
The prof just told us there’s a quiz.

56
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,480
What!?

57
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:05,920
Wait, when did the prof say that?
Didn’t she just walk in?

58
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:07,800
Just keep listening.

59
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,120
The prof is gonna quiz us on last
week’s class. Starts in 15 minutes.

60
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:15,200
Latecomers will fail right away.

61
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,560
Shit!

62
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,640
Jin, how did you know
we’re having a quiz today?

63
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,040
Yeah. How?

64
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,200
I haven’t skipped this class at all.

65
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,159
And I'm sure I didn’t fell asleep either.

66
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,320
Alright, class, let’s have a quiz today.

67
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:47,360
If your friends haven’t
arrived, you can call them.

68
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,720
I’ll give you 15 minutes,
then we’ll start the quiz.

69
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,680
Anyone who’s late or doesn’t
finish on time will fail, okay?

70
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,720
The prof told me the other day.

71
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,520
Asshole. Why didn’t you tell us?

72
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,240
I haven’t cracked open a book.

73
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:14,440
The day's barely started,
and I’m already screwed.

74
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Here. How much is it?

75
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,760
60 baht.

76
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:46,040
Hey, isn't it usually only 40 baht?

77
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,280
Come on, you hailed me
in the middle of the road.

78
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,600
Gotta charge extra for the risk.

79
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,720
That’s because my broke down.

80
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:54,200
So? Are you gonna pay or what?

81
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,720
Huh?

82
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,640
Where’s my wallet?

83
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,680
Bro, are you trying to cheat me?

84
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,560
No, my wallet’s really missing.

85
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,920
Can I scan to pay?

86
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:12,840
Sure.

87
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:18,440
Did you know someone was hit
by a car in front of our building?

88
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,800
In front of our building?

89
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,120
Yeah, that’s right.

90
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,640
- Is he dead?
- Hey, don’t say such an unlucky thing.

91
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,800
But he’s in a coma.

92
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:29,360
I heard he fought off some car
thieves until they fled for their lives.

93
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:35,600
The thieves must’ve been
pissed off, so they ran him over.

94
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,000
Thankfully, he’s okay, just
hasn’t woken up for three days.

95
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,200
Who is he?

96
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,560
It’s P’ Cir.

97
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,160
- Really?
- Yeah.

98
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,880
Hey, bro.

99
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:47,920
Are you gonna snoop or pay?

100
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,560
Pay. I’m paying.

101
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:53,880
Done.

102
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,520
Someone was hit by
a car in front of our building.

103
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:03,960
- Who is he?
- It’s P’ Cir.

104
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,880
Forget it, it’s got nothing to do with me.

105
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,000
I'd probably starve to death without you.

106
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:47,920
You’re exaggerating.

107
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:50,320
Don’t you believe me?

108
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,840
You managed just fine
for so long without me.

109
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,000
Now that I have you,
I just can’t live without you.

110
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,600
Back in high school, you’d
hesitate even just to hold my hand.

111
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,520
Hey.

112
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,040
Come on, don’t worry about him.

113
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,040
He’s got an IV drip. He’s not gonna die.

114
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,840
Your friend isn’t a fish.

115
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,840
You think it’s funny, expecting
him to get better from salt water?

116
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,840
I wasn’t trying to be funny.

117
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:53,400
Besides, if a fish is sick,
just adding salt doesn’t cut it.

118
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,440
You need to figure out
what’s wrong, how to treat it

119
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,920
what medicine to use,
what kind of water it needs.

120
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,440
- And sometimes…
- Stop, stop, stop.

121
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,840
Do you really think Ai Cir’s fine?

122
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,480
The doctor said he’s
safe now, but look at him.

123
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,720
Safe my ass, he hasn’t
woken up in three days.

124
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,560
If he’s really fine,
why hasn’t he come to yet?

125
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,560
I believe he’s gonna be fine.

126
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,240
But I’m afraid of one thing.

127
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:26,480
What is it?

128
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,800
I’m just… afraid he might
not want to live anymore.

129
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,240
I can't take it anymore. So exhausted.

130
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:56,840
Jeez, you brought this on yourself.

131
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:59,520
If you hadn’t wasted time
looking for a good luck charm

132
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:02,520
you wouldn’t have had to rush and
almost missed the quiz, you know.

133
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,760
You don’t understand me, Achi.

134
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,960
Because I couldn’t find my good luck charm

135
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,480
the prof suddenly
announced there’d be a quiz.

136
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,360
Because I couldn’t find my good luck charm

137
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,680
I couldn’t do the quiz.

138
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:14,080
And because I couldn’t
find my good luck charm

139
00:13:14,120 --> 00:13:15,800
my car broke down at the intersection.

140
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,080
And because of the good luck charm

141
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:19,320
I also missed out on
my favorite stewed egg.

142
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,640
Nothing's been going right today.

143
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:26,080
Honestly, it might not have anything
to do with the good luck charm.

144
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,320
Ai Achi didn't have one
and still couldn't do the quiz.

145
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,560
Keep it down, you idiot.

146
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,440
Cut the act already.

147
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,600
How long are you gonna keep up
the ‘Mr. Achi’s perfect prince’ image?

148
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,400
Nobody’s into that prince thing anymore.

149
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,360
It's so out now.

150
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,880
Aww, Tee told me you’re
having bad luck today?

151
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:54,000
It’s okay.

152
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,880
Nalin, I’m definitely gonna
be unlucky all day today.

153
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:59,280
Ai Phu, can you just stop?
You've been whining since morning.

154
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,520
Jeez.

155
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:01,960
Ouch!

156
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,920
Fuck! That hurts!

157
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,120
That’s the point.

158
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,000
Stop making things worse for Phu.

159
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,200
Can’t you see Phu’s
already down in the dumps?

160
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,360
Jeez, you only feel sorry for Phu.

161
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,560
But when it comes to me,
you just gotta smack me silly?

162
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,040
I’m gonna hit you back someday.

163
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:19,400
Whoa, now you're tough enough
to challenge a girl to a fight?

164
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,640
You’re a girl? I had no idea.

165
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,600
Ai Chi.

166
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,520
- You wanna fight?
- Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

167
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,200
Bring it on. Bring it on. Bring it on.

168
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,120
- I’ll fight back.
- That’s enough, Tee.

169
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:34,280
But isn't it weird? Phu's usually lucky.

170
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,240
Yeah, you’re right.

171
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,000
His so-called ‘guardian angel’ crap.

172
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,800
Just stop piling on him already.

173
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,040
See what she did?

174
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,960
Maybe Phu's guardian
angel is really sick today.

175
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,640
If my angel’s really sick,
I hope they get better soon.

176
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,320
I can’t take much more of this.

177
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,280
We’re in October now.
The rainy season’s over.

178
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:30,040
How is it still raining? I'm soaked!

179
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:33,200
What a mess.

180
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:36,440
What the hell?

181
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,080
Seriously? It’s all your fault
for making me this unlucky.

182
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,680
I was just kidding earlier.

183
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,080
If you’re really sick,
I hope you get well soon.

184
00:16:11,640 --> 00:16:15,840
Don’t stress about protecting me,
just as long as you're okay.

185
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,560
Do you know what I found?

186
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:48,920
Ta-da!

187
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,360
How nostalgic.

188
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:01,360
Have you ever thought about what would’ve
happened if you hadn’t answered me that day

189
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,240
or if there was a world where
we didn’t know each other?

190
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:11,520
If that world didn’t have you…

191
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,160
I don’t think...

192
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,359
I could go on.

193
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:24,720
Me too.

194
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,960
That’s why you need to promise me that...

195
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:13,760
Phu.

196
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,760
Hey. Who’s that?

197
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,600
I thought I’d never see you again.

198
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:49,640
Umm, please dry yourself off first.

199
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:50,920
Phu.

200
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,200
Yes?

201
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:52,960
Phukan.

202
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,240
Yes?

203
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:58,160
Please sit down first.

204
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:12,960
Are you… alright?

205
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:19,160
I mean, did something happen to you?

206
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,640
It’s nothing.

207
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:34,880
Phu…

208
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:38,280
Do you know me?

209
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:42,840
Of course.

210
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,920
You were my senior in school and
the vice president of the student council.

211
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:52,400
I don’t really follow popular people

212
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:55,560
but I know you because
you were super famous.

213
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:56,960
And we’re at the same uni.

214
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,080
Is that all?

215
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,880
Is that so? So that’s how it is.

216
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,520
Guess that’s all you know about me.

217
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,000
Are… Are you crying?

218
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
P’…

219
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:40,920
P’ Cir.

220
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:45,960
Would you believe me
if I told you we were a couple?

221
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,360
Huh? What? I didn’t catch that.

222
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:52,320
You’re saying we’re…

223
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:53,160
…a couple.

224
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,960
No way. You’re messing with me.

225
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,520
Why would you say we’re a couple?

226
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,120
Because we are.

227
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,040
Are you crazy?

228
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Who told you to mess with me?
This isn’t funny.

229
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,000
Phu.

230
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,520
Do I look like I’m joking?

231
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,640
Do you believe in parallel worlds?

232
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,200
No.

233
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:42,000
But I do.

234
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:48,280
I’ve told you, I don’t believe in them.

235
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:53,440
I never did either, until today.

236
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:02,000
Hey, don’t tell me you’re saying
we’re a couple in some parallel world?

237
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:12,840
Please stop pulling my leg.
Who sent you to prank me?

238
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:30,720
Hello.

239
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:34,840
Okay, I’m going back.

240
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:43,480
Hold on, we’re not done talking yet.

241
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,880
What do you mean?

242
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,720
You still don’t believe me,
and I don’t want to scare you.

243
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,960
By the way, you usually keep
your wallet in your back pocket.

244
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,200
If you can’t find it, try looking there.

245
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,040
It’s raining tonight.

246
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:10,600
Take your medicine before
bed, or you might catch a cold.

247
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,440
What the hell has just happened?

248
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:45,040
No way, this must be some kind of joke.

249
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,200
But how did he know?

250
00:25:38,040 --> 00:25:39,200
You’re back, P’ Cir?

251
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,120
Which one is reality?

252
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,840
Which one is a dream?

253
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:38,360
I don’t know anymore, Phu.

254
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:42,600
What am I supposed to do?

255
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,240
Enough. Stop thinking. No more.

256
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:23,640
I won’t mess up today.

257
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,560
- Ai Jin.
- I don’t know.

258
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:02,720
I haven’t asked yet.

259
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,480
I just wanted to say
that I don’t know either.

260
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:07,240
I also don't know what's in your bag.

261
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,320
I don’t know when you bought it.

262
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,200
And I don’t know if you’ve lost anything.

263
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,200
I just wanted to say that I don’t know.

264
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:21,720
It’s your favorite.

265
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,280
Right? Everyone knows that.

266
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:27,960
Even seniors I've never talked to
before know that I like this bread.

267
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,720
Look, the sky's beautiful today.

268
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:34,160
Who do you think bought this for me?

269
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,920
How would I know?

270
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,520
Well, you usually know everything.

271
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,840
You’re asking something
you already know, Phu?

272
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:48,480
I’m telling you, the sky’s beautiful today.

273
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,560
Maybe something good will happen to you.

274
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,400
Jin, I can’t find my phone.

275
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,200
Again?

276
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:11,040
Isn't something good
supposed to happen to me?

277
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:13,320
Where is it?

278
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,080
Guys, this is totally unfair.

279
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:16,600
What are you on about?

280
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:17,960
Look over there.

281
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:36,920
That handsome senior
from business just popped up

282
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,360
and is acting all cool out of nowhere.

283
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:41,040
Girls have walked past
at least ten times already.

284
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,200
Look.

285
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:44,840
Even touched up their faces.

286
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:47,120
Jealous of him?

287
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,680
Hey, I’m not jealous. I’m
way more handsome than him.

288
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,320
Ai Phu, what do you think?
I'm the campus prince, you know.

289
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:57,000
What's wrong?
Hiding from debt collectors?

290
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,520
Sawasdee krub, we meet again.

291
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:11,840
What’s this?

292
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,280
I couldn’t find your favorite
green tea this morning

293
00:30:18,680 --> 00:30:20,120
so I stopped by to bring it to you.

294
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,400
How did you know I like this brand?

295
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,840
And this bread too?

296
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,080
Can’t find your phone?

297
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,120
How did you know?

298
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:42,960
You always forget it.

299
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:46,600
If you can't find it,
try checking your bag.

300
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,160
I'm going now.

301
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:04,720
Jin, how did he know?

302
00:31:04,800 --> 00:31:06,560
I knew it. You’re a traitor.

303
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,080
You think he's hotter than me, right?

304
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:09,440
When did you get close to him?

305
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,480
I didn’t.

306
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:13,360
Didn’t what? It’s so obvious.
He even bought you stuff.

307
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,800
You traitor.

308
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:17,120
I told you something
good would to happen.

309
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:19,360
Wait, what do you mean?

310
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:26,280
Don’t forget to eat the bread.
Huh?

311
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:31,000
It’s fine if you don’t know
me now, I’m not stopping here.

312
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:33,480
Brace yourself.

313
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:34,480
Hey!

314
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,680
How did he get my Line?

315
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,200
Isn’t that great?

316
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:07,880
Ai Cir, how could you do that?

317
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,720
What did I do?

318
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:12,520
You escaped from the hospital.

319
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,360
You literally ran out of the hospital.

320
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,560
Fuck, Cir, this is no joke!

321
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:18,640
Everyone’s been looking everywhere for you.

322
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:25,200
And… And all you could say was
'What did I do?' with a straight face?

323
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,040
This isn’t a joke, Ai Cir.

324
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,560
You were unconscious for three days.

325
00:32:28,560 --> 00:32:32,200
And when you woke up, you
started babbling nonsense about…

326
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:37,960
how you’re dating Nong Phukan.

327
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,560
But it’s true.

328
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:43,120
Ai Cir, don’t be crazy!

329
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,720
You’ve been going on about dating
Nong Phukan since you woke up

330
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:49,680
but you’ve never even spoken to him!

331
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,160
I’m telling the truth.

332
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,400
Ai Cir, I’m your friend.

333
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,520
- Even if I know that you and—
- What’s up!

334
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:08,240
I heard you ran out of the hospital.
Man, you’re so damn cool.

335
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:10,560
Ai Rome, what’s fucking cool about it?

336
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,080
Ai Cir, I’m not done yet.

337
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:14,280
Hey, hold on.

338
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:17,760
Why so serious?
Life’s meant to be chill, dude.

339
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,400
The stress is gonna give you wrinkles.

340
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:23,520
You look older than us now.
Are you my senior?

341
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,440
I’m in your year.
Fuck you, Ai Rome.

342
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:27,920
Hold on.

343
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,760
How come I heard you
have a boyfriend now?

344
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:33,880
I’ve been your friend for four years,
when did you secretly get one?

345
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,960
Phu and I have been
a couple since high school.

346
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:44,280
Ai Cir, go to the hospital.
I’m begging you.

347
00:33:44,280 --> 00:33:45,320
I’m not crazy.

348
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,920
- Just go.
- I’m not crazy!

349
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
It’s okay if he doesn’t want to.
I know my friend’s not crazy.

350
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,200
Right? Are you crazy?

351
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:02,320
- Ai Rome, just shut the fuck up.
- Hold on a sec.

352
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:07,360
Take a good look at your
buddy’s body and face. Look.

353
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,480
He’s basically an angel reincarnate.
Who wouldn’t like him?

354
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:13,440
If he likes someone,
he can totally get them.

355
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,480
It’s like the law of nature.
As Charles Dickens said…

356
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,320
It’s Charles Darwin!

357
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,239
Yeah, whatever.

358
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:25,120
He said, ‘The strongest
of the species survives.’

359
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:29,560
Jeez, it’s actually ‘The one that’s
the most adaptable to change survives.’

360
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,679
Just shut up if you don't know.

361
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:33,760
- Really?
- Yeah.

362
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:37,360
Ai Cir, what are you gonna do?

363
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:41,280
If he doesn’t know me here...

364
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
I’ll start over.

365
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,480
So what’s up with you and P’ Cir?

366
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:03,160
Nothing. It’s nothing.

367
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,120
Like I’d believe you.

368
00:35:08,120 --> 00:35:12,360
Ai Jin, if someone suddenly
told you he’s from a parallel world

369
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,400
would you believe him?

370
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,560
New series plot?

371
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,200
Oh come on! I’m serious.

372
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:20,200
So what happened next?

373
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,760
And he knew everything

374
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,960
from the room I live in
to what I eat for breakfast.

375
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,760
He even knew exactly where I left things

376
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:28,400
when I didn’t even know where they were.

377
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:31,040
But I’ve never really
crossed paths with him before.

378
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:33,920
I only know he was a senior from my school

379
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,600
and now we’re in different faculties.

380
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,320
But I’ve never even met him before.

381
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
What’s so funny?

382
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:45,120
You've never met him,
or you just didn't notice?

383
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,280
What do you mean?

384
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:51,080
Let’s go, we’re late.

385
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,240
Wait, what do you mean I didn’t notice?

386
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,280
Try paying attention from now on.

387
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,640
Come on, let’s go.

388
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:00,400
- Ai Phu.
- Ai Jin, what do you mean?

389
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:01,480
Hurry up.

390
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,840
What do you mean, I didn’t notice?

391
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,960
Here’s your green curry.

392
00:36:06,200 --> 00:36:10,560
That Jin, he’s always like this.
Gets me all frustrated and just leaves.

393
00:36:11,960 --> 00:36:13,880
Maybe stewed eggs will help me feel better.

394
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:21,080
How strange, you both
showed up together today.

395
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,080
You guys always eat the same food

396
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,720
but there’s only one stewed egg left.

397
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:29,560
You can give it to him.

398
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,080
Yeah, I know. I just forgot
that the prof switched rooms.

399
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,080
I’m at the tram stop now.

400
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:50,000
I'm gonna be late. Just
remembered I forgot something.

401
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:09,360
Or maybe it’s just like Jin said?
I just never noticed before.

402
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:32,000
You and me, being a couple?

403
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:55,720
Oh!

404
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:12,720
Morning krub, Phu.

405
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:21,760
Phu!

406
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:26,360
Phu, wait for me.

407
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:30,000
Phu.

408
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:33,760
Wait, Phu. Did I do something to upset you?

409
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:35,800
No.

410
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,160
Then why did you run away?

411
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,240
Well, I was startled.

412
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
By what?

413
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,600
You said it like it’s something
you’ve said a thousand times.

414
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:52,640
And we keep running into each other, but...

415
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,280
I’ve just known you for a few days.

416
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,200
I’m sorry.

417
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,920
Why are you apologizing?

418
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,840
To me, you’re more than
just some random person.

419
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:16,160
But for you…

420
00:39:24,080 --> 00:39:25,080
So...

421
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,920
Shall we start over?

422
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:33,800
Sorry?

423
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:40,280
I don’t want to make you
scared or uncomfortable.

424
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:44,800
But I can’t just let
things go on like this.

425
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,120
It’s okay if you don’t believe me now

426
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:52,640
since I’m just a stranger to you.

427
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,800
Can I ask you for something?

428
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:03,040
What is it?

429
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,120
I'm going to ask you out.

430
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,640
I'm going to be your boyfriend.

431
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:30,400
Please let me make a move on you.

432
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:43,080
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

433
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,680
Ai Cir, what the hell are you doing?

434
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:16,440
Where’s Phukan?

435
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,320
What are you talking about?

436
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,240
Do you realize how many
days you were out cold?

437
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:24,200
I was worried sick.
I thought you were gonna die.

438
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:28,480
Ai Wim, what about Phu?
Where’s Phukan?

439
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,280
What are you talking about?

440
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:32,520
Just lie down.
I’ll go get the doctor.

441
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,680
Phu.

442
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,320
Phukan, my boyfriend.

443
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,000
Listen to me, Ai Cir.

444
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,240
You got hit by a car.

445
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,280
You’re confused right now.

446
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:53,200
I’ve known you my whole life,
and you don’t have a boyfriend.

447
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,600
You’ve never had one, remember?

448
00:41:56,960 --> 00:41:57,880
Phu…

449
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:00,920
Where’s Phukan?

450
00:42:07,160 --> 00:42:09,280
You'd better lie down.
I’ll go get the doctor.

451
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,320
I’m asking where Phukan is!

452
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,520
I don’t know.

453
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,800
I’ll go get the doctor.

A guy like P’ Cir likes me?

466
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,680
How could I have a chance to run into him?

467
00:43:56,720 --> 00:43:59,000
So how do you explain his actions?

468
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,880
I think P' Cir likes you.

469
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:03,080
How did we get to know each other?

470
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,640
We've never even talked to
or met each other in this world.

471
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,440
You don’t make me feel like
you’re someone else at all.

472
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:11,440
I’m glad you let us get to know each other.

473
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:16,440
I’ve made up my mind.
I’ll help P’ Cir return to that world.
