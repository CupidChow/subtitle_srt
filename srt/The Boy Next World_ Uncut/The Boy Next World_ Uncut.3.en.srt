1
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:12,270
How did we get to know each other

2
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,100
when we never even talked to
or met each other in this world?

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,750
Knock, knock, knock.

4
00:00:17,060 --> 00:00:18,060
Who’s there?

5
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,120
You might not know me in this world.

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,760
I'm not your boyfriend or your lover.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,550
But… can I just stay close to you?

8
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,890
You should tell him the truth.

9
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:30,990
I’ve made up my mind.

10
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:35,520
I’m gonna help P’ Cir return to that world.

11
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,230
Phu, are you alright?
Did you get hurt?

12
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:55,220
No, I’m fine.

13
00:00:55,370 --> 00:00:57,430
Wait, where are you touching me?

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,940
You sure you’re okay?

15
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,460
I think you’re way more
shaken up than I am.

16
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:08,320
I'm fine, really.

17
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:15,700
Come on, let’s find a place
to sit and calm down a bit.

18
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,789
Stress will ruin your good looks.

19
00:01:43,789 --> 00:01:46,880
I don’t care.
But are you really okay?

20
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,740
If your fans heard that, they’d probably…

21
00:01:52,370 --> 00:01:56,580
kill me for stressing you out.

22
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:01,380
I don’t care about anyone else.
I only care about you.

23
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,400
I’m really fine.

24
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:14,970
I’m not used to this.

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,540
Used to what?

26
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,970
Well, it’s been a long time since
someone cared about me like this.

27
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,480
Ever since my dad passed away,
my mom’s moved to Australia.

28
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:34,240
But that doesn’t mean
she doesn’t care about me.

29
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,220
It’s just that she loved my dad so much

30
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:41,450
she couldn’t bear to live in
the place filled with his memories.

31
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,660
So, all we can do is call each other.

32
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,170
As for me…

33
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:53,970
You chose to stay in the place
filled with your dad’s memories.

34
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,290
How did you...

35
00:02:58,329 --> 00:03:01,520
Of course you knew. You’re
Phukan’s boyfriend in another world.

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,060
Oh!

37
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,120
Phu, what’s wrong?
Are you hurt anywhere?

38
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:10,330
P’ Cir, I just remembered
why I came to see you today.

39
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,050
I have something to tell you.

40
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,270
What I want to say is that

41
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,579
I'll find a way to send
you back to your world

42
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:25,010
so you can be with
the Phukan you belong to.

43
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:55,430
Don’t forget our plans, P’ Cir.

44
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:52,600

Let’s go, P’ Cir. I’ve done some
research. They're the real deal.

58
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:44,460
I see it.

59
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:45,909
See what, Medium?

60
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:58,580
You’re destined to be an
homme fatal, a woman destroyer.

61
00:07:58,690 --> 00:08:01,650
Any woman who gets
involved with you is doomed.

62
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:07,240
The spirits of old widows are wailing.

63
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:12,120
They’re following you,
holding grudges against you.

64
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,040
They want to take you with them.

65
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,040
Oh, there are so many of them.

66
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:20,670
So what should we do?

67
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,470
There’s only one way.

68
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:23,490
What is it?

69
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,960
Come live with me for a month, handsome.

70
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:31,200
And I’ll drive every last one of them away.

71
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,740
Come back! Come back!

72
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,250
Please come back to me, handsome.

73
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:43,080
You betrayed your country.

74
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,500
You killed your fellow countrymen.

75
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,390
You committed treason against your nation.

76
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:58,130
Ungrateful scum!

77
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:05,330
You deserve to die!

78
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:07,620
- Let’go, P’ Cir.
- Let me go!

79
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,540
- Let me go! Let go!
- Stop, Master!

80
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:31,120
P’ Cir, I’m sorry.

81
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,940
I’ve really checked that all those
places are very sacred and credible.

82
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,830
I swear.

83
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,410
And now I’m a traitor
and a woman destroyer

84
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,990
to the point where I need to be purified?

85
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,380
Everyone says they’re credible.

86
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,410
Who is this ‘everyone’?

87
00:09:54,140 --> 00:09:56,740
Well... people on the internet.

88
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:09,230
Ugh.

89
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,950
Ai Phu, you shouldn’t have
believed those people online.

90
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:18,940
And I even ordered a rosary
from that old witch last month.

91
00:10:18,970 --> 00:10:21,570
Didn’t they say believing in
superstition would make life better?

92
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:24,760
If Mama finds out I spent
my allowance on that rosary

93
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:26,690
she's definitely gonna hit me.

94
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,290
Drink some water first.

95
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,220
I’m really sorry, P’ Cir.

96
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,210
It’s okay.

97
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:49,690
Does it hurt a lot?

98
00:10:50,410 --> 00:10:53,920
I thought that holy water sprinkler
was going to crack your head open.

99
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,740
It’s no big deal.

100
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,930
I’m truly sorry.

101
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,260
As long as I get to spend
time with you, that's enough.

102
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,590
It’s okay, P’ Cir.

103
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:25,670
I messed up this time,
but next time, I won’t.

104
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,470
Oh, what about your water?

105
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:44,230
The shop only had one cold bottle left.

106
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:46,240
The others aren’t chilled yet.

107
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,480
You can drink it.

108
00:11:49,190 --> 00:11:50,190
What about you?

109
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,130
I already drank. We can share, okay?

110
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,990
Is it true that Cir’s
dating an Arts student?!

111
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,030
This is unacceptable, P’ Wim.

112
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:26,310
He’s supposed to be
cool, hot, and unattached.

113
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,490
You better tell us now!

114
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:30,000
I heard they were holding
hands while crossing the street.

115
00:12:30,170 --> 00:12:31,510
And that person was a guy too!

116
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,630
- I won’t accept it.
- Me neither.

117
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:35,730
- Definitely won’t.
- - I won’t! I won’t! I won’t!

118
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,610
Jeez, and what’s that got to do with me?

119
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,850
You should know best since you’re his dad.

120
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,660
I’m not his dad.
Don’t curse me like that.

121
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,770
I’m taking care of him 'cause
I promised his real dad, okay?

122
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:51,850
Tell us right now, is Ai Cir
really dating a sophomore?

123
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,600
Didn't you say he’d never hit on anyone?!

124
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:56,140
I don’t know, so get your
hands off my face already.

125
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,560
Not a chance. If you don’t
know, then go find out!

126
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,600
Do it yourself.

127
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,250
I wouldn’t dare.

128
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:06,490
Can’t you see the look in his eyes?

129
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,950
I start shaking whenever he looks my way.

130
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,680
If you’re already freaked out by his stare

131
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,460
don’t even dream about being his wife.

132
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,730
I’m off.

133
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:19,900
Remember to find out, alright?
We’re all curious.

134
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,730
Damn it, it’s always me every time.

135
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,120
Didn't you say you’d
never date anyone, Ai Cir?

136
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:38,980
Two Years Ago

137
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:44,090
Hey Ai Cir, how come you’re still single?

138
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,510
Well?

139
00:13:47,380 --> 00:13:49,860
Someone asked me to ask him.
How come?

140
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,080
Just leave him alone.

141
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:56,180
I don’t want any kind of relationship.

142
00:13:57,170 --> 00:13:58,700
You know how my family is.

143
00:13:58,940 --> 00:14:00,230
I do, but…

144
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:04,580
Aren’t humans are supposed to… copulate?

145
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,380
Ai Rome! What the fuck are you saying?

146
00:14:09,210 --> 00:14:10,210
I’m not human.

147
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,500
I’m a robot.

148
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,020
A machine bound by commands.

149
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:26,160
It’s because he’s pent-up.
If he ever gets to try...

150
00:14:28,210 --> 00:14:29,210
Trust me.

151
00:14:30,010 --> 00:14:31,020
Well?

152
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,650
Here goes.

153
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,900
Excuse me, are you Phukan’s friend?

154
00:14:53,050 --> 00:14:55,470
You see, I’m a senior
from Phukan’s old school.

155
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,810
I want to talk to him,
but I don’t have his contact.

156
00:14:59,010 --> 00:15:01,030
Do you have his number? Can I have it?

157
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,030
It’s pretty cloudy today.

158
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,380
Judging by the clouds,
it should rain today.

159
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,380
It will rain tomorrow.

160
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,790
Hey, you can predict the weather?

161
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:26,710
How do you do it? From
the clouds? Or the sky? Or what?

162
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,830
The clouds look beautiful today.

163
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,440
You’re right. They look like a lion.

164
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:37,570
Hey, that’s a lion.
And there’s a cliff.

165
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:39,750
Just like the Lion King.

166
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,230
What the heck did I just do?

167
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:02,010
It’s fine if you don’t want to give
me his number. I'll ask someone else.

168
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,970
A tiger.

169
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:09,870
What was that?

170
00:16:10,510 --> 00:16:13,650
Without a mane, it must be a tiger.

171
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,770
Without a mane, it must be a lioness.

172
00:16:26,630 --> 00:16:27,650
It has stripes.

173
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,330
Shit, it really has stripes. You’re right.

174
00:16:38,190 --> 00:16:40,720
Why are you laughing?
You started this game.

175
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,500
Nothing.

176
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:44,890
A lioness, it is.

177
00:16:45,790 --> 00:16:46,790
I gotta go.

178
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,070
Hey, hold on.

179
00:16:50,220 --> 00:16:52,380
What about what I asked?
We're not done yet.

180
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:57,070
Hey Phu, over here!

181
00:16:58,360 --> 00:17:00,440
Hey! We’re not done yet. Get back here!

182
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,710
See you later, P’ Lion.

183
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:07,130
Oh, and don’t worry too
much about other people.

184
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:12,460
Hey, my name’s Wim from
Wimbledon. Ever heard of it?

185
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:13,680
It’s not Lion.

186
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,050
And what’s that supposed to mean?

187
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,470
You need something from Ai Jin, P’ Wim?

188
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:23,290
Why are there so many
weirdos around us, Phu?

189
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:47,400
P’ Cir. P’ Cir.
P’ Wim came to see me today.

190
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:55,700
Don’t talk to him.

191
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,590
But he’s worried about you.

192
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:03,050
I don’t care.

193
00:18:04,830 --> 00:18:08,840
How could you say that?
He’s your friend.

194
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,960
No reply?

195
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:34,800
I’m jealous.

196
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:43,540
Why is he even jealous?
There was nothing going on.

197
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:50,170
Phu, Ai Cir didn’t do
anything to you, right?

198
00:18:50,330 --> 00:18:52,650
He didn’t scare you
or threaten you, did he?

199
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,570
I heard that he held your hand.

200
00:18:55,470 --> 00:18:56,750
Did he yank your arm?

201
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,680
If he did something bad to you,
I apologize on his behalf.

202
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,190
I don’t know what’s gotten
into him after he left the hospital.

203
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,540
I told him to see a doctor,
but he wouldn’t go.

204
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,120
He didn’t even listen to
his dad or little brother.

205
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,150
Hold on, P’ Wim.

206
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,440
P’ Cir didn’t do anything to me.

207
00:19:12,070 --> 00:19:14,870
You don’t have to hold back.
I know what he’s like.

208
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,710
I’m serious. He didn’t
do anything to scare me.

209
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,120
Really?

210
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,630
What a relief.

211
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,300
The thing is, I just don’t want to
bail him out at the police station.

212
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,540
Phu.

213
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:41,400
Ai Cir didn’t…

214
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,460
He didn’t say...

215
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:46,890
He didn’t say anything crazy like…

216
00:19:48,110 --> 00:19:50,110
Being my boyfriend in a parallel world?

217
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:53,730
I knew it! He should’ve
stayed in the hospital longer.

218
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,460
You think he’s crazy, don’t you?

219
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,500
No, I don’t think he’s crazy.

220
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:06,170
Don’t tell me you’re
actually secretly dating.

221
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,620
No, I’m not dating P’ Cir.

222
00:20:09,230 --> 00:20:10,300
You sure?

223
00:20:10,490 --> 00:20:12,670
Yes, I’m really not dating him.

224
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,780
Wait, are you jealous?

225
00:20:14,870 --> 00:20:16,680
Jeez, I’d rather get struck by lightning.

226
00:20:16,710 --> 00:20:20,190
Or better yet, I’d rather run
there and get hit by a car.

227
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:25,010
What did I do to make you think
I’d tie a burden around my neck?

228
00:20:25,290 --> 00:20:28,610
Well… you seem so concerned about P’ Cir.

229
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,670
No, I’m not! It’s just become
my responsibility now.

230
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:33,390
If you’d grown up with Ai Cir

231
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:36,780
you’d know he’s not some
goddamned handsome ice prince.

232
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,020
When we were kids, he’d
always make other kids cry.

233
00:20:39,050 --> 00:20:40,390
And I got dragged into it too.

234
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,720
As we got older, he
started breaking girls' hearts.

235
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,440
When he ignored the teachers,
guess who got scolded?

236
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,380
Me! It was me who got the blame.

237
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:51,230
I couldn’t escape because I
ended up in the same faculty as him.

238
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:54,820
I don’t know why, but everyone
thinks I’m the only who can talk to him.

239
00:20:55,030 --> 00:20:56,510
So now everything falls on me.

240
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:01,410
If it weren't for his dad,
I would’ve ditched him ages ago.

241
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,220
Ugh, so exhausting.
I can’t even cut ties with him.

242
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:15,160
Sorry, Phu.

243
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:19,230
We haven’t spoken in ages,
and here I am, ranting.

244
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:20,490
I’m sorry.

245
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,460
It’s fine, but…

246
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:27,800
P’ Cir’s not as bad as
you’re making him sound.

247
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,590
You’re cool with him, right?

248
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,030
That’s good, really good.

249
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,110
Phu, I know we haven’t
really talked since high school.

250
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,160
But I’m leaving Ai Cir to you.

251
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:45,030
Uh, it’d be even better
if you guys start dating.

252
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,930
He’s all yours. No take-backs.

253
00:21:49,770 --> 00:21:50,770
P’ Wim, wait!

254
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,100
Oh, and come see me at
the student union tomorrow.

255
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,770
Why?

256
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,320
To punish you for thinking that I like him.

257
00:21:59,550 --> 00:22:01,750
Ugh, hell no! I’m leaving.

258
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,080
P’ Wim, wait!

259
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:07,250
Finally! I don’t have to
deal with Ai Cir anymore.

260
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:14,140
Why are you jealous?
We're not a couple.

261
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:18,510
P’ Wim just wanted free labor,
just like back in high school.

262
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:39,510
P’ Cir, meet me on the balcony.

263
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,610
Knock, knock, knock.

264
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:23,060
A signal from Earth.

265
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:29,730
It’s dangerous, Phu.
Don’t stick your head out.

266
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:35,520
I wasn't sure if you were
saying anything or not.

267
00:23:36,310 --> 00:23:38,570
And I didn’t know if
you were listening to me.

268
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,230
Wanna talk on Line?

269
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:44,530
It’s not as fun.

270
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,910
This is better, I can
hear your voice this way.

271
00:24:01,580 --> 00:24:04,560
P' Wim told me to help
at the student union tomorrow.

272
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:11,010
If you don’t want to go,
just let me know, and I’ll tell him.

273
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:16,350
This is why everyone
says you’re intimidating.

274
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,130
Do you think that too?

275
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:28,100
No, you’re not intimidating at all.

276
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:33,340
Everyone’s just talking nonsense.
You’re actually really kind.

277
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:38,530
Because it’s you.

278
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,630
I don’t want to scare you or
make you run away from me.

279
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:46,080
Besides…

280
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:52,150
You make me smile when I’m with you.

281
00:24:57,910 --> 00:24:59,790
You’ve been making
me smile for a long time.

282
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,940
Oh.

283
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:08,760
Really?

284
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:13,770
Are you trying to please
me with those words?

285
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,140
What kind of reward do you want?

286
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:46,520
Sleepy yet?

287
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:50,520
Not yet.

288
00:26:01,110 --> 00:26:02,850
I wish I could hug you.

289
00:26:07,310 --> 00:26:08,780
What are you saying, P’ Cir?

290
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:15,540
But right now, all I can say is...

291
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:33,060
Good night, my baby boy.

292
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,640
I’m not yours.

293
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,230
And…

294
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,520
Good night to you too...

295
00:26:50,430 --> 00:26:51,440
P’ Cir.

296
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,460
What should I do now?

297
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,020
So this is the Arts student
from the rumors?

298
00:27:38,030 --> 00:27:39,090
You’re pretty cute.

299
00:27:40,350 --> 00:27:43,210
Let me ask you something.
Isn’t Ai Cir mean to you?

300
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:47,090
I heard you guys were holding hands.
So are you a couple now?

301
00:27:47,820 --> 00:27:49,510
I'm heartbroken.

302
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,100
How did you do it? Tell me.

303
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,130
Yeah.

304
00:27:53,250 --> 00:27:56,380
Do you have any idea
how many hearts he's broken?

305
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,680
Even when the juniors greet
him, he totally ignores them.

306
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:02,370
How did you manage
to get his attention? Tell me.

307
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:04,700
- Well…
- Please. Come on.

308
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,420
Tell me.

309
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:10,390
Um…

310
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,010
That's enough, you guys.

311
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,920
You’re questioning him like he's
a criminal. Have some decency.

312
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,610
Oh please, Ai Wim.

313
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:21,580
What right do you have to say that,
when you're making him work for free?

314
00:28:22,510 --> 00:28:24,050
Then go talk to Ai Cir yourself.

315
00:28:28,740 --> 00:28:31,960
Have some snack.
Consider it an apology from me.

316
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:33,160
I’d better get to work.

317
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:40,300
Sorry about those guys.
They just got a bit excited.

318
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,540
Ai Cir looks like
he's about to kill someone.

319
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,480
See? How could everyone not be excited?

320
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:06,110
What do you want me to do, P’ Wim?

321
00:29:06,850 --> 00:29:11,860
Oh, help me sort the documents
into sets and staple them.

322
00:29:12,180 --> 00:29:13,180
That’s all.

323
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,990
I’ll help you.

324
00:29:45,070 --> 00:29:46,630
Wait, Phu! Ai Cir doesn’t…

325
00:29:54,730 --> 00:29:57,800
Ai Cir, come with me.
We need to talk.

326
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:09,000
Come here now.

327
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:12,120
What do you want?
I’m going to help Phu.

328
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,300
Help Phu my ass.
What did you do just now?

329
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:22,740
You ate the snack.

330
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,360
- You usually don’t eat—
- P’ Cir.

331
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,140
Here, I bought this for you.

332
00:30:33,210 --> 00:30:35,340
I see you’re always drinking
coffee from this place.

333
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,810
Here you go.

334
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,890
This is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

335
00:30:54,570 --> 00:30:56,690
You usually don’t eat things
other people buy for you.

336
00:30:56,740 --> 00:31:00,070
When I took a bite of your bread,
you threw it away without thinking twice.

337
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:03,250
So what was that earlier?
You ate the snack Phukan fed you.

338
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:05,600
So how can I not freak out?

339
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:09,540
You should see a doctor.
Seriously, just go.

340
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:11,620
Phu’s not just anyone.

341
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:14,080
The fuck? So I’m someone else now?

342
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,280
I’ve known you since kindergarten.

343
00:31:20,100 --> 00:31:22,530
I won’t say anything anymore.
Fuck, just forget it.

344
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,180
But you’re not actually crazy, right?

345
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,650
I know how you feel about Phu.

346
00:31:38,190 --> 00:31:41,190
But let me make it clear—you’ve
got nothing going on with him.

347
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:43,940
As far as I know, you
only talked to him once.

348
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,120
- And that time you—
- Ai Wim.

349
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:55,670
Fine, I won’t say it anymore.

350
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:58,030
Whatever happens, happens.

351
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:02,130
Come on, go help me over there.

352
00:34:24,340 --> 00:34:25,469
Aren’t you gonna kiss?

353
00:34:27,730 --> 00:34:28,770
You were asleep.

354
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,690
I couldn’t do that without your permission.

355
00:34:35,060 --> 00:34:36,480
I’m awake now.

356
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,590
P’ Cir, what do I do?

357
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:42,090
What’s wrong?

358
00:35:44,170 --> 00:35:45,690
I kissed a guy who has a boyfriend.

359
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,140
You have a boyfriend.

360
00:35:53,250 --> 00:35:54,260
That's you.

361
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,760
True, but… it’s not this Phukan.

362
00:36:00,090 --> 00:36:02,350
Although we have the same
name, same personality

363
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,980
and are so alike in many ways
that you can't tell us apart

364
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:07,280
I'm still a different Phukan.

365
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,420
So… does that make me wrong?

366
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,680
Phu, don’t blame yourself.

367
00:36:25,070 --> 00:36:28,530
If someone’s to blame, it’d be only me.

368
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:41,870
Morning krub.

369
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:43,720
Morning.

370
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:50,770
It still smells nice and feels soft.

371
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,600
Who says your face is greasy?

372
00:36:55,210 --> 00:36:58,790
It still smells nice and feels soft.

373
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:04,260
Quit it. It’s already morning.

374
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,100
What the hell is this?

375
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:26,920
You always can, My P’ Cir.

376
00:37:55,490 --> 00:37:57,810
You managed just fine
for so long without me.

377
00:37:58,340 --> 00:37:59,900
So how can I believe you?

378
00:38:01,490 --> 00:38:04,770
Now that I have you,
I just can’t live without you.

379
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:09,610
I suddenly feel that eating
snacks here tastes better.

380
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,050
So stubborn.

381
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,700
Have you ever thought
about what would’ve happened

382
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:21,830
if you hadn’t answered me that day

383
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,260
or if there was a world where
we didn’t know each other?

384
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,730
If that world didn’t have you

385
00:38:29,130 --> 00:38:31,800
I don’t think… I could go on.

386
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,020
Me too.

387
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:39,280
That’s why you need to promise me that…

388
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
you won’t leave me.

389
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:13,160
I don’t want to be a drum major.

390
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:15,180
But you shouldn’t hurt yourself like this.

391
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,810
You forgot an umbrella again, right?

392
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:18,750
I knew you’d bring me one.

393
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:19,920
Are you going to this university, P' Cir?

394
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,810
I won't get wet anyway.

395
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,840
P’ Cir, we're officially
a couple now, right?

396
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:24,760
You’re done with class?
I’m here to pick you up.

397
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,490
I'll follow you and
get in too, I promise!

398
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:28,040
I passed the exam
and am now your junior.

399
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,290
Don’t you ever leave me.

400
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:31,550
That day will never come. Never.

401
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:56,300
How could I possibly tell you the truth?

402
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,140
When I’m…

403
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,310
Bullshit!

404
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:06,040
You’re so full of shit!

405
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,550
What?

406
00:40:08,550 --> 00:40:11,520
How could you lie like that?
Don’t you care about others’ feelings?

407
00:40:11,550 --> 00:40:13,390
That’s enough, Tee. I’m okay.

408
00:40:13,470 --> 00:40:14,920
It’s totally not okay, Lin!

409
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:18,190
This asshole is using you
as an excuse to dump his ex.

410
00:40:18,320 --> 00:40:20,130
- How could I not get mad?
- No. Don’t—

411
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,910
I’ve said sorry already.

412
00:40:22,040 --> 00:40:23,370
- When?
- Just listen.

413
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,240
I did that so she’d
finally agree to break up.

414
00:40:25,590 --> 00:40:29,200
She was so damn persistent,
I had no choice, alright?

415
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:31,040
You keep saying you had no choice.

416
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,500
Well, I really didn’t!

417
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:34,250
Lin, help me.

418
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,880
What would you do if your ex
did an acid attack on Lin?

419
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:40,710
Use your brain before you lie,
instead of just having it as decoration.

420
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:42,660
Think before you lie!

421
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,760
Okay, okay. Please stop.
I’m sorry. Sorry.

422
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,750
- I said I’m sorry.
- It’s okay, Tee. It’s okay.

423
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:49,710
It’s okay, I’m used to it.

424
00:40:50,470 --> 00:40:51,670
Don’t go soft on him.

425
00:40:52,710 --> 00:40:57,610
We all know that Ai Chi has
always been a complete jerk.

426
00:40:57,640 --> 00:40:58,640
Wait, what?

427
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:03,830
And I know that you’ll
always protect me. Right?

428
00:41:06,710 --> 00:41:07,720
Come on, let’s sit down.

429
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:09,790
It’s okay now.

430
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,680
It’s always like this.

431
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:18,400
I’m more curious about Phu.

432
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:22,160
P’ Cir’s been picking you up
all the time lately. What’s the deal?

433
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:26,170
It’s nothing.

434
00:41:27,020 --> 00:41:28,310
If you say so.

435
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:30,900
He only picks you up and drops you off.

436
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,310
Holds your hand.

437
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:34,160
Follows you to the student union.

438
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:35,800
I believe you, Phu.

439
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,520
It’s okay if you don’t want to tell me.

440
00:41:45,070 --> 00:41:47,560
All that matters is that
you're happy. Right?

441
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,250
Yeah. If it's you, I'll wish you happiness.

442
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,210
But if it’s this asshole,
I’ll curse him to eternal suffering.

443
00:41:57,280 --> 00:41:59,000
- Got it?
- Too harsh.

444
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:05,690
It’s raining? I didn’t bring an umbrella.

445
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,190
Looks like he’s not going to borrow one.

446
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:30,600
I’m heading out first.
Tell Ai Jin for me, okay?

447
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:33,040
Okay. Get home safe.

448
00:43:02,010 --> 00:43:04,340
Why are you standing in the rain
when you have an umbrella?

449
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,920
Look at you, you’re all wet.

450
00:43:07,520 --> 00:43:08,520
Phu.

451
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:09,840
Yes?

452
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,080
P’ Cir, I have something to tell you.

453
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,580
What is it?

454
00:43:21,850 --> 00:43:24,910
I’ve figured out what
to do about us kissing.

455
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,550
I think you can’t live without Phu.

456
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,200
So I’ll be his substitute
until you return to that world.

457
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,240
And if that Phukan is like me,
I’m sure he won’t be angry.

458
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:44,840
Because he wouldn’t want to see you sad.

459
00:43:46,710 --> 00:43:50,100
I may not have known you long,
but I don’t like seeing you sad either.

460
00:43:50,620 --> 00:43:52,620
So, smile more, okay?

461
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:55,450
You’re the most handsome when you smile.

462
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:16,080
What are you doing, P’ Cir? Let me go.

463
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:18,430
I’m not letting go.

464
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,830
But if we don’t hurry, we’ll both get wet.

465
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:26,640
Thank you, Phu.

466
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:30,910
Why are you thanking me?

467
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,900
No matter when…

468
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,880
you always help me.

469
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,590
I’m a selfish guy.

470
00:44:46,370 --> 00:44:49,690
No matter which Phu it is,
I really can’t let you go.

471
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,380
I’ve just decided to send him back

472
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:57,240
and be only a substitute

473
00:44:57,980 --> 00:44:59,950
but why is P’ Cir’s body so warm?

474
00:45:06,150 --> 00:45:07,150
Why…

475
00:45:10,380 --> 00:45:11,870
...don’t I want the rain to stop?

476
00:45:28,880 --> 00:45:30,170
You can handle it from here.

477
00:45:30,900 --> 00:45:31,900
Understood.

478
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:36,990
How is my puppy?

479
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:43,080
Here.

480
00:45:45,620 --> 00:45:47,480
Khun Rames has been acting strange lately.

481
00:45:48,070 --> 00:45:50,320
When I heard that he escaped the hospital

482
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,110
I had someone watch him.

483
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,130
They found that he’s been
spending time with this kid.

484
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:57,030
I’ve had someone investigate him.

485
00:45:57,550 --> 00:45:59,730
But since I’ve never seen him
around Khun Rames before

486
00:46:00,260 --> 00:46:01,540
it’s going to take some time.

487
00:46:03,290 --> 00:46:04,290
Has it been long?

488
00:46:04,810 --> 00:46:05,830
No more than two weeks.

489
00:46:07,180 --> 00:46:10,340
If there’s any update,
report it immediately.

490
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:20,210
I don’t like anyone
meddling with what’s mine.

491
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:23,010
Yes, ma’am.

492
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:36,900
English Subtitles by Saowalak K.

493
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,310
Hey, hurry up.

494
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:50,030
Almost got it. Don’t rush me.

495
00:46:51,250 --> 00:46:52,930
Speed it up, you said you’ve got this.

496
00:46:57,460 --> 00:46:58,500
Come on, come on.

497
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:08,100
The fuck are you doing with Phu’s car?

498
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:09,630
Fuck! This is your car?

499
00:47:14,530 --> 00:47:15,530
Son of a bitch!

500
00:47:23,090 --> 00:47:24,170
Think you're so tough, huh?

501
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:47,500
Bastard!

502
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,520
Fuck you, this isn’t over.

503
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:05,220
Run!

504
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,860
Phu's safety is all that matters.

505
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:49,680
My car’s right there.
I’m heading home now.

506
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:51,820
See ya, bye-bye.

507
00:48:52,330 --> 00:48:53,360
Drive safe.

508
00:49:16,250 --> 00:49:18,590
Wait, there are scratches here?

509
00:49:21,780 --> 00:49:22,790
Never mind.

510
00:49:41,910 --> 00:49:44,990
Do you think P’ Cir from
this world would like me?

511
00:49:45,830 --> 00:49:46,830
Of course.

512
00:49:47,590 --> 00:49:50,720
With how cute you are,
how could I not like you?

513
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:54,070
If you need anything, feel free call me.

514
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,860
I love talking to you.

515
00:49:56,390 --> 00:49:57,450
Stubborn kid.

516
00:49:59,610 --> 00:50:02,390
Sawasdee krub, Khun Rames.
Khun Ratri wishes to see you.

517
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,580
You haven’t changed at all.
