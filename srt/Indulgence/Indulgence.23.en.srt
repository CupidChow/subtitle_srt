of Shengyue Group's charity.

22
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,800
It looks normal.

23
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,520
If we want to know what's wrong with it,

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,640
we might need to verify it again.

25
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:38,840
Is there a problem with this charity?

26
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
This is my father.

Qiu Yu's father?

32
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:03,400
I've never heard Qiu Yu
mention his father.

33
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,480
Our fathers
were in contact with each other.

34
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,360

Qiu Sheng, to manage it.

52
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,320
Wei,

53
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,040
do you remember Mom and Dad's birthdays?

54
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:53,520

The birthdays of Mom, Dad, and Wei

are our little secret.

58
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,600
I might know the password.

59
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,520
We started the charity

60
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,640

61

62
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,720
However, you embezzled
a large amount of the funds.

63
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
You've lost all your conscience.

64
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,000
Mr. Xu, this is the last time.

65
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,240
I won't do it again.

66
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,760
You must forgive me.

67
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,240
Mr. Xu, please forgive me.

68
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,200
Go and surrender yourself.

69
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,520
No!

70
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,640
Mr. Xu!

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,560
This person might want to hide

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,840
the truth about the charity funds.

73
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,800
That was why he faked the accident.

74
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,080
But we can't see his face clearly.

75
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,680
I think this person is Qiu Sheng.

76
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,360
Qiu Yu's father?

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,160
I've been investigating in secret.

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,680
Qiu Sheng used some illegal means

79
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:00,800
to obtain seed money

80
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
and achieved what he has today.

81
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,880
These people were too cruel
just to get money.

82
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,480

83
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
The evidence we have is blurred.

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,400
I'm afraid he can't be convicted
with this alone.

85
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,440
We still shouldn't
let them get away unpunished.

86
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:15,490
Calm down.

87
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,920
We can't act rashly and alert them now.

88
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:19,800
Let's ask Dad

89
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
about what happened in the past.

90
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,240
Is Qiu Sheng
in charge of the charity back then?

91
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,960
Yes.

92
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,560
As far as I know,

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,680
Qiu Sheng's family is poor.

94
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,560
He had no capital to support him.

95
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,440
How did he transform

96
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,000
and become the boss
of a pharmaceutical group?

97
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,160
This is all in the past.

98
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,520
Young people like you shouldn't care.

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,840
Is this related to the truth

100
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
of our parents' accident?

101
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,360
Wei,

102
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,120
are you still investigating this?

103
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:56,000
No matter what the truth is,

104
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,240
we will investigate it until the end.

105
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,840
Wei.

106
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,560
You're here?

107
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,320
You are here earlier than me today.

108
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,120
Yes.

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,320
Didn't you always wait for me
in the past?

110
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,120
How did you hurt your hand?

111
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:19,200
It's nothing. I slipped

112
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,120
yesterday.

113
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,520
You are a doctor.

114
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:25,320
You need to protect your hands.

115
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,960
You care about me so much, Wei.

116
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,440
Oh, Qiu Yu.

117
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,240
I want to ask about your father.

118
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,400
I don't want to speak about him.

119
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,320
Why are you asking this suddenly?

120
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:42,840
I was thinking

121
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,480
that we've known each other
for so many years.

122
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,680
I don't understand your parents

123
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,800
and your family.

124
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,520
Did I fail

125
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,000
as your sister?

126
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,720
It's all right.

127
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:55,880
You just need to know

128
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,360
that I like you, Wei.

129
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,560
I like you too.

130
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,760
Wei, do you like Dr. Bai?

131
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,720
My feelings for Bai Qingyu

132
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,160
is love.

133
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,760

142
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,560
I'll be leaving then.

145
00:06:59,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Sure.

146
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:01,600
As long as you like it.

Xu Wei,

148
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:14,720
you should

149
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,440
stay away from Qiu Yu in the future.

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,040
Why?

151
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,520
Qiu Yu might not know

152
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,560
what Qiu Sheng did.

153
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:22,480

this person

155
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,280
is also dangerous.

156
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,120
How?

157
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,600
Do you still remember

158
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,120
the DNA test report

159
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:31,200
with errors?

160
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,000
He was the one who messed with it.

161
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,320
Look.

162
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,400
Why would he do that?

163
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,080
Don't you know

164
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,440
that he likes you?

165
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,600
But I've only been
treating him as my younger brother.

166
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,400
Xu Wei,

167
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,920
Qiu Yu

168
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,680
is more complicated than you think.

169
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,440
In the future,

170
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,240
you shouldn't meet him alone.

171
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,280
Look. We are back.

172
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,600
Tuan was so obedient
during your examination just now.

173
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,440
You must be tired.

174
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,960
You've worked hard today.

175
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,400
Daddy Bai! Mommy Xu!

176
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:18,880
Tuan.

177
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:20,720
How wonderful.

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,280
Mommy Xu and Daddy Bai
are finally together.

179
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:27,040
Tuan,

180
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,800
you'll be undergoing surgery tomorrow.

181
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:29,880
Are you afraid?

182
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
No.

183
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
Qiu Yu said

184
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,680
I could go out and play
like other children

185
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,040
if I had a new heart.

186
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,400
When Tuan is healthy,

187
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,520
I will take you
to an amusement park, all right?

188
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:43,800
I can finally go to the amusement park!

189
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,600
Come.

190
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:45,600
Let the three of us

191
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,520
