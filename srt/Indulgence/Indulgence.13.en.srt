Where have you been?

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,080
Why are you injured?

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,240
I'm fine. Sorry.

20
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,200
I missed the date last night.

21
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:23,920
Today is our first formal date.

22
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,760
The theme is a hug.

23
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,400
I like this date.

Why are you with him?

25
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:46,000
He gave me a ride.

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,600
Does it hurt?

27
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,840
It's burning.

no matter how others oppose us.

50

What about Qiu Yu?

51
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,440
I didn't know you were
a green-eyed monster.

52
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,360
Answer me.

53
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:10,880
All right.

54

I'm sorry, Dad.

58

I know you found it surprising

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:43,080
that Yu and I were together.

60
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,440
After all, I'm working at Shengyue,

61
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,920
and I'm your adopted daughter.

62
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:50,600
It may have some impact on the company.

63

Here you go.

64

What is this?

65
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,240
I will announce to the public
that I'm no longer your adopted daughter,

66
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,640
and I will leave Shengyue.

67
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,080
But

68
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,760
Yu and I truly love each other.

69
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,760
I don't want to leave him.

70
00:04:15,399 --> 00:04:16,359
I disagree.

71
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,600
What do you disagree with?

72
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,280
I disagree with you leaving
the Bai family,

73
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,920
leaving Shengyue,

74
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,880
and being with Yu.

75
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,800
Is it because of the alliance marriage
between the Bai and Yun families

76
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:28,640
will benefit the company?

77
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:30,720
I believe that I'm capable

78
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,880
of creating another path
for the company.

79

Wei, you're excellent.

if I die.

86
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:43,200
Why?

87
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,040
No why.

88
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,120
I need a reason.

89
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,680
Because you're my biological daughter.

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,560
Back then,

91
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:57,680
your mom died giving birth to you.

92
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,040
And I had to marry with the Yun family.

93
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,160
So I gave you to my best friends,

94
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,480
the Xu couple.

95
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,480
After Xu An and his wife
had an accident,

96
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,200
I brought you back to the Bai family

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,760
under the guise of adoption.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:13,800
Why didn't you

99
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
tell me earlier?

100
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,320
Xu An and his wife
treat you as their own,

101
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,800
and you love them so much.

102
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,720
I don't want to burden you.

103
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,520
So how now?

104
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,240
What do Yu and I do now?

105
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,120
Yu and Shasha getting married

106
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,840
is the best result for both of you.

107
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,920
Yu is stubborn.

108
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,720
