16

Let me down.

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:10,800
Are you sure?

18
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:17,240
Did you put a GPS tracker on me?

19
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:18,480
You always found me wherever I was.

20
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,640
Of course not.

21
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:21,960
Cheng Ning told me about it.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,200
I bet that bad woman was afraid
she'd get drunk.

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,080
She was smart to have found you
to clean up the mess.

25
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,560

Don't you ever say such things again.

You're too adorable to do so.

with someone,

But it is a date.

68
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,720
This is our first date.

69
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,520
Boy.

00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,720
Stop talking nonsense

Your boyfriend is so handsome, Wei.

84

to us sooner.

Hi.

00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,320
My name is Qiu Yu.

89
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,160
Hello.

90
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:33,160
Aren't you...

91
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,200
Yu.

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,680
Is he the one who carried Wei

93
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,040
out of the bar on that night?

94
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,640
You really acted like
a good boyfriend then.

95
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:42,400
Both of you are a match made in heaven.

96
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,040
So are

97
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,720
you and Dr. Bai.

98
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:47,840
Really? Thank you.

99
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,960
I have the same thought.

100
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,360
Well, since we're family,

101
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,000
let's eat together.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:55,400
I don't think this is the right time.

103
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,600
You don't want us to disturb you
when you're dating?

104
00:05:06,493 --> 00:05:07,760
No, I wouldn't want
to disturb you and your fiancée

105
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,680
when you're dating.

106
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
Well, I don't mind.

107
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:19,080
Fine.

108
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:21,400
Since you don't mind,

109
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,240
naturally, I don't mind either.

110
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:30,360
Please have a seat, Ms. Yun.

111
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,200
I never thought

112
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,480
you were this bad at choosing wine.

113
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
How could you be having such wine?

114
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,440
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,400
I ordered this bottle of wine.

116
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,200
If you don't like it,
we could have something else.

117
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,800
I find this wine quite nice.

118
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:55,080
I'm sick of what I've had before.

119
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,280
It's not a bad idea

120
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,960
to try something new.

121
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,200
Let's order now, Wei.

122
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,720
Sure.

123
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,520
Wei.

124
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,400
You don't look good.

125
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:18,840
Is your body heaty?

126
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,880
Why don't I get you a herbal tea

127
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,800
and a Bitter Melon Salad?

128
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,880
Just focus on what you want to order.

129
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,640
And keep your eyes off others' food.

130
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,840
Excuse me, waiter.

131
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:43,000
Hi.

132
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,320
A steak for this lady.

133
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,720
Make it medium.

134
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,640
And one creamy mushroom soup.

135
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,480
Make sure it's light cream.

136
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:51,960
Sure.

137
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:53,120
Thank you.

138
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,080
Wei.

139
00:06:57,600 --> 00:06:58,480
It's all your favorite.

140
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,720
Same as usual.

141
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,840
You know me the best, Qiu Yu.

142
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,240
I'll have a pan-fried cod.

143
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,200
Yu likes cods the most.

144
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,000
It's okay.

145
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,600
I'll have what she has.

146
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,760
I'll have what Yu has, then.

147
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,000
Well, we'll have four sets of that.

148
00:07:18,200 --> 00:07:18,680
Okay, please wait for a moment.

149
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,440
Yu.

150
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,920
Why didn't you order what you like?

151
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:23,720
The wine

152
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,800
has to go well with what you're having.

153
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,720
This wine we're having today

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,560
isn't good enough for my favorite dish.

155
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:36,280
But I think

156
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:39,240
there's no such thing
like high-grade or low-grade red wine.

157
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,760
What matters the most is

158
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,760
you know what suits you.

159
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:49,000
You're right.

160
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,360
It's not a bad idea

161
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,880
to try something new.

162
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,760
I second that.

163
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,520
I think the wine we're having

164
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
goes well with what we're eating today.

165
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,840
Just like Yu and me.

166
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,440
We have to kiss
whenever we clink our glasses.

167
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,360
What kind of weird idea is that?

168
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,640
But

169
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,560
I like it.

170
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,640
I need to use the restroom.

171
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,640
Just let him go.

172
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,200
It's really you, Qiu Yu.

173
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,800
I recognized you at a glance.

174
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,120
So, have you been doing well

175
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:49,600
after leaving the orphanage?

176
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,040
There's no need for small talk, no?

177
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,560
Just say it.
What did you ask me here for?

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,040
Let's join hands.

179
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:57,960
For each other's sake.

180
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,640
Let him hit the hall.

181
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,760
It's a pretty good idea.

182
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,040
Xu Wei.

183
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,120
Are you okay?

184
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,800
What medicine are you taking?

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:15,320
It's my privacy.

186
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,280
It's got nothing to do with you.

187
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:17,760
You're in a very bad shape.

188
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,600
None of your business.

189
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,440
I'll send you to hospital.

190
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,240
Let go.

191
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:28,880
Let go.

192
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,440
Are you alright, Wei?

193
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:34,720
Qiu Yu.

194
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,200
I don't feel well.

195
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,640
I need to leave first.

196
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:38,480
Okay.

197
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,400
Let me send you home.

198
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,920
Please get me home, Qiu Yu.

199
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,600
Wei.

200
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:00,880
Are you having a relapse?

201
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,800
It's all Bai Qingyu's fault.

202
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,640
It's not.

203
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,800
It's just
that I've been stressed at work.

204
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,800
Wei.

205
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,480
What comes may,

206
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:11,240
I will be right by your side.

207
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:12,920
You should head home.

208
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:14,800
Wei.

209
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,760
Let me keep you company tonight.

210
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,520
Head back, I'll be fine.

211
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:21,720
