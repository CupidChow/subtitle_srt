Why are you here?

Xu Wei.

20
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,760
You look really pale at night.

Are you all right?

22
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:30,960
There's nothing wrong with me.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,560
I only had a physiological reaction

Did Yu bully you?

52
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,040
It's not Yu.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,880
It's Xu Wei.

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,320
She almost seduced Yu.

55
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:07,320
Both of them are siblings.

56

It's only natural for them to be closer.

What siblings?

00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,960
They are not related by blood.

59
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,320
Wei is sensible.

60
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:17,520

with your relationship.

is to marry Yu.

64
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,160
In order to match him,

65
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,840
I went to study abroad.

66
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,240
In order to let him like me,

67
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:33,240
I changed my look many times.

68
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,920
However, he won't even look at me now.

69
00:03:36,320 --> 00:03:37,240
Tell me.

70
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,440
What should I do?

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,280
Shasha.

72
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,480

you like Yu sincerely.

74
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
However,

75
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,440
he objects to
the idea of marriage right now.

76
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:49,520
He doesn't hate you.

77
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:51,560
I can wait for him in the past.

78
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,640
I believe he will one day
fall in love with me.

79
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,280
But Xu Wei's appearance

80
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,320

00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,159
Here. Drink it while it's hot.

88
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:21,240
Yu has always been

89
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,000
a stubborn child.

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,320
I'm worried about the marriage.

91
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,800
Their marriage needs to
be put on the agenda.

92
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,600
Go and arrange it.

93
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:31,280
I've checked the calendar.

94
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,400
The 18th of next month
is an auspicious day.

95
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:35,080
Next month?

96
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:37,160
It's rushed

97
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,160
but we do need to get it done soon.

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,120
Useless!

99
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,280

101
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,200
Don't worry.

102
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,680
I will find Zhao Yibin immediately.

103
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:00,120
I also guarantee Xu Wei will
no longer approach Zhao Yibin again.

104
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,640
However,

105
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,040
can you not harm Xu Wei?

106
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:07,160
I hope you can settle it.

107
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,720
Don't force me to do it myself.

108
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,440
Dad, can I see Mom?

109
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:16,400
I'll wait until it's done.
I haven't seen her for years...

110
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,360

Qiu Group.

112
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,000
Are they also investigating Zhao Yibin?

113
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:36,880
Are we still going to investigate him?

114
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Yes.

115
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:46,320
Qiu Group's background is complicated.

116
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,400
It's not that easy
to investigate the group.

117
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,360
We still need to do it.

118
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,720
Sure.

119
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:52,360
Once I have Zhao Yibin's information,

120
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,520
I'll contact you immediately.

121
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,640
Is Qiu Yu also helping Xu Wei
investigate Zhao Yibin?

122
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,080
Or is it more than meets the eye?

123
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,240
Don't you dare ditch me!

124
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:14,520
No.

125
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:15,880
No!

126
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,680
Xu Wei.

127
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,000
When I first met you,

128
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:48,480
everything about you

129
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,360

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,760
and full of vitality.

131
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,000
In the future,

132
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,120
regardless of whether
we are together or not,

133
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:56,880
I also hope

134
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,800
you can bloom again

135
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,360
and be healthy and happy
