You're up, Wei.

Where am I?

18
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:17,920
This is my home.

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:20,840
You drank too much last night.

20
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,720
Thank you.

21
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,000
I've made you some congee.

22
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,440
It will warm up your stomach.

23
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:34,520
I can eat it myself.

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,040
It's fine. I feed you.

Are you not going to work?

27

I thought you were already a grown-up.

50

Why?

I'll come on time

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,280
Are you sure?

72
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,880
You encouraged me to move back,
didn't you?

73
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,560
Why are you moving out now?

74
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,640
I told you I have a lot of work.

75
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,360
I went to your office earlier.

76
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:58,600
They said

77
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,280
you're on vacation.

78
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:02,920
You want to know the reason
why I'm moving out?

79
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:04,080
Fine.

80

I will tell you.

00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,440
Because you're selfish,

00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,880
childish,

83
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:14,720
and arrogant.

Don't touch me.

88
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:27,520
Do I disgust you that much?

89
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,360
Yes.

90
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,640
Is it because of Qiu Yu?

91
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,560
Since you already know it,

92
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:33,840
I'm not going to lie to you.

93
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,400
Compared to you,

94
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,600
Qiu Yu suits me better.

95
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:48,640
From today onward,

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,480
we're just siblings.

Did Bai Zhiyi force you?

99
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,280
It has nothing to do with Dad.

100
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,920
I'm

101
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:04,160
fed up with this.

102
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,680
You're fed up?

103
00:05:10,040 --> 00:05:12,480
Then why did you think
I dated you in the first place?

104
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,960
It was so thrilling

105
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,600
before Dad found out.

106
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,480
Now that he knows,

107
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,760
you're no different
from other men to me.

108
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,720
How insipid.

109
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,520
So

112
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,440
I don't believe this.

Xu Wei.

114
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,320
You must have a reason.

Wei.

116
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,320

118
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:21,960
When were you back?

119
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,840
Was the rescue mission in Africa
going well?

120
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,760
Are you thirsty?
I'll get you some water.

121
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,920
You haven't

122
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,320
had your dinner, right?

123
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,440
I'll order your favorite food.

124
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,800
How about

125
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:33,880
Japanese food?

126
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,480
It's your favorite.

127
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,360
Maybe we can go out and look around.

128
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,800
I'll change my shoes.

129
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,480
I'll change my shoes.

130
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,560
I'll wear them.

131
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,680
I'm changing my shoes.

132
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:46,440
One second.

133
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,680
Where is my phone?

134
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,440
Where is my phone?

135
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760

It's fine.

139
00:06:58,880 --> 00:06:59,920
I know everything.

140
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:03,560
It's all right.

141
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,000
It's all in the past.

142
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,480
Everything has passed.

143

Yu.

144
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,440
It'll ruin your health.
Don't drink so much.

145
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,920
Mind your own business.

146

Yu.

147
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,160
Do you loathe me so much?

148
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:31,840
Is it here?

Yu.

151

Let's drink together.

152
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,120

will go on the stage and bark.

159
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,080
I want to compete with your partner.

160
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,120
It's a dull competition for her

161
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
when no guys here can get her attention.

162
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:14,560
It's dull to me, too.

163
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,800
I think you're chickened out.

164
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,960
How useless.

165
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,720
No competitions.

166
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:22,680
Yu has already drunk a lot.

167
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
This is not fair.

168
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,000
Who are you

169
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,080
to talk to me here?

170
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm his fiancee.

171
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,880
Wei.

172
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
Your friend is trying to embarrass Yu.

173
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:35,959
You should stop her.

174
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,399
Instead, you should stop

175
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,919
your fiance.

176
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:43,840
Let's leave.

177
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:47,600
Xu...

178
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:53,520
A shot of Gin Tonic.

179
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,240
What were you drinking just now, Yu?

180
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,240
We will order the same drink.

181
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:58,520
Wei.

182
00:08:58,520 --> 00:08:59,280
Cheer up.

183
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,600
Qiu Yu.

184
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:01,800
What brings you here?

185
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:02,720
I'm here for you.

186
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:07,680
Perfect timing.

187
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,120
I will leave her to you.

188
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,120
Rest assured.

189
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:10,960
Ning.

190
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,400
It's fine, I'll stay here with you.

191
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,160
Forget it.
