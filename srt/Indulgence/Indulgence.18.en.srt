Wei, you are awake.

00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:13,400
Did I pass out from getting drunk

19
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,840
last night?

00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,960

do you still remember
the promise you made last night?

to another woman.

52
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,960

Can you stop lying?

59
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,920
The transfer of shares is all fake.

60

I investigated it.

61

The day the contract was signed

62
00:03:49,880 --> 00:03:51,400
was before we got into a relationship.

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,360
There was never
an exchange of conditions.

64
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,920
Can you tell me the truth?

65
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,520
They might be excuses

66
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,200
but it is true
that I'm in a relationship with Qiu Yu.

67
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,840
Look into my eyes and say it again.

68
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,160
It's serious

69
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,200

70
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,720
Impossible!

71
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,720
You don't like him at all.

72
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:15,840
We got together last night.

73
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,480

74
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,400

75
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,440
I don't believe it.

76
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,920
Whatever.

77
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,520
You are getting married anyway.

78
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,160

to discuss this topic anymore.

No.

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,920
I don't have nice clothes.

91
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:23,560
Wei.

92
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,680
Don't torture yourself anymore.

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,800
We should cheer up, all right?

94
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,400
But I love him!

95
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:34,720
I don't want to leave him

96
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,560
but we can't be together!

97
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,120
Every time I see him approaching me,

98
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,840
I can't help but get close to him.

99
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:48,880
I don't want to push him away!
What should I do?

100
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:50,400
Wei.

101
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,160
It's not a dead end for you.

102
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,080
Let's go abroad.
I can bring you with me.

103
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,280
Let's leave this place

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:57,480
and start all over again.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,920
I don't want to leave.

106
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,280
You must leave.

107
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,960
Bai Qingyu will get married soon.

108
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,480
If you are still here,

109
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,680
you will only make yourself suffer more.

110
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:13,960
I will book the flight tickets now.

111
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,760
Let's depart tomorrow, all right?

112
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,280
If I want to leave forever,

113
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,880
I still have an important thing to do.

114
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:25,400
Wei,

115
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,120
have you really made your decision?

116
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:32,640
Just come abroad to visit me
in the future.

117
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,720
Wei, if you leave,

118
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:41,080
there's no point
for me to stay here anymore.

119
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:46,360
Of course. If you ask for help,

120
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,240
I will help you

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:49,960
no matter what it is.

122
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,480
Thank you, Qiu Yu.

123
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:01,600
Did you bring a lollipop?

124
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,000
Yes.

125
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,240
Because you are my biological daughter!

126
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,160
Back then,

127
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,520
your mother passed away
due to obstructed labor.

128
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:34,320
I have no choice but to have an
arranged marriage with the Yun family.

129
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,960
That was why
I gave you away to my best friend,

130
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:38,520
the Xu couple to raise you.

131
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:41,240
After something happened
to the Xu couple,

132
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,080
I adopted you...

133
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,560
They...

134
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,080

Xu Wei.

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:53,720
You are destined to not be with Yu.

137
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,720
Yu is finally mine!

138
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:58,880
Well,

139
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:00,680
you shouldn't celebrate so early.

140
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,200
Bai Qingyu still doesn't know about it.

141
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:06,000
If you want him to marry you,

142
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,200
you still need to pressure him more.

143
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,240
Then,

144
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,680
tell me what I should do.

145
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,440
Once it's done,

146
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,320
I will pay you the remaining half.

147
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,160
They are in room 501, let's go!

148
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,120
Hurry!

149
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,280
