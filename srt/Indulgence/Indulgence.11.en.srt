Don't you want

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,200
a gentle girlfriend?

18
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,440
I've fantasized how gentle
you are with me

19
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,600
for a million times.

20
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,080
Our bodies are honest.

21
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,080
But I prefer our hearts to be honest
with each other.

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,320
I made a vow

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,000
that I would never lose
the people I love again.

24
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:47,520
When I found out that
you were terminally ill,

25
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,600
I just realized my feeling towards you.

26
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,160
Did you say I'm terminally ill?

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,080

Xu Wei,

33
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,120
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,240

Senior,

40
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,520
did everything go well last night?

41
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,400
Come over here.

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,360
You're welcome.

Follow me.

46
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:07,000
As I said, there's no need
to thank me for that.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,280
How could you tell such a big lie?

48
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,440
You made Xu Wei cry badly.

49
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:12,080
I think you're really tired of living.

50
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,520
It's not my fault.

51
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,160
It was her who started it.

52
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,680
She closed The Dong

53
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,080
so you can never drink the soup again.

54
