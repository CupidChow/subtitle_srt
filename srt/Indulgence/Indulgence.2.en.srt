16
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,400
How does it feel to have joined
the Bai family as desired?

17
00:01:22,160 --> 00:01:23,080
It feels...

18
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,080
not bad.

19
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,840

When did you return here?

33
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,400
I came back because I've missed you.

34
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:17,400
Why did you get this costume?

35
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,320
It's so adorable!

I didn't expect to see you here.

41
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,760
Aren't we going home?

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,440

47
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:38,280
You know me the best.

48
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,080
We were neighbors abroad for years.

49
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,760
Of course I know you like

50
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:43,720
lollipops the most.

51
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,560
But you shouldn't consume
too much sugar.

52
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,720
It's not good for your health.

53
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,040
You sound like

54

What's your relationship with Dr. Bai?

57
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,960
He's considered my little brother.

58

But

59
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,800
he's not as obedient as you.

60
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:08,520
Certainly.

61
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,960

However,

67
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,720
she's done a good deed.

68
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,000
Wei.

69
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,800
Actually,

70
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,120
I know why you came back to the country.

71
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,920
Yet, no matter what's going to happen,

72
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,240
I will help you unconditionally.

who keeps your word.

Welcome home.

79
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,840
If I hadn't looked into it,
I wouldn't have found out about it.

You cracked my laptop password?

It wasn't hard at all.

83
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,280
Are you aware
that violating one's privacy

84
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:36,160
is an illegal act?

85
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
I wonder if it's considered illegal

86
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
for you to look into this many things.

87
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,120
If I don't look into things thoroughly,

88
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,080
how can I establish myself

89
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:52,440
in the company?

90
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:58,760
You may fool my dad

91
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,520
with this excuse.

92
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,280
Do you think I will buy into it?

93
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,160
Well, what should I do

94
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,160
to make you believe in me?

95
00:06:17,320 --> 00:06:18,160
Rest assured.

96
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,680
I will protect you.

97
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,200
I will protect you in the future.

98
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,320
Were you at the Angel Orphanage

99
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,080
when you were young?

100
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,240
Answer me!

101
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,080
No, I haven't been there.

102
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,480
Are you going to tell me or not?

103
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,520
Whether I've been there or not,
it has nothing to do with you.

104
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,080
Don't challenge my bottom line.

105
00:06:58,760 --> 00:06:59,680
Bottom line?

106
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,000
You barged into your sister's room

107
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,920
to harass her.

108
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:08,120
This is your bottom line you meant?

109
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,360
I'm giving you one last chance.

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,000
Are you going to tell me or not?

111
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,640
I have never been there.

113
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,000
Wei.

114
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,360
Come and have supper.

115
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Madam Yun.

116
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,960
Didn't you just come back?

117
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:26,640
And you're going out again?

118
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,440
Perhaps he's still not used to

119
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,520
having a sister.

120
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,600
It's all right.
Things will get better as time passes.

121
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:46,400
Dad.

122
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,240
Were you looking for me?

123
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:50,880
Wei.

124
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:53,480
Did Yu bully you?

125
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:55,640
No,

126
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:56,840
we were just fooling around.

127
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,640
He's ill tempered indeed.

128
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,520
In fact,

129
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:01,960
he was very good when he was little.

130
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:02,560
Ever since

131
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,920
his mom died in that car accident,

132
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,760
he's been acting

133
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,360
like a different person.

134
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,120
Car accident?

135
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,960
Are you saying

136
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,920
his mom also died in a car accident
20 years ago?

137
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,400
That's right.

138
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,640
Regarding my parents' accident,

139
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,480
I haven't found out anything
until this day.

140
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,320
Could it be that my parents' car

141
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:24,160
crashed with his mom's?

142
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,560
That was nothing but an accident.

143
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,440
Wei.

144
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,159
You've joined the Bai family.

145
00:08:29,159 --> 00:08:30,639
That makes you my daughter.

146
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,240
Just forget about

147
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,240
the past.

148
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
According to the investigation,

149
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
the former chauffeur of the Bai family,

150
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:46,320
Zhao Quanyou is the sole survivor
of that accident.

151
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,800
As a result,
he became disabled in both legs

152
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
and received from the Bai family
a large amount of compensation.

153
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,400

154
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:00,880
