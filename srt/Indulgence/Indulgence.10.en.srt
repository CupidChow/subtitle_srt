119
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:54,440

I have free time.

120
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,760

122
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,600
Senior, in my opinion,

123
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,560
your fall was a blessing in disguise.

124
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,080
Senior,

125
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400

127
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,160

129
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,800

He doesn't have much time left.

147
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,760
His last wish

148
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:32,760
is just to be with you,

149
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,200
and to spend the rest of his life
with you.

you meant your home.

00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,720
I was joining an event at the orphanage
with my parents when I was a child.

155
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,440
I ran into a crybaby who was beaten and
cried when he was rescuing someone.

156
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
Then I found that

157
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:32,320
whenever that crybaby
saw the bright starlight,

158
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:35,039
he'd be happy.

159
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,120
