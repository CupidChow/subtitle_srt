Are you really not my father?

101

But Grandpa said

102
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
that he was going somewhere faraway,

103
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,720
so Dad and Mom would
take care of me instead.

104
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,680
Did Grandpa lie to me?

106
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,240
Your grandpa didn't lie to you.

107

From now on,

108
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,080
you'll have more fathers and mothers
than other children.

109
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,840
And they'll all love you.

110
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,880

113
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,400
And he's...

114
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:04,920
My surname is Xie.

115
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:05,440
Uncle Xie.

116
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,960
I'm Daddy Xie.

117
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,040
There, there.

118
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,040

What's it about?

122
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:20,520
Her condition...

123
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:21,880
We'll talk outside.

124
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,400
Uncle Xie is here.

125
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,440
This little girl

126
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,360
suffers from
severe congenital heart disease.

127
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,960
Is it curable?

128
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,240
She needs a heart transplant surgery.

129
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,960
But the problem is

130
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,360
she's without a guardian.

131
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,560
The only solution to adopt her
from the orphanage she's in.

132
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,160
But this surgery costs a lot.

133
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,120
I'm afraid...

134
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,560
I'll take care of her medical expenses.

135
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,800
That's Tuan's uncle

136
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:02,800
and Zhao Quanyou's nephew, Zhao Yibin.

137
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,040
But he's nothing but a hoodlum.

138
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,240
He tricked Zhao Quanyou out of

139
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,600

from the accident.

142
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I was on my way to look for you.

143
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,720
And I didn't expect
to bump into you here.

144
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:17,680
Why were you looking for me?

145
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,760
I made use of my connections

146
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,360
