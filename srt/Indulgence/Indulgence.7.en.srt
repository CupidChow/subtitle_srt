Get out.

17
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:20,280
I think

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,000
this is my room.

19
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,240
I'll go out, then.

20
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,680
You keep wearing this necklace.

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,560
Is it special to you?

22
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,760
What has it got to do with you?

23
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:38,080
Did you

24
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,440
go to Angel Orphanage
when you were young?

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,400
Why do you keep asking me that?

26
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:45,240
What's the point?

27
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,600
A financial aid program
was held at the orphanage.

28
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,280
Did you join the program?

Madam Yun, I...

32
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,520
Yu, are you home?

33
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,360
I'm coming in.

34
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,960
Are you going to rest so early?

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760

Have you seen Wei?

40
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,120
Madam Yun.

41
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,480

is looking for you.

00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,200
He wants you to go to his study room.

53
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:02,440
Okay.

54
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,160

55
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,520

to go to his study room.

Why are you looking for me?

Yu.

61
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,280
You don't have to handle the company.

62
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,480
But I hope

63
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,880
that you can treat Wei better.

64
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,800
Treat her like a real sister.

65
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:37,920
Can you do that?

66
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,160
I treat her quite well.

67
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:40,240
You call that well?

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,800
Do you want to infuriate me to death?

69
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,040
What are you trying to say?

70
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,320
I know

71
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:47,480
that your mum's accident
has traumatized you.

72
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:48,480
Don't talk about her!

73
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,320
If you didn't toss her aside
because you had

74
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,760
another woman,

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,200
she wouldn't have left because of you

76
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,640
and got into an accident.

77
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,240
You killed her.

78
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
I know that I did your mother wrong.

79
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:01,920
You can hate me.

80
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,720
But Wei is innocent.

81
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,840
Her parents died in that accident too.

82
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:10,040
It was even more traumatic for her.

83
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,080
Are you saying

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:14,640
the husband and wife who died
in the same accident as my mum

85
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,560
were Xu Wei's parents?

86
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,920
To be exact,

87
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,760
your mother's car ran into
her parents' car

88
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,760
and killed them in the accident.

89
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,320
Is that why you adopted her?

90
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,880
To compensate her?

91
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,280
After the accident,

92
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,440
Wei couldn't accept it for a long time

93
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,000
and fell into a deep depression.

94
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,720
So, I sent her abroad for treatment.

95
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:37,120
I'm very glad that she has
turned into someone

96
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,440
cheerful and positive now.

97
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,840
I just hope
that you can treat her better

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
and stop picking on her,

99
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:45,800
okay?

100
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,160
I understand.

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,240
This is why you entered the Bai family.

102
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,600
You acted like you didn't care.

103
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:14,040
Now,

104
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,000
your greed is starting to show, right?

105
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:18,400
Do you know

106
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,720
that everyone is talking

107
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,960
about your improper relationship
with my dad?

108
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:22,400
A woman like you

109
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,480
can do anything for money, right?

110
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,680
I was such a scoundrel.

111
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:34,720
Mr. Landlord.

112
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,720
This is a three million cheque.

113
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,520
We can sign the contract now.

114
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm not selling the house anymore.

115
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,680
You are not selling the house anymore?

116
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,320
But I...

117
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,000
But you can continue to rent it.

118
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,080
Thank you, Mr. Landlord.

119
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,080
Hello.

120
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,040
Mr. Bai.

121
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,760
As per your request,

122
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,240
I've told Ms. Xu that the house
is not on sale anymore.

123
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,240
Okay. I got it.

124
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,280
Thank you for paying
the debt off for my son.

125
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:08,480
Your secret will be safe with me.

126
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,760
Don't disturb her anymore after this.

127
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,440
You can rest assured.

128
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,360
You scared me.

129
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,640
I thought that you were Madam Yun.

130
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
Why are you drinking alone

131
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:33,720
so happily?

132
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,640
Because something good happened.

133
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
You are still sick.
You can't drink alcohol.

134
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,760
You should take your medicine.

135
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:45,240
I have recovered. I'm fine now.

136
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,440
This is the consequence
of lying to a doctor.

137
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,480
Be good and drink the medicine.

138
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,640
You drink wine while I drink medicine.

139
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,320
That's too unfair.

140
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,600
You can pretend that it's wine.

141
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:01,960
Cheers.

142
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,160
Xu Wei.

143
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:20,920
I'm sorry.

144
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,520
What did you say?

145
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,760
I couldn't hear you.

146
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,120
I'm sorry.

147
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,680
I misunderstood you

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,040
about the cheque.

149
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,280
I accept your apology.

150
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,360
But I have a condition.

151
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:39,200
If it's about drinking wine, forget it.

152
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,160
Just a glass.

153
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,880
I slept too much during the day.
I can't sleep at night.

154
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,240
When you've recovered,
I'll drink with you.

155
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,680
Let me check your body temperature.

156
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,840
When I've recovered,
I don't need your company anymore.

157
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:56,760
You can't run away from me.

158
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,720
Yu.

159
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,120
I want to talk to you.

160
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:16,760
Okay.

161
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,040
I don't need the money anymore.

162
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,000
I'm here to return it.

163
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,440
We are a family.
You don't owe me anything.

164
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,600
Keep the money for yourself.

165
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,880
No. I can't take so much money from you.

166
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,040
Although I don't care
what others say about me,

167
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,559
I have my own principles.

168
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,439
Sometimes,

169
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,920
you can be

170
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,159
as stubborn as your brother.

171
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,640
If that's the case,

172
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:41,039
I'll give you back

173
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,280
what is rightfully yours.

174
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:46,200
Yu.

175
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:48,360
Don't you think you've gotten

176
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,080
too close to Wei recently?

177
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,400
Why are you saying a different thing
from my dad?

178
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,320
He asked me to treat Xu Wei better.

179
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,920
What he wants

180
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,320
is for you to treat her
like a real sister.

181
00:08:59,320 --> 00:08:59,760
Not...

182
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:00,920
What are you trying to say?

183
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,520
Shasha is coming back soon.

184
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:07,960
If you are here
to talk about your niece,

185
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,320
we can end this conversation now.

186
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,400
Yu.

187
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,240
You grew up with Shasha since young.

188
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,760
Although she's adopted,

189
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:17,160
she's highly valued by the Yun family.

190
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:20,160
The union between the two of you
will bring you happiness.

191
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,600
Happiness?

192
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:26,440
When my mum passed away,

193
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,400
Bai Zhiyi married you for the benefit

194
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,280
of the family.

195
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,560
Are you happy now?

196
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,440
Madam?

197
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,880
I just want you to be happy.

198
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,360
My happiness is not decided by others.

199
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,480
Let me tell you.

200
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,880
Once Yun Shasha comes back,

201
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,120
I'll break off the engagement with her.

202
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,680
Yu.

203
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,320
Listen to me.

204
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,320
Even if you don't like Shasha,

205
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,520
you can't fall in love with Xu Wei.

206
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
After all, she's your sister nominally.

207
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,440
If you say that,

208
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,600
Yun Shasha is also my cousin nominally.

209
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,840
That's different.

210
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,840
Your engagement has been set
a long time ago.

211
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:56,800
Stop it.

212
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:58,760
I didn't agree to the engagement.

213
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,200
But I will break it off myself.

214
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,480
Yu.

215
00:10:02,927 --> 00:10:03,800
[Share Transfer Agreement]

216
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,080
This is the share transfer contract.

217
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,080
These were your parents' shares.

218
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,120
Now that you've grown up,

219
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,160
it's time for me to return these to you.

220
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,240
My parents' shares?

221
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,200
Yes.

222
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Back then,

223
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,400
the company was
in a critical financial crisis.

224
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,560
Your parents sold their house resolutely

225
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,920
to invest in the company.

226
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,960
And that helped me resolve
the biggest crisis I've ever faced.

227
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,280
I've taken care
of these shares for years.

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:31,840
It's time to return them to you.

229
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,160
Why are you returning them to me?

230
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:36,560
You fool.

231
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,400
These were rightfully yours.

232
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:39,840
Of course I have to return them to you.

233
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:41,080
After a few years,

234
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,680
I'll be fully retired.

235
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,800
And I'll leave the company
in your hands.

236
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,280
You are my perfect successor.

237
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,640
What about Yu?

238
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,920
That brat

239
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:52,480
doesn't want anything
to do with the company.

240
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,320
I'll feel more assured

241
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,800
to hand over the company to you.

242
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,360
Thank you, Dad.

243
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,440
Forget about your past.

244
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,400
You are Bai Zhiyi's daughter,
my daughter.

245
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:06,360
I'll give you a happy family.

246
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,960
So far, I can rule out my dad completely
from being the culprit.

247
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,240
But based on Zhao Yibin's reaction,

248
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,040
that accident was a curated one.

249
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,160
But who is the mastermind

250
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,920
behind Zhao Yibin?

251
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:31,680
Hello.

252
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,040
Hello, Ms. Xu.

253
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:35,080
Can I ask you for a favour?

254
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,200
Xie Zan.

255
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,760
What happened?

256
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,760
Can you

257
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,840
keep Senior company today?
