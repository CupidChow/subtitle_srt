[Episode 17]

16
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,320
Why won't you admit that you love me?

17
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,080
Because the price Dad paid

18
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,960
is worth way more than your love.

19
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,200
What do you mean?

20
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,120
Mr. Bai Jr., perhaps you still
don't know what you are worth.

21
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,760
After signing this contract,

22
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:58,200
Bai Qingyu,

23
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,000
you can only be my younger brother.

24
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,920
You transferred
part of Shengyue's shares

25
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,160
to force Xu Wei to leave me.

26
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,960
Since you know everything,

27
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,160
why do you still ask me?

28
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:17,680
You are so despicable.

29
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,560
Despicable?

30
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,240
I just don't want you to act on impulse.

31
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,920
Being impulsive

32
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,600
won't solve any problems
in the adult world.

33
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,160
That is why you used money to solve it.

I won't marry Shasha.

37
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,560
Why don't you think of a way
to bribe me as well?

38

Xu Wei won't like you.

Dr. Bai, are you emphasising
that Wei likes you?

46

I've known Wei for so many years.

47
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:15,600
We understand each other and
we have so many memories of each other.

48

What about you?

49
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,440
You are just her younger brother.

50
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,360
So,

51
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,800
the person who should leave Wei

52
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,720
is you.

53
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,760
I won't give her to you.

54
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,080
I don't need you to do that.

55
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:39,840
She is supposed to belong to me.

56
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:01,920
I said I don't need you to accompany me.

57
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:04,280

63

Do you feel better?

64
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,360
Much better.

65
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,360
It still hurts a little.

66
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:28,880
Come upstairs and put some eye drops.

67
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:42,280
Wei.

68
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,600
It's late. You should go back.

You and Bai Qingyu
are not destined to be together.

when I celebrated my birthday.

81
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,680
I was very lonely.

82

Later,

83
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:35,880
I met you.

84
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,480
You looked at the stars with me
all the time

85
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,840
and told me everyone had a guardian star

86
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:45,800
who would accompany them forever.

87
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:48,520
Since then,

88
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,480
I no longer feel lonely anymore.

89
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:52,480
Yes.

90
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,840
That was also

91
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,760
the faith that used to keep me going

92
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,040
and helped me overcome

93
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,160
my darkest period.

94
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:05,400
Wei,

95
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,680
you are my guardian star.

96
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,440
I am also your guardian star.

97
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,840
Wei,

98
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,520
why don't we return and live abroad?

99
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,120
We can still live
that kind of peaceful life.

100
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,280
All right?

101
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:22,240
I still have unfinished business.

102
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,280
I can't go back.

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,360
Wei,

104
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,360
can you love me?

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,080
I've always loved you.

106
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,280
Really?

107
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:35,720
Of course.

108
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:38,080

110
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:48,680
Wei,

111
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:53,560
I've never had any love since young.

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,640
I don't know

113
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,800
how it feels to be loved.

114
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,880
I'm really eager for love.

115
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,440
It's quite nice to not know that.

116
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,360
Because loving someone

117
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,440
is really difficult.

118
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:22,720
Yu.

119
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,480
Yu.

120
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,640
Why did you come back so late?

121
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,600
I learned how to boil soup from Aunt.

122
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:29,760
Let me get you a bowl.

123
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:31,960
Come here.

124
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,400
Shasha.

125
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,920
You don't need to do so much.

126
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:39,640
Yu.

127
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,320
We will get married.

128
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:42,520
I'll be your wife
who loves you the most.

129
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,640
Shasha, enough.

130
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,920
We will never get married.

131
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,040
Why?

132
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:49,880
You got injured
to protect me when you were young.

133
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,880
I'm sure you like me.

134
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:53,360
I protected you

135
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,560
because I saw you as my younger sister.

136
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,560
I don't want others to bully you.

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:07:59,520
Yu,

138
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:01,880
I can change if I'm doing badly.

139
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,480
I will become the person you like.

140
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,400
Even if...

141
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:08,640
Even if I become Xu Wei's shadow,
I'm still willing to do that.

142
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,600
You've done well.

143
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,080
There's no need to change yourself.

144
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,200
However, the person I love

145
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,080
is Xu Wei.
