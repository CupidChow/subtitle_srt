[Episode 26]

16
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,360
I thought my life would get better

17
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:16,240
but I fell into a deeper abyss.

18
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:21,080
I didn't know it was like this, Qiu Yu.

19
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,560
My father isn't Qiu Sheng!

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,960
I am not Qiu Sheng's son!

21
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:32,080
I am an offspring of my mother's affair.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,080
The fact that I'm alive
is a humiliation to Qiu Sheng.

23
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:42,720
How ironic.

24
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:46,120
How laughable.

25
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,000
I didn't know.

26
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,680
Does it hurt?

27
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:00,440

I lived my happiest moments

31

because I met you.

32
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,200
Wei, I don't want you to pity me.

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,240
I want you to love me

34
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,000

Wei,

40
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,520
it's fine even if you don't love me.

41

Just leave with me.

All right, Wei.

52
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,240
Give me the SD card.

53
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,680

54

Loving a person

109
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,120
I'll give you two options.

110

Although you are detestable,

119
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,520
you are also pitiful.

120
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,920

Qiu Sheng,

133
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,000
you will be punished by heaven
for all the evil deeds you've done!

134
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm waiting for Heaven to punish me.
