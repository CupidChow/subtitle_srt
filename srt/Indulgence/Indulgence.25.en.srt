Are you awake?

18
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,400
You were involved in a traffic accident.

19

Someone sent you here.

20

Then...

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:32,360
What about my child?

00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,840
I know many hackers nowadays

52
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,720
can hear other people's phones remotely

53
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
to steal information
or listen to what they say.

54
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:01,480
Qiu Yu was listening to my calls.

55
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,640

the truth behind your parents' accident?

I've solved it.

111
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,280
I'll say it.

112
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,080
His father, Qiu Sheng,

113
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,600
asked me to mess with
the Bai family's car

114
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,960
and said it was
just to cause a small accident.

115
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:30,960
I was worried

116
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,080
and followed behind them.

117
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:35,800
In the end, Qiu Sheng used a truck

118
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,200
to force the Bai family and
Xu family to crash into each other.

119
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,680
That's murder!

120

I beg you.

122
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,040
Can you let me go?

123
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,120
I beg you.

124
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,080
I see.

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,880
Wei,

126
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:04,600
you know the truth now.

127
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,480
I've also avenged you.

128
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Let's go abroad

129
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,920
and live a life without worries,
all right?

130
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,240
I won't leave.

131
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,440
I want the real murderer

132
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,120
to be punished by law.

133
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:24,720
Wei,

134
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,320
you will never win against him.

135
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,520
He can use any means possible.

136
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,760
I don't want you to get hurt.

137
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,320

138
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:35,160

Qiu Yu.

140
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,360
Qiu Sheng is your father.

141
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,000
Everything you did

142
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,040
was to cover up his crime.

143
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,560
No, Wei. Listen to me.

144
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:48,520
Listen to me.

145
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:50,360
I have nothing to do with him.

146
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,960
I just want to protect you.

147
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
Protect me?

148
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,800
You listened to my conversations

149
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,320
and kidnapped Tuan to threaten me.

150
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:02,840
Is that what you call protecting me?

151
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,800
Wei, I had no choice.

152
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,040
I had no choice.

153
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,720
Please believe me, Wei.

154
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,960
Qiu Yu,

155
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,800
why did you become someone like this?

156
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,360
Yes. Why did I become someone like this?

157
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:30,160
I was dumped at an orphanage
as soon as I was born.

158
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,000
I was bullied.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,160
One day, I found my biological mother

160
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:38,880
and my biological father.

161
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,400
Did you know how happy I was?

162
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,640
I wanted to tell the whole world

163
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,720
that I had parents.

164
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,840
But when I first returned home

165
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,600
and saw my mother for the first time,

166
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,200
she was already crazy
from being tortured

167
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:00,400
by that devilish man.

168
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,360
Do you know that?

169
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,960
She didn't recognise me.

170
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,560
