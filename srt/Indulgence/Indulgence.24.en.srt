16
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Dr. Bai, you've been hiding
your cooking skills all this while.

17
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,000
Pretty Lady, please enjoy your meal.

18
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,760
It looks delicious.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,080
If you marry me,

20
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:27,760
I can cook three meals for you
every day.

21
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,120
Marriage is an important event in life.

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,800
I must consider it well.

23
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,200
What is there to consider?

24
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,280
The future.

25
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,880
Don't consider it anymore.

26
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:37,080
If you marry me,

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,440
we can adopt Tuan.

28
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:40,440
Then, we'll become
a real family of three.

31
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,560
All right.

32
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:49,600

Yu,

40
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,720
you must marry me this time.

41
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,560
Shasha, I've said it many times.

42
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,920
It's impossible between us.

43
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,760
You are a doctor.

44
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,680
See for yourself.

45
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:48,920
You are pregnant?

00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,800
It's not mine.

48
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:55,240
Yu, why won't you admit it?

49
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,480
The child is yours.

50
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,240
Nonsense!

51
00:02:57,560 --> 00:02:59,160
Nothing happened between us.

52
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,040
Trust me.

53
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,400
I'm innocent.

54
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:04,600

00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,600
This is bad for your health.

58
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760

Don't worry.

61
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,840
I will raise the child with you

62

That day, we...

67
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,760
I remember.
You have a mole near your collarbone.

68
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,200
If nothing happened between us,

69
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,920
how would I know that?

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,480
A mole?

71
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:40,600
There's no mole near my collarbone.

72
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:49,240
No way.

73
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,200
Shasha, think about it.

74
00:03:53,720 --> 00:03:55,240
Are you sure it's at this position?

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,320
Yu.

76
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,240
I'm sure.

77
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,240
Qiu Yu has a mole here.

78
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,400

79
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,760

80
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,000

00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,840

at the hotel that night.

83
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,720
It was you, right?

84
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,080
So what?

85
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:45,520
Why would you do that?

86
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,440
Didn't you want Bai Qingyu?

87
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,760
I was only helping you.

88
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,120
So,

89
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,360
the child in my stomach

90
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,400
is yours?

91
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,360
What?

92
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,120
Child?

93
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,960
I am pregnant.

94
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,160
I want to give birth to the child.

95
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,440
You can't.

96
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:17,560
Why not?

97
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,960
I'm already an orphan.

98
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:20,920
I can't let my child become an orphan.

99
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,400
Come with me to the hospital.

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,080
I'm not going!

101
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,760
I want to give birth to the child.

102
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,000
Are you sure?

103
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:36,040
Fine. Do it.

104
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,880
I still won't accept him as my child.

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:39,800
Why?

106
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,520
You are sick.

107
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,920
I want to give birth to the child.

108
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,080
Move!

109
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:46,920
I won't...

110
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,480
Shasha!

111
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,520
Can you calm down?

112
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,320
We are already living a petty life.

113
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,400
Do you want the child in your stomach

114
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,920
to be as petty as us?

115
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,400
Wei.

116
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,600
Why did Tuan go missing suddenly?

117
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,560
We didn't notice when she left her room.

118
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,200
We looked all over the place

119
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,000
but we couldn't find her.

120
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,040
That's impossible.

121
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,200
Tuan is obedient.
She won't simply run around.

122
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:19,240
All of you are so irresponsible!

123
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,560
Calm down.

124
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,040
Qiu Yu is Tuan's attending doctor.

125
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:24,080
Perhaps he knows where Tuan is.

126
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,680
Where is Dr. Qiu?

127
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,600
Dr. Qiu took a day off. He's not here.

128
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,600
What a coincidence.

129
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,400
The number you are calling
has been switched off.

130
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,360
Qiu Yu switched off his phone.

131
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,400
Do you know why I'm punishing you?

132
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,880
You actually pushed Qiu Group

133
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,960
into the eye of the storm for a woman.

134
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,400
I didn't.

135
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,240
How dare you talk back to me!

136
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:54,240
Xu Wei's SD card
has very important evidence

137
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,840
but you hid it from us.

138
00:06:57,240 --> 00:06:58,040
How did you know that?

139
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,160
You were spying on me!

140
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,280
I kept you alive

141
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,400
because I thought you'd be useful.

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,200
Unexpectedly,

143
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,560
you are just as useless
as your dead and crazy mother.

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:08,640
What did you say?

145
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,520
Isn't my mother at the sanatorium?

146
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,440
Let me tell you honestly.

147
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,720
Your crazy mother

148
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,200
died two years ago.

149
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,280
The woman you see in the video

150
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,920
is someone I asked
to pretend to be your mother.

151
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,120
Dad.

152
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,680
Why did you kill her?

153
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,040
How did she die?

154
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:25,840
Tell me!

155
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,480
Don't call me Dad!

156
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,480
You are not my son!

157
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
Your existence is proof of her betrayal!

158
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,600
You are
the greatest humiliation of my life!

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:38,800
Dad.

160
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,720
Dad.

161
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,040
Give me another chance.

162
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:42,680
Tuan is innocent.

163
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,840
Release Tuan, all right?

164
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,160
I beg you, Dad.

165
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:46,920
I beg you.

166
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,960
That girl

167
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:51,000
is the punishment for your disobedience.

168
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,440
You can punish me however you like!

169
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,320
Tuan still has surgery today!

170
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,000
Are you going to save her?

171
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,080
Go to Xu Wei

172
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,800
and use the SD card to exchange for her.

173
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,200
Otherwise,

174
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,040
don't blame me for being cruel.

175
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,080
Mom.

176
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:31,160
Mom, can you...

177
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,920
Can you accompany me, Mom?

178
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,760
Let me tell you honestly.

00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,120
Your crazy mother died two years ago.
