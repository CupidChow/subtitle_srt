00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,160
I will help you

17
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:07,200
choose your wedding dress.

18
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:09,720
Yun Shasha, why are you here again?

19
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,800
I called her here

20
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,200
to discuss the wedding details.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,200
Bai Zhiyi, I've said it many times.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,640
I will never marry Yun Shasha.

23
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,160
Yu,

24
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:21,440
I didn't want to expose you.

25
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:24,040
That night at the hotel,

26
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,680
we...

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:27,400
Have you forgotten?

28
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,680
What hotel?

29
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,080
I never went to a hotel

30
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,440
and I would never lay my hands on you.

31
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,640
Yu, why won't you admit it?

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,120
I didn't do it

33
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,160
so how can I admit it?

34
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:36,720
Yu,

35
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:39,560
you and Shasha will get married soon.

36
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,280
Yun Shasha, are you trying
to force the wedding with this method?

37
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,840
Do you think she will
use her innocence to falsely accuse you?

38
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,920
Even if Xu Wei and I are siblings

39
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,840
and we will never be together,

40
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,800
I still won't marry Yun Shasha.

41
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:54,960
Ridiculous!

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,360

such an irresponsible child!

43
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,120
I won't marry any woman

44
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,520
and sleep with other women.

45
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,920
You'd rather believe an outsider
instead of me.

46
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,960
I'm speechless.

47
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:06,920
You...

48
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:15,920
Did you say
the chairman of Qiu Group, Qiu Sheng,

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,960
was my father and
Xu Wei's father's classmate?

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:19,840
Back then,

51
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,640
they started a charity
that sponsors orphanages.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,800
Qiu Sheng was
in charge of managing the funds.

53
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,200
However, something happened in between

54
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,040
and the plan was halted.

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,160
That traffic accident happened

56
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,120
when our parents

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,600
were on their way to the charity event.

58
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,480
Are they somehow related?

59
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,240
The most important thing now
is that we can't find Zhao Yibin.

60
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,120
Don't worry. I will keep investigating.

61
00:02:48,880 --> 00:02:51,120
Why did you call me here?

62
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,960
Wei, I beg you.

63
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:57,000
Yu still won't marry me.

64
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,520
I can't help you with this.

65
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,680
But we slept together.

66
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,120
Yu won't take responsibility.

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,920
We were drunk that night

68
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:14,400
so Yu...

69
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,400
You should

70
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,440
take care of your own problems.

71
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,880
Yu is dumping me because of you!

72
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,960
You caused all the pain.

73
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,840
Without you, Yu and I will be happy.

74
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:40,760
Xu Wei,

75
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,720
you forced me to do this.

76
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,560
Isn't this Xu Wei,
the boss of Shengyue Group?

77
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,320
How did Mr. Bai fall for her?

78
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,960
This woman is so shameless.

79
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,160
Aren't they siblings?

80
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:02,440
How could they do this?

81
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,640
Isn't that incest?

82
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,560
People are willing to
do anything for money

83
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,160
in this society.

84
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:07,920
Looking at her face,

85
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,360
I'm sure she seduced Dr. Bai on purpose.

86
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,400
I heard she did it
for the Bai family's asset.

87
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,160
Xu Wei!

88
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:35,520
Xu Wei!

89
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,840
I am Xu Wei.

90
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,840
I am the culprit in this incident.

91
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,520
I approached Bai Qingyu on purpose.

92
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,720
I ruined his marriage agreement.

93
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,160
I hope all of you

94
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,000
can return his peaceful life to him
after I leave.

95
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:15,280
Thank you.

96
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,120
Sorry, Yu.

97
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:27,720
This is the only thing I can do for you.

98
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,960
Bai Qingyu, go to the hospital rooftop.

99
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,160
Wei is going to commit suicide.

100
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:38,920
All right.

101
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:48,080
Xu Wei!

102
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:48,680
Xu Wei!

103
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:49,800
No!

104
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:53,400
Yu.

105
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:57,560
I started all the rumours.

106
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,920
If I die,

107
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,440
you can live a normal life.

108
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:03,800
I don't want you to die.

109
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:04,720
Come down first.

110
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,280
Don't come here.

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,120
All right.

112
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,640
I won't.

113
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,000
Calm down first.

114
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,360
Yu.

115
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:15,162
When I die,

116
00:06:15,577 --> 00:06:17,017
everything is over.

117
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,720
If you want to die, I will die with you.

118
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,520
Why are you doing this?

119
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,600
Do you still remember?

120
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,680
You protected me at the orphanage
when we were young.

121
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,600
Since then, I swore

122
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,080
to love and protect you
once I found you.

123
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:37,200
However, I didn't expect

124
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:39,240
to harm you the most.

125
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,800
Xu Wei.

126
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:42,840
Sorry.

127
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:43,920
This time,

128
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,720
I won't let you bear the pain anymore.

129
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,400
This time,

130
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,080
even if we die,

131
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,160
we must die together.

132
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:10,680
All right?

133
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,640
Yu! Wei!

134
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:26,040
Don't do it!

135
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,000
Both of you are not siblings!

136
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:34,400
That's...

137
00:07:38,841 --> 00:07:39,481
Zhiyi.

138
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,840
When you married my sister,

139
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,920
she was unwell

140
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,200
and kept having miscarriages.

141
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,280
In the end,

142
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,640
we were forced to go abroad
to take care of her foetus.

143
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,480
Indeed.

144
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,800
When we were abroad,

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,360
she had another miscarriage.

146
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,640
Also,

147
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,240
she could never get pregnant again.

148
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,920
To get a child,

149
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,520
you forced my mother

150
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:04,887
without considering her health.

151
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:07,120
Yu, let me finish.

152
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
When I broke up with my boyfriend,

153
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,920
I realised I was pregnant.

154
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:16,400
I gave birth abroad.

155
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:17,840
Sister,

156
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,000
give this child to me.

157
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:22,280
Without this child,

158
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,360
I don't know

159
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,560
how I can keep my marriage.

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,480
I beg you.

161
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,200
All right?

162
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,400
I can't reject my elder sister

163
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,519
so I gave her my child
to be taken back to the Bai family

164
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,039
and be raised as her own son.

165
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,280
That child was you,

166
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,760
Yu.

167
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,560
What?

168
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,120
It's me?

169
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,200
Is Yu Madam Yun's son?

170
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,960
Before my elder sister passed away,

171
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:02,800
I swore before her

172
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,080
to never reveal Yu's identity.

173
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,480
However, I never expected

174
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,320
my decision to
almost cause both of your deaths.

175
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,640
So, Xu Wei

176
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,520
is Father's biological daughter

177
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,480
but I am your biological son.

178
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,960
However, the DNA test
states that our probability as siblings

179
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,160
is very high.

180
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:28,520
I can confirm

181
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,960
that you and Xu Wei

182
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,040
are not related by blood at all.

183
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,680
Does it mean there's a problem
with the DNA test report?
