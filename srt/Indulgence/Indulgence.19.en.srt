16
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,480
How's Wei?

17
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,400
Are what the reporters say true?

18
00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:32,040
I planned

19
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,400
to let Wei stay in the Bai residence
as an adopted daughter

20
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,760
but I didn't expect
things to turn out this way.

21
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,600
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

22
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:42,560
If I told you earlier,

23
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,400
there would be another person suffering.

24
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,000
So you let her

25
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,640
suffer the pain alone?

26
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:50,080
Yu.

27
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,440
You should understand
your father's difficulties.

28
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,720
I do understand

29
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,680
but do you know

30
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,680
how much pressure she bore alone?

31
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:06,319
No matter how much money we spend,

32
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,960
we must block this news.

33
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,880
Don't let any news get out.

34
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:11,840
Yes.

35
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:15,880
Dr. Wang,

36
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,680
How is Xu Wei's examination result?

37
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,680
The patient is suffering
from serious depression.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,840
Depression?

39
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,240
How is it possible?

40
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,480
She was
such a bright and cheerful person.

41
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:28,400
She suffers from Sunshine Depression.

42
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:30,960
She looked happier
and more cheerful than others

43
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:33,120
but once she feels emotional,
it will be worse than others.

44
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:45,280
The patient is currently
in the outbreak period.

45
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,200
She can't be stimulated any further.

46
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,080
I understand.

47
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,280
I won't let her get hurt anymore.

48
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,040
Sorry.

49
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:58,840
I don't understand you enough.

50
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,760
I didn't even know that you were ill

51
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,320
and tried to push me away
with various excuses.

52
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,760
I failed to protect you

53
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,480

55

You drugged Xu Wei, right?

56

You dragged me out for this?

57
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,400
If I didn't drug her,

58
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,200

will happen to you and Xu Wei.

Let me tell you.

64

I can do whatever it takes
to achieve my goal

65
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,280
but I won't allow anyone
to harm Xu Wei.

66

You better not challenge
the limit of my patience.

67
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,640
Why?

68
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,160
Why is everyone protecting Xu Wei?

69

What's so good about her?

70
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,480
You will never be as good as her.

00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,720
She is still in a coma.

75
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,320
Come out.

76
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,760
This is

77
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:39,280
for Xu Wei.

78
00:04:39,760 --> 00:04:41,920
She suffered more pain
because of how much she loved you.

79

It's right of you to slap me.

80

Stop trying to act pitifully.

81

83
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,360
Do you know

84
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,160
that she is preparing to move abroad

85
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,760
to avoid your wedding with Yun Shasha?

86
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,720
I didn't expect this

87
00:04:58,920 --> 00:05:00,000
to be the result.

88
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:02,080
Sorry.

89
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,280
If you want what's best for her,

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,840
leave the hospital now

91
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,320
and never appear in front of Wei again!

92
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,080
It's late.

93
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,560
Go back to your room and sleep.

94
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:25,520
No.

95
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,000
When I go back,

96
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,360
I will think of her.

97
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,040
Wei hid it from you

98
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,240
because she didn't want you
to feel dejected like you are right now.

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,560
You are the one

100
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,120
who caused all of these.

101
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,320
Xu Wei's foster parents

102
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,600
died in a traffic accident
when she was very young.

103
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:47,800
Why didn't you

104
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,680
take her into the Bai family sooner?

105
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,640
Wei has

106
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,680
a sensitive personality.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,520
She has prioritised
relationships since young.

108
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,920
Her foster parents' death

109
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,120
became a trauma inside her.

110
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,600
After years of treatment abroad,

111
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,640
She has slowly recovered
from her depression.

112
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,120
Unexpectedly...

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,280
I knew nothing

114
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,520
like a fool.

115
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,320
Yu.

116
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,200
You must cheer up soon.

117
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,560
This is what Wei wants to see most.

118
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,640
The person I like

119
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,200
is you.

120
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
What a coincidence.

121
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,640
Me too.

122
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,280
Don't you wish

123
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,640
I'm a gentle girlfriend?

124
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,880
But I only like you.

125
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,160
I don't care
how they object to this relationship.

126
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,520
You are the same as other men to me.

127
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,400
You are boring.

128
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,240
My dear brother.

129
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,920
Let the past
become wonderful memories of ours.

130
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,280
It's fun to play a game with a playboy.

131
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,600
Please behave yourself.

132
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,640
Don't let make me
feel disgusted with you.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,960
If you still cling to me,

134
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,200
I will have no choice
but to call the police.

135
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,600
Her reaction was not right.

136
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,000
Senior,

137
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:14,000
are you looking for me?

138
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:16,720
Send it to the lab

139
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:18,360
and do a DNA comparison.

140
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:21,440
Senior...

141
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,360
Do the test as soon as possible.

142
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:23,960
Let me know the results immediately.

143
00:07:25,224 --> 00:07:25,664
Go.

144
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:26,960
Sure.

145
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,360
How are you?

146
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:43,960
Why do you still care about him

147
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:44,800
in your condition?

148
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,640
Tell me
if this incident has affected him.

149
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,560
Don't worry.

150
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:51,960
Bai Zhiyi spent a lot of money

151
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,720
to cover the news.

152
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,000
The rumours about you have calmed down.

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,000
That's great.

154
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,760
Tuan,

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,080
why are you here?

156
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,080
Didn't I ask you
to wait for me at the ward?

157
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,560
I want to see Mommy Xu
as soon as possible.

158
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,760
Tuan,

159
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,440
When you see Wei today,

160
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,080
you must not mention Dr. Bai.

161
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,120
Why?

162
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:16,880
Because Dr. Bai

163
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,360
made a huge mistake.

164
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,000
Wei will be unhappy if you mention him.

165
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,520
If Wei is unhappy,

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,920
she won't recover from her illness.

167
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,440
Tuan. Be nice, all right?

168
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,560
Let's go.

169
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,400
Let's go.

170
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:33,839
Mommy Xu!

171
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:36,440
Tuan, you're here?

172
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,600
Wei.

173
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,400
Mommy Xu, why are you sick as well?

174
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:45,960
I was ill because I didn't eat well.

175
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,240
That was why I was ill.

176
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,760
Are you eating well?

177
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,320
I'm eating very well

178
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,600
so I feel great.

179
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,560
Has her surgery been scheduled?

180
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,920
We are still waiting

181
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,400
for the heart donor's life
to come to an end.

182
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:04,960
Sometimes, an end
can also represent a new life.

183
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Wei,

184
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,680
Trust me.

185
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,040
Everything will be fine.

186
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,280
Tuan,

187
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,200
you must take care of yourself
before your surgery.

188
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,080
