Why are you here?

00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,720
You said you were tired

18
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,440
during dinner?

19
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,480
I'm

20
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,720
really tired.

21
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:25,600
I need to go to bed.

00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,640

We're at home.

25
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,280
Dad and Madam Yun might see us.

26
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:36,960
Why can't we just

27
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,360
tell them everything?

Even if we do,

to relationships,

Okay.

Did I upset you again?

71
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:08,440
I've asked Shasha to come back.

72
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,160
As soon as she arrives,

73
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:11,360
you two will get married.

74
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,320
I told you

75
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,680
I wouldn't marry Yun Shasha.

76
00:04:15,279 --> 00:04:16,719
This is between two families.

77
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:18,039
You can't refuse.

00:04:18,279 --> 00:04:19,160
Bai Zhiyi.

79
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,240
You sacrificed your marriage twice

80
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,120
for gaining interest.

81
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,560
I'm not like you.

82
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,560
I will only marry the woman I love.

83
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,040
I tell you what,

84

I'm going on a date with Xu Wei tonight.

85
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,240
Stop right there.

86
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,720
Unless you agree to marry Shasha,

87
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,920
you won't be able to see Wei again.

88
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,600
Will it be a last-minute surgery?

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,800
Why didn't he inform me?

90
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,880
If you come late again next time,

91
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,000
I won't forgive you.

92
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,960
Hi, Wei.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,760
Qiu Yu?

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,520
Wei.

95
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,800
It's late. Why are you sitting here?

96
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,080
I've been busy all-day

97
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:24,880
and haven't had time to eat.

98
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:27,960
Are you waiting for Dr. Bai?

99
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,360
There's nothing that can get past you.

100
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,320
By the way, what brings you here?

101
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,720
Maybe Heavens think you're lonely,

102
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,400
so I was sent here

103
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,280
to meet you.

104
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,600
If Heavens really exist,

105
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,200
I want to ask

106
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,040
where Bai Qingyu has gone.

107
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Wei.

108
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:55,040
I just came back from the hospital.

109
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,960
I'm starving.

110
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,160
All right. Let's eat together.

111
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,680
Bai Zhiyi!

112
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,360
When are you going to let me out?

113
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,640
Give me back my phone!

114
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,200
I want to make a call.

115
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,080
I won't run away.

116
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,880
Wei.

117
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,840
Were you distracted

118
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,760
the whole night

119
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,440
because you couldn't meet with Dr. Bai?

120
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,520
I'm a bit upset.

121
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:39,720
After all,

122
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,840
this is our first date.

123
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:44,760
I think

124
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,840
he doesn't care about you.

125
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,000
Nonsense.

126
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,440
You should know very well
about being a doctor.

127
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,520
Patients are your priority.

128
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,800
But to me,

129
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:00,320
you're always my top priority.

130
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,560
If I had a date with you,

131
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,640
I would never be late.

132
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,160
Wei.

133
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,440
How about

134
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:10,400
considering me?

135
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,600
Qiu Yu.

136
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,040
Stop making this kind of joke.

137
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,440
Or I'll beat you.

138
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,680
Let's go.

139
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
Come in.

140
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,840
Dad.

141
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,160
Yu didn't come back last night.

142
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,480
I couldn't reach him on the phone.

143
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,000
Have you seen him?

144
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,400
Don't need to look for him.

145
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,120
He likes hanging around outside.

146
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,720
Perhaps

147
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,720
he's seeing some girl.

148
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,080
Dad.

149
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,840
Yu isn't that kind of person.

150
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,640
You're biased against him.

151
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,040
I'm biased?

152
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,960
His fiancee is coming back soon.

153
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,840
But he never controls himself.

154
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,800
I should get going now.

155
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,600
Wei.

156
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,000
You're having a project meeting
the whole day, right?

157
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:05,600
Keep yourself together.

158
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,800
Don't get sidetracked.

159
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:11,440
I know.

160
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,320
Please hear me out, Senior.

161
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,440
Xie Zan.

162
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,520
Where's Qingyu?

163
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,400
He went on a date with you.

164
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
He didn't show up today.

165
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,600
He didn't answer my call.
I couldn't reach him.

166
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:24,880
Might something have happened to him?

167
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,920
Wei.

168
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,840
Qiu Yu, have you seen Yu?

169
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,920
Dr. Bai?

170
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,600
What has happened?

171
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,319
I couldn't reach him.

172
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,200
I want to go to the usual place he goes
to look for him.

173
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,000
Don't worry. Calm down.

174
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,720
Maybe his phone's out of juice.

175
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:45,320
We...

176
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:46,680
I will go with you.

177
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,560
Okay.

178
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,320
Excuse me, have you
seen Bai Qingyu today?

179
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:54,720
No.

180
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,200
Wei.

181
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,600
I have searched everywhere,
but I can't find him.

182
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,000
We went to so many places,
but there's no sign of him.

183
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,680
Where could he be?

184
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,680
Wei, don't worry too much.

185
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,000
Probably Dr. Bai has gone home by now.
