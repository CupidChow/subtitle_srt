1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,520
Hurry!

2
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:44,079
Hurry!

3
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,959
Mother!

4
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,400
Mother!

5
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,719
Honey!

6
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,519
Father!

7
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:33,959
Where exactly
is the Nine Yin True Sutra hidden?

8
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,120
If you don't speak up,

9
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,680
I'll kill your daughter!

10
00:01:51,599 --> 00:01:52,680
Father!

11
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,439
Father!

12
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,879
In this world now,

13
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,680
only my daughter...

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:03,439
Father!

15
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,200
Knows the whereabouts
of the Nine Yin True Sutra.

16
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,759
Do you dare kill her?

17
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,000
Father!

18
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,719
Father!

19
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,360
Mother!

20
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,280
Mother!

21
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,639
Father.

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,080
Mother.

23
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,759
Mother.

24
00:02:39,479 --> 00:02:41,159
Father.

25
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:44,879
Mother.

26
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:10,599
Let her go.

27
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,319
(Huang Yaoshi, Master of Taohua Island)
You may all leave.

28
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:16,159
I won't kill you.

29
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,879
We know we're no match for you,

30
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,240
but currently

31
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,039
only she knows

32
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,280
the Sutra's location.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,840
Either we share it,

34
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,800
or no one gets it!

35
00:03:55,712 --> 00:03:58,241

40
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,319
If you stop running,

41
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,040
I'll untie you.

42
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,319
S-Sir,

43
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,439
will you be dining

44
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,240
or s-staying

45
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:29,959
for the night?

46
00:07:31,519 --> 00:07:32,240
One room.

47
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,639
Bring some food too.

48
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,319
Follow me.

49
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,319
You may all leave.

50
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:00,800
I won't kill you.

51
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:03,600
Huang Yaoshi,

52
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:05,360
in the martial world,

53
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,680
anyone who got the Sutra

54
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:08,279
all met horrible ends.

55
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:10,199
Aren't you afraid?

56
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,639
If you're not scared,

57
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,160
why should I be?

58
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,160
If you persist,

59
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,399
we'll spread word

60
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,800
that Huang Yaoshi

61
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,720
possesses the Living Map to the Sutra

62
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:27,240
and heads to Taohua Island.

63
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,560
Not only will your journey be plagued

64
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,399
by trouble,

65
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:33,080
but hereafter, your Taohua Island

66
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,600
will likely...

67
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,279
Then let them all come.

68
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:55,960
Eat.

69
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,519
Who exactly are you?

70
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
I'm Huang Yaoshi.

71
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:06,559
Are you a physician?

72
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:08,559
In a way.

73
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,919
Is your martial prowess very high?

74
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,399
If later,

75
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:15,480
they break in here,

76
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,000
will you kill them?

77
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,000
Do you wish me to kill them?

78
00:09:22,759 --> 00:09:24,039
They murdered my parents.

79
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,240
Unless absolutely necessary,

80
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:51,960
I won't take lives.

81
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,360
But he will.

82
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,679
Who is he?

83
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,399
Take it.

84
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:05,360
Crouch.

85
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:06,919
Stay quiet.

86
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,120
I'll leave a crack

87
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,200
so you can breathe.

88
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:41,480
I've changed my mind.

89
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:44,200
Not leaving?

90
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,679
Then you'll all die.

91
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,200
You killed them all?

92
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,000
Why would you come to Shu?

93
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,440
Heard there were leads here.

94
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:39,840
So I came.

95
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,000
Aren't you afraid it's a wasted trip?

96
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:46,600
I've had many futile trips.

97
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:48,759
One more is nothing.

98
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,399
How did your father come to know

99
00:14:56,679 --> 00:14:58,120
the Nine Yin True Sutra's location?

100
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,000
It's a secret.

101
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,000
Mother!

102
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:23,359
What are you doing?

103
00:17:23,559 --> 00:17:24,079
Tying you up.

104
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,839
The one from last night came.

105
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,200
They've been stalking us?

106
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,720
At dusk they come, at dawn they go.

107
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:32,000
Come here.

108
00:17:32,319 --> 00:17:33,480
Your martial skills are good.

109
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:34,519
Why fear them?

110
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,640
I can't defeat them.

111
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,240
They're that formidable?

112
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:46,000
Take this.

113
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,160
What's this?

114
00:17:48,599 --> 00:17:49,559
Why are you tying me up?

115
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,759
If you can't win,

116
00:17:53,759 --> 00:17:54,359
we should hurry

117
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:55,160
and leave here.

118
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,119
By tying me here,

119
00:17:56,279 --> 00:17:57,480
are you using me as bait?

120
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,039
This is a Nine-Flower Dew Pill.

121
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:06,759
Keep it

122
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,079
under your tongue.

123
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:11,279
And this.

124
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:12,960
Throw this into the brazier

125
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,920
if danger arises.

126
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,880
It'll save your life.

127
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,000
Where's the Nine Yin True Sutra?

128
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,160
You arrived so late

129
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:35,319
and still expect to obtain the Sutra?

130
00:19:36,839 --> 00:19:37,960
Where is he?

131
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:02,160
Speak.

132
00:20:23,319 --> 00:20:24,079
Just go in.

133
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:29,079
Little wretch.

134
00:20:30,039 --> 00:20:31,119
You dare deceive me?

135
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:34,119
You open the door.

136
00:20:47,599 --> 00:20:48,759
Do you know what this is?

137
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,119
He said if I throw it

138
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:52,039
into the fire,

139
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,079
it'll stop you.

140
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,079
Where am I?

141
00:21:37,599 --> 00:21:38,640
Huang Yaoshi,

142
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:41,200
stop your charades.

143
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:34,279
Who are you?

144
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:35,640
Why do you keep following me?

145
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,319
I am you.

146
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,440
And you are me.

147
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,799
I'm your former self.

148
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:55,880
Have

149
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,319
you decided?

150
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,440
Listen to me.

151
00:23:10,519 --> 00:23:12,599
Go back to Jialan now.

152
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,839
I'll find a way

153
00:23:16,119 --> 00:23:17,400
to make her talk.

154
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:21,799
Your heart

155
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,119
has softened.

156
00:23:24,599 --> 00:23:26,720
But I won't show mercy.

157
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,720
Your words mean nothing.

158
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,559
Who are you really?

159
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:56,920
You're not Huang Yaoshi!

160
00:24:32,279 --> 00:24:33,759
(That's because)

161
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:37,240
(you've never met
the real Huang Yaoshi.)

162
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,480
I must find the Sutra

163
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:40,640
and bring it to Taohua Island.

164
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:56,960
You could flee.

165
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,119
Why didn't you?

166
00:27:04,839 --> 00:27:06,079
Thank you for avenging

167
00:27:06,079 --> 00:27:06,960
my parents.

168
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,720
The one who avenged them

169
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,119
wasn't me.

170
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:30,559
Why would so many people

171
00:27:30,599 --> 00:27:32,000
fight over the Nine Yin True Sutra?

172
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,680
Never mention that name again.

173
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:42,920
It will bring you

174
00:27:42,920 --> 00:27:43,960
deadly misfortune.

175
00:27:46,759 --> 00:27:47,920
They say that book contains

176
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,480
the world's most powerful

177
00:27:49,799 --> 00:27:50,759
martial arts.

178
00:27:52,359 --> 00:27:53,240
Whoever masters them

179
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,359
would become invincible

180
00:27:56,359 --> 00:27:57,400
and obtain

181
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,359
anything they desire.

182
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:03,240
So you want to conquer the world too?

183
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,440
They say within that book

184
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,000
there's a section

185
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,279
called Healing Chapter.

186
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:12,680
The methods there

187
00:28:13,839 --> 00:28:15,359
could save a dying patient's life.

188
00:28:15,799 --> 00:28:17,279
Is that patient you?

189
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,079
Her name is Feng Heng.

190
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:22,880
She's my wife.

191
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,160
What happened?

192
00:28:25,119 --> 00:28:26,079
She's been poisoned.

193
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
She's nearing death.

194
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,519
Can you help me?

195
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,119
Sometimes

196
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:41,640
poison

197
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,440
can be an antidote.

198
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,319
To save her,

199
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,359
I gave her a pill.

200
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,119
It revived her

201
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:57,559
from death's door

202
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:00,640
but only extended her life

203
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:01,440
for a few years.

204
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:06,640
She was poisoned,

205
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,799
and so was I.

206
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:15,519
My poison

207
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:17,839
is not lethal.

208
00:29:20,599 --> 00:29:22,200
But it'll stay with me for life.

209
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,960
(Later, I found a secluded place)

210
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,599
(cut off from the world.)

211
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:38,759
(I gave it my all
to find a cure for her poison.)

212
00:29:38,784 --> 00:29:40,480
(Feng Heng, Lady of Taohua Island)

213
00:29:49,160 --> 00:29:51,160
(I searched through countless texts)

214
00:29:52,119 --> 00:29:52,960
(and tried)

215
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:54,920
(every method, orthodox)

216
00:29:55,519 --> 00:29:56,160
(or not.)

217
00:29:58,079 --> 00:29:59,680
(I exhausted all possibilities.)

218
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,839
(Yet nothing worked.)

219
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:05,000
(I even tested medicine on myself)

220
00:30:06,359 --> 00:30:07,640
(but with little effect.)

221
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,119
(I could only watch helplessly)

222
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:13,839
(as she withered)

223
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,480
(day by day.)

224
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,079
(That feeling)

225
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:22,599
(was like)

226
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,839
(gripping sand)

227
00:30:26,839 --> 00:30:28,440
(with all your might.)

228
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:32,920
(The tighter the grip,
the faster it slips away.)

229
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,279
On Taohua Island,

230
00:30:51,599 --> 00:30:53,400
I tried planting peach trees in winter.

231
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,119
I watered and fertilized them daily,

232
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,759
hoping to see them

233
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,160
sprout buds

234
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,880
and grow tall.

235
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,279
But in the end,

236
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:09,599
I could only watch

237
00:31:10,319 --> 00:31:12,279
as they wilted day after day

238
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,359
and did nothing.

239
00:31:19,359 --> 00:31:20,359
So

240
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,160
the Nine Yin True Sutra

241
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,559
might hold her cure?

242
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:27,839
I heard

243
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:30,640
the Nine Yin True Sutra's

244
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,519
Healing Chapter

245
00:31:32,559 --> 00:31:33,519
could neutralize

246
00:31:34,759 --> 00:31:35,799
even the rarest poisons.

247
00:31:37,599 --> 00:31:39,640
Knowing her time was limited,

248
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,039
she must treasure

249
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,799
every remaining moment.

250
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,480
But you're busy with cultivation,

251
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:46,640
testing medicine,

252
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:47,960
seeking cures,

253
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:49,559
and running everywhere.

254
00:31:50,839 --> 00:31:52,400
You are desperately trying to save her

255
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
but never stayed to accompany her.

256
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,160
My parents dropped dead at my feet.

257
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,440
Their blood pooled around me.

258
00:32:05,799 --> 00:32:07,000
It happened just days ago.

259
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,200
If I'd known even one day earlier,

260
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:10,359
no,

261
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,079
if I'd known

262
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:13,400
even two hours earlier

263
00:32:14,599 --> 00:32:16,240
that death would separate us,

264
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,559
I could've looked at them

265
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:20,160
properly

266
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,759
one last time.

267
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:26,400
Don't grieve too hard.

268
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,720
No one can foresee fate.

269
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:35,200
If there's no cure at all,

270
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,400
maybe you should return

271
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:38,240
to Taohua Island soon

272
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,440
and cherish every moment you

273
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:41,359
still have with her.

274
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:01,319
Where are we going now?

275
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,160
To visit a friend.

276
00:33:08,599 --> 00:33:09,799
I received word

277
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:11,400
he's ill.

278
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:14,559
I need to check on him.

279
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,992
(Memorial)

280
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,440
My lord,

281
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,119
Huang Yaoshi requests an audience.

282
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:21,280
My lord, it's Huang Yaoshi.

283
00:34:36,128 --> 00:34:38,719
(Ouyang Cuo, Lord of Baituo Manor)

284
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:39,559
Mr. Huang,

285
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,599
thanks for coming.

286
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:44,480
I'm Feng's elder brother,

287
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,159
Ouyang Cuo.

288
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:48,840
How did

289
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:51,280
Mr. Ouyang die?

290
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:55,000
Western Regions' Ming Cult

291
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,480
are ruthless killers.

292
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,519
Our Baituo Manor

293
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,599
suffered under them for years,

294
00:35:02,559 --> 00:35:04,199
and we were forced to relocate here.

295
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:07,119
Feng grew desperate.

296
00:35:08,159 --> 00:35:10,119
He practiced forbidden techniques

297
00:35:11,039 --> 00:35:12,000
that ruined his health.

298
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:19,599
Would you

299
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,719
allow me to see him one last time?

300
00:35:30,039 --> 00:35:31,320
The coffin has been sealed.

301
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,360
The burial will occur at dawn tomorrow.

302
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,039
Mr. Huang, if you're sincere,

303
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,719
light incense for Feng.

304
00:36:18,239 --> 00:36:19,079
Mr. Ouyang,

305
00:36:21,159 --> 00:36:21,920
I never imagined

306
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,880
our last farewell would become eternal.

307
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:28,480
(The incense is toxic?)

308
00:36:49,079 --> 00:36:50,320
The departed has passed.

309
00:36:50,719 --> 00:36:51,840
Let's not disturb

310
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:52,760
his eternal rest.

311
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:12,079
It's getting dark. You should leave now.

312
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:14,840
Let's go.

313
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,000
We're leaving.

314
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,440
No, you'll kill me.

315
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,719
You won't come with me?

316
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,480
If I keep silent,

317
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:26,559
they won't dare harm me.

318
00:37:27,079 --> 00:37:28,119
But if you keep lingering,

319
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,239
we'll both die.

320
00:37:45,679 --> 00:37:47,480
I don't care what scheme you're brewing.

321
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,519
I'll return at dawn.

322
00:37:51,679 --> 00:37:52,360
If

323
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,880
a single hair on her is harmed,

324
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,039
I'll wipe out your entire

325
00:38:01,239 --> 00:38:02,679
Baituo Manor!

326
00:38:15,199 --> 00:38:17,639
Since he's so eager to meet Ouyang Feng,

327
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,679
throw him into the dungeon

328
00:38:21,199 --> 00:38:24,440
with my rebellious younger brother.
