23
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,510
Why are you bullying Zhen One Pot?

24
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:56,840
This is your dog?

25
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,680
My senior brother left it to me.

26
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:02,210
One Pot? Nice name.

27
00:02:03,010 --> 00:02:07,360
Wait till I cook it and see if it fills one pot.

28
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,140
- Give it to me.
- No!

29
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:14,810
No? Get him!

30
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,970
Now, you have nowhere to run, do you?

31
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:22,250
Don't come here!

32
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:25,030
Give it here! Hold him down!

33
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:26,710
Good dog, hurry and run!

34
00:02:26,710 --> 00:02:29,680
Go run home to find Mom!

00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,150
Let me go!

37
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,280
Go back home.

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,940
Thank you.

39
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,940
Little Boy, is your surname Zhen?

40
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,590
That's not my surname. You have the wrong person.

41
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,140
Why did I dream such an odd dream

42
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,610
even with A'Xu's Drunk Life Dream Death?

43
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,620
Stinking brat.

44
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,270
Uncle Wen, you woke up so early?

45
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,760
What time is it now?

46
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:39,410
I practiced the Eight Trigrams Palm fifty times.

47
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:42,170
It should be around six or seven in the morning by now.

48
00:03:42,170 --> 00:03:44,780
Why did you get up so early?

49
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,230
I woke up at the first rooster call

50
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,310
and then I couldn't fall asleep again no matter what, so I might as well have gotten up to practice martial arts.

51
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:51,270
What are you trying so hard for?

52
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,540
I always dream and can't fall asleep.

53
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:57,220
Whenever I think about how many evil things the Ghost Valley did

54
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,190
to destroy so many people's families like mine,

55
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:02,480
I can't eat or sleep.

56
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,360
I wish I could

57
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,570
obtain great martial arts skills like you and Master overnight

58
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,820
and destroy those bastards!

59
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:11,230
If Ghost Valley didn't exist,

60
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,280
so many of those tragic events would not have occurred.

61
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,850
Don't try to run before you can walk.

62
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:23,630
No matter how studious and hardworking you are, martial arts isn't something you can attain so quickly.

63
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:25,890
Your master has some sleep-aiding aromatics.

64
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,600
I'll have him light some for you in the evening.

65
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:32,730
You're currently at the body-growing stage. You have to get enough sleep.

66
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,280
The way you exert power is wrong.

67
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,120
How would your arms have power? The power from the Eight Trigrams Palm

68
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,570
emphasizes the deadly strength of the hip and qi energy.

69
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,330
This is also the key for most fighting skills.

70
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:56,810
Stinking brat, relax your shoulders, lower your elbow,

71
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,020
and strengthen your midsection.

72
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,160
Didn't someone say he was an outsider

73
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:04,440
and wouldn't teach my disciple?

74
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,300
Why do you care?

75
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,090
Master, I'll go get the door.

76
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,180
Who are you?

77
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:27,980
I am from the Peace Bank. I was asked by Sir Ye

78
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:30,920
to deliver a message to Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

79
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:40,820
Your Majesty, that damned collection of ghosts portraits has the likenesses of ghosts ranging from the Chief of Ghost Valley

80
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:43,870
to all of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts!

81
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:49,290
Everything from familial relations, martial arts techniques, and things we have done are all included!

82
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:53,800
How is this any different from stripping us naked out in public?

83
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,740
If these things are distributed among the martial arts world,

84
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:58,830
we will be unable to advance even a centimeter!

85
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,050
Wh-What ghost portraits?

86
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:05,730
Five Lakes Alliance has distributed the collection among every Sect.

87
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:08,670
How did that come to be?

88
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:14,140
How are we supposed to complete tasks for Alliance Leader Zhao with this happening?

89
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,730
I remember now.

90
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,860
Something like this indeed happened,

91
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,280
but so what?

92
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,000
Before you leave,

93
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,760
I can find you someone skilled in the art of disguise

94
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,330
and just change your faces. Wouldn't things be solved then?

95
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:35,410
Who knows? It might be easier on the eyes.

96
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:40,120
Happy!

97
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:44,470
Moveover, as minglers,

98
00:06:44,470 --> 00:06:47,990
isn't your goal to end up notorious?

99
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,860
Father's only helping you gain fame! Is that not wonderful?

100
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:53,390
You—

101
00:07:00,260 --> 00:07:04,500
When two strong sides make an alliance, we work together if we are compatible.

102
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:06,740
If we are not, then we go our separate ways.

103
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:10,370
If Alliance Leader Zhao uses such despicable tactics

104
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,950
to cut off our means of retreat,

105
00:07:12,950 --> 00:07:16,240
isn't that too lowly?

106
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:24,090
I've certainly learned something today.

107
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,500
You group of evil ghosts

108
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,310
still have the face to call others despicable and lowly?

109
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:32,330
It's absolutely outrageous!

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:39,130
All right. If it is like this,

111
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,820
we'll just leave.

112
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:46,280
This place does not welcome us, but there will naturally be others that do.

113
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:48,880
You dare?

114
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Why can't he dare? I think he spoke very well.

115
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:56,810
We work together when we get along, else we separate.

116
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:59,970
Since you no longer feel the same way as we do,

117
00:07:59,970 --> 00:08:05,070
what's the point in forcing you to stay?

118
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:06,730
Let's go!

119
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:11,430
Send them on their way!

120
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,440
My King,

121
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:21,700
what are you and Alliance Leader scheming again?

122
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,920
Speak with more respect.

123
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,760
Yes, yes, yes.

124
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:30,240
Right, My King. Liu Qianqiao's letter has already arrived.

125
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,410
It has to do with how to make Water of Oblivion.

126
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,130
Please take a look.

your page boy says your bank has my letter?

00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,410

132
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:06,570
Greetings, Lord Zhou.

133
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:10,630
Ping An, why have you come to Kunzhou?

134
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:12,930
Are you the one running this Peace Bank?
(T/N: "Ping An" means "Peace")

135
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,140
How could I have such abilities? Lord Zhou, please take a seat.

136
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:20,170
I only look after the fifty-six silver banks in the Central Plains for Lord Seventh.

137
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:23,850
Nanjiang also has four or five more establishments that Ruyi is looking after.

138
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:26,950
Peace Bank is all over the world.

139
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:28,770
Why did it never hit me that

140
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,200
it would be your lord's?

141
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,540
How could someone like him

142
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,240
do business related to money?

143
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:39,110
Perhaps you are unaware, but while our bank does deal with some money and business,

144
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:41,680
we're mostly collecting Central Plain information for Great Shaman.

145
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,210
The mechanical sparrows used to collect information are the ones you taught him how to make in the past.

146
00:09:45,210 --> 00:09:46,520
And thank goodness we have this treasure.

147
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:50,820
That was how I was able to hear that Lord Seventh was coming to Kunzhou and also how I came to know that I should come first.

148
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:52,770
Lord Seventh is coming to Kunzhou?

149
00:09:52,770 --> 00:09:54,250
Lord Zhou,

150
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,470
were you not the one who asked Sir Ye to greet Great Shaman?

151
00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:03,000
When Lord Seventh heard you were unwell, he decided to head to Kunzhou with Great Shaman.

152
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:06,040
Nonsense! How can he come to the Central Plains?

153
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,050
It's all right, all right. Lord Zhou,

154
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:11,130
Lord Seventh has Great Shaman and a bunch of guards with him. Besides,

155
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:13,440
Kunzhou is far from the emperor's capital.

156
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:16,800
Prince Jin will not be able to reach this place.

157
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,610
What do you mean? The person that Ye Baiyi went to invite... A'Xu, you also know him?

158
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:24,650
Not simply know! It's a lifelong friendship!

159
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:26,630
Lord Zhou, you're really something.

160
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,810
It's been so many years, but you didn't send Our Lord any letters.

161
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:33,840
Now that something has come up, why is there the need to ask an outsider to inform us?

162
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:38,580
Why don't you go to Nanjiang yourself? Our Lord has missed you greatly all these years.

163
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,470
Right. This is Sir Ye's letter.

164
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,150
[You bastard.]

165
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:52,960
What is Elder Ye upset about this time?

166
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,580
Why did he write a letter just to curse at you?

167
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:05,390
We'll meet on Winter Solstice. I want to eat dumplings. Cabbage and pork filling.

168
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,960
What's the meaning of this letter?

169
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:14,120
Lord Seventh and Great Shaman were preparing some precious medical materials in the southern territory.

170
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,290
Sir Ye couldn't wait any longer, so he came back first.

171
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:20,940
Therefore, he sent the letter by dispatching through the southern branch.

172
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:24,370
Thank you for your hard work, Ping An.

173
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,840
Master, who are Great Shaman and Lord Seventh?

174
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:40,900
So, Elder Ye invited those two to heal your injuries?

175
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:43,080
What do you mean, he invited them?

176
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,910
If I knew Elder Ye's old friend was Great Shaman,

177
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,460
would I need him to invite them?

178
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:52,870
You still haven't said who these two people really are.

179
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:56,130
These two are old acquaintances of mine in Jinzhou.

180
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:00,350
We all worked for Prince Jin but were completely let down by him later.

181
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:04,250
They left for Nanjiang and never came back.

182
00:12:05,780 --> 00:12:10,240
Then these two... can really heal your injuries?

183
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,160
Great Shaman is skilled in medicines

184
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,650
and knows a lot of southern territory's secret witchcraft.

185
00:12:16,650 --> 00:12:20,450
Lord Seventh usually only moves after devising a plan. If they decide to come to the Central Plains,

186
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:23,350
I'm sure they have some confidence.

187
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,930
Then isn't that good news?

188
00:12:24,930 --> 00:12:29,510
Since you're old acquaintances, why didn't we go searching for them earlier?

189
00:12:30,270 --> 00:12:35,010
Earlier? I didn't want to live.

190
00:12:37,690 --> 00:12:41,160
Master, why did Elder Ye scold you in the letter?

191
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:44,490
Silly Brat, you still don't understand?

192
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:47,680
That old monster went far to the southern territory to find a doctor.

193
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,270
After meeting Great Shaman, he found out that the strange person he wouldn't have been able to invite by himself no matter what

194
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:55,150
actually owes your master a favor.

195
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,150
The great Changming Mountain Sword Immortal Elder

196
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,640
turned into a mail courier instead.

197
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:02,580
Given Old Monster's personality, it would be odd if he wasn't angry enough to cough blood.

198
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:05,360
Calling him a bastard is already very light.

199
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,400
So what? In the end, Elder Ye was still able to invite this Great Shaman.

200
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,510
Doesn't matter whose influence it was.

201
00:13:10,510 --> 00:13:12,800
As long as he can cure Master's injury, it is a huge blessing.

202
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,920
Right, Junior Master?

203
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,310
Madam, do you have any other colors in your stall?

204
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:22,870
Here.

205
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:25,920
- Look at this one. This one is really nice.
- I think this one...

206
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,210
- doesn't really suit me. Do you have others?
- A'Xu, it's rare for us to come down the mountain.

207
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:31,570
- I have to go look around nearby and see if there's a painter to do the repair work.
- I'll find you more.

208
00:13:31,570 --> 00:13:33,130
- Why don't you and Chengling go back first?
 - Thank you.

209
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,310
- Okay. Come back soon.
- No problem. Take care.

210
00:13:35,310 --> 00:13:38,090
Otherwise, there will be no one to cook dinner.

211
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,880
Bullshit! Have I become a servant?

212
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,710
What? Aren't you one?

213
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,270
Chengling, let's rest a little more, and then we'll go.

214
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:06,110
Valley Chief has come!

215
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:09,710
Valley Chief has come! I found Chief!

216
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:15,430
Valley Chief has come! I found Chief!

217
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,820
I found Chief!

218
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,500
Valley Chief!

219
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,960
Valley Chief!

220
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:27,440
- Valley Chief!
- Valley Chief!

221
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,780
Valley Chief! Thank goodness we've found you.

222
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,140
Do you know how we've survived these days?

223
00:14:39,140 --> 00:14:41,000
We are like mice on the streets!

224
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:43,930
As soon as we show our faces, we get beat up.

225
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,580
Give me the Ghost Portrait Collection.

226
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:48,130
What?

227
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,500
[Ghost Portrait Collection]

228
00:14:58,700 --> 00:15:01,210
Right now, any known sect

229
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:03,880
has a copy of this damned collection.

230
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:07,980
Damn it. The whole martial arts world has turned everything upside down.

231
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:12,210
They've upturned all the ghosts scattered in every corner.

232
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:17,240
It was luck that made me able to save these girls and guys.

233
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,140
We've been hiding in this desolate place the whole time,

234
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:23,910
while looking for your whereabouts, Chief.

235
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:26,440
I've almost been fucking starved skinny!

236
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:29,100
If it hadn't been for Miss Xiang, who took Yun Zai under her care,

237
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:31,160
and the fact that she's still clean

238
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,830
and can still walk around outside,

239
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:35,780
I wouldn't have been able to see you!

240
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:39,780
How many are left amongst the Top Ten Evil Ghosts?

241
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,430
Chief, you don't know?

242
00:15:50,430 --> 00:15:52,980
All these days I've been hearing about this sect killing that sect

243
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:56,460
and that sect killing this sect all because of Ghost Valley.

244
00:15:56,460 --> 00:16:00,160
I-I thought you, Chief, led the Top Ten Evil Ghosts in doing that.

245
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:01,740
But it wasn't you?

246
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,710
Is there any news on the Owner of the List of the Unfaithful?

247
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,620
N... No.

248
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,480
Ever since that whatever Dog Bear Conference in Yueyang or whatever,

249
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,260
and Tragicomic Ghost was kidnapped,

250
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:13,850
there has never been any more information about her or Alluring Ghost.

251
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:18,230
Right, Chief. I heard right now that those righteous dogs

252
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:21,840
are currently discussing the plan of holding another Dog Bear Conference or whatever.

253
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:27,920
Damn, when there isn't a tiger in the mountain, even a bear will be king.

254
00:16:28,650 --> 00:16:31,100
Luckily, you've appeared.

255
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,210
We must return to that Ghost Valley immediately and create defenses.

256
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:36,960
Let's fight those fucking bastards!

257
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:41,660
- Kill them all!
- Kill them all!

258
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:02,310
Junior Master!

259
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,370
What's the matter?

260
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,390
Junior Master, you've finally come back.

261
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:07,830
I'm so hungry that my stomach is rumbling.

262
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:10,170
If I didn't come back, you'd just wait?

263
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,900
You can't randomly get a bowl of noodles to eat?

264
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,920
We can't.

265
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:20,140
How did it go? Did you find a painter?

266
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,410
I didn't find any at the foot of the mountain.

267
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:24,920
Clear Water Village has a painter that just returned from Chang'an.

268
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:28,080
I'll bring the painting to him for observation in a few days.

269
00:17:28,080 --> 00:17:31,360
A'Xu, how about I teach you how to cook?

270
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,780
That day, I'm sure I won't be able to cook in time.

271
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:36,340
I'm not learning.

272
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:40,170
A saint once said, "A nobleman should stay away from the kitchen".
(T/N: Mencius' words)

273
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,680
Rest assured.

274
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,510
The two of us definitely won't go hungry.

275
00:17:44,510 --> 00:17:48,550
If we really get hungry, I'll take Chengling down the mountain to eat.

276
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:52,330
- All right.
- Call me when the food is ready.

277
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:56,080
Fine, Master Zhou. You rest well.

278
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,270
Junior Master, is something wrong?

279
00:18:16,900 --> 00:18:20,390
Nothing. It's about to get dark.

280
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:26,280
"The sunset is lovely, but the dusk is near."

281
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:30,510
Chengling, what do you want to eat tonight?

282
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:32,700
Uncle Wen will make it for you.

283
00:18:47,930 --> 00:18:50,120
Greetings, Your Majesty.

284
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:54,280
Didn't I order someone to tell you how to dispel the poison?

285
00:18:54,280 --> 00:18:56,160
What are you doing back here?

286
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,630
I... changed my mind.

287
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:03,450
It is my honor if Your Majesty finds use in me.

288
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:07,020
I am willing to serve your orders.

289
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,910
As long as...

290
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:19,750
As long as you are willing to let my master, Tragicomic Ghost, go. And—

291
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:22,040
And Yu Qiufeng?

292
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:25,730
Your Majesty, I beg you.

293
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:27,430
Enough.

294
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,450
I don't like listening to useless words.

295
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:39,150
How dare you ask for favors without any achievements?

296
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:44,290
I can... promise to not kill these two people.

297
00:19:44,290 --> 00:19:48,710
However, I can't release them just because you asked.

298
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:55,140
Of course, if you can prove that you are useful to me,

299
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:58,530
I won't let down those who are loyal to me.

300
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,730
You may rise.

301
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

302
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:11,230
However, if you didn't give me that formula,

303
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:15,830
I would not have guessed that Water of Oblivion was made from daylilies.
(T/N: The literal translation of "daylilies" is "Forget worry grass")

304
00:20:16,610 --> 00:20:19,660
Your Majesty, you mean...

305
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,720
Have you ever heard of

306
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:25,060
something called Drunk Life Dream Death?

307
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,950
Kunzhou has a plant called Nepenthes.

308
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:38,210
Nepenthes mixed with seven types of poisonous insects form Water of Oblivion,

309
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,900
which makes people forget what they care most about.

310
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:44,780
And mixed with seven flowers...

311
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,830
is Drunk Life Dream Death.

312
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:56,190
The two are like sides of a coin, they reinforce yet counteract one another.

313
00:20:56,190 --> 00:21:00,720
Using large amounts of Drunk Life Dream Death can dispel the effects of Water of Oblivion

314
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:04,590
and reveal forgotten memories.

315
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,590
Your Majesty, you are going to...

316
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,140
Tragicomic Ghost lacks a complete mind right now.

317
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:16,580
To prevent damage to her brain from large doses of medicine,

318
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:19,090
I've used the aromatics method,

319
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:22,500
letting the medicine enter her body slowly

320
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,890
to reach the specific level.

321
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,570
You came just in time. She's already been in the medical room for seven days.

322
00:21:30,570 --> 00:21:34,380
I suppose it's time to wake up.

323
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:39,260
I will soon know the truth.

324
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:45,050
All those sayings out there are just rumors.

325
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:47,250
Father wouldn't lie to me.

326
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,510
Yes.

327
00:21:48,510 --> 00:21:52,450
After Tragicomic Ghost awakens and speaks the truth, I will be able to return his innocence.

328
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:56,980
I'm doing this just to prove my father's innocence.

329
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,460
Your Gentle Wind Sword Sect...

330
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:13,300
what kind of desolate place is it built on?
(T/N: "Desolate place"'s literal translation is "place where birds don't poop")

331
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,000
You people are so smart!

332
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:20,200
If I were a thief, even if there was a gold mountain up ahead, I would be too lazy to check it out.

333
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,000
A'Xiang, don't speak nonsense.

334
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,800
Who is the big-talker saying

335
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:32,400
our Gentle Wind Mountain is a place where birds don't poop?

336
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:33,900
Little brat.

337
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,400
Junior Master!

338
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,800
Stinking brat.

339
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Junior Master! Junior Master!

340
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,030
Senior Brother, you are here!

341
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,500
I've finally seen you! I've missed you all so much!

342
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:48,600
You are finally back.

343
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:51,400
Good thing you are in time for the new year.

344
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
How is everything on the mountain?

345
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:56,200
Master, are you healthy? Has everyone missed me?

346
00:22:57,800 --> 00:23:00,000
Let me ask you, and tell me the truth.

347
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:03,200
From where did you kidnap this young girl?

348
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,000
- I—
- Ah,

349
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,600
my name is Gu Xiang. Hello.

350
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:09,000
A'Xiang!

351
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:12,400
Hello, I am Mo Weixu, Cao Weining's senior brother.

352
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,800
This is our sect's Fan Huaikong, Elder Fan.

353
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:18,200
You can follow Weining in calling him Junior Master Fan.

354
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:20,200
Junior Master Fan!

355
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,200
Hello, Junior Master Fan!

356
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:31,200
Senior Brother Mo, hello!

357
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,200
Hello to everyone!

358
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:35,000
Greetings, Miss A'Xiang.

359
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:39,600
I'm asking you! Where did you kidnap this girl from? She seems stupid.

360
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:40,800
I'm not stupid!

361
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:42,800
You are not stupid?

362
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,200
How could you get kidnapped by my stupid nephew if you aren't stupid?

363
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,100
He's saying you're the stupid one!

364
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:51,200
- Me?
- Senior Brother Cao! Senior Brother Cao!

365
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,000
Is this the wife you were referring to in your letter?

366
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,200
- You sure are good! How capable!
- I'm not!

367
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,200
Cao Weining, what did you tell them?

368
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,800
- I didn't say anything—
- Hey, hey, hey!

369
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,000
This little wife's pretty fierce, isn't she?

370
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,400
Weining, you have quite a lot of suffering to look forward to.

371
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:09,300
All right, Junior Master, stop joking with them. They are too thin-skinned.

372
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:13,200
Miss Xiang, don't worry about it. We are used to joking around like this.

373
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,600
Girl, I was joking with you earlier.

374
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,600
Weining praised you incredibly highly in his letters.

375
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,800
We knew since morning that you would arrive,

376
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:28,900
so we cleaned a little yard out for you to live in on the hillside.

377
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:33,400
Junior Master, A'Xiang can't live with me on the mountain?

378
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:37,400
Young Lady, our sect leader has just ordered for the mountain's route to be sealed.

379
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:41,400
We don't accept outsiders, so we have come down specifically to meet you two.

380
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,400
Sealed?

381
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,400
Junior Master, is it because—

382
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,000
Young Lady, let's go look at the little yard and see if you like it.

383
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,800
Let's go.

384
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,200
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

385
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,700
Let's go!

386
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,630
This time, Eagle Claw Gang and Mount Hua Sect

387
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:02,200
will be left to you, Old Sha.

388
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,400
Got it!

389
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,800
If this time, the Water Transport Gang...

390
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,800
Sect Leaders, let's end it here today.

391
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:17,600
Thank you for your hard work.

392
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,500
We will take our leave.

393
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:23,220
[Great Ambitions]

394
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,000
How many times have I told you?

395
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:39,200
- If you have no business, don't come to the front hall!
- What are you afraid of?

396
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:42,500
It's not like those follower dogs aren't aware of my existence.

397
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,600
Are you scared they'll bark to others?

398
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,700
- It's better to have fewer things to worry about.
- Father.

399
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:50,200
When your power was still unstable,

400
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,200
I understand that you did not want others to know about your relationship with the Venomous Scorpions.

401
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,400
Now, you possess great power already.

402
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:59,700
Why are you still unwilling to let me stand beside you?

403
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:02,800
Nothing is settled yet! There are still uncertainties!

404
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:05,000
Then, when do things count as settled?

405
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:07,400
You can use these bullshit words

406
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,100
to trick those Ghost Valley idiots.

407
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:13,300
Using them to brush me off

408
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:16,440
is a disrespect.

409
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:26,400
Scorpion, what's with you today?

410
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:30,600
Did... you hear something?

411
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:33,710
Or did I do something wrong?

412
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:45,140
Scorpion, I know.

413
00:26:46,050 --> 00:26:49,100
In the past, I couldn't do anything under the circumstances.

414
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:52,400
I could only have you support me in the dark.

415
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,700
I have wronged you.

416
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,500
But I never thought

417
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,800
my Scorpion was so capable.

418
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,600
You were unexpectedly able

419
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:08,000
to make the Venomous Scorpions an assassin organization on the same level as Window of Heaven.

420
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,100
I'm so happy.

421
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,990
So,

422
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:18,640
I feel more and more sorry towards you.

423
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,200
I have worked so hard in my position, cautiously

424
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,000
planning our great undertaking.

425
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,400
I have no sons or daughters.

426
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,200
I only have you, the closest person to me.

427
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,510
Aside from you, who else can I

428
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,200
entrust my achievements to?

429
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
In the future,

430
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,200
you can lose your temper or be wayward.

431
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:03,200
and I will bear it. Please don't ever coldly

432
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,800
say things that will make me sad,

433
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,410
okay?

434
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,900
Father,

435
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,670
why did you lie to me?

436
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,000
How have I lied to you?

437
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:33,100
What is "If My Lord does not betray me,

438
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,250
I will not betray My Lord?"

439
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:43,070
[If My Lord does not betray me, I will not betray My Lord]

440
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:47,800
Where did... you get this?

441
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:53,000
Yu Qiufeng had someone send this to me.

442
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,610
Father,

443
00:28:55,750 --> 00:28:58,420
is this your handwriting?

444
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:03,000
Yu Qiufeng...

445
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,230
he's trying to force me into a corner.

446
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:15,000
Here, eat lots.

447
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,400
- Thank you, Senior Brother.
- Thank you.

448
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,000
- Here.
- Thank you.

449
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,200
Eat some more, all right?

450
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,100
You must be exhausted coming all this way.

451
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:27,100
Don't restrain yourself. Treat this place as your home.

452
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,400
Right, don't restrain yourself!

453
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:32,860
Girl, you seem to have learned martial arts,

454
00:29:32,860 --> 00:29:34,800
just like the girls and boys in our martial arts world.

455
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:38,600
From which clan or sect are you a noble disciple of?

456
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:42,400
I'm not a disciple. I'm just someone's maid.

457
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,400
It's just that my master taught me some basic martial arts, that's all.

458
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:48,000
A'Xiang, don't be so modest.

459
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,000
- Junior Master, A'Xiang's Master is—
- Hey!

460
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,200
- Eat some more!
- Okay!

461
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,300
I'll eat.

462
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,730
I'm sorry, Junior Master. My master

463
00:29:56,730 --> 00:30:00,700
is a reclusive elder master. He has an odd temper

464
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:03,600
and does not want me to reveal his name.

465
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:08,500
Junior Master, all extraordinarily talented people in the martial arts world have their own uniqueness. It's quite common, right?

466
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:10,100
Right.

467
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:14,780
Do you have anyone else in your family?

468
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,500
Not anymore.

469
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:22,000
I'm an orphan. I was picked up and raised by Master,

470
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,200
but he doesn't want me anymore.

471
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,000
It's all right. It's all right.

472
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,800
You and our Weining both are both without parents

473
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:33,000
and are children with hard lives.

474
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:35,600
It's all right. Before, you both did not have family,

475
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:40,700
but in the future, you will be able to live devotedly to each other.

476
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,400
It's just that the timing is bad.

477
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,000
if the mountain hadn't had to be sealed, I could choose a lucky day for you two

478
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:49,000
after the New Year

479
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:52,000
and complete your marriage.

480
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Junior Master, why did we seal the mountain?

481
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:00,600
Let's eat first. Eat first.

482
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:02,400
A'Xiang, eat more.

483
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,400
Right, eat, eat.

484
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,800
I indeed had a history with Tragicomic Ghost, Luo Fumeng.

485
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,900
At the time, she was the Young Princess of Neon Palace.

486
00:31:17,900 --> 00:31:19,750
But I was the poor son

487
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:23,000
of the Zhao family's declining side branch.

488
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:26,600
Of course, her family refused to marry her down to me.

489
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:29,500
They locked her up.

490
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,500
This blood letter...

491
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:34,000
At that time,

492
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,300
she sent someone to give it to me.

493
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:40,030
To express her attitude.

494
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:43,900
You two...

495
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,500
once loved each other?

496
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:52,000
Then, why did you betray her?

497
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:55,100
It was all because of that wench Li Yao.

498
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:57,300
Mother?
(T/N: "Adopted mother")

499
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,840
I have told you to not call her that!

500
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:02,600
She's just a wench!

501
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,160
You don't know what she's done to me!

502
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,090
[Great Ambitions]

503
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,000
At the time, I held tender feelings for Li Yao since she was a proper, unmarried lady from a great family

504
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:17,500
who loved me with everything she had.

505
00:32:17,500 --> 00:32:21,600
I am to blame for not ending her love for me in time

506
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,200
which led to

507
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,800
when Fu Meng and I

508
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:30,000
were about to break through all obstacles and marry successfully,

509
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:35,400
she used the fact that I participated in stealing for the World's Armory

510
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,800
to threaten me.

511
00:32:37,800 --> 00:32:42,300
She forced me to follow and marry her, instead.

512
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,900
Scorpion,

513
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:50,400
if stealing for the World's Armory were solely my own actions,

514
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:53,400
I would absolutely have fought against her at all costs,

515
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:55,600
but this was a very important matter.

516
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:58,600
I couldn't drag down my other brothers.

517
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:03,000
Therefore, I endured this humiliation

518
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:05,600
and married into her family.

519
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:10,000
Did you know? On the day of your marriage,

520
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,210
Luo Fumeng went crazy and massacred everyone in Neon Palace?

521
00:33:16,600 --> 00:33:18,100
Do you know why

522
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:22,100
the martial arts world never had news about Luo Fumeng anymore?

523
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:26,400
It's because I went through so much difficulty and found the crazy woman she had become

524
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:30,800
and sent her to receive treatment secretly at Miracle Healer Valley.

525
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:37,400
But when I was trying to subdue her, I was injured badly by her unique martial arts.

526
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:41,000
Since then my martial arts never improved.

527
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:44,400
I ruined her life.

528
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,600
If it weren't for me,

529
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:48,400
she would not have

530
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:51,600
fallen to such a not completely human, not completely ghost state.

531
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:56,330
Scorpion...

532
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:03,770
This is the most painful thing in my life.

533
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,280
The greatest humiliation of my life.

534
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:15,820
I was going to take all this to the grave,

535
00:34:15,820 --> 00:34:18,410
but since you wanted to know,

536
00:34:20,550 --> 00:34:23,050
I'll tell you.

537
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:28,160
There is another reason I didn't tell you before.

538
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:32,280
I'm also the one who killed Li Yao.

539
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,470
As I thought.

540
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:44,550
The timid Zhao Jing from the past who placed importance on friendship and justice has already died.

541
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:49,080
The one before you now is a Zhao Jing who can

542
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:53,670
personally kill his wife, plot his brothers' deaths,

543
00:34:53,670 --> 00:34:59,090
bring calamity to the martial arts world, and commit great evils.

544
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:02,550
When the world betrays me,

545
00:35:02,550 --> 00:35:05,760
I must betray the world.

546
00:35:08,140 --> 00:35:10,740
But only towards you,

547
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,160
my Scorpion.

548
00:35:17,330 --> 00:35:20,760
Nine parts of my heart may be dead,

549
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:25,370
but even if there is one kind of thought left,

550
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:28,000
one bit of affection,

551
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,520
I'll leave it all for you.

552
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:36,030
This is the last clean spot of my life.

553
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,730
Promise me.

554
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:41,990
Protect it well.

555
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,980
Don't desert it.

556
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,540
Father!

557
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,460
I was wrong.

558
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:56,750
I should not have questioned you this way. I won't question you again.

559
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:00,320
Scorpion...

560
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:05,680
You must know that I only have you.

561
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,750
And you only have me.

562
00:36:18,210 --> 00:36:22,670
If My Lord does not betray me, I will not betray My Lord.

563
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:28,390
If My Lord does not betray me, I will not betray My Lord.

564
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,810
Master.

565
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:45,980
Stop calling me.

566
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:49,330
Don't you have a new master now?

567
00:36:53,640 --> 00:36:56,310
Well?

568
00:36:56,310 --> 00:36:59,340
Did you get the answer you wanted?

569
00:37:00,180 --> 00:37:02,010
He said

570
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:06,880
that his wife, Li Yao, threatened him with the secret of the armory.

571
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:14,040
I never would have thought

572
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:18,070
that Zhao Jing's ability to improvise was still so astounding.

573
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:24,040
My father was clearly the one who forced him first. Why would he blame it on Li Yao?

574
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:27,080
Because he killed Li Yao after that.

575
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,060
Li Yao was just a brainless idiot of a woman.

576
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:42,000
Although she and I fought over him,

577
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,620
I never hated her.

578
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,640
If I had really married Zhao Jing instead,

579
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:58,500
the bones laying in the underworld today would likely belong to me.

580
00:37:59,690 --> 00:38:02,180
First, you toyed with me,

581
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:05,880
then you tossed me away.

582
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:09,360
I gave everything for Zhao Jing,

583
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,520
but I never thought

584
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:16,380
he would switch to Li Yao's as a more lucrative target.

585
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:22,050
My father watched me weep for Zhao Jing every day,

586
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:24,880
and his heart ached uncontrollably for me.

587
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,620
So he used the secret of the armory to threaten him

588
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:30,770
and used the position of Neon Palace Master to entice him.

589
00:38:30,770 --> 00:38:34,500
Only this way was Zhao Jing forced to marry me.

590
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:37,260
However, I never thought

591
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:41,720
that he would be so cruel as to secretly collude with traitors in the palace.

592
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:47,150
Blood washed over Neon Palace on that wedding day.

593
00:38:47,150 --> 00:38:51,240
Master, it wasn't you?

594
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,990
The past cannot be pursued.

595
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,880
Neither of you has proof of what you say.

596
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:02,990
If he truly is as cold-blooded as you say, why would he let you live?

597
00:39:02,990 --> 00:39:08,160
Moreover, why would he keep your blood-written letter as a treasure?

598
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:15,150
You really... You really have an overly shallow understanding of Zhao Jing.

599
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:17,870
Do you know that in Zhao Jing's life,

600
00:39:17,870 --> 00:39:21,350
what delights him the most is his ability to manipulate others

601
00:39:21,350 --> 00:39:24,690
and devise schemes to gain power?

602
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:27,620
For every great plot of his,

603
00:39:27,620 --> 00:39:29,880
he will save for himself a trophy.

604
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:35,000
Some examples I can think of are his master's thumb ring

605
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,850
and the poisoned sword that killed Rong Xuan.

606
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:42,540
If you don't believe me, you can look for yourself.

607
00:39:44,010 --> 00:39:45,990
There should...

608
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:50,980
also be a keepsake of that idiotic woman Li Yao.

609
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,280
Most likely an item symbolizing their commitment to each other.

610
00:39:56,850 --> 00:40:01,350
If my suspicions are correct, Zhao Jing

611
00:40:01,350 --> 00:40:05,360
should also have given you a very special memento

612
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:09,430
as a representation of his sincerity. Isn't that so?

613
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,810
Junior Uncle, it will be the Winter Solstice Festival tomorrow. Elder Ye will be on time, right?

614
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:32,800
That's right. It's the Winter Solstice Festival tomorrow.

615
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:37,560
Then will we be making dumplings? Didn't Elder Ye say he wanted ones stuffed with pork and cabbage?

616
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,560
Good for nothing, all you know is to eat.

617
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,280
That's what Elder Ye said in his letter.

618
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,690
Besides, I'm practicing hard every day, and you won't let me eat.

619
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:48,280
This little brat dares talk back to me?

620
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,850
You don't learn good skills, you only learn this?

621
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,910
All right. I'll buy the ingredients tomorrow.

622
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:55,770
What would you like to eat besides dumplings?

623
00:40:55,770 --> 00:40:59,490
What? You're not going to mouth off at him this time?

624
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:01,220
That old monster has a bunch of years on him.

625
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:04,260
He's running all over the place for us after all. It's a difficult task.

626
00:41:04,260 --> 00:41:06,960
It is only a simple food request, I may as well satisfy him.

627
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:11,620
That is reasonable, but given Elder Ye's appetite,

628
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:15,220
our cooking talent had better prepare many times the amount.

629
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:18,110
The wine down the mountain isn't adequate either. How about this?

630
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:21,250
Old Wen, take a cart to Clear Water Town.

631
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:23,200
Buy some good wine and vegetables.

632
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:25,310
All right! Uncle Wen, I'll go with you!

633
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:26,720
Where do you think you're going?

634
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:30,890
A trip there and back will take a whole day. Where do you think you're going? Stay and practice!

635
00:41:30,890 --> 00:41:34,050
Not true. I never slack off.

636
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:37,340
You're still talking back! Go to bed!

637
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:40,600
Old Wen, get some rest now.

638
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:43,630
How about we chat a bit longer?

639
00:41:44,550 --> 00:41:46,600
Have a drink?

640
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,700
Not for me. There's a big battle waiting for us in a few days.

641
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:55,520
This time, I'm going to have to conserve my energy.

642
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:59,090
Right. Then go ahead and get some rest.

643
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,360
Let's go, Chengling.

644
00:42:06,630 --> 00:42:08,160
I'm off!

645
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:26,730
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

646
00:43:28,110 --> 00:43:34,240
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

647
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:42,380
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

648
00:43:42,380 --> 00:43:49,360
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

649
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:57,910
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

650
00:43:57,910 --> 00:44:05,410
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

651
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:12,860
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river
But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

652
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:20,730
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

653
00:44:20,730 --> 00:44:27,950
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late
Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

654
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:35,860
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

655
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:43,170
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills
The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

656
00:44:43,170 --> 00:44:50,150
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

657
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:57,430
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
