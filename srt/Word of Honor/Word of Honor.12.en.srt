[Episode 12]

23
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,000
Have a drink?

24
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,000
Of course. Why not?

25
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,500
Save me some!

26
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,000
Good wine.

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,800
Three-year-old Wen.

28
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:41,400
Master Zhou, congratulations on receiving a beloved disciple.

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,400
Do you know why I accepted Chengling as my disciple?

30
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,300
No.

31
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,000
Quickly, tell me why.

32
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,300
This child is stupid, and his foundation is not good,

33
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,600
and he has exceeded the ideal age to start practicing martial arts.

34
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,200
Why do you care so much about him?

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,700
As a child,

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,900
my master once advised me of this.

37
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,800
The two rarest qualities found in a person are benevolence and courage.

38
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,400
The ancient sages classified courageous people into these types:

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,300
courageous in energy, blood, backbone, and spirit.

40
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,400
They are all factors of the courage of youth.

41
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,100
My master promoted the courage of solidarity.

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,800
What does it mean?

43
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:24,500
To do something even while knowing it's not allowed,

44
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,500
and to trust people even when knowing that their motives are hard to guess.

45
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,300
Old Wen,

46
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:36,100
for people of our age to reveal our hearts to others is difficult.

47
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,800
I personally am unable to do it,

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,800
and I am unable to request it of you.

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,400
That's why I decided to take a step out first.

50
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,900
I want to take a gamble.

51
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,600
You are...

52
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:54,400
the one that I know.

53
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,600
That damned nasty woman hit me so fiercely.

54
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,200
I will kill her next time I see her.

55
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,400
It hurts so much.

56
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,800
You— What are you doing here?

57
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,200
A'Xiang, what's wrong with your arm?

58
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,000
Not only that, your complexion is horrible.

59
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,500
A'Xiang, where did you go last night?

60
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:56,600
The assassins sneaked into Yueyang Sect and kidnapped Chengling.

61
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
What do you mean, "Where did I go last night"?

62
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,400
You... weren't in the house last night, were you?

63
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
How... How do you know that?

64
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
Did you see it?

65
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,800
But you really were not in the house.

66
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,600
Last night, I heard that the assassins sneaked into the Yueyang Sect

67
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,900
and triggered a full-scale manhunt.

68
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,600
I was worried that you might feel scared, so I came to your pavilion to see you.

69
00:05:17,740 --> 00:05:18,900
Who told you to come to me?

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:20,900
It was the middle of the night, did anyone see you?

71
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,400
N-No.

72
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Rest assured.

73
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,200
I certainly know that women's reputations are precious.

74
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:27,300
I came here quietly.

75
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,200
All of them were looking for the assassins.

76
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,400
So don't worry, nobody knows I'm here.

77
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:35,100
Did you also go out to find Chengling, A'Xiang?

78
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,400
That's so dangerous!

79
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,600
It would've been just fine to leave it to us. You're just a girl.

80
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:40,100
I know.

81
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,100
Leave here now. I'll talk to you later.

82
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,200
Well, A'Xiang, don't worry. Chengling will be fine.

83
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,600
Hurry up and go! Otherwise, people will see us

84
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,800
standing together early in the morning.

85
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,600
Just go.

86
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,400
It is said that the hearts of martial artists are sinister.

87
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,200
But since I came out of the valley,

88
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:02,300
I met Zhou Xu, Chengling, and Brother Cao, and each of them is more stupid than the previous.

89
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,000
Who are you?

90
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,200
It's me, Senior.

91
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:09,500
Miss Gu, you got up so early.

92
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,800
I'm doing my early morning exercise.

93
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,800
You guys go on. I'm out of here.

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Please wait, Miss Gu.

95
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:16,400
My master wants to see you.

96
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,900
Master.

97
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,200
Are you feeling a bit better now?

98
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,000
I'm fine.

99
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,500
Where is Uncle Wen, Master?

100
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:51,300
You knew to look for me the moment you woke up.

101
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,800
You're much more conscientious than your master.

102
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,200
Let's go.

103
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,900
Where are we going?

104
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,800
In such a big world, the three of us can go wherever we want to go.

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,900
However, before we leave, we need to find a secluded place

106
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,200
to take out what's inside Chengling.

107
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:13,200
It's never good to keep objects inside the body for long periods of time.

108
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,200
What happens after we take it out?

109
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,200
Throw it away, bury it, smash it up, who cares?

110
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,400
It's not a good thing, anyway.

111
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,100
But, Master, Ghost Valley annihilated my entire family

112
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,200
just to get the Glazed Armor.

113
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,000
That's even further proof that this isn't a good object.

114
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
My dad died because of the Glazed Armor.

115
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,800
The Heroes Conference is about to start.

116
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,000
It is said that Uncle Gao will use this event

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,400
to announce all of the Glazed Armor's history to the world.

118
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:38,400
If you want to know about its history,

119
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:40,200
there's no need to wait for the Heroes Conference.

120
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:42,200
I can just tell you.

121
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Regarding this mess,

122
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:50,500
no one in this world knows it better than I do.

123
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,700
Twenty years ago, there was a mysterious master

124
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:57,100
who appeared out of nowhere and made himself a big name in the martial arts world.

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,300
He was Rong Xuan, the Mountain Sealing Sword.

126
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,800
This man by the surname of Rong had a perplexing theory.
[The Mountain Sealing Sword, Rong Xuan]

127
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,200
He said that all martial arts in the world come from the same source,

128
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,500
and if everyone could discard their selfishness

129
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,000
and collaborate and learn,

130
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,400
they would be able to create an unprecedented master branch.

131
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:14,540
This perplexing theory actually managed to impress a crowd of people
 [Lu Taichong and Zhao Jing in youth]

132
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:17,000
who did not understand the world well enough.
[Gao Chong and Shen Shen in youth]

133
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The martial arts world twenty years ago
[Zhang Yusen in youth]

134
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,400
was not as stagnant as it is today.

135
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,500
Rather, people were able to feel like old friends upon first sight,

136
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,800
and have deep understandings of each other at first glance.

137
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:29,600
People gradually regarded Rong Xuan as the core.

138
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:33,700
They followed him in his madness, striving to change the inherited traditions

139
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,400
of martial arts for thousands of years

140
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,800
to create a completely new world.

141
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:44,800
However, Rong Xuan fell deeper and deeper into his dream.

142
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,800
He began to search for the secret scrolls in any way possible

143
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,600
whether by trickery or violence, or even by deception.

144
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,400
He used to be an outstanding young youth in the martial arts world, but gradually,

145
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,200
he became the rat that everyone passing by him shouted at and beat up.

146
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:02,400
Fortunately, Rong Xuan married the great disciple of the Miracle Healer Valley,

147
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
Yue Feng'Er, the Fairy Ganoderma, to be his wife.
[Yue Feng'Er]

148
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,000
Although he was injured several times by ambushes,

149
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,700
she saved him from the jaws of death.

150
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,300
The Heavens were blind.

151
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:15,000
After several years, this group of ignorant people

152
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,200
finally collected countless secret scrolls

153
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:23,400
and created a place called the World's Armory in a secret place.

154
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,700
He set up many traps outside the armory,

155
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,000
and divided the key into five parts,

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:32,000
respectively given to Rong Xuan's five strongest friends for safekeeping.

157
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,300
If one wants to open the World's Armory,

158
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,600
they must find all five pieces of the secret key. Not even one can be missing.

159
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,800
And then?

160
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,100
Then...

161
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,000
Then isn't what happened a well-known thing?

162
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,800
At that time, the Five Lakes Alliance held a Martial Arts Conference,

163
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,900
calling on all heroes to kill this madman.

164
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,400
Rong Xuan had no other choice

165
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,400
but to be forced to leave Mount Qingya.

166
00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:00,600
After killing countless people,

167
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,800
he finally exhausted all of his strength

168
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,900
and committed suicide by the demarcation stone in Ghost Valley.

169
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,200
A well-known thing?

170
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,300
How come my knowledge of it is different?

171
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,600
Because it's the end of Rong Xuan's story,

172
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,000
not that of the martial arts world.

173
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,200
After his suicide, the ghosts in Mount Qingya swarmed out

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,400
and started a huge battle with the righteous martial arts heroes.

175
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:35,400
That battle was fought despairingly

176
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
with many deaths and injuries on both sides.

177
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,000
The righteous martial arts heroes lost a large part of their people,

178
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,000
and the power of Ghost Valley was greatly weakened.

179
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,200
However, the great battle brought

180
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,600
twenty years of peace to the martial arts world.

181
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,800
Every survivor

182
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,800
had a loved one who died in the battle.

183
00:10:56,800 --> 00:11:01,800
The battle was started for ignominious reasons

184
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:05,600
and the ending was inglorious.

185
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,800
That's why people keep it a secret.

186
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:10,400
Do you mean that all these people who died

187
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,500
were greedy for the treasures in the armory?

188
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:15,400
If twenty years ago, the Five Lakes Alliance

189
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,800
opened the armory as they had hoped,

190
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:20,000
I imagine that the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

191
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
wouldn't have come to an end.

192
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,100
The Glazed Armor.

193
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,000
The Glazed Armor is the key.

194
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:35,700
My father was one of the five friends of Uncle Rong.

195
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:39,100
It's fine, it's fine. It's all in the past now.

196
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,000
Is it?

197
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,200
Not necessarily.

198
00:11:49,733 --> 00:11:52,033
[Chongwu Hall]

199
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,700
Last night, our Five Lakes Alliance was hit by assassins.

200
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:02,400
They took Zhang Chengling, my fourth brother's orphan, away.

201
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,000
This is a major event.

202
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,200
Perhaps we have a mole in here.

203
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,800
As this is an urgent matter, please allow me to be rude.

204
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,000
According to the reports of disciples of the Five Lakes Alliance,

205
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,300
none of you were in your rooms at the time of the incident yesterday.

206
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,600
I will be presumptuous

207
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:24,400
and ask all of you to clearly state where you went last night in order to clear yourself of suspicion.

208
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,700
This is also to avoid people from harboring resentment in the future.

209
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,500
Master, I have thought it through.

210
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,400
I can't leave now.

211
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,000
I must go back to the Five Lakes Alliance.

212
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:39,400
You little idiot. I said so much, but it was as if I were playing the lute to a cow.
(T/N: A Chinese saying that means he was preaching to deaf ears)

213
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,200
Since you already know the origin of the Glazed Armor

214
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,800
and the bad intentions of these people,

215
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,200
why do you still want to go back?

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,400
Because guarding the Glazed Armor is my dad's last wish.

217
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:52,800
I know that many people are involved in this matter.

218
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:56,200
No matter how useless I am, how could I stay out of the way just for my own safety?

219
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:59,200
What's more, the Heroes Conference is about to start

220
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,000
and I'm the only one left to represent the Mirror Lake Sword Sect.

221
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,300
If I am absent, then the Mirror Lake Sword Sect

222
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:07,300
will really be removed from the martial arts world.

223
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:12,000
Chengling, you're a responsible child.

224
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,400
It's great.

225
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,600
If you have decided to go back,

226
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,300
then listen to your master's advice

227
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,200
and return the Glazed Armor to the Five Lakes Alliance.

228
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:23,600
Why?

229
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,600
My father and the Five Lakes Alliance were locked in a stalemate for twenty years

230
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,800
just because of the Glazed Armor.

231
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:33,400
Chengling, which is more important: your safety or the Glazed Armor?

232
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:35,000
The Glazed Armor, of course.

233
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,400
No.

234
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:39,400
There is nothing more important than life.

235
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,600
The world itself does not naturally create trouble,

236
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,600
it is ignorant people who create it for themselves.

237
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,600
Chengling, what do you think of my martial arts skills?

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:57,000
Your skills are definitely the best.

239
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,600
My martial arts skills can't be considered bad,

240
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,700
and I'm more or less considered as top-tier.

241
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:08,500
However, I am only proficient in a few martial arts skills of my clan.

242
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:12,600
There is an end to life, but never to learning.

243
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,800
Even if ordinary people spend their entire life's energy,

244
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,600
they will still be unable to fully master a martial art's study.

245
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,200
Therefore, even if the armory is opened

246
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:23,800
and each person is given a kind of martial art, what can be done?

247
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,800
That's just human greed.

248
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:28,300
But, Master, my father told me—

249
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,960
Chengling, it was not the armory itself that Great Warrior Zhang clung to,

250
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,200
rather, it was the brotherhood.

251
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,500
If your father had actually wanted to open the armory,

252
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:41,400
he would have done so 20 years ago. What would the point in waiting until now be?

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,600
Senior Rong Xuan has passed away,

254
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,000
and your father has also become a martyr.

255
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,200
If they can see you in the underworld,

256
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:53,800
they must hope that you can be relieved from what happened 20 years ago

257
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:56,000
and continue living your own life.

258
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,400
They don't want you to keep carrying this trouble

259
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,800
and continuously get coveted and robbed.

260
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:03,600
Some people let their lives revolve around greed.

261
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,100
I have no control over them.

262
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,400
However, you are someone that I can influence.

263
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Take my advice. Throw this trouble out and let them scramble.

264
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,800
You, Miss,

265
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,000
I do not remember seeing you around.

266
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,200
Which sect are you a disciple of?

267
00:15:24,200 --> 00:15:25,800
Me?

268
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:31,000
I am nobody, not belonging to any sect.

269
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,400
I'm just a wild girl from the countryside.

270
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:35,000
Everyone in our area says

271
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,400
Great Warrior Gao is highly skilled in martial arts with an extraordinary spirit.

272
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,200
Now that I see you today, it's indeed true.

273
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,300
You have a grandiose reputation.
(T/N: Literally, "the name of a man, the shadow of a tree)

274
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:46,800
Father, she is Gu Xiang, Weining's... friend.

275
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:49,100
He introduced her to me,

276
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,400
and I arranged for her to stay.

277
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,200
By the way, she's also an old friend of Chengling.

278
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,600
She's not a bad person.

279
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
Sister Xiaolian, you're sweet but silly.

280
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,500
Mentioning exactly what you shouldn't mention.
(T/N: Literally, "mentioning the kettle that doesn't boil")

281
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,900
Miss Gu,

282
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:07,000
how did you meet Chengling?

283
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,400
It's pretty obvious, right?

284
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:13,600
Young Master Zhang is handsome with a good heart,

285
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:14,900
and he's also the offspring of a famous family.

286
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,400
Everyone knows who he is!

287
00:16:16,400 --> 00:16:18,700
All of us in Yuezhou know him.

288
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,800
Miss Gu, where did you go last night?

289
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,700
Great Warrior Gao... sorry, Supreme Leader Gao.

290
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:31,800
Surely you don't have to be so harsh?

291
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm just a girl from the countryside without worldly experience.

292
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:40,600
Your dominance scares me a little.

293
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:42,500
- Father.
- Shut up!

294
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:46,800
You are glib-tongued and exude a wicked aura about you.

295
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,800
You are definitely not a good girl.

296
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,000
Why did you let her stay over?

297
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,000
How am I not a good girl?

298
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,000
Can I only be considered one if I deliberately speak in a soft voice?

299
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,200
You!

300
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:59,000
Uncle Gao.

301
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:08,200
Uncle Gao, please don't blame Sister Xiaolian or put A'Xiang in a hard place.

302
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,800
It's all my fault.

303
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:14,300
Don't push the blame onto yourself, Weining.

304
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:18,600
Tell me! Where exactly did you go last night?

305
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:22,000
If you don't speak honestly, I will not continue treating you with courtesy!

306
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,000
- I...
- A'Xiang was with me the whole night last night!

307
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,900
[Yueyang Sect]

308
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,700
Chengling, remember.

309
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,100
Do your absolute best to make sure that others know

310
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,800
the Glazed Armor is no longer in your possession.

311
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:49,600
I'll pick you up when the Heroes Conference ends.

312
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,200
Little idiot.

313
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,000
Don't talk about things that have nothing to do with you,

314
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,600
and when you are asked, shake your head and say you don't know.

315
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,400
Understand?

316
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,100
The leaders of the Five Lakes Alliance are all cunning.

317
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:01,300
You don't need to care what kind of tricks they are playing.

318
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,700
Just ignore them and keep silent.

That must be painful.

Even with the Glazed Armor stuffed in your wound,

you were still running around in that condition.

Sincerely.

491

My father's personality is stalwart and inarticulate,

492
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:31,360
but I, as his daughter, know him best.

493
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:36,340
He spent the past years racking his brains, suffering day and night

494

just to remedy the gap between the five brothers

495
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,279
and to maintain the glory of the Five Lakes Alliance.

Isn't it the same as what I think?

I'd rather you be my brother

However, this matter between us

502
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:04,980
is an essential step for my father to restore the Five Lakes Alliance.

503
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:09,860
Otherwise, how could he tell the world about his determination?

504
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:14,239
Sister Xiaolian, how can you see your own marriage as a chess move?

505
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:17,319
I have no other way to help my father share the burden.

506

507

why are you still full of worry?

I'm wondering who saved Chengling.

548
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,180
Is it an enemy or an ally?

549

Why won't he come to see me?

550
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,979
Since he sent Chengling and the Glazed Armor back,

551
00:32:44,979 --> 00:32:46,960
he must not be an enemy.

552

The two pieces of the Glazed Armor from Second Brother and Taichong

must already be in Ghost Valley's possession.

Where is your Glazed Armor, Fifth Brother?

555

I've been carrying it with me as you instructed.

Nothing.

559
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:21,400
I was just thinking. If you, Eldest Brother, carry three pieces of the Glazed Armor yourself,

560
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,680
what if you fall into danger?

Even if the danger falls on me,

00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,600
it is better than letting you face danger.

640
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:40,120
Then... Then, just in case, I'll stay in the sect to protect him.

641
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,460
That fellow is an idiot!

642
00:38:42,460 --> 00:38:44,020
Who's there?

643
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:47,939
- Come out!
- Brother Zhou! It's me, it's me.

644
00:38:49,020 --> 00:38:50,999
Cao Weining, from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

645
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,039
You—

646
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:53,340
A'Xiang,

647
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:57,199
how did you not even know that someone was following you? How are you doing things?

648
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,020
Cao Weining, are you following me?

649
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:00,759
No, no! How could I dare to?

650
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:02,439
I just heard from Zhu Yaozhi

651
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,399
that someone wrote to ask you to meet here.

652
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,720
I thought it must be Master Wen,

653
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,739
so I felt a bit nervous and came with you.

654
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:12,679
Why are you nervous about my master looking for me?

655
00:39:12,679 --> 00:39:14,720
I'm afraid you'll leave.

656
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,900
Turns out the reason why A'Xiang doesn't want to leave Yueyang Sect...

657
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:21,720
is right here.

658
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:25,119
A'Xiang, you're willing to stay for me?

659
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:27,140
Her words don't count.

660
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,720
I decide whether or not my servant girl can leave or stay.

661
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:39,559
B-Brother Zhou, A'Xiang said you are seriously ill,

662
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:42,900
and Master Wen has found many famous doctors for you.

663
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,660
My master knows a lot of people,

664
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:47,559
and there must be competent doctors among them.

665
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:50,480
He'll be back in a few days for the Heroes Conference.

666
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:53,219
I will introduce you two to him.

667
00:39:53,219 --> 00:39:56,300
He has extensive knowledge, so he must have a solution.

668
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:01,000
I'll take care of A'Xu's injuries, so don't bother caring about it.

669
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:03,780
Thank you, Brother Cao.

670
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,500
But to be honest, I'm terminally ill and have a few days to live.

671
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:12,700
Thanks for your good intention.

672
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:16,640
Brother Zhou, I didn't expect you to have such a serious illness.

673
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:20,320
It's a trick of fate. A trick of fate.

674
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:22,960
Brother Zhou, there's must be a way.

675
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,919
My master and Supreme Leader Gao are bosom friends.

676
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,719
I heard that Supreme Leader Gao has a good relationship

677
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:31,580
with the three sages of the Miracle Healer Valley.

678
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:35,959
I can beg my master to let him help you enter the Miracle Healer Valley.

679
00:40:35,959 --> 00:40:38,580
Things may still turn around.

680
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:46,559
Brother Cao, you are such a warm-hearted man.

681
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,380
You are worthy of being among great warriors.

682
00:40:48,380 --> 00:40:51,000
You make me feel moved.

683
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:54,540
It's just that I'm paranoid.

684
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:57,679
Instead of wasting my time in seeking medical treatment,

685
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,679
I would rather, while I am still healthy, go with my soulmate right here

686
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:05,239
to travel across the world with wine and poetry.

687
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:09,480
Doing whatever we want without regret.

688
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:18,980
It's just that A'Xiang is a girl

689
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:23,420
and it's inconvenient for her to follow us, rough old men, across the world.

690
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:27,280
Today, Brother Wen and I were here discussing

691
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,699
if we could help A'Xiang find a...

692
00:41:30,699 --> 00:41:33,080
trustworthy companion

693
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,020
who she can settle with, that would be wonderful.

694
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:49,360
B-Brother Zhou, Master Wen... what do you think of me?

695
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,310
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

696
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:46,660
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

697
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:53,790
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

698
00:42:53,790 --> 00:43:02,370
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

699
00:43:02,370 --> 00:43:09,330
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

700
00:43:09,330 --> 00:43:16,820
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

701
00:43:16,820 --> 00:43:20,749
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

702
00:43:20,749 --> 00:43:24,289
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

703
00:43:24,289 --> 00:43:32,170
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

704
00:43:32,170 --> 00:43:35,699
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

705
00:43:35,699 --> 00:43:39,299
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

706
00:43:39,299 --> 00:43:47,330
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

707
00:43:47,330 --> 00:43:50,759
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

708
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,649
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

709
00:43:54,649 --> 00:44:01,670
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

710
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:10,290
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
