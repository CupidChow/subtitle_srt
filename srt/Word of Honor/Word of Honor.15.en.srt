[Episode 15]

23
00:01:53,300 --> 00:02:00,490
Eldest Senior, tomorrow is the Heroes Conference.

24
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:04,620
Dad said he will announce

25
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:07,980
my marriage with Brother Chengling at the conference.

26
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:10,540
I can't disobey my father's orders.

27
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:15,110
If one day you wake up, will you blame me?

28
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,860
Who is it?

29
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,460
It's A'Xiang.

30
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:25,410
What happened to you?

31
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,599
What happened?

32
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:31,079
Why are your hands so hot?

33
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,340
Hurry up and rest over there.

34
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,100
Why were you so careless?

35
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:39,890
Be careful.

36
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,760
Slowly.

37
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:49,709
Silly A'Xiang, why can't you be more careful?

38
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,809
At this distance, using the Unfaithful Nail Sister Qianqiao gave me

39
00:02:55,809 --> 00:02:57,799
would surely freeze her.

40
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,270
It does feel a bit hot.

41
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,370
Don't go. Don't go.

42
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:05,270
Okay, let me check your pulse.

43
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,780
Gu Xiang, Gu Xiang.

44
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:11,090
Don't panic. I have to freeze her in one move.

45
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,320
Only then will I have the chance to exchange her for Aunt Luo.

46
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,250
A'Xiang! A'Xiang!

47
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,680
A'Xiang!

48
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:24,379
A'Xiang! I heard them say that you were sick and came here to get treated.

49
00:03:24,379 --> 00:03:26,429
What's wrong?

50
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:28,810
How did you get sick all of a sudden?

51
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:31,189
Sister Xiaolian, is her illness serious?

52
00:03:31,189 --> 00:03:33,420
Not particularly.

53
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,890
I'll fetch her some medicine first.

54
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:38,380
A'Xiang.

55
00:03:38,380 --> 00:03:40,100
Go away, go away. Don't touch me.

56
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,899
What are you trying to do, Cao Weining?

57
00:03:41,899 --> 00:03:43,600
I...

58
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:46,180
I wasn't trying to do anything.

59
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,700
I... bought you some snacks.

60
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,899
My goodness, he's so clingy
(T/N: She is literally calling him dogskin plaster because it cannot easily be shaken off)

61
00:03:55,899 --> 00:04:00,180
Couldn't he have come a moment earlier or later? I'm so unlucky.

62
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,899
A'Xiang, the medicine will be bitter.

63
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,749
Here, have something sweet.

64
00:04:03,749 --> 00:04:05,190
No.

65
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:06,849
- I don't want it!
- It's delicious!

66
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:08,610
Try it.

67
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:11,230
Really! Look at me!

68
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:13,210
It's delicious.

69
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:17,550
From now on, if Mount Tai Sect has any demands,

70
00:04:17,550 --> 00:04:21,079
the Five Lakes Alliance will spare no effort to comply, even at the expense of our own lives.

71
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,620
Very well.

72
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:25,669
Mount Tai Sect's only request

73
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:29,050
is for the Five Lakes Alliance to punish the murderer immediately!

74
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,669
- Punish the murderer!
- Yes, punish the murderer!

75
00:04:31,669 --> 00:04:35,650
Punish the murderer! Punish the murderer!

76
00:04:36,420 --> 00:04:38,520
Of course, the murderer must be punished.

77
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,259
As long as everyone works together,

78
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:41,699
we'll catch the demon of Ghost Valley

79
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:44,109
and cut him into a thousand pieces

80
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:48,590
to comfort the spirit of Senior Ao Laizi!

81
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,879
You are messing around!

82
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,000
My master's death was caused by him!

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,829
Did you see Leader Shen kill him with your own eyes?

84
00:04:55,830 --> 00:05:00,110
Or did you see Leader Shen order his murder with your own eyes?

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:05,850
So you saw neither, did you?

86
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:11,560
Everyone knows that Senior Ao Laizi was killed by Ghost Valley.

87
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,939
Many friends and families of the heroes of the martial arts world

88
00:05:15,939 --> 00:05:18,200
have been murdered by Ghost Valley.

89
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:22,010
The reason I arranged the Heroes Conference here

90
00:05:22,010 --> 00:05:25,829
is to avenge the dead!

91
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,210
Everyone, you must remember!

92
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:30,660
Do not fall for the instigation of others!

93
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,330
Do not panic!

94
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:36,590
Or else, you will step right into the trap of the evildoers!

95
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:39,950
Elder Huang, what do you say?

96
00:05:41,730 --> 00:05:43,340
You're right.

97
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:44,940
The most important thing right now

98
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,709
is to crusade against the culprit, Ghost Valley!

99
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:50,170
The lost Glazed Armor of Senior Ao Laizi

100
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:55,130
has most likely fallen into the hands of the murderer from Ghost Valley.

101
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,590
As the saying goes, evil does not suppress righteousness!

102
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:02,999
The Five Lakes Alliance will destroy Ghost Valley

103
00:06:02,999 --> 00:06:05,950
and return peace to the martial arts world!

104
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:13,869
Crusade against Ghost Valley, restore peace of the martial arts world!

105
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,669
That Gao has impressive eloquence.

106
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,020
Crusade against Ghost Valley, restore peace of the martial arts world!

107
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:27,979
Crusade against Ghost Valley, restore peace of the martial arts world!

108
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:31,720
Supreme Leader Gao,

109
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:36,669
a few days ago at Renyi Hall, you promised

110
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:38,799
to explain the whole story behind the Glazed Armor

111
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:42,700
to everyone at the Heroes Conference.

112
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:46,499
Over half of the participating heroes of the Conference are here.

113
00:06:46,499 --> 00:06:50,650
When do you plan to tell us the truth?

114
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:55,650
Huang He, do you want to know the truth about the Glazed Armor

115
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,370
or do you want to know its whereabouts?

116
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,350
So what if I do?

117
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,170
Don't all of the heroes standing here

118
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,879
deserve to know the truth?

119
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:11,890
That's right!

120
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:16,100
That is the reason why the Iron Fist Gang came here today!

121
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:19,489
The Iron Fist Gang bore the brunt of the Battle of Mount Qingya.

122
00:07:19,489 --> 00:07:21,500
We suffered heavy casualties.

123
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:25,920
Supreme Leader Gao, you still owe us an explanation!

124
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,049
Supreme Leader Gao,
[Leader of the Eagle Claw Gang]

125
00:07:27,049 --> 00:07:30,869
I lost an eye on Mount Qingya and a son!

126
00:07:30,869 --> 00:07:35,029
I paid such a high price, yet it did not garner the lost secrets of my Eagle Claw Gang.

127
00:07:35,029 --> 00:07:38,481
Isn't it at least enough to ask the Five Lakes Alliance for the truth?

128
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:41,110
Supreme Leader Gao! Give us an explanation!

129
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,319
Give us an explanation!

130
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,139
Explain yourself! Give us an answer!

131
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:47,450
Hurry up, explain yourself!

132
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:51,440
Give us an explanation!

133
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,080
Friend.

134
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,550
It's so lively right now. Where are you going?

135
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:09,820
It's you?

136
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,070
Venomous Scorpions?

137
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:28,990
Fine. I shall tell you the truth today.

138
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,490
The Glazed Armor is in the possession of the Five Lakes Alliance.

139
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:35,190
Eldest Brother!

140
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:41,949
All of the Five Lakes Alliance's actions

141
00:08:41,949 --> 00:08:45,859
were all for nothing more than the peace of the world, the tranquility of the martial arts world!

142
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:49,119
It's because the martial arts world has suffered heavily after the Battle of Mount Qingya

143
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:51,620
and can't withstand even bigger calamity,

144
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:55,370
that we five brothers divided the Glazed Armor between us

145
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,660
to secretly protect them and wait for the right moment!

146
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:04,649
Supreme Gao, you make it sound as if it were your right to do so, as if you had no other choice!

147
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:07,489
The World's Armory collected secret records of martial arts from all over the world.

148
00:09:07,489 --> 00:09:10,959
What right does your Five Lakes Alliance have to keep the heroes of the world in the dark?

149
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,450
Supreme Leader Gao! Every one of us contributed to defeating Rong Xuan!

150
00:09:16,450 --> 00:09:19,229
What right do you have to keep the Glazed Armor in secret?
[Leader of the Barberry Sect]

151
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:20,229
What right do you have?

152
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,709
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

153
00:09:21,710 --> 00:09:23,250
We will all redistribute it!

154
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:27,090
Yes! Hand over the Glazed Armor! Redistribute it!

155
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,199
Hand over the Glazed Armor at once!

156
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,340
Dear heroes, please listen to what I have to say!

157
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:40,140
Years ago, the Glazed Armor caused great bloodshed among the martial arts world!

158
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:42,730
It almost caused a catastrophe!

159
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,789
Right now in Yueyang City,

160
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,589
there are evil people spreading fake pieces of Glazed Armor across the world.

161
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:53,109
It once again caused countless casualties throughout the martial arts world!

162
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,980
This item is the scourge of the martial arts world, an absolute cause of chaos!

163
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:00,999
Supreme Leader Gao, stop being a hypocrite!

164
00:10:00,999 --> 00:10:03,169
The turmoil within the martial arts world 20 years ago

165
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,859
and the dispute caused by the fake Glazed Armor right now

166
00:10:06,859 --> 00:10:10,250
were both planned by your Five Lakes Alliance, weren't they?

167
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,340
Tell me. Aside from those who are very familiar with the Glazed Armor,

168
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:17,020
who else could have made such real-looking faux pieces?

169
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:20,029
What are you saying?

170
00:10:20,030 --> 00:10:23,439
Why are all of your words so slanderous against Supreme Leader Gao?

171
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,060
What is your purpose?

172
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,549
What do you mean?

173
00:10:28,549 --> 00:10:32,179
Could the Five Lakes Alliance possibly have made the fake Glazed Armor?
[Disciple of the Twelve Chain Cove]

174
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:33,080
How vicious!

175
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:36,640
Feng Xiaofeng! You're full of nonsense!

176
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,439
Feng Xiaofeng, stop spreading your fucking bullshit!

177
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,450
If you dare spread any more rumors, I will kill you!

178
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:47,540
Feng Xiaofeng! You'll be the first one I kill!

179
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,960
Come the hell down.

180
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:06,360
A'Xu, just tell me to come down, you don't need to be so rude.

181
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,090
Do you think I'd dare to disobey your word?

182
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:16,010
A'Xu, you're here?

183
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:17,940
Have a sip.

184
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:20,190
Where did you run off to?

185
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:22,550
I saw Pretty Arhat just now.

186
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:26,649
If the Venomous Scorpions get in on this mess, there will surely be nothing good to come out of it.

187
00:11:27,790 --> 00:11:31,399
Things will be bad no matter whether the Venomous Scorpions are involved or not.

188
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,099
As long as the fire doesn't reach our Chengling, what does it matter to us?

189
00:11:36,099 --> 00:11:39,399
After carefully thinking about how the Venomous Scorpions abducted Chengling,

190
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:42,410
things are very strange.

191
00:11:42,410 --> 00:11:44,660
Wasn't that for the Glazed Armor?

192
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:48,599
A'Xu, don't worry about it. Just relax and watch the show.

193
00:11:48,599 --> 00:11:52,599
If you ask me, this big show of Supreme Leader Gao fighting the heroes with his words

194
00:11:52,599 --> 00:11:54,759
still has a shocking twist ahead.

195
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,300
Let's wait for the brilliant performance.

196
00:11:59,210 --> 00:12:02,340
Soon he will rise up high,

197
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:05,390
soon he will feast on his guests,

198
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:08,750
soon his podium will crumble.

199
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:16,130
Gao Chong, the Beggar Gangs, Ghost Valley, the Window of Heaven

200
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,140
and the Venomous Scorpions.

201
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:21,210
From beginning to end, in this fight for the Glazed Armor,

202
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,380
the shadow of the Venomous Scorpions has always been there.

203
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,420
What role do the Venomous Scorpions really play in this?

204
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:35,310
Once the limit is determined, a stable pursuit can be chased.

205
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,140
Once the stable pursuit is chased, tranquility can be obtained.

206
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,400
[Once the limit is determined, a stable pursuit can be chased. Once the stable pursuit is found, tranquility can be obtained.]

207
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,340
Father, everything you planned has been arranged.
(T/N: The word being used is "adopted father")

208
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:54,119
It's your turn to make an appearance now.

209
00:12:54,119 --> 00:12:57,990
It's time to end it.
[Tranquility]

210
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:01,520
If my guess is correct,

211
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:04,229
Ghost Valley and the Venomous Scorpions must have joined hands.

212
00:13:04,229 --> 00:13:08,739
The incident of the theater corpses harbored the shadow of Venomous Scorpion's assassin Qin Song.

213
00:13:08,739 --> 00:13:12,699
Moreover, the strange Drug Men driven by evil spirits at the Zhao Family's coffin home

214
00:13:12,699 --> 00:13:15,610
also appeared in large numbers at the base of the Venomous Scorpions.

215
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:27,550
Old Wen, someone is manipulating this show from behind the scenes.

216
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:31,130
This person has a far-reaching scheme that he is carrying out with malicious intent.

217
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:33,960
Is that not good?

218
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:38,670
It's precisely because those self-conceited people are creating so many twists and turns

219
00:13:38,670 --> 00:13:42,150
that you and I have such a wonderful time watching it play out.

220
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:49,050
What you call a wonderful time entails the blood of innocent people.

221
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:51,340
Is that also what you wish to see?

222
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,700
"Innocent"?

223
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:57,570
Which one of these people dares to call himself innocent?

224
00:13:58,810 --> 00:14:01,330
However, A'Xu, you are right.

225
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:05,229
The type of lively play I want to see is precisely this kind of play, where starving animals fighting over food

226
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:08,750
as blood spills rivers.

227
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:15,979
You go on and on about Ghost Valley!

228
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,109
Stop beating around the bush!

229
00:14:18,109 --> 00:14:21,149
Supreme Leader Gao, please take out the Glazed Armor

230
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:23,640
and open the armory!

231
00:14:23,640 --> 00:14:28,080
Every sect will retrieve their lost secret records

232
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,580
and then fight against Ghost Valley!

233
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,899
Wouldn't that be perfect?

234
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:37,750
Yes! Open the armory! Hand over the Glazed Armor!

235
00:14:43,710 --> 00:14:49,060
Everyone! It's not that I am unwilling to hand over the Glazed Armor.

236
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:53,160
Even if I did hand it over, I couldn't open the gate to the armory!

237
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,900
Enough!

238
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:58,469
Stop telling us one lie after another!

239
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,390
We've heard enough!

240
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:04,149
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

241
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:08,200
Supreme Leader Gao sure is sly and eloquent!

242
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:12,810
There's someone who can testify on my behalf!

243
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:20,220
Let me see what tricks you still have left.

244
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:39,159
- Put her down!
- Whatever, take this woman away first!

245
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:59,079
- Master.
- Let's go.
- Go.

246
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,940
How strange. Why haven't I seen anyone on the way over?

247
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:05,810
Where are the disciples on patrol?

248
00:16:05,810 --> 00:16:07,290
[Worship of Literature]

249
00:16:07,290 --> 00:16:11,520
So strange. How come all the people here are gone?

250
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:13,539
Where did the physician and pharmacist go?

251
00:16:13,539 --> 00:16:16,760
Miss Gao, come with me!

252
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,950
You go first, I'll stop them!

253
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:21,200
As if you could!

254
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,960
Brother Cao!

255
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,220
You old witch! How dare you hurt him!

256
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:02,270
Watch out!

257
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:07,090
Brother Cao! Brother Cao!

258
00:17:07,090 --> 00:17:08,790
Weining!

259
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:17,710
Brother Cao! Don't die!

260
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:21,200
I don't want to owe an idiot my life for no reason!

261
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,300
Right!

262
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:33,900
Why did I have to choose you back then?

263
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:37,840
If I knew, I would have found another way to get inside Yueyang Sect.

264
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,800
Why did you treat me so well?

265
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:44,200
Silly girl, are you really going to waste the precious lifesaving medicine I gave you like this?

266
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:51,660
Aunt Luo?

267
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:39,089
[Young Leader of the Dragon Pool Cabinet, Long Xiao]

268
00:18:39,089 --> 00:18:40,589
- Who is this person?
- He is...

269
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,619
Didn't you see the carriage's mechanism?

270
00:18:42,619 --> 00:18:46,049
That must be the legendary Leader of the Dragon Pool Cabinet.

271
00:18:46,049 --> 00:18:52,230
The only person who could create such brilliant mechanisms would be him.

272
00:18:52,230 --> 00:18:55,379
In the old days, even the emperor showed the Dragon Pool Cabinet his respect.

273
00:18:55,379 --> 00:18:59,449
There were rumors 20 years ago in the martial arts world that Dragon Pool Cabinet can open the armory.

274
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:01,400
Open the armory?

275
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:05,229
The leader of the Dragon Pool Cabinet is supposed to be an old man!

276
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,630
Who is this kid?

277
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:15,689
I suppose all of you recognize him now.

278
00:19:15,689 --> 00:19:19,859
This is the one and only Master of Mechanics.

279
00:19:19,859 --> 00:19:23,860
Long Xiao, the young master of the Dragon Pool Cabinet.

280
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,780
I invited him here today

281
00:19:26,780 --> 00:19:29,860
so he can tell everyone

282
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:34,539
the whole story behind the armory!

283
00:19:34,560 --> 00:19:36,760
Supreme Leader Gao is right.

284
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:39,070
No one knows the story behind the armory

285
00:19:39,079 --> 00:19:45,000
better than my father, Ban Zhuge, Long Que.

286
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:48,809
- The demon Rong Xuan relied on clever means
- How could it be Long Que?

287
00:19:48,809 --> 00:19:53,689
to steal countless secret records of martial arts of various sects.

288
00:19:53,689 --> 00:19:56,249
He knew he had committed many wrongdoings.

289
00:19:56,249 --> 00:19:58,819
For fear that others would steal from him,

290
00:19:58,819 --> 00:20:02,679
he used evil tricks to deceive my father and tricked him

291
00:20:02,679 --> 00:20:06,280
into designing the World's Armory for him.

292
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,580
Young Leader Long, Gao Chong just said

293
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:13,249
that even with the Glazed Armor, the armory cannot be opened.

294
00:20:13,249 --> 00:20:17,779
Wh-What the hell is this nonsense?

295
00:20:17,779 --> 00:20:22,219
Supreme Leader Gao is right. The armory is highly complex.

296
00:20:22,219 --> 00:20:27,159
It is indeed impossible to open it safely with the Glazed Armor alone.

297
00:20:27,159 --> 00:20:29,469
Just tell us! Can you open the armory or not?

298
00:20:29,469 --> 00:20:31,699
Exactly! Can you open the armory or not?

299
00:20:31,699 --> 00:20:35,000
I am sorry to disappoint you.

300
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,600
I did not inherit the true teachings of my father.

301
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:43,190
I cannot open the armory.

302
00:20:43,950 --> 00:20:48,029
Can't open it? Then stop wasting our time!

303
00:20:48,029 --> 00:20:51,859
However, the mechanics were designed by my father.

304
00:20:51,859 --> 00:20:56,900
He must know how to open it.

305
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:03,360
Supreme Leader Gao, I came here personally today

306
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:05,879
to convey my father's attitude to you

307
00:21:05,879 --> 00:21:10,930
with everyone as my witness.

308
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:16,739
No matter how much you bribe us or coerce us,

309
00:21:16,739 --> 00:21:22,929
we will never help you open the armory and satisfy your selfishness!

310
00:21:22,929 --> 00:21:23,979
Young Leader Long.

311
00:21:23,979 --> 00:21:27,569
The armory is the armory of the people!

312
00:21:27,569 --> 00:21:29,369
No one can embezzle it!

313
00:21:29,369 --> 00:21:31,029
- That's right!
- Well said!

314
00:21:31,029 --> 00:21:33,129
The armory is the armory of the people!

315
00:21:33,129 --> 00:21:35,299
Well said!

316
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:37,370
I knew you wanted to make the armory your own!

317
00:21:37,370 --> 00:21:39,659
You all heard it, didn't you?

318
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:44,460
Gao Chong wants to take all the treasures in the armory!

319
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:47,039
How despicable!

320
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,740
Long Xiao!

321
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,740
When has my eldest brother ever bribed or coerced your father?

322
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,449
Spewing such nonsense in front of so many people,

323
00:21:59,449 --> 00:22:01,560
do you think I won't kill you?

324
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,899
What the hell are you saying? Why did you lie to me?

325
00:22:05,899 --> 00:22:08,250
What are you scheming?

326
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,869
Please, don't believe him!

327
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,029
My brother has never harassed the Dragon Pool Cabinet!

328
00:22:13,029 --> 00:22:16,159
Gao, haven't you played us enough?

329
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:18,350
Your witness already told us the truth!

330
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:20,420
How much longer do you still want to deny it?

331
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,870
Quickly hand over the Glazed Armor!

332
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:23,829
Hand over the Glazed Armor!

333
00:22:23,829 --> 00:22:28,910
Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!

334
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,850
Eldest Brother, I'm sorry!

335
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,779
I couldn't find the Dragon Pool Cabinet, no matter how hard I tried.

336
00:22:35,779 --> 00:22:39,359
He approached me instead.

337
00:22:39,359 --> 00:22:42,280
He said he would testify for me.

338
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,819
It's all my fault! I got you into this mess!

339
00:22:46,819 --> 00:22:49,020
Zhao Xuande?

340
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:52,580
How did such a weak and stupid fool

341
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,519
become one of the five sons of the Five Lakes Alliance?

342
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,729
That Shen Shen is not an idiot.

343
00:22:57,729 --> 00:23:02,330
Your apprentice's great dad and Lu Taichong are not much better.

344
00:23:02,330 --> 00:23:03,919
What a Five Lakes Alliance.

345
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,540
Old Wen, why do you hold such extreme views?

346
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:10,039
Don't let hatred blind your eyes

347
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,359
and affect your judgment on the Five Lakes Alliance.

348
00:23:12,359 --> 00:23:14,829
Can't you see it with your talent?

349
00:23:14,829 --> 00:23:18,670
Someone deliberately set Gao Chong up.

350
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,359
I know that, of course.

351
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:23,950
That's why I can't wait to applaud this man.

352
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:25,499
A'Xu, stop making noise.

353
00:23:25,499 --> 00:23:30,789
Let's see how Great Warrior Gao will manage to turn the tide and respond to this scheme.

354
00:23:30,789 --> 00:23:32,670
Quiet down!

355
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,620
Everyone, quiet down!

356
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:42,769
There may be some misunderstanding between Young Leader Long's father and me.

357
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:45,259
However, I can promise you this!

358
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:50,239
I do not hold even the slightest selfish motive regarding the armory!

359
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,979
Misunderstanding my ass!

360
00:23:51,979 --> 00:23:54,109
Don't confuse the crowd anymore! Hand over the Glazed Armor!

361
00:23:54,109 --> 00:23:55,609
Hurry up and hand over the Glazed Armor!

362
00:23:55,609 --> 00:23:59,790
I swear to the heavens!

363
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,730
Once Ghost Valley is wiped out,

364
00:24:01,730 --> 00:24:05,040
Young Leader Long and I will lead everyone

365
00:24:05,049 --> 00:24:10,130
in distributing the secrets of the armory among all sects!

366
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:12,760
If I am insincere,

367
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,600
I shall be cut into thousands of pieces!

368
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:20,080
If there is no objection, this matter has thus been decided!

369
00:24:22,110 --> 00:24:25,459
Young Leader Long, you've had a long journey.

370
00:24:25,459 --> 00:24:27,399
You may go to rest now.

371
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:28,900
Yes!

372
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,680
Get up.

373
00:24:34,610 --> 00:24:36,420
Get up!

374
00:24:58,420 --> 00:25:00,220
Chengling,

375
00:25:02,190 --> 00:25:04,290
don't be afraid.

376
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,930
Come.

377
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,230
Uncle Gao.

378
00:25:16,160 --> 00:25:21,230
I still have one more thing to tell everyone.

379
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:28,230
This is the orphan of my fourth brother, Zhang Yusen; Zhang Chengling.

380
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:32,660
He is the last descendant of the Mirror Lake Sect.

381
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:35,190
I have decided

382
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:39,559
to betroth my daughter to him!

383
00:25:39,559 --> 00:25:43,109
In the future, he will be my son-in-law and together with my beloved daughter,

384
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:46,890
they will lead Mirror Lake Sect and Yueyang Sect!

385
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:00,120
After that, I shall become a monk and walk my path with Buddha!

386
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:04,419
I will no longer handle the matters of the mortal world again.

387
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:06,850
Eldest Brother, don't do this!

388
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:13,360
I have already made my decision. You don't need to stop me.

389
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:16,999
You bastards!

390
00:26:16,999 --> 00:26:21,020
How dare you force my leader into becoming a monk!

391
00:26:21,020 --> 00:26:23,360
Are you satisfied now?

392
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:29,339
A'Xu, Gao Chong dragged your apprentice down with him.

393
00:26:29,339 --> 00:26:31,760
Do you still think I was wrong to blame him?

394
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:36,649
No. Doing this doesn't benefit Gao Chong at all.

395
00:26:36,649 --> 00:26:38,879
A'Xu, why do you insist on contradicting me?

396
00:26:38,879 --> 00:26:40,990
Gao Chong has always pretended to be the paragon of virtue.

397
00:26:40,990 --> 00:26:44,399
He must be using Chengling as a shield for some trick of his!

398
00:26:44,399 --> 00:26:47,730
Gao Chong announced this in public. There is no return for him.

399
00:26:47,730 --> 00:26:49,250
Chengling has already handed over the Glazed Armor.

400
00:26:49,250 --> 00:26:51,920
What value would he still have for Gao Chong?

401
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,039
Everyone, please look.

402
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,319
What is this?
[Token of Honor]

403
00:27:17,319 --> 00:27:19,840
This is the Token of Honor!

404
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,160
What? What is the Token of Honor?

405
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:24,659
This is the token of the Sword Immortal of Changming Mountain.

406
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:28,089
The Sword Immortal once swore an oath

407
00:27:28,089 --> 00:27:31,200
that if Ghost Valley harms the martial arts world,

408
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:35,110
the holder of this token can order the world

409
00:27:35,110 --> 00:27:38,760
to eradicate that cancerous evil in his name!

410
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:45,690
With this token, what doubt could you still possess?

411
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:51,420
I'm willing to return the armory to the people!

412
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:55,020
I don't need power and might!

413
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:59,190
I only have one wish!

414
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:01,130
It is...

415
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:06,770
to destroy Ghost Valley, to avenge the deceased brothers,

416
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:10,850
to return peace to the martial arts world!

417
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:17,140
Our Five Lakes Alliance and Ghost Valley cannot coexist.

418
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:20,480
It is imperative to attack Mount Qingya!

419
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:22,810
What else do you have to say?

420
00:28:23,490 --> 00:28:25,540
Bring the wine.

421
00:28:28,368 --> 00:28:31,328
[Lone Taiyue and Danyang Sects]
[Emptiness the world remains]

422
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:47,810
Those who are willing to work with me to wipe out Ghost Valley

423
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,680
may mix your blood here.

424
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:54,380
Whether we were friends or foes in the past,

425
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,229
after drinking this wine, we will be

426
00:28:58,229 --> 00:29:01,530
brothers who can die for each other!

427
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:09,870
Before Ghost Valley is destroyed, this oath will not be broken.

428
00:29:09,870 --> 00:29:13,470
Those who take the oath may stay,

429
00:29:13,470 --> 00:29:17,359
those who wish to leave, I will not stop you!

430
00:29:17,359 --> 00:29:22,660
Great Warrior Gao, you really know how to fool people—

431
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,110
Supreme Leader Gao.

432
00:29:40,180 --> 00:29:43,769
The Gentle Wind Sword Sect and the Ghost Valley have a blood feud.

433
00:29:43,769 --> 00:29:47,469
Today I, Fan Huaikong, entrust my life to you.

434
00:29:47,469 --> 00:29:49,800
I shall follow your orders.

435
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,479
Many thanks.

436
00:29:54,479 --> 00:29:56,360
Supreme Leader Gao!

437
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:04,050
My Great Whale Gang looks forward to your leadership.

438
00:30:05,430 --> 00:30:07,089
Supreme Leader Gao put it very well!

439
00:30:07,089 --> 00:30:09,960
My men and I also swear to follow Supreme Leader Gao!

440
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,580
My Water Transport Gang will also follow you!

441
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:17,190
Great Warrior Gao, I didn't hear clearly.

442
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:19,000
I wish to confirm something with you.

443
00:30:19,009 --> 00:30:23,449
You said that after Ghost Valley is destroyed, you'll open the armory

444
00:30:23,449 --> 00:30:27,900
and give the secret records to each sect. Right?

445
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,580
I will not go back on my word.

446
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:36,340
Good. Supreme Leader Gao is an upright man.

447
00:30:36,340 --> 00:30:38,519
There's something I'm curious about.

448
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:44,099
The Combined Six Cultivation Method and the Yin Yang Book belong to no one.

449
00:30:44,099 --> 00:30:47,339
How do you plan on settling that?

450
00:30:47,339 --> 00:30:49,530
That's right!

451
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:55,729
How will you distribute the Combined Six Cultivation Method and the Yin Yang Book?

452
00:30:55,729 --> 00:30:57,890
Will these unowned items

453
00:30:57,890 --> 00:31:02,750
end up in your pocket accordingly?

454
00:31:03,640 --> 00:31:06,370
You people!

455
00:31:06,370 --> 00:31:10,829
You haven't even cleared up the most critical issue, yet you already anxiously pledged allegiance!

456
00:31:10,829 --> 00:31:15,260
This is Great Warrior Gao's usual trick!

457
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:32,439
Who says the Combined Six Cultivation Method and the Yin Yang Book

458
00:31:32,439 --> 00:31:35,080
don't belong to anyone?

459
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,750
Rong Xuan had his own sect.

460
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,340
Once I open the armory,

461
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:44,050
we will return the Combined Six Cultivation Method

462
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:47,320
to his mentor!

463
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,700
As for the Yin Yang Book,

464
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:54,490
it is an artifact of the Miracle Healer Valley!

465
00:31:54,490 --> 00:31:56,569
It will naturally be returned!

466
00:31:56,569 --> 00:31:58,719
Supreme Leader Gao, stop joking around.

467
00:31:58,719 --> 00:32:00,659
They are all dead, how will you return it?

468
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,359
The leader of our Flying Sand Gang is a close friend to the Miracle Healer Valley.

469
00:32:03,359 --> 00:32:06,840
This Yin Yang Book should be managed by us!

470
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:10,729
You bastard! Are you trying to make me die of laughter?

471
00:32:10,729 --> 00:32:12,689
What kind of friendship would that be?

472
00:32:12,689 --> 00:32:17,179
Why don't you say that your leader is the long-lost grandson of the leader of the Miracle Healer Valley?

473
00:32:17,179 --> 00:32:18,689
That's right!

474
00:32:18,689 --> 00:32:21,949
Dear heroes, if you ask me, in the Battle of Mount Qingya,

475
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:26,119
our Five Tigers Broken Knives Clan suffered the worst casualties!

476
00:32:26,119 --> 00:32:29,089
If we consider meritorious deeds, the cultivation method should be

477
00:32:29,089 --> 00:32:32,789
given to my Peng family as compensation!

478
00:32:32,789 --> 00:32:35,199
Is it that glorious to have a high death count?

479
00:32:35,199 --> 00:32:36,799
You fucking call that meritorious?

480
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:38,430
You...!

481
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,959
Brother Feng is right. We should distribute according to merit.

482
00:32:43,959 --> 00:32:47,219
Our Twelve Chain Cove rendered the most merit.

483
00:32:47,219 --> 00:32:51,889
The strategy of besieging Mount Qingya was our leader's idea!

484
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:56,799
You bunch of robbers are just idiots!
(T/N: Literal translation, "bellies full of grass, brains full of water")

485
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:58,719
- Your idea, my ass!
- You...!

486
00:32:58,719 --> 00:33:02,449
Leader, are you guys of the Cove even literate?

487
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:06,980
Even if you get the book, can you read it?

488
00:33:09,450 --> 00:33:15,220
Everyone, our Barberry Sect has a long history and long heritage!

489
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:19,100
This Yin Yang Book should be ours!

490
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:20,550
Fight.

491
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:22,810
Fight!

492
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:26,949
Old Wen, who are you exactly?

493
00:33:26,949 --> 00:33:30,139
Do you want to test my martial arts skills?

494
00:33:30,139 --> 00:33:32,780
Why not? You think I'm afraid of you?

495
00:33:32,780 --> 00:33:34,709
Come on! Come!

496
00:33:34,709 --> 00:33:38,670
They want to fight but don't dare to. Cowards.

497
00:33:39,489 --> 00:33:41,640
Old Wen,

498
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:45,520
do you hate the Five Lakes Alliance or the whole martial arts world?

499
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,340
You are still trying to trick me into thinking you aren't Rong Xuan's son?

500
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:54,029
A'Xu, you can believe me or not.

501
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:57,999
I have never lied to you.

502
00:33:57,999 --> 00:34:02,100
In that case, why bother with these ignorant humans?

503
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,740
Humans? How are they even human?

504
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:07,859
The righteous clans of the martial arts world?

505
00:34:07,859 --> 00:34:11,039
The difference between them and Ghost Valley is that one is blatantly evil,

506
00:34:11,039 --> 00:34:13,709
and the other is wearing a cover of benevolence, justice, and morality.

507
00:34:13,709 --> 00:34:15,659
Yet as soon as they see a sign of flesh,

508
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:20,179
they can't wait to tear off their human skin and start barking and biting!

509
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:22,170
Exciting.

510
00:34:22,170 --> 00:34:24,210
How exciting.

511
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:27,140
All right.

512
00:34:28,650 --> 00:34:32,390
We walk different paths and have different ideas.

513
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,610
I can't persuade you.

514
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:36,640
Let's each follow our own hearts

515
00:34:36,640 --> 00:34:38,760
and go our separate ways.

516
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:14,250
Everyone's gone. I'm all alone now.

517
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:17,989
There are only so few people locked up. What is the point of watching over them?

518
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:25,699
Senior Brother, you're awake! Great!

519
00:36:29,182 --> 00:36:32,782
[Yue]

520
00:36:44,380 --> 00:36:48,060
I'm the first disciple of Yueyang Sect, Deng Kuan.

521
00:36:50,410 --> 00:36:53,310
Rewarding the evil and punishing the good,

522
00:36:53,310 --> 00:36:57,620
such is the impermanence of nature.

523
00:36:59,410 --> 00:37:02,029
Is it my turn to make an appearance now?

524
00:37:02,029 --> 00:37:04,990
Everything shall be done in accordance with Master's arrangement.

525
00:37:35,170 --> 00:37:37,010
Ghost Valley came at just the right time.

526
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:41,179
Let's work together to destroy these ghosts!

527
00:37:41,179 --> 00:37:46,820
Their blood shall be the sacrifice for our banner!

528
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,099
Supreme Leader Gao, no true man is without cruelty.

529
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,310
What cruel methods you have.

530
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:56,819
That idiot Long-tongued Ghost has just destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect for you,

531
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,510
and now you turn around and kill him?

532
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,969
Tragicomic Ghost trapped and killed Danyang Sect's disciples.

533
00:38:01,969 --> 00:38:05,629
Happy Ghost killed Ao Laizi.

534
00:38:05,629 --> 00:38:10,290
Weren't you the one who gave all of those orders?

535
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:13,579
Gao Chong, it really was you!

536
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:14,889
You bastard!

537
00:38:14,889 --> 00:38:18,249
We agreed to divide up the armory's treasure equally after collecting the Glazed Armor.

538
00:38:18,249 --> 00:38:24,429
After you got three pieces of it, you immediately turned around and betrayed us.

539
00:38:24,429 --> 00:38:27,470
You want to destroy Ghost Valley?

540
00:38:30,279 --> 00:38:34,059
Who are you? Stop slandering me!

541
00:38:34,059 --> 00:38:37,160
A wise man won't believe in rumors! There's no use in saying more!

542
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:42,720
Do you think my Ghost Valley will let you take whoever's side you want?

543
00:38:48,890 --> 00:38:50,620
Kuan'er?

544
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:54,950
Isn't Yueyang Sect's first disciple Deng Kuan dead?

545
00:38:54,950 --> 00:38:57,070
Enough, Master.

546
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:58,139
Kuan'er!

547
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:03,129
Everyone, I am Deng Kuan, the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

548
00:39:03,129 --> 00:39:04,669
I'm not dead!

549
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:07,919
I was just kept imprisoned by Gao Chong.

550
00:39:07,919 --> 00:39:14,760
It was he who instructed me to sneak into the Mirror Lake Sect

551
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:20,260
and help Long-tongued Ghost sneak inside to extinguish the Zhang family.

552
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,549
Kuan'er, what are you talking about?

553
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:26,929
Gao Chong! You abandoned the Five Lakes Alliance!

554
00:39:26,929 --> 00:39:28,479
Such disloyalty!

555
00:39:28,479 --> 00:39:32,879
You murdered your own brothers! Such disrespect!

556
00:39:32,879 --> 00:39:37,309
You harmed the lost orphan of the Mirror Lake Sect. Such inhumanity!

557
00:39:37,309 --> 00:39:39,959
You colluded with Ghost Valley to disrupt the martial arts world.

558
00:39:39,959 --> 00:39:42,170
Such injustice!

559
00:39:42,170 --> 00:39:46,409
I assisted you in your cruel ways, I am too ashamed to live!

560
00:39:46,409 --> 00:39:49,750
I shall end my life to maintain justice!

561
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:53,200
I will die with you!

562
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,900
Kuan'er!

563
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:56,720
Senior Brother!

564
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:01,170
Senior Brother! Senior Brother!

565
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:03,860
Senior Brother!

566
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:32,499
You can't believe him! This kid is crazy!

567
00:40:32,499 --> 00:40:34,640
Kuan'er!

568
00:40:36,020 --> 00:40:39,570
Who controlled you

569
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:43,710
into wanting to kill me?

570
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,850
Old Changing, Old Changing.

571
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,980
So this is where you're making your move.

572
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:00,740
Sure enough, a dog that can bite doesn't bark.

573
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:05,310
Congratulations, you abandoned the dark and cast a bright future.

574
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:45,463
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

575
00:41:46,750 --> 00:41:53,013
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

576
00:41:53,810 --> 00:42:00,943
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

577
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:08,423
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

578
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:16,483
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

579
00:42:16,483 --> 00:42:24,073
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

580
00:42:24,073 --> 00:42:27,402
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

581
00:42:27,402 --> 00:42:31,442
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

582
00:42:31,442 --> 00:42:39,323
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

583
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:42,752
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

584
00:42:42,752 --> 00:42:46,552
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

585
00:42:46,552 --> 00:42:54,483
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

586
00:42:54,483 --> 00:42:58,012
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

587
00:42:58,012 --> 00:43:01,702
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

588
00:43:01,702 --> 00:43:08,823
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

589
00:43:08,823 --> 00:43:17,543
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
