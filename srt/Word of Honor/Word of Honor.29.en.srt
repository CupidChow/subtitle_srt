(T/N: Poem by Bai Juyi, Tang Dynasty poet)

163
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:56,290
Eldest Brother Cao, what weird things are you saying again?

164
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,990
How are you so happy every day?

165
00:12:57,990 --> 00:13:01,370
Of course, I'm happy! As long as I have you, I'm satisfied!

166
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:04,760
A'Xiang, how come I get the feeling that you're a little unhappy?

167
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:07,170
Do you miss elder brothers Zhou and Wen?

168
00:13:07,170 --> 00:13:08,710
Don't refer to them so intimately!

169
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:12,290
You copy me and call them Master and...

170
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:13,740
and...

171
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,160
A'Xiang, why are you laughing?

Look! Don't these three corn kernels look like those two with their Great Warrior Gold Bean?

175
00:13:28,050 --> 00:13:30,940
It looks just like a family! It's so cute!

176
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:34,290
A'Xiang, I haven't seen you smile this happily in a long time.

177
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:36,570
You've been unhappy during this time.

178
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:40,120
If you miss them, we can go visit Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

179
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,230
No!

180
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,760
I think... it's nice staying here.

181
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,150
I don't want to leave the mountain.

182
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:48,840
Besides, Master hasn't told me to go back.

183
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:51,620
If I made decisions on my own, he'd definitely scold me.

184
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,290
Brother Wen wouldn't scold you.

185
00:13:53,290 --> 00:13:55,280
He treats you like he would treat his own little sister.

186
00:13:55,290 --> 00:13:57,200
If we go visit, he'll only be happy.

187
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,280
He wouldn't scold you.

188

I'm just like an old auntie.

189
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,040
A'Xiang, what's troubling you?

190
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:08,410
Tell me, and I can help you.

191
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,430
Every time you sigh, my heart feels blocked and uncomfortable.

192
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:16,380
It's nothing. It's really nothing.

193

It's just... ever since I could remember,

I've never lived such peaceful days.

195
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,730
You treat me very well.

196
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:27,960
Senior and Junior Brothers also treat me very well.

197
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:30,820
I'm just a little unused to this.

198
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,460
Living in a honey jar is too nice.

282
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,800
for the prince to name this private army, Window of Heaven.

283

and don't dare to dream of great achievements.

285
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:35,760
But I ask to risk everything

286
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,880
to give this dark world a ray of light.

287
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,890

290
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:54,900
Today, we will open a window of Heaven for this dark world!

291
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:57,610
One day, I will crush the rotting seeds

292
00:21:57,620 --> 00:22:01,240
and destroy everything blocking the sun!

Ten years of blood and violence.

294
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,930
I thought that as long as a window was opened,

295
00:22:06,930 --> 00:22:09,500
there would be light outside.

296

00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:49,540
My old eyes aren't bleary enough to mix up guys and girls.

323
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:51,940
But the sect's forbidden area has—

324
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,480
What rules? It's an emergency right now, understand?

325
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:56,240
This is your Senior Brother Cao's wife!

326
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,120
Your future eldest sister-in-law!

327
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:01,230
It's not even important that she's on our side. Even if it a girl we didn't know

328
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:03,930
and she lived in the middle of the mountain, if we didn't let her in here,

329
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,790
were we supposed to just watch her get taken by those monsters?

330
00:24:06,790 --> 00:24:10,020
You inflexible little thing! You-You...

331
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:13,230
I raised you for nothing! I—

332
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:16,270
Junior Master!

333
00:24:18,810 --> 00:24:20,610
You're poisoned?

334
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:23,080
It's nothing. It's nothing. The monster...

335
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:25,450
bit me.

336
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,760
It's all right. It's all right.

337
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,360
Junior Master, this is a medicinal powder created by a friend of my master's.

338
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:35,330
It specifically combats this corpse poison. Take it.

339
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:39,160
Although this poison isn't fierce, it's hard to get rid of it completely.

340
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:42,730
Use this medicinal powder, and you'll be fine when your blood turns cherry red.

341
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:50,900
Weixu! Hurry and take the medicine.

342
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:53,290
Save your junior brothers immediately!

343
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,910
Thank you, Miss Xiang.

344
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,400
Hurry and go!

345
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,670
Junior Master.

346
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:08,180
Little A'Xiang, your master...

347
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,920
has fought with these

348
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:11,860
monsters before?

349
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:14,690
My master, unfortunately, ran into these monsters several times.

350
00:25:14,690 --> 00:25:16,320
They were originally living humans,

351
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:19,880
but they were transformed into these living dead by someone using evil witchcraft methods.

352
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,990
They have tremendous power and don't feel pain.

353
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:26,190
But they're pretty stupid. Their claws are poisonous, so we have to be careful.

354
00:25:26,190 --> 00:25:28,710
Practicing witchcraft on living humans?

355
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,360
This Ghost Valley...

356
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,620
can do such malicious things?

357
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:38,940
Are they-Are they not afraid of punishment from the heavens?

358
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:40,710
Ghost Valley?

359
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,710
Who said Ghost Valley created these monsters?

360
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:50,460
Last night, the four top ghosts gathered

361
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,160
to ambush us but were forced back by senior sect members.

362
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,630
We were discussing countermeasures,

363
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:59,280
but who would've thought, large amounts of monsters

364
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:02,260
massacred their way up the mountain.

365
00:26:07,040 --> 00:26:10,130
This Ghost Valley raised

366
00:26:10,130 --> 00:26:12,260
such a devilish army.

367
00:26:13,090 --> 00:26:16,360
These evil devils who call themselves ghosts

368
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,790
already cannot be considered as human.

369
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:24,320
Little A'Xiang, don't be scared.

370
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:28,800
This place has been used by generations of forefathers from the Gentle Wind Mountain for calm meditation.

371
00:26:28,800 --> 00:26:31,220
It's hidden deep within the mountain. The monsters

372
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,760
can't reach this place.

373
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:41,320
Junior Master... where's my master?

374
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,670
Where did my master go?

375
00:26:43,670 --> 00:26:45,420
Why don't I see my master?

376
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,920
Junior Master!

377
00:26:46,920 --> 00:26:50,390
Master escorted us up the mountain. I saw Master

378
00:26:50,390 --> 00:26:52,890
rush into the Drug Men army by himself.

379
00:26:52,890 --> 00:26:56,530
And then... and then he disappeared.

380
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,300
Your words are as ominous as a crow's! What are you even saying?

381
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:01,890
- Impossible. This can't be.
- Weining,

382
00:27:01,890 --> 00:27:03,950
don't listen to that brat's nonsense.

383
00:27:03,950 --> 00:27:06,940
Our senior brother, the sect leader, has extremely strong martial arts. How could these devilish clowns

384
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:09,160
do anything to him?

385
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:14,190
Senior Sect Leader must've wanted to capture the leader first to crumble the rest of the army.

386
00:27:14,190 --> 00:27:17,430
He must have fought down the mountain to go ask for help!

387
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:18,720
It's fine, it's fine.

388
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,760
"Capture the leader first to crumble the rest of the army"?

389
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,780
The four top ghosts have gathered.

390
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,040
That Ghost Leader, Wen Kexing,

391
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,390
probably came as well.

392
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:31,920
As long as Senior Sect Leader

393
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:35,300
kills that monster—

394
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:42,520
Junior Master... you just said

395
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:46,630
Ghost Valley Leader... Wen what?

396
00:27:51,150 --> 00:27:53,260
Ghost Valley Leader

397
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,420
Wen Kexing.

398
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:21,270
Grandmaster, Young Junior Master, Brother Han,

399
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:24,520
and all the ancestors of Four Season Mountain Villa. Please protect us.

400
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:29,220
We will definitely turn danger into fortune and leave safely.

401
00:28:51,130 --> 00:28:52,720
Stop right there!

402
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,070
You can't run anymore, can you?

403
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:59,560
Don't come over here!

404
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,530
Hold him down!

405
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:02,950
Good dog, hurry and run!

406
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:05,840
Run home to find Mother!

407
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,060
Zhen One Pot?

408
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:11,660
Let me go!

409
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,100
Thank you.

410
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:28,550
Little boy, is your surname Zhen?

411
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:33,650
My surname isn't Zhen. You have the wrong person.

412
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,700
Don't be scared, little boy.

413
00:29:37,380 --> 00:29:39,450
I'm your Uncle Zhao.

414
00:29:39,450 --> 00:29:42,180
Zhao Jing from the Lake Tai Sword Sect.

415
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,620
I'm good friends with your mother and father,

416
00:29:48,090 --> 00:29:52,800
Ruyu and Miaomiao. They must have mentioned me to you before, right?

417
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:02,920
Mother! I met Uncle Zhao Jing!

418
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,730
Mother! I met Uncle Zhao Jing.

419
00:30:11,730 --> 00:30:14,650
Uncle Zhao of the Five Lakes Alliance.

420
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,620
Mother, come look.

421
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:20,660
This is the candied hawthorn stick that Uncle Zhao bought for me. It's delicious.

422
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:24,140
A'Jing? It's you?

423
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:26,360
Be careful.

424
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,230
Second Brother Zhao, please sit.

425
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:32,190
Take a seat! Come on!

426
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:37,460
Yan'er, go play outside.

427
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:39,890
Us adults have things to talk about.

428
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:54,290
Why have you become like this?

429
00:30:58,510 --> 00:31:00,750
Senior Brother, you talk first with Second Brother Zhao.

430
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,760
I'll go make some tea.

431
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:04,450
All right.

432
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,760
Do you want to eat some?

433
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:12,040
I'm not sharing!

434
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:22,070
Zhao Jing! You've finally given yourself away!

435
00:31:22,070 --> 00:31:26,090
I knew it! I knew it was you!

436
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,520
Sister-in-Law, why is your temper still so fiery?

437
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,740
Elder Brother Rong and his wife are no longer with us.

438
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:37,520
The Rong family has no successor. If we don't open the armory,

439
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:41,240
are we supposed to waste everyone's hard work?

440
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:45,210
Stop pretending. How exactly did Elder Brother Rong die?

441
00:31:45,210 --> 00:31:48,690
How could Eldest Brother Gao Chong have something as wicked as Three Corpse Poison?

442
00:31:48,690 --> 00:31:52,670
Only you. Only you lowlife!

443
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,330
Right. I am a lowlife.

444
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,900
Scum! So what?

445
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,290
Am I not the dominant one, while you all are suppressed?

446
00:32:08,290 --> 00:32:12,320
Give me the key and I will leave immediately.

447
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:15,390
We won't meet again.

448
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,190
Or else...

449
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:20,390
Or else what?

450
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:23,600
Or else...

451
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,310
- You brute!
- Zhao Jing!

452
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:28,960
Senior Brother! Senior Brother.

453
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,290
What are you going to do?

454
00:32:33,570 --> 00:32:37,260
Ruyu, think carefully.

455
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,790
The armory has the Yin Yang Book.

456
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,400
Give me the key.

457
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:47,900
I promise you. After I open the armory,

458
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:51,600
I'll gift you the Yin Yang Book to heal your arms and legs.

459
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,100
At that time, you'll still be the universally respected Miracle Healer.

460
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:57,600
You won't ever have to take your wife and son

461
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:01,000
and hide in this poor place under disguise.

462
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:07,600
Ruyu, even if you don't consider this for yourself,

463
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:11,200
you should consider your child.

464
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,600
Second Brother Zhao, think about yourself first.

465
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:24,300
You just used internal force. Don't you think there's something wrong?

466
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:34,400
Malicious woman! You poisoned the tea?

467
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:38,900
Poison and medicine are one and the same. You underestimated our Miracle Healer Valley far too much.

468
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,400
Ruyu's martial arts are gone.

469
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:45,400
As a weak woman, I must be able to protect myself.

470
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:59,600
Give me the antidote, and we can discuss anything.

471
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,700
Sure, Second Brother Zhao.

472
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,300
Second Brother Zhao, eat up.

473
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:11,400
Once this poison acts up, it'll be like thousands of bugs eating your body.

474
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,400
You'll die from organ injuries.

475
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,000
We've known each other for a long time, after all. I'm not willing to let you suffer like that.

476
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,700
There's three months of antidote in the bottle.

477
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:24,800
I'm not done talking. Once this poison starts acting, it can't be cured completely.

478
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,800
If my family were still here,

479
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:32,600
Second Brother Zhao could come and visit us every once in a while. Or else...

480
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:51,500
Have a nice trip, Second Brother, I won't be seeing you to the door.

481
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,300
- Father!
- Yan'er...

482
00:35:02,300 --> 00:35:04,200
Mother, what's wrong?

483
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:08,000
Uncle Zhao is a bad person?

484
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,200
I shouldn't have brought him home.

485
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:12,200
I'm sorry!

486
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,400
Mother! Hit me!

487
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Junior Master! Junior Master!

488
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,400
- It's me.
- Junior Master, what's wrong?

489
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,700
- It's me.
- Junior Master.

490
00:35:24,700 --> 00:35:27,000
- I'm going to kill him!
- Junior Master!

491
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,700
- I'll kill him!
- Junior Master!

492
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,000
Wu Xi, how's the situation?

493
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,200
I've checked many times.
[Great Shaman]

494
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,600
Among the ruins,

495
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,800
[Lord Seventh: Jing Beiyuan]

496
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,300
there was only the charred corpse of a man.

497
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,300
Impossible. I must see for myself.

498
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:03,800
Beiyuan!

499
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,000
I've already told A'Qin Lai

500
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,500
to bury that person.

501
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,400
Wu Xi, you don't understand.

502
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:17,800
Zishu couldn't have died just like this. The prince wouldn't kill him either.

503
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,200
Beiyuan!

504
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:22,000
Who doesn't understand?

505
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,800
He can order someone to kill you. Why can't he kill Lord Zhou?

506
00:36:25,800 --> 00:36:27,200
No.

507
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,000
Since Zishu has left the Window of Heaven, he must have former subordinates following him.

508
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:36,000
Moreover, he has his second junior brother and disciple.

509
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,300
How can you deduce that it was his body?

510
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,100
Beiyuan...

511
00:36:45,300 --> 00:36:47,800
I never told you.

512
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,600
The old members of Four Seasons Mountain Villa

513
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:55,800
had long been killed by Prince Jin.

514
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,900
It was because of this that Lord Zhou left the Window of Heaven and traveled the world.

515
00:37:03,590 --> 00:37:05,890
Don't blame Ping An.

516
00:37:08,100 --> 00:37:09,800
I decided to keep it a secret.

517
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:12,200
Wu Xi... You—

518
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,200
- Let go of me!
- Junior Master!

519
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:17,400
- Let go of me!
- Junior Master!
- Let's move.

520
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,200
- Let go of me! Let go of me!
- Junior Master!

521
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,000
- Junior Master!
- I'm going to kill him!

522
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:24,400
Let go of me!

523
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,900
Junior Master...

524
00:37:26,600 --> 00:37:27,800
- Junior Master!
- Let go of me!

525
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,000
- Junior Master!
- I'm going to kill him!

526
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:32,400
- Junior Master!
- I'm going to kill him!

527
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,800
Is-Isn't that Lord Zhou's disciple?

528
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,800
I'm going to kill him!

529
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,000
- I'm going to kill you!
- Junior Master!

530
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,800
I'm going to kill you!

531
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,200
Junior Master!

532
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:46,800
Young Master Zhang! Y-Young Master Zhang.

533
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,600
Brother Ping An? Brother Ping An.

534
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,800
This is our Lord Seventh and Great Shaman.

535
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,800
Where's Lord Zhou?

536
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,800
Don't be scared, child. I am a lifelong friend of your master.

537
00:37:56,800 --> 00:37:59,400
You can tell me anything. We can think of ideas together.

538
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:02,800
Lord Seventh, my master was captured by the Window of Heaven.

539
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:06,200
My Junior Master is going mad. Please go save him!

540
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:10,600
I'm going to kill you!

541
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,600
Sir! Concentrate your breathing! You're losing control!

542
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,300
I'm going to kill you!

543
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
Sir, we are old friends of Zhou Zishu!

544
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:30,500
A'Xu... where is he?

545
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,260
Junior Master!

546
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,900
What did you do to my junior master?

547
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,300
He's all right.

548
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:42,400
He's just too tired. Let him rest a bit.

549
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:23,800
You must be starving.

550
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:27,200
Here, this is the portion Junior Master set aside for you. Hurry and eat.

551
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:35,100
Junior Brother. Miss Xiang.

552
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,820
What's wrong?

553
00:39:38,770 --> 00:39:40,430
Nothing.

554
00:39:42,770 --> 00:39:46,740
Look at the situation. You choose this time to fight?

555
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:53,740
Senior Brother, what's the situation outside?

556
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:58,000
They aren't able to make it in,

557
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,200
but we can't leave either. The food in the hole is running low as well.

558
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:09,000
What is Junior Master's plan? If we stay trapped for another two days, we'll be too hungry to lift our swords.

559
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,800
By that time, even if we wanted to risk our lives to fight, there would be no way.

560
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:15,400
If that's so, it's better to leave

561
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:18,000
and risk our lives against those monsters. Each one we kill counts.

562
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,100
Weining! You have to remain calm.

563
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,900
Master's martial arts is godly.

564
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:27,000
Those monsters outside can't trap him. We haven't heard from him since,

565
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,400
so I think he must have fought it out to call for reinforcements.

566
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Junior Master said

567
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:35,400
we will wait one more day and night.

568
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:37,300
If there is still no news,

569
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:39,400
we will leave and risk our lives.

570
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:41,800
By that time, you must do everything you can to protect A'Xiang.

571
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:43,700
Run away from here.

572
00:40:55,900 --> 00:40:56,800
Senior Brother...

573
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:59,300
This is Junior Master's decision.

574
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:02,500
Our Gentle Wind Sword Sect's succession of hundreds of years

575
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:05,200
cannot be ruined in our hands.

576
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:10,000
Anyways, we can't drag in A'Xiang, an outsider.

577
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,000
We can't have her lose her life for us. Since her master is a skilled master,

578
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,200
at that time, take the secret arts passed down by our ancestors

579
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:20,000
to ask for his protection.

580
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:23,000
Elder Brother Mo, don't say anymore.

581
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,000
I'm not going anywhere.

582
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:29,800
You can't go back on your word now. Saying I'm an outsider.

583
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,400
Since I'm here,

584
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:35,400
if we are to risk our lives, then I will do the same.

585
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,800
Elder Brother Mo, don't look down on me because I'm a girl.

586
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:41,800
I've probably killed more people than you.

587
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:26,900
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

588
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:34,300
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

589
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:42,390
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

590
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:49,400
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

591
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:57,000
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

592
00:42:57,900 --> 00:43:05,200
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

593
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:13,000
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river but can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

594
00:43:13,000 --> 00:43:20,800
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

595
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,160
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

596
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:27,900
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

597
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:36,000
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

598
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:39,380
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

599
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:43,200
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

600
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:50,200
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

601
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:58,000
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
