00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:21,090
I advise you to take note of the situation

166
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:23,930
and tell me where the Glazed Armor is.

167
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,690
Lest you suffer from torture wounds.

168
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,269
Tomboy,

169
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:38,690
why are you so unable to act tenderly?

170
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:44,709
If a cute little boy like him suffers from flesh wounds,

171
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:47,050
he won't be handsome anymore.

172
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:52,030
Little boy, does it hurt?

173
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,390
Do you want me to blow on it?

174
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:04,990
You disgusting woman, don't touch me!

175
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:07,290
I insist on it.

176
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:30,770
Those dogs are following so closely.

177
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:33,650
Why aren't the three of them coming to my aid?

178
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:37,270
Where did your friends take him?

179
00:14:42,790 --> 00:14:44,490
Are you going to tell me yourself

180
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:48,990
or do you want me to squeeze the answer out of you?

181
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:02,190
Little boy, can you tell us now?

182
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,870
Just kill me!

183
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,970
You want to die before telling us where the Glazed Armor is?

184
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:10,370
Baby, killing you would be doing you a favor.

185
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:14,650
I have over one hundred ways that are even more overwhelming than death.

186
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,590
Are you done or not?

187
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:19,070
Coquettish wench.

188
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,210
Master doesn't have the patience for you to use all one hundred methods.

189
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:31,150
This boy looks weak,

190
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,730
but he's quite stubborn.

191
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:40,330
Are you forcing me to use my real powers?

192
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:42,650
He's such a young brat.

193
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,290
If you accidentally kill him, the two of us will end up buried right next to him.

194
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:49,070
Leave him.

195
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:51,210
Let me do it.

196
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:54,089
Go and see why it's taking so long for Monster Jiang

197
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,310
to meet with Old Qin. He's still not back yet.

198
00:15:56,310 --> 00:15:57,550
I'm not going.

199
00:15:57,550 --> 00:16:00,850
I don't care whether or not those two old men live or die.

200
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:07,690
I want to see whether or not you have actual skill.

201
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,070
Then bring me a pail of water

202
00:16:15,070 --> 00:16:17,870
and a stack of rice paper.

203
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:32,910
Your hand for playing pipa is now destroyed.

204
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:37,190
I met another tough man before

205
00:16:37,190 --> 00:16:39,710
and asked him the same question.

206
00:16:39,710 --> 00:16:41,850
He also didn't dare to answer.

207
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:46,290
I had no choice but to go inch by inch,

208
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,820
crushing each and every one of the bones throughout his body.

209
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:54,730
Gradually, I squeezed the answer out of him.

210
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:58,850
My father told me

211
00:16:58,850 --> 00:17:03,350
that the human body contains 206 bones in total.

212
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,050
If I remember correctly, I had gotten to the 80th bone

213
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,540
when that tough man confessed.

214
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:16,420
Qin Song... Tell me right now!

215
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:20,370
Where did your friends kidnap him to!

216
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,389
How is it?

217
00:17:51,389 --> 00:17:54,370
I don't need your showy but ineffective messing around.

218
00:17:54,370 --> 00:17:57,489
A pail of water and a stack of paper.

219
00:17:57,490 --> 00:18:02,990
I have yet to meet a man who can withstand this water torture!

220
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:08,390
I admire you. I admire you, Tomboy.

221
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:10,810
This goes to show that one cannot be successful without being vicious.

222
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:14,530
Compared to you, I'm truly not as skilled.

223
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:18,050
Now what, are you willing to tell us?

224
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,690
I'll tell you.

225
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:25,890
The Glazed Armor... Glazed Armor...

226
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,790
What did you say?

227
00:18:35,630 --> 00:18:38,550
What other torture methods have you got? Use them all.

228
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,430
Let's see whether or not I can bear them.

229
00:18:40,430 --> 00:18:43,009
My father is the Great Warrior of Mirror Lake, Zhang Yusen.

230
00:18:43,010 --> 00:18:45,770
None of his sons is a coward!

231
00:18:53,450 --> 00:18:54,650
Who are you?

232
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:56,449
You dare attack the Four Assassins?

233
00:18:56,450 --> 00:19:00,550
You bunch of stinky scorpions don't deserve to know my name.

234
00:19:00,550 --> 00:19:02,950
You know about the Venomous Scorpions?

235
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:06,709
I do. I am your ancestor!

236
00:19:17,350 --> 00:19:19,050
Master!

237
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:43,089
Why did you come back alone? Where is Old Qin?

238
00:19:43,090 --> 00:19:44,550
I couldn't find Old Qin!

239
00:19:44,550 --> 00:19:46,169
These damned nail wounds.

240
00:19:46,169 --> 00:19:47,710
No, I don't have the power to drag out this battle.

241
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:48,909
I need to end it as soon as possible.

242
00:19:48,909 --> 00:19:50,010
Why is this bastard here?

243
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,690
Stop talking. Kill him first!

244
00:20:06,850 --> 00:20:08,550
Master!

245
00:20:09,370 --> 00:20:11,270
Who are you?

246
00:20:11,270 --> 00:20:15,029
Since you know about Venomous Scorpions, you must also know

247
00:20:15,029 --> 00:20:18,309
that when the Scorpion King wants to kill people or obtain items,

248
00:20:18,309 --> 00:20:20,850
no one is able to stop him.

249
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,550
What a coincidence.

250
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:28,529
No one can stop me from killing who I want

251
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:31,250
and getting what I want either.

252
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,950
Monster Jiang!

253
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,170
Master!

254
00:20:47,170 --> 00:20:50,230
Don't worry, I'm here.

255
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:53,629
He is almost tired out. Let's attack together!

256
00:20:53,629 --> 00:20:54,909
Capture him alive.

257
00:20:54,909 --> 00:20:58,969
I'm going to get my sweet revenge for Qin Song and Monster Jiang.

258
00:20:58,970 --> 00:21:00,790
Handsome boy,

259
00:21:00,790 --> 00:21:06,290
let me show you what it feels like to want to die more than to live.

260
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:28,510
Uncle Wen!

261
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:43,929
Who hurt you?

262
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,650
Uncle Wen, they kidnapped me

263
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,750
and hurt my master.

264
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:53,010
No need to follow them.

265
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,310
Getting Chengling out of here is more urgent.

266
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,449
No.

267
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:00,670
I will shred whoever hurt you to pieces!

268
00:22:04,730 --> 00:22:06,330
Let's go.

269
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:25,800
Master. What... What are those?

270
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:27,700
Don't be afraid.

271
00:22:27,700 --> 00:22:29,600
Take Chengling and leave.

272
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,400
It's fine if you don't leave.

273
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,100
Dying together with you is also a fine ending.

274
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,000
Who wants to die with you?

275
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:44,400
You live and die together.

276
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,300
You have such a refined mindset.

277
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,560
Glad to have you,

278
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:07,200
and apologies for not welcoming you earlier.

279
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:11,419
These two bastards were the ones who killed Old Jiang and immobilized Old Qin!

280
00:23:11,419 --> 00:23:13,360
You're the ones who were weaker.

281
00:23:13,360 --> 00:23:17,440
You disgraced me, but you have the shamelessness to mention it?

282
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:22,360
Leader Zhou, are you not going to introduce me

283
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:26,679
to your friend in life and death?

284
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,039
Who are you?

285
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,520
Why send people to kidnap Chengling?

286
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:36,240
You want to know who I am? I can tell you,

287
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,559
but you have to tell me who you are first.

288
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,780
How about we make a bet?

289
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:47,740
The person who loses must tell the person who wins

290
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:51,040
his true identity.

291
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:54,300
He's even more talkative than you.

292
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,960
Your Majesty, who are they?

293
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,120
One is the leader of the Window of Heaven,

294
00:24:14,120 --> 00:24:15,559
and the other is the chief of the ghosts.

295
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,460
Chief of ghosts?

296
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,200
How did those two devils

297
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,720
end up together?

298
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:34,233
[Profound Expectations]

299
00:24:34,233 --> 00:24:35,900
Eldest Brother.

300
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:40,900
Everything's fine. Don't let anxiety ruin your health.

301
00:24:40,900 --> 00:24:43,799
The Four Assassins definitely took the risk to kidnap Chengling

302
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:46,039
in order to force him to reveal the whereabouts of the Glazed Armor.

303
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:48,079
As long as Chengling doesn't say anything,

304
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,760
his life shouldn't be in danger.

305
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,660
Enough!

306
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:59,219
Master. Uncle Wen. You both came to save me.

307
00:24:59,219 --> 00:25:01,440
Sister Xiang indeed didn't lie to me.

308
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,840
You didn't leave me behind!

309
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,040
Little idiot,

310
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:09,239
you call me Uncle Wen and him Master.

311
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,439
You make it sound like I'm younger than him.
(T/N: There are two ways of saying "Uncle" in Chinese, Shūshu- for those who are younger than father/master, and bóbo- for the older. He's using the former)

312
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,920
Am I not older than you?

313
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:19,340
The Four Assassins tortured you like that, and yet you didn't even cry.

314
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,999
How come only after seeing us did you start crying?

315
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,000
Enough, enough. Act like a strong man!

316
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,700
They tortured me, but I'd rather die than give in.

317
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:29,440
Only after I saw you, did I...

318
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,340
Master. Uncle Wen.

319
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:34,260
I have so, so many things to tell you!

320
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,740
Smells delicious.

321
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,340
A'Xu.

322
00:25:49,060 --> 00:25:51,360
Chengling, you're hungry. Right?

323
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,060
You eat first.

324
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:59,100
Master, I know that only you guys are sincerely kind to me.

325
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:03,340
Little idiot, don't your uncles treat you well, too?

326
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:06,419
I heard that Gao Chong even wanted to betroth his only daughter to you.

327
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,160
I don't have a daughter, just an A'Xiang.

328
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,680
I don't really care, but I'm afraid you won't be able to handle her.

329
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,080
They just want me to hand over the Glazed Armor.

330
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,860
No one has ever actually cared about me

331
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,920
or my family's vendetta.

332
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:24,280
In the beginning,

333
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,740
I thought they actually saw me as their nephew.

334
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:29,180
Only later on did I realize

335
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:34,240
that they never even treated my father as a real brother, so how could I become one of their own?

336
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,600
Little idiot, what do you mean?

337
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,420
Uncle Gao isn't worried about getting revenge at all.

338
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:44,259
Instead, he's using that as an excuse to carry on with his Heroes Conference.

339
00:26:44,259 --> 00:26:48,240
Ever since I came to the Yueyang Sect, nobody truly cared about me

340
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,980
or asked me what I wanted.

341
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,700
Then, what do you want?

342
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,400
I want to learn martial arts.

343
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,300
I want to personally exact revenge.

344
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't want to be a useless child anymore,

345
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,680
waiting for others to sacrifice themselves to protect me.

346
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:03,700
I also want the lineage of the Mirror Lake Sect to continue.

347
00:27:03,700 --> 00:27:07,440
That is the wish of my father and brothers.

348
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:11,540
Chengling, you've become so suspicious of the Five Lakes Alliance.

349
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:13,759
Is this because something happened that we don't know about?

350
00:27:13,759 --> 00:27:15,780
Are you willing to tell us?

351
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,520
Eat first. There's no rush to tell us.

352
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:23,940
No. Master. Uncle Wen.

353
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:28,060
The day of my family's murder,

354
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,780
my father didn't have enough time to tell me much.

355
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,240
He only gave me one piece of advice.

356
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:37,680
"Never trust anyone, no one is trustworthy."

357
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:41,520
But Master and Uncle Wen, I trust you!

358
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:46,280
Foolish child. Don't hastily trust anyone.

359
00:27:46,280 --> 00:27:50,220
Master, I should've trusted you from the beginning.

360
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,160
Back then, the fisherman

361
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,960
didn't know about the resentment between my father and the Five Lakes Alliance,

362
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,280
so he wanted to take me to Uncle Zhao Jing.

363
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:01,880
I didn't know what to do and whom to believe.

364
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,380
Master, I'm sorry.

365
00:28:04,380 --> 00:28:07,000
I should've trusted you from the beginning.

366
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,340
The Glazed Armor is with me right now.

367
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:15,140
My father was in a rush,

368
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:17,959
and thus he cut my stomach open and hid the Glazed Armor in it.

369
00:28:17,959 --> 00:28:20,979
The wound healed, and it's been inside me since.

370
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:23,340
I'll take it out for you now!

371
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:27,180
Little idiot, did I ever say I wanted it?

372
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,760
Little idiot, why are you in a rush?

373
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,800
You should talk slower and take the time to get to know someone.

374
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:36,540
Your father must've been so careful because he guessed

375
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:40,460
that even if Old Li safely brought you to his brothers in the Five Lakes Alliance,

376
00:28:40,460 --> 00:28:42,920
they would still carefully search you.

377
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:47,320
It seems like he lost trust in his sworn brothers a long time ago.

378
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,560
Yes. Other people don't know,

379
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:53,140
but they've been at odds for many years.

380
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:56,680
Do you know why he fell out with his brothers?

381
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:59,960
I know. He gave me a letter.

382
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,900
Where is the letter?

383
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:06,620
I... hid it under the Buddha statue in the dilapidated temple.

384
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:11,560
I thought you were an idiot, but who knew you were quite scheming?

385
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:15,380
You even managed to hide it in that situation?

386
00:29:15,380 --> 00:29:18,500
My father said that aside from being given to the receiver,

387
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:20,960
this letter cannot fall into the hands of anyone else.

388
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:25,380
I didn't know what to do at the time, so I hid it after I pretended that I needed to go to the bathroom.

389
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:28,420
I figured that if worse comes to worst,

390
00:29:28,420 --> 00:29:31,341
I can at least tell the receiver in person.

391
00:29:31,341 --> 00:29:35,100
Who is the receiver? Do you remember what the letter said?

392
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:38,400
The letter is for the Sword Immortal Elder of Changming Mountain.

393
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,000
The main idea of the letter was

394
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:42,319
that the Five Lakes brothers, Gao, Zhao, Lu, Zhang, and Shen

395
00:29:42,319 --> 00:29:44,680
were all good friends with Rong Xuan, Uncle Rong Xuan.

396
00:29:44,680 --> 00:29:49,360
Uncle Rong became evil because of a mistake the five of them made.

397
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:53,239
Once, the six of them had a sword battle after arguing over the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

398
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:57,100
Uncle Rong won the battle, but he was heavily poisoned

399
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,860
which made him go insane.

400
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:05,220
The reason was that someone poisoned the blade.

401
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:06,700
And then?

402
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:08,499
Then, Uncle Rong became possessed and went crazy.

403
00:30:08,500 --> 00:30:11,620
The five of them should have been responsible,

404
00:30:11,620 --> 00:30:13,899
but when Uncle Rong was attacked by all of the martial artists in the world,

405
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,100
no one stood up for him.

406
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:19,419
My father was going to rush to Mount Qingya

407
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:21,780
and fight to the death with Uncle Rong.

408
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:24,940
However, his master broke his legs and locked him up

409
00:30:24,940 --> 00:30:26,880
until it was too late.

410
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,340
He could only live in regret until the end of his life.

411
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:30,439
Who was the one that put poison on his sword?

412
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:33,060
I... I don't know.

413
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:35,400
But the sword belonged to Uncle Gao.

[Late Brother Zhang Yusen's memorial tablet]

I waited in pain for twenty years

just waiting for the entire truth to reveal itself in the end,

420

Those are just false titles!

425
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,840
I explained to them,

426
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:24,360
but who can understand what I'm truly thinking?

Shut up.

The Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded.

How did the Four Assassins kidnap you?

461
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:41,000
I... I received a letter

462
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,340
which told me to go for a chat at the lotus pond at 11:00 p.m.

463
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:46,560
Sister Xiang helped me avoid the guards along the way.

464
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:50,579
Master, I only believed the letter because it was signed with a "Xu."

465
00:35:50,579 --> 00:35:52,580
Was it not from you?

466
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:55,180
Of course not.

467
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,440
The world is dangerous right now.

00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:02,080
The Yueyang Sect is the safest place for you to stay.

Is your internal injury acting up again?

470

Internal injury? What injury?

471
00:36:10,659 --> 00:36:13,360
Master, what's wrong?

472
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:35,939
- Right.
- If it wasn't for this internal injury, how would I get a chance

473
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:38,240
to serve a master like A'Xu?

474
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:43,199
Chengling, did you know that when I first saw your master,

475
00:36:43,199 --> 00:36:46,699
I could tell he had transformed his appearance

476
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:49,440
just by looking at his exceptional build?

477
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:52,040
Underneath the mask of a sick man

478
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:54,100
must be a world-class master.

479
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:56,120
Nonsensical boasting.

480
00:36:56,120 --> 00:36:57,960
How am I boasting?

481
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:02,200
My skill at recognizing people's strengths just by looking at their build is truly unparalleled.

482
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,920
Uncle Wen, you're so cool.

483
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:07,820
I was never able to figure out that Master transformed his appearance.

484
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:12,980
I've never misjudged anyone in my life.

485
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:17,760
Many years ago, I saw a dead body.

486
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:22,000
The hair was a mess, and the face covered in blood.

487
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:25,600
A long spear was stuck from the front of its chest all the way to its back.

488
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:29,460
I examined the shape of the shoulder blades a few extra times

489
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:33,560
and was able to determine that before this person's death, she was definitely of unmatched beauty.

490
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,580
Guess what happened after?

491
00:37:37,580 --> 00:37:40,580
We should let the past stay in the past.

492
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:43,820
Please accept my condolences.

493
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:50,360
Old Wen, who are you really?

494
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,280
Who am I?

495
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:57,660
I am Philanthropist Wen,

496
00:37:57,660 --> 00:38:01,080
doing kind deeds for good karma, and pitying the poor and the weak.

497
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:05,200
I possess so much kindness, money, and beauties.

498
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:10,200
Ten thousand beauties can pass by me, and I would take one thousand.

499
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:14,220
Master, drink some to cleanse yourself.

500
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:34,500
Chengling, do you sincerely want me to be your master?

501
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,720
Yes, Master.

502
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:38,680
You and I are only strangers who met by chance,

503
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:43,079
yet you trust me so much that I can only repay you with sincerity.

504
00:38:43,670 --> 00:38:49,430
However, please listen to me explain to you who I really am before making your decision.

505
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:53,690
My real name is Zhou Zishu.

506
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:57,310
I am the current leader of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

507
00:38:57,850 --> 00:39:00,710
and also the last.

508
00:39:00,710 --> 00:39:05,870
The previous leader, Qin Huaizhang, was my beloved master.

509
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:09,990
Our clan used to be well known for our flowers that blossomed in all four seasons,

510
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:13,790
and for knowing everything in the world.

511
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,571
However, nowadays, there are not many people left in the martial arts world

512
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:21,510
who know the name, "Four Seasons Manor."

513
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,250
It was all because of a momentary mistake and my incapability.

514
00:39:28,330 --> 00:39:32,910
When I was 16, my master suddenly passed away from illness.

515
00:39:33,970 --> 00:39:37,870
I didn't have the power to protect the reputation of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa from falling,

516
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:40,289
so I took the skilled disciples of our clan

517
00:39:40,289 --> 00:39:43,710
to follow the Jin Military Governor, whom the Zhou family had served for generations,

518
00:39:43,710 --> 00:39:47,870
and founded the Window of Heaven.

519
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:52,490
I didn't expect...

520
00:39:52,490 --> 00:39:55,670
that all of my fellow disciples who followed me from the Mountain Villa

521
00:39:55,670 --> 00:39:58,770
would become slaves to power.

522
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:04,010
All eighty-one of the previous followers of the Mountain Villa

523
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,270
slowly died one by one,

524
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:09,590
until when I was the only one left.

525
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:14,370
"Leader Zhou" refers to the leader of the Window of Heaven.

526
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,050
Yes.

527
00:40:17,650 --> 00:40:20,410
This is why the Venomous Scorpions know me

528
00:40:20,930 --> 00:40:23,430
and how I know where their base is.

529
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:25,330
Master.

530
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:29,090
Venomous Scorpions... what are the Venomous Scorpions?

531
00:40:29,850 --> 00:40:32,950
They're an assassin organization.

532
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:37,950
They are rooted in Jiangnan. They are very complicated and intricate, and they are highly secretive.

533
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:39,949
The Four Assassins who kidnapped you

534
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:42,410
are one of Venomous Scorpion's trump cards.

535
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,870
However, that is not the extent of their power.

536
00:40:45,870 --> 00:40:50,610
Previously, the Window of Heaven wanted to spread our presence to Jiangnan,

537
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:53,130
which led us into having some conflicts with the Venomous Scorpions.

538
00:40:53,130 --> 00:40:55,529
Its power in Jiangnan

539
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:57,369
is no less than the Window of Heaven's power in the Northwest.

540
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:02,210
Then... is your Window of Heaven also an assassin organization?

541
00:41:03,850 --> 00:41:06,530
It's not my Window of Heaven anymore.

542
00:41:07,610 --> 00:41:12,310
Now, I am just a normal person.

543
00:41:14,050 --> 00:41:16,090
I spent half of my life drifting alone,

544
00:41:16,090 --> 00:41:19,430
doing things against my will and killing people I didn't want to.

545
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:22,630
I wanted to wander the world until I died,

546
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:26,410
but it seems like the heavens have other plans

547
00:41:26,410 --> 00:41:28,970
for my destiny.

548
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,090
Now that you know who I am,

549
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,350
are you still willing to make me your master?

550
00:41:35,350 --> 00:41:37,409
I am! Of course I am!

551
00:41:37,409 --> 00:41:39,369
Master, regardless of whether or not you accept me,

552
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:42,850
my heart was already set. You are my master!

553
00:41:48,070 --> 00:41:52,070
Little idiot, since your heart is set, hurry up and finish the formalities.

554
00:41:52,070 --> 00:41:54,689
Kowtow. Hurry up.

555
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:58,030
Master, please accept my bow.

556
00:42:01,490 --> 00:42:04,890
All right. Now that you are in the clan,

557
00:42:04,890 --> 00:42:07,630
you are the first disciple of the sixth generation.

558
00:42:07,630 --> 00:42:11,649
With a superb disciple like you, the heritage of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa will live on.

559
00:42:11,649 --> 00:42:13,670
I, your master,

560
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,110
am very happy.

561
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,070
Thank you, Master.

562
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:20,230
Master, I'm very happy, too.

563
00:42:20,230 --> 00:42:22,370
Very, very happy!

564
00:43:02,278 --> 00:43:08,600
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

565
00:43:09,978 --> 00:43:16,044
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

566
00:43:17,155 --> 00:43:24,278
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

567
00:43:24,278 --> 00:43:31,989
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

568
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:39,744
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

569
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:47,244
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

570
00:43:47,244 --> 00:43:51,254
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

571
00:43:51,254 --> 00:43:54,810
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

572
00:43:54,810 --> 00:44:02,654
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

573
00:44:02,654 --> 00:44:06,099
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

574
00:44:06,099 --> 00:44:09,777
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

575
00:44:09,777 --> 00:44:17,744
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

576
00:44:17,744 --> 00:44:21,343
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

577
00:44:21,343 --> 00:44:25,043
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

578
00:44:25,043 --> 00:44:32,089
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

579
00:44:32,089 --> 00:44:41,078
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
