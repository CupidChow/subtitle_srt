23
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,400
Master, let's eat here. This restaurant is good!

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,900
Kindhearted Young Master. Beautiful Young Master's wife.

25
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,400
Please give some food. Take some pity!

26
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:18,800
Thank you, Young Master!

27
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,600
This old man wishes you two

28
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:23,200
to be together until old, and have lovely children as soon as possible!

29
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,500
Hey, stop speaking nonsense!

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
Here you go!

31
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,000
It seems like people within the same family acquire the same qualities.

32
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
A'Xiang, didn't you say

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,800
those who perform philanthropy are all big idiots?

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,500
Who... changed you?

35
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,400
You aren't a good person!

36
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,800
Master, let's go!

37
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,400
Brother Zhou, I'm sorry about that.

38
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:48,200
A'Xiang just has a sharp tongue but is soft-hearted.

39
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,600
Sir Zhou, please don't make fun of her.

Don't celebrate too early.

Just look at your Uncle Wen. That face...

43
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,600
is even longer than a donkey's.

44
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,600
Young Master Cao, there's a tough battle

Why are you still hanging around with this idiot?

00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:31,100
Aren't you still with those two idiots as well?

49
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:39,400
Young Master Cao, from your complexion,

50
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,400
it seems you have unhealed wounds?

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,800
D-Don't, don't! Just call me Weining.

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,800
Before, I was injured by Tao Hong and Lv Liu's hidden weapons.

53
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,300
The remaining poison is not cleaned thoroughly yet.

54
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,800
It's a good thing I had A'Xiang carefully looking after me. My injuries are no longer serious.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,200
I just need to go back to Gentle Wind Mountain and slowly force out the remaining poison.

56
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,000
Gu Xiang, you've followed me for so long.

57
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,600
Why wasn't I aware that you have

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:07,100
the ability to "carefully look after“ people?

59
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,400
Old Wen!

60
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:17,190
Whatever! Take out your hand.

61
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
Hurry up!

62
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,600
Old Wen is highly skilled in the art of healing, so he can help where he can.

63
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,700
Tao Hong and Lv Liu can be wicked or kind.

64
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,600
How did Young Brother Weining get into a fight with them?

65
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,800
Those two old freaks charged into Yueyang Sect

66
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,800
and kidnapped Gao Xiaolian. It was right on the day of the Heroes Conference.

67
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,500
A bunch of things happened after that, but you guys don't know.

68
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,200
We don't even know how Sister Xiaolian is doing right now.

69
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,400
I heard no one knows where she's disappeared off to.

70
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,000
Didn't Uncles Zhao and Shen go look for her?

71
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,800
Don't worry.

72
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:54,180
Each day they don't have the Glazed Armor

73
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:56,800
is one more day they won't hurt Miss Gao.

74
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,400
Chengling, Gao Xiaolian almost became your wife.

75
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:02,600
You won't just abandon her, will you?

76
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:04,000
Sister Xiang!

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,400
Why is your face getting red?

78
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,800
That Deng Kuan has died! You don't have any rivals anymore.

79
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,800
Deng Kuan?

80
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,200
Gao Chong's disciple?

81
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,800
Yes, didn't I tell you?

82
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,800
That Deng Kuan and Sister Xiaolian had a marriage agreement.

83
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
But once this Great Warrior Gold Bean appeared, he whisked her away!

84
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,700
Sister Xiang!

85
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,800
You say he has passed?

86
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,200
Yes, he disappeared after the Heroes Conference. He must've died.

87
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,000
Getting rid of your remaining poison requires some work.

88
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,800
A'Xu, come with me to the medicine shop.

89
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,000
There's no need for you to personally go! You can just give me the medicine formula.

90
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,200
A'Xiang...

91
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,200
Don't worry, don't worry!

92
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:48,800
You'll slowly realize how to interact with them.

93
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,200
A'Xu, are we thinking of the same thing?

94
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:02,000
That Deng Kuan was the one

95
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
who claimed Gao Chong was allied with the Ghost Valley during the Heroes Conference.

96
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:09,600
At first, I assumed he was a normal disciple.

97
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,600
However, I never would've imagined

98
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,100
that he was to be married to Gao Chong's only daughter.

99
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:19,800
Later, he would surely have inherited Gao Chong's possessions and his position as the Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,000
I just can't figure out what the person supporting him

101
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:27,500
used as a bargaining chip to bring him to their side.

102
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,800
Maybe we're the ones who got it completely wrong

103
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:32,000
and that Deng Kuan spoke the truth.

104
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,400
He genuinely wanted to eliminate his kin for the greater good.

105
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,000
That's impossible.

106
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,200
Since Chengling already gave up the Glazed Armor,

107
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,700
he was no longer of any value to Gao Chong.

108
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
That being said, why would he still

109
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:47,700
try to use his only daughter as a huge bargaining chip to win over an orphan?

110
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,600
Since he's already announced this during the martial art's world's Heroes Conference,

111
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,600
then he cannot go back on his words.

112
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,900
Isn't it pretty easy to go back on his words?

113
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,100
After buying people's alliances, if Chengling were to die,

114
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,900
would Gao Xiaolian have to marry a tombstone?

115
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:06,600
Lords! Seeing how well you are dressed,

116
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:09,800
you must be among the rich and wealthy! Please give me some food!

117
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,900
I'm about to die of hunger...

118
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,200
This beggar...

119
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,400
didn't even clear his eyes before trying to beg from someone like me.

120
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,210
Don't you know? This Lord here is halfway in your industry.

121
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:42,070
Great Warrior Shen?

122
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,400
Enemies are bound to meet on these narrow roads!

123
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,600
Watch out!

124
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:08,600
A'Xiang, eat another piece!

125
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:13,700
Sister Xiang, are you going to live at Gentle Wind Sword Sect in the future?

126
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:18,400
I'm going back to Four Seasons Mountain Villa with Master and Junior Master.

127
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Where is your maiden family from?

128
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,600
Stupid Great Warrior Gold Bean, who are you to speak here?

129
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,200
When I speak, you only need to answer.

130
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Let me ask you. Where did you guys go these few days I wasn't here?

131
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,200
What did you do? Let's hear it!

132
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,800
I have so much to say!

133
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,900
- What? Little Young Master Zhang has important business or something?
- A'Xiang!

134
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:42,200
Before Master gets back, we can only sit around and stare at each other.

135
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,900
Let's hear it! I'll listen!

136
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:48,400
- I didn't attend the Heroes Conference.
- Here you go, here you go!

137
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,400
Hey, wait!

138
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,400
We haven't ordered yet, so what is this?

139
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Our little restaurant serves these dishes for free.

140
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:55,600
Do such good things really happen?

141
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,600
If you don't believe me, I can open it for you to see.

142
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,800
- Who are they?
- Take the little guy and leave!

143
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
How can I leave you?

144
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,800
If he dies, Master will skin me alive!

145
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:37,400
Nobody's leaving! Go!

146
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:41,300
A'Xiang, be careful!

147
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Left four, right seven.

148
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
Two and four are the shoulder!

149
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
Six and eight are the feet!

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,600
Stupid brat! You've improved quite a bit these few days I was gone!

151
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,400
Keep using your Passing Cloud Steps. Don't let them catch you!

152
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,000
- Watch out!
- Watch out!

153
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,670
Are you stupid? Why are you going inside?

154
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:11,300
I didn't want to, but this is how Master taught me.

155
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,830
Who told you to help?

156
00:11:22,830 --> 00:11:26,190
You have poor skills and end up hurting rather than helping.

157
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:35,640
Sect Leader Shen, this is the sting of the scorpion's tail. It's poisonous.

158
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:40,100
If you can trust me,

159
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,250
you can take this medicine internally and apply it on the wound.

160
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:45,030
If you don't trust me, then forget about it.

161
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,230
Thanks. The two of you helped my eldest brother at the Heroes Conference.

162
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:01,870
You also rescued my nephew from the siege.

163
00:12:01,870 --> 00:12:04,760
I am very grateful, and now you've given me this medicine.

164
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:07,650
I will definitely repay your benevolence someday.

165
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,540
How strange.

166
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:12,870
You actually remember your eldest brother, Gao Chong.

167
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,440
Old Wen!

168
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:19,560
He was my eldest brother, and he will be my eldest brother forever.

169
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:23,700
Young Master Wen. Sir Zhou. Where is my nephew Chengling?

170
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,250
Chengling is nearby.

171
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,490
These venomous scorpion assassins are vicious.

172
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,150
They are probably in danger, too.

173
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:33,850
Let's not talk anymore and go take a look.

174
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,330
Run! Run!

175
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:45,970
[Penglai Inn]

176
00:12:47,430 --> 00:12:49,550
- Killer!
- Old man, hurry and run!

177
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:52,110
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

178
00:12:53,040 --> 00:12:55,850
Don't kill me! Don't kill me!

179
00:12:55,850 --> 00:12:58,210
Youngster, save me!

180
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,280
A'Xiang!

181
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:10,720
He was just an old beggar. Why did you kill him?

182
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,500
So what?

183
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:14,250
Over there!

184
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:17,280
Let's go!

185
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,480
After them!

186
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:28,530
- Master.
- Master.

187
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,290
Take him back!

188
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,770
Master!

189
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:40,860
Old Wen, leave some alive!

190
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:46,120
Too late.

191
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,770
Chengling.

192
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,510
Silly girl, I was the killer.

193
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,930
Why are you bloody all over?

194
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:57,250
It's other people's.

195
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,820
Chengling.

196
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:04,790
Uncle Shen, why are you here?

197
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:06,960
It's a long story.

198
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,830
Weining, you guys—

199
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,930
Why are you together?

200
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,280
Junior Master Shen, it's also a long story with me.

201
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,360
Here.

202
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:42,310
Don't nag me.

203
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:44,840
A'Xiang, why are you so angry?

204
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:47,140
Go away! Go away!

205
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,670
Go away!

206
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,940
Let me ask you.

207
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,030
Was I wrong to kill that beggar?

208
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:00,670
If I didn't kill him, should I have waited for him to kill me?

209
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,430
But he wouldn't necessarily have...

210
00:15:03,430 --> 00:15:05,260
He might not have killed you.

211
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:08,140
Let's say he did. What if he did?

212
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,820
Great Warrior Cao, I am not like you.

213
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:16,140
You always have people like Masters, Junior Masters,

214
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:18,890
Senior Brothers and Junior Brothers circling around you.

215
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:22,800
Where I grew up, it was either I killed them or they killed me.

216
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,830
Even if it's a one-in-one-hundred possibility,

217
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,690
I'd rather mistakenly kill innocents than let them off.

218
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:31,220
If I didn't do this, I couldn't have survived till today.

219
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:34,430
A'Xiang, I didn't mean to fault you.

220
00:15:34,430 --> 00:15:36,770
I didn't think you did wrong.

221
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:40,120
I was just concerned that what if the old beggar was a regular old beggar?

222
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:42,860
When you kill someone by mistake, you would feel sad.

223
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:45,480
Bullshit! I am not hypocritical like you guys.

224
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:48,040
What's there to be sad about? If I killed by mistake, so be it!

225
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:52,180
A'Xiang, you will definitely feel sad. You will absolutely feel sad.

226
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,740
You are so kindhearted.

227
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:56,650
How is it possible that you wouldn't feel sad? Right?

228
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,800
How do you know that I'm kindhearted?

229
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,950
A'Xiang, who could understand you besides me?

230
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,120
A'Xiang, you've never told me before about your childhood.

231
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:16,070
You just talked about the place where you grew up.

232
00:16:16,070 --> 00:16:20,620
A'Xiang, why was the place you grew up so harsh?

233
00:16:21,650 --> 00:16:23,550
You know nothing about it!

234
00:16:24,570 --> 00:16:26,290
A'Xiang!

235
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:33,960
Chengling, ever since you came to Five Lakes Alliance,

236
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,420
I've never treated you well.

237
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,200
Do you resent me?

238
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,680
No.

239
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,100
Even if you resent and hate me, I can't blame you.

240
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:46,430
It's useless no matter how I try to explain.

241
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:48,870
Still, I want you to know.

242
00:16:48,870 --> 00:16:51,910
I've never loathed you.

243
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:53,930
It's just that when your older brothers were still kids,

244
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:56,930
we five brothers had a deep friendship.

245
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,560
All of their children were children I hugged and teased before.

246
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:03,350
Every time I see you, I'm always reminded of them.

247
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:07,500
I faintly hoped in my heart how wonderful it would be if they were still alive.

248
00:17:08,090 --> 00:17:09,660
That's not wrong at all.

249
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:13,280
If Heaven would let me die in place of my older brothers,

250
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,080
I would be endlessly grateful.

251
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:19,400
As fate would have it, I, the most useless one, survived.

252
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,580
Chengling, sit down.

253
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,240
Actually, do you know that the one who most resembles your father is you?

254
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,670
Similar looks, same temperament.

255
00:17:33,670 --> 00:17:36,850
Your father was this kind of pure and filial person.

256
00:17:36,850 --> 00:17:40,870
Among us brothers, your father was the kindest and most righteous.

257
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:42,610
Really?

258
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:46,370
My dad couldn't have been as stupid as me, right?

259
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:48,420
He was a great warrior.

260
00:17:48,420 --> 00:17:53,180
Everyone else said that I have a weak personality and won't accomplish anything great in the future.

261
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:58,950
It's... tiger father, dog son.
 (T/N: strong father, weak son)

262
00:18:02,090 --> 00:18:03,870
Master!

263
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:13,100
Chengling, when did you acknowledge Sir Zhou as your master?

264
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:16,080
Sir Zhou.

265
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:19,260
Thank you for repeatedly saving my nephew.

266
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:21,330
You are the Five Lakes Alliance's savior.

267
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,170
I really don't know how to express my gratitude.

268
00:18:23,170 --> 00:18:25,340
No need for any thanks.

269
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:28,120
I just need Sect Leader Shen to answer a few questions.

270
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,870
Sir Zhou, why do you say this?

271
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,400
If you have any questions, I will answer what I know to the fullest.

272
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:37,810
Chengling, you ask first.

273
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:42,460
All right, Uncle Shen. But we must make an agreement first.

274
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:44,690
You can answer if you wish and not answer if you don't want to.

275
00:18:44,690 --> 00:18:47,010
Just don't lie to me.

276
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:50,550
My father seemed to have had some misunderstandings with you all.

277
00:18:50,550 --> 00:18:54,720
Senior Brother Deng Kuan also said Uncle Gao colluded with the Ghost Valley to kill my father.

278
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,260
What exactly is this about?

279
00:18:56,260 --> 00:18:58,920
Child, I swear to the heavens.

280
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,590
Your Uncle Gao would rather die than hurt your dad.

281
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,920
Regardless of any misunderstandings among us five brothers,

282
00:19:04,920 --> 00:19:08,410
Uncle Gao adored your father the most.

283
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:12,030
You know that he wanted you to take Xiaolian as your wife

284
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:14,120
in order to combine the best of both families' martial arts skills

285
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,120
so that you could revive the Mirror Lake Sect and become a great warrior of your generation.

286
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,800
When that time came, you would naturally become the leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.

287
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,200
But I've never wanted these.

288
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,800
Sect Leader Shen,

289
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,660
how much do you know about Deng Kuan?

290
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:30,160
I watched him grow up.

291
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,000
At the Heroes Conference,

292
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,650
how much of Deng Kuan's accusation against Master was true?

293
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:35,790
None of it was true.

294
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:38,400
You can't see through someone's heart, as it is beneath the skin. How would you know that?

295
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,730
Twenty years ago, my eldest brother already proposed to either destroy the Glazed Armor

296
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:46,370
or reveal everything to the world and accept the martial arts world's punishment.

297
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:48,330
The rest of us vehemently opposed it.

298
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:52,260
Besides, if Eldest Brother wanted to grab Third Brother Lu Taichong

299
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:54,080
and Fourth Brother Zhang Yusen's Glazed Armor,

300
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,790
why would he have endured the urge all these years?

301
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,870
As for me, if he would only have asked,

302
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:00,630
I would have gladly given him my Glazed Armor.

303
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:04,190
As for Second Brother, he was always weak.

304
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:10,010
Sect Leader Shen, I have one more question to ask you.

305
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:12,740
There is a saying in the martial arts world.

306
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:15,270
"The water of the Five Lakes converges throughout our lands."

307
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:18,050
"If not me, who deserves to become the Martial Arts Supreme Leader?"

308
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,600
Everyone thinks it's Supreme Alliance Leader Gao

309
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:25,590
who spread it in order to grab the position of leader of the martial arts world.

310
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:29,510
Eldest Brother didn't do this either.

311
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:31,430
Eldest Brother may look quiet and serious on the outside,

312
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:35,590
but deep in his heart, he highly values brotherhood and loyalty more than anything else.

313
00:20:35,590 --> 00:20:37,990
The only thing that can surpass all that

314
00:20:37,990 --> 00:20:40,850
is the reputation of the Five Lakes Alliance.

315
00:20:40,850 --> 00:20:43,350
Then, have you thought of

316
00:20:43,350 --> 00:20:47,030
why Deng Kuan would frame and harm his master?

317
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:51,710
All these days, I've thought about it thousands of times and still can't explain it.

318
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,830
Knowing Kuan'er's personality, even if he had to die a thousand deaths,

319
00:20:55,830 --> 00:20:59,710
he still never would've done anything even the slightest bit harmful to Eldest Brother.

320
00:20:59,710 --> 00:21:02,480
I really don't know what bewitchment he suffered

321
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,020
that would make him willing to hit his benevolent master with a fatal strike.

322
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:12,030
Chengling, stay with Sect Leader Shen and chat a bit.

323
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:13,990
I'll go see your Uncle Wen.

324
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:16,700
Sir Zhou, I also have a question.

325
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:18,750
I wonder if you would answer it.

326
00:21:19,660 --> 00:21:24,520
I noticed that Young Master Wen resembles an old friend that we know.

327
00:21:24,520 --> 00:21:29,500
Is Young Master Wen's family name... Zhen?

328
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:39,000
Sect Leader Shen, I think I am not obligated to answer this question.

329
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,160
- That's true, but I—
- You are wounded now.

330
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Take a good rest first.

331
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:17,120
Hey!

332
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,950
You're trying to scare me?

333
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:23,590
What are you thinking about?

334
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:27,240
I've thought it through.

335
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,770
What have you thought through?

336
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,620
Deng Kuan's actions might have another explanation.

337
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,840
Do you remember that odd little man Long Xiao who raised the disgusting Drug Men like children?

338
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,330
The method to control Drug Men

339
00:22:45,190 --> 00:22:50,310
perhaps has something to do with the legendary Soul Absorbing Bewitchment.

340
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:57,020
Right. We encountered these Drug Men at Yi Villa,

341
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,200
the Venomous Scorpions hideout, and Dragon Pool Cabinet.

342
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,420
Yi Villa's Drug Men were controlled by Long-Tongued Ghost.

343
00:23:04,420 --> 00:23:07,800
These odd events all have traces of the Venomous Scorpion.

344
00:23:07,800 --> 00:23:13,440
A'Xu, when you were in Window of Heaven, did you ever meet the Leader of the Venomous Scorpions?

345
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:17,890
The Leader of the Venomous Scorpions is oddly mysterious. He's never showed his face before.

346
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,370
Shen Shen can't be relied on,

347
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:23,860
then this Zhao Xuande who pretends to be a weakling but is actually mighty
(T/N: Idiom, "plays the role of a pig but eats tigers")

348
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,080
is the true leader of the Venomous Scorpions.

349
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:29,840
That's a possibility that can't be ruled out.

350
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:34,130
However, there are some holes I still haven't figure out yet.

351
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,440
There's also another matter.

352
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,340
What is it?

353
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:42,530
It's no longer only one matter

354
00:23:42,530 --> 00:23:46,390
but two. The first matter is:

355
00:23:46,390 --> 00:23:50,270
If we pretend that the leader of the Venomous Scorpions is Zhao Jing,

356
00:23:50,270 --> 00:23:53,570
the one who placed Three Corpse Poison on Gao Chong's sword

357
00:23:53,580 --> 00:23:56,060
and ended up killing Rong Xuan and his wife

358
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:58,170
is also Zhao Jing?

359
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,220
What's the second matter, then?

360
00:24:08,730 --> 00:24:11,000
The identity of Long-Tongued Ghost.

361
00:24:17,590 --> 00:24:19,210
Is it the man at Yi Villa

362
00:24:19,210 --> 00:24:23,830
who used Soul Winding Threads to control the Drug Men?

363
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:28,510
Long-Tongued Ghost... I only know that he is one of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts.

364
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,410
Yes, yes, yes. He's an underling of Hanging Ghost.

365
00:24:32,410 --> 00:24:37,120
Hanging Ghost improved his martial arts later and gave him the Soul Winding Threads.

366
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:41,120
He's the one who was in charge of the massacre of the Mirror Lake Sect.

367
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,930
I see.

368
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,430
It seems our Old Wen is the one who is knowledgeable and experienced.

369
00:25:05,650 --> 00:25:09,330
- Brother Wen, call me if you don't have enough water.
- Hey!

370
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:10,950
I'll take care of my master.

371
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:13,340
- Why's it any of your business? Don't butter up to my master!
- I was only trying to—

372
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:15,470
Go, go, go, go!

373
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,890
- Go!
- A'Xiang!

374
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:20,300
Master, water is ready! Call me if you need anything!

375
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:44,790
I almost tripped up earlier and exposed the secret that I already knew Long-Tongued Ghost long ago.

376
00:25:44,790 --> 00:25:49,160
Good thing A'Xu didn't seem to have found out. If he knew my real identity,

377
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:52,870
people and ghosts... ultimately can't walk on the same path.

378
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:58,470
I have good news and bad news.

379
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,680
You know how to hold out on me now?

380
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,480
The good news is:

381
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,040
The secret agent I sent to Dragon Pool Cabinet accidentally happened upon Zhang Chengling.

382
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:09,960
As we thought, he is together with the leader of the Window of Heaven and the chief of the Ghost Valley.

383
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,150
The odd thing is:

384
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,510
The inheritor of the Immortal Sword is also with them.

385
00:26:15,510 --> 00:26:17,070
What's the bad news?

386
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,780
Long Que and Long Xiao are both dead.

387
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:23,500
I thought it was something serious.

388
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,370
Leaving Long Que alive back then was just added security with no danger.

389
00:26:27,370 --> 00:26:32,060
Now, everyone who should be dead is dead. This shield of ours no longer makes a difference.

390
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:35,830
However, the fact that Long Xiao is dead is something to celebrate.

391
00:26:35,830 --> 00:26:37,380
Saved me from having to kill him.

392
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:40,910
But if he is dead, the key to the armory—

393
00:26:41,650 --> 00:26:45,200
Why did you also believe those lies I fed to Long Xiao?

394
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,460
Actually, for these past twenty years, the key to the armory

395
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:52,100
was always in the most dangerous

396
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:54,590
yet safest place.

397
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,270
In the Ghost Valley?

398
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,090
This is also...

399
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:04,400
part of the reason why I've always wanted to get rid of Ghost Valley.

400
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:15,410
Scorpion, do you know the art of successive traps?

401
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:18,230
Mirror Lake Sword Sect was massacred.

402
00:27:18,230 --> 00:27:20,380
Sanbai Mountain Villa was stolen from.

403
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,750
Ao Laizi passed away.

404
00:27:22,750 --> 00:27:24,700
I planned all of this

405
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,920
in order to let everyone in the martial arts world know

406
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:29,830
that it was Ghost Valley who stole the Glazed Armor.

407
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,800
Except not everything goes according to plan.

408
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:38,100
The person who created all the fake Glazed Armor pieces messed up your entire plan.

409
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,870
At least...

410
00:27:39,870 --> 00:27:43,700
we didn't have to wait for after the matter to blame everything on Gao Chong.

411
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,800
He died without accomplishing his goals with a completely ruined reputation.

412
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:54,370
Father, why do you hate Gao Chong so much?

413
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:03,350
Scorpion, why do you ask?

414
00:28:04,210 --> 00:28:06,230
I'm just curious.

415
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,790
Are you really only curious?

416
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,910
Curious...

417
00:28:21,990 --> 00:28:24,220
Then, why aren't you curious about how

418
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:26,490
we're both bound brothers,

419
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:29,380
but some sit up high, secure in their positions,

420
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:32,810
while others are dirt beneath their feet, no better than pigs and dogs?

421
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:34,450
Why aren't you curious about

422
00:28:34,450 --> 00:28:37,460
why some people can be the leading brothers asserting dominance

423
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:39,780
yet some people can only be insignificant little brothers,

424
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:42,740
suffering every day?

425
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:46,120
You think I'm just a selfish villain?

426
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:49,810
That I killed Gao Chong for my own selfish reasons?

427
00:28:50,530 --> 00:28:52,620
Let me tell you.

428
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:57,710
This Five Lakes Alliance will only flourish and shine

429
00:28:57,710 --> 00:29:00,470
under my, Zhao Jing's, leadership.

430
00:29:00,470 --> 00:29:03,420
Only then will it be the pride of the martial arts world!

431
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,880
Father, I am sorry.

432
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,470
I said the wrong thing.

433
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:22,870
Don't get angry.

434
00:29:22,870 --> 00:29:24,980
You only know how to make me angry!

435
00:29:28,390 --> 00:29:34,090
Didn't you say you'd found out where Zhang Chengling was? And then?

436
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:37,690
Those people are highly skilled martial artists and their whereabouts are uncertain.

437
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,730
The secret agent doesn't dare to get too close,

438
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:41,720
but he's writing letters to me via pigeon

439
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:45,800
while simultaneously calling on all the secret villages nearby to watch for a chance.

440
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:48,330
Those three people have strong martial arts.

441
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:52,910
If you send some common thugs over, aren't you just sending them to their deaths?

442
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:56,920
As long as you command it, I will immediately move to personally go.

443
00:29:56,920 --> 00:30:00,650
Don't forget! Those two, Zhou and Wen, were able to get away from you without injury before!

444
00:30:00,650 --> 00:30:03,700
I was holding back in fear of harming innocents.

445
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,310
Forget it. I have my own plans.

446
00:30:22,110 --> 00:30:24,720
Scorpion... Scorpion...

447
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:28,250
When can you learn to hold back your reckless strength?

448
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,430
Grow up quicker.

449
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:56,440
Zhou... Zhou... Zhou Xu! You—

450
00:30:56,440 --> 00:30:58,610
What are you standing here so late in the middle of the night?

451
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,140
You scared me to death!

452
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:03,590
Are you guilty of something? Why are you scared?

453
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:07,630
It's so late out. Why are you still not sleeping?

454
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:16,050
"Such beautiful stars in such a night,

455
00:31:16,060 --> 00:31:18,590
for whom are we traveling for in the night"?
(T/N: Poem by Huang Jingren in the collection "Qi Huai" in the Qing dynasty)

456
00:31:18,590 --> 00:31:21,480
Stop quoting things at me.

457
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:26,290
I can't understand it. What's so good about this alcohol? It's both bitter and nasty.

458
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:30,600
If you don't want to drink it, don't waste this luxury!

459
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,260
When Master is unhappy, he drinks.

460
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:40,930
I thought there was something good about alcohol.

461
00:31:40,930 --> 00:31:44,700
Don't you have the same amount of unhappiness even after drinking?

462
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,400
You don't understand.

463
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:49,350
Alcohol is also known as "Worry forgetter and disperser."

464
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:52,050
If one bottle can't solve your worries,

465
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:53,840
then two will do the job.

466
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,600
If it still doesn't work, then three or four bottles.

467
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,200
Too bad we're in the remote wilderness,

468
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,300
and there's only this one bottle left.

469
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,720
What's wrong?

470
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,520
You're unhappy again?

471
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:08,180
Did that Young Warrior Cao upset you again?

472
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:11,280
He dares to? I'll castrate him!

473
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:13,320
Look at you, a young girl

474
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,670
with eyes, a nose, and a mouth.

475
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:18,540
Why do you always say such inhumane things?

476
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:24,120
Old Wen said he raised you?

477
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,770
No wonder.

478
00:32:26,430 --> 00:32:28,660
Old sick ghoul, why aren't you sleeping in the middle of the night?

479
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:30,530
What's wrong with you? Are you sick again?

480
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:32,360
You're right.

481
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:41,610
I heard Master say you don't have long to live.

482
00:32:41,610 --> 00:32:44,510
You did it to yourself.

483
00:32:45,260 --> 00:32:46,980
Is it true?

484
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:50,050
Damn you!

485
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:52,520
Why won't you live properly?

486
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:55,930
If you die,

487
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:58,430
Master will be very sad.

488
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:04,570
Me? I've lived for so long,

489
00:33:04,570 --> 00:33:08,620
but I've never seen Master as sad as he was that day.

490
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,750
He has finally found a friend. You are not allowed to die.

491
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:17,660
If... If you suddenly die

492
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:20,040
and leave my master to wallow in his sadness all alone,

493
00:33:20,040 --> 00:33:24,140
I-I will grab you from the underworld, bring you back up, and then strangle you to death.

494
00:33:24,140 --> 00:33:27,610
If you weren't a girl, I would beat you up eight times a day!

495
00:33:27,610 --> 00:33:29,860
The way you talk so inhumanely all the time

496
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,260
really makes you resemble someone.

497
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:32,870
Who's that someone?

498
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:36,580
Like someone who likes to eavesdrop.

499
00:33:38,390 --> 00:33:40,140
Lass.

500
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,190
What nonsense are you speaking this time?

501
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:46,950
Master, drink wine!

502
00:33:47,990 --> 00:33:50,980
What are you doing? I'm already an adult now, don't pinch my ear anymore!

503
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:53,300
Adult? How old are you?

504
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:58,160
Even if got married, found in-laws, bore children, and became a mother, I can still pinch your ear when I want to.

505
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,770
Wine.

506
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,830
There's no more wine in here. You're still trying to give it to me to drink?

507
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,820
I see that this used to be a wine storage.

508
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:13,810
Hurry and find some wine for me.

509
00:34:13,810 --> 00:34:15,730
Yes...

510
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:18,720
Hurry and go. Hurry and go!

511
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:25,450
Young Master Wen.

512
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,650
Stinking brat, did you tell him?

513
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,240
No, I didn't. I didn't say.

514
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:52,010
He asked me if you were surnamed Zhen. I only said I wouldn't tell him.

515
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:53,780
Uncle Shen guessed it.

516
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:55,080
Idiot!

517
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,030
Old Wen, be calm.

518
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:12,420
Young Master Wen,

519
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:15,470
are you Yan'er?

520
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:21,590
Yan'er, are your parents all right?

521
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:36,970
A person whose tendons in the hands and feet were ripped,

522
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:40,060
lost the protection of their sect,

523
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:42,510
and must bear the pressure from the righteous martial arts world

524
00:35:42,510 --> 00:35:45,450
while also hiding from assassination attempts by the malicious and evil sects

525
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:47,750
when forced to be caught between the pressure of both sides, while

526
00:35:47,750 --> 00:35:50,460
also protecting his word of honor and holding out till the end!

527
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:53,490
Helping those he believes to be his brothers in hiding the truth!

528
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:56,530
Do you think he is living well?

529
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,260
I'm sorry.

530
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,490
It's too late.

531
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:15,660
They can't hear your apology anymore.

532
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:22,280
Old Wen, what's wrong?

533
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,880
Yan'er!

534
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:30,930
Don't call me that. You don't deserve to!

535
00:36:30,930 --> 00:36:31,850
Wen Kexing!

536
00:36:31,850 --> 00:36:33,200
Why are you helping him!

537
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,980
I am helping you!

538
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,360
It's too late!

539
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:40,180
They are already dead!

540
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:43,350
Zhen Yan also died with them!

541
00:36:43,350 --> 00:36:45,220
A'Xu!

542
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:50,520
Yan'er, how did your parents die?

543
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,730
It's too late.

544
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:55,630
It's too late!

545
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,590
Old Wen...

546
00:37:15,630 --> 00:37:17,570
Come.

547
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,190
Old Wen.

548
00:37:35,950 --> 00:37:37,830
I'm sorry.

549
00:37:48,330 --> 00:37:51,160
[Li Residence]

550
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:58,670
Master, how is Junior Master?

551
00:37:58,670 --> 00:38:02,150
Don't worry. His pulse is normal.

552
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:05,000
I just don't know why he is still unconscious.

553
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:10,620
Sir Zhou, are you saying that Yan'er has some illness?

554
00:38:10,620 --> 00:38:14,620
Sect Leader Shen, my junior brother's name is Wen Kexing.

555
00:38:14,620 --> 00:38:18,590
He has chosen to be under this name. Please respect his choice

556
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,490
and call him by this name.

557
00:38:20,490 --> 00:38:24,640
When did he become your junior brother? Who is your master?

558
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,800
My master is the Lord of Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

559
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,550
His surname is Qin and first name Huaizhang.

560
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,100
It's Brother Qin who saved Yan—

561
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,950
Kexing?

562
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,130
This is wonderful, wonderful.

563
00:38:40,130 --> 00:38:41,530
There is justice under the heavens.

564
00:38:41,530 --> 00:38:45,120
If Eldest Brother knew that Kexing grew up under Brother Qin's protection,

565
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,890
he would be very happy.

566
00:38:46,890 --> 00:38:49,080
Do you mean...

567
00:38:49,080 --> 00:38:51,770
my late master was an old friend to all of you?

568
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,960
Then, why did I never hear my late master mention you?

569
00:38:57,000 --> 00:39:01,250
It's not surprising. After the battle on Mount QIngya,

570
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,500
Brother Qin cut off relations with us, and we lost permanent contact.

571
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:09,400
That's why all these years, we didn't know that Ruyu's son

572
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,700
was in the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

573
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,220
This is strange, then.

574
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:18,350
My late master always regarded friendship highly.

575
00:39:18,350 --> 00:39:21,480
Why would he terminate his friendship with you so inexplicably?

576
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,930
Was there some misunderstanding?

577
00:39:28,090 --> 00:39:30,330
It's not really considered a misunderstanding.

578
00:39:31,060 --> 00:39:34,810
Your master had his reason to blame us.

579
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,920
It's just that it's a long story to talk about everything from the beginning to the end.

580
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,250
If so, I, as a junior, dare not hear about my late master's wrongdoing.

581
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:46,890
Sect Leader Shen also need not say too much about it.

582
00:39:46,890 --> 00:39:49,720
He blamed us for not being able to hold onto our own consciences in the face of large disruptions

583
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:52,260
and performed acts of betrayal!

584
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:57,080
He was not wrong to blame us... not wrong.

585
00:39:57,080 --> 00:40:01,160
I was the turtle who put his head back in his shell, and I disappointed my brothers.

586
00:40:01,160 --> 00:40:04,260
I don't have any pride left to refute it.

587
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:08,580
I, Shen Shen, am a disloyal, unfaithful, incapable,

588
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:11,390
and weak villain.

589
00:40:11,390 --> 00:40:13,790
It was... you?

590
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,380
It was you who poisoned Uncle Rong?

591
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:17,220
What are you saying?

592
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:21,230
My disciple is asking, did Sect Leader Shen put poison on Gao Chong's sword

593
00:40:21,230 --> 00:40:23,610
and cause the death of Elder Rong Xuan.

594
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,230
I, Shen, did nothing while Brother Rong died and Ruyu was in difficulty

595
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:30,560
for twenty years. That's because I was despicable and shameless.

596
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:34,160
I acknowledge that! But to say that I would slaughter my brother,

597
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,630
I would die than do that!

598
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,290
Besides, this grievance was Eldest Brother's lasting regret.

599
00:40:41,290 --> 00:40:43,760
If I find out who did this,

600
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,450
I will kill him even if I end up dying.

601
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,350
You don't know?

602
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,870
Who is the current alliance leader of the Five Lakes Alliance?

603
00:40:52,870 --> 00:40:56,760
You are talking about... You are talking about Great Warrior Zhao!

604
00:40:58,480 --> 00:41:01,160
Tell me clearly.

605
00:41:02,120 --> 00:41:04,970
Are you saying it's my second brother who did the poisoning?

606
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:09,790
Who said this?

607
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:13,600
Did Yan'er say this? Does he have proof?

608
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:16,370
Wake him up to tell me clearly.

609
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,690
This can't be.

610
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:20,690
If my junior brother wakes up

611
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:23,920
and is willing to talk with you, I naturally would not prevent it.

612
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,110
No. I must talk with him!

613
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:31,430
Sect Leader Shen, pardon me for speaking bluntly.

614
00:41:31,430 --> 00:41:35,860
In the past, you did nothing while Elder Rong Xuan died, but humans are inherently evil. There's nothing to be done about that.

615
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,930
But if you and your brothers had any bit of conscience,

616
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:40,450
my junior brother wouldn't have lived half his life in misery!

617
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:44,060
We all suffered serious injuries at Mount Qingya, there was no way to take care of others!

618
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,020
Don't bother to explain to me!

619
00:41:47,250 --> 00:41:52,730
In the middle of the night, you just needed to convince your own conscience.

620
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:56,560
Karma eventually caught up to you.

621
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:00,260
You brothers eventually also...

622
00:42:04,910 --> 00:42:08,640
It's all in the past now, and the dead died long ago.

623
00:42:09,190 --> 00:42:13,300
I don't want Junior Brother to suffer from the old grievances becoming new hatred.

624
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,720
I ask that Sect Leader Shen leave voluntarily. In the future,

625
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:21,900
whether you ignore everything or help the villains,

626
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,890
as long as my junior brother isn't willing to find trouble with you, I hope we shall never meet again

627
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:29,130
in the martial arts world.

628
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:33,370
Chengling, send the guest away for me.

629
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:35,060
Yes.

630
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:33,930
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

631
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:40,970
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

632
00:43:40,970 --> 00:43:48,120
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

633
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:55,800
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

634
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:03,660
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

635
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:11,160
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

636
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:15,130
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

637
00:44:15,130 --> 00:44:18,630
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

638
00:44:18,630 --> 00:44:26,500
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

639
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:29,990
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

640
00:44:29,990 --> 00:44:33,660
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

641
00:44:33,660 --> 00:44:41,740
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

642
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:45,190
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

643
00:44:45,190 --> 00:44:48,920
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

644
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:56,020
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

645
00:44:56,020 --> 00:45:04,630
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
