00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,439
Shen, just you wait!

26
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:15,000
The number of people coming to steal the Glazed Armor will only increase by more and more!

27
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:19,020
Both of you, come here.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,900
Leader Shen, these two disciples have already converted to the Mount Tai Sect.

29
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:29,860
If there is anything you wish to say, why don't you tell me?

30
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,220
Ao Laizi, you're refusing to hand over my Third Brother Lu's disciples.

31
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,800
What is your motive?

32
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:39,300
Leader Shen, this is where you're wrong.

33
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,000
Before his death, Leader Lu personally entrusted these two disciples to me.

34
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,580
It's your Five Lakes Alliance that abuses your power and oppresses others.

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:54,900
I respect that you are a sect leader, and I have always treated you with proper courtesy.

36
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,580
I suggest you grant my request while I’m still being respectful.

37
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,480
Junior Uncle Shen, on Master's deathbed,

38
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,420
he indeed told us to follow Senior Ao Laizi in the future.

39
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:06,920
On account of your relationship, please respect his final wishes.

40
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,980
Please don't force us.

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,700
You rascal!

42
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,100
Your master was delirious from illness!

43
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,420
If you really transfer to Mount Tai Sect,

44
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,380
Danyang Sect will have no successor,

45
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,720
and you will be considered the sinner of Danyang Sect!

46
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,100
Please don't make things difficult for these two children.

47
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,320
Do you want them or the item?

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,100
Cut to the chase!

49
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,040
What if I want them all?

50
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:32,500
Can you stop me?

51
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,680
Fifth Brother!

52
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,460
Master!

53
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,460
- Master, are you okay?
- Fifth Brother, why are you here?

54
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,980
Why are you with Senior Ao Laizi?

55
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:52,660
Qing Hua, this is Great Warrior Shen.

56
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:55,880
Don't worry, I'm not hurt.

57
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:58,840
Fifth Brother, you're injured.

58
00:03:59,820 --> 00:04:02,780
Second Brother, I came here by chance

59
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:04,860
and saw that wicked old couple, Tao Hong and Lv Liu,

60
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,680
being rude to Senior Ao Laizi,

61
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:08,900
so I acted to chase them away.

62
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,360
You came at the perfect time.

63
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,040
Senior Ao Laizi has had a tiring trip escorting our Danyang Sect's successors here.

64
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,440
We must thank him properly.

65
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:23,150
Thank you, Senior. Tao Hong and Lv Liu dared to cause trouble for Mount Tai Sect.

66
00:04:23,150 --> 00:04:27,320
But do not worry, in the future, our Five Lakes Alliance will definitely help you settle the score.

67
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,640
You've had a tiring day.

68
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:33,680
Why don't you follow me back to Sanbai Manor and rest before we talk some more?

69
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,920
Great Warrior Zhao, what if I am not willing?

70
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,940
If you do not wish to return with us,

71
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,260
then naturally, it is because I lack virtue and do not have enough ability

72
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,240
to be able to invite you as my guest.

73
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,180
Let's meet again on another day.

74
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:54,320
We won't hold you up anymore today.

75
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,640
- Second Brother!
- Fifth Brother, he is highly respected.

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,320
We can't make too huge of a scene in front of so many people.

77
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:09,260
Since you won't do us the honor,

78
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:11,200
I can only send you off.

79
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,420
Have a safe journey.

80
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,380
However, these two successors of our Danyang Sect...

81
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:21,280
We will listen to Master, and we're willing to follow Leader Ao Laizi.

82
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:28,420
Then I beg that you treat them well.

83
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:35,200
You two children, you must always be smart and sensible.

84
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:37,840
Don't embarrass the Five Lakes Alliance.

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:44,120
Senior, haven't you heard that a common man's only crime is to carry treasure?

86
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,300
Just Tao Hong and Lv Liu were able to force you into such a tough spot.

87
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,420
Are you sure you want to forge ahead dogmatically?

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,660
Both have their own intentions.

89
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:00,200
Thank you so much for your help, Great Warrior Shen.

90
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,200
Everyone, we will see each other again in the martial arts world.

Let's go, disciples.

Come, Chengling. Greet your Fifth Uncle.

this is Chengling?

96
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,820
Yes.

97
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:24,560
These are the two righteous men who escorted Chengling to Sanbai Manor.

98
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,040
I was neglectful just now

99
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:29,160
and hadn't yet asked what the names of you righteous men were.

100
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:31,540
We're just nobodies who aren't worth mentioning.

101
00:06:31,540 --> 00:06:33,280
We were just ordered to do this.

Great Warrior Zhao. Great Warrior Shen.

105
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:43,940
We escorted Chengling all the way here arduously,

106
00:06:43,940 --> 00:06:46,500

I'd like to propose a toast to you.

I did not expect that you would have such literary talent.

Come on, come on. Let's drink!

All of us from the Five Lakes Alliance are very grateful.

I haven't had the chance to introduce him yet.

118

He's the leader of the Mount Dagu Sect.

You're Great Sect Leader Shen? It's an honor to finally meet you.

121
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:34,540
As expected, hearing about you hundreds of times is less powerful than meeting you once.

122
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:37,740
Your elegance is much more refined than the rumors say.

123

It is such an honor.

Excuse me for a moment, you two.

My nephew Zhang Chengling has returned today.

I'm unable to contain my happiness!

Although Shen Shen keeps pressuring us, we are the reasonable side.

He won't dare to publicly massacre his peers in the martial arts world!

Child, what do you mean, "He won't dare to publicly massacre"?

144

Can't he do it secretly?

145
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,070
Even if Shen Shen doesn't take this action,

146

didn't you hear Tao Hong and Lv Liu's words?

Since information about the Glazed Armor has been leaked,

148
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,200
the martial arts world will never be peaceful.

149
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,400
Since the storm has begun, there will be unrest in the martial arts world.

150

This is the duty of my generation.

153
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,020
My life is not important.

- We want to learn!

However, it's easy to learn and difficult to master.

Master.

327

Chengling... you can't call me that anymore.

328
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:51,080
I have fulfilled my promise and safely brought you to Sanbai Mountain Villa.

329
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:54,960
If you want to learn martial arts, Zhao Jing, Gao Chong, and Shen Shen

330
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:57,080
are all great warriors who can teach you.

Our fate ends here.

332

You're a man, you can't cry in the future.

333

I won't cry. I'm a man.

You can't cry.

You're a man. You can't cry.

I know, I won't cry.

339
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,220
You don't cry, so I won't cry, either.

340
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:33,160
You kept saying that it would be foolproof,

341
00:24:33,160 --> 00:24:35,880
so how did the Glazed Armor still get stolen?

342
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:39,120
I was neglectful.

343
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:42,220
We fell for a double decoy.

344
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:44,920
I thought they wanted to kidnap Zhang Chengling,

345
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:49,860
but I didn't expect that they would actually open the door to the secret room

346
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:53,440
with the Glazed Armor being their goal.

347
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:59,740
Then, who do you think would be able to break into your secret room?

348
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,840
The secret room door was locked with Heaven's Mystery Lock.

349
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,420
It's a top secret

350
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,300
and no outsiders would know.

351
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,000
No one would be able to open it.

352
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,680
That means we have an enemy in our midst.

353
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:16,040
But how could they have timed the retrieval so perfectly?

354
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:19,640
You mean there is a traitor in my mountain villa?

355
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,800
The person Yu Tianjie was chasing stole the Glazed Armor.

356
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,940
Who exactly was that masked man?

357
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:28,340
Second Brother, how could you be so muddle-headed?

358
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:31,240
Danyang Sect has no more descendants. Mirror Lake Sect was exterminated.

359
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:34,280
In the blink of an eye, the elder in Mount Tai Sect died.

360
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:37,100
Ghost Valley is obviously after the Glazed Armor.

361
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,940
Now, three of the five pieces are gone.

362
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:41,320
There were five pieces of Glazed Armor.

363
00:25:41,320 --> 00:25:45,440
Looks like each of the five brothers in the Five Lakes Alliance kept one of the pieces.

364
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,860
Twenty years.

365
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:50,900
What have you done in these twenty years, Second Brother!

366
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:53,400
Have riches rotted your bones?

367
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:57,560
In one night, someone came to kill and another came to rob!

368
00:25:57,560 --> 00:26:01,360
Is the security at your Sanbai Mountain Villa any different from a teahouse or tavern?

369
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,720
Eldest Brother was right.

370
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:07,440
Do you think these people really look up to you as the Great Warrior of Sanbai?

371
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,000
They are all just greedy for riches.

372
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:14,300
What has the great Lake Tai Sect come to, in your hands?

373
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:16,600
Do you even know how many people's lives it took to build up

374
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:19,600
the 100-year prestige of the Five Lakes Alliance?

375
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:24,040
And thanks to you, people have made it into a joke!

376
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:29,100
Yes.

377
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,940
You are right about everything.

378
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:39,500
Everyone else says that the Five Lakes Alliance is so prestigious

379
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:43,060
and that I, Great Warrior Sanbai, live so honorably.

380
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:46,280
The truth is, isn't it just that I have some money?

381
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:52,760
I've disgraced the Five Lakes Alliance,

382
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,500
but the truth is that I don't want anything.

383
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:58,720
I just want everyone in the Zhang family to be well.

384
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:02,500
As long as we five brothers are well and as long as Eldest Brother Rong is well, that's enough.

385
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,940
If we had known earlier,

386
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:08,660
why would we build an armory or covet the Glazed Armor?

387
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:17,000
Fifth Brother, you still have a piece of the Glazed Armor.

388
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:19,500
Take it out and let's destroy it.

389
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,880
All five pieces of the Glazed Armor are necessary.

390
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:25,340
If we destroy it, no one else can open the armory

391
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:28,060
and the world will be at peace.

392
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:30,940
Second Brother, has your anger made you muddle-headed?

393
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:36,160
How many people did we brothers sacrifice to keep the secret of the armory?

394
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:40,540
If you destroy the Glazed Armor, wouldn't they all have died in vain?

395
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:49,960
- Who is it!
- Who is it!

396
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:55,300
Whose concealment technique is so good that he can even hide from me?

397
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,200
Who is it?

398
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:29,500
♫ Willows are all over the town, but there are no flying catkins ♫

399
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:30,760
Come down.

400
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:37,090
♫ My heart has closed, and your returning horse
does not appear ♫

401
00:28:38,150 --> 00:28:41,900
Thank you, A'Xu, for helping me stop the two of them.

402
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,780
Our A'Xu usually loves to bully me, but when dealing with outsiders,

403
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,740
you're able to understand who are and are not close to you.

404
00:28:50,760 --> 00:28:54,180
Brother Wen, instead of being a guest, you became a thief in the shadows.

405
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,460
What are you up to?

406
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:57,880
Aren't you doing the same?

407
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,920
I know, I know.

408
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:03,980
Although we usually don't say it, our hearts are as clear as mirrors.

409
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:06,900
The Five Lakes Alliance hides many secrets

410
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:08,980
and our little Chengling is so naive.

411
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:13,660
That's why we have to find out the origins of the Glazed Armor and its implications.

412
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,520
Otherwise, this group of tigers and wolves will swallow him alive sooner or later.

413
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,820
You see, wasn't what happened tonight surprising?

414
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:24,500
I saw Yu Tianjie running out after a masked man.

415
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,180
That person must be the traitor Zhao Jing mentioned.

416
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,440
All across the road on the way here, I noticed traces of fights.

417
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:35,340
They only disappeared here.

418
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:38,740
Be careful!

419
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,520
Soul Winding Spell?

420
00:29:57,460 --> 00:30:01,700
This time, it's the real Hanging Ghost.

421
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,100
So the Hanging Ghost that A'Xiang killed was fake.

422
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,280
Xue Fang has been famous for almost 30 years.

423
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,200
If he could be defeated by a lying little girl,

424
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:16,980
then the people who were killed by him wouldn't be able to lie still in their coffins.

425
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:22,480
A'Xu, the saying is that people shouldn't talk about others during daytime or ghosts during nighttime.

426
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,680
Why are you so unsuperstitious?

427
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,040
I know.

428
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:31,660
You're a male virgin, so you're not afraid of ghosts. Right?

429
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:49,420
A'Xu, you're not afraid of blood, are you?

430
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,200
It just disgusts me.

431
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:59,260
You're a combative expert, yet you're afraid of blood?

432
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:02,820
I'm laughing so hard, it's too funny!

433
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:05,940
Don't be angry, don't be angry. I'll clean it for you.

434
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,200
This will make it much easier.
(T/N: Cutting off a sleeve is a Chinese euphemism for homosexual love, and it comes from a story written in the Qing Dynasty)

435
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:24,520
The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the yellow sparrow behind.

436
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,040
Do you want to make a bet with me?

437
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:30,040
Let's guess which brother is hanging there.

438
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,140
No cheating.

439
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,360
Boring.

440
00:31:34,360 --> 00:31:36,500
If you don't guess, it means you give up.

441
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:38,500
I'm going to guess.

442
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:04,920
I guess that he's the son of the Leader of Mount Hua Sect, Yu Tianjie.

443
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:11,020
Revealed. I won the first round.

444
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,460
A'Xu, where are you going?

445
00:32:17,460 --> 00:32:20,140
It's the middle of the night. Wait for me.

446
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,360
Tonight's Sanbai Mountain Villa

447
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,460
was so lively with so many people coming and going.

448
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:30,160
A'Xu, this is the second round.

449
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:32,320
Guess who this masked man is.

450
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:34,200
Don't come so close to me.

451
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,420
I know it's too hard to guess who he is.

452
00:32:38,420 --> 00:32:43,460
Why don't we guess... who killed him?

453
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:51,600
Song Huairen.

454
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,300
The disciple that Gao Chong sent to Sanbai Mountain Villa.

455
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:55,800
Turns out he's the traitor.

456
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:58,800
You didn't even guess who killed him.

457
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,400
Yu Tianjie.

458
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,000
I saw them fight.

459
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:06,400
Taiyue's Green Peak Swordsmanship.

460
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,000
Wrong, the sword cut wasn't the fatal injury.

461
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,200
This wound is.

462
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:17,600
But... what weapon caused this injury?

463
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:22,200
This wound looks like it was caused by Iron Hook,

464
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,800
but even I don't have any impression of this martial art.

465
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:34,800
A'Xu, do you hear owls laughing?

466
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,800
As the saying goes, don't be afraid to hear an owl's call,

467
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,400
but be afraid to hear an owl laugh.

468
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:42,400
Once it laughs, people will die.

469
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:46,000
A number of people have died tonight.

470
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,400
Not enough.

471
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:51,200
I heard that there was a child who heard an owl laugh

472
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:55,700
and then his village had dozens of deaths.

473
00:33:56,600 --> 00:33:58,300
If everyone were a cicada,

474
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,600
then who is the yellow sparrow or the praying mantis?

475
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,000
The world is like a game of chess.

476
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,400
Every person who believes themselves to be a cunning zealot

477
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:09,800
always thinks they have the upper hand.

478
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,800
