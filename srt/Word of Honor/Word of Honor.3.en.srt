[Word of Honor]

22
00:01:49,988 --> 00:01:52,989
[Episode 3]

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,900
Master Wen.

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,809
I've been helping you kill and bury bodies all night,

25
00:02:29,809 --> 00:02:32,229
why are you still calling me Master Wen nonstop?

26
00:02:32,229 --> 00:02:34,490
Aren't you being a bit too formal?

27
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:37,310
You shouldn't drink cold liquor with that injury.

28
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:39,909
A'Xiang, warm it up.

29
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:48,509
I can tolerate serving you,

30
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:51,230
but must I also serve these two idiots?

31
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,640
Sister Xiang, let me do it.

32
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,298
Take it.

33
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,960
Master Wen.

34
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,020
How strange.

35
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:32,560
It feels like skin and flesh to the touch,

36
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,160
but why does it feel like you grew it yourself?

37
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,289
Indeed. I worked hard to grow it myself, despite the fact that I am untalented.

38
00:03:40,289 --> 00:03:42,430
Who is this man?

39
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,749
How was he able to recognize the Passing Clouds Steps

40
00:03:44,749 --> 00:03:46,470
and also see through my disguise?

41
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:49,409
In all my years of life, I have never judged anyone's character incorrectly.

42
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:51,469
Your figure speaks of honesty and righteousness,

43
00:03:51,469 --> 00:03:53,410
so you must be extraordinary.

44
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:55,490
How come...?

45
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,729
Master!

46
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:58,969
Last time, you pointed at the back of a village girl,

47
00:03:58,969 --> 00:04:01,089
praised her for being born with fair shoulder blades,

48
00:04:01,089 --> 00:04:02,289
and then insisted that she must be a beauty.

49
00:04:02,289 --> 00:04:07,790
The result was that when she turned around, the way she batted her eyes was even greasier than a pig's head!

50
00:04:07,790 --> 00:04:09,410
What do you know?

51
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:11,409
That girl was inherently beautiful,

52
00:04:11,409 --> 00:04:14,109
but her poor environment gave her an obscene temperament.

53
00:04:14,109 --> 00:04:16,290
We cannot consider it my mistake.

54
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:19,479
As for Brother Zhou...

55
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:21,120
Uncle Zhou.

56
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,319
I can't find a breakthrough yet,

57
00:04:24,319 --> 00:04:28,020
but I'm sure you've changed your appearance.

58
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,520
Is it pretty?

59
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,800
Perfect.

60
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:46,299
Master Zhang, the masks worn by the group who was chasing you

61
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:49,499
had symbols of Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley.

62
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:51,919
This group of evil spirits had disappeared from Jianghu for many years.

63
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,139
How did the Mirror Lake Sect provoke them?

64
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,540
I don't know.

65
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,740
You don't know?

66
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:04,220
Then, Brother Zhou, surely you know how strong the Ghost Valley is?

67
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:07,740
You got involved in such a major issue for no reason,

68
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,640
don't you want to know the causes and effects?

69
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:14,839
I don't know, and I'm not interested in knowing.

70
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:18,560
However, I can get a good idea of it just by guessing.

71
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:20,380
Uncle Zhou.

72
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:24,840
Matters of the martial arts world

73
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,740
are only ever about three things: greed, hatred, and ignorance.

74
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:33,580
Ghost Valley disappeared for many years, so there's no hatred to speak of.

75
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,059
Qiu Yuejian has always preserved moral integrity and been at peace with all,

76
00:05:37,059 --> 00:05:39,600
meaning that there isn't any ignorance to speak of, either.

77
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,600
That means that the only thing left is greed.

78
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,539
The ghosts on Mount Qingya must have destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect

79
00:05:44,539 --> 00:05:48,060
because they were greedy for something.

80
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,850
I wonder whether or not you have heard this nursery rhyme, Brother Zhou.

81
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,270
"The water of the Five Lakes converges throughout our lands."

82
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,330
"If not me, who deserves to become the Martial Arts Supreme Leader?"

83
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:01,589
That's right.

84
00:06:01,589 --> 00:06:05,669
This nursery rhyme has spread throughout the martial arts world in these past few months.

85
00:06:05,669 --> 00:06:10,589
Everyone knows this was created to be used as the Five Lakes Alliance's campaign to compete for leadership of the martial arts world.

86
00:06:10,589 --> 00:06:12,549
However, a few days ago,

87
00:06:12,549 --> 00:06:17,470
a strange second half of the rhyme spread from Yuezhou city.

88
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,490
Master! What is it?

89
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:37,569
"The Iridescent Clouds have scattered, and the Glaze has shattered."

90
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:42,610
"Who will cry with the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?"

91
00:06:43,330 --> 00:06:46,410
What's so sad about the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?

92
00:06:46,410 --> 00:06:48,149
Aren't they all filled with evil

93
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:52,030
and only ended up in the Ghost Valley because they had nowhere else to run to?

94
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:55,070
You're right, Brother Zhou,

95
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,930
but the words "the Ghosts on Mount Qingya"

96
00:06:57,930 --> 00:06:59,909
don't stand for a group of ghosts.

97
00:06:59,909 --> 00:07:01,889
Rather, they stand for Rong Xuan, the great demon who was executed

98
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:06,250
at Mount Qingya twenty years ago.

99
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:09,049
Rumor has it that this demon with the surname of Rong

100
00:07:09,049 --> 00:07:13,249
left behind a martial arts treasure called World's Armory.

101
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,429
It contains the long-lost supreme techniques of various martial arts sects.

102
00:07:17,429 --> 00:07:20,969
It can make any ordinary man invincible.

103
00:07:20,969 --> 00:07:23,590
Additionally, the key to opening this armory

104
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:28,230
is called the Glazed Armor.

105
00:07:28,230 --> 00:07:31,470
A treasure that makes people invincible?

106
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,929
You can only trick an ignorant rustic into believing this kind of foolish talk.

107
00:07:35,929 --> 00:07:38,990
Master Wen, do you believe it, too?

108
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,810
Why? Don't you believe it?

109
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,670
Treasures, divine weapons,

110
00:07:46,670 --> 00:07:50,169
secret martial arts scrolls, elixirs.

111
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,729
Every few years, something of this kind gets made up

112
00:07:53,729 --> 00:07:55,509
and causes the people of the martial arts world

113
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,809
to scramble for it, leading to countless deaths.

114
00:07:57,809 --> 00:08:00,190
Only then will everyone be happy.

115
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:02,410
Ridiculous.

116
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:04,270
How is it ridiculous?

117
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:06,490
Isn't it?

118
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:10,010
All of these treasures have one shared name.

119
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,270
They're called the "Genius Way of Reaping without Sowing."

120
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:14,090
Simply put,

121
00:08:14,090 --> 00:08:16,170
it's just greed.

122
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:22,090
I didn't expect that our viewpoints would be the same.

123
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,190
Although peace reigns over the land,

124
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:28,870
ignorant people create trouble for themselves.

125
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:32,289
I finally figured out what you just said!

126
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:35,768
Correct. According to logic, those people who fight over it

127
00:08:35,768 --> 00:08:38,928
must know that their martial arts skills are bad, and that's why they're trying to reap without sowing!

128
00:08:38,928 --> 00:08:42,019
However, they already know that they're weak but still fight with others over these things.

129
00:08:42,019 --> 00:08:44,370
Don't they just have a death wish?

130
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,909
Master, it looks like there are loads of people who are dumber than I am!

131
00:08:48,909 --> 00:08:51,470
Miss Gu is quite smart.

132
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:56,010
What do you think, Master Zhang?

133
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:04,249
We should take a nap. It's almost dawn.

134
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:14,890
Dawn... is indeed coming.

135
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,710
Bring them in here.

136
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:29,880
Over here.

Cover the bodies. Don't expose them to the sun.

00:10:17,789 --> 00:10:18,790

Okay.

- Junior Master Shen.
- Greetings, Leader of Mount Dagu Sect.

145
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:30,949
What happened?

146
00:10:30,949 --> 00:10:33,930
- Junior Master Shen...
- Where is Junior Master Zhang?

147
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,850
Junior Master Shen!

148
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,310
By the time we were able to rush over here last night,

149
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:49,210
every single member of the Mirror Lake Sect had already been killed.

150

These are the remains of Junior Master Zhang and our two juniors.

00:11:00,619 --> 00:11:02,560
- Junior Master Shen!
- Step aside!

Junior Master Shen!

155
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,920
You'd better not look.

156
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:11,100
Junior Master Zhang and the two juniors were tortured before they died.

157
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,580
Their remains are in a poor state.

158

- Warrior Shen! Warrior Shen!
- Junior Master Shen, you...

160
00:11:23,280 --> 00:11:25,060
It's all my fault for being useless!

161
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:28,560
I failed to find out something was amiss fast enough and couldn't save them!

162
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,779
As the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect, I am to blame!

163
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,260
Please punish me, Junior Master!

164
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,479
Weren't you ordered here to hand over the invitation?

165
00:11:36,479 --> 00:11:39,310
Why weren't you here in time to rescue them, either?

166
00:11:39,310 --> 00:11:42,220
When we saw the fire from Yuezhou city last night,

167
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,899
we rushed to the lake to save them immediately,

168
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:48,600
but someone destroyed all the boats early in that morning!

169
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,120
What a cruel scheme!

170
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,860
If I find them,

171
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,580
I will force them to pay us back by a hundredfold!

172
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:08,099
In all my years, I'd never heard anyone boast so outrageously,

173
00:12:08,099 --> 00:12:12,540
talking so big without any sense of shame.

174
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,400
Tao Hong. Lv Liu. What do you mean?

175
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,819
Warrior Shen,
[Grandma Tao Hong, Grandpa Lv Liu]

176
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:19,299
when you became sworn brothers,

177
00:12:19,299 --> 00:12:23,799
didn't you swear to die at the exact same time?

178
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:27,799
Now that your sworn brother died such a cruel death,

179
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:31,380
why don't you end your life and follow him?

180
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,540
Are you just going to get over it after shedding a few tears?

181
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,480
Nonsense!

182
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,860
Old Woman, this, you don't understand.

183
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:45,339
The Five Lakes Alliance's understanding of honor has always been unique among others.

184
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:47,679
When they were alive, they wouldn't meet up at all for decades.

185
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:50,940
Once one of them died, the other would scurry over as soon as possible, crying so hard that it's as if it were his own mother who died.

186
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,260
This kind of deep friendship is quite special!

187
00:12:55,260 --> 00:12:58,060
You insult the friendship between us five brothers.

188
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,999
Are you deliberately trying to provoke me?

189
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,220
Brothers?

[Mirror Lake Mountain Villa]

191
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:09,020
Great Warrior Shen, aren't you tooting your horn too much?

192
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:12,420
Who even knows whether or not Zhang Yusen would even claim you as his brother?

193
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:20,020
Anyone with sharp eyes can clearly discern whether you, Leader Shen,

194
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,740
are a brother or a lackey.

195
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,740
You've gone too far!

196
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,680
Leader Shen!

197

[Elder of Beggar Gangs, Huang He]

199
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:34,740
Leader Shen,

200
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,720
I specifically invited Tao Hong and Lv Liu here to help us.

201
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:48,139
Virtuous Couple, I hope you will consider my position and provoke him less.

202
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:51,879
We should stick together when faced with a formidable enemy.

203
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:55,539
Let us set down our past grievances for now.

204
00:13:55,539 --> 00:13:57,340
Set them down.

205
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:07,620
Leader Shen, is it more important to avenge Mirror Lake Sect

206
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:12,720
or to hold this momentary argument?

207
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:21,740
But Elder Huang, who... who did this?

208
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:23,940
Follow me.

[Luohan Temple]

210
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:58,840
Have you stared long enough?

211
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:02,000
I'm just wondering...

212
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:07,360
what kind of countenance lies beneath your disguise.

213
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,960
It's already dawn. Thank you both.

214
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,400
Our meeting was fated.

215
00:15:31,840 --> 00:15:35,200
Fate will reunite us.

216
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Brother Zhou, honestly, what's the point in reuniting another day?

217
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,319
You want to send this child to Lake Tai.

218
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,660
It's a long journey,

219
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,980
and I happen to have a decorated boat.

220
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,419
I'd also like to appreciate the scenery of Lake Tai.

221
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,400
We might as well take the water route together. Wouldn't that be a comfort?

222
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,679
I've always hated to see the fated people brave harsh weather

223
00:16:01,679 --> 00:16:04,100
on their journeys.

224
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,740
Interesting.

225
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,800
I'd love to see who you really are.

226
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,799
Fated people?

227
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,380
Master, that diseased ghoul is yellow-faced and skinny, and he breathes out more air than he takes in.

228
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,420
He may keel over and die at any moment on our journey!

229
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:24,940
Why would you take him with you?

230
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:26,700
Do you find your life too comfortable?

231
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,380
How many people with a full face have you ever seen before?

232
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,600
That person's voice sounds as mellifluous as a phoenix’s song, and his appearance is beautiful in a dignified manner.

233
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:38,140
Especially those shoulder blades.

234
00:16:38,140 --> 00:16:40,079
They are one-of-a-kind.

235
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,779
You make it sound as if you're speaking of a flower.

236
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:45,040
He's just a man, isn't he?

237
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,580
Of course.

238
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:48,299
Do you think I don't know he is a man?

239
00:16:48,299 --> 00:16:49,700
What I mean is...

240
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:53,860
this person's appearance and physiognomy are completely inconsistent.

241
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:57,680
Yet I can't see any trace of disguise.

242
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:04,120
How skillful must he be to be able to pull this kind of little trick?

243
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:06,960
Even I can't find a breakthrough.

244
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:11,700
There's also that flexible sword of his...

245
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,918
Master, why were those people pretending to be so mysterious last night?

246
00:17:18,918 --> 00:17:21,409
That leader even called himself the Hanged Ghost.

00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,340
What an insidious trap!

256

Junior Master, these materials are extremely sharp.

257
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,459
You can hardly see them with the naked eye.

258
00:18:14,459 --> 00:18:18,640
We only cleaned them roughly one time, and they are not cleaned up yet.

Yes.

All of us from the older generation know

263

the Ghost Valley always creates a scene before it carries out its evil deeds.

264

I was worried that someone would do evil under the guise of Ghost Valley.

That was why I asked my two old friends, Tao Hong and Lu Liu, to come here.

then you needn't fear that the ghosts will knock on your door at night.

321
00:22:27,221 --> 00:22:30,562
I can wash my foot in it".
(T/N: Lines from a classical Chinese Poem)

322
00:22:31,442 --> 00:22:36,282
Brother Zhou, we really meet everywhere.

323
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:41,242
Did this person put some tracking item on us?

324
00:22:41,242 --> 00:22:45,962
Is there really a tracking technique I do not know about it?

325
00:22:46,542 --> 00:22:48,122
Let's go.

326
00:22:50,142 --> 00:22:51,821
Where are you going, Brother Zhou?

327
00:22:51,821 --> 00:22:53,842
Aren't you going to rest a bit longer?

328
00:23:01,222 --> 00:23:05,642
Seeing that man by the name of Shen frightened out of his wits,

329
00:23:05,642 --> 00:23:08,082
was truly satisfying.

330
00:23:08,082 --> 00:23:12,181
Five Lakes Alliance has been unbridled for so many years.

331
00:23:12,181 --> 00:23:15,582
Someone can finally put them in their place.

332
00:23:16,182 --> 00:23:19,822
Grandma Tao Hong, you should restrain yourself a bit.

333
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:21,042
If the Ghost Valley appears,

334
00:23:21,042 --> 00:23:23,681
it will not just be the Five Lakes Alliance that suffers.

335
00:23:23,681 --> 00:23:25,842
I don't care.

336
00:23:25,842 --> 00:23:29,062
I'm almost dead anyway.

337
00:23:29,062 --> 00:23:31,982
As long as I can watch the fall of the Five Lakes Alliance,

338
00:23:31,982 --> 00:23:34,722
I can die in peace.

339
00:23:34,722 --> 00:23:39,322
Lv Liu, what do you think?

340
00:23:39,322 --> 00:23:44,282
So many people were driven to death

341
00:23:44,282 --> 00:23:47,162
for that damned Glazed Armor back then.

342
00:23:47,162 --> 00:23:48,962
In the end,

343
00:23:48,962 --> 00:23:53,902
the Five Lakes Alliance got all the benefits.

344
00:23:53,902 --> 00:23:57,542
Now, the Danyang Sect's bloodline was cut first,

345
00:23:57,542 --> 00:23:59,701
and then the Mirror Lake Sect was destroyed.

346
00:23:59,702 --> 00:24:04,162
I feel like the time has come for Five Lakes Alliance's retribution.

347
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:08,362
Lu Taichong left behind two young disciples.

348
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:11,682
They ran over to Ao Laizi's Mount Tai Sect.

349
00:24:11,682 --> 00:24:14,661
He must have obtained Lu Taichong's Glazed Armor.

350
00:24:14,662 --> 00:24:16,802
We have to find Ao Laizi quickly.

351
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:20,521
We can't let another piece of the Glazed Armor fall into the hands of the Ghost Valley.

352
00:24:20,521 --> 00:24:22,361
[Tianya Inn]

353
00:24:22,361 --> 00:24:24,081
A single room would be enough, too.

354
00:24:24,081 --> 00:24:26,122
Please, can't you work something out?

355
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:28,882
If we had a room, we'd let you stay here.

356
00:24:28,882 --> 00:24:32,402
A gentleman reserved the entire place.

357
00:24:32,402 --> 00:24:33,462
Please forgive me.

358
00:24:33,462 --> 00:24:35,461
Why don't you go and look elsewhere?

359
00:24:35,461 --> 00:24:37,601
Are there other inns elsewhere?

360
00:24:37,601 --> 00:24:39,861
I'm sorry, there aren't.

361
00:24:39,862 --> 00:24:41,962
If that's the case, where do you expect us to go?

362
00:24:41,962 --> 00:24:45,141
It's none of my business where you go once you leave our inn.

363
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:46,742
You—

364
00:24:46,742 --> 00:24:49,562
What about your woodshed? That will do.

365
00:24:49,562 --> 00:24:51,061
We are tired from our journey.

366
00:24:51,062 --> 00:24:53,602
We'd like to ask you for a place to stay overnight.

367
00:24:54,582 --> 00:24:57,002
Isn't this Brother Zhou?

368
00:24:59,222 --> 00:25:00,841
What woodshed?

369
00:25:00,841 --> 00:25:03,521
How can we let our Brother Zhou sleep in a woodshed?

370
00:25:03,521 --> 00:25:07,700
Innkeeper, have my first-class room cleaned up

371
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,920
for this beautiful...

372
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:12,681
this gallant man.

373
00:25:12,681 --> 00:25:14,881
Of course. Lad, go and clean it up!

374
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:16,562
All right!

375
00:25:24,102 --> 00:25:27,501
Brother Zhou, I gave you my own room,

376
00:25:27,502 --> 00:25:30,582
and I even prepared two new outfits for you.

377
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:33,802
Are you just going to take over my room so brusquely?

378
00:25:33,802 --> 00:25:37,062
You should at least invite me inside to sit for a while.

379
00:25:37,822 --> 00:25:40,761
Seems to me that there are many empty rooms here.

380
00:25:40,761 --> 00:25:42,881
Just find another room to relax in.

381
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:46,802
But there's only one first-class room.

382
00:25:46,802 --> 00:25:48,462
Brother Zhou.

383
00:25:49,262 --> 00:25:50,962
Brother Zhou!

384
00:26:01,382 --> 00:26:04,602
Uncle Zhou, what are you doing?

385
00:26:05,622 --> 00:26:08,302
We must always be on guard.

386
00:26:09,582 --> 00:26:12,702
Master Wen doesn't look like a bad person.

387
00:26:18,062 --> 00:26:21,302
You think everyone is a good person.

388
00:26:23,342 --> 00:26:26,802
You stayed up all night. Come here and take a nap.

389
00:26:26,802 --> 00:26:30,982
Uncle Zhou, you stayed up all night, too. I'll just take a nap in the chair.

390
00:26:30,982 --> 00:26:32,202
You should use the bed.

391
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:35,562
Just do what I say.

392
00:26:35,562 --> 00:26:37,222
Yes.

393
00:26:51,842 --> 00:26:55,381
You brat. You don't even take off your clothes when you sleep?

394
00:26:58,782 --> 00:27:01,262
My presence is inconvenient for you, isn't it?

395
00:27:02,062 --> 00:27:03,662
Fine.

396
00:27:04,942 --> 00:27:09,242
By the way, is your injury serious?

397
00:27:14,322 --> 00:27:17,322
You don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

398
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:22,062
This is the hemostatic.

399
00:27:22,062 --> 00:27:23,922
Apply it yourself.

400
00:27:34,912 --> 00:27:38,112
Uncle Zhou, thank you.

401
00:28:27,592 --> 00:28:31,991
Brother Zhou, our fate is deeply interconnected.

402
00:28:31,992 --> 00:28:36,572
Were we perhaps connected in our past three lives?

403
00:28:38,012 --> 00:28:40,792
It feels more as though you're a wretched soul who keeps haunting me.

404
00:28:43,392 --> 00:28:48,232
I wonder why you keep following me all this time.

405
00:28:48,232 --> 00:28:50,332
It wouldn't hurt to tell me your motive.

406
00:28:52,392 --> 00:28:55,592
What I want is very simple.

407
00:28:55,592 --> 00:29:00,292
Show me your true face and I'll tell you.

408
00:29:01,352 --> 00:29:05,732
Why not let me see your true face first?

409
00:29:07,292 --> 00:29:09,932
Your true face must be very handsome.

410
00:29:09,932 --> 00:29:12,172
As for my true face...

411
00:29:12,172 --> 00:29:14,771
It may not necessarily be that appealing.

412
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:18,732
Perhaps it's covered in scars.

413
00:29:18,732 --> 00:29:23,312
Perhaps it's a terrifying appearance.

414
00:29:23,312 --> 00:29:27,292
I have no interest, no matter what it is.

415
00:29:27,292 --> 00:29:29,751
However, I will give you a piece of advice.

416
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:34,212
Don't be so interested in things that don't concern you.

417
00:29:34,212 --> 00:29:36,092
Then tell me, Brother Zhou,

418
00:29:36,092 --> 00:29:39,811
what is your relationship with that Master Zhang upstairs?

419
00:29:39,811 --> 00:29:41,731
Are you really willing to get sucked into this trouble

420
00:29:41,731 --> 00:29:44,172
without truly knowing what it is?

421
00:29:44,912 --> 00:29:48,772
I do my best to accomplish what was entrusted to me.

422
00:29:49,352 --> 00:29:53,372
I only need to bring Master Zhang to Zhao Jing safely.

423
00:29:53,372 --> 00:29:57,632
Anything else has nothing to do with me.

424
00:30:16,752 --> 00:30:21,492
Master! Why didn't you invite me to drink with you?

425
00:30:21,492 --> 00:30:24,492
A'Xiang, let me ask you.

426
00:30:24,492 --> 00:30:29,572
What kind of person is the second cutest person in the world?

427
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:33,272
What kind of person? Someone who treats me to dinner.

428
00:30:33,272 --> 00:30:36,152
It's a person who is tough on the surface but soft at heart.

429
00:30:37,332 --> 00:30:40,271
Then who is the cutest person in the world?

430
00:30:40,271 --> 00:30:44,692
A person with a slim waist, long legs, who is tough on the surface but soft at heart.

431
00:31:01,152 --> 00:31:05,072
This child is the descendant of an eminent family.

432
00:31:05,072 --> 00:31:09,432
We shall spare no efforts to find the child!

433
00:31:09,432 --> 00:31:10,852
Yes!

434
00:31:10,852 --> 00:31:13,211
We will follow Law Enforcement Elder's orders.

435
00:31:13,211 --> 00:31:16,552
Then, what should we do after we find his whereabouts?

436
00:31:16,552 --> 00:31:21,492
Bring the child directly to me, no matter what it costs.

437
00:31:21,492 --> 00:31:28,051
Don't let anyone know that the child was brought to us.

438
00:31:28,051 --> 00:31:29,712
Yes!

439
00:32:14,681 --> 00:32:16,481
Uncle Zhou.

440
00:32:18,081 --> 00:32:20,320
Young Master Zhang, you finally woke up.

441
00:32:20,321 --> 00:32:21,581
We've been waiting for you.

442
00:32:21,581 --> 00:32:24,181
Your Uncle Zhou wouldn't start eating without you.

443
00:32:24,181 --> 00:32:26,821
That made us unable to start.

444
00:32:26,821 --> 00:32:28,961
Wash your hands and eat.

445
00:32:31,241 --> 00:32:32,680
I'm hungry!

446
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,501
Why wash your hands? It's not like you're going to eat with your bare hands!

447
00:32:35,501 --> 00:32:40,360
Wild Girl, since we are traveling the martial arts world, can't you be more disciplined?

448
00:32:40,361 --> 00:32:44,081
Look at how the other girls conduct themselves.

449
00:32:50,641 --> 00:32:51,720
[Tianya Inn]

450
00:32:51,721 --> 00:32:54,701
Sirs, please have mercy on us.

451
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:55,981
Is that him?

452
00:32:55,981 --> 00:32:59,721
Have mercy on us, sir!

453
00:33:13,081 --> 00:33:16,120
Young Master Zhang, why don't you start eating?

454
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,101
Is the food not to your taste?

455
00:33:18,101 --> 00:33:19,701
No, that's not it.

456
00:33:19,701 --> 00:33:22,041
Thank you for the hospitality, Master Wen.

457
00:33:23,420 --> 00:33:26,000
You know to thank others for treating you to a meal,

458
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,141
so why don't you eat properly?

459
00:33:28,141 --> 00:33:32,360
Don't you know that having someone like you at the table is really affecting our appetite?

460
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:36,641
But... I really don't have an appetite.

461
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:43,920
I really dislike spoiled people like you who never experienced any hardships!

462
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,760
You're neither versed in literacy nor in martial arts.

463
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:48,180
When something happens, your world falls apart!

464
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:50,200
If you don't eat, you'll be starved to death!

465
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:54,440
Do you think that the Heavens would be so touched by your actions that all of your enemies would magically get struck by lightning?

466
00:33:54,440 --> 00:33:57,860
A'Xiang, don't bully him. Just eat.

467
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,560
Master, am I wrong?

468
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:04,301
Look at that silly boy, his head is only there for decoration!

469
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:15,081
Listen. If you don't eat to gain strength and skills,

470
00:34:15,081 --> 00:34:20,001
are you really just counting on us outsiders to avenge you?

471
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,840
Yes.

472
00:34:27,840 --> 00:34:31,239
At home, you rely on your parents, outside you rely on friends,

473
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:35,600
but that's just wishful thinking. Even this Sick—

474
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:43,280
Master Zhou won't let his generosity get taken advantage of this much.

475
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,999
Take your time to eat, no one is trying to steal it from you.

476
00:34:55,999 --> 00:34:58,500
Be careful not to choke, you idiot.

477
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,701
Why did you start crying?

478
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:11,181
A'Xiang!

479
00:35:13,020 --> 00:35:16,381
It's as if I bullied you.

480
00:35:26,861 --> 00:35:29,700
[Chongwu Hall]

481
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,321
[Five Lakes World Alliance]

482
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:41,160
Everybody, during my time as the leader
[Leaders of Haisha Gangs and Water Transport Gangs]

483
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:42,960
of the world's highest alliance,
[Leaders of Angry Waves, Changle, Wild Gusts, and Iron Anchor gangs and dockmasters of Zilang and Senluo]

484
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,760
Ghost Valley attacked the
[Disciples of Yueyang Sect, Zhu Yaozhi, Gao Shan]

485
00:35:44,761 --> 00:35:48,460
Five Lakes Alliance's Mirror Lake Sect in cruel ways.
[Leader of Five Lakes Alliance, Gao Chong]

486
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:54,681
They annihilated my Fourth Brother, Zhang Yusen's whole family.

487
00:35:56,220 --> 00:36:01,160
The Five Lakes Alliance has experienced unprecedented shame and humiliation!

488
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:06,061
This debt of blood must be paid back with blood!

489
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:09,100
Leader is right! This debt of blood must be paid back with blood!

490
00:36:09,100 --> 00:36:11,200
This debt of blood must be paid back in blood!

491
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,841
Everybody!

492
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:17,061
Since the Battle of Mount Qingya,

493
00:36:17,061 --> 00:36:21,601
the martial arts world and the Ghost Valley have been in peace for more than twenty years.

494
00:36:21,601 --> 00:36:24,820
It's because the righteous people back then

495
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:29,121
made an agreement with the masters who developed Ghost Valley.

496
00:36:29,121 --> 00:36:32,169
As long as the Ghost Valley does not harm the people of the martial arts world,

497
00:36:32,169 --> 00:36:36,650
the righteous people will not step inside Ghost Valley!

498
00:36:36,650 --> 00:36:41,690
However, now it's the Ghost Valley who did harm to our world first!

499
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:47,150
Therefore, I will hold a Heroes Conference on July 15th!

500
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:51,149
It's time for us to attack Mount Qingya together

501
00:36:51,149 --> 00:36:52,929
and eradicate this cancerous evil!

502
00:36:52,929 --> 00:36:55,409
A debt of blood must be paid back with blood! Eradicate the cancerous evil!

503
00:36:55,409 --> 00:36:58,770
A debt of blood must be paid back with blood! Eradicate the cancerous evil!

504
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:05,550
[Leader of Mount Tai Sect, Ao Laizi]

505
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,990
Master, how is it?

506
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,069
Fortunately, we didn't find anyone suspicious.

507
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:18,830
How is Qing Hua?

508
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,889
He only caught a cold.
[Disciple of Mount Tai Sect, Qing Bai]

509
00:37:20,889 --> 00:37:23,009
He has a small fever from time to time.

510
00:37:23,010 --> 00:37:24,709
Master, can we set a fire?

511
00:37:24,709 --> 00:37:26,650
Endure it a bit longer.

512
00:37:26,650 --> 00:37:29,190
It will be all right once we get to Mount Wudang.

513
00:37:29,190 --> 00:37:32,709
Let me keep watch. You are tired from the journey, please rest.

514
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:35,150
I'm fine.

515
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:38,150
If there hadn't been a fire at Mirror Lake Mountain Villa,

516
00:37:38,150 --> 00:37:40,729
then Shen Shen wouldn't have let us go temporarily.

517
00:37:40,729 --> 00:37:42,969
However, if he catches up with us again,

518
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:45,849
how could your children beat them?

519
00:37:45,849 --> 00:37:47,969
We'll just have a battle to the death. Master!

520
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:49,870
You're too reckless!

521
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:54,389
Master Ao Laizi, how about...

522
00:37:54,389 --> 00:37:58,450
you... you just hand us over?

523
00:37:58,450 --> 00:38:02,030
After all, Master Shen is my uncle's sworn brother.

524
00:38:02,030 --> 00:38:04,910
We are Danyang Sect's last two descendants.

525
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:08,889
I think Five Lakes Alliance won't do anything to us.

526
00:38:08,889 --> 00:38:10,850
Silly child.

527
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:14,749
Shen Shen is chasing after you relentlessly to steal

528
00:38:14,749 --> 00:38:17,750
the Glazed Armor that your master left.

529
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,810
But don't worry.

530
00:38:20,670 --> 00:38:25,510
Since I promised to fulfill your master's last wish,

531
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:30,110
I will do anything in my power

532
00:38:30,110 --> 00:38:32,129
to prevent the Glazed Armor

533
00:38:32,129 --> 00:38:35,090
from falling into the hands of the Five Lakes Alliance.

534
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:43,070
Save me! Save me!

535
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,760
Save me!

536
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:51,670
Save me! Save me!

537
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:54,010
Dad!

538
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:56,970
Dad...

539
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,910
Uncle Zhou?

540
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:05,390
It's fine now.

541
00:40:07,830 --> 00:40:09,470
Get some sleep.

542
00:40:26,950 --> 00:40:30,230
[Bright and Blessed]

543
00:40:31,950 --> 00:40:36,010
Brother Zhou, are you looking for these two people?

544
00:40:38,650 --> 00:40:42,050
I've already handled everything for you. Go back to sleep.

545
00:40:42,050 --> 00:40:44,090
It's the Ghost Valley again.

546
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:46,330
They followed me quite closely.

547
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:54,250
It's difficult to tell a ghost from a human.

548
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:57,110
Someone wearing a ghost mask is not necessarily a ghost.

549
00:40:57,110 --> 00:41:01,278
Someone with a human face may not necessarily be a human.

550
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,378
Who knows?

551
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:14,117
You're a true connoisseur.

552
00:41:14,117 --> 00:41:16,938
This is the old yellow seal liquor of 30 years.

553
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:20,598
Can I call you A'Xu?
(T/N: "A" in front of a name is used to express endearment)

554
00:41:20,598 --> 00:41:23,598
Your ability to judge wine, A'Xu,

555
00:41:23,598 --> 00:41:27,158
is on par with my ability to judge people.

556
00:41:27,158 --> 00:41:29,018
How about a sip of it?

557
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,578
With that judgment of yours? Just forget it.

558
00:41:34,578 --> 00:41:36,898
My judgment of people is perfect.

559
00:41:36,898 --> 00:41:41,457
I'm willing to bet that there's a very big surprise

560
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:45,998
lying underneath your outermost skin.

561
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:55,058
You might as well rip it off and take a look.

562
00:41:55,058 --> 00:41:58,697
I'm in no hurry. It's just a matter of time.

563
00:42:33,890 --> 00:42:40,258
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

564
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:47,678
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

565
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:55,738
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

566
00:42:55,738 --> 00:43:03,390
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

567
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:11,378
♫ The cold rain of Autumn kisses my windows ♫

568
00:43:11,378 --> 00:43:18,838
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

569
00:43:18,838 --> 00:43:22,777
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

570
00:43:22,777 --> 00:43:26,337
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

571
00:43:26,337 --> 00:43:34,197
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

572
00:43:34,197 --> 00:43:37,737
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

573
00:43:37,737 --> 00:43:41,417
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

574
00:43:41,417 --> 00:43:49,358
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

575
00:43:49,358 --> 00:43:52,897
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

576
00:43:52,897 --> 00:43:56,597
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

577
00:43:56,597 --> 00:44:03,718
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

578
00:44:03,718 --> 00:44:12,438
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
