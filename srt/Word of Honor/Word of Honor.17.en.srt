[Word of Honor]

00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,050
[Episode 17]

23
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:58,300
A'Xiang!

24
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,200
Why are you sitting up?

25
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,500
A'Xiang!

26
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:09,000
A’Xiang, thank goodness you're okay.

27
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:12,400
I dreamed that I wasn't able to protect you well.

28
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,000
Why am I in so much pain?

29
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,600
You better just lie down. You were beaten to a pulp and lied unconscious for these past few days.

30
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:22,200
Who would you be able to protect?

31
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,500
A'Xiang, I had so many dreams and couldn't wake up.

32
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,200
In each dream, I wasn't able to protect you. I was so anxious.

33
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,700
In the last dream, I even died.

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:38,200
I even happily waited for you by the Bridge of Helplessness.
 (T/N: A legendary bridge that every soul must cross to be reincarnated)

35
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,500
I thought I'd surely have to wait 60 to 70 years

36
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:45,000
anticipating a white-haired old lady.

37
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,800
However, not long after, you came down. I thought to myself,

38
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,600
"That's not right! How could you die young?" It scared me to death!

39
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,700
Are you cursing me?

40
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,600
I'm not, I'm not!

41
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,200
Children's words carry no harm. The wind blows them away.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:08,000
A'Xiang, you have such a good heart. You will surely live to be a hundred.

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Where's Sister Xiaolian?

44
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,000
She was captured by those two old devils.

45
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,300
Then let's go save her!

46
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,500
Enough!

47
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:24,300
You should lie down. You only have half a life left, who would you be able to save?

48
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:27,000
Then, who saved me? My junior master?

49
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,100
Where is my Junior master and the others?

50
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:31,700
Easy, my Young Master.

51
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:34,100
It was Sect Leader Yu of the Mount Hua Sect who saved you.

52
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:38,600
Lie down and rest. Don't move around! I'll go find some medicine for you to take.

53
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:55,100
Miss Gu, is Nephew Cao all right?

54
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,800
He's not in a serious condition.

55
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,000
That's good.

56
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,600
A generous and gallant heart like Nephew Cao's is hard to come by.

57
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:03,600
This is the side residence of my Mount Hua Sect.

58
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,600
Just let him stay here and recuperate in peace.

59
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:09,800
Enough, Great Leader Yu. I already told him.

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:13,800
There's no need to make yourself suffer through feigning civilness with me, a young demon girl from Ghost Valley.

61
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,600
Please do as you like.

62
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:19,000
Xiang'er, it's "feign civility."
(T/N: The idiom she used had a homograph and she chose the wrong pronunciation)

63
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,100
All right, you two stay here and chat.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,600
Don't disrupt Nephew Cao's peace and quiet.

65
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,500
Sister Qianqiao, couldn't you have let me save face in front of an outsider?

66
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:39,600
Xiang'er, you are still so ignorant and incompetent. How could you match with a disciple from an illustrious sect?

67
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,200
Who wants to be his match? I'm even worthy of matching with a prince!

68
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,700
That big idiot...

69
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:49,200
Yes, of course. Our Xiang'er is too good for even the emperor.

70
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,200
Look at that! Even our Heartless Amethyst Fiend

71
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,200
has a day when she discovers the taste of worry.

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,000
Xiang'er, listen to a word of advice.

73
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
In a desperate situation, just focus on the present.

74
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,400
At present, Young Hero Cao is injured.

75
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,800
You two should just live here in the side residence of the Mount Hua Sect.

76
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:10,100
Wait until I finish settling my master down.

77
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,900
Sister Qianqiao, how come the Mount Hua Sect Leader

78
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:16,400
saved Aunt Luo together with you?

79
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:19,600
What did you say to deceive him? You should let me know.

80
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,200
Or else later, I might say something wrong.

81
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,600
His son died at the hands of the Five Lakes Alliance.

82
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,100
I promised to help him take revenge, so he helped save my master.

83
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,400
It's that simple?

84
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,800
I think that guy is really cunning.

85
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,900
Sister, you better be careful.

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:41,000
My good Xiang'er, don't worry about me.

87
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,800
Hurry and take care of Young Hero Cao.

88
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,400
That's right, I need to go find some medicine for him.

89
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Then I'll go first.

90
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:57,090
Girl!

91
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
It's time to eat.

92
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,000
Are you deaf or dead?

93
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:12,200
What? Do you want to starve yourself to death?

94
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:14,200
No chance!

95
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:19,000
If you die, then it would be like drawing water from a basket.
(T/N: effort will be in vain)

96
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Open your mouth. Open your mouth!

97
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,700
Eat! Eat it!

98
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,600
That's enough. That's enough, Old Lady.

99
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Stop being so hard on this little girl. Let me try and coax her.

100
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,200
Good luck with that!

101
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,200
That old bastard Huang He,

102
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,600
what exactly is he thinking?

103
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,100
Since Gao Chong has already paid his debt,

104
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:52,200
he should immediately go after Shen Shen and Zhao Jing.

105
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,000
What's the use in locking this little girl up?

106
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,800
Since this girl doesn't know anything,

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,400
we should either kill her or let her go.

108
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,200
What's the use in locking her up?

109
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:06,400
There is absolutely no way we can let her go.

110
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,700
We put in so much effort to capture her.

111
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:12,600
At this point, those who ride a tiger find it hard to dismount.
(T/N: can't stop halfway)

112
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,400
Girl, whatever you know, you'd better say it all.

113
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:24,400
Your father is no longer here. What's the point in being so stubborn?

114
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,800
Are you the only one who's suffered?

115
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:31,400
This old couple will certainly not abuse you.

116
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:35,000
That may not be the case with others!

117
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,600
A'Xu, are you hot? Look, you're already sweating.

118
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,800
Here, let me fan you.

119
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,200
I wasn't hot before,

120
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,000
but the moment I heard you talk, I started burning with anger.

121
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,800
Uncle Wen, my master is perfectly fine.

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,400
You should be more concerned about me.

123
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:32,600
Slacking off again? Practice for an extra hour!

124
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,200
Master, I've practiced the Passing Clouds Steps a few thousand times already.

125
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,000
I got comfortable with it long ago. I'm really quite good at it.

126
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,400
Can I stop practicing?

127
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:44,200
You dare to talk back? Add another two hours!

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,000
A'Xu, you're usually such a gentle person.

129
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,200
How come when you teach your disciple, you're so strict?

130
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,600
Pushing too hard will bring disaster, not good fortune.

131
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,600
You have to teach children slowly for things to work.

132
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,000
How slow?

133
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,600
Fine, fine, fine. I spoke out of turn.

134
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:02,400
A'Xu teaches according to his student's abilities. Only strict teachers can produce brilliant students.

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:05,600
It's useless for anyone to beg me. Don't you know that a clumsy bird must fly first?
(T/N: You must work hard to compensate for limited abilities.)

136
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,400
I can protect you for a while, but can I protect you for a lifetime?

137
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,500
Master, I never said I wouldn't fly.

138
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:15,700
But, right now, I really don't have the strength to fly.

139
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,200
He does have to practice his martial arts, but he can't practice if he suffers from heatstroke.

140
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:22,200
I think Chengling really can't take it anymore.

141
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:25,700
How about we let him get back on the cart and rest for a while?

142
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,400
Keep practicing!

143
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:32,200
Is he your disciple or mine? Are you teaching him or am I?

144
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,400
Fine, fine. I'll shut my mouth. What you say is right.

145
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,200
What is wrong with Old Wen these past few days?

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:43,200
He has the air of a wife who's been wronged.

147
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,800
What mischief is he planning this time?

148
00:09:57,300 --> 00:09:59,800
Greetings, My Lord and Scorpion King.

149
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,800
Brother Changing. Brother Lustful.

150
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,900
Then, this must be Brother Happy.

151
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:08,600
I've been a poor host.

152
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,400
Brother Zhao. Scorpion King.

153
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:14,600
Brother Zhao, this time, you're really scheming behind the scenes.

154
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:18,600
I, Changing, feel heartfelt admiration.

155
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,200
Not at all, you're too kind.

156
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,400
The Heroes Conference at Mount Jun proceeded smoothly

157
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:27,800
only with the contributions of Brother Changing and all of these Ghost brothers.

158
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,800
Greetings, Zhao...

159
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,000
Alliance Leader Zhao.

160
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,800
Greetings, Scorpion King.

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,000
No wonder Brother Happy has such a nickname.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,600
- He really makes people happy at first sight!
- Lustful.

163
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,200
Alliance Leader Zhao, you've finally succeeded in your great cause. The future supreme leader of the martial arts world,

164
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,600
who could it be but you?

165
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,800
We are all brothers. There's no need to be so courteous. The future is long.

166
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,400
At present, the whereabouts of the Glazed Armor are still unclear.

167
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:00,000
In the future, there are many areas where I will have to rely on you all.

168
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Brother Zhao, are you saying that at the Heroes Conference,

169
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:08,700
the Glazed Armor pieces that Gao Chong destroyed were fake?

170
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:15,100
I just wouldn't want my brothers to waste all their efforts.

171
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:17,800
I know Gao Chong like the palm of my hand.

172
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,200
What he did was purely to fool people.

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,600
With his death, he wanted to stop everyone from fighting for the real Glazed Armor.

174
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:29,800
He must have arranged a suitable place for the real Glazed Armor.

175
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:32,600
Therefore, you will all have to work hard to track it down.

176
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:36,300
Also, with regards to the search for Hanging Ghost,

177
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,600
you all must set your hearts on that, too. But as for the Five Lakes Alliance,

178
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:45,200
don't worry. Leave it to me. You don't need to worry about it.

179
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,000
Speaking of that,

180
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:50,800
there is still one thing I don't understand.

181
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:56,000
You see, Wen Kexing says Hanging Ghost stole his Glazed Armor.

182
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,360
Doesn't the Five Lakes Alliance

183
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,500
have five pieces of the Glazed Armor?

184
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:09,700
How many pieces do you have?

185
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,540
- Brother Changing.
- Yes?

186
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,630
That which you should know, I will naturally tell you.

187
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:27,540
That which you shouldn't know, why worry about it?

188
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:43,200
What are you doing?

189
00:12:44,770 --> 00:12:48,190
Having us mix it up with these upright dogs,

190
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:52,980
our efforts gain us no favors. What good can come of it?

191
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:57,890
Besides, I think that Zhao Jing and the Scorpion King

192
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:05,650
are also insane, deep down in their bones.

193
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:09,070
Don't I know they are both mad?

194
00:13:09,070 --> 00:13:12,910
If they weren't mad, how could they have come up with such a plan?

195
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:17,240
If they hadn't come up with such a plan, how could I realize...

196
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,260
the thoughts in my heart?

197
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,880
What do you want to do?

198
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:31,280
He wants to be Chief of the Valley!

199
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,640
What is so great about becoming Chief of the Valley?

200
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,250
Constantly guarding against three thousand ghosts wanting to replace you.

201
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:43,170
Who can live watching their back every moment?

202
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:45,010
They all must die.

203
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:50,240
That's right. So what if one becomes Chief of the Valley?

204
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:52,500
They still can't see the light of day

205
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,830
all the same.

206
00:13:55,830 --> 00:14:00,450
Even a fierce and ruthless chief like Wen Kexing

207
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:04,390
still cannot escape being swallowed by fate in the end.

208
00:14:04,390 --> 00:14:06,450
Then, what are you thinking?

209
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:10,630
Have you never thought about

210
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,450
returning to the human realm?

211
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:22,040
To ride the fastest horse,

212
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,130
to drink the strongest wine,

213
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:29,020
to toy with the most beautiful women.

214
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:31,550
Yes! Yes!

215
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,810
To kill

216
00:14:33,810 --> 00:14:35,980
the most ruthless

217
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,690
enemy.

218
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,920
I have!

219
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:47,350
I even think about it in my dreams!

220
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:52,910
Old Changing, if you put on a disguise, no one would recognize

221
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:56,550
that you are the leader of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts.

222
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,390
However, with this face of mine

223
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,840
and this breathing affliction of mine

224
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,830
that makes it hard to speak,

225
00:15:11,830 --> 00:15:15,190
who wouldn't recognize me?

226
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,290
If I told you

227
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,430
that the armory is hiding a sacred artifact

228
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,810
that can revive the dead, put flesh on bones,

229
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:30,230
and heal all of the severe illnesses,

230
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:35,180
and it's from the Miracle Healer Valley, what would you think?

231
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:52,680
Old Wen, come with me to get something to eat.

232
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:55,200
You rest a while, I'll go.

233
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:57,800
Filial disciple, come with me to get something to eat.

234
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,580
Uncle Wen, I can't even move my little finger.

235
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:05,060
Chengling is not allowed to go. He still needs to practice.

236
00:16:06,130 --> 00:16:07,350
Master!

237
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:10,080
The move that I taught you yesterday.

238
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:13,000
Practice it another five hundred times before dinner.

239
00:16:14,090 --> 00:16:18,160
By the way, catch two fish. I want to drink fish soup tonight.

240
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,110
And I'd like to drink old monster soup!

241
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:22,260
Why don't you boil it yourself?

242
00:16:22,260 --> 00:16:24,160
You rascal!

243
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
Who gave you permission to be so arrogant?

244
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:46,130
A'Xu, have a taste.

245
00:16:46,130 --> 00:16:49,520
Hey! You youngster, don't you know to respect your elders?

246
00:16:52,510 --> 00:16:54,820
Never mind, I'll fill another bowl.

247
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:00,270
A'Xu.

248
00:17:00,270 --> 00:17:02,570
Thanks, Old Wen.

249
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,540
- Chengling.
- Yes?

250
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,600
Take this bowl of soup to Young Cabinet Master Long.

251
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:14,420
If he wants it, feed it to him.

252
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,140
Yes.

253
00:17:18,830 --> 00:17:20,460
A'Xu.

254
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:24,700
Why do you call that stinker "Young Cabinet Master"?

255
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:27,070
Qin Huaizhang and Long Que were close friends in life and death.

256
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,020
The fact that Long Que met that little beast Rong Xuan

257
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:31,510
is due to Qin Huaizhang's introduction.

258
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,510
"Little beast"?

259
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:39,060
Who is Rong Xuan to you? Moreover, how do you know about his relationships with these people?

260
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,920
You want to know?

261
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,630
Why do you poke your nose in everything like an old woman?

262
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:49,590
Elder, our trek to Shu is a long trek through high mountains.

263
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,450
How do you know that the Dragon Pool Cabinet will have answers?

264
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:54,360
Aside from those that started this evil,

265
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,940
the only insider still alive from that time is Long Que.

266
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,580
We have no choice but to go to him if we want to truth.

267
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,110
Elder. Master.

268
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,850
Who exactly is Long Que?

269
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:08,540
Dragon Pool Cabinet; Old Cabinet Master Long Que.

270
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:11,280
He is your grand master's close friend.

271
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,850
The basic mechanical traps and strategems at Four Seasons Mountain Villa

272
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,980
were all learned from Dragon Pool Cabinet.

273
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,000
When I first entered my master's tutelage,

274
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,950
Old Cabinet Master Long often came to visit,

275
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:24,080
but for some unknown reason,

276
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:26,650
he suddenly disappeared.

277
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:29,800
There was some misunderstanding between him and Master,

278
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:33,230
so he didn't seek him out. Only later,

279
00:18:33,230 --> 00:18:37,380
Master received a letter carried by a mechanical sparrow, asking for help.

280
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:41,060
That's when he knew something was up, so he went to Shu several times.

281
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:44,940
Then, Master, did Grand Master find him?

282
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:47,430
No.

283
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:51,590
Nobody knows where Dragon Pool Cabinet truly is.

284
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:56,490
It's rumored that it's a movable fortress inside a mountain.

285
00:18:56,490 --> 00:19:01,460
At the time, the Window of Heaven was still not influential. I sent people in search of it several times.

286
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:06,380
Every time, the people who went searching told me that there was nothing wrong with the marked address.

287
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:10,600
However, whenever they arrived at the address, there was no trace.

288
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,880
Isn't it just because they're useless? With such a useless leader, those below it would be even more so.

289
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,780
Useless disciple. Useless friend.

290
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:21,570
However, I approve of the soup.

291
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,600
How were you able to live for so long without having anyone strangle you to death?

292
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,830
My martial arts is good.

293
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:32,380
Elder Ye, careful. There might be poison in the soup.

294
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,180
You're not having any?

295
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:57,730
Have a seat, my brothers, make yourselves at ease.

296
00:20:02,730 --> 00:20:05,390
Where did the leaders of Giant Whale Sect and Purple Wave Dock

297
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,190
go?

298
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:12,750
These punks have betrayed us!

299
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:16,310
They even spread the word that they were breaking their oath and leaving the alliance.

300
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:19,560
Now that the Five Lakes Alliance has run into such a large problem,

301
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:23,290
it is inevitable that some people would have a change of heart.

302
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,230
It is only natural.

303
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:29,240
Great Warrior Zhao, you are kind and generous,

304
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,430
but what these punks are doing...

305
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:34,610
they are now treating the oath they took when they joined the alliance

306
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,710
like bamboo!

307
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,130
Having chewed out all its sweetness, they now want to spit it out!

308
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:41,550
Could such a sweet deal ever exist?

309
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:43,390
In the hundred-year history of the Five Lakes Alliance.

310
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:45,130
there has never before been stories of

311
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:47,160
an alliance leader who worked with evil elements

312
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:49,380
in order to scheme against a brother like this.

313
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,070
Really.

314
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:54,660
There is still no evidence to prove whether our alliance's former supreme leader worked with Ghost Valley.

315
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:58,050
The charge of killing a brother is also a serious one.

316
00:20:58,050 --> 00:21:00,270
We can let outsiders speculate all they want,

317
00:21:00,270 --> 00:21:03,890
but we can't have confusion within our own ranks!

318
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,870
Great Warrior Zhao! It has only been a few days.

319
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,960
Those who fought over Gao Chong's body back then

320
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:12,030
have all died in terrible ways.

321
00:21:12,030 --> 00:21:14,230
Is that not enough evidence

322
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,190
to show that Ghost Valley is avenging Gao Chong's death?

323
00:21:17,190 --> 00:21:21,250
- Don't you think?
- The Elder of Kongtong died by the Happy Ghost's hand.

324
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,260
Sun Zhong of Eagle Claw Sect died violently in the street.

325
00:21:24,260 --> 00:21:27,270
Sixteen disciples of the Iron Fist Gang died in an inn,

326
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:30,090
one word carved on each of their chests,

327
00:21:30,090 --> 00:21:32,300
forming the sentence: "Kill one of mine...

328
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,960
...and I eliminate your whole sect.

329
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,530
Ghosts of Mount Qingya will avenge even a glare."

330
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,170
At this moment, the martial arts world is full of fear.

331
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:44,040
Moreover, it is full of resentful complaints against the Five Lakes Alliance.

332
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,820
If we don't overcome this hurdle

333
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,340
the departure of Giant Whale and Golden Tiger

334
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:50,550
will be just the beginning.

335
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,220
Although I am not talented,

336
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,600
but I know in my heart

337
00:22:01,030 --> 00:22:04,220
that the more dangerous and difficult it is,

338
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:08,680
the more we as brothers need to unite as one.

339
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:12,760
The Five Lakes Alliance was not built in a day.

340
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,840
Only by gathering our strength and moving forward

341
00:22:14,840 --> 00:22:18,530
can we show the world our determination.

342
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:22,280
The Five Lakes Alliance has unfortunately encountered this misfortune,

343
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:26,950
but as long as you believe in me,

344
00:22:26,950 --> 00:22:30,000
I, Zhao Jing, will use all of my strength to

345
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,700
protect the name of the Five Lake Alliance.

346
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,490
I'll let our Five Lakes Alliance

347
00:22:35,490 --> 00:22:38,160
continue for another hundred years!

348
00:23:14,070 --> 00:23:17,460
You disrespectful elder.

349
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,730
You irreverent child.

350
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:23,860
I call you fat, and you really start panting! Who are you calling a kid? How old could you be?
(T/N: idiom - that he's narcissistically accepting Kexing's words)

351
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:27,280
You really adopted the manner of a highly respected elder.

352
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:31,360
I'm not your elder. I'm your ancestor.

353
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:33,980
Weird old monster.

354
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:37,690
[Giant Whale Gang]

355
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:40,250
This infuriates me!

356
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:44,190
Leader, you should reconsider leaving the Five Lakes Alliance.

357
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,380
Reconsider, my ass!

358
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:51,720
Zhao Jing is cowardly and weak. He is not someone we can rely on to get things done!

359
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:56,240
With him as the leader, the alliance will fall into ruins sooner or later!

360
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,400
What is it?

361
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:07,710
In painting a dragon or tiger, it is difficult to paint its bones. In knowing a person's face, it is difficult to know his heart.

362
00:24:07,710 --> 00:24:13,530
Leader Wang, we have always been like-minded and have always had friendly interactions.

363
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:18,620
But now you speak of me like this behind my back. As your little brother, my heart hurts.

364
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:22,830
Exactly! Wang Moxuan, aren't you acting like a snob right now?

365
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:25,410
Shouldn't you quickly kneel in front of the alliance leader and kowtow to admit your wrongs?

366
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:29,480
Our leader is a benevolent person, he can spare your moment of muddle-headedness.

367
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:33,230
Four Great Assassins, Venomous Scorpions?

368
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:40,460
Alliance Leader Zhao, the rumors are not false.

369
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:44,750
You have truly been associating yourself with Venomous Scorpions.

370
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:47,320
Shut your bird's beak!

371
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:49,720
Brother Wang, you have misunderstood.

372
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:52,210
The Venomous Scorpions have pledged allegiance to the Five Lakes Alliance.

373
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:55,210
In the future, we are all brothers of the same family.

374
00:24:55,210 --> 00:24:58,180
We should all get along properly.

375
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:05,690
How can we the Giant Whale Gang coexist in peace

376
00:25:05,690 --> 00:25:08,060
with the Venomous Scorpions?

377
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:11,150
Men! Send the guests out!

378
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,510
Men!

379
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:16,820
You—

380
00:25:22,670 --> 00:25:24,860
What have you done to the brothers in my gang?

381
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:27,200
Brother Wang, don't be anxious yet.

382
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:31,310
There is a rumor within the martial arts world that the Giant Whale Gang wishes to split up with the Five Lakes Alliance.

383
00:25:31,310 --> 00:25:33,540
I believe that this is definitely not your intention.

384
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:38,260
It is definitely those younger disciples talking nonsense and creating rumors.

385
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,780
Am I right?

386
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:41,610
Right, my ass!

387
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:47,920
The Giant Whale Gang does intend to break all ties with the Five Lakes Alliance!

388
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:51,440
If you have the skills, then kill me!

389
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:56,250
Leader! Leader!

390
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:59,370
Xie'er, why did you kill him?

391
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:02,320
Father, you heard him just now.

392
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:05,670
- He said if we had the skills, we should kill him.
- Leader!

393
00:26:05,670 --> 00:26:08,720
I believe that I do have the skills.

394
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,770
Nonsense!

395
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:14,610
You had already returned from evil to good, so how could you kill someone so readily?

396
00:26:14,610 --> 00:26:16,520
Stand down!

397
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,150
Yes.

398
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:32,540
Elder Ye, do you want some nuts? They are from the Wolong shop. Super delicious, fragrant, and crispy.

399
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,950
You brat. Are you slacking off?

400
00:26:34,950 --> 00:26:37,690
No, no. I've practiced for such a long time.

401
00:26:37,690 --> 00:26:40,050
It was Uncle Wen who let me eat the nuts.

402
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:43,130
He said I should nourish my body so I have the energy to continue training.

403
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:45,460
You're slacking off, and yet you have so many excuses.

404
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:48,470
Hey, even if they're delicious, you can't just take them all! Leave some for me!

405
00:26:48,470 --> 00:26:51,720
Your slacking time is over! Continue practicing.

406
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,160
[Wangchen Inn]

407
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,200
[Wolong]

408
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:16,720
Here.

409
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:46,620
Master, I didn't do it wrong!

410
00:27:46,620 --> 00:27:50,520
You've practiced a few thousand times. It is expected of you to not make mistakes.

411
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,650
This is called the Passing Clouds Steps, not the Dance of Dogs and Bears.

412
00:27:54,650 --> 00:27:56,700
You look even uglier than a crawling spider.

413
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,060
Again! Straighten your waist and back!

414
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,100
A'Xu, don't use my Wolong nuts to discipline your disciple.

415
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:04,820
It's a waste of a heavenly item.

416
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:07,380
I was in line for a really long time before I could buy them.

417
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:10,860
Master, this is too heavy. My waist cannot withstand it.

418
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:12,250
Can't you remove some of the load?

419
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,770
Do you believe that I will just remove your legs?

420
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:25,530
A'Xu, only after seeing you teach your disciple,

421
00:28:25,530 --> 00:28:28,070
I realize that my master back then

422
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:30,340
was actually really lenient on me.

423
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:32,440
Who was your master?

424
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:34,990
My own father.

425
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:40,220
How could a father teach his son? No wonder your skills are so bad.

426
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,800
When you teach a disciple, you should teach them like this.

427
00:28:43,610 --> 00:28:47,520
And which expert martial artists have you taught?

428
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:54,630
I didn't realize that your martial arts are so bad, but so are your drinking skills.

429
00:28:56,060 --> 00:28:59,190
Bottoms up!

430
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:06,480
Converge your energy, condense it at your field of elixir. Your energy will grow.

431
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,690
Silly brat, it is easier for you to spread your energy than to gather it.

432
00:29:09,690 --> 00:29:12,990
Spread it out like cotton towards your four limbs and bones.

433
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:16,570
Once you use your energy to fuel your body, you will naturally find strength.

434
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,850
Who told you to listen to him? Silly boy.

435
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,550
Keep your breathing constant. Bring your energy to your Conception and Governor vessels
(T/N: acupuncture points)

436
00:29:28,550 --> 00:29:30,470
as if they are rivers flowing into the ocean smoothly without a trace!

437
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:38,450
Listening to me is right.

438
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:41,940
Your inner energy has a shape. Its spirit is like a snake, without stopping,

439
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:44,370
moving about freely.

440
00:29:57,630 --> 00:30:00,850
- Let go!
- A'Xu, don't cause trouble. Chengling, he—

441
00:30:13,260 --> 00:30:16,720
Now it's great. The two of you have forced your disciple to death.

442
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:18,420
Satisfied?

443
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,440
It's fine.

444
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,080
This is miraculous.

445
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:24,200
This child's meridians are naturally wider than other people's.

446
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:26,460
Could he be uniquely talented?

447
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,770
You're right. I found out long ago.

448
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:31,120
Chengling's meridians are naturally wide.

449
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,140
Just like a wide river, they must remain full of water.

450
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:37,290
Naturally, this requires more time than filling a small stream.

451
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:41,330
His skills improved slowly not because he isn't working hard.

452
00:30:42,790 --> 00:30:45,170
Master, what is wrong with me?

453
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:47,880
There is actually such an extraordinary individual in this world?

454
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:50,270
His brain is exceptionally stupid, but his muscles and bones are exceptionally good.

455
00:30:50,270 --> 00:30:54,660
Then, do the heavens want you to be good or bad?

456
00:30:56,510 --> 00:30:59,920
No matter how good his muscles and bones are, he has already accepted our A'Xu as his master.

457
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:03,320
Don't get any weird ideas just because you noticed other people's talent.

458
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,670
I have seen better.

459
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:13,160
Do you still want to drink or not?

460
00:31:13,770 --> 00:31:17,580
I will drink. Who's afraid of who? Come on!

461
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,970
A'Xu, be my witness. Today,

462
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,290
I must make this old monster so drunk that he calls me "father."

463
00:31:28,290 --> 00:31:30,500
Little brat, you're bluffing. Come on.

464
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,180
Come on!

465
00:31:32,850 --> 00:31:35,440
Chengling, are you all right?

466
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,270
If you really cannot withstand it, then practice again for another hour.

467
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:47,610
His meridians are exceptional. You can force him a little more, and he will still not die.

468
00:31:47,610 --> 00:31:50,510
Why are you talking so much nonsense? Keep drinking!

469
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:55,240
- Come on.
- Drink it all!

470
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:15,750
That idiotic Yu Qiufeng. How did he start collaborating with Tragicomic Ghost?

471
00:32:17,030 --> 00:32:20,740
Wuyang, the girl who was with him,

472
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,990
how old did she appear to be?

473
00:32:22,990 --> 00:32:27,510
Father, forgive me. My eyes are bad, I cannot really estimate.

474
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:31,050
However, based on her appearance and proportion, she seemed to be in her early twenties.

475
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:35,080
But her methods were fierce. Not like anything a young girl can pull off.

476
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:38,200
I was unable to go personally, so I could not fulfill your request.

477
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,480
Please punish me.

478
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:46,690
I only asked you to order the Venomous Scorpions to abduct Tragicomic Ghost.

479
00:32:46,690 --> 00:32:48,880
I also didn't ask you to stop people from abducting her.

480
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,430
All the experienced assassins have already died.

481
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:56,250
You are young. How can you be the worthy opponent of Mount Hua Sect's leader?

482
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,170
I naturally will not blame you.

483
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:03,410
These years, you have acquired the trust of the Yueyang Sect leader.

484
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,350
You have also helped me carry out many tasks.

485
00:33:09,140 --> 00:33:12,480
You and Huairen are both good kids.

486
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:17,860
Just that... Huairen was not able to wait until today.

487
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,560
Father!

488
00:33:20,170 --> 00:33:22,210
Father, the timing is too tight.

489
00:33:22,210 --> 00:33:25,250
I could only decorate according to the original Sanbai Mountain Villa.

490
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:29,260
It's just that... I still cannot come to a decision about this screen.

491
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:33,130
Do you want mountainous scenery or a painting of birds?

492
00:33:34,430 --> 00:33:36,130
Father,

493
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,090
who is he?

494
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,940
You may leave first.

495
00:33:43,350 --> 00:33:44,850
Yes.

496
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:52,590
Xie'er, you can decide on this small matter.

497
00:33:52,590 --> 00:33:54,370
Once you're done with arrangements, live there.

498
00:33:54,370 --> 00:33:57,420
I can just live here.

499
00:33:57,420 --> 00:34:00,410
That's unacceptable. Look at the poor condition of Yueyang Sect's accommodations.

500
00:34:00,410 --> 00:34:02,890
How can you stay in such a place?

501
00:34:06,330 --> 00:34:09,660
"I am a noble swan, my ambitions encompass the earth and sky."

502
00:34:09,660 --> 00:34:13,140
All these years, I've tainted myself with wealth,

503
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:16,410
pretending to be intoxicated with its luxuries

504
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:19,740
in order to numb those who are shortsighted.

505
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:22,740
But now,

506
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:28,080
the roc flies thousands of miles
(T/N: the future is bright)

507
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:31,050
and I look down on the martial arts world from the heights.

508
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,890
I no longer need to use an act to misguide others.

509
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,610
Yes.

510
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,020
What you say is right.

511
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,890
It's just that I have already arranged everything.

512
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:52,800
Father, I personally picked everything.

513
00:34:57,550 --> 00:35:03,250
Xie'er, a man should not put his concern on external things.

514
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,440
What I dislike most is that you are temperamental and lack focus.

515
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,290
You must stay focused on accomplishing your tasks.

516
00:35:09,290 --> 00:35:12,220
Put your energy on the main goal.

517
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:15,980
First, complete the task I gave you.

518
00:35:15,980 --> 00:35:17,510
Yes.

519
00:35:18,650 --> 00:35:20,750
Me first!

520
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:26,080
Keep drinking. Bottoms up! Drink it all!

521
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,070
- Why do I have to?
- You have a big mouth!

522
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,420
I...!

523
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,710
How is my mouth big?

524
00:35:33,710 --> 00:35:35,510
A'Xu!

525
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,920
A'Xu!

526
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,650
A'Xu! This... This old monster says my mouth is big!

527
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:46,410
This mouth of mine is clearly just right, isn't it?

528
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:49,820
A'Xu!

529
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,890
I found it!

530
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,930
You have grown white hair!

531
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:21,030
You even say I'm like an old lady, clearly, you're more like one.

532
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,840
So what if I have a few white hairs? You're so naive.

533
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,050
That's true.

534
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:30,210
Who knows how long an old monster like you might've lived.

535
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:32,530
What does it matter if you have a few white hairs?

536
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,380
But a man by the surname of Ye,

537
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,360
how old are you really?

538
00:36:39,560 --> 00:36:44,440
I don't remember anymore. Anyway, I should be long dead.

539
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,580
A'Xu!

540
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:03,010
A'Xu!

541
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:05,750
I... I...!

542
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:15,440
Get back to bed!

543
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,500
It's fine, I didn't drink that much.

544
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,770
I'm not going to say it again!

545
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:43,830
Youngster, you're so young. Why don't you want to live anymore?

546
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,920
Who says I don't want to live?

547
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:51,690
Those nails of yours haven't acted up lately, have they?

548
00:37:54,110 --> 00:37:58,490
You were enjoying it, weren't you? That's your death knell ringing.

549
00:37:58,490 --> 00:38:00,580
Your internal organs have already begun to weaken.

550
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:02,760
Your energy no longer has the strength to fight your internal injury.

551
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:04,880
Naturally, it no longer torments you.

552
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,740
I just can't understand.

553
00:38:07,740 --> 00:38:10,830
There are so many people in this world who deserve to die,

554
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:15,510
who try every trick in the book to stay alive. Why don't you want to stay alive?

555
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:20,170
There are only two choices in my life.

556
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:24,100
Either I live well or I die well.

557
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:27,800
Nobody can force me to choose a third path.

558
00:38:36,150 --> 00:38:40,400
Young Qin, this disciple of yours is really stupid.

559
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,270
Are all youngsters these days so stupid?

560
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:51,230
Changqing, tell me. When we were young,

561
00:38:51,230 --> 00:38:53,060
were we like this too?

562
00:38:56,220 --> 00:38:58,070
I don't remember, I don't remember.

563
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,050
I've lived too long.

564
00:39:00,050 --> 00:39:01,430
I don't remember.

565
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:05,420
[Wangchen Inn]

566
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:33,360
A'Xu, come, have some wine.

567
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,830
What are you looking at?

568
00:39:48,410 --> 00:39:50,090
Does it hurt?

569
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:55,570
Why don't you try it, too?

570
00:40:01,390 --> 00:40:03,330
I mean,

571
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,230
after all these years,

572
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:12,220
you're the only well-fated, agreeable friend I've ever come across.

573
00:40:13,290 --> 00:40:15,880
Could you not die?

574
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:22,220
I'll do my best.

575
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:28,010
Turn around. Look at me, and say that again!

576
00:40:28,010 --> 00:40:30,200
I don't want to look at you.

577
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,970
I can't stand looking at that fake act of yours.

578
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,290
Wearing a mask, with not an ounce of sincerity.

579
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,790
I... I'm afraid...

580
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:41,680
You're afraid that I'll die soon,

581
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:44,020
that I may die at any moment.

582
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,220
That's why you accommodate my every wish,

583
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:49,790
agree with everything and coddle me. Old Wen,

584
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,030
do you pity me, or are you humiliating me?

585
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,090
Don't go!

586
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,930
I'm not leaving.

587
00:41:13,110 --> 00:41:16,970
Once you wake up from your drunken stupor, I'm going to beat you up.

588
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:20,770
You know that I don't have much time left

589
00:41:20,770 --> 00:41:23,660
but you still put on a mask to patronize me.

590
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:30,770
I'm not pretending.

591
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:36,230
You're really deserving of a beating.

592
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:41,030
Go sleep your deep sleep. I'm not going to die any time soon.

593
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:55,560
There's not much time left, so it should be cherished even more.

594
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,180
Punk,

595
00:41:57,180 --> 00:42:01,980
I've said it before. I'm betting that I didn't make a mistake.

596
00:42:11,550 --> 00:42:16,920
I'm betting that one day, you will open your heart to me.

597
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:22,830
Before I see the outcome, even the God of Heaven

598
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:25,330
better not chase me off the gambling table.

599
00:42:25,330 --> 00:42:27,750
Open my heart?

600
00:42:29,550 --> 00:42:34,790
The heart is like a ghost town. What is there to see?

601
00:42:34,790 --> 00:42:39,190
Only after I've seen it will I know how to help you.

602
00:42:44,270 --> 00:42:45,870
Sleep.

603
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,890
After you look inside it,

604
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:01,040
you won't treat me as your friend.

605
00:43:36,870 --> 00:43:44,480
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

606
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:51,620
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

607
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:58,750
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

608
00:43:58,750 --> 00:44:07,200
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

609
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:14,210
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

610
00:44:14,210 --> 00:44:21,830
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

611
00:44:21,830 --> 00:44:25,600
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

612
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:29,310
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

613
00:44:29,310 --> 00:44:37,130
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

614
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:40,610
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

615
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:44,380
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

616
00:44:44,380 --> 00:44:52,310
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

617
00:44:52,310 --> 00:44:55,800
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

618
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:59,610
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

619
00:44:59,610 --> 00:45:06,660
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

620
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:14,750
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
