22
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:53,080
[Episode 36]

23
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:03,940
Master, that Prince Jin is so wicked.

24
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,960
Why didn't you kill him?

25
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:11,190
Chengling, the prince and I

26
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:14,330
have too many private entanglements.

27
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,280
For the good of everyone, I cannot kill him.

28
00:02:19,430 --> 00:02:22,400
Prince Jin holds power in the Northwest.

29
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,610
However, the people beside him all covet his position and monitor him closely.

30
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:30,010
If I kill him, the surrounding people will definitely rise in rebellion.

31
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,890
Only by injuring him and forcing him to remain sick in bed

32
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:37,780
to prevent anyone else from obtaining the throne

33
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:40,240
could balance between formidable enemies be achieved.

34
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,090
I don't understand!

35
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,590
Chengling, Jinzhou Army's rebellion has already become set in stone.

36
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:49,710
If your master killed Prince Jin, other people will replace him on the throne.

37
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,430
War will continue throughout the world.

38
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:54,290
There will be no balance of power.

39
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:57,480
Only when Prince Jin and the others are busy with internal struggles,

40
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,310
can the world have a few years of peace.

41
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,260
Lord Seventh, don't explain to me!

42
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:06,190
I'm stupid and don't understand, and I don't want to understand!

43
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:08,300
I just want to save my master's life!

44
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,320
Childish words! Chengling,

45
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,300
you must understand.

46
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:16,800
In the fact of righteousness,

47
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,580
what weight does my single life hold?

48
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,020
I personally raised this dangerous Jinzhou army.

49
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:28,120
Once the battle begins, lives will be lost.

50
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:31,760
At that time, I will be carrying

51
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,120
not only the regrets of Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

52
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,330
but also all of those souls that died in battle.

53
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,120
I'm-I'm sorry, Master.

54
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:46,230
Since Prince Jin has obtained the Glazed Armor,

55
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,350
he will definitely look for the Yin Yang Book.

56
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:50,600
Even if the Yin Yang Book may not be able to heal him,

57
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,040
how can I risk it?

58
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,870
What if he fully recovers?

59
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:58,880
Then all my hard work will have gone to waste.

60
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:02,890
Chengling, you don't wish for me

61
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,610
to die with this regret, right?

62
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:15,150
Chengling, our master-disciple fate

63
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:16,950
is too short.

64
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,690
I didn't have time to teach you well,

65
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:23,410
but you only have to remember one saying,

66
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:25,700
and you will be my good disciple.

67
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,900
It's also something Grandmaster always taught me.

68
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:31,230
"A great, chivalrous hero

69
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,120
lives for his country and his people."

70

[Heaven and Earth]
(T/N: From Li Bai's poem Spring Evening Banquet with Cousins at a Peach Plum Garden. "Heaven and earth are an inn for the myriad creatures of the universe, and time is its guest for centuries)

71
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:48,580
Being able to use this useless body

72
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:52,920
to perform useful acts is incredibly lucky.

73
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,920
How incredibly lucky.

74
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:01,860
There's no need to be sad, all right?

75
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:11,260
Wu Xi, Lord Seventh, Chengling, and Old Wen

76
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,460
are the people dearest to me.

77
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:15,620
Please take care of them for me.

78
00:05:16,170 --> 00:05:19,170
Zishu, I know.

79
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:26,650
What Prince Jin wants isn't the Yin Yang Book.

80
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,460
He and I come from the same lineage. We are both descendants of the Shatuo tribe.
(T/N: A Turkish tribe who helped the Tang dynasty fight off threats)

81
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,000
Because our ancestors earned merit in calming unrest, we were bestowed a surname,

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,950
appointed as military commissioners, and given the right to inhabit and populate in the land.

83
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:40,240
Only in this way were we able to achieve what we have today.

84
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,570
Zishu, you know of this.

85
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:45,230
However, if we speak of even farther in the past,

86
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:49,600
our branch of the clan was subordinate to Tuojie imperial kinsmen.

87
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,920
There is a legend within the clan saying

88
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:55,260
that when our ancestor waged war on the Central Plains,

89
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,560
he left behind a treasure vault.

90
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,000
The treasure vault hides the secret to a perpetually stable country.

91
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,060
Once this secret is found,

92
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,500
my clan can live a life of abundance.

93
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,560
There would be no more need to wander.

94
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,970
The treasure vault has six keys.

95
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,280
They are separately in the possession of the six major clan leaders.

96
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,750
In the possession of six clan leaders?

97
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,630
That's right.

98
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:28,290
Doesn't it sound a lot like Glazed Armor and the key?

99
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:35,460
However, my ancestors have many similar legends.

100
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:38,220
They are actually just empty wishes.

101
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:41,630
The more you listen, the more you become disillusioned with them.

102
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,290
However, I remember you once said

103
00:06:44,290 --> 00:06:47,490
that Uncle Zhou was secretly killed by the former prince.

104
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,490
This made me recall that when I was very young,

105
00:06:51,490 --> 00:06:53,990
the former prince once told us children

106
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,490
that the secret to a perpetually stable country could be found soon.

107
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,760
But after that, we never heard anything more.

108
00:07:03,420 --> 00:07:05,540
It was during that time

109
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,890
that the old prince grew very low-spirited.

110
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:10,600
Near the end, he would exclaim,

111
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:14,630
"The many years of searching ended up as a wasted effort,

112
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,930
the traitors have set me back," and so on.

113
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,850
It was also at that time

114
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,910
when I heard Uncle Zhou had passed on.

115
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,790
The Glazed Armor and the key

116
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,630
were things Master obtained during travels.

117
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:38,930
Was Master's friend...

118
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:42,100
my father?

119
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:48,920
The Glazed Armor and key

120
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,390
were all things your master obtained during his travels.

121
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:56,080
They were intricately made.

122
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,010
It is said that they were critical to opening some Songmo

123
00:08:00,010 --> 00:08:05,210
or Tuojie imperial kinsmen's treasure vault.

124
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:09,150
In Prince Jin's painting, the five pieces of Glazed Armor

125
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:10,860
all had their own unique appearances.

126
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,670
In the past, your father, former Master Zhou suddenly passed away

127
00:08:15,670 --> 00:08:19,500
because the former Prince Jin accused him of treachery and

128
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,110
secretly killed him.

129
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:27,580
It seems...

130
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:30,020
fate has arranged everything.

131
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:46,560
"Although one can escort a friend for thousands of miles, farewell cannot be avoided."

132
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,720
This is far enough.

133
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
Zishu, you and I both know

134
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,320
that the secret to a perpetually stable country

135
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,470
was just a legend anyway.

136
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:59,210
How could the world have something like this? Why must you do this?

137
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:02,330
Beiyuan, don't try to convince me.

138
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:06,120
If the legend is true, I have no choice but to go.

139
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,240
Even if it is fake,

140
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,940
I still have no choice but to go.

141
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:15,590
Think about it. On one hand, are the people of the world,

142
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:19,870
and on the other hand, are the uncertain number of days left I have of life.

143
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:22,500
If I succeed, I die with no regrets.

144
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:25,230
If I fail, I will have died for my ideals.

145
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:28,930
There's nothing to lose either way. Why should I be scared?

146
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:31,950
All right. This journey will take many days and nights and requires haste.

147
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:34,810
If you have any needs along the way,

148
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:36,950
just let the Peace shops know.

149
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:40,840
Zishu, don't worry about anything here.

150
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:44,290
I am not worried leaving everything to you.

151
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:54,730
Chengling, do you know what I am most worried about?

152
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,790
Repeat what I have told you.

153
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,560
Master's injuries are too serious.

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:03,580
Lord Seventh and Great Shaman have taken you overseas for treatment.

155
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:07,100
Junior Master and I are to rebuild Four Seasons Mountain Villa

156
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,980
and wait for your return upon full recovery.

157
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:11,960
Stupid brat, with that anguished face,

158
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,200
how do you expect your junior master to believe you?

159
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,680
You know. If you give it away,

160
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:20,120
who knows what your junior master will do, considering his temperament?

161
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,150
If you aren't afraid

162
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:26,490
that I will be pained and worried in the netherworld...

163
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:31,270
there's no longer anything I can do about it.

164
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:33,650
I-I will practice!

165
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:40,110
♫ are all connected by one thought ♫

166
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:43,870
♫ Where life's paths meet ♫

167
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:47,760
♫ Time and space change and fold ♫

168
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,600
The green mountains remain the same, and the rivers are long-lasting.

169
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:56,870
The world is large, and we will eventually meet again.

170
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,780
The secret to a perpetually stable country...

171
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:28,660
The legend... is actually true?

172
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,590
I don't dare to accept the glory of personally opening the armory.

173
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:40,620
Officer Duan, please.

174
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:43,420
Thank you, Scorpion King.

175
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,450
- Come!
- Yes, sir.

176
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:55,470
Break the ice!

177
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,340
Father.

178
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:08,600
We're revisiting an old place. Are you happy?

179
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:41,790
It's not opening?

180
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,620
Fake?

181
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:48,450
That's odd! The key isn't right!

182
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:51,290
That's impossible!

183
00:14:55,870 --> 00:14:57,380
This—

184
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:00,960
Fake?

185
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:37,610
Zhou Zishu!

186
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,280
Who else?

187
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:45,110
I let you two go.

188
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:48,070
Why is the Ghost Chief betraying me?

189
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:51,590
This key... is fake!

190
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,520
What's odd about that?

191
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,630
Even the Glazed Armor could be faked.

192
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:01,100
Why can't the key have fakes?

193
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:04,510
Where is the Ghost Chief?

194
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:08,510
Prince Jin didn't come?

195
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,330
Zhou Zishu,

196
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:14,100
even if you had superhuman powers,

197
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:18,300
- you better not think you can—
- So he didn't come.

198
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,730
That's good.

199
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,020
Avalanche!

200
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,690
Hurry, retreat!

201
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:40,790
Retreat!

202
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,020
Let's go!

203
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,130
Retreat!

204
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:05,180
Why have you come? Your injuries—

205
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,020
Bastard! You know to care about me?

206
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,590
Weren't we going to live and die together?

207
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,760
- How did you find this place?
- Nonsense!

208
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:18,830
How could I find you without following them?

209
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:21,050
It's not like I know where the armory is.

210
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,230
That hairpin!

211
00:18:37,070 --> 00:18:38,550
Are you a pig?

212
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,930
I knew I was going to fake my death.

213
00:18:40,930 --> 00:18:43,620
Would I bring the hairpin into danger with me?

214
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,040
Who would I entrust it to aside from you?

215
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:51,090
So the armory's key was always on my head?

216
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:52,180
That's right.

217
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:56,710
My parents knew of its importance, so they made this disguise.

218
00:18:56,710 --> 00:19:00,590
The silly thing is, the people of Ghost Valley searched every corner of my little courtyard

219
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:02,260
and never found it.

220
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:05,720
They never knew it was worn on my head.

221
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,430
If I hadn't brought that hairpin here,

222
00:19:08,430 --> 00:19:10,180
wouldn't we be at a loss for what to do?

223
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:14,160
You came to die, so you would definitely bring it.

224
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:18,110
Zhou Zishu, you stupid bastard!

225
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:20,550
If it weren't for Old Monster's loyalty...

226
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,320
A bunch of idiots!

227
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,860
What the hell have you all done?

228
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:30,080
Stupid beyond belief!

229
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,490
Sir Ye, please don't!

230
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:40,510
-Zi Shu said don't—
 - What do you know?

231
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,600
You are harming him!

232
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,160
They live and die together!

233
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,580
As soon as Sir Wen knows Lord Zhou cannot live,

234
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:48,480
- he'll—
- Shut your cursed mouth!

235
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,450
Who can't live? I haven't died yet.

236
00:19:51,450 --> 00:19:53,650
I won't allow anyone to die first.

237
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:06,350
Have you thought about what I would do once I found out about the results?

238
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:09,200
What? You aren't afraid of death? Am I afraid?

239
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,310
Don't light a fire. The oxygen here is limited.

240
00:21:04,310 --> 00:21:06,040
What are you scared of?

241
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,610
Since Rong Xuan and the others could train here with the entryways closed,

242
00:21:09,610 --> 00:21:12,530
this underground palace naturally must have a specific airway.

243
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,420
Saint Zhou, didn't you see death as a return to the homeland?

244
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,330
Why? You don't want to die anymore?

245
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,480
Who wants to die if they can live?

246
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:31,160
Besides, I hadn't met you then.

247
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:37,910
Who would've thought this Combined Six Cultivation Method would be even more mysterious than the Yin Yang Book?

248
00:21:37,910 --> 00:21:41,180
It truly exceeds the mortal realm.

249
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,340
As long as a person is alive,

250
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,210
there is definitely hope.

251
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,880
If there is no will to continue on, all is lost.

252
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:57,590
This certainly is a place for a bunch of messy men.

253
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,110
I wonder how my mother and aunt could bear it here.

254
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:05,210
This must be the place where they practiced their martial arts and weaponry skills.

255
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:08,190
The bookroom should be inside.

256
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:42,070
Yin Yang Book?

257
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:48,000
I actually found a treasure.

258
00:22:49,510 --> 00:22:52,790
A'Xu, this is the lost art of Miracle Healer Valley.

259
00:22:52,790 --> 00:22:54,690
Here, hold onto it for me.

260
00:22:54,690 --> 00:22:56,660
What if we can use it after we leave?

261
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,350
Setting aside whether or not this Combined Six Cultivation Method can heal my injuries,

262
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:02,160
the snow has blocked the road.

263
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:05,720
We can only leave once summer melts the snow.

264
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,580
We don't have food or water.

265
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:11,450
When I learned you ordered Peace Bank to buy large quantities of gunpowder,

266
00:23:11,450 --> 00:23:13,750
I knew what you planned to do.

267
00:23:14,890 --> 00:23:17,080
Stop looking! Let's go!

268
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:20,130
I'm in a hurry to know what that secret to a perpetually stable country is.

269
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:23,640
Perhaps there's something that can summon an ancestral demon god.

270
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,240
Wouldn't we be saved then? Let's go!

271
00:24:03,430 --> 00:24:06,950
Thirteen Transformation Formations of Cloud and Fog?

272
00:24:06,950 --> 00:24:09,060
Mount He Sect's lost art.

273
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:38,960
Essential Arts For the People?

274
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:42,030
What?

275
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:47,960
This is a book about agriculture.

276
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:51,420
When Elder Rong was stealing secret martial arts,

277
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:55,200
did he mess up and accidentally bring this one?

278
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,410
That's odd. Why does this stone vault

279
00:25:00,410 --> 00:25:03,890
only have books about farming?

280
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,740
I found it!

281
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,690
Combined Six Cultivation Method!

282
00:26:12,690 --> 00:26:14,470
It's this one!

283
00:26:15,650 --> 00:26:17,310
[Combined Six Cultivation Method]

284
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,460
It's all grain.

285
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:26,370
Old Wen, are you sure that we have searched

286
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:28,200
every secret room?

287
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,290
Why do all these secret rooms

288
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:32,510
only have farming tools and books?

289
00:26:32,510 --> 00:26:35,000
There's not even a single copper coin.

290
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:46,440
It's all grain?

291
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:48,890
Rong Xuan and the others prepared this?

292
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:55,190
Look at these seals. They are all in Tuojie writing.

293
00:27:03,910 --> 00:27:07,960
I originally thought we could rely on these grains to relieve hunger.

294
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,190
It seems that won't work.

295
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,520
How long have these grains been stored here?

296
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:25,120
Twenty years... shouldn't be enough to make them decay so badly.

297
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,310
I understand!

298
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:30,750
I understand everything!

299
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:35,220
This is the secret to an ever-protected country!

300
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,130
In the legend, as long as we found this secret,

301
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:42,130
the Shatuo Clan would be able to live a life of no worries.

302
00:27:42,130 --> 00:27:43,640
Look at all these secret rooms.

303
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:46,260
They all have farming tools and grain

304
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:49,360
and farming methods translated into the Tuojie language!

305
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:51,430
So this is the secret that the Tuojie ancestors

306
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,810
left for their descendants!

307
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,840
I see!

308
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:01,010
Once wandering clans learn how to farm,

309
00:28:01,010 --> 00:28:04,400
they can use farming tools to feed themselves!

310
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,570
Their country would be stable!

311
00:28:08,190 --> 00:28:10,350
That little Prince Jin of yours tried so hard

312
00:28:10,350 --> 00:28:13,050
just for this room of grain and farming tools.

313
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:16,290
His ancestral legend of a secret to a perpetually stable country

314
00:28:16,290 --> 00:28:18,730
was just to farm properly!

315
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,090
My stomach hurts from laughing!

316
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:25,250
That's why Uncle Long said

317
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:28,210
my master tried everything to gather Glazed Armor

318
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:31,950
yet found nothing after opening the underground vault.

319
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:35,220
He must've searched for it for the sake of my father.

320
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:38,940
My father... must've been asked by the former Prince Jin

321
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,560
to search for this secret.

322
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:43,590
In the end, he found a room full of grain.

323
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:46,200
When the former prince learned of this, his initial embarrassment morphed into anger,

324
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,560
which resulted in him killing my father.

325
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,650
No. That's not right.

326
00:28:51,650 --> 00:28:54,590
My father understood former Prince Jin's temperament.

327
00:28:54,590 --> 00:28:56,880
He knew that even if he told the truth,

328
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,660
Prince Jin would not believe him.

329
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:04,080
He would bring punishment upon himself and cause my master to fall with him.

330
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:10,150
Perhaps your father didn't even tell Master

331
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:12,440
what this treasure vault means.

332
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:17,950
So in the end, Master gave this place to Rong Xuan to transform into an armory

333
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:20,800
because this place was originally an empty armory!

334
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:24,120
Right now, I really want to know

335
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,550
what your little Prince Jin's face looks like after finding out about this truth.

336
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:30,500
It must be quite fabulous!

337
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,780
Stop laughing.

338
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,830
Snow has sealed off the mountain.

339
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:36,770
Even if we find an exit,

340
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:40,080
and even if we can leave...

341
00:29:40,730 --> 00:29:44,150
Say, how long can a person live

342
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:45,790
eating snow and ice?

343
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:49,030
Then guess how long Ye Baiyi lived

344
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,820
off of snow and ice?

345
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,710
Aren't you curious...

346
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:59,360
why that old monster is like a reincarnated version of Starved Ghost and eats like his life depends on it?

347
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:04,790
That's because he hasn't eaten human food in more than a hundred years.

348
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:09,360
Changing your fate requires payment.

349
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,330
By mastering godly arts, you can naturally recreate your meridians,

350
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:16,480
retain a young appearance

351
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,230
and live like a god.

352
00:30:18,230 --> 00:30:21,310
However, there are cons to this as well.

353
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:25,650
Ye Baiyi stayed on Changming Mountain for so long without leaving

354
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:29,500
because once one steps into the world of gods,

355
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:31,840
one must forever live in a place of extreme cold.

356
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:35,610
From then on, one lives in the wild and feeds on ice and snow.

357
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:37,640
If one eats the food of humans,

358
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:41,130
they will start to decay from their immortal state.

359
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,830
So that's why ever since we met Ye Baiyi,

360
00:30:46,830 --> 00:30:50,260
his hair has been growing whiter?

361
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:59,600
So the old monster has had enough of being a living dead.

362
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:03,000
That's why he's been eating as much as he can stuff.

363
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,600
Even if he doesn't want to live forever,

364
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:08,200
he still wants to recklessly eat as much as he can.

365
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:18,600
In other words, even if we leave this place alive,

366
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,200
in the future, we'll have to live secluded in an extremely cold place.

367
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,800
Eating ice and snow. Living with no end.

368
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:33,400
Either live like that or just die.

369
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,300
I'll have to compare them.

370
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,600
The Combined Six Cultivation Method requires breakage and then reestablishment.

371
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,000
We must first endure hellish suffering

372
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:47,000
before fully recreating our meridians

373
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,200
and obtaining a new life.

374
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:50,900
However, everyone's health situation is different,

375
00:31:50,900 --> 00:31:54,000
so the suffering will also be different.

376
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,400
Therefore, the two of us need to practice this art at the same time

377
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:57,800
and support each other.

378
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:00,100
When your partner is near the point of breaking,

379
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:03,500
we must use pure Qi energy to aid the other through their difficult time.

380
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,800
Then, don't I have a huge advantage?

381
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,400
To tell you the truth,

382
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:14,600
my senses of taste, smell and touch all slowly disappeared.

383
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,100
I can't feel pain anymore.

384
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,600
I know.

385
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:22,400
That's why Elder Ye and Great Shaman gave an extra warning,

386
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,900
saying that after we begin meditating,

387
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:27,100
there's a high chance that your sight and hearing will also disappear.

388
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:30,000
However, if that happens, don't be alarmed.

389
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,000
Just focus on the Qi energy running through your body,

390
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,600
and after you bear through each level, your five senses will return naturally.

391
00:32:36,600 --> 00:32:40,300
However, in the next level, this will repeat again.

392
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:44,810
I know. Let's start.

393
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:26,400
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

394
00:33:27,750 --> 00:33:33,800
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

395
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:41,980
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

396
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:49,200
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

397
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:54,200
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

398
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
A'Xu.

399
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
A'Xu!

400
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:04,200
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

401
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:08,500
If I tell you the truth now, it doesn't count as lying to you. Right?

402
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,500
You're a Commander of the Window of Heaven.

403
00:34:13,500 --> 00:34:16,000
You should've been very calculating and astute.

404
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,700
Why do you believe everything I say?

405
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,060
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

406
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:27,800
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

407
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:35,800
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

408
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:39,260
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

409
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:43,000
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

410
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:50,000
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

411
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,700
A'Xu...

412
00:34:59,370 --> 00:35:01,480
He's about to die.

413
00:35:05,810 --> 00:35:07,500
What's wrong with him?

414
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,200
I have a way to save him.

415
00:35:10,200 --> 00:35:13,200
However, it will cost you your life.

416
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,600
Are you willing?

417
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,600
I couldn't wish for anything more.

418
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Good answer.

419
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,800
Wen Kexing,

420
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:25,700
I promised you that I would save Zhou Zishu.

421
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:28,000
I have never failed anyone my whole life.

422
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:31,000
I will transfer my Combined Six Cultivation power to you now.

423
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,800
I'm sorry.

424
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:40,200
Weren't you also set on lying to me?

425
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,800
Lying to you just this once,

426
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,900
isn't a huge sin.

427
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,300
The one left behind,

428
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:54,700
suffers the most.

429
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,700
You are my senior brother,

430
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,500
so let me do this.

431
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:06,000
Wait for me! What's wrong?

432
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,400
I used to think you were faking madness and pretending to be stupid.

433
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,600
I didn't expect that you'd actually be insane.

434
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:16,000
Wen Kexing, are you happy?

435
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,800
Do you feel carefree and cheerful?

436
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:20,200
Is this the result you wanted?

437
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,600
You have no right!

438
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,400
An evil person is given a second chance when he sets aside his weapon.

439
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,200
If a good person does something wrong, how come he is never allowed to move past it?

440
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,600
It doesn't make sense.

441
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,000
I want to bet that you are the you I know.

442
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,600
Old Wen.

443
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,100
A'Xu.

444
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,100
Let's drink!

445
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:44,800
If you don't wash, you don't get food.

446
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:48,400
Instead of wasting time on searching for a cure,

447
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
why not travel the world

448
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,000
with my soulmate while I'm still healthy?

449
00:36:55,000 --> 00:37:00,200
We can live carefreely, so as not to waste this lifetime.

450
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,490
♫ You bear the weight of a thousand pains on your shoulders alone ♫

451
00:37:04,490 --> 00:37:07,800
♫ Why not split some to me? ♫

452
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:11,600
♫ Drink together for three nights and never
speak of sorrowful farewells ♫

453
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:14,400
The Combined Six Cultivation Method is fierce

454
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,600
and is not something a human body can bear.

455
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:21,000
Someone must be willing to sacrifice themselves as a furnace

456
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:25,000
to practice the pure Qi and return it to the practicioner

457
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:29,800
in order to establish upon breakage and jump out of the cycle of life and death.

458
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:33,000
However, this person's meridians will be ruined

459
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,000
and his hair will turn white overnight.

460
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,800
Someone once sacrificed himself,

461
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,400
forcing me to live with this immortal curse

462
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:44,800
for so many years.

463
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:49,000
In the end, it was all for this day.

464
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,400
It is hard to go back to a time of youth,

465
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,400
but there are always people in youth.

466
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,380
♫ The trees fall boundlessly  ♫

467
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:20,200
♫ as the Yangtze river rolls without end ♫

468
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:28,400
♫ Fear neither storm nor sword as long as we are both here ♫

469
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,500
♫ Raise the voice to sing when victorious and rest when not  ♫

470
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:35,400
♫ Unrestrained and unhindered ♫

471
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:43,000
♫ Gaining a soulmate who can provide comfort
where the wind and dust is helpless ♫

472
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:51,000
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫

473
00:39:04,210 --> 00:39:06,050
After the avalanche,
[Eternal Spring]

474
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:10,090
Zhao Jing and Scorpion King were forever buried upon the snowy mountain.

475
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:14,400
From then on, the Venomous Scorpions suffered major losses and disappeared from the martial arts world.

476
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,200
- Then, Master—
- What happened to the two brothers trapped in the armory?

477
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,400
- What happened to them?
- Did they die?

478
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:22,200
If one wants to master this outstanding art,

479
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,800
someone must be willing

480
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,700
to sacrifice their own body as the furnace

481
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,300
to return the practiced pure Qi to the practicer.

482
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,200
No matter how highly skilled you are in martial arts,

483
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:36,800
even if you don't immediately die,

484
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:40,200
all your meridians will be destroyed in the end.

485
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,600
So... did they master it?

486
00:39:42,600 --> 00:39:44,200
Father!

487
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:52,200
Good, Nianxiang.

488
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,200
What are you all talking about again?

489
00:39:54,200 --> 00:39:57,800
Aunt Gao, Master is telling us about the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

490
00:39:57,800 --> 00:40:00,400
- Yes.
- Don't listen to your master's nonsense.

491
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:04,300
Chengling, you speak of all this nonsense every day.

492
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:08,400
Once the children hear too much, they won't have the heart to practice martial arts.

493
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,200
Let's stop here and go eat!

494
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,800
- All right!
- Let's go!

495
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,400
Let's go! We're going to eat!

00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:55,030
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

502
00:40:56,560 --> 00:41:02,810
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

503
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:10,800
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

504
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:17,900
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

505
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,400
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

506
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:33,800
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

507
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,710
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

508
00:41:37,710 --> 00:41:41,400
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

509
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:49,200
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

510
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:52,500
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

511
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,400
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

512
00:41:56,400 --> 00:42:04,400
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

513
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:07,770
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

514
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,600
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

515
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:18,600
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

516
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:26,500
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
