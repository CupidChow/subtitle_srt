[Episode 18]

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:59,380
Chengling, carry this little brute on your back.

24
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,040
Let's get on the road.

25
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:46,520
Stinking brat, your lower body martial arts skills have improved.

26
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:50,780
Master!

27
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:54,080
You're making a fuss over nothing. Where's your propriety?

28
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,800
The road ahead is dangerous. If you don't want to die, follow my footsteps closely.

29
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,590
Qin Huaizhang's disciple, watch this foolish disciple of yours.

30
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:14,040
Stinking brat, I advise you to make better judgments.

31
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,240
Your cheap mechanism tricks won't work at all on me.

32
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:20,920
I can excuse your first offense, but if you dare try again,

33
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,990
I'll let Wen Kexing break your fingers.

34
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:28,400
Why me? Don't you know that my nickname is Philanthropist Wen?

35
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,650
How could I carry out something so torturous and cruel?

36
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,790
- A'Xu, you sort it out.
- Shut your mouth.

37
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,660
Master, why does the Dragon Pool Cabinet Leader live in such a remote place?

38
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:44,080
In a big world, there are all kinds of people.
(T/N: idiom, "In a big forest, there are all kinds of birds")

39
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,730
But living in such a remote place

40
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:48,750
with so many hidden mechanisms is frightening at every step.

41
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:52,250
What if he goes out alone and also gets lost?

42
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:55,660
Isn't that like putting mousetraps under your own bed?

43
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:58,700
Putting mousetraps under your own bed?

44
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,470
Once, a mouse came into my room. I couldn't catch it no matter what I did.

45
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:04,700
So I put two mousetraps under my bed.

46
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,800
However, when I woke up the next day, I forgot.

47
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,570
I took one step

48
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,610
and broke my foot by stepping on the mousetrap.

49
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,370
Stinking brat, people only ever hide

50
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,470
for the same few reasons.

51
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:22,320
Either he always feels like there's an enemy hunting him down,

52
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:25,920
so he must hide in a place that no one can find.

53
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,020
- Or else...
- Long Que is a rotten good person.

54
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,020
All his life, he's only ever been taken advantage of. He's never made enemies.

55
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:36,510
Qin Huaizhang's disciple, your master understood this best.

56
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:40,560
Then it must be the second reason: grief.

57
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,070
He will never be able to see the person he wants to see ever again,

58
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:45,050
so he might as well hide and see no one ever again

59
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,650
so as not to be reminded of it by every single person he sees.

60
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:50,380
If your master dies in the future,

61
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,800
I'd also want to find a place like this to hide in

62
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,860
and see no one.

63
00:05:55,890 --> 00:06:00,110
- Just like... just like Yu Boya breaking his qin?
- What?
(T/N: After Yu Boya's musical soulmate died, Yu Boya abandoned his love for music by breaking his qin into pieces and never playing music again)

64
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,870
Don't worry. It won't happen.

65
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,590
Master's internal skills are superb, and he always does good deeds. He will surely live a long life.

66
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:11,210
"Those who kill and burn wear a golden belt."

67
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:15,650
"Those who repair bridges and patch roads have not even a full corpse." (T/N: Old saying that bad people live long lives of prosperity while hardworking good people suffer)

68
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:18,040
Do you want to die, stinking brat?

69
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:21,360
Elder Ye, lead the way.

70
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,780
Without entering the tiger's lair, how can you catch the tiger cub?

71
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:59,190
Don't you want to enter the Dragon Pool Cabinet?

72
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:02,850
It's right on the opposite side. What?

73
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:06,350
Are you afraid I'll trigger a hidden mechanism in an attempt to plot against you?

74
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:10,220
With three great masters escorting me,

75
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,290
can I really create a stir?

76
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,080
Silly brat, I'll carry him.

77
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:18,190
Let's go. Slowly.

78
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,920
Young Cabinet Master Long, forgive me.

79
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:29,220
In that case, I'll go over first, A'Xu.

80
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:33,050
Who said it's your turn? I'll go first.

81
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,950
- Elder!
- Old Monster!

82
00:07:56,090 --> 00:07:58,320
I'm joking with you!

83
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,430
Childish.

84
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,890
Come over!

85
00:08:11,890 --> 00:08:13,690
I'll cross first.

86
00:08:46,390 --> 00:08:47,990
Careful!

87
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,480
I faked my fall, you're falling for real?

88
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:35,570
Master!

89
00:09:35,570 --> 00:09:37,750
Uncle Wen!

90
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,160
Master!

91
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,480
Uncle Wen!

92
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,020
Master!

93
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:50,030
Old Wen.

94
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,490
Old Wen!

95
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:01,400
A'Xu.

96
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:05,610
Don't speak.

97
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,600
I'm not in much trouble.

98
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,000
It just feels like my internal organs switched locations.

99
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,000
I just need to get used to it.

100
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,600
- I don't know...
- Where's that stinking brat?

101
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,600
I didn't think he would really have the courage to burn his bridges.

102
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,200
If I'd been smashed into confusion,

103
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,800
shouldn't he have been a pancake?

104
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:49,350
He never fell down.

105
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,600
Can he actually fly?

106
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,100
Odd.

107
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,400
I watched the position of Ye Baiyi's every step.

108
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,600
How is it that his step didn't trigger anything,

109
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,000
but my step tripped a switch?

110
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,600
This trap...

111
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,400
must've been triggered by weight.

112
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Ye Baiyi's weight alone was not enough to trip it,

113
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,200
but the combined weight of us three set it off.

114
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,320
I originally thought that as long as we had Long Xiao in our grasp,

115
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,800
they would not attack for fear of harming him.

116
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,460
I never expected that Dragon Pool Cabinet's

117
00:11:23,460 --> 00:11:26,000
traps would be so remarkable.

118
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,000
Where is this place?

119
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Why is it so dark?

120
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,000
I thought I'd arrived in the underworld.

121
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,550
This place isn't all that deep.

122
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:59,800
If you hadn't done that for me...

123
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:06,040
things wouldn't have been bad enough to cause you to pass out.

124
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,000
As we fell,

125
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,200
we must've triggered the second trap, which is how we ended up in here.

126
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,000
Master!

127
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,900
Uncle Wen!

128
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:22,000
Enough, enough, enough! Get up, get up!

129
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,500
Stop howling in anguish.

130
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,000
Little fool, use your brain!

131
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,800
That stinking brat set off a trap and was the first one to fall down the gorge.

132
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,160
Do you think he would want to die with that pair?

133
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,400
There must be a trick.

134
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:41,200
That's right! Master surely wouldn't die!

135
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,400
Uncle Wen wouldn't die either!

136
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,600
Don't worry.

137
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,400
"Sinners live forever." Those two sinners

138
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,500
won't die that easily.
(T/N: Full saying: "Good people don't live long, but sinners live forever")

139
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:59,200
Old Wen, are you really nervous?

140
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,300
Why would I be nervous?

141
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:03,700
Then, why are you grabbing on to me?

142
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm not.

143
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,800
Drug Men!

144
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:34,200
At first, I wanted you to die a grave-less death,

145
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,400
but then I thought, this is such a wonderful setting.

146
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,500
If I make you die in confusion without letting you admire it,

147
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,400
what a terrible waste that would be.

148
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,850
Look at these adorable children.

149
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:49,000
My most delightful work.

150
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,800
This is the group of first Drug Men I produced. They are indeed a little dim-witted,

151
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,500
but anyhow, they are still my firstborn children.

152
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,200
I couldn't bring myself to destroy them,

153
00:13:57,200 --> 00:14:00,400
so I've raised them here in secret all this time.

154
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:04,200
Sometimes when people passed by, I would open the trap

155
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:08,200
and toss them down to feed my children some blood and meat.

156
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:12,800
I've been gone a while, so my children must be starving.

157
00:14:14,400 --> 00:14:19,000
Children, dinner will soon be served.

158
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:22,600
Turns out the Drug Men were created by the Dragon Pool Cabinet.

159
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:24,800
Uncle Long was righteous all his life.

160
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,400
I never thought his beloved only son would be such a sociopath,

161
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,100
working with the Venomous Scorpions to create the Drug Men.

162
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,000
Righteous!

163
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,600
He was an unparalleled idiot!

164
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,390
I am his only son.

165
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:42,600
He knew that there was something in this world that could fix my illness,

166
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:47,000
yet he allowed me to continue living with an appearance that was neither monster nor human!

167
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,600
This is an affliction you were born with. No cure could fix it.

168
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,400
Even a magical pill that can cure the dead

169
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,500
would not be able to cause you to grow.

170
00:14:56,500 --> 00:15:00,200
What do you know? Miracle Healer Valley's treasured Yin Yang Book

171
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:03,200
can cure all the strangest and worst afflictions in the world!

172
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:06,200
Back when Rong Xuan was severely ill with torn arteries,

173
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,600
Yue Feng'er could still save his life.

174
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:12,400
It can surely cure my affliction! Definitely!

175
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:15,200
All right. If you say so, it must be so.

176
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,000
“You are the knife, I am the meat."

177
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,400
As long as you are happy.

178
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,700
You!

179
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:27,800
Why am I wasting my breath on a dead man like you?

180
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,000
The old devil won't help me, but Heaven will.

181
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,200
Even without him, I can open the Armory all the same!

182
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:39,400
Too bad, you won't get to see

183
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:42,000
what I will look like when I stand up.

184
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Even if Rong Xuan's life was saved by the Yin Yang Book back then,

185
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:48,600
so what? He turned evil and became a monster in his madness.

186
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:50,600
Doesn't that matter to you?

187
00:15:53,400 --> 00:15:57,600
I almost forgot. You always were a madman.

188
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
Of course, you don't care.

189
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,600
What do you know?

190
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,000
You want to know the secret of the Ying Yang Book.

191
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,100
You are talking to the right person.

192
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:10,200
However, I don't like to talk to others while tilting my head up.

193
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,200
Do what you will with that.

194
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:14,200
You are a descendant of Miracle Healer Valley?

195
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,800
You could say that.

196
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:33,000
Bastard, who are you trying to trick?

197
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,350
All of the true disciples of the Miracle Healer Valley

198
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:37,500
are long dead.

199
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:46,400
Oh dear, I didn't manage to trick him.

200
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:53,600
Children, eat them clean!

201
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,700
Let's kill them all first.

202
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,400
Fuck! Why are there so many of these damn things?

203
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:37,900
A'Xu, can you carry on?

204
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,600
Does it make a difference whether I can or cannot? Don't waste your breath on useless questions.

205
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:45,070
If we can't get through this,

206
00:17:45,070 --> 00:17:47,000
wouldn't it mean I dragged you down?

207
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,600
Take back those depressing, useless words.

208
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,100
Old Wen, "As I have gained a noble friend

209
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,000
I have not wasted my life."

210
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,000
"I am fortunate to have gained one's heart that is like mine."

211
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:04,200
Listening to you recite poetry gives me a headache!

212
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,500
Long Que! I, Ye Baiyi, am here!

213
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
Aren't you going to come and greet me?

214
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,700
Elder, do we go in?

215
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:51,600
It will be full of traps inside. I'll go in and check the situation first.

216
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,500
Wait right here, don't move.

217
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:13,200
Mere little tricks.

218
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Elder Ye, watch out!

219
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,000
Kid!

220
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Long Xiao! Get your ass out here!

221
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,500
No wonder no one is able to find the Dragon Pool Cabinet.

222
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,000
Turns out that the pavilion is just an illusion.

223
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,000
The Dragon Pool Cabinet is in the bottom of a deep abyss.

224
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,560
Master!

225
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:05,080
Master!

226
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:09,020
Master!

227
00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:27,860
You didn't die after all! Where's my master?

228
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:32,120
At this moment, your master has probably begun his journey on the Bridge of Helplessness.

229
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,780
If you walk briskly,

230
00:21:33,780 --> 00:21:36,610
you might be able to catch up with him.

231
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:38,430
You're lying!

232
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:07,200
Thank heavens!

233
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,780
I can count on one hand the times I've been chased till I've pissed my pants.

234
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:12,840
Why have they all been for you?

235
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:16,910
Your predicament is called, "When you show off too much, you get struck by lightning."

236
00:22:16,910 --> 00:22:19,650
A'Xu! Lord Zhou, have pity on me.

237
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,740
Little old me has hardly suffered much in the lifetime.

238
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,320
Now, I've fallen into the schemes of others and have been put in this bad situation.

239
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:27,870
If I hadn't met you, my luck would have been all used up.

240
00:22:27,870 --> 00:22:30,010
I've just had eight lifetimes of bad luck!

241
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,660
Let's go.

242
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,810
We seem to be in the belly of the mountain.

243
00:23:09,230 --> 00:23:12,490
I'll scout ahead. You hold them off for a minute.

244
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:17,060
What? Do you think I'd survive if you threw yourself into danger?

245
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:20,960
It's not like we've never entered the tiger's den before.

246
00:23:22,310 --> 00:23:24,060
I've thought of a story.

247
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:26,840
- Once upon a time there was a man in the desert—
- Philanthropist Wen!

248
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:29,060
I've heard this story before.

249
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,430
I'm leaving!

250
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,700
♫ Heaven is ever-changing ♫

251
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:45,100
♫ There is no path to run back to ♫

252
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,210
A'Xu! Come on over!

253
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:58,430
♫ Can cross through dawn and dusk, and scrape the heart ♫

254
00:24:00,370 --> 00:24:04,180
♫ The mortal realm breaks, heaven and earth crack,

255
00:24:04,180 --> 00:24:08,370
♫ If we don't return, all resentments melt into cloud and smoke ♫

256
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:10,440
♫ How many reincarnations will it take to fill the gap ♫

257
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:16,810
♫ before the life and death of the shattered soul resolves? ♫

258
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:20,610
♫ The waves of the rivers and lakes return,
the universe remains ♫

259
00:24:20,610 --> 00:24:24,800
♫ Our inseverable fate
I guiltlessly steal the sun and moon in your eyes ♫

260
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:26,850
♫ if I follow the hero's way ♫

261
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:31,900
♫ I will rise and fall with the wind yet remain
between Heaven and Earth ♫

262
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:45,240
Many thanks.

263
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:49,520
♫ If we don't return, all resentments melt into cloud and smoke ♫

268

♫ If I follow the hero's way ♫

273
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:44,210
Turns out there's a paradise here.

274
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:52,100
Old Brother!

275
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:54,940
Where is this place?

276
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,290
Old Brother!

277
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,710
Old Brother.

278
00:26:20,220 --> 00:26:23,200
I never would have thought Dragon Pool Cabinet's mechanical puppetry

279
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,480
had already reached the levels of god-like creation.

280
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,820
What is this devilish thing?

281
00:26:29,310 --> 00:26:34,090
I never would have thought I'd live to hear you call something else devilish.

282
00:26:44,290 --> 00:26:45,940
Watch out!

283
00:26:57,890 --> 00:26:59,860
I just criticized it a little.

284
00:26:59,860 --> 00:27:01,920
Isn't blowing itself up in anger a bit extreme?

285
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:06,850
A'Xu, this fellow's temper has almost caught up with yours.

286
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:08,980
Fool!

287
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:22,030
As expected, sinners live forever.

288
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:30,390
That silly kid was crying like he lost his parents.

289
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:33,710
And here you are, entertaining yourself with cringeworthy jokes.

290
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:36,570
Elder, where is Chengling?

291
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,920
He asked you a question, Old Monster.

292
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,830
Where's our foolish disciple?

293
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:44,400
Lost.

294
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,860
Little Kid, you run pretty fast.

295
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:23,130
This Dragon Pool Cabinet of mine is crammed with traps and has thousands of holes and paths.

296
00:28:23,130 --> 00:28:25,290
At your level?

297
00:28:25,290 --> 00:28:27,690
Even if I let you run free,

298
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:33,510
do you believe me when I say that even if you were to starve to death, you still wouldn't be able to make your way out?

299
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:38,400
You are very stubborn. Not bad, not bad.

300
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:41,170
I like stubborn children.

301
00:28:41,170 --> 00:28:43,630
The more stubborn and unbendable your bones are,

302
00:28:43,630 --> 00:28:48,080
the more incredibly crisp the sound is when I knock on them.

303
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,830
Have you figured it out?

304
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:06,520
What are you rushing me for? Shut up.

305
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:09,140
Our foolish brat is still in Long Xiao's hands!

306
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,830
I suppose because he's not your kid, you can just lose him!

307
00:29:11,830 --> 00:29:15,320
Old Wen, this formation is complicated and constantly changing.

308
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:17,560
It's not something that can be solved quickly.

309
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:20,140
Then forget solving it. Smash ten of them with a blow.

310
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:23,880
Worst comes to worst, we can just force our way in. I'll clean the whole thing out with a fire.

311
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:28,060
Foolish young man. Do you know what purple molten gold is?

312
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,380
That's right, you don't know.

313
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:33,520
Just by looking at that ignorant look of yours, I can tell you definitely have no idea.

314
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:38,060
Old monster, you still have the spare energy to make fun of me? Hurry up and solve it!

315
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:41,370
Let me tell you. All you need to know is

316
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:45,270
that all the traps in this valley come from purple molten gold.

317
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,570
Once the gold catches fire, it will explode.

318
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:51,520
The force of it can send all of this up to the sky.

319
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:34,040
This is...

320
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,680
This is a map of the Dragon Pool Cabinet!

321
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:41,350
Let me go! Let me go!

322
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:59,700
Why are you holding me captive? If you've got the guts, just kill me!

323
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:03,310
Youngster, of course I'm not going to kill you.

324
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:07,160
You are the son of Zhang Yusen, right?

325
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:11,190
Twenty years ago, your father and my father

326
00:31:11,190 --> 00:31:12,590
were good friends.

327
00:31:12,590 --> 00:31:15,130
Why didn't you say that sooner?

328
00:31:15,130 --> 00:31:17,480
Your father is also good friends with my grandmaster.

329
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,340
Since we have this relationship, we can just speak directly if we have anything to say!

330
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:22,530
If we didn't have this relationship,

331
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:25,790
I could've let you die quickly.

332
00:31:25,790 --> 00:31:29,360
However, exactly because your father was a good friend of Long Que's,

333
00:31:29,360 --> 00:31:32,550
I will never let you die an easy death.

334
00:31:32,550 --> 00:31:37,730
Don't worry. The two of them are experts trained by me.

335
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:42,610
They will make sure you are very comfortable.

336
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,840
Where should we begin?

337
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:52,530
How about I dig out your eyeballs first?

338
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,480
The human eyeball is a good chemical ingredient for forging machines.

339
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:59,330
Wa... Wait a moment!

340
00:31:59,330 --> 00:32:03,940
Do you know why I like to be active underground?

341
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,880
Because from the moment I was born,

342
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:09,560
I have lived in endless darkness.

343
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,680
Since my fate is to belong to the darkness,

344
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:17,000
I have made it my home.

345
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,430
What's happening?

346
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,860
You like moving around underground so much.

347
00:33:10,860 --> 00:33:14,760
Could it be you were born to be a big sewer rat?

348
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,030
Purple molten gold?

349
00:33:16,030 --> 00:33:21,090
That's right. Your rat hole is full of twists and turns. Even if there was a map,

350
00:33:21,090 --> 00:33:22,910
who would want to crawl through them?

351
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:25,440
Might as well blow through them all.

352
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,550
My children!

353
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:30,800
What have you done with my children!

354
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:34,000
That's my child's heart!

355
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,340
Drug men are your children. Mechanical people are also your children.

356
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:41,730
You're a rat that specifically breeds a mixed bag.

357
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:46,730
This place of yours cannot reach the heavens or touch the earth. Where would I have found explosives?

358
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:48,570
Luckily, you've got enough children.

359
00:33:48,570 --> 00:33:51,580
They were incredibly generous and prepared to sacrifice themselves.

360
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:54,510
Here, I have one left.

361
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:57,980
- You can have it back—
- Old Wen! Wait! Wait.

362
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:07,480
Here, you tell us. Can we remove the needle from my disciple's head?

363
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:10,300
Zhou Zishu, you killed my children

364
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,560
and used their hearts as explosives.

365
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,150
I will never let your disciple go!

366
00:34:15,150 --> 00:34:17,950
Even if I die, I will take him as retribution!

367
00:34:20,630 --> 00:34:23,380
Stinking brat, you'd better think this through.

368
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,000
As far as I know,

369
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:28,190
a whole person and a person with four crippled limbs

370
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,600
will have two completely different reactions.

371
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,280
Would you like me to help you experience it?

372
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:38,120
I was born crippled.

373
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,050
You can't scare me!

374
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:42,600
I never intended to let you go anyway.

375
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:47,590
Elder Ye.

376
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,900
Why's this little thing stuck here?

377
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:57,740
Don't!

378
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,410
Why not?

379
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,960
What are you afraid of? It won't kill him.

380
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:05,030
If he dies, I'll owe you another.

381
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:10,880
Master, you came to save me again.

382
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,950
The word "again" is quite on point.

383
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:17,460
A'Xu, why didn't you check his birth sign and your year's luck before you accepted him as your disciple?

384
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:19,870
What an unlucky life this disciple of yours has.

385
00:35:19,870 --> 00:35:23,040
Meeting trouble at every step, calamity everywhere he goes.

386
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,740
Master, they were going to dig my eyeballs out.

387
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:30,500
Cabinet Master Long was a compassionate man for all of his life, yet you are vicious to the core.

388
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,460
Compassionate?

389
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,880
That old fraud!

390
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,210
Watching his own son living a life worse than hell.

391
00:35:41,830 --> 00:35:45,820
You can spew this garbage when you meet your father.

392
00:35:54,460 --> 00:35:59,550
Master, this puppet and this villain

393
00:35:59,550 --> 00:36:02,010
look so similar.

394
00:36:02,010 --> 00:36:05,580
This is the puppet that helped us find the entrance to the underground palace.

395
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:09,610
Long Que must have created it in his filial son's likeness.

396
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:14,720
Some people are born to their parents in order to collect a debt.

397
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,940
Master, what's that smell? It stinks so much.

398
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:04,670
As a walking corpse in a desolate mountain dwelling,

399
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:09,580
I am unable to treat my guests well, I beg your pardon.

400
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:52,180
[Long Que, Dragon Pool Cabinet Master]

401
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:55,560
This is Long Que?

402
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:57,290
Uncle Long?

403
00:37:57,290 --> 00:38:01,660
Zishu, it really is your voice.

404
00:38:01,660 --> 00:38:04,700
I thought I was dreaming.

405
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:08,770
Is your master well?

406
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,410
Uncle Long!

407
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:18,570
Uncle Long, you still remember me?

408
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:23,600
Master... is no longer around.

409
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:27,340
I remember. How could I not?

410
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:34,170
When a person is in so much pain that he cannot face reality,

411
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:38,330
all he can do is immerse himself in memories of the past.

412
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:41,470
The moment I close my eyes, I can remember how foolish

413
00:38:41,470 --> 00:38:44,370
you looked when you first entered

414
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:47,970
the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

415
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,830
Huaizhang has also passed.

416
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:57,130
That's right. For some people, even after they die, it's as if they are still alive.

417
00:38:57,130 --> 00:39:00,760
Some people live even worse than death.

418
00:39:00,760 --> 00:39:04,040
Considering the way this son of yours lives, it would've been better if he had been strangled to death at birth.

419
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:08,520
He is not my son, he is an animal. My son died long ago.

420
00:39:08,520 --> 00:39:11,080
I'm too lazy to give a damn about your messed-up father-son issues.

421
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:14,430
I also don't give a damn if you want to shut your eyes, plug your ears, and lie to yourself.

422
00:39:14,430 --> 00:39:17,270
However, this little animal of yours is out in the world, lying and harming people,

423
00:39:17,270 --> 00:39:20,930
making up stories under the banner of the Dragon Pool Cabinet. Are you not going to do anything about it?

424
00:39:20,930 --> 00:39:23,610
I can't do anything about it!

425
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:26,100
Uncle Long!

426
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:32,110
This evil creature has imprisoned me here

427
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,360
for who knows how many years.

428
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:37,920
You did such an evil thing to your own father?

429
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,460
You're even worse than an animal!

430
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,750
I'm an animal?

431
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,330
Then, what good is he?

432
00:39:44,330 --> 00:39:46,560
"A tiger is vicious but does not eat its young."

433
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:48,940
Yet he was so cruel to me.

434
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:52,030
He knew very well there was something in this world that could cure my illness,

435
00:39:52,030 --> 00:39:56,150
yet he allowed me to worthlessly continue existing, not truly alive or dead.

436
00:39:56,150 --> 00:40:00,070
Even though I treated him in this way, he still wouldn't help me.

437
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,630
What kind of nonsense is that?

438
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,380
Your father worried his heart sick over your illness. Who doesn't know that?

439
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:09,670
What he's talking about is wanting me to retrieve the Yin Yang Book for him.

440
00:40:09,670 --> 00:40:14,030
The Yin Yang Book in the Armory!

441
00:40:47,550 --> 00:40:53,930
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

442
00:40:55,200 --> 00:41:01,420
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

443
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:09,380
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

444
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:16,950
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

445
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:24,930
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

446
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:32,510
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

447
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:39,930
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river
But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

448
00:41:39,930 --> 00:41:47,790
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

449
00:41:47,790 --> 00:41:51,320
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

450
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:54,980
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

451
00:41:54,980 --> 00:42:02,910
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

452
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,490
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

453
00:42:06,490 --> 00:42:10,240
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

454
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:17,320
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

455
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:26,180
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
