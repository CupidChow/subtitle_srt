You should accept my apology for being rash instead.

Young Master, even if we did have a name card,

53
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,700
we can't just give it out to anyone we find on the street.

This is precisely what my father told me to do.

Look at his attire. What if he's a bad guy?

That's why I came here specifically to have a look at them again.

He can recognize the Four Seasons Mountain Villa's Passing Clouds Steps.

It seems as though you are also a good drinker of wine.

I followed you?

Didn't you say that if fate was on our side, we would meet again?

there are quite a few martial artists.

Each of them is heroic and has great martial arts skills.

Is this rhyme hinting that the Glazed...

I didn't want to spoil his mood,

00:24:09,170 --> 00:24:11,950
There's a likely chance that your father has already died.

325
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:13,450
No one is around to punish you anymore.

326
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,249
Hurry up and run away!

327
00:24:15,249 --> 00:24:16,929
My father won't die.

328
00:24:16,929 --> 00:24:20,030
My father is Qiu Yuejian, a great warrior of Mirror Lake.

329
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:22,910
How could I not know who your father is?

330
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:25,930
Qiu Yuejian once saved my life.

331
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:29,010
I paddled a boat in front of your house for three years

332
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:31,010
purely because I was looking for a chance

333
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:33,749
to return my life to him.

334
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:35,950
Hurry up and run away!

335
00:24:36,670 --> 00:24:40,949
Run towards Lake Tai and look for Great Warrior Sanbai.

336
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,089
Once you meet the people from the Five Lakes Alliance,

337
00:24:43,089 --> 00:24:44,310
tell them your identity.

338
00:24:44,310 --> 00:24:46,110
I'm not leaving!

339
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:52,769
I know martial arts! Uncles, hurry up and heal your injuries with your internal strength.

340
00:24:52,769 --> 00:24:53,930
I'll guard you!

341
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:56,330
[Road, brightness, ordinary, saint]

342
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,309
Silly kid!

343
00:25:22,310 --> 00:25:24,309
He's a good kid.

344
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:26,630
It's just that he's a bit silly.

345
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:41,210
Old Sick Ghoul, can you still stand up?

346
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:44,230
I need 15 minutes.

347
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,110
Fine.

348
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:49,689
Hanged Ghost, one of the top ten evil ghosts from Mount Qingya, is here!

349
00:25:49,689 --> 00:25:52,369
Be obedient and hand in the Glazed Armor

350
00:25:52,369 --> 00:25:55,130
and I'll make you suffer less!

351
00:25:56,650 --> 00:25:59,710
You foul ghost!

352
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:03,970
Go in!

353
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,790
Uncle Li! Uncle Li!

354
00:26:45,050 --> 00:26:47,270
I'll kill you!

355
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,499
I didn't expect that

356
00:26:55,500 --> 00:27:00,259
Qiu Yuejian would have cultivated such a useless brat.

357
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:41,019
I'll hang you, arrogant ghost!

358
00:27:41,020 --> 00:27:42,219
How dare you do evil in front of me?

359
00:27:42,219 --> 00:27:44,380
I'll turn you into a real ghost!

360
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,559
Smelly Beggar! You're good at martial arts.

361
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:59,920
Nice sword.

362
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:03,220
Master!

363
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:07,260
Brother, we've met again.

364
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,040
Old Li!

365
00:30:23,420 --> 00:30:25,220
Uncle Li!

366
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,820
Bastard.

367
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,500
I was almost brought away by the Grim Reaper.

368
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,339
Warrior! Warrior!

369
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,019
Hurry up and save him!

370
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,199
Why are you crying?

371
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:43,500
I'm not dead yet.

372
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:49,079
It's not too late to cry for me after I take my last breath.

373
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,160
Old Sick Ghoul,

374
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:58,239
your martial arts are good.

375
00:30:58,239 --> 00:31:00,320
Slightly better than yours.

376
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:31,300
I gave up.

377
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:37,479
I have never owed anyone anything in my life.

378
00:31:37,479 --> 00:31:43,660
Today, I can finally return my life.

379
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:47,040
I can rest in peace now.

380
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:54,119
You... You rode and dashed off my boat two times.

381
00:31:54,119 --> 00:31:56,360
One trip costs three mace of silver,

382
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:59,579
including the interest...

383
00:31:59,580 --> 00:32:02,519
If you're not a bastard,

384
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:05,280
you must repay me.

385
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:09,720
What do you want me to do? Just tell me.

386
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,100
I want you...

387
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:20,060
I want you to bring this kid

388
00:32:20,060 --> 00:32:25,859
to Five Lakes Alliance's Zhao Jing safely.

389
00:32:25,859 --> 00:32:28,739
Uncle Li! I don't want to! I'm not leaving!

390
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,640
Idiotic child!

391
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,420
You're a good kid.

392
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:41,219
it's just that you let your father teach...

393
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:45,300
teach you too well.

394
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:51,000
In the future... In the future...

395
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,620
Old Sick Ghoul, what's your name?

396
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,100
I'm...

397
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:07,459
- Zhou Xu.
- Zhou Xu?

398
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,779
All right.

399
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:13,019
Idiotic child, kowtow now.

400
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:17,500
In the future, you must listen to him.

401
00:33:19,420 --> 00:33:21,620
Hurry up!

402
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,380
Uncle Zhou.

403
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:36,640
Good.

404
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:42,500
Zhou Xu, he has paid his respect,

405
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:47,699
so you must be loyal to him.

406
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:50,020
I'll...

407
00:33:50,020 --> 00:33:52,740
I'll remember your name.

408
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:57,479
The Gods above will be watching you.

409
00:33:57,479 --> 00:34:01,960
If you break your promise,

410
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:06,960
then even if I am in the netherworld,

411
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:11,460
I will curse eighteen generations of your ancestors!

413

I promise you.

00:35:04,980 --> 00:35:07,520
- Quick, call the boatman here!
- Yes!

[Yuezhou]

420
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,660
What is going on?

421
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:19,220
What are you waiting for? Prepare the boats!

422
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,460
Senior, the boat has been gouged!

423
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,980
Senior, this one as well!
[Disciple of Yueyang Sect, Deng Kuan]

424
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,579
Senior, this one too!

Senior!

426
00:35:28,879 --> 00:35:31,660
The boatman is dead. His whole family has been killed.

427
00:35:45,760 --> 00:35:47,940
Do you know his name?

428
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:52,100
I only know his surname, Li.

429
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,419
Brother Li, Brother Li.

430
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,139
You have a sharp eye for talent.

431
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,019
You entrusted the kid to this Brother Zhou.

432
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:07,099
It looks to me like Brother Zhou has a prominent and sharp bone structure.

433
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,819
He must be a man who places great value on loyalty.

434
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:13,520
You may rest in peace.

435

Your name is Zhou Xu. Which character is Xu?

The Xu in "liu xu".
(TN: Meaning willow catkins)

439
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:31,939
What a good name.

440
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:35,299
A righteous and just man with the figure of a flying catkin.

[Here rests Uncle Li]

What's wrong?

443
00:36:44,919 --> 00:36:47,399
Uncle Zhou, I'm fine.

444
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:49,159
I just felt dizzy suddenly.

445
00:36:49,159 --> 00:36:50,599
Excuse me, Master.

446
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:52,459
Stop trying to be tough.

447
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,299
You're exhausted.

448
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,320
You need to rest.

449
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:59,580
No, Uncle Zhou. I can travel.

450
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,700
It wouldn't hurt to rest for one night.

451
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:12,259
A'Xiang! Set up the fire and make some food.

452
00:37:12,259 --> 00:37:13,779
That's unnecessary for you to say.

453
00:37:13,779 --> 00:37:16,240
They're already fully prepared. Hurry inside!

454
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:19,139
Brother Zhou. Master Zhang.

455

Please.

456
00:37:34,600 --> 00:37:38,259
Master! Master!

457

Brother.

458
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:01,259
Master, you eat first!

459
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,540
I will serve him, satisfied now?

460
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:19,499
Beggar.

461
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,339
Although you're good at martial arts,

462
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:23,619
you're incredibly timid.

463
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,579
What's wrong?

464
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,659
Are you afraid that I poisoned the food?

465
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:29,400
Return it to me if you're not eating. I'm still hungry—

466
00:38:31,260 --> 00:38:34,620
Brother, if you don't trust her, please eat this.

467
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,920
I'm not hungry.

468
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:38,760
This...

469
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:40,359
You're so cautious around us,

470
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:43,139
but you let yourself get extorted by that man just for three maces of silver.

471
00:38:44,380 --> 00:38:46,139
Do you even know who he is?

472
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,699
Still, you let yourself get into this mess.

473
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:50,659
Young Girl, what do you know?

474
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:54,859
When ordinary travelers make promises, they will absolutely follow their principles and see that they are completed.

475
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:58,979
Even if he must travel thousands of miles, he will go without fear of death.

476
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:03,459
Zhou, your action shows that you're a gentleman.

477
00:39:03,460 --> 00:39:05,019
What do you mean?

478
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,319
Master, stop acting literate.

479
00:39:06,319 --> 00:39:08,579
I have a headache whenever you act literate.

480
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,279
This is written in a historical record by Sima Qian.

481
00:39:11,279 --> 00:39:12,459
It means,

482
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:14,019
that even if he's an ordinary man,

483
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,739
once he made a promise, he will fulfill it.

484
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:20,119
Because of that, he would travel a long way without worrying about his life.

485
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:21,719
That is called a ranger.

486
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:24,019
My father made me recite this before.

487
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:27,139
Uncle Zhou, I...

488
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:30,060
- Thank you.
- You don't have to thank me.

489
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:46,799
What's wrong? You don't like that bread?

490
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:49,660
Here's a bun. Catch it!

491
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,660
I'm not eating your food.

492
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,199
Enough, Young Master. I saved your life.

493
00:39:58,199 --> 00:40:01,639
If you don't want the life I saved, then why don't you die?

494
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:04,139
Little girl, that's enough.

495
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:07,659
Your words are so hurtful. Be careful. You might not be able to get married.

496
00:40:07,660 --> 00:40:11,399
Indeed, people nowadays can't distinguish between good and evil.

497
00:40:11,399 --> 00:40:13,079
I saved his life just now.

498
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,639
I only scolded him slightly, but he glared resentfully at me.

499
00:40:15,639 --> 00:40:18,900
If you're so capable, why didn't you fight your enemies instead?

500
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,680
Coward!

501
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,899
Miss Gu, you're right to discipline me like this.

502
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:28,419
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

503
00:40:28,420 --> 00:40:31,060
Thank you for saving my life, Miss.

504
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:36,779
I didn't ask you to kneel.

505
00:40:36,780 --> 00:40:39,080
Enough, stand up.

506
00:40:56,100 --> 00:40:58,100
Brother Zhou.

507
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:00,220
Did you disguise yourself?

508
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:10,940
Young Master Zhang.

509
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,379
My name is Zhang Chengling.

510
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,739
Warrior, you may call me Chengling.

511
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:17,579
Don't you call me Warrior.

512
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:21,000
I have held a grudge against warriors for my whole life.

513
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:21,840
Master,

514
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:24,259
previously, this silly kid used to talk so much about being righteous

515
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,579
and helping those in need.

516
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:27,379
There were so many layers to it that it was almost like he was telling a story.

517
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,379
I thought he was so capable,

518
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:32,699
but it turns out that he was just bluffing.

519
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:36,880
When he actually needs to fight, he only had the capability to run away and cry.

520
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:38,459
I think your righteousness

521
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:40,499
can only exist in the theater.

522
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:41,379
You...

523
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:43,320
Me? What's wrong?

524
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:48,800
A true man never quarrels with others.

525
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:57,180
You're a man who can't even hold a sword properly.

526
00:41:57,180 --> 00:41:58,780
A'Xiang.

527
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:02,379
I haven't thanked you yet, kind lady.

528
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:05,419
You helped us at the crucial moment.

529
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,079
Stop calling me a kind lady.

530
00:42:07,079 --> 00:42:09,059
Listening to it gives me goosebumps.

531
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,840
My name is Gu Xiang.

532
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,499
We are indeed fated.

533
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,020
We met at the right time.

534
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:21,119
We also met at the wrong time, too.

535
00:42:21,119 --> 00:42:23,299
Fate is gifted to you by the heavens.

536
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:28,159
Aren't you and Little Young Master Zhang fated, too?

537
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,620
Young Master Zhang, you're injured?

538
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,779
I... I'm fine.

539
00:42:45,780 --> 00:42:47,920
Thanks for your concern, Master Wen.

540
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,339
You should be treated early if you're injured.

541
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,499
I've learned some medical skills from my family.

542
00:42:55,499 --> 00:42:59,440
- If you don't mind, I can...
- No need! I'm fine.

543
00:43:00,780 --> 00:43:03,600
He said that he's fine.

544
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,919
Stop hiding his injury and refusing my treatment, Brother Zhou.

545
00:43:06,919 --> 00:43:09,479
If this child dies from a worsened injury,

546
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,259
then it won't have anything to do with me.

547
00:43:11,259 --> 00:43:14,660
However, your ancestors in the netherworld would...

548
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:38,729
Master Wen, if you have ulterior motives,

549
00:43:38,730 --> 00:43:40,849
why don't you make it clear?

550
00:43:40,850 --> 00:43:42,449
You don't have to act.

551
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:46,170
If you're truly not our enemy, don't force him.

552
00:43:47,170 --> 00:43:48,870
Fine.

553
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:34,880
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

554
00:44:36,070 --> 00:44:43,230
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

555
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:50,360
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

556
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:58,840
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

557
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:05,800
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

558
00:45:05,800 --> 00:45:13,379
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

559
00:45:13,379 --> 00:45:17,219
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

560
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:20,859
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

561
00:45:20,859 --> 00:45:28,750
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

562
00:45:28,750 --> 00:45:32,170
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

563
00:45:32,170 --> 00:45:35,869
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

564
00:45:35,869 --> 00:45:43,879
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

565
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,329
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

566
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,120
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

567
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:58,240
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

568
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:06,460
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
