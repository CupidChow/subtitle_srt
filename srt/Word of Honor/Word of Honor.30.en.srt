[Episode 30]

23
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,000
The tea is quite fine.

24
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:18,730
Qianqiao, send them all away.

25
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,730
Regardless of how foolish Mo Huaiyang is,

26
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:23,530
he wouldn't have hidden the Glazed Armor here.

27
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:27,660
Why are they acting like they're doing their absolute best to find it here?

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,130
Yes.

29
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:32,200
We'll leave!

30
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:43,950
Your Majesty, how long are we going to stay at a stalemate?

31
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:47,760
How about...

32
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,880
I set a fire and force those bastards to come out?

33
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,590
What's the rush?

34
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:57,820
Mo Huaiyang can run now, but he can't run forever.
(T/N: Idiom, "a monk can run, but his monastery cannot run with him")

35
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:02,850
As long his disciples are still here,

36
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:05,120
we'll wait for him to come back.
(T/N: Chinese Idiom: To guard idly for the rabbit by the tree trunk)

37
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,000
But the longer we wait, the higher the chances that things could change.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,960
We deployed so many Drug Men this time.

39
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,160
What if one of those useless bastards

40
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,770
becomes uncontrollable and runs off?

41
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:18,680
Then, the consequences will be unimaginable.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:24,410
What if... Mo Huaiyang comes back with reinforcements?

43
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:34,350
If that's so,

44
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,020
we'll kill

45
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:41,900
anyone in our way.
(T/N: Literally means, "if a god or Buddha blocks us, we will kill it.")

46
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,940
Eat it.

47
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,780
Fool.

48
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,570
Is there nothing that you want to ask me?

49
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:23,260
I...

50
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,750
Of course, I must ask!

51
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,100
Gu Xiang, who are you exactly?

52
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,690
Why didn't you ask this question

53
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,770
in front of your junior master and senior brother?

54
00:04:51,910 --> 00:04:54,970
If I asked in front of them... then,

55
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,980
what would happen to you?

56
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:00,010
Do you care so much about me?

57
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:03,510
Obviously! I've already sworn an oath to Brother Wen!

58
00:05:06,350 --> 00:05:08,100
This Wen Kexing.

59
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,350
How could this Wen Kexing be the ruler of Ghost Valley?

60
00:05:11,350 --> 00:05:13,290
He was clearly...

61
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,220
on such good terms with Brother Zhou and Chengling.

62
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,930
Right. Isn't he the son of Great Warrior Zhen Ruyu?

63
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,970
A'Xiang, could there

64
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:29,850
be some misunderstanding in the midst of all of this?

65
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,920
Was Brother Wen

66
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:36,590
framed by someone, which made him have to do this?

67
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:38,760
Is that right?

68
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,940
What if it's true?

69
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,440
And what if it's not?

70
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:48,910
If it's a misunderstanding, then even if I had to give my life,

71
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:52,300
I would still give it up to cleanse you of unjust guilt.

72
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,650
Then, what if it was true?

73
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:05,300
What if I'm truly a little lonely ghost from Mount Qingya

74
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:08,160
who accidentally came into the mortal world,

75
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,190
met you,

76
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,240
and deceived you?

77
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,310
Eldest Brother Cao,

78
00:06:19,710 --> 00:06:21,860
would you kill me?

79
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:28,540
From where I grew up, if I didn't kill others, they'd kill me.

80
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:30,710
Even if it was only a 1% chance,

81
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,640
I'd rather kill incorrectly than spare them.

82
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:38,540
If it weren't like that, I wouldn't have lived till today.

83
00:06:43,970 --> 00:06:49,490
If... If you really are a spy for Ghost Valley

84
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,340
who deceived me on purpose to join Gentle Wind Sword Sect

85
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:57,680
and brought in allies to kill my sect brothers

86
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,730
to destroy my mountain,

87
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,580
I absolutely would kill you.

88
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:13,580
Okay.

89
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:27,850
But, A'Xiang, did you know?

90
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:30,070
I've sworn an oath.

91
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:34,290
I, Cao Weining, from birth to death,

92
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:37,230
will never do anything to fail you, even for a second.

93
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,690
But this matter...

94
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:45,300
I don't know whether it counts as failing you.

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,370
But don't worry, A'Xiang.

96
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,710
After I kill you, I won't live alone.

97
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:55,190
I will definitely cut my own throat to be with you.

98
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:58,890
We can walk the path to the netherworld together.

99
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,400
We will hold hands and enter our next life together.

100
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:06,670
A'Xiang, trust me.

101
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:10,900
The next life, I will definitely grow up with you.

102
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,440
I won't let you learn bad things

103
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,750
or suffer one bit!

104
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:22,240
But... But, A'Xiang, I don't think you are.

105
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,360
I know you're a wonderful girl!

106
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:27,770
So, A'Xiang, tell me.

107
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,510
What exactly is going on?

108
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,800
If I tell you,

109
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,590
will you believe me?

110
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:48,430
♫ How did our infatuation lead us astray? ♫

111
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:50,020
I trust you.

112
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:55,910
♫ You and I are destined for each other ♫

113
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,910
♫ Yet the martial world wouldn't let it last ♫

114
00:08:59,910 --> 00:09:03,280
A'Xiang. A'Xiang.

115
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,400
A'Xiang, don't cry.

116
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,490
I trust you. I told you that I would believe you. You just have to tell me!

117
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:11,330
A'Xiang, don't cry anymore.

118
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:15,490
I'll tell you. I'll tell it all.

119
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,860
Come here.

120
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,550
Sit. I'll tell you.

121
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,430
My Master, Wen Kexing, is truly the Chief of Ghost Valley.

122
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:25,610
But he had already decided to become a good person.

123
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:28,080
No. That's not right. He was a good person originally.

124
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,410
His main goal was just revenge. Moreover, he-he doesn't want the Glazed Armor

125
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:33,410
and he won't make himself an enemy to your Gentle Wind Sword Sect either!

126
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,010
A'Xiang. Talk slower, I don't understand.

127
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,350
Okay, then... then I'll start from the beginning

128
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:44,070
From... From when I grew up in the Ghost Valley.

129
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,620
From ever since I could remember—

130
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:51,310
Ever since I could remember, I was in the Ghost Valley.

131
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,600
At that time, even Master himself was just a young boy.

132
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,390
He served by the old Valley Chief's side.

133
00:09:57,390 --> 00:10:00,690
He said I was a baby he fished up from the river.

134
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:02,680
That's why he named me "Xiang".
(T/N: Xiangjiang is a river in the Hunan Province)

135
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,050
I believed it for so many years. Only after growing up did I realize

136
00:10:06,050 --> 00:10:09,650
the old Ghost Valley Leader had kidnapped a group of children to help him master demon arts.

137
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,990
All of the others died.

138
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,970
Only I remained. Because Master begged,

139
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:15,970
I was gifted to him as if I were an object.

140
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,610
That was how my small life was spared.

141
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:21,630
Children who grow up in Ghost Valley,

142
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,550
learn how to kill as soon as they learn how to walk.

143
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:26,750
Everyone assumed the rules of the world were that the strong lived while the weak died.

144
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:28,910
You die and I live.

145
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:31,100
But Master told me that it wasn't so.

146
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,120
There's a place outside called the mortal world.

147
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,080
I was only a small ghost that entered the dark world accidentally.

148
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,130
He said he would send me back one day.

149
00:10:39,130 --> 00:10:40,880
Once I grew up, I realized

150
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,770
Master protected me from many troubles.

151
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:49,120
Finally, one day, Master initiated a bloody rebellion throughout Ghost Valley.

152
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,900
He killed the old chief and replaced him.

153
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:56,090
In the following years, Master killed all the original Top Ten Evil Devils.

154
00:10:56,090 --> 00:11:00,730
They were all replaced by new people, and he received the nickname Lunatic Wen.

155
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,900
At the time, I didn't think anything of it.

156
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:07,050
With Master as Leader, I could do anything I wanted to in Ghost Valley. I was really happy.

157
00:11:07,050 --> 00:11:09,490
That was until one day, Master said

158
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:11,510
his plans are finally complete.

159
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,980
He was going to take me to the mortal world.

160
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:22,560
I order the three thousand ghosts of Mount Qingya

161
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,710
to gather and leave immediately

162
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:28,050
to rip apart the traitor!

163
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:32,230
Whichever one of you monsters and demons brings back the Glazed Armor for me

164
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:38,380
will be promoted to the Chief of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts!

165
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,760
So you all left the valley

166
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,770
to capture Hanging Ghost and take back the Glazed Armor!

167
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:45,810
So stupid! I have been telling you for so long.

168
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:49,440
That was only an excuse! Master was doing that for revenge.

169
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,750
Then after the Zhen couple died,

170
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,070
Brother Wen was captured by Ghost Valley?

171
00:11:55,070 --> 00:11:59,370
No wonder Brother Wen was so melancholy when he saw Great Warrior Shen Shen.

172
00:12:03,880 --> 00:12:06,600
But our poor A'Xiang.

173
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,090
That's not right.

174
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:15,590
You said the Ghost Valley killed his parents but raised Brother Wen by their side?

175
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:19,730
Didn't they fear that Brother Wen would take revenge after growing up?

176
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:23,870
People who enter the valley have to drink a medicine called Water of Oblivion.

177
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:27,360
Once you drink it, you will forget what you most care about.

178
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,560
The old evil ghosts from back then all thought Master had forgotten about his parents' tragic deaths.

179
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,100
Actually, Master was abnormally strong-willed

180
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:37,520
and buried all his hatred deep within his heart.

181
00:12:47,830 --> 00:12:49,720
Junior Master!

182
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:53,750
Junior Master! Junior Master, you're finally awake.

183
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:57,100
I was so scared when you remained unconscious these few days.

184
00:12:58,080 --> 00:13:00,950
Right! Junior Master, this is...

185
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:04,880
Sir Wen, I am Jing Beiyuan, the seventh of my line.

186
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:08,390
This is Great Shaman of Nanjiang.

187
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:12,040
Thank you two, friends, for coming all this way for my brother.

188
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,440
Allow me to thank you.

189
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,990
Sir Wen, don't be so polite.

190
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:19,160
I owe Zishu... my life.

191
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:22,790
Beiyuan, we can catch up slowly later on.

192
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:25,680
Sir Wen has been unconscious for many days, and we have lost the most crucial moments.

193
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:29,310
I'm afraid right now, Lord Zhou has already been brought to Jinzhou.

194
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:32,270
Our first priority is to save him first.

195
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:34,440
But the Window of Heaven's security is high.

196
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,250
With just us, I'm afraid we will not be capable of much.

197
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,790
For this trip from Nanjiang,

198
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,100
we only brought a few personal guards.

199
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,960
Far water cannot save near fires.
(T/N: Chinese saying meaning that problems at hand cannot be solved by distant solutions)

200
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,900
What happened to A'Xu?

201
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:50,960

[White Clothes]

204
00:14:32,230 --> 00:14:34,690
Sir Zhou, please.

205
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:46,720
I've already inhaled muscle relaxants. Is there a need for this?

206
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,680
Please forgive us.

207
00:14:56,230 --> 00:14:57,760
Let's go.

208
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,580
Your Highness.

209
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,760
I know.

210
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,410
Pengju, good work.

211
00:15:53,410 --> 00:15:55,120
Go and rest.

212
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,940
- Your Highness!
- Leave now.

213
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:00,970
Yes.

214
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,840
Let's go.

215
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,410
Zishu, aren't you going to come in and see me?

216
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,490
Quite an attitude.

217
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:39,650
You have to make me come welcome you personally?

218
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:50,100
Your Highness, my home has already been destroyed.

219
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:55,460
There is no need to keep past persons or swords, either.

220
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,780
Good sword.

221
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,650
It should return to its owner's side.

222
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:16,310
Come with me. I've prepared some good wine for you.

223
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,770
[White Clothes]

224
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:49,960
This is the wine from Qingluan Courtyard.

225
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:09,350
It's become viscous after so long.

226
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:11,980
There's not enough for two pots.

227
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:19,740
Didn't we make a promise at the time?

228
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,320
It would last for ten years.

229
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:25,570
After ten years, with the same people in the same yard,

230
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,880
we'd open this jar of wine and drink it.

231
00:18:31,170 --> 00:18:33,260
Same people...

232
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:36,480
Are there any of them now?

233
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:40,380
Yunxing has left for the border,

234
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:42,790
Qingluan committed suicide,

235
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,420
Lord Seventh was poisoned by you,

236
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:48,120
and Jiuxiao died in the battle at Lu City.

237
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,230
In that courtyard... only you and I remain.

238
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:03,230
Many times I have dreamt of the past,

239
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:07,200
and revisited that yard full of flowers.

240
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:11,690
Beiyuan plays his Guqin, Jiuxiao plays his flute,

241
00:19:11,690 --> 00:19:15,270
Yunxing wields his sword, and Qingluan sings songs.

242
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,800
When I look behind me,

243
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:23,440
you are standing by my side.

244
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,800
You are right.

245
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,540
Zishu.

246
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:36,290
Our old friends have fallen, and only the two of us remain.

247
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:38,690
For us,

248
00:19:38,690 --> 00:19:41,840
our bonds of favor and resentment can't be counted clearly.

249
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,220
I don't want to think about it anymore.

250
00:19:46,330 --> 00:19:48,700
Come back and help me.

251
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:52,590
Let's wipe the slate from past years clean, and start over.

252
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:54,140
Okay?

253
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:04,890
[Moral Purity]

254
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,740
Good wine.

255
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:42,830
Wine grows fine with time, as people grow closer.

256
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,090
I used to believe it was fine that you died.

257
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,360
If one wants to be king, he must walk a lonely path.

258
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:59,140
But ever since I found out you reappeared outside Yueyang City,

259
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,940
with your martial arts intact and living well,

260
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,710
I was clearly ecstatic at the time.

261
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,760
Come on. Tell me.

262
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,090
What did you do to the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns

263
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,890
so that you even managed to deceive Pengju?

264
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,930
There is nothing to be done to the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns.

265
00:21:20,930 --> 00:21:23,510
I just changed methods.

266
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:29,060
There are seven nails. Every three months, I would insert one

267
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:34,060
and allow it to gradually grow into my flesh, merging with my blood vessels.

268
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:38,780
This way, I can gradually get used to the excruciating pain of breaking tendons and veins.

269
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:41,280
Even if I finish with the last nail right now,

270
00:21:42,010 --> 00:21:45,410
I wouldn't become a piece of meat that can't move or talk.

271
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:48,910
My martial arts... would still remain to some degree.

272
00:21:51,430 --> 00:21:53,760
18 months.

273
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,800
You let yourself suffer such excruciating pain for 18 months.

274
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,700
Why? If you wanted to betray me,

275
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:09,600
you could've silently left my range of control.

276
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,200
Why? Why did you have to do this?

277
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:18,800
The Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns is a rule I placed.

278
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:22,600
The brothers that fought beside me also obeyed this rule!

279
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,600
If I made myself an exception,

280
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:28,000
how could I face anyone in the netherworld?

281
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:33,100
Jiuxiao's death was an accident.

282
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:35,600
Do you think I'm not sad?

283
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:39,000
What's the meaning of torturing yourself like this?

284
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,000
If Jiuxiao could see you from the heavens, he would be more distraught than I!

285
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:46,200
Jiuxiao's death was an accident.

286
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,000
Then, how about my 79 comrades in Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

287
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,900
Was all of that also just an accident?

288
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:54,800
A water-fetching jar eventually breaks on the well.

289
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,600
The general is fated to die on the front lines.

290
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:05,590
Swords do not have eyes. Living depends on your fate.

291
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,000
You've pushed the responsibility too cleanly away from yourself.

292
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,300
Zhou Zishu,

293
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:21,000
don't forget.

294
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,200
You're the one who came up with the name, Window of Heaven.

295
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:28,400
You wanted to shine a ray of light upon this dark world.

296
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:32,900
To pray for the world, to bring peace to everyone!

297
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:37,800
You don't understand why these people were sacrificed?

298
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:44,500
Now, I am about to burn down this rusted, chaotic world!

299
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,200
How can you be absent from it?

300
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,000
Then, what about Han Ying?

301
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,500
Han Ying?

302
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:54,600
I'm talking about people of the world! The righteous path in the world!

303
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,800
You talk to me about Han Ying?

304
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,800
What the hell is he?

305
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:02,900
A lowly, orphaned slave!

306
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:07,200
How dare he try to show off before me?

307
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:10,600
That's right. If it weren't for that idiotic bastard

308
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:15,100
who threw himself into my trap, I couldn't have found you so quickly.

309
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:18,600
You're actually questioning me over this person?

310
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,400
Hilarious.

311
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,900
Is he not part of this world? He was only 22 years old.

312
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,750
Zishu, you are too funny!

313
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:31,200
Absolutely hilarious!

314
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,800
It's been ten years. How many people have died

315
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:39,500
for your righetous path? Those who did and did not deserve death.

316
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:46,400
Your Highness, I am no longer a youth of 16.

317
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:51,200
I cannot see the peaceful and glorious world you speak of.

318
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,000
I only see a living human who has died because of me.

319
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Their resentment weighs down on my back every day and every night!

320
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:02,800
If there is no bloodshed, how can there be peace and glory?

321
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,600
They sacrificed their bodies for the greater good!

322
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,400
Did they die for the greater good

323
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,200
or did they die for your ambitions?

324
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
Such good wine,

325
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,700
but you ruined it.

326
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,870
Zishu...

327
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:38,600
Don't be so agitated.

328
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:42,000
You used muscle relaxants for so many days.

329
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:46,300
You could die if you use too much force.

330
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:52,000
You destroyed Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

331
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,200
I originally destroyed Four Seasons Mountain Villa

332
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:57,200
to give you a chance.

333
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,400
Your home is Jinzhou!

334
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,000
If you can't bear to make a decision, I will make one for you!

335
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,100
I originally thought

336
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,400
you could correct your mistake and return to my side.

337
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:16,300
Then I could forgive your past actions.

338
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,800
Hilarious.

339
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:28,300
I had always thought you were my soulmate.

340
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:36,400
It turns out that you're just a mediocre person.

341
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:40,000
My soulmate... Are you qualified?

342
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,600
What did you say?

343
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,200
Guards! Guards!

344
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,000
Your Highness! Zhou Zishu! You—

345
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,400
You traitor!

346
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,670
If you dare touch even one hair on me,

347
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,000
don't even think about leaving Jinzhou alive!

348
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,600
No one move!

349
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,600
Your Highness, since I dared to come,

350
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,300
I didn't think about leaving alive.

351
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:32,600
You did something to the muscle relaxants.

352
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,800
Very good.

353
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:38,200
You still have other spies within Window of Heaven!

354
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:40,550
Your Highness,

355
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,500
you are wrong.

356
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:46,800
Listen to my order!

357
00:27:46,800 --> 00:27:50,600
Today, if I lose my life here,

358
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,900
I want everyone in Window of Heaven to be buried alongside me!

359
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,600
Yes, Sir!

360
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:01,300
Your Highness, after all these years,

361
00:28:01,300 --> 00:28:03,800
you didn't change at all.

362
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:06,400
The only reason why I allowed Duan Pengju so much authority

363
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:09,700
was because I hoped he could take control of everything smoothly.

364
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,600
If Window of Heaven still has my subordinates,

365
00:28:13,450 --> 00:28:16,130
how could I just leave like that?

366
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:19,200
Didn't I tell you before?

367
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,600
I just changed how I inserted the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns.

368
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:27,000
I slowed its progression, but I cannot change the result.

369
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,000
I've lost my sense of taste and smell.

370
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:34,000
No sort of inhalant has any effect on me.

371
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,000
Ridiculous.

372
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:42,700
You were just betting that I wouldn't kill you.

373
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:47,100
You would, but you would meet me first.

374
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:52,400
As long as you were willing to see me, and we were in the same room,

375
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:55,600
there would be thousands of ways to kill you.

376
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:05,500
I think...

377
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:11,200
Your Highness has forgotten what Master once said.

378
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:15,600
The emperor's fury results in a sea of blood.

379
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,600
A commoner's fury will only result in the death of one person,

380
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:21,100
yet the whole world will mourn.

381
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,800
Me?

382
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,200
I didn't care that you were the son of a traitor

383
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:30,100
and trusted you wholeheartedly with my life!

384
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:33,000
After Jiuxiao died, you grew more and more dejected.

385
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:37,200
In the end, you left me and I even forgave that!

386
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:41,200
Even... Even after finding out you lied and betrayed me,

387
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,200
I still wasn't willing to hurt your life.

388
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,200
Where's your conscience? Was it eaten by a dog?

389
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:51,900
Your Highness, the entanglements between us

390
00:29:51,900 --> 00:29:56,400
can't be counted clearly. You tricked me, used me,

391
00:29:56,400 --> 00:30:01,200
and tried to kill me. I don't care anymore.

392
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,600
But I have already become the sinner of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

393
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,420
I refuse to be the sinner of the world!

394
00:30:06,420 --> 00:30:10,800
[Moral Purity]

395
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,600
Very funny.

396
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:16,200
It seems like we met for nothing.

397
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:20,600
Zhou Zishu, since when were you a Bodhisattva?

398
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:23,000
- In the past, you—
- Enough!

399
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:30,400
Kill me! Kill me...

400
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,600
and there will still be a successor to fulfill my wishes!

401
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,400
Your Highness!

402
00:31:07,890 --> 00:31:09,660
Your Highness!

403
00:31:09,660 --> 00:31:11,420
No...

404
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:18,290
Your Highness!

405
00:31:18,290 --> 00:31:20,330
No...

406
00:31:20,330 --> 00:31:24,590
Don't-Don't kill him...

407
00:31:24,590 --> 00:31:26,690
- Your Highness!
- Your Highness!

408
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:45,050
What's that noise? Hurry!

409
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:57,270
Eldest Brother Cao...

410
00:31:57,870 --> 00:32:01,520
A'Xiang, you're not afraid?

411
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,140
Why would I be afraid?

412
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:08,820
Don't be angry with me, but when we were fleeing up the mountain,

413
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,760
I was pretty happy.

414
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:14,410
I was thinking, if we both die here,

415
00:32:14,410 --> 00:32:17,070
you would never know.

416
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:26,250
Am I hallucinating?

417
00:32:26,250 --> 00:32:29,000
Why do I smell grilled meat?

418
00:32:31,270 --> 00:32:33,450
I smell it, too.

419
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:47,460
The wind direction isn't quite right.

420
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:49,240
You all!

421
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:51,760
Bring me some large cattail leaf fans

422
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,390
and disperse the smell!

423
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:55,550
Yes!

424
00:32:55,550 --> 00:32:57,760
You bastards.

425
00:32:57,760 --> 00:33:00,190
The hunger in your stomachs

426
00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:03,130
should be burning uncontrollably right now.

427
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,640
Scorpion King, bad news!

428
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,160
Mo Huaiyang is back!

429
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:13,330
He also brought someone!

430
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:17,060
Did Mo Huaiyang bring the Emperor in Heaven or your father?

431
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:19,390
What could be bad enough to make you into such a coward?

432
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:21,020
Useless.

433
00:33:31,260 --> 00:33:34,040
Where are my disciples?

434
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:43,890
Father.

435
00:33:43,890 --> 00:33:45,790
Evil creature!

436
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:55,220
Traitorous son, answer Sect Leader Mo.

437
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,220
Are you all deaf?

438
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,510
Answer Sect Leader Mo!

439
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,460
Open the door! I am back!

440
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:28,020
Brother Zhao, take a look.

441
00:34:28,890 --> 00:34:31,060
Look at this.

442
00:34:32,730 --> 00:34:37,200
Him! Your adopted son sure is capable.

443
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,760
With just his own power,

444
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,850
he almost made my Gentle Wind Sword Sect

445
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:45,090
disappear from the martial arts world!

446
00:34:45,090 --> 00:34:47,480
Don't worry, Brother Mo.

447
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:52,060
I will definitely make it up to you.

448
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,750
"If My Lord does not betray me,

449
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,830
I will not betray My Lord."

450
00:35:05,830 --> 00:35:11,090
Today, I finally understand.

451
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:14,170
My Lord!

452
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,080
Grant forgiveness.

453
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:24,030
This is our sect's pure and quiet area.

454
00:35:24,030 --> 00:35:27,930
It's not too late to figure out your family's personal business after going home.

455
00:35:27,930 --> 00:35:31,830
Can you let your son remove the people outside immediately?

456
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:34,700
Did you hear Sect Leader Mo's words?

457
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,150
Tell your disgusting monsters

458
00:35:37,150 --> 00:35:39,590
to disappear immediately!

459
00:35:39,590 --> 00:35:42,380
And then I'll get even with you.

460
00:35:43,710 --> 00:35:46,170
Traitorous son! Barbarian!

461
00:35:46,170 --> 00:35:48,090
Get lost!

462
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:04,060
Eldest Brother Cao.

463
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:07,060
Come here.

464
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,320
Please be appeased, Brother Mo.

465
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,980
I, Zhao Jing, swear upon the heavens

466
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,980
that I had no knowledge of this event.

467
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:22,760
And I ordered my son to stay far away from your sect.

468
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:25,810
I am to blame for not telling him we are allies now.

469
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:28,710
That's because I didn't want to create more trouble.

470
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,810
But don't worry. Once things are done,

471
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,660
I will have him beg for forgiveness.

472
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:36,890
That won't be necessary.

473
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:44,110
If the lives of more than twenty Gentle Wind Sword Sect disciples

474
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:46,860
were only worth a few whippings,

475
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:50,240
isn't that too disappointing?

476
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:52,370
Brother Mo, you are right.

477
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:54,730
I didn't teach my son correctly.

478
00:36:54,730 --> 00:36:57,760
I really have no shame standing here.

479
00:37:13,790 --> 00:37:17,530
I... am willing to bring out these three pieces of Glazed Armor

480
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:21,160
while risking losing all of my fame and status.

481
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:25,300
Let's speak clearly.

482
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:29,350
If you really value the agreement between us,

483
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,860
you should know what to do.

484
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:38,110
I understand what you mean.

485
00:37:38,110 --> 00:37:42,190
But, Brother Mo, this son is very important to me.

486
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:45,870
I have many places where I need him.

487
00:37:45,870 --> 00:37:50,770
How about this? I have always kept my promises.

488
00:37:50,770 --> 00:37:52,650
I will pay you back double.

489
00:37:52,650 --> 00:37:55,820
I will give you a satisfactory explanation.

490
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:58,120
What happened today was all because of your son!

491
00:37:58,120 --> 00:38:01,130
In front of all my sect members, I

492
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:04,140
stood on the same side as you, Scorpion King, and Ghost Valley!

493
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:08,030
How can I teach my disciples from now on?

494
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,570
I understand.

495
00:38:26,530 --> 00:38:28,800
Once everything's over,

496
00:38:32,910 --> 00:38:35,460
I will personally bring

497
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,680
my son's head to you.

498
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:04,640
Traitor! What did you do to Your Highness?

499
00:39:06,230 --> 00:39:08,490
Zhou Zishu!

500
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:13,260
The Prince valued you so much

501
00:39:13,260 --> 00:39:16,700
and still isn't willing to hurt your life.

502
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:19,790
Yet you pay his kindness back with hatred?

503
00:39:19,790 --> 00:39:22,440
The prince's internal wounds

504
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:25,020
are my sect's unique, secret arts.

505
00:39:25,020 --> 00:39:27,260
Freezing Aroma Palm.

506
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:31,530
After you are hit, your heart meridians are seriously damaged.

507
00:39:31,530 --> 00:39:35,030
You remain sickly for the rest of your life.

508
00:39:35,030 --> 00:39:38,030
Only my sect's martial arts can treat it.

509
00:39:38,030 --> 00:39:43,470
But these martial arts... only have one successor in this world.

510
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:45,040
Guess who it is?

511
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,030
Stop talking nonsense.

512
00:39:47,030 --> 00:39:50,270
Under what terms will you heal the prince's injuries?

513
00:39:50,270 --> 00:39:52,060
Say it!

514
00:39:56,660 --> 00:40:00,830
Pengju, you can't possibly believe

515
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:02,950
that I only hit him once

516
00:40:02,950 --> 00:40:06,940
because I was soft-hearted right at that moment?

517
00:40:08,150 --> 00:40:11,120
You followed me for so many years,

518
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:14,310
but you still don't know anything about me.

519
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,390
You sadden me greatly.

520
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:27,890
Zhou Zishu!

521
00:40:27,890 --> 00:40:31,770
Don't think that even though the prince is like this, he won't kill you!

522
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:36,200
If you aren't willing to heal him, there's plenty of miracle healers in the world!

523
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,170
Even if I risk my life for going against my ruler's wishes,

524
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:43,170
this time I will have the prince

525
00:40:43,170 --> 00:40:45,490
cut you into thousands of pieces

526
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,800
and give you death of agony!

527
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:51,760
Pengju, you are really scaring me like this.

528
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:55,470
Kill me. Killing me

529
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:58,340
would be like killing the prince.

530
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:02,380
Worst comes to worst, I'll go on my way first

531
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:04,710
and wait for him in the netherworld.

532
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:06,680
You—

533
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,560
Shameless!

534
00:41:11,090 --> 00:41:15,150
You can't possibly think I commanded Window of Heaven

535
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,500
by relying on my integrity to win others over, did you?

536
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,290
Okay.

537
00:41:24,890 --> 00:41:26,620
Okay!

538
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,300
Lord Zhou, then we'll wait it out!

539
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:33,430
Let's see who can last longer!

540
00:41:34,530 --> 00:41:38,660
All right, we'll wait then.

541
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:42,550
I... don't have long to live anyway.

542
00:41:42,550 --> 00:41:46,460
I'm not losing anything.

543
00:42:38,330 --> 00:42:44,690
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

544
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:52,400
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

545
00:42:53,070 --> 00:43:00,170
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

546
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:07,750
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

547
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:15,780
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

548
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:23,320
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

549
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:27,190
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

550
00:43:27,190 --> 00:43:30,690
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

551
00:43:30,690 --> 00:43:38,570
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

552
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:42,090
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

553
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:45,760
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

554
00:43:45,760 --> 00:43:53,830
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

555
00:43:53,830 --> 00:43:57,290
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

556
00:43:57,290 --> 00:44:01,040
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

557
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:08,010
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

558
00:44:08,010 --> 00:44:16,240
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
