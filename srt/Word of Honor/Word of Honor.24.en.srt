[Four Seasons Mountain Villa]

24
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:02,390
Our mountain villa has splendid views throughout all four seasons of the year.

25
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:04,560
Each view is outstanding.

26
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,250
In spring, the Indian azaleas bloom like a sea of flowers.

27
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,310
In summer, the phoenix blossoms bloom.

28
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,380
In autumn, the orange osmanthus fragrance is spread.

29
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,330
In winter, you will find plums in the snow.

30
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:32,630
Four Seasons Mountain Villa is full of exotic flowers and plants.

31
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,940
It truly soothes the heart.

32
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,620
A bunny!

33
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,630
If you call me "Nice Uncle Wen" three times, I will catch the bunny for you to play with.

34
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,870
Could I call you "Nice Junior Master Wen"?

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,830
You two, stop being naughty.

36
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:58,290
The majority of the rabbits living in the mountain are the offspring

37
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,970
of the brood that your grandmaster's wife raised.

38
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,460
For her sake,

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:04,140
spare her rabbits' grandsons.

40
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,930
Grandmaster's wife was like my mother.

41
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:07,910
Both of them liked to raise little animals.

42
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:09,360
Yes.

43
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,570
Your grandmaster's wife and Elder Sister Bi were the kindest people.

44
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,450
If there were any injured animals in the mountains,

45
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,470
they would heal their wounds and release them into the mountains.

46
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,660
If anyone dared to hunt and eat it,

47
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:23,610
and got found out by your grandmaster's wife, that would be terrible.

48
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,840
One time, Master and Uncle Zhang made a bet.

49
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,990
They caught a deer to eat with their wine.

50
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:31,480
I couldn't bear it, so I told your grandmaster's wife.

51
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:36,360
She followed your grandmaster all across the mountainside, beating him up.

52
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,630
My father was the same way. In front of others, he was mighty and prestigious,

53
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:42,720
but in private, my mother would chase him and beat him often as well.

54
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,610
We are almost there. Let's go.

55

Let's go.

00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:03,360
Look. That cliff stone was carved

57

In the past... it wasn't like this.

65
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:35,030
The courtyard must have been uninhabited for too long,

66
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:37,120
so it's become desolate.

67

It's okay.

It will be fine after some cleaning.

Of course! It will be fine after some cleaning.

But how come ever since I confessed my love to her,

117
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:25,180
she's never given me a pleasant expression again?

118

Zhu Yaozhi, I know you were tricked by Gao Chong.

But considering the fact that you respect your elders, I won't hold that grudge against you.

124
00:09:55,950 --> 00:09:59,050
If you remain blinded and continue to defend your monster of a master,

00:09:59,050 --> 00:10:00,940
I'll assume you've fallen to evil.

126
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,620
My master wasn't a devil!

127
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,080
He's been framed!

128
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,920
How could he ally with Ghost Valley?

129
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,810
How dare you object when the evidence is clear as day!

130
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,130
During the Heroes Conference, someone saw

132

He also took the Zhang orphan with him!

133
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,480
Nonsense!

134
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:21,360
Master Wen saved Chengling!

135
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,930
He saved Chengling and escorted him all the way to Lake Tai.

136
00:10:24,930 --> 00:10:26,720
He's not even thirty years old.

137
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,770
How could he be the Ghost Valley leader?

138
00:10:29,770 --> 00:10:33,060
He's knowledgeable in evil arts, of course he could look young.

139
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:35,030
How is that odd?

140
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:38,080
Wen Kexing was the one who led the massacre of the Mirror Lake Sword Sect.

141
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:41,140
He then used his identity as a savior to mix with Five Lakes Alliance.

142
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,990
How arrogant!

143
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,580
Gao Chong and that devil Wen worked together to hide it from everyone.

144
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,730
They thought they could trick everyone,

145
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:51,580
but could they trick us forever?

146
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:54,400
Alliance Leader Zhao has already ordered people to draw portraits

of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts under Wen Kexing

148
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:59,010
and announce them to the martial arts world!

149
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:01,650
Master's identity has been exposed?

150
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:07,760
Zhu Yaozhi, in consideration of your age and inexperience,

151
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,640
as long as you say that Gao Chong is a wicked, treacherous devil who deceived the world,

152
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,830
you will still be a good friend of the Five Lake Alliance.

153
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:16,310
If you still defend that devil, then even if I kill you,

154
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:18,680
Alliance Leader Zhao wouldn't blame me for it.

155
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,110
You won't have your way!

156
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:24,780
Say it! Gao Chong is a wicked, treacherous devil who deceived the world.

157
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:28,340
He will never be forgiven and will be no better than swine in his next life.

158
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:33,000
If you continue insulting my master, I'll fight to the death against you!

159
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,200
I'll kill you, you son of a devil!

160

Who dares to hurt my nephew disciple!

My god, this idiot has finally done something useful.

[Sincerity in work brings riches]

167
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,910
A'Xiang! You're back?

168
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:24,840
Why are you still standing here like an idiot?

169
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,900
I was waiting for you. I was worried you wouldn't see me when you came back

170
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,790
and that you'd get worried.

171
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:34,240
Let's go, let's go. Let's not linger here in this town.

172
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,910
We... aren't going to eat?

173
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:43,920
Let's travel first, all right?

174
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,650
Once we're back to Gentle Wind Sword Sect, I'll personally cook for you

175
00:12:46,660 --> 00:12:48,060
and feed you to death, silly!

176
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:50,030
All right. All right.

Cao Weining!

178
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:01,090
Do you truly want to marry me?

179
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:02,290
No doubt about it!

180
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,820
A'Xiang, why are you still asking that question?

181
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,520
I've already sworn it to Brother Wen.

182
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,230
Well, what if your master doesn't like me?

183
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:11,170
He won't! He will definitely like you!

184
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,990
You're so wonderful.

185
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:19,270
What if... he looks down on me

186
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:25,790
because I'm a wild girl with no parents?

187
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:30,110
He won't. Junior Master Fan is the most soft-hearted.

188
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:34,170
If Master doesn't agree, I'll go beg Junior Master Fan.

I'm not talking about that!

190

Cao Weining, if both your master and junior master don't let you marry me, what are you going to do?

00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:42,360
Then you can kidnap me, and we'll elope!

Who wants to kidnap you?

193

Even if you offered, I still wouldn't care for it.

194
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:55,840
I meant the opposite! I'll kidnap you! I'll abduct you!

A-Any way works.

I want to be with you no matter what.

197

A'Xiang,

198
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,010
if I can't be with you this life,

199
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:15,530
then I won't be happy no matter what.

200
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,790
Even if the sky falls down, I won't be stopped.

201
00:14:18,790 --> 00:14:21,840
Besides, they wouldn't stop me anyway.

202
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:25,330
Junior Master Fan will definitely like you.

203

But... But...

There's no time more precious

208
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:57,210
than the time spent with the person you love.

209

Every passing day counts.

210

Every extra day is a treasure.

Nothing else is worth paying attention to.

212
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,580
Uncle Wen, what's in here?

213
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,990
Why is it so heavy?

214
00:15:28,990 --> 00:15:31,540
It's wine for your master. Give it to me!

215
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:34,260
No need, Uncle Wen. I'll treat it like practicing my martial arts.

216
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,650
Uncle Wen, Master said Four Seasons Mountain Villa went from ninety-nine to one.

217
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:51,830
Everyone died due to him.

218
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,650
Didn't I already tell you to stop asking?

219
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,160
Aren't I asking you?

220
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,360
Uncle Wen, hurry and make things clear to me.

221
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,510
Seeing Master so sad upsets me.

222
00:16:02,510 --> 00:16:04,330
No matter what happened in this time,

223
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:08,010
this is his personal business and his own major sorrow.

224
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:10,240
If he's not ready to tell us,

225
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,870
or if he doesn't want to bring it up ever again,

226
00:16:12,870 --> 00:16:15,210
I hope you don't force him to tell us.

227
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,140
I understand.

228
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:19,780
Uncle Wen, you're very compatible with Master.

229
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,430
He's also told me the same thing before.

230
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:24,230
He said that poking at someone else's scars is not what a righteous person would do.

231
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:26,200
He told to me never—

their situation.

234

I didn't say it on purpose. Junior Master, don't take it to heart.

235
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:44,750
What did you call me?

236
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,070
I'm supposed to call you Junior Master anyways.

237
00:16:48,070 --> 00:16:50,520
Why can't we be straightforward about it?

238
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,100
Why do we have to be so subtle?

239
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,570
Master already said before. Even if you don't think of him that way, he still considers you to be his junior brother.

240
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:58,330
But he's also told me

241
00:16:58,330 --> 00:17:02,590
to wait until you've made up your mind and are ready to come back to our sect before calling you that.

242
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:04,300
It absolutely cannot be forced.

243
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:09,350

That old freak does things without explanation.

You're the one without a conscience!

They all say those with a thin upper lip are cold and unemotional.

298
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,600
From what I see, that's extremely accurate.

299

They say that

how can the matters of the court be spoken of as simply as good or bad?

323
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:51,000
His Highness wants him dead, so he must die. There's no other way.

324
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,200
There doesn't have to be a reason.

325
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:55,800
The three of us are all indebted to Officer Jiang.

326
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:59,400
We don't understand the matters of the court and we aren't cut out to understand,

327
00:23:59,400 --> 00:24:02,400
but the people of the martial arts world understand that kindness must be paid back.

328
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,300
After we bid farewell to you, we'll chase after Officer Jiang

329
00:24:05,300 --> 00:24:07,400
and protect him to the Northwest.

330
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,800
If Duan Pengju still wants to hurt Officer Jiang,

331
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:13,000
he'll have to step over our dead bodies!

332
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,800
Your actions are futile.
(T/N: Literally, "you're trying to break a rock by using an egg")

333
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,400
Even if it's futile, we're still going to try!

334
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,800
I, Luo Hao,

335
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:24,200
would rather die to pay back his kindness than live pitifully!

336
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,560
Senior Brother!

337
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Fine. I'll go with you.

338
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,800
All of you, get up!

339
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:06,400
Drink this for courage, and we'll chase after Officer Jiang together!

340
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,600
All right!

341
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,600
My Lord, you're finally back!

342
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,400
At the time, he wanted to risk his life to rescue,

343
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,800
so I made him drink

344
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,400
wine mixed with Drunk Life Dream Death.

345
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:46,060
He slept in a coma for five days and five nights.

346
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:48,800
When he woke,

347
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:51,400
everything was already decided.

348
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,100
He hated me deeply and left without notice.

349
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:00,420
When I last saw him,

350
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,800
he was laying in a coffin.

351
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,500
He mistakenly thought I was trapped within a lonely city,

352
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,200
and risked his life to come and rescue me.

353
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,800
He ended up dying in a battle below the city walls.

354
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:18,000
His lover went through so much difficulty

355
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:21,800
to deliver his corpse to me.

356
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:24,200
At the time, I didn't know that girl's relationship

357
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,600
with Jiuxiao.

358
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:30,200
But once I found out,

359
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,400
I had already forced her

360
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:36,700
to drink a poison that sealed her throat with blood.

361
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,200
If there's a parallel world,

362
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:48,800
they must all be together, cursing their evil senior brother.

363
00:26:48,800 --> 00:26:51,400
They wouldn't curse you.

364
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,900
They...

365
00:26:54,150 --> 00:26:56,230
They would naturally understand you.

366
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,700
You're wrong.

367
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,200
The only reason why they ended up in misfortune

368
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,800
was because they never truly understood their senior brother.

369
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:12,600
Jiuxiao worshiped me ever since he was young.

370
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,200
Master...

371
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:18,400
also treated me as he would a biological son.

372
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:22,000
Everyone within the villa, young and old,

373
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:24,200
treated me like family;

374
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:29,200
a senior brother. They respected and loved me.

375
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:32,000
As a result they were blinded

376
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:34,200
and never knew

377
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,800
that the real Zhou Zishu

378
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:41,200
was actually a coward, a deserter.

379
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,800
A'Xu...

380
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,100
Sit down first.

381
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
Master died of illness.

382
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:31,200
Before he passed away,

383
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,900
he entrusted me with Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

384
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:37,200
A youthful lord,

385
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,800
young and easy to bully.

386
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:42,600
Countless people from good and bad sects

387
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:45,800
came to cause trouble.

388
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:48,200
I held out for two years.

389
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,100
I watched as my junior masters

390
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:55,400
passed away one after another to protect the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

391
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,620
I couldn't hold on anymore,

392
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,600
so I ran away.

393
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,800
Don't blame yourself like that.

394
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,800
What happened after that?

395
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:11,600
I really ran!

396
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,300
You wouldn't!

397
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,880
You must have had your own difficulties.

398
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,700
Difficulties?

399
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,700
They were just some pretty-sounding excuses, that's all.

400
00:29:25,570 --> 00:29:27,060
My father...

401
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:31,200
was deceased Prince Jin's closest supporter.

402
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:35,700
The current Prince Jin is my cousin.

403
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:40,000
He was worried that he didn't have anyone to trust by his side,

404
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:43,000
so he wrote a letter begging me for help.

405
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:50,810
Eldest Prince.

406
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,800
What are you saying? Call me Cousin.

407
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,600
Cousin, what's wrong?

408
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,800
Your complexion looks terrible.

409
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Your Highness, is your father doing well?

410
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:10,300
It's Master. He's passed away.

411
00:30:12,230 --> 00:30:14,370
Master was still young.

412
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:16,260
How did he—

413
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,410
Royal Father believed in rumors

414
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,600
and tortured Master in the dungeons for an answer.

415
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:26,070
The rumors weren't even true.

416
00:30:26,070 --> 00:30:28,860
How would Master submit to that?

417
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,600
He committed suicide in the dungeons.

418
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:38,510
Do you know what Master did before he died?

419
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,360
He covered the ground and wall with poems of death.

420
00:30:43,430 --> 00:30:46,650
"Slowly do the rivers flow,

421
00:30:46,650 --> 00:30:49,820
the Window of Heaven brings enlightenment."

422
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:53,140
"Evil whispers destroy justice,

423
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:57,160
Floating clouds block the sun."

424
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:01,550
I looked at the bloody poems covering the ground and wall.

425
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,620
What sort of world is this?

426
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:11,200
Master was noble and honorable his whole life

427
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,370
for the nation and its people.

428
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:16,340
Cousin, don't be too sad.

429
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:17,490
In the future, we—

430
00:31:17,490 --> 00:31:21,540
Royal Father... Royal Father was furious.

431
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:25,100
He even threw Master's body into the wild

432
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:29,380
and sent soldiers to guard it against attempts to take it back.

433
00:31:29,380 --> 00:31:32,740
He let the wild dogs feast on it.

434
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:38,640
I'm the useless one. I'm the useless one!

435
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,540
I...

436
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:45,270
I couldn't even grant Master peace after death.

437
00:31:45,270 --> 00:31:47,750
Cousin, don't worry.

438
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:49,670
I'll go steal Master's body back.

439
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:52,060
I'll bury him properly.

440
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:55,570
Good, Zishu.

441
00:31:55,570 --> 00:32:00,120
If only you can find a time to leave the mountain and help me.

442
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:11,140
So I brought all the brothers in the Four Seasons Mountain Villa

443
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:13,750
to support Prince Jin.

444
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:17,700
Who would've thought

445
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,470
I was only lying to myself?

446
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:26,220
Once you enter the political swamp,

447
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:29,420
there's no easy way out.

448
00:32:31,900 --> 00:32:34,830
I could only watch as my brothers

449
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:39,110
died in front of me, one after another.

450
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,030
In the end,

451
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:45,770
even Jiuxiao died.

452
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:52,110
After Jiuxiao's death,

453
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,640
I had nothing to live for.

454
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,720
Afterward,

455
00:32:59,930 --> 00:33:02,270
guess what happened?

456
00:33:02,270 --> 00:33:04,810
I ran away again!

457
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,290
In the end,

458
00:33:14,820 --> 00:33:17,970
I'm only left with some nails.

459
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:21,520
The people I wanted to protect,

460
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:24,920
the things I wanted to achieve,

461
00:33:27,830 --> 00:33:30,990
were like sand in my palm.

462
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,340
The harder I grasped,

463
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,880
the more it flowed away.

464
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:48,030
The only good thing is,

465
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,860
the heavens took pity

466
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,010
and gave me a chance to turn things around.

467
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,700
I can pass down my abilities.

468
00:33:58,350 --> 00:34:00,680
I just don't know...

469
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:04,730
whether I can see this child

470
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:06,720
grow up into a man.

471
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:09,850
Why can't you? Ye Baiyi promised me.

472
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:12,790
That old freak has seen many things. If he said you can be healed,

473
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:14,980
then you can!

474
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,080
Not all things in the world

475
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:20,790
can be solved absolutely.

476
00:34:20,790 --> 00:34:25,160
I don't care. This thing must be.

477
00:34:25,160 --> 00:34:27,720
No matter what the ending is,

478
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:30,330
I want to tell you

479
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:33,800
that I am truly happy

480
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,390
that you could come back with me, Junior Brother.

481
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:46,570
The sun's almost up. Hurry and rest.

482
00:34:47,480 --> 00:34:49,730
I'll go out to get some fresh air.

483
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,230
Old Wen,

484
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:00,970
even though you were accepted as a disciple by Master,

485
00:35:00,970 --> 00:35:03,620
you did not actually grow up as one.

486
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:07,490
You don't want to accept Four Seasons Mountain Villa as your sect,

487
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,790
so I can't force you.

488
00:35:10,280 --> 00:35:12,490
The child of the Wen family

489
00:35:12,490 --> 00:35:15,280
has returned to Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

490
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:19,150
If Master got this news in the underworld,

491
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:23,450
I'm sure he would be incredibly happy.

493
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:01,060
Master, you're awake?

494
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:03,540
Did I wake you when I was sweeping?

495
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:07,830
It's no problem. What time is it?

496
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,660
Why did I sleep so deeply?

497
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:12,780
It's almost noon. Uncle Wen said you didn't sleep well last night,

498
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:16,140
and he told me not to wake you and to let you sleep some more.

499
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:19,220
Where is he?

500
00:37:34,840 --> 00:37:36,600
Junior Master!

501
00:37:41,030 --> 00:37:43,490
A'Xu, you're awake.

502
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:49,600
I took a careful look, and this drawing isn't seriously damaged.

503
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,430
We just need to reattach it and it will be good.

504
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:55,330
I'm almost done mending the drawing. All that's left is filling in color.

505
00:37:55,330 --> 00:37:58,830
At least once we reattach it, the drawing won't curl anymore.

506
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:01,920
When I go down the mountain, I'll go find a highly skilled artist

507
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,890
to fill in the rest with your Master's strokes.

508
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:06,990
It will be the same as the original.

The pigeons from our bank are well trained.

They'll arrive with the letter at Kunzhou in less than two days.

That Wen Devil looks the same age as us.

How did he become the Chief of Ghost Valley?

520
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:54,730
You guys don't know now, do you?

521
00:38:54,730 --> 00:38:57,880
That Ghost Valley has a bunch of demon tricks that can maintain youthful visages.

522
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:01,150
That Wen Kexing only looks young in the portrait.

523
00:39:01,150 --> 00:39:03,860
Who knows? He might be an old man of 70.

524
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:07,060
- Right.
- He's relying on trickery to maintain his youthful look.

Who is the Chief of Ghost Valley you were talking about earlier?

Where did you come from, bastard? Don't you know how to ask politely?

527

You can't just come up and ask like that! Don't you understand etiquette?

Who are you to that Devil Wen?

Who let you spread rumors here?

We aren't lying! The Five Lake Alliance already sent all of the sects
