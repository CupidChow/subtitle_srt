24
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:56,780
What's wrong? Can't sleep well?

25
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,440
I had a nightmare and couldn't fall asleep again.

26
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,680
I figured I might as well get some fresh air.

27
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:09,460
It's raining. No wonder it felt cold in my dream.

28
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:16,760
That's right. After the frost comes, it'll be winter. After the eighth, it'll be a new year.

29
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:22,990
A'Xu, it would be nice if we could live at Four Seasons Mountain Villa like this for the rest of our lives.

30
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,630
Why can't we?

31
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:36,360
Let me. You don't know where the coal is.

32
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,360
Since neither of us can sleep, why don't we drink some?

33
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:46,440
Let's drink!

34
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,030
Wait a moment!

35
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:18,420
So mysterious.

36
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:31,390
You don't understand, do you? This goes best with wine.

37
00:04:33,990 --> 00:04:37,350
You eat. I'm fine with just wine.

38
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:39,320
It's bad for your health to drink on an empty stomach.

39
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,490
This single container has six types of dried fruit,

00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,020
all have their own beneficial effects that improve health.

41
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:48,080
This is Wo Long's most popular specialty, popular on both sides of the Yangtze River.

42
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,580
You should eat more each day.

43
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:55,440
Old Wen, I think the martial arts world has held you back.

44
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,060
With your eloquence, you would've been rich in no time with a simple cart and goods.

45
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:03,090
Here, try it!

46
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,910
I really won't eat them.

47
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,300
A'Xu, shame on you.

48
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:12,260
At this old age, you are still picky with your food and stay up too late.

49
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,310
How can you be a role model for your disciple?

50
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:16,160
Do I want to sleep late?

51
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,320
Why don't you try having some large nails in your chest?

52
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:21,510
Didn't you sleep all right in these past few days?

53
00:05:21,510 --> 00:05:27,350
That's because I found the Drunk Life Dream Death originally in the villa.

54
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:35,130
I recall that night, after you went under the influence of Drunk Life Dream Death,

55
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:38,470
you called out "Zhou Zishu" for the first time.

56
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,770
Now, can you tell me what you saw at the time?

57
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,890
I dreamed that I was still seven years old.

58
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:02,710
My family of three came to Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

59
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:06,590
My parents opened a small clinic at the foot of the mountain.

60
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,000
In the morning, I would learn and practice martial arts from Master,

61
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,320
and in the evening, I could go home for some warm food.

62
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:18,270
Those Drug Men were just a bunch of wild dogs in my dream.

63
00:06:18,270 --> 00:06:22,000
They would chase me rabidly and bite me for no reason.

64
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,320
You were sometimes Zhou Zishu and sometimes Zhen One Pot,

65
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:29,250
blocking them and protecting me.

66
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,740
"Zhen One Pot"?

67
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:32,540
You forgot?

68
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:35,020
That little wild dog that always followed you.

69
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:36,910
What is its name?

70
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:38,820
Its name is One Pot.

71
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,180
"One Pot"?

72
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,780
Wait for me!

73
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,150
Let me see!

74
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,060
I kept it with me. Didn't Great Warrior Qin say he was going to cook it into a pot of delicious meat?

75
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:08,800
That's why my parents decided to name it this.

76
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:12,590
I know. You have a deep connection with Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

77
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,750
but I never thought...

78
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:20,590
Four Seasons Mountain Villa has disappeared for a long time. When I saw someone who was able to use the Passing Clouds Steps,

79
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:24,690
I treated it as a hint and followed you to take a look.

80
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,120
Until you pulled out the White Clothes Sword, I was unable to confirm.

81
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:38,810
Finally, you said your surname was Zhou.

82
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,640
I guessed...

83
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,860
"While holding your hand, I enjoy the passing clouds."
(T/N: He is reciting an adaptation of an ancient poem that has Zhou Zishu's name is inside of it)

84
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,940
Isn't it a great name?

85
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:57,540
Then, Old Wen, the name Wen Kexing...

86
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,870
My father's surname was originally Wen.

87
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,270
It's just that he's an orphan, and he changed his surname after following the old Chief of Miracle Healer Valley.

88
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:12,170
Since the old Chief of Miracle Healer Valley banished my father from the sect,

89
00:08:12,170 --> 00:08:16,820
there was no reason to take after someone else's surname. Right?

90
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,820
I was a lonely wanderer, a traveler with no roots.
(T/N: "Ke" and "xing" both mean traveler")

91
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:27,170
It was only fitting to change to this name.

92
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:29,170
But right now, you...

93
00:08:29,170 --> 00:08:30,850
What?

94
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:36,940
Before I met you and Chengling,

95
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:40,950
I also planned on traveling the world,

96
00:08:40,950 --> 00:08:45,370
to die drunk, and be buried immediately to complete my sorry life.

97
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,900
At the time, I had already believed I was homeless.

98
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:55,170
But now it's all right, we are all back.

99
00:08:56,690 --> 00:09:00,500
Here! To you!

100
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:04,430
"Lonely wanderer, traveler with no roots."

101
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,510
"Enjoying the passing clouds while holding your hand."

102
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,920
I plan to keep living here.

103
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,790
As long as Elder Ye can heal my illness,

104
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:27,500
Chengling and I will live here for the rest of our lives.

105
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,780
Old Wen, you can come back whenever you like.

106
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,390
"Although wandering the unfamiliar world brings joy,

107
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,420
nothing is better than returning home."
(T/N: Poem from the Wen Xuan, one of the oldest and most important Chinese poetry anthologies)

108
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,910
- A'Xiang!
- Why did you take so long just to get water?

109
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:11,780
Let's go, quickly.

110
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,940
A'Xiang, I think I saw Tao Hong and Lv Liu.

111
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:16,190
What are you talking about?

112
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:20,290
It's that pair of elders that attacked us and kidnapped Sister Xiaolian at Yueyang Sect!

113
00:10:38,570 --> 00:10:41,190
Did you see clearly? Are you sure it's them?

114
00:10:41,190 --> 00:10:45,280
I can't be mistaken. I'm sure that girl is Sister Xiaolian under disguise.

115
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:48,030
I heard Sister Xiaolian when I was getting water.

116
00:10:48,030 --> 00:10:51,430
I'm guessing her major acupuncture points are blocked.

117
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:54,620
So aside from eating and drinking, she's unable to anything else.

118
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:58,750
Moreover, that Tao Hong and Lv Liu each had one arm cut off by the Hanging Ghost's Soul Winding Threads.

119
00:10:58,750 --> 00:11:02,180
You were far away and weren't able to tell, but those two elders each lack an arm.

120
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,660
They just purposefully used their robe sleeves to cover it.

121
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:06,610
If it's really them...

122
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:08,770
A'Xiang, I'm sure it's them!

123
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:11,390
We've finally bumped into them and cannot lose them!

124
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,000
Let's hurry and think of an idea!

125
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:19,280
A'Xiang, what's the matter?

126
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,510
A'Xiang, don't be afraid.

127
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:24,530
No matter how strong the enemy is, I give my life to protect you and Sister Xiaolian.

128
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:27,410
Who can you protect with your little bit of skill?

129
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,790
Eldest Brother Cao, let's not wade into this muddy water.
(N/T: Don't get into this mess)

130
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:35,770
You almost lost your life last time.

131
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:39,890
A'Xiang, how can you think this way?

132
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,870
How can I abandon Sister Xiaolian and do nothing?

133
00:11:41,870 --> 00:11:44,520
If you're afraid, then you stay and I'll go.

134
00:11:44,520 --> 00:11:47,870
Even if I'm beaten to death, it's better than being a cowardly disciple.

135
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:51,780
Go ahead! Let's see who you can save while losing your life for nothing!

136
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,450
Stop!

137
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:59,410
Cao Weining, how dare you treat me this way?

138
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:04,070
You... You promised my master that you would not disappoint me.

139
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:09,600
A'Xiang, I will definitely not disappoint you,

140
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,480
but loyalty must be fulfilled before romantic love.

141
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,490
How can I leave my good friend without helping?

142
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,510
How will I be worthy of your goodness then?

143
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,860
Did I forbid you to go?

144
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,740
I only said I didn't want you to lose your life for nothing.

145
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:26,820
If we can't overcome them just through combat, shouldn't we think of a strategy?

146
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:29,640
A'Xiang, I'm sorry.

147
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:32,330
I... misunderstood you.

148
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:35,880
Don't waste time saying useless things. Rescuing her is more urgent.

149
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,980
You should quickly follow Sister Xiaolian and them and leave tracking marks along the way.

150
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:44,900
We're not far from the Broken Sword Mountain Villa. They also belong to the Five Lakes Alliance.

151
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:47,550
I'll go to them for help and intercept them soon.

152
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,690
A'Xiang, this is a great idea!

153
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,330
You are the smart one.

154
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,300
Quick telling me useless things. I'm going to remember this grudge I bear against you.

155
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,380
Let's settle the score when the time is appropriate.

156
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:57,090
Hurry and go!

157
00:13:06,110 --> 00:13:10,260
This silly boy is really a big idiot.

158
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:14,490
After I leave, how could he fend for himself?

159
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,640
When I think about how others will bully him, I get upset.

160
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:42,850
Elder Huang, didn't we agree to meet in the rundown temple in Dashi Town?

161
00:13:42,850 --> 00:13:44,370
Why have you come first?

162
00:13:44,370 --> 00:13:47,450
My whereabouts were exposed in Dashi Town,

163
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:49,680
and I was pursued by Venomous Scorpions all the way here.

164
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,930
I was only able to shake them off just now.

165
00:13:52,930 --> 00:13:55,900
All of us were cheated by that bastard Zhao Jing.

166
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,770
Both the good and evil were after me.

167
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,830
The good chased me, the bad wanted to kill me.

168
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:06,740
Little Gao girl, do you know the relationship between Zhao Jing and Venomous Scorpions?

169
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,650
I told you long ago

170
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,510
Uncle Zhao will definitely come to save me.

171
00:14:12,510 --> 00:14:13,910
Bullshit!

172
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:17,330
I sent a message to him long ago, asking him to make an exchange for the hostage.

173
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:19,230
He didn't even make a noise.

174
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:21,770
He would rather that we kill you, the hostage,

175
00:14:21,770 --> 00:14:23,760
so you would die without evidence.

176
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:28,080
Fuck it. It's likely that the man who schemed to kill Gao Chong

177
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,880
was also that bastard!

178
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,710
Huang He.

179
00:14:33,710 --> 00:14:38,230
My husband and I fought with so much effort to help you kidnap this girl.

180
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:41,880
Sleeping in the wild, eating nothing but wind, hiding around all this way.

181
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:45,250
We endured it for so long. Was it all wasted effort?

182
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,930
People's plans can't overcome Heaven's will.

183
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:51,500
Who could have predicted that Gao Chong would have died just like that?

184
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,660
Who could have guessed that none of his brothers

185
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,860
cared about his orphaned descendant's life?

186
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,320
As it is now,

187
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:02,600
Zhao Jing is not going to use Glazed Armor to exchange for this girl.

188
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,890
Stinky girl, if you can't find anyone who will offer the money to buy you,

189
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:09,680
you are a worthless waste.

190
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:13,410
Believe it or not, but I can sell you to the dirtiest brothel.

191
00:15:13,410 --> 00:15:17,110
Huang He, at your age,

192
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:19,570
you could be her grandfather.

193
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:23,160
Do you have any shame speaking such disgusting words?

194
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:27,800
Old lady Tao Hong, if we do not do this, how do we take revenge for

195
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:30,590
the multiple heroes who died on Mount Qingya?

196
00:15:30,590 --> 00:15:33,120
So many people's deaths were caused by the Five Lakes Alliance.

197
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,470
Even though that Devil Gao died,

198
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:39,600
we can not go easy on the devil's daughter!

199
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,620
My father wasn't a devil!

200
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:43,130
My father didn't hurt anyone!

201
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:46,590
Shut up! What do you know?

202
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:52,560
Does this little girl know nothing?

203
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,050
Then I will let you know.

204
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:57,530
Twenty years ago,

205
00:15:57,530 --> 00:16:00,600
the only reason why so many people died during the Battle of Mount Qingya

206
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:03,410
was because the Five Lakes Alliance

207
00:16:03,410 --> 00:16:06,390
lied to the heroes of this world!

208
00:16:06,390 --> 00:16:08,880
The only reason why they ganged up on Rong Xuan

209
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,960
was because they were fighting for his Glazed Armor.

210
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:14,650
However, they claimed righteousness in defense of their actions

211
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:17,410
to trick countless people into risking their lives for them!

212
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:20,710
Tao Hong and Lv Liu's only beloved son

213
00:16:20,710 --> 00:16:24,390
also became seriously injured and died during this battle!

214
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:28,800
Five Lakes Alliance was able to grow powerful only because large amounts of righteous heroes

215
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,850
became injured or died in that battle.

216
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,840
How pitiful.

217
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,930
How unfortunate for those who were buried in Mount Qingya.

218
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,230
Even now, they are still a bunch of confused idiots.

219
00:16:39,230 --> 00:16:42,100
You-You're lying!

220
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,170
Huang He, we are all old, sly foxes.

221
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:48,320
What tricks are you trying to pull in front of me?

222
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:51,250
Since this little girl isn't worth a cent,

223
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:57,190
then all right. Let's not torture an innocent child.

224
00:16:57,190 --> 00:16:59,770
- Let's give her a quick death!
- Stop!

225
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:01,390
Stop!

226
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,860
Sister Xiaolian!

227
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:07,430
Cao Weining!

228
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:10,830
Elder Huang, I have always respected you as a powerful senior.

229
00:17:10,830 --> 00:17:14,290
Who would've thought you could do something so horrible!

230
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:15,830
Is your master here?

231
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,820
It's never too late to turn back. Hurry and join us.

232
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:22,290
Help me kill them and rescue Lady Gao.

233
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,550
Where did this stupid boy come from?

234
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:30,160
Old man, you heard that, right?

235
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:34,880
He wants Huang to join them!

236
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,970
Stop laughing!

237
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:40,090
Young man, are you her lover?

238
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,610
By wholeheartedly trying to rescue her, don't you fear death?

239
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:45,090
I'm not. There's no fear of death in the face of righteousness!

240
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,430
Hurry and let her go, and I'll forget about your past actions!

241
00:17:48,430 --> 00:17:51,830
Otherwise, every single person in the martial arts world is currently looking for her.

242
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:53,460
What?

243
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,160
Huang He, you're exposed now!

244
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:59,020
You've been continuously trying to make me and my husband

245
00:17:59,020 --> 00:18:01,700
hand over Young Lady Gao to you

246
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,710
so you could take all the benefits to yourself.

247
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,630
We've already done all of the dirty, tiring work.

248
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:09,200
After you're done with us, you want to throw us away?

249
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,800
It's not that easy!

250
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,840
Whether it's easy or not

251
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:16,450
will depend on your abilities!

252
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:22,060
Sister Xiaolian, let's go!

253
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,570
Hurry!

254
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,490
Let's see where you can run off to!

255
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:46,720
We've already killed Elder Huang.

256
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,030
Girl, come with me!

257
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:50,870
Sister Xiaolian, hurry and run! I'll block them!

258
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:52,100
We're going together!

259
00:18:52,100 --> 00:18:53,850
Hurry and run!

260
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,580
Weining!

261
00:19:23,220 --> 00:19:26,260
Tao Hong! Lv Liu! How dare you!

262
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:29,990
Uncle Shen!

263
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:32,150
I'm warning you.

264
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:35,120
Don't try to come after my niece. Hurry and get out of my sight!

265
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:36,820
A'Xiang!

266
00:19:40,230 --> 00:19:41,930
Eldest Brother Cao!

267
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:46,450
Eldest Brother Cao, are you okay?

268
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,070
Are you okay?

269
00:19:48,070 --> 00:19:50,660
Shen Shen, enough with the chatter!

270
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:53,920
We're taking her today for sure!

271
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,960
Old man!

272
00:20:15,810 --> 00:20:17,250
Uncle Shen!

273
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,330
- Old man! Old man!
- Old lady!

274
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,930
- Forget about me.
- Old man.

275
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,060
Husband and wife are birds of the same forest

276
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:26,420
that fly separately during disaster.

277
00:20:26,420 --> 00:20:27,960
Go on your way.

278
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,330
Shut up!

279
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,320
Shen Shen, go ahead.

280
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,100
Shen Shen, let my old lady go.

281
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:39,590
I-I...

282
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:42,040
Don't waste words with them!

283
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,060
Old man,

284
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:48,130
is it not a good thing for us to die together?

285
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:54,320
Next life, I'll be your old man.

286
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:57,360
I'll let you bully me.

287
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:00,130
All right. I'll help you along!

288
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:02,250
Uncle Shen, wait a second!

289
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,510
Grandpa. Grandma.

290
00:21:08,510 --> 00:21:11,880
Elder Huang said

291
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:15,600
our Five Lakes Alliance led the Battle of Mount Qingya

292
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:19,230
which resulted in the death of your son.

293
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,050
Is that true?

294
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:23,300
Why are you asking us?

295
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:26,340
Ask Great Warrior Shen!

296
00:21:26,340 --> 00:21:29,390
Five Lakes Alliance made us

297
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:33,300
white-haired people send away black-haired people.

298
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,460
Physically broken and emotionally hurt.

299
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:42,660
If I don't take this revenge, I am not a human!

300
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:45,450
If I can't take revenge alive,

301
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:51,130
I'll still take my revenge on Gao Chong as a ghost in death!

302
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:57,920
Turns out that what they said was true.

303
00:21:57,920 --> 00:22:00,360
No wonder these years, Father—

304
00:22:01,210 --> 00:22:04,980
Uncle Shen, let them go.

305
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,570
Xiaolian! They kidnapped you for so long!

306
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:11,750
It was Elder Huang who ordered this whole thing.

307
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:15,390
Grandpa and Grandma were also being used.

308
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:21,040
Moreover, although Grandma kidnapped me for so long, she's not a bad person by nature!

309
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:24,900
Every time Elder Huang wanted to bully me,

310
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:27,600
Grandma always protected me.

311
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:33,060
Uncle Shen, if we always take revenge, when will it be over?

312
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:36,990
Our Five Lakes Alliance owes them a life.

313
00:22:36,990 --> 00:22:40,180
Today, let us return it.

314
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,760
Stupid girl, we don't need your pity!

315
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,500
Who repays debt this way?

316
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,580
My son died young!

317
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:51,070
- I—
- Shut up, Old Lady.

318
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:57,750
Sect Leader Shen, we have walked among the martial arts world for twenty years.

319
00:22:57,750 --> 00:23:01,290
Although we can't be considered good people,

320
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,190
we've never lied.

321
00:23:04,190 --> 00:23:10,850
Today, if you let us go,

322
00:23:10,850 --> 00:23:15,240
we will back out of the martial arts world.

323
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,060
Shut up! You can't decide for me!

324
00:23:19,870 --> 00:23:23,400
Shen Shen, he's grown cowardly,

325
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:27,790
but my hatred for the Five Lakes Alliance won't end until I get revenge!

326
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,000
If you dare, then kill me!

327
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,000
During Mount Qingya's battle,

328
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:44,700
my niece wasn't born yet. The resentments of the older generation

329
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,100
shouldn't be forced on the children.

330
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,500
I will let you two leave today since you protected my niece.

331
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,800
If you want to take revenge on Five Lakes Alliance again,

332
00:23:55,800 --> 00:24:00,200
just come find me. I will be waiting. Get out of here!

333
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,300
You—

334
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,200
Wait!

335
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,800
Grandpa.

336
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,200
Grandma.

337
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:36,400
Travel safely.

338
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Is Weining okay?

339
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:03,870
You two were together this whole time?

340
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:10,800
You were the one who brought Uncle Shen, right?

341
00:25:14,450 --> 00:25:15,790
All right.

342
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,300
I'm relieved that they are all safe.

343
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:23,300
Great Warrior Shen, kill me if you'd like.

344
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:27,000
A'Xiang, what are you saying?

345
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
Why would Uncle Shen kill you?

346
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:31,000
Where's Wen Kexing?

347
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:34,800
I already said I don't know. Even if you ask again, I still don't know.

348
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,800
The words of a person facing death are kind.

349
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,400
I'm not lying to you.

350
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:43,200
A'Xiang, what nonsense are you saying?

351
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
Sister Xiaolian,

352
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:51,400
consider the fact that I've always been good to you

353
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:54,200
and promise to never tell Eldest Brother Cao

354
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,000
- that I'm—
- Tell him what?

355
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:00,900
- What are you talking about, A'Xiang?
- Xiaolian, come here. Don't stand next to her.

356
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:07,400
Uncle, there has to be some misunderstanding between you two.

357
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:09,800
If there's any misunderstanding, it will get better once we resolve it.

358
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:11,800
What misunderstanding?

359
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:14,800
She's the Chief of Ghost Valley's closest maid.

360
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,600
Ask her. Is A'Xiang her real name?

361
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,100
That's actually real.

362
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,000
I don't do things with fake names. Amethyst Fiend, Gu Xiang here.

363
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:28,200
Why? Am I, a minor ghost, included in the Evil Ghosts Portraits?

364
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,300
I certainly have some fame.

365
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:33,600
Why are you apart from Wen Kexing but rather, with my good Nephew Cao instead?

366
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,800
Tell me the truth.

367
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:39,800
If I told you, would you believe me?

368
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:51,600
I don't want to live as a lonely, wild ghost anymore.

369
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:55,400
I want to find a path back to the human world

370
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:59,500
and be with him forever.

371
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,400
Do you believe me?

372
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:06,200
Since you already know your identity has been exposed,

373
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,400
why would you still ask me for help?

374
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,700
Aren't you afraid I will kill you?

375
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:12,800
There's nothing to be done.

376
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,000
The old saying says you become like the chicken you marry.

377
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,800
You become like the dog you marry. What can I do if I found

378
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:23,800
a man that places his life after righteousness?

379
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,200
I can only try to mimic him.

380
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:35,400
Sect Leader Shen, won't you consider my little kindness

381
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,400
and tell me if I am in the Evil Ghosts Portraits?

382
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,200
You aren't.

383
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:51,200
I'm not. It's good that I'm not.

384
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:57,300
This way Eldest Brother Cao will never know.

385
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:04,000
Sect Leader Shen. Sister Xiaolian.

386
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:09,000
I have a favor to ask. After you kill me,

387
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:11,500
can you help me keep it a secret from Eldest Brother Cao?

388
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:15,000
Just say I was killed by Huang He.

389
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:18,000
This way, he won't know I've been deceiving him.

390
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,200
Won't you?

391
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,000
No, no, A'Xiang. You're not!

392
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:25,400
Uncle Shen, A'Xiang is a good girl.

393
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:27,800
Don't kill her. Don't kill her, okay?

394
00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:31,800
Stupid girl, don't be an idiot like me.

395
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:36,820
I've lived half my life and can't even tell a human from a ghost.

396
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,800
Come with me.

397
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,200
Master, are you going to start teaching me boxing now?

398
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:28,200
After I reached my peak in martial arts, I've rarely worked on my boxing.

399
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:34,000
If your junior master is willing to instruct you some,

400
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,400
that would be the truly great thing.

401
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,500
What are you saying?

402
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:41,300
Who doesn't teach their own disciple but allows outsiders to teach?

403
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:44,800
Are you an outsider?

404
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:46,200
Of course not!

405
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:50,200
Uncle Wen, can I call you "junior master" now?

406
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:56,000
If you don't say anything, then that's a yes?

407
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,200
Stupid brat,

408
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,540
you were so cute when you were a bit silly.

409
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:03,000
How come now that we're close, you've become like a macaque monkey?

410
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:07,200
Good Junior Master, where did you learn all your martial arts?

411
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,800
Stupid brat, that's enough.

412
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,700
My disciple is so mischievous because you've spoiled him.

413
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:24,400
Chengling, your martial arts is still basic, so you can't learn anything too high skilled right now.

414
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:28,400
Today, I'll teach you one of the most basic sets, Eight Trigram Palm.

415
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:32,400
Your grandmaster used this palm set to draw me into the sect back then.

416
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:35,800
Master, speaking of that, we've been back so many days already.

417
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:37,900
The rooms are cleaned up, too.

418
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,700
I haven't paid respects to Grandmaster yet.

419
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:44,400
Before teaching me martial arts today, let's go greet him.

420
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,400
We have to tell him that you have accepted me, a good disciple,

421
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:52,100
and brought Junior Master back! I'm sure he'll be very happy in the heavens!

422
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:54,700
Chengling, I—

423
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,000
I am indebted to Lord Qin.

424
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:05,000
I should go express my thanks at his grave.

425
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:09,200
All right. Let's go together.

426
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,000
To Grandmaster and Young Junior Master above,

427
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,800
your disciple, Zhang Chengling, is finally able to bow to you.

428
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:37,800
Don't worry, I will work hard

429
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,600
and bring glory to Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

430
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:43,200
Grandmaster, around this time you've probably already seen my father

431
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,600
and Master Long, right?

432
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:47,400
The generations seem a little messed up.

433
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,000
But it's okay! We are all a family. Please tell them

434
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,600
I am doing very well, and I'm improving every day!

435
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:56,600
I'm also trying my best to learn the secret arts of the Dragon Pool Cabinet

436
00:31:56,600 --> 00:32:00,200
that Master Long taught me. Although, it is a little hard.

437
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,200
Stupid brat.

438
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:06,600
If you chatter so much when you're young, what will happen when you grow older?

439
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:10,300
I have a lot of things to say to Grandmaster and Young Junior Master.

440
00:32:10,300 --> 00:32:13,200
Father told me that the souls of those who have passed away never lose their sense.

441
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,200
They will always watch over their loved ones.

442
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:20,400
They won't. They won't be able to see.

443
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:21,400
They can!

444
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:25,300
Uncle Wen, say something to Grandmaster and them.

445
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:31,000
Chengling, since souls never lose their sense, there's no need to say it out loud.

446
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:34,600
Sometimes, speaking silently within your heart is better.

447
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:37,900
Right. Okay, I'll say it in my heart.

448
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,900
[Lord Qin Huaizhang]

449
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:58,200
Chengling, don't say any more.

450
00:32:58,200 --> 00:33:01,800
If you say more, your grandmaster is going to be annoyed to death by you.

451
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:05,000
If you have anything else, leave it for next time.

452
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,600
In the future, we can come to see them frequently.

453
00:33:16,630 --> 00:33:18,860
Old Wen.

454
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,280
A'Xu, why don't you two go first?

455
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:25,460
I want... to be alone for a bit.

456
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:30,000
Okay. Chengling.

457
00:33:42,390 --> 00:33:47,420
[Lord Qin Huaizhang]

458
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:19,750
Does this world

459
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:23,960
actually have an underworld?

460
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,840
Master...

461
00:34:27,850 --> 00:34:32,230
No, Uncle Qin.

462
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,210
Elder Qin.

463
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,490
Has your soul in Heaven

464
00:34:39,340 --> 00:34:41,790
seen my parents?

465
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:49,470
I wish for the dead to have souls,

466
00:34:51,430 --> 00:34:54,220
yet I am afraid you can actually see.

467
00:34:56,330 --> 00:35:01,720
I'm afraid you will see the way in which I got here

468
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,700
and despise me for dirtying the Four Seasons Mountain Villa's honor.

469
00:35:08,250 --> 00:35:10,110
In the beginning,

470
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:17,770
when I couldn't endure it any longer, I would pretend...

471
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:21,650
I would pretend that the person suffering wasn't me,

472
00:35:21,650 --> 00:35:26,330
and it was just one of Zhen Yan's nightmares.

473
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,630
When I woke up,

474
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:34,080
I would still find myself in that little peasant family garden.

475
00:35:35,310 --> 00:35:37,230
Time...

476
00:35:39,010 --> 00:35:42,470
was forever stopped at the moment you took me in as a disciple.

477
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:45,340
Never proceeding on.

478
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,980
But later, I realized

479
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,980
it wasn't Zhen Yan trapped in a nightmare,

480
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:15,910
but it was me who dreamed a beautiful dream as Zhen Yan.

481
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:25,490
There is no path to Heaven and no revenge for the good and bad.

482
00:36:25,490 --> 00:36:29,670
If that's so, then I would rather become an evil devil

483
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:32,490
and regain my own justice from the heavens.

484
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:37,160
These twenty years, it wasn't blood that flowed through my body.

485
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:39,650
It was hatred.

486
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:45,290
Only the wish for revenge supported me as I crawled back up from Hell.

487
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:50,150
As I became the Chief of the Devils and the King of Ghosts,

488
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,310
that old Ghost never would've dreamed

489
00:36:54,310 --> 00:36:58,710
that twenty years later, I could make reality each and every one of Zhen Yan's curses

490
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:00,690
- and kill every single one of them.
- Evil ghosts!

491
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:02,390
I want all of your lives!

492
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,680
All of them!

493
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,470
But after killing them all,

494
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:22,120
the hate in my heart did not fade.

495
00:37:22,840 --> 00:37:27,510
Everyone who turned their backs on us, betrayed us, and threatened us,

496
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:30,860
they are all covered in my parents' fresh blood!

497
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:33,740
All of them are evil devils in human skin!

498
00:37:33,740 --> 00:37:36,720
I won't let any one of them go!

499
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:41,560
The people of this world fail me, so everyone within this world is killable!

500
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:46,900
When I left the valley, I promised myself

501
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:49,200
that I would burn down this hypocritical martial arts world,

502
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:52,800
that I would force all of these devils back into Hell!

503
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:58,610
If this is a sin, then I will face burning mountains, blood oceans, and all of the unforgivable evils alone!

504
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:03,680
If you want me to die, then I am willing to burn with them in Hell!

505
00:38:05,090 --> 00:38:08,900
But... But...

506
00:38:14,420 --> 00:38:17,140
But since you've already thrown me into Hell,

507
00:38:19,610 --> 00:38:23,350
why give me a path back to the human world?

508
00:38:57,740 --> 00:39:00,440
My, Wen Kexing's, life is ruined.

509
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:04,530
I don't deserve the right to call you "Master."

510
00:39:04,530 --> 00:39:07,240
If there's a next life,

511
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:10,430
I will definitely pay a debt of gratitude.

512
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:12,500
If there is no next life,

513
00:39:13,250 --> 00:39:15,630
even if I fall into Hell forever,

514
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:21,750
I thank you for giving me brief light.

515
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,130
A'Xiang.

516
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,110
You're awake, you big idiot?

517
00:40:05,110 --> 00:40:07,530
A'Xiang! Where's Sister Xiaolian?

518
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:10,480
Don't hurry. Drink some water first.

519
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:19,090
You idiot! I already said to just watch and not try anything.

520
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:23,140
Thank goodness I brought Broken Sword Mountain Villa in time, or else your life would be gone!

521
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:26,840
You rescued her! Then where did they go?

522
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,700
Sister Xiaolian fainted from the scare.

523
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,490
She was taken back to Five Lakes Alliance by Leader Mu.

524
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:34,490
That's good. That's good.

525
00:40:37,510 --> 00:40:39,250
It worked out.

526
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:43,930
I should... not tell him anything.

527
00:40:43,930 --> 00:40:47,340
A'Xiang, you are so smart.

528
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:49,210
Smart?

529
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:52,240
I wouldn't dare accept this. I wonder who was saying

530
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:54,200
that I'm scared of death.

531
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,950
No, A'Xiang!

532
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:58,970
That was my bad! I was just confused.

533
00:40:58,970 --> 00:41:01,060
Moreover, I'm easily agitated. I was the stupid one.

534
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:04,150
Why don't you hit me and take out your anger?

535
00:41:04,150 --> 00:41:06,370
You... are you an idiot?

536
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:10,220
Just lie down! Who'd want to hit you?

537
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:12,500
You are dirtying my hand.

538
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,850
A'Xiang.

539
00:41:29,690 --> 00:41:31,660
Hey,

540
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:37,390
do you think we're incompatible?

541
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,370
Ever since you met me,

542
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,850
you always get injured every few days.

543
00:41:41,850 --> 00:41:44,960
That has nothing to do with you! My martial arts is just not good enough.

544
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:48,360
I'm always getting beaten up every few days.

545
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:53,140
But don't worry, once we're back to Gentle Wind Mountain, I'll practice my martial arts and protect you!

546
00:41:53,140 --> 00:41:55,440
I won't let anyone bully you!

547
00:41:55,440 --> 00:41:57,630
Who dares to bully me! Only you!

548
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:00,210
I don't dare! I would never dare to!

549
00:42:00,210 --> 00:42:03,060
Besides, Junior Master pities girls the most.

550
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:07,610
Whenever sisters from other sects come to our place, he treats them like treasures!

551
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,580
If he knew I bullied you,

552
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:14,250
he would definitely break my legs.

553
00:42:14,250 --> 00:42:16,400
And Brother Wen, too.

554
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:23,330
Wait! That's not right A'Xiang! How could I bully you?

555
00:42:23,330 --> 00:42:25,560
You misled me!

556
00:42:31,510 --> 00:42:36,290
What if... we're actually incompatible? Then what?

557
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,870
What are you saying, A'Xiang?

558
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:41,040
That's impossible!

559
00:42:41,850 --> 00:42:45,770
I'm serious! What if we are actually incompatible?

560
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,040
Then I will give you my life.

561
00:42:55,290 --> 00:42:59,810
A'Xiang, but before I die,

562
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:02,690
can you give me some food?

563
00:43:02,690 --> 00:43:04,780
I'm about to die from starvation.

564
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,560
Here, eat! Be careful, it's hot.

565
00:43:13,270 --> 00:43:15,320
Here, you eat first.

566
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:17,450
I'll watch you eat.

567
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:22,460
I'll give you the big one.

568
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,880
The buns A'Xiang makes are the best!

569
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:36,160
It's the most delicious food in the world!

570
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:15,170
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

571
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,790
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

572
00:44:23,790 --> 00:44:30,930
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

573
00:44:30,930 --> 00:44:37,860
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

574
00:44:39,490 --> 00:44:46,500
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

575
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:53,970
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

576
00:44:53,970 --> 00:45:01,560
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river,
but can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

577
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:09,330
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

578
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:16,530
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late
Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

579
00:45:16,530 --> 00:45:23,610
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

580
00:45:24,550 --> 00:45:31,730
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills
The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

581
00:45:31,730 --> 00:45:38,800
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

582
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:46,350
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
