[Episode 21]

23
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,500
Greetings, Scorpion King.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,370
All the ghost brothers are here.

25
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,750
Why are all of you looking so angry?

26
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,490
Scram!

27
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:29,660
Ghost Brother, why are you acting so fierce?

28
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,610
Who do you think you're scaring?

29
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:33,020
That's enough.

30
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,530
Scorpion King, we followed Alliance Leader Zhao

31
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,970
because we are tired of the days of fighting and killing, and we want to cleanse ourselves of it and retire.

32
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:44,280
The Immortal Dawn Sect has nothing to do with Ghost Valley.

33
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,060
This... just forget about it.

34
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,880
What a coincidence.

35
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:54,220
What Alliance Leader Zhao wants is your ability to kill people and set fires.

36
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:58,630
If evil ghosts don't kill, should they farm and collect rent?

37
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:02,300
Even Alliance Leader Zhao wouldn't dare to talk this way to our leader,

38
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:04,640
you stinky rascal.

39
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:08,300
Stinky rascal?

40
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:21,220
Let me give you some fragrant powder

41
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,320
to eliminate your stink.

42
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,860
You wicked woman! How dare you poison him?

43
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,680
Bring the antidote!

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,290
Impudent!

45
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:34,700
You were rude to the alliance partners in my presence.

46
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,340
Give him the antidote.

47
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,460
Yes.

48
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:59,930
Alliance Leader Zhao asked everyone here to destroy the Immortal Dawn Sect.

49
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,290
He naturally has his reasons.

50
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,620
If you aren't willing,

51
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:08,680
we can just go our separate ways. There is no need to ruin our peaceful relationship.

52
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,930
However, when we meet again later, it's hard to say whether we'll be friends or foes.

53
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:18,330
Brother Changing, don't you agree?

54
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,830
Scorpion King, you're too serious.

55
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:28,000
If Alliance Leader Zhao wants to destroy this measly Immortal Dawn Sect,

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,390
I, Changing, will just do as he wishes.

57
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:32,350
Very good.

58
00:04:32,350 --> 00:04:35,890
Yes, I'll send Pretty Arhat to go with you

59
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,300
to ensure success.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:43,090
Brothers, let's go!

61
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:51,470
Malicious Bodhisattva, tell Pretty Arhat

62
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,870
to keep a few alive to let them report the news.

63
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,820
Report the news?

64
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,860
Report it to whom?

65
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,610
Report it to the entire martial arts world.

66
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,900
The Immortal Dawn Sect, founded a hundred years ago, has been destroyed

67
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:13,500
by Ghost Valley. I'll see who will stand by and do nothing.

68
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,190
Ghost...

69
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:22,070
Old Changing,

70
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,670
you are the leader of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts.

71
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:32,610
You left your position of being a mighty leader and instead went

72
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:34,380
to be a lackey for those bastards?

73
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:38,250
Happy! I'm so damn happy!

74
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:44,410
Even though this Lunatic Wen is crazy, he is at least on the same boat as us.

75
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,500
If the boat sinks, he wouldn't have anywhere to run either.

76
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,430
Now that we've entered Ghost Valley,

77
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:54,710
how could we still continue to think about getting back ashore?

78
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:58,940
Do you think you can live without getting ashore?

79
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:02,300
Let's not talk about Wen Kexing first. That crazy man is abnormally unstable.

80
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,840
Just based on Ghost Valley's crazy deed this time,

81
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,210
he is deliberately making the whole world treat us as the enemy.

82
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:13,260
He wants people to hate and kill us.

83
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:16,840
If Gao Chong hadn't died this time,

84
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,940
and led his forces to repeat the Battle of Mount Qingya—

85
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:20,400
Useless talk!

86
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,640
Are Zhao Jing's actions any different from Lunatic Wen's?

87
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:27,910
He simply wants a war between Ghost Valley and those righteous dogs

88
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,570
so that both sides will fucking die.

89
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,680
Brother Changing, you are Zhao Jing's slave.

90
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,080
You may eventually end up with some fame and fortune.

91
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:42,050
Brother Happy and I are different.

92
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:45,160
Both of us have pants that are fully stained with blood.

93
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,450
They can no longer be washed clean.

94
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,780
If the two of us let ourselves be used as blades for Zhao Jing,

95
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,050
what benefits will we gain in the end?

96
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:59,570
Brother Lustful, is there any point in saying this now?

97
00:06:59,570 --> 00:07:02,520
We have already betrayed Lunatic Wen, that's an irreversible fact.

98
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,710
Under Zhao Jing's wings, we at least can live.

99
00:07:07,710 --> 00:07:12,910
If you are unwilling, you can just go back to the valley by yourself.

100
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,910
Go beg Lunatic Wen.

101
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:19,100
See whether he will forgive you.

102
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:24,980
You haven't been a part of the valley for very long.

103
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:31,000
You probably don't know how Lunatic Wen ascended to the throne of Valley Chief.

104
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:38,290
It is said, back then when Lunatic Wen usurped the throne,

105
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:41,930
he ate the former Ghost Valley's Chief, who was still alive, in front of everyone,

106
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:45,070
piece by piece.

107
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,460
This is what frightened everyone into cowardice.

108
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:50,710
Wrong.

109
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:54,530
In front of everyone,

110
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,210
he peeled the skin off the former chief while he was still alive.

111
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:15,650
Chief!

112
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:23,550
From this day on,

113
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:26,780
I am the supreme ruler!

114
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,150
So, Uncle Wen met you when he was a child?

115
00:09:39,150 --> 00:09:42,500
Why didn't Grand Master take him home?

116
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:45,960
At that time, Grand Master had an important mission to undertake.

117
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,690
It wasn't convenient to take along a seriously wounded patient.

118
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:52,890
So he promised that, after three months, he would take them back to the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

119
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:57,380
He just didn't expect that when he returned to that village,

120
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:01,670
the entire village had already been leveled flat.

121
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:09,510
This matter became an unresolved pain for your grand master.

122
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:14,810
Until my junior brother, Qin Jiuxiao, reached his adulthood and went through the sect entrance ceremony,

123
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,660
he said my junior brother was the third disciple.

124
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:24,530
That's when I knew that Master had always held regret over this matter.

125
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,380
Those people were already rescued,

126
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:29,590
but they got lost. Of course, he was sad.

127
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:33,000
You missed each other just by a little bit. Otherwise, Junior Master would have grown up with you.

128
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,670
So, Junior Master recognized you long ago?

129
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,820
Then, why didn't he admit that he was Zhen Yan?

130
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,800
Zhen Ruyu was the adopted son of Miracle Healer Valley's Old Zhen.

131
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,960
I assume he was originally surnamed, Wen.

132
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,720
That's why he's unwilling to hear the word "Zhen" again.

133
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,560
Why not?

134
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:58,470
Former Valley Chief Zhen expelled them from the sect.

135
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:01,260
What happened to Great Warrior Zhen and the others later on?

136
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,220
- Master?
- That's enough, kid.

137
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:05,180
Don't keep poking into someone's privacy.

138
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,720
Look at Wen Kexing's demeanor. Does he look like he grew up with parents who disciplined him?

139
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,250
Elder.

140
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:13,690
You... Are you saying

141
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:16,730
that Great Warrior Zhen and the others might've...

142
00:11:17,730 --> 00:11:20,140
The Zhen ...couple

143
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,900
probably died long ago.

144
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,210
This must be an unmendable pain in your junior master's heart.

145
00:11:25,220 --> 00:11:27,480
If he doesn't mention it,

146
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,140
you must not ask. Do you hear?

147
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,820
Good kid.

148
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,310
No matter whether or not he acknowledges me as his senior brother,

149
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:40,660
I will always acknowledge him as my junior brother.

150
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:45,160
I'm just sad that a person as good as Great Warrior Zhen

151
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:48,080
didn't eventually have a good ending.

152
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:52,150
Master, how come the better a person you are, the worse of an ending you get?

153
00:11:52,150 --> 00:11:56,460
This happened to Father, to Master Long, and to Great Warrior Zhen and his whole family.

154
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,430
Even Uncle Rong Xuan didn't do anything bad.

155
00:12:00,430 --> 00:12:02,440
We don't understand Heaven's will.

156
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,550
Fate decides against our wishes.

157
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:07,890
People who have feelings end up suffering hard.

158
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,280
It's not just the good people.

159
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:16,280
A'Xu, I see that you are accumulating merits from performing good deeds.

160
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:18,770
- You have almost—
- Uncle Wen.

161
00:12:20,020 --> 00:12:23,960
No, Junior Master. Can I call you "Junior Master?"

162
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:29,980
Old Monster, why are you still here?

163
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:32,890
If you can be here, why can't I be here?

164
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:38,990
We are going to the Four Seasons Mountain Villa. Why are you following us?

165
00:12:38,990 --> 00:12:43,080
There is one road leading the way, and we each walk a different side. Why do you care?

166
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:46,810
I dare go to the dragon's abyss and tiger's lair, why won't I go to the Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

167
00:12:46,810 --> 00:12:49,420
Sure, the lord of the villa is right here.

168
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:52,700
If he agrees that you can go, then I won't interfere.

169
00:12:52,700 --> 00:12:55,370
If Elder Ye is willing to visit the Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

170
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:57,460
of course we will welcome you.

171
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:02,770
I have long heard of the great reputation of that divine husband-and-wife team of healers.

172
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:06,430
What an outstanding couple in the martial arts world!

173
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,670
How did they give birth to such an annoying child?

174
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:12,960
What a pity! Nevertheless,

175
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:15,020
you are their child after all.

176
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:18,870
My good-for-nothing disciple owes a lot to your parents.

177
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,870
This debt...

178
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:24,330
as his master, it's my duty to repay it for him.

179
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:28,720
Stinking brat, if there's anything you wish for, tell me.

180
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,970
Listen.

181
00:13:32,970 --> 00:13:35,040
The dead cannot come back alive.

182
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
Other than my inability to do that,

183
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,250
there aren't many problems that I can't overcome in this world.

184
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,390
If you have a wish, just tell me.

185
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:44,970
I will definitely help you fulfill that wish.

186
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,960
Let me tell you.

187
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:50,530
I'm not trying to help you. This is what you deserve.

188
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:55,340
Wen Kexing, please tell me your wish.

189
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,020
Otherwise,

190
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,910
when I reach the very end of my life,

191
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,370
I won't be able to depart with ease of mind.

192
00:14:09,790 --> 00:14:12,030
I don't have any other wishes.

193
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:14,270
As long as you can cure A'Xu's injury,

194
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,690
all of our previous debts can be wiped clean.

195
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:21,060
However, you must ensure that his life expectancy isn't shortened and his martial arts skill isn't lost.

196
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:28,400
Stinking Brat, did you think this would be hard for me?

197
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:31,760
Although I don't have the solution, I know who does.

198
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,460
You people stay at the Four Seasons Mountain Villa and wait for me.

199
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:38,040
Elder, who will you be seeking?

200
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,430
How long will we wait for you?

201
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,810
If even he can't save you, I will...

202
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:48,800
Old Monster! Ye Baiyi!

203
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:51,020
How does he bear any resemblance to a hundred-year-old man?

204
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:53,920
When he gets impatient, he is like a kid.

205
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,930
What Old Monster means

206
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,980
is that your injury is curable?

207
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:02,150
He's so in love with boasting. For all I know, his final sentence could've meant

208
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:05,760
"I'll repay you by cutting off my head," or "I will pay respect at your funeral."

209
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,870
Did you hear that? Your master's injury can be cured!

210
00:15:09,870 --> 00:15:12,950
That's great. Elder Ye is so capable.

211
00:15:12,950 --> 00:15:15,110
If he says it's curable, it can definitely be cured.

212
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:16,660
We can go home!

213
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:19,430
Let's go home!

214
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,850
[Once the limit is determined, a stable pursuit can be chased. Once the stable pursuit is found...]

215
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:44,290
Father, your calligraphy is emitting a divine and reserved feel.

216
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:48,090
I especially like it. Can you place your stamp on it and gift it to me?

217
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:51,550
You are a little barbarian from the south. All you know how to do is show off your clever tongue.

218
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,950
Isn't everything of mine

219
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:57,950
all yours?

220
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,290
Here. Store it well.

221
00:16:02,290 --> 00:16:04,720
Elder Brother, it's me, Qiufeng, here for a visit.

222
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,980
Why are you refusing to see even me?

223
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:15,700
Leader Yu, please come in.

224
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,420
Elder Brother, I've missed you so much.

225
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:29,150
Brother, after not seeing you for many days,

226
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:31,900
your elegant bearing has become even better than before.

227
00:16:32,590 --> 00:16:35,420
Virtuous Younger Brother Yu, I trust you have been well.

228
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:40,610
Now, this Yueyang Sect is neat and tidy.

229
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:43,110
Control over who enters and exits has become so strict.

230
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:48,850
Compared to the past, when Gao...

231
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:52,450
when Gao Chong was still alive,

232
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:55,110
it was completely different.

233
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:58,930
This tea is still the same wonderful tea.

234
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:02,950
Virtuous Younger Brother, I haven't heard from you in so long.

235
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:06,540
I didn't even see any sign of you at the Heroes Conference.

236
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:10,060
Surely, there must've been some issue

237
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:12,350
that impeded you.

238
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,110
Elder Brother,

239
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:20,030
on the day of the Heroes Conference,

240
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:22,190
unforeseeable accidents kept occurring.

241
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:23,780
Oh?

242
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,630
Elder Brother, after you became the Alliance Leader of Five Lakes Alliance

243
00:17:27,630 --> 00:17:30,960
you passed like thunder and moved like the wind, accomplishing so many important things.

244
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,510
Why is it that this is the only matter that you have shown no interest in?

245
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,590
Your alliance suffered untold hardships to capture the Tragicomic Ghost

246
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:41,740
and then allowed her to be stolen away by others without good cause.

247
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:44,040
As the Alliance Leader,

248
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:47,470
how can you show such a complete lack of interest in this matter?

249
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,030
What do you mean?

250
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,600
I don't mean anything. It's just that I heard some rumors circulating from the disciples,

251
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:57,970
saying that the Tragicomic Ghost was originally named Luo Fumeng,

252
00:17:57,970 --> 00:18:00,790
who was your fiancée.

253
00:18:00,790 --> 00:18:02,520
You broke your promise to marry her the day of your wedding

254
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:07,200
and eloped with the daughter of the wealthy surveillance commissioner in West Zhejiang.

255
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:10,860
Goodness, your bride suffered this extraordinary shame and humiliation

256
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,860
and in a momentary spur of anger, went mad.

257
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:14,850
From then on, the world

258
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:17,400
lost a civilized lady from a prestigious family

259
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,730
and gained

260
00:18:19,730 --> 00:18:23,090
a female devil that specialized in killing unfaithful people.

261
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,270
Elder Brother,

262
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:28,210
I'm sure that this can't be true. Right?

263
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:30,540
You've always been such an upright and honorable person

264
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,950
and you and Sister-in-Law were a married couple in deep love.

265
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:36,270
T-T-This... How could you possibly do such a preposterous thing?

266
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:37,540
Drink some tea.

267
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:40,240
I have already had those that were starting these rumors soundly beaten

268
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:43,390
and then rushed here to warn you.

269
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:47,330
You say, you haven't been the leader of the alliance for long,

270
00:18:47,330 --> 00:18:48,950
and you are putting your grand plans in place.

271
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:52,820
You must guard against those vile people who are gossiping out there,

272
00:18:52,820 --> 00:18:55,300
destroying people's good reputations.

273
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:00,980
- Good tea.
- Good tea, good tea.

274
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:07,060
These were old matters from long ago.

275
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,820
Where did Yu Qiufeng learn of them?

276
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:13,330
The reliable people that I sent to move the Tragicomic Ghost had originally been proceeding smoothly,

277
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:16,010
but they all died within the Yueyang Sect.

278
00:19:16,010 --> 00:19:20,570
Could it be that Fumeng has actually fallen into this guy's hands?

279
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:24,050
How could this vile person have the cheek to slander you like this?

280
00:19:24,050 --> 00:19:26,430
I will go wipe out his Mount Hua Sect!

281
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:32,350
Father, don't be angry.

282
00:19:32,350 --> 00:19:34,610
Be careful. Anger is bad for your health.

283
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:39,940
What is there for me to get angry about?

284
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,370
Yu Qiufeng is merely a disruptive clown of little significance.

285
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,030
If a dog bites you,

286
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:49,580
would you bite it back?

287
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,870
A crazy dog should just be beaten to death.

288
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,240
Yes, Father.

289
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,020
I will immediately go pull out that feral dog's tongue.

290
00:20:07,570 --> 00:20:09,160
Wait a moment!

291
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:19,130
Xie'er, how many times have I told you already?

292
00:20:19,130 --> 00:20:21,280
You're always rude and impetuous in the way you handle things.

293
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:23,270
Mount Hua Sect is a renowned and noble sect.

294
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:26,760
If the sect leader dies right after visiting us,

295
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:29,360
wouldn't we be inviting critics?

296
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,640
Forget it. The less trouble, the better.

297
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:36,150
Let's wait until after they've left Yueyang.

298
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,000
But, Father, that guy slanders you so,

299
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,960
I can't stand listening to it.

300
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:42,840
If those rumors spread out—

301
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:44,800
Why should I be afraid?

302
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,330
A straight-standing tree isn't afraid of a crooked shadow.

303
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,350
Besides, I can have him killed any time, any place.

304
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:55,010
All right. The Green City Sect is waiting for me

305
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:57,770
to plot an attack against Ghost Valley.

306
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,610
You may leave now.

307
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:02,550
Yes.

308
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,170
If Fumeng is really in Yu Qiufeng's hands...

309
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,640
Wuyang!

310
00:21:16,790 --> 00:21:19,240
Father, any order for me?

311
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:22,200
Help me send a letter to the Ghosts.

312
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:26,320
Father, most of the people from Ghost Valley have left to deal with the Immortal Dawn Sect.

313
00:21:26,330 --> 00:21:28,480
Only Lustful Ghost is stationed there.

314
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:30,260
That's enough.

315
00:21:31,270 --> 00:21:32,570
Yes.

316
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:49,710
A'Xu, you go ahead and look for an inn.

317
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:52,370
I'm running out of liquor, so I'll buy some.

318
00:21:52,370 --> 00:21:54,890
Remember to fill up the liquor bag.

319
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:57,220
Do I owe you?

320
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,490
Am I your servant?

321
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:05,320
While you're at it, fill up my flask, too.

322
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:11,190
Do you want Bamboo Leaf Green or Daughter Red?

323
00:22:11,190 --> 00:22:13,120
As you wish.

324
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,660

[Cornelian Cherry Liquor]

328
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,330
Those girls from the Department of the Unfaithful

329
00:22:34,330 --> 00:22:36,260
have actually searched all the way to here.

330
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:39,980
Could it be that A'Xiang led them here?

331
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:48,720
At first, we hid for a few days under Ghoul's lead.

332
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:53,250
Later on, aside from Miss Xiang, no one came to meet up with us.

333
00:22:53,250 --> 00:22:56,500
Ghoul got upset and his old problem resurfaced.

334
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:59,560
He kept shouting that he wanted to eat human meat. He looked at us

335
00:22:59,560 --> 00:23:02,620
in such a salivating manner that we were really in fear.

336
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:05,720
Therefore, we got him drunk and secretly escaped.

337
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:08,020
Later, Sister Alluring sent a letter over,

338
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:11,370
saying that she had rescued Master and was staying with her while she recuperated.

339
00:23:11,370 --> 00:23:13,690
She told us not to act recklessly.

340
00:23:13,690 --> 00:23:15,820
So, ever since then,

341
00:23:15,820 --> 00:23:18,800
you have never seen anyone else from Ghost Valley?

342
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,880
Yes, other than Miss Xiang and Sister Alluring Ghost,

343
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:25,740
our group of women has limited martial art skills. If we do not have your protection or Master's,

344
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,310
we would be easy prey to anyone else.

345
00:23:28,310 --> 00:23:32,870
We hid for quite some time. Later, the storm gradually subsided.

346
00:23:32,870 --> 00:23:35,610
Miss Xiang said you were in the Shu area.

347
00:23:35,610 --> 00:23:37,930
We searched everywhere for your traces.

348
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:42,250
Thank goodness that we were lucky enough to finally encounter you.

349
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:45,080
Chief, where should our dozens of sisters in the Department of the Unfaithful

350
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,780
go?

351
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:49,270
Please give us your instruction.

352
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,210
Have you thought of any ideas?

353
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,770
We... We...

354
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:57,620
We will allow you to make the decision, Chief.

355
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:03,500
I am asking you, where do you want to go?

356
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,240
Then, if you don't have any other commands for us,

357
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,660
we will go back to Mount Qingya to wait for you and Master's return.

358
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:13,210
The world is so vast. Can't you find any place to go?

359
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:15,440
Do you have to return to that damn place?

360
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,090
Chief, we are a group of ill-fated girls who had no place to turn to.

361
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:23,980
Every single one of us was saved by Master before we could make a fateful decision.

362
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:26,560
We were all willing to serve and work for her in return.

363
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:30,260
The world is vast, but the only place that could be considered home

364
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,620
is our Ghost Valley.

365
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:48,490
When you enter Ghost Valley, you will either become the hunter or the prey.

366
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,930
Since you can't even protect yourselves,

367
00:24:50,930 --> 00:24:53,090
why bother going back to Ghost Valley?

368
00:24:53,670 --> 00:24:56,460
From now on, I don't care where you go,

369
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,220
but do not ever step foot inside Mount Qingya again.

370

He is so unruly.

Beat him or scold him as you wish.

378
00:25:27,410 --> 00:25:31,090
You took him in as your disciple, yet you want me to be in charge?

379
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:34,340
It's almost midnight, I must go to regulate my breathing.

380
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,850
Stinky boy, what did you do?

381
00:25:56,850 --> 00:25:59,020
I begged Master to tell me a bedtime story,

382
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:02,020
but Master is absolutely terrible at storytelling. The story he told

383
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:05,230
was even more boring than an old teacher's lectures.

384
00:26:05,230 --> 00:26:08,770
You were so obedient before. Why are you so insatiable now?

385
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:10,730
Even making such an unreasonable demand?

386
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,460
As it turns out, children should not be pampered.

387
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:14,510
Uncle Wen, why don't you tell me a story?

388
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,760
I'm sure your story will be much better than Master's.

389
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,970
Sister A'Xiang told me that you hold a lot of rare and strange stories in you,

390
00:26:19,970 --> 00:26:21,950
such as when Hong Hai split a mountain to save the White Snake,

391
00:26:21,950 --> 00:26:23,760
and when Jiang Ziya battled with the White-Bone Demon...

392
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:27,280
Stop, stop, stop. Why does that girl tell you everything?

393
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,060
Good Junior Master, I beg you! Tell me a story.

394
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:34,020
I will never make Master angry anymore, my good Junior Master.

"Only women and little people are difficult to deal with."
 (T/N: This famous Confucius quote is often debated for its true meaning. It likely refers to concubines and schemers)

396
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:40,710
Fine, I'll tell you a story.

397
00:26:40,710 --> 00:26:45,550
A long time ago, a man was walking in the desert.

398
00:26:45,550 --> 00:26:48,550
Unfortunately, he encountered a pack of wolves.

399
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,210
He was chased into a dead end.

400
00:26:51,210 --> 00:26:53,760
He suddenly discovered a well ahead of him.

401
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,330
With other choices, he climbed down the dry well by a rope.

402
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:01,280
Unexpectedly, when he climbed down halfway,

403
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,790
he saw a group of snakes at the bottom of the well.

404
00:27:04,790 --> 00:27:07,300
The snakes were hissing their spitting tongues at him.

405
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:11,420
He couldn't go up to the sky or go down to the ground.

406
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:14,950
He had no way to go while being chased from behind.

407
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:20,990
At that moment, he found a honeycomb hanging alongside the well.

408
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:24,830
The bees, buzzing and flying around, were starting to provoke him.

409
00:27:24,830 --> 00:27:27,280
He was stung to unspeakable misery.

410
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:30,740
Even worse, the rope that he was holding onto

411
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:32,450
could not withstand his weight

412
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,980
and was gradually sliding down.

413
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:40,470
Suddenly, he noticed that the honeycomb on the well's wall

414
00:27:40,470 --> 00:27:43,450
was oozing honey.

415
00:27:43,450 --> 00:27:47,560
He stuck his finger out, scraped a little honey,

416
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,720
put it into his mouth,

417
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:52,930
and concentrated completely on sucking it.

418
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:08,200
One's mortal life is like dreams and bubbles.

419
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:10,590
What mortals desperately pursue

420
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:13,870
is no more than

421
00:28:13,870 --> 00:28:16,220
a sliver of momentary pleasure from that little bit of honey.

422
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:39,100
Alluring Ghost, you are actually helping an outsider to block me!

423
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:41,350
Cut the crap!

424
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:04,170
After so many years, this is the first time that I see your true face.

425
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,800
Get lost!

426

If My Lord does not betray me, I won't betray My Lord.

00:29:13,910 --> 00:29:16,660
If My Lord doesn't betray me...

428
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:19,250
Master, hurry and run!

429
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:22,250
This crazy woman has gone mad again.

430
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:26,550
Alluring Ghost, what were you thinking?

431
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:30,520
You would rather hide here and stay with that old dog Yu Qiufeng

432
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:33,260
than come to me for help.

433
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,610
Not bad. You are not as terrible as I had imagined.

434
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:50,490
If you dare to touch me, Chief will surely cut you into thousands of pieces.

435
00:29:55,830 --> 00:30:00,260
You are a really silly and stupid woman.

436

Scorpion King, why are you here?

442
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:20,990
Who are you to ask me this question?

443
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:23,130
Where is Yu Qiufeng?

444
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:28,530
Who are these two women?

445
00:30:28,530 --> 00:30:32,490
This one... She is the famous Alluring Ghost.

446
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:35,500
Her lover, the sect leader, abandoned her

447
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,690
and ran away by himself.

448
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,990
Alluring Ghost?

449
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:45,900
Tragicomic Ghost's underling, the Alluring Ghost who ranked the last

450
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,390
among the Top Ten Evil Ghosts?

451
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,520
My goodness.

452
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:53,560
So you are Alluring Ghost?

453
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,910
I pride myself on being an unmatchable beauty.

454
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,760
I heard that Alluring Ghost is the top beauty in the martial arts world,

455
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,910
except that she is blind and has a useless brain.

456
00:31:05,910 --> 00:31:08,260
I've always wanted to see for myself.

457
00:31:10,730 --> 00:31:12,790
Miss Green Demon,

458
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:15,820
your reputation exceeds your true face.

459
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:19,320
Look at this pitiful appearance.

460
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,010
On the one hand, it makes my heart restless,

461
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:25,090
but on the other hand, it makes me speechless.

462
00:31:25,090 --> 00:31:28,500
With a face like that, why is she known as a beauty?

463
00:31:29,690 --> 00:31:33,520
Do you think everyone is born beautiful like me?

464
00:31:34,090 --> 00:31:36,470
She has a highly-skilled master.

465
00:31:36,470 --> 00:31:39,890
These little wounds and scars mean nothing to her.

466
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:42,460
Even if she puts makeup on to become the moon goddess Chang'e,

467
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:45,070
it still works.

468
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:48,250
This is her master,

469
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:51,490
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful, Tragicomic Ghost.

470
00:31:51,490 --> 00:31:54,070
Too bad, she has already gone mad.

471
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:55,550
She's no longer of any use.

472
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:59,420
Beloved Jing! Beloved Jing, where are you? Beloved Jing?

00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,480
I didn't expect that you, Scorpion King, would have such an unusual taste

477
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,730
at such a young age.

478
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:18,780
Would you really lust so much over such an insane woman?

479
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:31,920
- What is it? Are you afraid now?
- Beloved Jing... Beloved Jing.

480
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,670
Scorpion King, Lustful Ghost deserved to die. He was the one who offended you.

481
00:32:36,670 --> 00:32:40,000
We were dispatched by Zhao Jing, Alliance Leader Zhao.

482
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,070
Beloved Jing?

483
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:49,730
Beloved Jing, you've come!

484
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:51,590
Beloved Jing, where are you?

485
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,860
Where are you? Beloved Jing?

486
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:56,990
- Where are you?
- Master.

487
00:32:56,990 --> 00:32:59,830
Beloved Jing! Beloved Jing, where are you?

488
00:32:59,830 --> 00:33:02,930
I beg you. I beg you to spare her.

489
00:33:02,930 --> 00:33:04,830
She has already gone mad.

490
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,550
Please be merciful and spare her.

491
00:33:23,150 --> 00:33:25,200
Beg me again.

492
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,100
I beg you! I beg you!

493
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,900
Let her go... Let her go.

494
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,600
Stop!

495
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Stop!

496
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:48,400
This useless bastard showed up on his own!

497
00:33:50,600 --> 00:33:52,400
Let her go.

498
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,000
Why?

499
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:56,900
A piece of Glazed Armor.

500
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,800
Let her go first!

501
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,800
I'll take you to get it.

502
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:08,200
Qianqiao! Qianqiao!

503
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,900
Qianqiao...

504
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:18,400
Qianqiao, I'm sorry.

505
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:21,800
I, Yu Qiufeng, am a lowly bastard who is afraid of death.

506
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,610
I chose to run away in the face of disaster.

507
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,000
Qianqiao.

508
00:34:29,000 --> 00:34:32,800
I'm back and I'm not leaving.

509
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,400
All right, all right! Stop blabbering.

510
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,600
No matter how sweetly you talk,

511
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:52,800
you still won't be able to wash away your great reputation as the most unfaithful lover in the world.

512
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,000
What does that mean?

513
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,200
My King, you may be unaware of this,

514
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:02,600
but this little woman has the nickname of "Green Demon."

515
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,800
She has quite the reputation for her beauty in the martial arts world,

516
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:08,200
but it's too bad. She's blind.

517
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:11,200
She was tricked into the hands of Yu Qiufeng,

518
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,300
but who knew?

519
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:19,600
Yu Qiufeng's wife is well known for her jealousy.

520
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,600
She caught this little woman and stripped her of her clothes.

521
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:27,900
She put her naked body on display, parading the streets of Mount Hua

522
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:30,100
all the way to Chang'an.

523
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:35,200
This was quite a shocking event at the time.

524
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:39,200
The funny thing is that from the beginning until the end,

525
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,800
her dog of a lover

526
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:46,200
did not make the slightest noise of protest.

527
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,200
Therefore, she couldn't find a place herself in the martial arts world.

528
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:52,100
Later, I heard she went to Ghost Valley.

529
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:54,400
As for Yu Qiufeng,

530
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:58,740
I hear that he found a new lover. Turns out it's still her!

531
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:05,500
Sister, I think not only is your face ruined,

532
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:08,000
your brain got ruined with it. Right?

533
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:11,100
I was the one with insincere intentions.

534
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:18,000
His Glazed Armor is fake.

535
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,500
At the time, I only wanted to use him to rescue my master.

536
00:36:21,500 --> 00:36:23,600
But I never thought...

537
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:27,600
Entangling with him for half my life was worthwhile.

538
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:31,600
Beloved Feng, you're allowed to deceive me,

539
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,400
but am I not allowed to deceive you?

540
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:45,600
Please let go of my master.

541
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:50,000
I am willing to be a slave for your goals.

542
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,400
How come that demon woman who used to be wild and untamable

543
00:37:01,800 --> 00:37:04,800
has become an idiot now?

544
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:09,400
She's suffering from her soul leaving her body, and she also drank the Water of Oblivion.

545
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:13,200
Her mind is clouded and her memories are muddled.

546
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,400
She is already useless.

547
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,600
Water of Oblivion?

548
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:23,400
It's the soup that everyone willing to enter Ghost Valley must drink.

549
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:27,000
It can make you forget what you long the most for.

550
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:31,800
Malicious Bodhisattva,

551
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,200
take these two women back to the Venomous Scorpion hideout.

552
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:39,700
Make sure to do so subtly. You must not let anyone notice you.

553
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,600
Why....

554
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,700
If My Lord does not betray me,

555
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,800
I will not betray My Lord.

556
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:54,200
[Tea-Water]

557
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:01,200
Master, the food is ready.

558
00:38:03,660 --> 00:38:06,880
Chengling, you seem to have grown taller

559
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,920
since the time at Lake Tai.

560
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:16,400
Master, thank you.

561
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:17,800
What are you thanking me for?

562
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,300
It seems like ever since you met me,

563
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,900
you've always been running all over the place for me.

564
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,100
Don't feel sorry for him!

565
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,560
Your master is the incarnation of Bodhisattva,

566
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:30,800
destined to help and save others.

567
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:35,200
Doesn't he have to save people in disaster all over the place?

568
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:37,400
Are you already drunk in the middle of the day?

569
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,600
Waiter! Come!

570
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,600
Here! Here!

571
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,600
Get my brothers some water to drink!

572
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,200
Come, Young Warrior. I'll go get some more.

573
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,000
I still have a bit of livelihood left.

574
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,200
Waiter.

575
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,600
We'll never be done with you!

576
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,600
Who are they? Why are they all injured?

577
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,400
Customer, those are warriors from the Immortal Dawn Sect.

578
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,800
Two days ago, the Immortal Dawn Sect was burned down.

579
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,800
I heard even the sect leader, Great Warrior Bai, has died.

580
00:39:03,800 --> 00:39:05,200
What an evil sin...

581
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:09,200
What Ghost Valley? Just the name is quite scary.

582
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,200
How is it, Zhou Boddhisattva?

583
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:15,000
Do you want to vanquish all of those demons in anger?

584
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:33,400
How disgusting. It smells burnt.

585
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:37,900
Immortal Dawn Sect's runaway soldiers didn't even know to clean up the bodies of their brothers and sisters.

586
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:41,600
Ghost Valley is too savage!

587
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:44,100
They are only bullying righteous sects without a leader.

588
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:49,400
Too bad. Leader Bai performed acts of justice for thirty years.

589
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,000
Do you think if we had gotten here a couple of days later, we could've—

590
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:55,400
We could've what? I think we'd just be giving Ghost Valley two free heads.

591
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,100
Although my abilities are limited, the Immortal Dawn Sect and the Gentle Word Sword Sect are allies.

592
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,400
How can I selfishly live and be afraid of death?

593
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:04,000
A'Xiang, walk slower!

594
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,000
Chengling, are you okay?

595
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:14,200
I'm fine, Master.

596
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:18,200
I'm just... still not used to seeing dead people.

597
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:22,400
Bodhisattva Zhou, weren't we going to go back to Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

598
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,600
What does Immortal Dawn Sect's misfortune have to do with us?

599
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,700
Chengling,

600
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:31,000
drink some more water to wash it down.

601
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,400
Old Wen, come with me.

602
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,800
A'Xu, are you a crow in a person's body?

603
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:50,600
How come wherever you go, people die?

604
00:40:50,600 --> 00:40:52,900
In my opinion, you're the one with the depressing aura.

605
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,400
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

606
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,600
I heard

607
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,600
that once upon a time there was an owl that overturned a bowl of red water in a villager's hand.

608
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,200
Dozens of people in that village died one after another.

609
00:41:03,200 --> 00:41:06,600
A'Xu, in my opinion, your ability to bring disaster

610
00:41:06,600 --> 00:41:08,800
is equal with that owl.

611
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:12,400
Don't change the topic. The corpses of the Immortal Dawn Sect

612
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,800
either had their throats cut or died immediately.

613
00:41:15,800 --> 00:41:20,400
Their deaths were obviously done by professional assassins.

614
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
So?

615
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:27,200
If someone used Ghost Valley's name to get rid of their rivals

616
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,400
and then framed it on Ghost Valley, what is their goal?

617
00:41:31,400 --> 00:41:34,000
Of course, it is to benefit themselves.

618
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,600
Before the Heroes Conference,

619
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:39,600
I believed Gao Chong to be the mastermind.

620
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,600
Now, it seems

621
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:46,700
that there is another cunning mastermind in the Five Lakes Alliance.

622
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,800
Those two, Shen and Zhao. One pretends to be stupid while the other pretends to be weak.

623
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,000
I doubt either of them is guilt-free.

624
00:41:53,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Gao Chong's fate was completely caused by his brother.

625
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:59,400
No matter which one set up his trap,

626
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,300
the other one is definitely not anything good either.

627
00:42:02,300 --> 00:42:05,200
They're both traitorous, savage, and unfaithful villains.

628
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,900
It doesn't matter who attacks who first.

629
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:12,000
If Shen and Zhao were both traitors, then whatever.

630
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,000
But if one is faithful, while the other is a traitor,

631
00:42:15,000 --> 00:42:17,200
we will be hurting innocent people.

632
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,000
Innocent?

633
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:22,800
Here you go again. Who is innocent?

634
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,600
Whatever. Weren't we going to go to Four Seasons Mountain Villa? Why are we speaking of this nonsense?

635
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:27,800
Let's go.

636
00:42:27,800 --> 00:42:31,200
Master!

637
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:17,990
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

638
00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:25,300
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

639
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:33,180
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

640
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:41,800
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

641
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:48,800
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

642
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:56,400
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

643
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:03,800
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

644
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:11,600
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

645
00:44:11,600 --> 00:44:18,800
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

646
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:26,800
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

647
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:34,000
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

648
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:41,000
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

649
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:49,000
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
