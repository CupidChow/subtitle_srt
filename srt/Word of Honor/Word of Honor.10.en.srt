148

he entrusted Ao Laizi with the Glazed Armor.

155
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:50,909
We should comply with his last wish.

156

After all, we should respect the dead.

157
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:54,030
We can't force someone to do things they don't want.

00:13:05,590 --> 00:13:08,150
to take over his belongings and disciples.

164
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,490
What does it have to do with an outsider like Ao Laizi?

165
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,829
He is incapable,

166
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:13,389
yet he insists on getting involved in our Five Lakes Alliance's matters!

167
00:13:13,390 --> 00:13:14,190
Fifth Brother!

168
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,070
From what you're saying,

169
00:13:17,270 --> 00:13:19,549
do you believe it's within your right to go and raise hell at Mount Tai Sect?

170
00:13:19,550 --> 00:13:22,010
Forcing them to come out and beg for help?

171
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,029
Causing Ao Laizi to die in a place far away from home?

172
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,750
What will the righteous people of the martial arts world

173
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,210
think of our Five Lakes Alliance?

174
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:34,170
It's not like I was the one who killed him.

175
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,429
We'll just avenge him, and then things will be fine.

176
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,789
Master, all the people from Renyi Hall
[Unfettered]

177
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:43,650
look down on our Mount Hua Sect.

178
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,950
I...

179
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,610
Such an insolent fellow!

180
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:54,150
What's the use in saying all of this?

181
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:56,149
Tell the disciples immediately

182
00:13:56,150 --> 00:13:58,189
that they must not participate in these kinds of matters ever again!

183
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:00,270
Report it to me immediately!

184
00:14:00,910 --> 00:14:03,849
You want to join the gathering of the world's greatest alliance

185
00:14:03,849 --> 00:14:05,189
and the world's greatest sect?

186
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,109
Are you trying to get killed?

187
00:14:07,110 --> 00:14:09,309
Master, what's the point in overestimating other sects

188
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,230
while underestimating our own prestige?

189
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:13,589
Back then, our Five Mount and Sword Sects...

190
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:15,730
The Five Mount and Sword Sects are all gone.

191
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,190
Ao Laizi has already passed on.

192
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,250
The Mount Tai Sect has also been destroyed.

193
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:24,029
Even if I have the ability to move Heaven and Earth,

194
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:27,510
how can I support the Five Mount and Sword Sects on my own?

195
00:14:29,230 --> 00:14:31,070
Please forgive me.

196
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,850
Enough.

197
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,190
Is there still no news from Tian Jie?

198
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:45,169
- No.
- Master!

199
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:48,149
Is there news about Tian Jie yet?

200
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:49,170
No.

201
00:14:49,170 --> 00:14:51,330
The senior brothers from the Mount Tai Sect are here looking for you.

202
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:53,849
- They said—
- What did they say?

203
00:14:53,849 --> 00:14:57,410
They said there is more to Master Ao Laizi's death.

204
00:14:57,410 --> 00:15:00,770
They said the Five Lakes Alliance did it.

205
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,020
Master, what shall we do?

206
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:10,840
Tell them I'm not here.

207
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:13,520
How... do I tell them that?

208
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,300
Say that I went out.

209
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,880
Say that I'm sick. Say that I'm dead!

210
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,179
I don't care what you say. I refuse to see them!

211
00:15:23,179 --> 00:15:25,279
- Yes, Master.
- Hurry up and go!

212
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,320
You leave too!

213
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,000
Yes, yes, yes.

214
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:35,220
Han Ying?

215
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,819
It's an eventful time for Yueyang City right now.

216
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,219
About yesterday's incident in Renyi Hall,

217
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:45,099
if the spy that the Window of Heaven assigned

218
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,260
hadn't been our confidant,

219
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:49,940
you'd have been exposed by now!

220
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,020
How is your injury? You—

221
00:16:53,460 --> 00:16:55,059
I've experienced ups and downs in the court

222
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:57,000
while disguised with an obscure face for so many years.

223
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,680
It's already been too long since I've left.

224
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:03,360
If I must continue to live in fear,

225
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,460
then why did I leave in the first place?

226
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:09,610
My Lord, you were the one who created the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns.

227
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,130
Is there really no cure?

228
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:15,129
There is the Miracle Healer Valley, Witch Doctor Valley, and the Western Regions.

229
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:17,199
The world is vast, there is surely a way.

230
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,760
How about I accompany you—

231
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,960
Enough.

232
00:17:20,850 --> 00:17:23,220
I've done too many evil deeds.

233
00:17:25,819 --> 00:17:29,119
The heavens wouldn't let me die this easily.

234
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,540
Han Ying,

235
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,440
when did you start to believe in gods and Buddhas?

236
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,580
I had no requests before,

237
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:47,860
thus I did not believe in them.

238
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:50,020
Now that I do have requests,

239
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:51,980
I have no choice but to believe in them.

240
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,900
The road that I have led you to walk on

241
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,680
is destined to never be blessed by the gods and Buddhas.

242
00:17:57,680 --> 00:18:03,220
My Lord, our only choices were either this road

243
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,200
or the road to death.

244
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:08,440
Any day we live is a day we gained.

245
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:13,500
I was lucky to have you take care of me last night.

246
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:17,820
Han Ying, the more interactions we have,

247
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,940
the more danger you'll find yourself in.

248
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:22,240
Lie low in the Window of Heaven.

249
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:24,580
Always remember to protect yourself.

250
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,100
I'm leaving.

251
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:34,619
My Lord! If there is anything troubling you,

252
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:36,900
if there's anything I can do to ease your burden,

253
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,780
I'll lay down my life without regret!

254
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:58,040
But... I already had the two pieces of Glazed Armor sent to Jinzhou.

255
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:01,280
Why do you... have another piece of it?

256
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,360
Two pieces?

257
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,739
Yes.

258
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,900
My subordinates found two identical pieces on the Nine-Clawed Fox,

259
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,340
Fang Buzhi.

260
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:10,160
It's very strange.

261
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,840
It's not strange. There are more.

262
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:19,540
It's likely that there are still many more of these imitations within the martial arts world.

263
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:24,780
I had been saying that the five pieces of Glazed Armor in the prince's drawing

264
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,420
were all various different designs, so how could two pieces be exactly the same?

265
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:33,000
Turns out... they are all imitations!

266
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:36,980
Old Wen did such a wicked thing that doesn't even benefit himself.

267
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,619
Why?

268
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,859
Who made these imitations?

269
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,940
They must be evil at heart!

270
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,640
Han Ying...

271
00:19:45,420 --> 00:19:49,059
The struggle to obtain the Glazed Armor will only get worse.

272
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:51,779
Just do what you're told, do not investigate any further.

273
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:54,140
Do not get involved no matter what.

274
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:56,819
My Lord, if you need me,

275
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:58,339
I'm willing to do anything

276
00:19:58,340 --> 00:19:59,860
to find the two lost pieces of the Glazed Armor!

277
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:01,299
Don't!

278
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:02,859
You'd be committing the crime of rebellion again His Highness!

279
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,139
When I first came to Window of Heaven,

280
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,460
I swore to stay loyal to you forever,

281
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,300
not to Prince Jin!

282
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:18,960
Now, I'm just a dying man.

283
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,540
What would I want such ominous things for?

284
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:27,780
You only need to remember my words.

285
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:29,660
Living a good life

286
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,980
is the best way for you to show loyalty to me.

287
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:36,760
The 81 people who founded the Window of Heaven with me

288
00:20:36,760 --> 00:20:39,020
have all been annihilated.

289
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,060
I do not wish to hear the words "My Lord" ever again.

290
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,760
But...

291
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:50,999
- Even if all your brothers are gone, there's still—
- Enough.

292
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,820
Perhaps my end is near.

293
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:04,470
These days, I often wonder

294
00:21:05,060 --> 00:21:09,520
if there really are gods and Buddhas, karma and retribution,

295
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,420
wouldn't I, with my blood-stained hands,

296
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:20,939
have to suffer in the deepest pits of hell for thousands of years?

297
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:29,200
Elder Huang, we got ourselves into real trouble this time!

298
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,800
Which rascal did it?

299
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,000
He created a fake Glazed Armor

300
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,400
and played us like a fiddle!

301
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,800
Old Woman, stop repeating yourself.

302
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,000
We are all angry.

303
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,800
Gao Chong wants to marry his daughter off to Zhang Chengling.

304
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Step down.

305
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:54,600
Once Gao Chong gets serious,

306
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,200
his brothers

307
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,000
and his own children and disciples

308
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:03,200
can all be made into his pawns.

309
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,200
What do you mean?

310
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,400
He wants to marry his own daughter

311
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,300
off to that little bastard by the surname of Zhang!

312
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This truly is a case of

313
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,400
being "unable to catch the wolf without giving up your daughter."

314
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,800
If he really does get controlled over that little bastard by the last name of Zhang,

315
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:28,400
no one from the outside will gain any benefit.

316
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:32,900
[Xiangzhu Hall]

317
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,200
- Great Warrior Gold Bean!
- Sister Xiang.

318
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,000
Silly boy, I've got something delicious!

319
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,700
I saw that practicing martial arts has strained you a lot,

320
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,800
so I bought you some nuts.

321
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:44,400
It'll nourish your body!

322
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,600
I'm fine, Sister Xiang.

323
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,200
I won't eat it, thank you.

324
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,500
Why?

325
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,700
Your Brother Cao

326
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:51,800
specially bought these Wolong nuts for me.

327
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,800
They are extremely delicious, and they're the most popular in the city!

328
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:55,500
The lines are so long for them, you know?

329
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,100
They're so flavorful! Come try them!

330
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,200
What's wrong?

331
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:13,700
What happened? Who bullied you?

332
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:16,400
Tell me! I'll break their legs!

333
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,900
Don't cry, you good-for-nothing Great Warrior Gold Bean.

334
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:28,600
You can't stop talking when I tell you to be quiet.

335
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,800
When you should be talking, you don't say anything.

336
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,600
It's all right.

337
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:32,600
If you can't beat them,

338
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,900
can't you just tattle on them?

339
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,900
Let's go and tattle on them.

340
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,600
Sister Xiang,

341
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:40,600
why do they hate me so much?

342
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:42,200
They said...

343
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
Silly boy, if you go and tattle on them,

344
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,600
Gao Chong and the others will definitely—

345
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,600
Miss Xiang, you two know each other?

346
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,000
Yes, Sister Xiaolian.

347
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:52,800
You didn't know?

348
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,800
We've known each other for a long time!

349
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,800
What can I do for you, Senior Sister Gao?

350
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:02,500
Wh-What happened to you?

351
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,200
Who bullied you?

352
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,600
They really went overboard!

353
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
Senior Sister Gao, no one bullied me.

354
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,899
I was practicing moves with your seniors and juniors.

355
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,200
My skills are poor, and I have nothing to say for myself.

356
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,600
Practicing what moves?

357
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:16,200
You've only just arrived here.

358
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,600
Your martial arts skills haven't even been practiced well enough!

359
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,700
I came at the wrong time.

360
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,400
You two must want to speak in private, don't you?

361
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:27,300
I'll be leaving now!

362
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,900
Miss Xiang gave this to you, didn't she?

363
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:42,300
Those are Wolong nuts.

364
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,400
If you like them, you can take them.

365
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,400
Miss Xiang is so kind to you.

366
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,200
These Wolong nuts are very popular in Yueyang City.

367
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,800
It's really hard to get them.

368
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:53,800
I was worried you wouldn't be used to our food,

369
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:56,000
so I especially asked someone to teach me how to make

370
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,500
these Yueyang-style osmanthus cakes

371
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,800
because they're your hometown specialty.

372
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,000
Thank you so much, Senior Sister Gao.

373
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
I feel very grateful for your kindness,

374
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,700
but it would be best if you took your gift back.

375
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,380
Chengling,

376
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,139
Father told me

377
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,620
to take extra care of you.

378
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,800
I'm grateful for Supreme Leader Gao and for your kindness.

379
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:23,300
Thank you.

380
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Chengling,

381
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,800
how come you keep calling me Senior Sister Gao today?

382
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:31,800
Why are you being so formal?

383
00:25:31,800 --> 00:25:34,000
Don't you usually call me—

384
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,600
Just as you said,

385
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,400
you and I used to call each other brother and sister,

386
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,600
and I bear no grudge against you.

387
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,200
Even though I'm still young,

388
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,200
I'm not a puppet that can be manipulated by others.

389
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:45,900
Supreme Leader Gao made arrangements for my marriage without my permission.

390
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,200
I didn't know about it. I do not have a good destiny,

391
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,700
and I'm afraid I do not deserve this blessing.

392
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,800
Brother Chengling—

393
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:55,300
Senior Sister Gao, you need not say more.

394
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:58,200
I know myself.

395
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,600
If I accept this marriage,

396
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,800
I'd be taking something that doesn't belong to me like a turtledove occupying a magpie's nest, and I'll become subject to the gossip of others.

397
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:10,000
I would feel too looked down upon.

398
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:26,500
What's wrong with you?

399
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:28,100
Is it wrong for her to treat you well?

400
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:30,500
I know Sister Xiaolian treats me well.

401
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,900
I'm just...

402
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:36,000
Fine, fine.

403
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,000
Don't be like this, Great Warrior Gold Bean.

404
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:46,000
Sister Xiang,

405
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:49,300
where are Master and Uncle Wen?

406
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,000
I don't know.

407
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,800
Why are you looking for them?

408
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,600
What?

409
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,700
You aren't happy living here?

410
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,700
I'm not living here.

411
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:06,900
It's house arrest.

412
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:20,900
The flowers exist throughout all four seasons,

413
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,300
knowing everything in the world.

414
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,700
Master.

415
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,100
What happened?

416
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,500
Something big.

417
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,500
Gao Chong wants his daughter to be married off to Zhang Chengling.

418
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:53,200
He's going all-in.

419
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,200
Yes.

420
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,200
That Gao Xiaolian

421
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:58,200
was originally lovers with Deng Kuan, the first disciple of the Yueyang Sect.

422
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,000
Although there was no promise of marriage yet,

423
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:02,400
everyone had already accepted it as a fact.

424
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,900
Once Gao Chong announced his decision,

425
00:28:03,900 --> 00:28:06,200
a lot of people began gossiping about it in private.

426
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,400
Right! That Deng Kuan,

427
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:12,400
the survivor of the last Tragicomic Wedding-Funeral Game,

428
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,400
returned to the Yueyang Sect a few days ago.

429
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,300
We don't know who hurt him and caused him to go unconscious.

430
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:19,700
You don't know who hurt him?

431
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:23,400
I was at the Tragicomic Wedding-Funeral Game that day.

432
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:26,200
Deng Kuan only suffered some surface wounds.

433
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
He should have recovered long ago.

434
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,000
It shouldn't have been bad enough to keep him unconscious all the way to now.

435
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,200
Was the corpse incident in the theater

436
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,800
Changing Ghost's work?

437
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:38,800
How much do you and Tragicomic Ghost know?

438
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,400
Not much. Is there anything wrong?

439
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:45,700
What did Zhang Chengling say?

440
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,700
If he marries Gao Chong's only daughter,

441
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,600
he'd be climbing the ladder of society quickly.
(T/N: Literally saying "carp leaping over the Dragon's Gate". In Chinese mythology, if a carp successfully swims up the waterfall and jumps over the Dragon Gate on top, it becomes a dragon.)

442
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,600
That kid usually seems very stupid,

443
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,700
but on this matter,

444
00:28:54,700 --> 00:28:56,600
he clearly knows what's going on.

445
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,800
That Gao Xiaolian was friendly around him many times,

446
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,600
but he always spoke bluntly toward her and showed no pretense of being kind.

447
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,300
Still, I think that Gao Chong was being way too obvious.

448
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:05,300
He's basically just keeping Chengling

449
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,400
arrested inside Yueyang Sect.

450
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:09,200
That place is heavily guarded all around.

451
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:12,200
He can't get out and outsiders cannot get in.

452
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,800
Master,

453
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,300
Chengling asked me if there's a way to get him out.

454
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,300
He misses you a lot.

455
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,600
Why?

456
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,600
It's nothing.

457
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,200
I just find him a bit pitiful.

458
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:41,400
You dare to criticize my plan?

459
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,400
I wouldn't dare.

460
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,500
Have you worn human skin for so long

461
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:48,000
that you've forgotten who you truly are?

462
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,600
Don't forget that you're Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

463
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,200
Humans and ghosts travel different roads.

464
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
You pity him.

465
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,900
Who will pity you?

466
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,379
Gao Chong is keeping such a close eye on Zhang Chengling.

467
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,800
That means that he must have something planned.

468
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,200
Watch him closely.

469
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
If anything happens,

470
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,200
report to me immediately.

471
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:17,000
A'Xiang,

472
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,600
do you think I'm insane?

473
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:28,000
Aren't you afraid that I will go insane someday

474
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,800
and kill you, too?

475
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,000
I'll follow you even if you go insane.

476
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:33,700
If you kill me,

477
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,900
I'll follow you even as a ghost.

478
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,900
Good.

479
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,300
In that case,

480
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,600
I shall stay insane till the end.

481
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,000
[Profound Expectations]

482
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,600
The Heroes Conference will be held soon.

483
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,600
Everyone, do your best.

484
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:56,600
Do not slack off.

485
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:57,900
Yes!

486
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:14,400
Eldest Brother, don't worry too much.

487
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,200
It's been quite peaceful lately.

488
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:17,800
There should be no problem.

489
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:21,600
Fifth Brother, you don't know.

490
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,600
The martial arts world seems peaceful on the surface,

491
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:27,200
but in fact, danger lurks everywhere.

492
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,000
Things are not that bad.

493
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,000
Right now,

494
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,800
heroes from all over the world have gathered in Yueyang City.

495
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Ghost Valley

496
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:36,100
wouldn't dare make trouble again.

497
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:38,300
Humans are unpredictable.

498
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:41,600
The Five Lakes Alliance has many enemies.

499
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,200
Ghost Valley isn't the only force

500
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,000
who wants to watch us fall.

501
00:31:58,000 --> 00:32:00,100
Father. Uncle Shen.

502
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:06,000
Seeing how troubled you both have been lately,

503
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,600
I specially made some lotus seed soup for you.

504
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Good girl.

505
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:14,500
Eldest Brother, having a daughter seems great.

506
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:18,400
We won't eat it.

507
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,600
Bring it to Chengling later.

508
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:26,400
Father, I...

509
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:29,000
don't want to do that anymore.

510
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,800
Do what?

511
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:34,000
Father.

512
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,800
Why did you betroth me to him

513
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:40,000
without even asking me first?

514
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,200
He is still a kid!

515
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,800
Children will grow up.

516
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:48,400
Your marriage has been decided in advance.

517
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:52,000
You can finalize the wedding in several years.

518
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,100
But he doesn't like me!

519
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:58,600
Parents should be the ones who decide on the marriages of their children.

520
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,700
How can a girl ask something like this

521
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:01,800
in front of her father?

522
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,600
You're shameless!

523
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,400
Eldest Brother,

524
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:07,800
don't get worked up so quickly.

525
00:33:07,800 --> 00:33:09,700
Let her finish speaking.

526
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:14,400
Father, you also know that I have my pride, too.

527
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,000
I listened to your orders

528
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,400
and repeatedly expressed my goodwill to Chengling,

529
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,800
but he shuts me out every time.

530
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,600
I know...

531
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:25,500
I've never done Chengling wrong!

532
00:33:25,500 --> 00:33:28,200
I don't understand why you're doing this to me,

533
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:31,700
and even more, I don't understand why Brother Chengling is treating me like this!

534
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,300
Enough. Don't bring it to him then.

535
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:39,000
I'll have someone send it to him.

536
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,400
Go.

537
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,600
Father!

538
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:43,200
Just go!

539
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,210
I'm in a really good mood today.

540
00:34:09,210 --> 00:34:10,799
Can I listen to a song?

541
00:34:10,799 --> 00:34:12,310
Sure, of course!

542
00:34:12,310 --> 00:34:13,480
Anything you want.

543
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:15,219
I'm only responsible for the bill.

544
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:17,579
Miss, come here.

545
00:34:17,580 --> 00:34:19,540
Sing me a song.

546
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:25,680
What song do I choose?

547
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,279
Which music house are you from?

548
00:34:28,279 --> 00:34:30,489
We are from Qing Yu Tower.

549
00:34:30,490 --> 00:34:32,770
Qing Yu Tower?

550
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,770
That's a good place.

551
00:34:35,590 --> 00:34:37,910
"Happy Meeting"! Do you know how to play it?

552
00:34:37,910 --> 00:34:39,040
Yes.

553
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:41,390
Madam, please tune the qin.

554
00:34:44,759 --> 00:34:47,180
"Happy Meeting?"

555
00:34:47,180 --> 00:34:53,500
Did A'Xiang pick this song in order to tell me something?

556
00:34:56,291 --> 00:34:59,930
[Roasted Fish]

557
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:07,171
[Qing Yu Tower]

558
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:16,420
Sister Qianqiao, the chief asks for you.

559
00:35:24,811 --> 00:35:28,971
[Luo Mansion]

560
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:33,960
You... Very good.

561
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,939
I allowed three ghosts of Mount Qingya to break the oath and exit the valley

562
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:44,899
in order to get you to catch the Hanged Ghost

563
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,300
and take back the Glazed Armor he stole.

564
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:53,680
As of right now, you haven't even been able to track down a hair on his head.

565
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:57,700
Instead, you caused quite a lot of trouble.

566
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,859
You organized three Tragicomic Weddings-Funerals,

567
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,939
annihilated the Danyang Sect,

568
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:08,600
destroyed the Mirror Lake Sect,

569
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,100
killed Mount Tai Sect's leader,

570
00:36:10,100 --> 00:36:12,800
and publicly threw corpses out to provoke the Five Lakes Alliance.

571
00:36:12,800 --> 00:36:14,360
In just three months,

572
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,060
you destroyed the peace that has been maintained

573
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:19,460
for twenty years between Ghost Valley and the Five Lakes Alliance.

574
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:22,580
Very good. Very good indeed.

575
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:25,460
Chief, forgive us for our crimes.

576
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,060
Crimes?

577
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:34,140
Do you think I'm being sarcastic?

578
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:36,680
I'm praising you.

579
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,139
Although you didn't do any proper business in these three months,

580
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,139
we are evil ghosts.

581
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,019
As evil ghosts, bringing disaster to the world is our job.

582
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:45,779
What crimes did you commit?

583
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:47,320
You did a beautiful job!

584
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,800
I'm even planning on rewarding you!

585
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,240
Get up.

586
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:02,920
I said, get up!

587
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,700
Come!

588
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:18,200
As for merit,

589
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:28,200
Tragicomic Ghost, were the Tragicomic Wedding-Funerals fun?

590
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:30,680
Wasn't it a great idea of mine?

591
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,359
Watching those fake things destroy their pretenses of friendship

592
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:39,000
and rip each other to shreds like crazy dogs

593
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,720
was even more fun than killing them yourself. Right?

594
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,280
You are wise, Chief.

595
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:50,139
The Danyang Sect shelters evil people and tolerates evil practices.

596
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:52,139
Lu Taichong deserves all the credit.

597
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:54,840
It's fine to kill all the disciples of the Danyang Sect,

598
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,859
but you caused Lu Taichong to die of anger.

599
00:37:56,860 --> 00:38:00,080
Originally, I wanted to keep him alive to deal with him slowly.

600
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:03,320
What a misstep.

601
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:05,980
This counts as negligence on your part.

602
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,960
I won't reward or punish you.

603
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,840
Do you accept it?

604
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:13,660
I do.

605
00:38:15,620 --> 00:38:17,140
Great.

606
00:38:17,860 --> 00:38:20,700
Let's talk about the second meritorious service.

607
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:24,740
Mirror Lake Sect's overnight annihilation.

608
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:29,060
Great job.

609
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:31,500
Who did this amazing thing?

610
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,120
He's absent?

611
00:38:39,020 --> 00:38:40,880
Then it can only be Long-tongued Ghost.

612
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:44,860
Changing Ghost, where is your subordinate?

613
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:48,500
Chief, ever since we left the valley,

614
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,360
Long-tongued Ghost no longer listens to my orders.

615
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:56,720
I believe that Long-tongued Ghost has already defected.

616
00:38:56,720 --> 00:39:01,360
As for the destruction of the Mirror Lake Sect,

617
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:05,000
it should indeed be Long-tongued Ghost's work.

618
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:09,620
I was unable to govern my subordinate.

619
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:13,860
Please bestow upon me the sin of incompetence.

620
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,840
Long-tongued Ghost wouldn't listen to you anymore?

621
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,580
That's nothing.

622
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:24,680
The rules of Ghost Valley dictate that the weak are the prey of the strong.

623
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,680
The able ones are the ones in charge.

624
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,780
If he has the ability to kill you,

625
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:32,640
I will make him the head of the Ten Devils.

626
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,460
If you have the ability to kill me,

627
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:38,520
I'll admire you even in death!

628
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:41,140
I wouldn't dare.

629
00:39:50,860 --> 00:39:52,540
You wouldn't dare?

630
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:55,060
That's funny.

631
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,500
The evil ghosts of Mount Qingya

632
00:39:57,500 --> 00:40:02,660
fight in life-and-death struggles every single day of the year.

633
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,820
If I had sat here with injuries today,

634
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:08,739
would you dare to say that you wouldn't kill me to replace me?

635
00:40:09,220 --> 00:40:10,940
Really, White Changing Ghost?

636
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,659
I wouldn't dare!

637
00:40:13,660 --> 00:40:15,779
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!

638
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:16,979
Ch-Chief!

639
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,500
I wouldn't dare! I wouldn't dare!

640
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:21,840
Stand up, everything's fine. Don't be afraid.

641
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:39,440
Chief.

642
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,939
Chief!

643
00:40:40,940 --> 00:40:43,600
Please have mercy, Chief!

644
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:46,940
Changing Ghost, he is your subordinate.

645
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:48,659
Do you think he deserves to die?

646
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:50,619
He doesn't deserve it! He doesn't!

647
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,120
Calm down, Chief! Calm down!

648
00:40:52,120 --> 00:40:53,939
Ghost Valley is in need of manpower!

649
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,840
Please, Chief!

650
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,420
You're right.

651
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:20,980
Ghost Valley is in need of manpower.

652
00:41:21,740 --> 00:41:26,320
The martial arts world is full of rotten people.

653
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:27,939
I want to use them, too.

654
00:41:27,940 --> 00:41:30,320
However, I am the chief of Ghost Valley.

655
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,420
Ghosts are the only ones I can use.

656
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,160
Isn't that right?

657
00:41:36,840 --> 00:41:38,640
Black Changing Ghost.

658
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:41,340
You are right, Chief.

659
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,820
Black Changing Ghost,

660
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:52,260
I turned your good brother into a ghost for no reason.

661
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,640
Do you feel resentful?

662
00:41:57,820 --> 00:42:00,120
Great kill, Chief.

663
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,600
How boring.

664
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:10,960
Come on! Let's talk about your merits for the time being.

665
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,800
Changing Ghost,

666
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:19,420
was it you who came up with the plan to throw out corpses in Yueyang City?

667
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,380
Yes.

668
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,600
Did anyone assist you?

669
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:32,240
I ordered my subordinates to do it.

670
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:36,740
I'm not too sure about the specific details.

671
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,320
I don't think there was any assistance from the outside.

672
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:43,220
Who did you send to handle this?

673
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:49,000
White Changing Ghost.

674
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:57,140
Well planned.

675
00:42:57,140 --> 00:43:01,100
Changing Ghost, you planned it too well.

676
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:07,980
White Changing Ghost was incompetent, and his crimes deserved far more punishment than death.

677
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:12,700
You helped me discard my subordinate.

678
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:16,180
Great kill.

679
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:19,080
Great kill.

680
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,599
Then, who killed Mount Tai Sect's leader?

681
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:27,360
Happy Ghost.

682
00:43:28,020 --> 00:43:31,800
Your signature marking was left behind on his face.

683
00:43:36,860 --> 00:43:37,819
Chief,

684
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:40,280
i-i-i-it wasn't me.

685
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:43,740
S-S-Someone set me up.

686
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,660
If it was really me,

687
00:43:47,660 --> 00:43:50,060
I'd never deny it.

688
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,960
Is it funny?

689
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,160
Chief, this is an old problem of mine.

690
00:44:01,220 --> 00:44:04,040
I-I-It's a breathing issue.

691
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:07,680
I can't speak without laughing.

692
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,040
Please have mercy, Chief.

693
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:13,980
It is quite funny.

694
00:44:15,060 --> 00:44:17,140
Seeing you guys so scared,

695
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:19,160
is of course funny.

696
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:22,340
However, it's only funny for a moment.

697
00:44:23,620 --> 00:44:25,740
We have to find some other ways to entertain ourselves.

698
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:30,400
The gathering of those righteous bastards is in two days.

699
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,840
Come, come. Speak freely.

700
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,540
We must devise a cunning plan

701
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,099
to utterly destroy the pride

702
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,140
of those three surviving lead dogs of the Five Lakes Alliance

703
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,480
so much that they can't reassemble it ever again.

704
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,280
That would truly be funny.

705
00:45:22,294 --> 00:45:28,124
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

706
00:45:29,914 --> 00:45:36,074
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

707
00:45:36,974 --> 00:45:44,084
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

708
00:45:44,084 --> 00:45:52,524
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

709
00:45:52,524 --> 00:45:59,564
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

710
00:45:59,564 --> 00:46:07,124
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

711
00:46:07,124 --> 00:46:11,264
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

712
00:46:11,264 --> 00:46:14,604
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

713
00:46:14,604 --> 00:46:22,494
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

714
00:46:22,494 --> 00:46:25,914
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

715
00:46:25,914 --> 00:46:29,614
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

716
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:37,624
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

717
00:46:37,624 --> 00:46:41,074
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

718
00:46:41,074 --> 00:46:44,864
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

719
00:46:44,864 --> 00:46:51,934
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫

720
00:46:51,934 --> 00:47:00,404
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫
