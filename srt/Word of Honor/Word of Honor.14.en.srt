I, for no reason, experienced the feeling of a woman getting harassed.

No wonder your pulse has almost disappeared, but you can still leap about.

Even if someone just died, as long as his body is still warm,

I am indeed a blind idiot.

107

Never mind.

That's enough. Enough.

114
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:45,458
All right. For my first step, I will abolish all of your martial arts and dissipate all of your internal force.

You should only have about a third of your power right now.

119

It's only hard to endure at night when your internal force is circulating about.

120
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:01,080
Once I remove the nails, your internal force

121
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:05,449
will completely crush all of your already dried-up meridians.

122

If I don't abolish your martial arts, you won't even be able to pass the first step.

for me to find a way to recover your martial arts!

158
00:11:55,620 --> 00:11:59,150
I would rather live freely for ten days

159
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,360
than live against my own will for ten years.

160
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:05,220
It's all right, there is still enough time.

161
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:08,240
Enough time for us to taste all of the wine in the world.

162
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,569
Let's go.

163
00:12:09,569 --> 00:12:11,170
I understand!

164
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:15,870
I naturally understand more than anyone.

165
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:21,930
I just think it's a bit funny.

166
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:27,620
When I was little, I often did not practice martial arts because I wanted to play.

167
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,790
My parents and I had many arguments.

168
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,430
My parents always said

169
00:12:33,430 --> 00:12:39,160
that if I didn't work hard in my youth, I would regret it when I became older.

170
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:43,620
Once I got older, it would be too late if I wanted to learn martial arts.

171
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:48,740
I would argue back that after I grew up,

172
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:54,560
it would also be too late to play with bird eggs and marbles.

173
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
Turns out that all of this time,

174
00:12:57,860 --> 00:13:00,230
in my life,

175
00:13:01,070 --> 00:13:06,690
was spent doing the wrong things at the wrong moment.

176
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:10,890
I couldn't play when I wanted to.

177
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,890
When I wanted to learn martial arts, I had no one to teach me.

178
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:19,480
I can't afford to have anything I want.

179
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:24,000
It's too late

180
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:29,260
to save who I want to save.

181
00:13:33,790 --> 00:13:38,180
Fortunately... Fortunately...

182
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,890
Wen Kexing, are you done yet?

183
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,790
I'm the one who's about to die!

184
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:49,630
I'm the one who lived a destitute life without accomplishment and turned myself into a joke!

185
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:52,880
Who are you putting this miserable and wretched act for?

186
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:56,360
I gave everything to win back this freedom.

187
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,960
Even if you're fucking persuading me

188
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:03,090
that it's better to drag out my death for a couple more years,

189
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,680
then getting to know you was pointless.

190
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:18,000
[Ziyun Hall]

191
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:39,419
Amethyst Fiend, how come you only got here just now?

192
00:14:39,419 --> 00:14:41,979
I went to Aunt Luo's manor as soon as I heard the news.

193
00:14:41,979 --> 00:14:44,909
I only saw the code phrase on my way back. What happened?

194
00:14:44,909 --> 00:14:46,850
How the hell would I know?

195
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:49,240
Asking you was pointless. Where's Sister Qianqiao?

196
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:51,210
I know even less about that.

197
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,920
Yun Zai.

198
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:10,150
Where's Hong Lu?

199
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:14,900
What about Zhuzhu?

200
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,789
Lan Xin? Everyone else?

201
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:21,700
Why are you asking? They're clearly gone.

202
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,660
That bastard Gao Chong brought a huge group of troops

203
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,520
to raid Crazy Old Woman's manor at night.

204
00:15:26,529 --> 00:15:28,169
Only Crazy Old Woman and I were here.

205
00:15:28,169 --> 00:15:31,760
Their raid caught us off guard, and a few maids died.

206
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:34,130
Damn it. Right, right, right!

207
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:37,799
That crazy old woman said that she would cut off a piece of my flesh for each person that died.

208
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:39,289
She wasn't being serious, was she?

209
00:15:39,289 --> 00:15:41,230
Hong Lu...

210
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,550
is dead?

211
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,460
She never killed anyone.

212
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,220
What right did they have to kill her?

213
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:57,880
I even promised Master

214
00:15:59,070 --> 00:16:01,690
that I would keep you all safe.

215
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:07,660
You're so noisy! Is this the time to be mourning?

216
00:16:07,660 --> 00:16:09,670
I mean, Amethyst Fiend, look at you.

217
00:16:09,670 --> 00:16:11,320
Did you get too affected by the humans?
(T/N: Literally, "did you breathe too much human air?")

218
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:13,079
You even seem to have become dumb.

219
00:16:13,079 --> 00:16:16,149
Didn't we spend our days fighting against humans in the past?

220
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:17,729
Who cares if a few maids died?

221
00:16:17,729 --> 00:16:21,479
Shut up! You don't have the right to scold me!

222
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,999
The Department of the Unfaithful has always lived away from the world.

223
00:16:24,999 --> 00:16:26,949
How would the manor attract the attention of those righteous dogs?

224
00:16:26,949 --> 00:16:28,729
Did you cause trouble out there and lead them here?

225
00:16:28,729 --> 00:16:30,330
Bullshit!

226
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:32,629
Don't always put the blame on people who do all of the work, okay?

227
00:16:32,629 --> 00:16:34,979
What does this have to do with me? Think about it.

228
00:16:34,979 --> 00:16:37,929
Changing Ghost, Happy Ghost, and Lustful Ghost were all nearby at the time.

229
00:16:37,929 --> 00:16:42,210
They didn't do a damn thing! If I hadn't helped out in time...

230
00:16:43,789 --> 00:16:48,930
Perhaps it was those bastards who sold out the Department of the Unfaithful.

231
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:54,110
Master!

232
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:59,180
Master! Master.

233
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:01,330
Master, what happened to you?

234
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:06,100
The wind and rain darken the sky.

235
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:09,180
The cock does not stop crowing.

236
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:12,000
Yet when I meet the righteous gentleman,

237
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:17,590
how come I do not feel happy?
(T/N: The Wind and the Rain, Book of Songs)

238
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,129
Master, what happened?

239
00:18:19,129 --> 00:18:22,750
Aunt Luo's manor was raided by the Five Lakes Alliance.

240
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,309
Many of our sisters died.

241
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:27,429
Hong Lu died too.

242
00:18:27,429 --> 00:18:29,719
Aunt Luo couldn't defeat them and was captured.

243
00:18:29,719 --> 00:18:34,010
Master, wake up and tell me what to do!

244
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,460
Why are you crying?

245
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,540
I'm not even crying, so why are you?

246
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,040
Are you crying for me?

247
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:50,910
Master! Did you hear what I said? Master!

248
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,570
A'Xiang,

249
00:19:06,570 --> 00:19:08,710
he's about to die.

250
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,370
He can't live for very long.

251
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,629
I plotted my revenge for so long and am going to enact it.

252
00:19:15,629 --> 00:19:17,960
Life was finally about to light up,

253
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:21,480
but he's about to die.

254
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,810
If I knew that earlier,

255
00:19:24,490 --> 00:19:27,090
why did I even follow him, to begin with?

256
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:31,710
Wh-Who is about to die?

257
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:36,610
Zhou Xu?

258
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,480
The presence of autumn is confirmed by the cold rain.

259
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,730
The green Chinese parasol tree dies of old age.
(T/N: The Chinese parasol tree is a symbol of loyal love)

260
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:52,660
The blanket is too thin for the cold night.

261
00:19:53,710 --> 00:19:55,989
Time slips away, squandered.

262
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:58,850
I want to be with you through life and death,

263
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:05,410
but what a pity that we met so late.

264
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:21,609
I am young and naive and don't yet understand the ways of the world.
[Great Wisdom]

265
00:20:21,609 --> 00:20:26,020
Mount Hua Sect is part of the Five Mount and Sword Alliance, but...

266
00:20:27,010 --> 00:20:29,520
Fortunately, you are willing to support our Mount Tai Sect.

267
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,860
Please get up.

268
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,690
You... You can't do this.

269
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:38,919
Qing Song, now that you are the leader of the Mount Tai Sect,

270
00:20:38,919 --> 00:20:42,769
how could I have you treat me so courteously?

271
00:20:42,769 --> 00:20:46,729
Defeating evil is the duty of the Beggar Gangs.

272
00:20:46,729 --> 00:20:48,579
It's not worth thanking.

273
00:20:48,579 --> 00:20:51,149
Senior Ao Laizi was noble and righteous.

274
00:20:51,149 --> 00:20:53,939
No one in the martial arts world did not revere him.

275
00:20:53,939 --> 00:20:58,610
The sudden death of such a godlike person like him

276
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:02,530
is truly... truly a pity.

277
00:21:02,530 --> 00:21:07,130
All of us are willing to die for our master.

278
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:11,560
As long as we can bring justice to him, I will do whatever it takes!

279
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:14,920
Elder Huang, we will follow your orders completely!

280
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:18,549
The Beggar Gangs and the Mount Tai Sect share the same motivations.

281
00:21:18,549 --> 00:21:23,059
If the Five Lakes Alliance is truly deceiving the world with their righteous reputation

282
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:26,179
and harboring such evil intentions, then no matter how dangerous it is,

283
00:21:26,179 --> 00:21:29,950
the Beggar Gangs will still do whatever it takes to defeat them.

284
00:21:29,950 --> 00:21:31,470
Fear not.

285
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:35,310
Now, the sky has cleared after the storm,

286
00:21:35,319 --> 00:21:37,769
so it is the perfect time to bring justice to light.

287
00:21:37,769 --> 00:21:40,610
Say what you need to say and do what you need to do.

288
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,330
Rest assured.

289
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:46,260
The Beggar Gangs' thousands of disciples and the righteous spirit of the martial arts world

290
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,400
are on your side.

291
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,250
Thank you, Elder.

292
00:21:50,950 --> 00:21:52,339
I will leave now.

293
00:21:52,339 --> 00:21:55,550
Goodbye. Please.

294
00:22:16,270 --> 00:22:19,959
Huang He, what are you planning now?

295
00:22:19,959 --> 00:22:23,439
Since you found such huge leverage over Gao Chong and Shen Shen,

296
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,329
why not make a move now?

297
00:22:25,329 --> 00:22:27,610
What's the rush?

298
00:22:27,610 --> 00:22:29,840
We've already waited for so many years.

299
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:33,380
Does this short time make a difference?

300
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:39,540
Torturing a person is like roasting a chicken.

301
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:42,680
You can't rush.

302
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:47,770
It tastes best when it's been roasted for a long enough.

303
00:22:48,350 --> 00:22:51,660
I will take care of the next public steps.

304
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,730
Aside from that, there's one more thing

305
00:22:53,730 --> 00:22:59,750
I need you two to cooperate with me with.

306
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,210
Junior Master Zhao.

307
00:23:13,210 --> 00:23:14,780
Open the door.

308
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:17,911
Master, please.

309
00:23:17,911 --> 00:23:21,732
[Prison]

310
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:29,009
Junior Master Zhao, this terrible woman is so tight-lipped.

311
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:30,810
She isn't willing to leak anything.

312
00:23:30,810 --> 00:23:33,389
Master said that she is a woman after all,

313
00:23:33,389 --> 00:23:34,849
so he won't let us interrogate her through torture.

314
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:36,849
Who cares if an evil ghost is male or female?

315
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:40,030
Junior Master, I won't tell anyone, so go ahead and do whatever you need to do.

Come at me with all the tricks you have!

330
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:40,510
I've always heard that before a person enters Ghost Valley,

331
00:24:40,510 --> 00:24:45,180
they must first swallow the Water of Oblivion to forget their cares

332
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:50,100
and let go of their wretches and obsessions.

333

How do you know my name?

339
00:25:21,150 --> 00:25:25,000
Fumeng, I let you down

340
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,970
and dropped you from a noble girl

341
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:30,720
into a female ghost,

342
00:25:31,920 --> 00:25:35,600

343

Do you have any other orders?

353
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:15,450
The Department of the Unfaithful's side manor was attacked by the Five Lakes Alliance yesterday.

354
00:27:15,450 --> 00:27:17,980
Tragicomic Ghost was captured alive.

355
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:21,060
Captured?

356
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,710

357
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:26,150
What should we do?

358
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,519
Chief, you must rescue her quickly.

359
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,389
With her personality, if she is captured by the Five Lakes Alliance—

360
00:27:32,389 --> 00:27:34,670
Stop talking nonsense.

361
00:27:34,670 --> 00:27:37,560
It's not the right time to fight yet.

I want you to transform into Yu Qiufeng's face and poke around.

If I guessed correctly,

364
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:46,129
Gao Chong won't kill her just yet.

365
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,030
He will leave her alive until the Heroes Conference,

366
00:27:49,030 --> 00:27:51,620
where he will execute her in public.

367
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:53,279
Yes.

368
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:56,800
Apologies. I was anxious in the moment and overstepped.

369
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,870
Chief, do you want me to break into prison?

370
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:03,790
Break into the prison?

371
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:06,930
Is that your job?

372
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:08,510
Considering your martial arts,

373
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:11,770
would you be able to get out of the Yueyang Sect in one piece?

374
00:28:11,770 --> 00:28:15,230
I want you to confirm that Tragicomic Ghost is still alive.

375

Don't alert the enemy.

376
00:28:17,410 --> 00:28:20,769
But, Chief, we need to rescue her as soon as possible.

The closer we get to the Heroes Conference, the more masters will enter Yueyang Sect—

Do I need you to teach me how to do things?

379

Rest assured. I have a plan.

380
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,340
During the Heroes Conference,

381

480
00:34:02,959 --> 00:34:06,259
Unfortunately, Junior Master Shen just left to inspect the venue for the Heroes Conference.

481
00:34:06,259 --> 00:34:07,829
He won't be back for a while.

482
00:34:07,829 --> 00:34:10,069
Leader Yu, why don't you come back in the afternoon?

483
00:34:10,069 --> 00:34:13,350
No worries, I'll wait for him inside.

484
00:34:14,130 --> 00:34:16,070
May I ask for a cup of clear tea?

485
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,810
Senior Brother!

486
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,869
Hurry up and go to the conference venue to help. Ghost Valley is attacking.

487
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:22,269
Go and tell Master!

488
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:23,479
What? Let's go!

489
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,280
Come with me.

490
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:36,609
Why did those of Ghost Valley suddenly go to the site at the Heroes Conference?
[Diecui Pavilion]

491
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:38,670
Is this Chief's plan?

492
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,070
No wonder why most of the Yueyang Sect left for the venue.

493
00:34:42,070 --> 00:34:46,520
This is a rare opportunity. I must rush to rescue my master.

494
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,540
Beloved Feng.

495
00:34:58,540 --> 00:35:00,580
Qianqiao?

496
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:04,769
Qianqiao, why are you here?

497
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:08,439
Wait. Why did you transform into my likeness? What are you doing?

498
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:13,380
Beloved Feng, then how come you took advantage of the Yueyang Sect's low security

499
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,470
to walk around in the backyard?

500
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:19,100
Do you also want to follow your son's steps

501
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,260
to look for the Glazed Armor?

502
00:35:25,140 --> 00:35:28,950
If you want the Glazed Armor, why not ask me?

503
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:34,239
What? My Ghost Valley can't have what the Five Lakes Alliance has?

504
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:37,329
Qianqiao, what do you mean by this?

505
00:35:37,329 --> 00:35:39,420
I'll be straightforward.

506
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:42,519
My master, Tragicomic Ghost, has been captured by the Five Lakes Alliance

507
00:35:42,519 --> 00:35:44,810
and is locked in the Yueyang Sect's prison.

508
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,190
I can't rescue her alone.

509
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,200
If you're willing to help me rescue my master,

510
00:35:48,209 --> 00:35:51,680
this piece of Glazed Armor will be yours.

511
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,780
You mean your master is the Owner of the List of the Unfaithful,

512
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,710
Tragicomic Ghost?

513
00:35:56,710 --> 00:35:58,320
That's right.

514
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:02,420
The feelings of men are fleeting while the lives of women are fleeting.

515
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,970
Who did you think rescued me and brought me into Ghost Valley?

516
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:09,450
What?

517
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:12,890
Are you unwilling to help, Leader Yu?

518
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,900
Quickly, put this away.

519
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:31,520
Qianqiao, I owe you too much.

520
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:34,450
I told you. As long as you ask,

521
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:38,109
no matter what your request is, even if I, Yu Qiufeng, must risk my life

522
00:36:38,109 --> 00:36:42,280
and degrade my honor, I will fulfill this promise.

523
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:46,250
If you want to rescue her, I will help you rescue her.

524
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,770
But as the leader of the Mount Hua Sect, I can't take action rashly.

525
00:36:51,770 --> 00:36:55,179
Qianqiao, take off your makeup first and come with me.

526
00:36:55,179 --> 00:36:58,210
I know where the Yueyang Sect's prison is.

527
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,699
I will kill whoever dares to continue defiling the Five Lakes Monument!

528
00:37:06,699 --> 00:37:07,889
We're here to hit you!

529
00:37:07,889 --> 00:37:10,090
To hit you!

530
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,549
How dare you?

531
00:37:13,549 --> 00:37:15,280
Shen Shen!

532
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:18,079
It's you.

533
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,119
You were the one who sent an assassin to kill the leader of the Mount Tai Sect, Ao Laizi,

534
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,869
in order to steal the Glazed Armor.

535
00:37:23,869 --> 00:37:26,939
Are you still not willing to admit your guilt?

536
00:37:26,939 --> 00:37:29,869
Ao Laizi was killed by Ghost Valley. What does that have to do with me?

537
00:37:29,869 --> 00:37:32,140
You told them to!

538
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,359
That person said so himself. He was following your orders!

539
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,609
Master!
[Liquor Store of Hu]

540
00:37:37,609 --> 00:37:41,310
Master!

541
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,480
Who are you?

542
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,100
I...

543
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:04,420
am here on orders from the leader of the Mount Dagu Sect, Shen Shen,

544
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:08,630
to kill all of you.

545
00:38:08,630 --> 00:38:10,759
I'm going to kill you!

546
00:38:10,759 --> 00:38:13,240
- I'm going to kill you!
- Qing Hua!

547
00:38:14,350 --> 00:38:17,280
Qing Hua!

548
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:26,469
I luckily survived and escaped back to Mount Tai.

549
00:38:26,469 --> 00:38:29,460
I found out on the way that my seniors

550
00:38:29,460 --> 00:38:32,170
died that night, too.

551
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,790
The eyewitness is here. Shen Shen, you criminal.

552
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:36,349
What else do you have to say?

553
00:38:36,349 --> 00:38:39,309
I am being framed! I didn't do it!

554
00:38:39,309 --> 00:38:43,620
Framed? You were the damned thief who attacked us first,

555
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:47,170
going to Mount Tai and forcing my master to escape overnight.

556
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:51,219
You chased him for miles, all the way from Mount Tai to Tai Lake.

557
00:38:51,219 --> 00:38:54,049
Chased? Why would I chase you?

558
00:38:54,049 --> 00:38:57,210
Obviously for my master's Glazed Armor!

559
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:00,420
What do you mean by your master's Glazed Armor?

560
00:39:00,420 --> 00:39:03,550
The Glazed Armor belongs to my Third Brother, Lu Taichong!

561
00:39:03,550 --> 00:39:05,750
Wait!

562
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,180
Did everyone hear that?

563
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,600
Shen Shen,

564
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:14,090
I'm glad you admitted guilt.

565
00:39:14,090 --> 00:39:19,499
You indeed attacked Ao Laizi so cruelly for the Glazed Armor.

566
00:39:19,499 --> 00:39:23,829
E-Elder Huang. Don't mix the two incidents together.
[Elder of Gentle Wind Sword Sect, Fan Huaikong]

567
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:27,049
There is a misunderstanding between the Five Lakes Alliance and the Mount Tai Sect,

568
00:39:27,049 --> 00:39:30,699
but why would Leader Shen kill one of his own?

569
00:39:30,699 --> 00:39:32,630
What misunderstanding?

570
00:39:32,630 --> 00:39:35,959
The Danyang Sect belongs to the Five Lakes Alliance.

571
00:39:35,959 --> 00:39:37,839
What right did that Old Man Ao have to get involved?

572
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:40,799
You killed my master and you're still blaming him?

573
00:39:40,799 --> 00:39:42,279
You must give us an explanation today!

574
00:39:42,279 --> 00:39:44,819
Right, give us an explanation!

575
00:39:44,819 --> 00:39:47,279
Everyone, listen to me.

576
00:39:47,279 --> 00:39:50,730
There's something odd about this young disciple's words.

577
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:53,660
Let me ask you. What kind of assassin

578
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:56,200
would expose which clan he comes from?

579
00:39:56,209 --> 00:40:01,880
That's why we'd best wait for Supreme Gao and then clear the air.

580
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:04,879
All right! Then tell Supreme Leader Gao to come out
[Leader of the Five Tigers Broken Knives Clan]

581
00:40:04,879 --> 00:40:06,419
and give everyone an explanation!

582
00:40:06,419 --> 00:40:08,219
Right, tell Gao Chong to come out!
[Leaders of the Giant Whale Gang and Flying Sand Gang]

583
00:40:08,219 --> 00:40:10,569
Tell him to come out!

584
00:40:10,569 --> 00:40:11,629
Give us an explanation!

585
00:40:11,629 --> 00:40:13,269
Tell him to come out!

586
00:40:13,269 --> 00:40:15,660
- I am here!
- Call him out!

587
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,180
Eldest Brother!

588
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:46,519
The main character is finally here.

589
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:49,210
As soon as one performance ends, another begins.

590
00:40:49,210 --> 00:40:51,750
How exciting.

591
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,980
The death of Senior Ao Laizi

592
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:01,239
must be blamed on the Five Lakes Alliance.

593
00:41:01,239 --> 00:41:05,730
You! Gao Chong, you admitted it?

594
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:09,139
Of course I do.
[Five Lakes Alliance]

595
00:41:09,139 --> 00:41:13,069
In the final analysis, Senior Ao Laizi died

596
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:15,849
because of my third brother's request.

597
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,640
This is loyalty!

598
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,180
I respect him very much!

599
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:25,519
"The iridescent clouds have scattered, and the Glaze has shattered."

600

"Who will cry with the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?"

601
00:41:30,610 --> 00:41:34,630
Let me see what kind of play you can all put on.

602
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:37,380
Don't disappoint me.

my duties taken care of ♫
