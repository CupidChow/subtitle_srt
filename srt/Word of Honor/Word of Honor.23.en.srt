[Word of Honor]

22
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,010
[Episode 23]

23
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:59,640
Uncle Shen, let me show you out.

24
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:06,660
Does your wound... from back then hurt?

25
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:10,610
It's nothing.

26
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:14,180
I owe the Wen family

27
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:18,300
much more than just this debt.

28
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:23,040
Then... where do you plan to go?

29
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,840
I at least have to find your Sister Xiaolian.

30
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,810
It's just that she's been gone for so long, I am worried that she...

31
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:29,920
That's impossible!

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,320
My master said Uncle Gao destroyed the Glazed Armor during the Heroes Conference

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,260
just to protect you.

34
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,320
The people who kidnapped Sister Xiaolian definitely won't hurt her!

35
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,960
I hope so.

36
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,090
My eldest brother has only a few kin.

37
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,720
If I can't even protect her...

38
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:59,180
Chengling, now that I've seen that you've become a disciple of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

39
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:01,440
I feel so happy for you.

40
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,950
We brothers owe the Wen family a deep debt.

41
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,550
You must be obedient and filial to your masters.

42
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:10,650
That will help us make up for some of the mistakes.

43
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,040
Uncle Shen, I understand.

44
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,200
If I find Xiaolian, I will take her to the Mount Dagu Sect.

45
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,930
However, if one day, I am no longer living,

46
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:28,070
no matter whether or not Xiaolian is your fiancee, can you look after her some?

47
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:31,240
If you can, take her to Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

48
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,960
She's a lone girl with no one to rely on. Will you?

49
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:38,730
All right. Even if you did not say so, I would still take care of Sister Xiaolian.

50
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:40,650
Good child.

51
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,500
I'm leaving now.

52
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,280
Take care.

53
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:51,490
[Li Residence]

54
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:15,620
He still hasn't woken yet?

55
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:24,970
A'Xiang, has Old Wen coughed up blood and fainted before?

56
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,660
No.

57
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:32,670
But when I was young, Master was often sick in bed.

58
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:35,070
After I grew up, it stopped happening.

59
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:39,270
Since when did you follow Old Wen?

60
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:43,640
I have been with Master for as long as I can remember.

61
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,400
Then...

62
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,520
when did he get there?

63
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,400
Get where?

64
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,880
It's nothing.

65
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,670
Little girl, go rest.

66
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:01,420
I'll look after him.

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,070
No, I'm going to stay with Master.

68
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:06,730
Then you aren't going to take care of

69
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,860
that Young Warrior Cao who isn't eating or drinking because he's staying with you?

70
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,100
Why should I care for him? Master is more important!

71
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:17,270
Good girl, go rest a bit.

72
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm here.

73
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,260
Fine, but if Master wakes up,

74
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:26,700
you have to let me know right away!

75
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:11,520
A'Xing was wrong. Chief, please punish me again.

76
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,240
That's right.

77
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:15,850
You must remember that this is the Ghost Valley.

78
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:19,960
Not valley as in mountain valley, but as in venomous parasite.
(T/N: Valley and venomous parasite are homophones)

79
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:23,350
Only the strongest king of the valley, who is venomous and cruel enough to destroy everything,

80
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:24,970
has the right to live.

81
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:27,590
In a place where tens of thousands of dark souls reside,

82
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,140
if I am to live, you must die.

83
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:37,000
Everyone is afraid of pain, but you are not.

84
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,120
Instead, you enjoy pain.

85
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,110
Then you will live, and they will die.

86
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:45,140
A'Xing, you entered the valley young.

87
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:47,080
Being able to live to today

88
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:50,950
and become the talent you are now was not an easy task.

89
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:56,070
I am teaching you only because I have high hopes for you.

90
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,180
A'Xing is thankful and will remember from the depths of my heart.

91
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,920
Good.

92
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,490
Whether or not you can become the next Thousand Venom King and Thousand Evil Chief,

93
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,320
will depend on your luck.

94
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,210
Old Wen, you're awake.

95
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,500
A'Xu.

96
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:43,960
You've been unconscious for a whole day and night.

97
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,360
Hurry and adjust your inner breath.

98
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,270
Your pulse is normal, so I didn't dare to give you any random medicine.

99
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,790
It's all right.

100
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:56,170
My inner breath flow might have just been interrupted.

101
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,180
Where's Shen Shen?

102
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,550
I've already driven him out.

103
00:08:03,090 --> 00:08:05,060
Why would you?

104
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,710
Although Shen Shen is an ignorant and selfish person,

105
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,360
he ultimately was tricked and does not deserve to die for that.

106
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,740
These years, those brothers have also been tortured by their consciences.

107
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,660
Conscience?

108
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:24,190
Zhou Zishu, do you think everyone has a conscience?

109
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,000
Since Shen Shen was shameless enough to ask where my parents were,

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,800
I should've sent him down there to see them!

111
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:34,480
Old Wen, in the end,

112
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,380
the sinner was the one who placed the poison, Zhao Jing.

113
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,400
Everyone else had their own difficulties.

114
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:42,030
Now you're telling me everyone has difficulties?

115
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,110
Did my parents not have difficulties?

116
00:08:44,110 --> 00:08:48,190
The difficulties of evil people are difficulties, but good people should just obediently accept death?

117
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:50,160
You can be the Bodhisattva if you want to!

118
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:55,050
I would rather be the chief of thousands of devils and stay in Hell forever than suffer silently like that!

119
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,740
Old Wen...

120
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,380
I'm sorry.

121
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:02,960
This was your own personal grudge, after all.

122
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,540
I shouldn't have decided for you.

123
00:09:08,810 --> 00:09:10,530
I'm sorry.

124
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:15,760
I just didn't want to see your hands get stained with fresh blood again.

125
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:24,660
Well, no matter.

126
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:27,530
If Shen Shen died by my hand,

127
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:29,760
that would give him the chance to atone for his sin with death.

128
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,900
That would be too cheap of a price.

129
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,940
Let him live well then! Let him watch the dogs in the Five Lakes Alliance.

130
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,640
Once you've fully recovered,

131
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,340
I'll go with you to take revenge on Zhao Jing.

132
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,160
I was fine, anyways. Just a little parched.

133
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,310
Hurry and serve me.

134
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:08,960
Do you need me to change it to wine for you?

135
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:22,220
If we're going, then we're going after you've fully recovered.

136
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,850
These Five Lake Alliance people are full of talk about righteousness and morals,

137
00:10:25,850 --> 00:10:30,110
but actually, easily betray others. Coincidentally, the position of leader of the alliance

138
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:33,880
fell into the hands of a heartless, ruthless bastard.

139
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,780
Doesn't this count as karma?

140
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:39,700
When I look at these dirty, rotten dogs biting each other,

141
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:42,420
it's even more satisfying than killing them myself.

142
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:44,830
Master!

143
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:49,270
Master, you scared me to death!

144
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,470
You're so noisy.

145
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:54,150
Master, how do you feel? Is your head still dizzy? Are you still hungry? Should I cook something for you?

146
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:56,740
I just think you're super noisy right now.

147
00:10:56,750 --> 00:11:00,200
You guys talk. I'll go see if Chengling finished making the food.

148
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,220
Master, you—

149
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:13,370
It's Water of Oblivion.

150
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,950
If My Lord does not betray me,

151
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,220
I will not betray My Lord.

152
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:23,010
Beloved Jing.

153
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:25,690
- Master.
- Beloved Jing!

154
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:30,030
- Master.
- Beloved Jing...

155
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:35,830
There are many people in this world named Zhao Jing.

156
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,500
Perhaps the Zhao Jing this crazy woman calls for is merely coincidental.

157
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:39,790
I'm not going...

158
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:45,080
But if it's really a misunderstanding, why did Father specifically order Lustful Ghost to kill her in order to shut her mouth?

159
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:47,370
Beloved Jing...

160
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:53,220
Beloved Jing... If My Lord does not betray me...

161
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:55,240
I will not betray My Lord.

162
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,910
Beloved Jing...

163
00:12:01,790 --> 00:12:04,160
What do you want to do?

164
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,440
What can you do?

165
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:11,710
I just want to check her pulse, that's all. Move aside.

166
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:17,460
Do you want me to butcher you as well?

167
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:34,140
She's become like this

168
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,770
because she drank the Water of Oblivion?

169
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:39,730
No.

170
00:12:39,730 --> 00:12:43,800
The Water of Oblivion will only make people forget what they are most obsessed about.

171
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,330
It won't damage their consciousness.

172
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:48,830
My master originally had an old illness.

173
00:12:48,830 --> 00:12:52,310
Perhaps someone agitated her Soul Leaving Illness,

174
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:54,240
which led to this.

175
00:13:01,190 --> 00:13:03,810
Forget what they obsess most about...

176
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,480
That means that what she wants to forget

177
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,490
is the person who failed her.

178
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:13,520
How do you heal this?

179
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,060
If My Lord doesn't betray me...

180
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,680
Forgive me, Scorpion King. I've never drunk the Water of Oblivion.

181
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,910
I didn't enter the Valley voluntarily.

182
00:13:23,910 --> 00:13:26,210
I had nowhere to go.

183
00:13:27,310 --> 00:13:30,160
When I wanted to commit suicide, it was Master who saved me

184
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,630
and took me back to Mount Qingya.

185
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:36,920
The chief took pity on me and allowed me to be an exception.

186
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:39,610
You are the one who should drink the Water of Oblivion the most! What exception?

187
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:42,070
Because I thought as long as I remembered everything,

188
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:44,340
I wouldn't make the same mistakes.

189
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:48,360
If you remember everything as you wished,

190
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,280
then why did you go back to Yu's side?

191
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:55,310
Scorpion King, have you ever seen those who are addicted to gambling?

192
00:13:56,090 --> 00:14:00,120
The more you gamble, the more you lose, but the more you lose, the more you gamble.

193
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,820
Giving your heart away

194
00:14:03,820 --> 00:14:06,270
is the greatest bet.

195
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:09,730
I bet on the wrong treasure.

196
00:14:09,730 --> 00:14:12,500
I thought I could happily lose my life for him,

197
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,670
but thanks to Master's help,

198
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:18,020
I lived some extra years as a partial human, a partial devil.

199
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:22,830
Actually, when Lustful Ghost came to kill her,

200
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:26,130
I thought I should block the attack for her.

201
00:14:26,130 --> 00:14:28,460
Might as well lose everything.

202
00:14:28,460 --> 00:14:30,950
But who expected that Heaven

203
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,390
would actually let me win a round?

204
00:14:35,970 --> 00:14:37,680
Silly idiot.

205
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:43,200
How did Ghost Valley

206
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:46,180
raise a human like you?

207
00:14:46,970 --> 00:14:48,710
Department of the Unfaithful.

208
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,600
Why is it called that?

209
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,320
Because Master previously said

210
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,590
since ancient times, men have been unfaithful while women have been unfortunate. (T/N: unfaithful is literally "poor in emotion" and unfortunate is literally "poor in luck")

211
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:03,190
She wants to uphold justice for all women who have been harmed by unfaithful men

212
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:06,190
and kill every traitor to love in the whole world.

213
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:11,910
Being fickle and lacking in righteousness is the natural disposition of people.

214
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:14,170
What does it have to do with gender?

215
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:15,990
Ridiculous.

216
00:15:18,490 --> 00:15:20,760
What kind of person lives a life without turning their backs on others,

217
00:15:22,600 --> 00:15:25,160
and who hasn't ever been betrayed before?

218
00:15:26,870 --> 00:15:28,990
Your life has been too full of suffering.

219
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,630
I no longer want to take it.

220
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,260
How about this?

221
00:15:36,920 --> 00:15:39,780
I will give you one chance to make a choice.

222
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,170
If you are willing to pledge your loyalty to me,

223
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:48,940
do not even mention that person with the surname Yu,

224
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,890
whatever wishes you have,

225
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:53,050
I will promise to you.

226
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,820
I do not care what method you use.

227
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:57,200
Find the recipe for the Water of Oblivion.

228
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,250
Give it to me,

229
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,240
and I will let you go.

230
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:29,560
Master, when you entered the Valley, you were only seven or eight years old.

231
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:32,190
Why did you also have to drink the Water of Oblivion?

232
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,840
There were some people who didn't want me to remember certain things.

233
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:43,610
Apologies, for I have disappointed them.

234
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:48,010
But you drank the Water of Oblivion,

235
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,010
so how do you still remember?

236
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:53,830
Such a deep hatred is hard to forget even after one's teeth fall out.

237
00:16:53,830 --> 00:16:57,090
Don't even mention swallowing one measly bowl of Water of Oblivion.

238
00:16:57,090 --> 00:16:59,570
Even if my corpse were torn apart by five horses going in different directions and burned to ashes that were then scattered,

239
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:03,110
even if I had to crawl back from hell, step by step,

240
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,520
I would still find them and take revenge.

241
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:11,180
When I was young,

242
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:14,250
I often had headaches, coughed up blood, and fainted.

243
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,650
That was the consequence of continually defending against the effects of the Water of Oblivion.

244
00:17:17,650 --> 00:17:19,680
This problem hasn't acted up in a long time.

245
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,830
Recent days have constantly been triggering old events.

246
00:17:21,830 --> 00:17:23,990
Perhaps, there will be some effect.

247
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,040
One day,

248
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:30,810
the migraines might torture me into becoming a madman.

249
00:17:30,810 --> 00:17:34,980
But before that day arrives, my enemies

250
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,900
must all die before me.

251
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,610
Don't be afraid.

252
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,510
Before that day arrives,

253
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,960
I'll make sure you're in a good place.

254
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,240
What would I be afraid of? I'm just angry!

255
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,650
Master, I was raised by you.

256
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,410
If you had such qualms, why didn't you tell me earlier?

257
00:18:03,410 --> 00:18:06,180
I'd risk my life to help you!

258
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,800
I don't want your help.

259
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,970
A'Xiang, let me ask you.

260
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:16,450
Do you genuinely like Cao Weining?

261
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:21,850
- Master, what are you saying? I'm asking you about serious matters! Don't interrupt—
- Answer me!

262
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:24,790
If you don't like him, I'll gut him.

263
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,440
M-Mast...

264
00:18:26,440 --> 00:18:28,490
Then you do like him.

265
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:35,070
If you like him,

266
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:38,740
leave for Gentle Wind Sword Sect with him tomorrow.

267
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:44,040
That Mo Huaiyang is highly skilled in martial arts and has a cunning mind.

268
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,410
He probably won't let his sect get caught in these troubles.

269
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:50,120
You will be very safe staying there.

270
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:55,900
Master, you don't want me anymore?

271
00:18:57,530 --> 00:19:02,030
Stupid girl. The road I am taking points towards the netherworld.

272
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:04,840
You were originally a lost soul that accidentally entered the Ghost Valley by chance.

273
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:08,670
Right now, you still have a chance to live under the light. Why are you still following me?

274
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:12,600
Although I have hundreds of complaints against this Cao Weining,

275
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,990
at least he's easily controllable.

276
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:16,960
Go back to the human realm with him.

277
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,680
Live a simple life.

278
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:21,380
I doubt he's capable of creating big troubles.

279
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:24,660
Master, there's something

280
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,900
I haven't had the chance to tell you yet.

281
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,680
I followed Cao Weining

282
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:32,370
because he said there was a high chance that Gao Chong

283
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,920
gave the Glazed Armor to their

284
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,980
Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

285
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:39,700
I went together with Cao Weining

286
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,440
because I actually wanted to

287
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:46,630
help you find out where the Glazed Armor was. That's why I was with him.

288
00:19:46,630 --> 00:19:48,390
But...

289
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:53,130
But I... I also don't know why

290
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:59,340
I... I just really ended up together with him.

291
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,570
Master, I beg you. Can you

292
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:08,360
not attack the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

293
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,410
I'm sorry, Master. I know I shouldn't say this,

294
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,960
but...

295
00:20:21,390 --> 00:20:24,290
but I don't want him to hate me!

296
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:29,500
He... He's not related to me, anyway.

297
00:20:30,470 --> 00:20:32,080
I...

298
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,390
I just don't want him...

299
00:20:34,390 --> 00:20:36,640
want him to be in trouble.

300
00:20:43,290 --> 00:20:48,560
Don't worry. This little thing is not worth crying like this over.

301
00:20:48,560 --> 00:20:50,800
But, Master,

302
00:20:52,660 --> 00:20:55,050
I'm scared.

303
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:09,180
They all say that

304
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,550
humans and devils can't walk on the same path.

305
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,980
Eldest Brother Cao and I aren't the same.

306
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:19,010
All I know...

307
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:22,000
is how to kill people, harm people,

308
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,930
and how to prevent others from harming me.

309
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:28,160
Even my motive for getting closer to Eldest Brother Cao

310
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:31,650
was impure.

311
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:35,100
He's only good to me now

312
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:40,150
because I hid it well.

313
00:21:40,150 --> 00:21:43,730
But once he finds out who I am someday,

314
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:45,450
if he doesn't take his sword

315
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,420
and kill me,

316
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:50,130
that would already count as a kind act.

317
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:52,100
He dares!

318
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:05,830
If Cao Weining dares to fail you, I'll massacre his whole sect.

319
00:22:05,830 --> 00:22:08,260
Master!

320
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:12,150
I'm the one who failed him, not the other way around!

321
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,520
Master, I'm so scared.

322
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,540
I think...

323
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:25,090
the better he treats me now,

324
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,520
the more I think everything is fake.

325
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:31,550
Just like the snowman you built for me.

326
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:34,870
Once the sun came out,

327
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:43,210
it melted.

328
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:46,150
Didn't I make a bunch more for you afterward?

329
00:22:46,150 --> 00:22:47,350
Don't cry anymore.

330
00:22:47,350 --> 00:22:51,030
But I only liked the first one!

331
00:22:51,740 --> 00:22:55,240
No matter how big and how perfect the snowmen you built for me afterward were,

332
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,510
they were all incomparable to the first one you built together with me.

333
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:01,860
Master, think about it.

334
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:05,190
If one day, Zhou Xu found out your identity,

335
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,250
would you kill him and find a new friend?

336
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:12,430
Enough! Gu Xiang,

337
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:14,510
don't forget you're the Heartless Amethyst Fiend.

338
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:18,300
You've only been around humans for a bit, and you've already become as sentimental as a grandmother!

339
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:21,080
Can I forget? How could I forget?

340
00:23:22,350 --> 00:23:25,560
An ugly wife can still meet her in-laws,

341
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:30,830
but... but the Ghost Valley's Heartless Amethyst Fiend can't see the light!

342
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:36,880
All right. I've made my decision.

343
00:23:39,330 --> 00:23:43,170
Listen to me. You've grown up in the Ghost Valley.

344
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,280
You've never walked in the martial arts world.

345
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:49,260
They don't have any reason to know your identity, so just hide it until the end.

346
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:54,570
I promise you. I won't hurt the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

347
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:58,300
In the future, don't get involved in any more Ghost Valley business.

348
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:02,170
If I don't call for you, just stay on Gentle Wind Mountain.

349
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:08,300
Then... Then you don't want the Glazed Armor anymore?

350
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:12,950
I don't want it anymore.

351
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,980
That Glazed Armor...

352
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:24,240
was a cover anyways.

353
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,730
Master Wen, you're awake? Are you okay?

354
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:55,120
I'm all right. Come with me for a moment.

355
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:57,000
I have something to say to you.

356
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:03,250
Uncle Wen. Brother Cao. Don't leave!

357
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,490
I don't know how to cook!

358
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:20,410
Master Wen, you suddenly called me out... Is there something wrong?

359
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,490
I...

360
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,260
When I was half a child myself,

361
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,480
I picked up A'Xiang.

362
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,990
The first time I fed her congee,

363
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:37,860
I burned her mouth.

364
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,550
The place we lived in when we were younger

365
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:45,950
wasn't a place for humans to reside.

366
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:48,670
I could barely take care of myself,

367
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:50,500
and I originally didn't want that burden anyways.

368
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:53,310
There were many times where I wanted to throw her away.

369
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:58,300
But that little thing who could barely speak

370
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:01,310
was like a little stubborn beast begging for life.

371
00:26:01,310 --> 00:26:04,960
Wherever I went, she followed.

372
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,230
Her mouth was already burned,

373
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:10,430
but she still smiled crookedly at me,

374
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,680
her only fear being that I would throw her away.

375
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,490
A'Xiang told me about these things before.

376
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,050
I know she's suffered a lot growing up.

377
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,510
The fact that she followed a person like me

378
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:29,420
and didn't end up too slanted of a person, is already a blessing.

379
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,530
A'Xiang isn't actually my maid.

380
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:38,930
It's because I saved her, and once she grew up,

381
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:43,090
she said she would serve me like a slave. That's where she got that title.

382
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,260
Actually,

383
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:51,320
I've only now realized

384
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,510
that I didn't save her,

385
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:56,100
rather she saved me.

386
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,880
If there wasn't a little thing like her beside me,

387
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:03,090
warming the last of the passion in my heart,

388
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,700
I—

389
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:15,630
I'm telling you all this because I want you to know that

390
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,330
A'Xiang is like my younger sister.

391
00:27:18,330 --> 00:27:22,150
If we exaggerate it, I raised her.

392
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:24,760
She is more or less like my daughter.

393
00:27:25,950 --> 00:27:30,340
In this life of mine, not that many people ever treated me well.

394
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:34,470
For the few who did, I will risk my life to pay them back for it.

395
00:27:34,470 --> 00:27:37,220
A'Xiang counts as one of them.

396
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,360
In the past, there were some things

397
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:46,490
I didn't even dare to think about, for they were too far away.

398
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:49,290
But now,

399
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:52,830
they don't seem to be that far anymore.

400
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:59,280
I want that girl to live well.

401
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,860
I want her to one day

402
00:28:03,310 --> 00:28:06,760
be able to live the simple, happy life of a normal person.

403
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:15,560
Cao Weining, can you give her that kind of life?

404
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,490
Yes! Of course, I can!

405
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:20,490
Although I can't give her riches, I can—

406
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,320
I don't need you to give her riches!

407
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,620
Tomorrow, take her back to Gentle Wind Sword Sect with you.

408
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:27,960
But you must promise me!

409
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:30,620
Never fail A'Xiang.

410
00:28:30,620 --> 00:28:33,350
In the future, no matter what happens, you must protect her.

411
00:28:33,350 --> 00:28:36,120
Stand in front of her, and make sure she's safe and happy

412
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,460
without a care in the world.

413
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:40,350
Can you do that?

414
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:44,760
Master Wen, I understand. Don't worry.

415
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:49,350
Today, I vow to the heavens in front of you.

416
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:53,060
The heavens and the earth will hear my vow.

417
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,820
I, Cao Weining, from now until death

418
00:28:55,820 --> 00:28:58,610
will not for any second of any day

419
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:00,660
do anything that fails A'Xiang!

420
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:03,730
If I go against it, the gods and devils will abandon me!

421
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:06,080
Don't speak with such finality yet.

422
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:08,390
After all, you have only known each other for a short while.

423
00:29:08,390 --> 00:29:11,390
She might not be what you expected her to be like.

424
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,070
If you didn't vow, I wouldn't have forced you to,

425
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:17,860
but since you took that vow today,

426
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:20,550
don't think gods and devils aren't real.

427
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:25,460
In future days, if you fail A'Xiang, I'll be the first to strike you down.

428
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:29,230
I understand. Of course, I understand her.

429
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,960
To understand someone doesn't have to do with how long you've known each other.

430
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:35,520
From the first time I ever saw A'Xiang,

431
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,970
I wanted to be good to her for the rest of my life.

432
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,500
Since my wish was granted today,

433
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:44,190
I couldn't be more happy!

434
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:47,200
If I fail her later,

435
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:51,330
you won't even have to say anything! I'll slice my own throat to apologize for my sin.

436
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:55,710
All right. You're the one who said it.

437
00:29:55,710 --> 00:30:00,120
If you can't live up to your word, I won't let you off even if I became a devil.

438
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:03,760
Then it's a promise!

439
00:30:04,530 --> 00:30:06,260
A promise.

440
00:30:09,930 --> 00:30:12,520
What sort of father-in-law is so violent?

441
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,870
Aren't you afraid that your son-in-law will regret his words?

442
00:30:14,870 --> 00:30:16,330
Were you eavesdropping on our conversation?

443
00:30:16,330 --> 00:30:19,800
I wasn't eavesdropping! I listened right out in the open.

444
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,730
Weining, if your father-in-law bullies you,

445
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:26,850
I can take care of him. You just pay attention to treating A'Xiang well.

446
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:30,530
All right. We're leaving tomorrow. I'll go prepare our things.

447
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:37,400
Although your little son-in-law is good,

448
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:41,600
why are you in such a hurry to send A'Xiang away?

449
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,800
Aren't you afraid her stepparents won't treat her right?

450
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,400
Who would dare?

451
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,600
Old Wen,

452
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,200
why are you in such a hurry to entrust A'Xiang to someone else?

453
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:58,200
Because I already have someone I'm entrusted to,

454
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:02,200
so I ended up loving matchmaking. I want to settle A'Xiang well

455
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:06,160
and live a carefree life in the mountains and woods with you as immortals would.

456
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:10,200
Then Philanthropist Wen,

457
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:13,300
why don't you practice generosity by matchmaking for me?

458
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,200
Uncle Wen, don't call Brother Cao away for so long!

459
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,200
I don't know how to cook! That pot looks burnt.

460
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:24,500
What do I do?

461
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:27,900
He went down the mountain to buy good food. You don't have to cook anymore.

462
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:32,800
Look at that. What immortal-like life were you speaking of?

463
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:34,440
With this little brat here,

464
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:37,600
we will only have a chaotic and noisy life in the future.

465
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:47,300
A'Xu, is this vinegar or wine?

466
00:31:47,300 --> 00:31:49,500
You can swallow something this nasty?

467
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:58,200
In this pitiful place,

468
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,000
how could there be good wine anywhere? Just deal with it.

469
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,800
Once we're at Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

470
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,600
I'll dig up the wine I buried under the plum forest

471
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:07,000
for you to taste.

472
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,500
Master, our villa has a plum forest?

473
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,400
Not only a plum forest.

474
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:16,800
The martial arts world gifts our villa with the phrase

475
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,200
"As long as the flowers of four seasons are abloom, there is nothing of we are not aware of"

476
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:26,400
[Address to Five Lakes Alliance Leader Zhao]

477
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,600
Father!

478
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,400
Scorpion, you've come at a good time!

479
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:35,600
You dealt with the Immortal Dawn Sect well.

480
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,600
Those people Pretty Arhat purposefully let go of ran all the way to Mount Song.

481
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,400
They knelt in front of Shaolin Temple for three days and three nights

482
00:32:42,400 --> 00:32:45,200
to beg the lead monk to help them seek justice.

483
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,200
Guess what that old man Ci Mu said?

484
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,100
He couldn't sit still anymore!

485
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:54,800
He's currently calling all sects to attack Ghost Valley together.

486
00:32:54,800 --> 00:32:57,400
"Inviting the Honorable Alliance Leader Zhao to attend when the time arrives.

487
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,900
We couldn't be happier."

488
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:03,200
What do you say?

489
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,800
I naturally have nothing to say.

490
00:33:05,800 --> 00:33:08,200
These fake righteous sects

491
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,500
watched safely from their side

492
00:33:11,500 --> 00:33:13,400
when Ghost Valley was attacking our Five Lakes Alliance.

493
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:17,200
Now that the knife is on their necks, they understand the pain.

494
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:19,400
Inviting my Five Lakes Alliance to come out of the mountain

495
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:22,330
is not that easy. If you want me to come out,

496
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:23,800
go ahead.

497
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,100
Express your sincerity.

498
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:31,200
Father, I don't understand.

499
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:34,000
Child,

500
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,000
you are still too inexperienced.

501
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,400
Gao Chong was also like this back then.

502
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:41,600
He lived his whole life without understanding this fact.

503
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:44,600
Think about it. Ghost Valley comes out to do evil,

504
00:33:44,600 --> 00:33:46,400
but aside from some small grudges,

505
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:49,200
the big problems are all pointed at our Five Lake Alliance.

506
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,200
But Gao Chong decides to hold some Dog Bear Meeting at this time.

507
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:57,000
The ones that came were only small fries who wanted in on the fun.

508
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,800
Out of the true big sects,

509
00:33:59,800 --> 00:34:01,500
who came?

510
00:34:04,020 --> 00:34:05,510
That's right.

511
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,910
Not one sect leader from the Eight Great Sects came.

512
00:34:13,450 --> 00:34:16,110
Even the Changming Mountain Valley Sword Immortal

513
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:18,980
only sent a disciple.

514
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,100
That's why,

515
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:24,100
my child, those so-called righteous sects of the martial arts world

516
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:28,100
all either have ulterior motives or are no longer strong.

517
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,600
Their schemes only grow from one to the other.

518
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:33,400
You want them to band together to attack Ghost Valley?

519
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:35,800
If only for the sake of righteousness and no benefit,

520
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:37,000
it wouldn't work.

521
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,800
If only for the sake of benefit, but no righteous goals? That wouldn't work either.

522
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:44,200
Therefore, we can only draw a large circle to include both righteousness and benefit.

523
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:46,700
Only then can we draw them in.

524
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:51,600
Good horse, after you are full, make sure to carry our A'Xiang well.

525
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:54,200
Don't be frisky, be good.

526
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:56,400
Who's yours?

527
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:01,200
Little Red and Big Red. Choose one and ride away.

528
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,200
I already prepared food and water for you.

529
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,200
Let's part ways here.

530
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,800
A'Xiang, why are you still upset with me?

531
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,800
What do I have to be upset about? I'm Master's maid.

532
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,800
Naturally, I'm following my master. Go back to your Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

533
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,000
A'Xiang, I was wrong, so don't be angry anymore. Okay?

534
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,400
Who said you were wrong?

535
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:22,000
You are a great young warrior from a famous sect.

536
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,400
I'm just a wild girl. We don't walk the same path.

537
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,800
Who said you're a wild girl?

538
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:28,800
Brother Wen!

539
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,400
Master?

540
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,000
Aren't you my maid?

541
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,200
Then, have I become a wild person?

542
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:41,500
Cao Weining, did you bring your sack?

543
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,200
I brought it, I brought it.

544
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:49,400
I don't want this girl anymore. I'll sell her to you for three thousand silvers.

545
00:35:49,400 --> 00:35:52,600
Do you want her? If you do, then give me the money, and I'll hand her over.

546
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:56,000
One gets silver, the other gets their person. No regrets.

547
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,600
Master, y-you bastard!

548
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,800
Look at that! This savage slave is bullying her master.

549
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,400
How can I still have her?

550
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
How about this? I'll give you a discount.

551
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,600
A thousand and a half silvers. Don't think that's expensive.

552
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:10,800
My A'Xu is so hardworking but was only three thousand silvers.

553
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:14,150
What are you laughing for?

554
00:36:15,100 --> 00:36:17,400
Zhou Xu, why aren't you stopping him?

555
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,600
How can I stop him?

556
00:36:21,600 --> 00:36:24,100
If you don't stop him, then who will?

557
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,700
And she's so fierce.

558
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,600
I'll give her to you for free. I don't want her.

559
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,500
Hurry and take her.

560
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:37,700
Brother Wen, the heavens are my witness.

561
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,400
I have never treated A'Xiang as if she were a maid.

562
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,200
With your favor, you've entrusted her to me.

563
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:45,400
Once I've reported to my master,

564
00:36:45,400 --> 00:36:48,400
I'll definitely follow the tradition of dispatching three matchmakers for negotiation and ask for her hand in marriage with ten streets of dowry.

565
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
I don't dare to treat her with anything less.

566
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:58,200
Ten streets of dowry? Doesn't that happen when a family's daughter is getting married?

567
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,000
What do you know?

568
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,600
A'Xiang!

569
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,300
[Li Residence]

570
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,040
Scorpion, help me make a List of Devils.

571
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:15,400
Publicize it throughout the martial arts world.

572
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:19,000
But we've already allied with them, so why are we going back on our word?

573
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:22,300
Father, if you publicize the List of Devils,

574
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:24,400
isn't that blocking off their path of retreat?

575
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,400
Then... Then how do I order them around in the future?

576
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:30,700
Scorpion, right now, even the Shaolin Temple has come out.

577
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:33,600
The time is already ripe.

578
00:37:33,600 --> 00:37:37,300
Anyways, why would we still need those devils?

579
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,600
The wide web is ready and waiting to entrap its prey

580
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:43,500
within its webs.

581
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,700
Still don't understand?

582
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,400
We want to destroy Ghost Valley,

583
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,600
but the devils are all outside. Who are we destroying then?

584
00:38:01,600 --> 00:38:04,400
As soon as they lose my protection

585
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,800
and cannot move freely in the martial arts world,

586
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,600
where do you think they will go?

587
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:11,000
You mean...

588
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:15,200
you want to force them into a dead end, so they can only return to Ghost Valley?

589
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:19,400
But, Father, if they leave and talk of our plans...

590
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,600
Who would believe their nonsense?

591
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,600
Besides, Gao Chong's alliance with Ghost Valley cannot be confirmed.

592
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,200
It's still unconfirmed even now.

593
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,500
Although we can place that aside for now,

594
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:33,800
it's still more or less of a negative influence on our Five Lake Alliance.

595
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,000
So during this time,

596
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:40,400
I just want these evil devils to bite each other.

597
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,200
We can then find an evil Devil to corroborate for us.

598
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,400
"Ghost Valley framed the Five Lake Alliance."

599
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:48,000
"Their motive was to divide the martial arts world."

600
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:51,000
Then, our Five Lake Alliance will have been unjustly accused.

601
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,000
Once we've been cleared of blame,

602
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Eldest Brother Gao Chong won't be able to see it.

603
00:38:56,000 --> 00:39:01,000
Wouldn't the sects within the martial arts world be filled with remorse?

604
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:05,200
At that time, I'll lead all the sects to destroy Ghost Valley.

605
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,600
I'll have power and righteousness

606
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,000
while carrying the remorse from all the sects.

607
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:14,800
If we were to choose a supreme leader of the martial arts world then,

608
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,800
who could it be but for me?

609
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:19,400
Father,

610
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:22,700
how are you so smart?

611
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:26,600
Even if military general Zhuge were still alive,

612
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:31,600
he would pale in comparison to your tactics.

613
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,800
You know how to talk.

614
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,200
All you know is how to make me happy.

615
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:41,600
How can my little tactics match with our virtuous ancestors?

616
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:50,600
It's just... I have still heard nothing from the Lustful Ghost.

617
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:56,000
Technically, Yu Qiufeng is not his opponent.

618
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,200
Has that bastard realized something is wrong and gone into hiding?

619
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:05,100
No matter. Right now everyone in the martial arts world is helping me look for you.

620
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,300
Let me see where you can hide.

621
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:48,400
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

622
00:40:49,600 --> 00:40:55,700
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

623
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:03,800
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

624
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:11,300
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

625
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:19,400
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

626
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:26,900
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

627
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:34,400
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

628
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:42,200
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

629
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:49,400
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

630
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:57,400
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

631
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,600
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

632
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:11,700
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

633
00:42:11,700 --> 00:42:20,000
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
