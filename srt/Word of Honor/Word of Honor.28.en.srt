[Word of Honor]

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,100
[Episode 28]

23
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
Your Highness, Commander Han Ying begs your audience.

24
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,200
Han Ying? Let him in immediately!

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,800
Yes.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,600
- Han Ying!
- Greetings, Your Highness.

27
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,400
Forego the formalities and just lie down.

28
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,800
I don't dare be so impolite.

29
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,600
Lie down!

30
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,000
What happened? Why was there no news for so long?

31
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,600
Your Highness, please forgive me.

32
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,800
My subgroup was followed

33
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,400
and ambushed.

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,800
My brothers all died in the line of duty.

35
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,400
Only I was able to keep my life through surviving numerous brushes with death.

36
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,100
If it were not for my loyalty to Your Highness,

37
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,400
I fear that I would not have made it either.

38
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:06,400
How dare they!

39
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,400
Do you know who did it?

40
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,300
It was the Venomous Scorpions!

41
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The Venomous Scorpions are a powerful assassin force who primarily

42
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,400
kill for money. Although the enemies all had masks,

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:26,800
this Scorpion Tail Thorn was taken out from my wound.

44
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,800
I have asked around. This is a weapon of the Venomous Scorpions!

45
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,600
Such a thing has happened?

46
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,580
Good.

47
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:42,630
Very good.

48
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:45,600
Your Highness,

49
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,200
we have always been careful in carrying out our tasks.

50
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:50,680
How would outsiders learn of our whereabouts?

51
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,900
This is very odd.

52
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,200
I am afraid there is a spy within the Window of Heaven.

53
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:02,400
In fear that it would ruin Your Highness' plans,

54
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,100
I became extremely anxious and immediately rushed back as soon as I could move.

55
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
But Leader Duan is currently not in the capital.

56
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,800
Pengju is currently heading to Jiangnan.

57
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:18,700
Because no matter how long he waited, he could not get any news from you,

58
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:20,600
he had no choice but to go in person.

59
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:23,200
It is my fault. Please punish me, Your Highness!

60
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,100
But you helped me find a piece of Glazed Armor.

61
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,210
It must've been difficult.

62
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:34,400
It is almost the end of the year. You have worked hard.

63
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,700
Go back and rest well. I will award you appropriately.

64
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,200
If you hadn't told us the truth,

65
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,400
I could've looked all over the world

66
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
and still never guessed that for all of these years,

67
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,800
the key has always been hidden in Ghost Valley.

68
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,600
Although I am not completely sure,

69
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
but thinking back carefully,

70
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,200
if Gao Chong was actually allied with Ghost Valley,

71
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,600
his three pieces of Glazed Armor

72
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,600
are most likely in Ghost Valley.

73
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,800
And the one I lost must've also been taken by Ghost Valley amidst the confusion.

74
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,600
In that case, once I take down Ghost Valley,

75
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,500
I will definitely be able to repay His Highness.

76
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,300
Good. Very good.

77
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:46,100
The Glazed Armor has been hidden in the martial arts world for many years.

78
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,200
It is the great men of the martial arts world who know most. That being said,

79
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:52,200
I...

80
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:56,000
will look forward to your good news.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
I definitely won't let you down!

82
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:06,990
However, Officer Duan, I have one more favor to ask.

83
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,200
Gao Chong was headstrong and ruined himself.

84
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:14,800
But could you ask His Highness to take pity on us

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:20,000
and not drag the entire Five Lakes Alliance over his individual actions?

86
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,400
Of course. Things of the past

87
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:27,800
stay in the past. In the future,

88
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,800
I will have many areas in which I need your help.

89
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,800
There's also the possibility that His Highness will recognize your worth

90
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,200
and we can become imperial officials under him. Who knows?

91
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,400
How could I? How could I?

92
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Officer Duan, you are outstanding among men. There is no limit to your potential.

93
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
I am just a normal civilian. How could I have such ambition?

94
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,000
Prince Jin currently needs useful people.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you can prove your own worth,

96
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,000
then not only could you become a supreme leader of the martial arts world,

97
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,500
obtaining the title of Marquis or a respectable State Preceptor

98
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,700
wouldn't be out of the question.

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,200
[To Prince Jin]

100
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:43,300
Scorpion!

101
00:08:45,100 --> 00:08:47,000
You came just in time.

102
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,400
- Come drink with me.
- Go prepare some warm tea for my father to sober up.

103
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,100
Yes, sir.

104
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,800
Scorpion,

105
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,200
guess...

106
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:04,400
who has the Long-Tongued Ghost's Glazed Armor?

107
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,210
It's with the Window of Heaven!

108
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:14,400
What a great coincidence!

109
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:18,400
The Window of Heaven and Prince Jin want to ally with me right now, too.

110
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:21,800
Isn't that even better?

111
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:25,200
Prince Jin is completely dominating the Northwest region right now.

112
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
He has strong forces. When I attack Ghost Valley,

113
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,400
he'll be a great support!

114
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:43,400
Scorpion, are you still angry with me?

115
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:49,800
Just look at your stubborn temper.

116
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,800
Fine. I'll apologize to you.

117
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:58,400
I was wrong. I'll pour you some tea!

118
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:12,400
You saved my life, and your education has made me into a talented person.

119
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,180
Hitting me is fine.

120
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,890
Even if you want to kill me or cut me, I won't speak a word of complaint.

121
00:10:17,890 --> 00:10:19,970
I would just like to know.

122
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:24,410
Last time, you said if I did something wrong,

123
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:28,800
you wouldn't consider our father-son relationship.

124
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,140
Those were just words of anger!

125
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:35,090
Let me tell you.

126
00:10:35,090 --> 00:10:39,670
The closer the relationship, like the one between father and son or husband and wife,

127
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:43,480
the easier it is to say such hurtful words.

128
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,340
It's fake!

129
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,370
I just want to know.

130
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:50,060
If one day,

131
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:53,250
I really did do something wrong and you got dragged down because of it,

132
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,530
what would you do?

133
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,160
Come here.

134
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:06,970
You little barbarian...

135
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,620
Ever since I brought you home,

136
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,810
we've depended on each other for survival.

137
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,640
Us father and son have long been of the same mind.

138
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:21,790
Therefore, no matter what you encounter in the future,

139
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:27,550
I will face it with you.

140
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,100
We will face the consequences together.

141
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,250
Father...

142
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,480
you're telling the truth? You aren't deceiving me?

143
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,090
Of course it's the truth.

144
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:45,070
As long as I am here,

145
00:11:45,070 --> 00:11:47,000
don't be scared.

146
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:54,210
Right, Father,

147
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,030
you just said that Prince Jin wants to collaborate with you.

148
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,120
That's great news.

149
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,530
Didn't you want to change your status your whole life? Isn't this a great chance?

150
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:07,910
Yes. It's a great gamble.

151
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,410
Currently, the chances of winning aren't high.

152
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:15,160
We still have to maintain control of Duan Pengju.

153
00:12:15,160 --> 00:12:17,760
As to whether we make an alliance or not,

154
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:20,120
that requires further planning.

155
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,820
But didn't Duan Pengju already say

156
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:26,460
that as long as we bet correctly,

157
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,330
you could be the State Preceptor in the future?

158
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,490
What if we bet wrong?

159
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:33,530
What that Prince Jin is doing

160
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:36,270
is planning treason.

161
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:38,250
As soon as it is exposed,

162
00:12:38,250 --> 00:12:40,280
the whole clan of those involved will be killed

163
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,980
and nine generations of their families will be wiped out.
(T/N: In Imperial China, when a crime was truly terrible, entire families of the perpetrator would be killed, even very distant relatives and people who married into the family)

164
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:46,110
This isn't just some battle in the martial arts world.

165
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,010
But I am not afraid.

166
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,190
Father, fortune should be sought in danger.

167
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:57,270
If one day you became a prince

168
00:12:57,270 --> 00:13:00,930
or a state preceptor, no one in the martial arts world

169
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:05,350
would dare to criticize us.

170
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:11,880
My Scorpion is certainly like me.

171
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,600
I...

172
00:13:14,530 --> 00:13:18,890
If I was still a poor stupid boy,

173
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:21,470
I would take the gamble with him!

174
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:25,420
But I am about to rise to the top,

175
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:29,080
isn't this gamble a little too risky?

176
00:13:31,100 --> 00:13:34,120
Don't be in such a hurry.

177
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,940
All I care about right now is stability.

178
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,270
First, stabilize the Window of Heaven,

179
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:41,080
then move when the time is right.

180
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,820
If it really does look like Prince Jin will succeed,

181
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,440
expressing our support at that time

182
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,960
wouldn't be too late.

183
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:52,000
But at that time,

184
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,630
Prince Jin isn't going to be needing our support because he'll have others.

185
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:01,930
Father, you are afraid of the consequences,

186
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,090
afraid of ruining all your achievements,

187
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:06,270
but I am not.

188
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:10,000
I didn't have anything, to begin with.

189
00:14:11,850 --> 00:14:16,350
I am willing to present an idea to you.

190
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:18,400
You will not need to worry about the consequences.

191
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:22,930
Let's hear it.

192
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,600
You've never announced your relationship with the Venomous Scorpions.

193
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:32,820
In the eyes of the martial arts world,

194
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:35,770
we are unfamiliar with each other.

195
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,820
How about if I came forward to express loyalty to Prince Jin

196
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,080
and gather all the Glazed Armor?

197
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,900
If things succeed, the award we receive

198
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:46,870
will be presented to you. If we fail,

199
00:14:47,710 --> 00:14:49,650
then even if the punishment is death by a thousand cuts or being pulled five directions by horse carts,

200
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:54,990
I will bear it alone. It will be no harm to you.

201
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:05,230
Wonderful scheme, Your Highness. Han Ying is indeed traitorous.

202
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:08,220
He visited your book room at night for a long length of time before leaving.

203
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,690
I followed your orders and had someone follow him.

204
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:14,840
We realized he went to former Leader Zhou Zishu's residence.

205
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,220
He has not come back yet.

206
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,060
Very good.

207
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,460
Your Highness, would you like for me to go capture the traitor?

208
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:24,970
No.

209
00:15:25,640 --> 00:15:27,820
Continue following him closely.

210
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:30,470
How many big fish

211
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:35,170
will this great bait bring me?

212
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:40,830
- Leave now.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:49,630
Zishu, just as expected of you.

214
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:54,320
You've been gone for so long, yet you still have people risking their lives for you nonetheless.

215
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,760
I would like to see

216
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,630
how many other backup plans you've left here.

217
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:19,660
My Lord, I now know why His Highness wants to find the Glazed Armor.

218
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,840
Your illness can be cured!

219
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:26,270
Even if I must risk my life, I will still gather the Glazed Armor for you.

220
00:16:38,850 --> 00:16:40,750
Old Duan,

221
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:44,230
you've gotten bold recently.

222
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:46,610
You've come to Jiangnan

223
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:50,120
but didn't even come to catch up with me first.

224
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:53,320
Instead, you went drinking with the Alliance Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance?

225
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:59,300
Say... how should I punish you?

226
00:17:02,920 --> 00:17:06,280
My Bodhisattva, I really didn't know

227
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,690
that you were also in Yueyang.

228
00:17:08,690 --> 00:17:12,070
I originally thought that after all business was dealt with,

229
00:17:12,070 --> 00:17:15,270
I could go visit you and the Scorpion King in Huzhou.

230
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:19,280
Prince Jin heard that the Scorpion King's thaumaturgy has some new improvements.

231
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,020
He was greatly interested.

232
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:23,920
Bullshit!

233
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:25,780
Your Highness only cares about

234
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:29,100
having the Drug Men army help him fight.

235
00:17:29,110 --> 00:17:32,160
Yes, yes, yes. But in my heart,

236
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,770
I only truly care about the most beautiful

female Bodhisattva—

238

Don't even think about it!

239
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,150
You haven't taken your punishment yet.

240
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:42,730
I accept the punishment.

241
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:46,870
Female Bodhisattva, what do you plan to do?

242
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,830
I heard you had fun drinking with the Alliance Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.

243
00:17:57,770 --> 00:18:01,210
Old Duan, don't blame me. I'll say one thing and leave.

244
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:03,820
I won't distract you old lovers from catching up.

245
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,850
Scorpion King, this—

246
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,730
The prince wants to find the Glazed Armor.

247
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:16,140
He didn't come to find me? Why would he ignore the easy ally but go for the difficult one?

248

[Brief Wind, Light Clouds]

Farther left!

251

It's crooked.

Hey, to the right a bit!

253
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,310
- Yes, yes, yes. Yes, yes, yes. It's good.
- Don't listen to him.

00:18:56,310 --> 00:18:58,410
He has poor eyesight.

255
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:05,060
If I had bad eyesight,

256
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:07,430
I wouldn't be here now.

257
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:10,260
Stick it on just like that!

258
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,420
Master, I've stuck it on!

259
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,600
Master, it looks more like a home now.

260

Stupid brat, look at how happy it has made you.

261

If you like putting those up, then do it slowly. There's a whole pail of adhesive.

262
00:19:25,390 --> 00:19:27,160
We need some put up in every room!

263

Your Junior Master saw that the girl selling paper cut patterns

264
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,480
was a young beauty

265
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:34,720
and almost bought the whole basket of them!

266

I don't want to help you.

I can't do anything.

270
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:49,930
Chengling, don't learn from your Master. Gluttonous and lazy.

On the first day of the New Year, we must make the house

Okay!

Just eat your sunflower seeds! You just talk non-stop.

Get the knife and kill the chicken.

282
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:16,920
Junior Master, you want me to kill that?

283
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,590
You think it should kill you instead?

284
00:21:18,590 --> 00:21:21,530
Hurry up! The chicken is more flavorful when it's cooked for longer.

285
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:24,970
Junior Master, assign me a different task.

I really don't dare.

You don't even dare to kill a chicken?

You pair of lazy master and apprentice leech off the hard work of others and do nothing but eat the produce of others!

00:36:00,020 --> 00:36:03,270
What happened after our farewell in Yueyang?

485
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:06,450
Someone in the Window of Heaven

486
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:08,420
recognized you at the Heroes Conference in Yueyang.

487
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:12,160
I blocked this piece of information. Later,

488
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,140
when the news was about to be leaked, I killed them all

489
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:18,400
and blamed it on Venomous Scorpions.

490
00:36:19,830 --> 00:36:23,780
Unfortunately, this method can only trick His Highness for a time.

491
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,040
So I was thinking, before I escaped,

492
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:30,990
I must help you find something useful.

493
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:33,760
I snuck into His Highness's study

494
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:37,780
and luckily found the Glazed Armor's secret!

495
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:42,740
Too bad, I did my best.

496
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:45,210
I was only able to find one piece of Glazed Armor

497
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,560
and then was discovered by the Window of Heaven.

498
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:51,290
Fortunately, Xingming covered for me

499
00:36:51,290 --> 00:36:55,060
which allowed me to escape from Jinzhou. My Lord,

500
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:58,050
although we never had the honor of joining Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

501
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:02,170
like all the elders before me, I'm willing to risk everything for you!

502
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:04,470
Who wanted you to risk everything?

503
00:37:04,470 --> 00:37:06,490
I want you to live well!

504
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:08,740
A loyal servant never recognizes a second master.

505
00:37:08,740 --> 00:37:11,560
I am your loyal servant till death.

506
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:15,670
I ought to serve you when alive and die for you when needed.

507
00:37:15,670 --> 00:37:18,020
If you die,

508
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,400
how could I live alone?

509
00:37:20,950 --> 00:37:25,230
My Lord, there is something else I must tell you.

510
00:37:25,230 --> 00:37:29,830
In His Highness's study, I discovered a secret letter.

511
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:32,630
That year, your father,

512
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,720
Great Elder Zhou, suddenly passed away

513
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,320
because the past Prince Jin accused him of treason

514
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,990
and killed him secretly.

515
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:44,490
That can't be.

516
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,080
My father passed away from sickness.

517
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:52,060
But... that's what the letter said.

518
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,050
That can't be.

519
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,050
My father was former Prince Jin's lifetime friend

520
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,160
and most trusted advisor.

521
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:01,960
Where did you see this letter?

522
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:06,620
This letter... was on His Highness's table.

523
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:11,830
A'Xu, it's not too late to plan this further.

524
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:17,100
My Lord. Master Wen...

525
00:38:17,100 --> 00:38:19,160
If you gather the five pieces of the Glazed Armor,

526
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,270
you can open the World's Armory.

527
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:26,530
You can find the Miracle Healer Valley's—

528
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:28,890
- Yin Yang Book.
- Han Ying.

529
00:38:28,890 --> 00:38:33,080
Han Ying! You have to hold on!

530
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:35,020
We'll find the Glazed Armor together,

531
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:38,220
open the Armory, and find Yin Yang Book.

532
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:40,130
Hold on! All right?

533
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:46,060
Who would've thought, the first time I visited Four Seasons Mountain Villa

534
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,070
would be in such a situation.

535
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:53,490
My Lord, to be able to die for you

536
00:38:53,490 --> 00:38:56,200
leaves me no regrets in this life.

537
00:38:59,410 --> 00:39:03,180
My Lord, take it.

538
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:08,040
It's all my fault. If I knew earlier that Glazed Armor could cure your injuries,

539
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:12,590
I would've been willing to risk everything to gather it. Too bad—

540
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,930
Han Ying!

541
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,650
A'Xu, have you forgotten?

542
00:39:23,650 --> 00:39:26,620
Great Shaman of Nanjiang is coming!

543
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:29,060
Wu Xi and Beiyuan are on their way!

544
00:39:29,060 --> 00:39:31,270
Han Ying, hold on for a bit longer!

545
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:34,560
Once they're here, they can definitely heal you!

546
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,020
Old Wen, I'll go down the mountain to find Ping An immediately.

547
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:40,690
We'll try to bring Great Shaman back quickly. Take care of Han Ying.

548
00:39:40,690 --> 00:39:44,020
I'll definitely find a way to protect Brother Han's life.

549
00:39:51,050 --> 00:39:53,060
Don't worry, Brother Han.

550
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,230
Not even the guardians of the underworld

551
00:39:55,230 --> 00:39:57,900
can take your soul.

552
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:39,200
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

553
00:40:40,630 --> 00:40:47,770
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

554
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:54,810
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

555
00:40:54,810 --> 00:41:02,560
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

556
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:10,430
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

557
00:41:10,430 --> 00:41:17,930
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

558
00:41:17,930 --> 00:41:21,860
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

559
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:25,330
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

560
00:41:25,330 --> 00:41:33,290
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

561
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:36,670
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

562
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:40,400
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

563
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:48,490
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

564
00:41:48,490 --> 00:41:51,960
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

565
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:55,720
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

566
00:41:55,720 --> 00:42:02,790
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

567
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:11,580
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
