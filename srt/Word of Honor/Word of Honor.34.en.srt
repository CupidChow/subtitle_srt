[Episode 34]

23
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,080
Elder Ye.

24
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,610
Elder Ye, you came just in time.

25
00:01:58,610 --> 00:02:01,280
Please lead us in destroying the Ghost Valley today!

26
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,110
That's right.

27
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:05,580
I will definitely destroy Ghost Valley.

28
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:09,270
Everyone in Ghost Valley must die.

29
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:14,130
Immortal Elder Ye, although the evil ghosts have brought harm upon the martial arts world,

30
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:18,940
this Master Wen has reasons to be forgiven.

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,160
Reasons to be forgiven?

32
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,480
From what I see, it's unforgivable!

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,790
Wen Kexing, when you became the Ghost Chief

34
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,120
and entered the Ghost Valley, why did you break the rule of

35
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,090
separating completely from the mortal realm

36
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:34,010
and allow evil ghosts to bring chaos to the martial arts world?

37
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,990
I acknowledge my sin.

38
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,110
Good. You should be punished for your sins.

39
00:02:45,110 --> 00:02:48,290
My punishment is that from now on, close Ghost Valley forever

40
00:02:48,290 --> 00:02:51,740
and restrain all evil ghosts from ever stepping into the mortal world.

41
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,650
Can you do that?

42
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,680
I will abide by your punishment.

43
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,840
Good. Go on then.

44
00:03:01,610 --> 00:03:04,750
Elder Ye, wha-what is the meaning of this?

45
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,100
What do you mean?

46
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:09,890
I told Wen Kexing to

47
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:13,010
seal Mount Qingya forever and forbid entry or departure.

48
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:15,890
A hundred years later, everything will be forgotten.

49
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,750
All the evil ghosts will have passed onto their next lives.

50
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,750
Wouldn't Ghost Valley have naturally disappeared then?

51
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:21,770
Marvelous! Marvelous!

52
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:23,780
If no massacre is created

53
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,680
and no swords are drawn to resolve this immense hatred,

54
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,870
that is an immeasurable merit indeed.

55
00:03:31,870 --> 00:03:33,670
Good.

56
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:37,040
It seems Abbot of Shaolin approves of my method.

57
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,890
How about you, Little Nun?

58
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:44,560
If Ghost Valley Chief Wen can truly restrict the evil ghosts from committing sins

59
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,290
and grow old in Mount Qingya,

60
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,970
this is naturally better than taking an eye for an eye and losing countless lives.

61
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:53,900
Did you hear everything, Wen Kexing?

62
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,800
What are you standing here for? Hurry and leave!

63
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,280
Yes.

64
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:12,560
All right. All right, all right!

65
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,200
The Heroes Conference ends here. Disperse!

66
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:20,300
- Amitabha.
- Immortal Elder Ye.

67
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,230
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

68
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:42,390
Let's go.

69
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:00,080
Master, you're too horrible!

70
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,400
Did you even know? I almost went blind from crying in these past few days!

71
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,840
Shouldn't you be punished?

72
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,090
I accept punishment. I'll drink.

73
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,760
Master, there's something I haven't been able to understand.

74
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,650
That old sick ghoul said you—

75
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,010
That Zhou Xu

76
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:19,500
said he personally saw your spiritless body at the Five Lakes Alliance.

77
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,080
That was a body I prepared early on.

78
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,040
I altered the appearance to match mine

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:26,290
and let it rest below the deep waterfalls.

80
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:30,810
If it wasn't so, how could I trick that old fox, Zhao Jing?

81
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:33,880
You're so sly!

82
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,620
I'm punishing you to drink another cup!

83
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:37,980
I accept.

84
00:05:39,650 --> 00:05:42,970
Gu Xiang, you must use tactics to win against a villain.

85
00:05:42,970 --> 00:05:45,060
What's wrong with that?

86
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:49,690
Sect Leader Shen, weren't you the one who was adamant about destroying Ghost Valley?

87
00:05:49,690 --> 00:05:53,060
When did you two side with each other?

88
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:06,490
Wen Kexing, you still dare to come and see Chengling?

89
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,350
The world already knows your identity!

90
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:11,600
You are the Ghost Valley Chief?

91
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:16,880
That‘s right. I am.

92
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:22,030
I came today to tell you everything.

93
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,190
Afterward, you can decide whether or not you want to believe me.

94
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:32,720
So you two colluded and became allies long ago?

95
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,170
Master, you only left us few in the dark!

96
00:06:36,170 --> 00:06:38,100
I'm punishing you for another cup!

97
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:48,330
Stupid girl! Faking death is a dangerous move.

98
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:52,830
If I didn't have Chengling and Sect Leader Shen helping me, how could I dare to act this way?

99
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,960
Only Sect Leader Shen's cooperation

100
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,890
made Zhao Jing and the others unable to easily approach

101
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,680
and discover any oddities.

102
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,490
Then, that Sword Immortal was also helping you?

103
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:07,130
Him? He has helped me a lot.

104
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:09,450
If it weren't for Elder Ye's generous support,

105
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:12,190
even if I could uncover Zhao Jing's treachery,

106
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:16,620
how could I have left completely unscathed given my identity?

107
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,480
I already said. If I ever saw you in the martial arts world again, I would—

108
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:25,260
I know.

109
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,990
Elder Ye, I was born with a radical personality and went astray.

110
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,720
I spent half of my life blinded by hatred.

111
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,290
I only thought about scheming and burning the world.

112
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:42,080
I almost failed my parents' teachings.

113
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,960
Now, I finally understand who my true enemy is.

114
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:50,170
I only want to fight him fairly and return innocence to the world.

115
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:52,450
I beg for your permission, Elder.

116
00:07:54,950 --> 00:07:57,960
That's right. I was most worried about

117
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,850
how Kexing would conclude this. Later, I thought about it and

118
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,780
I can't worry about so many things.

119
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:05,980
As long as I can clear away the false accusations against my Eldest Brother and the others,

120
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,900
Kexing and I might as well die in battle at the very end.

121
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,930
That would count as dying powerfully to uphold justice for my brothers.

122
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:13,760
Uncle.

123
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,570
Anyway, thank goodness we had a master like Elder Ye there

124
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:23,300
to end this feud in peace and bring satisfaction.

125
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,510
Here. Let's all give a toast to Elder Ye.

126
00:08:26,510 --> 00:08:28,800
A toast to Elder Ye.

127
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,390
Master.

128
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,010
Sir Wen, I believe myself to be resourceful and cunning,

129
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:47,480
yet I can only admit defeat to your strategy.

130
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,780
Zishu,

131
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:52,550
your junior brother is certainly as capable as, if not more so, than his master.

132
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:55,460
Sir Wen, a toast to you.

133
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,820
Sir Wen, I'm confused about one thing.

134
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:06,420
That man by the surname of Zhao is so evil,

135
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,720
so why wouldn't you take his life?

136
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,010
That was my promise to the Scorpion King.

137
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:14,720
Young Lady Gao's Senior, Deng Kuan, was always in his hands.

138
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,660
He was transformed into a Drug Man with a muddled consciousness.

139
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:22,170
During the first Heroes Conference, Deng Kuan's false accusation was what decided everything.

140
00:09:22,170 --> 00:09:25,100
That is what caused Supreme Leader Gao to suffer injustice.

141
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:28,570
In contrast, to prove Zhao Jing's scheme,

142
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:31,710
this person's testimony was extremely important.

143
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:35,400
Scorpion King agreed to restore Deng Kuan's consciousness.

144
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:40,610
In return, the one condition was that I would spare Zhao Jing's life.

145
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:44,790
What's the relationship between Scorpion King and Zhao Jing?

146
00:09:44,790 --> 00:09:47,810
Didn't Scorpion King agree to work with you

147
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,820
because he hates Zhao Jing?

148
00:09:51,690 --> 00:09:53,400
Old sick ghoul, did you know

149
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:56,340
Scorpion King used bewitching poison to control the Top Ten Evil Ghosts?

150
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:58,270
Master agreed to collaborate with the Scorpion King

151
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,370
- all because he wanted to borrow soldiers to get to the Window of Heaven in time—
- A'Xiang.

152
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:07,270
Did this Scorpion King help you so much just to save Zhao Jing's life?

153
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,640
Sir Wen, what else did you promise him?

154
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,780
It's nothing much.

155
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:14,170
To be honest,

156
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,990
the only thing that can destroy the ghost realm is the human heart.

157
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:22,300
As expected, fate does like fooling with people.

158
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:26,330
My junior brother's revenge is complete and can finally live a carefree life.

159
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,290
Yet I... don't have much time left.

160
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,750
Leave.

161
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,410
Father.

162
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:15,740
I've told you before.

163
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,870
You can't lie to me.

164
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,270
The truth was that as long as you asked,

165
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:29,430
there was nothing I wouldn't have done.

166
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,460
You didn't have to lie to me.

167
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:34,060
All these years,

168
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:37,420
how many people have died under your schemes?

169
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,630
People who loved with you all their hearts included.

170
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,220
How can I not constantly think that one day,

171
00:11:46,220 --> 00:11:49,380
I would share the same downfall?

172
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:57,050
It's just that one can never wake a person faking slumber.

173
00:11:58,180 --> 00:12:02,420
Only because I refused to think and was willing to be tricked,

174
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,110
did I have so many years of filial piety toward you.

175
00:12:13,490 --> 00:12:16,060
I never told you

176
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:19,410
that I think your goal was very silly.

177
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,750
Supreme Leader of the martial arts world?

178
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,930
What's great about that?

179
00:12:28,670 --> 00:12:32,720
You always said that my research of Drug Men was an occult practice.

180
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
That the world would not accept it.

181
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,370
In consideration of our father-son relationship, I never disobeyed you.

182
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,260
Today, I will tell you

183
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,700
what the true skill of a ten-thousand kill is.

184
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,380
The Window of Heaven that you considered so impressive is now my ally.

185
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:50,950
Even Prince Jin must treat me with extra respect.

186
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:55,460
Yet you look down on me and treat me carelessly.

187
00:12:55,460 --> 00:13:00,590
You hurt me over some scum that has no right to even carry my shoes!

188
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:02,490
Why?

189
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:05,480
Just because I respect you, love you?

190
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:07,300
Just because I'm taken for granted?

191
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,340
Just because I'm worth nothing?

192
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:21,690
Did you think

193
00:13:21,690 --> 00:13:24,570
becoming Supreme Leader of the martial arts world

194
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:27,270
would ascend you into the heavens?

195
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:31,260
I agreed to collaborate with Wen Kexing

196
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:35,340
just to make you fail

197
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,240
at your proudest moment.

198
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,990
Just to prove to you

199
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:44,160
that whether I will destroy you,

200
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,190
how I will destroy you,

201
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:49,180
all depend on my whim!

202
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,000
Never mind.

203
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,660
Why did you have to be my father?

204
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,390
You are so unsightly,

205
00:14:27,210 --> 00:14:29,050
but...

206
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:36,120
you are the only relative I have left in this world.

207
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:41,200
I am just not willing to accept it.

208
00:14:43,660 --> 00:14:46,140
I originally had the chance

209
00:14:46,140 --> 00:14:48,930
to win over this world

210
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:52,500
and present it to you just for your smile.

211
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,610
But you...

212
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,470
just had to choose incorrectly.

213
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:16,770
I gave you chances.

214
00:15:17,860 --> 00:15:21,210
I gave you many, many chances.

215
00:15:23,030 --> 00:15:25,080
It was you...

216
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:29,210
who failed me.

217
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:27,640
Father, you schemed for half your life.

218
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:30,590
How monotonous.

219
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:32,470
From now on,

220
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,200
just enjoy a carefree life.

221
00:16:47,370 --> 00:16:49,130
I...

222
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,980
will take good care of you.

223
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:55,580
Okay?

224
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:14,750
Father,

225
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:19,620
I will let you personally see

226
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:25,060
how I rise up and become king.

227
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:28,190
At that time, if I'm in a good mood,

228
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:30,830
I'll kill that little Prince Jin

229
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:34,360
and make myself emperor.

230
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:39,100
I'll give you the title of the emperor's father.

231
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:49,290
This is the true great cause.

232
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:19,780
Master, allow me to courageously

233
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,040
punish you with this cup of wine.

234
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:24,760
You knew of Junior Master's identity and suffering early on.

235
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:27,040
Why didn't you just tell me directly?

236
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:31,530
Did you not believe in me or did you not believe in my relationship with Junior Master?

237
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,260
I also played a part. I'll accompany him in drinking.

238
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:43,110
Here.

239
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:52,400
A'Xu, our Chengling is all grown up now.

240
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,710
In just a few days, he's already grasped the mechanics behind the Dragon Pool Cabinet.

241
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,950
Thankfully, Chengling used mechanical skills

242
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:02,690
to alter the Piercing Rain needles, substantially decreasing its force.

243
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:06,190
This allowed my fake death to succeed.

244
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:12,270
So your plan was for my disciple

245
00:19:12,270 --> 00:19:15,330
to use the self-defense weapon I gave him to kill you, right in front of my eyes?

246
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:18,790
Why didn't you tell me before? Because you didn't believe in me or—

247
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,500
Brother Zhou,

248
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,360
allow me to explain for Kexing.

249
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,920
He created the fake death plan to lower Zhao Jing's guard.

250
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:29,560
Only by doing so could he

251
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,260
bring all of the evidence to the Heroes Conference in one final strike,

252
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,900
revealing Zhao Jing's treachery in front of the world

253
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:39,810
and exonerating everyone who he harmed and killed.

254
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,940
It's also my fault. I told Sir Wen

255
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:46,820
that your injuries were worrisome and required careful care,

256
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,830
meaning it was inadvisable to use martial arts.

257
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,510
Did I ask you all? Sit down first.

258
00:20:04,310 --> 00:20:08,020
Let me ask you. Should you be punished?

259
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,980
I should.

260
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:14,470
A'Xu, how do you want to punish me?

261
00:20:17,450 --> 00:20:19,410
Drink 3 flasks.

262
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:35,660
A'Xu... A'Xu...

263
00:20:36,330 --> 00:20:39,120
A'Xu! Where are you?

264
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:42,630
Why is it so dark? A'Xu...

265
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:55,020
A'Xu! Where are you?

266
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:58,390
Let me tell you. Tonight,

267
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,240
I got all of them drunk!

268
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:03,380
I'm so happy!

269
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:04,840
What nonsense are you saying?

270
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,740
A'Xu...

271
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,930
I'm so happy tonight. Listen...

272
00:21:11,930 --> 00:21:16,580
The last time when I was drinking with that old monster,

273
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,780
I was actually really sad.

274
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:22,250
I was afraid that you...

275
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:26,540
afraid that you couldn't live for much longer. I was afraid that you

276
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:33,170
wouldn't accept me. Afraid that I had no right to be your good brother.

277
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:37,280
But now everything's fine.

278
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:41,510
Here! Drink with me! Let's have a toast!

279
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,470
Drink wine! A'Xu!

280
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:48,320
I'm so happy...

281
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,410
You don't know.

282
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:56,780
I was actually going to destroy this world

283
00:21:57,510 --> 00:21:59,960
and destroy myself.

284
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,790
Thankfully, I met you.

285
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:09,000
Turns out that living righteously as a human was so relaxing.

286
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:13,490
In all my years of life, I've never been so carefree

287
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:15,650
or so happy!

288
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,990
Right now, I just think

289
00:22:19,990 --> 00:22:23,250
my parents and our master,

290
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:26,430
actually all wished for me to do this.

291
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:32,430
Right now, it seems like as soon as I close my eyes,

292
00:22:33,880 --> 00:22:38,830
I can see them smiling at me.

293
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:50,000
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

294
00:22:50,550 --> 00:22:54,020
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

295

of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

301
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:21,570
Once we marry off A'Xiang,

302
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:28,520
I want to go find... that little house and garden.

303
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:33,820
My parents' bodies were left in the wild back then.

304
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:37,000
They didn't even have a memorial plaque.

305
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,870
I am not filial.

306
00:23:41,510 --> 00:23:43,560
It's been twenty years already.

307
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:47,370
I've never gone back to see them.

308

but now I have you.

311
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:04,030
Accompany me.

312
00:24:04,030 --> 00:24:06,310
Accompany me to go see them, all right?

♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

314
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:14,000
All right. I will accompany you.

315
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:18,200

Greetings, Uncle Zhou.

322
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:56,010
Go finish your business. Don't delay Lady Xiang's auspicious time.

323
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:57,960
Yes, sir.

324
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:01,050
Uncle Zhou?

325
00:26:01,050 --> 00:26:03,010
Are they calling me that?

326
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:09,660
Master! Uncle Zhou!

327
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:12,260
I had just been thinking. The name "Uncle Zhou"

328
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:15,500
must've been thought up by some bizarre little girl.

329
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:18,260
It wasn't me! It was Eldest Brother Cao's idea.

330
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,310
Master told me not to call you an old sick ghoul

331
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:22,050
or A'Xu.

332
00:26:22,050 --> 00:26:23,650
So what could I do?

333
00:26:23,650 --> 00:26:25,930
You are the Ghost Valley Chief's senior brother,

334
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,120
so I'll call you "Uncle!"

335
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,630
Can't you call me "Brother"?

336
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,570
The name Uncle Zhou makes it sound like

337
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:34,020
I've got a face full of beard hair!

338
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:36,110
I-I told him! He wouldn't listen!

339
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:39,020
When did I disagree?

340
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:42,240
Fine! I'll call him that then!

341
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:44,820
Brother Zishu!

342
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,130
You stupid girl!

343
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:48,350
You're almost married, yet you're still so mischievous?

344
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:50,810
Aunt Luo's been so busy over your dowry.

345
00:26:50,810 --> 00:26:52,540
Why aren't you helping?

346
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:57,180
What girl prepares her own dowry for marriage? Isn't that embarrassing?

347
00:26:57,180 --> 00:27:00,010
Then it's true that if you live long enough, you can witness anything.

348
00:27:00,010 --> 00:27:01,720
You finally understand what it feels like to be embarrassed?

349
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,840
What a coincidence! I feel the same!

350
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,550
I've never seen a certain someone

351
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:08,710
so obedient and timid.

352
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,250
Master! Junior Master!

353
00:27:15,250 --> 00:27:17,710
Miss Bride? Why are you still running around?

354
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:20,500
Aren't the newlyweds not supposed to meet before the ceremony?

355
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:22,180
Mind your own business!

356
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:25,460
So fierce. Eldest Brother Cao, aren't you going to manage your wife?

357
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:28,740
No, no. I can't manage her.

358
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:31,470
I guess so. When you're living under the same roof, you have to accept some things.

359
00:27:31,470 --> 00:27:33,270
Don't be afraid. Once you're married,

360
00:27:33,270 --> 00:27:35,930
- come to Four Seasons Mountain Villa and I'll support you.
- I—

361
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:37,180
Little brat,

362
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:40,730
after a few days of not meeting, you've grown much braver.

363
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,580
All right. You continue talking.

364
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:44,720
It's my first time coming to Ghost Valley. I'm going to look around.

365
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,520
- I'll go with you.
- I'll see you in a bit, Brother Zishu! Hey!

366
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:48,340
Master!

367
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:51,650
Do I really have to go to Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

368
00:27:51,650 --> 00:27:53,210
I want to stay with you.

369
00:27:53,210 --> 00:27:56,520
What married girl remains in her parents' home?

370
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,520
Then I won't get married.

371
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,190
You go back to Kunzhou by yourself.

372
00:28:00,190 --> 00:28:01,690
I want to stay with my master.

373
00:28:01,690 --> 00:28:04,190
- A'Xiang!
- Nonsense!

374
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:06,030
Young Cao gave up everything for you.

375
00:28:06,030 --> 00:28:08,970
You're no longer allowed to act arrogant just because you're spoiled. Understand?

376
00:28:08,970 --> 00:28:12,380
Once your marriage is over, I will seal off the valley.

377
00:28:12,380 --> 00:28:15,390
Do you spoil me? Am I arrogant?

378
00:28:15,390 --> 00:28:17,820
You are really going to seal the valley?

379
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:20,410
I personally promised Elder Ye

380
00:28:20,410 --> 00:28:22,020
that I would use my power

381
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:25,190
to subdue the 3,000 ghosts and have them age and die in Mount Qingya.

382
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:28,200
I can't break my promise, nor do I want to.

383
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,150
The heavens once treated me poorly,

384
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,100
yet they also gave me a priceless gift.

385
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:36,820
This settles the score between Heaven and me.

386
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,620
We are both taking a step back.

387
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,680
- A'Xiang. A'Xiang!
- Master...

388
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:47,290
What's wrong? If you're sad,

389
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:49,110
how about I— how about—

390
00:28:49,110 --> 00:28:51,500
Idiot!

391
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:54,280
I won't make you do anything against your will.

392
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:56,450
I'm just...

393
00:28:56,450 --> 00:28:58,360
I'm happy for Master.

394
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,160
Master, I'm really happy for you.

395
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:06,690
Stupid girl, I will remain here to subdue the ghosts,

396
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:08,680
but I never said I would be here every day.

397
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,090
I can secretly run out to visit you.

398
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:14,050
After a few years, when the valley is peaceful,

399
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:16,250
won't everything be well?

400
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:22,250
Chengling, Changing Ghost and his subordinates

401
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:24,190
have been held in Hantan Water Dungeon.

402
00:29:24,190 --> 00:29:26,190
They are the last people you have vengeance against.

403
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:28,850
How do you plan to deal with them?

404
00:29:28,850 --> 00:29:31,710
Junior Master, how were you originally planning to deal with them?

405
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,660
I...

406
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,860
I don't want to be stained with blood again, so I have only imprisoned them.

407
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:44,070
Hantan Water Dungeon... that sounds like a very uncomfortable place, isn't it?

408
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:45,690
Then let's just keep them there

409
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:48,430
and have them regret their own sins.

410
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:51,380
That's it?

411
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:56,530
Even if we kill these people, the past can't be changed.

412
00:29:56,530 --> 00:30:00,660
Master said that eyes are grown in front, so you should look in front of you.

413
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,860
Anyways, it's Sister Xiang's lucky day!

414
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,300
How can we kill people?

415
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:08,070
I was wondering why Master always called Brother Zishu "Saint Zhou."

416
00:30:08,070 --> 00:30:10,690
Look at that! He's cultivated a little saint!

417
00:30:10,690 --> 00:30:12,810
- He speaks with such logic!
- Elder Ye says

418
00:30:12,810 --> 00:30:14,190
Ghost Valley was originally created

419
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:17,060
to build a stairway to Heaven in an endless oblivion

420
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,830
to give the souls who had descended into evil

421
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:20,770
a chance to change and better themselves.

422
00:30:20,770 --> 00:30:24,110
Right. Old monste—

423
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,560
Where did Elder Ye go?

424
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,320
Elder Ye said he was going to bring Elder Rong's remains

425
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,650
back to Changming Mountain to be buried with his parents.

426
00:30:41,550 --> 00:30:44,800
Good soup! Waiter!

427
00:30:46,270 --> 00:30:48,050
Customer, would you like to pay the bill

428
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,360
or have another bowl of noodles?

429
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:50,290
I'll have two more bowls.

430
00:30:50,290 --> 00:30:53,480
Two bowls? All right, all right! Coming right up!

431
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,500
Even the immortal decay.

432
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:10,780
This day has finally arrived.

433
00:31:13,990 --> 00:31:17,770
What immortal? Just a living dead.

434
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:20,880
I don't know how long I've lived,

435
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,980
yet only these days where I've lived for death

436
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,190
have been somewhat interesting.

437
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:31,350
Here are your noodles. Enjoy.

438
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:34,200
These noodles are nice.

439
00:31:34,790 --> 00:31:36,230
Changqing.

440
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,610
Xuan'er. I'll eat two more bowls for you two.

441
00:32:06,750 --> 00:32:08,590
Lady Xiang looks beautiful.

442
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,940
Your husband is so fortunate.

443
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,320
Am I really beautiful?

444
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,080
Of course! Like a goddess.

445
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:20,920
Who would've thought our valley would ever hold a wedding?

446
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:24,490
Seeing Lady Xiang like this makes me also want to get married.

447
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:26,270
Me too! Me too!

448
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:28,940
Don't make fun of me!

449
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:32,060
Lady Xiang! Lady Xiang! Your true happiness comes later!

450
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:34,290
Let's go look at the dowry we prepared for you!

451
00:32:34,290 --> 00:32:35,930
Okay! Let's go.

452
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,530
Let's go.

453
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,590
Wow!

454
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,890
Wow!

455
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:14,240
So much?

456
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:20,600
Didn't I say that I would prepare three streets of dowry for your wedding?

457
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:24,400
This is far from enough. I will slowly give the rest to you in the future.

458
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,800
We were in a rush, but we've finally assembled your dowry together.

459
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:33,800
I didn't know that marrying someone would require so much attention to detail,

460
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:37,800
such as the arrangements of baby buckets and bowls and dress wear.
(T/N: Baby buckets and bowls are prepared by the families of the newlyweds and represent blessings for healthy offspring and harmonious marriage)

461
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:40,200
A'Xiang, thanks to you,

462
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,000
I've expanded my worldview.

463
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,800
What do you know? If she truly did pay attention to detail,

464
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:50,200
this dowry should have everything the girl needed,

465
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,000
from her birth to her death.

466
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,800
If this wedding girl was truly particular about customs,

467
00:33:55,800 --> 00:34:00,000
then even the funeral garments and coffins would be prepared.

468
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:05,600
However, Sir Wen, I don't know what happened to you.

469
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,300
A girl only gets married once in her life.

470
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:13,700
I don't understand why you were in such a rush to hold it.

471
00:34:13,700 --> 00:34:15,200
Aunt Luo. Sister Qianqiao.

472
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,400
Having you two overseeing my marriage makes me happier than anything!

473
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:22,000
What? My presence doesn't make you happy?

474
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,700
I'm happy!

475
00:34:23,700 --> 00:34:25,200
Ungrateful.

476
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,800
Wait here! I have another gift for you.

477
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,300
All right.

478
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:34,400
Xiang'er, after I finish preparing your dowry,

479
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:38,600
I will take a stroll around the back of the mountain. I won't be attending your wedding.

480
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,500
Sister Qianqiao will take care of everything in my place.

481
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,800
I've prepared a dowry for you.

482
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,400
This pair of hairpins

483
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,000
was given to me by my master when I was getting married.

484
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:05,400
Now, I will gift them to you.

485
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,000
However, don't worry.

486
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,700
Don't look down on them for being stained with bad luck.

487
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:12,600
I haven't used these hairpins before. They were my master's.

488
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,200
My master had a lovely marriage with many children.

489
00:35:18,700 --> 00:35:21,800
I don't want it! I don't care.

490
00:35:21,800 --> 00:35:26,200
Aunt Luo, you have to see me off.

491
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,700
I can't.

492
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,500
This pertains to your happy marriage. It's for the rest of your life.

493
00:35:32,500 --> 00:35:36,500
No matter how cautious I am, it is still not enough.

494
00:35:36,500 --> 00:35:40,300
Xiang'er, listen to me.

495
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,800
Once the valley is sealed,

496
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,200
I really don't know

497
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,300
when I can see you again.

498
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,400
I don't care.

499
00:35:56,400 --> 00:36:00,800
Aunt Luo, put them on for me.

500
00:36:04,990 --> 00:36:08,220
You have to see me get married.

501
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,080
I can't.

502
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,990
Listen to me, all right?

503
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,800
Good A'Xiang, be obedient.

504
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,800
We are doing this for your sake.

505
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Get married with no worries.

506
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,200
Your Aunt Luo has me by her side.

507
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:28,100
I will stay with Master for the rest of my life.

508
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,800
Listen.

509
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:42,900
You're so beautiful.

510
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:50,400
Sister Qianqiao, you aren't leaving the valley either?

511
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,200
Then, you don't want Yu Qiufeng anymore?

512
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,670
Who is Yu Qiufeng?

513
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,600
A'Xiang!

514
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:06,520
Master.

515
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,000
This is Great Shaman's gift.

516
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:12,400
The world only has this one pair of red bracelets.

517
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:14,600
It's a divine artifact blessed with prayers.

518
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:17,400
I heard that once lovers tie this on,

519
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,600
they will meet for all their lifetimes. Young Cao has already tied his.

520
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,200
Here, I will tie yours on.

521
00:37:26,200 --> 00:37:28,800
Meet for all of our lifetimes?

522
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:31,400
Then what if I get tired of living with Cao Weining in this life

523
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,900
and want to switch to someone else in my next life?

524
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,000
Who knows? If you don't want to tie it on, I can just return it to Great Shaman.

525
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,930
No! I want it, I want it!

526
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:41,800
Tie it on for me.

527
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,000
Is it pretty?

528
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:53,600
It is.

529
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,600
Look at how nervous Young Cao looks.

530
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:10,600
Chengling, don't act like him once you grow up.

531
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:17,000
Before Sumpreme Leader Gao's death, didn't he say he would pair Gao Xiaolian with you?

532
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,000
What? Do you like her?

533
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,100
If you do, I will help you ask for her hand in marriage.

534
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,410
Master! What are you saying?

535
00:38:23,410 --> 00:38:25,400
I see Xiaolian as an elder sister.

536
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:29,000
Why do you seem in such a rush to send everyone off?

537
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:41,000
Eldest Brother Cao, how does it feel to be a groom?

538
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,400
Ner-Nervous...

539
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:45,800
Then, what are you thinking about right now?

540
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,600
I'm thinking...

541
00:38:50,990 --> 00:38:53,140
I've always wanted

542
00:38:54,100 --> 00:38:59,200
for Master and Junior Master to oversee my marriage.

543
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,600
My brothers would all be beside me.

544
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:03,000
I...

545
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:07,800
I never even dreamed that I would get married in Ghost Valley

546
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:11,500
or that I would be marrying someone precious to the Ghost Valley Chief.

547
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:15,400
I can't believe I forgot!

548
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,800
Eldest Brother Cao, Sect Leader Shen met your junior master and already told him

549
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:21,210
of your marriage.

550
00:39:21,210 --> 00:39:22,500
He—

551
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,200
What did he say?

552
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,600
It's all my fault. There were too many things, so I forgot to tell you.

553
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,300
Your junior master said,

554
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:34,600
"You unfilial little brat, remember what is right from wrong,

555
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:38,000
and evil from kindness. Since things have come to this,

556
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:41,800
I only hope that you can perform acts of philanthropy with your wife.

557
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:45,200
Then, I will not have taught you for nothing.

558
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,600
As for your Master, I will slowly convince him.

559
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,630
In the future, if you sire a plump little boy,

560
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:54,900
remember to bring him to see me."

561
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:59,800
I cannot repay Junior Master's immeasurable favor!

562
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:02,800
I-I am unfilial and ungrateful.

563
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
Eldest Brother Cao! Get up quickly!

564
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:10,030
I was wondering how that old fox, Mo Huaiyang,

565
00:40:10,030 --> 00:40:12,200
could've cultivated such a big rabbit.

566
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,400
It seems your junior master is a clear-headed person.

567
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,600
Weining, since the grudges between the righteous and evil are settled,

568
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:20,800
one day, everything will become peaceful.

569
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,970
Groom!

570
00:40:25,200 --> 00:40:26,600
What is it?

571
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:28,100
There is a crowd of people outside

572
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:30,020
saying they are from your sect. They are here to congratulate you.

573
00:40:30,020 --> 00:40:32,200
Are you going to confirm it?

574
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
What?

575
00:41:11,400 --> 00:41:14,700
Lady Xiang, the auspicious time is approaching! The bride and groom cannot meet yet!

576
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:19,000
You know, too? They-They've agreed?

577
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:22,400
It's Junior Master! Junior Master must've managed to convince Master!

578
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,000
He treats me the best!

579
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:28,500
He must understand that if they aren't here, I will regret it for the rest of my life.

580
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,800
Master! Master, Master, Master!

581
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:37,200
Master! Can I let them in to watch our ceremony?

582
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:41,000
Junior Master Fan and the others were absolutely wonderful to me when I was at Gentle Wind Sword Sect!

583
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:43,600
They also let me go and helped me escape!

584
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,000
They really are good people!

585
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:55,020
Uncle Zhou!

586
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:57,700
What did you call me?

587
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:00,540
Brother!

588
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,690
Too bad I am not the valley chief.

589
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:08,800
I can't make this decision.

590
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:13,200
Old Wen, they've already set aside their pride to come and congratulate them.

591
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,800
In the past, Chengling also said that this Junior Master Fan

592
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:20,800
spoke kindly with Sect Leader Shen.

593
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,000
How about you just grant the wish of these two children?

594
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,860
Do whatever you want.

595
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,800
Won't you hurry and go?

596
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,200
Lady A'Xiang, the people outside claim to be the groom's sect members.

597
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,200
Open the door, open the door! They really are from his sect!

598
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,600
Yes!

599
00:42:54,600 --> 00:42:56,600
Open the door for our guests!

600
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,600
Please enter, Sect Leader Mo!

601
00:43:37,400 --> 00:43:39,600
I'll take you to look around!

602
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:41,800
Let's go! You're also here?

603
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,400
Here, here, here!

604
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:49,200
Congratulations, Senior Brother.

605
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,500
Thank you.

606
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,800
- Senior Brother.
- Please come in.

607
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,600
Please come in.

608
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,200
Congratulations.

609
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:25,000
Where's Junior Master? Senior Mo isn't here either.

610
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:28,000
Master! You've come?

611
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:32,800
- Maste—
- She

612
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:36,600
is the evil woman who you eloped with?

613
00:45:10,470 --> 00:45:16,850
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

614
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:24,200
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

615
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:32,400
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

616
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:39,400
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

617
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:46,950
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

618
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:55,400
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

619
00:45:55,400 --> 00:46:03,000
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

620
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:10,800
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

621
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:18,000
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

622
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:26,000
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

623
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:33,200
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

624
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:40,200
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

625
00:46:40,200 --> 00:46:47,900
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
