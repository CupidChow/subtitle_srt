by the Five Lakes Alliance and other heroes,

00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,450
he left behind an armory that could make someone become invincible overnight.

26
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:10,849
However, in order to open the armory, one must first find the Glazed Armor.

27
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:15,649
Afterwards, the nursery rhyme spread across the land, causing various forces to start

yearning for control over the armory's treasures

that Prince Jin requested of me when I first created the Window of Heaven.

Once you enter the Window of Heaven, you cannot leave.

You know that.

Even if I can only live freely for one day,

114

it's still better than continuing to be Prince Jin's running dog.

Over the years, we've followed the Mountain Villa through thick and thin.

I did everything you asked me to.

However, the members of our Four Seasons Mountain Villa were continuously persecuted.

120
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,390
It made me unable to not begin questioning Prince Jin's intentions.

121

Now that we have come this far, I really cannot continue.

No ordinary person can endure the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns.

Brother Zhang, what exactly are the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns?

The Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns promises death in three years.

Once you are pierced with these nails,

you will not only lose your martial arts,

but you will also slowly start to lose your five senses.

In the beginning, you will be unable to speak,

142

Then, you will become insentient.

Only this way will you be unable to leak the secrets of the Window of Heaven outside.

Although you become a cripple, you still understand what happened.

You are allowed to live for three years before it's lights out for you!

146

Th-Then why would anyone want to suffer through that?

Wouldn't it be better to just die?

Look at you. Would they really let you die so easily?

This is the rule of the Window of Heaven.

If one day, you lose your mind and don't want to stay here anymore,

No, no, no! Leader.

162
00:17:33,317 --> 00:17:34,999
I'm sorry.

163
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,169
I thought all of the elders referred to you like that.

164
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,219
The last member of the Four Seasons Mountain VIlla is gone.

165
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:45,480
Don't ever say "My Lord" again.

Ten years on this path of no return.

170
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:18,389
I remember each and every face of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa members who died in front of me.

171
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:20,169
They're all dead.

172

I am the lone survivor.

173
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:24,660
Why?

174
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:26,410
Of course, it's because I don't deserve a good death.

175
00:18:26,410 --> 00:18:28,669
It serves me right to keep living.

The Leader of the Window of Heaven.

I am above hundreds of thousands of men and only below one.

I live showing off my military power like this,

Have his injuries still not healed?
[Prince Jin]

Your Highness.

188
00:19:13,330 --> 00:19:18,650
The treacherous official has rallied many people who are skilled at martial arts.

189
00:19:18,650 --> 00:19:20,370
Leader hadn't fought anyone for a long time.

190
00:19:20,370 --> 00:19:23,889
This incident must have aggravated his internal injuries again.

191
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:26,829
He has been resting in isolation for the past few days.

192
00:19:26,830 --> 00:19:31,950
How long has it been since he spat blood and fainted

at the news of Qin Jiuxiao's death?

194
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:36,790
About a year, right?

195
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,059
Your Highness.

196
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,499
Yes.

197
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,889
He becomes like this just for Qin Jiuxiao.

198
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:44,059
He won't be of great use.

199
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:46,930
Tell him to come to see me as soon as possible.

200

[Chongming Court]

The flowers remain in all four seasons,

203

knowing everything in the world.

204

Eighty-one of our brothers came to Jinzhou with you.

00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:17,610
Now it's just you and me.

206

Even Jiuxiao is dead.

207
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,720
How can Four Seasons Mountain Villa still remain?

208
00:20:38,330 --> 00:20:40,889
In order to leave the Window of Heaven,

209
00:20:40,890 --> 00:20:43,670
I spent a year and a half

210
00:20:43,670 --> 00:20:47,350
inserting the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns in my body.

211
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,990
There are actually two ways to insert the nails.

212
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:55,949
If you insert all seven nails in at once,

213
00:20:55,950 --> 00:20:58,889
the person being tortured will quickly lose his senses,

214
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,450
and he can only live as a cripple for three years.

215
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:07,499
However, if you insert one nail every three months

216
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,449
and let the nail gradually start to meld with your skin

217
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,109
and become part of your body,

218
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:15,889
you will still retain half of your martial arts skills

219
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,830
even though you will only have three years of life,

220
00:21:18,890 --> 00:21:21,820
and your senses will only disappear slowly

221
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:23,970
until death.

222
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:28,480
You just have to endure the extreme pain

223
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,440
that will last for three years and another 18 months.

224
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:38,059
Senior Brother, don't!

225
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,450
Jiuxiao?

226
00:21:43,800 --> 00:21:45,790
Why are you crying?

227
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:48,090
What's there to cry about?

228
00:21:48,090 --> 00:21:50,490
It's what I deserve.

229
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:58,090
The eighty-one brothers from Four Seasons Mountain Villa

230
00:21:58,090 --> 00:22:01,430
all died in my hands.

231
00:22:01,430 --> 00:22:04,270
Our heritage is terminated.

232
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:07,220
I couldn't protect a single one of you.

233
00:22:07,890 --> 00:22:13,250
I even killed your lover.

234
00:22:14,910 --> 00:22:16,720
After I die,

235
00:22:17,860 --> 00:22:20,870
how can I face you?

236
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:41,300
I wonder...

237
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,010
whether you and Princess Jing'an have met or not by now.

238
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:52,250
She's telling on me, right?

239
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:10,230
How could such an evil senior brother like me even exist?

240
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:15,190
How could my meeting gift with my sister-in-law

241
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,960
be a bottle of poison?

Greetings, Your Highness.

245
00:24:47,890 --> 00:24:49,690
Please get up.

246
00:24:54,770 --> 00:25:00,070
You really don't look well. Get some rest.

247
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:02,260
You are a pillar of this country.

248
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,729
I need your help to achieve my goals.

249
00:25:05,729 --> 00:25:08,710
I was an ordinary man in Jianghu,

250
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,330
only fit to be your weapon.

251
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,150
Now that Hedong is peaceful,

252
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:16,280
you need people who know about government to help you.

253
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:22,730
I can only fight... and can't be of great help to you.

254
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:33,500
Zishu, what do you mean by this?

255
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:17,609
Zishu!

256
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:19,829
My will has broken.

257
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,330
My wounds are not recovering and I cannot be a big help.

258
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:26,030
My bones yearn to go home.

259
00:26:26,030 --> 00:26:28,720
I've already left the Window of Heaven.

260
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:34,779
I asked myself for the punishment of the Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns,

261
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:37,650
and I applied it to myself.

262
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:43,220
These nails... I've already inserted six of them.

263
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,790
If I insert one more, I'm afraid I won't get to say goodbye to you.

264
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:54,209
I hope you can consider the merit of my hard work, even if I have no merit of any achievements,

265
00:26:54,209 --> 00:26:56,779
and fulfill my wishes.

266
00:26:56,780 --> 00:26:58,580
Good.

267
00:27:01,220 --> 00:27:03,260
Very good.

268
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:08,179
Zhou Zishu, no wonder you're the Leader of the Window of Heaven.

269
00:27:08,179 --> 00:27:12,520
You're cruel and decisive, even willing to hurt yourself like this.

270
00:27:17,130 --> 00:27:18,950
Your Highness, please calm down.

271
00:27:18,950 --> 00:27:21,850
Since you don't want to live, I could've fulfilled you!

272
00:27:21,850 --> 00:27:24,820
Why would you go through so much trouble?

273
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:31,510
You saved my life.

274
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:38,630
If you allow it, I can drag this crippled body along for two extra years.

275
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:44,760
If you don't, then take my life.

276
00:28:04,610 --> 00:28:06,810
You all lied to me!

277
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:10,230

279
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:20,230
Beiyuan is gone, too.

280
00:28:22,070 --> 00:28:25,080
I'm really alone in this world now.

281
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,530
Zishu, you were lying to me, right?

282
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:36,450
If I spare you, are you willing to help me

283
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,360
to achieve my goals?

284
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:46,760
Please give me the last nail.

285
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,230
You'd rather be a cripple

286
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:54,750
than be my trusted official?

287
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,930
Fine!

288
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:01,500
I understand your intention now.

Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns, death in three years.

Zhou Zishu, you must live properly!

291

Three years.

292
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:20,179
Within three years, I will rule the nation and ascend the throne!

293
00:29:20,179 --> 00:29:23,660
I'm going to show you that I

294
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,610
am the chosen one,

295
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,520
and I will be successful no matter who I lose!

296
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:37,250
I will try my best.

297
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:46,270
Pengju, do as he says.

298
00:29:46,270 --> 00:29:50,800
From now on, you are the Leader of the Window of Heaven.

That treacherous Hanging Ghost

suddenly jumped off the cliff with a vine.

331
00:34:16,379 --> 00:34:20,160
We were caught off guard and could not stop him.

Useless!

Maybe he's a fool?

What's the point of sunbathing?

363

He's already so skinny.

364
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:30,570
If he keeps sitting in the sun, wouldn't he become dry?

Master, don't look down on me for not having as much experience in life.

He looks like he hasn't had a full meal for three years.

He may die at any moment, aren't I right?
