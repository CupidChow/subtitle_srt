[Episode 20]

23
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,480
- Uncle Long!
- Uncle Long.

24
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,400
Uncle Long, rest for a while.

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:04,510
It turns out the answer was so simple.

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:07,380
All parents,

27
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,510
naturally, want to give all of the best

28
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,940
to their children.

29
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:19,690
If they don't, it's naturally because they can't.

30
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:24,710
The divine will fool all. The divine will fool all!

31
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:29,970
Zishu, the right side of the bamboo tower on the map

32
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,890
has a single building, which is the library stack.

33
00:02:32,890 --> 00:02:35,460
Inside, there are two maps.

34
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,560
One is of the Dragon Pool Valley,

35
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:40,790
and the other is of the mechanisms in the armory.

36
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:46,980
Please transfer the latter to Elder Ye on my behalf.

37
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:54,050
In addition, I can't bear to abandon the Dragon Pool Cabinet's

38
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:57,170
ability to roam through the martial arts world and pass on their skills.

39
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:00,010
Therefore, I summarized it into two books,

40
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,930
which I also placed inside.

41
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:05,910
My disciples were all killed by Long Xiao.

42
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:10,990
For the sake of the sworn alliance between your master and me,

43
00:03:11,590 --> 00:03:14,490
help me find a successor.

44
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:18,410
Uncle Long, I haven't yet told you.

45
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:23,470
I have already accepted Chengling as a sixth-generation disciple for our Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

46
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,490
Before, I did not know that his father

47
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,950
and my master had such a deep relationship.

48
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,250
One may well say this is an unseen and mysterious fate.

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,740
Uncle Long, if you do not disdain my disciple for being foolish,

50
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:42,640
you can accept him as a disciple.

51
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:46,040
Wonderful. You are Yusen's child

52
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,190
and the disciple of Huaizhang's disciple.

53
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,570
Now, you can inherit my mantle.

54
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:54,160
How wonderful!

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:58,820
In the future, you will carry the profound knowledge of three sects with you.

56
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,590
You will honor

57
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:04,960
the lifelong brotherhood between us three.

58
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,270
Uncle.

59
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:13,200
Foolish child, what are you calling him?

60
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,620
Master Long!

61
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,570
- Master Long!
- Uncle Long.

62
00:04:23,370 --> 00:04:29,120
Zishu, are you carrying the White Clothes sword?

63
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:35,760
Cut off this nuisance for me.

64
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:39,120
Elder Long, these iron chains cannot be slashed so easily.

65
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,790
You have been imprisoned for a long time. Your meridians have already dried up.

66
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,310
As soon as we slash the chain, your essential energy will surge

67
00:04:44,310 --> 00:04:46,270
and inevitably overwhelm you.

68
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:48,880
What's wrong with that?

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,810
You young people, tell me,

70
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:54,880
what am I still living for?

71
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,540
My friends have died. My wife has died.

72
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,600
Even my disciples have died.

73
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,830
What I owe this world,

74
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:05,640
I have fully repaid.

75
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:10,240
I should be granted the mercy of a quick death.

76
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:14,460
Master Long, I beg you... I beg you not to die!

77
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,260
Death, to me, is not something bad.

78
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,640
Rather, it's freedom.

79
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,420
Do you know?

80
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,390
Living on would be the most difficult.

81
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:36,820
- Zishu! Zishu! I can't hold on any longer.
- Master Long!

82
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,900
I beg you. I beg you, please hurry

83
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,440
and cut off these chains.

84
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,170
If I must wear these even as a ghost,

85
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:49,840
then when I see Brother Rong and the others in the underworld,

86
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,870
I will be too ashamed to even greet them.

87
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,780
- Master.
- I beg you, Zishu. Zishu!

88
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,290
Zishu!

89
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,520
You do it.

90
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,410
Master Long, don't die! I will behave well!

91
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:53,470
I will work hard to learn martial arts.

92
00:06:53,470 --> 00:06:55,210
I will restore the prestige of Four Seasons Mountain Villa

93
00:06:55,210 --> 00:06:58,990
and the Dragon Pool Cabinet. Master Long!

94
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:13,290
Zhen Yan, are you really not planning to tell Uncle Long

95
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:15,910
your true identity?

96
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,470
Junior Brother.

97
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,770
A'Xu, what nonsense are you calling me?

98
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,700
What is wrong with you today? Have you deviated into insanity?

99
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,930
Uncle Long, please rest assured.

100
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,410
The Zhen couple concealed their identity long ago

101
00:08:05,410 --> 00:08:09,870
and changed their appearance. They lived quietly in the countryside and spent their last few years of life peacefully.

102
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:14,020
Their child has already grown up and become a...

103
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,830
Although he is sometimes cruel,

104
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,210
he is ultimately someone who cannot be considered too evil.

105
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:25,750
He has mastered a solid set of martial arts.

106
00:08:25,750 --> 00:08:29,600
Is that true? Could it be that

107
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,410
it was Brother Qin?

108
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:33,410
Yes.

109
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,870
It was my master who helped them change their appearances

110
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:40,580
and hide their tracks. He even accepted their child

111
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:44,960
into the sect, and he became my second junior brother.

112
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:55,100
How wonderful. How wonderful.

113
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,910
Uncle Long!

114
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,870
- Uncle Long!
- Master Long!

115
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,270
Master.

116
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,570
Uncle Wen, he...

117
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:51,740
Let him stay here alone for a while.

118
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,370
Thank you.

119
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,710
Counting the days, Master has been in Middle Shu for a while now.
(T/N: Middle Shu's modern day equivalent is Sichuan)

120
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:27,900
Why I haven't heard from him ever since?

121
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:31,780
Just throwing me here to wait with this fool.

122
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:37,180
You fool!

123
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:44,300
Who let you out of bed? Come here.

124
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,140
Who let you get out of bed?

125
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:55,460
The doctor said that this injury of yours needs rest to recover.

126
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:57,840
You're not allowed to move, no getting out of bed!

127
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,040
A'Xiang, I know

128
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:01,910
what happened at the Mount Jun Heroes Conference.

129
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:04,570
I have to recover quickly and return to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

130
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:07,510
Nonsense! Which Mount Hua disciple ran his stupid mouth and told you this?

131
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,960
I'll cut his tongue out!

132
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,970
Don't be so fierce. I'm the one who asked them.

133
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:16,150
What? You're complaining that I'm fierce already?

134
00:11:16,570 --> 00:11:19,390
I would never complain. However fierce you look,

135
00:11:19,390 --> 00:11:22,420
- I know that your heart...
- You know bullshit!

136
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:24,650
When my face is fierce, I'm even more so in my heart!

137
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,290
If you get out of bed again, I'm going to break your legs!

138
00:11:27,290 --> 00:11:30,640
A'Xiang, I must return to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

139
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,490
Would you be willing to return with me?

140
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,410
Why should I go with you?

141
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,110
If you want to go, go. It would be none of my business even if you died on the road.

142
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,840
I... I want to look for my master.

143
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,850
Then, A'Xiang,

144
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,670
I'll return to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect first. There is trouble there, so I must go.

145
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,920
Once things are settled, I'll come back. All right?

146
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:58,400
- You—
- A'Xiang, don't worry.

147
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:01,450
No matter how far away I am, as long as I'm alive,

148
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,510
I will look for you.

149
00:12:04,520 --> 00:12:07,740
Why would you look for me? I am very forgetful.

150
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:09,360
By the time you come back looking for me,

151
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,410
I might have already forgotten what you look like.

152
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:17,380
There's trouble at the Gentle Wind Sword Sect?

153
00:12:17,380 --> 00:12:19,810
What's going on with them?

154
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:22,990
I also thought it was strange before.

155
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:27,250
Our master and Supreme Leader Gao were intimate friends.

156
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,890
Why would he, having already arrived,

157
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,990
rush back to the mountain the night before the Heroes Conference?

158
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,950
So what you mean is...

159
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:40,150
your master most likely took the Glazed Armor away with him?

160
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:42,080
That's what I'm afraid of.

161
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,020
You see, if I was even able to come to this conclusion, others will have to.

162
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:49,590
I'm worried...

163
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:53,540
Then, you definitely must return to your sect?

164
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:55,840
Yes, I must return to look at the situation.

165
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:59,080
If my guess is wrong, then that would be best, of course.

166
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,760
There's no way around it. I guess I'll just have to go with you.

167
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:06,060
You're so foolish and you're injured.

168
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:09,240
Without me protecting you from the dangers of the martial arts world,

169
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,890
I'm afraid you would find it difficult to get anywhere.

170
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:14,460
Drink your medicine!

171
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:18,450
[Bent Song Confusion]

172
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,470
I'm doing this to investigate the Glazed Armor on Master's behalf.

173
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,050
Therefore, I can't help but go with this fool.

174
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:28,120
This is the task that Master assigned to me.

175
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,590
It's not that I want to go myself.

176
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:47,400
If My Lord does not betray me...

177
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,640
I will not betray My Lord...

178
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:57,450
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful,

179
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,260
white of hair and red of skirt.

180
00:14:07,190 --> 00:14:10,850
Qianqiao, how are you still unable to understand?

181
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:15,360
Zhao Jing has just taken the position as the Alliance Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance, and it is a key moment.

182
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:19,850
We have so much leverage in our hands. How can we waste it?

183
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:23,230
- Leverage?
- That's right!

184
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:27,670
The scandal of Gao Chong working with Ghost Valley is not over. If it's revealed that Zhao Jing

185
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,180
has such an ugly history of infidelity,

186
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:33,440
the Five Lakes Alliance's reputation will hit rock bottom!

187
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,540
I don't believe that Zhao Jing would not be afraid of this.

188
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,180
Beloved Feng, to think that you're a grown man,

189
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:43,250
how can you not understand the basic principles of this world?

190
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:47,120
Gao Chong betrayed his brothers, and that is unacceptable.

191
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:52,430
If a woman turned her back on a man, everyone would support her execution.

192
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:55,610
However, if a man turned his back on a woman,

193
00:14:56,490 --> 00:15:00,140
it would only be treated as a young man's love affair.

194
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:02,320
It can't be considered as much leverage.

195
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:07,960
Qianqiao, what happened between the two of us is not the same as what happened between them.

196
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,970
Tragicomic Ghost is ultimately just a woman with a tragic life.

197
00:15:11,970 --> 00:15:16,300
She became a she-demon because of that traitorous man.

198
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:21,930
And who in the world knows that this traitorous man is Zhao Jing?

199
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,700
There is so much blood on Tragicomic Ghosts's hands.

200
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:27,840
Can Zhao get away with it?

201
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:34,450
So what? What good does it do you to ruin Zhao Jing's reputation?

202
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:39,610
It's not as if you, the Mount Hua Sect leader, would be in line to be the next Five Lakes Alliance Leader.

203
00:15:41,330 --> 00:15:46,510
Foolish girl, although Zhao Jing's fallen reputation may not benefit me,

204
00:15:46,510 --> 00:15:49,250
we can use this huge leverage

205
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,170
to get something that benefits both of us in exchange.

206
00:15:53,170 --> 00:15:57,630
What? To turn back time?

207
00:15:57,630 --> 00:16:00,330
The Glazed Armor's whereabouts.

208
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:05,890
Gao Chong's destruction of the Glazed Armor before his death must've been a trick.

209
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:08,860
It is most definitely in Zhao Jing and Shen Shen's hands.

210
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:13,740
Who would not be tempted by a secret treasure that can turn a nobody into an unbeatable power?

211
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:16,780
The Five Lakes Alliance hid the Glazed Armor for twenty years.

212
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:19,670
If they had wanted to destroy it, they would have a long time ago.

213
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:25,910
Qianqiao, the Miracle Healer Valley's Yin Yang Book

214
00:16:25,910 --> 00:16:28,000
can heal the dead and put flesh on bones

215
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:31,370
and completely cure all diseases in the world.

216
00:16:31,370 --> 00:16:34,330
I want to get this artifact for you.

217
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:39,720
Even if you no longer believe what I say,

218
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,580
even if our love pledge ultimately isn't fulfilled,

219
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:47,220
Qianqiao, as long as we can end this regret in your heart,

220
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:51,660
then even if I, Yu Qiufeng, die, I would die in peace.

221
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,680
Is that so?

222
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,540
Sister Qianqiao!

223
00:17:01,590 --> 00:17:07,610
Sister Qianqiao, are you there? Sister Qianqiao, are you there?

224
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:16,460
The Heavenly Wolf Fortress and Striking Cloud Hall wish to join the alliance.

225
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,720
This is as if a tiger gained wings!

226
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:25,270
Chief Sha's long trek to Bianzhou was arduous. He truly made a huge contribution.

227
00:17:25,270 --> 00:17:26,980
How was that a contribution?

228
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,260
I was just running errands!

229
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:32,840
To tell you the truth, when I went this time, I didn't have to say much.

230
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,450
I just brought out our Five Lakes Alliance's command flag and held it up like this.

231
00:17:36,450 --> 00:17:38,640
Guess what happened? Those two leaders

232
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,150
didn't even make a sound and agreed right away.

233
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,180
What does this mean?

234
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:48,590
It means that our alliance leader's prestige is mighty.

235
00:17:48,590 --> 00:17:50,560
You are overpraising me.

236
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:54,680
My virtues are still insufficient, and I'm just a temporary alliance leader.

237
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:57,370
However, after the order in Mount Jun,

238
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:00,640
our alliance not only did not collapse,

239
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,940
it has actually gained an increasingly higher reputation instead.

240
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:07,090
I can't help but admit it's a huge miracle.

241
00:18:08,780 --> 00:18:12,120
Everyone, if you want my opinion, there is no one in this world

242
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:14,800
who is more qualified than our Alliance Leader Zhao.

243
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,140
I'll say it again. If anyone dares to take over the alliance leader's position,

244
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:22,430
I, Old Sha, will be the first one to smash him to death.

245
00:18:22,430 --> 00:18:25,480
Gang Leader Sha, it's inappropriate to say so.

246
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,710
I have only been the leader for several months.

247
00:18:28,710 --> 00:18:32,810
Achieving such accomplishment now was not because of me,

248
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,650
but because of everyone here.

249
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,850
However, compared to the increasing strength of the Five Lakes Alliance,

250
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:46,290
I am even more concerned about the two kids who have disappeared without a trace,

251
00:18:46,290 --> 00:18:48,980
Xiaolian and Chengling.

252
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:53,480
I watched Xiaolian grow up. She is a weak girl who grew up at home.

253
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:56,360
She has never set foot in the martial arts world.

254
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:01,480
In my opinion, these resentments in the martial arts world should not drag her down.

255
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:05,430
But those two old scoundrels Tao Hong and Lv Liu actually captured her as a hostage.

256
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:08,140
It is truly despicable.

257
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:12,050
As for Chengling,

258
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:16,750
he disappeared with a mystery man after the Heroes Conference.

259
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:19,630
We don't even know if he is still alive.

260
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,870
Here, I plead for your help

261
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:29,660
to find those two kids.

262
00:19:29,660 --> 00:19:32,670
Even if it will cost me everything,

263
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:35,460
I will not hesitate.

264
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:38,520
- Leader, please rest assured.
- Please rest assured.

265
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:41,650
That's right! Even if we must turn the martial arts world upside down,

266
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:44,220
we will definitely bring back those two kids,

267
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:47,710
dead or alive.

268
00:19:47,710 --> 00:19:49,460
Old Sha!

269
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:54,730
I misspoke again. I deserve to be slapped.

270
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:59,470
A'Xiang.

271
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,880
Is Yu Qiufeng inside?

272
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,030
What kind of drug did he give you?

273
00:20:05,030 --> 00:20:07,970
The sisters in the Department of the Unfaithful have told me all about that unfaithful man.

274
00:20:07,970 --> 00:20:10,920
Why are you still with him?

275
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,540
A'Xiang, lower your voice.

276
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:17,240
The situation in Yueyang City is chaotic now. Master is still not in her right mind yet,

277
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,720
and both of us have weak martial arts skills, so we have no way of taking her away.

278
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,640
We still need to stay here for now.

279
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,770
That's utter nonsense. With your amazing transformation skills,

280
00:20:25,770 --> 00:20:28,940
we can easily disguise ourselves as others. Wouldn't that fool others into letting us leave the city?

281
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,330
When we meet up with those old ghosts, I'll let them

282
00:20:31,330 --> 00:20:33,650
rip that Yu guy into ten thousand pieces.

283
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,610
A'Xiang, you don't understand.

284
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:38,020
The Top Ten Evil Ghosts scheme against one another.

285
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:41,790
They are trying to kill one another to gain power every single day.

286
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:44,490
This is especially true of us women.

287
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,830
All these years, we've depended on our master's strong martial arts

288
00:20:48,830 --> 00:20:53,370
and the Chief of the Valley's protection in order to stay safe.

289
00:20:54,370 --> 00:20:57,800
Now that Master has been unconscious, I'm afraid...

290
00:20:57,800 --> 00:20:59,210
Why fear?

291
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:02,070
I don't think they have the guts. If they dare to bully us,

292
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:04,600
Master will chop them up to feed the dogs.

293
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:09,030
However, distant water cannot put out a nearby fire unless you can find Chief.

294
00:21:11,350 --> 00:21:15,570
Only he can find me. Where on earth am I supposed to find him?

295
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:19,550
I've already asked the sisters in the Department of the Unfaithful to go down the mountain to search for him.

296
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:22,160
There are many of them, and they are leaving marks everywhere.

297
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,280
If the Chief meets them, he will naturally contact us.

298
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:27,170
This is not a solution.

299
00:21:27,170 --> 00:21:31,390
This is a big world, who knows when Master will see them?

300
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,220
For each day that Master doesn't show up, are you and Aunt Luo going to stay here?

301
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:37,980
Is that Yu Qiufeng reliable?

302
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:41,810
Don't worry, I can deal with him.

303
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:43,320
I don't believe you.

304
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,860
You've been drugged by that bastard and won't have the heart to leave him.

305
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:50,690
If we had known this earlier, when you first entered the valley,

306
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:53,350
Master and Aunt Luo should have made you drink that Water of Oblivion to completely forget about that bastard.

307
00:21:53,350 --> 00:21:57,360
Quit talking nonsense. What does a little girl like you know?

308
00:21:58,490 --> 00:22:01,740
Never mind, I won't expose you.

309
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:08,000
So now, do you have any way to save Aunt Luo?

310
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:13,600
I do not. The effects of the Water of Oblivion are strong.

311
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:16,000
Once you've taken it, the greatest taboo

312
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,000
is to try and awaken the memories it made you forget.

313
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:23,600
Master already suffered from dissociation before. She is sometimes better, sometimes worse.

314
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,000
Right now, her mind is more chaotic than an ordinary person's.

315
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,100
Then, what can we do?

316
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,500
I'll try and figure out a solution for Master's sickness.

317
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:37,200
Right, A'Xiang, is there a reason you came to find me?

318
00:22:38,600 --> 00:22:41,200
I was originally coming to say goodbye to you.

319
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,300
Cao Weining said he's going back to the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

320
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,500
I'm going back with him.

321
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,100
I'm not doing it for him!

322
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:50,760
I'm... I'm doing it for...

323
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,000
the task Master gave me.

324
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:56,700
So that's it. You are usually so thoughtless,

325
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
but you've suddenly become mature.

326
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,400
- It turns out that's because—
- Stop saying nonsense!

327
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:04,000
But right now,

328
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,700
given your circumstances, how can I leave with ease?

329
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:13,000
It's nothing, A'Xiang. Go ahead, don't worry.

330
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,600
When you turn old, you'll understand.

331
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,300
There's no time

332
00:23:17,300 --> 00:23:21,200
more precious than being with the one you love.

333
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,200
Each day counts.

334
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:28,800
Each extra day is a luxury.

335
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:33,100
You won't care to bother about side issues.

336
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:44,400
Scorpion! You must be tired of waiting.

337
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,100
Father!

338
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:49,200
How did the regular meeting go?

339
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,200
How else could it go?

340
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:57,000
The Heavenly Wolf Fortress and the Striking Cloud Hall

341
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:00,200
used to be so arrogant and domineering.

342
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:04,300
Now, they wag their tails and fawn before me.

343
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:08,600
Not to mention those idiots of the Five Lakes Alliance. If I tell them now to go east,

344
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:11,200
is there anyone who would dare to go west?

345
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:17,800
The Heavenly Wolf Fortress Chief is said to be so formidable and fierce.

346
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,000
I only used a little trick,

347
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,200
yet he came down to his knees crying,

348
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:27,000
willingly pledging to serve our Five Lakes Alliance. He was worse than Striking Cloud Hall,

349
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:30,400
which understood the circumstances from the start.

350
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:34,300
Good Son, you have helped me so much.

351
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:37,600
There are many places that are inconvenient for me to appear,

352
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,000
where you have helped me share the burden and resolve problems. With a son like you,

353
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,500
I'm a truly fortunate father.

354
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:46,600
I am still not good enough.

355
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,800
Otherwise, why would Father

356
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:51,900
never let me appear in public?

357
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:54,200
When am I not hoping for the same thing?

358
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:57,200
It's just that the Venomous Scorpions

359
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,100
have a bad reputation and are deeply resented.

360
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,400
This is not the best time yet.

361
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:06,000
Wait patiently a little longer.

362
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,200
I'll listen to whatever Father says.

363
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:13,200
The Immortal Dawn Sect Leader, Bai Qifeng,

364
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,400
knows too many things that he shouldn't.

365
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:19,800
Before reconvening the Heroes Conference,

366
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,000
I would like to silence him forever.

367
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,050
Take some capable assistants

368
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:26,400
and lead the Ghost Valley to remove them.

369
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,200
Don't leave any trouble for the future.

370
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,800
I will do as you bid.

371
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,490
What about Long Xiao? Any news?

372
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:39,200
He also knows quite a bit, and he's suddenly disappeared.

373
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:42,200
I can't rest at ease.

374
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,000
There is no news at the moment.

375
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:48,300
According to reason, Long Xiao would not leave without saying goodbye.

376
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,200
I'm afraid he was kidnapped.

377
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:52,000
But don't worry, Father.

378
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,100
I already sent people to investigate.

379
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,900
I imagine

380
00:25:57,350 --> 00:25:59,640
I will hear back soon.

381
00:26:09,800 --> 00:26:13,600
Long Xiao, who prompted you to tell

382
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,700
those lies at the Heroes Conference?

383
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,800
Are you going to talk or not? If not, I'll kick you down.

384
00:26:21,800 --> 00:26:25,200
Let's see if those children recognize you as their father.

385
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,200
Long Xiao, you are a descendant of Elder Long.

386
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,000
We don't wish to force you.

387
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,900
No, I don't recognize him as my father. I refuse to!

388
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,200
I refuse to!

389
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:50,400
He gave me this body. I'll return it to him now!

390
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,300
I refuse to tell you!

391
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,400
Even if I die, I won't tell you!

392
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,200
By principle, this beast deserves to die a hundred times.

393
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:26,900
But he is Elder Long's only descendant.

394
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:46,920
[Grave of Master Long Que]

395
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:53,930
Let's first go to the library stacks to find the maps and look for a way out.

396
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:58,400
Chengling, in the future, you must double your efforts.

397
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:02,640
You must carry forward Uncle Long's mechanical art.

398
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:11,260
[Grave of Master Long Que]

399
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:18,200
Elder, you've returned.

400
00:28:26,970 --> 00:28:28,970
Let's go first.

401
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:40,200
That's the Sword Immortal of Changming Mountain's descendant

402
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,600
and the guys who kidnapped Zhang Chengling.

403
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,400
Damn it!

404
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:50,000
Why would these people appear together at Dragon Pool Valley?

405
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,400
I must send a message to Scorpion King as soon as possible.

406
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:57,500
[Grave of Master Long Que]

407
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:09,000
Slow down! What is that old monster murmuring about? I want to listen.

408
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:13,300
Don't listen. Let's go take a walk nearby.

409
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:18,000
- Uncle Wen!
- I haven't heard enough yet!

410
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,300
Master. Uncle Wen. Where are we going?

411
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,300
I don't know where your Sister Xiang has gone.

412
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,500
However, that girl is very smart. We shouldn't have to worry about her.

413
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:36,000
After the trouble at Mount Jun, the Five Lakes Alliance will surely be unable to recover.

414
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,000
Those brave men of the martial arts world must all be dejected, too.
(T/N: idiom, their heads and faces covered with dust)

415
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,600
It should be fun to see.

416
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,100
You're wearing too little. Have you caught a cold?

417
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:53,200
Your master's body really is like a beautiful match.

418
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,400
As soon as the wind blows, he's out.

419
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,600
A'Xu, when things have settled,

420
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,800
we should find a place where all four seasons are like spring.

421
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:04,200
Somewhere warm to grow old.

422
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,400
Chengling, where would you like to go?

423
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,500
Wherever Master goes, I'll go.

424
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:11,980
No more waiting.

425
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:19,200
Let's go back to the Four Seasons Mountain Villa together.

426
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:21,400
Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

427
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,800
What? You're impatient to bring your disciple to pay respects to your master?

428
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,300
Bringing such a foolish disciple back,

429
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:36,500
are you not afraid that your master will be turning in anger in the underworld?

430
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:38,800
It's our master.

431
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,000
What relationship do you and I have?

432
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,400
When did it become "our"?

433
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,600
If you keep losing your head like this,

434
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:49,600
I'll have to discipline you on our master's behalf.

435
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,800
Master. Uncle Wen. What are you two talking about?

436
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:57,700
In the future, you can't call him "Uncle Wen" anymore.

437
00:30:57,700 --> 00:31:00,000
You should call him Junior Master.

438
00:31:01,800 --> 00:31:04,000
Junior Master.

439
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,800
Who's your Junior Master?

440
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:09,200
A'Xu, your disciple is foolish enough already. Don't tease him.

441
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:15,200
Junior Brother, are you still unwilling to recognize me (as your Senior Brother)?

442
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:17,200
What nonsense are you saying?

443
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:20,600
Heaven treated me unfairly for half my life.

444
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:24,400
Now, it has finally shown me great benevolence.

445
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:28,000
I alone was all that remained of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

446
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:32,700
I never thought I would gain this disciple

447
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:35,700
and find you again.

448
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:42,300
In the underworld, Master can finally be at peace.

449
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:51,000
- Mother!
- Miaomiao!

450
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,700
- Mother!
- Miaomiao!

451
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:57,400
Yan'er, don't be afraid.

452
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,300
[White Clothes]

453
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:31,600
Eldest Brother Qin, if not for your arrival at the perfect time,

454
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:35,700
the fate of my entire family would've been unthinkable.

455
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:38,400
For your great kindness, I...

456
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:41,000
Shut up! You bookworm.

457
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:44,400
What are you saying? Do you not take me for your brother?

458
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,900
Lie down.

459
00:32:49,800 --> 00:32:52,800
Don't hurt my father! Don't hurt my father!

460
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,200
- Don't hurt my father!
- Yan'er!

461
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:56,400
Yan'er, stop fussing.

462
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:58,900
- Father!
- Come with Mother.

463
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:01,200
- Father!
- Be good.

464
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,800
Father!

465
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:06,800
I'm sorry. This child

466
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:12,000
personally witnessed Master breaking my tendons.

467
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:14,000
It scared him.

468
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:18,510
This is ridiculous!

469
00:33:18,510 --> 00:33:22,180
Master was also forced and couldn't help it.

470
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:24,750
My thoughtlessness shouldn't

471
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,890
lead to the destruction of the entire Miracle Healer Valley.

472
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:29,790
Those people have already become obsessed.

473
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:32,310
If Master wasn't willing to completely break with me,

474
00:33:32,310 --> 00:33:34,270
and draw down the entire Miracle Healer Valley,

475
00:33:34,270 --> 00:33:37,670
then even if I had died, I still—

476
00:33:40,370 --> 00:33:43,410
What exactly did those people come for?

477
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:46,890
Brother Rong couldn't have made so many enemies singlehandedly.

478
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:51,000
Moreover, all of you became implicated.

479
00:33:54,210 --> 00:33:56,900
Yan'er, what did I tell you?

480
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:58,900
Sir Qin is our family's benefactor.

481
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,240
You must not be rude to him.

482
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,770
I'm sorry, Mother.

483
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,230
I'm afraid.

484
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:12,600
Don't be afraid. Mother is here.

485
00:34:14,970 --> 00:34:17,310
Why are you crying?

486
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:19,860
Sister-in-Law,

487
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,170
it was so chaotic last night that I didn't get the time to introduce him to you yet.

488
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:29,330
This is my beloved disciple,

489
00:34:29,330 --> 00:34:32,230
my "Young Forebear" Zhou Zishu.

490
00:34:32,230 --> 00:34:34,980
Master, don't joke.

491
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,940
Heaven and Earth are supreme. Parents and Master are the most respected.

492
00:34:39,450 --> 00:34:43,400
All right, all right. You've collected so many herbs?

493
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:46,430
You've worked hard, our Little Saint Zhou.

494
00:34:47,490 --> 00:34:49,500
Take the little brother outside to play.

495
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,640
Take good care of him.

496
00:34:51,640 --> 00:34:53,550
I don't know how to play.

497
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:57,580
If you don't even know how to play, what else could you possibly do?

498
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:01,060
Go ahead. Don't come back until dinnertime.

499
00:35:01,060 --> 00:35:02,810
Little Brother, what is your name?

500
00:35:02,810 --> 00:35:06,080
My name is Zhen Yan.

501
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:08,350
"Zhen Yan" like "needle eye"?
(T/N: "Needle eye" and "Zhen Yan" are homophones)

502
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:12,650
It's the Yan in Man Yan. It means limitless and free.

503
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:16,550
All right, I know! It's Zhen Yan.

504
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:19,390
What is its name?

505
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:22,030
Its name is One Pot.

506
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:24,120
"One Pot"?

507
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:13,590
Silly boy. It's me, Mother.

508
00:36:13,590 --> 00:36:17,220
See? How is my transformation skill?

509
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,420
Do you want to learn it?

510
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,520
Go inside to check on your father.

511
00:36:32,810 --> 00:36:34,460
Go.

512
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:38,490
Kneel down in front of Uncle Qin, and kowtow three times.

513
00:36:51,400 --> 00:36:54,560
Master, are we taking this little brother home?

514
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:58,590
Yes. From now on, you'll have a friend.

515
00:36:58,590 --> 00:37:02,500
You two must love and care for each other from now on.

516
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:05,920
You are the older one, so you should take good care of him. Understand?

517
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,650
I definitely will.

518
00:37:09,570 --> 00:37:12,610
Little Brother, we have a lot of delicious food and fun toys.

519
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:15,720
When you come home with us, I'll bring all of them out to show you.

520
00:37:15,720 --> 00:37:17,830
Call him Junior Brother.

521
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,280
Junior Brother.

522
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:26,620
Are you all right?

523
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:30,510
We are always away most of the time,

524
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:34,520
our child has been spoiled to be stubborn and unruly.

525
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:39,510
Going forward, I'd like Young Older Brother Zishu to help discipline him.

526
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:42,690
If he does anything wrong, do not hesitate to punish him.

527
00:37:42,690 --> 00:37:47,120
It's just that, please consider how pitiful he is

528
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:50,150
and not shun him.

529
00:37:50,150 --> 00:37:53,600
Father, what do you mean?

530
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:56,720
Are you not leaving with me?

531
00:37:57,410 --> 00:38:01,220
Twenty years have passed since then.

532
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,100
Luckily... Luckily,

533
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:08,740
I originally thought I wouldn't live long.

534
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:12,190
I also don't know how much martial arts Chengling can learn from me.

535
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:18,140
Now that I've found you, this is the best arrangement.

536
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:22,050
Revive the Four Seasons Mountain Villa, take care of Chengling,

537
00:38:22,050 --> 00:38:25,590
and inherit Master's legacy, I can then rest assured.

538
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:29,050
Master, what do you mean that you won't live long?

539
00:38:29,050 --> 00:38:31,310
Why wouldn't you live long?

540
00:38:31,310 --> 00:38:33,910
Have you finished saying all that nonsense?

541
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:37,150
Don't shirk your responsibility.

542
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,790
If you want to revive the Four Seasons Mountain Villa, you stay alive and do it yourself.

When you separate the word Yan into two parts, aren't they Ke and Xing?
(T/N: "Yan" = 衍, "Ke Xing" = 客行. The latter can be found in the former)

545
00:38:47,890 --> 00:38:52,370
It's my mistake. I kept thinking you were Elder Rong's descendant.

551

Master. Junior Uncle. What are you talking about?

552
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,490
All right, I won't keep asking.

553

Junior Uncle! Junior Uncle!

557

Chengling, don't chase after him.

558
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:36,080
Master, Junior Uncle, he...

559
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:45,950
