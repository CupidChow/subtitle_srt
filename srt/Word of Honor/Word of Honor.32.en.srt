Old Sick Ghoul, don't even think about it!

Before Master left, he ordered me

to carefully watch over you.

I'll only drink this one bowl. It's not a big deal, is it?

It is.

Wu Xi, aren't you making it difficult for me?

You know that I can't be happy without wine!

39
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:36,560
Lord Zhou, you made it difficult for me first.

40
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,250
Your injury is tricky and odd,

41
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:41,140
so even if your body could regulate it at its utmost condition,

42
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,690
I can't guarantee that I can heal you.

43
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,550
What more is there to say?

44
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:49,410
Before you've healed, wine, sex, wealth, and anger

45
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:51,200
will have nothing to do with you!

46
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,740
Wu Xi, when you're talking seriously,

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:56,430
you're too cute.

48
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:58,260
I don't need you to guarantee,

49
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,020
fifty-percent is enough. As men, we should drink more.

50
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,480
If you don't listen, I'll tattle to Master when he comes back.

51
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,420
Fine. I'll just not drink.

52
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,980
I'll also tattle to him.

53
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,380
A wicked girl was making things difficult for me.

54
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,940
My Lord Zhou, your abilities to smell and taste were lost long ago,

55
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,110
so what's the difference between whether you drink or not?

56
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:20,310
Drink some tea.

57
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:21,530

- Drink!
- It's not the wine we're drinking.

61
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:29,970
It's the feeling we're drinking.

62
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:34,770
Zishu, it seems like we won't be able to drink together once again.

63
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:39,330
I remembered that we once agreed that once we reunited, we'd drink until we got drunk.

64
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:42,480
While I was waiting all of those years in Nanjiang, the wine got cold,

65
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,230
but the old friend seemed to have no intention of showing up.

66
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,370
I also remember someone had once asked me

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:50,510
to find him a slender Nanjiang lady.

68
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,610
Turns out, I've found quite a few,

69
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,800
but some people...

70
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:58,220
Here, let's have another drink.

00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:11,560
Where's Chengling?

77
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:14,480
Young Master Chengling is fine. However, he doesn't want me to assist him anymore.

78
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,040
What happened?

79
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,840
I don't know, either.

Sect Leader Shen asked Young Master Chengling

81
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,810
if he knew that Sir Wen Kexing was Ghost Valley's chief.

82
00:04:23,810 --> 00:04:26,260
Young Master Chengling threw a tantrum and cried.

83
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:29,150
Later, he asked me to come back.

84
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:31,890
Chengling has discovered Old Wen's identity.

85
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,960
Since it has come to this point, I need to find Old Wen and come up with a plan.

86
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,300
Lord Zhou, I pulled all the resources I could from Nanjiang

87
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,910
to create this elixir of life for you.

88
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:43,360
That won't be necessary.

89
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,370
I'm only going to resolve the misunderstanding between Old Wen and Chengling.

90
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:49,480
Old Wen has promised me that he will no longer take notice of Ghost Valley's matters.

91
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,690
He'd only gone to the valley to obtain something important

92
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,410
and then he would live a cloistered life with me.

93
00:04:53,410 --> 00:04:56,330
Just in case, please accept it.

94
00:04:56,330 --> 00:04:58,770
No matter how severe the injuries are, my medicine

95
00:04:58,770 --> 00:05:02,180
can guarantee to recover five days of a person's life.

96
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,470
What if Sir Wen needs it?

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,140
Don't jinx him, all right?

98
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:09,720

He's about to be executed.

Are you the only one allowed to scheme against others?

Are others not allowed to scheme against you?

Why are you wasting words with him, Xie'er?

Brother Wen, did you hear?

144
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:38,360
It's not I, Zhao Jing, who wants to kill you!

145
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:41,590
- It's the world that wants to destroy you!
- I only hate that I was momentarily softhearted

146
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:44,780
and didn't kill you to take revenge for my father!

Zhen Ruyu lived a life of justice and honor!

Yet he was able to sire such an evil monster!

149
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,560
If the Divine-Handed husband and wife can see this in the underworld,

150
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,970
they would be in great pain!

151
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:58,510
Today, I will kill you to grant my brothers' wishes!

00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,150
I should not have harmed the Zhang family.

159
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:23,770
Zhang Yusen did nothing wrong to my father.

160
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:29,060
Chengling! Kill me to take revenge for your entire family!

161
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,960
I am tired. Kill me.

162
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,560
I won't defend myself.

163
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:37,440
- Let go!
- Chengling, you can't go!

164
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,460
Stupid child, how can you believe the words of that devil?

165
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:44,110
He won't be able to escape anyways. I can't let you go over there!

166
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,100
I'm not lying!

167
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,560
Chengling! Come kill me!

168
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:50,820
I won't defend myself!

169
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,150
You're lying! It's all a lie!

170
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:56,760
Wen Kexing! You lied so heartlessly to Master!

171
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,010
I-I-

172
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:01,010
He didn't lie to me!

173
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,390
Chengling, do you trust me?

174
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,550
Zhou Zishu, don't try to trick Chengling.

175
00:10:23,550 --> 00:10:25,680
Brother Qin was so strong and righteous!

176
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,540
How could he have a traitorous disciple like you?

177
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,800
Zhou Zishu! I admit that I lied to all of you!

178
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,410
Evil and righteousness do not go together!

179
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,310
As Ghost Chief, I will definitely bring chaos to the martial arts world.

180
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
Save it.

181
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,590
Lord Zhou, you are from a famous sect!

182
00:11:18,590 --> 00:11:20,980
I am old friends with your master!

183
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:24,310
If you return to the right side, it won't be too late!

184
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:28,960
Today, Wen Kexing must be killed!

185
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:32,250
This bastard is skilled at scheming! He even tricked me!

186
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,400
You can't fall for his tricks!

187
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,100
Stop with the pointless chatter!

188
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,450
Are you coming one at a time? Or all at once?

189
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:42,200
No sense of shame!

190
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,580
Failures of the martial arts world! A pair of devils!

191
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,960
- Kill them!
- Kill them!

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:49,120
Bastard!

193
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:55,430
Wen Kexing, I said before.

194
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:59,420
If I ever saw you again, I would definitely kill you.

195
00:12:00,150 --> 00:12:04,900
Good! Let's see if you have that ability!

196
00:12:40,610 --> 00:12:42,140
Who's this white-cloaked person?

197
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,090
This is the Sword Immortal Elder of Changming Mountain, Rong Xuan's Master.

198
00:12:47,090 --> 00:12:51,920
It is said he is the only one in the world who has mastered the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

199
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,150
He is already one with the heavens and humanity.

200
00:12:55,150 --> 00:13:00,110
So mastering the Combined Six Cultivation Method brings such power.

201
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,940
Elder Ye! Be careful!

202
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,720
I'll help you!

203
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,200
Chengling!

204
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:46,910
Chengling!

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,190
Chengling! It's dangerous! Don't come over here!

206
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:05,760
Move!

207
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:28,000
Old Wen!

208
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,060
Old Wen!

209
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:43,040
Why must it be like this?

210
00:14:45,350 --> 00:14:46,940
- Master!
- Chengling!

211
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:48,840
Master!

212
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:58,520
♫ The more you try to predict, the harder it is to predict ♫

213
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,830
♫ Surrounded by old resentments ♫

214
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:08,810
♫ The sky is full of rain, with love and hate so minuscule ♫

215
00:15:08,810 --> 00:15:13,130
♫ They bloom and float to and fro ♫

216
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:18,920
♫ Struggling alone yet pretending all is smooth and peaceful ♫

217
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:24,250
♫ Years pass again ♫

218
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:29,390
♫ No way to hold on, no way to escape ♫

219
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,860
♫ I'm insistent, but I let it pass ♫

220
00:15:33,860 --> 00:15:38,650
♫ Who is smiling? ♫

221
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:42,390
Second Brother! Finding the Armory Key is more important.

222
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:50,870
The Armory's Key is on Wen Kexing's body!

223
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:59,500
♫ Who is offering a hug? ♫

224
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:04,800
♫ Who is has missed it again? ♫

225
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:13,580
♫ Dreams are vague ♫

226
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Lord, you are awake?

227
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,050
Where is this?

228
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:44,300
This is Peace Hotel.

229
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:48,080
Peace Hotel...

230
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,720
It was a dream.

231
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,620
Turns out it was just a dream.

232
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,660
My Lord, do you need anything?

233
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,590
The Lord who sent you here is a VIP of our Peace Hotel.

234
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,350
He told us everything is on him.

235
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:03,110
The Ghost Valley has pressured and dominated us for so long.

236
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:05,090
Today, we're finally proud!

237
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,190
Happy! Happy!

238
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:09,530
We let that devil die so easily?

239
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:10,950
That's too easy on him!

240
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:14,900
That evil thief actually died whole! It's not fair!

241
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,990
- Wouldn't you say so?
- That's right!

242
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:20,740
Alliance Leader Zhao should've paraded his body throughout the streets!

243
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:22,240
- Right!
- Right!

244
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,060
Let's drink! Drink!

245
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:28,450
Please forgive us. In this past half month, many martial arts world members have been here.

246
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:31,360
There must have been some huge event today. It's been noisy the whole night.

247
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,310
It is a little noisy indeed.

248
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:35,750
Lord! Lord!

249
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:39,520
My Lord! Are you all right?

250
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,080
My Lord?

251
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,230
Immortal Elder Ye, please enjoy.

252
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:59,290
Everyone!

253
00:18:00,710 --> 00:18:03,170
Today, we were successful

254
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:06,550
all due to Immortal Elder Ye's contribution!

255
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,490
If I didn't see it in person,

256
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:12,730
I wouldn't have known there were such powerful martial arts in the world!

257
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,950
Wouldn't you all say so?

258
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:16,740
That's right!

259
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,000
That's right!

260
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,400
I am flattered.

261
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,650
Today, Alliance Leader Zhao's good adopted son contributed the most today.

262
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:27,180
If it wasn't for him luring the Ghost Chief out of Qingya Mountain,

263
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:29,580
with Ghost Valley's current defense,

264
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,610
I would not have been able to do much, even with my martial arts.

265
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:35,430
Immortal Elder Ye, you've misplaced your praise.

266
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:38,860
He is only a child. He has only done his duty.

267
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:41,340
How could he deserve this kind of flattery?

268
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:44,030
Son! What are you sitting there for?

269
00:18:44,030 --> 00:18:46,390
Hurry and toast him!

270
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:51,650
Immortal Elder Ye.

271
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,430
I do not like noisy gatherings.

272
00:18:58,430 --> 00:19:00,660
I won't hinder your celebration anymore.

273
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,210
I shall take my leave.

274
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:05,020
Immortal Elder!

275
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:10,660
Take care, Immortal Elder!

276
00:19:14,580 --> 00:19:17,500
Everyone, let's continue! If your cup is empty, fill it again!

277
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:20,500
Tonight, we won't return sober!

278
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,000
Scorpion,

279
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:33,130
come here.

280
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:41,330
Sit down.

281
00:19:42,030 --> 00:19:44,440
Didn't you just want to sit by me?

282
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:46,740
I promised you before.

283
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:02,130
Alliance Leader, I give a toast to Sir Zhao!

284
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:06,530
His plan of capturing the enemy's leader before rounding up the rest is certainly brilliant.

285
00:20:06,530 --> 00:20:10,180
Right, right, right! I, Old Sha, will join as well!

286
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:13,350
A toast to Sir Zhao and the Alliance Leader!

287
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Everyone, this is an example of a hero father and good son. Right?

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:22,060
If it weren't for this, I would have never known

289
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,980
that the famous Venomous Scorpion King—

290
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:26,530
Enough! Today,

291
00:20:26,530 --> 00:20:28,320
I will take advantage of this opportunity

292
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:31,580
and grandly introduce

293
00:20:31,580 --> 00:20:34,900
the young talent beside me

294
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:38,160
as my most beloved, good son!

295
00:20:40,230 --> 00:20:42,370
Zhao Xie'er!

296
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,990
To Sir Zhao! To Sir Zhao!

297
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:50,820
To Sir Zhao!

298
00:20:50,820 --> 00:20:52,080
Drink up!

299
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,330
Thank you, Father.

300
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,690
Chengling!

301
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:14,910
Chengling!

302
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,700
Chengling!

303
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,800
- Junior Master!
- Shut up!

304
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,600
Evil Amythest Fiend woman! Where did you kidnap Weining off to?

305
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,700
Junior Master! Don't!

306
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:33,200
Traitorous disciple! Do... Do you know who she is?

307
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,800
She is my future wife!

308
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,000
Junior Master, I don't dare to attack you,

309
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,400
but if you trouble A'Xiang, then kill me first!

310
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,000
Good. Very good.

311
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
I raised you for nothing!

312
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,400
Junior Master,

313
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,400
please tell me.

314
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,800
Is my master, Wen Kexing, actually dead?

315
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,600
Liu Qianqiao?

316
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:27,200
Is Wen Kexing inside?

317
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:30,000
Catch the intruder! There's a Ghost Valley intruder!

318
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:06,600
♫ Myriads of people in the world are
all connected by one thought ♫

♫ I will rise and fall with the wind yet remain
between Heaven and Earth ♫

321
00:23:30,370 --> 00:23:32,940
Ghost Valley spy! Ghost Valley spy!

322
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,200
- Have you seen the assassin?
- I think he went towards Gentle Wind Sword Sect!

323
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,800
Let's go!

324
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,600
Junior Master!

325
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:47,000
Junior Master! Have you seen the assassin?

326
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,700
What does the assassin look like?

327
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,200
He holds a soft sword and is highly skilled in anti-gravity.

328
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:51,600
Zhou Xu?

329
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,600
He went that way!

330
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,400
Let's go!

331
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:57,200
- Junior Master.
- Zhou Xu...
- Junior Master...

332
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,200
Let's go, idiot!

333
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,600
The spy is over here! Come help!

334
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,200
A'Xiang! Hurry and run!

335
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,400
A'Xiang?

336
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,000
Put out the fire!

337
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:48,600
Old sick ghoul, where's my master?

338
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,400
Stop joking around! You can't have not rescued him?

339
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:55,400
It can't be!

340
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Zhou Xu! Zhou Xu! Where's my master?

341
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:03,000
Di-Didn't you tell me to stay put? You said you would rescue him!

342
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,400
Where's my master?

343
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:07,000
- Say something!
- A'Xiang!

344
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:10,900
My master is so powerful, he couldn't die! Tell me where he is!

345
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,400
Brother Zhou! What is going on? As soon as we arrived at White Deer Village,

346
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:17,800
we heard that the Ghost Valley Chief met his death.

347
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,600
Is this true?

348
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,100
You went to find him just now, right?

349
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:25,800
Where is he? Tell us.

350
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,200
I could not rescue him.

351
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:32,400
So I set a fire and let him...

352
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,000
I don't believe you.

353
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:39,800
You're also lying to me! I'm going to find Master!

354
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:41,300
A'Xiang!

355
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,600
Brother Zhou.

356
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,400
Lord Seventh and Great Shaman didn't come with you two?

357
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,300
A'Xiang was anxious,

358
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,530
so we came first. They are still on their way.

359
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Very good.

360
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,600
Weining, take A'Xiang with you and go far away.

361
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:04,300
If the martial arts world refuses to keep you two,

362
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:06,610
go back to Nanjiang with Lord Seventh.

363
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:10,400
Take my 18 disciples with you.

364
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:12,900
Lord Seventh will make sure you are all safe for life.

365
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,400
Brother Zhou! What about you?

366
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:19,000
Brother Zhou!

367
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:11,600
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

368
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:19,100
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

369
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:26,600
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river
but can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

370
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:32,400
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

371
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,220
If you pass on, who would my lonely shadow follow after

372
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:38,000
in the nights among snowy mountains? 
(T/N: Very famous poem originally referencing swans. When one dies, its mate becomes lost)

373
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:41,800
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

374
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:49,800
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

375
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:57,000
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills, the past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

376
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:04,200
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

377
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,730
Why don't you ask what I think of you as?

378
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,600
You are my soulmate.

379
00:28:17,000 --> 00:28:20,800
♫ The grass growing, smoke and cloud flowing ♫

380
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:22,500
Old Wen.

381
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,590
The truth is...

382
00:28:27,390 --> 00:28:30,220
I always knew what you wanted.

383
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,600
I just never spoke of it.

384
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,200
I thought I could change you slowly.

385
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,300
Who would've thought

386
00:28:42,570 --> 00:28:45,310
I would be the one who changed in the end?

387
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,820
I know!

388
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,000
You wanted this foul, tumultuous world

389
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:56,100
and this ghost realm to crumble together.

390
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,200
You wanted this crowd of greedy, selfish,

391
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:02,200
and ludicrous people

392
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,000
to all pay for their greed.

393
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:09,800
You wanted this corrupted world to go up in flame!

394
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:12,400
To accompany your parents' deaths.

395
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:18,600
In the past,

396
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:22,270
I thought you were too extreme.

397
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:25,900
You were blinded by your hatred.

398
00:29:42,510 --> 00:29:45,300
If you don't experience it yourself,

399
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,500
you don't know how much it hurts.

400
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,400
♫  along the river  ♫

401
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:57,800
The trap is set, yet where is the hunter?

402
00:29:59,100 --> 00:30:06,500
You've schemed for so long.

403
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:12,800
Don't you want to see the ending?

404
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:16,800
Your injury is serious in that once the nails are removed,

405
00:30:16,800 --> 00:30:21,600
your overflowing internal energy will definitely break all your meridians.

406
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,700
This elixir can temporarily protect your meridians

407
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:27,100
and withstand the flow of internal energy.

408
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,360
The world is unimportant.

409
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,700
It is meeting the soulmate that is important.

410
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,600
Since my soulmate has gone,

411
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:41,200
what do I have to care about?

412
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:55,300
Tomorrow is the day we reinitiate the Heroes Conference.

413
00:30:56,570 --> 00:30:59,260
My, Zhao Jing's, first cup of wine

414
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:01,880
is to toast our lost brothers.

415
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:05,360
I hope their spirits can protect our Five Lakes Alliance

416
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,800
in choosing a righteous and honorable leader

417
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,900
to lead us in destroying Ghost Valley

418
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:12,900
and in wiping out this cancerous existence in the martial arts world.

419
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,980
Here! Toast to our lost brothers!

420
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:20,380
Toast.

421
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:24,060
My second cup of wine

422
00:31:24,060 --> 00:31:27,230
is to toast everyone here.

423
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,350
A toast to your bravery.

424
00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:33,160
Now, heroes of all paths have gathered at White Deer Village.

425
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,810
Whether my Five Lakes Alliance can cleanse its past shame

426
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:39,490
and achieve glory will all depend on this crucial battle.

427
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:41,600
However, Ghost Valley has lurked for many years.

428
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:44,180
They hold a geographical advantage and are hard to attack.

429
00:31:44,180 --> 00:31:46,500
This battle will most definitely be hard.

430
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,200
I, Zhao Jing, do not ask for anything else.

431
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,540
I only ask that everyone can return safely!

432
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,400
We can then celebrate for three days and three nights!

433
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:58,460
That's right! Toast!

434
00:32:00,470 --> 00:32:04,000
My brothers, it is late.

435
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:07,530
After this cup, let us go back and rest.

436
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:09,460
Let us all rest well

437
00:32:09,460 --> 00:32:11,950
and get plenty of sleep.

438
00:32:11,950 --> 00:32:14,850
Alliance Leader, you are too cautious!

439
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:17,860
Brothers! In my opinion,

440
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:20,250
now that the Ghost Valley Chief has died,

441
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,120
his Ten Evil Devils have mostly sided with us!

442
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,680
Then, what is Ghost Valley?

443
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:29,260
They have all scattered and do not present any challenge!

444
00:32:29,260 --> 00:32:31,960
Even if some Ghost Valley members remain,

445
00:32:31,960 --> 00:32:34,120
they are only hanging on by a thread!

446
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,920
No need to worry! Here, let's drink! Drink!

447
00:32:36,920 --> 00:32:41,000
Even if that is so, we still can't underestimate them.

448
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,500
Second Brother,

449
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:47,720
this third cup of wine, I toast you.

450
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:50,290
I hope your wish is granted tomorrow.

451
00:32:50,290 --> 00:32:52,000
Help Eldest Brother...

452
00:32:52,830 --> 00:32:55,140
complete his unfinished business.

453
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:58,250
Uncle Zhao!

454
00:33:01,430 --> 00:33:04,330
I hope Uncle Zhao accomplishes his goal, and that my father,

455
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:07,110
Uncle Gao, and Uncle Lu's spirits

456
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:08,960
can aid me as I successfully take my revenge!

457
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:13,470
Brothers! Let us all toast Alliance Leader Zhao together!

458
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:19,910
I hope Father takes the position of Supreme Leader of the martial arts world tomorrow.

459
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:22,680
Scorpion, don't only look at what's in front of you.

460
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:25,680
This battle is to uphold justice

461
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:29,730
and to wipe out devils! As for whether I become the Supreme Leader,

462
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,500
that is not that important.

463
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:33,970
What need is there to choose?

464
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:38,200
In these hundreds of years, no matter if it was Shaolin Temple or the Beggar Clan,

465
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:41,560
all of them were completely helpless at the hands of Ghost Valley!

466
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:43,490
It was after our Alliance Leader Zhao and Young Leader appeared

467
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:47,350
and schemed brilliantly were we able to kill the Ghost Valley Chief in one move.

468
00:33:47,350 --> 00:33:50,350
Such achievements! If we were to say who should become Supreme Leader of the martial arts world,

469
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,950
then who else could it be besides our head?

470
00:33:56,880 --> 00:34:00,450
Everyone! With Alliance Leader Zhao's leadership,

471
00:34:00,450 --> 00:34:02,920
who cares if they are 3,000 devils?

472
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:05,710
We will destroy them completely!

473
00:34:05,710 --> 00:34:07,240
Here! A toast to Alliance Leader Zhao!

474
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:12,450
Congratulations to Alliance Leader Zhao! A toast to Alliance Leader Zhao!

475
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:27,450
Then I will thank everyone here!

476
00:34:27,450 --> 00:34:28,530
Toast!

477
00:34:28,530 --> 00:34:30,970
Toast!

478
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:46,520
Changqing, we always stayed on the mountain.

479
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,530
You'd watch me, and I'd watch you.

480
00:34:50,530 --> 00:34:53,630
Not knowing what was happening in the outside world,

481
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:56,210
I didn't think I was that old.

482
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:06,600
It was only after I left the mountain and saw those youngsters,

483
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:08,590
did I realize...

484
00:35:11,530 --> 00:35:13,550
we had become so old.

485
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:21,950
Changqing,

486
00:35:24,350 --> 00:35:27,690
you are just a self-opinionated bastard.

487
00:35:27,690 --> 00:35:31,320
Forming that fucking Ghost Valley and creating that damned Water of Oblivion.

488
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:35,140
You wanted to give the evil in the world

489
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:38,080
a path to reform,

490
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,830
but who gave you a chance to live?

491
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,990
If it weren't for this damned Ghost Valley,

492
00:35:57,960 --> 00:36:00,940
you wouldn't have tried to master the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

493
00:36:00,940 --> 00:36:03,860
You wanted to live as long as a tortoise,

494
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:08,850
subduing that valley full of various devils for a lifetime.

495
00:36:09,350 --> 00:36:12,330
Did you think you were the Earth Store Bodhisattva?
(T/N: Kṣitigarbha, the Bodhisattva of hell-beings)

496
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,730
So ridiculous.

497
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:25,240
You were just a mortal!

498
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:28,200
Why were you trying to do Heaven's work?

499
00:36:31,490 --> 00:36:33,950
Did Heaven ever help you?

500
00:36:40,070 --> 00:36:44,910
[Magic Craftsman Changqing's personal sword]

501
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:48,640
I promised you that I'd clean this mess up for you.

502
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:53,030
I also promised to help you destroy Ghost Valley.

503
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,040
Even until your death, I was afraid to tell you

504
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:00,210
that our little disciple

505
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,680
died right outside Mount Qingya.

506
00:37:04,590 --> 00:37:06,980
There was also a young man

507
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,350
who also died for Rong Xuan.

508
00:37:11,830 --> 00:37:14,860
However, it just so happened that this young man's child

509
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:19,330
ended up becoming the Chief of Ghost Valley.

510
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:32,400
Fate toys with people, indeed.

511
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:39,900
Changqing, if the one alive was you and not me,

512
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:43,100
what would you do?

513
00:37:58,330 --> 00:38:00,390
Lord Duan, please.

514
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,210
Officer Duan,

515
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,200
have things changed?

516
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:21,100
Alliance Leader Zhao, I have certainly misread you.

517
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:25,360
Who would've thought you sided with both righteous and evil sides?

518
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:29,980
Aside from being the Leader of Five Lakes Alliance, you are also the Leader of Venomous Scorpions.

519
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:33,690
I lacked respect. I lacked respect, indeed.

520
00:38:33,690 --> 00:38:36,130
Officier Duan, it is my fault.

521
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,900
However, it is a long story, and the timing was not right.

522
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,430
It would be inconvenient for the world to know.

523
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:44,300
However, if you must know,

524
00:38:44,300 --> 00:38:47,560
I would definitely not lie to my allies.

525
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:49,380
Allies?

526
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:53,690
How could the Window of Heaven dare to ally with the great Venomous Scorpions?

527
00:38:53,690 --> 00:38:56,300
You possess multiple identities.

528
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,070
This was not something I originally should've interfered with,

529
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:05,580
but Venomous Scorpions is a harmful existence that steals and kills everywhere.

530
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:10,640
Buying humans and transforming them into Drug Men is something the world cannot accept!

531
00:39:11,810 --> 00:39:15,400
If the Window of Heaven were to openly support someone like you,

532
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,390
helping you become Supreme Leader and wipe out Ghost Valley,

533
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,140
then if this were to get exposed in the future,

534
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:23,150
the prince would take my head first!

535
00:39:23,150 --> 00:39:24,820
Officer Duan!

536
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:30,060
I came today to inform you that

537
00:39:30,060 --> 00:39:33,350
after today, we are enemies, not friends.

538
00:39:33,350 --> 00:39:35,770
Next time we meet,

539
00:39:35,770 --> 00:39:39,250
don't blame me for not showing any mercy.

540
00:39:39,250 --> 00:39:42,310
- I will take my leave.
- Officer Duan! Please wait!

541
00:39:42,310 --> 00:39:44,340
There must be a misunderstanding.

542
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:47,150
I, Zhao Jing, am not the Leader of Venomous Scorpions.

543
00:39:47,150 --> 00:39:49,950
The leader is the Scorpion King.

544
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,250
He... counts as my ally as well.

545
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,110
Ally?

546
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:59,960
Is he not your adopted son?

547
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:02,470
Yes, that's right.

548
00:40:02,470 --> 00:40:06,290
However, I did not know he performed so many evil acts behind my back.

549
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,210
Officer Duan, can you specify

550
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:13,940
what exactly Drug Men are?

551
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,840
How was it?

552
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:25,510
The human heart cannot bear testing.

553
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:33,580
Zhao Jing said he would reinitiate the Heroes Conference

554
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:36,060
and fight against the Ghost Valley to the end.

555
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:41,620
Using evil to kill evil is not against the will of the heavens.

556
00:40:43,390 --> 00:40:45,790
After the battle,

557
00:40:45,790 --> 00:40:50,540
he will kill you and take over the Venomous Scorpions.

558
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:32,400
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

559
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:39,570
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

560
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:46,570
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

561
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:55,130
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

562
00:41:55,130 --> 00:42:02,200
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

563
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:09,690
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

564
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:13,570
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

565
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:17,200
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

566
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:25,110
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

567
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,470
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

568
00:42:28,470 --> 00:42:32,170
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

569
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:36,010
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
 ♫

570
00:42:36,010 --> 00:42:40,220
♫ quiet life by the stream ♫

571
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:43,610
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

572
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:47,450
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

573
00:42:47,450 --> 00:42:54,580
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

574
00:42:54,580 --> 00:43:03,160
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
