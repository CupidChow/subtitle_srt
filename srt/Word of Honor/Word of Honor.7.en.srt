Master, what do you need?

69
00:06:46,778 --> 00:06:49,221
This Wucheng wine is very good.

70
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:51,382
Bring me another bottle.

71
00:06:51,382 --> 00:06:52,554
My apologies, Master.

72
00:06:52,555 --> 00:06:54,110
I'll be honest with you.

73
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:56,678
There is a VIP from Huzhou sitting in the private room,

74
00:06:56,678 --> 00:06:59,943
and he bought out all of the Wucheng wine in the store.

75
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:03,011
How about I bring you something else?

Okay.

77
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:05,922
All right!

78
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:20,911
Why does that man look somewhat like my master?

79
00:07:22,222 --> 00:07:25,078
Only their physiques look the same. Master is not that handsome.

80
00:07:25,078 --> 00:07:28,922
I wonder where Master and Uncle Wen have gone now.

Do you not know who I am?!

85
00:07:58,222 --> 00:07:59,943
I forgot to tell you the rules first.

86
00:07:59,944 --> 00:08:03,665
You are not allowed to speak without my permission.

87
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,566
Whoever speaks will die first.

88
00:08:06,566 --> 00:08:10,165
Anyway, only one person among all of you may leave this place alive.

89
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,800
We don't care who it is.

90

You back there.

91
00:08:16,722 --> 00:08:19,944
You look very experienced and knowledgeable.

92
00:08:19,944 --> 00:08:26,389
Do you know why my master is said to preside over the List of the Unfaithful?

93
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:28,888
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful, Tragicomic Ghost,

94
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,911
kills all of the world's perfidious people.

95
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,843
Correct.

96
00:08:35,843 --> 00:08:37,832
However, you still must die.

97
00:08:37,832 --> 00:08:39,843
Didn't I tell you already?

98
00:08:39,843 --> 00:08:43,221
Before I give my permission, no one is allowed to speak.

99
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:47,578
I asked you a question, but I didn't tell you to answer.

100
00:08:47,578 --> 00:08:51,577
Mu Yunge tricked Miss Mo into giving him her body and promising to marry him, but he then betrayed her heartlessly,

101
00:08:51,577 --> 00:08:55,889
which caused Miss Mo to hang herself to death under the Broken Arrow Mountain Villa.

102
00:08:55,889 --> 00:08:59,233
Since my master found out about this,

103
00:08:59,233 --> 00:09:02,511
she is going to uphold justice today.

104
00:09:03,778 --> 00:09:06,165
Whenever she presides over a marriage,

105
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:10,811
ten of the perfidious man's friends and relatives must be invited over as guests.

106
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:16,278
Today, out of the ten of you, only one can leave here alive.

107
00:09:16,278 --> 00:09:19,622
As for who can live until the end,

108
00:09:19,622 --> 00:09:22,678
that will depend on your own capabilities.

109
00:09:22,678 --> 00:09:27,200
That being said, Young masters, I look forward to your performances.

110
00:09:28,289 --> 00:09:31,221
Don't be scared. Worst comes to worst, it's just death.

111
00:09:31,222 --> 00:09:36,455
We absolutely cannot hurt the Yueyang Sect's reputation.

112
00:09:36,455 --> 00:09:39,122
Brothers, let's fight to the death with them!

113
00:09:39,122 --> 00:09:42,411
They're humiliating us on purpose for fun!

114
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,455
What are you thinking about?

115
00:09:45,455 --> 00:09:49,455
They— They are purposefully sowing discord between us!

116
00:09:49,455 --> 00:09:52,110
Even if only one of us remains,

117
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:55,400
will this group of devils really uphold their promise?

118
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,610
Lad, you misspoke.

119
00:09:58,611 --> 00:10:02,122
The Ghosts on Mount Qingya do all kinds of bad deeds,

120
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:05,832
but they never break promises.

121
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:13,655
We're completely opposite of you great warriors whose words aren't worth a shit.

122
00:10:13,655 --> 00:10:16,222
But then again,

123
00:10:16,222 --> 00:10:20,610
do you even have a choice right now?

124
00:10:20,611 --> 00:10:24,122
What are you all waiting for? Start fighting.

125
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,122
Didn't I make myself clear?

126
00:10:26,122 --> 00:10:29,122
Only one of you is allowed to remain alive.

127
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:33,665
Stop! Are you all crazy?

128
00:10:33,666 --> 00:10:35,466
Go ahead, fight!

129
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:38,578
- My goodness! This is actually fun!
- Skin him! Otherwise, you're dead!

130
00:10:38,578 --> 00:10:39,888
Tragicomic Ghost,

131
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,832
I truly respect smart people like you.

132
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:44,665
Just based off how exciting it is to watch dogs fight with each other,

133
00:10:44,666 --> 00:10:47,332
I am truly willing to follow you for a lifetime

134
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,478
as your little sidekick.

135
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,443
Stop, Brothers!

136
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:53,288
- Kill him!
- Stop fighting!

137
00:10:53,288 --> 00:10:56,877
- Fight harder.
- Hurry up, kill him!

138
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,999
Zhang Yusen, the respected warrior of Mirror Lake,

139
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,600
was an incredibly strong-minded person.

140
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,110
How could he have left behind such a useless child?

141
00:11:10,111 --> 00:11:13,477
If his first or second son were still alive, he would at least have an heir,

142
00:11:13,477 --> 00:11:15,133
but this child...

143
00:11:16,422 --> 00:11:18,822
It's normal for the youngest child to be somewhat spoiled.

144
00:11:18,822 --> 00:11:22,378
After all, he was born during a time of world peace

145
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:24,110
and hasn't experienced any challenges.

146
00:11:24,111 --> 00:11:25,444
Second Brother,

147
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:30,499
do you really believe that he doesn't remember anything?

148
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,665
Why would a child lie to us?

149
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:34,455
You're overthinking.

150
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:44,222
Did you know? Our two nephews from the Zhang family

151
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,777
were lynched before they died.

152
00:11:45,778 --> 00:11:47,690
Fourth Brother even...

153
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:51,066
crushed his own skull!

154
00:11:51,066 --> 00:11:53,665
If Ghost Valley had already successfully found the Glazed Armor, why would they waste so much effort

155
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:54,755
to scare them so badly?

156
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:57,777
They must've tortured them because they weren't able to find it,

157
00:11:57,778 --> 00:11:59,610
and that's why Fourth Brother and the children suffered so tragically!

158
00:11:59,611 --> 00:12:01,111
Younger Brother.

159
00:12:02,111 --> 00:12:04,731
Do you still believe that Chengling doesn't know anything?

160
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:09,054
I just don't know what got into him

161
00:12:09,055 --> 00:12:11,466
that made him so distant and quiet.

162
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:15,089
That's enough! Stop talking.

163
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:16,755
My heart aches.

164
00:12:16,755 --> 00:12:18,975
What's the use in having an aching heart?

165
00:12:34,122 --> 00:12:35,722
Great!

We watch martial arts skits all the time, but we rarely get the opportunity to observe

173
00:13:02,778 --> 00:13:05,877

174
00:13:05,877 --> 00:13:09,189
Bravo, bravo, bravo! Actually,

175
00:13:09,189 --> 00:13:14,133
I do approve of today's survivor.

176
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:20,389

[Great Ambitions]

182
00:14:01,722 --> 00:14:03,066
Greetings, Great Warrior Gao.

183
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:07,144
I'm the leader of the Window of Heaven, Han Ying.

184
00:14:07,144 --> 00:14:10,721
Officer Han, you came thousands of miles from Jinzhou to get here.

185
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,166
What for?

186
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:14,162
I'll get straight to the point.

187
00:14:14,162 --> 00:14:19,033
I came to the South to investigate the Glazed Armor.

188
00:14:19,033 --> 00:14:21,499
As the chief of the Five Lakes Alliance, Great Warrior Gao,

189
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:24,511
please do not hesitate to tell me what information you have.

190
00:14:24,511 --> 00:14:28,455
The Glazed Armor is just a rumor in the martial arts world.

191
00:14:28,455 --> 00:14:31,300
Officer Han, don't believe everything you hear.

192
00:14:31,844 --> 00:14:34,389
An honest man does not lie.

193
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:36,766
Don't dodge my question.

194
00:14:36,766 --> 00:14:42,289
If you tell me all that you know about the Glazed Armor,

195
00:14:42,289 --> 00:14:44,610
the Window of Heaven will owe you a favor.

196
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:49,678
In the future, we will be interacting very much with the Five Lakes Alliance, meaning that there will be lots of opportunities for collaboration.

197
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,277
Or else...

198
00:14:51,278 --> 00:14:53,811
I've heard about the astounding reputation of the Window of Heaven.

199
00:14:53,811 --> 00:14:57,066
Shadows without traces. Entry without exit.

200
00:14:57,066 --> 00:14:59,355
Know everything. Be everywhere.

201
00:14:59,355 --> 00:15:03,022
Now that I've met you, Commander Han, I know that the rumors are indeed true.

202
00:15:03,022 --> 00:15:05,589
Since the Window of Heaven knows everything,

203
00:15:05,589 --> 00:15:09,465
why did you come to see me for the Glazed Armor?

204
00:15:09,465 --> 00:15:13,444
Wouldn't that mean that your reputation is false?

205
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,888
I heard that the Five Lakes Alliance is searching for

206
00:15:22,889 --> 00:15:25,611
the orphan of the Mirror Lake Sect.

207
00:15:25,611 --> 00:15:27,577
This is the Five Lakes Alliance's internal matter.

208
00:15:27,577 --> 00:15:29,165
No need for outsiders to worry.

209
00:15:29,165 --> 00:15:33,289
As for the Glazed Armor, I don't know anything about it.

210
00:15:33,289 --> 00:15:37,000
If there's nothing else, please go back.

211
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:40,155
Don't make me do this the hard way!

212
00:15:40,155 --> 00:15:43,011
The Window of Heaven may rule over the entire Northwest,

213
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:48,766
but you are in Yueyang City now, under the rule of the emperor.

214
00:15:48,766 --> 00:15:51,400
If Commander Han wants to stay for a banquet of food and wine,

215
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,144
then the Five Lakes Alliance will treat you as our guest.

216
00:15:55,144 --> 00:15:59,378
Would you like to leave or stay for a banquet?

217
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,910
How did Prince Jin find out about the Glazed Armor?

218
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,021
Chengling and the others are almost here.

219
00:16:15,021 --> 00:16:18,089
We must bring them into the city soon

220

Get on horseback immediately. Only bring Chengling.

Why were you so anxious to have us bring Chengling back?

245
00:18:18,455 --> 00:18:20,478
I'm afraid that from now on,

00:23:40,339 --> 00:23:41,383
Yes, Master.

325
00:23:41,383 --> 00:23:43,950
Luckily, I was able to complete my task and go unnoticed.

326
00:23:43,950 --> 00:23:45,605
Good.

327
00:23:46,339 --> 00:23:48,694
The stage is set.

328
00:23:48,694 --> 00:23:52,560
I'm excited to watch as the Window of Heaven, the Venomous Scorpions, the Five Lakes Alliance,

329
00:23:52,561 --> 00:23:55,761
and other martial artists compete on the same stage.

330
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:58,828
As soon as one group finishes their performance, another will take the stage.

Come, Miss, look at this fabric.

333
00:24:05,328 --> 00:24:06,782
Doesn't it look too red?

Not at all, it fits you well.

- Yes.

Excuse me, friend.

Are you going to take part in the Heroes Conference?

I guess so.

May I ask your name, which sect you're from, and whether you have an invitation or not?

I'm just an insignificant nobody who doesn't deserve mentioning.

You are Junior Master Zhao's friends?

My apologies. My apologies.

348
00:24:43,172 --> 00:24:45,694
Do you need me to send a junior brother to bring you to the stage station for rest?

No need for the trouble. Go ahead and continue with your business.

All Master does is put me in tough positions.

He asked me to find a chance to get into the Yueyang Sect.

How am I supposed to do that?

Sell myself as a servant?

368

I'm so beautiful and have such extraordinary charisma. How could anyone believe that I'm a servant girl?

We know many.

Then sing us "Eighteen Touches."

You're Young Master Zhu, right?

450
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,216
Is this how you act chivalrous in the martial arts world?

451
00:31:10,216 --> 00:31:14,183
Harassing others and not helping the needy?

452
00:31:14,183 --> 00:31:17,572
So, is this how the Five Lakes Alliance cultivates its disciples?

Miss, please don't say that.

The Five Lakes Alliance would never tolerate deeds as evil as sexual harassment.

456
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:29,727
However, Young Liuzi is not our sect's disciple.

457

We will most definitely uphold justice and give you an explanation regarding such an evil deed.

I also love fighting.

Then fight with me!

No... how could I do that?

481
00:32:38,061 --> 00:32:39,393

482
00:32:39,394 --> 00:32:40,905
I never fight girls.

483
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:43,060
What do you mean? Are you looking down upon me?

Don't think that I can't beat you!

485
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:46,372
That's not what I meant!

486
00:32:46,372 --> 00:32:49,593
It's just that you're very beautiful, which makes others want to protect and respect you.

487
00:32:49,593 --> 00:32:52,828
How could I dare to try and hurt you?

488
00:32:58,116 --> 00:33:00,371
Don't eat that. All of these dishes have already gotten cold.

489
00:33:00,371 --> 00:33:02,338
I'll ask them to make some new ones for you.

490
00:33:02,339 --> 00:33:04,172
- Miss—
- That's all because you were too slow!

491
00:33:04,172 --> 00:33:06,439
Let's order new dishes then.

492
00:33:20,728 --> 00:33:23,227
A'Xu, you want to drink again?

493
00:33:23,228 --> 00:33:25,705
Surely you haven't become an alcohol addict?

494
00:33:25,705 --> 00:33:28,660
This is the area where the city's martial artists gather.

495
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:33,228
If anything happens, you can hear news about it here.

496
00:33:33,228 --> 00:33:35,939
How mad?
(T/N: "News" and "Sounds of madness" are homophones, so what Wen Kexing heard was "If anything happens, you can hear sounds of madness here")

00:34:07,527 --> 00:34:10,171
Customer, what would you like?

500
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,393
Do you have fresh tea leaves from this spring?

501
00:34:12,394 --> 00:34:13,615
Customer, you must be joking.

502
00:34:13,616 --> 00:34:16,960
With so many martial artists and heroes here recently, how could there be any type of tea we don't serve?

503
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:18,515
Which region's tea would you like?

504
00:34:18,515 --> 00:34:21,076
Do you have that kind that was roasted with raw rice?

505
00:34:22,504 --> 00:34:24,449
Not in the city,

506
00:34:24,449 --> 00:34:27,427
but I heard that a large batch was imported by the government recently.

507

Small stores like ours can't afford it though.

Thank you for the tip!

Philanthropist Wen,

don't you understand the martial arts world's commonly used phrases?

513
00:34:56,727 --> 00:34:58,494
How would I not?

514
00:34:58,494 --> 00:35:00,550

You know Supreme Leader Gao well?

519
00:35:24,861 --> 00:35:29,483
I wouldn't say that. It's my master who has a very good relationship with Supreme Leader Gao.

520
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:32,228
They are soulmates.

How come you're talking like a book?

I know someone who would definitely be able to hold a conversation with you!

Really?

534
00:36:06,561 --> 00:36:10,960
Of course. He loves eating and sharing literary knowledge.

535
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,172
I don't think so.

Come here, come here! Have a seat.

This is Cao Weining from the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

He is a very important guest of the Yueyang Sect.

This is my master.

You're a maid?

542
00:36:39,861 --> 00:36:41,828
What? You look down upon maids?

543
00:36:41,828 --> 00:36:43,994
No no, maids are great. Maids are great.

544
00:36:43,994 --> 00:36:48,493
I thought that you were a disciple of some martial arts master

545
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:51,416
or a daughter of a noble family.

546
00:36:51,416 --> 00:36:52,793
I was afraid...

547
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:54,294
Afraid of what?

548
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:55,727
I... Nothing.

549
00:36:55,728 --> 00:36:59,628
I don't care if it's the Gentle Wind Sword Sect or the Stroke Sect.
(T/N: Wind and stroke (the medical emergency) are written with the same character, so it's a homonym joke)

550

Do you know our A'Xiang well?

551

I don't! We just met.

- Master, let's eat toge—
- Since you're not close,

553
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:12,560
and the person she's close with is here,

554
00:37:12,561 --> 00:37:17,361
please leave us in a mellow manner, if you don't mind.

555

I'm so sorry, so sorry.

556
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,416
So sorry.

557
00:37:28,861 --> 00:37:33,572
Master, what does "leave us in a mellow manner" mean?

558
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:35,850
It's a more elegant way of saying, "Scram."

559
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:40,582
A'Xiang, where did you meet such a crafty and shallow half-wit?

560
00:37:40,582 --> 00:37:42,793
He mixed up The Nine Songs and the Ode to Goddess of Luo River.

561
00:37:42,793 --> 00:37:45,227
It would be enough to make Qu Yuan roll in his grave with fury.
(T/N: Qu Yuan wrote "The Nine Songs")

562
00:37:45,227 --> 00:37:48,550
Who is Qu Yuan? What does this have to do with him?

563
00:37:54,628 --> 00:37:56,516
Come closer.

564
00:37:58,739 --> 00:38:01,782
Anyway, you are not allowed to continue interacting with that uncultured fellow,

565
00:38:01,783 --> 00:38:03,716
do you hear me?

566
00:38:04,694 --> 00:38:06,627
I think he seems very cultured!

567
00:38:06,627 --> 00:38:08,127
Much more than I am.

568
00:38:08,127 --> 00:38:10,028
You're comparing him to you?

569
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,649
Why don't I see that Sick Ghoul? Where did he go?

570
00:38:18,649 --> 00:38:20,532
Why do you care about him?

571
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:24,683
What? Do you want him to marry you?

572
00:38:24,683 --> 00:38:26,216
I don't dare.

573
00:38:26,216 --> 00:38:31,449
He looks like he has a nice temperament, but the truth is that when no one is watching,

574
00:38:31,450 --> 00:38:34,330
his glance is even scarier than a ghost's.

575
00:38:35,139 --> 00:38:37,950
Really? Then why ask about him?

576
00:38:37,950 --> 00:38:40,328
I feel like when he's around,

577
00:38:40,328 --> 00:38:43,783
you look more like a person.

578
00:38:47,405 --> 00:38:50,104
You look like and dress like a decent person,

579
00:38:50,104 --> 00:38:52,616
but why are you dining and dashing?

580
00:38:52,616 --> 00:38:55,060
You have no money, so you're paying in calligraphy.

581
00:38:55,061 --> 00:38:57,482
Which famous scholar are you?

582
00:38:57,482 --> 00:39:00,716
Waiter, please be quieter.

583
00:39:00,728 --> 00:39:02,727
What happened? You didn't bring money?

584
00:39:02,727 --> 00:39:04,128
No.

585
00:39:04,128 --> 00:39:07,272
Young Master, you treated her to a meal despite having no money?

586
00:39:07,272 --> 00:39:08,627
That's inappropriate.

587
00:39:08,627 --> 00:39:11,183
Don't worry, I have money!

588
00:39:11,183 --> 00:39:14,372
How could you let a girl pay?

589
00:39:14,372 --> 00:39:17,816
I will pay this young master's bill.

590
00:39:17,816 --> 00:39:20,644
A'Xu, your wallet.

591
00:39:25,950 --> 00:39:28,161
Where is your wallet?

592
00:39:29,350 --> 00:39:32,338
All people make careless mistakes in moments of overconfidence.
(T/N: Literally, "a man who hunts geese every day eventually gets his eyes pecked out")

593
00:39:32,339 --> 00:39:35,838
When we were on the street, I saw a handsome scholar.

594
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,928
He passed by me and even smiled at me.

595
00:39:38,928 --> 00:39:44,394
Who knew that he could've been a friend, but had to be a thief?

596
00:39:44,394 --> 00:39:48,949
Was it a scholar in green with long eyes and fair skin?

597
00:39:48,950 --> 00:39:52,628
I saw him in front of the calligraphy and paintings stand and even chatted with him for a bit.

598
00:39:52,628 --> 00:39:56,249
It must be him! He must have stolen my wallet.

599
00:39:56,249 --> 00:39:58,672
Even you fell into Fang Buzhi's trap?

600
00:39:58,672 --> 00:40:00,727
Fang... Fang Buzhi?

601
00:40:00,727 --> 00:40:02,338
Fang Buzhi, the Forefather of Thieves?

602
00:40:02,339 --> 00:40:05,450
I understand now! He stole my wallet!

603
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:09,516
A kind and weak scholar like me

604
00:40:09,516 --> 00:40:12,960
faces inevitable and devastating loss when walking across the martial arts world.

605
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,238
It's fine, it's fine.

606
00:40:14,238 --> 00:40:17,250
A'Xu, give me your wallet.

607
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:20,272
No.

608
00:40:20,272 --> 00:40:23,172
Why should I pay for you? We are not close.

609
00:40:25,505 --> 00:40:28,338
Master, who is that? Just leave him.

610
00:40:28,339 --> 00:40:30,372
I have money.

611
00:40:31,128 --> 00:40:34,750
A'Xiang, don't get involved in matters

612
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,694
you shouldn't get involved in.

613
00:40:42,450 --> 00:40:46,450
You... You... You are...

614
00:40:46,450 --> 00:40:48,383
You are...!

615
00:40:48,383 --> 00:40:51,727
How about that? Your master has good taste, right?

616
00:40:51,728 --> 00:40:55,228
I told you, he's no ordinary treasure.

617
00:40:56,839 --> 00:40:59,672
Sick Ghoul!

618
00:41:01,472 --> 00:41:04,305
This is your real face?

619
00:41:04,305 --> 00:41:07,794
Master, this is the first time you've ever been right!

620
00:41:08,561 --> 00:41:11,105
Retract those claws!

621
00:41:11,105 --> 00:41:15,060
A'Xu, how come when I touch you, you act like you want to hit or murder me,

622
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,961
but you just let her touch you?

623
00:41:17,961 --> 00:41:22,439
If you were a cute girl, you could touch me, too.

624
00:41:26,005 --> 00:41:28,905
Masters, can you all pay first?

625
00:41:28,905 --> 00:41:33,560
After that, you can touch whoever you want however you want. Sound good?

626
00:41:33,561 --> 00:41:35,994
A'Xu, wallet.

627
00:41:44,072 --> 00:41:47,516
I didn't expect our A'Xu to be a little millionaire.

628
00:41:47,516 --> 00:41:49,494
Borrowing money comes with interest.

629
00:41:49,494 --> 00:41:51,605
One percent every day.

630
00:41:51,605 --> 00:41:54,683
Master, we don't need his money. We have our own.

631
00:41:54,683 --> 00:41:57,983
If you don't pay me back, I'll take the girl.

632
00:41:58,694 --> 00:42:02,004
A'Xiang, if you take those claws out again,

633
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:06,339
I promise that not only will you have trouble, you'll also have disasters.

634
00:42:10,739 --> 00:42:12,615
Thank you so much, Master! Thank you so much!

635
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:14,449
I'll get your change right away.

636
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:15,727
No need.

637
00:42:15,728 --> 00:42:19,060
Bring me a full set of your best feast.

638
00:42:19,061 --> 00:42:21,060
This master is very rich.

639
00:42:21,061 --> 00:42:24,449
He definitely won't try to pay with calligraphy.

640
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:27,672
Okay! This way to the private room!

641
00:43:02,916 --> 00:43:09,239
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

642
00:43:10,616 --> 00:43:16,583
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

643
00:43:17,794 --> 00:43:24,750
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

644
00:43:24,750 --> 00:43:32,228
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

645
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:40,283
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

646
00:43:40,283 --> 00:43:47,883
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

647
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:51,794
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

648
00:43:51,794 --> 00:43:55,449
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

649
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:03,193
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

650
00:44:03,193 --> 00:44:06,638
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

651
00:44:06,638 --> 00:44:10,415
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

652
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:18,383
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

653
00:44:18,383 --> 00:44:21,883
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

654
00:44:21,883 --> 00:44:25,682
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

655
00:44:25,682 --> 00:44:32,728
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

656
00:44:32,728 --> 00:44:41,516
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
