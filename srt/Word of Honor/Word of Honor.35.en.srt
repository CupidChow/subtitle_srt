[Episode 35]

23
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:57,110
Master! You've come!

24
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,870
- Maste—
- She

25
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:05,660
is the evil woman you eloped with?

26
00:02:05,660 --> 00:02:08,250
Bear with it. Bear with it.

27
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:11,160
For Junior Master and Eldest Brother Cao's sake.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,350
And here I thought she was some otherworldly beauty.

29
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,880
She's nothing much.

30
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,650
Master, A'Xiang isn't an evil woman. She came from Ghost Valley,

31
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:23,420
but-but she has a pure, kind nature!

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:26,300
She endured the troubles of Gentle Wind Mountain with us!

33
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,850
Master, you haven't interacted with her before,

34
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:30,640
- so you don't know. Junior Master knows—
- Shut up!

35
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:36,650
Great abilities, wicked woman.

36
00:02:36,650 --> 00:02:39,560
You were even able to trick my junior brother.

37
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,770
When Huaikong found out I was coming, he spoke very much on your behalf.

38
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:51,860
Cao Weining, think clearly.

39
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,580
Are you willing to fall upon the path of devils for a wicked woman?

40
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,400
Master, I've made my choice.

41
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,730
I once took a vow

42
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,030
that from my life until my death, every second counted,

43
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:11,200
I would never fail A'Xiang even for a moment!

44
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,750
Master, you've always taught me that once a promise is spoken, I must follow through with my actions.

45
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,020
I can't break a promise to a girl.

46
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:22,240
Enough!

47
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,560
You-You aren't willing to fail this wicked woman,

48
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,400
yet you are willing to let Gentle Wind Sword Sect become the laughingstock of the martial arts world?

49
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:33,720
Good. Very good.

50
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,230
I raised you into an adult and had high hopes for you.

51
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:41,110
Yet you repay me like this?

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,290
I understand my sins! I am unfilial and ungrateful!

53
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,290
Master! Master!

54
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:52,910
In the future, I will definitely perform acts of kindness with my wife

55
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:54,420
to promote good and punish evil!

56
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,890
Master, I beg you to approve of this marriage for the sake of your affection for me!

57
00:03:57,890 --> 00:03:59,400
Master...

58
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,870
Master...

59
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:30,340
Fine.

60
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,870

♫ My only wish ♫

66
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:10,130
♫ is to walk this mortal realm with your hand in mine ♫

67
00:06:10,130 --> 00:06:14,820
♫ and live this life ♫

68
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,230
♫ Fate and destiny can't be decided by ourselves ♫

69
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:27,630
♫ How did our infatuation lead us astray? ♫

♫ You and I are destined for each other ♫

00:06:40,540 --> 00:06:46,790
♫ Wish we could stay together to the ends of the earth ♫

73
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,090
Eldest Brother Cao...

74
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,250
Look...

75
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,750
Hasn't this...

76
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,000
become...

77
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:10,640
a tragicomedy?
(T/N: A reference to Tragicomic ghost's wedding-funerals, where happy events like weddings get tainted with bloodshed)

78
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:33,470
Attack!

79
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:46,660
Why are the drums sounding again?

80
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:23,370
I want to treat you to a meal.

81
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:27,080
May I ask...

82
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:29,200
for your name?

83
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,790
Once I report to my master, I will definitely follow the tradition of dispatching three matchmakers for negotiation

84
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:37,070
and ask for her hand in marriage with ten streets of dowry.

85
00:09:38,980 --> 00:09:42,860
If I cannot spend this lifetime together with you,

86
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:46,420
I won't be happy no matter what.

87
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:51,360
Don't worry. I won't leave you.

88
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,860
Let's leave the martial arts world and open a sweet shop or a rouge shop!

89
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,550
We can raise cows, farm, or do anything!

90
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,300
How about it?

91
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,600
A'Xiang!

92
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,850
Go find Lord Seventh!

93
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,050
Yu Qiufeng, are you crazy?

94
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:47,870
You really... forgot me?

95
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,960
Qianqiao!

96
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:24,740
Everyone is risking their lives to fight for the Glazed Armor

97
00:12:24,740 --> 00:12:26,990
and are killing each other.

98
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,340
However, they don't know that

99
00:12:30,340 --> 00:12:33,830
all the Glazed Armor is in my possession.

100
00:12:33,830 --> 00:12:37,020
Even the key is in my hands.

101
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:49,710
Father, why are you looking at me like that?

102
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:55,030
Are you unwilling to admit defeat?

103
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:57,660
Since Wen Kexing faked his own death,

104
00:12:57,660 --> 00:13:01,560
then the body beneath White Deer Cliff is naturally fake as well.

105
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,650
The key found on the body

106
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:06,170
is obviously also fake.

107
00:13:06,170 --> 00:13:08,460
The true key...

108
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,050
was already traded to me by Wen Kexing in exchange for collaboration.

109
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,220
Everything's set.

110
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:25,380
This piece... is the Glazed Armor you gifted me.

111
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,710
This...

112
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:40,440
was always in Window of Heaven's possession.

113
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:43,200
Now, Mo Huaiyang has fallen into my trap

114
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:46,000
and will soon send me the remaining three pieces of Glazed Armor.

115
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,130
Father,

116
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:51,680
these few things that you've longed for these past twenty years

117
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,020
have, in an instant,

118
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,320
all entered the palm of my hand.

119
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:05,110
There are some things that,

120
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:10,850
when they are grown in me, are called ambition.

121
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:16,500
When grown in others, they are called delusional thinking.

122
00:14:19,170 --> 00:14:23,490
In you, they are called...

123
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,890
I've forgotten. I've forgotten!

124
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,970
You have no heart.

125
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:16,360
Stop!

126
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,630
Wen Kexing, if you dare to move about,

127
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,230
I will take her life immediately!

128
00:15:31,270 --> 00:15:33,400
If you'd like her to live, that's also fine.

129
00:15:33,400 --> 00:15:36,950
Hand over the Glazed Armor and the key to the armory immediately!

130
00:15:36,950 --> 00:15:39,670
I can give you anything as long as you let her go!

131
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,150
She's only a young girl!

132
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,850
Young girl?

133
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:46,770
This wicked woman's wicked methods are unparalleled!

134
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:51,820
She completely tricked my disciple and my junior brother

135
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:55,020
and forced me to clean out my own sect!

136
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,930
- You killed them?
- Shut up!

137
00:16:01,330 --> 00:16:06,350
This is the true final war

138
00:16:06,350 --> 00:16:10,840
where everyone looks to the profits ahead without knowledge of danger behind.
(T/N: Literally, "the mantis stalks the cicada without knowing that the oriole is stalking it)

139
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,610
But they don't know

140
00:16:13,610 --> 00:16:15,390
that I...

141
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:19,150
am the true hunter.

142
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:35,690
Where are the items? Take them out!

143
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,420
I'll give them to you!

144
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,090
What tricks are you playing?

145
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,170
Drug Men Army?

146
00:17:09,170 --> 00:17:10,720
It's the Drug Men Army!

147
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,170
Retreat!

148
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:14,970
Retreat! It's the Drug Men Army!

149
00:17:15,730 --> 00:17:17,570
A'Xiang!

150
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:34,450
A'Xiang! A'Xiang!

151
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:38,630
I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill him!

152
00:17:40,090 --> 00:17:42,780
A'Xiang! A'Xiang!

153
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,440
Master...

154
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,280
I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill him!

155
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:55,120
I'm not your master...

156
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:59,400
I'm your brother.

157
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,490
Brother...

158
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,410
Kill him for me.

159
00:18:06,410 --> 00:18:10,350
I've never begged you for anything.

160
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:14,370
Help me kill him!

161
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:16,420
I will kill him for you.

162
00:18:17,090 --> 00:18:19,460
I will kill him for you.

163
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,400
Thank—

164
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,810
Thank you... Thank you, Brother.

165
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:35,720
You... have to stay well.

166
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:44,500
A'Xiang... can't take care of you anymore...

167
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:49,240
I'm going to go find...

168
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:53,680
my Eldest Brother Cao... that idiot...

169
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:04,950
A'Xiang...

170
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,980
A'Xiang!

171
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,800
A'Xiang!

172
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,160
Master! Master! Master!

173
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,550
Master, are you all right? Are you still dizzy or still feeling hungry?

174
00:19:41,550 --> 00:19:42,860
Should I make food for you?

175
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:45,280
My good master...

176
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:51,290
I'm all right! I'll be better after some rest!

177
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,630
Master, you-you bastard!

178
00:19:53,630 --> 00:19:56,840
Look at that. This little servant is disobeying her master.

179
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,390
Master, you don't want me anymore?

180
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:33,280
♫ Burdened feelings tangle in my mind;
dismissing love and hate ♫

181
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,800
♫ I only wish you would never say goodbye ♫

182
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:47,680
♫ My only wish is to walk this mortal realm
with your hand in mine ♫

183
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:52,360
♫ and live this life ♫

184
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:58,790
♫ Fate and destiny can't be decided by ourselves ♫

185
00:20:58,790 --> 00:21:05,180
♫ How did our infatuation lead us astray? ♫

186
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:11,210
♫ You and I are destined for each other ♫

187
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:18,080
♫ yet our hearts cannot have our yearnings in the martial world ♫

188
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:24,430
♫ Wish we could stay together to the ends of the earth ♫

189
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:30,840
♫ and to have never entered the world of martial artists ♫

190
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:36,830
♫ If there is a next life, I wouldn't fail you, my love ♫

191
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:44,790
♫ In this terrible world of carnage and warfare,
I only anticipate the next twilight ♫

192
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:36,000
Scorpion King! I never thought I'd be tricked by Scorpion King!

193
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:43,980
Sect Leader Mo, as per someone's request I've come to send you off!

194
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,700
Little brat.

195
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,000
I'm sorry, A'Xiang.

196
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,400
I let this bastard die too easily.

197
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,400
Just wait.

198
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,230
I'll come and find you now.

199
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,400
I hope you've been well, Ghost Chief.

200
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
Ally,

201
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:36,600
you were still so glorious last time we met. Now,

202
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,400
how have you fallen into this state?

203
00:27:57,800 --> 00:28:00,500
Mo Huaiyang's three Glazed Armor pieces

204
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:04,200
will now be taken by me. You don't mind, do you, Ghost Chief?

205
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Now that you've taken them, scram. Don't disturb my sunbathing.

206
00:28:14,200 --> 00:28:19,400
My King, I've admired this Valley Chief Wen for a long time now.

207
00:28:19,400 --> 00:28:23,100
How about you let me send him—

208
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,600
A person like the Ghost Chief

209
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,000
naturally must be personally sent off by me.

210
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,600
Letting anyone else do this work would be disrespectful.

211
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:05,800
You dare to touch someone of my Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

212
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:07,600
Commander Zhou,

213
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:11,700
how did your martial arts suddenly improve so much?

214
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Idiot. Why have you come?

215
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,200
I've come to die with you, madman.

216
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:25,800
Commander Zhou, Valley Chief Wen. What's the point of this?

217
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,600
No one will leave Ghost Valley alive today.

218
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,400
This valley is full of my children.

219
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:36,000
Even if I die here today,

220
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:38,600
I will drag you down with me.

221
00:29:41,900 --> 00:29:44,220
You two live and die together.

222
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:46,500
What's the point in dragging me down with you?

223
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:51,200
How uninteresting would the path to the netherworld be?

224
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,500
We are all smart people. Is there not a second choice?

225
00:29:56,190 --> 00:29:57,660
All right.

226
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:01,000
We can give you the Glazed Armor,

227
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,600
but I am leaving with this person.

228
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,280
Then leave.

229
00:30:25,060 --> 00:30:26,850
Uninteresting.

230
00:30:28,600 --> 00:30:30,400
Incredibly uninteresting.

231
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:56,000
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

232
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:04,200
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

233
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:12,000
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river
but can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

234
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:19,700
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

235
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:27,000
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late;
don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

236
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:35,100
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

237
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:42,300
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills;
the past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

238
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:45,200
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

239
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:46,900
Old Wen!

240
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:50,420
There is light...

241
00:31:54,590 --> 00:31:56,710
on your body.

242
00:32:03,070 --> 00:32:05,250
I want to catch it and take a look.

243
00:32:17,050 --> 00:32:20,410
♫ The trees fall boundlessly  ♫

244
00:32:20,410 --> 00:32:24,260
♫ as the Yangtze river rolls without end ♫

245
00:32:24,260 --> 00:32:32,950
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫

246
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:45,890
Reporting to Commander. The bodies of the Top Ten Evil Ghosts have been found. None have escaped.

247
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:47,920
The three betrayers are locked in Hantan Water Dungeon.

248
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:53,440
I have gotten rid of them all. Tragicomic Ghost, Ghoul, and Alluring Ghost have all died in battle.

249
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:55,020
Alluring Ghost, Liu Qianqiao?

250
00:32:55,020 --> 00:32:56,520
Yes, sir.

251
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,940
Does Scorpion King have any questions?

252
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:03,630
No. It's nothing.

253
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:07,170
Commander, we are still counting the bodies of the sect leaders.

254
00:33:07,170 --> 00:33:09,910
We have not yet found the bodies of Gentle Wind Sword Sect's Mo Huaiyang, Fan Huaikong,

255
00:33:09,910 --> 00:33:11,610
or Mo Weixu.

256
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:13,940
I've already killed Mo Huaiyang.

257
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,270
His body is outside the valley.

258
00:33:16,270 --> 00:33:19,060
Fan Huaikong was killed by Mo Huaiyang.

259
00:33:19,060 --> 00:33:23,490
Mo Weixu's whereabouts are unknown. There is no need to care about that.

260
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:27,290
Have you heard Great Scorpion King's words? Go ahead then.

261
00:33:27,290 --> 00:33:28,890
Yes, sir.

262
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:35,530
Who would've thought the Drug Men army's small demonstration had such

263
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:37,310
tremendous power?

264
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:39,130
With such unique forces,

265
00:33:39,130 --> 00:33:42,170
why would accomplishing the prince's plans be any cause for worry?

266
00:33:43,450 --> 00:33:46,890
Opening the armory is no doubt a first-class merit,

267
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,320
but this battle on Mount Qingya

268
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:52,470
has created devastating losses for the martial arts world.

269
00:33:52,470 --> 00:33:55,080
Many people have died as well.

270
00:33:55,610 --> 00:33:58,140
They'll have to recover for twenty to thirty years again.

271
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:01,160
That is also a first-class merit. Scorpion King,

272
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,950
you and I match very well together!

273
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,520
Ever since Madam Poison introduced us,

274
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,910
I've enjoyed rapid advances in my career.

275
00:34:10,910 --> 00:34:12,630
That's odd.

276
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:16,500
What does the mass death in the Central Plains have to do with you?

277
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:21,530
Old Duan, from what I see, you harm others without benefit.

278
00:34:21,530 --> 00:34:24,100
Happy for no reason.

279
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,790
Madam, this is where you are limited in experience.
(T/N: Literally, "your hair is long but your experience is short")

280
00:34:28,790 --> 00:34:31,290
Historically, martial artists have tended to violate bans.

281
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:35,050
These martial artists love to fish for fame and credit.

282
00:34:35,050 --> 00:34:38,540
The prince is ready to act. He'll have to take care of these bandits sometime.

283
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:40,310
This time, we killed two birds with one stone.

284
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:42,390
Is that not a double—

285
00:34:42,390 --> 00:34:44,880
Then, why did you work with Zhao Jing before?

286
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:46,630
Nothing is deceitful in war.

287
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:48,610
As if I would believe you.

288
00:34:48,610 --> 00:34:52,190
You old men are all cunning bastards.

289
00:34:52,190 --> 00:34:56,260
Plotting against each other and scheming every day.

290
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,320
Aren't you tired?

291
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:51,950
Master, it's me.

292
00:35:51,950 --> 00:35:53,870
A'Xiang.

293
00:36:07,090 --> 00:36:10,620
I met Mother and Father.

294
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:13,130
They want to thank you.

295
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:16,410
They want to say something to you.

296
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:19,400
I'm feeling pain all over my body right now.

297
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,430
Another day.

298
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:31,110
Then drink a cup of tea.

299
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:38,570
I'm so tired.

300
00:36:38,570 --> 00:36:40,520
Leave.

301
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,300
Okay.

302
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,550
Then I'll be leaving.

303
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,660
Brother.

304
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,480
You have to...

305
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:31,610
be well.

306
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:46,150
A'Xiang?

307
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,730
A'Xiang!

308
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,130
A'Xiang!

309
00:38:39,830 --> 00:38:43,560
Lord Seventh. Great Shaman.

310
00:38:45,620 --> 00:38:47,220
Zishu!

311
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,460
It's all thanks to your help

312
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:55,280
that they could be brought out.

313
00:38:57,260 --> 00:39:01,090
You're thoughtful. It's beautiful here.

314
00:39:01,090 --> 00:39:04,950
Master, Lord Seventh just asked me

315
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:08,380
what I am going to write for Eldest Brother Cao's and Sister Xiang's tombstones.

316
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:13,450
That's right. I was thinking that since these two have not officially married yet,

317
00:39:13,450 --> 00:39:16,790
and Lady Xiang is still a girl,

318
00:39:16,790 --> 00:39:18,980
should we write her maiden name

319
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:22,260
or should we call her... Lady Cao?

320
00:39:23,280 --> 00:39:25,460
Write Lady Cao.

321
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:28,220
A'Xiang would like it.

322
00:39:32,710 --> 00:39:35,800
Master, Junior Master hasn't woken up yet?

323
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,910
I've given him Drunk Life Dream Death.

324
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,580
I don't know how to face him.

325
00:39:43,470 --> 00:39:47,670
Chengling, I hope you

326
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:51,420
will take good care of your junior master for me. All right?

327
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:55,060
Master, where are you going?

328
00:39:57,220 --> 00:40:01,300
I originally thought I could settle down.

329
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:05,450
Perhaps traveling the world...

330
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:07,580
is my fate.

331
00:40:16,110 --> 00:40:17,770
Lord Zhou,

332
00:40:18,710 --> 00:40:21,660
you've removed all the nails on your body?

333
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,790
Zishu, how could you do this to yourself?

334
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,660
You—

335
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,450
When was this?

336
00:40:29,450 --> 00:40:32,060
Before the Heroes Conference,

337
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,500
I must recover all my martial arts

338
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,710
to take revenge for him.

339
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:41,520
There is one more thing I must do.

340
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:44,270
That is to stop Prince Jin from opening the armory.

341
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,520
There isn't much time left.

342
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,660
What do you mean, there's not much time left?

343
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:53,740
Master... you won't!

344
00:40:53,740 --> 00:40:56,460
Wu Xi, is there any other method?

345
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:59,340
Look at Zishu! He looks to be in very healthy spirits.

346
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:01,730
If we act now, will we make it in time?

347
00:41:02,490 --> 00:41:06,330
Sir Wen. Sir Wen is injured, but we can go find Immortal Elder Ye.

348
00:41:06,330 --> 00:41:09,960
He is a highly-skilled martial artist. With his aid and Wu Xi's technique—

349
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:13,560
It's too late! I have already taken the Nanjiang elixir.

350
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,440
Then we can create another one!

351
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,520
I can try everything and gather all the treasures in the world!

352
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Zishu, we can always find a way.

353
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:26,420
Beiyuan... it really is too late.

354
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:29,330
Even if the Miracle Healer Valley Chief were still alive...

355
00:41:31,730 --> 00:41:36,470
We've done all we can. Now, we can only listen to fate.

356
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:39,530
Since my fate is so,

357
00:41:39,530 --> 00:41:43,820
the rest... is not important.

358
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,950
Miracle Healer Valley...

359
00:41:45,950 --> 00:41:49,640
There's still the Yin Yang Book! Master, there's a way!

360
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:53,160
Isn't it just a life for a life? I'll give my life for yours!

361
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,570
Master, let's go find the Yin Yang Book right now!

362
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:03,760
Stupid child, seeing this care you have for me

363
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:07,390
is enough for me. Listen to me.

364
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,760
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

365
00:42:49,290 --> 00:42:56,400
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

366
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:03,520
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

367
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:12,210
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

368
00:43:12,210 --> 00:43:19,060
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

369
00:43:19,060 --> 00:43:26,570
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

370
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:30,540
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

371
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:34,130
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

372
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:41,920
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

373
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:45,500
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

374
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:49,130
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

375
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:57,130
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

376
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,580
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

377
00:44:00,580 --> 00:44:04,390
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

378
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:11,390
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

379
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:20,820
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
