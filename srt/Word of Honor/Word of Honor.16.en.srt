00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,800
and going straight home instead?

170
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,200
The heroes in the world are gathering at the conference today.

171
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:06,500
This is a great opportunity to make a name for ourselves.

172
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,800
How could you be absent at such an exciting event?

173
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:12,000
Besides, you and Supreme Leader Gao are close.

174
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,600
Shouldn't we...

175
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,200
Shut up!

176
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,300
I said we're going back to the mountain.

177
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:21,310
[Mo Huaiyang - Leader of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect]

178
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:12,600
Chengling, eat something first.

179
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,800
Thank you, Master.

180
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:19,100
Right, Master, where's Uncle Wen?

181
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,200
You eat first.

182
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,000
He's just outside.

183
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,700
I'm going to find him.

184
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,500
A'Xu,

185
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,400
aren't I an evil person?

186
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:06,700
If your heart is kind, you cannot be considered evil.

187
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,200
Are you the only one allowed to trick others?

188
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:22,800
If you react so terribly after others trick you just once, then you are a good-for-nothing.

189
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,200
You're even worse than my disciple.

190
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,400
I made a big mistake this time.

191
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,800
I went to gleefully watch a disaster unfold at someone else's act,

192
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:41,600
but I didn't expect to be one of the actors myself.

193
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Tell me. Did I fall victim to my own ingenuity?

194
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,000
You really know how to compliment yourself.

195
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,700
This is called falling victim to your own idiocy.

196
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,200
Officer Zhou, you're smart.

197
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,000
Did you understand what happened?

198
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,800
This scheme progressed seamlessly.

199
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:06,200
There must be someone controlling it from behind the scenes.

200
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:08,000
Maybe even more than one.

201
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:12,600
As of right now, I cannot tell what this person's end goal is.

202
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,900
Is it not for the Glazed Armor?

203
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,000
Not just that.

204
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:20,200
No matter what, Gao Chong's reputation is ruined

205
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
and the Five Lakes Alliance cannot be recovered.

206
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,800
Not necessarily.

207
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:26,300
Compared to Gao Chong,

208
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:29,800
Zhao Jing took a step back at the most important moment.

209
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,600
He pretended he was weak

210
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:34,100
and moved the blame off of himself completely.

211
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,300
I remember in the Window of Heaven's records,

212
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,400
aside from his nickname Sai Mengchang,
(T/N: Historical figure, known for bounty)

213
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:44,000
he had another one called Zhao Xuande.
(T/N: Historical figure, driven to be a hero)

214
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,700
I didn't care much about it at the time,

215
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:47,800
but now that I think about it,

216
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:51,000
his act of crying and using morals

217
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:56,000
to win everyone over was truly spectacular.

218
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,000
Zhao Xuande?

219
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,600
Who gave him that nickname?

220
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,100
What a bad person.

221
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,400
Almost as bad as you.

222
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:09,700
I'm bad?

223
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:14,000
Philanthropist Wen, I've always been kind to you.

224
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,900
Really?

225
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:17,700
How come I didn't know?

226
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,200
The truth is hard to find, and a scheme is hard to plan.

227
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,400
No matter how hard a person tries

228
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:29,000
to carefully consider and balance each step,

229
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:33,400
in the end, human tricks can never outsmart the heavens.

230
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,700
Breaking a carefully planned scheme is too easy.

231
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:40,400
It might be because of one person's sudden betrayal,

232
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,500
or because of a period of unexpected rain.

233
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,200
No matter how deep the scheme is,

234
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,600
there will be a day when the truth is revealed.

235
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,500
As long as you patiently peel back the layers,

236
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:56,600
you will eventually... find the missing key.

237
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,000
That means a perfect scheme

238
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:04,400
changes and adapts to the situation.

239
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,200
What the person in control needs to do

240
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,300
is to clearly assess the situation,

241
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:11,200
and push things along at the right moment.

242
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,600
It's hard to read someone's heart

243
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,400
but easy to control human nature.

244
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:25,500
Endless greed is human nature.

245
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:28,700
This is an unarguable truth.

246
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,700
Old Wen, don't keep thinking that you can see through human nature.

247
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,600
First, it was the matter of Four Sages of Anji, and now Gao Chong.

248
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,000
Have you still not made enough mistakes?

249
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:52,600
Your radical stubbornness will only harm yourself.

250
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,700
It's true that human nature can be greedy,

251
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:58,600
but hasn't righteousness and loyalty also always existed?

252
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:02,000
What do you actually want?

253
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:06,000
If I told you, would you help me?

254
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,800
I can only help you if you tell me.

255
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,400
I want...

256
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:23,000
I want the demons and monsters that don't belong to this world

257
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,200
to all scram back to their eighteen layers of Hell!

258
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,800
Judging from Gao Chong's martial arts skills,

259
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,400
he absolutely could've escaped and found a way out,

260
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,100
but who knew?

261
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,200
As soon as the Five Lakes Monument collapsed,

262
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,600
he had a complete breakdown and used death as an apology.

263
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,000
He's already dead,

264
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,400
so doesn't it mean that he's lost everything?

265
00:24:08,200 --> 00:24:10,400
Father, you really anticipated everything

266
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:13,000
and read him correctly.

267
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:16,700
A strong person is easily broken, an innocent person is easily tainted.

268
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,600
The baggage that Gao Chong carried

269
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,800
had burdened him for too many years.

270
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:25,800
I've also played this game with him for twenty years.

271
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:29,200
It only took one last straw to squash him to death.

272
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,400
Now, things are good.

273
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:35,200
I, Zhao Jing, have accomplished everything I needed to.

274
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,600
It's just a pity that it didn't go perfectly.

275
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,400
What didn't go perfectly?

276
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,000
I made so many calculations,

277
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:53,500
but I didn't expect that Elder Huang would come out and fool me.

278
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,500
He had Tao Hong and Lv Liu kidnap Gao Xiaolian away.

279
00:24:57,500 --> 00:25:00,000
I've already sent people after them.

280
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:08,800
Father, should we kill Gao Xiaolian to silence her?

281
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:10,900
Absolutely not.

282
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,900
I want her to live and to live well.

283
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,000
She is currently my living mascot.

284
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:19,800
The better her life is,

285
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,200
the more it can demonstrate my righteousness and nobility.

286
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,000
Okay, I will listen to you.

287
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,679
You made a huge contribution this time.

288
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:38,400
If you didn't use sorcery to completely muddle Deng Kuan's brain,

289
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:42,800
defeating Gao Chong definitely would not have been so easy.

290
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:47,800
However, you see, Gao Chong's disciples are each completely loyal.

291
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:50,700
Especially that Song Huairen.

292
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,200
I treated him with so much dedication,

293
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:57,200
but I didn't expect him to turn out to be a double agent.

294
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:02,800
I said long ago that that man by the surname of Song wasn't a good person.

295
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:04,500
Father, you didn't believe me.

296
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,800
You even took him as your godchild.

297
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,700
You also had a huge fight with me and got mad at me for that.

298
00:26:10,700 --> 00:26:13,400
How about it? Do you see now?

299
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:15,400
Wasn't I correct?

300
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,300
Scorpion King, it's you? You scared me.

301
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:38,600
Did Father tell you to come?

302
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:39,900
Yes.

303
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,600
Give me the Glazed Armor.

304
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,800
Wait.

305
00:26:49,800 --> 00:26:53,000
Do you have Father's verbal order or official seal?

306
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:55,900
I already came in person.

307
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,600
What official seal would you need?

308
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:00,400
This is an extremely important matter, and we can't overlook anything.

309
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,000
Father only told me to steal this at night,

310
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,900
but he never told me to transfer it to you.

311
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:11,000
What did you say?

312
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,700
Without the official seal,

313
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
I won't give this to you.

314
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,700
We are both Father's trusted confidantes.

315
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,400
Naturally...

316
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,900
Never mind, go.

317
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,900
Naturally, you must die

318
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:43,900
while I live.

319
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,500
How could I let my plans

320
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:02,100
get ruined by others?

321
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:08,800
I can achieve the goals on my own.

322
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,100
Wasn't I right?

323
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:13,000
Good thing I killed Song Huairen.

324
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,400
Otherwise, Father,

325
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,000
your Glazed Armor and plans would've all been ruined.

326
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,400
All right, all right! I was wrong.

327
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,000
Scorpion, I'm sorry.

328
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:28,200
From now on, you are my only good son.

329
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
Where is the Glazed Armor?

330
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,400
This is your trust in me.

331
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:35,800
I always keep it on me.

332
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:38,200
Scorpion,

333
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:41,000
my life and all that I have are in your hands.

334
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:45,000
You are the only person I trust in this world.

335
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:48,600
There is one more thing I need you to do.

336
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,800
Father, order me however you wish.

337
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:54,600
We still need to appease that idiot, Mu Siyuan.

338
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,800
We have places we will need to use him for in the future.

339
00:28:57,800 --> 00:29:00,000
That idiotic mule Mu Siyuan

340
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:04,000
is below average at martial arts, dumb like a cow, and ugly.

341
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,200
What use is it to keep him around?

342
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,600
Scorpion,

343
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,800
Imagine a sheep herd.

344
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:20,500
A herd of sheep can do nothing but stupidly crowd together.

345
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,000
As long as one head sheep takes the lead,

346
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:26,000
the rest of the idiotic sheep will scramble after,

347
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,600
even if the lead sheep is going into the wolves' den.

348
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,800
The Five Lakes Alliance is the sheep herd

349
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:39,400
and Mu Siyuan is my chosen lead sheep.

350
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,600
I'm never able to be as farsighted as you are, Father.

351
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:49,200
Anyway, I will always listen to you from now on.

352
00:29:52,170 --> 00:29:55,490
As long as our motives are aligned,

353
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,690
the martial arts world, the lands,

354
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:01,580
and the rest of the world

355
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,620
will be in our posession sooner or later.

356
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:35,710
Qin Huaizhang's disciple,

357
00:30:35,710 --> 00:30:38,069
I didn't expect that although your martial arts are bad, you're a fast runner.

358
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:39,069
It made it hard for me to find you.

359
00:30:39,070 --> 00:30:41,410
Senior, we meet again.

360
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,930
What do you mean, "again"?

361
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:45,070
I've been following you all this time.

362
00:30:45,070 --> 00:30:47,150
Except this person was too much of a nuisance.

363
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:49,850
He held me up, so I lost you.

364
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:52,270
Master!

365
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:00,390
Chengling, this is Ye Baiyi; Senior Ye.

366
00:31:00,390 --> 00:31:04,170
Senior, this is my disciple. Chengling.

367
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:06,130
Seems dumb.

368
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:08,940
Each generation is getting worse and worse.

369
00:31:08,940 --> 00:31:10,670
No matter how dumb my child is,

370
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,500
he's still much better than those old monsters who open their mouths but don't speak humanely.

371
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,690
Your child? What?

372
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,820
Are you also from the Four Seasons Mountain Villa?

373
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,760
Let me go!

374
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,519
Who's in there?

375
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,389
- Who do you hope is in there?
- You.

376
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,000
Then it's definitely not whom you're hoping for.

377
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:31,780
Drop it.

378
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,939
You weaker-than-a-pretty-boy old toad monster—

379
00:31:33,939 --> 00:31:35,399
Who do you think you are,

380
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,879
daring to fight against me? Let's fight outside.

381
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,440
- A'Xu, don't stop me!
- Wait!

382
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:39,640
- Let's go!
- Let it go!

383
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:42,329
Senior Ye, look! It's raining outside.

384
00:31:42,329 --> 00:31:44,930
Can you two pick a clearer day to fight?

385
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:47,800
Old Wen!

386
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:49,600
Let me go!

387
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,279
Let me go!

388
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,969
Little idiot, who did you think was in there?

389
00:31:55,969 --> 00:31:57,709
I thought it was Senior Sister Xiaolian.

390
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,589
Chengling,

391
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:01,380
they need to use Miss Gao to find the Glazed Armor.

392
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,310
As long as that holds true,

393
00:32:03,310 --> 00:32:04,820
they won't harm her.

394
00:32:04,820 --> 00:32:07,960
We have time to rescue her.

395
00:32:08,470 --> 00:32:10,039
I had almost forgotten.

396
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:13,239
A'Xu still has a disciple-in-law lost out there.

397
00:32:13,239 --> 00:32:15,530
Of course, we will rescue her.

398
00:32:20,210 --> 00:32:21,900
Young Leader Long.

399
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,500
Brother Huang.

400
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:32,310
How did it go?

401
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,200
We went through all of that trouble for nothing.

402
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,109
At least we still have that damned girl.

403
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,639
Let me think about whether we should first use her to negotiate with Zhao Jing

404
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:48,679
or first trick that idiot Shen Shen.

405
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:51,069
Who exactly has the Glazed Armor?

406
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:53,510
- No one.
- No one?

407
00:32:53,590 --> 00:32:55,750
Before that bastard died,

408
00:32:55,750 --> 00:32:59,009
he said that he had already destroyed the Glazed Armor.

409
00:32:59,009 --> 00:33:00,829
I don't believe that!

410
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:04,530
However, he really didn't have it on him.

411
00:33:04,530 --> 00:33:07,050
How could he not have had it?

412
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,260
What did we do all this for?

413
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,010
Where is Gao Chong's corpse?

414
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:13,949
Did the Five Lakes Alliance take it back?

415
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,460
Corpse?

416
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:18,709
How could there be any corpse left?

417
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:21,960
All of those crazy dogs tore it apart.

418
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:25,160
But the Glazed Armor really wasn't there.

419
00:33:26,075 --> 00:33:29,440
[Chongwu Hall]

420
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,060
Fifth Brother!

421
00:33:43,530 --> 00:33:45,130
Fifth Brother!

422
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,580
Fifth Brother!

423
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:56,879
Fifth Brother, where are you going?

424
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,600
Eldest Brother just died.

425
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,100
Are you going to leave this mess for me?

426
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,010
Why should I stay?

427
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:07,000
How could I have the dignity to remain?

428
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:08,468
If I hadn't created all of the trouble,

429
00:34:08,469 --> 00:34:09,948
Eldest Brother wouldn't have—

430
00:34:09,949 --> 00:34:12,869
Fifth Brother, among the five brothers,

431
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:14,669
we are the only two left now.

432
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,330
If you leave,

433
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:18,380
the Five Lakes Alliance will really be dispersed!

434
00:34:18,380 --> 00:34:20,800
Xiaolian is still lost out there.

435
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,660
Before he died, Eldest Brother told me

436
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:25,320
I must bring Xiaolian back safely.

437
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,559
Everyone in the Alliance will do their best to look for her.

438
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:30,060
Yaozhi went to search as well.

439
00:34:30,529 --> 00:34:33,420
Listen to me. Don't go.

440
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:35,599
The Five Lakes Alliance can't be without a leader.

441
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:36,839
Stay!

442
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:38,260
My departure...

443
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:41,200
would be better than my staying here!

444
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:46,360
If I can find Xiaolian,

445
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:49,020
I will bring her to the bamboo forest on Mount Dagu

446
00:34:49,900 --> 00:34:52,760
and never come back to this place of sorrow.

447
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:55,100
Second Brother,

448
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,930
the Five Lakes Alliance...

449
00:35:01,660 --> 00:35:03,600
rests upon your shoulders.

450
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:05,960
I'm useless.

451
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,170
I'm sorry.

452
00:35:33,180 --> 00:35:34,880
Father,

453
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:36,880
you're going to just let him go?

454
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:38,600
The Glazed Armor...

455
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:41,909
Gao Chong was smart and conniving.

456
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:46,119
He anticipated a rebellion at the Heroes Conference

457
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,480
and was afraid that Shen Shen would be unable to protect himself,

458
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,810
so he protected the Glazed Armor himself.

459
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,750
Who cares whether that's true or not?

460
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:58,050
Let me catch up and kill him.

461
00:35:58,050 --> 00:35:59,620
Absolutely not!

462
00:35:59,630 --> 00:36:01,810
I need Shen Shen to stay alive.

463
00:36:01,810 --> 00:36:04,020
If you act on your own impulse,

464
00:36:04,430 --> 00:36:06,460
don't blame me for being heartless.

465
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,650
Yes.

466
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,660
You need to understand my intentions.

467
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:14,320
I patiently endured for half of my life.

468
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,330
I'm finally about to be successful.

469
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:22,330
If I don't have an old friend to witness it,

470
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,630
then this journey I've been on

471
00:36:24,630 --> 00:36:27,560
would've been walked in the dark.

472
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:30,500
I can bear witness for you, Father.

473
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:35,190
You don't count.

474
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:41,149
You and I are family. We are one.

475
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:43,050
You are not an outsider.

476
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,440
Here.

477
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,920
Everyone on this list needs to be killed.

478
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:53,070
Use a cruel method,

479
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,050
and don't leave anyone alive.

480
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:01,050
Scorpion, I want you to understand

481
00:37:01,050 --> 00:37:03,210
that what enslaves the heart

482
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:05,800
is not just greed.

483
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:08,020
Then what else?

484
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,920
Father, please teach me.

485
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,390
Fear.

486
00:37:24,290 --> 00:37:27,160
Qin Huaizhang's disciple, do you have food?

487
00:37:27,770 --> 00:37:29,900
Senior, I have a name.

488
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,730
I'll call you whatever I want.

489
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:33,470
Stop saying nonsense.

490
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:36,860
You're right, Senior.

491
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:37,949
I'm right?

492
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:39,650
Where's the food?

493
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:47,850
What's this?

494
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:49,940
Is this for humans?

495
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:52,999
Chengling,

496
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:56,029
did your family have the 40th scroll of the Shuowen Jiezi?
(T/N: An ancient Chinese dictionary that analyzed the structure of Chinese characters)

497
00:37:56,029 --> 00:37:59,010
What? Y-Yes, I think.

498
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,360
Then, was the illustration next to the phrase, "hated by demons and gods"

499
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:05,060
of this dignified face?

500
00:38:08,010 --> 00:38:09,119
I heard earlier

501
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,389
that someone who was boldly saying he wanted the truth

502
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:12,909
got badly tricked by others,

503
00:38:12,909 --> 00:38:14,670
and even helped them in their scheme.

504
00:38:14,670 --> 00:38:17,090
How are you shameless enough to boast here?

505
00:38:17,470 --> 00:38:18,599
Hey, boy.

506
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,319
On your family's Shuowen Jiezi,

507
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,759
the word "laughingstock"

508
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,750
must be paired with this dignified face, right?

509
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:25,590
You want to find the truth?

510
00:38:25,590 --> 00:38:27,180
Do you think the truth is a rabbit
(T/N: A story about a rabbit that crashed into a farmer's tree stump, dying. The farmer stood by the stump every day after, hoping for the same luck)

511
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,389
and that as long as you guard a tree stump, it will smash its head next to you?
(T/N: A story about a rabbit that crashed into a farmer's tree stump, dying. The farmer stood by the stump every day after, hoping for the same luck)

512
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:30,519
If you want the truth, go find it.
(T/N: A story about a rabbit that crashed into a farmer's tree stump, dying. The farmer stood by the stump every day after, hoping for the same luck)

513
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,589
Do you know where to find it? Can you even find it?

514
00:38:32,589 --> 00:38:33,880
You!

515
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:44,270
Senior, please teach us.

516
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:49,359
Do you think Gao Chong tried so hard to invite this boy

517
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,150
just so he could say a few pointless words at the Heroes Conference?

518
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,880
The Dragon Pool Cabinet is in the hands of his old man.

519
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:56,810
They're basically a theater troupe.

520
00:38:56,810 --> 00:38:59,919
But the "Leader of the Dragon Pool Cabinet" is a title worth nothing now.

521
00:38:59,919 --> 00:39:02,250
What use does this brat have?

522
00:39:02,250 --> 00:39:04,429
Old monster, stop with the suspense.

523
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:06,050
Why did you capture him?

524
00:39:06,050 --> 00:39:08,100
Shut up, you little idiot.

525
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:10,540
He's the key.

526
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,680
Key?

527
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:16,100
Don't you want to know what happened

528
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:18,770
to Rong Xuan and the Glazed Armor 20 years ago?

529
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,890
The Dragon Pool Cabinet is the key to opening the past.

530
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:23,820
Why would I...

531
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,570
want to know about Rong Xuan and the Glazed Armor?

532
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,039
When you're as old as me, you'll know why.

533
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:32,770
Sometimes, finding out what someone else wants

534
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,800
isn't so hard.

535
00:40:11,243 --> 00:40:17,763
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

536
00:40:19,123 --> 00:40:24,923
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

537
00:40:26,323 --> 00:40:32,243
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

538
00:40:33,523 --> 00:40:40,363
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

539
00:40:41,803 --> 00:40:47,923
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

540
00:40:49,023 --> 00:40:55,923
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

541
00:40:56,483 --> 00:41:00,522
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

542
00:41:00,523 --> 00:41:03,563
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

543
00:41:04,083 --> 00:41:11,702
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

544
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:15,182
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

545
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:18,722
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

546
00:41:18,723 --> 00:41:26,403
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

547
00:41:26,963 --> 00:41:30,402
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

548
00:41:30,403 --> 00:41:34,202
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

549
00:41:34,202 --> 00:41:40,323
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

550
00:41:41,403 --> 00:41:49,243
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
