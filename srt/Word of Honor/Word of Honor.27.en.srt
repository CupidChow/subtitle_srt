[Episode 27]

23
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:54,250
Zhou Zishu?

24
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:57,610
Elder Ye, I have been waiting for you.

25
00:03:57,610 --> 00:04:00,620
Thank you, Elder Ye, for making such a tiring trip.

26
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,460
Are you making fun of me?

27
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:06,820
Since you are lifelong friends with Great Shaman,

28
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,240
why did you not ask for help, yourself?

29
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:12,340
It's funny that I have become like an ignorant frog at the bottom of a well after residing for too long in the mountains.

30
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:16,070
How could I pretend to have many connections in front of the Leader of the Window of Heaven?

31
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:19,190
I apologize, Elder Ye. Before I was unaware

32
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:21,920
that the friend you spoke of was Great Shaman.

33
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:25,080
My history with them is hard to explain.

34
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,840
I have my difficulties,

35
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,600
so I never thought about going to Nanjiang for help.

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,400
This was a big misunderstanding.

37
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:35,300
Because of me, you had to travel thousands of miles.

38
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,760
I am very thankful and nothing I can do can serve as repayment.

39
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:40,620
Enough with the useless words. I don't actually care.

40
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:43,130
I'll just treat this as a wasted trip.

41
00:04:43,130 --> 00:04:46,720
It will serve as repayment for my debt to Wen Kexing.

42
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,810
Now, I only want to ask you one thing.

43
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,330
Are you aware of his identity?

44
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,990
I am.

45
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:58,200
He is your disciple, Rong Xuan

46
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,850
and Master's lifelong friend,

47
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:02,110
Zhen Ruyu, Great Warrior Zhen's son.

48
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,770
He is my lost yet recovered second junior disciple and my lifelong soulmate.

49
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:08,900
You good-for-nothing idiot!

50
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,550
I'm amazed that you are Qin Huaizhang's disciple, yet you can be tricked by that brat.

51
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,940
I'm telling you,

52
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,800
Wen Kexing is the current Chief of Ghost Valley.

53
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,020
Every sect has a copy of the collection of ghost portraits.

54
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:22,810
These evil ghosts will have nowhere to go from now on.

55
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:25,320
Did you think he hid his identity

56
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,460
to follow you for so long because he had good intentions?

57
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,200
I just never expected

58
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,160
the Zhen couple were such great warriors,

59
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:36,200
yet they raised such a good-for-nothing bastard.

60
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,020
However, maybe that little bastard

61
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:40,180
isn't the Zhen couple's son.

62
00:05:40,180 --> 00:05:41,900
He is.

63
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:49,070
So, you knew he was the Chief of Ghost Valley much earlier?

64
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,590
Not early enough.

65
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:53,510
Thankfully, it is not too late.

66
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:55,490
You have already

67
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:57,740
sided with the Ghost chief?

68
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:09,330
I see. I never thought I, Ye Baiyi,

69
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:11,920
would be led by the nose by two little brats.

70
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,180
Elder, I did not purposefully conceal this.

71
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:19,890
It was only after entering Dragon Pool Cabinet

72
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:23,150
that I realized Old Wen was Zhen Yan.

73
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:26,870
No matter what, he first became my junior brother

74
00:06:26,870 --> 00:06:28,640
and then entered Ghost Valley after.

75
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,760
If we had been able to bring him back to Four Seasons Mountain Villa at the time,

76
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:33,740
the events afterward would not have happened!

77
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,630
From an emotional and rational standpoint, I cannot stay an outsider.

78
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:40,610
Emotional and rational?

79
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,740
Since the Ghost Valley appeared in the martial arts world, bloodshed and violence have never ended.

80
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:47,680
Do you know how many innocent people have died?

81
00:06:48,330 --> 00:06:50,170
Zhou Zishu,

82
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,020
right now, you can only see that bit of kinship you have.

83
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:54,780
Where is there any righteousness or justice?

84
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:58,870
You're so muddled and selfish; isn't this an embarrassment to Qin Huaizhang's cultivation of you?

85
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,100
Elder, even after all these days of interaction,

86
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,220
do you still not know Old Wen's true nature?

87
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,550
Although he has entered Ghost Valley, his true nature is not lost.

88
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,600
Ghost Valley's sins cannot be counted towards him alone.

89
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,490
Don't you think your own words are hilarious?

90
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:14,670
If Wen Kexing can become the Ghost Chief in a place filled with thousands of savage ghosts,

91
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,840
how can you claim he has not lost his true nature?

92
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:21,250
Since he is the Ghost Chief, he cannot escape from any of the sins his three thousand ghosts committed!

93
00:07:21,250 --> 00:07:23,440
I vowed by Long Bei,

94
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,720
that if one day the ghosts entered the world to bring chaos,

95
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:28,580
I, Ye Baiyi,

96
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:31,230
would annihilate Ghost Valley.

97
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:33,050
If so,

98
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,650
please come at me.

99
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,960
So you are defending the Ghost Chief to the end, then?

100
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:46,520
The person I am defending is my junior brother.

101
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,040
Since we are kin,

102
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,710
we are bound together in glory and in loss.

103
00:07:51,710 --> 00:07:54,680
Half of his sin is mine.

104
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,370
I fear you are unable to afford accepting this burden.

105
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:36,370
You truly believe I won't kill you? Don't force me to draw my sword.

106
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,410
Elder, forgive my disrespect,

107
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:43,650
but if you want to enter Four Seasons Mountain Villa today, you will have to step over my dead body.

108
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,680
Why can't I?

109
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,720
Zhou Zishu,

110
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,910
with respect to your deceased Master,

111
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,650
I will spare your measly life today.

112
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,260
If Huaizhang were still alive, he would take care of you himself.

113
00:09:38,260 --> 00:09:40,330
How would he allow a biased brat like you

114
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:43,410
dirty Four Seasons Mountain Villa's name?

115
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:49,270
You... don't understand my master at all.

116
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,020
If my master were alive today,

117
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:55,280
we would be standing together!

118
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:57,490
Stubborn idiot.

119
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:56,990
Come at me!

120
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:13,720
Wen Kexing, I've taken upon an important vow.

121
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:18,190
As long the ghosts from Ghost Valley escape Mount Qingya, they must be killed.

122
00:11:18,190 --> 00:11:20,650
As the Ghost Valley Chief, you led a group of ghosts astray

123
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:24,640
to commit evil deeds that mustn't be forgiven.

124
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:28,900
I pity your despairing life

125
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:30,310
and grant you the right to end your own life.

126
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:32,090
Don't even think about it!

127
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:33,790
If you want to kill me, then kill me!

128
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,000
Dying by your hand will make me an evil ghost

129
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,370
who will entangle with this evil world up until the very end!

130
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,170
Fine, then I'll grant you your wish.

131
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,930
You're not worthy!

132
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:49,540
Ye Baiyi,

133
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:53,960
because Zhen Ruyu sacrificed himself to protect Rong Xuan's life,

134
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:56,030
he ended up in a destroyed family.

135
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:00,790
Only because he lost his parents at an early age did my junior brother join Ghost Valley.

136
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,110
Feel your conscience and ask yourself,

137
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:07,560
anyone can judge him but do you qualify?

138
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,130
Miracle worker Zhen Ruyu was a kind philanthropist all his life.

139
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,710
He saved countless people.

140
00:12:12,710 --> 00:12:17,300
Why must his only son be treated with such injustice!

141
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,840
Exchange positions with my junior brother.

142
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:23,490
Do you dare to say you could've done better than he did?

143
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:26,820
Is it a sin to want to live on?

144
00:12:27,790 --> 00:12:29,860
Gratitude and hatred are separate.

145
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,160
My disciple and I failing the Wen family is one thing.

146
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,200
but my promise to wipe out Ghost Valley is another thing.

147
00:12:35,890 --> 00:12:38,200
Today, I want his life.

148
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,280
Later, after I wipe out Ghost Valley

149
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:44,920
and fulfill my vow, I'll use my life to repay him.

150
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,200
Ghost Valley shouldn't even exist.

151
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,800
The evil lies within people's hearts.

152
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,860
You are able to wipe out Ghost Valley,

153
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:57,830
but can you wipe out the greed and filth that lie within the hearts of people?

154
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:04,020
ElderYe, you said Master would place righteousness above family ties.

155
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,070
That's where you're wrong.

156
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,220
My master has always been rational.

157
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:12,800
If he knew about my junior brother's sufferings,

158
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,430
he would not be biased and indiscriminate like you.

159
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:22,310
He would only teach my junior brother to learn kindness

to make up for his past mistakes.

161
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:30,360
To be frank, you're not worthy of being my master's friend.

162
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,440
Nor should you reminisce the past.

163

The heavens are not kind and treat all beings as mere livestock.

166
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:12,390
Wen Kexing, if you're willing to stay in Four Seasons Mountain Villa and change yourself, I'll spare you.

167
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:15,280
But if I have to meet you in the martial arts world again,

168
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:17,380
I guarantee you I will take your life.

169
00:14:24,670 --> 00:14:28,140
A'Xu, are you all right?

170
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:34,090
I'm sorry. I had always wanted to tell you.

171
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,680
You should feel sorry to me.

172

Wen Kexing, let me ask you.

173
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:44,660
If I hadn't guessed what you had been thinking,

174
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,410
what did you plan to do

175
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,560
after meeting Ye Baiyi?

176
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,350
I-I just wanted to prevent him from getting into Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

177
00:14:58,350 --> 00:15:00,320
But what if you couldn't?

178
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,830
If I couldn't, I would just die by his hand.

179
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:10,190
It's better than having him expose my identity in front of you and Chengling.

180
00:15:19,030 --> 00:15:23,240
I should really give you a mirror to let you see how you look right now.

181
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:28,420
When did the handsome and attractive Wen Kexing become a weakling like this?

Did you intentionally lead me away to take a shortcut to stop Ye Baiyi?

Weining, who are Wen and Zhou?

Neither of them are good people.

Weining, do you know Miss Xiang's background?

Senior Brother, what do you mean?

235

She... claims to be an important elder's maid.

Have you ever met her master?

237
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:20,580
Of course I have.

238
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:24,870
It was Miss Xiang's master who personally entrusted her to me.

Senior Brother, although I know,

242
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:37,080
it's not appropriate for me to tell you

243
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:38,510
because I've promised A'Xiang

244

that I'll never reveal the identity and name of her master.

that in the martial arts world, there are all kinds of people.

251

Allow Senior Brother to say something presumptuous. These days,

252

I've noticed Miss Xiang's actions and mannerisms

253
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,030
carry some kind of evilness.

254
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:13,000
Senior Brother, please be mindful of what you say!

255

If she really had learned martial arts from respectable masters,

256
00:20:16,010 --> 00:20:18,850
it's normal for her temperament to be different from a noble lady.

A'Xiang is not evil.

258

It's natural innocence in her heart.

259
00:20:23,170 --> 00:20:26,120
Weining, if it was during peaceful times,

260

But right now, Gentle Wind Sword Sect has sealed the mountain.

I know righteousness comes first.

268
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:56,320
Supreme Leader Gao was wrongly accused

269
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:59,790
and gave something so important to Master.

270
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:04,010
Such that our Gentle Wind Sword Sect sealed the mountain for this reason.

In the future, we might face all kinds of trouble.

I think that is a responsibility we should take.

273
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:14,350
But to see every little thing as a cause for suspicion and raise accusations over a young lady's innocence over this

274
00:21:14,350 --> 00:21:15,880
is something I do not dare to agree with.

275
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,750
I am not suspicious of her. I just want to get clear answers—

Senior Brother, A'Xiang's had a difficult childhood.

277

If she doesn't want to tell me, I will respect her decision.

A'Xiang and I have undergone many hardships together.

279

I vow with my life. A'Xiang is definitely a good girl.

280
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,960
Since I have chosen her and promised her,

281
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,190
then I won't fail or be suspicious of her.

282
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:54,100
Senior Brother, I ask that you respect my decision.

283
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,900
Master, the medicinal broth is ready. Should I add it in?

284
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:30,100
If you add more, I'll be cooked alive.

285
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,400
Your body's been so weak lately. Why don't you add more hot water?

286
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,800
Master, does your injury still hurt?

287
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:42,800
Where did those stupid thieves come from?

288

Once you are healed, let's go burn down their hideout!

289
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,450
I'm all right.

290
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,200
Those thieves... were all killed by your Uncle Wen already.

Okay.

294
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,100
A'Xu, your ability to lie

295
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,800
really sucks.

296
00:23:11,800 --> 00:23:14,600
What kind of thieves would be powerful enough to injure us?

297
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,600
Thankfully our eldest disciple is an idiot.

298
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,700
My ability to lie is, of course, not as good as yours.

299
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,400
How about you come up with one?

300
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,400
A'Xu,

301
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:31,400
I don't want to lie to Chengling anymore.

302
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,380
Don't come here!

303
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,000
Just stand there and let me finish.

304
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:43,600
There are some things

305
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:47,200
I might not be able to say to your face.

306
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,000
The reason Chengling lost his family...

307
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,800
I am not necessarily...

308
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,050
completely innocent.

309
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,430
You ordered the massacre on Mirror Lake Sect?

310
00:24:02,090 --> 00:24:03,660
No!

311
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,000
Do you remember...

312
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,800
the rhyme that was popular within the martial arts world in spring?

313
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:19,200
The rhyme that went, "The water of the Five Lakes converges throughout our lands."

314
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,600
I can't forget.

315
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,890
But that rhyme's second half

316
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
"The iridescent clouds have scattered, and the Glaze has shattered."

317
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,200
"Who will cry with the Ghosts on Mount Qingya?"

318
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,400
is from my hand.

319
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,500
I knew it.

320
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:39,200
Once I spread that seed of suspicion,

321
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,800
the information would naturally spread without control.

322
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:44,000
Everyone who coveted the World's Armory

323
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:48,400
would turn their eyes on Five Lakes Alliance like flies to blood.

324
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,000
But what I don't understand is,

325
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,500
the armory's creation was decided by a group of people.

326
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:58,000
When it was time to take responsibility for the consequences, where were the five brothers?

327
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,100
My father, in order to defend them,

328
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,400
died without ever revealing the armory's secret.

329
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:06,600
But they acted like outsiders! When my whole family was banished from Miracle Healer Valley

330
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:10,400
and hunted by the entire martial arts world, where were they?

331
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:14,600
They can fight an eye for an eye,

332
00:25:14,600 --> 00:25:17,200
so why can't I pay them back, bloodshed for bloodshed?

333
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,700
Old Wen,

334
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:22,000
in these years,

335
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,500
the only thing that sustained my life

336
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:27,200
was the thirst for revenge.

337
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,000
But once I came to regret it,

338
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,800
everything was already set in stone.

339
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,100
A'Xu,

340
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,160
it's not that I've never thought about being honest with you about everything.

341
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,400
But even if you can forgive me,

342
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,100
how can I face Chengling?

343
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,650
Although I did not kill his family, they died because of my hatred.

344
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,300
What I have done to Chengling

345
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,400
is no different

346
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,700
from what the Five Lakes Alliance did to me.

347
00:26:06,210 --> 00:26:07,890
Then let me ask you...

348
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,800
Who wiped out the Mirror Lake Sect?

349
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:13,900
Do you know?

350
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,400
There might be a traitor within Ghost Valley.

351
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:21,600
It's also possible that someone is pretending to be the Ghost Valley in order to stir up chaos.

352
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,800
- Either way—
- Enough.

353
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:27,800
Once Great Shaman comes and heals my stupid wounds,

354
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:32,000
we will go investigate the truth together and take revenge for the Zhang family.

355
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:35,810
When that time comes,

356
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,400
you can explain everything to Chengling.

357
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:41,400
But again,

358
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:44,400
if Chengling hates and resents you,

359
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:48,400
you can only accept it. Does not wanting to face it

360
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,800
mean you won't face it at all?

361
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Who cares if you're a valley leader or devil leader? First and foremost, you are my junior brother.

362
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,600
Once you are done bathing,

363
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,300
hurry and go cook some good food for Chengling and me.

364
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:08,300
Life is no more than three meals a day.

365
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:13,200
Why care about some eternal sorrow? You are just creating trouble for yourself.

366
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:44,000
Father, I have received some odd news.

367
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,800
Wen Kexing's maid,

368
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:49,000
Amethyst Fiend Gu Xiang, has gone to Gentle Wind Mountain with Cao Weining.

369
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,900
I sent someone to investigate and found out

370
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:55,000
that Gentle Wind Sword Sect sealed their mountain after the Heroes Conference. No one has left or entered since.

371
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,400
And Mo Huaiyang has been in meditative seclusion for over half a year.

372
00:27:58,400 --> 00:28:00,600
No one has seen him.

373
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,690
Father!

374
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:06,010
[Once tranquility is obtained, comfort will be attained. Once there is comfort, there is time to be meticulous.]

375
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,800
I've spent the entire morning writing.

376
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,200
This is the only piece I am satisfied with.

377
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,800
Scorpion, I will give it to you.

378
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:27,000
Father, I am talking about serious business with you.

379
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:30,400
I want to go investigate the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

380
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:34,400
Investigate what?

381
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,100
The news about resuming the Heroes Conference has been dispersed throughout the martial arts world.

382
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:38,400
I don't believe

383
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,800
that Mo Huaiyang, as Gao Chong's lifelong friend, would miss out on this meeting.

384
00:28:42,800 --> 00:28:45,400
There's no need to create trouble at this time.

385
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:49,600
It is precisely because of the timing that I want to clearly investigate everything beforehand.

386
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,400
That Wen Kexing's whereabouts are already unreadable,

387
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:55,400
but he sent his confidant to follow a disciple of Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

388
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:58,000
This is very odd.

389
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,700
There is nothing to investigate.

390
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,000
I guessed long ago that Gao Chong's three Glazed Armor pieces

391
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:06,800
were most likely in Mo Huaiyang's hands.

392
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:11,400
However, Wen Kexing's reaction is not slow.

393
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,000
With Mo Huaiyang and Gao Chong's relationship,

394
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Mo Huaiyang had clearly already arrived at Yueyang Sect

395
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:25,800
but left without a word before the meeting started.

396
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,200
That is one thing.

397
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,800
Fan Huaikong attended the conference in his place

398
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:33,600
but left Gao Chong to die.

399
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:36,400
That is the second matter.

400
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:42,200
And in these recent months, there has been no news of the Glazed Armor in the martial arts world.

401
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:44,000
That is the third matter.

402
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:45,400
What's even funnier is

403
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,800
that idiot seals the mountain immediately upon return.

404
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
Is that not obvious enough?

405
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:53,480
Father,

406
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:58,600
if you already knew, why didn't you tell me?

407
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:01,800
Tomorrow morning, I will go wipe out Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

408
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:06,000
Look at you. You're doing it again, you little brat.

409
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:08,600
That Mo Huaiyang is a highly-skilled martial artist.

410
00:30:08,600 --> 00:30:10,500
After meditating in seclusion for ten years,

411
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:14,200
we have no idea what level of power he has reached. If we are not sure,

412
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,800
wouldn't we be alerting the enemy?

413
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:18,200
It's not like I'm fighting him one-on-one.

414
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:22,300
No matter how great his martial arts are, he can dodge the spear in plain sight,

415
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:24,300
but how can he dodge a sneaky arrow?

416
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,940
If that doesn't work,

417
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:30,200
I could bring some Drug Men

418
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:35,000
and make Gentle Wind Sword Sect a deadland.

419
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,400
Scorpion, I remember telling you

420
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:45,200
to destroy all the Drug Men. Did you treat my words

421
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,870
like they were nothing?

422
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,600
The Venomous Scorpions assassinate others for survival. That's already a huge taboo in the martial arts world!

423
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,300
You even use demon tricks to control people's minds

424
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:01,000
and altered real humans into Drug Men as weapons!

425
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:03,800
The heavens will not tolerate this. You will be despised by humans and Gods alike for your deeds!

426
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:06,600
But my demon tricks have helped you defeat Gao Chong!

427
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:10,100
Father, trust me. I will prove myself!

428
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:11,800
Why do you still not understand?

429
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,400
If outsiders knew that

430
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:16,200
I, Zhao Jing, was related to these demon tricks at all,

431
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:19,400
my reputation will be destroyed. I will be targeted by the entire martial arts world!

432
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,900
Then there is no hope for me as the Supreme Leader of the Martial Arts World!

433
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:27,000
Everything I've worked so hard for these years will be completely ruined!

478
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,790
They are unparalleled soulmates in mountains and rivers.

479
00:34:35,790 --> 00:34:38,010
People incorrectly smear them.

480
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,270
All right, all right! I was wrong.

481
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:45,810
Brother Cao, you didn't tell my master's and Zhou Xu's names to anyone else, did you?

482
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:49,420
Of course not. I've already promised you.

483
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:52,520
Also, my junior master and the others are not shallow people.

484
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:55,270
They wouldn't believe those gossips in the martial arts world so easily.

485
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,370
They also wouldn't hold biases against you.

486
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:32,430
Chengling, come, drink some tea.

487
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,480
Thank you, Uncle Wen.

488
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:43,030
Master, it's so spicy!

489
00:35:45,310 --> 00:35:48,310
Old Wen, you are so mean.

490
00:35:48,310 --> 00:35:51,290
Didn't you trick me into eating spicy food like this a few days ago?

491
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,830
Since it's a custom for you Kunzhou people to play pranks on others,

492
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:57,500
why would it be wrong for me to reciprocate to your disciple?

493
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,000
Have another?

494
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,280
Greetings, Lord Zhou.

495
00:36:03,830 --> 00:36:06,710
Ping An, is Great Shaman here?

496
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:11,230
Apologies, Lord Zhou. Great Shaman has been delayed for a few days.

497
00:36:11,230 --> 00:36:14,370
He is custom-making a miraculous medicine for you.

498
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,660
But does Great Shaman have a solution to cure his injury?

499
00:36:16,660 --> 00:36:19,710
I wouldn't dare to guess, Master Wen.

500
00:36:19,710 --> 00:36:22,120
But it's probably very helpful.

501
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:24,640
My master said, as long as the journey is smooth on the way,

502
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:28,200
they should be able to make it here for the new year celebration.

503
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:32,070
December in the cold winter.

504
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,550
I'm grateful that Lord Seventh is taking the arduous journey for me.

505
00:36:36,550 --> 00:36:40,090
Sir Ye sent another letter.

506
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:42,220
Please look it over.

507
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,350
[To Zishu at the Four Seasons Mountain Villa]

508
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:56,290
[Eliminate all ghosts, cleanse mountains and rivers]

509
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:04,180
Master, this mark is the Token of Honor.

510
00:37:04,180 --> 00:37:07,350
Uncle Gao and Elder Ye originally each had a piece when they came.

511
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:11,040
Elder Ye is going to lead the Heroes Conference in destroying Ghost Valley!

512
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:14,360
This is great, Master. Can we go?

513
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:39,470
A'Xu, why aren't you resting yet when it's so late already?

514
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,810
Aren't you not sleeping well?

515
00:37:41,810 --> 00:37:44,030
These Drunk Life Dream Death have been sundried.

516
00:37:44,030 --> 00:37:47,300
Once they are ground into powder, they can be made into medicine.

517
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,750
Those Drunk Life Dream Death in the villa

518
00:37:49,750 --> 00:37:52,280
are too old,

519
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,060
and the medicinal effect is already lost.

520
00:37:55,780 --> 00:37:57,620
I'll help you.

521
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,670
You are sick.

522
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:36,690
Aren't you grinding the medicine?

523
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:39,490
This medicine cannot cure lunacy.

524
00:38:39,490 --> 00:38:42,100
- All right, all right, I'll clean it up for you.
- So childish.

525
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:46,300
Don't think that I don't know what's in your mind.

526
00:38:46,300 --> 00:38:50,140
If you dare hide things from me again and make arbitrary decisions,

527
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:53,540
Senior Brother will slap you and whip you.

528
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:56,710
How... How could I dare?

529
00:38:56,710 --> 00:38:58,960
Didn't I predict it already?

530
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:01,010
Sooner or later, there will be a battle between good and evil.

531
00:39:01,010 --> 00:39:03,380
That's why I sent A'Xiang and the others away long ago.

532
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,890
Other than that,

533
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:08,090
how is it any of my business

534
00:39:08,090 --> 00:39:10,840
whether the martial arts world's righteous ones will eliminate Ghost Valley?

535
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:15,360
Let those evil demons die earlier,

536
00:39:15,360 --> 00:39:17,580
it'll only be good to the world.

537
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:19,920
Why are you still worrying then?

538
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:27,070
A'Xu, how long will I continue to deceive Chengling?

539
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:31,270
You've already deceived him, and I'm responsible too.

540
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:35,020
What else can we do? We can only continue to deceive him for now.

541
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:39,160
Once I'm recovered from my injury, we'll find the culprit who annihilated Mirror Lake Sect.

542
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:42,060
Then, we can confess to Chengling together.

543
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:46,200
Either way, we are the grasshoppers on the same rope.

544
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,410
Neither one can get rid of the other.

545
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:55,370
It's just, how did my mighty Valley Chief Wen,

546
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:57,550
who is such a vicious and ruthless person,

547
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,750
become so sentimental?

548
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:02,770
He even feels guilty for deceiving a child.

549
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:07,550
You've lied to me all this time. What do you say about that?

550
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,920
A'Xu, you've been grinding so well.

551
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:15,380
As soon as I smelled it, I felt sleepy. I'm going to sleep first.

552
00:40:15,380 --> 00:40:18,770
- You should rest early.
- Smell more of it then.
- Rest early!

553
00:40:46,930 --> 00:40:50,710
Once the leader of the ghosts find the true way to return to the human world,

554
00:40:50,710 --> 00:40:52,970
he'd change back into a human again.

555
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:55,700
An ordinary and sentimental person

556
00:40:55,700 --> 00:40:59,750
would yearn for the days of no secrets and no haze,

557
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:04,000
and wish for someone to always stay with him.

558
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:47,430
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

559
00:41:48,850 --> 00:41:55,890
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

560
00:41:55,890 --> 00:42:03,070
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

561
00:42:03,070 --> 00:42:11,630
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

562
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:18,540
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

563
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:25,890
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

564
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:29,980
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

565
00:42:29,980 --> 00:42:33,530
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

566
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:41,490
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

567
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,900
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

568
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:48,570
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

569
00:42:48,570 --> 00:42:56,620
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

570
00:42:56,620 --> 00:43:00,110
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

571
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:03,850
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

572
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:10,860
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

573
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:19,870
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
