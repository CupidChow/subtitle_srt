The coffin really can't keep him locked there!

I wasn't pretending.

I can still walk on my own even if I'm poisoned.

Why pretend to be a hero in front of me?

Take one of these, just in case.

59
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,779
A'Xu, did you come from the Miracle Healer Valley?

60
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,380
Why do you have so many antidotes on you?

61

Do I look like someone who practices medicine to help the public?

62
00:05:51,040 --> 00:05:55,019
No. You look like a professional killer.

You were cruel in the abandoned temple.

You frightened me, the Philanthropist Wen who can't even kill a chicken.

66
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,500
Philanthropist?

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,940
Although I don't look like one, I really am a good man.

68
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,860
Fine, fine, fine.

69
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:17,300
You're a philanthropist and I'm a killer.

70

You say that those disgusting things are called Drug Men?

73
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:35,400
I've only read about them in a book.

74
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,620
Rumor has it that a gold needle can be used

75
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,479
to control a person's five senses.

76
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:43,020
Then, a poison would be used to strengthen his skin and bones.

77
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:48,280
Thus, the living person would become an extraordinarily powerful monster

78
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,300
to be controlled by another.

79

you don't have eyes on your back. Right?

What are you doing?

108
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,560
A'Xu, your ability to disguise yourself is somewhat lacking.

109
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,100
You've covered your head, face, and neck,

110
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:55,840
but you didn't cover your body.

111
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,960
Are you still refusing to admit it?

112
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,780
I tanned myself, okay?

113
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:11,200
A'Xu, who exactly are you hiding from?

114
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,400
The person I want to hide from most is you.

115
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:15,360
Me?

116
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,540
I'm not someone you can hide from.

117
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,519
However, if you're disguising yourself in order to hide from someone else,

118
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,079
you can save your effort.

119
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,220
As long as I'm by your side, even if your enemy

120
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:29,860
is an immortal or a monster,

121
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,480
- I can still—
- What?

122
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,560
Do you even have the capability to kill any deity you come across?

123
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,520
I'm sorry. I care about all of the lives in the world.

124
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,519
How could I possibly kill evils recklessly?

125
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:46,080
What I meant to say is that no matter who your enemy is, I can beat him with reason.

126
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:52,280
Just by quoting classical scriptures, I can end his violence

127
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:54,760
and convince him to drop his knife.

128
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,199
A'Xu, now... we can be considered as friends who have gone through life and death together.

129
00:10:01,199 --> 00:10:04,360
Can you show me your real appearance?

130
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,219
Complete trust must be mutual.

131
00:10:09,219 --> 00:10:11,239
This is truly what I look like.

132
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,559
It's authentic and isn't deceptive at all.

133
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:15,900
If you don't believe me, you can touch it and see for yourself.

134
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:20,020
Pretty much everyone who has ever seen my real appearance died.

135
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,439
What a coincidence.

136
00:10:21,439 --> 00:10:26,660
I fear many things, but the only thing I do not fear is death.

137
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:32,679
Your internal injuries are quite serious. Let me have a look.

138
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:35,460
Don't think that you can continue to suppress them with your profound internal strength.

139
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,800
It may seriously undermine your health in the future.

140
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,139
I know the extent of my illness.

141
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:42,080
No need for you to care.

142
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,300
If you die and I'm left alone in the vast snowcapped mountains, who would my lonely shadow wander after?

143
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:51,399
Wander after whomever you'd like.

144
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:55,540

A'Xu!

A'Xu!

184
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,860
What are you looking at?

185
00:15:12,040 --> 00:15:14,099
Enough, enough, A'Xu. Stop messing around.

186
00:15:14,099 --> 00:15:16,100
I won't tease you anymore.

187
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,680
Do you have wine?

188
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:49,599
A'Xiang is not here, and we've got nothing to heat the wine up with.

189
00:15:49,599 --> 00:15:52,000
I heated it up with my internal strength.

190
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,079
Put up with it. It's better than drinking it cold.

191
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,100
Old Wen,

192
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,020
is your surname really Wen?

193
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:20,240
I really didn't lie to you.

194
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:23,740
I'm a gentleman as warm and gentle as jade.

195
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,640
Don't you think that this surname suits me well?
(T/N: "Wen" means warm)

196
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:35,060
This must be the Soul Winding Box.

197
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:39,819
Back then, Hanging Ghost used this strange and unpredictable Soul Winding Box

198
00:16:39,819 --> 00:16:41,479
to run rampant across the lands.

199
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:44,279
I didn't expect that that fellow would officially become a ghost.

200
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,560
We got this precious treasure easily.

201
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:50,760
He wasn't Hanging Ghost.

202
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,499
A'Xu, you are very familiar with Ghost Valley.

203
00:16:56,499 --> 00:16:58,920
Not really.

204
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,079
However, that man was too young.

205
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:04,660
When Hanging Ghost became famous, this man was still a baby.

206
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:07,770
Where is the real Hanging Ghost?

207
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,660
Let's not discuss whether or not it's the real one yet.

208
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:14,050
This treasure, however, is authentic.

209
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,440
If Hanging Ghost really hasn't died yet,

210
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:20,140
how could his treasure fall into the hands of another?

211
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:25,109
Be careful.

212
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,300
This thing needs to be opened in a specific way.

213
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:31,360
Otherwise, it might destroy itself and hurt you.

214
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,040
Since you were still lucid at that moment,

215
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:39,000
why did you kill the fake Hanging Ghost?

216
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,240
We need him to answer many of our questions.

217
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:45,200
I made mistakes because I was worried about you.

218
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,240
Don't you understand?

219
00:17:49,720 --> 00:17:51,500
I'm hungry.

220
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:56,000
Old Wen, get some food for me.

221
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,620
Why aren't you getting it by yourself?

222
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:10,220
All right, all right! I'll go, I'll go!

223
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:12,300
Get some rest here.

224
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,880
Zhou Zishu.

225
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,700
He's indeed...

226
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:42,900
Zhou Zishu.

227
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,439
[Scorpion King - Leader of Scorpion]

228
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,580
It's really wonderful.

229
00:19:56,140 --> 00:20:02,280
I thought Qin Song's Enchanted Sound was incomparable to the rest,

230
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:04,140
but I didn't expect

231
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:08,220
the real expert to be here.

232
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,630
How lucky was Long-tongued Ghost?

233
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:16,359
He got to learn how to use the Enchanted Sound

234
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:20,540
to control the Drug Men from you.

235
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:25,640
I really envy him.

236
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:30,180
Perfect.

237
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,540
He's already dead.

238
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:34,400
He's dead?

239
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,140
He's really dead?

240
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,620
Wait! Who did it?

241
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,040
Where's the Soul Winding Box?

242
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,379
You're asking me?

243
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:51,220
I wanted to ask you.

244
00:20:51,220 --> 00:20:52,519
Where's the Glazed Armor?

245
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,839
No. The Glazed Armor... I already have it.

246
00:20:56,840 --> 00:21:01,619
But didn't I have to go to Sanbai Mountain Villa to deal with Ao Laizi's body?

247
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:03,399
I wanted to make no mistake.

248
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,579
Therefore, I asked Long-tongued Ghost to bring the Glazed Armor here.

249
00:21:07,579 --> 00:21:09,999
There are so many Drug Men here at your place.

250
00:21:09,999 --> 00:21:12,699
This place is also filled with the mesmerizing scent and Soul Winding Spell.

251
00:21:12,699 --> 00:21:15,580
There should be no problem.

252
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,739
Scorpion King, shouldn't you have come and gotten the Glazed Armor earlier?

253
00:21:20,739 --> 00:21:23,199
- Shouldn't you—
- Changing Ghost.

254
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:27,100
Are you blaming me for my late arrival?

255
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,159
I don't dare.

256
00:21:32,160 --> 00:21:33,900
Forget it.

257
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:36,660
I also didn't expect

258
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:41,760
someone could make it through these numerous obstacles and break in.

259
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,640
Things are...

260
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:48,260
getting more and more interesting.

261
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,400
The Glazed Armor?

262
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:28,280
Why would it be hidden inside the Soul Winding Box?

263
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,220
Who knows?

264
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,600
You may take it.

265
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,140
This thing is related to the secret of opening the World's Armory.

266
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:50,180
A countless amount of people have been fighting so hard to have possession of this.

267
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,980
You just exchanged it with me

268
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,920
for two rabbits?

269
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,220
At least I can fill my stomach with the rabbits.

270
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,240
They are much better than this thing.

271
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,820
A'Xu,

272
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,660
are you really not the slightest bit interested in it?

273
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,999
Nonsense.

274
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,759
"The Iridescent Clouds are scattered and the Glaze is shattered."

275
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,640
You can tell it's unlucky just by hearing it.

276
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:21,060
Why would I keep such an unlucky thing?

277
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:26,220
A'Xu,

278
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:29,279
I thought you were just stubborn with your words but had a soft heart.

279
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:32,900
I didn't expect that when you started speaking with a sharp tongue, things could get ugly.

280
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,879
There are many things that you don't know about me.

281
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:38,399
I not only have a sharp tongue, but I'm also ruthless.

282
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,120
You'd better be careful.

283
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,160
You're ruthless indeed.

284
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:46,439
You know that this thing is inauspicious, but you still handed it to me.

285
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,340
Don't you fear that I'll get dragged into a disaster?

286
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:53,400
You're already a disaster as is.

287
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,420
Why would you be afraid of this?

288
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:58,580
If you don't want it, just throw it away.

289
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:04,279
No way.

290
00:24:04,280 --> 00:24:07,700
This is the first gift our A'Xu ever gave me.

291
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,279
I couldn't bear to throw it away.

292
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,959
I will get a string and hang it on my body.

293
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:15,240
I will admire it every day.

294
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,240
However, A'Xu,

295
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:19,760
do you think this piece of Glazed Armor was the one in Zhao Jing's possession

296
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:22,640
or Zhang Chengling's family's?

297
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:25,679
If the Ghost Valley had already obtained Chengling's Glazed Armor,

298
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:28,880
what would be the point in finding hundreds of ways to abduct Chengling?

299
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,919
This morning, I suspected that Ao Laizi and Shen Shen were acting strange with each other.

300
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:39,620
Tonight, his body appeared at the entrance of the Sanbai Mountain Villa.

301
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:44,200
A'Xu, do you think there is something strange about this situation?

302
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,620
The Ghost Valley instigated this.

303
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:50,920
Before Lu Taichong died, he handed everything over to Ao Laizi

304
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:52,839
instead of his brothers.

305
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,180
This already embarrassed the Five Lakes Alliance.

306
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:01,740
Ghost Valley purposely wiped the blood of Mount Tai Sect all over the face of the Five Lakes Alliance

307
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,420
with the intention of attracting busybodies into starting rumors.

308
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:05,959
Let's stop talking about this.

309
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:08,120
If you're bored,

310
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,020
wash and clean out these rabbits together with me.

311
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,940
I was the one who hunted these rabbits.

312
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,879
Why do you want me to clean them?

313
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,359
Do what you want.

314
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:22,940
Those who don't help with the cleaning don't get any to eat.

315
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:29,200
A'Xu, I'll clean them. Okay?

316
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,060
Chengling, how did you sleep last night?

317
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:47,159
Do you not have a good appetite?

318
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:49,639
You've suffered all the way here.

319
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:52,060
Chengling, your uncle has been worried about you.

320
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,319
That's why we can't rest.

321
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,279
We must move on with our journey immediately.

322
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:58,159
However, you have your uncles with you this time.

323
00:25:58,160 --> 00:25:59,839
We will take care of you.

324
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:01,239
Thank you for your care, Uncle.

325
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,639
Why are your eyes swollen?

326
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,240
Did you cry?

327
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,260
No.

328
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,719
Chengling, the two great warriors from yesterday

329
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,439
left without a word this morning.

330
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:20,399
I'm not sure whether it's because we didn't serve them well enough.

331
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,839
I also didn't get to speak in detail with them.

332
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,720
Are they friends of your father?

333
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,880
I don't know.

334
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,919
Why did you follow them without knowing their identities?

335
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,560
Yesterday, you were exhausted from your journey, and I felt like there were too many people.

336
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:34,239
It's perfect that they've left today.

337
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,519
Quick, tell us!

338
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:39,360
What happened in Mirror Lake Mountain Villa the night of the accident?

339
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,020
I... I don't remember.

340
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,660
That's absurd.

341
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:49,159
We are your father's sworn brothers.

342
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:51,780
What could you possibly not dare to tell us?

343
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:56,960
I was overly frightened that day.

344
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,639
A-Afterwards, I had a fever for a few days.

345
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,220
When I woke up, I was beside Uncle Zhou and Uncle Wen.

346
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:07,900
As for what happened afterward... I no longer remember.

347
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,160
Fifth Brother, enough.

348
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,599
Then, how did your parents die?

349
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:16,559
Do you not remember any of the 300 lives in Mirror Lake Mountain Villa?

350
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,640
Fifth Brother!

351
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,680
You can't remember anything.

352
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:25,940
Then, do you mean that we can forget our duty to take revenge?

353
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,320
Don't talk to a child like this.

354
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:36,239
Chengling, it's all right.

355
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,620
Fifth Uncle is just anxious.

356
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:41,040
This is revenge we must take.

357
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:44,900
Fifth Uncle and I are your father's sworn brothers.

358
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,220
Although there were some misunderstandings in the past,

359
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:49,600
nothing can break our relationship.

360
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,960
Your father's problems are our problems.

361
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,700
From now on, you're my biological son.

362
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:00,220
Second Brother, the current situation is urgent.

363
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,719
Three out of the five parts of the Glazed Armor are gone.

364
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,260
Yours and Third Brother Lu's Glazed Armor

365
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,599
must have been taken by Ghost Valley.

366
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,719
How can we relax without clearing things up?

367
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:10,100
This child is obviously...

368
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:12,359
He's a child. What does he know?

369
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:15,480
Once we arrive at Yueyang, we shall let Eldest Brother decide everything.

370
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,940
Chengling, your Uncle Zhao is here.

371
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,960
Don't be afraid.

372
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:27,319
We've arrived late.

373
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,239
- Brother Zhao.
- Brother Zhao.
- Great Warrior Shen.

374
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,639
I'm sorry.

Great Warrior Shen.

376
00:28:32,040 --> 00:28:36,340
Brother Zhao, I heard you are going to depart to Yueyang today.

377
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,319
Yes.

378
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:39,199
There is still some time before the Heroes Conference.

379
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,399
However, I would like to go back earlier to see if I can help with anything.

380
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:44,679
Eldest Brother has also been missing Chengling all this time.

381
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,599
Do you have any plans hereafter?

382
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,119
If you don't, why don't you go with us?

383
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,740
We can take care of each other on our way.

Brother Yu, where is Tianjie?

386
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,719
My beloved disciple He Ruicai, has been missing for a few days.

387
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:05,020
So, Tianjie went to search for his whereabouts.

388
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:07,560
However, a lot of things have happened lately.

389
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:10,119
You should restrain your disciples.

390
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:11,799
Do your best to limit the number of times they go out.

391
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:13,079
Second Brother,

392
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:16,620
stop boosting the morale of others by undermining our own courage.

393
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
Those evil ghosts

394
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:23,719
only hide in the dark and harm people with their dirty tricks.

395
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:26,519
I will suppress whoever dares to come out and cause trouble!

396
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,119
Fifth Brother, never let your guard down.

397
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,260
Think about it. The world has been in peace for a long time.

398
00:29:31,260 --> 00:29:34,240
When have people ever been as anxious as they are now?

399
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:37,559
That's why I still hope that Eldest Brother can lead all of the world's heroes

400
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:40,439
to suppress the Ghost Valley in one fell swoop and restore world peace.

This is strange.

404
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:58,480
Was what happened last night just a dream?

405
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,860
It has only been a few hours,

406
00:30:00,860 --> 00:30:03,880
yet the enemies have already completely erased all of the traces of last night.

407

[Thousands of generations of ancestors rest here]

A'Xu, what was the strangely mesmerizing scent from last night?

If you don't want to tell me, then don't.

It's not as if I'd force you to.

Stop running away!

413
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,599
A'Xu, walk slower. Wait for me.

This is the place, am I right?

00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:37,320
Yes, the cured meat was hung here last night.

At least tell me the name of that scent.

417
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,700
The scent is called Drunk Life Dream Death.

418
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,040
Then, why did you have the antidote?

419
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:02,300
Why did Drunk Life Dream Death appear in Huzhou?

420
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:06,080
Is the Window of Heaven getting involved with Ghost Valley?

421

A'Xu, why are you ignoring me?

422
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,719
Since you know its antidote, you should know its origin, too.

423
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:18,639
Can you get me two boxes of it?

424
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,580
No.

You can have whatever you want.

When in the illusion caused by the mesmerizing scent,

people will see what they desire most.

00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:46,780
What did you see?

433
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:56,580
A'Xu, I thought you were a decent man.

434
00:31:56,580 --> 00:32:00,420
It's too obtrusive for you to ask me about

435
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,380
such a private matter.

436
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:04,279
This man is mysterious.

437

Not only that, he has deep knowledge about the Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

438

What relationship does he have with my sect?

439
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,639
Fine, fine, fine. I'll tell you.

440
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:19,940
In the illusion, I saw...

441
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:27,199
When I was young, I threw a dead rat into my mother's bed.

442
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,940
As a result, she found it out and chased me across three streets.

443
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:36,840
A'Xu, I won't joke with you anymore.

444
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:47,200
I messed around with you because I didn't want to lie to you.

445
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:55,439
The main ingredient of Drunk Life Dream Death is a mysterious herb called Nepenthes.

446
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,639
As soon as a person takes in a little of it,

447
00:32:57,640 --> 00:33:02,500
it will cause them to fall in a coma for six to seven days and generate good dreams.

The fuel used in the coffin home...

449
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:08,159
was similar to this.

450
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:11,480
However, it's much stronger than the one I developed.

451
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:14,560
That is why it will cause people to see illusions.

You made this scent?

453
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,840
Drunk Life Dream Death came from an ancient recipe.

454
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,999
I only turned it into an incense

455
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:26,140
and lessened its effect to improve one's sleep.

456
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,159
Since ancient times, Nepenthes has never been found in the Central Plain.

00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,360
to discuss the master plan to defeat Ghost Valley.

478
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,199
Did the orphan of the Zhang family follow them, too?

479
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,729
- Master, Young Master Zhang...
- Turns out Han Ying has also arrived in Jiangnan.

480
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:34,359
Seems like the Window of Heaven

481
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:37,041
is really involved in the matter about the Glazed Armor.

482
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,080
Heroes Conference?

483
00:34:41,720 --> 00:34:45,540
It sounds interesting.

484
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:54,020
A'Xu, why are you hiding?

485
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:58,440
Why? Are you afraid to see the guard?

486
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:02,199
Or... are you a fugitive?

487
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,359
Yes, I murdered people and set things on fire. There's no crime I've never committed.

488
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,720
Philanthropist Wen, stay away from me.

489
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:10,340
Then, do you pluck flowers?

490
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,960
All right, all right. I'll quit joking.

491
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:15,039
How is it?

492
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:18,280
The Heroes Conference. It'll be very lively. Are you going or not?

493
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:22,440
Are you following me there to kill people or set the fire?

494
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:24,759
Of course, we are going there to enjoy the drama.

495
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:27,519
What in the world is more interesting than drama?

496
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:31,599
Moreover, it's a drama about a dogfight.

497
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:33,759
That means that no matter how far away it is, we must go take a look.

498
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:37,199
The Heroes Conference will be comprised of a group of barking dogs.

499
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:41,080
The Five Lakes Alliance is eager to take control of Zhang Chengling.

500
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:44,919
A lonely orphan in a sea of people with no one to rely on.

501
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:47,919
He's surrounded by hunting hounds who are smarter than foxes.

502
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,960
What a pity. A pity.

503
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:54,820
Even if you say nothing, no one will take you for a mute.

504
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,759
Then I'll go find my A'Xiang to settle some things.

505
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,540
I'll be there right away, A'Xu.

506
00:36:20,240 --> 00:36:22,919
Brother Zhao, you really know how to enjoy.

507
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:27,920
I've enjoyed myself on the way with you, Brother Zhao.

508
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:31,799
My second brother is the son-in-law of West Zhejiang's Observer.

509
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:33,879
He's a rich and delicate nobleman.

510
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:36,159
He's worried that we would laugh at him

511
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,799
if he traveled with rogue men like us.

512
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:40,300
He's so quiet now.

513
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:41,999
Teasing me is the only thing you know how to do.

514
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,239
I'm doing this for Chengling.

515
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,039
He keeps moving and stopping..

516
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,860
When will he be able to bring Chengling to Yueyang?

517
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,359
Master.

518
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,199
Come. What are you looking for?

519
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,279
A hairpin or a ring? Pearl, jade, gold, or silver?

520
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,159
We've got everything you need at this store!

521
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,460
Can you make glass?

522
00:37:04,460 --> 00:37:06,140
You've come to the right place.

523
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:12,440
In this region, no other shop is better than us at making glass.

524
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:15,119
I would like to order 30 copies of glass that look exactly the same.

525
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,459
I'm in a hurry to meet someone. Can I get them tomorrow?

526
00:37:18,459 --> 00:37:22,460
Master, you sound like an outsider.

527
00:37:22,460 --> 00:37:27,920
Customized glazed ware takes at least ten days to half a month to make.

528
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:30,599
Your treasure was made by some expert.

529
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
It's crystal clear.

530
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:37,340
I think my furnace can only...

531
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:40,639
All right. Master, three days!

532
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,360
Give me three days.

533
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:44,460
I'll definitely get them ready by then.

534
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,840
Three days later, I'll either be here to get my goods or burn your shop.

535
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:52,400
All right. Don't worry.

536
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,440
I'll get them ready in time.

537
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,360
I won again.

538
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,799
I lost again.

539
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:07,079
I give up, I give up.

540
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,360
If I continue playing, I'd lose my dress.

541
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:11,759
Sister Xiang, you give up once you lose.

542
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,679
You're not good at gambling.

543
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,560
Hong Lu, am I right?

544
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,739
You're right, Older Sister.

545
00:38:16,739 --> 00:38:19,700
Sister Xiang, you can't be like this.

546
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:24,940
Let me tell you.

547
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,540
It's just that I don't know how to play this game.

548
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:30,479
If we played Push Card Nine, I'd definitely win back all of your dresses and underwear!

549
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,119
It's just that we still need one more player.

550
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:37,460
Sister Xiang, when will Master return?

551
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:40,159
Are you already missing Master?

552
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:41,799
Don't laugh at me.

553
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,959
I just think you've saved our lives, so we should try our best

554
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,920
to serve you and Master to repay your grace.

555
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:51,679
However, we've just been playing all day for the past few days.

556
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,239
I just feel uneasy, that's all.

557
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,359
Stop it.

558
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:56,039
The reason you're making that speech is just that you miss Master.

559
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,959
I'm telling you, that's useless!

560
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,580
Why is it useless?

561
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:02,220
Master?

562
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,540
- Master.
- Master.

563
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,120
Master, we need one more player. It's you.

564
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,840
Ungrateful.

565
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:16,600
Girl, why did you miss me?

566
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:24,420
You see? They are loyal servants.

567
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,079
Unlike you.

568
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,439
You've been like a reignless horse ever since you left the valley.

569
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,399
You only think about playing.

570
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:34,140
It's uneasy to have you as my servants.

571
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:39,280
A'Xiang, give them a hundred taels of silver later.

572
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,599
You may return to your home.

573
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:45,160
If you use them wisely, it should be enough for you to live at ease for the rest of your lives.

574
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,579
Master, please do not dislike us.

575
00:39:50,579 --> 00:39:54,519
We survived our hardship because of Sister Xiang's and your help.

576
00:39:54,520 --> 00:39:58,079
We are willing to follow you both for the rest of our lives.

577
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,520
We will continue to repay you in our next lives.

578
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,780
Follow us for the rest of your lives?

579
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,760
Easy for you to say.

580
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,640
Gu Xiang, what did I tell you previously?

581
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:19,319
Master, I've prepared this especially for you.

582
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,239
Wolong's famous nuts.
[Wolong]

583
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,639
They are big, crispy, and delicious.

584
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:25,839
There was a huge line to get these. Have a taste.

585
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:28,540
Did someone pay you? You're praising them so obviously.

586
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:29,759
How could that be?

587
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:33,360
I just wanted to bestow all of my best things onto my master.

588
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,620
How is it? Not bad, right?

589
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:48,340
You have good sense.

590
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:51,700
In the future, we will only buy our nuts from this store.

591
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,460
Master, I didn't buy them.

592
00:40:54,460 --> 00:40:56,639
Yun Zai and Hong Lu bought them.

593
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,159
They specifically stood in line to get these.

594
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,879
My good master,

595
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,700
they are both orphans.

596
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,599
They don't have anyone to rely on.

597
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:05,919
The world is in such a mess.

598
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:08,780
I'm afraid that even with money, they might not be able to protect themselves.

599
00:41:08,780 --> 00:41:10,879
Master, please let me keep them.

600
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:12,599
Please take pity on us, Master.

601
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,159
It's hard to survive outside.

602
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:19,479
Throughout our lives, we were sold around like kittens or puppies.

603
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:21,820
Only Sister Xiang treats us as humans.

604
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:24,439
Master, please let us stay and serve you.

605
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,519
Yes, Master.

606
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:27,960
We are willing to do it.

607
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,500
All right.

608
00:41:30,500 --> 00:41:31,519
Thank you, Master.

609
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,520
Since you're willing to do it,

610
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:36,940
these two girls are your servants from now on.

611
00:41:36,940 --> 00:41:40,519
You were the one who made this decision, so you are the one who must face the outcome in the future.

612
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:41,839
I won't interfere.

613
00:41:41,840 --> 00:41:43,359
Yes. Thank you, Master.

614
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:47,020
Since I'm taking them in, I'll definitely be able to protect them.

615
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:49,200
We'll see if you have the capability.

616
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:51,559
You two may leave first.

617
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:53,240
Yes.

618
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,899
Come here. I need you to do two things.

619
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,160
You must complete the first task as soon as possible.

620
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,880
We need to plan carefully for the second task.

621
00:42:57,150 --> 00:43:02,380
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

622
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:10,330
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

623
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:17,660
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

624
00:43:18,940 --> 00:43:25,740
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

625
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:33,300
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

626
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:41,980
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

627
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,919
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

628
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:49,459
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

629
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:57,450
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

630
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,869
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

631
00:44:00,870 --> 00:44:04,570
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

632
00:44:04,570 --> 00:44:12,680
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

633
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:16,030
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

634
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:19,819
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

635
00:44:19,820 --> 00:44:26,790
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

636
00:44:26,790 --> 00:44:34,660
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
