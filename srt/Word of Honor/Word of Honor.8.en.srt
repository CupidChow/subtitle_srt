[Episode 8]

23
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,230
Uncle Gao.

24
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:06,570
Uncle Zhao. Master Shen.

25
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:09,040
Chengling, are you getting used to things?

26
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:13,200
You shall stay at Yueyang Sect from now on.

27
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,550
Chengling, do you have any physical issues?

28
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,389
No, Uncle Gao.

29
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:33,749
Then, why is your body so weak?

30
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,189
Eldest Brother, the child is still young.

31
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:38,269
It's not too late to train him now.

32
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:40,110
He's not young anymore.

33
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:43,630
Everyone in the martial arts world says

34
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:45,790
that Mirror Lake Sect has been exterminated.

35
00:02:45,790 --> 00:02:49,370
However, as long as Chengling still lives, their words are incorrect.

36
00:02:49,930 --> 00:02:54,470
Chengling, if you can't inherit your father's legacy,

37
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,590
the Zhang family will truly have no successor.

38
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:06,290
Give me the Glazed Armor.

39
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:09,850
Come on.

40
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:16,670
Eldest Brother, Chengling has been traumatized and has temporarily lost his memory.

41
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:20,930
We shall discuss the Glazed Armor later.

42
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:25,870
Later?

43
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:29,170
The Glazed Armor is more important than Yusen's life.

44
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,690
It's more important than our lives.

45
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:36,690
Yusen barely managed to let Chengling escape

46
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:39,830
in order to bring us the news of the Glazed Armor!

47
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:45,450
Chengling, do you want your father and your family to have died for nothing?

48
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:49,490
How many times do you want me to repeat it?

49
00:03:49,490 --> 00:03:51,790
I don't know anything about the Glazed Armor!

50
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,510
Stop messing around!

51
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,790
Hurry up and tell us where the Glazed Armor is.

52
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:02,690
Chengling, don't be afraid.

53
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,410
Hurry and tell us!

54
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:10,130
Chengling, I know.

55
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:15,310
Your father hadn't interacted with his brothers from the Five Lakes Alliance in many years,

56
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:17,540
so you don't trust us.

57
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:20,510
However, if you don't trust us now, who else is there for you to put your trust in?

58
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:23,850
You have no other choice, kid!

59
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,710
Eldest Brother, the child doesn't understand.

60
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:37,190
We can teach him slowly.

61
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:43,770
I don't have enough patience to coax you!

62
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:46,550
The more days it takes you to hand in the Glazed Armor, the more people in the martial arts world

63
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:50,580
will suffer because of it! Do you know or not?

64
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:53,610
I don't know!

65
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:56,370
- I—
- Eldest Brother! Eldest Brother! Eldest Brother.

66
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:58,350
Chengling!

67
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:00,530
Eldest Brother, don't be angry.

68
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:04,750
Why don't we talk about the Glazed Armor another time?

69
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,310
You may leave.

70
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,950
Hurry and go!

71
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,630
Go.

72
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:23,010
Eldest Brother, I know. There have been misunderstandings between you and Yusen

73
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,610
for many years.

74
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:27,910
However, the child doesn't understand that. He doesn't know what's good for him.

75
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:29,690
Shut up!

76
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:41,210
Second Brother, you are being unwise.

77
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:43,890
Fourth Brother's case broke Eldest Brother's heart completely.

78
00:05:43,890 --> 00:05:46,290
How were you so bold as to mention him anyway?

79
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,890
Help me resolve things with him.

80
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:55,730
I was just pitying that child.

81
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,170
He has to make a living here later.

82
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,570
You're wrong again.

83
00:06:00,570 --> 00:06:05,410
Even if Eldest Brother truly was angry, would he really take it out on a child?

84
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:09,230
You've underestimated Eldest Brother's heart.

85
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:17,209
Brother, I was in an awkward situation today.

86
00:06:17,209 --> 00:06:20,850
I was a stranger to you, but you still gave up your own money to help me.

87
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,130
I feel apologetic.

88
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:24,710
I live at the Yueyang Sect and it's not far away.

89
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:26,390
Brother, can you wait here?

90
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,269
I'll be back soon.

91
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,429
Our chance meeting was fate.

92
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:32,150
Money is only a posession.

93
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:37,610
If I'm able to meet a new friend with it, isn't it better?

94
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:41,269
I'm Zhou Xu. May I know your name?

95
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,730
M-My surname is Cao. I'm Cao Weining.

96
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:46,229
I'm a disciple of the Gentle Wind Sword Sect.

97
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:49,749
I heard that the Gentle Wind Sword Sect is the strictest in choosing their disciples.

98
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:52,510
All of its disciples are elegant,

99
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,890
handsome, well-educated, and well-trained in martial arts.

100
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,790
After seeing you, I think the rumors are indeed true.

101
00:06:57,790 --> 00:06:59,050
You overestimate me.

102
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,010
I'm the most useless one in my sect.

103
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:03,549
Don't say that.

104
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,690
Our first meeting was brought by fate.

105
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:09,210
If you don't mind, have a seat. We can drink and chat.

106
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:15,490
- Come on.
- All right, all right!

107
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:20,810
Brother Zhou, you're straightforward. You're like a breath of fresh air!

108
00:07:22,670 --> 00:07:24,210
Brother Zhou, let's drink.

109
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:25,950
Here.

110
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,050
Here, a toast to you.

111
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,050
Kick him out for me.

112
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,709
- He can help me get into Yueyang Sect.
- Eat as you like. Drink as you want.

113
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:41,670
A'Xiang, help me find that Fang Buzhi!

114
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:43,090
Fang Buzhi?

115
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,870
Fang Buzhi's martial arts are quite strong.

116
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,890
A'Xiang is just a girl...

117
00:07:46,890 --> 00:07:49,270
Are you looking down on girls?

118
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,530
Girls are... Girls are great! Girls are great.

119
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:54,210
How about...

120
00:07:54,210 --> 00:07:55,750
How about I go with you?

121
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:58,170
It's crowded out there.

122
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,590
Brother Zhou, excuse me.

123
00:08:00,590 --> 00:08:02,310
May I know where you will be staying?

124
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:04,789
I'll visit you and treat you to a meal in return.

125
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:08,030
Making friends is mostly about compatibility.

126
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:09,389
No need.

127
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,390
We were invited here by Great Warrior Zhao Jing.

128
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:15,129
Once we're done with our task, we will definitely go to visit the Yueyang Sect.

129
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,810
If you can't find my wallet, don't come back.

130
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,530
When you need help, you find Zhong Wuyan. When you don't, you frolic around with others and forget her existence.
(T/N: Zhong Wuyan was a highly intelligent queen but was regarded as one of the four ugliest women in Chinese history)

131
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:31,870
Young Warrior Cao, please go back to the Yueyang Sect and notify them.

132
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:34,349
I hope that you can find your wallet soon.

133
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:37,680
Sure, sure. Let's meet again!

134
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:40,620
[Fengyang Wine Tower]

135
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,690
Cao something! Why are you following me?

136
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,030
Cao... Cao Weining.

137
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,150
Why would I care? Why are you following me?

138
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:13,990
Do you have no money to buy food again?

139
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:18,130
You want me to lend you money, don't you?

140
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:21,030
All right! Then 32% interest rate per day.

141
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:22,610
Deal?

142
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:26,870
I'm sorry. I was being impolite.

143
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,770
Miss Gu, how about I bring you to the Yueyang Sect?

144
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,190
Your master's item will not be lost.

145
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,990
I might be able to rest assured if I let the Five Lakes Alliance take care of this.

146
00:09:37,030 --> 00:09:38,850
Do you come to Yueyang frequently?

147
00:09:38,850 --> 00:09:42,450
Then you must know what kinds of tasty foods and fun attractions there are here!

148
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,610
I know them very well.

149
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:45,610
If you give me a chance to serve you,

150
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:48,170
I'll show you all the food in Yueyang.

151
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,070
I really want to bring you back to show everyone.

152
00:09:50,070 --> 00:09:53,250
They always say that I'm the biggest foodie and only know how to eat.

153
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,309
Only after meeting you did I find out

154
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:59,030
that some people actually enjoy eating more than I do!

155
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,650
- Let's go.
- Let's go! Let's go!

156
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:02,410
Miss, this way.

157
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:09,530
The Leader of Gentle Wind Sword Sect

158
00:10:09,530 --> 00:10:13,090
is a cunning old fox.

159
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:17,310
Why did he cultivate a large rabbit in his den?

160
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,170
If you live long enough, you will come across every strange occurrence.

161
00:10:23,890 --> 00:10:26,310
For example, there is a certain person

162
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,610
who is cold and unsmiling toward his own friend;

163
00:10:29,610 --> 00:10:32,410
but when facing a newly acquainted young warrior from a famous sect,

164
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:36,590
he speaks so warmly and intimately.

165
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,749
I know that you wanted to use that large rabbit

166
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:49,210
to find news about your silly disciple in Yueyang City.

167
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,070
But as soon as I saw that rascal act like an idiot in front of A'Xiang, I started to become infuriated.

168
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,110
Don't worry.

169
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:57,390
I've already asked A'Xiang to play along

170
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:59,550
and follow him to get into Yueyang Sect.

171
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:02,149
She will check on your silly disciple for you.

172
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:05,110
How is it? Aren't I considerate?

173
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:08,130
You're just making use of A'Xiang's beauty.

174
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,070
Anyway, girls must be married off once they come of age.

175
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:13,290
She will hate me if I hold her back.

176
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,690
Shameless.

177
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:21,250
It's all because of you and your disciple, the ungrateful pair.

178
00:11:21,750 --> 00:11:26,690
Why do I think this is not your real motive?

179
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:33,890
Don't you know? I'm called Philanthropist Wen

180
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:36,190
because I will feel pain all over my body

181
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:37,970
if I don't help people for a couple of days.

182
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,470
If it continues, I will even fall sick.

183
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:44,790
That's why I travel around to find kind tasks to do.

184
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,629
Does this mean that you're helping others in order to increase your own virtue?

185
00:11:48,630 --> 00:11:52,310
"I will never be a Buddha until hell is empty."
(T/N: I'm determined to save everyone)

186
00:11:53,870 --> 00:12:00,130
However, there are famous sects and heroes all over Yueyang City.

187
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,790
Brother Wen, where can you find the dwellers of hell?

188
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,189
All bright places have a dark side.

189
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:09,790
The fiercest ghosts tend to disguise themselves as humans

190
00:12:09,790 --> 00:12:12,480
and hide in the crowd.

191
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:19,620
I'm here to expose their true natures and destroy them.

192
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:25,650
A'Xu, do you think this counts as helping others to increase my own virtue?

193
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:32,350
I didn't expect you to be a justice-seeking, evil-vanquishing

194
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,370
gentleman.

195
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:38,370
It's nothing. It's all thanks to my partner.

Junior Brother Zhang!

198
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:49,930
Junior Brother Zhang, please slow down.

199
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,929
I know the way back to my room.

200
00:12:52,930 --> 00:12:54,369
I can go by myself.

201
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,449
I don't need you to walk me there, Senior Brother.

202
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:57,689
No way.

203
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:59,670
Master has said that you're an important guest.

204
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,689
There must be someone to accompany you around.

205
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:02,769
Really?

206
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,690
Am I a guest or a criminal?

207
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:06,750
- You—
- What's going on?

208
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:12,491
Xie Wuyang, why are you two arguing?

209
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:14,621
Senior, I was going to bring Junior Brother Zhang
[Xie Wuyang - Disciple of Yueyang Sect]

210
00:13:14,621 --> 00:13:16,400
to the Second Generation Disciple Compound,

211
00:13:16,401 --> 00:13:19,200
but he doesn't want a companion.

212
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:22,080
I understand. You may leave.

213
00:13:22,081 --> 00:13:23,560
Leave Chengling to me.

214
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:25,061
Yes.

215
00:13:26,461 --> 00:13:27,760
Brother Chengling,

216
00:13:27,761 --> 00:13:29,920
the city of Yueyang has recently been in a mess.

217
00:13:29,921 --> 00:13:31,600
My father is concerned about your safety.

218
00:13:31,601 --> 00:13:33,801
Even I can't go out, either.

219
00:13:34,801 --> 00:13:38,681
Are you frightened because my father spoke too fiercely?

220
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,200
Once you interact more with him, you'll understand.

221
00:13:42,201 --> 00:13:45,200
He's got a sharp tongue, but his heart is soft.

222
00:13:45,201 --> 00:13:48,841
To be honest, he usually really cares for us.

223
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,621
Chengling, our Yueyang Sect has gotten used to being frugal.

224
00:13:57,621 --> 00:14:00,400
It might not be as exquisite as your home.

225
00:14:00,401 --> 00:14:04,061
Therefore, we've arranged for you to live here.
[Conifer Residence]

226
00:14:04,061 --> 00:14:07,881
Let me know immediately if you have any problems in the future.

227
00:14:10,721 --> 00:14:12,680
All right, I shouldn't have done that.

228
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:14,720
You're not a kid anymore.

229
00:14:14,721 --> 00:14:16,621
You're an adult now.

230
00:14:18,241 --> 00:14:20,161
Senior Sister, Brother Cao Weining is looking for you.

231
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,680
All right, I got it.

232
00:14:21,681 --> 00:14:23,121
Yes.

233
00:14:24,961 --> 00:14:27,461
These seniors and juniors are all about your age.

234
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,381
Practice your martial arts with them in the future.

235
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:34,161
Everyone, please come here for a moment!

236
00:14:36,841 --> 00:14:38,760
This is Brother Chengling.

237
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:41,501
Please take care of him from now on.

238
00:14:41,501 --> 00:14:43,461
All right, Senior Sister.

239
00:14:44,121 --> 00:14:47,061
Practice your martial arts here in the future.

240
00:14:51,761 --> 00:14:54,981
- Look at him! He probably can't even withstand a single punch.
- Exactly.

241
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:57,541
He would probably collapse after just a few hits.

242
00:15:01,361 --> 00:15:04,680
That's why it will take some more time to catch Fang Buzhi.

243
00:15:04,681 --> 00:15:07,581
The city of Yueyang hasn't been very peaceful recently.

244
00:15:07,581 --> 00:15:09,520
Miss Gu Xiang is a girl.

245
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,601
It would be inconvenient for her to be out all alone.

246
00:15:11,601 --> 00:15:15,480
Moreover, Masters Zhou and Wen are Great Warrior Zhao's friends.

247
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:18,200
They will come to meet at Yueyang Sect soon.

248
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:22,481
Therefore, I think...

249
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:27,481
If Sister Xiaolian doesn't mind, can you let Miss Gu Xiang stay here?

250
00:15:27,481 --> 00:15:31,281
Since you're Weining's... friend,

251
00:15:31,281 --> 00:15:33,661
that's not a problem at all.

252
00:15:33,661 --> 00:15:37,261
Miss Gu, do you mind staying at my compound?

253
00:15:37,261 --> 00:15:38,621
Thank you, Sister Xiaolian.

254
00:15:38,621 --> 00:15:39,841
Thank you.

255
00:15:39,841 --> 00:15:42,520
My good sister, don't be so courteous with me.

256
00:15:42,521 --> 00:15:45,721
Weining's friends are my friends.

257
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:51,500
Senior Sister, Master asked you to prepare the things for worship.

258
00:15:52,481 --> 00:15:54,200
It's getting dark.

259
00:15:54,201 --> 00:15:56,080
Why are we going to worship now?

260
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:57,720
What kind of worship should I prepare for?

261
00:15:57,721 --> 00:16:01,861
Master wants to bring the junior brother from the Zhang family to worship the Five Lakes Monument.

262
00:16:01,861 --> 00:16:03,000
All right.

263
00:16:03,001 --> 00:16:06,480
Then help me bring Miss Gu to my compound.

264
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,621
She will stay in the West wing.

265
00:16:08,621 --> 00:16:10,021
Yes.

266
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:13,741
My good sister, I'll leave now.

267
00:16:13,741 --> 00:16:16,541
Feel free to let my junior sister know if you need anything.

268
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,281
All right.

269
00:16:20,921 --> 00:16:23,181
You may also let Weining know.

270
00:16:30,921 --> 00:16:35,181
Candied hawthorn on sale!

271
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:37,081
Take care, Sir.

272
00:16:38,841 --> 00:16:40,601
Welcome.

273
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:43,841
Brother Wen, take care.

274
00:16:43,841 --> 00:16:45,461
What's wrong?

275
00:16:46,161 --> 00:16:48,360
I have something else to do.

276
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:49,821
We shall part here.

277
00:16:49,821 --> 00:16:51,401
See you...

278
00:16:56,121 --> 00:16:59,281
I'll follow you wherever you go.

279
00:16:59,281 --> 00:17:04,101
Aren't you going to eradicate evil, uphold justice, and save the dwellers of hell?

280
00:17:04,101 --> 00:17:06,720
The dwellers of hell have been happy staying there for many years.

281
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:09,521
There is no rush.

282
00:17:09,521 --> 00:17:11,801
I don't understand, then.

283
00:17:11,801 --> 00:17:14,361
Why do you keep following me?

284
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:18,541
Didn't you allow me to continue following you?

285
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:21,500
Humans should do whatever they want in life.

286
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,520
Why do you have so many questions?

287
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:24,800
Then, let me ask you.

288
00:17:24,801 --> 00:17:27,541
Why do you keep following Chengling?

289
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:31,681
It's true. I've been clinging to him.

290
00:17:32,881 --> 00:17:36,461
I know that you're worried about Chengling's situation in the Five Lakes Alliance.

291
00:17:36,461 --> 00:17:39,641
Didn't I send A'Xiang to check on him?

292
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:42,360
Those old foxes are clever.

293
00:17:42,361 --> 00:17:45,061
They would not expose themselves so soon.

294
00:17:45,061 --> 00:17:48,661
I'm not only worried about the Five Lakes Alliance.

295
00:17:48,661 --> 00:17:51,960
There are now many forces within the martial arts world who are keeping their eyes on Chengling.

296
00:17:51,961 --> 00:17:54,120
I talked to the waiter just now.

297
00:17:54,121 --> 00:17:57,280
I asked him if he had seen unruly martial artists.

298
00:17:57,281 --> 00:17:59,341
He said that there indeed was a group of them.

299
00:17:59,341 --> 00:18:02,141
Those who dress like government officials outside the town.

300
00:18:07,951 --> 00:18:11,991
It's still bright now. Who is releasing the lanterns?

301
00:18:13,331 --> 00:18:15,971
The Window of Heaven is taking action in this area.

302
00:18:15,971 --> 00:18:19,371
Those who dress like government officials are from the Window of Heaven.

303
00:18:19,371 --> 00:18:20,571
I'll go to Yueyang Sect to have a look first.

304
00:18:20,571 --> 00:18:22,171

Master, thank goodness you haven't gone far yet.

306
00:18:26,251 --> 00:18:29,871
Girl, why are you back so soon?

307
00:18:29,871 --> 00:18:32,591
It's fine. Just say it.

308
00:18:32,591 --> 00:18:34,611
I was able to find my way into Yueyang Sect.

Good girl. How's the little idiot doing?

I'm here to report some urgent news.

I don't understand.

314
00:18:45,471 --> 00:18:47,970
It's getting dark. What is there to worship?

315
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,131
At night...

316
00:18:50,131 --> 00:18:51,931

00:19:29,231 --> 00:19:33,291
our ancestors imitated the Three Heroes of the Peach Garden

321
00:19:33,291 --> 00:19:36,051
in a bamboo forest.

322
00:19:36,051 --> 00:19:39,190
They became five sworn brothers.

323
00:19:39,191 --> 00:19:42,091
They worked together and helped each other.

324
00:19:42,091 --> 00:19:45,551
They founded their sects and accepted many disciples

325
00:19:45,551 --> 00:19:48,190
which created the Fives Lakes Alliance we have today.

326
00:19:48,191 --> 00:19:49,531
[Mirror Lake Sect]

327
00:19:49,531 --> 00:19:52,900
They built a monument here to tell their descendants

328
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:58,640
that the righteousness of the Five Lakes came before the World Alliance.

329
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,719
Child,

330
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,680
if you inherit your father's position as the leader of the sect,

331
00:20:14,219 --> 00:20:17,050
your name will also

332
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:19,570
be carved on this monument in the future.
[Zhang Yusen]

333
00:20:19,579 --> 00:20:23,480
You'll be respected by your descendants for generations and generations.

334
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,559
Some people told me that you weren't the type of person who could become a sect leader.

335
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:37,440
Others told me

336
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,380
that you can't bear this responsibility.

337
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:44,079
They hope that I can find an outstanding disciple

338
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,399
among the Five Lakes Alliance to become the successor of the Zhang family

339
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,599
and bear the responsibility on your behalf.

340
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,720
However, I could not agree.

341
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:58,320
No matter what, you're the direct descendant of the Zhang family.

342
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,100
Uncle Gao, you're the supreme leader.

343
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,520
I will do as you decide.

344
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,760
Shan'er!

345
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,440
Yao Zhi!

346
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:38,320
- Master!
- Master!

347
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,120
Supreme Leader Gao, we meet again.

348
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,639
Commander Han,

349
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,460
you even use such a lowly trick?

350
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,360
Are you trying to force me to obey your command?

351
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:51,599
Supreme Leader Gao, I would prefer to turn this hostility into a friendship.

352
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,640
Hand over the orphan of the Zhang family to me,

353
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,120
and I'll release them.

354
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,060
Or else...

355
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:59,180
Or else what?

356
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,880
Crossbows are important weapons of the country!

357
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,562
No one is allowed to possess them in secret!

358
00:22:12,563 --> 00:22:14,803
Is Prince Jin planning to revolt?

359
00:22:14,803 --> 00:22:16,163
Supreme Leader Gao,

360
00:22:17,203 --> 00:22:20,122
no need to worry about us.

361
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:23,002
If you hand over the child, he may live.

362
00:22:23,003 --> 00:22:27,443
If you refuse, today will be your death anniversary next year.

363
00:22:28,723 --> 00:22:31,403
If you want to bring Chengling away,

364
00:22:31,403 --> 00:22:33,743
you'll have to kill me first!

365
00:22:33,743 --> 00:22:38,603
Supreme Leader Gao, don't mistake my words as bluffing or assume that I am too afraid to attack.

366
00:22:38,603 --> 00:22:40,843
The Window of Heaven is omniscient.

367
00:22:40,843 --> 00:22:44,303
Even if I kill every one of you today,

368
00:22:44,303 --> 00:22:48,063
I still can find out the truth about the Glazed Armor.

369
00:23:02,163 --> 00:23:03,903
Damn it.

370
00:23:03,903 --> 00:23:06,123
Where did they come from all of a sudden?

371
00:23:11,643 --> 00:23:14,323
What are you doing? Are you crazy?

372
00:23:14,323 --> 00:23:15,442
This is none of your business.

373
00:23:15,443 --> 00:23:17,042
The crossbows need some time to set up.

374
00:23:17,043 --> 00:23:18,623
I'll draw their attention away during their first shot.

375
00:23:18,623 --> 00:23:21,762
While they're reloading their arrows, you go and capture their leader.

376
00:23:21,763 --> 00:23:22,922
No way.

377
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:25,243
Arrows of the crossbows are powerful and swift. A man can't fend them off.

378
00:23:25,243 --> 00:23:28,223
No matter how good your martial arts skills are, there's no way you can beat them.

379
00:23:28,223 --> 00:23:30,082
A gentleman is willing to die for his soulmate.

380
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,143
So what if I risk this for you?

381
00:23:32,143 --> 00:23:34,924
I'll distract the crossbowmen, and you'll capture the guy.

382
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:50,823
Stop!

383
00:24:00,303 --> 00:24:02,203
Why aren't you releasing them?

384
00:24:05,263 --> 00:24:06,903
Release them.

385
00:24:10,663 --> 00:24:12,042
Brothers, you are...

386
00:24:12,043 --> 00:24:13,602
Supreme Leader Gao, don't try to befriend us.

387
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:16,762
Aren't you leaving? Are you waiting for a carriage to send you off?

388
00:24:16,762 --> 00:24:20,463
I can't express my gratitude for your gracious deed. See you next time.

389
00:24:20,463 --> 00:24:22,003
Let's go.

390
00:24:23,803 --> 00:24:27,522
Little Officer, please go with us.

391
00:24:27,523 --> 00:24:29,643
Let our master go!

392
00:24:29,643 --> 00:24:31,323
Retreat!

393
00:24:31,323 --> 00:24:33,081
Everyone, retreat!

394
00:24:34,901 --> 00:24:37,021
They won't do much to me.

395
00:24:39,181 --> 00:24:42,281
You're right. I dare not provoke you guys.

396
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:46,260
Later, we'll send this master back to you fully intact.

397
00:24:46,261 --> 00:24:48,341
Hurry and leave! Take care of your crossbows!

398
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:49,961
Wait for me.

399
00:24:51,541 --> 00:24:53,001
Let's go.

400
00:25:02,341 --> 00:25:06,840
A'Xu, you owe me a huge favor now.

401
00:25:12,421 --> 00:25:15,041
Little Officer, control those eyes of yours.

402
00:25:15,041 --> 00:25:16,541
I abducted you.

403
00:25:16,541 --> 00:25:18,661
Why do you keep staring at him?

404
00:25:18,661 --> 00:25:20,401
My Lord.

405
00:25:26,701 --> 00:25:29,221
My Lord, it's really you.

406
00:25:29,221 --> 00:25:32,941
I thought I was mistaken when I saw the Passing Clouds Steps.

407
00:25:32,941 --> 00:25:36,381
My Lord, why are you here?

408
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:37,920
Why aren't you disguising yourself?

409
00:25:37,921 --> 00:25:39,520
How's your injury?

410
00:25:39,521 --> 00:25:44,081
I've had enough of hiding myself for years.

411
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:47,201
Ying'er, I'm sorry.

412
00:25:47,201 --> 00:25:49,541
I knew you would recognize me.

413
00:25:49,541 --> 00:25:51,501
We took desperate measures in this urgent situation.

414
00:25:51,501 --> 00:25:54,621
This way, you can give your subordinates an explanation.

415
00:25:55,361 --> 00:25:57,240
You were the one who saved my life.

416
00:25:57,241 --> 00:26:02,601
As long as you ask it of me, I am willing to risk everything without hesitation to fulfill your orders.

417
00:26:04,961 --> 00:26:09,081
A'Xu, should I... leave for a while?

418
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:14,281
First, I saw the Window of Heaven's Mechanical Sparrow and Drunk Life Dream Death.

419
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,080
Then, I saw disciples of the Yueyang Sect

420
00:26:16,081 --> 00:26:17,800
communicating with the Window of Heaven's secret code.

421
00:26:17,801 --> 00:26:20,480
I thought they were all coming at me.

422
00:26:20,481 --> 00:26:23,560
I didn't expect that the Window of Heaven is looking for the Glazed Armor.

423
00:26:23,561 --> 00:26:26,741
Yes. Ever since the news about the extermination

424
00:26:26,741 --> 00:26:30,280
of Mirror Lake Manor spread to Jinzhou, I was dispatched to Jiangnan

425
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:33,021
to investigate the truth behind the nursery rhyme.

426
00:26:33,081 --> 00:26:35,040
That is just a tale of the martial arts world.

427
00:26:35,041 --> 00:26:36,841
Why is the Window of Heaven taking action?

428
00:26:37,961 --> 00:26:40,361
Sorry, I don't know.

429
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:42,880
I only know that Duan Pengju cares about the Glazed Armor very much.

430
00:26:42,881 --> 00:26:44,981
He will do practically anything for it.

431
00:26:45,881 --> 00:26:48,560
My Lord, if you want to know, I can try and investigate it secretly.

432
00:26:48,561 --> 00:26:51,541
Don't. Since I took the risk and showed up just now,

433
00:26:51,541 --> 00:26:52,921
I've put you in danger.

434
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:54,941
That was my last resort.

435
00:26:54,941 --> 00:26:57,680
The few of those who joined the Window of Heaven because of me are alive now.

436
00:26:57,681 --> 00:27:01,701
As long as you live well, that is your greatest loyalty to me.

437
00:27:02,601 --> 00:27:04,561
Little Officer.

438
00:27:04,561 --> 00:27:07,341
Master, you're My Lord's friend.

439
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:08,880
You may call me Han Ying.

440
00:27:08,881 --> 00:27:10,201
Little Officer,

441
00:27:10,201 --> 00:27:14,061
why did you ask for the orphan of the Zhang family from Gao Chong?

442
00:27:14,061 --> 00:27:16,680
The Mirror Lake Sword Sect was exterminated by the Hanging Ghost.

443
00:27:16,681 --> 00:27:19,541
The Glazed Armor should be with Ghost Valley.

444
00:27:19,541 --> 00:27:21,640
Why would you torment a child from the Zhang family?

445
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:23,200
Master, you don't know.

446
00:27:23,201 --> 00:27:25,280
The Window of Heaven had a spy in Mirror Lake Sect.

447
00:27:25,281 --> 00:27:26,640
The spy witnessed with his own eyes

448
00:27:26,641 --> 00:27:28,201
that people from Ghost Valley killed the father and sons of the Zhang family

449
00:27:28,201 --> 00:27:31,280
one after another and forced them to hand over the Glazed Armor.

450
00:27:31,281 --> 00:27:33,081
Zhang Yusen didn't surrender until death,

451
00:27:33,081 --> 00:27:37,501
so the Glazed Armor must be with his youngest son who escaped.

452
00:27:42,441 --> 00:27:45,681
The old foxes in this martial arts world are sensitive.

453
00:27:45,681 --> 00:27:48,041
Even if they don't know about this incident,

454
00:27:48,641 --> 00:27:50,200
they must know that when Ghost Valley went to the Sanbai Mountain Villa

455
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:53,000
in hopes of abducting Zhang Chengling, it was basically a hint that

456
00:27:53,001 --> 00:27:55,400
the case of Mirror Lake Sword Sect has still not yet ended.

457
00:27:55,401 --> 00:27:58,581
My Lord, do you have any orders?

458
00:27:58,581 --> 00:28:01,521
The truth is that Zhang Chengling belongs to Your Lord.

459
00:28:01,521 --> 00:28:02,520
Old Wen!

460
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:06,541
My Lord, Zhang Chengling... is an acquaintance of yours?

461
00:28:06,541 --> 00:28:08,521
Please forgive me for not knowing it.

462
00:28:08,521 --> 00:28:10,521
- I will definitely find a way to—
- No need.

463
00:28:11,421 --> 00:28:15,920
After you return, act as if you've not seen me. Act as usual.

464
00:28:15,921 --> 00:28:19,101
However, there is no need to hastily take action.

465
00:28:19,101 --> 00:28:21,861
If my guess is correct,

466
00:28:21,861 --> 00:28:24,440
the Five Lakes Alliance will definitely force Zhang Chengling

467
00:28:24,441 --> 00:28:25,880
to hand over the Glazed Armor.

468
00:28:25,881 --> 00:28:29,881
Moreover, it will definitely happen before the Heroes Conference.

469
00:28:53,121 --> 00:28:56,521
"The iridescent clouds have scattered, and the Glaze has shattered."

470
00:28:56,521 --> 00:29:01,021
Is this really the Glazed Armor from the legends?

471
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:05,781
However, the man was swaggering around town with it.

472
00:29:06,521 --> 00:29:08,741
Was he a fool?

473
00:29:23,441 --> 00:29:26,061
No damn way.

474
00:29:26,061 --> 00:29:28,081
What's going on?

475
00:29:40,441 --> 00:29:44,001
First, the Window of Heaven. Then, the lord of a mountain villa.

476
00:29:46,041 --> 00:29:49,761
What kind of man am I following?

477
00:29:51,261 --> 00:29:54,161
Just now... Thank you.

478
00:29:55,521 --> 00:29:58,021
Answer my question first.

479
00:29:58,841 --> 00:30:02,301
So why would a man of high status in the Window of Heaven

480
00:30:02,301 --> 00:30:05,921
go sunbathing in Yuezhou?

481
00:30:05,921 --> 00:30:08,021
Were you trying to have fun with the common people?

482
00:30:08,021 --> 00:30:10,201
I've left the Window of Heaven.

483
00:30:11,661 --> 00:30:15,341
Old Wen, I owe you a favor.

484
00:30:15,341 --> 00:30:16,960
You don't owe me a favor.

485
00:30:16,961 --> 00:30:19,321
Rather, you owe me an explanation.

486
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:21,920
A'Xu, A'Xu.

487
00:30:21,921 --> 00:30:24,061
Do you want me to believe

488
00:30:24,061 --> 00:30:27,761
that you would do all of this just to pay back those three maces of silver?

489
00:30:27,761 --> 00:30:31,341
What's your true relationship with Zhang Chengling?

490
00:30:31,341 --> 00:30:35,101
I had already fulfilled my promise to the old fisherman in Yuezhou.

491
00:30:35,101 --> 00:30:39,341
It's just that when I saw how much danger the child has been facing from all sides,

492
00:30:39,341 --> 00:30:41,601
I couldn't stay there and do nothing.

493
00:30:43,601 --> 00:30:45,661
Treat it as a charity case.

494
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:47,401
Maybe a hundred...

495
00:30:48,361 --> 00:30:50,741
Maybe after I visit Lord Yama,
(T/N: Ruler of the underworld in Chinese and Taoist religions)

496
00:30:50,741 --> 00:30:54,501
I may suffer less from the pain of tendon-and-skin peeling.

497
00:30:57,681 --> 00:31:01,701
Friends for generations sabotage and deceive each other

498
00:31:01,701 --> 00:31:05,201
while newly acquainted strangers entrust each other with their lives.

499
00:31:05,201 --> 00:31:08,621
Interesting. Interesting!

500
00:31:08,621 --> 00:31:10,361
However, A'Xu,

501
00:31:13,650 --> 00:31:18,769
you truly aren't related to the Five Lakes Alliance in any way, correct?

502
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:26,110
Judging from your question, could it be that you have a grudge against the Five Lakes Alliance?

503
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:31,910
Since you bring it up,

504
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:34,370
I have a question for you, too.

505
00:31:34,370 --> 00:31:36,289
The day when Mirror Lake Manor was exterminated,

506
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:40,430
was your appearance on the island purely a coincidence?

507
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,790
Not really a coincidence.

508
00:31:50,850 --> 00:31:52,810
Wasn't I following you?

509
00:31:52,810 --> 00:31:56,769
Didn't you say that we would meet if we were fated?

510
00:31:56,770 --> 00:31:59,769
I didn't want to wait for fate to be gifted by the heavens,

511
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,350
so naturally, I needed to take the initiative.

512
00:32:02,350 --> 00:32:06,010
I'm asking you directly because I see you as a friend.

513
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:11,310
You see me as a friend?

514
00:32:15,990 --> 00:32:19,190
We've been through thick and thin so many times already,

515
00:32:19,190 --> 00:32:22,370
yet you only see me as a friend.

516
00:32:22,370 --> 00:32:24,670
Wen Kexing, Wen Kexing.

517
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:29,330
Seems like you have to work harder.

518
00:32:30,970 --> 00:32:33,110
Why don't you ask me what I see you as?

519
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,369
I don't care.

520
00:32:37,370 --> 00:32:40,130
Let's go. We are about to leave the mountain.

521
00:32:49,930 --> 00:32:53,670
You're my soulmate.

522
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,400
Search everywhere!

523
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:12,600
He died from poison.

524
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:13,600
Be careful, everyone!

525
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:16,000
Don't casually touch anything in this room. Beware of leftover poison.

526
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,400
- Yes.
- Yes.

527
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,000
Senior Brother Gao, look!

528
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,700
Are the things on this table the spoils?

529
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,600
Fang Buzhi is very cunning.

530
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:32,000
Who was so competent as to find him even before we did?

531
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Come again.

532
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:37,000
Watermelon on sale! Big and sweet watermelon!

533
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,600
Watermelon on sale!

534
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,200
Watermelon! Big and sweet!

535
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,600
Customer, taste it. Big and sweet watermelon.

536
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:43,700
Which is the sweetest?

537
00:33:43,700 --> 00:33:45,800
Here. This. This one is sweet.

538
00:33:45,800 --> 00:33:48,000
- Take the bigger one.
- A'Xu.

539
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,400
It's so sweet!

540
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:57,200
Customer, you haven't paid yet.

541
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:02,000
This one.

542
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:05,800
All right. Thank you!

543
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,600
Do you want some?

544
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,200
Thank you very much.

545
00:34:16,600 --> 00:34:18,100
Take care.

546
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:22,200
Are you done eating?

547
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,700
Why do you look like a child who's on his first visit to a market?

548
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:28,300
Don't you want to find your wallet and your jade amulet?

549
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,400
It's fine if I can't find them. It doesn't matter.

550
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,500
A'Xu, do you want to try this syrup water?

551
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:36,400
I even asked him to add two extra spoonfuls of syrup.

552
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,200
You aren't spending your own money.

553
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,400
You're generous at spending another's money.

554
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,100
Don't be so stingy.

555
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,800
I saved your silly disciple, right?

556
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:46,800
You're not losing anything from this deal.

557
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:49,200
Who's making a deal with you?

558
00:34:49,200 --> 00:34:51,000
Return me the money.

559
00:34:52,200 --> 00:34:53,900
A'Xu.

560
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
Just let me spend your money.

561
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,000
It's not a loss.

562
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,800
You risked your life for the old man because of three maces of silver.

563
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,600
Besides, I only spent a little bit of your money.

564
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:09,200
Worst comes to worst, I can just become your servant.

565
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,900
Is that all right?

566
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,000
All right.

567
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,500
Then please go in a mellow manner.

568
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,600
Sure! I'll go wherever you go!

569
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,400
Come and have a look!

570
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,000
A troupe from the Western Regions!

571
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,800
It's a once-in-a-lifetime rare chance.

572
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:33,600
A'Xu, have you seen Western Regions' magic?

573
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Why are they cutting a pretty lady with knives?

574
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:38,400
Shapeshifting humans! A string of coins for entry!

575
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,800
I guarantee that you'll be impressed.

576
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:44,000
Let's go and have a look. I've never seen this before!

577
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,600
A troupe from the Western Regions.

578
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:47,600
Let's go. Fang Buzhi might be inside.

579
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:48,600
Let's go.

580
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:51,400
Welcome, Sirs. Please come in.

581
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:27,000
An exotic performance. It's quite special.

582
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,000
This zither...

583
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:57,000
Let's see what trick he's got.

584
00:37:38,600 --> 00:37:41,400
Good!

585
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:47,800
Good!

586
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:03,400
Congratulations on the upcoming Heroes Conference of the Five Lakes Alliance.
[If not me, who deserves to become the Martial Arts Supreme Leader?]

587
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:09,600
Here are ten human heads, representing the Ghost Valley's goodwill.

588
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:15,300
Hurry up! Arrest them!

589
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,400
Junior Brother Wei?

590
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,800
Dear folks, please don't panic.

591
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:33,500
Our Yueyang Sect will definitely investigate this and bring clear results!

592
00:38:33,500 --> 00:38:35,400
Under Supreme Leader Gao's leadership,

593
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:38,500
we will definitely bring the bad guys to justice.

594
00:38:38,500 --> 00:38:40,800
Don't be afraid.

595
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:45,600
Yueyang Sect seems to wield even more power than the government officials here.

596
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:47,800
Protecting and keeping peace in this place?

597
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:52,400
Supreme Leader Gao hasn't even passed away, why are they making him out to be an immortal?

598
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,100
Yueyang Sect is heavily guarded. They've been constantly patrolling around.

599
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:58,000
There are many martial artists in this town, too.

600
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,000
I didn't expect that Ghost Valley would be able to wreak such havoc.

601
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:05,200
This move slapped him hard on the face.

602
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:08,600
Supreme Leader Gao has completely lost his reputation.

603
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:12,600
Ghost Valley made such a great effort solely to humiliate Yueyang Sect.

604
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:16,000
Do you believe me when I say that this is just the start?

605
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,300
Move backward!

606
00:39:22,700 --> 00:39:25,200
Are you worried about your so-called disciple?

607
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,800
What disciple?

608
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:32,000
Here you go again. Why aren't you admitting it to me?

609
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:35,600
Why don't we take this chance to catch up with Zhao Jing?

610
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:41,600
It will be a perfect opportunity to pay our well wishes to the benevolent Iron Judge, Gao Chong.

611
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,400
Master!

612
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,800
Wei... Junior Brother Wei, he...

613
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:06,200
Yunge, my son! I'll take revenge for you!

614
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:07,600
Goddamn Ghost Valley!

615
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,000
Those heartless demons!

616
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,700
I will fight you to death.

617
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:17,400
Absurd! How can they be so defiant?

618
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,000
I think Ghost Valley is overestimating itself!

619
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:23,400
Why? No matter how fierce the ghosts in Mount Qingya are,

620
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:25,600
how could they dare to go against the entire martial arts world?

621
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:28,500
Yet they already have!

622
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:31,200
Eldest Brother, don't get upset.

623
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,600
The unrighteous actions of Ghost Valley will bring it to its own downfall.

624
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:38,600
Eldest Brother, don't let your anger damage your health.

625
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,500
I swear...

626
00:40:40,500 --> 00:40:43,400
I'll make the Ghost Valley pay back tenfold!

627
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,500
Tenfold?

628
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:53,600
This is an extreme disgrace!

629
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:57,700
If I can't demolish Ghost Valley,

630
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,400
how could I dare to continue living in this universe?

631
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,800
- Yes!
- Supreme Leader, you're right!

632
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:05,600
An eye for an eye! Demolish Ghost Valley!

633
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:08,300
An eye for an eye! Demolish Ghost Valley!

634
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:12,300
An eye for an eye! Demolish Ghost Valley!

635
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,200
Masters, please wait for a while.

636
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,800
Thank you.

637
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,300
Brother Wen. Brother Zhou.

638
00:41:28,300 --> 00:41:30,000
Great Warrior Zhao.

639
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,000
How have you been?

640
00:41:32,000 --> 00:41:34,100
Sorry for not welcoming you earlier.

641
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,500
Great Warrior Shen.

642
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,900
We were looking for you guys,

643
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,200
but you came here yourselves.

644
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:42,800
Great Warrior Shen, you were looking for me?

645
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:44,800
I'm surprised and flattered.

646
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:46,000
Stop acting.

647
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:47,800
The incident of Sanbai Mountain Villa happened unexpectedly,

648
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,600
yet you two left without a word. What did you mean by it?

649
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:51,800
Apologies for our rudeness.

650
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:55,600
I saw that the alliance was facing many problems and was clearly not in the condition to welcoming guests.

651
00:41:55,600 --> 00:41:57,300
That's why we decided to leave first.

652
00:41:57,300 --> 00:41:59,600
I had left a note before I left.

653
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,200
Great Warrior Shen, why are you blaming me?

654
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,100
What a good excuse.

655
00:42:03,100 --> 00:42:04,600
On the night that you left,

656
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,600
Second Brother's villa suffered a loss from theft.

657
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,500
Care to explain?

658
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,200
There's nothing to say.

659
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:11,600
Great Warrior Zhao,

660
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,600
are you blaming me for the theft at your villa?

661
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:19,300
Of course not. It's all a misunderstanding.

662
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:22,200
They are the benefactors of the Five Lakes Alliance.

663
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,500
Why are you randomly suspecting them?

664
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:26,000
Benefactors?

665
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,200
Eldest Brother!

666
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,100
This Master Wen rescued Chengling from Mirror Lake Sword Sect

667
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:34,800
and brought him all the way to my house.

668
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:38,000
They've indeed helped a lot.

669
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:52,400
Master Wen, do you know me?

670
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:55,800
Iron Judge, Gao Chong, your name is very famous.

671
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,600
It's not strange that I know you.

672
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,800
It would be an honor if you knew me.

673
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,700
Supreme Leader Gao, do you recognize me?

674
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,600
Sorry, I do not, Master Wen.

675
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,500
Master Wen, how did you know my brother, Zhang Yusen?

676
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:21,200
Thank you and Mr. Zhou for your escort of thousands of miles.

677
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:26,000
The Five Lakes Alliance will remember your kindness.

678
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:28,600
Why is Old Wen looking strange?

679
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:33,400
What's the relationship between Gao Chong and him?

680
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,800
I didn't have the honor to know Great Warrior Zhang.

681
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:40,800
I was only being righteous. It was just fate.

682
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:45,400
We came here today with the intent to visit Chengling,

683
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,300
but it seems as though we have come at the wrong time.

684
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,900
Is Chengling doing well?

685
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:58,200
Chengling is feeling unwell. He's currently getting some rest.

686
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:00,500
It's not a good time to visit him.

687
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,600
Chengling is sick?

688
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:04,800
Is it serious?

689
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,200
Why don't we have a look?

690
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Master Wen, your full name is...

691
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:16,200
I'm Wen Kexing.

692
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:24,900
Master Wen, I forgot to ask which sect you are from.

693
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:27,200
I don't belong to any sects.

694
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,600
It's just that my father taught some crude martial arts skills,

695
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,400
and I've trained them casually.

696
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,000
Then, may I know who your father is?

697
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:37,400
He's raised such a heroic young man.

698
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:42,000
My father was just an ordinary, unsophisticated man.

699
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,800
He can't be considered as anyone important.

700
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:48,300
He couldn't even be considered as... an intelligent man.

701
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:50,800
It's been many years since my father passed away.

702
00:44:50,800 --> 00:44:52,800
You, Great Warriors, have been busy.

703
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:55,600
How would you remember someone like him?

704
00:44:55,600 --> 00:44:58,700
Master! Things are bad! Master!

705
00:44:58,700 --> 00:45:01,600
Master! They've killed... They've killed someone again!

706
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:05,000
Don't you see the guests here? Why are you panicking?

707
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:06,200
Master,

708
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,800
when Senior Brother Gao was patrolling, he discovered another corpse.

709
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:11,100
The body has already been carried out there.

710
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,800
Got it.

711
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:54,800
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

712
00:45:54,800 --> 00:46:02,000
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

713
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:09,100
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

714
00:46:09,100 --> 00:46:17,600
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

715
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:24,600
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

716
00:46:24,600 --> 00:46:32,200
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

717
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:36,000
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

718
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,800
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

719
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:47,600
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

720
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:51,200
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

721
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:54,600
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

722
00:46:54,600 --> 00:47:02,700
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

723
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:06,000
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

724
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,000
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

725
00:47:10,000 --> 00:47:17,000
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

726
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:25,800
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
