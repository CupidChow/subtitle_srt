So this is the guy who stole Old Wen's Glazed Armor.

No wonder. He grabbed a hot potato

If I wanted to keep it,

The Four Sages of Anji are all masters of music,

but they come from very different backgrounds.

00:36:12,169 --> 00:36:14,270
You damned midget!

484
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:17,310
This is no place for you to speak!

485
00:36:23,410 --> 00:36:25,560
Third Brother!

486
00:36:27,650 --> 00:36:29,770
Third Brother!

487
00:36:29,770 --> 00:36:30,899
Third Brother!

488
00:36:30,899 --> 00:36:34,959
Feng Xiaofeng, you vicious bastard! Give us the antidote!

489
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:38,460
Then give me the Glazed Armor in exchange!

490
00:36:38,460 --> 00:36:40,229
Do you have any dignity?

491
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:42,319
It's okay for the Beggar Gangs, the Mount Hua Sect, and the Kongtong Sect

492
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:44,099
to fight for the Glazed Armor.

493
00:36:44,099 --> 00:36:47,790
After all, their secret records are in the armory.

494
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:51,669
Which hole did you jump out of, midget?

495
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:55,560
Twenty years ago, you weren't even in the martial arts world.

496
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:58,400
Scram! Scram far away!

497
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:01,210
You disgust me!

498
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:03,500
Gao Shannu, beat her!

499
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:05,210
Enough!

500
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:22,920
Elder Huang, the Beggar Gangs have always been on good terms with the Five Lakes Alliance.

501
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:28,540
Yet you have been continuously leading your beggar gang disciples to create trouble all over the city.

502
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:33,000
Are you disregarding the Five Lakes Alliance?

503
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,930
Supreme Leader Gao, I should be the one asking you that!

504
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:40,509
The Five Lakes Alliance has been unbearably arrogant lately,

505
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:43,610
but I let it go for your sake.

506
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:47,500
Now you brought so many people to surround us?

507
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,359
Is the Five Lakes Alliance acting this overbearing

508
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:53,890
because you think you no longer have equals in the martial arts world?

509
00:37:53,890 --> 00:37:58,429
Elder Huang, it's not your place to represent the martial arts world, is it?

510
00:37:58,429 --> 00:38:01,619
Mount Hua Sect only follows Supreme Leader Gao's lead!

511
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:03,469
You ass kisser!

512
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:07,379
The reputation of the Five Mount and Sword Sects is ruined because of you!

513
00:38:07,379 --> 00:38:11,769
Elder Huang, you are so close with Tao Hong and Lv Liu.

514
00:38:11,769 --> 00:38:14,729
You are the one who humiliated the Beggar Gangs!

515
00:38:14,729 --> 00:38:18,829
Better than your Five Lakes Alliance which has never had any dignity, to begin with!

516
00:38:18,829 --> 00:38:21,979
Grandma Tao Hong, you better not think that just because you're an old woman,

517
00:38:21,979 --> 00:38:23,989
you can gossip however you wish.

518
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:27,100
Although I can't cut off your tongue,

519
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,820
I can slit your throat!

520
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:31,090
How dare you!

521
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:34,309
- What are you doing?
- Shen Shen!

522
00:38:34,309 --> 00:38:36,650
You dare to say such words,

523
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:39,890
yet you're shameless enough to claim that you're from a proper and righteous sect.

524
00:38:39,890 --> 00:38:44,340
Killing devils and maintaining justice is the duty of a proper sect!

525
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:48,799
Supreme Leader Gao, you are indeed bold!

526
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:53,189
How many worms did you spill from this old clay pot?

527
00:38:53,190 --> 00:38:55,359
This is disgusting.

528
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:56,889
I'm done fighting you!

529
00:38:56,889 --> 00:38:59,169
Feng Xiaofeng! Don't you leave!

530
00:38:59,169 --> 00:39:01,319
Leave the antidote!

531
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:03,669
Fifth Brother, stop him!

532
00:39:03,669 --> 00:39:05,400
Follow me!

533
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:10,230
Madam Pei, this is Master Gao.

534
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:14,370
The Four Sages of Anji are my honored guests.

535
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:19,100
I'll wait and see who dares to trouble you!

536
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,720
Madam Pei!

537
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,550
The Glazed Armor!

538
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:08,060
Stop! Don't kill him!

539
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:36,570
We've lived in seclusion for fifteen years, which has made us forget our worries.

540
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:40,619
Fifteen years of accompaniment was destroyed in one instant

541
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:43,730
because of this thing!

542
00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:46,200
Brother Du, you...!

543
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:49,770
Supreme Leader Gao, the four of us retreated from the human world long ago

544
00:40:49,770 --> 00:40:52,119
and only wished to spend the rest of our lives in the forest.

545
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,719
We only came out to take part in the Heroes Conference

546
00:40:55,719 --> 00:40:57,919
because of you.

547
00:40:57,919 --> 00:41:03,289
But I never expected that the loyal friendship between you and me

548
00:41:03,289 --> 00:41:07,210
would cause us to die in Yueyang City.

549
00:41:07,210 --> 00:41:11,669
Gao Chong, Brother Pei stole the Glazed Armor back for you.

550
00:41:11,669 --> 00:41:13,460
Was it worth it?

551
00:41:13,460 --> 00:41:15,890
Was it?

552
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:20,540
Brother Du, I am so sorry!

553
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,580
But, Brother Du, please rest assured.

554
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:27,900
I will definitely avenge you and the others!

555
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:33,570
If your soulmates have all left this world, what is the point in staying?

556
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:36,130
Brother Du!

557
00:41:37,090 --> 00:41:38,690
No!

558
00:42:01,130 --> 00:42:06,940
Supreme Leader Gao, every debt has a debtor.

559
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:11,509
The Four Sages of Anji either directly

560
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:15,440
or indirectly died because of Feng Xiaofeng's evil.

561
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:20,070
This is not related to the Beggar Gangs.

562
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,090
This brother was tricked and poisoned.

563
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:29,779
Tao Hong and Lv Liu had no choice but to act out of self-defense.

564
00:42:29,779 --> 00:42:31,639
The Beggar Gangs and the Five Lakes Alliance

565
00:42:31,639 --> 00:42:35,309
don't need to ruin our relationship because of this small incident—

566
00:42:35,309 --> 00:42:40,610
Elder Huang! Don't you want the Glazed Armor?

567
00:42:42,170 --> 00:42:44,120
Take it!

568
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:46,300
Is one piece enough?

569
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,520
I'll give you another!

570
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,150
Everyone!

571
00:43:01,150 --> 00:43:02,990
On July 15th,

572
00:43:02,990 --> 00:43:08,409
after the Heroes Conference, I will clearly explain everything

573
00:43:08,409 --> 00:43:12,180
about the Glazed Armor to you all!

574
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,079
Elder Huang, the two of us must settle our matters

575
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:20,460
after the conference!

576
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:22,080
Bullshit!

577
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,665
[Renyi Hall]

578
00:44:13,083 --> 00:44:19,205
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

579
00:44:20,783 --> 00:44:27,950
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

580
00:44:27,950 --> 00:44:34,983
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

581
00:44:34,983 --> 00:44:42,670
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

582
00:44:43,539 --> 00:44:50,550
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

583
00:44:50,550 --> 00:44:58,050
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

584
00:44:58,050 --> 00:45:01,960
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

585
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:05,515
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

586
00:45:05,515 --> 00:45:13,460
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

587
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:16,904
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

588
00:45:16,904 --> 00:45:20,582
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

589
00:45:20,582 --> 00:45:28,650
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

590
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:32,149
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

591
00:45:32,149 --> 00:45:35,849
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

592
00:45:35,849 --> 00:45:42,894
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

593
00:45:42,894 --> 00:45:51,683
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
