[Word of Honor]

22
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,250
[Episode 19]

23
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:57,570
Your wife died from childbirth. Was it I who caused it?

24
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:00,890
You say you hate me. You should have just killed me long ago

25
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:02,990
to compensate your wife's life with mine!

26
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,040
Since you chose to raise me to adulthood,

27
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,060
why wouldn't you give me a healthy life?

28
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,820
You clearly knew that the Yin Yang Book can revive the dead and reverse yin and yang.

29
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,050
You knew that it was right in the armory!

30
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:15,990
Yet you refused to mention it.

31
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:19,720
You just sat by and watched me live as a disabled person for more than ten years!

32
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,780
I told you many times, but you never believed me.

33
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,960
What could I possibly have done?

34
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,110
Doctors' hearts are like that of parents.

35
00:02:27,110 --> 00:02:29,930
If the Yin Yang Book really had such a miraculous effect,

36
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:32,570
why would the Miracle Healer Valley

37
00:02:32,570 --> 00:02:35,590
hide it as a secret?

38
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:40,730
Lies! Nonsense!

39
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,450
It's all just equivocation!

40
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:44,190
How would you know if you never tried?

41
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,290
For your dead wife, you moved the entire Dragon Pool Cabinet.

42
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,470
For your dead brothers, you went through so many years of suffering.

43
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:56,300
Only for your living son, you wouldn't open the armory!

44
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:06,090
Excuse me. I did not raise my son well and am reaping what I have sown.

45
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:08,420
There's nothing more to say.

46
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,340
Do you know Yue Feng'er from the Miracle Healer Valley?

47
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:14,400
Senior Ye,

48
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,570
are you speaking of the Senior Sister of the Three Heroes of the Miracle Healer Valley?

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,400
The Ganoderma Immortal, Yue Feng'er?

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:25,380
If it wasn't for the help of the Three Heroes of the Miracle Healer Valley,

51
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,760
Yuzhui may not have been willing to marry me.

52
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,410
Was this Yue Feng'er the wife of Rong Xuan?

53
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:37,490
Yes. Only my Brother Rong could be a good match for

54
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:41,300
a figure like Miss Yue.

55
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:44,410
So what exactly happened between Rong Xuan and his wife?

56
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,690
You also know, don't you?

57
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:47,120
I do.

58
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,380
Master Long, I have a question to ask.

59
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:52,900
Would you be willing to answer?

60
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:57,240
Zishu, who is this? Is he your little friend?

61
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,940
Uncle Long,

62
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,810
this is my closest friend.

63
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,310
His name is Wen Kexing.

64
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,330
Old Wen is filled with hatred for his father, Rong Xuan.

65
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,340
The situation is not yet clear.

66
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:17,120
Should I reveal his identity or not?

67
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,650
Little Zishu is also making friends now.

68
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,000
That's wonderful.

69
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:25,070
Long Xiao said at the Heroes Conference

70
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:29,470
that Gao Chong once threatened and used you to open the armory. Is this true?

71
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,290
Where should I begin telling this?

72
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,310
The last time I saw Gao Chong

73
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:38,050
was twenty years ago.

74
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:42,380
Moreover, the Glazed Armor was in their hands.

75
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:46,130
Why would they seek me to open the armory?

76
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,950
Long Xiao also said that twenty years ago,

77
00:04:50,950 --> 00:04:54,010
Rong Xuan deceived you into constructing the armory. Is that true?

78
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:56,290
Deceived?

79
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,490
Child, don't believe a single word this boy said.

80
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:03,730
I was completely willing to help Brother Rong

81
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:06,590
rebuild the armory.

82
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,610
Uncle Long, twenty years ago, there were many false rumors in the martial arts world

83
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,060
regarding the origin of the armory.

84
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:24,290
Can you tell us, from beginning to end,

85
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:26,590
why Elder Rong Xuan

86
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,760
wanted to construct the armory back then?

87
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,960
Moreover, what were the matters concerning the armory?

88
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,220
If Little Zishu wants to know,

89
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:37,790
I am naturally willing to tell you.

90
00:05:37,790 --> 00:05:42,540
However, where do I begin?

91
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,700
The first person who got to know Brother Rong

92
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,910
was your master, Qin Huaizhang.

93
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,900
Then, due to chance,

94
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,440
we all slowly got to know each other, pursuing chivalry together

95
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:58,180
and eliminating evil.

96
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:00,320
We were so free and happy.

97
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,830
It was all thanks to your master's reputation and Brother Rong's good fortune

98
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:06,910
that I, a bookworm, was able to have

99
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:09,120
such a joyful time in the martial arts world.

100
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,690
One group of people, one cluster of light. How great that time was!

101
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:16,370
What virtue or ability did I have

102
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:20,070
to merit being with these brilliant people?

103
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:23,710
Uncle Long, then what about Elder Rong's armory?

104
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:28,350
Zishu, although Brother Rong was the pillar of our group,

105
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:30,700
the armory wasn't his.

106
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,960
All of us helped him construct it.

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,520
You just spoke of the five brothers of the Five Lakes Alliance.

108
00:06:39,660 --> 00:06:41,430
Was my father among them?

109
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,820
Who is your father?

110
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,730
My father is the chivalrous hero of Mirror Lake, Zhang Yusen.

111
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,490
What?

112
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:52,220
You are Yusen's son?

113
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:56,330
Good child, come here! Let Uncle take a look at you.

114
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,160
That foolish brat, Yusen.

115
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,370
I never expected that he could sire such a handsome son.

116
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:14,870
You must take after your mother.

117
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:18,050
Is your father well?

118
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:22,470
M-My father... is already gone.

119
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,260
Uncle Long, it's a long story.

120
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,970
Great Hero Zhang died to protect the Glazed Armor.

121
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:34,380
Lu Taichong; Sect Leader Lu, and Gao Chong; Supreme Leader Gao

122
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:38,190
also died for the Glazed Armor. The ghosts of Mount Qingya have entered human society,

123
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:40,260
causing bloody carnage again.

124
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,990
The people of the martial arts world are shaken.

125
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:45,290
There is nonstop killing for revenge. All of this is happening

126
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:48,130
because of two words: Glazed Armor.

127
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:50,590
What is the use in vying for the Glazed Armor?

128
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:53,980
The Glazed Armor is just a lock.

129
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,520
Without Brother Rong's key, what use is it to have the lock?

130
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,540
Key?

131
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:03,440
Is Rong Xuan's key in your hands?

132
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,120
- No.
- No?

133
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:11,100
That's right. You don't believe me, well, no one else would either.

134
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:20,810
There's nothing I can do. Yuzhui's already gone anyway.

135
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,670
I don't want to see anyone anymore.

136
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,350
Enough, stop rambling.

137
00:08:25,350 --> 00:08:27,370
Where is the key? Who took it?

138
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:30,000
I know, but I'm not telling you.

139
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,760
I swore an oath to not tell.

140
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,960
You must tell me now!

141
00:08:38,060 --> 00:08:41,740
What can you do to me?

142
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:50,450
Before my eyes, my own son

143
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:55,170
killed off every single one of my disciples and servants one-by-one.

144
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:58,890
He sawed off my two legs bit by bit.

145
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,080
What more can you do to me?

146
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,420
Senior Ye. Great Hero Ye.

147
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:06,890
Please don't make things difficult for this elder. He—

148
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,170
Shut up! I want to know what exactly happened to Rong Xuan.

149
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:15,250
You built the armory together, and then what? He was perfectly fine, how did he go crazy?

150
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,710
Did one of you harm him?

151
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:21,420
Old Monster! If he doesn't want to talk about it, why do you keep pushing?

152
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,170
Tell me now!

153
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:24,980
Will you ever stop?

154
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,540
- Are you crazy?
- You're an eyesore to me. So what if I suddenly want to beat you up?

155
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,490
You've gone through such hardships to find the truth here. Why are you going crazy now?

156
00:09:37,490 --> 00:09:39,990
Do you know what it means to set out cheerfully and come back disappointed?

157
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:43,050
I don't want to know the truth anymore, is that not allowed?

158
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,200
You've had your fun, and that's enough! Stop fighting!

159
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,600
Wen! Don't look for trouble!

160
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I must find out why Rong Xuan died! He was my disciple!

161
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:58,200
Your disciple?

162
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:07,910
[Spiritual plaque of deceased elder brother Gao Chong]

163
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:17,400
Mountain Sealing Sacred Sword...

164
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:21,400
The Dashing Duo of Miracle Healer Valley.

165
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,000
Sect Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance.

166
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,600
Eldest Brother Gao.

167
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,600
I've finally managed to gather you all completely.

168
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:43,000
You all looked down on me and shunned me back then.

169
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,600
Back when you were ordering me around like a toy,

170
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,350
did you ever think

171
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
that one day,

172
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,000
I would be the one honoring your deaths?

173
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,200
Why did you have to create that bullshit armory?
[Spiritual plaque of deceased elder brother Rong Xuan]

174
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,600
That sudden, bright idea of yours

175
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,400
made me lose my head and follow you with eagerness,

176
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:14,800
but you're a wild seed with no connections.

177
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,400
You're not afraid to offend the martial arts world,

178
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,200
but what about us?

179
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:26,000
I, Zhao Jing, struggled for half of my life.

180
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,800
I had finally managed to climb from being a poor fool into becoming the leader of the Tai Lake sect,

181
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,600
but it was all because I met you!

182
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:35,300
All of it almost turned into a burst bubble!

183
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,800
You had the Combined Six Cultivation Method in your hands.

184
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,500
You yourself weren't able to manage it,

185
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,600
but you wouldn't let everyone else have a try.

186
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,200
Fine.

187
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,600
Then none of us will master it!

188
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:53,600
You were the clouds and I was the dirt back then.

189
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:57,000
Whatever you said was right.

190
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,400
Whatever I did was wrong.

191
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,150
And now?

192
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,000
You're just a plaque!

193
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,800
While I'm standing here in perfect health!

194
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,340
Eldest Brother Gao,

195
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:22,600
if your spirit is up there somewhere,

196
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,500
you must feel so regretful, seeing all of this.

197
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:27,800
As your brother, I did advise you before,

198
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,000
but you just wouldn't listen.

199
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,400
You just had to go crazy with that man by the surname of Rong!

200
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:35,300
You just had to believe that pig-headed Shen Shen.

201
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,800
Why did you have to hang on to power and not let go?
[Spiritual plaque of deceased elder brother Gao Chong]

202
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,830
You led yourself down this path you ended up on.

203
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:48,000
However, what I, Zhao Jing, regret the most

204
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,600
is that I couldn't let you see all of this while you were alive.

205
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,300
[Spiritual plaque of deceased elder brother Gao Chong]

206
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:58,600
I just want everyone to know

207
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:02,000
that only I, Zhao Jing, am supreme among men.

208
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:04,600
Only I, Zhao Jing,

209
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:10,100
can expand and elevate the Five Lakes Alliance.

210
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,200
The Mountain Sealing Sword Technique.

211
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,800
You really are his master.

212
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,200
You are Ye...

213
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,200
Ye Baiyi!

214
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,200
I never tho... thought you would still be alive!

215
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:42,800
Are you at the level of the Combined Six Cultivation Method?

216
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,400
The Heaven-crippling, Earth-breaking Combined Six Cultivation Method

217
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,600
is actually real!

218
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,200
Long life and endless youth!

219
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:52,800
One with the sky!

220
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:58,100
Elder, your Combined Six Cultivation Method

221
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:00,400
is still, to this day,

222
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,800
safely stored in the armory.

223
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:08,500
Those who have passed are gone. Brother Rong was ignorant back then,

224
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,700
and he committed wrongs.

225
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,600
He was deeply remorseful.

226
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,800
Deeply? Remorseful?

227
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,400
Incredibly stupid!

228
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,800
Brother Rong told his wife

229
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,800
to find a way to send the Glazed Armor Key

230
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,200
to his master in Changming Mountain

231
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:34,400
in order to tell him everything that happened from start to end

232
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:37,200
and to, on his behalf,

233
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:40,000
kowtow and report his crimes in front of his elder.

234
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
It's just that nobody ever thought...

235
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,200
And then? Then what happened?

236
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:53,200
Zishu, is there wine?

237
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,800
Elder.

238
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,400
There is no sun or moon in the mountain,

239
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:25,200
and I have no idea how long it has been since I tested this kind of great stuff.

240
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,000
Long!

241
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:32,200
Hurry up and speak! Stop keeping us in suspense!

242
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,200
Elder Ye, I'm not keeping you in suspense.

243
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,520
Heaven allowed me to hold onto this breath of air

244
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:41,600
and live to this moment

245
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:44,120
because it wants me to let the truth

246
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:47,000
get brought to the light of day.

247
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,400
Good wine! Satisfying!

248
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,200
"The water of the Yellow River rises to the sky."

249
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:07,200
"It flows to the ocean and doesn't return".

250
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,100
"Do you not see..."

251
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:16,800
"Do you not see the reflection of lamentable white hair through the mirror of the high chamber?"

252
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,200
"Although silken black at dawn, it has become snow-white at dusk".

253
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:25,500
"Do not put down your cups! Drink the wine!"
(T/N: All of the above quotations are from the poem "Drinking Wine" by Li Bai)

254
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,000
- Wonderful!
- Wonderful!

255
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,200
- Wonderful!
- Hey!

256
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:33,200
A'Shen, what are you doing?

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,700
Spare me, Elder Sister Yue!
[Shen Shen]

258
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:37,600
- Eldest Senior Sister, let him go.
- That's right.
[Zhen Ruyu]

259
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,800
A'Shen, seriously. Why did you have to break such a fine cup?
[Yue Feng'er]

260
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,800
Everyone in the martial arts world says

261
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,200
that the twin beauties of Miracle Healer Valley absorbed all of the valley's beauty and intelligence.

262
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,600
Then, Second Brother Zhen,
[Gu Miaomiao]

263
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,000
I guess the leftover foolishness and ugliness was all absorbed by you!
[Lu Taichong, Qin Huaizhang]

264
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,200
[Long Que, Zhang Yusen]

265
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:57,600
A'Shen! Ruyu defended you and yet you're still teasing him?
[Rong Xuan]

266
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:00,400
Brother Rong, did I say anything wrong?

267
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I can't say that you're wrong.

268
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:07,300
It's just a kind of... a habit in the martial arts world.

269
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
The martial arts world?

270
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,000
Interesting.
[Zhao Jing]

271
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,800
A'Jing! What are you doing there by yourself? Come have some wine!

272
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,800
- A'Jing! Come over!
- Come have some wine!
- Come over!

273
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:19,000
A'Jing, come here!

274
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,600
Hurry up! Don't stall so much.

275
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,600
Which idiot went to Mount Tai to steal a book and left traces behind?

276
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,600
Nobody saw me.

277
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:39,400
Nobody saw you?
 [Gao Chong]

278
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,600
The Mount Tai Elder has already gone and asked Father for an explanation!

279
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,600
Father has asked all Five Lakes Alliance disciples that match the description to go to Mount Tai to let them find the culprit.

280
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:50,800
A'Jing! You're really useless in everything you do!

281
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,800
You're useless!

282
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,400
A'Chong.

283
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,400
Sit, sit.

284
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:58,000
Calm down for now. Let's consider it for a bit longer.

285
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,800
If my actions really do get exposed,

286
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:03,400
I will beg pardon from the Alliance leader myself. I won't drag you all down.

287
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,200
Don't be rash!

288
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:08,400
How can you own up to this? Even expelling you from the sect would be a light punishment!

289
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,600
What if they destroy your martial arts ability?

290
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,000
Eldest Brother! Eldest Brother!

291
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,800
Think of something!

292
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:19,100
A'Jing, now you won't even tolerate being scolded?

293
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,400
Don't you think you deserve a scolding?

294
00:18:23,300 --> 00:18:26,000
I'll take sole responsibility for my own actions.

295
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,400
The World's Armory is my idea.

296
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,400
If someone has to take responsibility, it would be me. Why worry?

297
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:38,000
Rest assured. Even if the sky falls down, the tall ones can still hold it up.

298
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,600
Brother Rong lit a fire in our hearts,

299
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,000
burning us all into demons.

300
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,200
He often said that different perspectives of different sects

301
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:50,200
and the rules of the martial arts world

302
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,600
were all unnecessary and convoluted.

303
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:58,000
True martial artists should be open and honest.

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,800
Those years, we committed ourselves to gathering the world's lost knowledge.

305
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,000
A bunch of idiots!

306
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
Weren't those lost pieces of knowledge all written by people?

307
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,800
Putting all your effort into gaining secrets that others have discovered.

308
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,000
Did you think that others have two brains or that you had none of your own?

309
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
Just learning whatever others teach.

310
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:18,200
How is that different from being a monkey trained by a carnival man?

311
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,800
And for this,

312
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,400
you got yourself in trouble and lost your life.

313
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:27,200
Thank goodness that little beast left my tutelage on his own.

314
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,000
Otherwise, if I'd raised such an idiot of a disciple,

315
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,600
I should've just smashed my head into a wall and died.

316
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:33,800
Old monster! Shut your bird mouth!

317
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:36,000
Elder, you keep interrupting.

318
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,900
When will Uncle Long ever get to the main subject?

319
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:43,550
What Elder Ye said was not wholly without reason.

320
00:19:43,550 --> 00:19:46,460
Zishu, back then, your master

321
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:49,760
advised us largely in the same way.

322
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,150
My master?

323
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:56,290
Choosing a location for the armory took a lot of trouble.

324
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:00,420
We switched between multiple places but found them all unfit.

325
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:05,400
In the end, it was your master who told us about the underground palace of the former dynasty that he'd unearthed.

326
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,550
I was the one who transformed it.

327
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,540
So, Uncle Long, it was you who created the Glazed Armor lock?

328
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,890
No.

329
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:20,430
The Glazed Armor lock and key were obtained by your master and his friends

330
00:20:20,430 --> 00:20:23,100
during their travels years ago.

331
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:25,400
Their construction was absolutely ingenious.

332
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:30,550
Huaizhang spent a lot of energy assembling these objects together.

333
00:20:30,550 --> 00:20:36,490
However, when he opened the underground palace, he discovered that there really wasn't anything inside.

334
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:38,800
Therefore, he decided to give them to us.

335
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:41,980
That is how the later armory came to be.

336
00:20:41,980 --> 00:20:45,610
Get back to the main subject! How did Rong Xuan die?

337
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,460
This enigma has been spinning in my heart

338
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:51,020
all these years.

339
00:20:51,020 --> 00:20:54,720
I really don't know, at the root of it all,

340
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,930
who should be blamed for Brother Rong's tragedy.

341
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:03,450
We've set the terms. One match determines the winner and loser. If you lose,

342
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:06,380
stop arguing with me from now on.

343
00:21:06,380 --> 00:21:11,170
Eldest Brother Rong, if you lose, you better not renege!

344
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:13,430
Eldest Brother Rong, excuse me.

345
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:18,290
Brother Rong, are you really going to fight us one-against-five? Don't you think that's a little too arrogant?

346
00:21:18,290 --> 00:21:21,180
Defeating all five of you at once saves me so much trouble.

347
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,640
If you can't defeat me even when it's one-against-five,

348
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:28,090
then I'd assume that in the future, you won't dare to fuss about learning a martial art that even I can't master.

349
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,490
Enough talk. Form the sword battle array!

350
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,510
Brother Rong, excuse me.

351
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:56,980
Not bad, A'Chong. You sure are ruthless enough.

352
00:21:56,980 --> 00:22:00,310
Eldest Brother Rong, stop fighting. Swords have no eyes.

353
00:22:00,310 --> 00:22:03,310
It's just a flesh wound. What's there to fear? Come on!

354
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:14,690
See? They just like to fight like this.

355
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,180
Do you admit defeat?

356
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,670
I told you that you lot wouldn't be able to defeat me.

357
00:22:44,670 --> 00:22:46,440
- I admire you, Brother Rong.
- I admit it!

358
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,450
I admit defeat wholeheartedly.

359
00:22:55,050 --> 00:22:56,370
Eldest Brother Rong!

360
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:58,030
- My husband!
- Eldest Brother Rong!

361
00:22:58,030 --> 00:22:59,250
Eldest Brother Rong.

362
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,600
My husband!

363
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,590
- Eldest Brother Rong.
- My husband.

364
00:23:01,590 --> 00:23:03,220
- Eldest Brother Rong.
- Brother Rong.

365
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:07,200
My husband! My husband!

366
00:23:09,590 --> 00:23:11,680
It's... Three Corpse Poison.

367
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,810
What?

368
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:16,660
How could there be Three Corpse Poison?

369
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:18,840
What?

370
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:23,120
Who? Who did this?

371
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,350
Who was it?

372
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:26,640
Who wanted to harm my husband?

373
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Gao Chong, it's you?

374
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,950
Why did you harm my husband?

375
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:38,120
What did I do?

376
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:41,540
Then, why is my husband's blood on your sword?

377
00:23:43,850 --> 00:23:46,640
What nonsense are you saying? It wasn't me!

378
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:50,190
Eldest Brother Gao, why did you do it?

379
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,670
- Why did you do such a thing?
- Eldest Brother Gao.

380
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:56,950
It wasn't me. It wasn't me!

381
00:23:56,950 --> 00:23:59,940
How could I, Gao Chong, do such a thing?

382
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:06,000
Master Long, so they were really just competing in martial arts?

383
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,690
They weren't fighting a battle for life and death?

384
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:11,910
At the time, our friendship was sincere.

385
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:14,510
Why would there be a battle for life and death?

386
00:24:14,510 --> 00:24:16,300
Then, was it Gao Chong who poisoned him?

387
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:20,370
I have asked myself this question thousands of times.

388
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:25,330
I absolutely do not believe that Gao Chong would purposely harm Brother Rong.

389
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:29,050
He had no reason to do so.

390
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,500
Uncle Long, please excuse me for being bold.

391
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,560
Gao Chong did in fact have a reason to poison him.

392
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,940
Didn't he always covet the Combined Six Cultivation Method?

393
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:41,770
But no one obtained the Combined Six Cultivation Method.

394
00:24:41,770 --> 00:24:46,230
After Brother Rong was poisoned, Madam Rong hated all five of them.

395
00:24:46,230 --> 00:24:48,490
She expelled them all.

396
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,040
The armory needs all six people

397
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:54,470
assembled together to be opened.

398
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,930
- Six people?
- Yes.

399
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:58,330
The five of them divided and kept the Glazed Armor.

400
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:01,600
Brother Rong kept the key himself.

401
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:04,040
After they fell out,

402
00:25:04,040 --> 00:25:09,380
the armory was never opened again.

403
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,190
Ever since then, the Combined Six Cultivation Method

404
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:14,990
has remained in the armory.

405
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,600
Even if you discounted friendship ties,

406
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,600
why would Gao Chong harm him for no reason?

407
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:26,260
If it wasn't him, then who was it?

408
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:30,140
Old Wen, what's wrong?

409
00:25:32,810 --> 00:25:33,960
Old Wen!

410
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:36,610
The Three Corpse Poison only turns people into living corpses.

411
00:25:36,610 --> 00:25:39,280
Then, who ultimately drove Rong Xuan crazy?

412
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:43,370
Just say it! Even if it's the Heavenly King himself

413
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,590
or the Jade Emperor, I will not spare him!

414
00:25:45,590 --> 00:25:49,620
If you must assign guilt, it was Madam Rong.

415
00:25:49,620 --> 00:25:50,920
How could that be?

416
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:54,450
My father said Madam Rong was a very good person.

417
00:25:54,450 --> 00:25:56,210
She and Master Rong were deeply in love.

418
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,120
Yes. It is precisely because they were in love that in order to save her loved one,

419
00:26:02,120 --> 00:26:05,710
Madam Rong did not hesitate to use a forbidden technique.

420
00:26:05,710 --> 00:26:10,340
This act in defiance of the natural order resulted in disaster.

421
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:12,490
The Yin Yang Book?

422
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:17,150
The Yin Yang Book can save even those with poison in their heart meridians?

423
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,810
- Then what about those with withered meridians?
- He...

424
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:25,160
- has always remembered.
- If the Yin Yang Book really had such a miraculous effect,

425
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:29,010
why would the Miraculous Healer Valley not use it to save people?

426
00:26:29,010 --> 00:26:32,260
Instead, they sealed it as a forbidden book.

427
00:26:32,260 --> 00:26:36,320
The so-called revival of the dead and reversal of yin and yang

428
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,460
is accomplished through the exchange of one life for another.

429
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:41,740
In order to mend one person's heart meridians,

430
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:47,310
you must dig out a heart from another living person.

431
00:27:05,950 --> 00:27:09,640
Who knew that afterward, Brother Rong would go crazy,

432
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,780
getting worse and worse?

433
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:15,860
He even lost control and killed his own wife.

434
00:27:15,860 --> 00:27:17,640
Impossible!

435
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:20,210
Rong Xuan killed his own wife?

436
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:24,680
If Brother Rong had not made such a terrible mistake,

437
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:27,450
and in his deep remorse,

438
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:30,590
lose the last shred of his true self,

439
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:33,450
he would not have, from then on,

440
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:36,090
completely deviated into madness

441
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:41,220
and been pursued to death by all the heroes of the world.

442
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:44,400
What about Yue Feng'er's junior brothers and sisters? Why didn't they stop them?

443
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,160
The Yin Yang Book is a forbidden book of the Miracle Healer Valley.

444
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:53,660
Since Madam Rong used it without authorization, she could never go back to the Miracle Healer Valley.

445
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:57,070
The divine physician couple went back to her sect on her behalf

446
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,490
to search for a permanent cure.

447
00:27:59,490 --> 00:28:04,870
The key to the armory was then given to the Zhen couple and brought back to the Miracle Healer Valley.

448
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:08,810
The divine will fools all. When the tragedy was relayed

449
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:14,330
to Ruyu's ears, the battle on Mount Qingya

450
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:16,820
was only a few days away.

451
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:19,960
He rode his horse at top speed without rest

452
00:28:19,960 --> 00:28:22,340
and only barely made it.

453
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:26,780
[Mount Qingya]

454
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,940
Who's there?

455
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,740
Come at me!

456
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,770
Wait.

457
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:59,380
I'll kill you! I'll kill you!

458
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,290
Eldest Brother!

459
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:10,800
Eldest Brother Rong!

460
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,600
- Don't!
- Eldest Brother Rong!

461
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:13,700
Eldest Brother!

462
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:17,160
Don't... Don't!

463
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:20,410
Everyone! Everyone!

464
00:29:20,410 --> 00:29:24,600
- Kill him! Why won't you kill him?
- I am Zhen Ruyu from Miracle Healer Valley.

465
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:28,280
I can be considered to be acquainted with everyone here.

466
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,410
Miracle Healer Valley is dedicated to saving lives.

467
00:29:30,410 --> 00:29:32,650
We have accumulated many good deeds throughout our existence.

468
00:29:32,650 --> 00:29:35,250
How many of your family and friends

469
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:37,600
have received healing from Miracle Healer Valley and me?

470
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,480
Today, in consideration of this little bit of fate interconnected between us,

471
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,670
please listen to my words.

472
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,530
Regarding grudges, it is better to settle them now than to keep them alive.

473
00:29:48,530 --> 00:29:50,050
Brother Rong Xuan is going mad and becoming a demon

474
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,870
due to hidden circumstances. It is not in his nature!

475
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,210
Don't speak shamelessly!

476
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,740
Right! Why should we believe you?

477
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:58,100
Everyone, quiet down! Please quiet down!

478
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:02,830
The mistake has already been made. What is the point of continuing with needless revenge?

479
00:30:02,830 --> 00:30:06,850
I am willing to use the rest of my life to repent for Eldest Brother Rong's mistakes.

480
00:30:06,850 --> 00:30:09,240
If he has killed anyone from any sect,

481
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:11,110
I will repent by saving another hundred people.

482
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:14,130
I will also bring Eldest Brother Rong back to Miracle Healer Valley to recuperate from his injuries.

483
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:17,060
I will never let him come out to cause trouble again!

484
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:20,010
What is going on?

485
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:32,250
In the fight at Mount Qingya,

486
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:35,860
everyone used the reason of hunting down a demon

487
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:37,910
to chase after Rong Xuan and kill him.

488
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:41,120
It is most likely that they did so for the armory key.

489
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,600
Unfortunately, they still found nothing after Elder Rong's death.

490
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:49,420
So they went after Elder Zhen instead.

491
00:30:49,420 --> 00:30:52,060
Even if they had to go against their relationship with Miracle Healer Valley,

492
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,970
they forced Elder Zhen to surrender.

493
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:56,870
While wanting to protect his family and maintain righteousness,

494
00:30:56,870 --> 00:31:00,440
Brother Zhen would rather die than give away the secret of the armory.

495
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,880
These so-called righteous sects

496
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:06,140
used the excuse of good and evil being at odds

497
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,300
to force the old valley master to destroy his kin in place of righteousness.

498
00:31:09,300 --> 00:31:11,540
They just wanted to use Miracle Healer Valley

499
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:14,990
to threaten the Zhen couple into surrendering.

500
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:19,260
In the martial arts world, it is said that the Miracle Healer Valley's Zhen couple

501
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:22,090
defected and colluded with bandits.

502
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,490
Their skills were personally vanquished by the old valley master.

503
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:26,970
They were then kicked out of the sect.

504
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:30,180
Following that, the old valley master also died.

505
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:34,570
From then on, the famous Miracle Healer Valley started to decline.

506
00:31:34,570 --> 00:31:39,500
It turns out that this was the real story.

507
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:41,220
Defected?

508
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:45,490
The divine hand of Zhen Ruyu saved countless numbers of injured and dying people.

509
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:47,670
In the vast martial arts world,

510
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,210
who could stand in front of my Brother Zhen

511
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:53,060
and dare to claim to be more noble?

512
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,790
It was because he was too noble

513
00:31:55,790 --> 00:31:57,620
that his heart was too innocent.

514
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,050
That's why this filthy world could not keep him.

515
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:02,780
When this news reached

516
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:05,600
the Dragon Pool Cabinet,

517
00:32:05,600 --> 00:32:10,090
Madam Zhen had already taken her crippled husband and young child

518
00:32:10,090 --> 00:32:13,200
and vanished.

519
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,170
So, Uncle Long.

520
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:20,850
there is a rumor in the martial arts world that the Dragon Pool Cabinet has another way of opening the armory.

521
00:32:20,850 --> 00:32:23,370
Was this news spread by you?

522
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:31,000
You were afraid that the thieving intentions in the martial arts world would not be settled

523
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,270
and that they would continue targetting the Zhen family,

524
00:32:33,270 --> 00:32:37,270
and that's why you pooled all the troubles upon yourself.

525
00:32:37,920 --> 00:32:40,690
You sacrificed the Dragon Pool Pavilion's thriving business

526
00:32:40,690 --> 00:32:43,960
and moved it to this place.

527
00:32:43,960 --> 00:32:46,760
This is why today, you continue to suffer like this.

528
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:51,310
It is like mending the pen after the sheep have run away.

529
00:32:51,310 --> 00:32:53,970
It was a solution that was the result of a lack of solution.

530
00:32:53,970 --> 00:32:58,970
Other than this, there was nothing else I could have done for everyone.

531
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:03,080
Brother Zhen and the rest of them never contacted me again.

532
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,530
I tried to find them but was unable to.

533
00:33:05,530 --> 00:33:09,050
I only hoped that their family would hide away properly

534
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:13,050
and continue to live good lives that would never get entangled

535
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:16,250
with the turmoil in the martial arts world again.

536
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:22,330
Uncle Long, for the sake of your friend, you didn't hesitate

537
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:26,210
to bring yourself into this state. Your faith and loyalty,

538
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:29,120
if compared to that of Zuo and Yang,
(T/N: Zuo and Yang are famous for their friendship where they were willing to give their lives for each other.)

539
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:31,550
could not be considered as lacking.

540
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:39,760
To have a friend like you in their lives,

541
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:42,660
even in the underworld,

542
00:33:43,290 --> 00:33:45,550
they will have no regrets.

543
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,660
Elder Ye,

544
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:52,490
I didn't hide the truth from you on purpose.

545
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:57,460
I was also unable to confirm the location of the key.

546
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:59,790
Even though I had already promised Brother Rong

547
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,660
to give the key to the armory back to you,

548
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:07,290
I was still unable to because I had the motivation but not the strength.

549
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:11,990
I hope Elder will forgive me.

550
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:15,200
When did I ask for your apology?

551
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:18,620
Rong Xuan was a fool. So are you!

552
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:21,990
What armory?

553
00:34:21,990 --> 00:34:25,290
What key?

554
00:34:25,290 --> 00:34:26,910
You think I need those?

555
00:34:26,910 --> 00:34:31,500
Elder, your martial arts skills are astounding.

556
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:35,110
Naturally, you would look down on the armory.

557
00:34:35,110 --> 00:34:40,750
This is just a regret that Brother Rong had in his heart.

558
00:34:41,890 --> 00:34:45,540
Long, you are a good person.

559
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:49,380
It was Rong Xuan who burdened you. If you have a wish, please speak it.

560
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,710
I will definitely accomplish it for you.

561
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:54,660
What wish could I have?

562
00:34:54,660 --> 00:35:00,370
I owe too many things in life. I can only repay through death.

563
00:35:00,370 --> 00:35:04,340
It's just that I have a suspicion that I have never solved.

564
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:09,540
Brother Rong was a gifted talent and you are his teacher.

565
00:35:09,540 --> 00:35:13,280
Since you already mastered Combined Six Divine Method,

566
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,460
why didn't you teach him?

567
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,020
It was wrong of Brother Rong to steal the book and leave,

568
00:35:20,020 --> 00:35:23,560
but it is not difficult to understand.

569
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,090
Furthermore, Brother Rong was a martial arts addict for all of his life.

570
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:30,150
How could any martial artist resist

571
00:35:30,150 --> 00:35:33,900
the lure of being one with the sky?

572
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:40,150
One with the sky?

573
00:35:40,650 --> 00:35:44,120
In the end, it is still impossible for mortals to escape the trickery of the heavens.

574
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:49,340
It is cold and lonely on Changming Mountain.

575
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:54,010
In order to keep him happy, I taught him all of my skills.

576
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:57,100
I only prevented him from learning Combined Six Cultivation Method.

577
00:35:57,680 --> 00:36:01,350
The little beast threw many tantrums at me.

578
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:05,390
Then, he stole the secret manual and left the mountain.

579
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:09,560
Heaven-crippling, Earth-breaking Combined Six Cultivation Method.

580
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:12,960
This demonic art had such a name.

581
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,050
Within it, there is a hidden meaning for its successors.

582
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:22,950
If it was really a good thing, how could I not have given it to him?

583
00:36:23,970 --> 00:36:28,050
Back then, his father and I spoiled him too much.

584
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:32,120
The little beast probably thought it was not anything serious.

585
00:36:32,120 --> 00:36:35,460
A few years later, when our anger had receded,

586
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,080
he could've just returned.

587
00:36:38,080 --> 00:36:43,070
At the start, that was how we thought as well.

588
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:48,130
But who would have known...

589
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,330
"If it was really a good thing,

590
00:36:51,330 --> 00:36:55,310
how could I not have given it to him?"

591
00:36:58,820 --> 00:37:01,360
Speaking of this Combined Six Cultivation Method.

592
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:04,700
Even if all the secret manuals of other martial skills were displayed in front of me,

593
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:06,370
I would still—

594
00:37:10,060 --> 00:37:12,260
Forget it. I won't speak of it.

595
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:18,060
I only regret that back then,

596
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,040
I didn't destroy this Combined Six Cultivation Method.

597
00:37:21,990 --> 00:37:23,860
Elder!

598
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:05,700
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

599
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:12,830
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

600
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:19,930
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

601
00:38:19,930 --> 00:38:28,530
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

602
00:38:28,530 --> 00:38:35,520
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

603
00:38:35,520 --> 00:38:42,990
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

604
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,880
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

605
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,470
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

606
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:58,400
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

607
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:01,870
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

608
00:39:01,870 --> 00:39:05,560
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

609
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:13,600
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

610
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:16,940
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

611
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:20,830
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

612
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:27,790
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

613
00:39:27,790 --> 00:39:36,630
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
