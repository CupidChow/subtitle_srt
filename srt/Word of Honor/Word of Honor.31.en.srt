[Episode 31]

23
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,910
My King, the two ghosts have been waiting outside for a long time.

24
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:05,790
Should I invite them in?

25
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:15,080
- Scorpion King.
- What are the losses?

26
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:19,320
In this battle, we lost 47 people in total.

27
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:21,770
- The injured is 3—
- Enough!

28
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:23,890
Although we did not accomplish our goal with this battle,

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,000
you still made a contribution, even if it was not meritorious.

30
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:33,040
Qianqiao, give this month's antidote

31
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,210
to everyone.

32
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,140
Yes.

33
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:40,860
Thank you for your graciousness, Scorpion King.

Hurry.

37
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:16,130
Hurry!

38
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,790
Scorpion King, look who I caught!

39
00:03:20,790 --> 00:03:22,190
Antidote?

40
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,110
I want some, too!

A'Xiang! A'Xiang!

00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,470
Xiang'er!

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,010
Scorpion King, Xiang'er is just a small slave in Ghost Valley.

44
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:37,910
What is the meaning of this?

45
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,660
Scorpion King, this girl is the only person Crazy Wen trusts.

46
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:49,020
We can definitely find out his whereabouts from her.

47
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,920
What's the hurry?

48
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,080
- Qianqiao.
- Yes, Sir.

49
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,160
Hurry and loosen Miss Amethyst Fiend's bindings.

50
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:59,900
I want to have a good chat with her.

51
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:06,770
Senior Sect Leader,

52
00:04:06,770 --> 00:04:12,330
I ask you. Do you still remember Gentle Wind Sword Sect's ancestral teachings?

53
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,350
If the sword is present, so is the person.

54
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,120
If the sword breaks, the person dies.

55
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,110
We live for justice, killing all monsters and devils.

56
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:23,760
So you do remember.

57
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,510
Then do you remember among those rules, there is one

58
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:32,270
"Gentle Wind Sword Sect disciples are forbidden from befriending people of evil, twisted practices"?

59
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:36,230
Today, in front of Master's portrait,

60
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,550
explain yourself!

61
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:45,620
What exactly happened today?

62
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,910
I befriended the Leader of Five Lakes Alliance.

63
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:00,560
He can't be counted as evil or twisted.

64
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,560
He chose to ask a tiger for its skin
(T/N: Idiom meaning, "To ask somebody to act against their interests")

65
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:08,360
to take in the Venomous Scorpions and tame the ghosts of Ghost Valley.

66
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:11,560
I cannot control them.

67
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,000
Senior Sect Leader,

68
00:05:18,910 --> 00:05:24,470
are you telling me to use these excuses to explain to our disciples?

69
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:27,020
The death of Supreme Leader Gao is bewildering

70
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:31,090
with many points of suspicion! This is obviously Zhao Jing!

71
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,000
Supreme Leader Gao...

72
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,040
gave the Glazed Armor, which he valued more than his own life, to you!

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:38,900
Yet look at you!

74
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,240
First,

75
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,550
I did not give the Glazed Armor to anyone.

76
00:05:48,550 --> 00:05:50,140
Secondly,

77
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,150
regarding today's dangers,

78
00:05:53,150 --> 00:05:56,870
do you think that if Zhao Jing and I hadn't forged an alliance long ago,

79
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,670
you would be able to resolve it, Junior Brother?

80
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,180
As Sect Leader,

81
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:10,320
my first priority is passing on our Gentle Wind Sword's teachings.

82
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,560
I am not guilty of anything.

83
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,590
If the situation has worsened to this point,

84
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:19,160
then to save our whole sect,

85
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:23,020
what does it matter if my reputation alone is ruined?

86
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:26,360
I would rather die than bend my principles!

87
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:30,320
That day, everyone accused Supreme Leader Gao of allying with Ghost Valley

88
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,080
and betraying his brothers.

89
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,870
Now it looks like

90
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,570
the person who allied with Ghost Valley is clearly Zhao Jing!

91
00:06:36,570 --> 00:06:38,120
Enough!

92
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,700
Do you believe me to be too stupid or too evil?

93
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,640
I am only pretending to comply with Zhao Jing.

94
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:50,580
I have my own plans.

95
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,720
Senior Brother, what is your plan?

96
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,920
Only by becoming the supreme leader of the martial arts world during the Heroes Conference

97
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,560
and leading everyone in destroying Ghost Valley,

98
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,340
can we have the right to speak freely.

99
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:10,110
Eldest Brother Gao died violently while falsely accused.

100
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,510
I will do justice by him.

101
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:16,810
But what good are these few stones?

102
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,970
If you deem me trustworthy,

103
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,660
then continue on with me.

104
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,840
I believe you, Senior Brother!

105
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,920
I know you didn't do it.

106
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:31,790
Earlier, I was wrong about you.

107
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:46,890
Open the door!

108
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:02,440
Forgive me.

109
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,780
My Lord, we're late.

110
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,730
Qingming?

111
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,190
Be careful! Protect the lord!

112
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,330
The great Window of Heaven Leader

113
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:59,610
was so powerful and deadly before.

114
00:09:00,410 --> 00:09:04,270
In the end, you need to be saved by some junior disciples

115
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,680
and flee in panic.

116
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:13,260
Without the Prince's favor, who do you think you are?

117
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,250
You. What's your name again?

118
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:22,830
Old Bi's disciple. Right?

119
00:09:25,630 --> 00:09:26,920
My name's Bi Qingming!

120
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,370
Old Bi was stupid enough.

121
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:34,720
Who would've thought the little bastards he taught are idiotic beyond belief!

122
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,000
Did you really think with your collaboration,

123
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:42,490
you could just escape from Heaven's Prison with such a major criminal?

124
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:44,870
Stupid beyond belief!

125
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,830
You are all disciples of old members of Window of Heaven.

126
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:51,300
Every single one of you has several pairs of eyes monitoring you!

127
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:55,500
From the day you planned the prison break, I was already aware.

128
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,640
However, you were all completely oblivious!

129
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:03,740
Do your dead masters know that you are all so useless?

130
00:10:03,740 --> 00:10:06,030
However, I still must thank you

131
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,380
for escaping with Lord Zhou.

132
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,490
Blades are without eyes.
(T/N: Anything can happen in a battle)

133
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,970
If during the pursuit of the criminal,

134
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,640
I accidentally kill Lord Zhou...

135
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:22,370
that wouldn't count as going against the prince's orders, would it?

136
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,450
I'm not useless!

137
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:27,740
My Lord, Cheng Xiu's disciple, Cheng Zichen

138
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,520
will die for you today!

139
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,850
Then I will grant your wishes!

140
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:43,000
♫ The mortal realm breaks, heaven and earth crack,
the river runs dry ♫

141

142

146

What are you standing there for? Take them and leave!

00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,100
- Leave with our other brothers first!
- Yes.

148
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,000
Brothers!

149
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,500
Let's go!

150
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,980
And who might you be?

151
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:39,100
Wen... Wen Kexing.

152
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,980
Ghost Valley Chief?

153
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,600
That was a secret.

154
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Calling me out so publicly like that makes things hard for me.

155
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Valley Chief Wen, you came just in time.

156
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,200
Even if you hadn't come, I would still pay a visit to Ghost Valley

157
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,900
and ask to take something from you.

158
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,200
Did I hear the wrong thing? I didn't take your life,

159
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,800
yet you dare ask me for something?

160
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:11,990
Chief Wen, stop pretending.

161
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,840
You've remained passive for too long.

162
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,600
You don't know your own limits.

163
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:20,200
How dare you enter Jinzhou and rescue a dangerous criminal by yourself?

164
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,000
What sort of place do you think Window of Heaven is?

165
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Your whereabouts are exposed.

166
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:29,200
The great army will be here soon. No matter how skilled you are in martial arts,

167
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,800
you are still alone.

168
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:34,700
Who says he's alone?

169
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,800
Where's Chengling?

170
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,400
I have already escorted him to a safe place. Don't worry!

171
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,470
Then, we brothers

172
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:58,000
can give it our all.

173
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,800
Wen Kexing, what tricks are you playing?

174
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,300
You already know to address me as Valley Chief.

175
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,800
As the head of 3,000 ghosts,

176
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,100
how could I do something so unsightly as rescuing someone alone?

177
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,000
Kill!

178
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,700
Retreat!

179
00:13:47,800 --> 00:13:50,000
Chief!

180
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,700
I, Bi Qingming, greet My Lord!

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,600
I, Cheng Zichen, greet My Lord!

182
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,600
Greetings, My Lord!

183
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:16,200
Senior, before Brother Han died,

184
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,600
he asked me to take care of these children.

185
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,200
I took initiative and took them in,

186
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,800
listing them under Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

187
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:29,700
This was Brother Han's life's wish and mine as well.

188
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,700
Unfaithful Second disciple of Four Seasons Mountain Villa, Wen Kexing.

189
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:40,200
Greets My Lord!

190
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:06,000
[Saijun Mansion]

191
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,600
A'Xiang! They're back!

192
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,400
Master!

193
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:11,400
We're here.

194
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,600
Master! Old Sick Ghoul! This is great!

195
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,600
Master, you're not injured, right?

196
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:25,920
Who can harm me?

197
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:29,000
How did you get here?

198
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,800
It's a long story. I'll tell you later.

199
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:34,500
Old Sick Ghoul, why did that bastard Prince injure you so badly?

200
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:38,000
Just you wait! Later, Master and I will take revenge for you!

201
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,300
With your martial arts?

202
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:44,600
Beiyuan?

203
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:47,320
Zishu, it's been a while.

204
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:49,200
I hope you have been well.

205
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,810
Sir Wen, don't worry.

206
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,200
Although these Nails of Seven Orifices and Three Autumns are worrying,

207
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,490
but it's not completely without a solution.

208
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:09,000
Zishu has experienced many dangers,

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,600
so I am sure he will be fortunate this time as well.

210
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Lord Seventh, as long as you can heal A'Xu's injuries, I

211
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:21,800
will do everything I can in this lifetime to repay your favor.

212
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:26,000
We don't need to speak of that. Zishu and I have been friends since we were young.

213
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
But after he grew up, he became cold and distant.

214
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,000
Even if he had difficulties, he would never ask me for anything. He doesn't treat me like a friend.

215
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,400
Lord Seventh, you and A'Xu knew each other before?

216
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,100
That's right.

217
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:45,000
Looking at it now, it seems so long ago, as if it were events from a past life.

218
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,000
Sir Wen! The brothers are all gathered.

219
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,800
Sir Wen.

220
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:58,400
Lord Seventh, the children I brought are all disciples of my Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

221
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:02,100
Before the villa is rebuilt, I'm afraid we'll have to keep disturbing you here.

222
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:05,300
Sir Wen, Great Shaman and I can live as we do now

223
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,600
all because of Zishu.

224
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:11,000
If you remain so polite, I will be truly angry.

225
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,600
I, Bi Qingming, greet Lord Seventh.

226
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:15,600
Who are you to Bi Changfeng?

227
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,000
That was my master. I had the fortune of receiving my name from my master.

228
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,600
Very good.

229
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,400
Right. Speaking of this, my warrior A'Qin Lai has news.

230
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:30,400
He has safely escorted Chengling to Mount Dagu Sect's Leader Shen Shen.

231
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:34,600
Now that Zishu has been rescued safely, should we call him back?

232
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,000
Great Shaman, how is it? Can you save him?

233
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,200
Let me do it. I'm used to taking care of Master.

234
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,400
It's fine. I'll do it.

235
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:19,200
Let me!

236
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:28,400
That child. Why is he so obedient?

237
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,600
Right, My Lord. We haven't reported to you yet.

238
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:33,800
This time, it's all thanks to Sir Wen. He used the marks left by Brother Han

239
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,900
to contact us. He planned everything and led all of us.

240
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,200
What are you calling us?

241
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,200
You should call us Master and Junior Master.

242
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Greetings—

243
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:44,800
There's no hurry.

244
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,600
Wait for your elder brother, and then formally undergo the ceremony.

245
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,800
Old Wen.

246
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:56,000
All of these 19 children have joined my sect.

247
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,600
Won't you split the burden with me?

248
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:01,700
No problem, Lord Zhou.

249
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,000
You can go outside, first.

250
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,400
Yes.

251
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,530
Let's go.

252
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:21,800
A'Xu, why weren't you surprised at all

253
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:23,600
when you saw me after leaving the prison?

254
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:26,700
I was looking forward to your expression.

255
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,200
What was there to be surprised about?

256
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:33,400
I didn't know when you would come

257
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,200
or how you would come,

258
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,600
but I knew that you would definitely come.

259
00:19:55,600 --> 00:20:00,800
I see. So you and your lover were going to elope?

260
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,200
That's right.

261
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,400
Little girl, why do you look so proud about it?

262
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,500
Of course!

263
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,400
Since I was able to take Eldest Brother Cao with me, it meant that his feelings for me

264
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,000
are more important than any stupid martial arts world rule!

265
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
Of course, I'm happy!

266
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,100
Well said! Lady A'Xiang loves and hates courageously.

267
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,200
You are similar to our Nanjiang girls!

268
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,800
That's right. She's the same as your Nanjiang people,

269
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:25,000
skilled at leading away children from good families.

270
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Right, little A'Xiang. Tell me how you two eloped.

271
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,500
That's a spectacular story!

272
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:40,600
A'Xiang! A'Xiang!

273
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:46,200
A'Xiang, why didn't you light a candle?

274
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,200
I forgot to.

275
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,800
How was it? What is going on?

276
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:59,900
I still don't understand. It felt like it was all a nightmare.

277
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:05,300
Master allied with Five Lakes Alliance.

278
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,800
W-Wait,

279
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,000
then what's up with those Drug Men?

280
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,300
Since they're allied, why did they come to attack Gentle Wind Mountain?

281
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Did you see the one wearing a black robe?

282
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:19,800
He's the Black Changing Ghost! Why would people from Ghost Valley be here as well?

283
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,800
Alliance Leader Zhao came to an agreement with the seven large sects.

284
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,620
They are reopening the Heroes Conference.

285
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,100
Those evil ghosts have changed sides

286
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,800
They're under Alliance Leader Zhao now.

287
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,200
Impossible!

288
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,000
It's not a surprise that Black Changing Ghost switched sides,

289
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,800
but Sister Qianqiao would never betray Master!

290
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,200
You don't know? Sister Qianqiao is the Alluring Ghost!

291
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,800
Don't listen to Zhao Jing's nonsense! He isn't a good person!

292
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:46,000
A'Xiang... this

293
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,100
was something Junior Master told me. I could only listen.

294
00:21:52,710 --> 00:21:56,400
A'Xiang, I don't understand

295
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,440
and don't want to dig too deep.

296
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,050
Junior Master says Master plans far ahead.

297
00:22:06,050 --> 00:22:08,700
He won't let me interrogate too far.

298
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:13,060
But... even without asking, I understand.

299
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:18,920
This isn't right. This isn't right! It isn't right!

300
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:21,330
Eldest Brother Cao, what's wrong?

301
00:22:23,370 --> 00:22:25,590
I'm just...

302
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,150
A'Xiang,

303
00:22:28,210 --> 00:22:30,020
we said earlier

304
00:22:30,020 --> 00:22:33,250
that if Master and Junior Master didn't accept our marriage,

305
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,260
we would elope.

306
00:22:35,950 --> 00:22:38,170
You're serious?

307
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:42,970
Let's elope.

308
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,100
I won't be this righteous man.

309
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:48,920
You aren't evil! Let's leave.

310
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,570
I can't understand, and I don't want to understand!

311
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:53,370
Let's leave the martial arts world

312
00:22:53,370 --> 00:22:56,300
and open a sweets shop or a rouge shop!

313
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,610
We can raise cows, farm, or do anything!

314
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,440
What do you say?

315
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:03,040
Okay.

316
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,410
Just like that! We eloped! Isn't that exciting?

317
00:23:10,220 --> 00:23:12,070
It is indeed incredibly exciting.

318
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,510
Young Brother Cao is clear-minded and a true man.

319
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:18,210
You married the correct man.

320
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:22,640
Wait. I don't understand yet.

321
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,770
That Zhao Jing was already allied with Mo Huaiyang of Gentle Wind Sect early on?

322
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,020
That's right. But he kept it a secret

323
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,020
and never told his adopted son, Scorpion King.

324
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,130
Scorpion King did all that for nothing.

325
00:23:34,130 --> 00:23:36,170
He'd naturally be enraged.

326
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,470
That's not right, A'Xiang.

327
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,040
Since you two have decided to elope,

328
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:45,250
why did you run into Ghost Valley people and how did you come to find us?

329
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,310
What's wrong?

330
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:50,560
Please forgive us, Lord Seventh.

331
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:54,030
This is something Sir Wen won't allow A'Xiang to say.

332
00:23:54,030 --> 00:23:57,170
If she tells, he'll chop off her tongue.

333
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:00,160
All right. That's fine then.

334
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,620
If you can't, then don't.

335
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,720
It's good that you found Sir Wen in time.

336
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:08,370
Otherwise, it would have been up to us to risk our lives.

337
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:17,220
But, A'Xiang, does Brother Wen have to return to Ghost Valley?

338
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,150
He finally reunited with Brother Zhou.

339
00:24:19,150 --> 00:24:23,560
He'll go back to Ghost Valley to remove his chief position and settle Aunt Luo and the others down. Then, he'll come back.

340
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,920
However, the Exorcism Conference is about to begin.

341
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,540
All the warriors will go to Qingya Mountain.

342
00:24:30,650 --> 00:24:33,560
Exorcise if they want to. I only care about my sisters in the Department of the Unfaithful.

343
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:36,970
There's nothing good in Ghost Valley anyways. Who cares if they die.

344
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:45,360
All right. Then I hope everything goes smoothly.

345
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:55,340
How did that stupid girl fold it normally?

346
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,240
You came just in time.

347
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:13,880
What's wrong?

348
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:15,960
Why do you seem unhappy?

349
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,750
Master, I'm still worried.

350
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:22,660
Don't go back to Ghost Valley, all right?

351
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:25,240
We should just take care of the sisters from the Department of Unfaithful.

352
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:27,160
We can let all the other ghosts run back themselves.

353
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:29,460
They're traitors anyways, so who cares if they die?

354
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:31,400
Childish words.

355
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:34,520
Don't worry. I'll leave and return quickly.

356
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:36,050
All you have to do is help me take care of A'Xu.

357
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:39,580
Master, you can't hide it from me. I'm not stupid.

358
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,410
I brought Scorpion King to see you back then

359
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:44,490
because I knew you could subdue him.

360
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:46,360
If you were harmed because of this,

361
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:50,570
I-I wouldn't be able to forgive myself for the rest of my life.

362
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,860
Also, I saw with my own eyes!

363
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,970
Those stupid ghosts got controlled by the Scorpion King's secret poison.

364
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:57,120
They are as obedient as dogs!

365
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,210
After you and Scorpion King spoke in secret,

366
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:01,650
why did they come back and listen to you again?

367
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:04,350
No matter how much that Scorpion King hates Zhao Jing,

368
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:07,730
it's still unreasonable for him to help the enemy!

369
00:26:07,730 --> 00:26:11,970
You've even learned the phrase, "help the enemy"?

370
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:16,450
You've become more and more cultured after being with Young Cao.

371
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:20,360
Master, don't change the subject!

372
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,100
Eldest Brother Cao said

373
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,810
you are... asking...

374
00:26:24,810 --> 00:26:27,300
you are asking the tiger to... what is it...

375
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:31,030
you are asking a tiger for its skin!

376
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:35,270
I know you were capable of doing anything to rescue Zhou Xu,

377
00:26:35,270 --> 00:26:39,180
but, Master, you have to tell me what you promised him!

378
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,790
I told you before.

379
00:26:43,790 --> 00:26:45,900
The matter of me scheming with Scorpion King

380
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:49,350
cannot be brought up to anyone. Especially A'Xu.

381
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,420
I didn't say anything.

382
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:55,250
I just think I should also know what it is.

383
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:59,910
Master, I'm really worried about you!

384
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,960
Stupid girl, the reason Scorpion King is so cooperative

385
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:07,200
is because he is getting something in return. I will tell you more

386
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,690
about this matter in the future.

387
00:27:09,690 --> 00:27:11,620
Right now, our priority

388
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:14,580
is to make sure A'Xu heals quickly.

389
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:17,250
Don't worry. Great Shaman said

390
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:20,490
once A'Xu's body returns to its best state,

391
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,370
we will still need someone highly skilled to be present

392
00:27:22,370 --> 00:27:24,200
in order to perform the art of removing his nails.

393
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,600
Before that, I will naturally come back.

394
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:32,880
If you say so, then it's fine.

395
00:27:32,890 --> 00:27:35,700
That's right. You can abandon me hundreds of times

396
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,310
but wouldn't do that for that old sick ghoul!

397
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,010
You're jealous of a grown man?

398
00:27:41,010 --> 00:27:44,200
No, you're jealous because of me?

399
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,450
Why don't you get jealous because of your young Cao?

400
00:27:46,450 --> 00:27:49,270
He wouldn't make me jealous!

401
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:55,520
Master, you must come back safely.

402
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,960
Have some confidence in your master, okay?

403
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:05,930
Even if I was really was asking a tiger for its skin,

404
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,670
do you really think I wouldn't be able to beat that Scorpion King?

405
00:28:10,590 --> 00:28:12,640
Who is the tiger

406
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,920
and who is the hunter. Who knows?

407
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:47,020
The Ghost Valley Chief is back! All evil will recede!

408
00:28:47,020 --> 00:28:49,860
All ghosts return to position!

409
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,990
Yes!

410
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,580
Welcome back, Chief.

411
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:36,100
Forgive me for my lack of manners.

412
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,820
But your palace

413
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,190
only has this one chair.

414
00:29:44,610 --> 00:29:46,960
If you like it,

415
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:51,070
I will give you this position of Ghost Valley Chief.

416
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:54,510
What harm is that?

417
00:29:56,550 --> 00:29:58,490
There is no need.

418
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,700
I personally believe

419
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,590
I do not have such great abilities.

420
00:30:05,870 --> 00:30:07,720
This position

421
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,790
must still be taken up by you personally.

422
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,640
Brother Chengling!

423
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:38,080
That's enough!

424
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:40,050
Stop practicing!

425
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:47,300
Brother Chengling! Martial arts can't be mastered overnight!

426
00:30:47,300 --> 00:30:50,830
I know you're frustrated but speed isn't everything!

427
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:54,700
If you keep practicing day and night like this, it might not be good for your improvement!

428
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,920
Chengling!

429
00:30:59,650 --> 00:31:01,120
Uncle Shen!

430
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,780
Persuade Chengling too, okay?

431
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,770
Uncle Shen...

432
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:15,920
[To Shen Shen: Sect Leader of Mount Dagu Sect]

433
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,860
Exorcise devils to purify the mountain and rivers.

434
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:29,610
The Exorcism Conference is set?

435
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:31,810
What Eldest Brother couldn't do,

436
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:34,620
we will finally have the chance to do.

437
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:40,580
White Deer Village...

438
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:42,800
This name sounds

439
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,620
very familiar!

440
00:31:44,620 --> 00:31:48,560
White Deer Village is outside Mount Qingya.

441
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,600
Ghost Valley's first chief, Devil Swordsmith, Rong Changqing,

442
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,190
is buried at White Deer Village.

443
00:31:54,190 --> 00:31:57,530
The meeting is set there to also use this chance

444
00:31:57,530 --> 00:31:59,650
to completely destroy Ghost Valley.

445
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:04,410
Uncle Shen, you are also going?

446
00:32:09,510 --> 00:32:11,980
I wanted to ask you two.

447
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:15,390
If it were up to me, I wouldn't want to join this mess.

448
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:18,060
I just want to abide by Eldest Brother's and Fourth Brother's wishes

449
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,550
and watch you two grow up and succeed.

450
00:32:21,550 --> 00:32:23,300
However, Chengling,

451
00:32:24,490 --> 00:32:29,070
although I do not know what part Zhou Zishu played in this,

452
00:32:29,070 --> 00:32:33,470
Wen Kexing will definitely return to Ghost Valley this time.

453
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,030
What's your opinion?

454
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:03,470
Chief, please forgive me!

455
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:07,980
Who's bad side did you get on

456
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:10,460
to get sent here to take care of me as the scapegoat of others?

457
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,870
Yes, take care of...

458
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:14,340
to take care of you...

459
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,140
is my fortune.

460
00:33:16,140 --> 00:33:19,010
Enough. Get out.

461
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:20,670
Yes, Sir.

462
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,630
What are you afraid of?

463
00:33:35,180 --> 00:33:37,450
Even the fiercest evil ghost

464
00:33:38,230 --> 00:33:41,410
would also want to turn back into a human

465
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:44,880
as long as they found a way back to the martial world.

466
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:51,940
♫ The more you want to predict, the harder it is to predict ♫

467
00:33:51,940 --> 00:33:55,970
♫ Surrounded by old resentments ♫

468
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:02,240
♫ The sky is full of rain, with love and hate so minuscule ♫

469
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,630
♫ They bloom and float to and fro ♫

470
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:12,470
♫ Struggling alone yet pretending all is smooth and peaceful ♫

471
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:16,820
Aunt Luo, what's wrong?

472
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:20,370
Aren't you going to go take care of your new master?

473
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,510
A'Xing...

474
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,270
Why did you come back?

475
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:31,140
Why didn't you leave?

476
00:34:31,140 --> 00:34:32,770
Aunt Luo,

477
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:36,700
you haven't called me that in eight years.

478
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,700
Forgive me, Chief.

479
00:34:41,630 --> 00:34:44,250
I misspoke.

480
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:48,390
I know. I have no right to call you that.

481
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,650
Scorpion King has already used Drunk Life Dream Death

482
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:54,860
to cancel Water of Oblivion's effect.

483
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:59,420
Now, I remember everything.

484
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:02,730
Back then, at Miracle Healer Valley,

485
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,050
your parents

486
00:35:05,050 --> 00:35:08,770
took good care of me and talked sense into me.

487
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,560
They are not just simple doctors to me.

488
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:15,590
Their favor saved me when I most needed it.

489
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,220
But I...

490
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:23,370
I hate myself for being unable to save them.

491
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,820
Fortunately....

492
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:34,750
Fortunately, I managed to save you.

493
00:35:34,750 --> 00:35:37,610
However, I couldn't take care of you properly.

494
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:39,470
Aunt Luo.

495
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:47,300
Aunt Luo, your kindness

496
00:35:47,300 --> 00:35:48,960
is something I will always remember clearly.

497
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:50,570
I don't understand at all.

498
00:35:50,570 --> 00:35:53,620
Why did you come back to this troublesome place?

499
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:55,160
Aunt Luo,

500
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:58,220
I've remembered everything.

501
00:35:58,220 --> 00:36:02,210
I thought I successfully fought back against the effects of Water of Oblivion

502
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:06,000
and remembered everyone who harmed my parents.

503
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,910
These years,

504
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:13,330
you watched as I killed them one by one.

505
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:16,110
I'm sure you know it clearly.

506
00:36:16,110 --> 00:36:18,390
But I was wrong.

507
00:36:18,390 --> 00:36:21,190
The moment I drank Water of Oblivion,

508
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:24,020
the one thing I truly cared about

509
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,780
was how I invited a wolf into my den.

510
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:29,950
I was the one who caused the death of my parents.

511
00:36:31,450 --> 00:36:34,040
Things originally could've been another

512
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:38,020
completely different story.

513
00:36:41,150 --> 00:36:44,710
I held the position of Valley Chief for eight years.

514
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:47,670
Every day, I was on guard against enemies who wanted to kill me.

515
00:36:47,670 --> 00:36:50,830
I also schemed every day on how to kill others.

516
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:54,820
Until all my enemies were dead,

517
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:57,660
I still did not feel satisfaction from completing my revenge.

518
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,710
Instead, I felt strangely anxious

519
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:03,540
and tormented. I thought that was also hatred.

520
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:07,680
It was because I didn't take revenge against everyone that forced my parents down that dead end.

521
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,060
So I put so much effort into setting a trap.

522
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,870
An intricately interconnected trap of death.

523
00:37:21,690 --> 00:37:25,990
Aunt Luo, do you know what my original plan was?

524
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:32,820
Hanging Ghost didn't steal my Glazed Armor at all.

525
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,270
I also never had any Glazed Armor anyway.

526
00:37:35,270 --> 00:37:38,830
He had secretly been killed by me long ago.

527
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:41,240
That was only an excuse.

528
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,800
Valley Chief?

529
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,790
My plan was to re-enact the battle of Mount Qingya.

530
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:14,330
No. I wanted to burn a greater fire,

531
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:17,700
burning every dirty thing in this world!

532
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:21,190
Those supposedly righteous sects are just insatiable ghosts disguised under human skin!

533
00:38:21,190 --> 00:38:24,980
They should die together with the devils of Mount Qingya!

534
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:29,860
I allowed you all to do as you liked in the martial arts world

535
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,090
and leaked news of the Glazed Armor

536
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:34,600
all for the purpose of setting up this trap.

537
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:45,290
Once you enter Ghost Valley, the light and dark worlds are separated.

538
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:50,180
Everyone who comes to Mount Qingya coveting the Glazed Armor

539
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:53,320
should not think about leaving alive!

540
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:56,970
A'Xing, what do you mean?

541
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:58,970
Could it be...

542
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,950
Could it be that you are planning to die with them?

543
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:04,090
Since I set such an evil death trap,

544
00:39:04,090 --> 00:39:07,130
then of course I did not care much.

545
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,210
I didn't consider...

546
00:39:09,210 --> 00:39:12,290
how many innocent people would die because of this.

547
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:16,650
Because at the time, I truly thought

548
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:19,280
everyone in the world failed me,

549
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,770
so everyone is killable.

550
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,160
It was only later

551
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,680
when someone taught me the principle

552
00:39:31,680 --> 00:39:34,340
that hatred and greed are the same.

553
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:37,180
You are only creating a cage for yourself.

554
00:39:37,180 --> 00:39:40,440
My parents, and even you, Aunt Luo!

555
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:42,930
You all tried so hard to help me live

556
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:45,990
not because you wanted to bury your past selves.

557
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,450
Aunt Luo, I have already made an agreement with Scorpion King.

558
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:58,340
We will both take what we need.

559
00:39:58,340 --> 00:40:03,500
Tomorrow, I will ask him to remove the poison on you and Qianqiao's bodies.

560
00:40:03,500 --> 00:40:06,710
Take the sisters of the Department of Unfaithful and leave Ghost Valley.

561
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,750
As long as you let go of your hatred,

562
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:12,490
we are in the world of humans.

563
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:14,990
Why must we seek out danger?

564
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:23,590
Since you have decided to let go,

565
00:40:23,590 --> 00:40:26,140
I wish you well.

566
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:29,150
You have your decision,

567
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,900
and I have made my choice.

568
00:40:32,620 --> 00:40:37,140
I would rather be tormented forever

569
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,280
in this Ghost Valley.

570
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:37,440
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

571
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:44,600
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

572
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:51,580
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

573
00:41:51,580 --> 00:42:00,200
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

574
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,170
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

575
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:14,730
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

576
00:42:14,730 --> 00:42:18,540
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

577
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:22,220
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

578
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:29,200
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

579
00:42:30,030 --> 00:42:37,200
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

580
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:40,970
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,  ♫

581
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:45,160
♫ quiet life by the stream ♫

582
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:48,630
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

583
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,490
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

584
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:59,440
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

585
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:07,530
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
