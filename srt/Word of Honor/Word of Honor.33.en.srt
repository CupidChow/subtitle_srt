[Episode 33]

23
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:57,500
He also said... even if not for the alliance with the Window of Heaven,

24
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,270
for Five Lakes Alliance's reputation,

25
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,850
he would still make sure no one knows of this.

26
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:03,890
He asked me not to worry.

27
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:05,690
He...

28
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:10,470
When he said this, was it an instant reaction,

29
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,650
or was it said after a period of struggle?

30
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:16,120
Things have come to this. Why would you—

31
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,550
Why would you ask such a meaningless question?

32
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,380
It is bold of me, but I want to say that you doing this

33
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:24,450
is completely unnecessary.

34
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,730
Chi'er,

35
00:02:44,390 --> 00:02:46,880
how dare you.

36
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:50,550
I spoke out of line.

37
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,250
Please forgive me, Scorpion King.

38
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:54,750
Those upset from a lost gamble

39
00:02:56,540 --> 00:03:00,520
are always searching for excuses.

40
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:05,620
Even in their dreams, they still want to turn the tables. I cannot be any different.

41
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,690
I just want...

42
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,530
to give him another chance

43
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,600
and give myself another chance.

44
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:29,190
Whatever. Since this is the case,

45
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:33,020
I will do another unnecessary thing.

46
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,830
Qianqiao,

47
00:03:36,610 --> 00:03:38,400
take it.

48
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:41,250
This—

49
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,090
Here.

50
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:49,730
This... is the complete antidote for the slave poison.

51
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,210
There are two pills in total.

52
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,970
This is the formula for the monthly antidote.

53
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:02,910
You still don't understand?

54
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,310
Before, didn't you continuously beg me to let Yu Qiufeng go?

55
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,980
I will grant your wish.

56
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,870
Either way, whether that Mount Hua Sect youngster lives or not,

57
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,430
makes no difference.

58
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:18,280
I might as well grant you your wish.

59
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:22,200
If he is willing to let go of his Mount Hua Sect Leader position after returning

60
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,170
and leave with you,

61
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:26,420
these things

62
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:29,660
will serve as a wedding gift to you.

63
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:36,640
- Scorpion King.
- However, whether you give him the complete antidote

64
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:42,430
or to use the slave poison to control him for life,

65
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,210
is a decision I will let you make.

66
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:50,370
Your life is too bitter.

67
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,000
I can't watch anymore.

68
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:59,780
So I will give you a chance to choose.

69
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:03,400
You must treasure it.

70
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:09,640
Scorpion King!

71
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:45,050
Qianqiao!

72
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,310
Qianqiao,

73
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,330
have you come of your own will or did the Scorpion King send you?

74
00:05:55,990 --> 00:06:00,790
Beloved Feng, are you willing to leave with me?

75
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:06,490
He— Qianqiao,

76
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:10,450
tomorrow is the Heroes Conference. What are you saying these things for?

77
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,680
Of course, I'm completely willing to leave with you,

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,950
but we've both been poisoned by Scorpion King. Have you forgotten?

79
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:22,000
If we don't get the antidote in one month,

80
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,590
we will both die!

81
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,830
Then let's be husband and wife for one month!

82
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,290
Qianqiao!

83
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:30,960
Beloved Feng, trust me.

84
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,090
I understand how dangerous Ghost Valley's defenses are.

85
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,960
Scorpion King wants us to lead the way. This fight will be fraught with danger!

86
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:43,890
It's better if we run away. Then we can live together for one month.

87
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:48,400
Qianqiao, that's not how it is.

88
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,860
That Ghost Valley battle will certainly be dangerous,

89
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,970
but we can survive narrowly!

90
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,350
- Once we run away—
- I've made up my mind.

91
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:59,160
I am leaving tonight. Are you coming with me?

92
00:07:00,190 --> 00:07:02,430
Decide for yourself.

93
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:05,060
Qianqiao...

94
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:08,390
You can't leave, Qianqiao.

95
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:13,100
Qianqiao, if you leave, Scorpion King won't let me live.

96
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,080
So aren't I letting you choose?

97
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,670
I... I...

98
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:27,370
Enough. Don't say anymore.

99
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:29,370
I don't want to know.

100
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:36,870
Qianqiao, what is this?

101
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,720
That is the complete antidote for the slave poison.

102
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,370
Eat it, and leave White Deer Village.

103
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:47,260
The Ghost Valley is dangerous. I am not lying to you.

104
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,910
I've already treasured this fan for my whole life.
[Yu Qiufeng]

105
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,810
Now,

106
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,210
I will return it to you.

107
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:14,120
Qianqiao, is there more of this antidote?

108
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:16,280
Have you eaten it?

109
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:37,290
These words you just said

110
00:08:37,290 --> 00:08:39,840
make everything worth it.

111
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:44,430
Beloved Feng, the road is long.

112
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,720
Please take care.

113
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:49,890
Our destiny ends here.

114
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:51,660
Qianqiao, what do you mean? Qianqiao!

115
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:53,420
Qianqiao!

116
00:08:55,590 --> 00:08:58,620
What are you doing, Qianqiao? Don't!

117
00:08:59,620 --> 00:09:01,600
I want to forget you completely.

118
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,850
"The calm surface of the river

119
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,830
reflects the youthful green willows.

120
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:30,130
The flowers and moon watch over each other in the distance.

121
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,620
Year after year,

122
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,580
the scene reappears

123
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,110
after the snow melts."

124
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,460
Today, the heroes of the world have gathered as one.

125
00:09:56,460 --> 00:10:00,240
Everyone's martial arts skills are incredibly different.

126
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:03,320
We are not familiar with one another.

127
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:06,830
We must elect a leader among us

128
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:10,760
to lead everyone in the attack on Ghost Valley.

129
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,450
In terms of morality and conduct, Great Master Ci Mu

130
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:15,960
is, needless to say, a person of high moral standing and prestige.

131
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:19,990
In terms of martial arts, as the Chief of Bodhidharma Hall,

132
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:22,820
he is highly skilled. In terms of authority,

133
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:26,400
Shaolin has always been a strong pillar in the martial arts world.

134
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,800
Therefore, I recommend Master Ci Mu

135
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:32,230
to lead us in our attack against Ghost Valley.

136
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:36,550
Amitabha, thank you for your kind words.

137
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,090
However, as a monk,

138
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:45,320
it is very inappropriate for me to lead something as violent as this.

139
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:49,190
I have a candidate in mind.

140
00:10:49,950 --> 00:10:53,680
The Sect Leader of Gentle Wind Sword Sect, Mo Huaiyang.

141
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,250
He was the elected chief of the Young Heroes Conference 20 years ago.

142
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:59,590
In these 20 years, he trained secludedly

143
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:01,770
and his martial arts

144
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:03,820
must be on an inconceivable level.

145
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:07,130
Since we martial artists are choosing a supreme leader of the martial arts world,

146
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,530
we should use martial arts as the deciding factor.

147
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:16,590
Therefore, I recommend Sect Leader Mo.

148
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:24,640
Everyone, in today's election of a leader,

149
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,070
not only is morality and prestige needed,

150
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:30,820
what is even more important is that they must have the ability to be a leader.

151
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,580
The Ghost Valley is presently a thunder of dragons without a head. (T/N: a group without a leader)

152
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:38,190
But after all, they have the advantage of location and have tight defenses.

153
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:42,260
Therefore, I believe

154
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,330
this chosen leader must be good at planning and judging.

155
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:51,780
Moreover, they must possess experience in leading troops in large battles.

156
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,050
In consideration of this point,

157
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:58,570
there is no one more suitable than the Leader of Five Lakes Alliance.

158
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:00,810
Isn't that right?

159
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,770
- Yes.
- That's right.

160
00:12:03,770 --> 00:12:05,410
Sect Leader Mo, you are correct.

161
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,920
If we were to make a decision based on any other factors, other great warriors may have a chance of winning this election.

162
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:12,540
However, if we make a decision from these three points, there's no one who can be more suitable

163
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:15,960
than our Alliance Leader Zhao. Isn't that right?

164
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:19,830
That's right.

165
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:21,650
Let's elect Alliance Leader Zhao.

166
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:25,790
Furthermore, Alliance Leader Zhao said something that really addresses the point just now.

167
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:28,370
When people that train in martial arts choose a leader,

168
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,540
we should naturally use martial arts as the deciding factor.

169
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:36,370
Why don't we have the recommended candidates have a competition in front of everyone here?

170
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:40,370
The final victor will be the supreme leader of the martial arts world.

171
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:44,930
Wouldn't this be a direct and straightforward method?

172
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,750
That's right!

173
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:49,190
Compete in martial arts. Compete in martial arts!

174
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:51,770
Compete in martial arts.

175
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,990
That's right. They must compete in martial arts.

176
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:56,260
- This would be fair.
- This is logical.

177
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:59,010
Alliance Leader Zhao,

178
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,140
please.

179
00:13:34,710 --> 00:13:38,690
I am much obliged to you for showing me your brilliant moves.

180
00:13:40,530 --> 00:13:42,360
Please.

181
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:17,180
Everyone. Everyone.

182
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:22,260
I've only ever heard that Alliance Leader Zhao's moral virtue is outstanding and he is gifted at crafting strategies.

183
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:26,220
In terms of his martial arts, his are not anything special.

184
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:29,120
I wouldn't have expected the sight I am seeing today.

185
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:41,090
- Alliance Leader Zhao is certainly strong.
- Amitabha...

186
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:43,580
I never expected Alliance Leader Zhao's martial arts

187
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:46,230
to have reached such a level.

188
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:48,870
Sect Leader Mo's martial arts are stunning,

189
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:52,850
yet Alliance Leader Zhao can parry so many moves with him

190
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,750
with no clear winner.

191
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:58,190
The martial arts world certainly has all kinds of talents.

192
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:04,310
How silly!

193
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:22,000
Since ancient times, the position of the supreme leader of the martial arts world was held by one of high talent and integrity.

194
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,160
Zhao Jing! Do you have a right to stand in that arena?

195
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,300
Zhao Jing, you were the son of a servant.

196
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,300
The only son of former Sect Leader of Lake Tai Sect died unexpectedly.

197
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,650
You purposefully took Sect Leader Zhao as your father.

198
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:40,920
That is how you had the chance of becoming a member of Five Lakes Alliance's Five Sons.

199
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:44,500
Later, the five of you became good friends with Rong Xuan

200
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,920
and created the armory together.

201
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,760
Shut up!

202
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,070
How dare you!

203
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:52,690
How dare you falsely accuse our Alliance Leader Zhao here!

204
00:15:52,690 --> 00:15:55,700
Come! Capture him!

205
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:13,020
After the armory was created,

206
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:17,890
you deliberately took advantage of the situation when Rong Xuan was competing with the five sons

207
00:16:17,890 --> 00:16:20,820
and secretly wiped poison on Gao Chong's sword.

208
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,590
Gao Chong mistakenly thought he had harmed Rong Xuan

209
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:27,880
and Rong Xuan ended up going crazy and becoming obsessive for this reason.

210
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:31,790
Gao Chong could not defend himself against the accusations and lived in regret his whole life.

211
00:16:32,870 --> 00:16:36,170
The Five Sons grew scattered as well

212
00:16:36,170 --> 00:16:38,470
and lived in depression for the rest of their lives.

213
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:41,830
All of this was because of you!

214
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:46,490
Even if someone so disloyal and untrustworthy could subdue others with force,

215
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:48,730
would anyone here accept him

216
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,670
if he became the supreme leader?

217
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:06,270
- Master!
- Senior!

218
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:08,940
Master!

219
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:10,800
- Master, are you all right?
- Senior Brother!

220
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:22,400
Traitor! Using secret weapons! Despicable!

221
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,830
Zhao Jing! What else do you have to say for yourself?

222
00:17:25,830 --> 00:17:28,070
What is there to explain?

223
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:32,230
This bastard chattered nonstop when I was fighting with Sect Leader Mo!

224
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:34,350
He claimed I was disloyal!

225
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:36,460
Everyone watch clearly!

226
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:39,170
He is the Ghost Valley Chief's ally!

227
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:41,290
When we surrounded Wen Kexing,

228
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:43,630
he had risked his life to protect him!

229
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:47,690
I believe everyone saw this!

230
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:52,920
Therefore, he was the one who threw the secret weapon to harm me!

231
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:14,170
Since you have won,

232
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,360
I, Zhou Zishu, Lord of Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

233
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,300
would like to challenge Alliance Leader Zhao.

234
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:34,160
Who said Four Seasons Mountain Villa is over?

235
00:18:49,410 --> 00:18:51,420
Didn't he fall off the cliff?

236
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,350
That's right.

237
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:06,720
Senior Brother! Let me take this battle!

238
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,850
Isn't this the Ghost Valley Chief, Wen Kexing?

239
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:33,550
My name is indeed Wen Kexing.

240
00:19:33,550 --> 00:19:36,150
However, I am Wen Kexing of Four Seasons Mountain Villa.

241
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,920
We just have the same name.

242
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,750
Everyone! Have you recognized the wrong person?

243
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,580
Wen Kexing, do you take these heroes of the world for idiots?

244
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:50,330
You are even able to say such unbelievable things?

245
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,850
Everyone! Don't believe his lies!

246
00:19:56,460 --> 00:19:58,490
He is the Ghost Valley Chief!

247
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:02,310
That's right. Everyone here can see clearly.

248
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,590
This person is clearly the Ghost Chief on the Ghost Portraits Collection.

249
00:20:05,590 --> 00:20:08,130
The Ghost Portraits Collection was made by Zhao Jing.

250
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:09,860
This person is so disloyal and untrustworthy.

251
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:12,550
Is he incapable of falsely accusing someone like me?

252
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,160
Ludicrous!

253
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:17,950
Why is there the need to lie about something like this?

254
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:22,130
The three evil ghosts that betrayed you are right here.

255
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,820
Whether or not the person on the stage is the Ghost Valley Chief

256
00:20:24,820 --> 00:20:27,350
can be determined through interrogation.

257
00:20:27,350 --> 00:20:29,090
Bring them up!

258
00:20:41,090 --> 00:20:43,870
These are the ones who abandoned evil and joined the righteous side. Changing Ghost,

259
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,080
Black Changing, and Happy Ghost.

260
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:50,270
Take a look at the person on stage.

261
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:54,180
Is he your former master?

262
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:03,470
I don't know him.

263
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:10,800
As everyone knows, Ghost Valley Chief Wen Kexing has already met his death at White Deer Cliff.

264
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:13,990
His corpse is still being kept within the strongholds of Five Lakes Alliance.

265
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,120
Could it have been that Zhao Jing, the Great Warrior Zhao,

266
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,970
has been intentionally deceiving the heroes of the world?

267
00:21:19,970 --> 00:21:21,450
Scorpion.

268
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,400
You!

269
00:21:31,050 --> 00:21:33,050
My master is of Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

270
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,960
and my master is the Great Warrior Qin Huaizhang.

271
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:38,790
This is my eldest senior brother.

272
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:41,200
As for my parents...

273
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:50,210
A'Xu, let me borrow your sword.

274
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,440
I will explain the details to you later.

275
00:22:17,950 --> 00:22:23,370
May I ask? Does anyone here remember the Eighteen Moves of Qiuming?

276
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:54,390
Zhen Ruyu?

277
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,770
Zhen Ruyu of Miracle Healer Valley?

278
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,590
Eighteen Moves of Qiuming?

279
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:00,250
That's the Divine Healer, Zhen Ruyu's Qiuming Sword Style.

280
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:02,290
Who are you to Great Savior Zhen?

281
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:05,190
So you haven't forgotten him.

282
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:08,560
When he lost his life during the battle of Mount Qingya,

283
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:12,660
when he was threatened and lost his martial arts in the Miracle Healer Valley,

284
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:15,450
when he was tortured and killed by evil ghosts,

285
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:17,590
where were you all?

286
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,320
Answer me. Who is Divine Healer Zhen Ruyu to you?

287
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:28,180
He is my father.

288
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,760
Nonsense!

289
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,490
You said your surname was Wen just now.

290
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:34,620
My father's surname was originally Wen.

291
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:38,910
He was given the new surname of Zhen by the former Miracle Healer Valley Chief.

292
00:23:38,910 --> 00:23:41,380
Since my father was forsaken by his sect,

293
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:44,620
I, as his son, should abide by my father's wish

294
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:47,610
and return to my original surname, as Wen Kexing.

295
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,210
A bunch of nonsense!

296
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,500
You dare to humiliate Great Warrior Zhen's name after death?

297
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,500
You must be the Sect Leader of Mount Emei Sect.

298
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,890
On my one-month-old birthday,

299
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:01,100
the female warriors of Mount Emei Sect worked together to create clothing from a hundred families
(T/N: It is a piece of clothing made for children that is said to give blessings and health)

300
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:03,410
sent to Miracle Healer Valley as a gift.

301
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,960
I still have not gone to your sect to personally thank you

302
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,680
for this kindhearted act.

303
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,860
You really are...?

304
00:24:11,860 --> 00:24:13,450
Elderly Nun Zhiyin!

305
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:15,650
Don't be tricked by him!

306
00:24:15,650 --> 00:24:18,220
Brother Zhen lived a life of justice and honor.

307
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,900
How could he sire such a monstrous son?

308
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,740
Wen Kexing, those three evil ghosts

309
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,890
are clearly your underlings!

310
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:29,950
You had them pretend to side with me, and now they suddenly betray me.

311
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:32,320
This is what you wanted to see, right?

312
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:36,140
Let me tell you. How could your underhanded tricks

313
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,920
deceive the heroes of the world?

314
00:24:40,650 --> 00:24:44,060
Heroes! Hear my word.

315
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:46,700
Ghost Valley has always been adept at sowing discord.

316
00:24:46,700 --> 00:24:50,200
My Eldest Brother, Gao Chong, fell for their tricks

317
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:53,390
and died wrongly accused!

318
00:24:53,390 --> 00:24:56,590
Out of the five pieces of Glazed Armor in the hands of my Five Lakes Alliance,

319
00:24:56,590 --> 00:24:59,180
four pieces have fallen into your hands!

320
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:01,790
Now you want my piece as well!

321
00:25:01,790 --> 00:25:04,790
Heroes! Don't fall for his tricks!

322
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:06,660
Shut up!

323
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,910
Are you fit to say Eldest Brother's name?

324
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,310
You don't have the right!

325
00:25:12,310 --> 00:25:14,250
Fifth Brother!

326
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,290
I understand now.

327
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:29,190
Shen Shen.

328
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:33,550
You were the one who allied with Ghost Valley and murdered Eldest Brother!

329
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,630
I suspected early on that there was a spy within Five Lakes Alliance.

330
00:25:37,630 --> 00:25:41,350
However, I never thought it was you!

331
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:44,160
You leaked the secret about the Glazed Armor!

332
00:25:44,160 --> 00:25:46,510
You killed the leader of Mount Tai Sect.

333
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:51,790
You allied with outsiders to kidnap Gao Xiaolian and used her life to threaten Eldest Brother and made him endure such humiliation!

334
00:25:51,790 --> 00:25:54,330
In the end, you made him commit suicide in public!

335
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:57,350
You are the evil devil!

336
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,050
Nonsense!

337
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:19,160
Thirty years ago,

338
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:21,120
Lake Tai's Sect Leader, Zhao Wenda,

339
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:24,510
fell gravely ill due to the grief of losing his son.

340
00:26:24,510 --> 00:26:27,740
Zhao Jing stayed by his side,

341
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:31,340
which moved Sect Leader so much that he adopted him as a son.

342
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,920
He stepped onto his path to glory.

343
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:38,240
Little lying girl.

344
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,060
You came here to trick the crowd with your lies.

345
00:26:41,930 --> 00:26:45,200
Why would I bring up such old events?

346
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,880
Because in front of the heroes of the world,

347
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:50,750
I want to ask Alliance Leader Zhao one thing.

348
00:26:50,750 --> 00:26:54,250
Why do you hate my father so much?

349
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,860
Not only did you want my father's life,

350
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:58,850
you wanted his Supreme Leader position

351
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,730
and even his reputation to be ruined!

352
00:27:00,730 --> 00:27:04,680
For him to regret his whole life, and die while falsely accused!

353
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,490
Is it just because thirty years ago,

354
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:11,250
my father once saw your poor and lowly appearance?

355
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,270
Everyone who saw you at your lowest

356
00:27:14,270 --> 00:27:16,520
have almost all died.

357
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:20,690
Is all of this a coincidence?

358
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:23,400
Did you see all this happen?

359
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:26,180
Can this not be a coincidence?

360
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:31,580
I, Zhang Chengling,

361
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:34,690
am the son of Mirror Lake Sect's Leader, Zhang Yusen.

362
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:38,980
[To Elder Ye in Mount Changming]

363
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:41,730
My father gave me this letter before he died

364
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,720
and told me to give it to Elder Ye.

365
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:47,270
The letter said twenty years ago, Rong Xuan, Elder Rong,

366
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:50,960
suddenly went crazy all due to Zhao Jing!

367
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:53,370
He knew the five brothers would compete with martial arts

368
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,170
and injuries couldn't be helped.

369
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:59,470
Thus, he secretly wiped poison on Gao Chong, Supreme Leader Gao's sword.

370
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:03,400
Afterward, his evil plot succeeded.

371
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,810
Elder Rong was poisoned and went crazy,

372
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:08,500
resulting in the various sorrowful events afterward.

373
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:11,190
In the end, the tens of thousands of lonely souls

374
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:15,310
who died in the Battle of Mount Qingya, should have all gone to Zhao for revenge!

375
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:24,140
Chengling, Chengling. I treated you so well in vain.

376
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:26,590
You dare to speak so much nonsense here.

377
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:29,190
Nonsense!

378
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:33,430
Zhao Jing, does being unable to speak your mind

379
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:35,390
feel bad?

380
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:44,560
When you people falsely accused my father, didn't you rely on a one-sided story as well?

381
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,680
Please look, everyone!

382
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:57,090
It's his disciple!

383
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:59,580
Didn't he commit suicide?

384
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:04,250
That's right.

385
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,400
He is my Yueyang Sect's first disciple,

386
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:09,810
my eldest senior, Deng Kuan.

387
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:13,310
As we all know, during the Heroes Conference at Mount Jun,

388
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:15,720
my eldest senior was the one who accused my father.

389
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,750
My father couldn't defend himself.

390
00:29:17,750 --> 00:29:20,430
He could only prove his innocence with death!

391
00:29:20,430 --> 00:29:23,660
But after this, Eldest Senior disappeared.

392
00:29:23,660 --> 00:29:26,090
Did none of you think that was odd?

393
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:28,140
Disappeared?

394
00:29:28,680 --> 00:29:30,570
Zhao Jing.

395
00:29:31,790 --> 00:29:35,970
Zhao Jing harmed my... master.

396
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:40,790
I let Master down!

397
00:29:40,790 --> 00:29:42,530
Eldest Senior!

398
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:48,010
Everyone heard that!

399
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:51,960
At the time, my eldest senior made a misstep that resulted in being captured by Zhao Jing!

400
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,050
He was compelled with occult tricks

401
00:29:55,050 --> 00:29:58,320
to accuse my father at the Heroes Conference!

402
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:02,370
Afterward, we did everything we could to rescue him.

403
00:30:02,370 --> 00:30:04,100
We treated him with utmost care,

404
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,740
yet he has still not fully recovered!

405
00:30:08,490 --> 00:30:12,270
Everything was Zhao Jing's scheme!

406
00:30:15,090 --> 00:30:18,450
So that's what it was?

407
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:24,760
As someone's child, if I can't take revenge for my parents,

408
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:27,500
how am I different from a beast?

409
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,830
I am a weak woman.

410
00:30:29,830 --> 00:30:33,280
Here, I risk death by unmasking Zhao Jing!

411
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:36,980
I ask the heroes of the world to

412
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,520
uphold justice for me.

413
00:30:44,470 --> 00:30:47,020
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

414
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:49,230
Kill him! Kill him!

415
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:53,310
Kill him! Kill him!

416
00:30:53,310 --> 00:30:56,450
- Kill him! Kill him!
- Amitabha.

417
00:30:56,450 --> 00:30:58,390
Kill him! Kill him!

418
00:31:56,730 --> 00:32:00,250
Petty tricks, Wen Kexing.

419
00:32:00,250 --> 00:32:02,640
If you've got the capability, kill me!

420
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,850
Unable to defend yourself,

421
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,430
betrayed and abandoned by everyone,

422
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,460
alone with no help.

423
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:30,200
Traitor Zhao Jing! Do you confess to your crimes?

424
00:33:30,200 --> 00:33:34,600
Wen Kexing, you planned well to

425
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,800
falsely accuse me.

426
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:41,000
I accept my misfortune. Kill me if you want.

427
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:46,600
However, if you want me to confess to those false accusations,

428
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,400
you are out of your mind!

429
00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:01,600
Ghost Valley Chief...

430
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,400
You're flipping the truth!

431
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:09,000
I didn't.

432
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,800
I will take everything that got flipped

433
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,400
and bring it back in place.

434
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,800
Dull and stubborn!

435
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:31,000
As Young Lady Gao just said,

436
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:35,700
as someone's child, if we cannot take revenge for our parents,

437
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:39,600
we are no different from beasts! Let me ask the heroes of the world.

438
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:42,400
Is taking an eye for an eye, blood for blood,

439
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:45,000
the law of Heaven and the principle of the earth?

440
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:51,200
Kill him! Kill him! Kill him!

441
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:56,000
My parents, the Divine Healer couple, lived a life of medicine and saved countless people!

442
00:34:56,000 --> 00:35:00,400
Due to Zhao Jing's betrayal, they were both tortured to death!

443
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:03,400
With the heavens above, and the soil beneath us,

444
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,600
I, Wen Kexing, as their child,

445
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:09,200
will take revenge for

446
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:12,200
the pain and suffering of my parents!

447
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,800
I, Zhao Jing, miscalculated a step,

448
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:22,800
but I have not lost.

449
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:26,200
You are the ones who have failed worst of all!

450
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,200
I played with you all for more than twenty years!

451
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,800
The entire martial arts world has fallen into chaos because of me!

452
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,700
I have not lost!

453
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:40,200
I've lived a plentiful life and will die a glorious death!

454
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:45,200
Everything has only just begun.

455
00:35:45,200 --> 00:35:47,200
If you kill me,

456
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,200
I will have you all live in my shadow!

457
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,800
Very well. I will make life worse than death for you!

458
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,400
Father, Mother, Master,

459
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:31,100
Supreme Leader Gao, A'Xu,

460
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:35,400
this is the path you wanted me to choose. Right?

461
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,200
You brought this upon yourself.

462
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:08,400
Father, eat this.

463
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:12,000
It is good for you.

464
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,800
Father,

465
00:38:28,900 --> 00:38:32,100
I know you are the best speaker.

466
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Whenever you speak, I can't prevent myself from becoming soft-hearted.

467
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:41,800
So in the future, don't talk anymore.

468
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,200
Rest well. Rest well.

469
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,000
A'Xu.

470
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:08,200
Here's your sword. Let's go home.

471
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,200
Let's go home first, all right? I'll tell you everything once we're home.

472
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:21,000
By that time, if you want to hit or punish me,

473
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,800
feel free.

474
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:33,400
A'Xu, this is the happiest moment of my life.

475
00:39:33,400 --> 00:39:36,000
Don't hit me here.

476
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:43,000
All right. I'll remember to give you a cruel beating.

477
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,300
Master! Junior Master!

478
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,200
Stupid boy, let's go!

479
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:49,200
Let's go home.

480
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,800
What do you want to eat tonight?

481
00:39:54,990 --> 00:39:59,130
Ghost Chief, where are you going?

482
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,090
What did you call my junior brother?

483
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:08,000
Zhao Jing was an evil bastard.

484
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:10,800
He brought that upon himself.

485
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,600
Today, everyone is gathered here

486
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,100
not to judge Zhao Jing,

487
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:20,600
but to punish this Ghost Chief!

488
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:27,400
Wen Kexing, your personal revenge was taken. Isn't it time to count public indignation?

489
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:30,400
Mo Huaiyang, are you insane?

490
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:34,500
This child is Great Warrior Zhen's descendant, not some Ghost Chief.

491
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,800
If we set aside the fact that that might not be true and act as though it is,

492
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,200
Zhen Ruyu has favor with you,

493
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:47,200
but how about my Gentle Wind Sword Sect? What relation do we have?

494
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:50,100
Wen Kexing, what exactly did you do

495
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:52,600
on White Deer Cliff?

496
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:57,400
Why is the great Ghost Valley Chief afraid to reveal his own identity?

497
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,900
Don't you think that's shameful?

498
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,900
Fine. I admit it.

499
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,400
I am indeed the Chief of Ghost Valley.

500
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,400
Before, I was joking with you all.

501
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,730
Wen Kexing,

502
00:41:14,730 --> 00:41:16,600
you dare to lie to me?

503
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:19,400
Forgive me, Master. If I hadn't lied,

504
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:22,000
I wouldn't have had the chance to punish Zhao Jing in public, right?

505
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,600
Are you a descendant of the Zhen family? How would you have entered Ghost Valley?

506
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:29,200
I entered Ghost Valley all thanks to everyone here.

507
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:31,200
Nonsense! Kind Benefactor Zhen—

508
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,400
Enough, Elderly Nun Zhiyin.

509
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,800
Don't you think it's mocking to call him Kind Benefactor now?

510
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:39,600
When your kind benefactor lost his reputation and became a cripple,

511
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,000
where was Mount Emei Sect? Even now, I still don't understand.

512
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:46,400
My father had so many friends and allies back then.

513
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,800
However, when my whole family met disaster,

514
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,400
where were you all?

515
00:41:55,400 --> 00:42:00,200
The reason for your parents' downfall was not due to anyone's persecution.

516
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:04,000
Rather, it was because they defended the evil Rong Xuan

517
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,200
and hid the secret of the armory.

518
00:42:06,200 --> 00:42:10,000
Therefore, I will settle this debt with you today!

519
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:17,200
Anyone who wants to settle a debt with my younger brother

520
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,600
must pass me first.

521
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,400
It's not your turn to do the settling!

522
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:29,800
Elder Ye!

523
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:34,400
Immortal Elder Ye.

524
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:36,200
Elder Ye.

525
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:39,000
Elder Ye, you came just in time.

526
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,600
I hope you will lead everyone in destroying Ghost Valley today.

527
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:43,400
That's right.

528
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,800
I will definitely destroy Ghost Valley.

529
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:49,580
Everyone in Ghost Valley must die.

530
00:43:22,990 --> 00:43:29,340
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

531
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:36,980
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

532
00:43:37,800 --> 00:43:44,800
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

533
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:53,400
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

534
00:43:53,400 --> 00:44:00,400
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

535
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,800
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

536
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:15,400
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

537
00:44:15,400 --> 00:44:23,400
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

538
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:30,400
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

539
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:38,600
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

540
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:45,800
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

541
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:52,800
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

542
00:44:52,800 --> 00:45:01,200
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
