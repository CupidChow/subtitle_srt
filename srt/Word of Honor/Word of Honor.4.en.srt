00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,600
Here.

164
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,400
Waiting must've made you hungry.

165
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,000
Taste it.

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,300
Undercooked?

167
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,200
It is cooked this time, but it is very bitter.

168
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,200
Here, here, here. Give it here!

169
00:13:40,600 --> 00:13:42,400
Stop eating.

170
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:46,400
Perhaps the fish itself was bitter in the first place.

171
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,200
Goodness, two idiots of different ages!

172
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,600
Don't you know you have to clean out all of the internal organs before grilling the fish?

173
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,400
If the gall breaks, the fish naturally tastes bitter.

174
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,600
I'm speechless.

175
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,200
You've spent your entire lives being waited on, isn't that right?

176
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,300
Where is your master?

177
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,600
People pick up bad behavior so quickly.

178
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,900
A'Xu.

179
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,600
Such a beautiful, starry night

180
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:36,200
is perfect for drinking and singing.

181
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,200
How can you just eat this coarse food?

182
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:47,400
Lake Tai is famous for its fish and shrimp.

183
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:50,400
I happen to have a famous chef on board.

184
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Why not ask him to make us some delicious food to go with some wine?

185
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,200
Young Master Zhang, I haven't seen you for just one day,

186
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:04,400
and you seem to have already grown taller?

187
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,600
A'Xiang,

188
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:12,000
when you have the time, you should learn from those two sisters.

189
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Serving others is good knowledge to have.

190
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:17,400
Wasn't your master's, my entrance today

191
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,800
awe-inspiring?

192
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,200
Master, I was born stupid, and you know it.

193
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:25,000
If you think those two sisters serve well,

194
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,900
just go to them.

195
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,800
"The clouds in the sky are like white clothes,

196
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,700
but in just a moment's time, it resembles a gray dog.

197
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,400
It has been the same since ancient times,

198
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:14,200
and nothing in life is impossible."
 (T/N: Ke Tan, a poem by Du Fu from the Tang Dynasty that explains how things can change so quickly in a moment, and nothing is impossible)

199
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,600
Rumor has it that Rong Changqing, the former Magic Craftsman,

200
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,200
created three masterpieces in his life.

201
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,000
Namely, the Great Wild Land, the Dragon Back,

202
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:25,400
and the White Clothes.

203
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:29,000
Back then, Qin Huaizhang, the last leader of Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

204
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,300
galloped around with the White Clothes Sword all across the martial arts world.

205
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,000
After the annihilation of Four Seasons Mountain Villa,

206
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,700
this famous sword disappeared.

207
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:40,100
A'Xu, let me tell you.

208
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:43,800
I saw that your sword was very similar to the White Clothes Sword.

209
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,800
I originally figured that those stinky beggars from the Beggar Gangs

210
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:49,400
would have terrible martial arts skills that would make them unable to withstand a single blow.

211
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:52,000
I just wanted to wait for you to draw your sword and confirm it,

212
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,600
but to my surprise,

213
00:17:53,600 --> 00:17:56,800
you'd rather lose blood than draw that sword.

214
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,200
Could that be because you couldn't bear to kill those smelly beggars?

215
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,300
Then I thought about it.

216
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,800
There are only two reasons.

217
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,800
Firstly, this sword is not yours.

218
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,600
Of course, how could our A'Xu do such a dirty thing?

219
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:21,100
Then there is only the second explanation.

220
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:28,400
Why are you afraid to reveal your whereabouts?

221
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,900
Master Wen.

222
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,500
Our relationship

223
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,600
is like this fish.

224
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,500
Do you know why?

225
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,400
It's raw.
(T/N: In Chinese, "raw" and "unacquainted" are the same word)

226
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:50,800
From our first meeting until now,

227
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:53,600
I don't even know who I am,

228
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:57,300
where I'm from, or where I'm going.

229
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,600
Who you are,

230
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,800
where you're from,

231
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,000
and where you're going

232
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,000
are not things I'm interested in.

233
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,200
You lent me a helping hand many times.

234
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:10,100
I respect you for that.

235
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,400
If you are insatiable

236
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,000
and want to see the White Clothes Sword,

237
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:17,400
Don't bother wasting your words.

238
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:22,600
A'Xu,

239
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:25,400
why have you become so irritable today?

240
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:26,800
It's all my fault.

241
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:28,500
I shouldn't have deliberately tested you

242
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,300
and caused you to receive internal wounds.

243
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,800
It hurts me so much, too.

244
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,200
Just forgive me this time.

245
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,200
It won't happen again.

246
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,400
I should have directly asked you what I wanted to know.

247
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,800
My A'Xu wouldn't lie to me, right?

248
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,800
Yun Cai! Hong Lu!

249
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,600
Phantom Musician Qin Song.

250
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,800
One of the Four Assassins.

251
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
It's surprising that someone was able to convince this evildoer to come forth.

252
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,200
They must be so capable.

253
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,500
Who cares who he is?

254
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:46,200
His power backfired back onto himself, and that will make him suffer for some time.

255
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:50,800
A'Xu, I've realized that you're becoming more and more suitable to my taste.

256
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:53,200
I'm sorry about getting your flute dirty.

257
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,600
I'll find a new one for you some other day.

258
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,200
Never mind.

259
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,800
It's just that A'Xu, you are so good at martial arts,

260
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:02,000
but you are tone-deaf.

261
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,100
I'll teach you sometime.

262
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,700
No need.

263
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,200
Feel better?

264
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,400
Let's go. Sit down for a while.

265
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:45,500
Uncle Zhou, I still feel so terrible.

266
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,800
Chengling, how old are you?

267
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm 14 years old.

268
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,200
The disciples of the martial arts family begin to study at the age of five to seven.

269
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,600
Even if you begin to practice internal skills at the age of seven,

270
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,200
it means you have been practicing for seven years.

271
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,800
How could this be the product of your learning?

272
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,870
Don't cry!

273
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,179
There, there.

274
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:05,829
Aren't all children too fond of playing?

275
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:07,829
When I was a child, my parents taught me to work hard,

276
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:10,210
but I also spent my days using tricks to get out of it.

277
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:13,980
How come I've never been too fond of playing?

278
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,419
Silly boy.

279
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:17,059
Have you ever heard the saying that

280
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:19,419
only the picky customers will actually buy goods?

281
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,419
Your Uncle Zhou scolded you for not working hard

282
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:23,469
because he wanted to enlighten you.

283
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:25,340
Won't you be smarter?

284
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,379
Uncle Zhou.

285
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,869
Master, please accept me as a disciple.

286
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:35,779
I will work hard.

287
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:38,750
I'll absolutely live up to your kindness to me.

288
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,059
Stand up.

289
00:23:40,060 --> 00:23:41,899
You are the Mirror Lake Sect's orphan.

290
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,899
You shoulder the important task of inheriting the sect.

291
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:45,920
How can I teach you?

292
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,780
I haven't joined a sect yet.

293
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:50,749
My eldest brother is good at martial arts.

294
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,539
Second Brother is a good reader.

295
00:23:52,540 --> 00:23:56,939
I had thought that my only responsibility in life would be to stay by my parents and pay my filial piety.

296
00:23:56,939 --> 00:23:58,949
That's why I never learned martial arts properly.

297
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:01,000
I haven't learned much

298
00:24:01,990 --> 00:24:04,170
about the martial arts of the Mirror Lake Sect.

299
00:24:04,800 --> 00:24:07,059
The tree wants to be still, but the wind keeps blowing.

300
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:09,469
When the children want to fulfill their filial piety, their parents die.

301
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,580
Most things in the world are like this.

302
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:16,090
Even so, you should still join the Five Lakes Alliance.

303
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:19,229
I won't! Master, I only want to learn from you.

304
00:24:19,230 --> 00:24:20,989
Please accept me as a disciple.

305
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,690
Stand up!

306
00:24:22,690 --> 00:24:23,899
I'll say it one last time.

307
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,400
Stand up!

308
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:33,949
You have missed the best time to learn the basics.

309
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:38,559
I'm afraid that even if you dedicate your whole life to it, it will still be hard for you to get a grasp on the best martial arts skills.

310
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,419
Don't talk nonsense.

311
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:44,709
Silly boy, you have to understand what your Uncle Zhou meant.

312
00:24:44,710 --> 00:24:47,229
The best martial arts skills that he is talking about

313
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,379
are like the martial arts of Bodhidharma and Changming Sword Immortal.

314
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:52,110
Few people can reach that state.

315
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:56,169
If you start working hard from now on, reaching my level won't be hard for you.

316
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:58,560
Although you are right,

317
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:01,130
there are two ways to learn martial arts well.

318
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,869
One is to have started practice in childhood.

319
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:06,109
The second is to practice properly from today forward.

320
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,259
Your martial arts will get better day by day.

321
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:10,899
Today you were bewitched by the Enchanted Sound

322
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,709
and suffered some internal injuries.

323
00:25:12,710 --> 00:25:14,899
I'll teach you some basic internal skills.

324
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:18,100
If you adjust your breathing rhythm by synchronizing your movements and your breathing, you can treat your injury.

A'Xu, I knew long ago

326
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:24,090
that you're firm with your words but have a soft heart.

327

Come on.

328

Are you okay?

Brother Wen, aren't you going to have a look?

330

It's okay, it's okay.

331
00:25:34,529 --> 00:25:36,199
A'Xiang can handle it herself.

332
00:25:36,199 --> 00:25:38,460
I can also handle things myself.

333
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,860
There's no need for you to worry, Brother Wen.

334

Pardon me for not sending you off.

Little Brother, what are you afraid of?

340
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:48,940
Could it be that

341
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:52,510
you're afraid I'll eat you?

342
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,210
If so, you'd be right.

343
00:26:54,210 --> 00:26:58,559
Little Brother, this sister really can eat people!

344
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,750
Be careful.

345
00:27:01,370 --> 00:27:04,300
What? Monster Jiang,

346
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:07,560
do you want me to eat you?

347
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:11,419
I find your meat too gritty for my teeth.

He is my prey.

Don't even think about him.

00:27:27,530 --> 00:27:29,650
Of course I do.

- The Enchanting Sound backfired.
- Who?

Anyone able to make the Enchanting Sound backfire

364
00:28:34,419 --> 00:28:36,179
must have martial arts skills far stronger than yours.

Would this child really have such a powerful man to accompany him?

I don't know.

It's fine that you were beaten,

Look down, lower your head, and meditate!

388
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,320
The centers of your palms, feet, and head should face upward. Remit all of your life force energy into your field of elixir.
(T/N: The field of elixir = pubic area, which is thought to be the central area where life force energy is stored)

It's normal to feel cold at first.

This is the Bodhi Meditation Song.

This song is very useful for practicing internal skills.

396
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:39,280
The song is crisp and tough. It's very smooth.

Only those who do not have evil in their hearts can manage it.

I didn't that this man would be able to blow such a flute.

399
00:31:27,660 --> 00:31:30,629
Ever since I was a child, whenever I wanted you to play a song,

400
00:31:30,630 --> 00:31:33,509
I had to act cute and be obedient countless times to get you to do so.

401
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:37,200
Now, you're playing all night just for a beggar.

402
00:31:40,630 --> 00:31:43,179
You did not face danger in a critical moment

403
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,920
nor did you suffer from internal wounds.

404
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,949
Your internal force is even shallower than the water in this cup,

405
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:50,150
yet you want me to play a song?

406
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:53,109
The internal force I consumed was more than you gained.

407
00:31:53,110 --> 00:31:54,510
Are you stupid?

408
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,290
Cut the crap. Go on.

409
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:07,050
What are you going to do with the sisters you saved?

410
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:09,760
Well...

411
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:15,229
Do you remember the dog you saved when you were a child?

412
00:32:15,229 --> 00:32:17,849
I'd been forcing you to throw it away, but you refused.

413
00:32:17,849 --> 00:32:20,179
Later, the dog was stewed and eaten.

414
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:22,610
You cried for a full three months.

415
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,299
My attitude is exactly the same.

416
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:27,610
If you've made a promise to it

417
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:30,179
but cannot take care of it for the rest of its life,

418
00:32:30,180 --> 00:32:32,870
then it is better if you give it away ahead of time.

419
00:32:32,870 --> 00:32:36,730
How could this be the same? These two are living people!

420
00:32:36,730 --> 00:32:38,230
Master, what about you?

421
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:40,060
You said you were following Young Master Zhang around

422
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:42,539
because you thought there was something odd about him.

423
00:32:42,540 --> 00:32:46,349
Now, you're wearing out your internal force to play the flute for others.

424
00:32:46,349 --> 00:32:49,240
Who even knows whether or not that beggar is grateful?

425
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:52,450
Since when has there ever been a time or place where you were allowed to judge my actions?

426
00:32:52,450 --> 00:32:57,179
Can't I just like him and want to make friends with him?

427
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:17,170
Once you get into it, you know the consequences.

428
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,830
I haven't slept so well in such a long time.

429
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:40,080
You woke up, A'Xu?

430
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,830
Did you sleep well?

431
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,159
After playing the flute all night,

432
00:34:57,159 --> 00:35:01,350
I feel like my internal energy is moving a bit sluggishly.

433
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,179
Forgive me. Forgive me.

434
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,720
Who asked you to blow it all night?

435
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,659
I deliberately tested you yesterday,

436
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,269
which caused you to suffer from internal injuries.

437
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:13,379
Your internal injuries likely healed very much after the end of last night.

438
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:15,139
You can take it as meritorious service to make up for my crime,

439
00:35:15,140 --> 00:35:16,910
so don't continue being mad at me.

440
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,180
Come on. Let me feel your pulse.

441
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:29,940
Master, please teach me martial arts.

442
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:31,509
Who is your master?

443
00:35:31,510 --> 00:35:33,619
Yesterday, I just taught you to harness some internal skills

444
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:35,269
to dissolve your internal injuries.

445
00:35:35,270 --> 00:35:36,719
This is not the martial arts of my sect.

446
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:39,120
We are not master and disciple.

447
00:35:39,120 --> 00:35:41,419
After I send you to Sanbai Mountain Villa,

448
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:43,980
our fate with each other will end.

449
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:47,120
If you want to learn martial arts, find someone else.

450
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,070
Silly boy, did you really believe that bluff?

451
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:04,309
Don't you know that your master is a man who's firm in speech but softhearted?

452
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,709
Cling to him.

453
00:36:05,710 --> 00:36:08,830
Haven't you heard that tough women can't resist clingy men?

454
00:36:09,790 --> 00:36:13,720
Where there is a will, there is a way!

455
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:15,210
Go ahead!

456
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:29,180
Master, I'm begging you to accept me as a disciple.

457
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,930
Are you going or not?

458
00:36:39,310 --> 00:36:41,110
What are you doing?

459
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,179
A'Xu, you're so cruel.

460
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,799
Would you leave me alone in the wilderness?

461
00:36:46,799 --> 00:36:48,559
Are you still short of servants?

462
00:36:48,559 --> 00:36:50,469
Who cares about me anymore?

463
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:52,619
A'Xiang is bent on finding a husband.

464
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,859
She thought I was troublesome

465
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,870
and even ushered me off the boat.

466
00:36:56,550 --> 00:36:58,760
You think I'd believe you?

467
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,069
As a matter of fact, A'Xiang blamed me for not taking care of my own body

468
00:37:02,070 --> 00:37:04,269
because I played the flute all night.

469
00:37:04,270 --> 00:37:06,390
That's the reason why she ushered me off of the boat.

470
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:09,789
I feel a dull pain in my field of elixir.

471
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:12,380
It is possible that I really did damage my energy?

472
00:37:12,380 --> 00:37:16,700
Ah Xu, just give me a lift.

473
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,510
Steady.

474
00:37:40,420 --> 00:37:43,930
Master Zhou, lie down well.

475
00:38:00,550 --> 00:38:02,580
You're a good driver.

476
00:38:05,270 --> 00:38:08,229
A'Xu, you are great in every aspect.

477
00:38:08,230 --> 00:38:10,099
It's just that you really don't know how to properly enjoy life.

478
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:13,419
Eating and drinking are the most enjoyable things in life.

479
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,600
Why do you always do them so casually?

480
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,580
Eat or don't eat. It's up to you.

481
00:38:19,580 --> 00:38:21,139
Huzhou is just ahead.

482
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:24,220
If you are not satisfied, you can leave.

483
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,069
How could I not be satisfied with you?

484
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:29,320
I just feel bad for you.

485
00:38:32,270 --> 00:38:36,209
I feel bad because our Chengling hasn't been able to eat or sleep well these days.

486
00:38:36,209 --> 00:38:38,320
Look how skinny his little face has gotten.

487
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,269
When you were still a master, your skin was fair and soft.

488
00:38:40,270 --> 00:38:41,749
It's only been a few days since then.

489
00:38:41,750 --> 00:38:43,339
We are approaching Huzhou.

490
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:46,910
We'll find a restaurant and have a good meal when we arrive.

491
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:49,250
My treat, okay?

492
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:53,160
Since you have had a fight with the Beggar Gangs,

493
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:55,500
Given how well-informed they are,

494
00:38:56,140 --> 00:38:58,120
there will definitely be a lot of people out to get you.

495
00:38:58,120 --> 00:39:00,280
In order to avoid complications,

496
00:39:00,280 --> 00:39:01,789
you'd better endure it.

497
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:04,410
We'll be fine when I get to Zhao Jing's manor.

498
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:07,700
Master, I'm begging you to accept me as a disciple.

499
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:12,379
Little Chengling,

500
00:39:12,380 --> 00:39:16,229
I didn't expect you to be such a stubborn and interesting person.

501
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:18,900
If I had the ability to cling onto people like you do...

502
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:23,730
Uncle Wen, I don't want to leave either of you.

503
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,630
Don't worry!

504
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:29,659
I watched the celestial phenomena at night,

505
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:31,250
pinching and calculating,

506
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:35,750
and found that the fate we have together still has a long way to go.

507
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:48,350
Master!

508
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,930
Ao Laizi, stop running!

509
00:39:57,930 --> 00:40:01,890
You're so old, yet you still don't understand?

510
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:04,929
That wretched Lu Taichong doesn't have friendly motivates.

511
00:40:04,929 --> 00:40:09,380
If he dies, he'll take you, too.

512
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,650
I'm telling you, you don't have the capability

513
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:15,520
to get involved in this mess.

514
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:18,310
You think you can?

515
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:20,179
What a joke!

516
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:22,989
No matter how weak my Mount Tai Sect is,

517
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,789
I still will not fear the likes of you!

518
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:28,949
Children, don't delay!

519
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:30,269
Go to find Great Warrior Zhao.

520
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:32,509
You got involved in this mess because of our Danyang Sect,

521
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:34,369
so we can't abandon you and leave.

522
00:40:34,369 --> 00:40:36,229
We are going up and down together!

523
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:37,549
Together!

524
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,220
Ao Laizi!

525
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,799
Your internal force is exhausted now, and you are very weak.

526
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:43,790
What else can you do?

527
00:40:43,790 --> 00:40:47,770
My wife and I are bound to win the Glazed Armor.

528
00:40:47,770 --> 00:40:50,520
You'd best understand the current situation.

529
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:05,260
Tao Hong. Lv Liu.

530
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,789
Seems as though enemies always end up meeting.

531
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:09,460
Uncle Shen!

532
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,269
Ao Laizi is also a master.

533
00:41:15,270 --> 00:41:18,770
I wondered why you were so afraid all this way.

534
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:21,099
It turned out that it was the leader of Mountain Dagu

535
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:23,949
who was chasing Mount Tai Sect.

536
00:41:23,950 --> 00:41:28,600
Great Warrior Shen, if today's story spreads,

537
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:32,970
I would like to see how your Five Lakes Alliance can continue showing its face!

538
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:37,370
You'd have to survive to spread this story out.

539
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,170
- Qing Bai, let's go.
- Okay.

540
00:41:45,720 --> 00:41:49,800
[Sanbai Mountain Villa]

541
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:07,940
I heard a long time ago that Warror Sanbai is the richest in the world.

542
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:11,390
Indeed, this is very magnificent,

543
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,930
and even a little elegant.

544
00:42:22,100 --> 00:42:24,229
Master, these are the two righteous men

545
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:27,030
who found junior Chengling.
[Lake Tai Sect of Five Lakes Alliance, Zhao Jing]

546
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:44,460
You've grown up!

547
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,230
Chengling,

548
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:50,630
I'm your father's best brother.

549
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,660
I am Zhao Jing.

550
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,170
Just call me Uncle Zhao.

551
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:01,710
Are... Are you Uncle Zhao?

552
00:43:05,130 --> 00:43:07,810
Child, you've suffered.

553
00:43:07,810 --> 00:43:10,700
From now on, make this place your home.

554
00:43:10,700 --> 00:43:15,870
If there's anything you'd like to eat or use, just let Uncle Zhao know.

555
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:20,139
Righteous men, I was rude.

556
00:43:20,140 --> 00:43:23,300
Thank you both for escorting Chengling back.

557
00:43:23,300 --> 00:43:26,700
I won't forget your great kindness!

558
00:43:26,700 --> 00:43:28,840
Thank you.

559
00:43:29,510 --> 00:43:30,980
No problem.

560
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:33,069
I have heard about Great Warrior of Sanbai's elegant demeanor for a long time,

561
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:36,520
but as expected, hearing of it hundreds of times cannot compare to seeing it just once.

562
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:40,820
Great Warrior Zhao! Great Warrior Zhao! Great Warrior Zhao!

563
00:43:40,820 --> 00:43:43,940
My master, the leader of Mount Tai Sect, is being chased.
[Disciple of Mount Tai Sect, Qing Hua]

564
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,040
I'm begging you to go and help them as soon as possible.

565
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:27,580
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

566
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:35,950
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

567
00:44:35,950 --> 00:44:43,060
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

568
00:44:43,060 --> 00:44:51,570
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

569
00:44:51,570 --> 00:44:58,610
♫ The cold rain of Autumn kisses my windows ♫

570
00:44:58,610 --> 00:45:05,910
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

571
00:45:05,910 --> 00:45:09,910
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

572
00:45:09,910 --> 00:45:13,550
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

573
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:21,390
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

574
00:45:21,390 --> 00:45:24,900
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

575
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:28,499
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

576
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:36,610
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

577
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:40,060
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

578
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:43,850
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

579
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:50,850
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

580
00:45:50,850 --> 00:45:59,320
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance of the sea,
I will be with you ♫
