how could you have dared to join in on the fight for the Glazed Armor? Bullshit!

161
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,400
You have no proof.

162
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,200
The witness has died.

163
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,400
You lost your evidence.

164
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,700
Just going off of your words and the connection with the Soul Winding Threads,

165
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,200
even if the Mount Tai Sect makes an accusation,

166
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,600
overthrowing the Supreme Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance

167
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,800
will be extremely hard.

168
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:15,800
Elder Huang, I know another enormous secret.

169
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:20,200
It's enough to utterly ruin the reputations of Gao Chong and the Five Lakes Alliance.

170
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,400
Say it.

171
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,800
Twenty years ago,

172
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,000
the Five Lakes Alliance led heroes all across the world

173
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
on a crusade against Rong Xuan, who had become a demon.

174
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,600
After Rong Xuan died,

175
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,200
the Five Lakes Alliance split the five pieces of Glazed Armor among themselves secretly.

176
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:32,800
Each of them hid a piece.

177
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:37,200
It's just a pity that those heroes didn't even know that their sacrifices

178
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,900
were a waste of effort to fulfill the greed of those people!

179
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:45,000
Elder Huang, the casualties of your Beggar Gangs

180
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,000
were not caused by our Five Mount and Sword Sects.

181
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Once this is exposed,

182
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,800
even if the Five Lakes Alliance doesn't collapse right away,

183
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,700
they will still never have the right to rule the remaining Glazed Armor ever again.

184
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:04,000
In terms of virtue and ability, the only people who are best suited to lead the martial arts world

185
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,600
are the Beggar Gangs.

186
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,800
By then, we shall force the Five Lakes Alliance to hand over their Glazed Armor

187
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,600
and let the Beggar Gangs lead the heroes to initiate a crusade against the Ghost Valley.

188
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,300
Even this turtle who hides his head in his shell is turning his back on the Five Lakes Alliance now.

189
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,600
The trend has changed.

190
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,000
Gao Chong's end is coming.

191
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:32,000
[Good Luck Inn]

192
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,400
A'Xu.

193
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,900
What are you doing?

194
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,000
What the hell!

195
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,300
Why are you suddenly disguising yourself?

196
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,400
Remove it.

197
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Don't touch me.

198
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,600
Don't use this face to talk to me in A'Xu's voice.

199
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,600
It's terrifying.

200
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,500
I'll have nightmares!

201
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,800
Isn't it so manly?

202
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,600
How about...

203
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,800
I go back to what I looked like in the past?

204
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,400
Don't! Don't!

205
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,000
This looks better.

206
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,300
I shall make myself handsome then.

207
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:27,200
Your original state is the best. Stop disguising yourself.

208
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,200
This is for you.

209
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,900
I don't need it.

210
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,500
My face is Heaven's masterpiece.

211
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:38,000
Staining it is like ruining Heaven's treasure.

212
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,300
The heavens will punish you.

213
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:45,400
Jokes aside.

214
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,000
The Heroes Conference is being held soon.

215
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,300
Although Chengling has handed in his Glazed Armor,

216
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:53,800
Gao Chong hasn't announced it publicly.

217
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,400
Therefore, many people will

218
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,800
have their eyes on the orphan of the Zhang family.

219
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,600
Our actions have been revealed.

220
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,800
The enemies are hiding in the shadows, but we're out in the open.

221
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,600
That's why it's necessary to disguise ourselves.

222
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,400
Your face...

223
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,800
is too outstanding.

224
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,900
I don't need it.

225
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,500
Did I mishear you just now?

226
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,100
A'Xu,

227
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:28,000
finally, you've admitted that I'm good-looking.

228
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,300
Don't worry.

229
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:32,000
I, Wen, am a troublesome forefather.

230
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,700
All troubles that meet me will immediately retreat.

231
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,200
No need to worry.

232
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,200
Now, you're not playing the role of Philanthropist Wen.

233
00:14:40,200 --> 00:14:42,100
You've decided to play a troublesome forefather?

234
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:44,200
When have I ever pretended anything?

235
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,900
I'm a kindhearted man to begin with.

236
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,900
What is this for?

237
00:14:58,600 --> 00:15:00,400
You applied this on your face?

238
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:03,200
This can change the structure of a person's face.

239
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:05,800
For example, a person's nose or cheekbones.

240
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,500
What about this?

241
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,800
Stop touching!

242
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:11,000
I just want to know.

243
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
Butt pads.

244
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,500
What about this red one?

245
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,400
Since you want to know everything,

246
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:26,100
why don't you kneel down and kowtow to me three times?

247
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,800
Call me Master and I'll teach you everything.

248
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,900
It's just an insignificant skill.

249
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:37,200
Why be so picky with who to pass it onto?
(T/N: Literally, "you'll pass it onto a man, but not a woman, a son-in-law, but not a daughter-in-law)

250
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,200
So are you learning or not?

251
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,200
Let me ask you.

252
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:46,100
Can your transformation skills

253
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:48,000
really turn you into anyone else?

254
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:53,600
It's not hard to imitate a person's appearance and voice.

255
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:58,800
However, every single person has their own speaking habits and unique posture.

256
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,000
Everyone has their own way of presenting themselves.

257
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:06,200
Therefore, you must either be very familiar with the one you are imitating,

258
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,000
or others must be unfamiliar with the one you are imitating.

259
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,400
Otherwise, you'll be exposed easily.

260
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:15,400
Then I suppose that if I imitate you,

261
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,600
I will definitely be able to successfully trick your silly disciple.

262
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,600
Just you?

263
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,700
You dare to imitate my incomparable elegance?

264
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:55,700
The once vast sea has stilled into a plain land.

265
00:16:56,900 --> 00:17:01,800
The snow on the mountains disappeared among the clouds.

266
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:08,600
Thousands of years pass in the blink of an eye,

267
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:17,200
yet my heart is still as before.

268
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,300
Why?

269
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,000
Make others do the dirty work.

270
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Let those righteous dogs bite each other.

271
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Isn't that good?

272
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:49,000
I mean...

273
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:52,800
Why do you want... me to do this?

274
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,600
Since you left the valley, you often spied on this man.

275
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,800
Did you believe that I didn't know?

276
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:02,600
Chief.

277
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,000
In this case,

278
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,200
I might as well let you take a good look at him.

279
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,900
Die early and revive early.

280
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,700
I thought I had forgotten everything,

281
00:18:16,800 --> 00:18:20,000
but it turns out that I have forgotten nothing.

282
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:28,300
I remember everything about you so vividly

283
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,700
as if it had all happened yesterday.

284
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,600
Beloved Feng,

285
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:44,300
I've lived through two lives.

I, Supreme Leader of the Five Lakes Alliance, Gao Chong, am here to welcome you, Sword Immortal.

290

Greetings, Sword Immortal.

So you're Shen Shen then.

are you here on behalf of the Sword Immortal of Changming Mountain?

The Sword Immortal of Changming Mountain

309
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:33,400
swore with the first generation owner of the Token of Honor

310
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:36,800
that once Ghost Valley brings harm to the martial arts world,

311
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:42,700
the person with the token can invite the Sword Immortal to come out of his mountain

312
00:20:42,700 --> 00:20:46,600
and demolish the ghosts and wipe out Ghost Valley.

313

Aren't I here?

314
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:53,100
Young Warrior, the Heroes Conference is being held soon.

315
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:56,000
Righteous men from the martial arts world have gathered here

316

to discuss the ways to demolish Ghost Valley together.

317

The Sword Immortal is an unearthly master and a famous senior.

It's glorious that you're here on behalf of the Sword Immortal.

- However, no one promised you

that we'd attend that conference or whatever of yours.

is the end of Mount Qingya.

323
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,000
When you're done wasting your words,

324
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:23,600
the Sword Immortal will keep his promise and help the person holding the token

325
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,400
to wipe out Ghost Valley at Mount Qingya.

326
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,900
Don't bother me with anything else!

327
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:41,200
This man is young, but why does he have such great power?

328
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,040
He looks firm and lofty.

329
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:47,760
Men of the Sword Immortal are indeed enigmatic and unpredictable.

330
00:21:57,960 --> 00:21:59,820
Sister Xiang.

331
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:04,740
You are... Who are you?

332
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,200
Master?

333
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,420
I missed you so much.

334
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:13,360
Let me have a look at you first.

335
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:16,759
It's been just a few days, but you're already so haggard.

336
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,379
Did you not rest well?

337
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:20,219
I can't sleep on any day.

338
00:22:20,219 --> 00:22:23,180
The Heroes Conference will be held in a few days.

339
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,879
I am anxious.

340
00:22:24,879 --> 00:22:27,279
This isn't something a child should worry about.

341
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,579
When the time comes, you just have to stand up

342
00:22:29,579 --> 00:22:33,059
and prove that the Mirror Lake Sect is not without a successor. Demonstrate your devotion.

343
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:35,019
After that, I'll take you away.

344
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:37,159
It won't be too late to worry about the disputes

345
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,200
in this martial arts world after you've grown up.

346
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:43,159
Master, I don't know.

347
00:22:43,159 --> 00:22:44,819
That day, Uncle Gao suddenly came to me.

348
00:22:44,819 --> 00:22:48,199
He was determined to betroth Sister Xiaolian to me.

349
00:22:48,199 --> 00:22:51,059
That way, she can help me support the Mirror Lake Sword Sect in the future.

350
00:22:51,059 --> 00:22:54,119
During the Heroes Conference, he will announce this news.

351
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:58,480
In two years, after I've grown older, we will have our wedding arranged.

352
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,739
Master, I've already handed them the Glazed Armor.

353
00:23:04,739 --> 00:23:07,560
Why is Uncle Gao still treating me so well?

354
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:10,600
The truth is that Sister Xiaolian also treats me well.

355
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:13,479
When the time comes, if Uncle Gao really does announce this news,

356
00:23:13,479 --> 00:23:17,599
won't they be in an awkward situation after I leave with you? I didn't dare to refuse, either.

357
00:23:17,599 --> 00:23:20,160
Chengling has already handed over the Glazed Armor.

358
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,299
What worth does he still have to Gao Chong?

359
00:23:22,299 --> 00:23:25,460
That's why I kept tossing and turning, unable to sleep at all for the whole night.

360
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:32,219
Don't think too much for now. We shall keep an eye on them.

361
00:23:32,219 --> 00:23:36,080
No matter what, I'll protect you secretly.

362
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,440
Master Zhang, are you done with your dinner? Do you need anything else?

363
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:44,840
N-No need.

364
00:23:44,840 --> 00:23:47,060
Then I'll go in and clean up?

365
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,899
I can clean them up by myself.

366
00:23:48,899 --> 00:23:50,620
All right.

367
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,927
Gao Chong does not have a son. He only has Gao Xiaolian, a daughter.

368
00:23:58,927 --> 00:24:01,687
No matter what his reason for winning Chengling over is,

369
00:24:01,688 --> 00:24:04,528
he still doesn't have to go to this step.

370
00:24:04,528 --> 00:24:08,648
Could it be that Gao Chong is changing his beliefs?

371
00:24:08,648 --> 00:24:12,088
Does he want to make up for his wrongdoings against Rong Xuan?

372
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:18,787
If I'm not mistaken, Old Wen is Rong Xuan's son.
[Chongwu Hall]

373
00:24:18,787 --> 00:24:23,267
I must find a chance to resolve their grudges.

374
00:24:26,188 --> 00:24:30,647
[Luo Mansion]

375
00:24:30,648 --> 00:24:32,708
[Frosted Dew]

376
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:34,207
So annoying.

377
00:24:34,208 --> 00:24:37,967
Nobody's accompanying me to the toilet, yet they still insist that we're sisters forever.

378
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,487
- Kill them!
- Yes!

379
00:24:58,128 --> 00:25:02,648
[Luo Mansion]

380
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:25,907
- Master, I've searched through them. Not a single one is alive.
- Good.

381
00:25:25,907 --> 00:25:28,067
A total of 47 devils were killed.
[I'd say fall days excel the spring morns]

382
00:25:28,067 --> 00:25:31,007
How satisfying! We finally released the resentment in our hearts!

383
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:32,508
Very good.

384
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:37,007
Everyone in the martial arts world says that Ghost Valley is like a great scourge.

385
00:25:37,007 --> 00:25:40,667
Now I see they are just a motley crowd.

386
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:42,167
How many casualties are there?

387
00:25:42,167 --> 00:25:44,367
Unfortunately, four junior brothers died.

388
00:25:44,367 --> 00:25:47,528
There are five with severe injuries and four with minor injuries.

389
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:50,028
Eldest Brother.

390
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,868
All casualties were caused by this demonic woman.

391
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:05,248
Owner of the List of the Unfaithful. White hair and a red dress.

392
00:26:05,248 --> 00:26:08,008
Are you Tragicomic Ghost?

393
00:26:08,670 --> 00:26:10,300
Don't waste your words.

394
00:26:10,300 --> 00:26:13,180
Kill me if you have the capability!

395
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,308
How dare you?

396
00:26:15,308 --> 00:26:18,227
Bring her back to the Five Lakes Alliance! Watch her closely!

397
00:26:18,227 --> 00:26:21,527
This demon's skull will be the sacrifice of the Heroes Conference!

398
00:26:21,527 --> 00:26:23,028
Yes.

399

[Upright and Auspicious Ethos]

400
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:04,508
Waiter, where does this man come from?

401
00:27:04,508 --> 00:27:07,687
Sir, this guy is amazing.

402
00:27:07,687 --> 00:27:11,047
He's so thin, but it seems he has an abyss in his stomach.

403
00:27:11,047 --> 00:27:13,740
Tell me. Where do you think all of the food he's eaten has gone?

404
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,990
He's really an incomparable foodie.

405
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,647
- He has been eating for almost six hours.
- Yes.

406
00:27:18,647 --> 00:27:20,347
My legs are already numb from standing!

00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,548
Sir, aren't you tired of chewing?

408
00:27:23,548 --> 00:27:24,988
No.

409
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:32,048
This man's appetite can beat ours put together.

410
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,568
This man looks young,

411
00:27:38,568 --> 00:27:41,788
so why does he give me the feeling of an unparalleled master?

412
00:27:41,788 --> 00:27:44,348
Like a supreme master under the surface.

413
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,748
I'm done eating!

414

Sir, you're finally done. This... Can you pay now?

Who's treating me?

416
00:27:58,808 --> 00:28:00,408
What?

417
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:05,848
What did you say? What do you mean, who's treating you?

418

I'll offer my help to whoever treats me.

Good. What's your name?

Wen. Wen Kexing. Brother, what can I call you?

Ye Baiyi. Thank you for the meal.

What?

00:28:32,556 --> 00:28:33,536
Give me money.

428

Wait a minute. Which one of you is treating me?

429
00:28:37,837 --> 00:28:41,436
You can treat me, but you cannot.

430
00:28:41,436 --> 00:28:44,256
Brother, I apologize for not knowing.

431
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:48,276
Do we need to have specific qualifications in order to treat you?

No, but I am not able to help you.

I haven't even opened my mouth yet.

434
00:28:55,557 --> 00:28:58,610
As it turns out, you were the one who asked for death,

435
00:28:58,610 --> 00:29:01,360
but even an angel must endure five symptoms before death.

436

It's miserable.

437
00:29:03,436 --> 00:29:06,937
How can you, being a dying person, wander around in such a lively way?

438

The young really are constantly replacing the old.

There are many more interesting people in the Central Plain's martial arts world.

How about this? I'll go back and think about it.

441
00:29:19,056 --> 00:29:21,696
Why don't you treat me to some wine next time?

442
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:24,737
I might be able to think of a solution.

Is there really so much disaster everywhere?

Beloved Feng, what are you upset about?

447
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:15,387
Are you going to harm me?

Qianqiao, you aren't dead?

450
00:30:24,987 --> 00:30:27,147
Of course, I'm dead.

451
00:30:27,147 --> 00:30:29,266
Your wife was superb in martial arts.

452
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,246
I suffered from two hits and one stab from her.

453
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,807
How could I not die?

454
00:30:33,807 --> 00:30:36,467
However, those injuries could not kill me.

455
00:30:36,467 --> 00:30:38,926
Then your wife stripped and disfigured me.

456
00:30:38,926 --> 00:30:41,646
She ruined my disguise and forced me to parade the streets for three days.

457
00:30:41,646 --> 00:30:42,986
She let everyone in the martial arts world know that

458
00:30:42,987 --> 00:30:45,906
I, Liu Qianqiao, the Green Demon, was not only licentious and shameless,

459
00:30:45,906 --> 00:30:49,847
but also a disfigured, ugly woman.

460
00:30:51,887 --> 00:30:56,526
Which woman in this world can endure such embarrassment

461

and still live without purpose?

462
00:30:58,266 --> 00:31:01,126
Qianqiao, stop talking.

463
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:04,027
I'm begging you, can you stop talking?

464
00:31:04,027 --> 00:31:06,187
Why?

465
00:31:06,187 --> 00:31:10,047
I just mentioned it, but you couldn't bear to hear it.

466
00:31:11,227 --> 00:31:16,527
Then, what about the pain I've suffered personally?

467
00:31:17,647 --> 00:31:23,327
Beloved Feng, although I'm an unlucky woman who doesn't deserve pity,

468
00:31:24,227 --> 00:31:26,567
why should I be the one to endure all of the blame

469
00:31:26,567 --> 00:31:28,866
for the wrongdoings of us both?

470
00:31:28,867 --> 00:31:30,827
Qianqiao,

471
00:31:31,887 --> 00:31:34,346
I know that you hate and resent me.

472
00:31:34,347 --> 00:31:35,986
I have nothing to say.

473
00:31:35,987 --> 00:31:40,387
Even if you kill me, my sin can't be offset.

474
00:31:43,047 --> 00:31:46,187
But I'm begging you, can you stop saying such things?

475
00:31:46,907 --> 00:31:51,567
These years, haven't I suffered the same torments?

476
00:31:52,507 --> 00:31:55,526
I wholeheartedly wanted to kill that evil woman and avenge you,

477
00:31:55,526 --> 00:31:58,467
but after all, she gave birth to Tianjie for me.

478
00:31:58,467 --> 00:32:01,386
I wholeheartedly wanted to commit suicide and accompany you down there,

479
00:32:01,386 --> 00:32:03,286
- but, I—
- Yes. You should have died.

480
00:32:03,286 --> 00:32:06,747
Didn't you promise that if worse came to worst, we would die together?

481
00:32:07,347 --> 00:32:10,150
Look! I've already been turned into a ghost.

482
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,140
What about you?

483
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:18,167
Qianqiao.

484
00:32:19,147 --> 00:32:22,527
But I think that I haven't earned the right to die yet.

485
00:32:22,527 --> 00:32:25,707
I'd made you suffer so much.

486
00:32:25,707 --> 00:32:28,526
I deserve to have to yearn for you every day.

487
00:32:28,526 --> 00:32:30,907
To be tortured every day.

488
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:35,107
Qianqiao, since I've seen you once again today,

489
00:32:35,107 --> 00:32:38,067
then even if I die right now,

490
00:32:38,067 --> 00:32:41,047
I will not bear any resentment.

491
00:32:44,387 --> 00:32:48,927
The once vast sea has stilled into a plain land.

492
00:32:48,927 --> 00:32:54,037
The snow on the mountains disappeared among the clouds.

493
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:59,057
Thousands of years pass in the blink of an eye,

494
00:32:59,877 --> 00:33:05,057
yet my heart is still as before.

495
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:08,097
A sinful fate.

496
00:33:10,357 --> 00:33:12,637
Forget it, Beloved Feng.

497
00:33:13,677 --> 00:33:16,677
You can't harm me. I knew it.

498
00:33:16,677 --> 00:33:19,077
You know it, too.

499
00:33:31,407 --> 00:33:33,407
Leader Yu.

500
00:33:33,407 --> 00:33:36,787
There will be a disaster if you see a ghost during the day.

501
00:33:37,747 --> 00:33:41,287
I, the Alluring Ghost, am here to give an obituary notice.

502
00:33:42,447 --> 00:33:44,767
Leader Yu,

503
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:49,527
you can never see your wife's only beloved son again.

504
00:33:53,167 --> 00:33:55,947
How did my son die?

505
00:33:56,887 --> 00:33:58,586
Did you kill him?

506
00:33:58,587 --> 00:34:00,907
I wanted to,

507
00:34:00,907 --> 00:34:03,107
but unfortunately, I was too late.

508
00:34:05,547 --> 00:34:07,426
The chief of Ghost Valley personally saw your son

509
00:34:07,427 --> 00:34:09,345
die under the Soul Winding Spell.

510
00:34:09,345 --> 00:34:11,766
Soul Winding Spell?

511
00:34:13,026 --> 00:34:16,006
Do you mean Hanged Ghost's Soul Winding Spell?

512
00:34:16,006 --> 00:34:18,107
It was Ghost Valley.

513
00:34:18,107 --> 00:34:20,707
Leader Yu, there's something you don't know.

514
00:34:20,707 --> 00:34:23,246
Mount Qingya's Ghost Valley is back in the martial arts world now

515
00:34:23,246 --> 00:34:26,006
to capture the Hanged Ghost who defected.

516
00:34:26,006 --> 00:34:28,227
Your son died under the Soul Winding Spell,

517
00:34:28,227 --> 00:34:30,965
so you have the same enemy as my Ghost Valley.

518
00:34:30,965 --> 00:34:34,446
That's why I'm here to give an obituary notice.

519
00:34:34,446 --> 00:34:38,646
It's better than making you suffer for the rest of your life.

520
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,130
Qianqiao,

521
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:48,080
I, Yu Qiufeng, am sorry.

522
00:34:48,087 --> 00:34:50,427
I shouldn't have suspected you.

523
00:34:50,427 --> 00:34:53,906
I know. No matter how is the world changes...

524
00:34:53,907 --> 00:34:56,780
Even if everyone in this world lets me down,

525
00:34:56,780 --> 00:34:59,000
you wouldn't harm me.

526
00:34:59,007 --> 00:35:02,626
Qianqiao, I, Yu Qiufeng, swear to the heavens.

527
00:35:02,627 --> 00:35:03,866
As long as you ask for it,

528
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:06,827
I'm willing to compensate you with everything.

529
00:35:06,827 --> 00:35:08,547
Qianqiao.

530
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:13,767
Qianqiao!

531
00:35:18,507 --> 00:35:21,127
Chief was right.

532
00:35:21,127 --> 00:35:23,667
Die early and revive early.

533
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:27,107
But I've died and cried,

534
00:35:27,107 --> 00:35:30,267
so why am I still unable to let this man go?

535
00:35:30,267 --> 00:35:32,507
If I knew long ago that this would be the case,

536
00:35:32,507 --> 00:35:35,486
I really should've drunk the Water of Oblivion.
(T/N: A drink created by the Goddess of Forgetfulness, Meng Po. It wipes memories to prepare mortals for rebirth)

537
00:35:35,486 --> 00:35:38,446
[Good Luck Inn]

538
00:35:38,446 --> 00:35:41,586
- Four! Four! Five!
- Six! Six!

539
00:35:43,207 --> 00:35:45,827
A'Xu, you lost again.

540
00:35:46,847 --> 00:35:50,666
It seems like you lied about having the Invincible Hand of Jinzhou.

541
00:35:50,666 --> 00:35:52,146
If I knew that you were so lousy,

542
00:35:52,146 --> 00:35:54,426
I wouldn't have suggested playing Truth or Dare with you.

543
00:35:54,426 --> 00:35:56,306
It seems like I'm bullying you.

544
00:35:56,307 --> 00:36:00,227
Say it. Truth or Dare?

545
00:36:00,227 --> 00:36:01,927
Truth.

546
00:36:01,927 --> 00:36:03,066
All right.

547
00:36:03,067 --> 00:36:05,687
I'll be serious then.

548
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:08,286
Let me ask you.

549
00:36:08,286 --> 00:36:11,426
Today, the strange, pretty boy at the restaurant

550
00:36:11,426 --> 00:36:13,687
said that you're dying because of your own actions.

551
00:36:13,687 --> 00:36:17,587
Is he talking about your old injuries that keep acting up?

552
00:36:19,487 --> 00:36:20,987
Is this your question?

553
00:36:20,987 --> 00:36:22,627
Of course not.

554
00:36:22,627 --> 00:36:27,567
I want to ask, where did you get your injuries?

555
00:36:27,567 --> 00:36:28,946
The promise you make when you drink is just like a military command.

556
00:36:28,946 --> 00:36:31,307
Don't you be a sore loser.

557
00:36:31,947 --> 00:36:35,987
What if I say it was karma, an appropriate consequence?

558
00:36:35,987 --> 00:36:37,366
Will you believe me?

559
00:36:37,366 --> 00:36:39,127
No.

560
00:36:39,127 --> 00:36:41,946
I believe that we shall uphold justice on behalf of Heaven.

561
00:36:41,947 --> 00:36:45,167
If Heaven won't punish those criminals, I will do it personally.

562
00:36:48,167 --> 00:36:49,686
I've been alive for so long.

563
00:36:49,686 --> 00:36:51,786
I've caused too many troubles.

564
00:36:51,787 --> 00:36:54,706
After death, I will most likely go to hell.

565
00:36:54,707 --> 00:36:58,827
Therefore, I shall atone for as many sins as I can when I'm still alive.

566
00:36:58,827 --> 00:37:02,220
I got my injuries to atone for my sins.

567
00:37:02,847 --> 00:37:05,386
After all, we must go through the Cauldron of Boiling Oil after death anyway.
(T/N: One of the eighteen punishments in Chinese hell where the victim repeatedly fries in a cauldron filled with oil)

568
00:37:05,386 --> 00:37:07,467
Being fried for 80 years...

569
00:37:07,467 --> 00:37:10,227
is still better than being fried for 100 years.

570
00:37:11,547 --> 00:37:14,327
Won't you have me to accompany you in the Cauldron of Boiling Oil?

571
00:37:14,327 --> 00:37:16,786
We shall get twisted into one single Youtiao.
(T/N: Fried, lightly salted Chinese snack like a fried doughnut. Created to represent traitorous prime minister Qin Hui and his wife being boiled together after executing a beloved general.)

572
00:37:16,787 --> 00:37:20,667
Won't that be nice and tasty?

573
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,375
Don't change the subject.

574
00:37:22,375 --> 00:37:24,456
This can't be considered as an answer.

575
00:37:26,716 --> 00:37:29,116
I did it to myself.

576
00:37:31,396 --> 00:37:33,196
Why?

577
00:37:34,016 --> 00:37:35,875
That's another question.

578
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:39,916
If you want to know, you must win again.

579
00:37:39,916 --> 00:37:43,436
Fine. I'm not afraid. Here we go!

580
00:37:43,436 --> 00:37:44,175
- Eight! Eight!
- Five! Five!

581
00:37:44,175 --> 00:37:45,336
- Six! Six!
- Six! Six!

582
00:37:45,336 --> 00:37:47,616
- Four! Four!
- Three...

583
00:37:55,876 --> 00:37:57,116
Don't be a sore loser.

584
00:37:57,116 --> 00:37:59,056
A sore loser?

585
00:37:59,056 --> 00:38:01,456
I won't even mind paying you with my life.

586
00:38:01,456 --> 00:38:03,976
I choose truth! Just ask.

587
00:38:04,536 --> 00:38:06,236
All right, I'll ask then.

588
00:38:06,236 --> 00:38:07,736
You can't lie to me.

589
00:38:07,736 --> 00:38:09,896
Since when have I ever lied to you?

590
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:12,456
Old Wen,

591
00:38:13,476 --> 00:38:15,456
is your surname Rong?

592
00:38:18,256 --> 00:38:20,716
You're Rong Xuan's son.

593
00:38:20,716 --> 00:38:22,935
You blame the Five Lakes Alliance and the whole martial arts world

594
00:38:22,935 --> 00:38:24,716
for causing your father's death,

595
00:38:24,716 --> 00:38:27,655
so you replicated many pieces of the Glazed Armor.

596
00:38:27,656 --> 00:38:32,456
You wanted them to bring punishment onto themselves for their greed.

597
00:38:32,456 --> 00:38:35,376
I understand your feelings.

598
00:38:35,376 --> 00:38:38,695
- Old Wen, but—
- Is this your question?

599
00:38:38,696 --> 00:38:40,696
No wonder.

600
00:38:40,696 --> 00:38:43,935
You accompanied me to play this game and drink with me just for the purpose of asking this question.

601
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:46,956
Can't you just ask me? Would I not give you an answer?

602
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:48,395
My surname is not Rong.

603
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,895
I'm angry that I didn't get a chance to meet the guy with the surname of Rong.

604
00:38:50,895 --> 00:38:54,210
Otherwise, I would've killed him every time I saw him!

605
00:38:54,976 --> 00:38:59,096
Forget it. It's the middle of the night but we're not chatting or drinking,

606
00:39:00,176 --> 00:39:02,096
we're provoking anger!

607
00:39:11,776 --> 00:39:14,296
Did I guess incorrectly?

608
00:39:14,976 --> 00:39:17,376
But Old Wen's actions

609
00:39:17,376 --> 00:39:19,716
and his hatred of the Five Lakes Alliance...

610
00:39:19,716 --> 00:39:22,636
Besides being Rong Xuan's son,

611
00:39:22,636 --> 00:39:25,016
how else can they be explained?

612
00:39:39,996 --> 00:39:42,956
It's me. Ye Baiyi.

613
00:39:42,956 --> 00:39:44,816
Follow me.

614
00:40:07,016 --> 00:40:10,416
You treated me a meal, so I have to do you a favor.

615
00:40:10,416 --> 00:40:12,455
I found a way to heal your injuries.

616
00:40:12,456 --> 00:40:13,716
However, let's make it clear.

617
00:40:13,716 --> 00:40:16,216
Don't you blame me if you die during treatment.

618
00:40:16,216 --> 00:40:20,756
Brother, when did I ever ask for your help?

619
00:40:29,896 --> 00:40:32,456
Who exactly are you?

620
00:40:33,696 --> 00:40:35,596
Intangible and traceless.

621
00:40:35,596 --> 00:40:38,395
You are the disciple of the Four Seasons Mountain Villa's Qin Huaizhang?

622
00:40:38,395 --> 00:40:40,196
You're right.

623
00:40:40,196 --> 00:40:43,255
My master is Qin Huaizhang.

624
00:40:43,256 --> 00:40:45,615
Most people in the martial arts world

625
00:40:45,616 --> 00:40:48,376
would call that old man "Leader" if they ever met him.

626
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:50,615
Old man?

627
00:40:50,616 --> 00:40:54,255
How could an immature man dare to show off his experience in front of me?

628
00:40:54,255 --> 00:40:56,595
Come. Show me more of your skills.

629
00:40:56,595 --> 00:41:00,355
Let me have a look at what kind of thing that hothead, Qin Huaizhang, had the ability to cultivate.

630
00:41:00,355 --> 00:41:04,095
Even if you're highly skilled in martial arts, even if I can't defeat you,

631
00:41:04,095 --> 00:41:07,035
I would never allow others to insult my deceased master.

632
00:41:07,035 --> 00:41:10,956
What? Qin Huaizhang died?

633
00:41:16,016 --> 00:41:17,776
Right.

634
00:41:18,536 --> 00:41:20,976
It's been so many years.

635
00:41:20,976 --> 00:41:22,936
All of them have died.

636
00:41:24,756 --> 00:41:27,896
The martial arts world belongs to you young people then.

637
00:41:27,896 --> 00:41:30,215
You said that I was insulting him?

638
00:41:30,216 --> 00:41:31,615
Let me tell you.

639
00:41:31,616 --> 00:41:34,255
Even if Qin Huaizhang was standing right in front of me right now

640
00:41:34,255 --> 00:41:38,476
and I scolded him directly in his face, he wouldn't dare to make a single sound.

641
00:41:41,416 --> 00:41:43,596
Please show me your skills.

642
00:41:45,496 --> 00:41:48,016
Your master passed his sword to you?

643
00:41:49,856 --> 00:41:51,645
Let me have a look.

644
00:41:53,245 --> 00:41:55,085
Idiot!

645
00:41:55,085 --> 00:41:56,704
Did you think that I would snatch your sword?

646
00:41:56,705 --> 00:41:58,344
What a silly thought!

647
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:00,725
You're the same as your good-for-nothing master.

648
00:42:00,725 --> 00:42:02,484
Didn't I tell you?

649
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:04,365
I'm Ye Baiyi.

650
00:42:04,365 --> 00:42:06,665
Ye Baiyi?

651
00:42:06,665 --> 00:42:08,425
Baiyi?

652
00:42:08,425 --> 00:42:10,104
Is the inscription on the White Clothes Sword
(T/N: Baiyi means white clothes)

653
00:42:10,105 --> 00:42:12,845
this brother's name?

654
00:42:12,845 --> 00:42:16,605
But the White Clothes Sword was made by the Magic Craftsman a hundred years ago.

655
00:42:16,605 --> 00:42:19,385
How old is he?

656
00:42:34,985 --> 00:42:39,625
I gifted this sword to your master.

657
00:42:39,625 --> 00:42:41,585
The sword and its owner should be together.

658
00:42:41,585 --> 00:42:44,205
Now its owner is gone,

659
00:42:44,205 --> 00:42:46,285
but the sword is still here.

660
00:42:59,505 --> 00:43:01,784
I didn't recognize you and was being rude.

661
00:43:01,784 --> 00:43:03,244
Please forgive me, Senior.

662
00:43:03,244 --> 00:43:05,584
Since you're the disciple of that dumb brat,

663
00:43:05,584 --> 00:43:08,745
I can't simply cause your death when treating you.

664
00:43:08,745 --> 00:43:11,845
Let me have a look at your injuries.

665
00:43:41,685 --> 00:43:43,385
What are you doing?

666
00:44:15,665 --> 00:44:22,025
♫ The sky is gray as I cross the cold river,
my duties taken care of ♫

667
00:44:23,385 --> 00:44:30,445
♫ Smiling at the absurdity of the moon's reflection in my cup ♫

668
00:44:30,445 --> 00:44:37,605
♫ Who allowed me to roam around the world on horseback? ♫

669
00:44:37,605 --> 00:44:46,185
♫ Who is drunk in their dreams but can't find
the homeland when they wake?  ♫

670
00:44:46,185 --> 00:44:53,045
♫ The cold rain of autumn kisses my windows ♫

671
00:44:53,045 --> 00:45:00,505
♫  I don't mind hate and slander, but my melancholy persists ♫

672
00:45:00,505 --> 00:45:04,544
♫ The spring breeze brings greenery along the river  ♫

673
00:45:04,544 --> 00:45:08,104
♫ But can't warm the ice in my heart ♫

674
00:45:08,104 --> 00:45:16,064
♫ Is that our light that appeared out of nowhere? ♫

675
00:45:16,064 --> 00:45:19,504
♫ I resent being unable to meet you earlier, but it is not too late ♫

676
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:23,184
♫ Don't let the flowers of the seasons down ♫

677
00:45:23,184 --> 00:45:31,225
♫ Give up the adventures on horseback for a peaceful,
quiet life by the stream ♫

678
00:45:31,225 --> 00:45:34,664
♫ The lights of thousands of families light up thousands of hills ♫

679
00:45:34,664 --> 00:45:38,464
♫ The past disappears like smoke waves in a sandstorm ♫

680
00:45:38,464 --> 00:45:45,485
♫ I will clear away my cold past and happily spend the rest
of my life making wine and tea with you ♫

681
00:45:45,485 --> 00:45:54,405
♫ No matter the height of the mountains or distance
of the sea, I will be with you ♫
