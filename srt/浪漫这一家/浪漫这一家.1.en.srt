1
00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:47,732
What?

3
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:50,485
Something doesn't seem right.

4
00:01:51,152 --> 00:01:52,070
<i>Wake up!</i>

5
00:01:52,153 --> 00:01:52,987
GO TO WORK

6
00:01:53,071 --> 00:01:54,572
What? What's this?

7
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:56,491
<i>Wake up, Byeon Mi-rae!</i>

8
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,958
For goodness' sake. This is a dream.

9
00:02:10,088 --> 00:02:12,215
-Why didn't the alarm go off?
-I turned it off.

10
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,217
-Why?
-You came home at 5 a.m.

11
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:16,052
You need at least three hours of sleep.

12
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:21,891
Your hair looks fine.
Brush your teeth and wash up. Hurry up.

13
00:02:25,019 --> 00:02:27,230
FAMILY VILLA

14
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,067
Gosh, they parked it like this again.

15
00:02:33,653 --> 00:02:34,904
BRAINLESS CAR OWNER

16
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,747
<i>The person you have called…</i>

17
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:47,542
For goodness' sake.

18
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,324
{\an8}<i>This stop is</i>
<i>Hodu Intersection, JPLUS Station.</i>

19
00:03:19,407 --> 00:03:22,201
{\an8}Coming through.

20
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:24,329
Coming through. I'm sorry.

21
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,928
<i>JPLUS</i>

22
00:03:40,011 --> 00:03:44,182
<i>It's a refreshing morning.</i>
<i>Is your morning commute refreshing too?</i>

23
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:47,268
<i>Due to autumn monsoon that's harder</i>
<i>to predict than the summer one,</i>

24
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,188
<i>it rained heavily for a few days.</i>
<i>It must've been hard.</i>

25
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:51,314
Will it rain?

26
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:54,525
<i>It's predicted to be</i>
<i>clear and sunny all day today,</i>

27
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,486
<i>so you can keep your umbrella at home.</i>

28
00:03:56,569 --> 00:03:57,737
It won't.

29
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:03,159
<i>I hope the sunny day</i>
<i>will bring happiness to everyone.</i>

30
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:06,329
The sky is clear.

31
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:10,250
<i>But squalls and lightning</i>
<i>may visit some regions.</i>

32
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:11,834
What?

33
00:04:11,918 --> 00:04:15,964
<i>So please be careful</i>
<i>and have a refreshing and cheerful day.</i>

34
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,970
Why did you come again?

35
00:04:22,053 --> 00:04:23,596
I will never sell this villa.

36
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,139
Leave.

37
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,629
EPISODE 1
A BOLT FROM THE BLUE

38
00:04:57,505 --> 00:05:02,302
The three nutrients for the office workers
are nicotine, alcohol, and caffeine.

39
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:06,848
Ms. Byeon, I heard that you stayed up
all night at the Gwangju branch.

40
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:11,019
I don't know if I drove all night
on the highway or the road to hell.

41
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,272
Ms. Byeon, I think
the price came out wrong.

42
00:05:14,355 --> 00:05:15,982
Shall I ask the design team… Gosh!

43
00:05:16,607 --> 00:05:18,234
Why is your face so rotten?

44
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:20,528
Me? Is it that bad?

45
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:22,113
You're breaking out in a cold sweat.

46
00:05:22,196 --> 00:05:23,781
You'll collapse at this rate.

47
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,075
Is it the lack of sleep?

48
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,244
Caffeine will make me feel better.

49
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,620
Pardon?

50
00:05:29,704 --> 00:05:31,706
Okay, I understand. Yes.

51
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,709
All right. Food merchandisers,

52
00:05:34,792 --> 00:05:37,170
be at the mart downstairs in ten minutes.

53
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,005
So suddenly? Whose order is it?

54
00:05:39,088 --> 00:05:40,089
The CEO.

55
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:42,258
Another unannounced inspection?

56
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:04,906
Hi, are you at the store?

57
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,787
<i>A royal secret inspector is here.</i>

58
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,597
-Hello, sir.
-Hello, sir.

59
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:33,226
Hello, Mr. CEO. For what occasion…

60
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:35,019
I was just passing by.

61
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,813
Shall we have a look around?

62
00:06:36,896 --> 00:06:39,774
PLUMP LIVE CRABS

63
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,404
So where are the live crabs?

64
00:06:48,116 --> 00:06:50,493
Hey, crabs.

65
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:53,412
It seems the crabs are
not feeling well today.

66
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:56,207
My goodness.

67
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,585
It's alive. Gosh, it's flapping.

68
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,587
Will you ask the customers
to shake the crabs?

69
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:14,767
Look at this bruise.
It'll need three weeks in the hospital.

70
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,478
Vegetable, don't eat wraps for a while.

71
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,272
Meat, the same goes to you.

72
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:21,566
Gosh, he's so strict.

73
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,402
Ms. Byeon, are you really okay?

74
00:07:24,485 --> 00:07:25,611
Who's next?

75
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,533
It's me, <i>Tteokbokki</i>.

76
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,452
-Me too.
-Me too.

77
00:07:32,535 --> 00:07:33,995
I'll give you more if you want.

78
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,542
You should eat a lot to grow tall.

79
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:42,462
All right. Here you go.

80
00:07:42,545 --> 00:07:43,671
Thank you.

81
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,465
-Bye.
-Bye!

82
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:51,596
Do you want <i>tteokbokki</i>?
I'll make it in no time.

83
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:54,140
Ma'am, what are you doing?

84
00:07:54,223 --> 00:07:56,601
Can't you see? I'm making <i>tteokbokki</i>.

85
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,935
It's my job.

86
00:07:58,644 --> 00:07:59,687
<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

87
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:03,191
I asked her to do it.

88
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,485
I asked her to give a generous amount
to children.

89
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,861
This isn't a soup kitchen.

90
00:08:06,944 --> 00:08:09,822
When it comes to <i>tteokbokki</i>,
children are the best promoters.

91
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,657
What?

92
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:15,203
-Mom, buy me <i>tteokbokki</i>.
-Buy me <i>tteokbokki</i>.

93
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:17,997
-Buy me <i>tteokbokki</i>.
-Come on.

94
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,582
-Two packets, please.
-Okay.

95
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:21,626
-My kid is obsessed.
-<i>Tteokbokki</i>, please.

96
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:23,794
When moms come shopping
with their kids after school,

97
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,630
the sales skyrocket.

98
00:08:26,214 --> 00:08:27,089
I see.

99
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,760
Stir-fry rice in the leftover sauce.
It's really tasty.

100
00:08:30,843 --> 00:08:33,888
I tried it as you suggested,
but it wasn't very good.

101
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,392
You did it wrong.
Don't use the rice you made at home.

102
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:45,942
{\an8}Use JPLUS's instant rice
so that the sauce seeps into each grain.

103
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:48,110
She's right. It was tasty.

104
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,904
-Right? You agree.
-Yes.

105
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
-Is that so? I'll have it then.
-Okay.

106
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,157
Look at that.

107
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:55,618
-She sold another item too.
-Enjoy the food.

108
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:59,413
Thanks to that, the sales
of the instant rice went up as well.

109
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:02,750
So we plan to sell the two items as a set
starting next week.

110
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>Tteokbokki</i>.

111
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,007
What's your name?

112
00:09:13,678 --> 00:09:15,513
It's Byeon Mi-rae.

113
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:42,873
Lastly, shall we say the slogan together?

114
00:09:43,624 --> 00:09:46,460
<i>Hang in there. Keep your eyes open.</i>

115
00:09:46,544 --> 00:09:48,879
-Sales are…
-Character!

116
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,298
<i>No, hang in there.</i>

117
00:09:50,381 --> 00:09:52,258
-Excess stock is…
-Death!

118
00:09:53,134 --> 00:09:54,260
<i>You can't die now.</i>

119
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:57,013
-Merchandisers…
-Do everything!

120
00:09:57,096 --> 00:09:59,432
-That'll be all.
-Goodbye, sir!

121
00:09:59,932 --> 00:10:01,225
Goodbye, sir.

122
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,648
Ms. Byeon!

123
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,817
-Ms. Byeon.
-Oh, no.

124
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:13,863
-Oh, no.
-Is she okay?

125
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:15,072
How much is it?

126
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,907
Hello. This? It's 8,000 won.

127
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,326
-Would you like one?
-Yes.

128
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:19,619
-Are you okay?
-Oh, no.

129
00:10:19,702 --> 00:10:22,622
-Ms. Byeon.
-Hurry up and ask Ms. Geum to come over.

130
00:10:23,623 --> 00:10:25,166
No, don't tell…

131
00:10:26,834 --> 00:10:28,544
My goodness, Ms. Byeon.

132
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:31,672
<i>The motto of Byeon Mi-rae,</i>
<i>a common employee in her fourth year.</i>

133
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,675
<i>"If you do everything,</i>
<i>you'll get somewhere."</i>

134
00:10:37,553 --> 00:10:41,390
<i>But it's impossible to do everything</i>
<i>since I only have one body.</i>

135
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,268
<i>So I suffer the consequences at times.</i>

136
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:51,859
<i>By the way, this body is broad,</i>

137
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,570
<i>hard,</i>

138
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,115
<i>and warm.</i>

139
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:02,536
<i>When I receive my paycheck,</i>
<i>I'll get a heated stone bed</i>

140
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,246
<i>with the 24-month installment plan.</i>

141
00:11:07,458 --> 00:11:08,918
<i>What am I saying?</i>

142
00:11:11,754 --> 00:11:12,963
Thank you.

143
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:15,007
-Thank you.
-Please come again.

144
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,975
{\an8}<i>Things were rowdy at the entrance.</i>
<i>Did something happen?</i>

145
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,522
I'm working, so I can't…

146
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,316
What?

147
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,036
You shouldn't move yet.

148
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,336
You're fine.
You simply passed out from exhaustion.

149
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,963
-The doctor told me so.
-I see.

150
00:11:55,798 --> 00:11:56,632
Who are you?

151
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,054
JPLUS
SECURITY, NAM TAE-PYEONG

152
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,183
Thank you. I apologize for the trouble.

153
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,146
Excuse me, Doctor.

154
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,946
What are you doing?

155
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:20,656
Well…

156
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,783
I'm sorry.

157
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:25,327
They said you need to finish it.

158
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:32,209
Thank you, but I'll take care of it.

159
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,504
Okay, then.

160
00:12:41,385 --> 00:12:42,386
By the way,

161
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:46,015
why didn't you leave?

162
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:54,398
Due to your thin blood vessels,
the IV fluid kept backing up.

163
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:56,192
The nurse asked me

164
00:12:56,275 --> 00:13:01,071
to keep an eye on you at your bedside
until it began to go in stably.

165
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:06,619
I see.

166
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:07,703
I can go now.

167
00:13:08,913 --> 00:13:10,206
I'm sorry.

168
00:13:16,378 --> 00:13:17,755
Look after your health.

169
00:13:21,342 --> 00:13:22,760
Not that I need to tell you.

170
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:34,104
MISS AE-YEON

171
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,737
Mom, I'll call later
since I'm working outside…

172
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:43,280
<i>Fire!</i>

173
00:13:43,364 --> 00:13:46,492
What? Fire? At the mart?

174
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:48,661
<i>No! Our home!</i>

175
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:50,621
What? Our home?

176
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,670
Miss.

177
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:59,129
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae!

178
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,131
You need to pay before you go!

179
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,016
Oh, no.

180
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,309
-Mom.
-Hey.

181
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,730
What should we take first? The house deed?

182
00:14:16,814 --> 00:14:18,899
No, we live in a rented house.

183
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,151
What's the most expensive item
in the house?

184
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,903
There's no such thing!

185
00:14:23,779 --> 00:14:26,782
Family photos, my laptop, and…

186
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:28,450
And… Wait.

187
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:30,619
-Our youngest!
-Our youngest!

188
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,165
What?

189
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:37,167
You're at the seafood market?

190
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,587
I thought you were inside the house.
There's…

191
00:14:39,670 --> 00:14:42,172
-You can't go in.
-Let go of me.

192
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,383
My baby is in the house.

193
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,594
It's too dangerous to go in.

194
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:50,014
-He's over there.
-Mom.

195
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:52,850
Mom! Mi-rae!

196
00:14:54,184 --> 00:14:56,312
-Our youngest!
-Our youngest!

197
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:58,147
Mom!

198
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:03,569
My youngest! Medal!

199
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:07,239
Gosh, Medal. My baby.

200
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,908
-Is she hurt anywhere?
-No.

201
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,285
How about me? Can't you see me?

202
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,329
Hyeon-jae, are you okay?

203
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:16,790
Why are you in your underwear?

204
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,376
I dreamed about undergoing
the CBR defense training.

205
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,003
Someone outside yelled, "Fire!"

206
00:15:21,086 --> 00:15:25,591
I didn't forget to grab Medal
as I escaped the fire. But you…

207
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:29,428
Well done. You're cool.
You're courageous, my son.

208
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,097
Is everyone okay?

209
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:34,224
We're okay. Thank goodness.

210
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:36,518
-How about Unit 301?
-What?

211
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:38,187
Didn't she come out?

212
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:44,401
-Goodness.
-Jeong-in.

213
00:15:44,485 --> 00:15:45,402
Jeong-in.

214
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,030
It didn't spread to my unit.

215
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,074
Thank goodness.

216
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,953
Doesn't the landlord know
about the fire yet?

217
00:15:54,036 --> 00:15:55,287
-What?
-The landlord.

218
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:57,706
-Was he rescued?
-I don't know.

219
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:59,917
-Mom.
-What?

220
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,001
Look.

221
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:02,294
They're coming out.

222
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:33,075
The landlord must be dead.

223
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:35,869
-Gosh.
-Oh, no.

224
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,509
{\an8}AMILY VILLA

225
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,229
GANGNAM HOF

226
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:08,402
How did that happen?

227
00:17:09,319 --> 00:17:10,446
Seriously.

228
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,532
What was the cause of the fire?

229
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:15,617
Even the police came two days ago.

230
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,413
Both the house and the person inside
got completely burnt,

231
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,914
so it's impossible to know.

232
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,377
Perhaps he fell asleep
with something on the stove.

233
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,337
After all, he was pretty old.

234
00:17:28,547 --> 00:17:31,341
But isn't it a bit strange?

235
00:17:32,342 --> 00:17:34,845
Had the cause been carelessness
or a short circuit,

236
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:38,223
the fire would've spread to other units.
There could've been an explosion.

237
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,561
That means
my place could've been destroyed.

238
00:17:42,644 --> 00:17:43,812
Gosh, I got goosebumps.

239
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,232
Seriously. Jeong-in could've
gotten hurt too.

240
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:48,734
It's okay.

241
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:52,071
It happened during the day
when most of the residents were out.

242
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:54,156
Besides, the unit across
wasn't affected at all.

243
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:55,991
Only Unit 302 got burnt.

244
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,869
Don't you think it's very strange?

245
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:02,790
Then…

246
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,502
In my opinion, this is…

247
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:12,132
an arson case.

248
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:15,177
There are three possible motives.

249
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:18,138
Money, a grudge, or a grudge due to money.

250
00:18:29,399 --> 00:18:31,902
-No way.
-My stomach hurts.

251
00:18:31,985 --> 00:18:35,989
Jeong-hyeok, do you watch
crime dramas at home every day?

252
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,282
What?

253
00:18:38,117 --> 00:18:40,285
Those dramas are based on real events.

254
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:43,747
No wonder. You have a geek's hairstyle.

255
00:18:43,831 --> 00:18:45,749
-What?
-Come and get your hair done.

256
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,668
I'll give you a neighbor's discount.

257
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,546
For goodness' sake.

258
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,716
Yes?

259
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,136
What?

260
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:02,391
Okay. I understand.

261
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:03,308
Okay.

262
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:09,231
It was a call from the real estate agency.

263
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:12,609
We have a new landlord.

264
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:15,529
The landlord had a daughter.
Didn't she take over?

265
00:19:15,612 --> 00:19:16,780
Apparently not.

266
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,701
Someone bought the villa just a while ago.

267
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:26,206
It has only been a few days
since the landlord passed away.

268
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,457
Who bought it? How?

269
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,002
See? It's suspicious.

270
00:19:31,003 --> 00:19:34,047
I knew it. The motive was money.

271
00:19:36,717 --> 00:19:40,053
And they asked us to come
to the real estate agency tomorrow.

272
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,473
Me, Ms. Hwang of Unit 201,

273
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,309
and you.

274
00:19:46,977 --> 00:19:47,811
Why?

275
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,565
Why us three?

276
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:53,108
I don't know.

277
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:10,918
AMILY VILLA

278
00:20:28,936 --> 00:20:31,855
Mr. Yoo, congratulations
on your second child.

279
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,649
Thank you, sir.

280
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:35,275
-In a blur…
-<i>Mi-rae.</i>

281
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:37,110
…we became a family of four.

282
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,028
KWON OH-HYEON:

283
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,571
<i>Is our relationship going to end…</i>

284
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,365
{\an8}<i>like this?</i>

285
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,327
These days, you need to be in a blur
to get married,

286
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:46,912
have children,

287
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:48,705
and get divorced quickly.

288
00:20:48,789 --> 00:20:51,333
It's a joke.
Ms. Byeon, when will you get married?

289
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,668
I'm a voluntary celibate.

290
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:55,254
You should have a ceremony.
Many people do it these days.

291
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:57,214
Will you come then?

292
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:59,800
Of course. I'll pay handsomely.
Almost astronomically.

293
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:03,553
In return, when I die, come to my funeral
and pay handsomely. I'll check.

294
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:07,391
Of course.

295
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,685
An old fart asks too many questions.

296
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,937
Are you celibate
because you don't date anyone?

297
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,316
Gosh, I got a text.

298
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,236
I thought I was barking like a dog.

299
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:23,991
But people like you always pass around
the wedding invitations suddenly.

300
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,910
Isn't that right, Ms. Lee?

301
00:21:26,994 --> 00:21:29,288
Things are different from our time.

302
00:21:29,371 --> 00:21:33,917
Ms. Byeon will take care of it herself,
so stop worrying about it.

303
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,295
Okay. If I go on,
I'll really become an old fart.

304
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,881
Still, your parents must think…

305
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,259
I became an old fart.

306
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,845
I'm done. I zipped it up.

307
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:48,932
Still, they'd want to see
their beautiful daughter

308
00:21:49,016 --> 00:21:50,475
-in a wedding dress--
-Mr. Park.

309
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:56,064
My mother was worried since I had no one
to walk me down the aisle at the wedding,

310
00:21:56,148 --> 00:21:57,357
so she's rather relieved.

311
00:21:58,066 --> 00:21:59,276
I don't have a father.

312
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:03,363
I'm very embarrassed.

313
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,866
-Please enjoy.
-Bon appétit.

314
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,117
-Bon appétit.
-You too.

315
00:22:13,415 --> 00:22:15,876
Yes. Did you ask the real estate agency?

316
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:17,336
<i>Who's the new landlord?</i>

317
00:22:17,419 --> 00:22:20,630
Apparently, he's
a normal-looking middle-aged man.

318
00:22:20,714 --> 00:22:23,258
Are you sure he's normal?
Anything off about him?

319
00:22:23,342 --> 00:22:25,802
He paid for the villa in cash.

320
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:28,722
Cash?

321
00:22:28,805 --> 00:22:30,348
<i>It must be over two billion won.</i>

322
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,934
How did he pay that much in cash?

323
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:35,979
<i>I wonder why he wants to see us.</i>

324
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,816
I think he wants to raise the rent.

325
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,985
Let's go there with our sharp wits

326
00:22:42,944 --> 00:22:44,279
and beg for mercy.

327
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,365
Okay. See you at the real estate agency.

328
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,789

Father.

353
00:24:07,404 --> 00:24:08,905
<i>Your dad is dead.</i>

354
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,198
Aunt?

355
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,243
Aunt, was Father involved
in that accident?

356
00:24:13,326 --> 00:24:15,871
<i>You don't have a dad anymore, okay?</i>

357
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:44,232
<i>A man in his late forties</i>
<i>who was involved in the accident</i>

358
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:46,193
<i>was moved to the hospital.</i>

359
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:48,987
<i>But he passed away during treatments.</i>

360
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:00,999
I said we shouldn't see each other.

361
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:05,462
I never said that you should die.

362
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,302
You should've lived well.

363
00:25:22,229 --> 00:25:23,438
Excuse me?

364
00:25:24,105 --> 00:25:25,857
Are you kicking us out?

365
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:29,444
What? How could a newcomer remove
the old residents?

366
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,656
It isn't like that.

367
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:34,699
There he is.

368
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,825
Who? The new landlord?

369
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:49,130
Here you go.

370
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:53,218
Well… As you know,

371
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,596
Unit 302 isn't in a livable state.

372
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,849
That's why I asked to see
the three of you.

373
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:02,811
Why did you ask to see the three of us?

374
00:26:02,894 --> 00:26:07,190
The tenants whose contracts
with the Family Villa will end soon

375
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:08,900
are Unit 301,

376
00:26:08,984 --> 00:26:11,861
Unit 201, and Unit 102.

377
00:26:11,945 --> 00:26:16,032
I wanted to ask
if any of you are planning to move.

378
00:26:16,116 --> 00:26:19,369
No, we are not. We had agreed to live here
for two more years

379
00:26:19,452 --> 00:26:21,830
with the previous landlord.

380
00:26:21,913 --> 00:26:23,331
My grandson

381
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:26,084
will enter the elementary school
in this neighborhood.

382
00:26:26,167 --> 00:26:27,544
We can't move!

383
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:28,795
Same here.

384
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:32,632
By the way,

385
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,428
how many members are in your family?

386
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:40,974
I'm alone.

387
00:26:41,683 --> 00:26:44,894
I see. You live alone.

388
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:54,446
So what happens now?

389
00:26:56,031 --> 00:26:58,491
I bought the villa
as my primary residence,

390
00:26:59,826 --> 00:27:02,287
so I'll have to move in somewhere.

391
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,789
There's an empty unit in the villa.

392
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:06,791
It's a semi-basement.

393
00:27:06,875 --> 00:27:11,212
By the way, it's only been a few days
since the previous landlord passed away.

394
00:27:11,296 --> 00:27:13,923
How did the owner of the villa change
so soon?

395
00:27:14,007 --> 00:27:17,302
I signed a contract
with the deceased's daughter.

396
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:18,678
What?

397
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,847
Is that possible?

398
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,060
Didn't she have to inherit it first?
There must be procedures.

399
00:27:25,643 --> 00:27:29,939
Besides, it isn't like the late landlord
put the villa up for sale.

400
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,358
How did you know that…

401
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,282
I don't think there's a reason

402
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:43,495
to explain such things to the tenants.

403
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:08,103
<i>Think about it and give me an answer</i>
<i>by the weekend.</i>

404
00:28:08,186 --> 00:28:10,397
Whether you're going to
keep living here or not.

405
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,318
This is a bolt from the blue.

406
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,531
Are we moving?

407
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,534
The real estate agent visited
in the afternoon.

408
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,994
I can't believe these jerks.

409
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,621
I like this place.

410
00:28:26,704 --> 00:28:29,207
There's a bus
that takes me straight to the university.

411
00:28:30,375 --> 00:28:33,837
I shined and cherished the house so much.

412
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,547
Then why are we moving?

413
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:37,841
Unit 201, Aunt Jeong-in, or our family.

414
00:28:37,924 --> 00:28:40,552
One of us will be driven out.

415
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:41,845
Really?

416
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:44,347
-Do we have money to move?
-Of course not.

417
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,892
What is this, a survival show?

418
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:55,650
The family that'll be driven out
will be revealed in 60 seconds!

419
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:02,532
Medal, your sister is back.

420
00:29:02,615 --> 00:29:04,492
Mi-rae, we'll be driven--

421
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:06,745
-You're back.
-Yes, I picked up roasted chicken.

422
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:10,790
Roasted chicken?

423
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:17,380
Medal, have a special meal.

424
00:29:22,385 --> 00:29:25,388
My dear sister,
it must be your payday today.

425
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:27,849
Why did you cook?
I told you about the chicken.

426
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,393
I know. We'll eat the chicken,

427
00:29:31,352 --> 00:29:32,896
and you'll eat this.

428
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:33,897
No need to eat that.

429
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,983
That's right. You should eat braised ribs.

430
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,651
It's your payday.

431
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,322
I've already sent your monthly allowance.

432
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,740
I've received it.

433
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:47,202
But can you please
raise the amount a little?

434
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,412
Just 100,000 won.

435
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,623
How about 50,000 won?

436
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,501
Fifty thousand won, my foot.

437
00:29:54,584 --> 00:29:57,378
-Didn't your report card come out?
-Not yet.

438
00:29:57,462 --> 00:29:59,964
-If your GPA is over 3.0, I'll raise it.
-What?

439
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:02,467
That means you won't raise it.

440
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:06,346
I don't even ask for a scholarship.

441
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:09,724
Just don't make me regret paying
for your tuition,

442
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,936
my younger brother. Understood?

443
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,062
All right.

444
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,272
-Gosh.
-Hurry up and eat.

445
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:18,107
It looks tasty.

446
00:30:26,407 --> 00:30:27,450
CREDIT CARD BILL
LOAN INTEREST

447
00:30:27,534 --> 00:30:28,368
CREDIT LOAN INTEREST

448
00:30:28,451 --> 00:30:29,452
SAVINGS
RENT

449
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,162
SALARY: 3,530,000 WON

450
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:33,039
BALANCE: 396,480 WON

451
00:30:33,122 --> 00:30:36,668
This month as always,
most of my salary is gone.

452
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,348
Are you working again?

453
00:30:50,431 --> 00:30:52,308
Yes. The product show is next month.

454
00:30:53,226 --> 00:30:54,561
I have a lot to do.

455
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:57,647
Eat this.

456
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,732
Eat one every morning from now on.

457
00:31:00,316 --> 00:31:02,151
Gosh, this is sudden.

458
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,319
Forget it. You eat it.

459
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,280
Eat it now.

460
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:17,542
Stop giving Hyeon-jae an allowance
after this month.

461
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,170
He'll graduate soon.
He needs to pay his own way.

462
00:31:23,631 --> 00:31:26,342
He's not ready yet.
I can't just cut off his allowance.

463
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,262
Just until he gets a job.

464
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,683
It isn't easy to work part-time,
study, and look for a job all at once.

465
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:39,480
But you did it. Why can't Hyeon-jae do it?

466
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,819
Mom, call the real estate agency tomorrow.

467
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,615
The real estate agency? Why?

468
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,200
We need to know
where to send the rent now.

469
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:52,911
The late landlord's daughter, right?

470
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:54,954
Yes.

471
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:10,345
Are you going to tell Mi-rae about moving?

472
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:12,597
Forget it.

473
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,433
She's struggling to clean up the big poop,

474
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:18,728
so I'll clean up the small poop.

475
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:22,357
Okay. Good luck.

476
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,691
Good luck, Mom.

477
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,782
Wait a second. I'm not the big poop, am I?

478
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:43,711
LANDLORD'S DAUGHTER

479
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,506
<i>This is Unit 102. Let's meet up.</i>

480
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:52,071
-Sign it.
-What's this?

481
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,115
-A contract renewal request.
-Why?

482
00:33:55,158 --> 00:34:00,288
The new landlord
wants to kick one unit out and move in.

483
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,205
Really?

484
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:04,375
We had a verbal agreement with your father
before he passed away

485
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:07,086
to renew the contract on the same terms.

486
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,797
Pull over for a second and sign it.

487
00:34:10,423 --> 00:34:13,634
Even if I sign it, it won't be effective.

488
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,345
I wrote down the date
of the verbal agreement.

489
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:18,639
I just need a document to prove it.

490
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:20,141
I sold the building already.

491
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:22,894
Unbelievable!

492
00:34:22,977 --> 00:34:26,147
How could you sell the villa
without a warning?

493
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,692
Although your father was difficult,

494
00:34:29,776 --> 00:34:32,028
he didn't backstab me like this!

495
00:34:32,111 --> 00:34:34,322
Just how much did you get paid?

496
00:34:34,906 --> 00:34:36,282
Is money that important?

497
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:42,622
-My goodness.
-What?

498
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:47,919
Father.

499
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,090
Maybe I was too harsh with my words.

500
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:53,049
Why did I sell it?

501
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,636
I couldn't pay the inheritance tax.

502
00:35:00,056 --> 00:35:01,099
You know,

503
00:35:02,016 --> 00:35:03,893
I'm raising two children on my own
after the divorce.

504
00:35:06,354 --> 00:35:07,563
My father said

505
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:11,859
that he raised me wrong
when I got a divorce

506
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,277
and stopped supporting me.

507
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,155
He was

508
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:19,659
such a cold-hearted father.

509
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:24,831
And he passed away like this.

510
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,542
It must've been so hard for you.

511
00:35:27,625 --> 00:35:29,418
My goodness.

512
00:35:31,879 --> 00:35:34,882
After I barely managed
to have the funeral,

513
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:36,384
I felt so hopeless.

514
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:41,681
Then he contacted me
through the real estate agency.

515
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:45,184
He offered to take care
of the inheritance tax and all

516
00:35:46,185 --> 00:35:48,646
if I sold the villa at a lower price.

517
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,069
You think I have any other choice?

518
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:02,827
Ae-yeon,

519
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,037
living is…

520
00:36:06,372 --> 00:36:07,623
Life is…

521
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:10,418
It's so lousy.

522
00:36:14,922 --> 00:36:16,299
Ae-yeon.

523
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:19,302
Hold on.

524
00:36:20,011 --> 00:36:22,763
Ae-yeon.

525
00:36:25,141 --> 00:36:27,894
-My goodness.
-Don't cry.

526
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,026
-Don't be like that.
-No!

527
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:37,028
-You don't need to pay me.
-Come on.

528
00:36:37,111 --> 00:36:38,571
Ae-yeon, don't--

529
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:42,283
Ae-yeon! Thank you.

530
00:36:44,076 --> 00:36:45,119
Welcome.

531
00:36:51,292 --> 00:36:53,294
I knew you'd be like that.

532
00:36:53,377 --> 00:36:56,547
Why did you pay the taxi fare
when she got rich from selling the villa?

533
00:36:58,174 --> 00:36:59,550
What are we going to do?

534
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,556
The thing is, Ae-yeon,

535
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,935
the situation has been resolved for me.

536
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:13,064
What? How?

537
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,026
I provoked his sympathy

538
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:22,573
and used a bit of honey trapping.

539
00:37:23,491 --> 00:37:24,825
<i>Sir,</i>

540
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:26,869
<i>this is Unit 301.</i>

541
00:37:26,953 --> 00:37:30,456
<i>May I please continue to live</i>
<i>in this unit?</i>

542
00:37:30,539 --> 00:37:32,750
{\an8}<i>Pretty please!</i>

543
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,127
{\an8}<i>Okay.</i>

544
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,590
Did this method work?

545
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,050
I know, right?

546
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:44,095
I was surprised that it worked.

547
00:37:45,888 --> 00:37:47,974
I can't believe this punk.

548
00:37:48,516 --> 00:37:49,809
By the way,

549
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:53,896
do you think he's a divorcee
or just a single man?

550
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,065
You sly minx.

551
00:37:57,316 --> 00:37:59,026
You made a move without a word?

552
00:38:14,583 --> 00:38:17,420
Yes? Okay, I'll check.

553
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:50,161
-Which floor--
-This is Byeon.

554
00:38:50,244 --> 00:38:53,205
Are you nearly here?
Please come to the tenth floor.

555
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:56,625
<i>Second floor.</i>

556
00:38:56,709 --> 00:39:00,129
Follow the hallway on your left,
and you'll see the meeting room.

557
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,840
Yes. Yes, that's right.

558
00:39:04,759 --> 00:39:06,302
Okay. See you soon.

559
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:16,771
<i>Tenth floor.</i>

560
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:41,545
"Dear kind-hearted landlord.

561
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,464
{\an8}I absolutely love this place."

562
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:44,548
{\an8}WELCOME, NEW LANDLORD

563
00:39:44,632 --> 00:39:46,801
{\an8}"I don't want to move."

564
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:49,261
Write, "Kind."

565
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:52,473
The spelling is K, I, N, D.

566
00:39:53,265 --> 00:39:55,768
-Guys, let's play.
-Eun-woo, let's play.

567
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,728
Okay, I'm coming!

568
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,979
Hey, Jang Eun-woo!

569
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:03,442
You need to finish this.

570
00:40:11,283 --> 00:40:15,663
"Dear kind-hearted landlord.

571
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:21,627
I absolutely love this place."

572
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:29,301
NEW LANDLORD

573
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:35,724
It's useless to bother
the previous landlord's family.

574
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,768
Hurry up and win over the new landlord.

575
00:40:40,229 --> 00:40:44,817
<i>There was even a jerk who felt uneasy</i>
<i>about accepting a woman without a husband</i>

576
00:40:45,568 --> 00:40:47,236
as a tenant and backed out

577
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,947
right before signing the contract.

578
00:40:52,199 --> 00:40:56,245
In any case, I went through
so much humiliation and struggle

579
00:40:56,328 --> 00:40:58,289
before coming here.

580
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,708
It isn't just about me.

581
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:06,297
My daughter works day and night
as the head of the family.

582
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,009
Recently,

583
00:41:11,385 --> 00:41:13,596
she collapsed
from overwork and malnutrition.

584
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:18,517
But she said that we didn't have
money for the hospital.

585
00:41:22,688 --> 00:41:24,982
I'm such a terrible mother.

586
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:29,945
I couldn't even buy meat for her.

587
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:39,538
As we pay the interest for the loan
we took out for the key money

588
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:43,250
and the rent, we're barely getting by.

589
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:45,753
If you suddenly ask us to move out,

590
00:41:45,836 --> 00:41:49,840
we'll have no choice
but to jump into the Han River.

591
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,259
<i>Look, Missus.</i>

592
00:41:52,968 --> 00:41:55,471
I'm no one's missus!

593
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,849
I'm all by myself!

594
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,018
A widow!

595
00:42:03,229 --> 00:42:04,313
<i>Understood.</i>

596
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:06,774
<i>I'll give it some thought.</i>

597
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,567
I'll await your call.

598
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,904
Okay.

599
00:42:21,872 --> 00:42:25,125
He'd be an animal
if he still kicks us out.

600
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,343
What will you do?

601
00:42:50,484 --> 00:42:52,486
-I'm taking off.
-Good night.

602
00:43:01,161 --> 00:43:01,996
BO-RA:

603
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:03,831
<i>Mi-rae, are you coming today?</i>

604
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,583
<i>You have to come today.</i>

605
00:43:09,795 --> 00:43:10,963
KWON OH-HYEON:

606
00:43:11,046 --> 00:43:12,131
<i>Mi-rae.</i>

607
00:43:27,855 --> 00:43:29,898
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

608
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,614
Min-ji, you became so fit.

609
00:43:36,697 --> 00:43:38,574
-Look at her figure.
-Really?

610
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:40,868
She's right. Your skin looks better too.

611
00:43:40,951 --> 00:43:42,161
What kind of workouts do you do?

612
00:43:42,244 --> 00:43:44,997
On weekdays,
I go to the gym and do Pilates

613
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,790
and go freediving on weekends.

614
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,834
And I got a laser treatment at a clinic.

615
00:43:49,877 --> 00:43:52,421
How do you do that while working?
Don't you get tired?

616
00:43:52,504 --> 00:43:55,507
Why would I get tired?
I make money in order to do what I want.

617
00:43:57,676 --> 00:43:58,802
Right.

618
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,181
Bo-ra, are the wedding preparations
going well?

619
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,391
We fight every day.

620
00:44:04,475 --> 00:44:05,976
I just want to get it over with.

621
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:11,482
-How about you, Mi-rae? How are things?
-Me?

622
00:44:13,609 --> 00:44:17,738
Things are the same for me.
I'm busy with work.

623
00:44:17,821 --> 00:44:20,074
Gosh, things shouldn't be the same.

624
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:22,326
You should enjoy a hobby.

625
00:44:22,409 --> 00:44:24,745
You're single, right?
Shall I set you up with someone?

626
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:27,331
Gosh, forget it.

627
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,292
KWON OH-HYEON

628
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,920
What? Does this jerk still contact you?

629
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,838
He's so stubborn.

630
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,090
Is he still clinging on?

631
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,257
He messaged you.

632
00:44:37,341 --> 00:44:40,135
-"Mi-rae, why aren't you answering?"
-<i>Why aren't you answering?</i>

633
00:44:40,678 --> 00:44:43,681
<i>You're the one who's bad.</i>
<i>Why am I hurting?</i>

634
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,934
-<i>Does my love mean nothing to you?</i>
-"Does my love mean nothing to you?"

635
00:44:47,017 --> 00:44:48,977
What's wrong with him?

636
00:44:49,061 --> 00:44:50,270
-Gosh.
-My goodness.

637
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,815
I broke up with him in person,

638
00:44:52,898 --> 00:44:55,025
but he wouldn't accept it.

639
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,986
What a lunatic.
He's pathetic until the very end.

640
00:44:58,070 --> 00:44:59,947
He said he also didn't want marriage.

641
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:03,450
Then he made a fuss about getting married
100 days into dating.

642
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,577
Hey, that wasn't the only problem.

643
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,454
He was a mama's boy.

644
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:09,081
God, you're right.

645
00:45:09,164 --> 00:45:10,499
My goodness.

646
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:26,348
Gosh, my nails got caught in fabric.

647
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,891
You should cut them.

648
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,312
I couldn't cut them
since my mom is on a trip.

649
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,734
What does that have to do with your nails?

650
00:45:38,777 --> 00:45:41,488
What? My mom cuts my nails.

651
00:45:44,324 --> 00:45:47,786
<i>And there was a reason why</i>
<i>he suddenly wanted to of getting married.</i>

652
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,037
Mi-rae, hold on.

653
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,915
Mi-rae, hold on.

654
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:53,959
What's wrong? Why are you so angry?

655
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,961
I told you from the very start

656
00:45:56,044 --> 00:45:57,880
that I have no intention to get married.

657
00:45:57,963 --> 00:46:01,091
-So why are you doing this?
-It's because I like you.

658
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:02,676
I want to live with you.

659
00:46:04,261 --> 00:46:07,389
And my dad will retire this year.

660
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,767
He told me to get married before then.

661
00:46:14,313 --> 00:46:15,230
Let's break up.

662
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:16,940
What?

663
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:23,238
I have a good eye for merchandise,

664
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:24,865
but not men.

665
00:46:25,699 --> 00:46:28,702
It's okay. I'll set you up
with a really great man

666
00:46:28,785 --> 00:46:30,621
among my boyfriend's friends.

667
00:46:30,704 --> 00:46:32,080
That's a good idea.

668
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:34,500
I honestly don't want to be
in a relationship.

669
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:40,589
All right. Forget about a relationship.
But you need to take care of yourself.

670
00:46:40,672 --> 00:46:43,842
Seriously.
Mi-rae, you only take care of your family.

671
00:46:48,347 --> 00:46:49,932
Let's drink.

672
00:46:50,015 --> 00:46:50,933
Okay.

673
00:46:55,521 --> 00:46:57,606
Medal, I'm back.

674
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,735
I thought you'd come home right away.
Did you work overtime?

675
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,655
What are you doing in the middle of…

676
00:47:10,994 --> 00:47:12,246
Gosh, it's hot.

677
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:15,999
Are you okay?

678
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:19,503
Why would you hold a memorial service?

679
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,926
It's the first anniversary of his death.
I'll do it just this once.

680
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:27,970
Once or twice, why would you even do it?

681
00:47:28,679 --> 00:47:29,763
He's a stranger.

682
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,280
It'll put my heart at ease.

683
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:32,576
You're right.

684
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,912
He's a stranger now.

685
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,502
Still, helping my children
bid their last farewell properly…

686
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:46,340
is my job as a mother.

687
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:56,308
We're living well on our own,

688
00:48:56,975 --> 00:48:58,977
so he should go his way in peace.

689
00:49:03,023 --> 00:49:04,858
Don't you think a farewell is necessary?

690
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:09,821
Don't you?

691
00:49:13,825 --> 00:49:14,660
Don't you?

692
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:17,788
Come on.

693
00:49:18,997 --> 00:49:20,123
What?

694
00:49:28,215 --> 00:49:30,300
But if you really hate it, I won't do it.

695
00:49:33,845 --> 00:49:35,639
If you hate it, I hate it too.

696
00:49:40,852 --> 00:49:42,020
<i>In my younger days,</i>

697
00:49:46,441 --> 00:49:49,069
<i>there was a spell</i>
<i>that solved all problems.</i>

698
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,530
Mom.

699
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,615
Mom.

700
00:49:56,118 --> 00:49:57,160
Mom.

701
00:49:57,244 --> 00:49:58,912
<i>Whenever I said, "Mom"…</i>

702
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:00,956
What? Are you hurt?

703
00:50:01,039 --> 00:50:01,873
What's wrong?

704
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,583
-What?
-<i>All my problems would be resolved.</i>

705
00:50:05,293 --> 00:50:06,211
Stop right there!

706
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:12,426
Boys who harass girls
should get their private parts cut off!

707
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:14,594
<i>She was</i>

708
00:50:15,470 --> 00:50:17,013
<i>my Wonder Woman.</i>

709
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:25,313
My stomach hurts so much.

710
00:50:25,397 --> 00:50:26,898
I think I'm going to die.

711
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,610
For goodness' sake. Lie down.

712
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:36,742
It's warm.

713
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:42,372
Stop crying. It's nothing to cry about.

714
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:44,833
Of course, you can go to college.

715
00:50:45,834 --> 00:50:49,337
I'll come up with the tuition,
so don't worry.

716
00:50:58,263 --> 00:50:59,431
Don't worry.

717
00:50:59,514 --> 00:51:01,641
<i>I wondered if she had more than one body</i>

718
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,019
<i>because she got everything done.</i>

719
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,896
<i>And finally…</i>

720
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,482
Mom.

721
00:51:10,901 --> 00:51:11,735
What is it?

722
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:15,030
I…

723
00:51:16,198 --> 00:51:17,365
got in.

724
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:19,409
JPLUS' open recruitment.

725
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:22,996
Really?

726
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,584
You don't have to do
this type of work anymore.

727
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:30,837
Mi-rae.

728
00:51:39,471 --> 00:51:40,764
<i>Now,</i>

729
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,559
<i>it's my turn to be her Wonder Woman.</i>

730
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,113
Okay.

731
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:02,702
Work is exhausting, right?

732
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,248
It's freaking exhausting.

733
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:08,291
It wouldn't be work otherwise.

734
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:09,960
You should slack off a little.

735
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:12,337
It's not like they give you more money.

736
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:15,590
Yes, they do. That's what a bonus is.

737
00:52:16,174 --> 00:52:18,760
Forget about that lousy bonus.

738
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:21,388
<i>I know it even when she doesn't say it.</i>

739
00:52:22,305 --> 00:52:25,559
<i>We're doing our best for each other.</i>

740
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,894
It's cold. Let's go inside.

741
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:29,104
Let's go.

742
00:52:29,187 --> 00:52:32,983
<i>It's my wish to continue living</i>
<i>the way we live now.</i>

743
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:35,902
<i>Just the way we live now.</i>

744
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:37,737
Let's go.

745
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:39,030
Let's go.

746
00:52:44,619 --> 00:52:45,453
What?

747
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,373
Wasn't the door open
when we came upstairs?

748
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,125
Was it?

749
00:53:05,181 --> 00:53:06,600
Let's get it over with.

750
00:53:17,235 --> 00:53:18,653
Why did you leave the door open?

751
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,574
That way, the ghost comes in
and eats the food.

752
00:53:23,366 --> 00:53:24,200
NEW LANDLORD

753
00:53:24,284 --> 00:53:27,078
<i>Sir, have you given it some thought?</i>

754
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:30,081
<i>Around when will you reach a conclusion?</i>

755
00:53:30,165 --> 00:53:33,418
<i>In any case, please contact me</i>
<i>when you do.</i>

756
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:35,086
<i>From the widow at Unit 102.</i>

757
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,432
My goodness.

758
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:30,767
What are you doing?

759
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:33,436
My goodness.

760
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:35,689
This is how you soothe the spirit.

761
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,065
You two do it too.

762
00:54:37,565 --> 00:54:40,860
My goodness.

763
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,570
My goodness.

764
00:54:42,654 --> 00:54:45,281
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

765
00:54:46,491 --> 00:54:47,450
My goodness.

766
00:54:47,534 --> 00:54:49,369
{\an8}BYEON MOO-JIN

767
00:54:51,329 --> 00:54:53,331
My goodness.

768
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:56,835
My goodness.

769
00:54:56,918 --> 00:54:59,337
My goodness.

770
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:03,049
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

771
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,489
I'm sorry that I didn't go
to your funeral.

772
00:55:27,657 --> 00:55:31,536
It wasn't intentional.
I didn't know where it was taking place.

773
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,497
We're living well.

774
00:55:36,041 --> 00:55:38,293
Much better than when we lived with you.

775
00:55:40,879 --> 00:55:42,005
As you can see.

776
00:55:44,382 --> 00:55:45,467
So…

777
00:55:57,729 --> 00:56:01,066
Let go of your resentment and worries.

778
00:56:02,692 --> 00:56:04,527
And rest in peace.

779
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:08,531
Don't wander the earth
due to your regrets.

780
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:13,620
Okay?

781
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,215
It's over, right?

782
00:56:25,799 --> 00:56:27,300
Medal, be quiet. Stop.

783
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:31,179
I guess dogs really can see ghosts.

784
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,724
So you came here without getting lost,

785
00:56:37,310 --> 00:56:38,561
Byeon Moo-jin.

786
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,046
Did a ghost come?

787
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,300
I'm sure it did.

788
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,011
While the ghost eats the food,

789
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,264
we should eat too.

790
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:43,168
Father.

791
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,346
-Mom!
-Mom!

792
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:20,455
Byeon Moo-jin.

793
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:23,500
Geum Ae-yeon.

794
00:58:25,001 --> 00:58:26,002
You…

795
00:58:27,587 --> 00:58:28,421
What's going on?

796
00:58:45,897 --> 00:58:46,773
No way.

797
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:51,319
<i>When you think, "No way, that can't be,"</i>
<i>it's usually…</i>

798
00:58:51,402 --> 00:58:52,362
Do you guys…

799
00:58:57,158 --> 00:58:58,159
live here?

800
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:02,830
Why are you asking that question?

801
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,209
I'm…

802
00:59:07,001 --> 00:59:08,378
<i>What you're thinking is…</i>

803
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,089
…the landlord.

804
00:59:11,798 --> 00:59:12,966
<i>…usually right.</i>

805
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,302
What?

806
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:18,304
<i>The father we kicked out a long time ago</i>

807
00:59:19,430 --> 00:59:21,057
<i>came back alive.</i>

808
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,559
I'm the new owner…

809
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:27,188
of this villa.

810
00:59:34,279 --> 00:59:35,572
<i>And he bought</i>

811
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:37,949
<i>our home.</i>

812
01:00:26,706 --> 01:00:29,626
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

813
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:32,128
{\an8}Father, why are you alive?

814
01:00:33,838 --> 01:00:37,800
{\an8}<i>Rumors about you two being ex-spouses</i>
<i>have already spread in the neighborhood.</i>

815
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,511
{\an8}You Moo-ron!

816
01:00:40,595 --> 01:00:42,805
{\an8}<i>Mi-rae's mom went through so much.</i>

817
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:43,973
{\an8}<i>Every business went under.</i>

818
01:00:44,057 --> 01:00:45,308
{\an8}How much will you bet?

819
01:00:45,391 --> 01:00:47,393
{\an8}<i>-What do you mean?</i>
<i>-Everyone placed a bet.</i>

820
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:49,646
{\an8}<i>"How did Mr. Byeon become rich?"</i>

821
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:53,900
{\an8}<i>A mysterious fire.</i>
<i>I smell something suspicious.</i>

822
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:56,110
{\an8}<i>The new landlord is</i>

823
01:00:56,194 --> 01:00:57,153
{\an8}the arsonist!

824
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,363
{\an8}Byeon Moo-jin!

825
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,656
{\an8}What on earth is it?

826
01:01:00,948 --> 01:01:02,742
{\an8}<i>Geum Ae-yeon. Didn't you miss me?</i>

827
01:01:02,825 --> 01:01:05,578
{\an8}What are you doing?
Get your hands off her!
