00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:01:32,467 --> 00:01:34,052
It's rare for his room to be clean.

3
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:10,630
Geum Ae-yeon. Are you jealous?

4
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:12,132
Just answer my question!

5
00:02:13,633 --> 00:02:14,717
-I don't want to.
-What?

6
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:17,178
I said I don't want to.

7
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:27,438
EPISODE 6
I WANT TO GET CLOSER TO YOU

8
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:31,860
FAMILY VILLA

9
00:02:37,323 --> 00:02:40,451
It looked strange at first,
but it's growing on me.

10
00:02:43,288 --> 00:02:44,455
I know.

11
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,129
Your feet! Move your feet.

12
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,346
You must be feeling troubled.

13
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:02,682
You're cleaning all kinds of places.

14
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:04,642
Give it to me.

15
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:09,355
It's the landlord's job to clean out here,
so the tenant can just rest.

16
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,403
Isn't that the landlord's job?

17
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,158
He parks here all the time
and never answers his phone.

18
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,535
My daughter was almost late for work
many times.

19
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:25,371
Mi-rae?

20
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,499
Take care of that matter.

21
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,589
Whose car is this?

22
00:03:35,089 --> 00:03:36,925
It belongs to
the neighboring villa's owner.

23
00:03:37,008 --> 00:03:40,470
He always does this.
How dare a youngster act like that?

24
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,556
The landlord is a youngster?

25
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:46,976
Yes, he's a nouveau riche
who made money through crypto.

26
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,811
He's the biggest snob.

27
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:52,982
He's making the nouveau riche
around here look bad.

28
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:57,028
Come on. You're different.
You look like a self-made businessman.

29
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:06,454
President Byeon,
would you please tell me your secret?

30
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,541
Of how you made your money.

31
00:04:17,006 --> 00:04:18,466
You're cowardly, aren't you?

32
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,844
Why do you ask?

33
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,101
Be nice to people.

34
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:30,520
And don't get greedy.

35
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,108
I'll leave it to you.

36
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:43,241
People think food merchandisers are
high up on the chain.

37
00:04:43,324 --> 00:04:46,452
They wouldn't know
we even do display work.

38
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,455
Up on the chain? We do everything
since we're at the very bottom.

39
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,293
Ms. Byeon.

40
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:55,878
Did I choose the wrong career path?

41
00:04:56,713 --> 00:04:59,716
We're nearly done, so return to the office
and print out the poster.

42
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:01,843
-Let's have a meeting right after.
-Okay.

43
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:13,855
BRAVO TTEOKBOKKI

44
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:16,566
What are you doing?

45
00:05:17,734 --> 00:05:19,444
I was passing by and wanted to help.

46
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,905
I'm fine.

47
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:24,782
So am I.

48
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:29,662
Thank you, then.

49
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:47,138
FATHER:

50
00:05:47,221 --> 00:05:48,222
Why aren't you answering?

51
00:05:48,306 --> 00:05:50,016
Pick up the phone.

52
00:05:50,099 --> 00:05:52,643
The phone!

53
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,570
-It was tasty.
-It was really good.

54
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:03,905
No. What will you do?

55
00:06:03,988 --> 00:06:07,492
Hurry up and move the car.
We need to leave.

56
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,619
Not after doing this
to my car, you're not.

57
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,996
We didn't do it.

58
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:15,625
-My baby's talent show will begin soon.
-Yes.

59
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:18,628
-Talk to our landlord.
-Yes.

60
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,839
All right then.
Call your landlord right now!

61
00:06:21,923 --> 00:06:22,757
Hey.

62
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,303
The landlord is here.

63
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,432
Hi, President Byeon.

64
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:35,144
He keeps complaining to us
about the state his car is in.

65
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:37,855
He'll hit us at this rate!

66
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:40,817
I need to go and play Tree Number Three.

67
00:06:41,317 --> 00:06:42,693
But what's that?

68
00:06:42,777 --> 00:06:45,446
PARKING VIOLATION

69
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:49,992
Oh, that?

70
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:52,370
I told him to stick those on.

71
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,749
Did I stick them on too firmly?

72
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,753
I'm the meticulous type, you see.

73
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,507
Are you insane?

74
00:07:10,304 --> 00:07:13,099
I hear that you park
in front of my villa often.

75
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:18,020
My villa's most important tenant told me
to solve this matter.

76
00:07:18,855 --> 00:07:19,772
For goodness' sake.

77
00:07:19,856 --> 00:07:22,024
Why are you taking off your clothes?

78
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,152
It's chilly. What are you doing?

79
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,946
You have no fear, old man.

80
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,827
I have a lot of money.

81
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:34,495
I can easily afford the settlement.

82
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:44,881
I can't live like this.

83
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,185
Where are you going?

84
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:58,561
To see you.

85
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:02,273
Ae-yeon, you saw the photo, didn't you?

86
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,777
President Byeon isn't the bastard.

87
00:08:08,362 --> 00:08:09,197
What?

88
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:12,909
The penniless, slow-witted, and scummy man
who got me pregnant and ran off.

89
00:08:14,243 --> 00:08:15,786
It's not President Byeon.

90
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,126
Back then--

91
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:23,169
Mr. President!

92
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:25,671
-Mr. President!
-President Byeon!

93
00:08:31,093 --> 00:08:32,553
It hurts!

94
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:37,517
-How did he subdue such a big man at once?
-My arm!

95
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:41,646
He has lean muscles
that are meant for real combat.

96
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,689
The carp is writhing.

97
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:47,485
Wow. Father is so cool.

98
00:08:49,237 --> 00:08:51,614
Why do you keep parking
in front of my villa?

99
00:08:52,448 --> 00:08:55,284
I only did it a few times
when there was nowhere to park.

100
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:58,496
All right! I won't do it again!

101
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:00,748
I won't do it again, sir!

102
00:09:00,831 --> 00:09:02,333
If you got lucky struck it rich,

103
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,794
you should be thankful
and be nice to people.

104
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,088
Why do you keep causing trouble?

105
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,340
Were you in the wrong or not?

106
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,593
I was in the wrong. I was.

107
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:20,518
How much do you want to settle?

108
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:24,063
No, no. It's okay, sir.

109
00:09:31,195 --> 00:09:33,447
-Be nice to people, okay?
-Yes, sir.

110
00:09:41,872 --> 00:09:42,873
It's done.

111
00:09:56,554 --> 00:09:58,139
First floor.

112
00:10:08,149 --> 00:10:09,442
The doors are closing.

113
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:22,121
What size clothes do you wear?

114
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,338
You can tell by
just looking at him, right?

115
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,882
Prepare a suit and send it to his place.

116
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:34,425
Don't do that.

117
00:10:35,926 --> 00:10:37,053
I'm not going.

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,098
That littleâ€¦

119
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:45,436
Nam Tae-pyeong!

120
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:47,647
Someone might see us.

121
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:51,859
Just come and have a meal.

122
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:54,236
Say hello to some people, bow,
and that's it.

123
00:10:56,072 --> 00:10:58,491
Stop making this
look like some soap opera.

124
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:00,284
What?

125
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,537
If you keep doing this,
I'll go off the grid again.

126
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,790
-You punk! Is that a threat?
-It's a warning.

127
00:11:20,971 --> 00:11:22,306
Four years ago,

128
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:26,894
I lived in the same neighborhood
in Thailand

129
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:29,438
-as Khun Mooy.
-"Khun Mooy"?

130
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:33,150
Right. It was the name
President Byeon used in Thailand.

131
00:11:33,234 --> 00:11:34,985
It's customary to use nicknames there.

132
00:11:35,653 --> 00:11:37,780
I was Joy.

133
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,157
"Joy"?

134
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,748
He was the first Korean I met
in the neighborhood.

135
00:11:49,959 --> 00:11:54,130
I can't believe I traveled here
only to fall for a man and settle down.

136
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:57,466
I feel like I'm insane.

137
00:12:02,221 --> 00:12:04,140
Have I been talking too much about myself?

138
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:08,936
Don't you have friends?

139
00:12:09,019 --> 00:12:10,438
Of course not.

140
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:12,565
I'm speaking Korean
for the first time in months.

141
00:12:18,446 --> 00:12:20,114
Now, tell me about yourself.

142
00:12:22,575 --> 00:12:24,243
How did you drift all the way here?

143
00:12:28,456 --> 00:12:29,623
Kimchi.

144
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,420
I guess you don't crave it.

145
00:12:36,714 --> 00:12:38,924
Since nothing worked out for him in Korea,

146
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:43,220
he figured that the country wasn't
a good match for him.

147
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,015
Since it's always hot in Thailand,

148
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:48,559
he thought he'd at least
save money on clothes.

149
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:53,689
That's so like him.

150
00:12:55,816 --> 00:12:56,942
There's a reason why

151
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:00,779
I've kept this photo for so long.

152
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:07,828
It's the only photo I ever took

153
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,331
with my baby.

154
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,837
I never even got a sonogram.

155
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:23,260
That bastard ran away
as soon as he found out I was pregnant.

156
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:26,764
I wanted to go back to Korea,
but I couldn't afford a flight back home.

157
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,350
So I sucked it up

158
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:32,186
and interviewed to work as a stripper.

159
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,732
Aâ€¦ A what?

160
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,860
There are many single mothers
who raise children that way.

161
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,530
But still!

162
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:45,115
You crazy bitch!

163
00:13:47,409 --> 00:13:50,079
Yes, President Byeon said the same thing.

164
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,123
You crazy bitch!

165
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,335
Of course, I'm crazy.

166
00:13:57,545 --> 00:14:00,506
That's what happens to a girl
when she meets the wrong man.

167
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,925
Move.

168
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:04,134
Hey.

169
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:08,097
Take this and go back to Korea.

170
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,855
Isn't this your entire fortune?

171
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:23,862
Forget it. I can't afford to pay you back.

172
00:14:24,363 --> 00:14:25,656
Hey!

173
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:29,827
I'm not doing this for you.

174
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,039
I'm just reminded of a woman

175
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,502
who's struggling to raise her kids alone
after meeting the wrong man.

176
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:44,300
I think he gave me the money
with you in mind.

177
00:14:57,396 --> 00:15:00,816
Why did you keep it a secret from me?

178
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,277
Both President Byeon and I were

179
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:08,365
at rock bottom back then.

180
00:15:09,783 --> 00:15:13,245
If you find out
what President Byeon did in Thailandâ€¦

181
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:20,085
You don't know what I've done
to come this far.

182
00:15:20,169 --> 00:15:22,588
Why do you keep causing trouble?

183
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,883
What did he do?

184
00:15:26,717 --> 00:15:28,552
I didn't mean it like that.

185
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:32,056
It wasn't easy to make money
in a foreign country.

186
00:15:32,139 --> 00:15:35,559
He cleaned, waited tables,
and worked various jobs--

187
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,061
Did he beat people up?

188
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:39,438
Was he a thug? A gangster?
Something like that?

189
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:41,815
Of course not! What are youâ€¦

190
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,734
He just sold something.

191
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,069
He sold something?

192
00:15:45,152 --> 00:15:46,070
What did he sell?

193
00:15:48,030 --> 00:15:48,864
Drugs?

194
00:15:49,448 --> 00:15:53,202
You've watched too many movies.

195
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,870
Then what is it?

196
00:15:58,499 --> 00:16:01,168
Khun Mooy will kill me
if he finds out I told you.

197
00:16:01,251 --> 00:16:03,796
Hurry up and tell me!

198
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:42,084
Whatâ€¦ What are those on his feet?

199
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,677
He got a job at a shoe store.

200
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:55,514
I don't know if it was his nice ankles,

201
00:16:55,597 --> 00:16:57,599
but when he'd walk around in heels,

202
00:16:58,475 --> 00:17:00,060
the sales would skyrocket.

203
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,947
I'm here, but I'm not here.

204
00:17:13,657 --> 00:17:15,200
My body is here,

205
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,661
but my soul isn't here.

206
00:17:18,537 --> 00:17:20,164
-How much?
-How much?

207
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:21,331
It's 500 baht.

208
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:23,125
You'll get a discount
if you buy two pairs.

209
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,502
Thank you.

210
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,047
Hey!

211
00:17:32,843 --> 00:17:33,844
I meanâ€¦

212
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:37,848
He went from that to owning a building?

213
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:41,560
Exactly. How did it happen?

214
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,480
If it wasn't the lottery, crypto,
or stocksâ€¦

215
00:17:45,397 --> 00:17:46,440
A business?

216
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,068
It's definitely not that.

217
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,778
His brain isn't wired for business.

218
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:54,740
Scratch that.
His brain isn't wired for anything.

219
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:57,326
After parting ways,

220
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:00,412
you don't think
he did something bad, do you?

221
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:08,045
His goal was to succeed
and find his way back to you.

222
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,091
But to live with youâ€¦

223
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:14,760
To buy this villa,

224
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:18,055
what exactly did he do?

225
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:32,694
"It's done."

226
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:38,492
It wasn't half bad.

227
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:49,920
I can still smell the egg.

228
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:10,232
-Hyeon-jae packed up and moved in.
-Okay.

229
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,735
When will you stop paying rent?

230
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:16,655
What kind of a question is that?
It's a tenant's duty.

231
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:20,075
Since there's one less person,
pay only half starting next month.

232
00:19:21,118 --> 00:19:22,161
No, thank you.

233
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:25,789
Can't you just say "Yes" for once?

234
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,417
No, I can't.

235
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,755
I'll take good care of Hyeon-jae,

236
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,883
so you take good care of Ae-yeon.

237
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,721
I sent him over to fix
his unrealistic hopes of entrepreneurship.

238
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:42,472
Don't cross the line.

239
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:47,352
By the way,

240
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:50,939
what did you mean
by what you said last time?

241
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,902
Even though you never wanted it,

242
00:19:55,944 --> 00:19:58,822
you're a parent. So take responsibility.

243
00:20:03,410 --> 00:20:04,578
If you don't know,

244
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,456
there's no need to find out.

245
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:32,105
How refreshing

246
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:35,025
That's right.

247
00:20:36,026 --> 00:20:37,986
There are only guys here.

248
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,113
This must be

249
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,408
the joy of independence!

250
00:20:46,662 --> 00:20:47,496
I don't

251
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,915
even know where to begin.

252
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,835
Father, I'm going out today.

253
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,337
May I borrow your clothes?

254
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:59,132
-Go ahead.
-Oh, yes!

255
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:08,934
What? What's this?

256
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:14,356
Hyeon-jae, wear this and this.
It's the most expensive item.

257
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:16,858
I can tell.

258
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,485
-I'll be careful with them!
-Okay.

259
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:25,367
Father, in my opinion,

260
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:29,121
Mom also likes you

261
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:31,415
this much.

262
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,126
That's more than I thought.

263
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,339
So you should keep pushing ahead.

264
00:21:39,423 --> 00:21:41,550
Be charismatic and manly.

265
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:45,470
Hyeon-jae.

266
00:21:47,055 --> 00:21:48,181
Don't you hate me?

267
00:21:49,266 --> 00:21:51,268
What? Why would I hate you?

268
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:53,895
To me, you're the all-time legend,

269
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:55,105
the Great Byeon-sby.

270
00:21:56,523 --> 00:21:57,357
All right.

271
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,404
Is this about Mi-rae?

272
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:05,782
She has always been like that.

273
00:22:08,869 --> 00:22:09,870
By the way,

274
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:13,248
when did your relationship with Mi-rae
start to sour?

275
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:15,959
Come to think of it,

276
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:19,379
the two of you were on bad terms
even before the snack bar went under.

277
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,426
Is it because of the gender difference?

278
00:22:24,509 --> 00:22:26,136
Mom and I don't get along either.

279
00:22:42,277 --> 00:22:45,238
FAMILY VILLA

280
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:56,875
I see that you don't have a lighter.

281
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:03,173
If you do, can I borrow it?

282
00:23:06,593 --> 00:23:07,677
I don't have one either.

283
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,013
I quit smoking years ago.

284
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,150
Hey.

285
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:32,536
You must've been very busy.

286
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,287
I couldn't reach you.

287
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,081
Yes, a little.

288
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,710
Then how are you going to score big?

289
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,296
What did you mean
by "Easy money is money easily lost"?

290
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:44,589
You won't tell me, right?

291
00:23:44,673 --> 00:23:46,508
I'll ask him then.

292
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:53,431
How are things with your wife?

293
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:57,185
Has she said anything to you?

294
00:23:58,186 --> 00:23:59,146
No, she hasn't.

295
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:02,649
But I found out.

296
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:06,778
About what?

297
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,407
Her jealousy.

298
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,453
-Pull over up there.
-Okay.

299
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,633
The sample and the actual product
are different, aren't they?

300
00:24:29,384 --> 00:24:31,636
No, they're the same.

301
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,014
It tastes better if you make it at home.

302
00:24:34,097 --> 00:24:35,765
When I fall for that and buy something,

303
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,934
it never tastes good
and there isn't much of it.

304
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:44,941
Ma'am.

305
00:24:45,483 --> 00:24:48,778
I'm sorry, but other customers
need to try samples too.

306
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,240
I haven't even eaten that much.

307
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,911
No, I didn't mean it like that.

308
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,580
Are you treating me like a beggar
for trying the sample?

309
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,916
-I meanâ€¦
-Wow, it's tteokbokki.

310
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:02,375
Let's see.

311
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:06,630
It's tasty.

312
00:25:06,713 --> 00:25:10,592
Both the maker and the seller
are quite talented.

313
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:11,593
Wouldn't you agree?

314
00:25:11,676 --> 00:25:13,178
-I agree.
-All right.

315
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,846
Not!

316
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:17,724
Forget it. I'm not buying this.
Take it back!

317
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:19,559
Okay, then I'll buy it.

318
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:20,894
I'll buy everything here.

319
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:31,821
Ae-yeon!

320
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:33,365
He's your ex-husband, isn't he?

321
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:37,619
No wonder men never catch your eye.
You have high standards.

322
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:41,998
With an ex-husband like that,
most men wouldn't be able to satisfy her.

323
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,501
I'll get going. See you tomorrow.

324
00:25:44,584 --> 00:25:45,835
-Butâ€¦
-I'm jealous, Ae-yeon.

325
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:47,587
-I'm so jealous.
-I know.

326
00:25:58,932 --> 00:25:59,933
Here.

327
00:26:01,434 --> 00:26:02,352
What's this?

328
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:07,691
It's an old-fashioned snack.

329
00:26:07,774 --> 00:26:09,109
You used to like it.

330
00:26:09,192 --> 00:26:12,153
You used to finish the entire bag
when I bought it for you.

331
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:14,990
Here.

332
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:18,159
Cold weather gives you indigestion.

333
00:26:18,243 --> 00:26:21,413
You have no husband to take care of you,
so take this supplement.

334
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:26,084
You get cold hands and feet too.

335
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:30,130
You have no husband to warm them up,
so use these.

336
00:26:31,089 --> 00:26:34,384
Is that a magic bag?
You're pulling stuff out of it endlessly.

337
00:26:36,177 --> 00:26:38,179
I have many other things to give you.

338
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,558
I'm sure you were too busy
looking after our kids

339
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:43,268
to take care of yourself.

340
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:47,022
I guess it shows how much I care.

341
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,983
Let's go.

342
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,277
I'll carry it home for you.

343
00:27:12,881 --> 00:27:15,675
This neighborhood hasn't changed at all.

344
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:19,637
I hope it always stays the same.
Don't you?

345
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:23,975
Why?

346
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,020
If this area ever gets redeveloped,

347
00:27:27,103 --> 00:27:29,397
you'd end up a lot richer, Mr. Landlord.

348
00:27:29,898 --> 00:27:31,232
Will you marry me again, then?

349
00:27:39,157 --> 00:27:40,825
What's wrong?

350
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:42,077
It's nothing.

351
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,245
Come here. Sit down.

352
00:27:45,413 --> 00:27:46,664
Let me see.

353
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,587
-What are you doing?
-Stay still.

354
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:58,510
You haven't gotten
your plantar fasciitis treated yet?

355
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:02,889
I was busy, so I missed some treatments.

356
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:04,766
I'm fine now.

357
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:06,059
Stay still.

358
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,228
Buy shoes with your own money.

359
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:12,232
We're already broken up.

360
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:14,442
If I buy you shoes,
you might go further away from me.

361
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,570
That'sâ€¦

362
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:22,659
Right.

363
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:24,285
High heelsâ€¦

364
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,457
I mean, shoes must have caused you
some trauma.

365
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:40,969
It's been a while
since I've seen you laugh.

366
00:28:45,932 --> 00:28:46,975
I missed it.

367
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,479
I finally got to see it.

368
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:26,306
RED CLAY HEATING PAD

369
00:29:42,155 --> 00:29:43,239
It tastes the same.

370
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,580
Byeon Moo-jin.

371
00:29:51,998 --> 00:29:53,875
Who exactly are you?

372
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:11,518
Should I tell her about Hyeon-jae
before the trip or when we get there?

373
00:30:13,061 --> 00:30:14,395
Or after the trip?

374
00:30:19,108 --> 00:30:21,402
Are you going to wash the duvet?
It's late.

375
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,363
What will I use tonight?

376
00:30:23,446 --> 00:30:26,366
It's time to wash it.
Use another blanket tonight.

377
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:27,951
Butâ€¦

378
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,832
Could it be a midlife crisis?

379
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,094
"Khun Mooy"?

380
00:30:46,177 --> 00:30:48,012
It was the name
President Byeon used in Thailand.

381
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:51,099
You don't think
he did something bad, do you?

382
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,684
Do you really have a carp tattoo?

383
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:59,732
You don't know
what I've done to come this far.

384
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:04,279
Will you marry me again, then?

385
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:15,707
Mom.

386
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,585
Let's go on a trip this weekend.

387
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,044
That's so sudden.

388
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,385
Let's do that. Shall we drive
to Incheon or Ganghwa Island?

389
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:30,471
-We're taking an airplane.
-To Jeju Island?

390
00:31:31,806 --> 00:31:34,350
Forget it. Let's just take a day trip.

391
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,727
No. We're going to Thailand.

392
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,728
What?

393
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:38,813
I've bought the tickets.

394
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,316
I can't get a refund since it's imminent.
We have to go.

395
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,527
Hey!

396
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,908
Why would I go to Thailand?
I don't like Thailand.

397
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:52,285
Don't be ridiculous.

398
00:31:52,368 --> 00:31:54,913
You were watching
home shopping travel deals every night.

399
00:31:58,374 --> 00:32:00,835
I told you not to waste money.

400
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:02,879
You should go by yourself.

401
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,798
Don't worry about me.
Get a good rest and enjoy yourself.

402
00:32:05,882 --> 00:32:07,759
Stop it and just come with me!

403
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,553
Besides, I can't leave you behind.
It would make someone happy.

404
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:13,765
Let's just go. Let's get a good rest,
replenish our energy,

405
00:32:13,848 --> 00:32:15,141
and talk about Hyeon-jae.

406
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,687
About Hyeon-jae? Why?

407
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:22,815
We're leaving on Friday,

408
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,860
so take the day off and finish packing.
Okay?

409
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:29,072
Ms. Byeon, we have to launch
Diver Tteokbokki this week.

410
00:32:29,155 --> 00:32:30,907
Why? It was scheduled for next week.

411
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:32,909
Sharp Mart is launching
Seafood Tteokbokki.

412
00:32:32,992 --> 00:32:35,328
We must start promotions
and increase sales this week.

413
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:36,496
CEO's orders.

414
00:32:37,622 --> 00:32:40,917
Ms. Byeon, you'll need to cancel
your annual leave scheduled for Friday.

415
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,631
I can't let that happen.

416
00:32:46,714 --> 00:32:49,384
What? You don't want to cancel
your annual leave?

417
00:32:49,467 --> 00:32:50,343
No.

418
00:32:52,345 --> 00:32:54,389
We can't lose to Sharp Mart.

419
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,602
Let's launch our product
one day before they do,

420
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,020
on Thursday.

421
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,898
Everything's in order on the second floor.

422
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,943
Please save me.

423
00:33:07,026 --> 00:33:09,988
They must be shipped out
before Wednesday night.

424
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:12,657
Yes, I know this calls for swearing.

425
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,159
Once we launch the product safely
on Thursday,

426
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,036
I'll let you swear all you want.

427
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,496
I just started the car.

428
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,248
Murphy's law for working professionals.

429
00:33:20,331 --> 00:33:21,708
An hour. No, 40 minutes.

430
00:33:21,791 --> 00:33:24,252
When you're running late,
the elevator always takes forever.

431
00:33:26,295 --> 00:33:29,215
When you have plans after work,
expect overtime or a team dinner.

432
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:31,718
When you get a bonus,
a big expense comes up suddenly.

433
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:36,389
When you plan a long-awaited vacation,

434
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:40,184
a huge emergency occurs. Howeverâ€¦

435
00:33:42,562 --> 00:33:44,313
We'll fill the Golden Zone
with Diver Tteokbokki.

436
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:46,607
Next to it, we'll place the tom yum goong.

437
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,527
Next to that, you'll place
the original tteokbokki, right?

438
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:52,447
Yes, the original tteokbokki.

439
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,660
Just you watch, Mr. Murphy.

440
00:33:57,744 --> 00:34:01,039
I'm not a worker you can easily mess with.

441
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:02,498
INTRODUCING DIVER TTEOKBOKKI

442
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,756
I thought you were nearly done
preparing for the launch.

443
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,508
-You should've had a proper lunch with us.
-Yes.

444
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,637
The egg makes it quite filling.
It's tasty too.

445
00:34:22,727 --> 00:34:23,811
What's that?

446
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:24,812
BANGKOK TRIP, PLAN A

447
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:25,772
PLAN B

448
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,773
A self-guided tour?

449
00:34:26,856 --> 00:34:27,774
PLAN C

450
00:34:27,857 --> 00:34:29,859
But there's no freedom in those plans.

451
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:33,112
There are many factors to consider
such as Mom's condition and the weather.

452
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:34,447
So I came up with Plans B and C.

453
00:34:35,573 --> 00:34:37,950
I'm an expert on Bangkok.
Do you need help?

454
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,578
Yes. Send me the address
of the best massage parlor

455
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:42,288
you found on Khaosan Road.

456
00:34:42,371 --> 00:34:44,332
-Okay.
-Ms. Byeon.

457
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,501
How many hours have you been awake?

458
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,629
Wellâ€¦ About 30 hours.

459
00:34:50,838 --> 00:34:56,344
It's okay. I'll sleep during the flight
and while I get my massage.

460
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:58,930
When I die, I'll get all the sleep I want.

461
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:02,100
No, I'm worried
you might drop dead before that.

462
00:35:10,274 --> 00:35:11,234
FATHER

463
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,917
Ms. Mi-rae!

464
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:30,503
Ms. Mi-rae!

465
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:40,721
You were sleeping?

466
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,141
I was taking a short nap.

467
00:35:44,225 --> 00:35:46,769
Thank you for waking me up.
See you tomorrow.

468
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:50,648
Can you give me a ride?

469
00:35:51,941 --> 00:35:55,153
Wellâ€¦ All right, get in.

470
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,621
Think of me as a chauffeur.

471
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,709
It looked like you were going to drive
in a drowsy state.

472
00:36:09,792 --> 00:36:13,379
If you'd gotten into an accident,
imagine how I'd feel.

473
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:18,217
He keeps catching me
in vulnerable moments.

474
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,262
He's the only one.

475
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:23,806
It's embarrassing.

476
00:36:24,682 --> 00:36:26,058
I'm such a nuisance.

477
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:28,477
You aren't a nuisance.

478
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:32,231
I'm actually relieved

479
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,233
that I'm the only one.

480
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:39,780
Did you live this diligently
when you were in school?

481
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:42,700
You never put off homework, did you?

482
00:36:47,663 --> 00:36:48,706
Delaying is pointless.

483
00:36:49,665 --> 00:36:53,377
In the end, the future Byeon Mi-rae
will have to take care of it anyway.

484
00:37:02,053 --> 00:37:02,887
You're cool.

485
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,768
I couldn't live that way.

486
00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,252
Pay for the chauffeur service later.

487
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:35,544
You'll have to pay big.

488
00:37:37,463 --> 00:37:39,048
How big?

489
00:37:41,634 --> 00:37:42,718
MISS AE-YEON

490
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,265
I'm in front of the villa.

491
00:37:52,144 --> 00:37:53,271
I'll get going now.

492
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,192
Okay, I'm going inside.

493
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,205
I'm home.

494
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:14,000
You worked so hard.

495
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,626
Are the preparations done?

496
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:19,171
Pretty much. Now the opening event
just needs to go well tomorrow.

497
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:24,343
Byeon Mi-rae,

498
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:28,764
once the new product launch
wraps up without a hitch,

499
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:32,101
stop working overtime,
and get off work on time.

500
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:36,230
Stop worrying about money,
and start worrying about your health.

501
00:38:37,565 --> 00:38:39,358
I can't let go of either one.

502
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,778
Have you forgotten about our goal?

503
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:44,572
Moving into a brand-new villa!

504
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,037
You spent so much money
on the plane tickets and travel expenses.

505
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,872
Come on, that'sâ€¦

506
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:57,501
You know,

507
00:38:57,585 --> 00:39:00,254
maybe I should've asked you
before booking the plane tickets.

508
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:05,843
You weren't serious about
not wanting to go, were you?

509
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:11,557
Hey, why would I be so ungrateful?

510
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,309
Let's go and get our money's worth.

511
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,728
Right?

512
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:18,481
Let's go and take photos
of our best moments.

513
00:39:18,564 --> 00:39:20,816
And let's borrow some clothes
from Jeong-in.

514
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:23,444
-Okay.
-Right. I bought sheet masks earlier.

515
00:39:23,527 --> 00:39:25,529
I'll put one on your face, so go wash up.

516
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:29,367
But I'm too tired to wash up.
What do I do?

517
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,868
Oh, my puppy.

518
00:39:30,951 --> 00:39:33,371
Still, you should wash up
since you're dirty.

519
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:59,772
Delaying is pointless.

520
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,442
In the end, the future Byeon Mi-rae
will have to take care of it anyway.

521
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,593
In the secular world

522
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:34,140
Under heaven's rule

523
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:40,479
In the East, the Republic of Korea

524
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,107
Is that him?

525
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,193
He's like a young version of the chairman.

526
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:50,072
Doesn't he resemble the chairman
more than Chi-yeol does?

527
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:53,451
I hope his behavior
doesn't resemble Chairman Nam's.

528
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:56,203
He gave everyone a headache
in his later years.

529
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,456
Still, he isn't half bad.

530
00:40:58,539 --> 00:41:01,333
He left home at an early age
without getting into trouble.

531
00:41:01,417 --> 00:41:02,585
What?

532
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,129
His birth itself was trouble enough.

533
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:07,756
It was trouble for the entire Nam family,
don't you agree?

534
00:41:08,257 --> 00:41:11,635
120-3, Iyeong-dongâ€¦

535
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,765
The deceased's son, Nam Chi-yeol

536
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,852
The deceased's daughter-in-law,
Jeong Mal-geum

537
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,770
The deceased's grandson, Nam Tae-pyeong

538
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:22,688
Tae-pyeong.

539
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:30,738
Tae-pyeong, your father is calling you.

540
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:09,860
By the way,

541
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,030
which father?

542
00:42:16,075 --> 00:42:17,201
This one

543
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:19,495
or that one?

544
00:42:30,881 --> 00:42:33,342
Nam Tae-pyeong!

545
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,139
Bowing and having a meal
would've been enough.

546
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:41,642
Did you have to cause trouble like that?

547
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,228
Before those gossipy Nam family members?

548
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,938
When will you grow up?

549
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:49,525
I left home early because I grew up.

550
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:50,776
You didn't grow up, okay?

551
00:42:50,859 --> 00:42:53,195
You're still hung up on the past.

552
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:56,490
You're a fool who can't even get
what's rightfully yours!

553
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,292
Be happy you got
what was rightfully yours.

554
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:10,879
For putting your younger half-brother

555
00:43:11,922 --> 00:43:14,925
on the family register as your son,

556
00:43:16,719 --> 00:43:18,304
you became the CEO.

557
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:26,145
Nam Tae-pyeong.

558
00:43:27,396 --> 00:43:28,564
Don't be fussy.

559
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:31,609
Something like that
isn't a big deal in this household.

560
00:43:32,526 --> 00:43:33,569
Exactly.

561
00:43:35,696 --> 00:43:37,781
That's why seeing
the members of this household

562
00:43:38,991 --> 00:43:40,200
makes me want to throw up.

563
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,961
Stop feeling a sense of responsibility
or duty toward me.

564
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,673
I can live well on my own.

565
00:43:57,926 --> 00:43:58,927
Okay.

566
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,015
Suit yourself, you punk.

567
00:44:24,828 --> 00:44:27,289
-Did you sleep on the third floor again?
-What?

568
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,417
Yes, I did.

569
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,295
Heading out to pick up things
for the trip?

570
00:44:33,379 --> 00:44:34,755
Have a nice shopping trip.

571
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,053
What's this?

572
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,764
-It's just a misunderstanding.
-A misunderstanding, my foot!

573
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,810
You'll live with your dad?

574
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:50,896
There are so many empty rooms
in Father's place.

575
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,482
You know that it's a place
for four people, right?

576
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,902
-I won't allow it.
-Why not?

577
00:44:56,985 --> 00:44:59,780
Mom, you've lived with me
for over 20 years.

578
00:44:59,863 --> 00:45:02,157
Let Father have his turn for a while.

579
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:07,621
I'll let you do it after graduation,
but not until then.

580
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,293
I'm going to quit school.

581
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:17,047
To be honest, I've been on
a leave of absence for a year.

582
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:21,718
What?

583
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,555
Mi-rae found out a few days ago
and pulled out my hair.

584
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:29,309
And Mi-rae is the one
who sent me to Father's place.

585
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:32,688
Mi-rae did that?

586
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,441
Attention, everyone.

587
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:39,736
Here. Look!

588
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,116
Look!

589
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:47,244
It's evidence of Ms. Byeon's sacrifice,
altruism, and survival instincts.

590
00:45:47,327 --> 00:45:50,330
You need to go all out like her
to meet the sales goal

591
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,291
on the very first day!

592
00:45:53,792 --> 00:45:59,214
-Ms. Byeon!
-Ms. Byeon!

593
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:02,759
Now, raise your glasses.
Let's empty this glass for Ms. Byeon.

594
00:46:02,843 --> 00:46:05,721
-There's someone we have.
-Ms. Byeon!

595
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,764
Someone who excites us!

596
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:08,891
-Ms. Byeon!
-Ms. Byeon!

597
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,225
Cheers!

598
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:13,395
-Ms. Byeon!
-Ms. Byeon!

599
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:21,111
When you looked at me
with a fire in your eyes and said,

600
00:46:21,195 --> 00:46:24,948
"Let's launch it on Thursday,"
I was scared, afraid, and intimidated.

601
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:27,659
But heroes of the world
have incredible subordinates.

602
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:31,538
Napoleon had cognac.
I have soju and beer and Byeon Mi-rae.

603
00:46:33,332 --> 00:46:35,667
I told you, Mr. Park. "Impossible is

604
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:37,211
-nothing"!
-Nothing!

605
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:38,795
Good.

606
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,842
Keep grilling meat
until there's a hole in the pan.

607
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,178
You can't go home
until there's a hole in the pan.

608
00:46:46,261 --> 00:46:48,138
-Drink. All right.
-Yes.

609
00:46:48,222 --> 00:46:49,056
MISS AE-YEON

610
00:46:49,139 --> 00:46:51,183
I'll wrap up before midnight
and head home.

611
00:46:51,266 --> 00:46:52,935
Go to bed first, Mom.

612
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:55,395
-Drink.
-Bottoms up.

613
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,484
Let's eat.

614
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,309
Good job.

615
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:39,439
-Can you break this into smaller bills?
-Okay.

616
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,662
Relax your right shoulder.

617
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:00,544
Hey, the ball!

618
00:48:03,755 --> 00:48:06,425
That could've been disastrous.

619
00:48:08,260 --> 00:48:09,094
What?

620
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:14,516
Hyeon-jae told me
you work here from time to time.

621
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:20,147
Geum Ae-yeon. You haven't lost your swing.

622
00:48:20,230 --> 00:48:22,608
I'm glad I taught you diligently
in my heyday.

623
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,910
Want to go for a drink?

624
00:48:44,171 --> 00:48:45,297
Thank you.

625
00:49:06,985 --> 00:49:10,405
Before we talk about Hyeon-jae,

626
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,452
I must hear the truth.

627
00:49:18,705 --> 00:49:19,539
What do you mean?

628
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:21,750
Byeon Moo-jin.

629
00:49:25,170 --> 00:49:28,590
What exactly did you do to make money?

630
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:36,682
Jeong-in briefly told me
about your time in Thailand.

631
00:49:37,474 --> 00:49:38,475
What did you do after?

632
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,145
How on earth
did you become rich overnight?

633
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:45,315
And why did you get a tattoo on your arm?

634
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:52,447
I just got it to cover up a scar.

635
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,449
Apparently, carps bring in money.

636
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:56,451
A scar?

637
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,793
Hey, Byeon Khun Mooy.

638
00:50:05,627 --> 00:50:07,713
Who exactly are you?

639
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,345
I've been good to people.

640
00:50:19,182 --> 00:50:21,143
Hey, Byeon Moo-jin.

641
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:22,894
I told you I've been good to people.

642
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,439
So don't worry about Hyeon-jae.

643
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,116
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

644
00:50:36,199 --> 00:50:38,660
Hey, let's have another round.

645
00:50:39,661 --> 00:50:41,079
Is the restroom outside?

646
00:50:41,163 --> 00:50:43,623
Building on the right.
The passcode is 3690.

647
00:51:10,984 --> 00:51:11,902
Have you been drinking?

648
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:16,531
Yes. We're having a team dinner.

649
00:51:17,783 --> 00:51:18,950
How about you?

650
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:23,747
I'm drinking alone.

651
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,084
Bye.

652
00:51:44,017 --> 00:51:46,895
-There is no hole in the pan yet.
-You should go.

653
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:50,106
My future, Byeon Mi-rae!
See you when you come back.

654
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,983
-Bye.
-Have a nice trip.

655
00:51:52,067 --> 00:51:54,152
-Get home safe!
-Get home safe!

656
00:51:54,236 --> 00:51:56,321
Let's go!

657
00:51:56,404 --> 00:52:00,325
-Thank you for your hard work.
-Thank you for your hard work.

658
00:52:00,408 --> 00:52:01,785
-Bye.
-Bye.

659
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:05,997
-Ms. Byeon, let's go together.
-I called a taxi.

660
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,666
-Okay.
-Have a safe trip home.

661
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,168
Oh, right. Ms. Byeon,

662
00:52:10,252 --> 00:52:12,212
bring me tom yum goong instant noodles.

663
00:52:12,295 --> 00:52:13,129
Okay.

664
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,998
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong!

665
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,333
What's going on?

666
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:58,383
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae?

667
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:03,430
How did you get into my place?

668
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,185
He didn't pass out. He's just wasted.

669
00:53:12,188 --> 00:53:13,648
It's cold.

670
00:53:27,787 --> 00:53:31,291
Hurrah! I scored 999 points!

671
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:37,756
I didn't know I'd have to pay so much
for the chauffeur service.

672
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:43,678
Where do you live?

673
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,389
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong, give me your address.

674
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:48,975
Ms. Mi-rae.

675
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,144
How old are you?

676
00:53:53,563 --> 00:53:54,814
I'm 29.

677
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:00,570
We're one year apart.

678
00:54:06,743 --> 00:54:07,744
Mi-rae.

679
00:54:09,412 --> 00:54:12,332
I should've just gone home.

680
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,709
Mi-rae,

681
00:54:16,753 --> 00:54:18,838
how did you grow up so fast?

682
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,968
I really should have.

683
00:54:25,011 --> 00:54:27,555
You're one to talk.

684
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,059
No.

685
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:35,897
I still act like a teenager.

686
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:39,609
I don't care about my family.

687
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,155
I want to throw away everything.

688
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,377
What?

689
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:03,341
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong?

690
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:08,013
You aren't home yet. Go sleep at home.

691
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:09,889
Hey, Nam Tae-pyeong!

692
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:17,897
This time, it's seriously dangerous!

693
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:22,027
Hey, stop drinking.

694
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:25,238
You said the drinks were on you.

695
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,408
Do you regret saying that?

696
00:55:30,618 --> 00:55:32,871
Are you upset because of Hyeon-jae?

697
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,468
Seriously,

698
00:55:48,470 --> 00:55:50,263
nothing's been done right.

699
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:56,561
He takes after his dad.

700
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,941
I'll do whatever it takes
to change his mind

701
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:03,651
and make him get his degree.

702
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,111
No!

703
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:07,530
I'm talking about myself.

704
00:56:07,614 --> 00:56:09,240
Me! Geum Ae-yeon!

705
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,951
I'm a mess of a mom.

706
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,122
What are you talking about?

707
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,420
Mi-rae grew up too fast.

708
00:56:25,006 --> 00:56:27,008
For Hyeon-jae, it's taking too long.

709
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:33,181
It's all because of me.

710
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:40,355
To be honest, I didn't even think

711
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,692
that he could go to college.

712
00:56:46,694 --> 00:56:49,197
Mi-rae persuaded, scolded, and coaxed him

713
00:56:50,156 --> 00:56:53,451
to get him to a four-year college
and paid his tuition.

714
00:56:57,664 --> 00:57:00,708
I left Hyeon-jae to Mi-rae.

715
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:06,673
You had to earn money after the divorce
to provide for the kids.

716
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:14,931
Why does it matter who you really are?

717
00:57:15,890 --> 00:57:17,725
I raised them.

718
00:57:18,685 --> 00:57:20,311
I'm the lacking parent.

719
00:57:21,688 --> 00:57:22,897
Stop talking nonsense.

720
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,359
Why isn't thereâ€¦

721
00:57:28,528 --> 00:57:31,448
a mom certification or something?

722
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:36,744
Dr. Oh Eun-young should've been born
a bit sooner.

723
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:38,997
Who's that?

724
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:40,748
Seriouslyâ€¦

725
00:57:43,293 --> 00:57:45,462
I'm too ashamed to face Mi-rae.

726
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,215
How can I call myself a mom?

727
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,180
Hey, are you crying?

728
00:57:55,263 --> 00:57:57,474
I'm not crying, okay?

729
00:57:57,557 --> 00:57:59,559
I have no right to cry.

730
00:58:36,262 --> 00:58:37,347
Why did our children

731
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:41,059
have to have parents like us

732
00:58:42,560 --> 00:58:44,562
and suffer like this?

733
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:52,195
You've always done well.

734
00:58:54,531 --> 00:58:55,782
It's all my fault.

735
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:09,921
I need to go home.

736
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:13,466
Okay. Hey! I'll walk you home.
It's the same building anyway.

737
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,302
Forget it.

738
00:59:27,605 --> 00:59:29,232
It's been ages since I heard this song.

739
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,155
It's the song they play at closing time.

740
00:59:38,074 --> 00:59:38,908
No wonder.

741
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,704
It's the owner's favorite song!

742
00:59:43,288 --> 00:59:45,039
This brings back memories.

743
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:46,916
At the age of 20,

744
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:49,586
some bat girl sang
and danced at the karaoke

745
00:59:49,669 --> 00:59:51,504
to seduce the cleanup hitter--

746
00:59:56,134 --> 00:59:57,176
Shut your mouth.

747
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:03,891
Geum Ae-yeon.

748
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,021
Have you ever felt lonely? Even just once?

749
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,690
No. Never.

750
01:00:17,905 --> 01:00:19,449
But I did get bored at times.

751
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:24,329
I didn't have anyone to fight with.

752
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:31,669
What am I talking about?

753
01:00:32,378 --> 01:00:33,338
Darn it!

754
01:00:33,421 --> 01:00:35,465
Hey, stop drinking.

755
01:00:35,548 --> 01:00:36,883
-Let go.
-Hey.

756
01:00:39,677 --> 01:00:41,888
Where are we going?

757
01:00:43,598 --> 01:00:45,016
Your place.

758
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:46,309
I see.

759
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:49,729
My place probably smells
like army barracks.

760
01:00:51,022 --> 01:00:52,982
Did I air it out in the morning?

761
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:55,318
I'll throw you in and leave right away.

762
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:57,612
I need to catch a flight in a few hours.

763
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:13,336
Don't go.

764
01:01:25,431 --> 01:01:26,933
The view from my place is

765
01:01:28,309 --> 01:01:29,394
really nice.

766
01:01:43,324 --> 01:01:45,368
Let go of me!

767
01:01:45,451 --> 01:01:46,911
Hey.

768
01:01:46,994 --> 01:01:49,706
You're going on a trip
with Mi-rae tomorrow.

769
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:51,708
I'm not going!

770
01:01:55,044 --> 01:01:59,674
I'm too ashamed to face my children.
Especially Mi-rae.

771
01:02:00,425 --> 01:02:02,218
I can't go home!

772
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,056
All right. Then don't go.

773
01:02:11,978 --> 01:02:13,062
Let's go to my place.

774
01:02:13,730 --> 01:02:15,356
There are many empty rooms.

775
01:02:15,440 --> 01:02:18,192
You can sleep on the bed,
and I can sleep on the floor.

776
01:02:18,276 --> 01:02:19,986
Okay? Let's go.

777
01:02:20,069 --> 01:02:21,988
Get up.

778
01:02:22,071 --> 01:02:23,364
Let go.

779
01:02:25,283 --> 01:02:26,325
Byeon Moo-jin.

780
01:02:26,826 --> 01:02:30,246
You can sleep on the floor all you want.

781
01:02:33,291 --> 01:02:35,835
I'll sleep over there,
so mind your own business.

782
01:02:38,087 --> 01:02:39,964
Hey.

783
01:02:40,047 --> 01:02:42,675
-Come on.
-Mind your own business.

784
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:44,010
Let go of me.

785
01:02:44,093 --> 01:02:45,428
Hold on.

786
01:02:45,511 --> 01:02:48,181
What's this? Is it broken?

787
01:02:48,264 --> 01:02:50,057
Hey, give me that.

788
01:02:51,309 --> 01:02:52,435
What?

789
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:54,479
The light is on.

790
01:03:07,533 --> 01:03:08,451
Whatâ€¦

791
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:09,494
Byeon Mi-rae.

792
01:03:09,577 --> 01:03:11,954
-Mom.
-Whatâ€¦

793
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:15,166
What are you doing here?

794
01:03:16,375 --> 01:03:17,543
What are you doing here?

795
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:27,136
What theâ€¦

796
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,889
Youâ€¦ You!

797
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:31,974
What are you two doing here?

798
01:03:32,850 --> 01:03:34,101
Hold on. Calm down.

799
01:03:34,185 --> 01:03:36,187
I can explain. Okay?

800
01:03:36,771 --> 01:03:40,066
No. Nothing will explain this situation.

801
01:03:41,943 --> 01:03:45,738
Ma'am. Sir. I can explain.

802
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,281
You jerk!

803
01:03:49,116 --> 01:03:52,870
Question number one, you see
your daughter at a motel with a man.

804
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:53,830
Let go.

805
01:03:53,913 --> 01:03:57,959
Number two, you see your mom at a motel
with her ex-husband.

806
01:03:58,042 --> 01:03:59,502
I'm sorry. You can grab my hair!

807
01:03:59,585 --> 01:04:02,338
-Okay!
-My goodness.

808
01:04:03,089 --> 01:04:06,384
Which would make you want to
kill yourself more?

809
01:04:07,468 --> 01:04:08,845
Why did you come here?

810
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:14,892
Why are you here?

811
01:04:15,560 --> 01:04:17,436
-Mom, are you crazy?
-Are you crazy?

812
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,190
What on earth is happening?

813
01:04:21,274 --> 01:04:24,068
Youâ€¦ You wench!

814
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,823
You wench!

815
01:04:33,244 --> 01:04:36,038
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

816
01:05:00,563 --> 01:05:02,690
What are you going to do
with President Byeon?

817
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:05,443
Why did you take those attacks
without a word?

818
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:07,945
Why did you interfere?

819
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:10,615
You can't have both. I'll leave the house

820
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,574
for good.

821
01:05:11,657 --> 01:05:12,658
I need to look for her.

822
01:05:12,742 --> 01:05:14,869
-Mom!
-Calm down.

823
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,454
Let go of me!

824
01:05:16,537 --> 01:05:18,539
I need to take care of you today.

825
01:05:18,623 --> 01:05:20,207
-Let's go.
-Where?

826
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:21,459
My place.

827
01:05:21,542 --> 01:05:24,795
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong,
why do you keep doing this to me?

828
01:05:25,922 --> 01:05:27,214
Do you really not know?

829
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:32,845
