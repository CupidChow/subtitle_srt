00:00:48,173 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:54,137 --> 00:00:56,765
FAMILY VILLA

3
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:00,935
What?

4
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,786
I think both Mom and Dad slept out
last night.

5
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:22,707
Now that the misunderstanding
has been cleared up,

6
00:01:22,791 --> 00:01:23,917
nothing can hold them back.

7
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:30,131
Hey.

8
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:32,717
Shouldn't your sister be up by now?

9
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,011
I forgot about her!

10
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,055
What?

11
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:41,851
Isn't it time to go to the airport?

12
00:01:45,772 --> 00:01:47,106
She isn't home either.

13
00:01:55,281 --> 00:01:56,699
You wench!

14
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,706
Byeon Mi-rae, you wench!

15
00:02:04,749 --> 00:02:06,292
-Get out! Run!
-Okay!

16
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,086
Move out of the way!

17
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,587
-Hey!
-Mom, how could you…

18
00:02:09,671 --> 00:02:10,797
Hey!

19
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:11,714
Hey!

20
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,384
Byeon Mi-rae!

21
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:51,212
What's that?

22
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:57,969
Did you move out?

23
00:03:01,264 --> 00:03:02,724
What do people usually do

24
00:03:03,975 --> 00:03:05,184
on their weekdays off?

25
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:10,315
They go to places
others would go on weekends.

26
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:17,864
Like that place?

27
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:29,500
Byeon Moo-jin.

28
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:32,879
Byeon Moo-jin!

29
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,763
-Have you sobered up?
-Move.

30
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,226
Did you come to your senses?

31
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,978
I said, move. I'm going home.

32
00:03:50,897 --> 00:03:53,274
Use words, not violence.

33
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,735
Mi-rae's all grown up. She's an adult.

34
00:03:57,820 --> 00:03:58,655
She's my daughter!

35
00:04:00,615 --> 00:04:02,951
Would you have kept quiet
if it were Hyeon-jae?

36
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,244
She's also your daughter.

37
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,038
Although Mi-rae is our child,

38
00:04:07,121 --> 00:04:08,998
she's smarter than us.

39
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,250
You know that very well.

40
00:04:13,795 --> 00:04:16,756
You should go and listen
to what Mi-rae has to say first.

41
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,716
I'm sure she had her reasons. Okay?

42
00:04:22,637 --> 00:04:25,723
Then where did she go with the suitcase?

43
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:27,141
E-TICKET

44
00:04:28,184 --> 00:04:29,560
This brat…

45
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,778
Mom. You can't have both.

46
00:04:39,404 --> 00:04:41,990
If you get back together with Father,

47
00:04:42,073 --> 00:04:44,659
I'll leave the house

48
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:45,952
for good.

49
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:05,346
MI-RAE

50
00:05:11,936 --> 00:05:14,772
The person you have called is unavailable…

51
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:26,034
The person you have called…

52
00:05:30,621 --> 00:05:34,917
Mi-rae won't pick up
even if you call her 100 times now.

53
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,002
He's right.

54
00:05:36,085 --> 00:05:38,671
She'll come home after she cools down.

55
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,675
MISS AE-YEON

56
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,263
MISSED CALL

57
00:05:47,346 --> 00:05:48,181
MISS AE-YEON

58
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,643
Let me take it.

59
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,022
It's okay.

60
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,775
You're exhausted.

61
00:05:58,858 --> 00:06:00,443
I'm not.

62
00:06:02,153 --> 00:06:04,363
It's heavy. Just let me take it.

63
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:06,324
I told you, it's okay.

64
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,618
Just let me take it!

65
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:14,415
Are you okay?

66
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,337
I told you that it was okay!

67
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,260
This wouldn't have happened
if you weren't so stubborn.

68
00:06:26,844 --> 00:06:29,347
What's so stubborn
about carrying my own suitcase?

69
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,308
Darn it.

70
00:06:38,773 --> 00:06:41,025
-Let's go.
-To where?

71
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,860
My place.

72
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,411
Where are you going?

73
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:53,579
I need to look for her.

74
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,124
-Ae-yeon!
-Where will you find her?

75
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:59,043
-You looking for a needle in a haystack?
-Hold on!

76
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:02,797
Hold on. Ae-yeon, calm down first.

77
00:07:03,965 --> 00:07:04,966
-Ae-yeon!
-Mom!

78
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,759
-Where are you going?
-My goodness.

79
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,929
-Ae-yeon, calm down.
-Mom!

80
00:07:10,012 --> 00:07:11,305
Let go of me!

81
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,599
Hey.

82
00:07:13,683 --> 00:07:15,643
Where are you going? To find Mi-rae?

83
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,353
Let go of me.

84
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,980
Hold on.

85
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,733
Why are you sweating so much?

86
00:07:23,943 --> 00:07:26,028
You have a fever too. You must be sick.

87
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,572
Let go of me!

88
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,868
Are you okay? Let's go inside.

89
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,953
Move out of the way. Let's go in.

90
00:07:34,036 --> 00:07:35,079
Let go of me!

91
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,914
Hey, you guys go home.

92
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:40,501
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

93
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:42,211
Let's go inside.

94
00:07:42,295 --> 00:07:45,798
Geum Medal, be quiet.

95
00:07:48,676 --> 00:07:50,261
Are you from the Bonghwa Geum Clan too?

96
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:53,931
It seems so.

97
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:57,560
Is that your room? Let's go.

98
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,729
Let's go inside. Come on.

99
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:03,024
There you go.

100
00:08:04,108 --> 00:08:05,568
-Hey.
-Lie down.

101
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,278
Hey!

102
00:08:08,321 --> 00:08:10,364
Hey, don't go anywhere.

103
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:12,742
-I'll make porridge and pick up medicine.
-No.

104
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,328
Please. You have a high fever!

105
00:08:18,623 --> 00:08:20,124
It's the alcohol.

106
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,584
What?

107
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,923
I'm not sick.

108
00:08:27,715 --> 00:08:29,091
I'm hungover.

109
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,178
Oh…

110
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,111
It's this building here.

111
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,327
Actually, I should just go.

112
00:08:58,454 --> 00:09:00,581
Thank you for trying to help out.

113
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,169
I must take care of you today.

114
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:09,340
I won't ask you for a laundry service fee,
so give it here.

115
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:13,386
Ms. Mi-rae, you left home.

116
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,480
-Hold on.
-What?

117
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:27,191
What?

118
00:09:31,112 --> 00:09:33,030
They're my friends who live downstairs.

119
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:36,409
I run Yong Dong Taekwondo.

120
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,245

of Korean traditional martial arts,

121
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,538
Cho Hak-seung.

122
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,874
Hello. I'm Tae-pyeong's colleague
and friend,

123
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,543
Son Hyeong-ki. Hi-yah!

124
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,172
I'm Byeon Mi-rae.

125
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,758
Please go inside.

126
00:09:52,842 --> 00:09:55,136
No, I was about to leave.

127
00:09:55,219 --> 00:09:56,178
What?

128
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,180
In that state?

129
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:03,769
Are you hungry?

130
00:10:35,259 --> 00:10:38,679
EPISODE 7
OUR HOME GROUND

131
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:47,897
Come in.

132
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:52,818
Get changed and come on out.
I'll prepare a meal.

133
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:54,487
Okay.

134
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,255
What am I doing here?

135
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,027
I'll eat quickly and leave.

136
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:48,332
What?

137
00:11:53,045 --> 00:11:55,005
What's up with these clothes?

138
00:11:56,298 --> 00:11:59,051
Let's go and take photos
of our best moments.

139
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,886
Let's borrow clothes from Jeong-in.

140
00:12:01,470 --> 00:12:02,471
Oh, no!

141
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:17,987
She's the one
who's been on your mind, right?

142
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,032
When did you get so close enough
to invite her home?

143
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,994
We'll be on our best behavior today,

144
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,538
-so set us up with her friends.
-Please.

145
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:29,540
My room doesn't smell bad, does it?

146
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:59,361
Ms. Mi-rae, please sit here.

147
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:01,864
Let me go to my room for a second.

148
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:07,203
Please sit.

149
00:13:14,210 --> 00:13:17,546
Ms. Mi-rae, your outfit is perfect
for our rooftop omakase.

150
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:18,964
"Omakase"?

151
00:13:19,048 --> 00:13:21,967
Yes, there'll be
pork belly, pork neck, and pork jowl

152
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:23,969
as well as fried rice.

153
00:13:24,887 --> 00:13:26,430
I see.

154
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:35,272
You'll be cold
if you stay out here for long.

155
00:13:49,203 --> 00:13:51,956
Tae-pyeong, can I ask
how the two of you met?

156
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,083
If you don't mind.

157
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:57,169
She works at the mart.
She's a food merchandiser.

158
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:01,131
So she got close to you
as you guys kept running into each other.

159
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,844
Right. People prefer to meet someone
naturally these days.

160
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:08,597
No, they prefer to start dating
after sleeping together now.

161
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,557
You punk.

162
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,725
Just shut up and eat your food, you punk.

163
00:14:23,612 --> 00:14:24,697
Is it good?

164
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:26,782
Yes.

165
00:14:33,706 --> 00:14:34,999
It's very good.

166
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:38,043
Now that

167
00:14:39,461 --> 00:14:40,921
you've filled your belly,

168
00:14:41,922 --> 00:14:43,007
why don't we have a drink?

169
00:14:43,674 --> 00:14:45,593
-Don't be ridiculous.
-I asked Ms. Mi-rae.

170
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,094
I answered on her behalf.

171
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,097
Give me a glass.
Pork belly calls for some soju.

172
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:54,018
All right. Shall we have a glass each?

00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,416

00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,306
Oh, you did?

185
00:16:22,231 --> 00:16:26,110
Hey, you sent me the wrong amount.

186
00:16:26,193 --> 00:16:28,612
You added an extra zero by mistake.

187
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:32,157
For goodness' sake. President Byeon,
how could you be so clumsy?

188
00:16:33,117 --> 00:16:35,911
What would you do without me?

189
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,329
Jae-geol.

190
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,373
Just let me know if you need money.

191
00:16:48,215 --> 00:16:49,383
This punk.

192
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,846
He knows everything.

193
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:56,974
Damn it!

194
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,532
I picked up some hangover soup for you.

195
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,556
JPLUS SUPERVISOR BYEON MI-RAE

196
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,689
The person you have called is unavailable…

197
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,526
This brat…

198
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:56,617
What?

199
00:17:57,618 --> 00:18:00,579
I came to make you some ramyeon,
but it looks like you already ate.

200
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:19,473
Ae-yeon, what are you going to do
with President Byeon?

201
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:22,726
Listen.

202
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,645
Boyfriend.

203
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,646
Husband.

204
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,231
Stranger.

205
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:31,819
Among those three options,
which one do you really want?

206
00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:34,738
Don't you think
it's about time to make up your mind?

207
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:42,746
I'm worried that you'll ruin
your relationship with your daughter.

208
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:54,007
By the way,

209
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:58,262
why are President Byeon and Mi-rae
on such bad terms?

210
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,974
It's my fault.

211
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:10,524
To Mi-rae,

212
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:14,444
I bad-mouthed her dad too much.

213
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:19,533
Every time Byeon Moo-jin caused trouble

214
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:23,162
and I had to clean up his mess
with gritted teeth,

215
00:19:24,454 --> 00:19:26,165
I turned to Mi-rae

216
00:19:28,041 --> 00:19:29,710
and vented to her.

217
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,799
But once she was all grown-up,

218
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:38,969
I saw on TV…

219
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,808
that it's how mothers…

220
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:51,815
use their daughters
as their emotional trash can.

221
00:19:59,781 --> 00:20:00,908
You only did that…

222
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,872
because things were tough for you too.

223
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:10,167
Mi-rae was the only one you could lean on.

224
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,176
It's all my fault
that she's like this now,

225
00:20:22,012 --> 00:20:24,306
so how could I get back together
with Byeon Moo-jin?

226
00:20:29,353 --> 00:20:31,355
It doesn't matter how I feel.

227
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,456
-Hey, get up.
-What?

228
00:20:49,539 --> 00:20:51,667
Hurry up. Go downstairs. Be careful.

229
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,877
-All right.
-Let's go.

230
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:19,903
MISS AE-YEON:

231
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,197
Byeon Mi-rae, I know.

232
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:27,035
You must've had your reasons,
and that I let you down.

233
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:29,162
But

234
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:31,873
I had my reasons too.

235
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,168
Let's talk face-to-face.

236
00:21:35,961 --> 00:21:37,129
Call me.

237
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,172
Okay?

238
00:21:53,854 --> 00:21:55,272
Just leave it.

239
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:56,898
I'll clean this up and leave.

240
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,529
Would you like another drink?

241
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,344
Have a seat.

242
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:43,278
There isn't much in the house
because I live alone, right?

243
00:22:45,155 --> 00:22:48,617
Your place is quite simple.
It's so like you.

244
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,538
What's your room like?

245
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:57,167
My mom is in charge of it.

246
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:14,643
Can I ask why you're so upset?

247
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:20,232
It's simple.

248
00:23:21,441 --> 00:23:23,735
I hate the idea of the person
I love the most

249
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:27,030
getting back together
with the person I hate the most.

250
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,661
I grew up watching

251
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:35,664
how much my mom struggled.

252
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:45,382
They should've never met
in the first place.

253
00:23:51,221 --> 00:23:52,222
If they hadn't met,

254
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,475
you wouldn't have been born.

255
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,938
That would've been better.

256
00:24:11,199 --> 00:24:13,952
I know how it feels to think
that it would've been better

257
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:17,831
not to have been born.

258
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:24,254
Especially when I see people
who make fun of my very existence.

259
00:24:28,592 --> 00:24:30,010
CEO Nam Chi-yeol is

260
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,471
my father on paper.

261
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,726
But he's actually my brother.

262
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,482
One day, Grandpa came home
with a newborn out of nowhere.

263
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,486
But he couldn't let anyone know

264
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:50,488
that the baby was his child.

265
00:24:52,407 --> 00:24:56,494
Father thought it was a win-win situation
to opt out of a fight over inheritance

266
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,833
by accepting his newborn brother
as his son.

267
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,755
After I found out in middle school,

268
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:10,383
I left home and lived in a dormitory.

269
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,680
Were you okay?

270
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:22,979
Strangely, I wasn't that surprised.

271
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,149
In hindsight,

272
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:30,820
Grandpa particularly doted on me.

273
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:35,033
And Mother was particularly cold to me.

274
00:25:37,244 --> 00:25:38,370
And Father…

275
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:44,542
He thinks it's his fate
to do his fatherly duty

276
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:47,796
until the very end.

277
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,173
Though there's no need to do that now.

278
00:25:53,969 --> 00:25:56,596
It must've taken a very long time
to tell this story

279
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:00,183
without getting emotional.

280
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:06,022
I have no sense of responsibility.

281
00:26:07,023 --> 00:26:08,692
I'm just pretending to be carefree

282
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:12,821
when I'm actually running away.

283
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,895
It's okay to run away.

284
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,399
It isn't your fault.

285
00:26:54,863 --> 00:26:58,199
And it's a good thing that you were born.

286
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,412
You're doing great.

287
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,308
You too.

288
00:27:40,533 --> 00:27:41,743
Mr. Nam Tae-pyeong,

289
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:45,705
why do you keep doing this to me?

290
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:54,714
Do you really not know?

291
00:28:15,443 --> 00:28:18,696
Oh, it's getting late. I should get going.

292
00:28:19,489 --> 00:28:20,782
Where will you go at this hour?

293
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:23,410
Just sleep here. I can sleep downstairs.

294
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,453
I'm going back home.

295
00:28:26,079 --> 00:28:27,205
I'm serious. Don't worry.

296
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:28,665
Then I'll take you home.

297
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,418
I called a taxi.
It's coming. It'll arrive in one minute.

298
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:32,585
I'll get going.

299
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,422
But…

300
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,387
Bye.

301
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,811
SEONGBON HOSPITAL

302
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:55,692
Thank you for coming.

303
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,570
Of course, we came. He was our teacher.

304
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:00,321
-Please enjoy the food.
-Okay.

305
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,869
By the way, isn't Byeon Moo-jin coming?

306
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,412
I wonder too.

307
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:10,415
Our teacher looked after him so much.

308
00:29:10,498 --> 00:29:12,500
The bottom of the class, Moo-ron.

309
00:29:12,584 --> 00:29:13,668
That's right.

310
00:29:13,752 --> 00:29:17,005
It was the teacher's goal
to make him learn the basic knowledge.

311
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:21,217
He left the task
to our President Oh, the top of the class.

312
00:29:21,301 --> 00:29:25,346
I heard he played pro baseball shortly,
but he has been struggling ever since.

313
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,600
That's right. He called me once years ago.

314
00:29:28,683 --> 00:29:31,311
He asked me if he could
borrow some money from me.

315
00:29:31,394 --> 00:29:33,730
He said he got scammed
and needed it urgently.

316
00:29:34,856 --> 00:29:37,484
Jae-geol, didn't he call you?

317
00:29:37,567 --> 00:29:40,612
He would've called you first.

318
00:29:50,497 --> 00:29:55,126
Why would I keep in touch
with that bastard, Byeon Moo-jin?

319
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:58,171
Unbelievable.

320
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:01,424
Hey, do you think Byeon Moo-jin

321
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,470
can dare to sit at the same table as me?

322
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:10,642
He used to crawl on the floor
without a penny.

323
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:13,645
That bastard hasn't changed at all.

324
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,689
He can't do anything right!

325
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,609
He's just a stupid bastard

326
00:30:19,692 --> 00:30:23,112
who's incapable of doing anything
but got extremely lucky!

327
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,281
Hey. Stop.

328
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,950
What's your problem, you bastard?

329
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,244
-He's here.
-Keep it down.

330
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:41,381
I'll come back
just before the funeral cortege leaves.

331
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:42,507
Thank you.

332
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,395
Byeon Moo-jin!

333
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:03,361
I sent back the money you gave me.

334
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:06,155
I can send it right back to you.

335
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:08,992
I don't want it!

336
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:15,039
And find yourself another tax accountant.

337
00:31:15,123 --> 00:31:15,999
Oh Jae-geol.

338
00:31:16,833 --> 00:31:18,960
Why are you mad at me
when you're in the wrong?

339
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,881
If you don't like the bonus, let's say
that it's early condolence money.

340
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,465
Bye.

341
00:31:29,596 --> 00:31:32,557
Byeon Moo-jin, you think you're so great?

342
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,353
-So you lash out when you're embarrassed.
-Hey!

343
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,902
Stop trying to lead me by the nose.

344
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,904
Just… Just report me.

345
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:48,656
Put me behind bars for embezzlement!

346
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,367
-"Embezzlement"?
-Seriously. What's that about?

347
00:31:51,451 --> 00:31:52,702
Oh Jae-geol?

348
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:56,623
I thought
you deserved a few dozen million.

349
00:31:57,624 --> 00:31:59,000
That was why I sent the money.

350
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:03,254
So stop complaining
and continue to be my tax accountant.

351
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:05,465
I won't accept your resignation.

352
00:32:10,261 --> 00:32:11,262
Hey.

353
00:32:12,096 --> 00:32:12,931
Hey!

354
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:16,017
Damn it.

355
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,459
Thank you for coming.

356
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,420
How did you know my father?

357
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,298
On my first child's first birthday,

358
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,302
Mr. Park somehow found out about it
although I hadn't told anyone,

359
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:54,889
and sent a gold ring for the baby.

360
00:32:57,642 --> 00:32:59,477
He was a good man.

361
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,409
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin!

362
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,288
Mr. Byeon.

363
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,166
It's me, Yang Cheol-hong.

364
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:25,753
I was your direct junior
back in our Dragons days.

365
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:27,422
Right. It has been a while.

366
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:29,507
Do you remember me?

367
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:33,052
Man, it's been so long.

368
00:33:34,929 --> 00:33:38,725
Right. You must be here for a funeral.

369
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:42,145
Aren't you here
for our former coach, Mr. Park's funeral?

370
00:33:43,396 --> 00:33:46,399
Did Mr. Park pass away?

371
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:47,817
Yes, he had a chronic illness.

372
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,403
Aren't you here
because you received the news?

373
00:33:50,945 --> 00:33:51,863
Well,

374
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:55,241
I changed my number
and I quit baseball ages ago.

375
00:33:57,368 --> 00:34:00,997
Anyway, I saw you on TV from time to time.

376
00:34:01,914 --> 00:34:05,126
It feels like only yesterday
that you went to join Major League.

377
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:09,130
But not too long ago, you had
a fancy retirement ceremony

378
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,300
-and went back to the Dragons.
-Yes.

379
00:34:12,383 --> 00:34:14,635
They hired me as a coach,
so I'm working hard.

380
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:16,929
It's all thanks to you.

381
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:20,016
You were my role model.

382
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:23,561
Right. This is my wife.

383
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:25,313
Honey, you know Mr. Byeon Moo-jin.

384
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:29,525
I've heard a lot about you.
You're my husband's savior.

385
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,281
Did you see him?
Wasn't he Yang Cheol-hong?

386
00:34:35,364 --> 00:34:37,658
No way. How fascinating.

387
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,911
I can't believe I saw him here.

388
00:34:39,994 --> 00:34:41,079
Yang Cheol-hong?

389
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:49,045
He always talked about
how he would've remained number two

390
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:51,089
had you stayed on the team.

391
00:34:51,172 --> 00:34:52,548
Thus, you're our savior

392
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:56,260
who passed down
the title of Korea's cleanup hitter.

393
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:01,599
He had to leave due to a shoulder injury,

394
00:35:01,682 --> 00:35:04,435
so I felt like I had stolen his position.

395
00:35:04,519 --> 00:35:07,063
I felt like I was winning in life alone.

396
00:35:08,648 --> 00:35:11,234
By the way, is your wife doing well?

397
00:35:13,361 --> 00:35:14,195
Cheol-hong.

398
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:18,574
-That's enough.
-What?

399
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,244
-What did I do?
-Just…

400
00:35:21,327 --> 00:35:22,745
Go inside and attend the funeral.

401
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:25,331
-Moo-jin.
-Isn't that Byeon Moo-jin?

402
00:35:25,915 --> 00:35:28,167
-It's him, right? It's him.
-He's with Cheol-hong.

403
00:35:28,251 --> 00:35:30,086
So you are alive.

404
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:33,089
Everyone, Mr. Byeon Moo-jin is here.

405
00:35:33,172 --> 00:35:35,508
God, it's been so long.

406
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:37,760
Moo-jin!

407
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,881
Geum Ae-yeon,
what are you doing right now?

408
00:36:17,425 --> 00:36:20,136
-You're late.
-Ae-yeon, what are you doing here?

409
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:22,138
I thought you were too busy to come.

410
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,850
I've already paid my respects to Mr. Park.

411
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,187
Ms. Geum.

412
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,771
It's you, right?

413
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,065
Do you remember me? I'm Yang Cheol-hong.

414
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,694
Yes, Cheol-hong! Of course, I remember.

415
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:40,615
You were his minion
who used to follow Moo-jin around.

416
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:48,789
-There are so many familiar faces here.
-Hello.

417
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:52,251
We only meet on such occasions
since we're busy making a living.

418
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:53,544
By the way,

419
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:57,965
-I met our tax accountant earlier today.
-"Our"?

420
00:36:58,049 --> 00:37:01,802
They're making us pay
tens of millions of won in taxes.

421
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:05,806
Owning buildings isn't lucrative anymore.

422
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,352
Honey, should we
just sell all the buildings we own?

423
00:37:09,936 --> 00:37:11,520
"All the buildings"?

424
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:15,191
You must own many buildings.

425
00:37:16,192 --> 00:37:17,026
Yes.

426
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:20,738
I won't say how much they're worth.

427
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:22,949
People will get jealous.

428
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,662
Cheol-hong, you're on fire these days.

429
00:37:27,745 --> 00:37:29,956
You were recruited as a coach
right after retirement.

430
00:37:31,499 --> 00:37:32,708
I'm working hard.

431
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:37,004
Yes. You should work really hard.

432
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:39,757
The Dragons rarely win these days.

433
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,134
We didn't do so well this season.

434
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:44,929
Even if the team comes in last,

435
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:49,392
you'll always be
the nation's cleanup hitter.

436
00:37:49,475 --> 00:37:51,644
Well… Right.

437
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:55,022
We'll get going now.

438
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,192
-See you around, Cheol-hong.
-Sure.

439
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:08,119
I'm so jealous.

440
00:38:15,167 --> 00:38:16,460
What a snake!

441
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,630
How dare he humiliate you
with that smirk on his face?

442
00:38:19,714 --> 00:38:22,049
-How far are we going?
-Until those jerks can't see us!

443
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
You can stop now.

444
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,889
Byeon Moo-jin, are you a fool?

445
00:38:29,849 --> 00:38:32,393
Why did you let him
humiliate you like that?

446
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,312
And why did you interfere?

447
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,647
Why did you lie?

448
00:38:38,232 --> 00:38:41,152
Even if we act like we're doing great,

449
00:38:41,235 --> 00:38:42,820
as if we're happy,

450
00:38:42,903 --> 00:38:45,239
and successful, nothing changes.

451
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:54,582
I see what it is.

452
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:58,419
It's all about your damn ego
as a baseball player.

453
00:39:04,383 --> 00:39:05,343
I'm sorry.

454
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:08,846
I didn't know it'd still matter to you.

455
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:09,764
Ae-yeon.

456
00:39:18,439 --> 00:39:19,482
Byeon Moo-jin.

457
00:39:20,900 --> 00:39:22,735
Do you know what your biggest problem is?

458
00:39:27,448 --> 00:39:30,117
You think you're the only one
who had to give up something

459
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:33,037
so important in your life.

460
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:36,791
You only think about yourself.

461
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,131
Byeon Mi-rae.

462
00:40:38,978 --> 00:40:39,979
Let's go inside.

463
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:10,259
I asked Father
to take care of Hyeon-jae temporarily

464
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:11,927
just until he comes back to his senses.

465
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,058
Okay.

466
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:25,399
That's why I had some drinks.

467
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,903
I couldn't believe
I drove you to make such a decision.

468
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,155
I was so embarrassed of myself…

469
00:41:33,157 --> 00:41:35,242
that I couldn't face you.

470
00:41:36,202 --> 00:41:37,828
That was why I went there.

471
00:41:40,873 --> 00:41:42,041
That was all.

472
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,544
You know that, right?

473
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,881
I know.

474
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:56,722
I'm sorry for making you worry.

475
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,102
You're back now, so it's all good.

476
00:42:05,564 --> 00:42:09,693
Byeon Moo-jin was worried about you too,
thinking it was his fault.

477
00:42:19,662 --> 00:42:22,540
Were you with him while I was away?

478
00:42:24,458 --> 00:42:25,292
In our house?

479
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:27,628
No. Actually…

480
00:42:29,755 --> 00:42:30,881
I understand.

481
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,134
Understand what?

482
00:42:34,218 --> 00:42:35,553
I'll mind my own business.

483
00:42:35,636 --> 00:42:38,556
Date him if you want.
I'll stop getting in the way like a child.

484
00:42:38,639 --> 00:42:41,850
Byeon Mi-rae,
what's with you, all of a sudden?

485
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,103
You guys will break up soon anyway.

486
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,357
I'll go to bed now.

487
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:50,901
Byeon Mi-rae!

488
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:53,654
You haven't told the truth yet.

489
00:42:54,238 --> 00:42:55,948
Why were you there with that guy?

490
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,910
You were at the team dinner.
Was he there too?

491
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:05,332
I guess he must've gotten very drunk.

492
00:43:06,792 --> 00:43:09,128
Of course, you didn't have his address.

493
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:11,171
You couldn't leave him on the street.

494
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:16,719
That was why you decided
to drop him off at a motel, right?

495
00:43:17,511 --> 00:43:18,470
Right?

496
00:43:20,389 --> 00:43:22,850
That's right. I had a situation too.

497
00:43:23,392 --> 00:43:25,144
Of course. I understand.

498
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:27,896
So what exactly was it?

499
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:30,733
I won't tell you.

500
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,694
I no longer have to report
everything to you.

501
00:44:36,131 --> 00:44:37,675
NO ONE ASKED ABOUT THE CULPRIT

502
00:44:39,051 --> 00:44:40,552
THEY HOPED THE NEXT VICTIM
WOULDN'T BE…

503
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:44,014
You're cowardly, right?

504
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,393
Be nice to people. And don't get greedy.

505
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:50,938
If you got lucky and became rich,

506
00:44:51,021 --> 00:44:53,190
you should be thankful
and be nice to people.

507
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,737
What are you burning?

508
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,406
Traces.

509
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,745
"Traces."

510
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:08,497
Oh, my eyes.

511
00:45:09,248 --> 00:45:10,833
Go outside and soak in the sun.

512
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:12,668
I take vitamin D supplements.

513
00:45:12,751 --> 00:45:14,711
Draw the curtain again and go to work.

514
00:45:15,379 --> 00:45:19,341
This is exactly why
the neighbors keep calling you a nerd.

515
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:27,307
Single genre writers like me
receive such accusations.

516
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:29,393
You need to get used to it, honey.

517
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:30,519
SMASH HIT WRITER
LEE SEOL-ROK

518
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,688
For a while, you went outside often.

519
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,731
Why are you doing this again?

520
00:45:37,776 --> 00:45:38,777
Yes.

521
00:45:38,861 --> 00:45:42,156
Are you channeling
the creative spirit now?

522
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:45,868
I'm nearly done with the story.

523
00:45:45,951 --> 00:45:48,203
I was uncertain
about this season's villain.

524
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:50,164
I know exactly what to do now. Yes!

525
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:54,418
I hope we can move into the apartment
without taking out any loans

526
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,378
like you said.

527
00:45:57,421 --> 00:45:58,422
Of course.

528
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,801
And if this novel hits big,

529
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:05,179
let's try IVF again.

530
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:08,974
-Really?
-Trust me.

531
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:22,112
What are these?

532
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:24,615
We decided to make a garden
on the rooftop.

533
00:46:24,698 --> 00:46:26,241
A garden? All of a sudden?

534
00:46:27,034 --> 00:46:30,829
My wife complained so much
about the increased vegetable prices.

535
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,374
Let's plant all the green onions
and chili peppers.

536
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:37,711
I'll plant cabbages and chicory
for the pub.

537
00:46:37,794 --> 00:46:41,882
I'll plant marigolds.
My late wife loved those flowers.

538
00:46:41,965 --> 00:46:44,843
Was this the landlord's idea?

539
00:46:44,927 --> 00:46:46,136
Why? Don't you like it?

540
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:53,477
Does Unit 202 have a different plan?

541
00:46:53,560 --> 00:46:54,603
No, we don't.

542
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,525
Jeong-hyeok, are you going somewhere
to make kimchi?

543
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,567
What?

544
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:06,323
Well…

545
00:47:06,865 --> 00:47:08,825
I'm going to…

546
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,537
I'm going to build a greenhouse.

547
00:47:11,620 --> 00:47:14,248
My wife likes strawberries, you see.

548
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:15,958
That's nice.

549
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,470
"I no longer have to report
everything to you"?

550
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,139
Your daughter is testing you!

551
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:37,229
I want to barge into her room
and grill her until she tells the truth.

552
00:47:39,439 --> 00:47:41,149
But I should control myself, right?

553
00:47:41,233 --> 00:47:44,027
Ae-yeon, in my opinion,

554
00:47:44,611 --> 00:47:48,448
the mother-daughter relationship is
as problematic as the father-daughter one.

555
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,743
-What do you mean?
-Until now, the mom without a husband

556
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:55,205
and the daughter without a boyfriend
have stayed too close.

557
00:47:55,998 --> 00:47:59,001
How much longer do you plan
to live with Mi-rae?

558
00:47:59,084 --> 00:48:02,087
-What?
-Mi-rae should move out soon.

559
00:48:02,170 --> 00:48:03,797
It's actually past that time.

560
00:48:19,104 --> 00:48:20,647
Medal!

561
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:23,358
Wake up already! Let's eat.

562
00:48:23,442 --> 00:48:25,152
The sun is high up in the sky.

563
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:43,920
My goodness.
Medal, are you shedding again?

564
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:48,508
Your fur is in every nook and cranny.

565
00:48:51,511 --> 00:48:53,472
Did something happen to the bookshelf?

566
00:48:53,555 --> 00:48:55,724
It is meant to be there
to organize the books.

567
00:48:57,893 --> 00:49:01,688
You should put paper away, okay?

568
00:49:02,564 --> 00:49:04,900
Medal, get out. I'm busy.

569
00:49:14,910 --> 00:49:16,411
Medal, let's eat.

570
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,151
You're back.

571
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:51,530
We were worried sick.

572
00:49:54,533 --> 00:49:55,701
I mean, your mom.

573
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:11,091
Mi-rae.

574
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,431
You're like low-sales stock.

575
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,726
The products
that gather dust due to low sales.

576
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:25,897
Even a clearance sale
doesn't make them sell,

577
00:50:26,481 --> 00:50:29,192
but they have a lengthy shelf life,
so we can't discard them.

578
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:31,695
A food merchandiser's worst nightmare.

579
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:36,450
You destroyed the balance in my family.

580
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,410
It's a downright mess!

581
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:41,747
I'm sorry.

582
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,959
I didn't know that it'd get so messy

583
00:50:46,042 --> 00:50:47,127
until I came back.

584
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,300
I'm an ignorant man
who can only use his body.

585
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:57,971
However,

586
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,726
there wasn't a single moment
that I didn't want you.

587
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:10,442
Don't lie to me.

588
00:51:11,526 --> 00:51:12,360
Mi-rae.

589
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:14,780
Mi-rae.

590
00:51:20,577 --> 00:51:24,039
MIHYANG NOODLES

591
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:31,213
YOU MET YOUR CREDIT LIMIT
TRANSACTION DECLINED

592
00:51:38,011 --> 00:51:39,763
KANGHAN BANK

593
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:45,310
I thought
you deserved a few dozen million.

594
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:48,271
That was why I sent the money.

595
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:51,983
So stop complaining
and continue to be my tax accountant.

596
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,531
Would it be okay if I go first?

597
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,242
Sure, go ahead.

598
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:01,409
Thank you.

599
00:52:11,962 --> 00:52:12,796
Come on in.

600
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,091
I ordered two bowls.

601
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:25,183
If you give me your bank account number,

602
00:52:25,267 --> 00:52:27,727
I'll wire you the money
for the noodles tomorrow.

603
00:52:28,728 --> 00:52:30,730
Forget it. It's nothing.

604
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:37,487
You run a hair salon
across from the real estate agency.

605
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:40,240
I'll drop off the money tomorrow.

606
00:52:43,743 --> 00:52:47,080
Then come get a haircut instead.

607
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:54,629
I knew it.

608
00:52:54,713 --> 00:52:57,799
Your scalp feels quite hot.

609
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:01,720
If you leave it that way,
you'll lose your hair.

610
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,055
Hair loss?

611
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,474
I'll give you a scalp treatment for free.

612
00:53:07,559 --> 00:53:09,644
Make sure you drop by.

613
00:53:31,541 --> 00:53:32,500
MS. MI-RAE

614
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:33,627
Did you get home safely?

615
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,380
READ

616
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:55,231
The taekwondo gym must be closed today.

617
00:54:01,988 --> 00:54:04,491
-Are you in front of the gym?
-I was passing by.

618
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:07,452
I thought breaking some boards
would make me feel better.

619
00:54:07,535 --> 00:54:10,163
I'll teach you something else today.

620
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:37,691
What will you teach me today?

621
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:39,901
This.

622
00:54:44,447 --> 00:54:45,699
No, thanks.

623
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,327
Why not? Are you scared?

624
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,870
I don't want to ride it.

625
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:53,665
I don't know how to ride a bicycle.

626
00:54:53,748 --> 00:54:55,041
Didn't you learn it in childhood?

627
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:56,876
Usually, dads…

628
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:01,172
I guess dads teach such things usually.

629
00:55:05,802 --> 00:55:07,303
It'll be okay if I teach you.

630
00:55:09,180 --> 00:55:13,059
Let's just try it for ten minutes.
If you don't like it, you can quit then.

631
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:25,530
Remember two things.

632
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:28,825
"Don't stop pedaling.
Don't look down but far ahead."

633
00:55:28,908 --> 00:55:31,536
Which one should I do first?

634
00:55:31,619 --> 00:55:33,538
Do both at the same time.

635
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:37,208
You'll pick it up soon. You're athletic.

636
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,793
All right. Let's go!

637
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:48,970
All right. Balance yourself.

638
00:55:49,054 --> 00:55:50,555
-Don't let go.
-Okay.

639
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,682
-Are you there?
-Yes, I got you.

640
00:55:59,355 --> 00:56:01,608
-It's working.
-Keep your hands on the handle.

641
00:56:06,738 --> 00:56:09,240
-Why did you push so hard?
-I didn't push.

642
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,224
You're doing well.

643
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,568
Mi-rae, are you okay?

644
00:56:45,652 --> 00:56:48,863
You let go, didn't you?
I told you not to do that.

645
00:56:48,947 --> 00:56:50,949
And I didn't want to learn it anyway.

646
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:55,495
In that case, shall we stop here?

647
00:56:58,331 --> 00:57:01,626
If you lack the talent,
it can't be helped.

648
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,431
Don't let go until I tell you to.

649
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,059
-Okay?
-Okay.

650
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:22,647
Let's go again!

651
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,279
-Don't let go, okay?
-Okay.

652
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:30,697
To the left.

653
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:43,877
Ta-da!

654
00:57:45,086 --> 00:57:46,588
Then teach me right away.

655
00:57:46,671 --> 00:57:49,174
I want to ride this to school
starting tomorrow.

656
00:57:49,257 --> 00:57:51,551
Okay. Let's go.

657
00:57:51,634 --> 00:57:55,513
Dad, come and teach me
how to ride a bicycle.

658
00:57:55,597 --> 00:57:57,056
Come on.

659
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:00,727
Mi-rae, Yeong-cheol is
in the neighborhood.

660
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,395
I'll be back soon.

661
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,607
Okay? I'll teach you when I come back,
so please wait.

662
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:21,581
Yang Cheol-hong hits another home run!

663
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:25,335
-This is the beginning of a legend!
-Sir, let's watch something else.

664
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:26,961
Where's the remote?

665
00:58:27,045 --> 00:58:29,422
Why? Aren't you guys fans of the Dragons?

666
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:30,507
Fans, my foot.

667
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:32,926
You don't know what you're talking about.

668
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,180
The one who should be there
isn't Yang Cheol-hong,

669
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,640
but him--

670
00:58:39,724 --> 00:58:40,892
Lee Yeong-cheol.

671
00:58:42,519 --> 00:58:43,645
Cut it out.

672
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:46,272
I just think it's a shame.

673
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:49,317
A shame, my foot.

674
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:52,195
I'm practically an invalid now.

675
00:58:53,196 --> 00:58:54,489
Seriously.

676
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,241
You should've kept playing baseball.

677
00:58:56,324 --> 00:58:58,743
Why did you suddenly do manual labor?

678
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,957
So your baby was weak in the womb and
you needed money for the hospital bills.

679
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:04,916
I get that,

680
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:09,504
but look what happened to you
because you slaved away for hospital fees.

681
00:59:09,587 --> 00:59:10,421
What's this?

682
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:15,260
In Busan, you were the pride and future
of Daepo High School!

683
00:59:18,388 --> 00:59:19,847
Future?

684
00:59:21,140 --> 00:59:22,433
There's no such thing.

685
00:59:23,017 --> 00:59:25,728
Let me be completely frank. Back then,

686
00:59:27,146 --> 00:59:28,856
if you hadn't had Mi-rae…

687
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,026
Your career and your future
got ruined because of Mi-rae.

688
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:33,486
Isn't that right?

689
00:59:34,195 --> 00:59:36,364
No one could say it to your face.

690
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:39,367
But everyone said
that your child tied you down

691
00:59:39,450 --> 00:59:40,618
behind your back.

692
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:10,231
Even though you never wanted it,

693
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,733
you're a parent.

694
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,110
So take responsibility.

695
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:21,326
It was that day.

696
01:00:21,409 --> 01:00:23,369
You're doing well. Keep pedaling.

697
01:00:23,453 --> 01:00:25,622
Don't let go until I tell you to.

698
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,708
All right. Don't look down. Look ahead.

699
01:00:28,791 --> 01:00:29,751
Look far ahead.

700
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:44,641
What? Mi-rae.

701
01:00:46,184 --> 01:00:47,226
Mi-rae, slow down.

702
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:48,436
Let go.

703
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,772
-Let go!
-Slow down.

704
01:00:50,855 --> 01:00:51,731
Let go!

705
01:00:52,815 --> 01:00:54,025
Move out of the way!

706
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,039
Hey! Byeon Mi-rae!

707
01:01:09,290 --> 01:01:10,958
Ms. Mi-rae, are you okay?

708
01:01:11,584 --> 01:01:12,669
I'm okay.

709
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,842
-It's an emergency patient!
-Emergency!

710
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:22,136
-Emergency!
-Here!

711
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:23,805
-Which way?
-Over there.

712
01:01:23,888 --> 01:01:25,682
-She broke her arm.
-Please wait.

713
01:01:25,765 --> 01:01:27,308
Where's the operating room?

714
01:01:27,392 --> 01:01:28,726
Stop making a fuss!

715
01:01:30,061 --> 01:01:31,938
-Hey, we need to lay her down.
-Okay.

716
01:01:32,021 --> 01:01:33,523
Let's lay her down.

717
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:41,239
Excuse me, how much longer
does she need to wait?

718
01:01:41,322 --> 01:01:43,324
Many people are waiting.
We're going in order.

719
01:01:43,408 --> 01:01:45,910
But she's… She's an emergency patient.

720
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,662
How come…

721
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:55,294
Don't call her.

722
01:01:57,088 --> 01:01:58,506
Don't tell Mom.

723
01:02:04,429 --> 01:02:05,888
Why did you get in the way?

724
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:13,062
It was a pedaling mistake.
A sudden unintended acceleration.

725
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,607
You don't even know how to ride it.

726
01:02:18,151 --> 01:02:19,819
What were you doing, you punk?

727
01:02:21,863 --> 01:02:22,697
I'm sorry.

728
01:02:23,281 --> 01:02:25,825
Was I supposed
to watch you get into an accident?

729
01:02:25,908 --> 01:02:28,703
You should've just watched it.
You should've ignored it

730
01:02:28,786 --> 01:02:30,246
even if I got hurt or killed!

731
01:02:32,081 --> 01:02:33,332
Why on earth did you do that?

732
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:34,751
How am I supposed to know?

733
01:02:36,961 --> 01:02:38,212
Ms. Byeon Mi-rae!

734
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,173
Stop fighting and get your X-rays taken.

735
01:02:40,840 --> 01:02:41,883
Okay.

736
01:03:10,536 --> 01:03:11,704
BRAVO TTEOKBOKKI

737
01:03:11,788 --> 01:03:13,164
MERCHANDISER SURVIVAL GUIDE

738
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,668
Had she been young,

739
01:03:19,003 --> 01:03:21,255
I would've smacked her back right away.

740
01:03:25,968 --> 01:03:27,136
I can't do that anymore

741
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,306
because your sister's grown up.

742
01:03:31,599 --> 01:03:32,600
Right?

743
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:34,852
So…

744
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:40,149
this old mom
should just let her win, right?

745
01:03:48,282 --> 01:03:49,575
Okay.

746
01:03:51,327 --> 01:03:53,454
There's no ligament tear or bone fracture.

747
01:03:53,538 --> 01:03:55,998
But if the pain is unbearable
or the swelling persists,

748
01:03:56,082 --> 01:03:58,334
get an MRI scan
at a nearby orthopedic clinic.

749
01:03:58,417 --> 01:03:59,252
Okay.

750
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:10,346
Sit here. Be careful.

751
01:04:10,930 --> 01:04:12,932
I can walk, okay?

752
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,185
Today, I'll push you from behind.

753
01:04:26,737 --> 01:04:30,658
Your father got so angry that
he left after paying the hospital fee.

754
01:04:39,584 --> 01:04:41,794
I forgot to get your medicine.

755
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:43,588
Wait here. I'll go to the pharmacy.

756
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:46,132
Let's just return this.

757
01:04:49,051 --> 01:04:50,720
Just let me walk home.

758
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:53,681
Byeon Mi-rae.

759
01:05:10,364 --> 01:05:14,118
Don't ever do
something so dangerous again.

760
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,954
Understood?

761
01:05:25,296 --> 01:05:26,547
Baseball is

762
01:05:28,758 --> 01:05:30,426
the only ball-related sport

763
01:05:31,636 --> 01:05:33,429
in which a game ends when a person

764
01:05:34,138 --> 01:05:36,766
leaves and returns home.

765
01:05:40,853 --> 01:05:44,398
And to me, my family is

766
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:47,693
the only home ground.

767
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:51,280
So,

768
01:05:53,324 --> 01:05:55,201
I had no choice but to return here.

769
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:09,382
Mi-rae.

770
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,928
Back then,

771
01:06:17,264 --> 01:06:18,975
I'm sorry that I didn't keep

772
01:06:20,810 --> 01:06:21,644
my promise.

773
01:06:27,733 --> 01:06:29,944
I promised to come back quickly
and teach you…

774
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,864
how to ride a bicycle.

775
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:37,910
It wasn't you.

776
01:06:41,539 --> 01:06:42,748
I hated myself.

777
01:06:44,583 --> 01:06:47,169
Work, being the head of a household
and a father.

778
01:06:47,253 --> 01:06:49,213
I couldn't do anything properly.

779
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:52,049
And I despised myself.

780
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,387
Mi-rae.

781
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,642
How could I ever regret having you?

782
01:07:05,271 --> 01:07:07,106
You're such a precious daughter to us.

783
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:14,447
The best thing I did in my life

784
01:07:16,949 --> 01:07:18,200
was having you guys,

785
01:07:19,201 --> 01:07:21,412
Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae,

786
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:24,498
with Ae-yeon.

787
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:29,336
I'm satisfied with that.

788
01:07:31,297 --> 01:07:32,298
That's enough for me.

789
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,811
Don't be mistaken.

790
01:07:47,104 --> 01:07:50,107
I'm only crying because my arm hurts.

791
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:52,985
Okay.

792
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:07,208
Wow, isn't it nice?

793
01:08:07,291 --> 01:08:09,126
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

794
01:08:57,883 --> 01:08:58,717
PLEDGE

795
01:08:58,801 --> 01:09:03,139
If I, Byeon Moo-jin, fail to be reunited
with Geum Ae-yeon,

796
01:09:03,222 --> 01:09:05,683
I will pay the alimony owed.

797
01:09:07,810 --> 01:09:10,479
As alimony, I'll hand over the villa

798
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,148
to Geum Ae-yeon.

799
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:58,319
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

800
01:09:58,402 --> 01:09:59,403
What's this?

801
01:09:59,486 --> 01:10:00,738
Pack up and get out.

802
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:01,906
Get out!

803
01:10:01,989 --> 01:10:04,783
Ms. Mi-rae,
instead of just running into each other,

804
01:10:04,867 --> 01:10:06,994
why don't we go on a date next time?

805
01:10:07,077 --> 01:10:09,538
How dare a mere employee do that?

806
01:10:10,581 --> 01:10:11,957
"Youngsters?"

807
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:15,044
Does President Byeon have an accomplice?

808
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:18,005
No way. Did President Byeon really…

809
01:10:18,088 --> 01:10:20,382
Mom, the thing is,

810
01:10:20,466 --> 01:10:22,676
I saw Father's secret box.

811
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:24,136
"Secret box"?

812
01:10:28,140 --> 01:10:33,145
