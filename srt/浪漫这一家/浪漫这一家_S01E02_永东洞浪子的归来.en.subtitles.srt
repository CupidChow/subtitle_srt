00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:50,967
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

2
00:00:52,051 --> 00:00:53,678
AMILY VILLA

3
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,623
There's a rumor

4
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:25,418
that this area will be a part
of the housing rearrangement project

5
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,003
in a year or two.

6
00:01:32,675 --> 00:01:34,260
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

7
00:01:35,428 --> 00:01:36,805
Yes, this is Oh Jae-geol.

8
00:01:43,102 --> 00:01:46,147
My goodness.

9
00:01:46,231 --> 00:01:47,899
My goodness.

10
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:51,611
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

11
00:01:52,695 --> 00:01:55,865
-My goodness.
-My goodness.

12
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,204
Medal, be quiet. Stop.

13
00:02:16,302 --> 00:02:18,388
Did a ghost come?

14
00:02:18,471 --> 00:02:19,472
I'm sure it did.

15
00:02:20,056 --> 00:02:21,683
While the ghost eats the food,

16
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:24,269
we should eat too.

17
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:42,871
Father.

18
00:02:56,634 --> 00:02:57,594
-Mom!
-Mom!

19
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,278
Byeon Moo-jin.

20
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:17,030
Geum Ae-yeon.

21
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:18,239
You…

22
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:20,909
What's going on?

23
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,712
Do you guys…

24
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:35,632
live here?

25
00:03:37,383 --> 00:03:39,761
Why are you asking that question?

26
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,055
I'm…

27
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:44,098
the landlord.

28
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:46,309
What?

29
00:03:46,392 --> 00:03:48,061
I'm the new owner…

30
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,397
of this villa.

31
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,241
Father,

32
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,409
why are you alive?

33
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:06,287
I mean, what brought you to our house?

34
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:09,749
I mean, how come are you…

35
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:13,544
our landlord?

36
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,383
Then who are you?

37
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,554
Well, I'm his agent.

38
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:26,057
Mr. Byeon Moo-jin is

39
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:29,310
the person who took over this villa.

40
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,564
How did you purchase this villa?

41
00:04:34,857 --> 00:04:36,526
-With money.
-What money?

42
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:37,819
It would be…

43
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:39,654
my money, of course.

44
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:44,242
Did you buy it knowing that we live here?

45
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Would I?

46
00:04:56,212 --> 00:04:58,423
The father we discarded long ago

47
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:01,342
came back as the owner

48
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,219
of our house.

49
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:07,015
BYEON MOO-JIN

EPISODE 2
THE RETURN OF YONGDONG-DONG'S REBEL

51
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,601
SEOUL FAMILY COURT

52
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,478
11 YEARS AGO

53
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:15,565
Thank you for handing over
the parental rights and custody.

54
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:17,608
This is your last chance.

55
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:20,403
You can still change your mind.

56
00:05:20,486 --> 00:05:23,489
I thought about it countless times
while living with you.

57
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:27,702
Live well. Don't worry about the kids.

58
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,581
Let's not see each other again
in this lifetime.

59
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:34,542
Geum Ae-yeon.

60
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,339
What was it like…

61
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:41,924
to live with me?

62
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:52,143
The best thing to occur in my life
was having Mi-rae and Hyeon-jae.

63
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,771
And the worst thing…

64
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,066
was meeting you.

65
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:13,039
Mr. Byeon?
He was famous in this neighborhood.

66
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,792
What was his nickname?

67
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:19,087
Byeon… Byeon Moo-jin.

68
00:06:19,754 --> 00:06:21,798
Moo… I remember!

69
00:06:22,924 --> 00:06:26,219
You Moo-ron!

70
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:27,929
What?

71
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,680
-What did I do?
-Come here.

72
00:06:29,764 --> 00:06:32,225
-What…
-You'd better not come home!

73
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:33,559
What did I do wrong?

74
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,562
-Gosh!
-In his youth, he was an athlete.

75
00:06:36,646 --> 00:06:38,648
But he became a dad at a young age.

76
00:06:38,731 --> 00:06:39,982
So he quit to make money.

77
00:06:40,066 --> 00:06:42,485
So, did he make good money?

78
00:06:42,568 --> 00:06:43,903
No.

79
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:47,448
He couldn't make much money
due to some disease.

80
00:06:47,532 --> 00:06:49,242
Was it a serious disease?

81
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,244
A disease of entrepreneurship!

82
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:53,329
It was a terminal disease.

83
00:06:53,412 --> 00:06:55,414
Every business went under.

84
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,916
What is it this time?

85
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:58,668
A dumpling place.

86
00:06:59,627 --> 00:07:01,879
Hey, have you seen anyone
who doesn't like dumplings?

87
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:04,507
Of course not.
It'll work. I'm telling you.

88
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:10,179
With what money will you open it?

89
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,098
My older sister lent me money.

90
00:07:12,181 --> 00:07:14,976
I waived my physical rights
and signed up for a chain restaurant.

91
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,899
Are you confident this time?

92
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,526
Ae-yeon.

93
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:26,404
I'm Byeon Moo-jin!

94
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,951
A food supplier
for the famous dumpling chain restaurants

95
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:35,496
was found to use rotten pickled radish
to make the fillings

96
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,457
and caused a considerable disturbance.

97
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,084
Mi-rae's mom went through so much.

98
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:42,879
In the end, she took out a loan
to open a business.

99
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:45,715
I heard that Ae-yeon's snack bar was
pretty successful.

100
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:49,343
It was, but it went under
because of her husband.

101
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,636
Mr. Byeon again.

102
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,638
Was that Mr. Byeon's doing too?

103
00:07:52,722 --> 00:07:55,725
Yes. You're the one who told me.

104
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,642
Did I?

105
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:01,314
Chew on it. Squid is good
for preventing Alzheimer's.

106
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,692
In any case, Mi-rae's mom gave up
after that incident.

107
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:07,612
She signed the divorce papers
and kicked him out.

108
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,949
And that Moo-ron bought the entire villa?

109
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:13,326
Yes.

110
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,912
The villa that houses
the ones who kicked him out?

111
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,955
Will you live in Unit 302?

112
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:19,081
REAL ESTATE AGENCY

113
00:08:19,707 --> 00:08:22,043
It's the only vacant unit,
so it can't be helped.

114
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,172
I can't kick out the tenants
who want to continue living there.

115
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,674
Please wrap it up that way.

116
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,718
Well, if that's what you want.

117
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,720
By the way, sir,

118
00:08:32,803 --> 00:08:35,473
you seem like a high-caliber man
with a secretary.

119
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:37,975
You must run a big business.

120
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,811
He's my business partner.

121
00:08:42,104 --> 00:08:43,898
I've been quite busy.

122
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,068
Since I'm not good with documents,
he handled the related tasks.

123
00:08:47,151 --> 00:08:48,903
I see.

124
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,488
If you need help,

125
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,365
contact me.

126
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:53,991
Okay.

127
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:59,163
OH JAE-GEOL
TAX ACCOUNTANT OFFICE

128
00:09:01,582 --> 00:09:03,042
Are you sure about this?

129
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,170
It's okay.
Someone will have to live there anyway.

130
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,838
I can't leave it in a burnt state.

131
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:11,217
I wasn't talking about that.

132
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,266
Oh, drop me off there.

133
00:09:24,105 --> 00:09:26,649
Hello, customer.
Welcome to Yuhwa Electronics.

134
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:35,616
This is the newest product.
Though it's quite expensive--

135
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,952
I'm sure it's worth the hefty price tag.

136
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,705
-I'll take this.
-Yes, sir.

137
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:43,207
And this is our newest smart TV.

138
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,500
Smart.

139
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,295
I'm sure it'll be better than a dumb TV.

140
00:09:48,754 --> 00:09:49,672
I'll take this.

141
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,177
It looks sturdy. I'll take this.

142
00:09:56,512 --> 00:09:59,557
I guess using this will make me stylish.
I'll take this.

143
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,563
I'll take this.

144
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:14,363
The total is 18,870,000 won.

145
00:10:14,447 --> 00:10:15,448
Here you go.

146
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,161
-Lump-sum payment.
-Yes, sir.

147
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,376
-Is there any free gift?
-Pardon?

148
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,837
Right. Since you spent
over ten million won,

149
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,799
we'll give you
a fine china set and an air fryer.

150
00:10:37,136 --> 00:10:39,805
-What kind of a calculation is that?
-Excuse me?

151
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,724
Since I spent over ten million won,

152
00:10:41,807 --> 00:10:44,185
shouldn't I get all of those gifts?

153
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,562
Is my calculation wrong?

154
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:01,327
How long to get wallpaper and floor done
and save salvageable parts?

155
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,536
Not much is salvageable.

156
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:04,705
Wallpaper and floor
will take three to four days.

157
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,251
Hyeon-jae, what are you doing?

158
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,420
-Checking if this is real.
-What do you mean?

159
00:11:12,755 --> 00:11:15,716
Arms, legs, torso, kidneys,

160
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,052
and heart.

161
00:11:20,388 --> 00:11:22,890
You have eyes, nose, and mouth.
It really is you, Dad.

162
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,601
What are you doing?

163
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:27,937
I thought you were dead.

164
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,854
Dead?

165
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:30,523
Me?

166
00:11:31,315 --> 00:11:32,691
-Who said that?
-Aunt did.

167
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:35,528
"Your dad is dead.
You don't have a dad anymore."

168
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:39,073
That's what she usually says
after having a fight with me.

169
00:11:39,156 --> 00:11:41,742
Then how about the motorcycle?

170
00:11:41,826 --> 00:11:43,035
It was on the news.

171
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:47,081
"A man in his late-forties who died
at Gwangheungchang Station Intersection".

172
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:49,625
The motorcycle had
the sticker for Aunt's restaurant.

173
00:11:49,708 --> 00:11:52,545
We got a close-up shot of "Master Byeon."

174
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:58,050
It was around this time last year, right?

175
00:11:58,884 --> 00:11:59,718
Yes.

176
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:00,845
So,

177
00:12:02,138 --> 00:12:05,057
you guys prepared a memorial service
and wailed yesterday…

178
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:06,809
for me.

179
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,395
You thought I was dead.

180
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,825
Why didn't you go to school?

181
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,995
I have no class today.

182
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,329
Go downstairs.

183
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:31,750
Now!

184
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,379
I'm on my way.

185
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:51,687
Mi-rae.

186
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:53,481
I'm…

187
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:56,692
I don't have a dad now.

188
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,029
From today onward…

189
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:03,657
my dad is dead.

190
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:13,250
We'll move out of Unit 102.
By the end of this week.

191
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,586
You can give us the key money
by then, right?

192
00:13:15,669 --> 00:13:17,630
If you have anything to say
about the unit,

193
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:20,716
please contact me, not Mom.

194
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,470
Did you become a lawyer?

195
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:25,763
I'll get going now.

196
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,355
The owner of the villa?

197
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:35,564
Byeon Moo-jin?

198
00:13:39,818 --> 00:13:41,403
That Moo-ron?

199
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,698
Hurry up and go inside.

200
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:46,242
What's your problem?

201
00:13:47,117 --> 00:13:48,160
Sit down.

202
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:56,001
Starting today,
I'll check properties after work

203
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:57,294
and sign a lease agreement.

204
00:13:59,421 --> 00:14:02,550
This Sunday is a good day to move.
Let's move then.

205
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:03,551
Are you serious?

206
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,010
Of course!

207
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:09,723
Is this really happening?

208
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:12,851
Okay, let's move.

209
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:18,315
But the housing prices went up a lot
in this neighborhood.

210
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,901
-The key money won't be--
-Then we'll take out a loan.

211
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:24,071
-Again?
-The family meeting is over.

212
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,282
I dropped by on my way to a meeting.
See you later.

213
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,293
It was probably Mom's wish

214
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:40,504
to clean up the poop quietly
before I found out.

215
00:14:40,588 --> 00:14:41,422
KWON OH-HYEON:

216
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:44,383
Byeon Mi-rae. Fine.
I'll wait until the end of this week.

217
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:47,469
I'm giving you a last chance.

218
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,638
But when the lid opened,

219
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:52,516
it wasn't a bomb she could handle.

220
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,536
I'll remove it

221
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:15,372
as swiftly and quickly as possible.

222
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:19,877
The prices for the key money leases
and monthly rentals went up,

223
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,670
so no properties meet your conditions.

224
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:24,423
-Oh, there's one.
-You know that.

225
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:26,216
Okay. I understand.

226
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,969
-Call and tell them we're on our way.
-Okay.

227
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,518
FAMILY VILLA MARKET PRICE

228
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:39,104
FAMILY VILLA
THREE BILLION WON

229
00:15:39,188 --> 00:15:40,731
Three billion won?

230
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:45,027
Is this villa worth three billion won?

231
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,322
Does Father have three billion won?

232
00:15:49,365 --> 00:15:51,575
Please do a meticulous job.

233
00:15:54,495 --> 00:15:56,330
They fixed up the place so quickly.

234
00:15:59,041 --> 00:16:00,751
Hello. Please look around.

235
00:16:00,834 --> 00:16:02,503
Once we're done with this…

236
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,256
Gosh! Ms. Byeon, your face!

237
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:09,468
You might collapse again.

238
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,929
I have no time to do that.

239
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:16,350
This one won't do.
They hid it with wallpaper,

240
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,227
but the place is very moldy.

241
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,646
-And the previous one?
-A barbecue place is downstairs.

242
00:16:20,729 --> 00:16:23,190
How will we handle
the smell and noise? No.

243
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:26,860
Where's the next place?

244
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:56,557
AMILY VILLA

245
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:59,226
Gosh, it's a ladder truck. Wow!

246
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,311
Be careful.

247
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,147
Gosh, Eun-woo.

248
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,982
Thank you. Gosh, Mr. Byeon!

249
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,068
Oh, right. President Byeon.

250
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,529
Byeon? It means "Poop."

251
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:13,282
Mister, are you President Poop?

252
00:17:13,365 --> 00:17:15,868
Gosh, don't call the landlord that.

253
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,163
You have nice handwriting.

254
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,914
Right?

255
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,624
Say, "Thank you."

256
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:25,252
-Hello.
-Hello.

257
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,672
I live in Semi-Basement Unit One.
I'm Choi Dong-jin.

258
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:30,257
I'm Byeon Moo-jin.

259
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,177
-I hope we'll get along, sir.
-Likewise.

260
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,845
I live in Unit 101. I'm Kang Nam.

261
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:37,097
I'm the manly Nam of the Jinju Kang Clan.

262
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,476
-I hope we get along.
-Likewise.

263
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,895
You must be moving in today.

264
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:44,271
Yes.

265
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:48,901
You know, the washing machine…

266
00:17:49,735 --> 00:17:51,487
He even moved into the crime scene.

267
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:52,821
How daring.

268
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,031
How about breakfast?

269
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,282
I set the table.

270
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,202
Oh, I'll heat up the soup.

271
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,912
I don't have many belongings.

272
00:17:59,995 --> 00:18:01,288
You have a lot.

273
00:18:01,371 --> 00:18:02,873
Those are all brand new.

274
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,250
Are you moving in by yourself? I see.

275
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,711
Please excuse me.

276
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,260
Did you decide on your moving day,
Unit 102?

277
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,722
I heard you'd move out this week.

278
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,350
We'll move out soon.

279
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:23,727
Let me know. I need to put it up for rent.

280
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,187
Okay.

281
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,064
Father!

282
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,566
Father.

283
00:18:30,484 --> 00:18:32,152
Which room does this go to?

284
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:37,324
-Put it in the living room.
-Okay.

285
00:19:02,599 --> 00:19:04,351
Is this really happening?

286
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,353
Let's decide on a place today,
no matter what.

287
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:08,814
Let's meet after work.

288
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,276
I can't take out a loan?

289
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:38,862
I thought I could take out some more.

290
00:20:38,946 --> 00:20:42,366
You must've confused it
with the limit for a married employee.

291
00:20:42,449 --> 00:20:43,450
I'm sorry.

292
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,661
Is there no other way?

293
00:20:58,382 --> 00:20:59,675
Second floor.

294
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,806
Doors are closing.

295
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:17,484
Don't touch this.

296
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:19,653
Oh, okay.

297
00:21:19,736 --> 00:21:21,822
I guess your family members
will move in later.

298
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,783
All the rooms are empty
except for the master bedroom.

299
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,256
He renovated the house
and moved in very quickly.

300
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:41,633
Just what is he
trying to leave behind and cover up?

301
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,096
Just as I thought,

302
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,724
I smell something suspicious.

303
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:52,185
The smell is too strong.
What's this smell?

304
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,687
What's this smell? No!

305
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,399
Hey!

306
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:58,900
Gosh, it's hot!

307
00:22:02,446 --> 00:22:03,655
Gosh, it smells bad.

308
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:11,079
It smells bad
even when dishcloths get burnt.

309
00:22:13,749 --> 00:22:18,211
I'm certain that he's hiding something.

310
00:22:18,962 --> 00:22:20,380
Gosh, it smells bad.

311
00:22:25,802 --> 00:22:26,720
Hyeon-jae,

312
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:29,639
go buy some beverages
for us and the movers.

313
00:22:30,348 --> 00:22:32,142
Okay, I'll be back.

314
00:23:02,380 --> 00:23:03,632
Hello.

315
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,385
It looks like you finished moving in.

316
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:10,597
Are you coming back from somewhere?

317
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,891
Gosh, it should've been me.

318
00:23:12,974 --> 00:23:15,227
I mean, instead of the previous landlord.

319
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,105
He passed away too soon.

320
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:20,148
He was only 80 years old.

321
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,949
By the way, have we met before?

322
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:36,414
I don't know. I did live
in this neighborhood back in the day.

323
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:40,168
I moved to this neighborhood last year.

324
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,755
You look familiar.

325
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,426
I hear that a lot. I have a common face.

326
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:51,179
I wouldn't say that.

327
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,404
For goodness' sake.

328
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,261
Hey.

329
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:35,223
The move ended quickly.

330
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,893
Here's the transfer tax document.

331
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,437
-Want some coffee?
-Yes.

332
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:44,900
Gosh, did you have to spend so much money
to move in here?

333
00:24:44,983 --> 00:24:46,026
It's icky.

334
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:48,653
I already reported the move,
so it's too late.

335
00:24:48,737 --> 00:24:49,779
Have a seat.

336
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,909
As for the matter regarding Mr. Kim,
the previous landlord…

337
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:56,703
It'll be taken care of quietly.

338
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,209
Are you okay with coffee mix?

339
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:09,466
I'm sorry.
It'll be hard for us to meet the price.

340
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,553
The costs went up for raw materials,
labor, and electricity.

341
00:25:13,637 --> 00:25:15,347
You should pay us a bit more.

342
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:18,391
We'd really like to do that.

343
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,894
But if we do that,
we won't make any profits.

344
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:23,104
My goodness.

345
00:25:26,358 --> 00:25:29,444
I asked the landlord
to bring down the key money a bit,

346
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:31,446
but he refused.

347
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:34,115
Housing prices are high these days.

348
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,493
The price is going up
for everything but our labor.

349
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:39,454
We need to make a living, okay?

350
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:43,208
I know. Why does the price go up
for everything?

351
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:44,751
Sorry?

352
00:25:46,336 --> 00:25:48,713
Hi, Mom. I had a meeting nearby.

353
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,465
I'm going home. I'll pick you up.

354
00:25:50,548 --> 00:25:51,967
Okay. I'll be at the entrance.

355
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,009
Okay.

356
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,849
-What is it?
-You finally picked up.

357
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:03,270
KWON OH-HYEON

358
00:26:06,147 --> 00:26:08,191
I'm busy. I'm hanging up.

359
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,234
Hold on.

360
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:11,194
You don't look busy at all.

361
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:29,963
Byeon Mi-rae!

362
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,427
-Come here.
-Hold on, Mi-rae.

363
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:37,220
Mi-rae.

364
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:39,431
Let's break up.

365
00:26:40,515 --> 00:26:41,933
-We already broke up.
-No.

366
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,769
I'm breaking up with you now.

367
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:46,604
What?

368
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:49,274
I can't do this anymore.

369
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,235
I can't love a woman like you.

370
00:26:53,111 --> 00:26:54,738
Are you going to do this here?

371
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:57,115
Did you ever love me?
Why are you so against marriage?

372
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:59,242
When you're in love,
you want to be together.

373
00:26:59,326 --> 00:27:02,078
When you're together,
you want to get married. That's natural.

374
00:27:02,162 --> 00:27:03,538
Love isn't a sin, okay?

375
00:27:03,621 --> 00:27:05,206
It isn't a sin!

376
00:27:08,626 --> 00:27:09,878
-Are you drunk?
-No.

377
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:13,715
Why did you say you were with a friend
whenever your mom called?

378
00:27:13,798 --> 00:27:14,716
I'm not your friend.

379
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:17,886
Also, you straightened your face
whenever I asked about your dad.

380
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,554
That was really strange.

381
00:27:23,516 --> 00:27:25,060
Should we stop him or not?

382
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:26,978
We should keep quiet and watch.

383
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,273
I'd quit tomorrow if it were me.

384
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:32,734
I wasn't a part of your life.

385
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,818
Was I…

386
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:36,613
within the top ten priorities
in your life?

387
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:40,116
But you know what?

388
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:43,078
You aren't a priority in your life either.

389
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:48,333
-And--
-Stop!

390
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:52,379
I get it, so stop.

391
00:27:52,462 --> 00:27:53,880
You broke up with me.

392
00:27:53,963 --> 00:27:55,632
I got dumped, okay?

393
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:58,468
Byeon Mi-rae, you're cold-hearted
until the end.

394
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:03,348
You got me this embarrassed,

395
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:05,558
so you should be satisfied.

396
00:28:07,435 --> 00:28:09,312
-Can I go now?
-No.

397
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,772
I'll go first.

398
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:20,990
What are you looking at?
Move out of the way!

399
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,075
For goodness' sake.

400
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,424
Ms. Byeon's car is in the parking lot.

401
00:28:37,507 --> 00:28:40,635
She probably lost her sense of direction.

402
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,858
Gosh, this is embarrassing.

403
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,168
Hop on.

404
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:19,716
Aren't you going to hop on? I'll go then.

405
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:23,803
Hold on.

406
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,770
I need to use the restroom.

407
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:19,025
Enjoy the breeze for a minute.

408
00:30:43,424 --> 00:30:44,259
MISS AE-YEON:

409
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:47,011
Inventory count doesn't add up.
I'll call you after checking.

410
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
MR. YOO:

411
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:53,601
Ms. Byeon, cheer up.

412
00:31:02,443 --> 00:31:04,571
I want to become the wind and disappear.

413
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,575
I want the world to collapse tomorrow.

414
00:31:11,202 --> 00:31:12,245
I don't ever want

415
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,873
to go back to work.

416
00:31:36,352 --> 00:31:38,646
Thank you for saving me.

417
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:40,982
For giving me a ride.

418
00:31:52,493 --> 00:31:53,953
Use this.

419
00:31:56,789 --> 00:31:58,041
Thank you.

420
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:01,169
I caused you trouble.

421
00:32:01,252 --> 00:32:02,921
I was just passing by.

422
00:32:03,004 --> 00:32:04,881
I see. Okay.

423
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:11,095
Come to think of it,
you paid my hospital bill, right?

424
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:14,015
Oh, that. Yes.

425
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:17,101
When I returned later,
they told me that it had been paid.

426
00:32:27,403 --> 00:32:28,529
I'll wire it to you.

427
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,657
It's okay. It wasn't much.

428
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:33,826
I'll pay you since it wasn't much.
Give me your bank account number.

429
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,497
Pay me later.

430
00:32:43,252 --> 00:32:44,921
I'll take you to the bus stop.

431
00:32:45,755 --> 00:32:48,424
It's okay. I can go on my own.

432
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,511
Okay, then.

433
00:33:18,079 --> 00:33:18,913
Where are you?

434
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,416
I'm staring at the river.

435
00:33:21,499 --> 00:33:23,668
I'm thinking about jumping in.

436
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,379
Since the temperature dropped,
the water must be very cold.

437
00:33:26,462 --> 00:33:27,839
Let's have a drink.

438
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,592
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

439
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:40,143
It's okay.

440
00:33:42,478 --> 00:33:45,732
It was a necessary step
to get rid of an ex like a lousy car.

441
00:33:45,815 --> 00:33:48,526
Your next boyfriend will be like
a self-driving electric car.

442
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:54,115
No, I won't date anymore.

443
00:33:55,158 --> 00:33:56,325
I was too greedy.

444
00:33:57,243 --> 00:33:59,120
I have a heap of problems to take care of.

445
00:34:00,455 --> 00:34:04,459
Why did I get married
and bring a heap of problems upon myself?

446
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,838
Why did you get married?

447
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,299
I know, right?

448
00:34:12,467 --> 00:34:13,968
So I'm going to get a divorce.

449
00:34:14,052 --> 00:34:15,720
We're going to court in two days.

450
00:34:15,803 --> 00:34:18,765
Ms. Byeon, stay a voluntary celibate
until the very end.

451
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:21,392
Don't become a divorcee like me.

452
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,938
Being a divorcee isn't a fault these days.

453
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:29,150
It was only like that
back in my mom's days.

454
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:35,615
That's a good decision.

455
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,998
By the way,
when did your father pass away?

456
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,833
I didn't know about that.

457
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,046
A long time ago.

458
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,012
-Here you go.
-I love my new hair.

459
00:34:58,096 --> 00:35:00,139
-Really? Thank you.
-Yes.

460
00:35:00,223 --> 00:35:02,100
-It'll be 70,000 won.
-Yes.

461
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:05,686
How cute. My goodness.

462
00:35:05,770 --> 00:35:08,856
Gosh, isn't this picture the best?

463
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:14,070
You're right, Jin-hee.

464
00:35:14,153 --> 00:35:15,530
Eun-woo's so cute.

465
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:19,033
I bet his parents feel full
even if they don't eat.

466
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:23,871
So you should have a baby
when you're still young.

467
00:35:23,955 --> 00:35:26,415
My husband and I are a DINK couple.

468
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:29,460
By the way, how much will you bet?

469
00:35:30,044 --> 00:35:32,130
Go big and bet 100,000 won.

470
00:35:32,213 --> 00:35:34,298
You get allowances from your son.

471
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:36,551
Those allowances aren't free gifts.

472
00:35:36,634 --> 00:35:40,221
Looking after my grandson at this age
ruins my back and wrists.

473
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,181
It's hard work.

474
00:35:42,265 --> 00:35:43,808
I'll only bet 50,000 won.

475
00:35:44,475 --> 00:35:47,186
-Ms. An, how about you?
-What do you mean?

476
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:49,272
Everyone in the villa placed a bet.

477
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,899
"How did Mr. Byeon become rich?"
50,000 won each.

478
00:35:52,775 --> 00:35:55,153
You mean Ae-yeon's ex…

479
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:58,322
You mean our landlord.

480
00:35:58,406 --> 00:36:00,408
I haven't seen his face yet.

481
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:01,742
What did everyone bet on?

482
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:04,495
I bet on crypto coin.
My husband bet on the stock.

483
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,997
Ms. Yoo bet on the lottery.

484
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,583
He may have gotten rich by working.

485
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:10,793
Maybe his business became a hit.

486
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:13,004
That'd never happen in his life.

487
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,089
I could bet one million won on that.

488
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,009
Just how bad was it?

489
00:36:18,092 --> 00:36:21,804
My husband bet on him being an arsonist.

490
00:36:21,888 --> 00:36:23,181
What?

491
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,474
A mysterious fire.

492
00:36:27,143 --> 00:36:31,272
The man who took over the villa
one week after the previous owner's death.

493
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:39,655
Doesn't it smell fishy?

494
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:44,118
The new landlord is…

495
00:36:45,995 --> 00:36:47,246
the arsonist!

496
00:36:51,959 --> 00:36:53,002
Does he still say that?

497
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:55,796
Tell him to just come and get a haircut.

498
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:59,675
I'll get rid of that geeky hairstyle.

499
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:02,053
What? Geeky?

500
00:37:02,929 --> 00:37:04,680
He's a specialist, okay?

501
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,434
Really? You said your husband worked
for the government. Was he a detective?

502
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,562
He used to work at the borough office
and quit

503
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,648
since he was fed up
with malicious complaints.

504
00:37:13,731 --> 00:37:15,566
He developed a panic disorder.

505
00:37:16,609 --> 00:37:19,487
I just feel bad for him, Se-ri.

506
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:22,865
Make sure he comes here
for a haircut, okay?

507
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,994
-Give me your hand.
-Okay.

508
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:20,756
President Byeon!

509
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:24,552
Mr. Jang.

510
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,680
We finally meet. My goodness.

511
00:38:29,056 --> 00:38:32,059
The entire neighborhood is in an uproar
because of you.

512
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:33,102
Is that so?

513
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:37,148
Gosh, I can barely recognize you.

514
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:42,403
So, between the stock, crypto coin,
and lottery, which one was it?

515
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:45,906
I guess you guys still have bets.

516
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:49,452
Every neighbor's 50,000 won depends on it.

517
00:38:50,661 --> 00:38:51,829
It's the stock, right?

518
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,414
The US stock? Musla?

519
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,376
-Everyone will lose 50,000 won.
-What?

520
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,795
I'll treat you to a nice meal soon.

521
00:38:59,879 --> 00:39:01,172
I'm going.

522
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:04,175
Hey, tell me before you go.

523
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:10,890
Ae-yeon, the rumor
about you guys being ex-spouses

524
00:39:10,973 --> 00:39:12,683
spread in the neighborhood.

525
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:15,978
Aren't they pretty?

526
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,732
Hey, Ae-yeon!

527
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:22,735
It's crypto coin, right?

528
00:39:23,277 --> 00:39:25,071
I'm talking about President Byeon.

529
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,323
You must know.

530
00:39:27,406 --> 00:39:28,908
We bet 50,000 won.

531
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,328
I don't know.

532
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:36,290
So, did you guys get back together?
Or will you soon?

533
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:38,209
Get back together, my foot.

534
00:39:38,793 --> 00:39:39,794
We'll move.

535
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,045
Really?

536
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,339
I got it wrong.

537
00:39:44,006 --> 00:39:46,342
Then you should ask for a hefty alimony.

538
00:39:46,425 --> 00:39:49,720
I don't know how, but it seems like
he became incredibly rich. Okay?

539
00:39:54,475 --> 00:39:56,018
Extort a lot of money.

540
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,029
AMILY VILLA

541
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,158
That bastard.

542
00:40:13,911 --> 00:40:15,579
I should get a new sign.

543
00:40:20,584 --> 00:40:22,503
I didn't think you'd still be living here.

544
00:40:26,090 --> 00:40:28,634
Are you really going to move?

545
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,970
We'll move out in time, so don't worry.

546
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,430
By the way…

547
00:40:34,807 --> 00:40:36,725
why are you not asking me anything?

548
00:40:36,809 --> 00:40:38,602
Because there's nothing I want to know.

549
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:42,273
Geum Ae-yeon.

550
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,283
Didn't you miss me?

551
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:12,261
You know,

552
00:41:13,846 --> 00:41:15,514
you can continue living here.

553
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:17,516
What?

554
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,393
I don't mind.

555
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:25,399
I'd rather sleep on the street.

556
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:27,610
Monthly rent.

557
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:32,990
That'll be free for you.

558
00:41:41,749 --> 00:41:43,751
They fought all the time,

559
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,170
but they were always together too.

560
00:41:47,004 --> 00:41:51,217
When Ae-yeon closed the snack bar,
he'd pick her up on his motorcycle.

561
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,135
He did really care for her.

562
00:41:53,219 --> 00:41:55,846
Gosh, a house husband with a motorcycle?

563
00:41:57,598 --> 00:41:59,725
It's my ideal type.

564
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:03,437
By the way, how are his looks?

565
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,606
Despite living across from him,
I haven't seen him yet.

566
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,774
His looks?

567
00:42:07,608 --> 00:42:10,236
Well, he's cute.

568
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,988
He was the youngest member
of the Yongdong-dong Family.

569
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,492
But apart from having a lot of hair,
he's not really…

570
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,995
Where did I see him?

571
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:21,247
Who?

572
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:22,665
The new landlord.

573
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,417
He seems familiar.

574
00:42:26,418 --> 00:42:29,421
I can't remember where I saw him.

575
00:42:30,297 --> 00:42:32,424
It's probably time for me
to go into a coffin.

576
00:42:32,508 --> 00:42:34,802
Gosh, you're saying that again.

577
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:37,096
Sir, it's understandable.

578
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,850
President Byeon
isn't uniquely handsome like me.

579
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:46,855
He has a common face
you can find easily on the street.

580
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,484
You're done.

581
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:54,154
INTERNATIONAL COACH CERTIFICATE

582
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,799
We're going. Clean up well, latecomer.

583
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:15,968
-Okay.
-Why did you come late today?

584
00:43:18,220 --> 00:43:19,346
I had to save someone.

585
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,932
Save someone? Was there an accident?

586
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,646
It was a gruesome accident.

587
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,942
YONG DONG TAEKWONDO

588
00:43:41,952 --> 00:43:45,372
GANGNAM HOF

589
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:02,139
MI-RAE SNACK BAR

590
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,265
Bring a lot of friends.

591
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,768
Of course. I invited them already.

592
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,481
I think it'll be a hit, Mom.

593
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:13,108
Of course it'll be a hit.
Don't state the obvious.

594
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,902
It's so nice.

595
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,529
This neighborhood has
many schools and academies,

596
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,198
but not any snack bars.

597
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:22,034
As long as the food is halfway decent,
it'll be successful.

598
00:44:25,704 --> 00:44:26,538
All right.

599
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,715
What? What is it?

600
00:44:37,299 --> 00:44:40,010
Byeon Moo-jin, you know

601
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:42,888
that I used all of my savings,
canceled all my insurance plans,

602
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,349
and worked part-time
to open this snack bar.

603
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,309
Yes, I do. Why?

604
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,855
This really is our last chance.

605
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:54,733
So don't cause trouble, okay?

606
00:44:55,651 --> 00:44:57,152
Don't do anything.

607
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:00,989
If you want to do something,
make sure you consult with me first.

608
00:45:01,698 --> 00:45:02,741
I'm warning you.

609
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:04,576
Don't worry.

610
00:45:05,577 --> 00:45:07,287
I won't do anything.

611
00:45:11,542 --> 00:45:15,003
I'll sell tteokbokki to pay
for your and Hyeon-jae's college tuition

612
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,922
and weddings, so don't worry.

613
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:22,803
Mi-rae Snack Bar,

614
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,305
let's go!

615
00:45:25,389 --> 00:45:26,265
MI-RAE SNACK BAR

616
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,809
It's tasty, isn't it?

617
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:32,062
-All right.
-Thank you for the food.

618
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,149
-Did you enjoy the food? Come again!
-Yes.

619
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:37,776
Ma'am, please give us
another serving of tteokbokki.

620
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:41,280
Okay. I'll give you two eggs for free.

621
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,573
Thank you.

622
00:45:46,368 --> 00:45:49,288
Pay back the money you borrowed!

623
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,332
Sir, please don't do this.

624
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,667
Let's talk this out.

625
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,420
Right now, the interest is
twice the principal.

626
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:58,005
What did you do so far?

627
00:45:58,088 --> 00:45:59,798
Didn't you know how private loans work?

628
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:01,925
I'll pay back the money!

629
00:46:02,009 --> 00:46:04,470
You can't pay it back.
Hand over the house and snack bar.

630
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:20,777
Mi-rae.

631
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,786
You know what?

632
00:46:31,413 --> 00:46:32,706
Mom has given

633
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,918
too many chances

634
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:38,170
to you.

635
00:46:40,797 --> 00:46:43,008
-Mi-rae.
-Now…

636
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:46,428
get lost.

637
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,099
Stay away from my family…

638
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,770
until you die.

639
00:48:06,425 --> 00:48:07,968
INSTALLMENT SAVINGS

640
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:09,845
CANCEL

641
00:48:09,928 --> 00:48:11,888
AMOUNT RECEIVED
1,260,000 WON

642
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,015
What?

643
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,641
Is that all?

644
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:22,816
But then,
I only put in 20,000 won a month.

645
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:29,281
It'll be gone
when I hire a moving company.

646
00:48:30,073 --> 00:48:31,783
Mom, let's go.

647
00:48:31,867 --> 00:48:32,909
Okay.

648
00:48:38,874 --> 00:48:40,834
We'll think about it and give you a call.

649
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,210
-Well, then.
-Goodbye.

650
00:48:44,921 --> 00:48:46,923
Wasn't that house pretty good?

651
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:49,760
It won't do.

652
00:48:49,843 --> 00:48:51,887
I peeked in the mailbox earlier.

653
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:54,681
Maintenance and electricity are
twice the amount we pay now.

654
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,977
We can live frugally.

655
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:01,146
I know that we're in a hurry,

656
00:49:01,229 --> 00:49:04,316
but we can't just move in anywhere
to live for the next two years at least.

657
00:49:08,236 --> 00:49:11,239
Could it be that you don't want to move?

658
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,617
What are you talking about?

659
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:16,453
Do you know
what Hyeon-jae is doing these days?

660
00:49:16,536 --> 00:49:17,829
What?

661
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,088
New house. Moving. Dad's flex.

662
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,965
My father is so cool. Heart.

663
00:49:30,676 --> 00:49:32,594
Gosh, that punk!

664
00:49:33,595 --> 00:49:36,014
I'll leave him behind and move, if I must.

665
00:49:36,515 --> 00:49:37,808
Mom, what are you going to do?

666
00:49:38,475 --> 00:49:41,353
-What do you mean?
-Tell me what you're going to do.

667
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:44,064
What can we do? We don't have a choice.

668
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,775
Then why are you stalling?

669
00:49:46,858 --> 00:49:48,443
When did I do that?

670
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,696
How dare you yell at your mom?

671
00:49:50,779 --> 00:49:52,614
When did I yell?

672
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:03,417
-Where are you going? The car is here.
-Don't follow me!

673
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,063
Do you guys live here?

674
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,691
Why are you asking that question?

675
00:50:27,774 --> 00:50:29,860
I'm the landlord.

676
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,322
Didn't you miss me?

677
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:38,201
You know, you can continue living here.

678
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:40,162
I don't mind.

679
00:50:52,841 --> 00:50:54,050
Where are you right now?

680
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:59,264
Ma'am, is there a place that has
a similar condition to the last one

681
00:50:59,347 --> 00:51:00,891
with a cheaper maintenance fee?

682
00:51:00,974 --> 00:51:04,102
With your budget,
the last one is your best option.

683
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,815
Please look into it once more.
We need to move on short notice.

684
00:51:09,483 --> 00:51:10,484
Yes.

685
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,320
Okay. Thank you.

686
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:30,462
MISS AE-YEON

687
00:51:40,514 --> 00:51:44,184
The person you have called is unavailable…

688
00:51:47,103 --> 00:51:48,480
Is she very angry?

689
00:51:56,363 --> 00:51:57,864
Ae-yeon, did something happen?

690
00:51:58,406 --> 00:52:00,534
Have a cold glass of beer.

691
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,662
Is Mi-rae coming?

692
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:09,376
My goodness, welcome.

693
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,002
Hello.

694
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,505
The manly Nam of the Jinju Kang Clan.

695
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:17,050
I see that Gangnam Hof belongs
to Unit 101.

696
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,051
Yes.

697
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,139
Ae-yeon is a regular customer.

698
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,641
Now, let's see.

699
00:52:25,475 --> 00:52:28,478
We have a cozy seat over there. Would you…

700
00:52:31,773 --> 00:52:33,233
All right.

701
00:52:36,152 --> 00:52:37,404
Will you be okay?

702
00:52:40,782 --> 00:52:42,367
The neighbors will see.

703
00:52:45,662 --> 00:52:48,748
Gosh, there aren't many customers today.

704
00:52:48,832 --> 00:52:50,750
I should close early.

705
00:52:52,168 --> 00:52:54,754
I'm going to clean up the restroom,

706
00:52:54,838 --> 00:52:56,756
so talk comfortably.

707
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:11,479
A toast isn't fitting, right?

708
00:53:20,488 --> 00:53:21,323
Why did you come?

709
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,495
You called me over.

710
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:29,623
We were living well by ourselves.

711
00:53:30,540 --> 00:53:32,918
Why did you suddenly show up?

712
00:53:36,296 --> 00:53:37,756
"Show up"?

713
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:43,219
Byeon Moo-jin. You knew
when you bought the villa, didn't you?

714
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:45,889
-Know what?
-That we were living there.

715
00:54:00,236 --> 00:54:02,614
Hey, I'm not
in the National Intelligence Service.

716
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:05,575
I know that this is an unlikely situation,
but you're pushing it.

717
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:11,706
Just now,

718
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:13,875
you snorted.

719
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:19,965
You had a habit of snorting
when telling a lie.

720
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:22,509
I see that you still have it.

721
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:28,515
Byeon Moo-jin.

722
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,559
Do you want to die?

723
00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:42,362
Aunt, have you seen Mom?

724
00:54:43,613 --> 00:54:46,324
Your mom went to see that man.

725
00:54:46,408 --> 00:54:48,159
-Who?
-Your da…

726
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:50,787
Our landlord.

727
00:54:51,788 --> 00:54:53,123
-Where?
-What?

728
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:54,541
Where are they meeting?

729
00:54:56,876 --> 00:54:57,919
Byeon Moo-jin!

730
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:00,755
Answer me before you go.

731
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,173
Why should I do that?

732
00:55:03,466 --> 00:55:07,512
It's incredible enough that the man
who was presumed dead came back alive.

733
00:55:07,595 --> 00:55:09,514
What? Our landlord?

734
00:55:09,597 --> 00:55:10,598
Let go.

735
00:55:11,182 --> 00:55:12,684
You knew we lived there, right?

736
00:55:12,767 --> 00:55:14,394
Right?

737
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:15,603
What's the reason?

738
00:55:16,604 --> 00:55:17,647
I told you to let go.

739
00:55:18,314 --> 00:55:19,733
What on earth is it?

740
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:21,693
What's the reason, you bastard?

741
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:30,410
Are you asking

742
00:55:32,328 --> 00:55:33,705
because you really don't know?

743
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:38,960
Yes.

744
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:41,463
I knew when I bought it.

745
00:55:43,089 --> 00:55:44,257
I wanted to live with you.

746
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:59,939
You don't know what I've done
to come this far.

747
00:56:00,023 --> 00:56:04,069
Must you leave me

748
00:56:05,487 --> 00:56:07,280
once more?

749
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:10,408
Do you hate me that much?

750
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:14,412
Still?

751
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:21,169
Let go of me.

752
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:24,464
I told you to let go. Let go!

753
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:28,093
What are you doing?

754
00:56:31,596 --> 00:56:32,472
Get your hands off her.

755
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:37,143
Get your hands off her right this instant!

756
00:57:02,919 --> 00:57:04,087
Ma'am, come this way.

757
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,005
Honey!

758
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,340
Mom.

759
00:57:07,423 --> 00:57:08,258
Are you okay?

760
00:57:09,467 --> 00:57:10,844
Are you dead?

761
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:23,606
I mean, it looked like
a dangerous situation from above.

762
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:25,984
Is he your husband?

763
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,570
Is he your dad?

764
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:31,364
A nosebleed.

765
00:57:33,158 --> 00:57:35,493
The man who was once my creator

766
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:38,204
came back as the owner of my home.

767
00:57:39,205 --> 00:57:40,498
My goodness.

768
00:57:41,666 --> 00:57:43,084
You bastard.

769
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,335
I…

770
00:57:45,378 --> 00:57:47,380
Hey. Honey.

771
00:57:47,464 --> 00:57:49,674
-I feel dizzy.
-Hey, Byeon Moo-jin.

772
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,927
And he began to ruin everything.

773
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,263
Now…

774
00:58:06,774 --> 00:58:08,401
there'll be no more peace.

775
00:58:09,694 --> 00:58:11,905
It's the beginning of total madness.

776
00:58:30,423 --> 00:58:32,217
HOMEMADE SET MEALS

777
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,426
Take care.

778
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:38,014
-I'm not drunk.
-Don't be ridiculous.

779
00:58:38,097 --> 00:58:40,099
Let's have the third round.

780
00:58:40,183 --> 00:58:41,893
-For goodness' sake.
-Come on.

781
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:44,312
Oh, that day.

782
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:51,736
THE DAY BEFORE THE FIRE
AT FAMILY VILLA

783
00:58:51,819 --> 00:58:52,904
Take care.

784
00:58:55,698 --> 00:58:58,743
Bravo, bravo

785
00:58:58,826 --> 00:59:01,162
-My life, oh, my days
-Isn't that the landlord?

786
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:02,372
My goodness.

787
00:59:03,248 --> 00:59:05,208
Why are they singing so late at night?

788
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,628
-Are you okay, sir?
-My goodness.

789
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:10,880
Did he have a son?

790
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,049
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

791
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:15,760
-Bravo!
-Bravo!

792
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:20,974
You wretch!

793
00:59:23,643 --> 00:59:26,437
Sir, it's over.

794
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:28,273
Give up.

795
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:12,358
ROMANCE IN THE HOUSE

796
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,360
You'll live with Father?
In the same building?

797
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:16,487
He's the one who bought it and came back.

798
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,364
Why should we move out?

799
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:19,949
What on earth do you want?

800
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,951
I'm going to seduce your mom again.

801
01:00:24,704 --> 01:00:25,622
You're still pretty.

802
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,416
I think the CEO's son works
at this company.

803
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:31,961
Let's continue to be indifferent
and pretend not to know each other.

804
01:00:32,545 --> 01:00:35,381
What I saw suddenly seems very suspicious.

805
01:00:35,465 --> 01:00:37,800
The landlord must be really a criminal.

806
01:00:37,884 --> 01:00:40,386
Yongdong-dong Family Villa Fire Case.

807
01:00:40,470 --> 01:00:42,388
I came of my own volition.

808
01:00:43,556 --> 01:00:48,561
