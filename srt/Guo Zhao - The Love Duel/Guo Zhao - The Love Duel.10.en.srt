00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:23,840
Farewell,

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,230
Chen Shaoheng.

5
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,960
Anyway, His Highness
really cares about you.

6
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:41,790
He not only
kept you company for a long time

7
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,520
but also asked me
to make you some decoction.

8
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:45,400
Juanjuan,

9
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,470
whatever you want to do,

10
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:49,150
just do it bravely.

11
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:51,000
You'll always have me.

12
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:53,310
Don't worry.

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:54,600
I will never hurt you.

14
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:57,960
(By Chen Shaoheng)
Today, I'm making a pact with Juanjuan.

15
00:00:58,430 --> 00:00:59,960
Whatever Juanjuan does,

16
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:02,070
I will never hurt her.

17
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,600
This is a written pledge.

18
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,070
Your Highness.

19
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:03,270
Do you like it?

20
00:02:19,030 --> 00:02:20,240
So beautiful.

21
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:21,800
Lian Yue, come have a look.

22
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,190
It's rather a weird song.

23
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:01,120
Why have I never heard it before?

24
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:02,520
A Long Time Ago.

25
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,190
Very quietly, I take my leave.

26
00:03:11,910 --> 00:03:13,840
As quietly as I came here.

27
00:03:13,910 --> 00:03:15,520
Some numbers change while some don't.

28
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,030
The quadrant decides.

29
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,470
What's the first word
in an English dictionary?

30
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:20,560
A-B-A-N-D-O-N,

31
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,520
abandon.

32
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:23,840
Homie!

33
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,280
Leave, Your Grace!

34
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:31,750
Go!

35
00:03:41,310 --> 00:03:42,400
- Shaoheng.
- Your Highness.

36
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,160
- Someone wants to kill you.
- Someone wants to burn you.

37
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,000
Buddy, could I talk to you?

38
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,000
Cheers.

39
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,150
Life here is really painful.

40
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,560
I can't eat regularly or sleep well.

41
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,000
Every day, I do hard work as a maid.

42
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,040
When I was drinking just now,
I didn't even dare to drink too much,

43
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,520
in case this fierce prince

44
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,590
killed me by accident.

45
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,030
If I knew you were from my world,

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,030
I wouldn't be scared.

47
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,190
You're right.

48
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,840
It's hard to be this fierce prince, too.

49
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,270
Within only a few days,

50
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:18,190
I've been assassinated five times.

51
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,480
Yeah. Being a prince is quite risky.

52
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,560
It is pretty strange.

53
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,110
Think about it.

54
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:29,120
Only a few of us knew this trip.

55
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,320
How would the...

56
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,920
Someone must have stalked us.

57
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,270
Well, never mind. Let's drink.

58
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:36,110
Cheers.

59
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,750
Have you met Zhang San?

60
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,790
Yes, of course.

61
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:40,720
That terrible guy gave me a mission

62
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,950
to bathe you.

63
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,190
Come on. Let's drink.

64
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,360
I haven't seen him
for a long time, though.

65
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:57,000
We don't need to stay here forever,
do we?

66
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,950
He said we could leave
after completing the mission.

67
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:00,710
By the way,

68
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,000
what is your mission?

69
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,270
How's that going?

70
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:06,270
Forget about that.

71
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,600
Let's drink.

72
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,840
Cheers.

73
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,120
Is it done?

74
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:14,440
Chief,

75
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,720
Shen Juanjuan failed.

76
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:17,720
Where's she?

77
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:19,680
She went back with Prince Heng.

78
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,070
Oh, Xingchen.

79
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,800
I'll go get her back now.

80
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:35,920
Losers.

81
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,000
None of them can help at all.

82
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,270
I want to go home.

83
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,040
I miss my mother.

84
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,800
Fried chicken, beer, barbecue,
Honor of Kings,

85
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,360
and...

86
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,240
I can't think of anything else.

87
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:05,720
What else is there?

88
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
Oh, no.

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,510
I want to work.

90
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,560
I want to have some meetings.

91
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,120
Sorry.

92
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,480
I was drunk last night.

93
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,070
Pretend nothing happened.

94
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,120
Nothing happened exactly.

95
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,720
(Isn't it a great chance?)

96
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:13,560
(Shen Juan, you have fallen.)

97
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,920
(He's a human.)

98
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,240
(How could you kill a human
just to get back home?)

99
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,680
From this day on,

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,390
I'll be your savior.

101
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,510
Mr. Novel,

102
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,480
he's also from modern times.

103
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:30,240
If I kill him,

104
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,040
can he still return to modern times?

105
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:40,600
Come on, you always slack.

106
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:41,760
You have a bug problem.

107
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,910
I quit.

108
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,190
Miss Juanjuan.

109
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,150
Miss Juanjuan,

110
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:51,510
His Highness ordered

111
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,920
that you shouldn't
do anything from now on.

112
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,750
You just need to take some rest.

113
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:02,560
Xiliu will be your maid.

114
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,390
Hi, Miss Juanjuan.

115
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,110
Your Highness,

116
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:11,190
I haven't found out the arsonist yet.

117
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:13,870
I guess Miss Shen

118
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,720
transpired your track.

119
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,440
That's impossible.

120
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,560
Your Highness...

121
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:20,720
Game starts.

122
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,370
- Fifteen, fifteen, none.
- Fifteen, fifteen, ten.

123
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:26,510
I'm homesick.

124
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,600
In whatever era,

125
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
it's just so good to be rich.

126
00:08:38,270 --> 00:08:39,390
Xiliu.

127
00:08:40,910 --> 00:08:43,200
Where are the most valuable possessions?

128
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:46,790
These? They're valuable?

129
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,000
Juanjuan, a book is like a magic garden.

130
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,790
So, the most valuable possessions here

131
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,360
must be the books His Highness has kept.

132
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:55,870
What you're saying

133
00:08:55,870 --> 00:08:57,510
makes me quite snobbish.

134
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:04,320
Wow.

135
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,000
It's a good story.

136
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,870
Are there more similar books?

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,960
There they are, all the books.

138
00:09:17,870 --> 00:09:21,320
(This relationship can
be perfectly adapted into a drama.)

139
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,720
(This plot is so cool.)

140
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,320

141
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:31,120

142
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:40,910
What are you doing here?

143
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,160
