=Episode 2=

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:20,480
His Highness smiled yesterday.

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,190
That was really abnormal.

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:24,190
He even kept her alive.

6
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:25,960
Think about it...

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:29,160
Xiliu, be gentle.

8
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,000
Have you heard?

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,390
Servants in the front hall want
to buy back their freedom and go home.

10
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,430
Otherwise,

11
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,790
they'd be executed sooner or later.

12
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,470
(I even have a backache
when lying here.)

13
00:00:41,470 --> 00:00:43,150
(But I haven't heard anything useful.)

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,150
- (Fine. I'll just ask them.)
- But look at her.

15
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:47,000
As she's in a coma,

16
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:48,400
she doesn't need
to bother about anything.

17
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:51,470
You know what?

18
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:52,430
I have kept

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:53,880
the three buckets
of dirty clothes for you.

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:55,790
(Laundry work?)

21
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:07,480
Sleep.

22
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,200
Sleep as much as you can.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,510
Don't be angry, Rou.

24
00:01:14,510 --> 00:01:15,870
I'll help Juanjuan do the laundry.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:17,790
You help her?

26
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,400
His Highness has killed
nine maids this month.

27
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,120
She survived today.

28
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,120
And she'll definitely get you in trouble.

29
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:28,000
(Nine?)

30
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,920
(Killing him
will be the right thing, then.)

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:33,710
Get out, all of you!

32
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:34,840
Mercy, Your Highness!

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,350
Get lost!

34
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,840
You useless guys.

35
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,000
You can't even make His Highness happy.

36
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,950
Unless we find someone

37
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:42,920
to please His Highness,

38
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,790
you and I will both be killed.

39
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:46,310
I don't know why, but His Highness

40
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:47,790
lost his interest in us today.

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:48,920
Come on. Leave.

42
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,870
His Highness may have a new taste now.

43
00:01:57,950 --> 00:02:00,070
I have to find someone really excellent.

44
00:02:07,070 --> 00:02:08,120
Miss Shen,

45
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,840
His Highness didn't kill you yesterday.

46
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,870
He must have feelings for you.

47
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,870
If you please His Highness

48
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,710
and serve as a bed-warming maid,

49
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:19,310
we'll all have better days.

50
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:21,240
Bed-warming maid?

51
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,280
You're no longer young.

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,630
Don't play innocent.

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,470
Get in there.

54
00:02:24,470 --> 00:02:26,030
In you go.

55
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,080
Come on.

56
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:35,000
Your Highness, check the new girls.

57
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,870
- (That's all?)
- Miss Juanjuan,

58
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:03,430
dance.

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,000
Dance?

60
00:03:05,150 --> 00:03:06,240
Under such circumstances,

61
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:07,710
dance or get killed!

62
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,910
(Such a weirdo in ancient times.)

63
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:43,030
Hiss.

64
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,910
Your Highness!

65
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,520
Mercy, Your Highness!

66
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,960
Your Highness,

67
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:52,280
you haven't had
an intimate girl for days.

68
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:55,750
I just want to get you
someone intimate, Your Highness!

69
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:57,000
Get out of here!

70
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,710
Leave now.

71
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:01,150
- Yes.
- Yes.

72
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,990
Wait.

73
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:07,360
Butler, you stay here.

74
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Run!

75
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,270
Your Highness,

76
00:04:17,830 --> 00:04:19,480
how may I serve you?

77
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,800
I'll be locking myself up tonight.

78
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,480
Let no one disturb me.

79
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,270
You useless girl!

80
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,070
You missed such good luck!

81
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:32,040
Good luck?

82
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,750
Would you like this kind of luck?

83
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,800
Go away!

84
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:36,300
You big disgrace!

85
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,950
- Such a terrible prince! I'm so pissed off!
- Recently, His Highness has grown more temperamental.

86
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,970
I'm going to cut him into pieces!

87
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:42,390
If I see you again,
I'll cut you and feed you to the dog.

88
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,630
Mr. Novel,

89
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,390
what do I have to do

90
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,950
before you get me out of this novel?

91
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,950
(A red alert for rainstorm
from the weather bureau.)

92
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:10,070
(This heavy rainstorm)

93
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,160
(is expected to last till the next morning.)

94
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:13,350
(Citizens, please stay vigilant.)

95
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,200
Tell me.

96
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:16,240
What is it going to take
to get you on a blind date?

97
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,120
I'm just not going.

98
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,270
Is it really that hard for you

99
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,360
to eat and watch a movie with a girl?

100
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,920
It's a waste of time.

101
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,800
Holding hands or kissing won't hurt you.

102
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,360
You hate contact with women

103
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,920
and that's a disease to be cured.

104
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,310
Say no more.

105
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:32,270
I'm driving.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:33,950
Tell me the truth.

107
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:35,680
You've been single for years.

108
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,800
Is it because you love someone special?

109
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,830
A male, for example?

110
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,150
Your...

111
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:12,750
Assassin!

112
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,750
(Dream?)

113
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:22,030
(Not a dream.)

114
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,240
Wait a minute. I'm not an assassin.

115
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,040
Then who are you?

116
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,390
I am Shen Juanjuan,

117
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,390
the maid.

118
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,630
Liar!

119
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,630
- Shen Juanjuan is a mute.
- (His Highness? Shen Juanjuan?)

120
00:06:35,630 --> 00:06:36,600
(It's Burning Love.)

121
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,870
(Am I stuck in the novel now?)

122
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:45,160
Mr. Novel,
you were injured a few days ago.

123
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,510
Are you getting any better?

124
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:52,070
Kicked into the water by a crazy woman,

125
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,680
I caught a cold and was even injured.

126
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,310
It's all right. I don't deny it.

127
00:06:58,600 --> 00:06:59,600
Just let it go.

128
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:03,150
Mr. Novel,

129
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,680
this is the best cold medicine.

130
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:10,920
Well... Thank you, then.

131
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,190
You, Chen Shen,

132
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:16,750
get stuck in Burning Love
as Chen Shaoheng,

133
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,240
a prince in the novel.

134
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,720
Unless you make the heroine Shen Juanjuan

135
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:21,040
have a 100 favorability value for you,

136
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,830
as written in the novel,

137
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:24,270
you can't return to modern times.

138
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:27,070
If you fail this mission,

139
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,160
you will have to

140
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,000
stay in this world forever.

141
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,240
Or you may die in this world.

142
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:34,860
Then you'll be gone

143
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,500
in both modern times and ancient times.

144
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,820
Who's Shen Juanjuan?

145
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:41,980
The worst dancer tonight.

146
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:46,800
Hiss.

147
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:53,900
Then, Mr. Novel,

148
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,820
what is her favorability value now?

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:01,420
Minus 100.

150
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,700
Minus 100?

151
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,100
It doesn't matter.

152
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,980
Prince Heng is quite charming.

153
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:08,340
Everybody in his mansion adores him.

154
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,580
(Shen Juanjuan's favorability value)

155
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,580
Then I guess,

156
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:20,460
I can complete this mission with ease.

157
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,340
Insane.

158
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,300
What kind of normal girl
would love this terrible prince?

159
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,380
Despised me?

160
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:35,060
Let me give you a fatal stab.

161
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,940
