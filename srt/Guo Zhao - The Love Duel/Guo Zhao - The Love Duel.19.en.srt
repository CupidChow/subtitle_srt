=Episode 19=

3
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,440
Juanjuan.

4
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Chen Shen,

5
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:22,670
I want to go home.

6
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:31,000
I've been carrying this dagger.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:33,790
But now,
it gives me nightmares every night.

8
00:00:34,070 --> 00:00:35,430
I'll have you keep it instead.

9
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:53,470
Don't worry.

10
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:55,280
You have me.

11
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,600
I never rely on anyone else.

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,790
Don't think I need your protection

13
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,030
only because I'm a woman.

14
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,200
Fine, fine.

15
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,310
You're the best, Miss Shen.

16
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,920
But I'm not someone else.

17
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,790
So, in front of me,

18
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,430
you don't need to be strong.

19
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,350
What?

20
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:30,040
Weak, timid,

21
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:31,870
stubborn, and strait-laced.

22
00:01:34,510 --> 00:01:36,120
So, you're mad at Lian Yue for Zhaoyue.

23
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,070
There are strict hierarchies
in ancient times.

24
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,120
It's not all Lian Yue's fault

25
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,280
to think like that.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,120
It's not his fault.

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,710
It can't be Zhaoyue's fault, either.

28
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,200
Yueyin

29
00:01:46,150 --> 00:01:47,040
also wasn't wrong.

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:50,230
Stop thinking about such sad things.

31
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,510
Let me take you out for fun.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,680
That's him!

33
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,360
Prince Heng and his sweet wife!

34
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,750
Smash!

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,310
Terrible prince!

36
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:22,550
Go.

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Your Highness,

38
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:29,310
some philanderers
broke into the town last night

39
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,150
and snatched some girls.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,030
Our former hatchet men also popped up,

41
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,470
robbing the people.

42
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,870
I guess those people were so angry

43
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,710
that they attacked you and Her Highness.

44
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:40,270
I'm guilty, Your Highness.

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:41,470
Please punish me.

46
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:42,560
Your Highness.

47
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,960
Your Highness,

48
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,470
bad news.

49
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:47,120
The servants we demobilized

50
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,870
told everyone
you docked some of their pay

51
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:50,910
and abused them.

52
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:53,400
Well, it is true.

53
00:02:53,520 --> 00:02:56,280
But Your Highness,
you're discredited again.

54
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,590
I guess this is all
what the Crown Prince can do.

55
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,270
Your Highness,

56
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,630
what do we do, then?

57
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:04,680
Have my mansion heavily guarded

58
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:06,280
and don't let anything go wrong again.

59
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,750
Besides, investigate those people.

60
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,360
They must have been bribed.

61
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,710
Yes.

62
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,240
Butler.

63
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:16,280
Tell everyone in my mansion

64
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,150
not to make any trouble again.

65
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,680
I get it.

66
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,310
Greetings, Your Grace.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,840
Your Grace,

68
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,630
it's dangerous out there.

69
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,430
You'd better not go out.

70
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,680
If you insist on going out,

71
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:50,430
take enough guards.

72
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,400
Don't follow...

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,960
It's done.

74
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,270
Good.

75
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,470
You did a good job.

76
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,750
It's wise of you, Your Royal Highness,

77
00:04:17,950 --> 00:04:19,120
and you had a great plan.

78
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,390
But anyway,

79
00:04:22,390 --> 00:04:23,950
I can't let Father know this
for the moment.

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,870
If Father sees something wrong,

81
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:27,240
things will be tough.

82
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,560
His Majesty favors Prince Heng.

83
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:31,750
When you collect the evidence,

84
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:33,720
you don't need to let His Majesty know.

85
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
I'll live here for the next few days

86
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:38,430
in case they assassinate me.

87
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:39,790
Yes.

88
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,160
Next,

89
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:46,360
I'll make more and more people

90
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,920
revile him.

91
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:49,830
Then,

92
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:51,630
I'll request Father to kill him.

93
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:54,560
Tell me what to do.

94
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,560
Think about it.

95
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:00,390
If those people who disturbed Prince Heng

96
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,870
are killed,

97
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,270
who would be the murderer?

98
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,920
To frame His Highness,

99
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,630
they even killed innocent people!

100
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,560
Your Highnesses,

101
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,560
a dozen people were killed overnight.

102
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,270
Even King Changle has known about it.

103
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,190
King Changle?

104
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,720
Your father?

105
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:53,000
You didn't know, Your Highness?

106
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,510
- I...
- The Crown Prince must be behind this.

107
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:57,120
But...

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,040
How can we prove it?

109
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:01,680
Someone killed them
with martial arts of the Lotus Sect.

110
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:04,240
It's Madam Hong.

111
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:05,630
You know, Your Highness?

112
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,180
- Lian Yue,
- I...

113
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,680
all you need to do lately
is protect Her Highness

114
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,830
and Her Grace.

115
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,920
But His Royal Highness targets you.

116
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:14,230
It doesn't matter.

117
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,920
They're my Achilles' heels, too.

118
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Maybe next time,

119
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,750
they'll be the victims.

120
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:19,680
Yes, Your Highness.

121
00:06:28,910 --> 00:06:29,750
What?

122
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,240
What am I to you?

123
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,870
Why am I your Achilles' heel?

124
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,830
Now you're in the mood for a joke.

125
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:39,950
How dare he kill innocent people?

126
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,120
I guess he thinks I can't fight anymore

127
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:43,920
because I've been too depressed, huh?

128
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,870
This is so you, Miss Shen.

129
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,680
Powerful, indeed.

130
00:06:50,190 --> 00:06:51,720
Don't be glib.

131
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:53,160
Now, tell me

132
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,830
about your father King Changle.

133
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:56,390
I've never seen him, either.

134
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,000
When you and I got married,

135
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,310
he sent a letter.

136
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,600
In the letter,

137
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,750
he praised Prince Heng's
unsparing ruling.

138
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:05,480
Knowing I gave out some power,

139
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,680
he praised me for my proper mastery.

140
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:09,310
According to Lian Yue,

141
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:10,750
he's a nice king.

142
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,950
Oh, I see.

143
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,390
No wonder the Crown Prince hates you

144
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:17,360
but doesn't dare to kill you.

145
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:18,920
I think King Changle

146
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,720
is the answer to this problem.

147
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,560
I know what you're thinking.

148
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,070
Don't do anything hasty.

149
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:24,910
I know.

150
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,070
Every move of yours

151
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:27,600
may also be used.

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,560
Now, doing nothing

153
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,720
can be the best plan.

154
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,600
Exactly.

155
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,160
We must not act hastily.

156
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,560
It's done.

157
00:07:38,510 --> 00:07:39,950
Good job.

158
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,360
Looks like

159
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,270
we can make the next move.

160
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:11,150
Shaoheng,

161
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:13,750
you broke in all alone.

162
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:15,600
Quite brave.

163
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,390
What did you come for,

164
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,390
to kill me or threaten me?

165
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,040
I'm asking you!

166
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,720
Why do you not answer?

167
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,190
Say something!

168
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,870
You're dying.

169
00:08:31,630 --> 00:08:33,000
I allow you to say something more.

170
00:08:33,670 --> 00:08:34,960
Take it

171
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,600
as your last word.

172
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:41,630
And then?

173
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,510
Put the key

174
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,600
into the lock under the potted orchid.

175
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:51,000
Spin right

176
00:08:51,390 --> 00:08:52,230
and that's it.

177
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:57,080
You poisoned me.

178
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,420
I won't do anything silly.

179
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:15,380
Even if I die today,

180
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:17,460
your beloved woman

181
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:19,820
will also die with me.

182
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:28,860
