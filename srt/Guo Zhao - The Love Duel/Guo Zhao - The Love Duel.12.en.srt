Both get stuck in the novel.

4
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,400
Missions.

5
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,670
Assassination. Favorability value.

6
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,560
(With contradictory missions,)

7
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,390
(how can we get back together?)

8
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:49,880
(Mr. Novel hasn't appeared
since we last met.)

9
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:53,110
(He's left Juanjuan and me to rot, obviously.)

10
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:59,150
The novel tells a story

11
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:01,880
between Prince Heng and his maid.

12
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,480
If it's only about love,

13
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,400
it has to be very boring.

14
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,480
So, there must be
many inconsistencies and inversions.

15
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:13,200
But why do we have such missions?

16
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,350
She needs to kill me

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,000
while I have to make her love me.

18
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:31,060
Dude,

19
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,920
I'm absolutely loyal to our organization.

20
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:35,200
How can I make you believe this?

21
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,480
Come on, Xingchen.

22
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,150
You refused several times
to kill Prince Heng.

23
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:40,400
What?

24
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:41,840
You have feelings for him?

25
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:44,000
No, I don't.

26
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,200
Don't waste your time.

27
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,510
Suffering from the weakness poison,

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:48,450
you can't break free,
however great martial arts you have.

29
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,120
According to our rules,

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,280
a traitor must be cut to pieces.

31
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,510
But for Yueyin's sake,

32
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:57,760
I can leave you a good corpse.

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,040
Hurry up.

34
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,070
- Please don't.
- Yes.

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:02,310
Come on, don't bury me.

36
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,240
Stop it.

37
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,680
(Luckily, I always carry my dagger.)

38
00:02:29,630 --> 00:02:30,470
After her!

39
00:02:31,150 --> 00:02:32,080
Stop!

40
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,680
Stop running.

41
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:37,470
- Stop!
- Stop!

42
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,240
Stop!

43
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:45,310
Stop!

44
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,470
Stop running!

45
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:11,840
Since you don't obey us,

46
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,430
we'll have to be merciless.

47
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:14,590
Get her!

48
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,430
Leave.

49
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:21,920
Glad you're here.

50
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:24,870
Today, I'm going to kill you both.

51
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:38,550
Darn it.

52
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,520
If I run away like this,

53
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,630
I'll be a terrible person.

54
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,680
He's a living man, after all.

55
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:55,920
Oh, no.

56
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,240
Chen Shen.

57
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,960
Chen Shen, are you all right?

58
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,000
Chen Shen.

59
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:26,640
Chen Shen.

60
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:29,870
Chen Shen!

61
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,030
Don't...

62
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,160
Don't die, Chen Shen!

63
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,840
Chen Shen!

64
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:38,230
Chen Shen!

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,510
Chen Shen, you can't die!

66
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,390

67
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,240

87
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,950
I never take advantage of anyone.

88
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,800

All right.

92
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,720
How did you find me?

93
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,600
Yesterday, some assassins broke in.

94
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,270
They had your lotus tattoo.

95
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:55,800
So, I guessed

96
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,940
the Lotus Sect abandoned you.

97
00:05:59,070 --> 00:05:59,910
I thought

98
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,630
you would be in danger.

99
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,430
Later, I found your stuff in the alley.

100
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:06,630
Then, I followed the track of the horses

101
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,760
until I ended up behind the mountain.

102
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,510
Yesterday, I nearly died there.

103
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,630
You betrayed them.

104
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,510
You may get in bigger danger.

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,680
But it's all right.

106
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:19,950
Stay in my mansion without worry.

107
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,480
I will protect you.

108
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,120
The Lotus Sect
has a visceral hatred for you.

109
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,720
Eliminate them as soon as you can.

110
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:28,830
Are you worried about me?

111
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,480
I'm worried about myself.

112
00:06:35,390 --> 00:06:36,240
Fine.

113
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,230
Don't be scared.

114
00:06:40,950 --> 00:06:41,950
I'll protect you.

115
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm not scared.

116
00:06:45,430 --> 00:06:46,270
Shaoheng!

117
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
I'm all right.

118
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,190
Where's Lian Yue? Is he injured?

119
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:52,350
Your Highness.

120
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,930
Early this morning, I got to know
my brother was assassinated.

121
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,630
Then I knew you would have a fight again.

122
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,560
Thank you for your concern, Your Grace.

123
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,360
I'm all right.

124
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,800
You have great martial arts.

125
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,070
I knew you would be all right.

126
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,840
Oh, no.

127
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,790
However strong you are,

128
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,480
I should order
some defensive armors for you.

129
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,750
I'm on it now.

130
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,880
Hurry.

131
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,830

and a proud princess.

132
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,720
Such a perfect couple.

133

I'll put forward this project
after I'm back there.

134
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,070
Don't snatch it.

135
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
Whatever you say, Miss Shen.

136
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:37,160
Now, we're companions in misfortune.

137
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:39,560
How about we end up in handshakes?

138
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,840
I won't try to kill you anymore.

139
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,040
Let's do a win-win cooperation

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,800
and together explore the way back home.

141
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,840
