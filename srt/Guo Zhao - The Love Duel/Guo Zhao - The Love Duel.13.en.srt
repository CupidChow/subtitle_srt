00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:13,260
=The Love Duel=

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
=Episode 13=

3
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:22,480
Why are you...

4
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,600
I don't want you to think
I'm seducing you.

5
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:29,960
I'm a producer.

6
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,600
I've seen all kinds of cute guys.

7
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,990
You're right.

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,560
You're sophisticated, Miss Shen.

9
00:00:36,110 --> 00:00:38,470
Oh, I'll live with Lian Yue.

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:40,910
What?

11
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,280
The assassins may attack me.

12
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,350
I must be alert even in the night.

13
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,880
Lian Yue has great martial arts.

14
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,150
Living with him

15
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,320
will certainly make me feel secure.

16
00:00:52,070 --> 00:00:52,920
I don't approve.

17
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,640
Whoever I stay with

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,790
has nothing to do with you.

19
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:59,150
I mean,

20
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,240
Zhaoyue likes Lian Yue.

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,960
If she knows about it, she'll be sad.

22
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,950
Who says I like Lian Yue?

23
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:06,350
You don't?

24
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:07,190
I don't.

25
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,400
But you...

26
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:09,840
Do you like Lian Yue?

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,400
No, I don't.

28
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,350
Who do you like, then?

29
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,520
I...

30
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,200
I don't like anyone.

31
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,150
Liar.

32
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,350
Anyway, I don't like Lian Yue.

33
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:21,840
What do you mean?

34
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,710
Lian Yue is so good.
Why don't you like him?

35
00:01:27,640 --> 00:01:28,510
Let's go.

36
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,520
It's girls' stuff.

37
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:30,550
He shouldn't listen.

38
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,350
Come on.

39
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,510
Don't... Don't talk nonsense.

40
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:37,000
I don't like Lian Yue.

41
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:40,950
When a modern girl pursues love,

42
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,590
she should first learn about this.

43
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,790
A real hunter

44
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,710
should disguise herself as prey.

45
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,960
Prey?

46
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,510
What does it mean?

47
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,040
Think about it.

48
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:54,200
You acted several times but failed.

49
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,230
Why don't you be passive instead?

50
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,790
Stay sometimes near and sometimes far.

51
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:01,040
Be sometimes hot and sometimes cold.

52
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,310
He likes you.

53
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:04,150
When he can't figure out what you think,

54
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:06,070
he'll be anxious, won't he?

55
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:10,000
Are you saying Lian Yue likes me?

56
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:12,030
I ensure you with your brother's life,

57
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:13,240
he really loves you.

58
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:17,430
So what?

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,190
I don't like him.

60
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,200
Girl,

61
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,430
when you can't even face your heart,

62
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,190
how can you get true love?

63
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:30,630
By then, you'll have to watch Lian Yue

64
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:32,120
- marry someone else.
- No way!

65
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,190
Then what are you waiting for?

66
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,870
Let him know how great it feels

67
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,710
to get intimate.

68
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:44,520
What should I do, then?

69
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,200
What's the smell?

70
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:08,680
She left in such a hurry.

71
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:19,230
If we still don't fight back,

72
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,710
we'll both be dead.

73
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:24,260
(Kill)

74
00:03:24,470 --> 00:03:26,910
In this kind of novel,
there's always a big villain.

75
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:28,000
We must find him out

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,080
and take him down.

77
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:29,990
Yes.

78
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:32,000
Usually, the outer conflict
in a romantic novel

79
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,120
comes from enemies,

80
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,470
love rivals, or political opponents.

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:37,470
Now, it seems

82
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:38,710
that neither you nor I

83
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:40,630
have love rivals or enemies.

84
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,030
So, I guess this is the problem,

85
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:44,080
"power".

86
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,820
(Power)

87
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:49,520
Good point.

88
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:50,920
This is a meeting.

89
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,310
Don't laugh.

90
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,400
Go on, Miss Shen.

91
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,670
Go on.

92
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,120
Prince Heng
is the second eldest lineal son.

93
00:03:56,150 --> 00:03:58,030
The son of the king's first wife
will take the throne.

94
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,080
But Prince Heng
controls the military power

95
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,190
with the help of all forces.

96
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:03,430
So, the one who wants to kill you is...

97
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,280
- Is...
- The Crown Prince.

98
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:07,630
Prince Heng is over-mighty.

99
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,280
People fawn on him implicitly.

100
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,840
The Crown Prince's position is at stake.

101
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
When he can't take you down
on the surface,

102
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:13,590
he has to secretly

103
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,630
send the assassins from the Lotus Sect.

104
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:18,110
It's really smart of you.

105
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,390
Don't be too self-deprecating.

106
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:22,000
It's normal that you can't figure this out.

107
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,070
After all, I've done a lot of projects

108
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,830
and I can guess how the story will end up
without reading the novel.

109
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:29,510
Anyway,

110
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:33,480
let's first stay alive

111
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,840
before we try to get back home.

112
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
She's trying so hard to be strong.

113
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:12,070
(Most forces in town
support Prince Heng.)

114
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,730
(I'll first delegate some power
to show my attitude.)

115
00:05:14,870 --> 00:05:16,160
(After getting rid of the assassins,)

116
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,270
(I'll think of a way
to take her back home.)

117
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,500
(Marriage Contract)

118
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,350
(Marriage contract?)

119
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,000
Butler Zhao,

120
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,160
the Chief Minister's
eldest daughter and I...

121
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:37,120
You're right, Your Highness.

122
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,750
On the eighth day of next month,

123
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:41,480
you'll marry the Chief Minister's daughter.

124
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,950
It's time to prepare for it.

125
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,520
What?

126
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:49,160
Shen Juanjuan is just favored
by His Highness.

127
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,750
She sees herself as a real noblewoman.

128
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:53,070
This dirty woman

129
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:54,680
will never end up well.

130
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,390
That's right.

131
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,640
Xingchen.

132
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:28,510
Madam Hong sent me to kill you.

133
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,430
Why is she still so silly?

134
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:34,310
How would I ever hurt you?

135
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,800
I'll take you away from the Lotus Sect

136
00:06:43,070 --> 00:06:44,510
and live a normal life ever after.

137
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,390
(So, he's the soulful secondary character.)

138
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,360
(The assassin Yueyin)

139
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,800
(who grew up with Xingchen.)

140
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,270
I know.

141
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,120
You've always taken me as your brother.

142
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,270
But to you, I...

143
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,240
Go with me.

144
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:01,240
Let's not be assassins anymore.

145
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,670
Will you?

146
00:07:03,950 --> 00:07:04,790
But

147
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,680
so many guards are around.

148
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
I'm afraid...

149
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,070
I killed them all.

150
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,440
Of course,

151
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,560
I also killed those two women
who insulted you.

152
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,390
You killed them?

153
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,960
What about Prince Heng?

154
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
The terrible prince, I mean.

155
00:07:26,870 --> 00:07:28,120
He bullied you so much

156
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,800
and even made you sleep in his room.

157
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:31,160
I should have killed him.

158
00:07:32,630 --> 00:07:34,390
But I have to take you away tonight

159
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,720
and I can't cause too much trouble.

160
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:39,510
Glad he isn't dead.

161
00:07:42,270 --> 00:07:43,110
You're in love with him?

162
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,440
No.

163
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,270
Shen Juan!

164
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,670
Shen Juan!

165
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,750
I didn't mean to kill you,

166
00:07:52,190 --> 00:07:53,240
but you came around.

167
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,640
Sweetheart.

168
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,190
Don't... Don't kill him.

169
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,950
- Sweetheart?
- No.

170
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:01,240
I'm not in love with him.

171
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:02,270
I mean,

172
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:04,390
let me kill him.

173
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,270
(What a dramatic scene!)

174
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:32,830
Sweetheart, if you keep fighting,

175
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:33,680
neither of us can leave.

176
00:08:33,790 --> 00:08:35,120
Prince Heng won't hurt me for the moment.

177
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:37,030
You go first.
I'll go see you when possible.

178
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:42,390
Keep it in reserve.

179
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,440
All right.

180
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,800
After him!

181
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,160
What?

182
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,440
Sweetheart?

183
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:07,270
To stay alive,

184
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:08,760
what's the problem of keeping a backup?

185
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,280
Who's he?

186
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,320
The secondary character.

187
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:12,490
He's from the Lotus Sect, too.

188
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,320
He said he would take me away

189
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,960
to live a carefree life.

190
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,000
Anyway, he won't hurt me.

191
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,960
He's handsome and soulful.

192
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,400
If I were the real Shen Juanjuan,

193
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,790
I'd pick him.

194
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,960
Are you sure?

195
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,630
He just killed seven guards.

196
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:36,960
I pick you.

197
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,670
Your Highness, I'm sorry

198
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:43,510
that I let him get away.

199
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,680
It doesn't matter.

200
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:49,150
Can you live here tonight?

201
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,440
We'll only talk instead of sleeping.

202
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,000
All right.

203
00:10:10,390 --> 00:10:11,230
Xingchen,

204
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:12,750
wait for me.

205
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,080
I will take you away someday.
