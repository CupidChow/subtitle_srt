3
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:18,940
Take off your dress.

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,060
What?

5
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:22,020
What?

6
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,700
Don't you get it?

7
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:29,340
Flirt!

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:30,820
Give your order to the Death Lord!

9
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,020
(I'm a babe in the woods.)

10
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,260
(I'm a babe in the woods.)

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,540
(Bear it.)

12
00:00:41,860 --> 00:00:43,380
(I have to bear it.)

13
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,020
Take it off, quickly.

14
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,420
Yes.

15
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:50,060
I'm on it now.

16
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,500
(Yeah.)

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,180
(If I drown him,)

18
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,740
(I can complete
the assassination mission.)

19
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:04,220
(With a seductive trick,)

20
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:06,580
(I can do this difficult mission
even without a weapon.)

21
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,900
(Mr. Novel, music.)

22
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,140
(Can the lotus)

23
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,660
(on her shoulder be the scar?)

24
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,500
Your Highness.

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:07,450
(Die!)

26
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,500
Close.

27
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,180
So close.

28
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,940
Let go of me.

29
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,140
What?

30
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,220
(I nearly fell for that.)

31
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:30,860
Congratulations, mission completed.

32
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:32,620
Through physical closeness,

33
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,220
you managed to lower
Prince Heng's guard.

34
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,220
More bonuses

35
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,540
are coming.

36
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:42,420
Stop this nonsense. Darn it.

37
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:49,220
Three days.

38
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:50,580
Three days.

39
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:51,700
Within three days,

40
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,220
I will kill him!

41
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:00,180
Your Highness,

42
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,020
will you have Miss Shen serve you today?

43
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,340
No need.

44
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,820
Your Highness,

45
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,060
what is wrong with your voice?

46
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,060
After Miss Shen took care
of you for only one night,

47
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:14,460
you caught a cold.

48
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,900
This is ridiculous.

49
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,380
It doesn't matter.

50
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:20,820
Oh, Your Highness,

51
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,220
Miss Shen has a magic prescription

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,140
for the voice thing, right?

53
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:26,020
I'll ask her to make the decoction now.

54
00:04:27,460 --> 00:04:28,860
I'm glad his voice is hoarse.

55
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,380
What magic decoction can I get him?

56
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,020
Oh, here it is.

57
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:15,900
Honey,

58
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,860
come take the decoction.

59
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Your Highness,

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:27,020
this is the decoction that cured me.

61
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,020
Drink it.

62
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,260
During the bath,

63
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:31,740
sorry to have scared you.

64
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,980
Your Highness,

65
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,860
when your voice is hoarse,

66
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,420
you still care about me.

67
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,220
I really appreciate it.

68
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:42,660
Drink it before it gets cold.

69
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,140
(Coffee, fried chicken,
hot pot, and river snails rice noodles,)

70
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,900
(I'm coming back!)

71
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,660
Bad news.

72
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:04,060
Bad news, Juanjuan.

73
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,740
My dog drank the decoction you made

74
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,340
and it suddenly died.

75
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,220
Don't drink it!

76
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,780
It's poisonous, Your Highness!

77
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:39,820
(If I play innocent,)

78
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:41,580
(can I be cleared?)

79
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,780
Your Highness,

80
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:45,340
someone must have poisoned the decoction

81
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,980
when I was making it.

82
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,540
(Is it possible)

83
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,060
(that she wants to kill me?)

84
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,900
(Help, help.)

85
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,460
(Silly prince, trust me.)

86
00:06:54,660 --> 00:06:55,500
(No way.)

87
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,660
(Based on the introduction
of Burning Love,)

88
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,650
(I can at least survive 33 days)

89
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,140
(after I'm in love with her.)

90
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:01,980
Lian Yue,

91
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:03,820
what do you think?

92
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,260
Kill.

93
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,700
Kill the one who poisoned the decoction

94
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:13,540
when Miss Shen was making it.

95
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:15,380
Exactly.

96
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,620
A dark figure

97
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:18,500
flashed by outside my window.

98
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:19,660
I remember his figure

99
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:20,940
and I will help with your investigation.

100
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,260
All right.

101
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:24,780
Then come work for me.

102
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:28,340
You don't want it?

103
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,260
I do.

104
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,500
I certainly do.

105
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:34,340
- (Here's my chance.)
- (Here's my chance.)

106
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,540
My dear knives, things are tense now.

107
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,660
I can't take action.

108
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,900
When I have time,

109
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,020
I'll come and get you back.

110
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:06,140
What was she doing?

111
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,140
Sharpening some knives.

112
00:08:22,980 --> 00:08:25,230
All these wicked things.

113
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,380
From now on,

114
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:31,060
give her all the best things.

115
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm sure.

116
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,020
Finally, I feel better.

117
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:42,900
His Highness ordered

118
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:45,220
you should be given

119
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,020
the best food, clothes,
and daily necessities.

120
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:49,700
You have the highest pay, too.

121
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:53,260
What do you think?

122
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:55,300
Does this new room satisfy you?

123
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:57,940
Thank you, Your Highness.

124
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:00,020
I love this room.

125
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,060
You're welcome.

126
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:05,980
For you,

127
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,370
I always have the best.

128
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:12,100
(Help.)

129
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:13,900
(Such a rustic love story.)

130
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:19,420
These...

00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,860
They're all yours, huh?

132
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,500
