00:00:06,260 --> 00:00:13,260
=The Love Duel=

2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
=Episode 6=

3
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:19,870
These...

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,350
They're all yours, huh?

5
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,070
Your Highness, let me explain.

6
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:30,280
(Oh, no.)

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,760
(I'm dead.)

8
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,310
It doesn't matter.

9
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:40,660
I understand.

10
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:45,220
From this day on,

11
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,780
I'll give you the best life.

12
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,300
You no longer need
to sell knives for a living.

13
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,500
Why does she have these?

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,300
I guess she has to sell them
for some money

15
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,650
because she does a lot of laundry,

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,860
gets a low pay,

17
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:06,620
and is always bullied.

18
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,780
Now,

19
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,160
she's with you, Your Highness.

20
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:10,780
She no longer needs
to sharpen these knives.

21
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:15,300
Are you sure?

22
00:01:16,660 --> 00:01:18,860
All these wicked things.

23
00:01:19,100 --> 00:01:20,660
I'm sure.

24
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:21,820
In this case,

25
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:24,140
from now on,

26
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,300
give her all the best things.

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,260
Yes, Your Highness.

28
00:01:34,940 --> 00:01:35,900
Your Highness,

29
00:01:36,620 --> 00:01:38,300
you really are

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:39,620
my savior.

31
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,140
(This prince is such a fool.)

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,100
(She's moved.)

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,020
(Her favorability value
must be above zero now.)

34
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,660
What?

35
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,020
Are you sure you get the right number?

36
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:00,660
The favorability value is minus 300.

37
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,580
That's impossible.

38
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:03,700
She smiled so sweetly at me.

39
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,740
How could it be minus 300?

40
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,740
Do the calculation again.

41
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,260
The favorability value is minus 300.

42
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:13,820
Fine.

43
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,500
So,

44
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,060
the rating system doesn't work.

45
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:23,860
Your Highness.

46
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:25,740
Come in.

47
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,340
The dancer who assassinated you

48
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:28,340
has a lotus tattoo.

49
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,620
I guess some organization

50
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,580
arranged this assassination.

51
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,140
What enemies do I have?

52
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,290
The Zhou Family of the East Sea,

53
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,680
the Wang Family of Jiangnan,

54
00:02:37,700 --> 00:02:38,740
the Murong Family of the North,

55
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,260
Golden Scabbard, the Killer,

56
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:41,860
- and...
- All right.

57
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,140
Say no more.

58
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,740
I won't go out anymore.

59
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:47,660
Get me three times more guards
in my mansion.

60
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,500
Oh, no.

61
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,740
Five times more.

62
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,620
Yes.

63
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,780
Wait, Lian Yue.

64
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:54,500
Lian Yue,

65
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:55,940
do you know

66
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:58,620
how to make girls happy?

67
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,420
I don't.

68
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:02,340
Do you think

69
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:03,940
they love honeyed words?

70
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:05,100
I really don't know.

71
00:03:05,510 --> 00:03:06,380
You're right.

72
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,660
She loves honeyed words, I believe.

73
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,380
I really have no idea.

74
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,060
Wait.

75
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,060
Go have your eye on Juanjuan.

76
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,900
Your Highness, you suspect her?

77
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,460
Just go...

78
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,580
Go have your eye on her.

79
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,540
The rating system just doesn't work.

80
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:26,700
Lian Yue,

81
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,220
where's the essay I asked you to write?

82
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,580
Why haven't you given it to me yet?

83
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:31,860
Your Grace,
there have been assassins lately.

84
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:33,780
You'd better stay indoors.

85
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,140
I'm not scared.

86
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,620
I've been learning martial arts
since little.

87
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:39,140
I'll kill all the assassins.

88
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,700
Besides,

89
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,700
you will protect me.

90
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:45,220
Right?

91
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,740
What about the essay?

92
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,140
You didn't read the novel, did you?

93
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,900
All the compliments, as I expected.

94
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,340
Just between us,

95
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:09,500
I actually wrote this novel.

96
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:10,780
Surprised, huh?

97
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,700
Within one day,

98
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,180
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

99
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,220
the man and the woman kissed five times.

100
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,020
Her Grace is really...

101
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,500
Your Grace,

102
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:32,900
it's really literary of you.

103
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,460
Then why did no one buy my novel?

104
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,420
They must have a poor taste.

105
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:41,980
Oh,

106
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:42,940
I heard

107
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:45,020
my brother personally
asked a laundry girl

108
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,340
to take care of him.

109
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:48,460
Is she someone trustworthy?

110
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,740
You don't know how to dress me?

111
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:56,500
Not really.

112
00:04:56,660 --> 00:04:58,100
Your Highness, please teach me.

113
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,660
It's all right.

114
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,020
Whatever you do,

115
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
I'll appreciate it.

116
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,820
I'll do it myself.

117
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,500
I can do it myself, too.

118
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,300
You did a lot.

119
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,300
Well done.

120
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,460
What's wrong?

121
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,460
You can't untie it?

122
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,900
I guess

123
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:28,340
I tied the belt inextricably.

124
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:31,820
It doesn't matter.

125
00:05:32,260 --> 00:05:33,580
However you tie the belt,

126
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:35,260
it's the best for me.

127
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,220
All right, then.

128
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,140
I'll untie it myself.

129
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:49,820
See you, Your Highness.

130
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,060
I still found no chance to kill him.

131
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:58,140
He has really a lot of tricks

132
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,460
and keeps saying honeyed words.

133
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,300
He's even more showy than a peacock.

134
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,420
- Your Highness.
- What's up?

135
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:07,900
In my opinion,

136
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,180
Miss Shen

137
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,580
is lazy, gluttonous, and silly.

138
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:12,660
Your Highness,

139
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,780
why don't you have a wiser maid?

140
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:18,980
(It's indeed a five-star mission.)

141
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,980
(Can I not complete it)

142
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:23,060
(even in my seventies or eighties?)

143
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:25,500
(No way.
I have to ask Zhang San about it.)

144
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,260
Zhang San,

145
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,180
is there a time limit for my mission?

146
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,900
Humph, he's slacking again.

147
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,340
After serving you in the morning,

148
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,740
she usually sleeps until noon.

149
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:39,220
During merely three days,

150
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,100
she ruined four of your belts,

151
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,460
broke five cups,

152
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:44,020
and cursed you several times

153
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:45,420
for making her work.

154
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:48,740
(No wonder
her favorability value declined.)

155
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:50,740
(So, she doesn't like working.)

156
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,980
Burning Love is about a love story

157
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:55,220
between the maid and the terrible prince.

158
00:06:55,660 --> 00:06:56,900
I don't need to complete this mission

159
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,940
in 33 days, do I?

160
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,700
Oh, no.

161
00:07:02,700 --> 00:07:04,300
I must take action tonight.

162
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,340
I'll take my leave, Your Highness.

163
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:14,060
(Courting her with honeyed words
takes too much time.)

164
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:16,460
(I need a faster solution.)

165
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:31,140
Your Highness, why are you back?

166
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,340
(Is she really
the weak and kind heroine?)

167
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,340
Juanjuan, you've been exhausted lately.

168
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,420
So, I've decided, from this day on,

169
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:46,660
I'll have someone else take care of me.

170
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:47,840
You take a good rest.

171
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:49,180
(Then, I'll have no chance.)

172
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,340
No way.

173
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:53,300
I haven't given you
any personal care yet.

174
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:55,380
Tonight. How about tonight?

175
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,500
Let me take care of you.

176
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:58,980
Tonight?

177
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,260
(Maybe)

178
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:03,340
(this is a chance for a faster solution.)

179
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,900
Your Highness,

180
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,980
let me take care of you tonight.

181
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:11,180
Just the two of us,

182
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,460
you and me.

183
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,660
Whatever you say.

184
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
(This is it.)

185
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,180
(One stab in his heart)

186
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,300
(and he will die.)

187
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,300
Your Highness.

188
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,860
(She's going to steal a kiss.)

189
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:00,500
(I think I should do this first.)

190
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,740
