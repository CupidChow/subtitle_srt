3
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,000
Seriously?

4
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:28,120
Are you really
giving all this to us, Your Highness?

5
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:30,600
I used to be straightforward

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,550
and quick-tempered.

7
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:34,000
I always ignored your feelings
when I talked or acted.

8
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,200
Sorry.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
Take all this as compensation.

10
00:00:37,790 --> 00:00:39,600
Don't say this, Your Highness.

11
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,560
You've been

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:41,880
really nice to us.

13
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,200
Honestly?

14
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,750
Actually,

15
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,750
I used to serve Prince Heng before.

16
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:49,710
This is nothing.

17
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,590
You're right.

18
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,030
If it weren't for Prince Heng,

19
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,560
I wouldn't have thought this much.

20
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,390
Xiliu,

21
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,350
you care about me most in this mansion.

22
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,880
I know you've been living frugally.

23
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:02,840
From now on,
eat and buy whatever you want.

24
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:04,070
When you're out of money, come to me.

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,790
I no longer need the money, anyway.

26
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,640
Juanjuan,

27
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:11,790
you...

28
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,560
I don't want to leave you.

29
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,430
(I don't know if you'll also disappear)

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,120
(after the world collapses.)

31
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,480
(I got you into this, after all.)

32
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,040
Don't be so sad.

33
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,070
Anyway, it's a pleasure to meet you.

34
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:33,350
(Her Highness must be saying goodbye)

35
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:34,870
(because she's badly sick.)

36
00:01:34,870 --> 00:01:36,560
(Behave yourself!)

37
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,230
Will you also give us

38
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,230
what you have in your bedroom?

39
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,790
Juanjuan...

40
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:54,040
It's all right.

41
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,510
Someone stole your things?

42
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,360
I just did some charity.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:11,270
What?

44
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,710
In a pretty good mood, huh?

45
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,000
A piece of good news.

46
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,800
And a piece of bad news.

47
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:20,750
The bad news is

48
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,120
we have changed the story

49
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,590
and this world will collapse.

50
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,840
How do you know?

51
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,150
Who told you?

52
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,120
I guessed.

53
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:28,840
Snow in October is really weird.

54
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,030
Everybody knows that.

55
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:35,190
What about the good news?

56
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,000
I've found the way back.

57
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
To modern times?

58
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:40,630
Together?

59
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,190
Neither of us has to die?

60
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:45,150
- Let's go, then.
- Wait.

61
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,080
We came to this world

62
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,150
because of the comet.

63
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,420
I guess there must be
the Astronomy Department here.

64
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,990
Then I asked about
the astronomical phenomena.

65
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,430
According to the Astronomy Department,

66
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:57,940
a meteor will shoot
across the sky tonight.

67
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,460
So,

68
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,020
is the meteor enough?

69
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,900
Since this world

70
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:05,100
exists upon a novel,

71
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,860
there must be a connection

72
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:08,500
between the virtual and real parts.

73
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:10,290
I was looking for some abnormality.

74
00:03:10,550 --> 00:03:11,460
Until recently,

75
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:13,250
I finally found something abnormal

76
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,090
on the top of a mountain.

77
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,300
It wasn't snowing there at all.

78
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,620
That's a bug!

79
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:21,580
So, when we go up there tonight,

80
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,660
we can go home.

81
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,620
You're awesome!

82
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,300
This time,

83
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,220
you win.

84
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,260
I've lost myself to you.

85
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,860
I don't need to win.

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,500
What are you thinking?

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,980
About how to compete with you

88
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,260
after we go back there.

89
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,220
I won't just let you win.

90
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,820
Fine.

91
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:11,300
Let's fight to make money

92
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,780
and get investment.

93
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:16,140
Money?

94
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,540
If I were still an ordinary butler,

95
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:23,300
I would eat up all this.

96
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,020
But now,

97
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,140
I'm not an ordinary butler.

98
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:29,740
Take it away.

99
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:33,500
I will get something better.

100
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,460
Her Highness ordered,

101
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,180
you and I should share it evenly.

102
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,340
Who are you to share it evenly with me?

103
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,780
- I...
- Butler.

104
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,460
Your Highness.

105
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:51,780
The compensation I just gave you.

106
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,740
Is it all here?

107
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:54,420
- Yes.
- Good.

108
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,940
Pack it up and send it to my room.

109
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,140
All right.

110
00:05:02,180 --> 00:05:03,500
Even this one?

111
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,020
Because I have something better for you.

112
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,860
Here.

113
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:07,860
One for each of you.

00:05:29,980 --> 00:05:32,340
(I'll have investment.)

119
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,220
What's this?

120
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,220
It's a rare trip.

121
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,820
We should take some local products back.

122
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:46,900

123
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740

124
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:50,060
I've left your indenture to you.

125
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:51,980
If one day,

126
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:53,460
I become brutal again,

127
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:55,500
remember to run away.

128
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,660
Your Highness, you must be testing me.

129
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,140
I'm always loyal to you.

130
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,940
Come on. Stop acting.

131
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,700
Remember what His Highness told you.

132
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:05,860
I will.

134
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,740
I'm so happy to meet you.

135

Don't forget what I taught you.

136
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:18,860
When you're back,
teach me something more.

137
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:21,540
I don't think I can come back.

138
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,540
Under your bed,

139
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:27,020
I put some money and your indenture.

140
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:28,220
Go back home now.

141
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,700
