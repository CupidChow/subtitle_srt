3
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:31,780
Your Highness.

4
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:43,020
Are you all right, Miss Shen?

5
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:44,700
I'm all right.

6
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,860
Thank you, Your Highness.

7
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,340
(He didn't give me a hand,
but now he's caring about me.)

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:50,780
(What a bummer!)

9
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,940
(She's getting shy.)

10
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,340
(She must have feelings for me.)

11
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,520
- Let's go to the garden.
- Let's go to the garden.

12
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:04,900
They're for you.

13
00:01:09,620 --> 00:01:11,340
Such beautiful flowers.

14
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,620
Because

15
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,100
I don't want you to have no present

16
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:21,340
while someone else does.

17
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:24,180
(Tacky.)

18
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,980
(So old-fashioned.)

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,420
What... What do you want?

20
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:40,900
Wait a minute!

21
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:48,860
Why haven't you
said happy birthday to me?

22
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,860
Happy birthday.

23
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,900
What about my present?

24
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,780
Fine.

25
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,900
I'll pretend
you forgot to get me a present.

26
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:03,500
I order you to give it to me tomorrow.

27
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:05,180
Aye, Your Grace.

28
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,900
Aye, aye.

29
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,500
That's what you always say.

30
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:13,420
Your Grace,

31
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,420
His Highness needs to be waited on.

32
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,140
I should go.

33
00:02:17,500 --> 00:02:18,580
Stop right there.

34
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:21,980
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

35
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,900
Finish reading this within three days

36
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,420
and write an essay of a thousand words.

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,300
Leave this to me, Your Highness.

38
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:50,780
What are you doing?

39
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,540
(Darn it.)

40
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:02,380
I'm sexy,

41
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,780
aren't I?

42
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,580
Shaoheng,

43
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,460
what are you doing?

44
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:18,460
I'm measuring His Highness's height.

45
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:20,460
With your leg?

46
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,300
Mm.

47
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:22,900
Shaoheng,

48
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,740
is that true?

49
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
It's an adult thing.

50
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:33,190
A young girl like you
should stay out of it.

51
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:53,380
Let me measure your height, too.

52
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,420
Don't go.

53
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,340
For your information, Chief,

54
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:59,140
Hongwu failed her assassination.

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:01,420
What about her?

56
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,460
She hasn't given herself away yet.

57
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,340
Besides,

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,140
we've heard from Mr. Yueyin.

59
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:12,740
(Such a great chance was gone again.)

60
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,100
(Luckily, I got back my dagger.)

61
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,340
(Or there would be more trouble.)

62
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,340
Bullying in such a terrible workplace?

63
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,260
Who did this?

64
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,260
Come out!

65
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,460
Who are you?

66
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,620
It's me.

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:32,540
What happened to your face?

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:34,100
Rou did that.

69
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,260
She said I couldn't clean my face

70
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,580
before I washed these clothes.

71
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:45,220
Juanjuan, where are you going?

72
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,900
See how I'm going to curse you.

73
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:52,620
You.

74
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,980
What... What do you want?

75
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,900
To curse you.

76
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:58,700
You witch... Bla, bla, bla...

77
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,540
(What is going on?)

78
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,300
Bla, bla, bla...

79
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:06,900
Sorry.

80
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:19,540
Juanjuan,

81
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:21,300
let's just do our work.

82
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,460
(What happened just now?)

83
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,300
(Such wonderful curse words...)

84
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:30,980
(But I failed to say any.)

85
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,060
Miss Shen,

86
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,420
any words against your persona

87
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:37,220
have to be banned.

88
00:05:37,980 --> 00:05:38,820
Zhang San?

89
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,220
You've shown up at last.

90
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,540
I was in hospital
for a work-related injury.

91
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,380
What?

92
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:53,620
I'm so sorry.

93
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:56,140
Are you saying

94
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,820
I can't curse anyone?

95
00:05:57,820 --> 00:06:00,100
Shen Juanjuan is a babe in the woods.

96
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:02,060
How would she ever use swear words?

97
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:04,100
Every time you go against this persona,

98
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:05,420
you'll be silenced.

99
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,780
What kind of fool made this rule?

100
00:06:08,540 --> 00:06:09,420
You did.

101
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:10,660
You told me.

102
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,580
The wrong persona
would cause big trouble.

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,940
My superior thought
it made perfect sense.

104
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,980
So, he made the rule for you.

105
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,220
Oh, darn it.

106
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,740
This is a bonus mission.

107
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,460
As a famous scene in the novel,

108
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,180
it advanced
Shen Juanjuan's assassination.

109
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,300
Take it as an apology.

110
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:33,020
That's more like it.

111
00:06:35,380 --> 00:06:37,420
To bathe Prince Heng?

112
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:38,580
You call this a bonus?

113
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:41,380
It's once in a lifetime opportunity...

114
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:42,900
Come over here.

115
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,340
(Check Juanjuan's scar)
Bonus mission?

116
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,460
Check Juanjuan's scar.

117
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:52,580
It's an important scene

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,820
where the hero and heroine get closer.

119
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,300
Do it wisely.

120
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:00,940
(In TV dramas,)

121
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,500
(there's always a sad story behind a scar.)

122
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,060
(When I comfort her accordingly,)

123
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:10,380
(she'll easily have feelings for me.)

124
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,180
Butler.

125
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:18,020
Butler!

126
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,700
Your Highness,

127
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,700
here I am.

128
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:23,420
When I take a bath today,

129
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,710
do have Shen Juanjuan

130
00:07:26,420 --> 00:07:28,180
wait on me personally.

131
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,660
Miss Juanjuan,

132
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:33,180
when you bathe His Highness,

133
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,220
be very careful.

134
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,020
If you hurt him,

135
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,820
you'll be decapitated.

136
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:42,860
Why didn't you say so at first? I quit.

137
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,620
No way.

138
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,980
You begged me

139
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,660
to have you bathe His Highness.

140
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:50,540
Look, you are of one mind.

141
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,940
You want to bathe His Highness

142
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:55,820
and His Highness wants that, too.

143
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,580
Off you go.

144
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,460
(Now, I'm in a real dilemma.)

145
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,500
Your Highness,

146
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,780
I'm here to bathe you.

147
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,180
(It's the first time
that a woman bathes me.)

148
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,340
(I'm so embarrassed.)

149
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:15,060
(It's the first time that I bathe a man.)

150
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,140
(Such bad luck.)

151
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:19,990
- (Isn't it way too awkward?)
- (Isn't it way too awkward?)

152
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:23,420
- (To get back home,)
- (To get back home,)

153
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:24,780
- (I'll just do it!)
- (I'll just do it!)

154
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,900
(Where's the scar?)

155
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,100
(No scar?)

156
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:04,060
(Is it under her dress?)

157
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,140
(Flirt.)

158
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:07,380
(If I didn't need to play innocent,)

159
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,300
(I would be unmanning you.)

160
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:12,420
Ouch.

161
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,140
Mercy, Your Highness.

162
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:19,740
I was just trying to bathe you very well.

163
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,580
Take off your dress.

164
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:34,420
What?

165
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:36,340
What?

166
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,980
Don't you get it?

167
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,500
Flirt!

168
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,020
