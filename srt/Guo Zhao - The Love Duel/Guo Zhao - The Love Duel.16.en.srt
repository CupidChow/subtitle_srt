3
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:20,070
Your Highness,

4
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:21,850
I really don't understand what you said.

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,290
But anyway,

6
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,330
for every previous Mid-Autumn Festival,

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:27,350
His Highness always took me to a brothel

8
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:28,590
and celebrated it with the girls there.

9
00:00:30,230 --> 00:00:31,870
Since he married you,

10
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:34,020
he's been steadier

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:35,530
and more family-oriented.

12
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,920
This mooncake tastes great.

13
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,920
Thin crust and full stuffing.

14
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:42,210
Try some.

15
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:45,460
Don't be ashamed, Your Highness.

16
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:48,300
You just did
what every other man would do.

17
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:49,460
It tastes great.

18
00:00:49,460 --> 00:00:50,300
Really great.

19
00:00:53,870 --> 00:00:54,710
Glorious.

20
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,460
It's quite lively over there.

21
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,740
Lian Yue, look.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,540
Shaoheng, Juanjuan, catch up.

23
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,100
Goodbye, Miss.

24
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,140
Your face is too big.

25
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,260
So pretty.

26
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:14,940
I'll pack it for you.

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:22,060
Come have a look.

28
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:23,300
Come this way.

29
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,860
Try it on.

30
00:01:25,020 --> 00:01:25,940

Mr. Lian,

63
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,180
you go protect Zhaoyue.

64
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,300
His Highness and I

65
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,620
will take a walk somewhere else.

66
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,740
Yes.

67
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:15,900
Let's go.

68
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:21,180
Your Grace.

69
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,180
You and I are out here, disguised.

70
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,380
Call me Zhaoyue.

71
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,900
Look.

72
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,380
It looks like you, doesn't it?

73
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,220
It's for you.

74
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,940
Thank you.

75
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:44,860
Zhaoyue.

76
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:59,820
The Mid-Autumn Festival in ancient times

77
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,740
has a really good vibe.

78
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,700
On the Mid-Autumn Festival,

79
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,620
I can't stay with my family

80
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:10,620
and it's really depressing.

81
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,180
I had no idea

82
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:17,540
a workaholic like you
would also be homesick.

83
00:04:21,100 --> 00:04:22,700
I'm from an ordinary family.

84
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,860
I've been working so hard

85
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:28,780
just to get my parents to my city early.

86
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,980
So, I spend the Mid-Autumn Festival

87
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,820
with my family every year.

88
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,100
I miss my parents.

89
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,660
How I wish I could go home!

90
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:06,740
We will go home.

91
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,620
Yes.

92
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,820
We will go back.

93
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
Our families are waiting for us.

94
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:26,180
I have no family.

95
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,380
No one is waiting for me.

96
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,140
Then how about you sacrifice yourself

97
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,940
and let me go back first?

98
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,460
You...

99
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:42,460
Then,

100
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,380
I can wait for you there.

101
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:03,940
Shen Juan,

102
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:06,700
let's go back together.

103
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,180
(The completion of the mission
is a prerequisite for leaving.)

104
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,740
(But usually, there are)

105
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,980
(some special paying ways
to complete a mission.)

106
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:30,460
Mr. Novel?

107
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,260
Mr. Novel!

108
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:34,240
Can I pay by card?

109
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,180
Immediately.

110
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,300
No way.

111
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,300
Pay?

112
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,700
I think we should arrest Zhang San

113
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:49,660
and just beat him up.

114
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:52,020
I have an idea.

115
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:55,380
Come over.

116
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,740
Quickly.

117
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,660
Come on.

118
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,100
Here's the thing.

119
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,140
You

120
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:06,860
go get some fake-death drug.

121
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:07,820
And I will

122
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,100
pretend I'm in love with you.

123
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,460
Then the problems will be solved, huh?

124
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:11,380
No.

125
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:13,140
He can see the favorability value.

126
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,420
What is that?

127
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:17,980
(Shen Juanjuan's favorability value)

128
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,000
(My favorability value has reached 80?)

129
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,460
(Then my favorability for him)

130
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,100
(must be completely exposed.)

131
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:29,700
I'll confiscate this.

132
00:07:29,980 --> 00:07:31,100
This is my privacy.

133
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,180
You must not check it again.

134
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:33,820
I'm afraid

135
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:35,820
you'll have to wear a mask, then.

136
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:36,940
Why?

137
00:07:44,540 --> 00:07:45,420
Because

138
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,290
you're blushing too much.

139
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:51,780
Wait a minute.

140
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:56,020
I warn you.

141
00:07:56,420 --> 00:07:59,100
You must not say
anything so flirtatious again.

142
00:07:59,340 --> 00:08:01,460
Never dream to take me down
and leave alone.

143
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,460
When did I say

144
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,060
I would leave alone?

145
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,620
Come on!

146
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:12,860
Now, neither of us can leave.

147
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:18,420
In this case,

148
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,530
why don't we enjoy the present?

149
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:24,260
You want me to underperform?

150
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:28,740
No way.

151
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,580
In my dictionary,

152
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:32,180
you can never
find the word "underperform"!

153
00:08:35,660 --> 00:08:36,700
Not underperform,

154
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,980
but have appropriate relaxation.

155
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:40,900
You...

156
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,140
You're too tense.

157
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,100
You're a prince.

158
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:56,860
You are a rich and free prince

a lot of money to burn.

162
00:09:07,060 --> 00:09:08,020
Then, we are...
