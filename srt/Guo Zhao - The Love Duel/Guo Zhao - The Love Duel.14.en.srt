3
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:21,000
He just killed seven guards.

4
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,350
Can you live here tonight?

5
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,710
We'll only talk instead of sleeping.

6
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,400
All right.

7
00:00:39,740 --> 00:00:41,540
(Why does it feel so weird?)

8
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:44,060
(Love is nothing, just nothing.)

9
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,140
(What if I'm in love with him?)

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,580
(Then I can't go back to modern times.)

11
00:00:47,690 --> 00:00:48,620
Sleepy?

12
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:49,860
No.

13
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,340
After all these things,

14
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:57,020
you can hardly feel sleepy.

15
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,900
Do you think

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,860
the candles here are strange?

17
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:02,500
Candles?

18
00:01:04,540 --> 00:01:05,380
No.

19
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,020
They are. Give me a second.

20
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,300
Oh, great.

21
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,100
It was too dark just now.

22
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:22,100
Not a good vibe for talking.

23
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,940
You're right.

24
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,580
If some assassins break in,

25
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:27,860
we'll be able to see them.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,260
Yes, yes.

27
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:30,200
That's exactly what I think.

28
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,020
That secondary character
is way too obsessive.

29
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:35,900
Looks like I have to deal with him

30
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,960
through my plan for backup men.

31
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:39,700
Backup men?

32
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,700
Miss Shen, I used to think
you were a workaholic.

33
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,460
Unexpectedly,
you're also good at socializing.

34
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:46,460
How do you have the cheek to say this?

35
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:48,620
If you hadn't always done
cutthroat competitions,

36
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,460
I would have been
the Best Producer last year.

37
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,220
I wanted to explain this the other day.

38
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:54,180
I never meant
to do any cutthroat competition.

39
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:56,580
We also felt several times

40
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:58,700
that your company stole our ideas.

41
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,500
Nonsen... bla, bla, bla...

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,980
Don't try to slander me.

43
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,820
We had such highly similar taste

44
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,100
that we wanted
the same project many times.

45
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,100
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

46
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,500
I've never seen you

47
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:22,500
in so many forums or interviews.

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:24,660
Is it because...

49
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:27,860
Because I care more
about the exposure of works.

50
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:30,940
You think so, too?

51
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,260
That's also what I think.

52
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,460
Really?

53
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,340
Since we misunderstood each other,

54
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,460
let's make it up now.

55
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:51,580
We'll deal with the secondary character

56
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,580
and go home together.

57
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,740
Okay.

58
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,100
There's a secondary female character, too.

59
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,640
Secondary female character?

60
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,140
Prince Heng has a fiancée.

61
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,580
Fiancée?

62
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,260
My engagement with you is over.

63
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,580
You've made up your mind, Your Highness?

64
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,380
Why?

65
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:21,740
Because I'm in love

66
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,300
with her.

67
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,340
(Token)
Dismiss my hatchet men

68
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,550
in gambling houses and restaurants.

69
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,460
And dismiss the servants and maids

70
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:35,300
I don't need.

71
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,890
Give them a year's salary
as compensation.

72
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,860
Yes.

73
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:40,620
Your Highness,

74
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:41,980
what about me?

75
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,140
Serve me until you die.

76
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,500
Don't, Your Highness.

77
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:49,020
- I also want...
- Butler!

78
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,940
How can you not love your job?

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,060
There was a time

80
00:03:53,060 --> 00:03:54,540
when you worked for me,

81
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,220
you didn't even take one single day off!

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:00,020
When was it?

83
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,540
Your next life, I think.

84
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,820
A workplace tyrant, indeed.

85
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,700
I canceled the political marriage

86
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:17,900
and gave up some power.

87
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,780
Nice tricks, aren't they?

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,100
To make everything real,

89
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,460
we still need to do one last thing.

90
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:25,940
What is it?

91
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,580
Stop what you are doing

92
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,980
and look over here.

93
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,190
What?

94
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,620
I'm cultivating a lovestruck persona.

95
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,620
Isn't it great?

96
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:03,300
My kiss

97
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,140
is more realistic.

98
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:11,100

110
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,300
Now, you only have the control

111

of previous assassinations.

00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,180

- teaching Mr. Lian to read the graphs.
- Juanjuan,

127
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:20,060
how did your lips swell up?

128
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,260
I had a kiss...

129
00:06:22,460 --> 00:06:23,420

00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:30,780
Did you have it, too?

133
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,060
Yes.

134
00:06:35,180 --> 00:06:36,300
How?

135
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:37,540
Your Grace,

136
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:40,180
don't ask about their privacy.

00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,100

138
00:06:49,420 --> 00:06:50,260

139
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,220
you must be responsible for Juanjuan.

140

If you still don't marry her after the kiss,

141
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,020
how will people laugh at her?

142
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,580
And if they know about this,

143
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,860
they'll think you're pretending

00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,300

151

Do we really have to do everything?

152
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:34,820
Is it necessary?

153
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:36,100
To make it look real,

154
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,020
just bear it.

155
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:39,940

I'm so exhausted.

170
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,100
Come on. Let's drink.

172
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:52,420
