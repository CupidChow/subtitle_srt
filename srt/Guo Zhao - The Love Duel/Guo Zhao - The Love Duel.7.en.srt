00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
=Episode 7=

3
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:21,480
Rascal!

4
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:26,000
(Oh, no.)

5
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,280
(I'm doomed.)

6
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,710
Your Highness.

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:34,520
It's still early.

8
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
I can't sleep.

9
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,160
What?

10
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:40,430
If you don't like the ground,

11
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,240
we can go back to bed.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:45,630
No need.

13
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:47,030
I suddenly remember

14
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,030
I still have some business to handle.

15
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,720
Another time.

16
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,400
Let's do it another time.

17
00:00:54,790 --> 00:00:55,630
Your Highness,

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,600
as long as you lie in bed,

19
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:58,990
I will

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:00,750
give you

21
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:02,600
a relaxing massage.

22
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,120
Next time.

23
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,680
Do it next time.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:39,150
I just kicked him off the bed.

25
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,710
He could have come back here.

26
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:42,120
Why did he run away?

27
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,590
Juanjuan, did His Highness
beat you these days?

28
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,590
When I couldn't see you,
I was so worried.

29
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,350
He didn't.

30
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:52,430
He's been really nice to me.

31
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:57,480
But lately,

32
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,640
he's making some strange remarks.

33
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,710
Rather disgusting.

34
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,510
Be very careful, then.

35
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,480
Everyone says His Highness
hasn't vented his anger lately

36
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,560
because he is holding back it.

37
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,310
You don't know
when he'll have a temper outburst.

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,520
Well,

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,710
he isn't as horrible as you think he is.

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,590
But it's really creepy

41
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:19,750
to stay with him.

42
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,000
Everyone here says,

43
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,120
you love His Highness but can't get him.

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,960
Non... Nonsense!

45
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:31,920
The food is all yours now.

46
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,360
Lian Yue,

47
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
keep cool.

48
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,800
What I was saying is

49
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,190
it's not that I love Your Highness
but can't get you.

50
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,310
Precisely, I have a huge love
for Your Highness

51
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:55,590
but can't get you.

52
00:02:57,310 --> 00:02:58,150
It's true.

53
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,430
I've figured out
where Miss Shen came from.

54
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,240
Tell me about it.

55
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,190
Miss Shen came from Binjiang.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:16,710
When she was seven, her parents died.

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,120
Her fellow villagers
sold her to the magistrate

58
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,120
as a maid.

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,670
Later, she was sold to the Red House.

60
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,520
Because she was mute,

61
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,520
she could only be a dishwasher.

62
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,190
Then, Your Highness bought her.

63
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:29,750
Her parents are dead?

64
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,280
My father

65
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,710
was a famous physician in the village.

66
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:34,360
A few days ago,

67
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,350
he sent me a new prescription.

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,840
So, I'm cured.

69
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
A while back,
there was a fire in the Red House

70
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,400
and many people died.

71
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,710
Madam Hong, the superior of Miss Shen,

72
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:46,840
disappeared after the fire.

73
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,870
I think Miss Shen

74
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,120
is quite weird.

75
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,630
Go on investigating the Red House.

76
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:55,870
Yes.

77
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:15,910
How many books have been sold?

78
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:20,390
I'm asking you.

79
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:21,240
Why did you kneel?

80
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:22,320
Stand up and answer it.

81
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,000
None.

82
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,430
In such a big imperial city,

83
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:31,510
few people know how good my novel is.

84
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,510
Don't be sad, Your Grace.

85
00:04:34,430 --> 00:04:35,510
Sad?

86
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,270
I'm not sad.

87
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,480
Only the ignorant readers should be sad.

88
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,720
Why on earth does no one buy my novel?

89
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:52,510
Why?

90
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,360
I'll take all those books.

91
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:04,640
All right.

92
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,540
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

93
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,070
Didn't I say

94
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:20,830
you needn't serve me anymore?

95
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:25,360
Your Highness,
I didn't please you last night

96
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,160
and I was really ashamed.

97
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,040
Today, I prepared some pastry

98
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,750
and came to apologize.

99
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:35,800
Guard Lian isn't here?

100
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,510
You care about him?

101
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:40,160
No, no.

102
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,490
Where are you from, Juanjuan?

103
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,480
Why did you suddenly ask this,
Your Highness?

104
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,830
You don't want to tell me.

105
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:51,870
Any sad stores in your hometown?

106
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:55,310
No. It's just a remote place

107
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,580
that isn't worth mentioning.

108
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,600
(He's suspecting me?)

109
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,190
Your Highness, don't beat me.

110
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:03,310
Let's just talk.

111
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:04,400
Don't move.

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,000
A hairpin for you.

113
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:10,910
It's pretty.

114
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:13,040
Don't worry.

115
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,870
I will never hurt you.

116
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:16,760
Are you sure?

117
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:18,070
Yes.

118
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,920
Whatever I do?

119
00:06:23,630 --> 00:06:25,120
Whatever you do.

120
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,830
(Prince Heng will never hurt Juanjuan.)
Today, I'm making a pact with Juanjuan.

121
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,270
Whatever Juanjuan does,

122
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,240
I will never hurt her.

123
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,240
This is a written pledge.

124
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,430
Instead of losing his temper,
His Highness

125
00:06:45,870 --> 00:06:47,270
gave me some money.

126
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:49,160
After all this trouble,

127
00:06:49,310 --> 00:06:50,810
her favorability value is still below zero.

128
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:54,630
Maybe she's not a babe in the woods?

129
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,680
(When I forgot to play innocent,
he started to suspect me.)

130
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,270
(I have to maintain my persona)

131
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,480
(and keep playing innocent.)

132
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,190
However weird she is,

133
00:07:09,870 --> 00:07:13,160
I have to finish the mission quickly

134
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:14,910
and go back home.

135
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,720
(Bookstore)
Sir,

136
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,630
are there any storybooks

137
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:22,600
where the heroine is silly,
weak, and adorable?

138
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:25,950
Silly, weak, and adorable?

139
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,590
I'll take all those books.

140
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,620
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

141
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:33,560
- Yes, there are.
- All right.

142
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,920
Sir, are there any storybooks

143
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,560
where the heroine
is crazy in love with the hero?

144
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,760
Yes.

145
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,190
Check this one.

146
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,190
It's been selling very well lately.

147
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,460
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

148
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,070
Three buyers?

149
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,560
Go get me the three people

150
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,400
who bought my novel.

151
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:54,430
I'm going to meet these confidants.

152
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,780
(Cool Man and Pretty Woman)

153
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,160
(He can't be noticing)

154
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:04,720
(that I'm learning to play innocent, huh?)

155
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,510
(She has feelings for me, indeed.)

156
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,950
(To talk with me,)

157
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,120
(she's trying to know my every move.)

158
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,390
What are you guys doing there?

159
00:08:14,390 --> 00:08:15,360
Come over.

160
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:18,870
After you, Your Highness.

161
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,830
So, you're the author, Your Grace.

162
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:23,920
Yes. Let me sign your book.

163
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,040
In such a great case, be more active.

164
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,630
By Miss Gorgeous?

165
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,240
Keep it carefully.

166
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:42,720
When I get famous someday,

167
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
you keep it in your room.

168
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:45,750
It will bless you.

169
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,200
Thank you, Your Grace.

170
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:50,270
I'll treasure it.

171
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,510
Oh,

172
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:53,150
I hear you're now serving

173
00:08:53,150 --> 00:08:54,510
as my brother's personal maid.

174
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,000
I thought

175
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,840
you were a snobbish girl.

176
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,440
Unexpectedly, you have a very good taste.

177
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:02,240
You're pretty and honey-tongued, too.

178
00:09:02,790 --> 00:09:03,840
That's for sure.

179
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,240
My girl

180
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:09,030
is always the best.

181
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:13,630
I just didn't know

182
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,440
you also read such love stories.

183
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:20,840
Yes.

184
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,480
Because I'm lonely.

185
00:09:25,270 --> 00:09:28,000
What about you, Your Highness?

186
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,080
What a coincidence!

187
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:31,960
Because

188
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,560
I'm lonely, too.

189
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,240
This is terrific.
