3
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,480
With these evidential letters,

4
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,070
your dirty deals will finally be exposed.

5
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,120
Xingchen,

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:27,440
this world isn't as simple
as you think it is.

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,600
You and I could have
done something great together.

8
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,600
Shut up. We're different.

9
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,110
Xingchen,

10
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,280
you didn't see this coming, huh?

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:44,790
Put the key

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,670
into the lock under the potted orchid.

13
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,200
Spin right

14
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,040
and that's it.

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:52,390
Orchid?

16
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,070
You're smarter.

17
00:00:55,070 --> 00:00:56,670
You wouldn't figure out the signal

18
00:00:56,670 --> 00:00:58,880
of the shifted orchid.

19
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,240
This is the day

20
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:10,070
you're going to die.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,520
Kill her.

22
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:28,350
It's brilliant of you,
Your Royal Highness.

23
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:31,040
You predicted that
they would assassinate you.

24
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:33,310
Princess Consort Heng,

25
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,150
you and Shaoheng both came.

26
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:37,950
A sweet couple, indeed.

27
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,150
Shen Juan.

28
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,430
Didn't I ask you not to come alone?

29
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,400
You really have double standards.

30
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,240
Let's finish this quickly.

31
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:22,400
Be very careful.

32
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:31,000
Indeed the great assassin I picked.

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:32,430
In this case,

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,870
I should kill you personally.

35
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,030
Madam Hong,

36
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:37,310
if you kill me,

37
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,870
you won't be detoxicated, either.

38
00:02:39,310 --> 00:02:41,800
An assassin is destined to die.

39
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,590
If you and I can die together,

40
00:02:43,590 --> 00:02:44,960
it's kind of our fate.

41
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,920
Juanjuan.

42
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,710
Your Royal Highness...

43
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,150
You...

44
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,520
What do you want?

45
00:03:57,800 --> 00:03:58,800
What do you think?

46
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:00,710
You!

47
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:02,520
The son of my father's second wife!

48
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:04,520
How dare you do this!

49
00:04:05,470 --> 00:04:06,430
All this time,

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,870
you called me the Crown Prince

51
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:10,710
but surpassed me in all respects!

52
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,400
I did everything

53
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:16,600
just to get back

54
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,510
what I was supposed to have!

55
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,830
Don't you know a villain usually
loses his life in his long speech?

56
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:27,760
You...

57
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,430
You don't dare to kill me.

58
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,600
I'm your lineal brother.

59
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:33,830
If Father knows this,

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,510
you'll be doomed.

61
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:38,360
And you.

62
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,120
You'll be dead, too.

63
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:43,310
He knew it a long time ago.

64
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,000
Royal edict from King Changle.

65
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,070
The Crown Prince fought for power
and killed innocent people.

66
00:04:58,390 --> 00:04:59,310
King Changle ordered

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,710
the Crown Prince's mansion
be closed down

68
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,000
and the Crown Prince be detained

69
00:05:02,390 --> 00:05:03,310
for later execution.

70
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:04,760
I don't believe this.

71
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,070
I just don't.

72
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:09,030
You don't believe it?

73
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:14,720
Lian Yue gathered evidence

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,250
of what you had done.

75
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,190
Today, we came here

76
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:20,480
just in case you escaped upon hearing it.

77
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,440
Take him away.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:24,840
Yes.

79
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:37,350
It's all over.

80
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:39,240
Then the evidence I gathered

81
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,360
won't be needed anymore, huh?

82
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,760
It's still needed.

83
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,270
It can lure out more bugs.

84
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,390
What is wrong with you?

85
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:47,560
You didn't tell me about your plan.

86
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:48,870
What do you think I am?

87
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
A strong woman.

88
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:53,600
But I still wanted to protect you.

89
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:54,800
So,

90
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,000
I had to keep it from you.

91
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,000
Fine, you're honey-tongued.

92
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,880
Let's go home.

93
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,190
Then whish, whish...

94
00:06:10,430 --> 00:06:12,070
I knocked them down.

95
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,310
Mighty move, Your Highness.

96
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,480
A toast to you.

97
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:22,270
Well, Your Highness,

98
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:23,950
you were brave, too.

99
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:25,620
I used to think

100
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,700
you were a coward.

101
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:30,220
Unexpectedly, you fought bravely.

102
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:31,900
To Your Highness.

103
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:41,620
Why do you not drink?

104
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:44,980
Why does a man like you

105
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:46,140
drink so slowly?

106
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,580
