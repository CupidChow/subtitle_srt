3
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:24,800
Be careful, Mr. Lian.

4
00:00:25,390 --> 00:00:26,710
Sorry, Butler.

5
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,070
What is this for?

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,120
Good news.

7
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,030
Her Grace

8
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:32,560
will get a husband.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,680
Get a husband?

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,840
Right tonight.

11
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:37,840
It will be lively.

12
00:00:37,880 --> 00:00:38,720
She asked me to...

13
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,960
You're so rude.

14
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:43,990
Your Highness,

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:45,400
would you like some watermelon?

16
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,680
Where's he?

17
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,790
He can't be mad at me, can he?

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,790
Why is there another piece?

19
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:58,710
(Shen Juanjuan's favorability value)

20
00:00:58,710 --> 00:00:59,600
(Will I)

21
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,350
(not be taken down)

22
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:02,840
(until I'm utterly in love with him?)

23
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,930
(Deliberately snub her with emotional abuse.
Always keep her guessing what I think.)

24
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:16,140
(Play dumb and unthoughtful.)
(In case)

25
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,620
(he completes the mission first,)

26
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:18,980
(he left me here all alone,)

27
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,220
(so that I would hate him.)

28
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:23,140
(The legendary master)

29
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,700
(of score control?)

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:27,500
(Silly man.)

31
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:29,460
(This morning, I mocked him,)

32
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:30,740
(but he still cares for me.)

33
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:33,260
(Oh, no. I have to go find him.)

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,940
Chen Shen.

35
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:53,660
I've thought things through.

36
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,980
Actually,

37
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:56,940
I fell in love with you a long time ago.

38
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,860
I did that earlier.

39
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,900
So sweet

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,570
under the tree.

41
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,140
Your Grace.

42
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:38,820
What are you doing here?

43
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:41,220
If you insist on getting a husband,

44
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,620
I want you to think carefully.

45
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,860
Most men in this world

46
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:50,660
have malicious intentions

47
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,100
and they're rather sly.

48
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,580
You...

49
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,900
You're young

50
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:01,220
and innocent.

51
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:04,780
You can't tell who is good or bad.

52
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:08,380
It's none of your business.

53
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:09,900
Zhaoyue,

54
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,460
if you insist on getting a husband,

55
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,020
hope you can have His and Her Highnesses

56
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:20,420
pick one for you.

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,940
I really don't want you

58
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:26,340
to meet those strangers.

59
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,340
You've finally thought it through?

60
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:34,620
Will you confess your love to me, then?

61
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:43,300
What do you mean?

62
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,220
Your Grace, if you say you like me,

63
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:47,500
what do you like about me?

64
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,340
I like it

65
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:54,140
when you have great martial arts.

66
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,260
I like it

67
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:59,940
when you're in black.

68
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,420
And a heroic man like you

69
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,340
can always protect all of us.

70
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,060
Your Grace, isn't your love

71
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,540
too childish?

72
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,500
To be honest,

73
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,580
the moment I met you

74
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:18,500
was the happiest moment of my life.

75
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,100
But sadly,

76
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,420
you're a flower in the sun

77
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,780
while I'm a mere weed.

78
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,860
What I want

79
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,500
is the man I like

80
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:40,220
to like me back.

81
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:44,260
Lian Yue, tell me.

82
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:46,300
Do you like me?

83
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:48,980
Yes.

84
00:04:51,220 --> 00:04:52,260
Very much.

85
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,220
Then,

86
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:10,090
we confessed love to each other.

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:15,740
What a sweet love it is!

88
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:18,580
I have to thank you, Juanjuan,

89
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,900
for your pursuing plan.

90
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:22,420
You flatter me.

91
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:23,780
I'm not very experienced, actually.

92
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,820
Just a little trick.

93
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,340
Juanjuan.

94
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,980
What would you like to do today, Juanjuan?

95
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,620
Anything.

96
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,100
Juanjuan,

97
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,940
shall we go out to the street tomorrow?

98
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:37,780
All right.

99
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,550
Whatever you say, Your Highness.

100
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,980
How can you say
you're not very experienced, Juanjuan?

101
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,190
Since we'll settle down in this place,

102
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,570
I want...

103
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,540
You want to work.

104
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,100
You really know me.

105
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,780
Miss Shen, whatever you want to do,

106
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,820
I'll support you.

107
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:58,540
I'll build my business empire

108
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,780
in this day and age!

109
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,600
Xiliu,

110
00:06:08,620 --> 00:06:10,260
I'm glad you have a gift

111
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,220
for writing scripts.

112
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,500
But the dialogue should be pretty clear.

113
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,740
If the audience can't even understand,

114
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,260
what kind of a scriptwriter can you be?

115
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,500
Butler, how many times have I told you?

116
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:19,940
Before the play is released,

117
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,220
you must keep it very secret.

118
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:22,820
When you spoil the play,

119
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,100
what can the audience expect?

120
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,100
- Got it.
- All right.

121
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,740
Didn't we have a deal

122
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,490
that you wouldn't
lose your temper at work?

123
00:06:33,310 --> 00:06:34,190
I'm sorry.

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,620
I failed to keep my temper again.

125
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:38,020
Please keep supervising me.

126
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,980
If I lose my temper again,

127
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:41,940
say something to remind me, all right?

128
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:43,260
- All right.
- I get it.

129
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,080
Every time you're busy with work,

130
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,260
you don't even rest.

131
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,060
What?

132
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,380
Think I'm snubbing you?

133
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,660
Well, I won't work tonight, then.

134
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,700
I'll spend the night with you.

135
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,620
Juanjuan.

136
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,420
Juanjuan.

137
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,700
Juanjuan!

138
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,820
How's she?

139
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:35,700
Don't blame me, Your Highness.

140
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,780
I've been a physician for decades

141
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,700
but have never seen this illness before.

142
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,740
I really can't do anything.

143
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:51,940
Butler,

144
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,380
go get all the physicians in town.

145
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,980
Your Highness,

146
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,580
all the physicians in town

147
00:07:57,580 --> 00:07:59,420
have come and checked on Her Highness.

148
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,980
This is the last one.

149
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:05,500
