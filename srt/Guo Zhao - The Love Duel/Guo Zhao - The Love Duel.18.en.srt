Where's Shen Juanjuan?

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:21,670
You'd better worry about yourself.

5
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,120
Where's she?

6
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,830
Go ask the Death Lord.

7
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,190
Kill him!

8
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,200
Xingchen and Yueyin
have boarded the ferryboat.

9
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,280
It's not too late to catch up now.

10
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,320
I just don't think you can.

11
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,670
However much you love her,

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:53,240
you can only see her in your next life.

13
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,240
Go back and tell your master

14
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:04,590
not to hurt my girl again.

15
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,880
Get lost.

16
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,690
Why is it you?

17
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:23,590
Sorry.

18
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:25,190
I'm sorry.

19
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,280
I didn't...

20
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,280
I didn't mean to stab you.

21
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,590
Don't die.

22
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:41,750
Please don't die.

23
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:44,310
Xingchen...

24
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,130
Xingchen...

25
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,750
Where has she gone?

26
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:51,150
Give my girl

27
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,560
back to me.

28
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:56,000
My girl...

29
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,870
Don't be scared.

30
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,590
I will always protect you.

31
00:03:06,150 --> 00:03:07,560
I'm sorry.

32
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:09,630
I didn't mean this.

33
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,710
Somebody!

34

Your Grace,

78
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:55,480
you don't need to speak for me.

79
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:58,230
You...

80
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,630

81
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:06,790
Your Grace,

you and I belong in different worlds.

00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:14,310
I'm a mere guard.

84
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,480
And you are noble.

85
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:19,190
Don't forget who you are, Your Grace.

86
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,000
My problem

87
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,750
isn't any of your concern.

88
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:26,560
If you want to kneel, kneel.

89
00:06:27,870 --> 00:06:29,070
For three days and nights.

90
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,080
Get up.

91
00:06:58,190 --> 00:06:59,070
It wasn't your fault.

92
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,120
You don't need to kneel.

93
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,040
Her Grace asked me to kneel.

94
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,600
I can't disobey her.

95
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,390
Zhaoyue is just naughty.

96
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:07,230
Don't take it seriously.

97
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:08,560
Her Grace ordered me.

98
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,510
I can't disobey her.

99
00:07:09,510 --> 00:07:10,630
I order you to get up!

100
00:07:16,630 --> 00:07:18,160
You and Zhaoyue love each other.

101
00:07:18,950 --> 00:07:20,920
Why can't you be together?

102
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,470
I'm...

103
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,800
I'm not good enough for Her Grace.

104
00:07:27,070 --> 00:07:28,720
If you worry about the status thing,

105
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,630
you don't need to.

106
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:31,190
You're steady and calm.

107
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:32,800
In due time, you will be great.

108
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:34,390
I will help you, too.

109
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:38,030
Your Highness,

110
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:43,160
if Her Grace marries me,

111
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,430
people will gossip about her.

112
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,760
Instead of me,

113
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:53,190
she deserves someone better.

114
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,070
Even if you can't be with her,

115
00:07:58,430 --> 00:07:59,630
you'll still protect her?

116
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,680
Yes, all my life.

117
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,040
What if someday,

118
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:09,000
you need to die for her?

119
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,950
I won't hesitate.
