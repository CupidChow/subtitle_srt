00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:17,020
=Episode 1=

3
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:22,870
(She is a lonely poor maid)

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,830
(who has always been humiliated.)

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,710
(Her life is short,)

6
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,280
(but she remains kind-hearted.)

7
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,430
(He is a cruel prince)

8
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,110
(who keeps killing.)

9
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,240
(The shackles of fate)

10
00:00:42,240 --> 00:00:43,790
(bring them across each other's paths.)

11
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,600
(The entanglement
between love and desire)

12
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,560
(keeps them together.)

13
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,420
Cut!

14
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,260
(Burning Love)

15
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,560
Shen Juanjuan?

16
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,350
I really couldn't
come up with another name.

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:08,280
When you use my name,

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,840
you should have at least

19
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,230
modeled this kind of persona.

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,430
But you always model the same persona.

21
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:24,920
I'm so fed up with it.

22
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:27,310
Audiences love dramatic conflicts.

23
00:01:27,310 --> 00:01:28,230
Miss Shen,

24
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,840
how about you put up with it

25
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:30,790
and read a little bit more?

26
00:01:30,790 --> 00:01:32,400
The later chapters are great.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,430
Great?

28
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:35,310
Burning Love,

29
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:38,350
a 33-day love epic with a violent prince.

30
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:40,350
You're quite familiar
with Stockholm syndrome.

31
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:42,040
(Burning Love)
Do the audiences really love this?

32
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,760
This kind of novel,

33
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:45,840
I won't accept it even if it's free.

34
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,710
But Mr. Chen of Abyss Pictures

35
00:01:47,710 --> 00:01:49,840
has gone to the summit to buy it.

36
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,870
Who?

37
00:01:50,870 --> 00:01:53,040
Mr. Chen of Abyss Pictures.

38
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,000
Where are you going, Miss Shen?

39
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,310
(It's Chen Shen again.)

40
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,790
(He always snatches my project.)

41
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:06,310
(A red alert for rainstorm
from the weather bureau.)

42
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:07,480
(This heavy rainstorm)

43
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,750
(is expected to last till the next morning.)

44
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:11,750
(Citizens, please stay vigilant)

45
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:13,190
(and do not go out.)

46
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,860
(Burning Love)

47
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,780
(Such an elastic airbag.)

48
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,400
(Wait.)

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:53,700
(Oh, no.)

50
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,960
Assassin!

51
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,000
Zhao?

52
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,280
Kill her.

53
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:30,920
Zhao.

54
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:32,960
What the heck are you doing?

55
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:45,710
(What is going on here?)

56
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:49,870
(This isn't true.)

57
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,150
(It's just a dream.)

58
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:53,280
(It can't be true.)

59
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:01,870
Shen Juan,

60
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:05,710
I'm Mr. Novel, the plot administrator.

61
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,240
You traveled from modern days

62
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:09,150
into Burning Love

63
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,280
as Shen Juanjuan, the maid.

64
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,400
Unless you kill the prince

65
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:15,430
as written in the novel,

66
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:17,310
you can't return to modern times.

67
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,310
But as soon as you arrived,
you gave yourself away

68
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:22,830
and they executed you.

69
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:25,630
From now on, you no longer exist

70
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,830
in either modern times or ancient times.

71
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:39,160
It freaked me out.

72
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,430
What a nightmare!

73
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,360
Shen Juan,

74
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,560
you failed your mission

75
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,950
and your life will be erased.

76
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,830
I'm sending you to your reincarnation.

77
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:51,160
You can think

78
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,920
about what you want to be
in your next life,

79
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:54,270
a human or an animal.

80
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,640
Who are you?

81
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:59,600
- I am...
- Wait.

82
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,160
What mission

83
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,510
did you just talk about?

84
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,390
To kill Prince Heng.

85
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,920
You're the White Ghost?
[*The envoy taking the dead to the underworld]

86
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,760
Don't point at me.

87
00:05:11,630 --> 00:05:12,750
That's just superstition.

88
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,120
You can call me Mr. Novel

89
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,360
or Zhang San.

90
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,680
But I didn't even receive

91
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:20,640
the mission you just mentioned
and how could I complete it?

92
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,480
That's impossible.

93
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,310
Yesterday, I issued...

94
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,160
Oh, sorry. I forgot to issue it.

95
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,360
But sadly,

96
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,720
you're here now.

97
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,120
Everyone has his fate.

98
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,270
Just give in to it.

99
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,830
I never give in to fate.

100
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:42,480
Even if I get stuck in a novel,

101
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,750
I should be a champion of work

102
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,040
or a superstar.

103
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,950
But what did you make me?

104
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:47,830
Maid?

105
00:05:47,830 --> 00:05:48,830
Babe in the woods?

106
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:49,920
Hopeless romantic?

107
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,390
Totally wrong personas.

108
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,830
When you assign missions,

109
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:54,630
don't you ever consider the match thing?

110
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:55,680
Do I have to?

111
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,190
Send me back
to modern times immediately.

112
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,040
Don't you know
producers like me are busy?

113
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,720
No way.
You haven't done your mission yet.

114
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:04,240
Then send me back to do the mission.

115
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,600
Kill a violent prince, huh?

116
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,360
To fight violence with violence
is what I do best.

117
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,200
Still no way.

118
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,750
There's no precedent here.

119
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,190
To be honest,

120
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:14,950
the assassination mission for you

121
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:17,190
can be a rather difficult one.

122
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,390
Actually, it's not bad to be an animal.

123
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,040
In my vocabulary,

124
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,510
you'll never find "no way".

125
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:28,240
I, Shen Juan,

126
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,680
have to do my best

127
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,680
even in time travel.

128
00:06:41,070 --> 00:06:42,430
(I must hold out
and not give myself away.)

129
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,720
(Without a dagger,
I won't be decapitated.)

130
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:58,840
Your...

131
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,950
(Why is there another dagger?)

132
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:04,600
(Is this woman a dagger seller?)

133
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,510
Assassin!

134
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,360
Wait a minute.

135
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,240
I'm not an assassin.

136
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,040
Then who are you?

137
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,430
I...

138
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,000
I am...

139
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,360
I am Shen Juanjuan,

140
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,310
the maid.

141
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,560
Liar!

142
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,480
Shen Juanjuan is a mute.

143
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,950
(I should have finished the novel.)

144
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,480
(Oh, no, such a big bug.)

145
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,240
Let me dispute... Oh, no. Let me explain.

146
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:32,310
You deliberately pretended to be a mute.

147
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:34,430
You must be an assassin!

148
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,710
Get her out of here!

149
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,640
- Yes.
- Wait.

150
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,310
How come

151
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,830
a mute like you can talk?

152
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:47,950
I...

153
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:55,870
Something was wrong with my throat,

154
00:07:55,870 --> 00:07:57,560
so I couldn't talk before.

155
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,920
But it's fine.

156
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,430
I was taking some decoction these days.

157
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:03,720
And surprisingly, I'm cured.

158
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,270
Is there really

159
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,000
such magic decoction?

160
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
Yes. My father

161
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,950
was a famous physician in the village.

162
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:15,600
A few days ago,
he sent me a new prescription.

163
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,040
So, I'm cured.

164
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,160
Then this...

165
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,190
How are you going to explain this?

166
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:22,600
(How do I know?)

167
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:24,240
Don't try to deny it.

168
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,950
Your Highness,
I keep it for self-protection.

169
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:28,680
I never knew it would fall out

170
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,800
and scare you, Your Highness.

171
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,750
I'm so guilty.

172
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,150
For self-protection?

173
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,910
Do you find it dangerous
to stay by my side?

174
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,670
Or

175
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:49,790
are you exactly the danger around me?

176
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:51,910
(According to what I read,)

177
00:08:51,910 --> 00:08:53,510
(this prince
is supposed to kiss this girl.)

178
00:08:54,030 --> 00:08:56,320
(He's probably interested in her.)

179
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,590
(He just likes Shen Juanjuan)

180
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,960
(for her innocence and silliness.)

181
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,360
If that's what you think,

182
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,030
I'll have nothing else to say.

183
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,510
If you don't believe me,

184
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,720
kill me, then.

185
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,790
(If it goes on like this,
I'll be giving myself away.)

186
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:28,790
(I should fake a faint now.)

187
00:09:38,530 --> 00:09:39,370
Take her away.

188
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
What do I have to do

189
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,550
