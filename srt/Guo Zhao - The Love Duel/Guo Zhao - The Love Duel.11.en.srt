3
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:29,800
I swear to have good meals all my life.

4
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:32,520
I wish I would never be moved by men.

00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:35,420
(No Love. Always loveless, always young.
Always single, always longevous.)

00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,880
This is the best seller.

(36 Tricks to Reject Love)
Reading it will keep you away from love trouble.

8
00:00:41,030 --> 00:00:43,520
(Never dream to go home
by sacrificing me.)

9
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,670
Do I need to wear one more?

10
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:53,550
Your Highness,

11
00:00:53,790 --> 00:00:55,960
one soft vast can make you invulnerable.

12
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:57,430
You don't need to wear more.

13
00:00:58,520 --> 00:00:59,360
No way.

14
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:01,150
There are many more ways

15
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:02,200
to hurt me.

16
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,280
Well, layer by layer,

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,680
have my sleeping chamber wrapped.

18
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:07,910
Yes.

19
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,310
(Never dream to kill me and go home.)

20
00:01:45,310 --> 00:01:46,510
(I'll keep away from her)

21
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,350
(before I come up with a new plan.)

22
00:01:49,820 --> 00:01:50,990
(Before I finish reading this book,)

23
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,590
(I should be in less contact with him.)

24
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,120
Your Highness,

25
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:17,460
what's going on
between you and Miss Juanjuan?

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,620
Romance.

27
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,940
But it's been days.

28
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,740
(It's no solution for me to avoid her.)

29
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:38,060
Wait.

30
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,140
Let's talk.

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,460
About what?

32
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,900
About going back home,

33
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,060
do you have any idea?

34
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:48,940
You do?

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,130
No.

36
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,460
Then don't ask.

37
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:53,900
Since the rules are set,

38
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:55,900
it's pointless to avoid.

39
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,060
What do you mean?

40
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:06,460
Let's make peace.

41
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,900
Let's ignore our missions

42
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,580
and try to find some other solutions.

43
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,860
Like you said,

44
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,700
the rules are set.

45
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:12,980
What other solutions can we have?

46
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,940
Since we're stuck in a novel,

47
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,500
there must be some logical stories

48
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:18,700
and contradictions.

49
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:20,900
So, as long as we get
to the root of the problem,

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,300
we will find a way to go back home.

51
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:24,780
You sound like a counterpart.

52
00:03:24,860 --> 00:03:26,780
You can't also be a producer, can you?

53
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,940
I'm Chen Shen, the producer.

54
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,500
Who are you?

55
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,060
Chen Shen, S-H-E-N.

56
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,900
But Mr. Chen of Abyss Pictures

57
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:37,940
has gone to the summit to buy it.

58
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,660
What the heck!

59
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:44,580
What are you doing?

60
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,980
Chen Shen,

61
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:48,220
here we are, at last.

62
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:49,260
I...

63
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,580
You wanted the intellectual property
I wanted!

64
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,660
You poached the director I reserved!

65
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:58,340
- What are you doing?
- Now, I'm stuck in the novel.

66
00:03:58,540 --> 00:03:59,860
You're stuck in it, too.

67
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:02,220
- Why are you so angry?
- Whatever I did,

68
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,300
you did it as well.

69
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,660
Wait, you...

70
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:06,020
You plagiarized my project.

71
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Black sheep of our industry!

72
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,860
Thief! Terrible man!

73
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,900
Wait.

74
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,780
What did you just touch?

75
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:20,700
I'll fight it out with you!

76
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,780
Miss Juanjuan, you...

77
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,220
Can't you see I'm making out with him?

78
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,860
- Go out!
- Yes.

79
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,860
Come on.

80
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:37,300
Let go of me first.

81
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,980
Why is there such a ruckus?

82
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:40,420
Is my brother quarreling with Juanjuan?

83
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,190
Shh.

84
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:45,700
Your Grace,
it's the romance between adults.

85
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,520
I don't think His Highness
will come out

86
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,780
until the day after tomorrow.

87
00:04:50,180 --> 00:04:51,020
Why?

88
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,500
Miss Juanjuan

89
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,340
is quite skilled with the romance thing.

90
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,180
Really?

91
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,860
His Highness looked at her adoringly.

92
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:05,140
Juanjuan,

93
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,380
I have something to ask you.

94
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,300
Come with me.

95
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,980
Come on.

96
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,620
This really stuns me.

97
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:30,220
Miss Juanjuan can be so rude.

98
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,740
She is always

99
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,860
a sharp girl.

100
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:37,900
Sharp?

101
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,740
As sharp as needles.

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:44,300
I heard a lot about her.

103
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:46,300
I just didn't meet her in that world.

104
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,460
In this world,

105
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:50,580
we were destined to meet.

106
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,300
That world?

107
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,580
Oh, I see.

108
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,460
You like...

109
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,860
Not me. A friend of mine.

110
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:03,700
I get it.

111
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:06,140
Your friend is from an honorable family.

112
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:07,460
She likes the armed guard

113
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,220
of her own brother.

114
00:06:09,220 --> 00:06:11,140
Not knowing how to attract him,

115
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,580
she asked you for advice.

116
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,420
That's right.

117
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,740
But Your Grace, you're an expert

118
00:06:16,740 --> 00:06:17,940
in writing romantic novels.

119
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:18,820
And you don't know what to do?

120
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:23,020
I know, of course.

121
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,740
Well, I just want to consult you.

122
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,420
In this mansion, after all,

123
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:30,660
you're one of the smartest guys.

124
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,060
You've got a good eye, Your Grace.

125
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,780
First of all, this guard

126
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,540
does martial arts all the time.

127
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,660
He must be interested

128
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,700
in unconstrained girls.

129
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,100
So, your friend...

130
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,340
She needs

131
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,500
to be open-minded.

132
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,460
She should be

133
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,060
wayward and uninhibited.

134
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:56,060
Then, she'll be able
to attract that guard.

135
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,580
I get it.

136
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,580
Your Grace,

137
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:07,580
your face... Are you sick?

138
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,340
No.

139
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,620
Don't deny it.

140
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,140
You're blushing.

141
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:13,380
You must be having a fever.

142
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,600
And you're wearing so little.

143
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:16,140
I'll go get you a physician.

144
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,700
I'm not sick.

145
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:19,980
See?

146
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,100
It's not hot, huh?

147
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:31,780
Your Grace,

148
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,460
eh... it's...

149
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,700
It's hot.

150
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,300
Let me go get you a physician.

151
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,340
Stop right there.

152
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:48,580
Is he caring about me?

153
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:57,780
What are you doing here?

154
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,460
I think

155
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,180
we should talk.

156
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,580
I have nothing to say to you.

157
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:03,860
There must be a misunderstanding.

158
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:04,940
Stop.

159
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,380
Don't try to seduce me anymore.

160
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,740
- I...
- Juanjuan.

161
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,820
Biguang Wine, the rarest wine in town.

162
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:12,860
What do you mean?

163
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:15,140
You love drinking, don't you?

164
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,660
I quit drinking.

165
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,060
Juanjuan,

166
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,220
the most famous pastry in town.

167
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,820
You wanted macarons, didn't you?

168
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,140
Try some of this.

169
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:24,500
I quit everything.

170
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,220
This is, at best, a reasonable reward

171
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:41,740
for my job as your maid.

172
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,980
And a penalty for your vicious rivalry.

173
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:44,940
Shen Juan,

174
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:47,140
I really didn't mean
to do the same project.

175
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:48,740
You snatched my project, fine.

176
00:08:48,900 --> 00:08:50,300
But you even poached my employees.

177
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,060
Many of them.

178
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,260
Now, even Zhao...

179
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:55,900
And Tuanzi.

180
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,460
They work for you now.

181
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,540
Oh, come on.

182
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
I just won't argue with you.

183
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,500
Let's wait and see.

184
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:08,780
See whether you make me love you first

185
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,020
or I kill you first.

186
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:12,780
I really have something to tell you.

187
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,420
Stay alert when you eat or sleep.

188
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,860
And you'd better not walk in the night.

189
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:31,020
Is there more?

190
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:37,980
