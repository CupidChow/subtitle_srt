=Episode 17=

3
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,920
You are a rich and free prince

4
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,320
who isn't in danger.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:26,030
You have

6
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:27,390
a lot of money to burn.

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,480
Then, we are...

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,840
Financially free.

9
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:36,600
I don't want these three.

10
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:38,430
Pack all the other items for me.

11
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:43,710
All the dishes, please.

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,790
- Everybody should protect the environment.
- Thank you.

13
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:54,860
- The more you pick, the more you'll get.
- Thank you.

14
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,110
You should be well-behaved

15
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:58,030
and polite beggars.

16
00:00:58,030 --> 00:00:58,870
Here.

17
00:00:58,920 --> 00:00:59,790
Your Highness!

18
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,200
Check mine!

19
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:02,990
The stationery handed down
from my ancestors.

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:04,590
- Your Highness.
- Don't crowd me.

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,310
My gold toad only sells for eight taels.

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:09,190
Come on.

23
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,150
Buy mine.

24
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:13,310
Her Highness is over there.

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:14,680
There she is.

26
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:15,990
Buy mine.

27
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:25,020
(Chunhe House)

28
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,560
Honey,
you really don't save me any money.

29
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,560
Because you're generous, my husband.

30
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:33,870
Honey,

31
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,230
you'll be famous in town again.

32
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:49,920
Good boy.

33
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:54,760
Chunhe House?

34
00:01:58,510 --> 00:01:59,350
I'll get in and have a look.

35
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
If you get in there,

36
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:03,280
I won't give you the gold.

37
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:06,120
Good boy. You go back home first.

38
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,440
I'll be back later.

39
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:10,750
Dear lady,
is it the first time you come here?

40
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:12,080
- Lead the way.
- Come in, please.

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:15,150
Sorry, but this place

42
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:17,000
is only available for pretty ladies.

43
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,870
I told you to go back first.

44
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,710
What are you doing?

45
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:25,750
You can go anywhere

46
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,120
except this place.

47
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,360
Why?

48
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:29,560
Because you're using my money.

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,590
Put me down!

50
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,470
Zhaoyue,

51
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,910
what else would you like to buy?

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,420
Nothing else.

53
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:42,800
I'm out of money.

54
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:44,190
Let's go find Shaoheng.

55
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,520
Out of money?

56
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,870
I still have some.

57
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,870
Take it.

58
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:57,430
You...

59
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,840
Why are you being so nice to me?

60
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,840
- Eat it.
- I won't.

61
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,360
What's wrong?

62
00:03:41,870 --> 00:03:42,710
Angry?

63
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,840
I want to visit Chunhe House.

64
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,640
- You can't.
- Why can't I?

65
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,400
If you want some music,
I can learn to play.

66
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:49,280
I don't want to listen to your music.

67
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:51,150
Juanjuan.

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,560
This is my new novel,
the Legend of A Heroine.

69
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:58,800
Have a look.

70
00:03:59,080 --> 00:03:59,920
All right.

71
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,120
You...

72
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,000
You two...

73
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,750
Keep your voice down.

74
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:23,000
Why do the two of you look weird?

75
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,360
Did you...

76
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:30,560
Oh, you kissed.

77
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,560
No.

78
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,030
Your Highness,

79
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,870
the hatchet men you dismissed

80
00:04:39,310 --> 00:04:40,680
are moving around outside the town.

81
00:04:40,690 --> 00:04:42,390
Please send me
to take care of them, Your Highness.

82
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:42,840
No way.

83
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,300
If you go, what about me?

84
00:04:45,020 --> 00:04:46,340
What about my brother?

85
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,700
Your Highness,

86
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,580
please send me there.

87
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,180
Whatever you want.

88
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,300
Yes.

89
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:56,300
I want to visit Chunhe House.

90
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,620
Zhaoyue is doing great.

91
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:13,900
She even arranged mysteries in her novel.

92
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:14,980
Xingchen.

93
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,420
Yue... Yueyin.

94
00:05:18,420 --> 00:05:19,980
What are you doing here?

95
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:20,820
I'm here to take you away.

96
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,140
Wait a minute, Yueyin.

97
00:05:27,740 --> 00:05:28,860
We're pressed for time.

98
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,220
We have to rush to the wharf immediately.

99
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,420
Let go of me.

100
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,940
You hurt me a little bit.

101
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,260
I hate this kind of backup love.

102
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,460
What did you say?

103
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:39,180
Nothing.

104
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,820
How about you go alone?

105
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:42,740
You don't want to go with me?

106
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,140
You're a nice guy.

107
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:48,580
But we aren't destined to be together.

108
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,740
Oh, I know.

109
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,970
Prince Heng

110
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,780
must have forced you with poison.

111
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,660
I'm going to kill him.

112
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:55,900
Wait.

113
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:56,900
Take it easy.

114
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,620
You're in love with him?

115
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,180
Not really.

116
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:03,540
Yueyin,

117
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,340
you've been fighting around

118
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,860
and got so many scars.

119
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:08,660
I really feel sorry for you.

120
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,380
Lian Yue and Prince Heng

121
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,780
both have better martial arts than us.

122
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,420
If you take me away,

123
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,580
they will take revenge.

124
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:16,380
I don't want you
to risk your life anymore.

125
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:18,460
You should go alone.

126
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,500
Go.

127
00:06:28,260 --> 00:06:30,420
How dare you bite me, girl?

128
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,340
I'll knock your teeth out!

129
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,140
Get up!

130
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,220
Stop!

131
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,180
Dismiss.

132
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:43,780
- Yes.
- Yes.

133
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,380
Eat it.

134
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:16,620
Don't be scared.
I'll always protect you.

135
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,740
Do you have a name?

136
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,300
Yueyin for the moon

137
00:07:22,540 --> 00:07:23,740
and Xingchen for the stars.

138
00:07:24,220 --> 00:07:25,060
I'm Yueyin.

139
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:27,420
You will be Xingchen.

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:32,660
Tell me. Who are you?

141
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,020
You don't even remember this scar.

142
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:36,620
I'm... I'm Yueyin.

143
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,500
No. I'm Xingchen.

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,380
You have really
great transfiguration kills.

145
00:07:40,700 --> 00:07:41,780
If you hadn't given yourself away,

146
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,820
I would almost be taken in.

147
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:43,940
Where's Xingchen?

148
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,060
Yueyin,

149
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,220
I don't know what you're saying.

150
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:54,660
How come?

151
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,460
You killed Xingchen

152
00:07:58,900 --> 00:07:59,900
and possessed her body!

153
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,660
Possessed her body?

154
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:04,100
You really overestimate me.

155
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,660
So, it's true.

156
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:08,420
Give Xingchen back to me!

157
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:09,340
Watch this!

158
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:10,820
Why is it so hard to learn?

159
00:08:21,420 --> 00:08:22,260
Shen Juan.

160
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:41,620
Where's Shen Juanjuan?

161
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,100
All your guards have been killed.

162
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,060
And Lian Yue is out of town.

163
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,940
You'd better worry about yourself.

164
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:51,300
You witch,

165
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:52,220
get her back!

166
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,300
Yueyin for the moon

167
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,140
and Xingchen for the stars.

168
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,700
The Moon and Star Blade.

169
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,500
Xingchen,

170
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,540
you're back.

171
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,140
Madam Hong is right.

172
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,780
You really don't want to kill her.

173
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:17,900
I'll do it, then.
