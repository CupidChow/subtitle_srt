=Episode 3=

3
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:24,190
Juanjuan.

4
00:00:27,350 --> 00:00:29,070
Why did you get up so late?

5
00:00:31,550 --> 00:00:32,840
When you came here working,
I told you...

6
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:34,220
(Why does she stick around
even in a novel?)

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:35,640
...to stay away from His Highness.

8
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:36,480
Even the slightest lapse

9
00:00:36,490 --> 00:00:37,560
may get you killed, you know?

10
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:39,320
(But why do she and Zhao not know me?)

11
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,350
By the way,

12
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:45,520
my cousin is a mute, too.

13
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:47,600
Could you please
give me the prescription?

14
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,440
No.

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,520
It's not that
I don't want to give it to you.

16
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,030
But that is

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:00,470
a secret prescription of my family.

18
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:01,880
Without my father's permission,

19
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:03,070
I can't give it to anyone.

20
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:08,200
I know you're a kind girl

21
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:09,510
and you will help me.

22
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,070
I should go, then.

23
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,760
What's the smell?

24
00:01:27,150 --> 00:01:29,070
(I have to kill that terrible prince soon)

25
00:01:29,510 --> 00:01:30,350
(and go back home.)

26
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:40,710
(Stab him to death.)

27
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:43,790
(But it's rather risky.)

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,400
(With a secret weapon,)

29
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:47,790
(I can kill him without being noticed.)

30
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:49,590
(But it can't satisfy me enough.)

31
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,510
(With an axe,)

32
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,400
(I can do counter-violence.)

33
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,400
(But that won't be dramatic enough.)

34
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,840
(Yes, that's it.)

35
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:02,150
(Cut his throat with the dagger.)

36
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,350
(Smooth and quick.)

37
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,430
(Good enough for me.)

38
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,800
Sleeping on the wooden bed for days

39
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,280
gives me neck stiffness.

40
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:15,870
No way.

41
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,680
I can't stay here anymore.

42
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,190
Juanjuan.

43
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,630
Juanjuan,

44
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:26,150
it's your lucky day.

45
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,280
Princess Zhaoyue has come.

46
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,560
His Highness will have a banquet for her.

47
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,960
You go wait on them.

48
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,680
(Here's my chance.)

49
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,400
Try to get close to His Highness.

50
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,000
When you get wealthy,

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,080
don't forget me.

52
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,000
Whatever you say, Butler!

53
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,840
Go!

54
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,800
Whatever you say, Butler.

55
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,680
Let's go.

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,960
Mm.

57
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,080
(Such heaven-sent luck.)

58
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:52,680
(Here's my chance.)

59
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:20,870
(When I hand him the wine,)

60
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,870
(I can assassinate him perfectly.)

61
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:27,120
Shaoheng,

62
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,630
the dance is quite old.

63
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:31,400
At my birthday party tomorrow,

64
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,520
I don't want this kind of dance.

65
00:03:34,030 --> 00:03:34,870
Leave us.

66
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:39,120
Somebody,

67
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,000
serve the drink to His Highness.

68
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:55,870
Your Highness,

69
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:59,470
let me serve you wine.

70
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:08,750
Zhang San, send me back home!

71
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:13,430
Haw-haw!

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,800
There you go.

73
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

74
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,190
Leave it to me.

75
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,950
(What the heck!)

76
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,480
(My great chance!)

77
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:34,470
Your Highness,

78
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,040
I ruined your fun just now.

79
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,510
Let me fill your cup

80
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,870
and apologize to you.

81
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:00,590
Take her away.

82
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,950
- Yes.
- Yes.

83
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,160
Shaoheng,

84
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,390
it's the 22nd time of this month

85
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,360
that you've been assassinated.

86
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,800
And your guard

87
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,560
pulled out his sword much faster.

88
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,920
She must have some accomplices here.

89
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:22,190
I get it, Your Highness.

90
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:23,430
(I nearly died.)

91
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,430
(I need to rethink
my assassination plan.)

92
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,870
(I just need to.)

93
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,160
(Don't be scared. It's fake.)

94
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,160
(It's all fake.)

95
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,800
Mr. Novel, are you there?

96
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,240
Darn it. He's slacking again.

97
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,430
Hey, Zhang San!

98
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:44,600
Oh, my God.

99
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,870
Someone died again.

100
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:47,750
Let's save up some money and run away.

101
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,680
That's right. I should run away.

102
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,720
I can't kiss her

103
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,000
without a special occasion

104
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
or event, huh?

105
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,120
The moon is gorgeous tonight.

106
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,920
So are you.

107
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,000
I order you

108
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,080
to kiss me.

109
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,440
No, no, no.

110
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,160
It's way too awkward.

111
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
I can't do it.

112
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,800
Your Highness.

113
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,030
Come in.

114
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,190
Your Highness,

115
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:50,310
today is Princess Zhaoyue's birthday.

116
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:52,800
Will you see the visitors
in the front hall?

117
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,120
Can...

118
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,750
Can I not go?

119
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,720
Your Highness,

120
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,430
no one in this world

121
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:03,430
can force you to do anything!

122
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,800
Your Highness.

123
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,480
Get up, will you?

124
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,880
Oh,

125
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:10,950
go prepare

126
00:07:10,950 --> 00:07:12,720
some jewels that girls are fond of.

127
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,120
And...

128
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,510
And some clothes.

129
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:16,390
But Your Highness,

130
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,040
you've prepared them for Her Grace.

131
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,240
They're not for her.

132
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,040
Your Highness,

133
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:27,160
I didn't mean to misunderstand you.

134
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,190
Your Highness.

135
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,040
You get up first.

136
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:30,480
Don't always kneel like that.

137
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,870
Your Highness,

138
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:33,310
please promise me

139
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:35,040
you won't be so courteous to me anymore.

140
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,430
Or I wouldn't get up.

141
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:42,270
At tonight's banquet,

142
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:44,630
make sure Shen Juanjuan will wait on us.

143
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:46,160
Yes.

144
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,470
Get lost.

145
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:51,480
Yes.

146
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,830
What are you looking for, Juanjuan?

147
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:00,360
Some money for escape.

148
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,120
You were sold to His Highness

149
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,390
and you're still in debt out there.

150
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,630
What money do you have?

151
00:08:06,950 --> 00:08:08,120
Not even a single penny?

152
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:08,960
No.

153
00:08:09,510 --> 00:08:11,510
Oh, that won't do.

154
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:15,750
A maid without money is like quicksand.

155
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,920
When the wind blows,

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,510
it'll be gone.

157
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,920
Miss Shen,

158
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,750
another lucky day for you.

159
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,270
(That's what I'm worried about.)

160
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,630
Your Grace,
your gold hairpin looks great.

161
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:46,670
Oh, this.

162
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,320
My birthday present from my brother.

163
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:52,030
Oh, have you read the novel

164
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,670
Cool Man and Pretty Woman?

165
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,960
It's awful.

166
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,840
I read a little and then stopped.

167
00:08:58,550 --> 00:08:59,630
I suggest that the author

168
00:08:59,630 --> 00:09:00,960
should stop writing.

169
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,390
No one will buy this book.

170
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:05,110
Let's go.

171
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:06,550
Poor taste.

172
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:20,790
(I should lure away Lian Yue,
the disruptor.)

173
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,320
You,

174
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,160
come with me.

175
00:09:26,180 --> 00:09:27,040
Your Grace,

176
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:28,480
I can't stay away from His Highness.

177
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,550
You can't stay away from me either.

178
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,630
(This princess is quite helpful.)

179
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,150
