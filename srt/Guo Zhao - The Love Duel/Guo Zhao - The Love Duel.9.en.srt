=Episode 9=

3
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,440
(Oh, no.)

4
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:28,510
(What is going on here?)

5
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:29,710
(Where am I?)

6
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:32,750
For betraying the organization,

7
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,520
you'll be executed now.

8
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:36,790
Organization?

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:38,470
Executed?

10
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,520
Looks like I'm one of the assassins.

11
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,720
Stop.

12
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:44,870
I didn't betray you.

13
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:48,540
Instead, the organization's cover
was blown.

14
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,880
Don't try to deny it.

15
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:52,200
During the assassination the other day,

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,430
you protected Prince Heng
with your own body.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,390
Did you or did you not?

18
00:00:57,520 --> 00:00:59,110
Danger, Your Highness!

19
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:08,150
That was

20
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,230
Prince Heng's scheme.

21
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:11,560
Using himself as bait,

22
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,150
he wanted to lure you out.

23
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,480
When I hindered the assassination,

24
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,200
I not only defended our men

25
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,560
but also dispelled his doubts about me.

26
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:21,350
Protected our men?

27
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:24,840
Quite a few assassins were killed

28
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:26,280
and our master was really unhappy.

29
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,560
You have to pay with your life.

30
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,320
Kill her.

31
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,480
Don't!

32
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,480
(I can do martial arts?)

33
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:39,200
(Muscle memory?)

34
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,920
You can do much better martial arts now.

35
00:02:00,070 --> 00:02:00,910
Madam,

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,920
I'm more eager
to kill Prince Heng than you.

37
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,480
But we both know

38
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:06,120
that without me,

39
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
our organization couldn't survive.

40
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,000
I have a good plan

41
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,870
to kill Prince Heng in one stroke.

42
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:14,280
Give me a second chance, please.

43
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:44,840
Juanjuan,

44
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,120
what are you doing?

45
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:47,590
Exercising.

46
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:50,400
What is wrong with you?

47
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:52,870
Xiliu,

48
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,240
remember.

49
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,590
I've changed!

50
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:58,280
From now on,
I'll curse whoever I want to curse

51
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,870
and beat whoever I want to beat.

52
00:02:59,870 --> 00:03:01,520
No one can bully me ever again.

53
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:02,750
In this mansion,

54
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,360
I take you under my wing.

55
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:13,000
(Let me clean up this street.)

56
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,750
Yes!

57
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:20,840
Hey, pretty.

58
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,800
Mercy, heroine! Mercy!

59
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,960
Tell me. Where are the other villains?

60
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,030
Confess!

61
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,030
I'll tell you. I will.

62
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:43,900
(Ouch!)

63
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,240
Fight bad guys

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,080
and help the weak.

65
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:51,630
Such great martial arts

66
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,310
make me feel so cool.

67
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,190
Have you heard?

68
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,680
A mighty heroine came to town yesterday,

69
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,000
helping the weak

70
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,240
and hitting the bad guys hard.

71
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,740
This morning,
outside the government office,

72
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,080
a number of villains were waiting
to turn themselves in.

73
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:08,310
That was rather a spectacle.

74
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,000
Eradicate all the evil people

75
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,630
and keep the world peaceful.

76
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:15,590
She's really a heroine.

77
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,760
Your Highness,

78
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,270
she beat up our men.

79
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:25,000
They deserve that.

80
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:27,040
The Double Seventh Festival will come
the day after tomorrow.

81
00:04:27,050 --> 00:04:28,480
Because of them, many girls

82
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,390
didn't dare to go out for fun.

83
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,270
Now, they don't need to worry.

84
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,270
By then, I'll go out for fun, too.

85
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,430
- (That's a new chance for me.)
- (That's a new chance for me.)

86
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,360
Where has His Highness gone?

87
00:05:01,070 --> 00:05:04,190
Why are you so close to me,
Your Highness?

88
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:06,480
Are you available
for the Double Seventh Festival?

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,720
Yes, yes.

90
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:10,920
I'm your maid, Your Highness.

91
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,480
When you need me,

92
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:14,680
I'll always be available.

93
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,390
It's a big festival, after all.

94
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,160
I want to spend it with you, Juanjuan.

95
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:23,120
That's exactly what I'm thinking.

96
00:05:23,310 --> 00:05:25,830
But the lantern show
must be crowded and noisy.

97
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:28,120
I fear some more assassins

98
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,510
may appear and hurt you.

99
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,750
Also, I prefer to stay with you alone

100
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:36,270
and listen to you talk.

101
00:05:37,630 --> 00:05:38,470
Alone?

102
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:43,000
I have a manor.

103
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,040
It's quite suitable.

104
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,120
Whatever you say, Your Highness.

105
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,480
I'll take my leave now.

106
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,240
Get some rest early.

107
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,680
I will.

108
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,870
You really hold your liquor,
Your Highness.

109
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,830
However much you want to drink,

110
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,270
I will drink with you.

111
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:13,510
I'm flattered, Your Highness.

112
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:15,480
Out of my mansion,

113
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,040
don't keep saying "Your Highness".

114
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,680
We came here

115
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,190
just to have a good talk, didn't we?

116
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:22,440
Your Highness,

117
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,870
you're really handsome.

118
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,120
Working in your mansion

119
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,830
is really worth it.

120
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,630
If you like my face,

121
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:40,830
look at it more.

122
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
I don't think I can.

123
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,040
(Weird.)

124
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,430
(Why am I feeling depressed?)

125
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,350
What's wrong?

126
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:03,240
Is anything bothering you?

127
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:07,630
Your Highness,

128
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,360
why do you think
there are so many accidents?

129
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:15,070
There are coincidental mistakes, too.

130
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,240
There are a lot of things
that we want to do

131
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,750
but fail to do.

132
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,920
Stuck in the mess,

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,510
we can't do anything,
however hard we try.

134
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:27,160
Yeah.

135
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:30,070
No one can tell what life will be like.

136
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:32,310
But we have to face it, don't we?

137
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,320
How about this?

138
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,750
From this day on,

139
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,680
I'll set you free.

140
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,160
Stay in my mansion and be my girl.

141
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:41,910
What do you say?

142
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:43,830
Come on.

143
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,040
I'm not worried about my identity.

144
00:07:51,870 --> 00:07:53,510
What are you worried about, then?

145
00:07:54,290 --> 00:07:55,130
Tell me about it.

146
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,480
About...

147
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:00,950
Well,

148
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:03,360
you won't understand anyway.

149
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,560
Juanjuan,

150
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:10,630
whatever you want to do,

151
00:08:10,630 --> 00:08:11,920
just do it bravely.

152
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,880
You'll always have me.

153
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
(I didn't expect him)

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,070
(to be so gentle.)

155
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,390
(No, no, no.)

156
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:29,870
(I have to kill him quickly.)

157
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,750
(I can't have dirty thoughts.)

158
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,920
Your Highness,

159
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,270
I think you're drunk.

160
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:44,000
How about I go get you
some hangover cure from the kitchen?

161
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:01,270
This is my good plan,
mirabilite, sulfur, and charcoal.

162
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:06,110
Farewell,

163
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:07,480
