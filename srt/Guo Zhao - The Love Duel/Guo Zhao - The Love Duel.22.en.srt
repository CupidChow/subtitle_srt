3
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,120
How about I...

4
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:31,550
I...

5
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:41,030
Let me feel Her Highness's pulse.

6
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:47,030
She isn't sick,

7
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:49,640
but is being punished
for abandoning her mission.

8
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,070
Being punished?

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:56,520
Shen Juan's favorability value isn't full,

10
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,790
but it is still going up.

11
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:01,240
So, your mission is still available.

12
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,790
But she totally gave up on killing you.

13
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:06,950
She's certainly being punished.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,710
In the following days,

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:09,840
she'll get weaker and weaker

16
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:12,150
until she dies.

17
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:15,840
It's so important

18
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,430
and why are you just bringing it up now?

19
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,070
You didn't ask me.

20
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,200
And because the two of you
forcibly changed

21
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,310
the future of the Crown Prince,

22
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,760
this world

23
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:25,560
will collapse soon, too.

24
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:41,790
Shaoheng,

25
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,920
I'm here to see Juanjuan.

26
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:49,940
Did the physicians say what was wrong?

27
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:53,990
She's fine.

28
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,760
She's just exhausted

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,390
and she'll be all right
after a few days' rest.

30
00:01:58,400 --> 00:01:59,240
Glad to hear that.

31
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:02,820
Shaoheng,

32
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,460
I'm going to visit the Southside

33
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,540
to get some inspiration for my new novel.

34
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,860
With Lian Yue?

35
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,700
Yes.

36
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,860
Juanjuan said,

37
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,780
a woman should also have a career.

38
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:19,420
Only when she's independent

39
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,380
can she always attract her husband.

40
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,540
You're awake.

41
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:53,900
What is wrong with me?

42
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,720
According to the physicians,

43
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,500
you were so tired of working
that you fainted.

44
00:02:58,060 --> 00:02:59,420
You must not work so hard anymore.

45
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:03,340
I'm not that weak.

46
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:06,260
It's stuffy here.

47
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,220
I want to take a walk out there.

48
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:09,420
You can't.

49
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:15,660
It's windy out there.

50
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:20,180
You think the wind will blow me away?

51
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:29,420
Then grab my hand tightly.

52
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:37,460
All right.

53
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,180
I'll go out with you.

54
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,500
What are you thinking?

55
00:03:57,620 --> 00:03:58,900
This is where

56
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,860
I met you for the first time.

57
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,060
Comet

58
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,420
and the warped space-time.

59
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,940
I didn't really predict this story.

60
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:14,420
I used to be very angry.

61
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:17,780
But now...

62
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,820
I'm grateful for this experience.

63
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,460
Yeah.

64
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:27,300
Otherwise,

65
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:29,380
I wouldn't have met you.

66
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:35,580
Shen Juan,

67
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:38,660
thank you.

68
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,460
Thank you for making me brave.

69
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,580
What?

70
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,740
We have a long life to live.

71
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,710
You must not give up halfway.

72
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:52,660
I won't.

73
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:56,700
It's snowing.

74
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,260
It's snowing.

75
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,180
Chen Shen,

76
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:07,700
look.

77
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,900
What a heavy snow!

78
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:28,220
It's too cold.

79
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:29,940
Let's get back.

80
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,700
But

81
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:34,340
it was just the Mid-Autumn Day.

82
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,820
How come it is snowing?

83
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,660
Chen Shen,

84
00:05:38,780 --> 00:05:39,840
let's go play in the snow.

85
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:44,780
Okay.

86
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,260
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

87
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,460
Thank you.

88
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,500
- Take it.
- Thank you.

you set Lian Yue free

00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,300
and sent him to protect Zhaoyue?

133
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:34,900
Instead of keeping him working,
distracted,

134
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,140
I would rather

135
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,500
make him do what he wants.

00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,980
I persuaded him, of course.

139
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,740
How?

140
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,900

hope you can let go of the status thing

146
