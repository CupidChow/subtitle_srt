3
00:00:18,190 --> 00:00:19,030
What a coincidence!

4
00:00:19,870 --> 00:00:20,710
Because

5
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:22,000
I'm lonely, too.

6
00:00:26,830 --> 00:00:28,320
This is terrific.

7
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,920
How about the two of you make a pair

8
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,750
and go shopping with me tomorrow?

9
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,710
Your Highness, do we have to hold hands?

10
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:57,310
What?

11
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:58,880
You don't want it?

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:00,280
That's not true.

13
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:01,710
I don't dare.

14
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,200
There's a cold drink stall over there.

15
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:06,040
Let me buy you a cold drink.

16
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:08,510
No, thanks. I'm not thirsty.

17
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,130
Shh.

18
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,840
To me,

19
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:15,510
you don't need to be courteous.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:19,760
Well, I'm indeed a little bit thirsty.

21
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,430
I knew it.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,710
Turn around.

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:39,590
The cool man held her hand

24
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:42,400
and pressed his finger to her lips.

25
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,150
Details.

26
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,150
Don't follow them so closely.

27
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,200
Or they'd feel awkward.

28
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:53,120
Then I can't get to know

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,400
how a man and a woman date.

30
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,040
If you ruin this,

31
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,680
you'll have to date me.

32
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,070
I'm far inferior to you, Your Grace.

33
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:04,760
Don't be kidding.

34
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,940
Lanterns.

35
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:17,090
Kites.

36
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,630
Where have they gone?

37
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,840
Why are they gone so soon?

38
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,260
Kites for sale.

39
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:39,400
Juanjuan,

40
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:41,520
I heard you had been doing laundry work

41
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,150
since you came to my mansion.

42
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,870
I feel sorry for that.

43
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:46,750
But it doesn't matter.

44
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:48,120
From this day on,

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,080
you will never suffer again.

46
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:52,960
(He seems to have
some true feelings for Juanjuan.)

47
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,910
(But what should I say?)

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,960
(How come she isn't moved at all?)

49
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:06,000
Looks like you still don't believe me.

50
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:10,240
If I'm lying,

51
00:03:10,870 --> 00:03:11,910
let me...

52
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:14,200
No blood oath.

53
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,640
Or it'd come true.

54
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:20,840
Come on.

55
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:23,590
Your Highness,
don't always scare me like that.

56
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,590
I'm so scared.

57
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,190
Juanjuan, your coquetry

58
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,400
looks charming, too.

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,000
I love it.

60
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:33,960
You make me shy.

61
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,030
How could you flirt with me
when we're out here?

62
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,560
I won't talk to you.

63
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:42,630
"Every time I smile,
I want you to be around."

64
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:44,430
Juanjuan.

65
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:50,870
Your Highness,

66
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,630
I guess I ate something bad

67
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,030
and now I'm throwing up.

68
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,150
Because of the cold drink, I guess.

69
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,120
I feel sick, too.

70
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,240
It's not me.

71
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:22,480
It's really not me.

72
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,800
Assassins!

73
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:48,960
(Oh, no.)

74
00:04:49,310 --> 00:04:50,360
(If he dies,)

75
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,000
(I can't complete my mission.)

76
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,600
(Then do I have to...)

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,040

82
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,240
Your Highness,

83
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,770
you have to stay alive.

Kill them all!

90
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,000
Yes.

91
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:13,600
Xiliu,

92
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:14,710
where's His Highness?

93
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,600
Juanjuan, you're finally awake.

94
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,160
Tell me. Is His Highness dead?

95
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:21,270
How come?

96
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,510
If he were dead,

97
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,870
how could I still be here?

98
00:06:27,070 --> 00:06:28,480
His Highness is alive,

99
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,950
with extreme longevity.

100
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,920
If His Highness isn't dead,

101
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:33,950
why are you so sad?

102
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,480
Just because he isn't dead, I...

103
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,270
Anyway,
His Highness really cares about you.

104
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:43,160
He not only kept you company
for a long time

105
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:45,270
but also asked me
to make you some decoction.

106
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:49,360
(I didn't know)

107
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:51,600
(this terrible prince
could also be thoughtful.)

108
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:55,270
Go. Let's go check that out.

109
00:06:58,630 --> 00:07:01,240
I guess she actually loves me.

110
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:05,240
Lian Yue,
stop the investigation on Juanjuan.

111
00:07:05,430 --> 00:07:07,160
But she is rather suspicious.

112
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:09,560
She just loves me

113
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,240
and she did all those things to attract me.

114
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,750
If she were a real assassin,

115
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,480
why did she protect me from the stabbing?

116
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:20,750
(Looks like that accident)

117
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:23,360
(has let down their guard.)

118
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:29,040
Your Highness, are you all right?

119
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,560
Lian Yue,

120
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,510
it hurts so much.

121
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:39,270
Get out now.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,800
But Your Highness,
you only have some minor bruises.

123
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:43,000
Get out now.

124
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,950
Hurry.

125
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:52,560
Your Highness,

126
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:53,750
are you all right?

127
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:13,000
Your Highness, how are you?

128
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,840
I'm fine.

129
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,520
Juanjuan,

130
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:17,030
what about you?

131
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
How's your injury?

132
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,270
It was my honor to protect you,
Your Highness.

133
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:23,800
I just didn't know

134
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,480
you could do such great martial arts.

135
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,630
(Zhang San didn't tell me
about his martial arts.)

136
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,720
I'm glad you're fine.

137
00:08:32,960 --> 00:08:34,790
(I also didn't know I could do that.)

138
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:40,480
My shoulder hurts, but I can bear it.

139
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,390
Let me do it myself.

140
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,510
Let me do it.

141
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,000
- Leave it to me.
- Leave it to me.

142
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,120
- Juanjuan.
- Your Highness.

143
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:50,080
Thank you for taking care of me today.

144
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,320
You must be kidding.

145
00:08:52,670 --> 00:08:54,670
You even risked your life to save me.

146
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,440
What I did is nothing.

147
00:09:09,790 --> 00:09:10,960
Funny enough,

148
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:13,720
a few days ago, I suspected you

149
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,390
of colluding with the assassins.

150
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,080
It was rather ridiculous.

151
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:19,840
How could it be?

152
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,960
There can't be so many assassins.

153
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:24,670
I'm tired.

154
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,150
Your Highness, get some rest early.

155
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:26,990
See you.

00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,840
