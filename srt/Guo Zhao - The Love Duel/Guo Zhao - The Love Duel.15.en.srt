2
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:16,940
=Episode 15=

3
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:19,710
Why isn't it working?

4
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:21,600
Is it the wrong position?

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,960
This is the right position.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,440
Do it harder.

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,600
Is it all right?

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:28,960
- Is it out?
- No.

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,070
It can't come out.

10
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,520
- Try another position.
- One, two, three.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,430
What? Is it out?

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:38,760
Yes.

13
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:40,430
I even spit the bile out.

14
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,320
Feeling much better, huh?

15
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:45,670
The poison is Secret Fragrance.

16
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:47,790
It has a faint fragrance

17
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:49,750
that people usually can't smell.

18
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:52,110
It gives the victim

19
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,320
immense pain.

20
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:55,590
How do you know?

21
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:56,870
I guessed.

22
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,120
Really?

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,110
Well, to poison you,

24
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:03,150
I learned that, okay?

25
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:04,430
If I didn't know so much,

26
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:05,710
you would have died.

27
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:09,480
Come on.

28
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:12,950
Take the elixir

29
00:01:12,950 --> 00:01:14,200
Yueyin gave me.

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,240
You'll be safer.

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:16,870
He gave it to you

32
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,710
and you kept it to your skin?

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,120
You quite enjoy his love, huh?

34
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:26,920
Never do this again.

35
00:01:28,150 --> 00:01:29,150
I can't hear anything.

36
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,480
Hush. Stay quiet.

37
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:33,870
It's not me.

38
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:43,790
What?

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,590
Under such circumstances,

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:51,430
how about we do what they want us to do?

41
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,510
You're a girl.

42
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:55,510
Behave.

43
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,240
Chickening out?

44
00:01:57,950 --> 00:01:58,840
Me?

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:06,350
Wait a minute.

46
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,680
How about another day?
I'm so hungry now.

47
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,560
This is amazing.

48
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:24,870
You can cook so well.

49
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,680
It must be great to be your girlfriend.

50
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:32,560
Don't tell me

51
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,560
you've never had a girlfriend.

52
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:37,590
That's impossible.

53
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:38,870
Hey, this is boring.

54
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,240
We've gone through so much

55
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:42,030
and you can't even be honest with me?

56
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,870
It's true.

57
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,240
When I was little,

58
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,470
my father eloped with another woman.

59
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,750
My mother remained depressed

60
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:54,800
and never smiled again.

61
00:02:56,470 --> 00:02:57,360
Since then,

62
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,120
bonding with someone

63
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:01,960
has been a very difficult thing

64
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,120
for me.

65
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,200
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:08,750
But...

67
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,750
Their broken marriage

68
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:12,590
doesn't mean you can't
have a good relationship, right?

69
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,560
I never thought

70
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,750
Chen Shen, who always remained calm,

71
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,910
turned out to be a coward.

72
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:22,240
I envy you, actually.

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,120
You're never scared.

74
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,400
I was.

75
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:27,470
When Yueyin broke in,

76
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,960
I was so scared.

77
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:31,710
He won't come again tonight, will he?

78
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,310
Wedding room?

79
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,590
Dear Yueyin,

80
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:57,560
how are you?

81
00:03:57,630 --> 00:03:59,000
I'm dealing with Prince Heng

82
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,190
and the wedding is just a guise.

83
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:01,400
Don't worry about me.

84
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,030
It's dangerous here. You must leave soon.

85
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:06,120
(Xingchen really cares for me.)

86
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,960
Juanjuan.

87
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,040
I guess Yueyin has been lured away

88
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,880
by your plan.

89
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,950
I don't think he'll come again.

90
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,040
Then let's get back to the room.

91
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,180
- (Do we have to share a bed?)
- (Do we have to share a bed?)

92
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,230
How about...

93
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,070
How about we stay outside?

94
00:04:35,270 --> 00:04:37,070
- All right. Let's...
- Let's take a walk.

95
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:38,200
In the middle of the night?

96
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,430
We're young.

97
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,270
Let's rock and roll.

98
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,160
Come on.

99
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,880
Your Highness.

100
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,430
Your Highness, last night...

101
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,950
I didn't sleep at all.

102
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,560
You're really strong, Your Highness.

103
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:00,040
Last night, you...

104
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,870
I'm so exhausted.

105
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:05,800
I didn't sleep the whole night.

106
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:07,690
That's good.

107
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:10,120
I thought His Highness
couldn't do anything

108
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,070
after a fierce sex life.

109
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:12,350
It's not...

110
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,510
I... Forget it.

111
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:15,360
I understand.

112
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,360
I'll go get you the best tonic

113
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:19,750
so that you can have babies soon.

114
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:23,390
It's not about him.

115
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,040
It's about someone else.

116
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,680
Someone else?

117
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:30,480
You're right.

118
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,390
Maybe His Highness
really can't do anything.

119
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,590
I'm such a pretty woman.

120
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:35,920
But last night,

121
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,870
he didn't do anything.

122
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,600
Juanjuan,

123
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,360
don't let His Highness know

124
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,120
about your affair with someone else.

125
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,310
Did you hear?

126
00:05:48,270 --> 00:05:49,800
Look, Prince Heng and his wife.

127
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
They make a perfect couple.

128
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,620
I hear Her Highness is even more fierce.

129
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,510
At the wedding, she yelled
about the wedding night thing.

130
00:05:54,510 --> 00:05:55,480
Rather fierce.

131
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,430
Well, thanks to Her Highness,

132
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:59,830
Prince Heng now cares
about his people and family.

133
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,950
He's straightening up.

134
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:03,910
Look.

135
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,390
Your tyrannies

136
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,750
have finally been whitewashed.

137
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:10,310
I'm afraid the Crown Prince
wants to kill me more.

138
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,320
It's okay.

139
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,350
Since he's invidious,

140
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,560
he can't be so good.

141
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,920
Let's stick to our plan

142
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,750
and we will survive.

143
00:06:20,830 --> 00:06:23,120
Greetings, Your Royal Highness.

144
00:06:24,630 --> 00:06:25,680
You took many days off, Shaoheng.

145
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:28,120
Shouldn't you get back down to business?

146
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:34,270
I have

147
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,310
found the woman
I want to spend my life with.

148
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,680
Now, all I want is
to travel around with her

149
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,680
instead of being disturbed
by anything else.

150
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:41,870
You may rise, Shaoheng.

151
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,600
Are you saying

152
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:46,920
you'll resign?

153
00:06:49,190 --> 00:06:50,030
Exactly.

154
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,080
But...

155
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,520
Shaoheng,

156
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,030
you promised

157
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
you would travel around with me

158
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,720
to enjoy all the scenery.

159
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:00,640
Juanjuan,

160
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,040
I will keep my word.

161
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,600
This is really enviable.

162
00:07:05,950 --> 00:07:07,390
Shaoheng, I wonder

163
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:08,680
how you fell in love.

164
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:10,130
- At first sight.
- Love grew in time.

165
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,070
- Love grew in time.
- At first sight.

166
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:17,240
We fell in love at first sight

167
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,190
and then love grew in time.

168
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,040
Since you insist, Shaoheng,

169
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:26,270
I won't make you work.

170
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,950
Do what you want, then.

171
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,640
Thank you, Your Royal Highness.

172
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:39,750
That was close.

173
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:41,040
Glad you were so smart.

174
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,910
Keep your distance.

175
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,080
So vigilant.

176
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,700
You fear you may fall in love with me?

177
00:07:48,270 --> 00:07:49,720
And I'll leave you here all alone?

178
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:51,630
Funny. I won't be scared.

179
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:53,710
Oh, no.

180
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
I'm not in love with you.

181
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,000
Do you think
the Crown Prince believed us?

182
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:07,040
Whether he believes us or not,

183
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:08,610
he will be watching for a few days.

184
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,510
Then we won't be in danger lately,
will we?

185
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:13,030
No.

186
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,440
Tomorrow, I can finally
celebrate the festival without worry.

187
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:19,510
It freaked me out.

188
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,350
Wait for me.

189
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,630
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

190
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,870
Hot liquid.

191
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,590
Your Grace, you can't be
drinking for the first time, huh?

192
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,120
No.

193
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,080
I'm a heavy drinker.

194
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,110
Mr. Lian,

195
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,510
let me ask you some questions.

196
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:42,960
Where do you come from?

197
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,250
How many people are there in your family?

198
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,200
Are you engaged?

199
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,580
For your information, Your Highness,

200
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,790
I come from Hangzhou.

201
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:55,120
When I was little,
my parents died of illness.

202
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,270
His Highness took me in.

203
00:08:58,030 --> 00:08:58,870
I'm not engaged.

204
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,680
Sorry.

205
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,720
I didn't mean
to bring up your sad memory.

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,030
I'll drink and apologize.

207
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,990
It doesn't matter, actually.

208
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,670
It's been a really long time.

209
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,240
I've forgotten a lot

210
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,440
and I'm not as sad as before.

211
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,560
Lian Yue,

212
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:25,120
you and I went through really a lot.

213
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,480
We're best buddies, then.

214
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,320
Every year from now on,

215
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,360
we'll get together like this

216
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:30,630
to celebrate the Mid-Autumn Festival.

217
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:32,480
Yes. Let's get hyper together.

218
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,550
- Come on.
- Come on.

219
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,440
Hyper?

220
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:39,120
Your Highness,

221
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,870
I really don't understand what you said.

222
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:42,260
But anyway,

223
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:44,220
for every previous Mid-Autumn Festival,

224
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,260
His Highness always took me to a brothel

225
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,540
and celebrated it with the girls there.

226
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,540
Since he married you,

227
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,500
he's been steadier

228
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,160
and more family-oriented.
