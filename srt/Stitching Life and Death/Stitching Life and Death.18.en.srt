=Episode 18=

3
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,200
Anything else to add?

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,329
No.

5
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:19,440
All right.

6
00:00:25,613 --> 00:00:26,879
Here.

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,179
What's the meaning of this?

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:29,880
Verify what you said
with your thumbprint.

9
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,349
Now, you're just like me, an accomplice.

10
00:00:34,835 --> 00:00:35,680
But...

11
00:00:36,064 --> 00:00:37,649
He didn't know about it.

12
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:41,559
That makes it a lighter offense.
But you? You attempted murder!

13
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:43,200
I've turned over a new leaf!

14
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:48,880
And I'm happy for you.

15
00:00:49,068 --> 00:00:52,430
If you really want to change your ways
and testify against them,

16
00:00:52,580 --> 00:00:54,759
I will do everything I can

17
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,680
to help you both win this case

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,310
and get a reduced sentence.

19
00:01:01,213 --> 00:01:02,150
Stamp it.

20
00:01:04,057 --> 00:01:05,040
Wait.

21
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,016
Who did you ask for?

22
00:01:07,017 --> 00:01:07,787
Tong.

23
00:01:07,788 --> 00:01:08,739
Tong?

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:09,960
She's my girl!

25
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,089
We agreed to have our own ladies!

26
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:13,689
How could you go after my girl?

27
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:15,559
You told me to be honest with you.

28
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,240
That doesn't mean
you can go after my girl!

29
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,160
Why couldn't you have asked
for someone else?

30
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:20,649
You screwed over your own father!

31
00:01:20,650 --> 00:01:22,463
You can ask for my Yaoqin next time.

32
00:01:22,464 --> 00:01:23,270
I...

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:27,758
If you two want
to talk about family matters,

34
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,080
can you wait until after I'm gone?

35
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,729
Deal.

36
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:33,800
You can't let your father lose out.

37
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,680
How did we end up talking about girls?

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,480
Get to the point!

39
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,089
So, I approached Qing

40
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,559
because she never takes clients.

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,959
I'm already familiar

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,480
with the other girls.

43
00:01:49,068 --> 00:01:51,161
After I gained Qing's trust,

44
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:53,000
I planned to...

45
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:56,190
What are you trying to do?

46
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,400
Mr. Song, allow me to serve you tonight.

47
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,120
Consider it my way
to repay your kindness.

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,800
Mr. Song, why the rush?

49
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,550
I see you need some wine
to aid your spirits.

50
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,240
Qing! You...

51
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:22,119
Mr. Song, is this me
that displeases you,

52
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,609
or is it this place?

53
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:25,479
I am upright

54
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,630
and honorable.

55
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:29,240
If it weren't to seek justice for you,

56
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,320
I would never set foot
in a place like this.

57
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:33,889
I respect you.

58
00:02:33,890 --> 00:02:35,390
You should respect me too.

59
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:45,910
What... What are you doing?

60
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,360
My apologies, Mr. Song.

61
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,800
You should go.

62
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,670
You should leave.

63
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:59,390
I can tell you're a good man.

64
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:03,880
Someone is trying to set you up.

65
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,080
Who?

66
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,800
It's Zhao Tai, isn't it?

67
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,199
It must be him!

68
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,190
No.

69
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:10,270
It's...

70
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,320
It's someone else.

71
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:13,969
Stop asking questions.

72
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,110
Just go!

73
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:15,889
I...

74
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,000
Go!

75
00:03:18,730 --> 00:03:19,750
Farewell.

76
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,440
How can you give up halfway?

77
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,296
Do you know how much effort

78
00:03:28,297 --> 00:03:29,839
I've put into this day?

79
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,250
But I don't think
Mr. Song is a bad person.

80
00:03:33,446 --> 00:03:37,160
Maybe there's been
a misunderstanding, Mr. Zhou.

81
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,176
When I talked to him,

82
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,321
there wasn't a hint of deception
in his eyes.

83
00:03:41,322 --> 00:03:42,720
His eyes?

84
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,110
Song Yuan is a master of deceit.

85
00:03:47,548 --> 00:03:49,390
He fooled you.

86
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,800
I told you.
As long as Song Yuan is alive,

87
00:03:56,093 --> 00:03:57,992
I can't marry you.

88
00:04:00,086 --> 00:04:02,070
You're heartless, Tai!

89
00:04:02,071 --> 00:04:04,012
Are you even my son anymore?

90
00:04:04,013 --> 00:04:05,649
I've always taught you

91
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:07,529
that women are meant to be cherished

92
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,910
and loved.

93
00:04:08,966 --> 00:04:10,267
How could you be so cruel

94
00:04:10,268 --> 00:04:12,290
as to hurt a girl who loves you?

95
00:04:12,690 --> 00:04:14,485
She's a prostitute.

96
00:04:14,486 --> 00:04:16,267
That makes it even more admirable!

97
00:04:16,268 --> 00:04:17,358
She grew up

98
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:18,696
in a brothel,

99
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:21,600
surrounded by sleazy men every day.

100
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
Yet she managed to preserve her chastity
and refuse to take clients.

101
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,879
And what is that?

102
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:28,879
That's the strength of blooming
in the mire!

103
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,489
How many respectable young ladies
out there

104
00:04:31,490 --> 00:04:33,880
could do the same?

105
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:42,550
After that?

106
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,880
After that...

107
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,440
Mr. Zhou, I can explain...

108
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:53,720
Qing!

109
00:04:55,130 --> 00:04:56,480
Mr. Zhou...

110
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,230
I want to make this clear.

111
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,510
I only gave her a gentle push.

112
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,720
I didn't expect her
to hit the table and die.

113
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,000
It's not my fault.

114
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:14,230
Song Yuan,

115
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,350
you're a dead man.

116
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:26,436
Go.

117
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,350
Drunk and still insisted
on coming to Cuixiang Brothel!

118
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,040
So, Miss Qing died

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,110
without ever knowing
your real identity, yes?

120
00:06:23,760 --> 00:06:24,920
That's right.

121
00:06:25,850 --> 00:06:27,759
They say women are fox spirits.

122
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:31,200
She must have turned into a fox spirit
after death and found out I'm Zhao...

123
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,880
Mr. Ma.

124
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,569
We all saw you in action

125
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:39,159
last night.

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,200
Only you can deal with this fox spirit.

127
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,040
Don't worry.

128
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,000
You'll be handsomely rewarded
once it's done.

129
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,760
Right, Father?

130
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,000
Father?

131
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,270
Father?

132
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:57,350
Father!

133
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,670
We can discuss the details.

134
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,550
My dear,

135
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,640
why did you leave so soon?

136
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,920
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Wife, Song Juan)
Tai has grown up.

137
00:07:18,151 --> 00:07:20,550
He won't listen to me anymore...

138
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:24,000
I just don't understand...

139
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:29,549
He once had true love
right in front of him,

140
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:32,320
but he didn't know how to cherish it.

141
00:07:33,002 --> 00:07:34,270
He doesn't realize

142
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,129
how wonderful it is to find someone

143
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:43,723
who genuinely loves you...

144
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:48,145
How could he not understand that?
