=Episode 22=

3
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,900
Why haven't you delivered it?

4
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:20,646
What time is it?

5
00:00:20,647 --> 00:00:22,159
He's not up yet?

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,368
Give it to me.

7
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,110
Tai.

8
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:32,110
Tai.

9
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:34,420
Tai.

10
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:38,233
My good son.

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:39,622
Wake up.

12
00:00:42,341 --> 00:00:44,060
You gave me a scare.

13
00:00:48,545 --> 00:00:51,097
That hurts! What's wrong with you?

14
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:52,060
Father.

15
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:54,709
Well...

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,310
How strange.

17
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,709
What's the matter?

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,897
I think I was
at Ling'er's place last night.

19
00:01:01,898 --> 00:01:03,680
She was staring at me
with her body in the air.

20
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,864
Bah!

21
00:01:04,865 --> 00:01:05,802
It was just a dream.

22
00:01:05,803 --> 00:01:07,820
Stop thinking about it.

23
00:01:08,356 --> 00:01:09,710
No.

24
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,310
No...

25
00:01:12,989 --> 00:01:14,828
My head still hurts.

26
00:01:14,829 --> 00:01:15,679
Let's take our time.

27
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:16,922
Take your time, Tai.

28
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:18,118
Take your concoction.

29
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:19,229
That's right.

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:30,670
Is it that good?

31
00:01:31,723 --> 00:01:33,390
It is.

32
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,684
This is fish wort soup.

33
00:01:35,556 --> 00:01:36,910
Do you want to have a taste?

34
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,679
No thanks.

35
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,149
Take it and you will be fine.

36
00:02:07,643 --> 00:02:08,910
Who are you people?

37
00:02:18,974 --> 00:02:21,368
Mr. Zhao.

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:25,155
It's me.

39
00:02:25,156 --> 00:02:28,570
(Mountain God Temple)

40
00:02:36,487 --> 00:02:37,586
That's a lot.

41
00:02:38,909 --> 00:02:40,573
I feel ashamed.

42
00:02:40,574 --> 00:02:44,406
I've been the Judicial Office's director
for more than ten years.

43
00:02:44,407 --> 00:02:46,566
This is from the brides

44
00:02:46,567 --> 00:02:48,350
and misjudged cases

45
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,510
I've had all these years.

46
00:02:50,647 --> 00:02:52,180
Mr. Li.

47
00:02:52,836 --> 00:02:54,871
Are you retiring?

48
00:02:54,872 --> 00:02:56,369
It's about time.

49
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:57,900
It's for the sake of my conscience.

50
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,328
I'd like to have a glorious retirement.

51
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:02,990
- Let's get to work.
- Sure.

52
00:03:07,614 --> 00:03:08,558
Bless me, Mountain God.

53
00:03:08,559 --> 00:03:09,870
Bless me, Mountain God.

54
00:03:39,076 --> 00:03:40,966
What do you want?

55
00:03:40,967 --> 00:03:43,380
Why can't I move at all?

56
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:46,710
Mr. Zhao.

57
00:03:47,098 --> 00:03:50,391
Didn't you come to me last night?

58
00:03:50,392 --> 00:03:53,100
No...

59
00:03:54,654 --> 00:03:57,540
I could see you from the beam.

60
00:03:57,621 --> 00:03:59,990
Since you're interested in me,

61
00:04:00,123 --> 00:04:03,729
we shall marry each other tonight.

62
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:04,719
Please don't...

63
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,602
I...

64
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:08,980
I was just kidding...

65
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:10,350
Ling'er.

66
00:04:11,738 --> 00:04:15,162
But you said you wanted to marry me
in front of everyone.

67
00:04:15,163 --> 00:04:18,780
Were you just kidding?

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,500
But, Ling'er...

69
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:24,100
We're from two different worlds.

70
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:28,340
It's all right.

71
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,660
Once you've hung yourself,

72
00:04:32,501 --> 00:04:34,457
the ceremony is partially completed.

73
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:35,853
No...

74
00:04:35,854 --> 00:04:37,097
Ling'er.

75
00:04:37,098 --> 00:04:39,206
Let me go
and I will burn spirit money for you.

76
00:04:39,207 --> 00:04:41,030
A lot of spirit money. Okay?

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,460
Drop the act already.

78
00:04:53,461 --> 00:04:54,940
Let him go at once!

79
00:05:19,949 --> 00:05:20,940
Quickly!

80
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:22,949
Run!

81
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,598
Master and I looked into it.

82
00:05:27,599 --> 00:05:29,870
They all belong to a troupe.

83
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:34,780
Are you saying
this has been nothing but a sham?

84
00:05:38,138 --> 00:05:39,222
We're done for.

85
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,870
They might have swapped

86
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:44,609
those burned letters.

87
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:46,478
What do we do now?

88
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:47,389
Sir!

89
00:05:48,698 --> 00:05:49,660
Sir!

90
00:05:50,196 --> 00:05:53,270
Mr. Li of the Judicial Office was
at the Mountain God burning his letter.

91
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,438
Why did Li

92
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:57,349
do such a foolish thing?

93
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,310
Trying to mess with my family, huh?

94
00:05:59,381 --> 00:06:01,399
Get rid of him!

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:01,984
Father.

96
00:06:01,985 --> 00:06:02,733
Don't panic.

97
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,030
Our priority now is those letters.

98
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,710
Wang Gang.

99
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:08,944
Go to Song Yuan's house.

100
00:06:08,945 --> 00:06:10,922
Those letters must be there.

101
00:06:10,923 --> 00:06:12,028
Yes, Mr. Zhao. Okay.

102
00:06:12,029 --> 00:06:13,620
Go now!

103
00:06:13,621 --> 00:06:15,190
Ma San.

104
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,590
Looks like it's about time for us
to fight head-to-head.

105
00:06:24,407 --> 00:06:26,122
Open up, Mr. Ma!

106
00:06:26,123 --> 00:06:28,150
- Coming.
- Mr. Ma!

107
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,910
- Where is Mr. Ma?
- Come on in.

108
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,239
- Mr. Ma.
- What's the matter with you?

109
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,239
This is bad. Two men came

110
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,435
to that Zhao's rescue.

111
00:06:42,436 --> 00:06:44,620
It's that fake Taoist surnamed Liu.

112
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:49,077
Looks like it's about time.

113
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:54,780
Leave no stone unturned!
