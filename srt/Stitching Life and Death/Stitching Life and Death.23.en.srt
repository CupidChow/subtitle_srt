00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Episode 23=

3
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,379
Bear with it.

4
00:00:23,040 --> 00:00:25,039
Mr. Ma.

5
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,116
Master Song.

6
00:00:26,117 --> 00:00:28,500
Why are you panic?

7
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:32,130
Both of them are on our side.

8
00:00:32,131 --> 00:00:33,490
So just go ahead.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,940
Mr. Li came to me.

10
00:00:36,022 --> 00:00:37,505
He told me

11
00:00:37,506 --> 00:00:40,260
that Ling'er went over
to his place these nights.

12
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:42,530
So I brought him
to the Mountain God Temple.

13
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,100
He burned his letter as planned.

14
00:00:51,339 --> 00:00:52,780
Great.

15
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,010
With Mr. Li's evidence,

16
00:00:55,033 --> 00:00:57,810
we're one step closer to victory.

17
00:00:58,509 --> 00:00:59,519
Oh, right.

18
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,810
I then brought Mr. Li
to the Grand Marshal's Mansion.

19
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:02,869
Guess what

20
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:04,021
I came home.

21
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,490
My place was in disarray!

22
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:08,380
Luckily, I gave all the letters
to you beforehand.

23
00:01:10,793 --> 00:01:14,700
I came to...

24
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,545
Are you afraid something bad
will happen to you?

25
00:01:18,546 --> 00:01:19,980
Yes.

26
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:25,139
If that happens,

27
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:28,179
I will be counting on you, Mr. Ma.

28
00:01:28,291 --> 00:01:31,599
The Zhao family sent their men there
to search your place.

29
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,912
That means they're not going
to show you mercy.

30
00:01:33,913 --> 00:01:36,450
Good grief! What do I do now?

31
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:38,499
Anyway, no matter what,

32
00:01:38,749 --> 00:01:41,099
you must help you, Mr. Ma.

33
00:01:41,469 --> 00:01:42,468
Okay?

34
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:43,539
Mr. Song.

35
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:44,739
Ling...

36
00:01:46,982 --> 00:01:48,130
It's Ling'er!

37
00:01:51,157 --> 00:01:53,643
Afraid not, Master Song.

38
00:01:53,644 --> 00:01:54,980
That's not Ling'er.

39
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,629
But you do know her.

40
00:01:57,630 --> 00:01:58,620
Do I?

41
00:02:07,935 --> 00:02:09,085
Mr. Song.

42
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,580
What... What exactly is going on here?

43
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,268
When Zhao Tai pushed me,

44
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,059
I passed out at once.

45
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,372
Everyone thought I was dead.

46
00:02:27,397 --> 00:02:31,005
The police then threw me
to the coffin home.

47
00:02:31,909 --> 00:02:33,899
My mother spent the whole night
searching for me

48
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,899
to give me a burial.

49
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:38,569
Qing. Qing!

50
00:02:39,651 --> 00:02:41,180
Qing.

51
00:02:41,266 --> 00:02:43,221
My good daughter!

52
00:02:43,222 --> 00:02:45,963
Wake up, Qing!

53
00:02:45,964 --> 00:02:48,250
My good daughter!

54
00:02:48,277 --> 00:02:49,580
Qing!

55
00:02:50,997 --> 00:02:52,503
Qing!

56
00:03:01,651 --> 00:03:03,050
Qing.

57
00:03:03,266 --> 00:03:05,129
This is great!

58
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,472
As long as you're still alive!

59
00:03:06,473 --> 00:03:09,456
Qing!

60
00:03:10,015 --> 00:03:13,250
She was afraid Zhao Tai
would come after me.

61
00:03:13,491 --> 00:03:15,818
So she told me to hide myself
in the Fox Fairy Shrine.

62
00:03:15,819 --> 00:03:17,690
She even got me a fake tomb.

63
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,970
I knew that

64
00:03:20,349 --> 00:03:21,820
you came to see me, Mr. Song.

65
00:03:23,149 --> 00:03:24,899
My gratitude to Mr. Ma.

66
00:03:25,030 --> 00:03:26,979
Mr. Ma found me.

67
00:03:27,070 --> 00:03:28,930
With Mr. Ma's help,

68
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:32,460
- Zhao Tai admitted to his crime.
- Miss Qing.

69
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:34,970
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

70
00:03:34,982 --> 00:03:36,490
You're welcome.

71
00:03:36,691 --> 00:03:37,469
Mr. Ma.

72
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:39,940
Can you really topple Zhao Tai down
by doing this?

73
00:03:40,069 --> 00:03:41,359
Not only him,

74
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,050
there's also Magistrate Zhao
and Feng Wu.

75
00:03:44,269 --> 00:03:45,389
All of those evil men,

76
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:46,940
none of them will get away with it.

77
00:03:49,055 --> 00:03:50,363
Is Mr. Song...

78
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,029
Well...

79
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,014
Is he doing well?

80
00:03:52,015 --> 00:03:53,610
Yes, he's all fine.

81
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,850
I've always felt guilty toward him.

82
00:03:59,004 --> 00:04:00,430
Those evil men

83
00:04:00,713 --> 00:04:03,220
are nothing but influential.

84
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,940
Yet he's decided
to fight them until the end.

85
00:04:06,539 --> 00:04:08,660
Even though he's all alone

86
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,356
and none of those victims

87
00:04:10,357 --> 00:04:13,130
are willing to be his witness,

88
00:04:13,513 --> 00:04:15,236
he never gives up.

89
00:04:15,237 --> 00:04:18,561
I'm moved by Mr. Song's gesture too.

90
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:20,518
That's why I've been helping him
at all cost.

91
00:04:21,448 --> 00:04:25,296
But he's no longer alone.

92
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,010
There's you, me,

93
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:28,676
Lichun, Qiu,

94
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:31,220
and those who are willing to speak up.

95
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,916
As well as the troupe members.

96
00:04:32,917 --> 00:04:34,140
That's right.

97
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,980
If I have a chance,

98
00:04:39,429 --> 00:04:41,860
I'd really like
to apologize to Mr. Song.

99
00:04:44,357 --> 00:04:46,050
What if

100
00:04:46,051 --> 00:04:48,140
you could do him a favor now?

101
00:04:50,153 --> 00:04:51,610
How?

102
00:04:56,902 --> 00:04:58,450
I got it now.

103
00:04:59,004 --> 00:05:00,700
Mr. Ma, you're behind

104
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,428
all this

105
00:05:02,429 --> 00:05:04,021
and what happened to Mr. Li.

106
00:05:04,022 --> 00:05:05,610
Isn't my master brilliant?

107
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,839
There's good news.

108
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,592
More and more people are willing to speak up
against Magistrate Zhao and Zhao Tai.

109
00:05:11,593 --> 00:05:12,785
That's great!

110
00:05:12,786 --> 00:05:14,980
But don't celebrate too early.

111
00:05:16,219 --> 00:05:18,108
- Qiu.
- Master.

112
00:05:18,109 --> 00:05:21,148
Lead the troupe members
to escort Mr. Song

113
00:05:21,149 --> 00:05:22,349
to the Grand Marshal's Mansion.

114
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,377
Tell Grand Marshal Zhang
to bring Mr. Li along

115
00:05:24,378 --> 00:05:26,100
to go to the military governor.

116
00:05:26,328 --> 00:05:27,367
What about you?

117
00:05:27,368 --> 00:05:29,260
I need to stay and stall them.

118
00:05:29,833 --> 00:05:32,330
We can't afford to make mistakes.

119
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:34,420
Thank you all.

120
00:05:34,830 --> 00:05:36,140
Rest assured.

121
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,312
I've looked into it.

122
00:05:38,313 --> 00:05:41,178
That Ma San knows a thing or two
about illusionary techniques.

123
00:05:41,179 --> 00:05:44,420
To put it bluntly,
it's nothing but a cover-up.

124
00:05:44,422 --> 00:05:46,770
Young Master Zhao's resurrection,

125
00:05:46,975 --> 00:05:48,770
the spirit's vengeance,

126
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:50,579
the Immortal's birthday celebration,

127
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,940
stitching the head to extend life,

128
00:05:52,953 --> 00:05:56,140
and the ridiculous fox demoness.

129
00:05:57,462 --> 00:06:00,869
They had those hallucinations
because of some sedatives.

130
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,174
They were all fake.

131
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,420
Great!

132
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,890
Deal with Ma San...

133
00:06:05,891 --> 00:06:08,450
No, get rid of him

134
00:06:08,549 --> 00:06:11,260
and these belong to you.

135
00:06:17,019 --> 00:06:18,980
If so,

136
00:06:19,193 --> 00:06:21,092
I shall drop the act now.

137
00:06:21,528 --> 00:06:25,730
I am the most wanted criminal
across nine provinces,

138
00:06:26,313 --> 00:06:28,100
Liu Yidao.

139
00:06:33,549 --> 00:06:35,069
One quick question.

140
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,860
What's your relationship
with Ten-Step Liu?

141
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,938
Ten-Step Liu?

142
00:06:38,939 --> 00:06:40,603
My name is Liu Yidao.

143
00:06:40,604 --> 00:06:43,380
Who is Ten-Step Liu to you?

144
00:06:43,891 --> 00:06:46,349
My name is Liu Yidao.

145
00:06:46,350 --> 00:06:47,303
Fine.

146
00:06:47,549 --> 00:06:49,540
You'd better be as good as him.

147
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,170
Deal?

148
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,996
Where are you going, Mr. Ma?

149
00:07:20,997 --> 00:07:22,330
Magistrate Zhao's place.

150
00:07:23,259 --> 00:07:24,820
Magistrate Zhao's place?

151
00:07:25,019 --> 00:07:25,900
Hurry.

152
00:07:27,185 --> 00:07:28,640
Keep an eye on my stall.

153
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:30,036
- Let's go.
- Come. Let's join them.

154
00:07:30,037 --> 00:07:31,840
- Come.
- Quickly. Follow them.
