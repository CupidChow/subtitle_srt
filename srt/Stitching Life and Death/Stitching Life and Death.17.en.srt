3
00:00:26,030 --> 00:00:28,270
Mercy, my good sir! Have mercy!

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,320
Open your eyes.

5
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:34,000
I know how it goes. I'll be silenced
as soon as I see your faces.

6
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:35,310
I'm not seeing anything!

7
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,700
Was I not clear?

8
00:00:38,235 --> 00:00:39,239
Sir.

9
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,540
That's a bit much.

10
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:42,660
Please open your eyes.

11
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:43,669
We brought you here

12
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:45,110
just to have you testify.

13
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,150
Gladly.

14
00:00:54,839 --> 00:00:56,150
Good man.

15
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,932
(Zhao's Mansion)

16
00:01:16,933 --> 00:01:19,190
It hurts!

17
00:01:20,111 --> 00:01:21,119
Father!

18
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:24,010
Get Ma San here now!

19
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,230
This is the place.

20
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:30,980
Open the door!

21
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:33,470
Open up!

22
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:36,620
This is the guy.

23
00:01:38,257 --> 00:01:39,260
Over there!

24
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:41,159
Master Song!

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:42,199
It's me, Master Song!

26
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:42,799
I know.

27
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:43,909
Why are you here again?

28
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,496
It's me!

29
00:01:44,497 --> 00:01:45,719
You know Master Song?

30
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,721
Of course.

31
00:01:46,722 --> 00:01:47,790
Master Song! Please...

32
00:01:48,373 --> 00:01:49,750
- Don't come in!
- Let us in!

33
00:01:50,075 --> 00:01:51,020
Master Song!

34
00:01:53,471 --> 00:01:54,580
Master Song!

35
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:55,996
Stay away!

36
00:01:57,522 --> 00:01:58,729
You didn't kill me last time,

37
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:00,438
and now you've brought help!

38
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:02,389
- What warranted this reaction?
- You!

39
00:02:02,875 --> 00:02:03,549
Master Song!

40
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,900
Stay away from me!

41
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:05,994
Help!

42
00:02:05,995 --> 00:02:07,020
Master Song!

43
00:02:11,750 --> 00:02:14,100
Master, have you ever had that feeling

44
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:16,950
where you know you forgot something,

45
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:20,799
but you just can't figure out
exactly what it is?

46
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,790
What exactly did you forget?

47
00:02:23,035 --> 00:02:24,340
It's like...

48
00:02:25,910 --> 00:02:27,590
Did you instruct me to do something?

49
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,129
- Stop chasing me!
- Stop running!

50
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,881
- Stop chasing me!
- You stop running first.

51
00:02:32,882 --> 00:02:35,100
Do you need my help?

52
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:37,872
Shoot!

53
00:02:38,315 --> 00:02:39,079
Master.

54
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,909
I forgot you asked me to go

55
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:41,950
to Master Song's residence.

56
00:02:41,951 --> 00:02:43,180
You forgot?

57
00:02:43,573 --> 00:02:44,452
I mean, they're close.

58
00:02:44,453 --> 00:02:45,478
They wouldn't...

59
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,740
Get going!

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:47,620
Qiu!

61
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,820
Wrong way.

62
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,260
Yes, sir!

63
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,320
Stop!

64
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,339
- If you stop chasing, I'll stop running!
- Why are you running in the first place?

65
00:02:54,339 --> 00:02:56,680
- I'll stop running.
- I'll stop chasing. Master Song!

66
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,439
You... You liar!

67
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,070
I knew I couldn't trust you!

68
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,600
(Last night,
Zhao Tai's medication wore off.)

69
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,860
(Luckily, he woke up to eat something
in the middle of the night.)

70
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,120
(I dumped all medicine into his food.)

71
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,510
Will I stay for dinner? No, thanks.

72
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,590
(Miss Lichun...)

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,150
(She's holding my hand...)

74
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:52,879
Stop running...

75
00:03:52,880 --> 00:03:54,310
Stop chasing me...

76
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,319
Stop running...

77
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,439
I'll stop...

78
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,620
Listen...

79
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,430
If you chase me again,
Mr. Ma is going to show up!

80
00:04:02,630 --> 00:04:05,820
No way.
Mr. Ma went to the magistrate's mansion.

81
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:08,189
He's not coming.

82
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:10,950
You tricked me, huh?

83
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:12,263
Fine.

84
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:14,947
Kill me if you must!

85
00:04:14,948 --> 00:04:16,169
I can't run anymore...

86
00:04:16,170 --> 00:04:17,580
Kill you?

87
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:19,514
What?

88
00:04:19,515 --> 00:04:21,230
Mr. Ma told me to come here.

89
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:23,159
He said I should testify

90
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:24,199
and have you

91
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,550
write a statement.

92
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,039
Right?

93
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:27,989
Right.

94
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:28,830
What?

95
00:04:29,588 --> 00:04:31,574
Did you not get the message from Qiu?

96
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,390
No one told me anything!

97
00:04:37,311 --> 00:04:38,852
You lunatics!

98
00:04:38,853 --> 00:04:41,340
Why didn't you say that earlier?

99
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:46,670
This way, please.

100
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:49,140
Magistrate Zhao.

101
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:50,879
You asked to see me?

102
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,020
Mr. Ma, you're here.

103
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,199
You brat!

104
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,300
Mr. Ma is here! Come clean right now!

105
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:03,420
Tai!

106
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,829
Tai! You've left this world too soon!

107
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:09,860
Don't leave me behind...

108
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,390
Father.

109
00:05:12,790 --> 00:05:15,389
I just had something on my mind.

110
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,020
Why are you so distraught?

111
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,270
You scared the life out of me!

112
00:05:21,110 --> 00:05:22,270
Talk.

113
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,550
It happened about two months ago.

114
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:29,269
Jiao.

115
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,669
Come on, drink!

116
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:31,950
Drink up!

117
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,583
Let's drink together!

118
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:35,807
Cheers!

119
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:40,789
What's the matter, Mr. Zhao?

120
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:41,989
What else?

121
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,949
It's that Song Yuan!

122
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,599
He's like a mad dog!

123
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,860
He won't leave Mr. Zhao alone!

124
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,669
He's relentless.

125
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,620
Song Yuan's been running all over town,

126
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,340
collecting every detail
about your past deeds.

127
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:00,829
After all that fuss,

128
00:06:00,830 --> 00:06:02,880
I can't even enjoy myself
when I'm here anymore.

129
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:04,549
Tong.

130
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,030
Don't be upset. Come on.

131
00:06:06,031 --> 00:06:07,523
Let's enjoy ourselves.

132
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,759
Mr. Zhao, don't worry so much.

133
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,879
Song Yuan could be

134
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,599
running all over town,
but he won't make it here.

135
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,389
Besides,

136
00:06:14,390 --> 00:06:18,180
we have company
as precious as gold here.

137
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:24,900
Gold?

138
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,670
What if I manage to get Song Yuan here?

139
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,390
That's brilliant! Absolutely brilliant!

140
00:06:37,070 --> 00:06:37,989
Come on!

141
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:39,639
Let's all raise a toast to Mr. Zhao.

142
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,599
Here, here!

143
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:41,580
Cheers!

144
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:52,580
Goodness!

145
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:56,670
Who is this handsome young gentleman?

146
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:01,300
What do you think? Not bad, right?

147
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,180
I could barely recognize you.

148
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:07,710
Is this the guy?

149
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,879
Mr. Zhao had me

150
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:12,879
make him a mask from human skin.

151
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,670
The one that was badly burned.

152
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,830
A human skin mask?

153
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,069
My craftsmanship is well-known

154
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,303
far and wide.

155
00:07:21,304 --> 00:07:22,779
Once you put that mask on,

156
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:25,180
not even your own mother
could recognize you.
