=Episode 21=

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:14,392
What?

4
00:00:14,393 --> 00:00:16,269
It's true. They've just taken him away.

5
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:19,260
Grand Marshal Zhang is in charge
of Grand Marshal's Mansion now.

6
00:00:19,295 --> 00:00:21,010
He used to be the deputy.

7
00:00:21,724 --> 00:00:23,610
That's tricky.

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:28,494
He's friends with Ma San and Song Yuan.

9
00:00:28,495 --> 00:00:31,370
And he arrested Feng Wu
upon the takeover.

10
00:00:32,008 --> 00:00:34,179
There goes
another left-hand man of mine!

11
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:35,839
He's nothing

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,279
but an assistant.

13
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,698
You're right.

14
00:00:38,699 --> 00:00:41,780
However, he's been
my follower all this while.

15
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:44,970
Well, they've started to play dirty.

16
00:00:58,509 --> 00:01:01,900
This can't go on.

17
00:01:02,669 --> 00:01:04,419
We need to figure out something.

18
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:11,188
Yes, we need to get out of here.

19
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:14,419
If I make it out alive,
I shall be your follower.

20
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:21,729
Is anyone there? Help!

21
00:01:21,730 --> 00:01:22,916
He's dying!

22
00:01:22,917 --> 00:01:25,078
Help!

23
00:01:25,644 --> 00:01:27,403
My stomach hurts so bad!

24
00:01:27,404 --> 00:01:28,545
He's dying!

25
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:30,170
Help, sir!

26
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,429
It hurts so bad!

27
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,700
He's sick?

28
00:01:34,466 --> 00:01:35,732
That looks serious.

29
00:01:37,222 --> 00:01:38,510
Is he dying?

30
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:41,158
Are you trying to run away?

31
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:46,810
Get up!

32
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,260
You think this is funny?

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,269
Do you think

34
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,819
you can run away from here?

35
00:01:53,877 --> 00:01:55,380
No way!

36
00:01:55,749 --> 00:01:57,660
- Let both of them out.
- Yes, sir.

37
00:01:58,982 --> 00:02:00,850
Them.

38
00:02:03,660 --> 00:02:05,018
Magistrate Zhao was asking for you.

39
00:02:05,019 --> 00:02:05,708
How about me?

40
00:02:05,709 --> 00:02:06,620
Move.

41
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:08,792
Sirs.

42
00:02:08,793 --> 00:02:10,970
Don't forget about me.

43
00:02:13,811 --> 00:02:15,220
Mr. Li.

44
00:02:18,549 --> 00:02:19,699
Mr. Li.

45
00:02:22,146 --> 00:02:23,460
Mr. Li.

46
00:02:24,502 --> 00:02:26,050
Mr. Li.

47
00:02:27,528 --> 00:02:29,180
You gave me a scare.

48
00:02:31,731 --> 00:02:33,940
Did you burn the midnight oil again?

49
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,690
It's terrifying.

50
00:02:39,433 --> 00:02:42,660
Are you having another tricky case?

51
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:46,490
It's not a case.
It is literally terrifying.

52
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:47,820
Well...

53
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:49,339
Do you mean a ghost?

54
00:02:51,019 --> 00:02:52,309
Song.

55
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:55,460
I remember you told me
about Ling'er's case.

56
00:02:55,789 --> 00:02:57,679
Did she hang herself after that?

57
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,250
Yes!

58
00:03:00,626 --> 00:03:01,789
I'm doomed.

59
00:03:01,790 --> 00:03:03,020
It's her.

60
00:03:03,084 --> 00:03:04,414
Did you know?

61
00:03:04,415 --> 00:03:07,047
She's been coming over these nights.

62
00:03:07,048 --> 00:03:08,490
That gave me a fright!

63
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:12,970
Mr. Li...

64
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,669
I'm timid, Mr. Li.

65
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,220
Stop scaring me.

66
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:19,690
Wait a minute.

67
00:03:19,724 --> 00:03:20,770
Mr. Li.

68
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,490
Don't...

69
00:03:21,491 --> 00:03:24,050
Don't you believe in Jesus?

70
00:03:25,164 --> 00:03:26,741
Don't even bring that up.

71
00:03:26,742 --> 00:03:29,330
It's not working at all.

72
00:03:38,859 --> 00:03:40,196
Song.

73
00:03:40,197 --> 00:03:41,672
This stays

74
00:03:41,673 --> 00:03:42,428
between you and I

75
00:03:42,429 --> 00:03:43,221
All right.

76
00:03:43,222 --> 00:03:43,636
Go ahead.

77
00:03:43,637 --> 00:03:44,639
All in all,

78
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,148
I'm partially responsible

79
00:03:46,149 --> 00:03:49,259
for Ling'er case.

80
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:51,059
Do you get what I mean?

81
00:03:52,364 --> 00:03:53,740
Huh?

82
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,419
Don't you know this man surnamed Ma?

83
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,392
Mr. Ma?

84
00:04:00,393 --> 00:04:01,850
Now you got it.

85
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,349
I guess so.

86
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:05,723
Just tell me

87
00:04:05,724 --> 00:04:07,250
what I need to do.

88
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:09,180
Mr. Li.

89
00:04:09,506 --> 00:04:11,141
You came to the right person.

90
00:04:11,142 --> 00:04:12,430
I know that very well.

91
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:13,820
Let me teach you.

92
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,050
Please witness
their crimes, Mountain God.

93
00:04:19,746 --> 00:04:21,716
Please punish them severely.

94
00:04:21,717 --> 00:04:22,756
Master!

95
00:04:22,757 --> 00:04:24,100
This is bad, Master!

96
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:24,879
What is it?

97
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,869
You're so panic.

98
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:29,220
Many of our neighbors are burning letters
at the Mountain God Temple.

99
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:32,490
Isn't that a good thing?

100
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:35,367
It shows that we're getting
more and more testimonies.

101
00:04:35,368 --> 00:04:37,228
But we're still...

102
00:04:37,229 --> 00:04:40,420
Never mind.
What matters is they trust us now.

103
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:42,429
Having seen Feng Wu getting arrested,

104
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:43,730
they've started to trust us.

105
00:04:43,731 --> 00:04:45,140
That's more than enough.

106
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:47,860
I still don't believe it.

107
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,178
Master Song couldn't even

108
00:04:49,179 --> 00:04:50,629
stop them back then.

109
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:51,940
You still don't believe me?

110
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,420
There he is.

111
00:04:57,608 --> 00:04:58,490
Mr. Wang.

112
00:04:59,135 --> 00:05:00,380
Mr. Ma.

113
00:05:00,866 --> 00:05:03,374
Did Master Song request
to reopen Miss Ling'er's case?

114
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:04,678
Of course he did.

115
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:05,999
That's great.

116
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,501
I was at the Guangze Restaurant then.

117
00:05:08,502 --> 00:05:09,310
However...

118
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:12,436
Anyway, I saw something.

119
00:05:12,437 --> 00:05:14,952
I wanted to see Master Song.

120
00:05:14,953 --> 00:05:17,301
But he was not around.

121
00:05:17,302 --> 00:05:18,618
If you happen to see him,

122
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:19,885
tell him

123
00:05:19,928 --> 00:05:22,940
to come to me if he has any questions.

124
00:05:23,389 --> 00:05:24,820
Thank you.

125
00:05:25,004 --> 00:05:26,021
Sure.

126
00:05:26,022 --> 00:05:27,883
Oh, right. Like me,

127
00:05:27,884 --> 00:05:29,105
there are some

128
00:05:29,106 --> 00:05:33,127
who heard or saw something on that day.

129
00:05:33,128 --> 00:05:36,100
I came to see you on behalf of them all.

130
00:05:36,546 --> 00:05:38,801
I'll leave you to it, Mr. Ma.

131
00:05:39,011 --> 00:05:39,985
Thank you so much.

132
00:05:39,986 --> 00:05:41,570
Thank you, Mr. Wang.

133
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:44,103
Master.

134
00:05:50,648 --> 00:05:54,050
I heard that you were planning
a prison break.

135
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,108
I used to be a bandit

136
00:06:02,109 --> 00:06:04,065
who killed many lives.

137
00:06:04,066 --> 00:06:08,069
I had no choice
but to pretend to be a Taoist.

138
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:09,590
Is that why you fed me the concoction?

139
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:12,196
Not only did you cheat me out of money,

140
00:06:12,197 --> 00:06:14,388
but you also fed my son
some fake concoction.

141
00:06:14,389 --> 00:06:17,940
I can crush you like some ants!

142
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:21,629
It's just I'm short-handed.

143
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,665
So you have a chance to atone your sin.

144
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:24,734
Got it?

145
00:06:24,735 --> 00:06:26,654
Thank you for giving us a chance, sir.

146
00:06:26,655 --> 00:06:28,358
I shall be at your service.

147
00:06:29,026 --> 00:06:30,260
Me too.

148
00:07:04,989 --> 00:07:06,579
Why am I on the floor?

149
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:11,820
Where am I?

150
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:16,388
Where is my place?

151
00:07:16,389 --> 00:07:18,339
Mr. Zhao...

152
00:07:22,590 --> 00:07:24,380
Mr. Zhao...

153
00:07:25,109 --> 00:07:27,940
Do you still remember me?

154
00:07:29,149 --> 00:07:30,299
Ling'er?

155
00:07:31,237 --> 00:07:32,490
Ling'er!
