00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Episode 3=

3
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:13,349
Are all of you seeing this?

4
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:14,269
Do you see this?

5
00:00:14,270 --> 00:00:15,540
The Old Immortal is real!

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:21,910
Oh, my goodness!

7
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:23,950
Terribly sorry, Old Immortal!

8
00:00:23,951 --> 00:00:25,350
Darn it!

9
00:00:25,351 --> 00:00:26,861
The gun misfired!

10
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,110
Fret not, Grand Marshal.

11
00:00:29,111 --> 00:00:32,110
I was merely shot in the head.

12
00:00:32,111 --> 00:00:33,669
My spiritual energy is leaking a bit.

13
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:35,261
I cannot stay long.

14
00:00:35,271 --> 00:00:36,420
Farewell.

15
00:00:37,111 --> 00:00:38,941
Thank you, Old Immortal.

16
00:00:39,951 --> 00:00:41,150
Sending off Old Immortal.

17
00:00:41,151 --> 00:00:42,540
Thank you, Old Immortal.

18
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,621
Mr. Ma.

19
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,189
I know what kind of man Song Yuan is.

20
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:55,200
But there's nothing we can do now.

21
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,189
The order from the four
regional warlords is clear.

22
00:00:57,190 --> 00:00:59,860
He's to be executed by firing squad
the day after tomorrow.

23
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,220
Darn.

24
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,981
Even the highest authority
can't save him now.

25
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:08,869
You know what, though?

26
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:10,421
This peach is actually quite sweet.

27
00:01:11,671 --> 00:01:13,975
Grand Marshal, how about this?

28
00:01:13,976 --> 00:01:16,237
Instead of a firing squad,

29
00:01:16,238 --> 00:01:17,741
we behead Song Yuan instead.

30
00:01:17,758 --> 00:01:19,131
What do you think?

31
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:21,630
Mr. Ma.

32
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,109
Are you worried that a bullet
might not kill Master Song?

33
00:01:24,110 --> 00:01:25,261
No.

34
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,061
Deputy Zhang, you misunderstand me.

35
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:28,661
If we behead him,

36
00:01:28,991 --> 00:01:32,208
that counts as carrying out
the execution, right?

37
00:01:32,209 --> 00:01:36,571
I can just sew his head
back on afterward.

38
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:41,869
Wait, wait...

39
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,580
Let me get this straight.

40
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:47,429
You want me to give the order
to chop off Song Yuan's head,

41
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:48,429
yes?

42
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:50,741
And then you'll sew

43
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:52,630
the head back on

44
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:56,301
so he can have a complete body
for burial?

45
00:01:58,591 --> 00:01:59,741
Grand Marshal.

46
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:01,061
Sewing the head back on

47
00:02:01,391 --> 00:02:03,140
is a way of extending life.

48
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,630
Darn! What in the world?

49
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:06,780
Sewing a head back on
can bring someone back to life?

50
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,861
That's a thing?

51
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,100
So, what do you think, sir?

52
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:26,421
Sir.

53
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,300
I don't think this counts

54
00:02:28,511 --> 00:02:30,501
as defying a military order.

55
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,669
It's actually a good thing.

56
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,261
Darn.

57
00:02:42,110 --> 00:02:44,100
Anyone who can't see that is a fool.

58
00:02:45,071 --> 00:02:46,221
Proceed with the plan!

59
00:02:57,663 --> 00:02:59,091
Master Song!

60
00:02:59,198 --> 00:03:01,891
You don't have to face
a firing squad anymore.

61
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,979
Really?

62
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:06,981
Yes. You'll be beheaded instead.

63
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,501
Master.

64
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,820
Can you really sew a head back on?

65
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,540
If I can even summon
the Old Immortal of the South Pole,

66
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,949
sewing a head back on

67
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:32,540
is nothing.

68
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:36,861
Are you learning
how to do it now, Master?

69
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,820
What do you mean "learning it now"?

70
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:40,141
I'm...

71
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,900
I'm refreshing old knowledge.

72
00:03:42,991 --> 00:03:44,469
You know nothing.

73
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,740
Master Song is about to be executed!

74
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:51,820
I'm the master, and I'm not worried.

75
00:03:52,351 --> 00:03:54,820
Why are you so anxious?

76
00:03:54,911 --> 00:03:56,669
Well, have you

77
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,829
done this before?

78
00:03:57,830 --> 00:03:59,469
- No.
- No?

79
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:01,740
- But I've seen it.
- You've seen it?

80
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:06,829
The last time someone did this

81
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:09,309
was probably back
in the late Qing Dynasty.

82
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:11,990
Late Qing Dynasty?
Qing has already fallen, Master!

83
00:04:11,991 --> 00:04:13,900
That was ages ago!

84
00:04:13,991 --> 00:04:16,989
You fool! Who encounters situations
like this every day

85
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,269
to practice regularly?

86
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:18,749
Well...

87
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:19,830
Well what?

88
00:04:19,831 --> 00:04:22,340
Be quiet. You're disturbing my reading.

89
00:04:23,551 --> 00:04:24,820
Answer me.

90
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,540
Did you handle the task I gave you?

91
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:30,469
No.

92
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,301
Then, get to it!

93
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,189
Yes, yes...

94
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,230
Useless.

95
00:04:36,231 --> 00:04:37,780
All day long.

96
00:04:55,671 --> 00:04:56,589
Qiu.

97
00:04:56,590 --> 00:04:57,550
Master.

98
00:04:57,551 --> 00:05:00,950
Once the beheading is done, bring him back
to the shop immediately. Don't delay on the way.

99
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:02,380
- Got it?
- Yes, sir.

100
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,861
What should we do?

101
00:05:08,030 --> 00:05:09,070
Deputy Zhang.

102
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:10,910
Why isn't the Grand Marshal here yet?

103
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:14,540
He had some bad food at the banquet

104
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:16,429
a few days ago.

105
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:17,540
Got an upset stomach.

106
00:05:19,231 --> 00:05:21,149
Well, it's getting late.

107
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:22,309
Shall we begin?

108
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:23,540
Proceed.

109
00:05:31,951 --> 00:05:33,181
Ladies and gentlemen!

110
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,989
Justice

111
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:37,350
will always prevail!

112
00:05:37,351 --> 00:05:38,510
No criminal can escape

113
00:05:38,511 --> 00:05:43,620
the long arm of the law!

114
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:44,950
Picture this.

115
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:47,830
You're enjoying a hot pot,
drinking wine,

116
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:49,269
maybe even with a little company,

117
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,181
listening to music.

118
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:55,060
Then suddenly a murderer shows up!

119
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,709
Isn't that disgusting?

120
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:58,230
Darn it!

121
00:05:58,231 --> 00:05:59,350
Enough already!

122
00:05:59,351 --> 00:05:59,989
Sir.

123
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,910
Stop rambling!

124
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:02,100
Sir.

125
00:06:04,471 --> 00:06:05,679
Hurry up!

126
00:06:08,078 --> 00:06:09,546
Criminal Song Yuan is guilty

127
00:06:09,547 --> 00:06:11,110
of heinous crimes!

128
00:06:11,111 --> 00:06:13,421
Today, justice will be served!

129
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:16,360
Off with his head!

130
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:17,901
Mr. Ma!

131
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:42,557
Cooperate.

132
00:06:42,558 --> 00:06:43,701
Lower.

133
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:45,500
Don't move.

134
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,741
The blade is blunt.

135
00:07:03,831 --> 00:07:04,830
Sir,

136
00:07:04,831 --> 00:07:06,110
just put an end to my misery!

137
00:07:06,111 --> 00:07:07,220
Please!

138
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,380
It's been a while since I've killed.
Don't move or I might miss.

139
00:07:14,511 --> 00:07:15,950
Darn it!

140
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:17,261
Are you performing tricks up there?

141
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,950
Go!

142
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,220
Yes, sir!

143
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,021
That was terrifying!

144
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,340
Come on!

145
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:35,830
Make way!

146
00:07:35,831 --> 00:07:37,301
Make way, please!

147
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:39,100
Fall back!

148
00:07:39,951 --> 00:07:41,861
- Make way!
- Hurry!

149
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:43,500
What's going on?

150
00:07:44,511 --> 00:07:45,660
Are you all right, sir?

151
00:07:46,111 --> 00:07:47,220
I'm fine.

152
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,100
Withdraw!

153
00:07:55,470 --> 00:07:56,461
Let's follow them.

154
00:07:56,511 --> 00:07:57,741
Out of the way!

155
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:58,830
Make way!

156
00:07:58,831 --> 00:07:59,981
Thank you, sir!

157
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:03,309
Let me in!

158
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:04,301
What are you doing?

159
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,350
What do you want?

160
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:07,301
Stop!

161
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,989
You can look,

162
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,380
but you cannot disturb my master.

163
00:08:11,551 --> 00:08:12,390
We won't.

164
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:13,660
Just let us see.

165
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:18,540
- They chopped his head off?
- Yes.

166
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,440
They chopped his head off?

167
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:21,701
They did.

168
00:08:21,911 --> 00:08:22,940
Really?

169
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:25,989
One clean chop.

170
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,500
I saw it with my own eyes.

171
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,820
Out of the way!

172
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,820
Magistrate Zhao.

173
00:08:36,991 --> 00:08:38,060
Deputy Zhang.

174
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:39,750
Is the Grand Marshal all right?

175
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,990
He has important matters to attend to.

176
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:44,221
I'm here to maintain order.

177
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:46,901
Magistrate Zhao,
if there's nothing else,

178
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:48,581
you may leave.

179
00:09:04,191 --> 00:09:05,341
Thank you, sir.

180
00:09:13,991 --> 00:09:14,829
Sir.

181
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,420
Mr. Ma is still working on it.

182
00:09:16,703 --> 00:09:17,773
Again.

183
00:09:18,667 --> 00:09:20,051
Again!

184
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:24,826
Darn it!

185
00:09:24,827 --> 00:09:27,410
Why are you covering your noses?
Put those hands down!
