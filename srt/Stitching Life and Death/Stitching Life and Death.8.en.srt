=Stitching Life and Death=

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Episode 8=

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,849
One incense before
the Mountain God's altar,

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,370
confessing past wrongs
to the great deity.

5
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:19,800
Youth is prone to folly.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:22,800
May the celestial lords be lenient.

7
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:43,970
Get up.

8
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:45,659
Why are you still standing there?

9
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,970
Hurry and help my son up!

10
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,459
Magistrate.

11
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:54,659
Mr. Ma.

12
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,849
The ritual

13
00:00:55,850 --> 00:00:57,490
is mostly completed.

14
00:00:59,330 --> 00:01:01,040
Mostly?

15
00:01:02,941 --> 00:01:06,090
The affairs of the underworld
have been settled.

16
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,690
However, he needs to do good deeds
and accumulate good karma.

17
00:01:08,876 --> 00:01:10,690
It all depends on you
whether to build bridges

18
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:13,090
or repair the roads.

19
00:01:14,770 --> 00:01:16,370
Mr. Ma, please wait.

20
00:01:18,701 --> 00:01:20,177
It must've been tough on you.

21
00:01:20,178 --> 00:01:21,690
Sorry for the trouble.

22
00:01:25,916 --> 00:01:26,840
Son.

23
00:01:27,145 --> 00:01:28,200
Do you feel better?

24
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,610
Master,

25
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,840
how did you find out

26
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,619
about Ms. Ruyi's disappearance?

27
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,410
Didn't Master Song say this himself?

28
00:01:48,490 --> 00:01:50,160
He has interviewed many people

29
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,240
to collect evidence of their crimes.

30
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,800
Mr. Ma.

31
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,730
Master Song.

32
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:06,120
So, Ms. Lichun was the one
who told you about it.

33
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:11,600
Mr. Ma, this is Ruyi's mother.

34
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:14,969
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

35
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,840
My daughter's body
has been finally located.

36
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,579
Now, I can lay her to rest.

37
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,680
Please get up.

38
00:02:23,330 --> 00:02:24,480
Qiu.

39
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:31,040
Master.

40
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:34,930
Madam, you should take this first.

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,249
Take it as a compensation
for Ruyi and your family.

42
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,450
This...

43
00:02:40,127 --> 00:02:41,051
Here.

44
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,370
Take it.

45
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:55,370
What does she mean by that?

46
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,450
Ms. Lichun said

47
00:03:00,476 --> 00:03:02,279
everyone out there is cursing you out.

48
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,857
They said you cured Zhao Tai

49
00:03:03,858 --> 00:03:05,793
for money's sake.

50
00:03:06,105 --> 00:03:07,617
So, you were a mute, huh?

51
00:03:07,618 --> 00:03:09,246
No wonder you never spoke.

52
00:03:09,247 --> 00:03:10,053
Qiu.

53
00:03:10,054 --> 00:03:11,890
Must your mouth always run unchecked?

54
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,669
Ms. Lichun, in this world, you have nothing
to fear if your conscience is clear.

55
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,830
It doesn't matter.

56
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:21,589
Madam, you don't need to worry either.

57
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,789
Master Song and I

58
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:25,300
will definitely
uphold justice for Ms. Ruyi.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,860
I know.

60
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,860
Master Song already told me.

61
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:39,910
What does she mean by that?

62
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,660
Ms. Lichun said

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,500
you were cute.

64
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:49,350
You're making me embarrassed here.

65
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:51,020
By the way, Master Song...

66
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,990
Dad, do you truly intend to build bridges
and repair the roads?

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,500
Of course.

68
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:23,709
It's a waste of money
and energy, you know?

69
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,750
Mr. Zhao, you may not know.

70
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:29,660
When Magistrate Zhao takes on
public welfare projects,

71
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,900
he always lines his pockets first.

72
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:36,589
If you wish to make money,
repair the roads.

73
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:37,829
Once the roads are repaired,

74
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:40,900
we'll have plenty of money.

75
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,500
Mr. Zhao.

76
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:48,309
I threw up a lot just two days ago.

77
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:49,620
I quit drinking since then.

78
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,150
Don't let him drink that much.

79
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,639
Son, you'll take over my position

80
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:56,109
sooner or later.

81
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:00,060
Let me tell you how to repair roads.

82
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,709
When you repair them,

83
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,269
you mustn't repair them completely.

84
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,990
You have to cut corners.

85
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,110
Won't the roads break down again?

86
00:05:13,349 --> 00:05:14,990
We can repair them again after that.

87
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,550
That's right.

88
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:21,842
Better to pave 10,000 miles of road...

89
00:05:21,843 --> 00:05:24,870
Than to read 10,000 books.

90
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:27,959
I'm sure my son is this intelligent

91
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,780
because he inherited my genes.

92
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,639
He's talented.

93
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,060
He's a prodigy.

94
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:34,359
Son,

95
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,199
come.

96
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,660
You guys can go ahead.

97
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:38,270
Come.

98
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:41,799
Here it comes.

99
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,380
Fresh pork for sale.

100
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:46,429
Fish for sale!

101
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,029
Fresh fish for sale!

102
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,150
Mister.

103
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:55,549
I'm not selling it to you. Go away.

104
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:58,149
- Hurry and leave.
- What do you mean by this?

105
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:01,549
I don't sell my things to guys
who are in cahoots with the villains.

106
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:02,639
Explain yourself.

107
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:04,380
Who's in cahoots with the villains?

108
00:06:04,912 --> 00:06:08,900
You and your master, Ma San.

109
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,566
Zhao Tai is a despicable scum
who has committed atrocious deeds.

110
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,169
Now that he's finally going to die,

111
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,042
you guys actually went to rescue him.

112
00:06:15,043 --> 00:06:16,460
Now, you want to buy fish from me?

113
00:06:17,792 --> 00:06:19,500
Guys, listen.

114
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:22,310
He wants to have fish.
What should he do?

115
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,919
- Catch them himself.
- Catch them himself.

116
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:24,829
Am I right?

117
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,079
Did you hear that?

118
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,399
Go and catch them yourself.

119
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,679
- That's right.
- Precisely.

120
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,829
You want vegetables?

121
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:31,270
Go and plant them yourself.

122
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:32,919
You want meat?

123
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,340
Rear them yourself.

124
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:37,780
Leave.

125
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:39,940
I finally understand now.

126
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:41,990
What's wrong?

127
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,989
You guys knew that Zhao Tai
was a despicable scum, huh?

128
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,589
But why did all of you keep quiet

129
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:48,239
when Master Song approached you all?

130
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,869
You think I'm easy to bully
because I'm an orphan, huh?

131
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:53,479
Don't sell anything
to the Zhao family, then!

132
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,710
Just starve them to death!

133
00:06:55,710 --> 00:06:57,459
I didn't want to criticize
you guys initially.

134
00:06:57,459 --> 00:06:58,999
But you guys are too full of yourselves.

135
00:06:58,999 --> 00:07:01,391
I'm sure you know how timid you were
when we needed you the most.

136
00:07:01,392 --> 00:07:03,020
I'll say this.

137
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:04,780
I won't spend a dime here

138
00:07:04,781 --> 00:07:06,782
as long as that bastard roams free!

139
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,710
Cowards.

140
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:13,500
You and your sharp tongue.

141
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:17,150
Qiu.

142
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,900
Time to eat.

143
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:22,550
Qiu?

144
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:25,922
Stop looking.
Just a simple meal is fine.

145
00:07:25,923 --> 00:07:27,150
Come and eat.

146
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,150
Master.

147
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,879
Why don't you buy
the groceries tomorrow?

148
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:37,129
Maybe they'll sell it to you.

149
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:39,830
You're as blunt as ever.

150
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:41,550
What?

151
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,430
You think I can do everything

152
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,780
that you cannot?

153
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:48,429
I'm just angry.

154
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,220
What did I teach you usually?

155
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,929
Just do good deeds

156
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,750
and don't question what lies ahead.

157
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,880
You cannot control
other people's mouths.

158
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,240
They simply don't know what's
best for them. They even told you off.

159
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,119
I was angry at that.

160
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,690
You said the people
represent the heavens.

161
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,710
That doesn't give them the right
to change whenever they like.

162
00:08:05,210 --> 00:08:07,180
Silly boy, that's enough.

163
00:08:07,261 --> 00:08:08,710
By the way,

164
00:08:09,830 --> 00:08:13,500
do not say
that you're an orphan in the future.

165
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,479
I'm here, aren't I?

166
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,340
Don't say such inauspicious things.

167
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,620
Here.

168
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:22,990
I kept a bowl of meat for you.

169
00:08:25,990 --> 00:08:27,150
Eat up.

170
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:31,110
Eat up.

171
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,469
Why are you staring at it?

172
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,870
Eat up.

173
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,660
Thank you, Master.

174
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,470
Dad.

175
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:00,060
Ma San knows a lot about us.

176
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:01,740
Will he rat us out?

177
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,100
The fewer people know about this,

178
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,359
the better.

179
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,359
The more people know,

180
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,790
the bigger the trouble.

181
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,060
I'm on your side.

182
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,150
Son,

183
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,829
this is my longtime partner.

184
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:28,980
We have great chemistry.

185
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,150
You have to call her Madam.

186
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:34,513
You can have fun all you like.

187
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:37,893
But if she's pregnant,
you have to make her go for an abortion.

188
00:09:37,894 --> 00:09:38,497
Yeah.

189
00:09:38,498 --> 00:09:39,939
I know that.

190
00:09:41,516 --> 00:09:43,093
You guys are here at this hour?

191
00:09:43,094 --> 00:09:44,664
We're here to see a criminal

192
00:09:44,665 --> 00:09:45,837
under Magistrate Zhao's order.

193
00:09:47,036 --> 00:09:48,477
Open it.

194
00:10:03,654 --> 00:10:05,582
Don't say
that I'm not giving you a chance here.

195
00:10:06,447 --> 00:10:08,753
Do a good job,

196
00:10:08,789 --> 00:10:12,164
and you'll earn yourself
the best chance there is.

197
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:24,620
I'm a hitman.

198
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:29,390
I never ask my targets for their names.

199
00:10:29,974 --> 00:10:34,419
Likewise,
they don't know my name either.
