=Stitching Life and Death=

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Episode 24=

3
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,511
I'll enter the tailor shop
from the front door.

4
00:00:15,611 --> 00:00:17,130
- Handsome.
- Yes.

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:19,610
You'll block Ma San's way
at the back door.

6
00:00:19,611 --> 00:00:20,370
Sure.

7
00:00:20,371 --> 00:00:21,520
This time,

8
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,320
he will meet his demise.

9
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:28,295
I stayed up the whole night
and came up with this plan.

10
00:00:29,131 --> 00:00:32,281
We will strike him
when he's unprepared.

11
00:00:32,454 --> 00:00:34,471
It's nothing but a perfect plan.

12
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:36,962
How amazing, Master.

13
00:00:36,963 --> 00:00:38,940
When the night falls,

14
00:00:38,941 --> 00:00:40,831
we can get to work.

15
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:43,241
Magistrate Zhao!

16
00:00:44,091 --> 00:00:45,320
Magistrate Zhao!

17
00:00:45,371 --> 00:00:47,566
I saw Ma San leading a lot of people.

18
00:00:47,567 --> 00:00:48,897
And they're coming this way.

19
00:00:48,898 --> 00:00:50,490
- What?
- Also, I've figured out

20
00:00:50,491 --> 00:00:51,760
the letters' whereabouts.

21
00:00:51,761 --> 00:00:52,664
Tell me now!

22
00:00:52,665 --> 00:00:54,715
I saw Grand Marshal Zhang and Song Yuan

23
00:00:54,716 --> 00:00:56,511
delivering them
to the military governor.

24
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,151
Darn it!

25
00:01:00,221 --> 00:01:02,242
He's trying to get me killed!

26
00:01:02,243 --> 00:01:04,970
Hurry, bring our men there
to stop Ma San.

27
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:06,104
Go now!

28
00:01:06,105 --> 00:01:07,071
Yes, sir!

29
00:01:07,072 --> 00:01:08,170
And you two.

30
00:01:08,171 --> 00:01:09,697
Get rid of Ma San!

31
00:01:09,698 --> 00:01:11,209
I'll give you three times the reward.

32
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,409
Go now. Go!

33
00:01:12,410 --> 00:01:13,760
- Let's go.
- Go!

34
00:01:16,665 --> 00:01:18,831
Tai.

35
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:21,831
Quickly!

36
00:01:25,791 --> 00:01:27,221
(Zhao's Mansion)

37
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,769
Come.

38
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:39,169
- Here. Hurry.
- It's here.

39
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,681
What is this, Ma San?

40
00:01:41,887 --> 00:01:44,760
- I'm here for Magistrate Zhao.
- Magistrate Zhao has issued the order.

41
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,875
If you dare step into this place,

42
00:01:46,876 --> 00:01:48,391
I will shoot you to dead.

43
00:01:50,432 --> 00:01:51,330
Step back

44
00:01:51,331 --> 00:01:52,520
or I will fire the gun.

45
00:01:52,534 --> 00:01:53,881
Captain Wang.

46
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:55,508
With all the evidence

47
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,031
and the people's testimonies,

48
00:01:57,065 --> 00:01:59,566
why do you insist
on defending the Zhaos?

49
00:01:59,567 --> 00:02:00,921
Captain Wang.

50
00:02:01,007 --> 00:02:02,650
If you stop me from entering it today,

51
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:03,601
I...

52
00:02:03,625 --> 00:02:05,580
I won't sell you fish again!

53
00:02:05,581 --> 00:02:07,326
Exactly! I won't sell you meat!

54
00:02:07,327 --> 00:02:08,111
Am I right?

55
00:02:10,134 --> 00:02:12,111
We will sell you nothing! Step aside!

56
00:02:12,112 --> 00:02:14,426
We won't sell you anything!
What can you do about it?

57
00:02:15,311 --> 00:02:17,501
(Zhao's Mansion)

58
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:20,521
More, Tai.

59
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:28,359
Not too much, Father.

60
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,959
We can't carry it if it's too heavy.

61
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,391
Our lives matter more, Father.

62
00:02:31,865 --> 00:02:36,090
Tai, the is the hard-earned money

63
00:02:36,091 --> 00:02:38,970
I schemed and plotted
my whole life to obtain!

64
00:02:38,971 --> 00:02:40,240
It's my lifeline.

65
00:02:40,241 --> 00:02:41,348
Quickly, get to work.

66
00:02:41,349 --> 00:02:43,049
Hurry. More!

67
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,120
Do it!

68
00:03:01,792 --> 00:03:06,281
You're Taoist Liu, aren't you?

69
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:09,760
My name is Liu Yidao.

70
00:03:10,418 --> 00:03:12,409
Gosh, cut the crap.

71
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:15,290
I thought of going to you tonight.

72
00:03:15,291 --> 00:03:18,080
Unexpectedly,
you made your way here instead.

73
00:03:18,081 --> 00:03:19,580
That's saved myself a trip.

74
00:03:19,581 --> 00:03:20,841
Hold on.

75
00:03:21,058 --> 00:03:22,161
Dao.

76
00:03:22,258 --> 00:03:23,624
I've heard a lot

77
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,879
about you.

78
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:29,081
I'm definitely not your match.

79
00:03:29,647 --> 00:03:32,831
Why don't we do it the other way?

80
00:03:33,931 --> 00:03:36,480
You know what's good for you.

81
00:03:36,571 --> 00:03:39,001
Say it. What do you want to do?

82
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:41,481
Wait.

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,191
Trying to use
your illusionary technique, huh?

84
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:45,521
Illusionary technique?

85
00:03:45,807 --> 00:03:47,671
Whatever you like to call it.

86
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:58,721
Illusionary technique.

87
00:03:58,774 --> 00:04:00,361
It must be some illusionary technique.

88
00:04:08,607 --> 00:04:10,281
Liu Yidao.

89
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:15,281
You should be called One-Move Liu.

90
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,060
Brothers,

91
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:20,506
looks like Magistrate Zhao is done for.

92
00:04:20,611 --> 00:04:23,201
Shall we surrender?

93
00:04:33,051 --> 00:04:34,921
Are you running away?

94
00:04:35,618 --> 00:04:37,361
Don't get us wrong, Captain Wang?

95
00:04:38,265 --> 00:04:40,871
I dug out all the gold bars.

96
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:45,151
It takes more than one lifetime
to use them all.

97
00:04:45,152 --> 00:04:46,235
Let's leave this place.

98
00:04:46,236 --> 00:04:47,841
We will go somewhere faraway.

99
00:04:52,051 --> 00:04:53,140
Handcuff them!

100
00:04:53,141 --> 00:04:54,135
Yes, sir!

101
00:04:56,483 --> 00:04:57,871
Stay still!

102
00:04:59,901 --> 00:05:00,766
Mr. Ma.

103
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:02,424
I knew they'd try to run away from here.

104
00:05:02,425 --> 00:05:05,188
Does this guarantee
a lighter punishment for me?

105
00:05:05,189 --> 00:05:07,188
If you are to perform better,

106
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:09,311
you might be pardoned.

107
00:05:09,807 --> 00:05:11,633
Got it. Someone,

108
00:05:11,691 --> 00:05:13,431
handcuff me too.

109
00:05:13,792 --> 00:05:15,521
Is this good enough?

110
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:20,241
- Take them in.
- Yes, sir.

111
00:05:23,051 --> 00:05:24,361
Get in!

112
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:27,201
Get in!

113
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:29,786
Move!

114
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,121
Quickly!

115
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,466
Commissioner Feng?

116
00:05:43,891 --> 00:05:45,040
Why are you...

117
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:47,720
You...

118
00:05:48,258 --> 00:05:49,641
Wang Gang.

119
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,560
Commissioner Feng!

120
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:55,871
Help!

121
00:06:07,865 --> 00:06:09,580
(A few days later)
This is called karma.

122
00:06:09,581 --> 00:06:11,369
How cruel.

123
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,921
At last, they had it coming.

124
00:06:15,734 --> 00:06:18,157
Heaven has eyes!

125
00:06:20,047 --> 00:06:21,946
Serves them right!

126
00:06:24,403 --> 00:06:27,670
We've put up with them all these years.

127
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:32,368
- Heaven has eyes.
- Indeed.

128
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:38,600
Shall we begin?

129
00:06:43,538 --> 00:06:45,059
Zhao Shanhe

130
00:06:45,167 --> 00:06:46,853
and Zhao Tai

131
00:06:46,854 --> 00:06:52,780
have committed murder,
corpse concealment, and bribery.

132
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,521
They are unpardonable.

133
00:06:54,672 --> 00:06:57,031
This trial is presided
by the Four Military Governors.

134
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:58,711
The convicts are to be executed

135
00:06:59,109 --> 00:07:00,850
by firing squad.

136
00:07:00,851 --> 00:07:05,480
- Great!
- Nice!

137
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:08,046
This day has finally come.

138
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:10,401
Yes, at last.

139
00:07:11,785 --> 00:07:12,991
What?

140
00:07:12,992 --> 00:07:15,137
Well, aren't you...

141
00:07:15,138 --> 00:07:17,537
I just don't want to talk to the Zhaos.

142
00:07:17,538 --> 00:07:18,929
You and

143
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,050
us...

144
00:07:20,051 --> 00:07:22,521
If I had talked to you,
I'd have given myself away.

145
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,871
Why?

146
00:07:23,921 --> 00:07:26,591
- You don't like it when I can speak?
- No... Not at all.

147
00:07:27,371 --> 00:07:28,841
Are you silly?

148
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,720
Execute them!

149
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,631
- They're getting shot.
- Now they're scared.

150
00:07:33,632 --> 00:07:35,031
Hold on!

151
00:07:35,167 --> 00:07:36,529
Mr. Ma.

152
00:07:36,530 --> 00:07:39,369
Could you help us
stitch our heads later?

153
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:40,480
Ma San.

154
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:41,929
We're loaded.

155
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,160
I'll give you money.

156
00:07:43,189 --> 00:07:44,401
Please stitch my head.

157
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:45,944
Deal?

158
00:07:45,945 --> 00:07:48,801
If it were a beheading,
I could manage it.

159
00:07:49,123 --> 00:07:51,495
But this is an execution
by firing squad.

160
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:55,249
You scoundrel!

161
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,401
Execute them!

162
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:01,480
Master.

163
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:03,560
When will you teach me
the head stitching technique?

164
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,921
Execution by firing squad
is the trend now.

165
00:08:06,221 --> 00:08:07,809
What's the use of teaching you that?

166
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:09,809
I just want to find out
whether or not it's genuine.

167
00:08:09,810 --> 00:08:11,170
Is it just some cover-up?

168
00:08:11,171 --> 00:08:12,600
Cover-up?

169
00:08:15,171 --> 00:08:16,969
Here's the thing.

170
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,121
If you manage to master that technique,

171
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:22,871
I will end up becoming a beggar.

172
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:24,322
A beggar?

173
00:08:24,323 --> 00:08:25,841
Think about it.

174
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,440
A beggar?

175
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,521
Wait up, Master.

176
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:36,024
Dear audience,

177
00:08:36,025 --> 00:08:38,880
this marks the end
of Mr. Ma San's story.

178
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,225
The head stitching technique
and the art of summoning spirits

179
00:08:41,225 --> 00:08:43,435
are nothing but fictional.

180
00:08:43,436 --> 00:08:44,897
Well, you must be thinking

181
00:08:44,898 --> 00:08:47,351
that seeing is
not necessarily believing.

182
00:08:47,363 --> 00:08:50,231
Is there anything genuine in this world?

183
00:08:50,561 --> 00:08:52,055
Listen up.

184
00:08:52,069 --> 00:08:54,400
What is genuine is justice.

185
00:08:54,570 --> 00:08:56,720
Walk the right path
and you will be blessed with favors.

186
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,440
Go astray
and you will receive less favors.

187
00:08:58,491 --> 00:09:00,082
Justice will always prevail.

188
00:09:00,083 --> 00:09:01,721
Evil will always be overcome.

189
