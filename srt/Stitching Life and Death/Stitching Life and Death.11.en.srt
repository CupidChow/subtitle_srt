=Episode 11=

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,599
The fox spirit is Qing.

4
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,260
Qing is the fox spirit.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,830
She's the victim of my case.

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,909
Why is there a body here?

7
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:37,039
Did something happen?

8
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,039
Something bad happened.

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,550
Isn't that Master Song?

10
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,550
Master Song,

11
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:45,749
you killed a woman in Cuixiang Brothel.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,839
Killed?

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:48,549
I... I didn't kill anyone.

14
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:50,639
It wasn't me.

15
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,549
I didn't kill her. I really didn't kill anyone.

16
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,229
Qing!

17
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:56,429
My dear girl!

18
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,269
Qing, my dear girl!

19
00:00:58,270 --> 00:00:59,039
Take him away.

20
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:00,109
Qing!

21
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:02,119
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Qing!

22
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:05,989
Mr. Ma, after you helped me,

23
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:08,100
I went to Cuixiang Brothel
to find the old madam.

24
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,029
She said she buried Qing

25
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:12,590
(Fox Fairy Shrine)
at Fox Fairy Shrine where she was found.

26
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:17,590
Afterward, I gathered evidence
of Zhao Tai's crime

27
00:01:17,750 --> 00:01:19,910
and also avenged Miss Qing.

28
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:23,919
(Tomb of Beloved Daughter, Qing)
But I never expected them

29
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,100
to go so far

30
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:27,740
to kill Miss Qing just to frame me.

31
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,029
But that night,

32
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:31,950
it was only you and Miss Qing
in the room.

33
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,389
Do you also think I killed her?

34
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:35,199
Oh, no.

35
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,069
I didn't mean it.

36
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:38,799
Are you stupid?
Use your brain and think.

37
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,029
Who opened the door?

38
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:40,749
Lackey Feng.

39
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,630
You do know his nickname.

40
00:01:42,990 --> 00:01:44,279
Miss Qing was killed,

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:45,389
and Master Son fainted.

42
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:46,740
No one reported this case.

43
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,630
Then how come he showed up
with his men there?

44
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:53,830
Zhao Tai, that scoundrel!

45
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,340
I got it.

46
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,270
Now that the fox spirit has appeared,

47
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:04,630
it's time to get to the bottom of it.

48
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,069
Lucky you.

49
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:07,909
Yeah. I've won quite a lot.

50
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:09,110
Treat us to a meal later.

51
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,310
Mr. Ma,

52
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,060
what brings you here?

53
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:28,110
Come see me later.

54
00:02:28,845 --> 00:02:29,950
He's cute.

55
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:36,470
Isn't this Mr. Ma?

56
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:40,980
I heard something about you today.

57
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,310
So it was true.

58
00:02:43,350 --> 00:02:45,119
I came here...

59
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,909
No need to be shy.

60
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,980
Men will be men.

61
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:51,340
But speaking of which,

62
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,950
you've never visited here before.

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:58,870
You came to Cuixiang Brothel
right after you came back to life.

64
00:02:58,910 --> 00:03:02,150
What a way to start anew.

65
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:06,180
Ma'am,

66
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:08,390
actually I came here...

67
00:03:10,845 --> 00:03:13,189
Could we talk in private?

68
00:03:13,190 --> 00:03:15,180
Understood.

69
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,490
Ladies, your business is here.

70
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:24,182
Mr. Ma,

71
00:03:24,183 --> 00:03:25,750
what do you think?

72
00:03:29,216 --> 00:03:30,728
Please send them away.

73
00:03:30,729 --> 00:03:32,310
You want another batch?

74
00:03:34,343 --> 00:03:35,700
That's not what I mean.

75
00:03:35,703 --> 00:03:36,728
Actually,

76
00:03:36,729 --> 00:03:38,750
I came here for you.

77
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:47,340
Out.

78
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:49,269
Out.

79
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,540
All of you, out.

80
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,870
Sorry for the trouble, ladies.

81
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:56,590
I've been working diligently

82
00:03:56,830 --> 00:04:00,030
in this place for decades.

83
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:03,230
Finally, the man shows up.

84
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:06,230
Mr. Ma, come hither!

85
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:07,629
Ma'am, what's wrong with you?

86
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:10,399
Mr. Ma, aren't you here for me?

87
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,759
You misunderstood me, ma'am.

88
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,980
This is a misunderstanding.

89
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,190
I came here

90
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:19,500
to ask about Miss Qing.

91
00:04:28,630 --> 00:04:29,790
Ma'am.

92
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,190
Do you think Song Yuan killed Qing?

93
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,070
Who else could it be?

94
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,700
Qing was a fine girl.

95
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,420
Everyone loved her.

96
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,220
Many men were smitten with her,

97
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,100
but I stopped them.

98
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,910
After all, I saw her as my own daughter.

99
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,750
Could you tell me in detail
what happened?

100
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,420
Qing has rested in peace,

101
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:06,030
and Song Yuan has been arrested.

102
00:05:06,809 --> 00:05:08,660
What more is there to talk about?

103
00:05:08,743 --> 00:05:10,150
You have to,

104
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,590
for the sake of Master Song's innocence.

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:16,790
Actually, Master Song didn't kill Qing.

106
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,959
If we let this go,

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,349
he'll have to carry this blame
for the rest of his life,

108
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,870
and Qing's death will remain unjust.

109
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:27,030
More importantly,

110
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,589
the real murderer will be at large.

111
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,820
More innocent lives will be killed.

112
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,309
Ma'am,

113
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:36,540
I believe

114
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,380
you don't want to see Miss Qing

115
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,190
die an unjust death.

116
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,910
Eighteen years ago,

117
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,030
I was a noble lady.

118
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,870
It's a shame that I met the wrong man.

119
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,700
I got pregnant by accident,

120
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:03,940
so I went to a neighboring county
to secretly abort the baby.

121
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,029
On my way back,

122
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:13,350
(Fox Fairy Shrine)
I passed by the Fox Fairy Shrine.

123
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,070
I lost my own child, after all.

124
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,750
I begged Fox Fairy to pardon me.

125
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:29,910
Right at this moment...

126
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:41,749
The moment I held the baby in my arms,

127
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:44,540
she smiled at me.

128
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,630
I saw it as fate,

129
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:54,150
so I took her home.

130
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,799
For this child,

131
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,940
I was chased out of the family.

132
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,190
Later,

133
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:06,420
to make a living...

134
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,910
Qing was an intelligent girl.

135
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,540
She was gifted in dancing.

136
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,749
Bravo!

137
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,349
What a graceful dance!

138
00:08:13,350 --> 00:08:14,309
Graceful.

139
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:15,309
It was beautiful.

140
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:16,940
Qing danced so well.

141
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:20,030
She has a fox birthmark on her.

142
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:21,940
Could she be the reincarnation
of the fox fairy?

143
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,470
Fox Fairy?

144
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,380
Doesn't that mean a fox spirit?

145
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,839
I'm not a fox spirit.

146
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,119
Oh dear, my girl.

147
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,029
A fox spirit is a beautiful
but bad creature.

148
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,349
When we call you a fox fairy,

149
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,700
it means you're beautiful.

150
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:47,790
Although she grew up
in a place like this,

151
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,150
where fleeting and insincere romances

152
00:08:51,350 --> 00:08:52,990
happened every day,

153
00:08:53,800 --> 00:08:57,820
Qing remained pure

154
00:08:58,150 --> 00:08:59,990
for love.

155
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:03,180
Two months ago,

156
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:09,620
a well-off young master
returned from studying abroad.
