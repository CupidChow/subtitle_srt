=Episode 19=

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,790
Zhao Tai.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,350
I will save you.

5
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,864
Partly because of Ping'an County,

6
00:00:19,865 --> 00:00:21,319
and partly because your father

7
00:00:21,320 --> 00:00:23,038
still has a shred of love for you.

8
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,309
But I'm afraid
this will lower my moral credits.

9
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,109
So you'll help me?

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:33,509
Father.

11
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,470
Mr. Ma has agreed to help.

12
00:00:36,738 --> 00:00:38,140
Mr. Ma.

13
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:40,817
A father's fault lies in failing
to teach his child.

14
00:00:40,818 --> 00:00:42,664
As his father,

15
00:00:42,665 --> 00:00:45,700
I cannot shirk the responsibility
for the mistakes he made.

16
00:00:45,734 --> 00:00:47,442
If you need anything,

17
00:00:47,443 --> 00:00:49,180
just say the word.

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,820
Mr. Zhao caused
the death of the fox fairy,

19
00:00:53,080 --> 00:00:55,590
so he must construct
a golden statue for her.

20
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:57,880
A golden statue?

21
00:00:58,610 --> 00:00:59,360
Father!

22
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:01,750
I'll do anything.

23
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:05,360
Good. Then get everything ready.

24
00:01:05,770 --> 00:01:06,590
Of course.

25
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:09,230
Don't forget the proper documentation.

26
00:01:09,509 --> 00:01:10,830
Do not repeat your mistakes.

27
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:29,830
Father.

28
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:34,053
Who would've thought
you hid so many gold bars here?

29
00:01:34,054 --> 00:01:34,960
Tai,

30
00:01:35,138 --> 00:01:37,662
what you see is only
the tip of the iceberg.

31
00:01:39,058 --> 00:01:41,037
Do you know what

32
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,588
the people of Ping'an County call me?

33
00:01:43,589 --> 00:01:44,760
Ping'an County's Heshen.

34
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:47,969
That's why,
as long as money can solve the problem,

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,720
I've never been worried.

36
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,780
But

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,639
I must give you
an important piece of advice.

38
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,820
Tai,

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,420
if you survive this ordeal

40
00:01:59,647 --> 00:02:01,069
and meet a girl

41
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:03,839
who truly loves you again,

42
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,380
you must not let her down.

43
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,279
Because true love in this world

44
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,669
is something

45
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:13,350
no amount of money can buy.

46
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:16,630
Just like how

47
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:19,990
your mother loved me back then.

48
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,940
San,

49
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,660
I love you.

50
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,990
If I had to add a deadline to that love,

51
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,550
I'd say

52
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:36,300
10,000 years.

53
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,460
Tai...

54
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:43,726
You brat!

55
00:02:43,727 --> 00:02:45,566
I wasn't finished!

56
00:02:45,567 --> 00:02:48,970
(Fox Fairy Shrine)

57
00:02:49,225 --> 00:02:50,430
Be careful.

58
00:02:50,723 --> 00:02:52,020
Do it properly.

59
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:52,839
Yes.

60
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:53,790
All right.

61
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,660
Hurry.

62
00:02:56,047 --> 00:02:56,853
Faster.

63
00:02:56,854 --> 00:02:58,270
Speed up!

64
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:02,399
Make sure everything is in place.

65
00:03:02,789 --> 00:03:05,100
- I think that'll do.
- All right.

66
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,820
Magistrate Zhao.

67
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:11,070
You really are

68
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,910
the Heshen of Ping'an County.

69
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:15,350
Mr. He.

70
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,230
Magistrate Zhao.

71
00:03:18,527 --> 00:03:19,675
Everything is arranged.

72
00:03:19,676 --> 00:03:21,550
Why did you have to tell them?

73
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:24,460
You really know
how to add to my troubles!

74
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:27,229
Mr. Ma.

75
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:27,869
Will...

76
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:29,220
Will this do?

77
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:35,924
That depends on how sincere your son is.

78
00:03:36,301 --> 00:03:37,109
Mr. Ma,

79
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:38,790
please don't jest.

80
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:43,070
Tai, we can't afford to slip up.

81
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:46,710
Since the fox fairy truly loves you,

82
00:03:47,458 --> 00:03:49,910
we have to win her back
with genuine sincerity.

83
00:04:30,236 --> 00:04:31,689
Qing.

84
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:32,366
Is that you,

85
00:04:32,367 --> 00:04:33,568
Qing?

86
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,755
You know me, Mr. Zhao?

87
00:04:35,756 --> 00:04:37,630
Yes! I'm...

88
00:04:42,149 --> 00:04:43,830
I'm Mr. Zhou.

89
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:49,910
I disguised myself as Mr. Zhou.

90
00:04:54,425 --> 00:04:56,484
So you finally admit it!

91
00:04:56,636 --> 00:05:00,322
You pretended to be Mr. Zhou, used me,

92
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:03,088
deceived me, and hurt me!

93
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:09,830
Do you have any idea
how disappointed I am?

94
00:05:10,309 --> 00:05:11,653
How hurt I am?

95
00:05:11,654 --> 00:05:13,311
I do! I do...

96
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:15,630
I regret everything.

97
00:05:15,967 --> 00:05:17,510
Because

98
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:23,420
I once had true love
right in front of me,

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,190
but I didn't know how to cherish it.

100
00:05:32,630 --> 00:05:34,980
I'm so touched...

101
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:39,740
That's what I said to Tai's mother too...

102
00:05:43,029 --> 00:05:44,830
Qing, look.

103
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:47,070
I've reconstructed your golden statue.

104
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,980
I hope you can forgive me.

105
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,630
Miss Qing,

106
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:54,110
Mr. Zhao has rebuilt your golden statue.

107
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:59,300
Everything between you two
is now on record as well.

108
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:02,630
He has not made any attempts
of deceit this time.

109
00:06:03,567 --> 00:06:04,359
Yes.

110
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,390
It's true.

111
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:25,230
Mr. Ma.

112
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,670
What happens next?

113
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:31,490
(Mountain God Temple)

114
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,460
You're guilty too.

115
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,110
You're to blame as well!

116
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:10,390
You're to blame as well!

117
00:07:21,341 --> 00:07:22,700
Don't come after me!

118
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,753
I was just doing my job!

119
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,879
You said you didn't tell Master Song,

120
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,140
did you?

121
00:07:47,138 --> 00:07:48,540
Mr. Liu.

122
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:56,722
They've all been sent back?

123
00:07:56,723 --> 00:07:59,529
Yes.
I told that craftsman to go back first.

124
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:02,109
He agreed to come if we need him again.

125
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,230
The document is with Mr. Song now.

126
00:08:05,312 --> 00:08:06,790
Excellent.

127
00:08:06,905 --> 00:08:10,460
Next, I'd like to trouble you
to invite someone.

128
00:08:10,461 --> 00:08:11,573
At your service.

129
00:08:11,574 --> 00:08:13,140
I will complete the mission.

130
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:15,240
A polite invitation
or a strong-arm request?

131
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,280
Politely.

132
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,669
In a civil manner, please...

133
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,790
Got it.

134
00:08:20,643 --> 00:08:22,606
After this is done,

135
00:08:22,607 --> 00:08:24,670
you can go back to prison.

136
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:25,670
Really?

137
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:26,789
Yes...

138
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:29,188
I... I'm a man of my word.

139
00:08:29,189 --> 00:08:30,670
I assure you.

140
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,510
It's finally over.

141
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:34,279
Master...

142
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:37,270
It's a dangerous world out here indeed.
