00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:11,980
=Episode 20=

3
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,084
My fellow ancestors.

4
00:00:26,474 --> 00:00:28,975
Thank you for blessing my son.

5
00:00:28,976 --> 00:00:31,644
I will definitely
keep an eye on him after this.

6
00:00:31,645 --> 00:00:34,022
Juan, if you can hear me,

7
00:00:34,023 --> 00:00:36,248
please talk some sense into that brat
in his dream.

8
00:00:36,249 --> 00:00:38,950
(Spirit Tablet of Beloved Wife, Song Juan)
Tell him to take pity on me

9
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:41,982
and stop causing trouble.

10
00:00:41,983 --> 00:00:44,054
Deal, Juan?

11
00:00:47,104 --> 00:00:49,054
Let me out!

12
00:00:49,264 --> 00:00:50,502
I made it out alive!

13
00:00:50,503 --> 00:00:52,454
Isn't that worth celebrating?

14
00:00:54,394 --> 00:00:57,266
Can you stop it, Mr. Zhao?

15
00:00:57,267 --> 00:00:58,462
Magistrate Zhao told us

16
00:00:58,463 --> 00:01:00,214
to keep an eye on you.

17
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:04,054
But this is illegal detainment.

18
00:01:04,867 --> 00:01:06,142
Like Magistrate Zhao said,

19
00:01:06,143 --> 00:01:08,343
as long as you stay in here,

20
00:01:08,344 --> 00:01:11,093
you may ask for anything.

21
00:01:16,089 --> 00:01:16,943
Anything?

22
00:01:16,944 --> 00:01:17,934
That's right.

23
00:01:18,809 --> 00:01:20,263
I want to eat.

24
00:01:20,264 --> 00:01:21,742
I want to drink.

25
00:01:21,743 --> 00:01:23,733
I want to watch dance performances!

26
00:01:25,103 --> 00:01:26,294
I'll see to that.

27
00:01:46,423 --> 00:01:48,574
How are you finding it, Mr. Zhao?

28
00:02:24,002 --> 00:02:25,294
Mr. Zhao.

29
00:02:27,664 --> 00:02:28,613
Bravo!

30
00:02:30,464 --> 00:02:31,613
Drink up.

31
00:02:33,024 --> 00:02:34,253
Here, Mr. Zhao.

32
00:02:35,980 --> 00:02:37,124
Well, Feng Wu,

33
00:02:37,136 --> 00:02:39,094
whose idea is this?

34
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:41,404
Well, well.

35
00:02:42,918 --> 00:02:44,174
He's happy now.

36
00:02:45,856 --> 00:02:47,244
Come.

37
00:02:47,783 --> 00:02:48,893
Get lost!

38
00:02:50,947 --> 00:02:52,014
Mr. Zhao!

39
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:05,374
Mr. Li from Judicial Office
asked for me.

40
00:03:05,456 --> 00:03:06,932
I wonder what it's about.

41
00:03:06,933 --> 00:03:10,793
Do you mean the one
who presides over Ling'er's case?

42
00:03:10,794 --> 00:03:12,214
Yes.

43
00:03:13,903 --> 00:03:16,094
I came to...

44
00:03:18,703 --> 00:03:20,693
Are you afraid something bad
will happen to you?

45
00:03:21,602 --> 00:03:23,124
If that happens,

46
00:03:23,343 --> 00:03:26,622
I will be counting on you, Mr. Ma.

47
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:28,008
Mr. Song.

48
00:03:28,009 --> 00:03:30,655
Don't be dispirited.

49
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:32,815
It's about time.

50
00:03:32,816 --> 00:03:33,768
Rest assured,

51
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:36,094
I will find us more testimonies.

52
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:52,219
You helped Zhao Tai
with framing Song Yuan,

53
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,734
right?

54
00:03:55,263 --> 00:03:56,294
Right?

55
00:04:00,227 --> 00:04:01,070
Look.

56
00:04:01,071 --> 00:04:02,454
His mouth.

57
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:04,684
He can't speak with that in his mouth.

58
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:08,484
I got worked up.

59
00:04:08,623 --> 00:04:10,493
I admit I got worked up just now.

60
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,073
That's right.

61
00:04:14,074 --> 00:04:16,030
It's me. I admit it.

62
00:04:16,031 --> 00:04:17,854
Just get rid of me already.

63
00:04:18,082 --> 00:04:20,534
Yes, he's good now.

64
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:26,134
Forget about it.

65
00:04:27,194 --> 00:04:28,294
Mr. Ma.

66
00:04:28,816 --> 00:04:30,374
Since we're done here,

67
00:04:30,423 --> 00:04:32,219
when can I return to the prison?

68
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,822
If it's okay for you,

69
00:04:33,823 --> 00:04:35,393
I can make a move now.

70
00:04:35,394 --> 00:04:36,640
You need not send me there.

71
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,713
Well, I have my car.

72
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:41,281
I'm aware you have a car.

73
00:04:41,282 --> 00:04:43,324
Well, how about tomorrow?

74
00:04:43,325 --> 00:04:45,324
I'll arrange it tomorrow, okay?

75
00:04:57,427 --> 00:04:59,166
Buns!

76
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,534
Hot buns for sale!

77
00:05:03,798 --> 00:05:04,910
Qiu.

78
00:05:04,911 --> 00:05:05,877
Where are you going?

79
00:05:05,878 --> 00:05:07,310
What a coincidence, Deputy Zhang.

80
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:09,414
Master told me
to look for Grand Marshal.

81
00:05:17,223 --> 00:05:18,374
Wait...

82
00:05:19,929 --> 00:05:21,506
(Yin-Yang Tailor Shop)

83
00:05:21,507 --> 00:05:22,880
The military governor came

84
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,164
to discuss something
with Grand Marshal two days ago.

85
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,814
During the meeting...

86
00:05:29,922 --> 00:05:34,004
You do know that Grand Marshal's gun
tend to be malfunctioned.

87
00:05:34,024 --> 00:05:34,422
Indeed.

88
00:05:34,423 --> 00:05:37,613
And he ended up shooting
the military governor dead.

89
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:41,724
He was sent back here

90
00:05:42,518 --> 00:05:45,414
after being beaten to a pulp.

91
00:05:48,569 --> 00:05:50,604
From now on,

92
00:05:50,998 --> 00:05:53,974
we can no longer hear from him.

93
00:05:56,744 --> 00:05:59,534
Oh, sir!

94
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,974
I've done you wrong!

95
00:06:02,227 --> 00:06:05,244
I should've done a better job
at picking your peach.

96
00:06:05,245 --> 00:06:08,534
And you ended up
with a three-day diarrhea.

97
00:06:14,184 --> 00:06:16,374
Farewell.

98
00:06:17,584 --> 00:06:18,623
Oh, right, Mr. Ma.

99
00:06:18,624 --> 00:06:20,974
Is there anything I can help you with?

100
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,974
I'm in charge of here now.

101
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:28,110
Thank you, Deputy Zhang.

102
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,214
No.

103
00:06:29,354 --> 00:06:30,519
It's Grand Marshal Zhang.

104
00:06:31,442 --> 00:06:33,044
Don't mention it.

105
00:06:42,184 --> 00:06:43,296
Feng Wu abused his power

106
00:06:43,296 --> 00:06:45,343
as the commissioner
of Ping'an County Police Station,

107
00:06:45,344 --> 00:06:48,222
to aid an inmate with his prison break
on the excuse of an interrogation.

108
00:06:48,223 --> 00:06:49,173
Take him away!

109
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:49,942
Wait...

110
00:06:49,943 --> 00:06:50,533
Have you...

111
00:06:50,534 --> 00:06:51,513
Have you got it right?

112
00:06:51,514 --> 00:06:51,732
Move!

113
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:53,414
Have you got it right?

114
00:06:54,009 --> 00:06:55,743
- Who's that?
- Isn't that Commissioner Feng?

115
00:06:55,744 --> 00:06:57,053
Why are they arresting him?

116
00:06:57,463 --> 00:06:59,262
All the evil deeds
he's done all this time.

117
00:06:59,263 --> 00:07:00,800
- Serves him right.
- He had it coming.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,934
- This is karma.
- Exactly.

119
00:07:06,624 --> 00:07:07,583
- Open up.
- Yes.

120
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:09,102
- Gently.
- Isn't this Commissioner Feng?

121
00:07:09,103 --> 00:07:10,480
- Be gentle.
- What a rare guest.

122
00:07:11,464 --> 00:07:12,863
He'll be staying here with us.

123
00:07:12,864 --> 00:07:14,382
Yes, we're now prison mates.

124
00:07:14,383 --> 00:07:15,934
They've finally got you.

125
00:07:16,184 --> 00:07:17,695
Is this a mistake?

126
00:07:17,696 --> 00:07:20,814
Grand Marshal Zhang told us
to keep an eye on him.

127
00:07:20,864 --> 00:07:21,934
Yes, sir.

128
00:07:22,082 --> 00:07:23,273
Do you hear that?

129
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:24,903
Don't try to cause a scene here.

130
00:07:24,904 --> 00:07:26,293
Rest assured, sir.

131
00:07:26,864 --> 00:07:29,239
I will make sure he's well treated here.

132
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:32,604
You are certainly good
at reading the room.

133
00:07:34,064 --> 00:07:35,013
Don't go!

134
00:07:37,423 --> 00:07:38,694
Don't go!

135
00:07:41,423 --> 00:07:42,573
Sir.

136
00:07:44,663 --> 00:07:46,214
It's been a while.

137
00:07:47,663 --> 00:07:49,893
Don't come near me...

138
00:07:50,464 --> 00:07:52,053
Don't... Don't come near me!

139
00:07:53,543 --> 00:07:55,942
Don't... Don't come near me!

140
00:07:55,943 --> 00:07:58,013
Don't come near me...
