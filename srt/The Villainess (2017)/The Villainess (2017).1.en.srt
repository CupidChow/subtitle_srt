CHO Eun-ji

9
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,750
What is it?

10
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:18,793
Who the fuck?

11
00:01:21,833 --> 00:01:22,875
What the?!

12
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,750
Who is it?

13
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,668
Eh?

14
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:41,918
You came alone?

15
00:04:42,793 --> 00:04:44,668
Crazy bitch!

16
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:12,833
You bitch!

17
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:20,625
Hands up!
We'll shoot!

18
00:07:43,793 --> 00:07:45,875
Freeze! Stay right there!

19
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:31,708
THE VILLAINESS

20
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,625
Park and his organization,
whom we've been tracking,

21
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,668
were all eliminated by this woman.

22
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:45,708
Look!

23
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,668
Who's he?

24
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,793
We're still identifying him,

25
00:08:50,668 --> 00:08:53,833
but fortunately, he was
only after the meth.

26
00:08:54,668 --> 00:08:55,668
Meth?

27
00:08:56,708 --> 00:08:59,833
Which means he took them
without knowing anything.

28
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:03,918
So what's the relation
between the girl and him?

29
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,708
We're currently investigating.

30
00:09:09,543 --> 00:09:11,668
Secure the hard drive
no matter what!

31
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,708
If that leaks,
it'll be a bloodbath!

32
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,875
And that girl...

33
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,625
She could be an asset.

34
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:24,793
No?

35
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,750
Sook-hee, wake up!

36
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,625
Sook-hee! Come back!

37
00:12:27,793 --> 00:12:28,875
Hey, stop!

38
00:12:56,668 --> 00:12:58,750
Hey, rookie!
Stop there!

39
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,875
Is that the new recruit?

40
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,875
She's got some spirit.

41
00:13:18,543 --> 00:13:19,918
You were just like her.

42
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,708
- Untamable.
- Hey! Go easy, okay?

43
00:13:25,793 --> 00:13:27,708
You'll get out in time!

44
00:13:27,793 --> 00:13:29,875
It's getting interesting,
don't try to stop her.

45
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:33,708
Take it easy!

46
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,668
You can't get out anyway!

47
00:13:35,708 --> 00:13:37,543
Do something!

48
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:44,918
Open the door!

49
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,750
To be!

50
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,875
Or not to be!

51
00:13:56,625 --> 00:13:59,708
That bitch is also questionable.

52
00:14:14,668 --> 00:14:16,793
Where's the exit?!

53
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:26,668
I know!
Let me come with you!

54
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,543
This way,
go through here!

55
00:14:50,793 --> 00:14:53,625
What is this place?
Answer me!

56
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,833
There's no time for that,
you have to jump!

57
00:15:00,708 --> 00:15:01,625
What?

58
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,708
Or you can die here.

59
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:19,793
There she is! Stop!

60
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:35,583
Sir.

61
00:15:35,918 --> 00:15:39,625
Chief's charisma is
something else today.

62
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,625
Was she fished
out of the prison?

63
00:15:41,668 --> 00:15:43,708
She took out an entire
gang by herself.

64
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:46,668
The one who'll get
one of us assigned to her?

65
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:50,833
Even if she's good in the sack
and comes with a promotion,

66
00:15:51,543 --> 00:15:52,543
I can't live with her.

67
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,750
Comes with a promotion?

68
00:15:53,793 --> 00:15:55,833
Damn, look at you.

69
00:15:56,668 --> 00:15:58,833
Gonna get a promotion
and be our boss?

70
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,625
Think you're up to it?

71
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,583
Well, I'm good enough
to take on the two of you.

72
00:16:03,668 --> 00:16:05,543
Listen to this prick.

73
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,833
A relationship that comes
with a promotion? It's win-win.

74
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:11,750
They don't hand out
those assignments freely.

75
00:16:11,793 --> 00:16:14,875
There've been many
who've died trying.

76
00:16:15,668 --> 00:16:16,793
She's coming to.

77
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,625
She's cute.

78
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:22,708
She really is.

79
00:16:23,543 --> 00:16:24,875
The plastic surgery went well.

80
00:16:25,543 --> 00:16:27,668
Maybe it was nice
to begin with.

81
00:16:36,625 --> 00:16:40,583
Unidentified Korean-Chinese
Assassin Commits Suicide

82
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:52,583
As of now,
you do not exist.

83
00:16:52,793 --> 00:16:55,583
But we can resurrect you,

84
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:57,708
if you choose to
join our family.

85
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:02,750
I don't want to live,
you should have killed me.

86
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:08,625
Kill me!

87
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,793
Kill you?

88
00:17:12,668 --> 00:17:14,583
You can't die.

89
00:17:17,543 --> 00:17:18,833
What about your family?

90
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,668
Do you think your baby
also wants to die?

91
00:17:26,668 --> 00:17:27,750
Live.

92
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:29,750
Even if only for your baby.

93
00:17:45,543 --> 00:17:46,833
What do you want from me?

94
00:17:48,543 --> 00:17:49,793
To live a normal life.

95
00:17:51,793 --> 00:17:52,793
A normal life?

96
00:17:53,875 --> 00:17:55,668
Give us 10 years,

97
00:17:55,875 --> 00:17:58,793
then you'll earn a
pension and your freedom

98
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:00,875
for the rest of your life.

99
00:18:02,793 --> 00:18:07,750
First, take a personality test
and figure out a vocation.

100
00:18:08,583 --> 00:18:11,583
You'll become a sleeper cell
and carry out missions.

101
00:18:13,668 --> 00:18:14,793
Once more...

102
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:28,708
Wow, it looks nice!

103
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:29,793
Can I try?

104
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,543
Is it weird?

105
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,625
Is there anything you're
good at?

106
00:18:48,668 --> 00:18:50,793
Do you plan on
rotting here for good?

107
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:53,750
Shit!

108
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,668
Where's the exit?!

109
00:18:56,793 --> 00:18:59,793
Tell me, before I kill
Every last one of you!

110
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,543
Go!

111
00:19:02,668 --> 00:19:05,543
Miss! Take me with you!

112
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:07,543
I know where the exit is!

113
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:08,708
Show me!

114
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,875
Follow me!

115
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,750
Why is she using
that lame accent?

116
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:18,793
She's useless.

117
00:19:22,668 --> 00:19:23,708
And you too.

118
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:28,875
With that pretty face,
how about acting?

119
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,793
You killed an innocent man,

120
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:34,793
and even children,
who barely lived!

121
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,543
The scariest thing
in the world is

122
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,668
seeing a body drained of life
by your hands.

123
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,833
These hands!

124
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:45,793
These stains that
won't wash off!

125
00:19:46,833 --> 00:19:50,543
Even should I remove
the flesh, they'd remain!

126
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,625
Go away!

127
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,875
Scent of blood...

128
00:19:56,668 --> 00:19:57,625
Yes,

129
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:02,668
dip this hand.
Wash it.

130
00:20:03,918 --> 00:20:08,708
Flowing water can filter
anything in the world.

131
00:20:10,918 --> 00:20:14,625
River, won't you wash my hands,

132
00:20:15,668 --> 00:20:17,833
and cleanse my vile corpse?

133
00:20:36,918 --> 00:20:38,668
Eun-hye,

134
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:41,668
I'll protect you.

135
00:21:00,543 --> 00:21:01,793
It's okay.

136
00:21:02,668 --> 00:21:03,793
Peekaboo!

137
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,708
Here.

138
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:10,918
Peekaboo!

139
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:27,583
Nice!

140
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,918
Good job.

141
00:21:36,668 --> 00:21:37,543
Stop!

142
00:21:37,583 --> 00:21:38,833
Stop it,
you'll kill her!

143
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:39,875
Kim-sun!

144
00:21:39,918 --> 00:21:42,583
- Fine! Alright!
- Come on!

145
00:21:42,793 --> 00:21:44,875
You've seen blood,
that's enough.

146
00:21:45,543 --> 00:21:46,833
You'll kill her.

147
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:48,708
Yo, Yanbian.

148
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:49,875
I heard you're good
with a sword.

149
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,668
With the baby born,
let's spar.

150
00:21:57,918 --> 00:21:59,625
Why you little!

151
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,750
What the hell?

152
00:22:18,543 --> 00:22:19,668
I'm so scared.

153
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:22,918
Maybe she really
wants a go.

154
00:22:23,875 --> 00:22:26,875
Kim-sun!
Fuck her up too!

155
00:22:58,708 --> 00:23:00,833
Sook-hee's no joke.

156
00:23:00,918 --> 00:23:02,833
Can you handle her?

157
00:23:03,543 --> 00:23:05,875
Hyun-soo's the only
viable option for her.

158
00:23:06,750 --> 00:23:08,668
- Shut it.
- Sorry.

159
00:23:09,543 --> 00:23:12,875
Happy birthday!

160
00:23:13,668 --> 00:23:16,833
Happy birthday!

161
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:20,750
Happy birthday,
dear Eun-hye!

162
00:23:20,875 --> 00:23:23,668
Happy birthday!

163
00:23:32,833 --> 00:23:33,918
Thank you.

164
00:23:35,543 --> 00:23:38,668
You can't let your baby
live a life like yours.

165
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,833
This tattoo...

166
00:23:48,875 --> 00:23:51,918
you won't believe
how much I wanted it.

167
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,793
Now I've become
someone like you.

168
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,625
Can't you tell me,

169
00:24:02,625 --> 00:24:04,625
who killed your father?

170
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:08,708
I'm gonna kill him myself,
I swear.

171
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:12,543
That's the only reason
I've stayed alive.

172
00:24:20,793 --> 00:24:22,543
Sook-hee!

173
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,708
Stay away! Please!

174
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:26,625
Sook-hee!

175
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:27,918
It's all my fault!

176
00:24:28,625 --> 00:24:30,918
Stay back! Please!
Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

177
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:45,793
I told you to stay back!

178
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:10,875
My darling,
I feel terrible.

179
00:25:11,833 --> 00:25:14,918
I wasn't the one
who killed your dad.

180
00:25:18,583 --> 00:25:20,875
What do you mean?

181
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:27,583
We were like brothers,

182
00:25:27,793 --> 00:25:30,750
I couldn't do it
with my own hands.

183
00:25:36,625 --> 00:25:37,668
Check it out.

184
00:28:06,793 --> 00:28:07,793
Begin!

185
00:28:15,833 --> 00:28:18,543
Do you still want to live?

186
00:28:18,668 --> 00:28:20,918
Then kill the girl
before she kills you.

187
00:28:21,668 --> 00:28:23,625
That's the only way
for you to live.

188
00:28:23,668 --> 00:28:25,793
You expect me
to believe that?

189
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:31,625
Begin!

190
00:29:20,583 --> 00:29:22,625
You died for the first time.

191
00:29:23,708 --> 00:29:27,708
Consider yourself dead,
now live for me.

192
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,750
Pay up,
that's $50 each.

193
00:29:48,833 --> 00:29:52,793
That stupid bitch,
all her training's wasted.

194
00:29:54,875 --> 00:29:55,875
Where's my wallet?

195
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,625
Caugh it up.

196
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,708
What's this?

197
00:29:58,793 --> 00:30:01,875
Sook-hee's favorite color,
food, sleeping habits!

198
00:30:02,543 --> 00:30:03,543
Come on! Give it back!

199
00:30:03,583 --> 00:30:04,668
Number of toilet visits.

200
00:30:04,708 --> 00:30:05,833
Look at this guy.

201
00:30:05,918 --> 00:30:07,750
Gunning for that promotion, eh?

202
00:30:07,793 --> 00:30:11,793
I hope you don't get killed
on your first mission.

203
00:30:12,625 --> 00:30:14,708
Why did you say that?
That's bad luck.

204
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:18,625
We're kidding around,
don't get your panties in a knot.

205
00:30:18,875 --> 00:30:20,583
Don't get pissy!

206
00:30:20,708 --> 00:30:21,793
You got a thing for her?

207
00:30:21,875 --> 00:30:24,625
No, it's all about
the promotion.

208
00:30:40,875 --> 00:30:42,583
We're here.

209
00:30:57,793 --> 00:30:59,708
It's your first mission.

210
00:31:00,625 --> 00:31:01,875
If you succeed,
you get out.

211
00:31:02,750 --> 00:31:03,875
Who's the target?

212
00:31:04,875 --> 00:31:07,625
When I receive orders,
I assign them.

213
00:31:07,918 --> 00:31:09,793
And you kill.

214
00:31:10,543 --> 00:31:14,625
Tell me if you're not ready,
others are itching to go.

215
00:33:07,793 --> 00:33:10,750
Sook-hee,
don't ever come out.

216
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:22,583
Is this what you want?

217
00:33:23,583 --> 00:33:24,625
Take it.

218
00:34:20,543 --> 00:34:21,875
Boss!

219
00:37:56,625 --> 00:37:58,708
You know the White Oval
that has been stolen?

220
00:37:58,793 --> 00:37:59,875
White Oval?

221
00:38:00,625 --> 00:38:01,793
This is it.

222
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:05,708
It's a secret.

223
00:38:12,708 --> 00:38:14,543
My baby's up?

224
00:38:16,875 --> 00:38:19,583
Sweetie, isn't it pretty?

225
00:38:19,875 --> 00:38:20,875
What is this?

226
00:38:21,543 --> 00:38:24,793
When you get married,
this'll be my present to you.

227
00:38:24,875 --> 00:38:27,543
I'm so jealous!

228
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,875
Fuck!

229
00:38:33,625 --> 00:38:34,875
Where did he hide it?

230
00:38:36,543 --> 00:38:40,543
I should've asked him
before they killed him.

231
00:38:47,793 --> 00:38:50,543
Where could it be?

232
00:38:51,668 --> 00:38:54,543
Where...

233
00:38:56,625 --> 00:38:58,875
Let me think...

234
00:39:03,543 --> 00:39:06,793
I heard you recently
scored a big one.

235
00:39:06,875 --> 00:39:10,543
Fucking bitch!
Shut your fucking trap!

236
00:39:10,833 --> 00:39:13,875
If that was true,
I wouldn't be in this hell!

237
00:39:14,708 --> 00:39:17,793
Why do you always
ask for more money?

238
00:39:22,543 --> 00:39:23,708
Where are you off to?

239
00:39:23,793 --> 00:39:24,750
Sook-hee!

240
00:39:24,875 --> 00:39:26,833
Sook-hee! Sook-hee!

241
00:39:27,583 --> 00:39:29,543
You bitch! Stop!

242
00:39:29,668 --> 00:39:30,793
Come here!

243
00:39:35,708 --> 00:39:37,583
Goddamn bitch!

244
00:40:25,543 --> 00:40:26,583
Who sent you?

245
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:29,708
How much did he pay you?
I'll pay 5 times!

246
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,750
No, 10 times!

247
00:41:12,875 --> 00:41:13,750
One!

248
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:15,583
Two!

249
00:41:15,793 --> 00:41:17,750
First 5 to reach HQ win!

250
00:41:18,668 --> 00:41:19,708
Run faster!

251
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:21,875
Sook-hee!

252
00:41:25,583 --> 00:41:27,750
You were gonna leave
without a goodbye?

253
00:41:28,583 --> 00:41:29,875
I'll be discharged soon,

254
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,543
so get settled.

255
00:41:32,708 --> 00:41:37,708
You'll see her if she doesn't
die before you leave.

256
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:46,543
When you get out,
call me.

257
00:41:46,875 --> 00:41:48,918
So melodramatic.

258
00:42:07,750 --> 00:42:10,543
It's a dossier on
your new identity.

259
00:42:10,793 --> 00:42:12,875
(Chae Yeon-soo)
Memorize it as if your life is depended on it.

260
00:42:20,543 --> 00:42:21,583
What's this?

261
00:42:21,793 --> 00:42:25,583
It's still a home,
a framed photo is a must.

262
00:42:49,793 --> 00:42:50,793
I'm so sorry.

263
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:52,875
Eun-hye, are you okay?

264
00:42:53,793 --> 00:42:54,833
Were you scared?

265
00:42:59,750 --> 00:43:01,708
Are you moving in today?

266
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,708
Yes.

267
00:43:04,543 --> 00:43:07,708
With the surge in rent,
I looked everywhere,

268
00:43:08,583 --> 00:43:09,625
and ended up here...

269
00:43:09,708 --> 00:43:12,708
But I'm not saying
it's a bad neighborhood.

270
00:43:12,793 --> 00:43:15,793
It's close to a mountain,
fresh air,

271
00:43:16,793 --> 00:43:19,543
and some great people too.

272
00:43:25,543 --> 00:43:26,708
That's pretty.

273
00:43:26,793 --> 00:43:28,543
Who gave it for you?

274
00:43:29,708 --> 00:43:32,833
Sweetie, would you like a candy?

275
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:43,708
Eun-hye, I told you not to
accept things from strangers.

276
00:43:43,793 --> 00:43:45,625
It's an expensive candy.

277
00:43:45,793 --> 00:43:47,625
Doesn't contain much sugar.

278
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:50,543
You can have it.

279
00:43:50,625 --> 00:43:50,833
(should be longer)

280
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:51,875
Let's go.

281
00:43:59,833 --> 00:44:01,668
Sweetie, stay on this side.

282
00:44:01,793 --> 00:44:02,833
Over here.

283
00:44:06,875 --> 00:44:07,918
What is it?

284
00:44:13,708 --> 00:44:14,875
My home...

285
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:18,793
I live here.

286
00:44:27,583 --> 00:44:29,583
Are you in #407?

287
00:44:31,708 --> 00:44:33,625
We're neighbors?

288
00:44:33,793 --> 00:44:35,750
Moving in on the same day too?

289
00:44:36,875 --> 00:44:40,708
Are you moving in
without your husband?

290
00:44:40,875 --> 00:44:42,708
Are you divorced?

291
00:44:43,543 --> 00:44:44,793
Overseas business trip.

292
00:44:45,583 --> 00:44:47,875
Business trip?
On moving day?

293
00:44:48,583 --> 00:44:49,875
That's not right!

294
00:44:50,625 --> 00:44:51,875
Then why are you alone?

295
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:55,668
My wife passed away
a few years ago.

296
00:44:57,750 --> 00:44:59,793
It's okay, you didn't
do it on purpose.

297
00:45:00,750 --> 00:45:01,875
I'm sorry.

298
00:45:02,793 --> 00:45:04,708
Let's go inside.

299
00:45:17,833 --> 00:45:18,833
One moment!

300
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:19,793
Me?

301
00:45:20,625 --> 00:45:21,708
Pizza?

302
00:45:22,625 --> 00:45:23,583
Yes.

303
00:45:27,875 --> 00:45:29,543
Yes?

304
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:36,750
What are you doing?

305
00:45:36,793 --> 00:45:38,583
I paid for that.

306
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:39,625
What for?

307
00:45:39,668 --> 00:45:41,708
Pizza tastes great,

308
00:45:41,793 --> 00:45:43,918
but it's not nutritious
for the kids.

309
00:45:44,625 --> 00:45:49,543
So I was thinking of
making boiled chicken,

310
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:50,875
if you like chicken...

311
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:52,750
Do you like chicken?

312
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:55,833
Good, that wasn't too bad.

313
00:45:56,543 --> 00:45:57,708
We're almost friends.

314
00:46:02,708 --> 00:46:03,668
What is it?

315
00:46:04,583 --> 00:46:06,668
Chief, I need a background check.

316
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:08,543
Background check?

317
00:46:08,750 --> 00:46:11,708
There's a man next door,
something's off.

318
00:46:12,668 --> 00:46:14,833
Okay, I'll look into it.

319
00:46:18,875 --> 00:46:20,583
Jung Hyun-soo

320
00:46:21,543 --> 00:46:22,668
Chief, how was I?

321
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,750
Doesn't it look like
she's into me?

322
00:46:24,875 --> 00:46:27,708
She asked for
your background check.

323
00:46:28,708 --> 00:46:30,543
She did what?

324
00:46:31,543 --> 00:46:33,833
It's because you
came onto her too hard.

325
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,583
This is fieldwork.

326
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:37,793
But she's at my doorstep.

327
00:46:37,875 --> 00:46:41,543
Don't joke around with
background check.

328
00:46:45,625 --> 00:46:46,668
Here.

329
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:50,875
Why do you have this?

330
00:46:51,625 --> 00:46:54,583
Are you from Yanbian?

331
00:46:55,543 --> 00:46:58,750
She was Korean-Chinese.
How did you know?

332
00:46:59,708 --> 00:47:00,708
Nothing.

333
00:47:02,793 --> 00:47:04,918
Since we're neighbors,

334
00:47:05,625 --> 00:47:07,583
can I get your name?

335
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,750
Yeon-soo, Chae Yeon-soo.

336
00:47:12,708 --> 00:47:13,793
I'm a 'soo' too.

337
00:47:13,918 --> 00:47:14,833
Pardon?

338
00:47:15,625 --> 00:47:17,543
Hyun-soo, Jung Hyun-soo.

339
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:19,793
Chae Yeon-soo,
Jung Hyun-soo.

340
00:47:20,793 --> 00:47:23,833
You're Yeon-soo,
I'm Hyun-soo!

341
00:47:23,875 --> 00:47:25,833
2 neighborsoo!

342
00:47:30,750 --> 00:47:33,625
How's chicken soo-p for dinner?

343
00:47:38,625 --> 00:47:42,543
Jung Hyun-soo,
33-year old,

344
00:47:42,708 --> 00:47:45,793
works at Daesung Corp.,
Development team,

345
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:48,668
a widower of 3 years.

346
00:47:48,793 --> 00:47:50,583
Cause of death?

347
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:53,543
Robbery, murder.

348
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,625
What?

349
00:47:54,793 --> 00:47:57,583
She was pregnant at the time.

350
00:47:57,668 --> 00:48:00,625
He took 3 years off
and started working recently,

351
00:48:00,793 --> 00:48:03,750
he sold their home
and moved there.

352
00:48:11,833 --> 00:48:14,543
Does this go to
Hyehwa station?

353
00:48:14,668 --> 00:48:15,875
That's what it says.

354
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:17,708
So it does.

355
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:20,875
I left my wallet at home...

356
00:48:21,543 --> 00:48:23,583
Just hop on,
I won't charge you!

357
00:48:23,625 --> 00:48:24,625
For free?

358
00:48:24,708 --> 00:48:27,793
I need to buy lunch later too...

359
00:48:27,875 --> 00:48:29,833
And take a bus back home.

360
00:48:30,708 --> 00:48:31,625
I should run home.

361
00:48:31,668 --> 00:48:33,668
You can't even borrow
money at work?

362
00:48:33,750 --> 00:48:35,583
No, I'm a loner.

363
00:48:42,875 --> 00:48:44,625
Bye.

364
00:48:52,543 --> 00:48:53,875
- Say bye to mom.
- Bye-bye, mom.

365
00:49:13,875 --> 00:49:15,625
Rock, paper, scissors!

366
00:49:52,833 --> 00:49:54,543
Hyun-soo.

367
00:49:56,668 --> 00:49:58,625
Did you wait for me?

368
00:49:59,918 --> 00:50:00,875
I like it.

369
00:50:01,668 --> 00:50:02,625
What?

370
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,543
I like to wait.

371
00:50:12,875 --> 00:50:14,668
Do you...

372
00:50:15,875 --> 00:50:17,875
like plays?

373
00:50:19,793 --> 00:50:21,625
Wait, are you...

374
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,918
asking me out on a date?

375
00:50:25,708 --> 00:50:28,918
But you're married,
you really shouldn't.

376
00:50:29,625 --> 00:50:30,793
Actually,

377
00:50:30,918 --> 00:50:32,625
I'm in a play.

378
00:50:34,918 --> 00:50:36,833
You're an actress?

379
00:50:37,583 --> 00:50:39,833
No wonder,
you're so pretty.

380
00:50:39,875 --> 00:50:41,625
I'm the lead.

381
00:50:43,583 --> 00:50:44,708
Mommy!

382
00:50:44,793 --> 00:50:46,543
My princess!

383
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,668
How did you know
I was coming?

384
00:50:48,793 --> 00:50:51,750
She said it was time
for you to come home,

385
00:50:51,875 --> 00:50:53,625
she was right on.

386
00:50:53,668 --> 00:50:56,625
Mommy, is he your boyfriend?

387
00:51:20,625 --> 00:51:21,750
Cobalt.

388
00:51:35,543 --> 00:51:39,668
After finding out that you're alive,
I couldn't do anything.

389
00:51:40,833 --> 00:51:44,833
You still haven't
changed a bit.

390
00:51:46,708 --> 00:51:51,543
I can't get it out of my head,
your acting.

391
00:51:52,583 --> 00:51:53,625
Was it bad?

392
00:51:53,708 --> 00:51:57,668
Not at all!
It was good. Really good!

393
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:01,750
It feels like I get to
become a different person,

394
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:03,833
when I'm up on stage.

395
00:52:11,833 --> 00:52:13,750
That tie suits you.

396
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:15,583
Oh... Yeah?

397
00:52:15,875 --> 00:52:18,708
It was a gift from my wife.

398
00:52:19,750 --> 00:52:24,543
My husband has a similar
cobalt necktie.

399
00:52:25,543 --> 00:52:26,793
I gave it to him.

400
00:52:42,583 --> 00:52:43,875
I love this color.

401
00:52:44,875 --> 00:52:49,583
I wanted to tie it myself
on our wedding day.

402
00:52:50,918 --> 00:52:52,750
Alright, boss.

403
00:52:53,833 --> 00:52:56,543
I got work in Seoul,
so I'll head over first.

404
00:52:56,625 --> 00:52:58,543
Good, take care.

405
00:52:58,833 --> 00:53:00,793
You won't stay
for the wedding?

406
00:53:00,875 --> 00:53:02,875
You'll be in Seoul
for your honeymoon.

407
00:53:03,625 --> 00:53:06,583
I'll head over first
and set things up.

408
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:45,583
Mister, look at that!

409
00:53:57,543 --> 00:53:58,625
Not gonna eat?

410
00:53:59,583 --> 00:54:02,708
Let's live a normal life.

411
00:54:09,625 --> 00:54:10,625
Yes?

412
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:13,708
What?

413
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:16,708
I understand.

414
00:54:19,668 --> 00:54:20,833
Something wrong?

415
00:54:21,750 --> 00:54:24,875
Chun-mo's been kidnapped,
go back to the hotel.

416
00:54:25,543 --> 00:54:26,625
I'll come with you.

417
00:54:26,708 --> 00:54:28,543
It's our honeymoon.

418
00:54:28,918 --> 00:54:31,543
Listen to me
and head back.

419
00:55:00,543 --> 00:55:01,543
Yes?

420
00:55:02,708 --> 00:55:06,668
Joong-sang told me
not to tell you.

421
00:55:07,543 --> 00:55:11,793
We tracked your father's
real killer,

422
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,875
and he asked me
to take care of it.

423
00:55:14,750 --> 00:55:17,625
But when I was taken hostage,

424
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:19,708
he tried to rescue me...

425
00:55:19,793 --> 00:55:21,668
Where are they?

426
00:55:22,918 --> 00:55:24,708
Tell me!

427
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:32,625
I had so much fun today.

428
00:55:36,708 --> 00:55:38,708
I know it's wrong,

429
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:46,543
but for a second, I wished
you weren't married.

430
00:56:01,918 --> 00:56:02,875
Mrs. Chae?

431
00:56:03,625 --> 00:56:04,583
Yes, ma'am?

432
00:56:04,668 --> 00:56:05,875
Eun-hye is asleep,

433
00:56:06,543 --> 00:56:08,875
I got a feast to prepare,
I have to go home.

434
00:56:09,583 --> 00:56:12,793
I'm almost there,
could you wait a bit?

435
00:56:14,583 --> 00:56:15,583
Okay.

436
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,543
Sir, could you stop the cab?

437
00:56:18,793 --> 00:56:20,793
There's still a way to go.

438
00:56:22,750 --> 00:56:27,625
It'd be awkward if your babysitter
saw us together again.

439
00:56:30,875 --> 00:56:31,875
Hyun-soo!

440
00:56:32,708 --> 00:56:33,793
Go ahead.

441
00:57:13,833 --> 00:57:15,793
I have something to tell you.

442
00:57:16,918 --> 00:57:18,750
To be honest,

443
00:57:19,543 --> 00:57:21,543
my husband passed away.

444
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,708
I already knew.

445
00:57:25,625 --> 00:57:26,918
But how?

446
00:57:27,793 --> 00:57:32,875
You're an amazing actress,

447
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:36,708
but a terrible liar.

448
00:58:04,543 --> 00:58:04,875
I'm sorry.

449
00:58:05,543 --> 00:58:07,625
No, I'm okay.

450
00:58:43,543 --> 00:58:44,668
Don't answer.

451
00:58:45,793 --> 00:58:48,750
I'm sorry,
it's an urgent call.

452
00:58:55,833 --> 00:58:56,875
Yes?

453
00:59:10,875 --> 00:59:12,875
A colleague got into
an accident,

454
00:59:13,833 --> 00:59:16,543
and is en route
to the hospital.

455
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,583
Hyun-soo.

456
00:59:19,833 --> 00:59:23,668
Could you sleep here
just for tonight?

457
00:59:23,793 --> 00:59:25,833
Eun-hye will be alone.

458
00:59:27,750 --> 00:59:29,875
Don't worry,
be safe.

459
00:59:41,708 --> 00:59:42,750
Sook-hee!

460
00:59:44,543 --> 00:59:44,918
Min-ju!

461
00:59:46,625 --> 00:59:47,708
Why are you here?

462
00:59:47,793 --> 00:59:48,875
Isn't it obvious?

463
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,875
I got my first mission.

464
00:59:52,583 --> 00:59:53,750
Your Southern accent is gone.

465
00:59:53,793 --> 00:59:54,668
Of course.

466
00:59:54,750 --> 00:59:56,875
When I discharge,
I'll be living in Seoul.

467
00:59:57,625 --> 00:59:59,750
Seoul must be
treating you well.

468
01:00:02,583 --> 01:00:03,793
You got a man?

469
01:00:03,833 --> 01:00:05,875
You do, don't you? Tell me!

470
01:00:06,625 --> 01:00:07,625
Of course not.

471
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,750
You can't fool me.

472
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:22,668
Hey.

473
01:00:22,793 --> 01:00:24,708
Why's the mood so weird?

474
01:00:25,668 --> 01:00:26,875
This is all wrong.

475
01:00:27,583 --> 01:00:28,750
I'll undress you.

476
01:00:29,583 --> 01:00:30,543
Very good.

477
01:00:30,708 --> 01:00:33,543
Drinking isn't the only thing
I came here for.

478
01:00:35,833 --> 01:00:36,875
Come here, baby.

479
01:00:37,543 --> 01:00:38,833
Let me feel you.

480
01:00:39,668 --> 01:00:41,543
I think I'm drunk.

481
01:00:41,625 --> 01:00:42,875
What are you doing?

482
01:00:44,543 --> 01:00:45,543
One second.

483
01:00:45,750 --> 01:00:46,668
Why?

484
01:00:46,793 --> 01:00:48,625
Washroom...

485
01:00:50,543 --> 01:00:51,875
Come on,
hurry up.

486
01:00:53,708 --> 01:00:54,833
Continue.

487
01:00:55,750 --> 01:00:57,793
Take that off,
finish undressing.

488
01:01:11,708 --> 01:01:13,625
Did you take my phone?

489
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:18,543
I'll return it,
let her go.

490
01:01:20,750 --> 01:01:23,708
You must've made a copy.

491
01:01:24,583 --> 01:01:25,625
Give it.

492
01:02:07,625 --> 01:02:08,708
Fucking bitch!

493
01:02:19,708 --> 01:02:21,668
Min-ju, are you alright?

494
01:02:59,543 --> 01:03:00,918
Get her to the ER!

495
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:04,668
She lost too much blood!

496
01:03:04,793 --> 01:03:06,625
Flash drive.

497
01:03:08,708 --> 01:03:10,625
- Start hacking.
- Yes, ma'am.

498
01:03:16,708 --> 01:03:17,750
We can't do it here.

499
01:03:17,875 --> 01:03:19,625
Go to the ER!

500
01:03:19,833 --> 01:03:20,918
Let's head back.

501
01:03:22,625 --> 01:03:24,708
Min-ju'll die!
She'll die like this!

502
01:03:24,750 --> 01:03:25,793
And why's that?!

503
01:03:28,793 --> 01:03:32,543
You should've done
your job properly.

504
01:04:29,875 --> 01:04:31,625
Yeon-soo, you okay?

505
01:04:49,583 --> 01:04:51,543
Let it all out.

506
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,625
Choi Chun-mo who emerged
during this op,

507
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:11,833
is known as
a mid-level boss

508
01:05:12,625 --> 01:05:15,708
for a contract killer organization,

509
01:05:15,793 --> 01:05:18,875
and controls over
5 mid-size subsidiaries.

510
01:05:19,625 --> 01:05:21,708
Using data from our hard drive,

511
01:05:21,875 --> 01:05:24,543
Choi became a major player,

512
01:05:24,625 --> 01:05:28,625
and his pawn Sook-hee
was recruited to the agency?

513
01:05:29,708 --> 01:05:31,668
Isn't that fishy?

514
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:33,708
Wait a minute,

515
01:05:33,875 --> 01:05:36,708
then she's been
a double agent?

516
01:05:37,625 --> 01:05:41,543
We've put an agent to watch her,
and there haven't been any issues.

517
01:05:41,875 --> 01:05:47,708
Choi is someone who eliminated
her husband to reach his level.

518
01:05:47,793 --> 01:05:49,708
Enough about his
back story,

519
01:05:49,793 --> 01:05:52,793
we need to catch his
puppet master.

520
01:05:52,875 --> 01:05:56,793
We've received intel that
they'll contact HIN.

521
01:05:56,918 --> 01:05:58,625
We'll move in then.

522
01:05:58,708 --> 01:06:01,543
Why don't we assign her?

523
01:06:08,583 --> 01:06:10,793
Did you make mom cry?

524
01:06:11,708 --> 01:06:13,543
I... didn't...

525
01:06:13,750 --> 01:06:15,793
I consoled her.

526
01:06:16,543 --> 01:06:18,750
What does that mean?

527
01:06:18,875 --> 01:06:20,625
Consoling is,

528
01:06:20,708 --> 01:06:25,543
when you cry,
I say "don't cry."

529
01:06:25,708 --> 01:06:28,750
Can you console mommy?

530
01:06:29,543 --> 01:06:30,543
What do you mean?

531
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:33,543
When mommy cries,

532
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:39,625
you say,
"don't cry, don't cry."

533
01:06:43,793 --> 01:06:45,543
You're up?

534
01:06:45,625 --> 01:06:46,875
Sit down,
food's getting cold.

535
01:06:47,543 --> 01:06:50,750
I'm full,
and sleepy.

536
01:07:03,543 --> 01:07:05,625
Did she bug you?

537
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:06,918
She said,

538
01:07:08,543 --> 01:07:10,750
I should console you
whenever you cry.

539
01:07:11,708 --> 01:07:13,583
Can I do that?

540
01:07:14,875 --> 01:07:17,793
The me that you know

541
01:07:19,625 --> 01:07:20,833
isn't the real me.

542
01:07:22,543 --> 01:07:24,668
That's what
I wanted to tell you.

543
01:07:25,543 --> 01:07:26,543
What?

544
01:07:26,875 --> 01:07:30,793
I'm not the person
you think you know.

545
01:07:31,708 --> 01:07:33,583
I'm a terrible person.

546
01:07:33,833 --> 01:07:41,708
But if you're okay with that,
I want to be by your side.

547
01:07:45,708 --> 01:07:46,793
No.

548
01:07:47,750 --> 01:07:53,668
If you knew the real me,
you'd run away.

549
01:07:54,793 --> 01:07:58,833
No matter who you are,
what you're into,

550
01:08:02,543 --> 01:08:04,583
I will never leave your side.

551
01:08:08,583 --> 01:08:10,793
Are you saying
you want to get married?

552
01:08:11,708 --> 01:08:12,833
If I get killed,

553
01:08:13,875 --> 01:08:16,625
Eun-hye will be all alone.

554
01:08:24,793 --> 01:08:27,708
I'll reserve the wedding hall
and hire some guests.

555
01:08:28,668 --> 01:08:29,793
Pardon?

556
01:08:32,543 --> 01:08:33,875
Will you do it yourself?

557
01:08:34,793 --> 01:08:35,875
Endure it.

558
01:08:36,875 --> 01:08:42,543
When she reaches junior high,
you'll live a normal life.

559
01:08:54,750 --> 01:08:58,543
Hyun-soo, we can get married.

560
01:08:59,875 --> 01:09:04,543
You see? I told you
your parents would approve it.

561
01:09:06,750 --> 01:09:12,625
Whatever happens,
let's trust each other.

562
01:09:15,625 --> 01:09:16,833
Yes, I'll do that.

563
01:09:18,793 --> 01:09:20,875
I'll trust you
from here on.

564
01:09:22,793 --> 01:09:27,708
Whatever happens,
I'll trust you.

565
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:30,543
You promise?

566
01:10:07,543 --> 01:10:10,583
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

567
01:10:11,543 --> 01:10:13,708
I heard you were
working in Japan.

568
01:10:14,875 --> 01:10:16,583
Why are you here?

569
01:10:16,875 --> 01:10:19,708
I heard you got Min-ju killed.

570
01:10:22,918 --> 01:10:24,875
You should've
done a better job.

571
01:10:25,625 --> 01:10:27,750
It'd have been nice
to have her here.

572
01:10:41,793 --> 01:10:45,708
A bride shouldn't frown,
put on a smile.

573
01:10:45,875 --> 01:10:48,793
Chief wants me to
send her a selfie.

574
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:50,875
Chief

575
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:56,625
Speak of the devil,
it's the chief.

576
01:10:59,708 --> 01:11:00,833
Yes, chief.

577
01:11:01,583 --> 01:11:02,793
Put Sook-hee on.

578
01:11:05,543 --> 01:11:06,583
For you.

579
01:11:13,833 --> 01:11:14,750
Yes?

580
01:11:14,875 --> 01:11:17,543
Get to the washroom
right away.

581
01:11:21,625 --> 01:11:23,793
There are parts of
PSG-1 in the toilet.

582
01:11:39,833 --> 01:11:43,708
Through the fan,
adjacent building 4th floor.

583
01:11:58,583 --> 01:12:00,668
Snipe the man in sunglasses.

584
01:12:41,875 --> 01:12:43,668
Shoot him!

585
01:12:48,918 --> 01:12:50,583
That man,

586
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:52,543
who is he?

587
01:12:52,583 --> 01:12:55,543
You do not
question the target.

588
01:12:55,668 --> 01:12:57,750
Miss, the ceremony
is about to begin.

589
01:13:41,793 --> 01:13:42,875
Sook-hee!

590
01:13:43,708 --> 01:13:44,708
Sook-hee!

591
01:13:45,543 --> 01:13:46,583
Wait!

592
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:48,793
You'll die if you go in.

593
01:13:48,918 --> 01:13:50,833
He wouldn't have
wanted this.

594
01:13:53,668 --> 01:13:54,918
Without him,

595
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:57,708
I can't go on.

596
01:14:36,708 --> 01:14:37,833
Don't cry.

597
01:14:39,625 --> 01:14:40,875
It's a good day.

598
01:14:50,750 --> 01:14:54,543
How could our dearest Sook-hee
make a mistake like this?

599
01:14:54,625 --> 01:14:54,875
Shut it.

600
01:14:55,543 --> 01:14:56,793
Wrap it up and get out.

601
01:14:57,668 --> 01:14:59,793
Did you bring me in
for this?

602
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:02,875
Take out the target
that she missed.

603
01:15:43,625 --> 01:15:47,750
Doesn't she look familiar?

604
01:15:50,625 --> 01:15:51,793
I'm not sure...

605
01:15:52,708 --> 01:15:53,875
Anything unusual
about her?

606
01:15:54,708 --> 01:15:56,625
Her guests were paid off.

607
01:15:56,708 --> 01:15:57,875
Hired guests?

608
01:15:59,625 --> 01:16:01,875
Boss, maybe it's her
second marriage.

609
01:16:03,708 --> 01:16:06,668
Maybe for him too.

610
01:16:07,543 --> 01:16:09,750
Both sides used hired guests.

611
01:16:14,708 --> 01:16:19,668
You still haven't
changed a bit.

612
01:16:23,625 --> 01:16:24,668
No.

613
01:16:26,708 --> 01:16:28,543
I've changed.

614
01:16:28,625 --> 01:16:30,543
Please trust me once more.

615
01:16:31,668 --> 01:16:33,625
I know one thing for certain.

616
01:16:34,875 --> 01:16:38,708
We cannot exist
in the same space.

617
01:16:45,668 --> 01:16:47,750
So long as you're alive,

618
01:16:50,793 --> 01:16:52,543
I cannot live.

619
01:17:23,793 --> 01:17:24,875
Yeon-soo.

620
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,750
I gotta take this.

621
01:18:24,875 --> 01:18:27,625
Do you recognize me?

622
01:18:28,750 --> 01:18:30,708
Who are you?

623
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,750
You may not know me,

624
01:18:38,543 --> 01:18:40,583
but I know you very well.

625
01:18:42,625 --> 01:18:47,543
People will soon love you,
just as I do.

626
01:18:47,833 --> 01:18:49,875
Could you leave me alone?

627
01:19:02,708 --> 01:19:03,918
Do I offend you?

628
01:19:04,875 --> 01:19:06,833
My husband will be back soon.

629
01:19:08,543 --> 01:19:12,875
Didn't you love someone
more than current husband?

630
01:19:15,833 --> 01:19:21,668
You must know a lot
about actress Chae Yeon-soo.

631
01:19:21,875 --> 01:19:22,833
Yes.

632
01:19:24,625 --> 01:19:25,833
And I wish to know more.

633
01:19:32,875 --> 01:19:38,708
After losing the love
of her life,

634
01:19:41,793 --> 01:19:45,543
she chose the stage
to forget him.

635
01:19:46,625 --> 01:19:51,668
But he comes back
from death and onto the stage.

636
01:19:52,708 --> 01:19:57,543
If she has to kill him
in order to live,

637
01:19:59,543 --> 01:20:01,543
what would you do?

638
01:20:04,833 --> 01:20:06,543
If...

639
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,750
that's the case...

640
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:20,750
it'd be the saddest thing
in the world.

641
01:20:31,668 --> 01:20:32,875
I'm sorry.

642
01:20:36,583 --> 01:20:41,583
I've mistaken you
for a woman I loved.

643
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,583
I'll leave you now.

644
01:21:07,793 --> 01:21:10,668
She's taking it hard
after that mission.

645
01:21:10,708 --> 01:21:12,750
Why'd she make
a mistake like that?

646
01:21:12,833 --> 01:21:15,875
She was ordered to kill
on her wedding day,

647
01:21:16,583 --> 01:21:18,833
who wouldn't
make that mistake?

648
01:21:19,708 --> 01:21:23,750
Don't confuse yourself,
your marriage is your mission.

649
01:21:24,625 --> 01:21:25,750
Who...

650
01:21:27,543 --> 01:21:28,833
was the target?

651
01:22:05,543 --> 01:22:05,875
What?

652
01:22:06,543 --> 01:22:07,625
You alright?

653
01:22:10,833 --> 01:22:11,918
I'm fine.

654
01:22:23,833 --> 01:22:25,543
Mister.

655
01:22:26,583 --> 01:22:27,750
I can't wear...

656
01:22:28,543 --> 01:22:29,875
a bra with this dress,

657
01:22:30,875 --> 01:22:32,708
did you know that?

658
01:22:37,708 --> 01:22:39,918
What did you see
just now?

659
01:22:44,750 --> 01:22:46,583
I sure did.

660
01:23:06,793 --> 01:23:09,583
If you promise
to stay with me,

661
01:23:09,793 --> 01:23:12,543
I'll forget about revenge,

662
01:23:12,793 --> 01:23:15,583
and live a normal life.

663
01:23:16,793 --> 01:23:18,625
Revenge?

664
01:23:20,583 --> 01:23:22,543
Isn't that over?

665
01:23:28,543 --> 01:23:32,543
The one who killed my dad
was someone else.

666
01:23:34,875 --> 01:23:36,750
Who was it?

667
01:23:39,793 --> 01:23:41,668
You met your target.

668
01:23:43,875 --> 01:23:48,708
It was a coincidence.
He was a fan of the play.

669
01:23:52,625 --> 01:23:53,708
A coincidence?

670
01:23:53,750 --> 01:23:55,875
Was failing the mission
a coincidence too?

671
01:23:56,875 --> 01:23:59,750
Don't forget what
you're living for.

672
01:24:00,583 --> 01:24:02,543
Once you forget that,

673
01:24:02,708 --> 01:24:06,793
you and your family
will be wiped away.

674
01:24:11,793 --> 01:24:13,875
Are you threatening me?

675
01:24:15,875 --> 01:24:18,583
No, I'm advising you.

676
01:25:01,918 --> 01:25:02,833
What is it?

677
01:25:03,543 --> 01:25:04,793
From a fan.

678
01:25:12,625 --> 01:25:13,793
Your greatest fan...

679
01:25:19,583 --> 01:25:20,708
What is it?

680
01:25:23,625 --> 01:25:24,625
Where are you going?

681
01:25:24,708 --> 01:25:25,875
I'm a guest actress.

682
01:25:26,625 --> 01:25:27,833
And also your understudy.

683
01:26:12,793 --> 01:26:15,543
She was ordered to kill
on her wedding day,

684
01:26:15,625 --> 01:26:17,793
who wouldn't
make that mistake?

685
01:26:18,625 --> 01:26:22,668
Don't confuse yourself,
your marriage is your mission.

686
01:26:23,708 --> 01:26:26,750
Who was the target?

687
01:26:30,543 --> 01:26:31,750
Your greatest fan...

688
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:36,543
A woman

689
01:26:37,875 --> 01:26:40,543
is coming to kill you.

690
01:26:51,708 --> 01:26:52,625
Don't move!

691
01:26:52,668 --> 01:26:53,833
Not a single step, assholes!

692
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:54,875
You see this?

693
01:26:55,625 --> 01:26:58,833
If I press this,
we're all dead!

694
01:27:40,543 --> 01:27:42,750
Kim-sun was taken by the target,
stay on Sook-hee.

695
01:27:42,793 --> 01:27:44,750
She could be unpredictable.

696
01:27:45,543 --> 01:27:47,875
Is the target her ex-husband?

697
01:27:48,583 --> 01:27:49,793
Don't dig any deeper!

698
01:27:49,833 --> 01:27:51,875
He must die
for her to live.

699
01:27:55,750 --> 01:27:57,543
Trust me, Hyun-soo.

700
01:27:57,875 --> 01:27:59,793
I'm off to Yanbian.

701
01:28:05,625 --> 01:28:06,875
What are you doing here?

702
01:28:07,875 --> 01:28:11,708
My mother's ill.

703
01:28:11,833 --> 01:28:13,875
I better go
and look after her.

704
01:28:22,750 --> 01:28:26,833
Take care of Eun-hye
while I'm away.

705
01:28:27,543 --> 01:28:29,833
Call me if anything happens.

706
01:28:33,668 --> 01:28:35,543
I doubt anything will happen.

707
01:28:36,543 --> 01:28:40,668
Because you're always
looking after me.

708
01:28:42,833 --> 01:28:44,918
Yeon-soo, I love you.

709
01:29:45,543 --> 01:29:46,708
Sook-hee.

710
01:29:47,875 --> 01:29:49,668
Remember her?

711
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:57,793
Send this.

712
01:30:01,750 --> 01:30:03,875
I wanted you to kill him.

713
01:30:05,583 --> 01:30:06,583
Then,

714
01:30:06,708 --> 01:30:09,625
you'd have lived happily
with your husband and child.

715
01:30:10,543 --> 01:30:12,543
Now you're all in danger.

716
01:30:14,708 --> 01:30:16,875
My husband Jung Hyun-soo.

717
01:30:18,543 --> 01:30:20,750
The agency's lapdog.

718
01:30:21,708 --> 01:30:23,793
How could you belittle me like that?

719
01:30:23,875 --> 01:30:27,625
I asked for your
permission to fucking marry him!

720
01:30:30,543 --> 01:30:31,875
Watch your mouth.

721
01:30:37,668 --> 01:30:39,875
Hostage exchange at midnight,
Dongjin complex rooftop

722
01:30:40,543 --> 01:30:41,668
Jung Hyun-soo

723
01:30:45,625 --> 01:30:46,793
How did it go?

724
01:30:47,793 --> 01:30:49,750
I'll report to you by tomorrow.

725
01:30:50,875 --> 01:30:52,583
Chief,

726
01:30:53,708 --> 01:30:56,793
I can't reach Sook-hee,
is something wrong?

727
01:30:58,918 --> 01:31:00,875
She's sick,
she's at the hospital.

728
01:31:01,543 --> 01:31:02,793
What's wrong?

729
01:31:03,750 --> 01:31:05,543
Is it bad?

730
01:31:07,668 --> 01:31:08,833
Take care of Eun-hye.

731
01:31:08,918 --> 01:31:10,750
Head back home.

732
01:31:19,708 --> 01:31:20,918
Daddy's here!

733
01:31:23,793 --> 01:31:25,583
Daddy!

734
01:31:28,625 --> 01:31:29,875
How's my baby?

735
01:31:31,583 --> 01:31:32,875
Did you miss me?

736
01:31:47,625 --> 01:31:48,708
Are you okay? Sir?

737
01:32:20,793 --> 01:32:21,750
Sook-hee, are you okay?

738
01:32:21,793 --> 01:32:22,750
Mister!

739
01:32:23,625 --> 01:32:26,543
I have to rescue my child.

740
01:32:27,750 --> 01:32:29,668
Okay, we need to move.

741
01:32:34,793 --> 01:32:37,625
I'll go fetch her.

742
01:32:38,543 --> 01:32:41,708
Just in case,
take this with you.

743
01:33:23,708 --> 01:33:24,918
Eun-hye, wake up.

744
01:33:26,708 --> 01:33:27,793
Sweetie, please.

745
01:33:28,668 --> 01:33:29,875
Open your eyes.

746
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:34,708
Baby...

747
01:33:35,793 --> 01:33:36,875
Eun-hye!

748
01:33:38,793 --> 01:33:39,918
Sook-hee...

749
01:33:43,543 --> 01:33:44,625
Who did this?

750
01:33:45,543 --> 01:33:46,625
Who?

751
01:33:49,543 --> 01:33:50,708
Tell me!

752
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:21,668
So this is what you meant

753
01:35:22,793 --> 01:35:24,668
by wiping us away?

754
01:35:25,583 --> 01:35:27,875
You still only believe
what you've seen.

755
01:35:28,625 --> 01:35:31,793
It wasn't us,
don't you get it?

756
01:35:32,708 --> 01:35:33,875
No more lies!

757
01:35:36,583 --> 01:35:38,543
If it wasn't you,

758
01:35:39,668 --> 01:35:42,543
who else would do this?!

759
01:35:55,793 --> 01:35:57,708
Daddy, hurry!

760
01:35:57,875 --> 01:35:59,583
Is it pee-pee?

761
01:35:59,875 --> 01:36:01,793
Let's go!

762
01:36:10,543 --> 01:36:11,543
Eun-hye.

763
01:36:11,793 --> 01:36:12,793
It's okay.

764
01:36:12,918 --> 01:36:14,918
Are you scared?

765
01:36:15,918 --> 01:36:19,543
So how's our reputation in Yanbian?

766
01:36:20,793 --> 01:36:23,625
Did you really have to
do this to Sook-hee?

767
01:36:23,793 --> 01:36:24,875
What else?

768
01:36:25,708 --> 01:36:29,543
Watch her get her revenge
on her father's killer?

769
01:36:29,668 --> 01:36:31,793
She loved Lee Joong-sang.

770
01:36:32,708 --> 01:36:34,750
So he married her,

771
01:36:35,583 --> 01:36:36,833
and even went on a honeymoon.

772
01:36:36,875 --> 01:36:41,583
She should've died then,
just as we had planned.

773
01:36:42,543 --> 01:36:44,875
Now we have to kill
her daughter too.

774
01:36:45,583 --> 01:36:50,543
She's Lee Joong-sang's child.

775
01:37:03,543 --> 01:37:05,543
- Yes, boss.
- Lee Joong-sang!

776
01:37:06,543 --> 01:37:07,583
Lee Joong-sang!

777
01:37:07,708 --> 01:37:08,708
Yes, I understand.

778
01:37:08,833 --> 01:37:10,583
- Yes, sir.
- Lee Joong-sang!

779
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:14,875
No, sir,
it's nothing at all.

780
01:37:15,543 --> 01:37:19,625
Tell him!
Eun-hye's his daughter!

781
01:37:20,793 --> 01:37:21,708
Okay.

782
01:37:28,793 --> 01:37:33,750
Sook-hee was already pregnant
when she arrived at the agency.

783
01:38:07,583 --> 01:38:08,708
I understand.

784
01:38:37,543 --> 01:38:39,583
He said he'll spare you.

785
01:38:40,833 --> 01:38:42,668
Should I do it?

786
01:38:45,875 --> 01:38:47,625
Fine, I'll do it.

787
01:38:48,750 --> 01:38:50,668
Jesus, you're quick.

788
01:38:50,708 --> 01:38:51,833
Hold still.

789
01:38:52,708 --> 01:38:53,708
Alright.

790
01:38:53,875 --> 01:38:54,875
Let's play.

791
01:39:22,583 --> 01:39:23,668
Daddy!

792
01:39:23,793 --> 01:39:24,793
Daddy!

793
01:39:26,543 --> 01:39:27,625
Daddy...

794
01:39:27,708 --> 01:39:28,793
Goddamnit...

795
01:39:28,875 --> 01:39:30,583
Gun, gun.

796
01:39:31,750 --> 01:39:32,833
Gun!

797
01:39:37,708 --> 01:39:39,543
It's all ready.

798
01:39:40,918 --> 01:39:43,875
So you'll spare me?

799
01:39:55,708 --> 01:39:58,708
Daddy, get up!

800
01:39:58,793 --> 01:40:01,668
Daddy, please!

801
01:40:01,875 --> 01:40:03,708
Yes, I can see her.

802
01:40:25,543 --> 01:40:27,583
Why're you doing this to me?

803
01:40:27,793 --> 01:40:29,543
Tell me!

804
01:40:49,708 --> 01:40:53,543
Killing me won't
change anything.

805
01:40:58,625 --> 01:41:03,543
But I wish you two had met
under different circumstances.

806
01:41:29,543 --> 01:41:30,543
Look.

807
01:41:30,750 --> 01:41:31,708
Chief.

808
01:41:32,583 --> 01:41:35,708
Can we get married for real?

809
01:41:36,625 --> 01:41:38,708
Agent Jung,
get your shit together!

810
01:41:38,793 --> 01:41:41,708
Sook-hee is a woman
who could die at any moment.

811
01:41:43,543 --> 01:41:45,543
But I love her.

812
01:41:47,833 --> 01:41:48,918
Sook-hee...

813
01:41:50,918 --> 01:41:54,793
She can't live with blood
on her hands forever.

814
01:41:58,543 --> 01:42:00,875
I didn't want you
to end up like me.

815
01:43:12,793 --> 01:43:13,875
Cease fire!

816
01:43:18,543 --> 01:43:20,708
Go check it out.

817
01:44:47,543 --> 01:44:48,750
Boss, we're out of ammo!

818
01:46:01,668 --> 01:46:02,875
Mister.

819
01:46:04,750 --> 01:46:06,833
Even for a split second,

820
01:46:10,625 --> 01:46:12,793
did you ever love me?

821
01:46:14,918 --> 01:46:17,708
Nothing we can say now,

822
01:46:20,708 --> 01:46:22,668
will change anything.

823
01:46:24,543 --> 01:46:26,668
I need to hear it,

824
01:46:27,625 --> 01:46:29,625
from your mouth.

825
01:46:37,543 --> 01:46:38,793
Sook-hee...

826
01:46:41,750 --> 01:46:42,875
I...

827
01:46:45,793 --> 01:46:47,875
loved you.

828
01:46:49,708 --> 01:46:54,543
But for the crime
of killing your father,

829
01:46:56,625 --> 01:46:58,875
I couldn't love you anymore.

830
01:47:07,625 --> 01:47:09,875
Is that what you
wanted to hear?

831
01:47:16,583 --> 01:47:18,750
You want to believe that.

832
01:47:20,583 --> 01:47:23,750
You can choose to
live on believing that.

833
01:47:31,793 --> 01:47:34,793
How could you do this to me?

834
01:47:38,793 --> 01:47:40,833
I have that privilege.

835
01:47:43,625 --> 01:47:47,875
Because I made you.

836
01:47:52,625 --> 01:47:54,583
Let me show you.

837
01:47:56,875 --> 01:47:59,750
What you made me into.

838
01:49:29,875 --> 01:49:30,793
Boss!

839
01:49:30,875 --> 01:49:33,625
Boss! Cops are on the way!

840
01:49:34,583 --> 01:49:35,708
- Hurry!
- Yes, sir!

841
01:49:35,833 --> 01:49:37,543
Come on!

842
01:49:38,583 --> 01:49:38,918
Hurry!

843
01:49:39,583 --> 01:49:40,583
Get off!

844
01:49:41,793 --> 01:49:43,543
What is it?

845
01:49:43,750 --> 01:49:44,625
Get off now!

846
01:49:44,708 --> 01:49:45,833
Get the hell off!

847
01:49:46,708 --> 01:49:47,793
Boss, hurry!

848
01:49:47,875 --> 01:49:48,875
Hurry up!

849
01:49:52,918 --> 01:49:54,708
Boss isn't here yet!

850
01:49:54,750 --> 01:49:56,543
Boss, please hop on!

851
01:49:59,918 --> 01:50:02,708
Please! Boss!

852
01:50:02,875 --> 01:50:05,583
Boss, come quick!

853
01:50:28,833 --> 01:50:30,543
Are you alright?

854
01:51:39,875 --> 01:51:41,543
What the fuck?!

855
01:51:43,625 --> 01:51:44,668
Get rid of her!

856
01:51:49,583 --> 01:51:50,583
Bitch!

857
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:50,625
Sook-hee...

858
01:56:53,625 --> 01:56:55,666
Why are you shaking?

859
01:56:57,833 --> 01:56:59,666
Pathetic.

860
01:57:03,750 --> 01:57:05,708
Don't be scared.

861
01:57:09,541 --> 01:57:11,541
Don't be scared.

862
01:57:15,833 --> 01:57:17,708
Hit me!

863
01:57:19,625 --> 01:57:20,833
Kill me!

864
01:57:22,833 --> 01:57:24,708
That's when...

865
01:57:27,583 --> 01:57:29,708
it really begins.

866
01:57:33,833 --> 01:57:35,875
The real pain.

867
01:57:39,625 --> 01:57:45,916
Like the day I killed you.

868
01:59:11,583 --> 01:59:15,791
DIRECTOR JUNG Byung-gil

869
02:03:28,666 --> 02:03:32,208
"THE VILLAINESS"
