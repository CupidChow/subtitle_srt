1
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,528
It’s okay, we gotta introduce you to Mom and Dad

2
00:01:07,528 --> 00:01:09,554
sooner or later anyway

3
00:01:18,219 --> 00:01:22,805
Mom, Dad, this is Bao, the guy I told you about

4
00:01:23,334 --> 00:01:25,000
Nice to meet you

5
00:01:25,897 --> 00:01:29,276
I brought a little gift for you guys today

6
00:01:29,276 --> 00:01:31,836
Oh, how thoughtful! Thank you!

7
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,233
Bao, where are you from?

8
00:01:33,233 --> 00:01:34,876
I’m from Thanh Hoa

9
00:01:38,377 --> 00:01:39,375
Khanh

10
00:01:39,728 --> 00:01:40,426
Come down here!

11
00:01:40,426 --> 00:01:42,156
Your sister brought her boyfriend home!

12
00:01:46,312 --> 00:01:50,144
Bao, this is Khanh, my little brother

13
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:51,533
And Khánh, this is Bao

14
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,490
your soon-to-be brother-in-law!

15
00:02:12,513 --> 00:02:16,608
Hi Khanh, I’m Bao, Huyen’s boyfriend

16
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,542
So Bao, what do you do?

17
00:02:23,542 --> 00:02:25,998
Right now I’m just focusing on school

18
00:02:25,998 --> 00:02:28,219
Oh, still young!

19
00:02:28,748 --> 00:02:30,238
Where do you study?

20
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:32,106
I…

21
00:02:35,153 --> 00:02:37,303
I study at the University of Economics.

22
00:02:37,933 --> 00:02:39,762
Oh, that’s where Khanh works!

23
00:02:40,392 --> 00:02:40,892
Khanh

24
00:02:41,651 --> 00:02:42,234
Khanh

25
00:02:43,367 --> 00:02:44,025
Khanh

26
00:02:44,881 --> 00:02:45,667
KHANH

27
00:02:47,084 --> 00:02:47,787
Yeah?

28
00:02:47,787 --> 00:02:48,732
Do you know Bao?

29
00:02:51,528 --> 00:02:55,059
Yeah… we’ve met before

30
00:02:56,520 --> 00:03:00,143
Let me introduce the main teaching assistant for this class

31
00:03:00,143 --> 00:03:01,947
Mr Khanh

32
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:11,729
Hey everyone, I’m Khánh. I’ll be your main TA…

33
00:03:13,334 --> 00:03:15,302
I’m so sorry, I’m late!

34
00:03:16,737 --> 00:03:17,858
AH

35
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:43,726
Thanks

36
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:49,611
Everyone, listen up

37
00:03:49,611 --> 00:03:52,432
from now on, no being late to class

38
00:03:54,397 --> 00:03:56,565
Alright, let’s get into the lesson

39
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,036
Hey, let’s go grab snacks at the canteen

40
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:18,988
What were you just doing?

41
00:04:20,776 --> 00:04:22,343
Just texting a friend

42
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,566
If you were recording or taking pictures of me

43
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,954
delete them now

44
00:04:26,954 --> 00:04:28,839
I told you, I was just texting!

45
00:04:28,839 --> 00:04:32,627
You realize that’s violating privacy, right?

46
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:34,263
Hand me your phone!

47
00:04:34,263 --> 00:04:36,098
No way, why should I?

48
00:04:36,098 --> 00:04:39,891
If there’s no photo of me, I’ll publicly apologize.

49
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,972
But if there is

50
00:04:41,972 --> 00:04:44,838
I’m keeping your phone until the end of class.

51
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:04,477
OMG! He is f**king hot! Total mlem vibes!

52
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:08,084
Damn, go for it, b!tch

53
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:19,638
If I catch you filming or snapping pics again

54
00:05:19,638 --> 00:05:21,868
I’m reporting you to the school

55
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,082
Okay! I’m sorry!

56
00:05:42,293 --> 00:05:44,276
You again!

57
00:05:44,276 --> 00:05:47,704
Hey there, fancy seeing you again, Mr. TA

58
00:05:48,888 --> 00:05:52,943
Getting this much attention from the TA on your first day?

59
00:05:52,943 --> 00:05:54,062
Not a good sign.

60
00:05:54,591 --> 00:05:57,397
I thought getting noticed was a good thing?

61
00:05:57,825 --> 00:05:59,941
If it weren’t the first day

62
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:03,704
I’d already report you to the department office.

63
00:06:04,309 --> 00:06:05,875
Come on!

64
00:06:05,875 --> 00:06:09,087
Just punish me privately, don’t get me kicked out.

65
00:06:09,087 --> 00:06:11,024
Poor me!

66
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:23,745
If I punish you, your legs won’t be able to walk after!

67
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,579
I thought it’d just be copying lines

68
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,177
or something…

69
00:06:35,794 --> 00:06:39,840
How would I know what you’re imagining?

70
00:06:44,787 --> 00:06:45,882
Come in, sir

71
00:06:57,494 --> 00:06:58,347
What are you doing?

72
00:07:03,309 --> 00:07:03,809
Huh?

73
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:08,849
I don’t kiss anyone unless they’re my boyfriend!

74
00:07:10,562 --> 00:07:12,562
Really?

75
00:07:16,796 --> 00:07:18,796
How about this then?

76
00:07:58,014 --> 00:08:00,014
A  sine graph, huh?

77
00:08:03,194 --> 00:08:05,751
Wanna taste??

78
00:08:29,238 --> 00:08:34,362
Let me teach you a little lesson

79
00:08:47,788 --> 00:08:49,788
Wow, right on time!

80
00:08:52,307 --> 00:08:55,000
A perfect 45-minute session with TA Khánh

81
00:09:05,785 --> 00:09:06,990
Hello?

82
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:09,835
Yeah, I’ve got everything ready

83
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,042
see you!

84
00:09:17,112 --> 00:09:19,584
What’s going on? You seem serious.

85
00:09:20,332 --> 00:09:22,264
I’m getting married, Mr. TA.

86
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:23,762
Married?

87
00:09:23,762 --> 00:09:24,503
Yep

88
00:09:26,266 --> 00:09:27,579
Congrats then!

89
00:09:27,579 --> 00:09:28,560
I’m serious!

90
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:31,224
I said congrats, didn’t I

91
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:34,509
Anyway, I’m heading out

92
00:09:35,768 --> 00:09:36,977
Why so quick?

93
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,954
Scared someone will get jealous?

94
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,608
So we’re just a one-night stand, huh?

95
00:09:42,439 --> 00:09:46,459
Can’t we have night two, three, four, five, six, seven?

96
00:09:51,184 --> 00:09:54,907
Poor student like you needs lots of extra tutoring, huh?

97
00:09:56,846 --> 00:09:58,500
All in your hands, sir!

98
00:10:01,709 --> 00:10:03,719
What a small world!

99
00:10:03,719 --> 00:10:05,719
Turns out Bao is a student in Khanh’s class!

100
00:10:07,308 --> 00:10:08,897
How’s Khanh as a TA?

101
00:10:09,854 --> 00:10:10,606
Pretty strict

102
00:10:11,362 --> 00:10:14,626
But he’s always happy to answer student questions

103
00:10:16,918 --> 00:10:20,376
Khanh’s always been a top student.

104
00:10:21,434 --> 00:10:23,882
Even in college, they kept him on as a lecturer

105
00:10:24,376 --> 00:10:26,891
Now he even teaches master’s classes

106
00:10:27,209 --> 00:10:29,085
Yeah, Mr. Khanh is pretty famous

107
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:34,616
So, Bao, what do your parents do?

108
00:10:36,681 --> 00:10:37,451
Um…

109
00:10:39,592 --> 00:10:40,962
I’m an orphan.

110
00:10:49,211 --> 00:10:51,211
Yeah, Bao’s really hardworking.

111
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:53,974
He paid his own way through university

112
00:10:54,251 --> 00:10:55,230
even bought his own place

113
00:10:55,633 --> 00:10:57,724
and he’s doing his master’s too

114
00:10:58,626 --> 00:11:00,756
Wow, so young and already owns a home.

115
00:11:03,174 --> 00:11:05,832
I got lucky with some stock investments.

116
00:11:06,537 --> 00:11:08,956
I’m taking a break now to focus on studying.

117
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:13,022
So young and already so driven

118
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:17,138
Huyen really picked the right guy

119
00:11:32,043 --> 00:11:34,043
Let me check what’s going on

120
00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:38,297
Khanh

121
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,820
Khanh!

122
00:11:43,272 --> 00:11:44,666
You really embarrassed me!

123
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:46,751
You can’t marry this guy.

124
00:11:47,028 --> 00:11:47,785
Why

125
00:11:49,434 --> 00:11:51,083
He’s like 5 or 6 years younger than you!

126
00:11:51,813 --> 00:11:53,092
Oh come on

127
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:56,735
age gaps of 10, 20 years are common these days!

128
00:12:00,564 --> 00:12:03,201
But he doesn’t even have a stable job!

129
00:12:04,234 --> 00:12:05,468
Bao’s got ambition.

130
00:12:05,468 --> 00:12:07,381
You don’t need to worry

131
00:12:07,633 --> 00:12:08,575
That’s right

132
00:12:11,296 --> 00:12:13,423
No need to stress, Mr. Khanh!

133
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,410
At school, he’s Mr. Khánh.

134
00:12:15,762 --> 00:12:17,872
At home, he’s your brother-in-law!

135
00:12:18,124 --> 00:12:19,014
Got it, got it

136
00:12:20,273 --> 00:12:21,930
Huh? Why’s everyone out here?

137
00:12:22,081 --> 00:12:22,581
Tra

138
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:25,878
This is my fiancé!

139
00:12:29,152 --> 00:12:30,925
I heard you were coming today

140
00:12:31,227 --> 00:12:33,251
but I got stuck at work

141
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,000
No worries at all!

142
00:12:36,058 --> 00:12:37,519
Bao, this is Tra.

143
00:12:38,098 --> 00:12:39,389
MY WIFE

144
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:46,204
They got married early last year

145
00:12:46,204 --> 00:12:48,119
right before our grandma passed away

146
00:12:49,454 --> 00:12:51,051
Don’t we make a cute couple?

147
00:12:53,394 --> 00:12:54,512
Yeah
