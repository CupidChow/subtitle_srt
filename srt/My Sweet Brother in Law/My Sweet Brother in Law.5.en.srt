1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,116
Hey, that’s Mr. Khánh!

2
00:01:01,384 --> 00:01:03,409
Did you read the confession post about him?

3
00:01:09,006 --> 00:01:10,784
Can’t believe he’s actually gay.

4
00:01:14,587 --> 00:01:16,741
So good-looking, and still gay!

5
00:01:18,616 --> 00:01:19,605
And he’s married, too!

6
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:31,462
Alo! Principal?

7
00:01:35,444 --> 00:01:37,551
Yes, I’m already at school

8
00:01:42,174 --> 00:01:44,722
Yes, I'm coming now

9
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,185
Bảo! What the hell is going on?

10
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:25,975
This is disgusting.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,921
Gay people are just gross.

12
00:02:39,921 --> 00:02:41,518
A teacher sleeping with his student?

13
00:02:41,518 --> 00:02:42,663
Unbelievable.

14
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:45,141
Why do these people even exist?

15
00:02:45,141 --> 00:02:47,838
Just looking at his face pisses me off!

16
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,115
What a scumbag.

17
00:02:51,863 --> 00:02:55,106
Society should get rid of people like them.

18
00:02:55,327 --> 00:02:58,040
He’s hot but just a homewrecker.

19
00:02:58,381 --> 00:03:00,582
They shouldn’t be allowed to live.

20
00:03:07,577 --> 00:03:09,121
You slutty little fox!

21
00:03:09,285 --> 00:03:11,834
How dare you seduce my husband?

22
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,247
You’re disgusting!

23
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:15,332
Look, everyone

24
00:03:15,332 --> 00:03:16,842
this guy ruined my marriage!

25
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:18,130
He even pretended to be

26
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,306
my sister-in-law’s boyfriend

27
00:03:21,605 --> 00:03:23,451
You joined this class

28
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,924
with a plan from the start, didn’t you?

29
00:03:27,005 --> 00:03:29,228
Please, everyone, I need justice.

30
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:30,983
I’m suffering so much!

31
00:03:31,131 --> 00:03:32,059
Poor lady...

32
00:03:32,207 --> 00:03:33,112
That’s Mr. Khánh!

33
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:40,184
Everyone, they’re holding hands right in front of me!

34
00:03:40,184 --> 00:03:41,991
I can’t take this anymore!

35
00:03:45,449 --> 00:03:47,535
And what about you, Trà?

36
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:50,294
What about your affair?

37
00:03:56,864 --> 00:03:58,602
What are you trying to say?

38
00:03:58,602 --> 00:04:00,846
Don’t think I don’t know

39
00:04:00,846 --> 00:04:04,158
Who was the man that dropped you off the other day?

40
00:04:04,472 --> 00:04:05,999
Just a Grab driver!

41
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,473
A Grab driver, huh?

42
00:04:09,892 --> 00:04:12,005
Trà! Hey Trà!

43
00:04:12,153 --> 00:04:15,293
My Grab’s been waiting all this time!

44
00:04:32,084 --> 00:04:34,227
Let’s find a hotel and get busy hehe.

45
00:04:36,922 --> 00:04:38,751
Tons of them around here hehe.

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,339
Look at this

47
00:05:01,605 --> 00:05:03,920
you were in the hotel with that man

48
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,740
for over an hour

49
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,537
Everyone, look!

50
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,445
You’re lying! You made that up!

51
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:17,911
It’s all my husband’s fault!

52
00:05:17,911 --> 00:05:21,504
What woman can tolerate a year of being ignored?

53
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:24,000
I already know everything.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,502
That man is your ex- boyfriend

55
00:05:26,502 --> 00:05:28,062
You and that guy have been seeing each other

56
00:05:28,062 --> 00:05:29,766
for over a year now.

57
00:05:31,398 --> 00:05:33,212
You didn’t marry Khánh for love

58
00:05:33,212 --> 00:05:34,465
so what was it for?

59
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,072
For money.

60
00:05:50,902 --> 00:05:52,576
So she’s no better herself.

61
00:05:52,576 --> 00:05:54,342
They’re all just messed up.

62
00:05:54,342 --> 00:05:55,787
And she dared to make a scene!

63
00:05:55,787 --> 00:05:56,669
Shame on her

64
00:06:17,338 --> 00:06:18,825
You should go back to school.

65
00:06:20,801 --> 00:06:22,099
I got fired

66
00:06:26,506 --> 00:06:29,344
With a reputation like this

67
00:06:29,344 --> 00:06:31,288
no one’s gonna let me teach again

68
00:06:37,729 --> 00:06:39,401
I’m sorry...

69
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:42,861
It’s my fault you lost your job.

70
00:06:45,306 --> 00:06:47,370
Why are you apologizing?

71
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,824
I chose this on my own

72
00:06:56,255 --> 00:06:58,823
I should be the one saying sorry

73
00:07:00,324 --> 00:07:04,017
I’m sorry you got hurt...

74
00:07:22,112 --> 00:07:23,784
Did it hurt a lot?

75
00:08:00,437 --> 00:08:01,606
I should go

76
00:08:03,958 --> 00:08:06,249
My family knows everything by now.

77
00:08:06,723 --> 00:08:09,368
Want me to come with you?

78
00:08:11,198 --> 00:08:12,375
I’ll handle it

79
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,678
Khanh...

80
00:08:20,645 --> 00:08:22,911
you’ll come back, right?

81
00:08:29,525 --> 00:08:30,448
Uhm

82
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,950
Get out! Now!

83
00:08:52,112 --> 00:08:53,781
Don’t touch me!

84
00:08:53,781 --> 00:08:55,525
I’ll leave on my own

85
00:08:55,957 --> 00:08:59,459
I can’t wait to see how your perfect family falls apart!

86
00:09:03,301 --> 00:09:04,956
Well, well!

87
00:09:04,956 --> 00:09:08,426
The teacher who fell for his brother-in-law!

88
00:09:08,426 --> 00:09:12,097
Just came back from fooling around with him, huh?

89
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,566
Get out of my house, you psycho!

90
00:09:16,566 --> 00:09:19,036
Let go! I’m leaving

91
00:09:21,409 --> 00:09:23,379
I’m sooo happy right now

92
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:28,874
Your parents must be proud

93
00:09:29,081 --> 00:09:31,116
What a blessed family.

94
00:09:47,829 --> 00:09:49,082
Dad, please calm down.

95
00:09:49,082 --> 00:09:51,355
You’ve shamed this whole family!

96
00:09:52,675 --> 00:09:57,195
Khanh, what is this? Did Bao trick you?

97
00:09:59,062 --> 00:10:01,066
I’m sorry, Mom. Dad.

98
00:10:01,066 --> 00:10:03,484
Say it. Say it now!

99
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,812
Dad, it’s not his fault. It’s mine- I'm..

100
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:12,373
Huyen!

101
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:17,780
I don't have a son like you

102
00:10:19,082 --> 00:10:20,916
Get out of this house now

103
00:10:22,953 --> 00:10:25,060
Khanh! Khanh!!

104
00:10:55,066 --> 00:10:58,703
Tomorrow I’ll go to school to pack up my stuff.

105
00:11:03,543 --> 00:11:06,614
I’m going too—to apply for a study break

106
00:11:16,071 --> 00:11:18,949
So... what’s your plan now?

107
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:24,905
I think I’ll go away for a while

108
00:11:27,214 --> 00:11:31,347
Let things cool down at home.

109
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,151
You can stay here. I don’t mind

110
00:11:54,867 --> 00:11:57,620
Wait up, honey! Why so cold?

111
00:11:58,389 --> 00:12:00,432
Say what you need to say

112
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:03,275
Calm down

113
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:07,444
You lost your job, and so did I

114
00:12:07,444 --> 00:12:10,906
People hate you now—same here.

115
00:12:10,906 --> 00:12:13,647
My own family disowned me.

116
00:12:13,647 --> 00:12:15,976
My mom’s in the hospital!

117
00:12:15,976 --> 00:12:20,214
So tell me, how are you gonna pay me back?

118
00:12:22,461 --> 00:12:25,115
You brought this on yourself

119
00:12:25,115 --> 00:12:26,625
If it weren’t for Van Bao

120
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,656
you’d still be smug and satisfied

121
00:12:28,656 --> 00:12:31,332
“Van Bao”? That’s sweet

122
00:12:31,332 --> 00:12:34,153
Maybe I should pay your second wife a visit.

123
00:12:37,588 --> 00:12:44,222
Touch a single hair on his head and I’ll end you!

124
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,595
My life is ruined—all because of you!

125
00:13:54,438 --> 00:13:56,331
Oh my god, that’s Bao from our class!

126
00:13:58,812 --> 00:14:00,387
Someone call an ambulance!

127
00:14:03,514 --> 00:14:04,949
Khanh...

128
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,511
am I gonna die?

129
00:14:11,082 --> 00:14:13,534
No! I’m taking you to the hospital!

130
00:14:13,534 --> 00:14:15,887
We'll go home after, okay?

131
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,514
It hurts so much...

132
00:14:21,005 --> 00:14:24,277
Bao, open your eyes!

133
00:14:25,224 --> 00:14:28,063
If I had a family...

134
00:14:28,063 --> 00:14:32,005
I’d bring you home to meet them.

135
00:14:37,088 --> 00:14:39,460
Bao, look at me!

136
00:14:39,638 --> 00:14:41,599
Please!

137
00:14:42,665 --> 00:14:44,124
BAO! BAO!

138
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:48,099
Somebody call an ambulance!!!

139
00:16:06,315 --> 00:16:08,938
I’ve been calling him but he won’t pick up.

140
00:16:09,086 --> 00:16:10,540
Let him be!

141
00:16:10,747 --> 00:16:12,981
We gave him an education

142
00:16:12,981 --> 00:16:16,404
and he turned out like this—neither man nor woman.

143
00:16:16,747 --> 00:16:18,570
Please calm down.

144
00:16:18,570 --> 00:16:20,797
He’s still Khanh.

145
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:24,385
He’s done so much for this family.

146
00:16:24,799 --> 00:16:26,975
Worked hard, earned money

147
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,266
made us proud

148
00:16:29,681 --> 00:16:32,926
Just because he finally lived as himself...

149
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:34,570
you’re going to cast him out?

150
00:16:34,570 --> 00:16:36,190
I don’t care anymore!

151
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,454
He can live or die—I’m done!

152
00:16:48,267 --> 00:16:51,170
Hello? What?

153
00:16:52,313 --> 00:16:53,854
Someone got stabbed?

154
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:57,781
Which hospital?

155
00:16:58,031 --> 00:16:59,992
Everything ok ?

156
00:17:00,377 --> 00:17:01,691
I don’t know yet.

157
00:17:01,691 --> 00:17:03,280
Are you okay?

158
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:04,967
Were you hurt?

159
00:17:05,766 --> 00:17:07,500
I’m fine.

160
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:10,371
But... he’s not.

161
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:14,081
The one who saved you?

162
00:17:14,081 --> 00:17:15,805
A teacher from the school?

163
00:17:16,220 --> 00:17:18,409
No. He’s... my boyfriend.

164
00:17:33,225 --> 00:17:34,513
Doctor, how is he?

165
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:36,508
Please stay calm

166
00:17:36,508 --> 00:17:37,726
There’s good news and bad news

167
00:17:37,726 --> 00:17:40,478
The good news is—he’s out of danger.

168
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:45,534
And the bad?

169
00:17:59,009 --> 00:18:00,660
It’s sunny today

170
00:18:00,829 --> 00:18:03,988
Perfect weather for a day out.

171
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,064
Has my Bao Bao woken up yet?

172
00:18:22,764 --> 00:18:23,784
Time flies, huh?

173
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:28,320
It’s already been half a year since Huyan and An Nhien moved to Saigon.

174
00:18:32,789 --> 00:18:34,607
Oh, and guess what?

175
00:18:34,607 --> 00:18:37,342
I got a job teaching online

176
00:18:37,460 --> 00:18:39,691
Cool, right?

177
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:54,689
Alright, time to make lunch.

178
00:19:17,323 --> 00:19:19,028
Is Bao home?

179
00:19:19,591 --> 00:19:21,278
Who are you?

180
00:19:21,278 --> 00:19:23,438
The question is—who are you?

181
00:19:23,467 --> 00:19:26,380
Who are you, and why are you looking for Bao?

182
00:19:28,283 --> 00:19:30,295
Nguyen Hai Trung

183
00:19:31,303 --> 00:19:32,258
His ex

184
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:56,253
Thank you all for watching and supporting the series!
MY SWEET BROTHER IN LAW 🙏❤️
