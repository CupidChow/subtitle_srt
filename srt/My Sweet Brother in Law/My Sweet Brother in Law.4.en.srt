1
00:01:08,972 --> 00:01:10,972
Your lovely wife’s calling, teacher!

2
00:01:12,068 --> 00:01:13,164
Just a work text

3
00:01:15,251 --> 00:01:16,313
Why hide it though?

4
00:01:17,438 --> 00:01:19,072
It’s totally normal for a wife to call her husband home

5
00:01:25,374 --> 00:01:26,799
Go ahead, check it.

6
00:01:27,249 --> 00:01:27,893
Why would I

7
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:30,104
Just check

8
00:01:30,554 --> 00:01:31,396
Nope

9
00:01:31,396 --> 00:01:33,333
Come on, check who messaged me.

10
00:01:33,476 --> 00:01:34,344
Nope. Not interested.

11
00:01:34,794 --> 00:01:35,975
You have to

12
00:02:18,396 --> 00:02:19,770
I’m just messing with you

13
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,368
That “no kissing unless we’re dating” rule of yours..

14
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:24,102
...is kinda cute.

15
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,519
My ex was super into kissing

16
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,340
so now I’m just... over it.

17
00:02:31,363 --> 00:02:32,453
Your ex…

18
00:02:32,453 --> 00:02:35,215
...the one you were with for six years?

19
00:02:35,215 --> 00:02:36,914
Why’d you guys break up?

20
00:02:38,714 --> 00:02:39,737
He got married. To a woman.

21
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,813
Oh… well… maybe he had his reasons.

22
00:02:49,558 --> 00:02:52,858
Family pressure, you know?

23
00:02:55,764 --> 00:02:57,850
Then he shouldn’t have started anything to begin with

24
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,414
I hate that kind of cowardly love.

25
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,598
So it’s official? Wedding’s off?

26
00:03:14,846 --> 00:03:18,719
Yeah. Khánh knows everything now.

27
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:21,202
No way we can keep pretending.

28
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:23,410
You think he’ll tell your parents?

29
00:03:23,656 --> 00:03:24,893
I don’t think so

30
00:03:24,893 --> 00:03:27,344
Khánh’s not that kind of guy. He gets it.

31
00:03:29,758 --> 00:03:31,399
So what now?

32
00:03:31,399 --> 00:03:33,658
We’re moving to Saigon.

33
00:03:33,658 --> 00:03:35,093
I’m cool with it

34
00:03:35,093 --> 00:03:37,182
Huyền’s family might not be

35
00:03:37,714 --> 00:03:40,512
but we’ll try to talk them around

36
00:03:42,517 --> 00:03:45,036
Makes sense. But what about work?

37
00:03:46,939 --> 00:03:51,073
We haven’t planned that far. We’ll figure it out.

38
00:03:52,464 --> 00:03:55,538
Alright. Then safe travels

39
00:03:56,704 --> 00:03:58,329
We’re heading out

40
00:03:58,329 --> 00:04:00,002
Flying in three days

41
00:04:00,207 --> 00:04:01,431
See you in Saigon, okay?

42
00:04:02,577 --> 00:04:04,469
I’ll text when I get there.

43
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,368
They came to cancel the wedding

44
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:12,661
They’re heading to Saigon.

45
00:04:18,252 --> 00:04:20,252
So she really decided to go through with it.

46
00:04:21,533 --> 00:04:22,814
Wait—how’d you know?

47
00:04:31,995 --> 00:04:33,539
You were gonna marry Bao

48
00:04:33,539 --> 00:04:34,897
just to keep up appearances?

49
00:04:36,557 --> 00:04:38,439
We were planning to stay married for a bit

50
00:04:38,439 --> 00:04:39,713
then divorce.

51
00:04:40,245 --> 00:04:41,898
Divorce?

52
00:04:42,757 --> 00:04:44,729
You seriously thought that was a good idea?

53
00:04:45,507 --> 00:04:46,739
What about our family?

54
00:04:47,742 --> 00:04:50,097
I… I’m sorry

55
00:04:58,266 --> 00:05:00,172
We already talked about it

56
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,263
Huyền’s calling off the wedding

57
00:05:02,672 --> 00:05:04,205
We’re moving to Saigon

58
00:05:04,819 --> 00:05:06,654
We just hope you won’t say anything to the family.

59
00:05:24,586 --> 00:05:25,251
Fine.

60
00:05:26,847 --> 00:05:28,370
Go to Saigon.

61
00:05:31,337 --> 00:05:33,406
I’ll handle things at home

62
00:05:35,288 --> 00:05:37,929
If anything comes up, call me.

63
00:05:39,095 --> 00:05:40,215
What about you?

64
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,352
I’ll be okay.

65
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:50,291
If you’re not, talk to me, okay?

66
00:05:56,786 --> 00:06:01,045
No wonder your sister said you’re “understanding.”

67
00:06:03,234 --> 00:06:06,009
You look all serious and "dry"

68
00:06:06,295 --> 00:06:07,918
but you’ve got a soft side

69
00:06:09,187 --> 00:06:11,350
"dry" ? Please.

70
00:06:11,350 --> 00:06:14,623
You’re the one who’s dry as hell and need alot of gel :))

71
00:06:15,196 --> 00:06:16,988
Ah! Let go!

72
00:06:17,193 --> 00:06:18,640
I don’t like that! I said no!

73
00:06:21,248 --> 00:06:22,310
Then what do you like?

74
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:24,150
I like… going out.

75
00:07:29,779 --> 00:07:33,140
“I’ve never felt more beautiful than today.”

76
00:07:43,930 --> 00:07:44,980
Why are you still home?

77
00:07:47,456 --> 00:07:50,074
Oh, I forgot to tell you—I quit my job

78
00:07:50,074 --> 00:07:51,339
You what?

79
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:58,404
Crappy pay, toxic boss, annoying coworkers

80
00:07:58,404 --> 00:07:59,592
So I quit

81
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,856
So what now? You’re just staying home?

82
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:05,877
I’m thinking… a month in Europe

83
00:08:05,877 --> 00:08:07,877
A month in Europe

84
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:10,183
Last week you said Japan

85
00:08:10,674 --> 00:08:11,942
Now it’s Europe?

86
00:08:12,372 --> 00:08:14,043
Where’s the money coming from?

87
00:08:14,043 --> 00:08:16,268
From my husband, of course

88
00:08:16,268 --> 00:08:19,279
My money doesn’t grow on trees.

89
00:08:23,187 --> 00:08:25,000
Check the message I just sent.

90
00:08:26,544 --> 00:08:29,612
You might wanna rethink that.

91
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:40,375
YOU—!

92
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:42,991
Where’d you get these photos?

93
00:08:47,124 --> 00:08:49,498
Doesn’t matter

94
00:08:52,035 --> 00:08:55,891
What matters is—do you feel guilty?

95
00:08:58,121 --> 00:09:00,811
You’ve barely touched me for over a year.

96
00:09:01,159 --> 00:09:03,116
I’ve been suspicious for a while.

97
00:09:05,449 --> 00:09:06,358
Drop the act

98
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:11,536
You married me just for the money.

99
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:15,880
And you married me to use me...

100
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,501
...as your damn cover, right?

101
00:09:17,501 --> 00:09:20,580
Those months were just payment for pretending to be your wife?

102
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,735
What do you want?

103
00:09:22,513 --> 00:09:23,949
Half a million dollars

104
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,166
I’ll tell your family I’m working abroad for a year.

105
00:09:30,578 --> 00:09:33,899
After that, I’ll think of something else.

106
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:37,774
Half a million and you still want to “think”?

107
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:39,064
You’re dreaming

108
00:09:39,064 --> 00:09:41,624
With everything your family owns

109
00:09:41,829 --> 00:09:46,559
$500k is generous to this handsome face of yours?

110
00:09:48,298 --> 00:09:53,429
Such a waste it’s not for women

111
00:09:57,051 --> 00:09:59,785
I knew you weren’t a good person

112
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:04,448
but damn, even I didn’t expect this.

113
00:10:12,578 --> 00:10:14,678
You’re not in control anymore

114
00:10:15,578 --> 00:10:18,967
If I don’t see that money hit my account soon

115
00:10:18,967 --> 00:10:21,126
you know what’ll happen

116
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:23,340
A respected university lecturer

117
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:26,131
married just to stay in the closet

118
00:10:26,131 --> 00:10:29,468
hitting on male students

119
00:10:29,468 --> 00:10:32,886
one of whom is your future brother-in-law?

120
00:10:32,886 --> 00:10:38,368
Wonder what your parents, your sister, would think.

121
00:10:40,972 --> 00:10:42,709
Do whatever you want.
