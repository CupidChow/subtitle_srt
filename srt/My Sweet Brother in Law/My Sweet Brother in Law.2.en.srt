1
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,200
Ugh, I shouldn’t have made that trade.

2
00:01:04,367 --> 00:01:06,367
Ngo Van Bao

3
00:01:09,337 --> 00:01:11,357
What’s wrong, TA?

4
00:01:11,357 --> 00:01:11,997
What do you want??

5
00:01:12,376 --> 00:01:13,355
What do you mean “want”?

6
00:01:14,424 --> 00:01:16,044
Stay away from my sister!

7
00:01:16,804 --> 00:01:18,126
Why?

8
00:01:18,886 --> 00:01:19,945
Stop acting

9
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,187
Are you crazy

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Your sister and I truly love each other

11
00:01:26,326 --> 00:01:27,694
we’re even about to get married

12
00:01:28,237 --> 00:01:29,451
This isn’t a joke

13
00:01:31,866 --> 00:01:33,733
Stay away from my sister

14
00:01:34,357 --> 00:01:34,857
or

15
00:01:36,283 --> 00:01:38,334
I’ll tell everyone the truth about you.

16
00:01:38,334 --> 00:01:39,286
The truth??

17
00:01:39,964 --> 00:01:40,464
Proof?

18
00:01:47,057 --> 00:01:49,991
Next time we f*ck

19
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:53,801
You should record it as proof?

20
00:01:55,042 --> 00:01:55,971
YOU

21
00:02:08,112 --> 00:02:09,863
Hi, Mr TA

22
00:02:26,918 --> 00:02:28,384
Let’s make this quick

23
00:02:28,384 --> 00:02:30,085
I’ll give you some money

24
00:02:30,085 --> 00:02:33,131
and you stay the hell away from my sister.

25
00:02:37,798 --> 00:02:40,130
I was kinda shocked last time

26
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:43,225
when I found out you had a wife

27
00:02:43,578 --> 00:02:44,376
but today

28
00:02:44,756 --> 00:02:46,325
Even more shocked

29
00:02:46,325 --> 00:02:48,501
A proper, educated guy like you

30
00:02:48,501 --> 00:02:50,351
but all you talk about is money.

31
00:02:51,789 --> 00:02:53,050
10 000 USD

32
00:02:53,863 --> 00:02:55,209
Too little.

33
00:02:55,969 --> 00:02:56,795
20 000 USD

34
00:02:57,544 --> 00:02:58,044
Forget it!

35
00:02:58,044 --> 00:03:00,194
Shove your damn money

36
00:03:00,492 --> 00:03:02,405
I don’t need that shit!!!

37
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,217
Hey... Hey

38
00:03:08,922 --> 00:03:10,358
Bao...Bao

39
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,730
You’re awake, so get up

40
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,469
No need to keep pretending.

41
00:03:57,554 --> 00:03:59,303
I’m awake, but I’m still tired!

42
00:04:00,931 --> 00:04:02,097
how do you even have

43
00:04:02,097 --> 00:04:03,496
the password to my place

44
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,663
Your birthday

45
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,194
Why do you know that?

46
00:04:09,927 --> 00:04:11,668
What do you think the class roster is for?

47
00:04:12,193 --> 00:04:13,822
You’re pretty slick, teacher?

48
00:04:14,365 --> 00:04:15,555
Just eat

49
00:04:15,555 --> 00:04:17,083
and stop calling me “teacher.”

50
00:04:17,409 --> 00:04:18,409
If I don’t call you “teacher,”

51
00:04:18,409 --> 00:04:19,099
what should I call you?

52
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,369
Call “big bro”!

53
00:04:22,369 --> 00:04:25,846
Or maybe… friends with benefits?

54
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:28,179
Or how about… brother-in-law?

55
00:04:31,462 --> 00:04:35,333
Eat up  I’ve gotta head home

56
00:04:38,075 --> 00:04:39,651
I don’t like onions

57
00:04:39,651 --> 00:04:41,606
next time, leave them out, okay?

58
00:04:42,341 --> 00:04:43,238
If you don’t want them

59
00:04:43,238 --> 00:04:44,134
I’ll gladly take them!

60
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:55,734
How long you been with my sister?

61
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,669
Ugh, asking about that again?

62
00:04:57,859 --> 00:04:59,075
You really think I came to your place

63
00:04:59,482 --> 00:05:00,448
cooked you porridge

64
00:05:00,937 --> 00:05:02,254
waited for you to wake up…

65
00:05:02,254 --> 00:05:03,269
just to leave after that??

66
00:05:03,622 --> 00:05:04,961
I thought my future brother-in-law

67
00:05:04,961 --> 00:05:05,736
was just being nice

68
00:05:05,985 --> 00:05:08,244
turns out you had an agenda all along.

69
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:11,335
You’re not married to my sister yet

70
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:12,835
don’t call me brother-in-law!

71
00:05:12,998 --> 00:05:14,572
That’s how I like it

72
00:05:14,572 --> 00:05:21,754
brother-in-law x100 times

73
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:22,463
Ugh

74
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:29,467
Pretty good! Gimme

75
00:05:43,657 --> 00:05:46,421
Alright class, today we’re doing a survey

76
00:05:46,421 --> 00:05:49,018
Mr. Khánh will hand out the materials.

77
00:05:56,153 --> 00:05:58,153
Bao...Bao

78
00:06:07,513 --> 00:06:09,743
Excuse me, teacher, I need to step out for a bit

79
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:11,743
Ok

80
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,899
Everyone, make sure to go through the materials carefully.

81
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:34,648
Go take a shower, will you?

82
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:43,742
Why’d my sister come see you today?

83
00:06:45,582 --> 00:06:46,958
That’s between me and my wife

84
00:06:47,663 --> 00:06:48,480
you’re so nosy!

85
00:06:48,626 --> 00:06:50,218
You’re not married yet

86
00:06:50,723 --> 00:06:52,976
don’t go calling her “wife” or yourself “husband.”

87
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,830
Okay

88
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,275
Your sister couldn’t reach me

89
00:06:57,275 --> 00:06:59,281
so she came straight to class

90
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:00,249
satisfied now?

91
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:02,604
I took care of you all night yesterday

92
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:04,086
haven’t even been thanked yet

93
00:07:04,927 --> 00:07:06,295
so don’t talk to me with that attitude.

94
00:07:07,588 --> 00:07:09,045
Then what do you think we just did?

95
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:12,242
What just happened… doesn’t count!

96
00:07:12,405 --> 00:07:13,428
Heyyy

97
00:07:17,335 --> 00:07:18,697
Have you..

98
00:07:19,755 --> 00:07:22,271
Have you even kissed my sister yet?

99
00:07:22,868 --> 00:07:23,775
Not yet!

100
00:07:24,209 --> 00:07:25,229
I swear!

101
00:07:25,419 --> 00:07:27,407
If I’m lying, I’m a damn dog!

102
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:32,918
What about that other thing then?!

103
00:07:33,623 --> 00:07:35,623
We’re in a pure

104
00:07:37,712 --> 00:07:38,918
I know that!!

105
00:07:39,461 --> 00:07:41,461
Like you could even pull that off

106
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:50,420
Alo

107
00:07:50,908 --> 00:07:51,507
Where are you right now?

108
00:07:52,185 --> 00:07:53,418
I’m at school .

109
00:07:55,127 --> 00:07:57,286
Do you remember what day it is today?

110
00:07:59,918 --> 00:08:01,104
What day?

111
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:03,891
Today is my birthday

112
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:06,294
Your birtday?

113
00:08:08,872 --> 00:08:12,941
Sorry, I’ve been swamped and totally forgot.

114
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:15,075
I’ll send you your gift later, okay?

115
00:08:16,052 --> 00:08:17,697
So… are you coming home tonight?

116
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,404
Tonight

117
00:08:22,404 --> 00:08:25,079
I’ll probably be out eating with the other teachers

118
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:26,338
so I won’t make it home.

119
00:08:28,807 --> 00:08:30,448
I have to work now

120
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,410
Skipping your wife’s birthday?

121
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,705
That’s seriously messed up, you know.

122
00:08:43,151 --> 00:08:46,813
There’s a lot you just wouldn’t understand.

123
00:09:15,372 --> 00:09:16,353
Alo

124
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:19,596
I’m the family’s big hope

125
00:09:22,716 --> 00:09:25,073
Before Grandpa passed

126
00:09:25,073 --> 00:09:28,532
he wanted to see his grandkids settle down.

127
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,865
Huyền couldn’t do it

128
00:09:33,893 --> 00:09:36,628
so it had to be me.

129
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:40,969
Why put yourself through all that?

130
00:09:44,306 --> 00:09:46,190
You don’t have a family

131
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:47,802
you wouldn’t get it!

132
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:54,209
Oh! I am sorry

133
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,209
I didn’t mean it like that.

134
00:09:56,725 --> 00:09:57,709
It's ok

135
00:09:58,496 --> 00:09:59,415
You’re right

136
00:10:01,097 --> 00:10:03,619
I don’t have a family

137
00:10:03,619 --> 00:10:05,586
so I’ll never understand that kind of pressure

138
00:10:06,210 --> 00:10:07,949
You’re not mad, are you?

139
00:10:10,011 --> 00:10:11,919
Promise me.

140
00:10:12,624 --> 00:10:13,785
You’re such a child.

141
00:10:20,109 --> 00:10:22,329
How many people have you been in love with?

142
00:10:25,449 --> 00:10:26,918
Not a single one.

143
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:30,929
Handsome but picky, huh?

144
00:10:36,382 --> 00:10:38,331
What about you?

145
00:10:43,621 --> 00:10:45,548
One

146
00:10:45,548 --> 00:10:47,154
Six years

147
00:10:47,697 --> 00:10:49,321
We broke up.

148
00:10:50,515 --> 00:10:53,400
Now I just look for hookups to take the edge off.

149
00:11:00,319 --> 00:11:03,785
So, what’s your type?

150
00:11:07,963 --> 00:11:09,489
Tall

151
00:11:09,489 --> 00:11:10,694
big

152
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,799
loves the country  loves Vietnam

153
00:11:12,799 --> 00:11:14,442
that’s all.

154
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,334
Sounds like you’re describing me, huh?

155
00:11:29,299 --> 00:11:32,334
If I become your boyfriend

156
00:11:33,609 --> 00:11:35,823
will you leave my sister?

157
00:11:44,587 --> 00:11:46,011
Just kidding

158
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,759
I’m off to shower.

159
00:13:03,627 --> 00:13:05,627
Bao... Bao... wake up

160
00:13:05,627 --> 00:13:06,765
We’re late for class!

161
00:13:09,234 --> 00:13:10,340
I’m borrowing your shower.

162
00:13:10,747 --> 00:13:12,000
Go ahead

163
00:13:12,402 --> 00:13:14,353
you’re already wearing my clothes anyway.

164
00:13:16,089 --> 00:13:18,341
Wait, I need the bathroom too!

165
00:14:28,034 --> 00:14:29,871
Pretty huh?

166
00:14:29,871 --> 00:14:31,329
This looks nice

167
00:14:31,329 --> 00:14:33,084
This wedding photo style looks pretty good!

168
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:51,819
Sister

169
00:14:52,063 --> 00:14:52,616
Khanh

170
00:14:55,221 --> 00:14:56,599
Huyền and I are going for wedding photos

171
00:14:56,599 --> 00:14:57,543
and then grabbing a bite.

172
00:14:58,502 --> 00:14:59,705
Baby, what do you wanna eat?

173
00:15:01,003 --> 00:15:01,801
I don't know

174
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:03,359
I’m already so chubby!

175
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:04,969
Chubby where? You’re gorgeous!

176
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,668
Khanh, you coming with us?

177
00:15:07,048 --> 00:15:08,286
No, I’m busy.

178
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,769
OMG, such an act!!!
