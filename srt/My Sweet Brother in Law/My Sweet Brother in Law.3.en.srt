1
00:01:00,875 --> 00:01:02,875
What??

2
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:07,647
What is this?

3
00:01:08,231 --> 00:01:09,537
Looks pretty nice, huh

4
00:01:09,537 --> 00:01:10,961
Huyen already posted it?

5
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,359
You trying to piss me off on purpose?

6
00:01:14,426 --> 00:01:15,702
Piss you off?

7
00:01:16,478 --> 00:01:18,956
I'm just taking engagement photos with my fiancée

8
00:01:19,368 --> 00:01:21,368
how is that pissing off my teaching assistant?

9
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:23,155
After everything we've done

10
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:25,160
you still wanna be my brother-in-law?

11
00:01:25,887 --> 00:01:27,703
Done what?

12
00:01:27,968 --> 00:01:29,728
All you ever did was hurt me.

13
00:01:30,843 --> 00:01:31,818
Hurt you??

14
00:01:31,818 --> 00:01:32,655
Uhm

15
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,902
I mean, I kinda liked it

16
00:01:36,193 --> 00:01:38,619
but it did hurt a bit

17
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:39,619
You little --

18
00:01:41,606 --> 00:01:43,767
Look, Huyen's gonna be my wife

19
00:01:44,179 --> 00:01:45,501
And you?

20
00:01:46,083 --> 00:01:47,456
You're not anything to me.

21
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:49,165
Right?

22
00:01:51,177 --> 00:01:55,000
If you marry my sister, I’ll never see you again.

23
00:01:56,672 --> 00:01:59,038
Well, we were just a couple of one-night stands anyway

24
00:01:59,038 --> 00:02:01,379
Not seeing you again is a bit of a bummer

25
00:02:04,215 --> 00:02:07,020
Oh, by the way, wedding's in three months

26
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,527
Better get ready.

27
00:03:09,451 --> 00:03:12,608
Hello? You home?

28
00:03:16,559 --> 00:03:17,885
A MONTH AGO

29
00:03:18,079 --> 00:03:19,126
Damn, you're so pretty!

30
00:03:20,192 --> 00:03:21,188
Well, I am your girlfriend, duh!

31
00:03:30,628 --> 00:03:32,265
Here's some drinks for you two!

32
00:03:32,265 --> 00:03:33,247
Thanks!

33
00:03:35,281 --> 00:03:36,146
Just teasing

34
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:38,512
jealous much?

35
00:03:52,046 --> 00:03:53,083
Have some mango

36
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:54,338
This is Huyen, my girlfriend

37
00:03:54,532 --> 00:03:55,568
you know, the one I always talk about.

38
00:03:56,295 --> 00:03:58,025
Huyen, meet Bao.

39
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:00,000
I know!

40
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,454
You two were best friends in college

41
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:04,220
even roommates for a while, right?

42
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,991
Ugh, you always cuts me off. Told you a million times!

43
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,442
Oops, my bad. Go ahead

44
00:04:13,176 --> 00:04:16,946
Nah, I’m just messing around. You’re adorable

45
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:23,069
Alright you two, spill it—what’s going on?

46
00:04:26,973 --> 00:04:28,769
Tell him, babe

47
00:04:33,689 --> 00:04:35,689
Bảo, we need your help with something.

48
00:04:39,506 --> 00:04:42,048
Shame your sister doesn't know...

49
00:04:42,551 --> 00:04:43,826
what you’re really like

50
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:51,398
You knew everything

51
00:04:52,907 --> 00:04:54,416
Why didn’t you tell me?

52
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,424
How could I?

53
00:04:56,296 --> 00:04:57,593
I promised her

54
00:04:58,576 --> 00:05:00,225
A promise is a matter of honor!

55
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:10,497
Fine! Let’s say you found out on your own.

56
00:05:10,764 --> 00:05:12,580
If we had feelings for each other

57
00:05:12,992 --> 00:05:14,753
would you still marry my sister?

58
00:05:15,238 --> 00:05:17,238
Who’d fall for a married man anyway?

59
00:05:20,132 --> 00:05:21,693
You done with the questions?

60
00:05:22,808 --> 00:05:25,247
I need to go work out.

61
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:31,173
So… when are you leaving my place?

62
00:05:36,408 --> 00:05:36,908
What

63
00:05:47,499 --> 00:05:49,510
Ngo Van Bao

64
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:51,712
you lied to me

65
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,846
and to my whole family

66
00:05:54,403 --> 00:05:57,984
and now you're just pretending like nothing happened?

67
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,364
Uh, wasn’t this your sister's idea?

68
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:06,706
You agreed, so you're an accomplice

69
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:08,533
This offense...

70
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,631
might deserve a pretty harsh punishment.

71
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:17,891
Hey! Don’t play that game!

72
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:20,223
How convenient

73
00:06:20,223 --> 00:06:22,162
you wanna exercise

74
00:06:25,156 --> 00:06:27,156
I wanna punish you

75
00:06:29,846 --> 00:06:31,830
Wait… I’m not ready.

76
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:36,274
You don’t get to be ready or not

77
00:06:46,385 --> 00:06:48,385
Khanh!

78
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,031
Tra

79
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,555
You two came together?

80
00:06:57,633 --> 00:07:00,145
We just ran into each other at the gate

81
00:07:00,145 --> 00:07:01,305
Walked in together

82
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:04,576
Oh right, Huyền said you’re his student

83
00:07:07,414 --> 00:07:08,833
What happened to your hand?

84
00:07:14,092 --> 00:07:17,469
Oh... I’ve been boxing. Wrapped it too tight.

85
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:20,953
Why didn’t you call before coming?

86
00:07:20,953 --> 00:07:23,396
I did! But you never answer

87
00:07:23,396 --> 00:07:25,334
No ringtone, no vibration!

88
00:07:25,334 --> 00:07:28,168
I got off work early so I dropped by

89
00:07:28,386 --> 00:07:31,664
Mom and Dad said we’re having dinner at Uncle Hoàn’s tonight

90
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,561
Come home early, okay?

91
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,370
Got it. I’m heading to class now.

92
00:07:40,721 --> 00:07:41,713
Bao

93
00:07:42,489 --> 00:07:45,541
Have you and Huyen picked a wedding date?

94
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,753
The photos are stunning

95
00:07:47,753 --> 00:07:49,761
unlike mine

96
00:07:49,761 --> 00:07:52,922
Khanh didn’t care so we just rushed through it.

97
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:56,476
We haven’t locked in a date yet

98
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:57,815
Why not?

99
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,721
Still lots to prep

100
00:08:02,508 --> 00:08:06,358
Bao, be honest with me

101
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,716
what do you think of Khanh?

102
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,400
What do you mean?

103
00:08:13,903 --> 00:08:17,800
I mean, since you're Khanh's student

104
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,488
what do you think of him?

105
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,372
He's... alright—no wait—really great

106
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,000
Super dedicated to his students

107
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,843
Lately he’s been acting weird

108
00:08:27,843 --> 00:08:29,786
Leaves early, comes home late

109
00:08:29,786 --> 00:08:31,820
keeps smiling at his phone

110
00:08:32,862 --> 00:08:35,562
I get this weird gut feeling

111
00:08:36,774 --> 00:08:39,530
Can you keep an eye on him for me?

112
00:08:41,445 --> 00:08:42,803
OK! Don't worrry

113
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:43,757
Tra

114
00:08:44,823 --> 00:08:46,781
That’s my ride. He’s been waiting. Gotta go!

115
00:08:47,557 --> 00:08:48,686
See you

116
00:09:00,267 --> 00:09:01,435
Boo

117
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:07,264
What are you doing?

118
00:09:07,506 --> 00:09:09,506
Do you like this outfit? Just bought it!

119
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,150
Maybe chill on the shopping, okay?

120
00:09:15,452 --> 00:09:17,386
What’s wrong with you?

121
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,404
Most guys would love it if their wives dressed like this!

122
00:09:26,585 --> 00:09:28,034
I’m gonna take a shower.

123
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,131
Wait, do that later

124
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:36,571
So, Mom’s been bringing up kids a lot lately

125
00:09:38,364 --> 00:09:40,250
We should talk about that too.

126
00:09:45,315 --> 00:09:47,315
Let’s deal with that later

127
00:09:57,421 --> 00:09:58,564
"Good student"

128
00:10:04,013 --> 00:10:07,904
Hey, it’s been forever since we traveled together

129
00:10:07,904 --> 00:10:10,459
How about Japan next month?

130
00:10:10,968 --> 00:10:12,544
Next month’s packed

131
00:10:12,544 --> 00:10:14,269
Too much work at school

132
00:10:14,269 --> 00:10:17,033
Why don’t you go with a friend or colleague?

133
00:10:17,372 --> 00:10:18,784
I’ll cover the costs.

134
00:10:19,608 --> 00:10:21,435
A tour’s only like....

135
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,700
2000 bucks

136
00:10:29,542 --> 00:10:30,323
OK

137
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:32,014
Really?!

138
00:10:34,195 --> 00:10:36,861
But you have to come with me!

139
00:10:37,225 --> 00:10:39,417
I’m not going with those shopaholics

140
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,896
they’re boring as hell!

141
00:10:46,088 --> 00:10:48,088
Alright, I’ll give you 5,000

142
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:27,967
Hi Huyen

143
00:11:28,767 --> 00:11:31,908
I was thinking of organizing a family dinner next week

144
00:11:31,908 --> 00:11:33,683
for Mom and Dad’s anniversary

145
00:11:34,725 --> 00:11:37,764
Wait, what? I got the date wrong?

146
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:40,760
Oh my god. Thanks, sis!

147
00:11:56,112 --> 00:11:59,775
You free this weekend? Let’s go get BBQ.

148
00:11:59,775 --> 00:12:01,775
Sure, babe

149
00:12:01,775 --> 00:12:03,484
Whoa, "babe"?

150
00:12:03,484 --> 00:12:05,889
Whoever’s smaller is the babe!

151
00:12:06,277 --> 00:12:08,277
But too big is scary, right?
