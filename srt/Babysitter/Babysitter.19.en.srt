1
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,200
It's been like this since New Year's Eve.

2
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:37,920
I have no idea what's really going on.

3
00:00:39,119 --> 00:00:40,079
You all are driving me crazy.

4
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,920
All you do is gossip all day.

5
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:42,479
Let me ask.

6
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:44,719
Hey.

7
00:00:45,679 --> 00:00:46,320
What's wrong with you?

8
00:00:48,359 --> 00:00:48,719
Me?

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:50,920
I'm fine, really.

10
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,079
You look so gloomy.

11
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:53,359
It's really unattractive.

12
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,280
Yeah.

13
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,079
Really?

14
00:00:58,280 --> 00:00:58,920
Yes.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:01,880
Darn it, I'll go then.

16
00:01:02,759 --> 00:01:03,560
Put on a face mask.

17
00:01:09,799 --> 00:01:11,799
Not a word about disappointment.

18
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,840
But every word is disappointment.

19
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,400
Emperor.

20
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:37,280
Emperor, you've been busy with state affairs.

21
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,560
Consort Leng asked me to make Da Hong Pao Milk Tea for you.

22
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,799
Please have a taste.

23
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Sounds good.

24
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:51,480
We have been having back pain lately.

25
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,359
A sweet drink would help.

26
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:56,680
Solve problems at the root.

27
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,840
Whoever upsets me, I'll go to them.

28
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,719
Whoever tied the bell must untie it.

29
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:03,319
Emperor, are you feeling unwell?

30
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,959
Let me handle it.

31
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,520
What are you doing?

32
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,840
Emperor, are you okay?

33
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,479
Feels good.

34
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,080
Keep going.

35
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:29,560
That's good.

36
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:34,840
Emperor.

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:39,280
After the New Year's ceremony, do you still feel unwell?

38
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,680
The Imperial Astronomical Bureau told We

39
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,759
our left shoulder isn't well.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,159
Left shoulder, huh?

41
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:52,319
Alright.

42
00:02:53,319 --> 00:02:54,039
Yes, yes.

43
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,400
Feels good, feels good.

44
00:02:55,759 --> 00:02:56,639
Emperor.

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,680
Look,

46
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:01,120
your Tianfeng Point hurts.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,439
That actually means

48
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,240
you've heard too many rumors lately.

49
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:05,800
Really?

50
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,240
This...

51
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:09,319
your Bingfeng Point hurts.

52
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:13,479
It means you've made some rushed decisions.

53
00:03:14,039 --> 00:03:14,840
How about

54
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,400
thinking it over again?

55
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,000
Makes sense, that's reasonable.

56
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,360
Go on, go on.

57
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:23,159
Alright.

58
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:26,599
As for Xue Niang,

59
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:31,719
come massage We whenever you have time.

60
00:03:31,719 --> 00:03:32,759
No problem.

61
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,199
If you want postpartum meals, that's fine.

62
00:03:37,759 --> 00:03:38,319
Light.

63
00:03:38,759 --> 00:03:39,520
Nutritious.

64
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:42,680
Here, Emperor.

65
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:55,719
Congratulations, Emperor.

66
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:57,039
Victory in battle.

67
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,719
This North-South coordination

68
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:04,639
is truly a brilliant idea.

69
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:07,439
Even with reduced military pay,

70
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,039
General Fu still completed the mission.

71
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:12,520
He deserves great credit.

72
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:17,319
I think it's the Second Prince's achievement.

73
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,279
Exactly.

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:20,560
Emperor.

75
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,279
Recently, the stars are clear.

76
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:26,240
It's a good time to reward meritorious officials.

77
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,920
We

78
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:30,360
understand.

79
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,560
Your servant heard the war has ended.

80
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,360
Congratulations, Emperor.

81
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,759
Yes.

82
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,759
We see the stars are stable lately.

83
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:51,920
All is peaceful.

84
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:54,199
By the way, where's Xue Niang?

85
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:55,639
Emperor.

86
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,040
Are you craving milk tea?

87
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,600
Yes.

88
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,199
Yes.

89
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,439
You came at the perfect time.

90
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:01,279
This one

91
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,560
is my new creation.

92
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,920
Duck Shit Fragrance Milk Tea.

93
00:05:05,839 --> 00:05:07,079
Duck Shit Fragrance.

94
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,399
It must be very fragrant.

95
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:11,120
Xue Niang,

96
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:13,240
We have an announcement to make.

97
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,240
And good news.

98
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,480
It's truly great news.

99
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,519
The power of milk tea.

100
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,959
We announce

101
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:21,560
today

102
00:05:22,079 --> 00:05:23,199
Xue Niang is granted the title

103
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,680
of Xue Beauty.

104
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,000
What the heck?

105
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,199
Xiao Xue,

106
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:42,319
Mom.

107
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:45,399
Mom.

108
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:47,720
Mom, why are you here?

109
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:48,680
Mother.

110
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,439
Xiao Xue.

111
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,399
We still need to keep matchmaking.

112
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,480
See if you like any of these three.

113
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,720
Still matchmaking?

114
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,439
Confident, wealthy homebody.

115
00:06:04,839 --> 00:06:06,560
Warm and gentle personality.

116
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,519
Upright and honest.

117
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:11,160
Kind, a good man.

118
00:06:11,439 --> 00:06:12,839
Just a "good guy" card.

119
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
Second one.

120
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,879
Caring, gentle puppy type.

121
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,759
Falls hopelessly in love.

122
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:18,839
Not good with words.

123
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,240
Very loyal.

124
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,040
Career is a bit lacking.

125
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,279
Love conquers all.

126
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,279
I don't dig wild vegetables.

127
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:26,720
Third one.

128
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,720
Fatherly boyfriend type.

129
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,079
Successful career.

130
00:06:29,079 --> 00:06:30,439
Owns a car and a house.

131
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,639
Perfect partner.

132
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:33,839
Lots of social events at this age.

133
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:37,439
In marriage, you must learn to turn a blind eye.

134
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,639
No way.

135
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:42,959
No, no, no.

136
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:46,279
I don't want that.

137
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,879
I want true love.

138
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,519
This is a huge blessing.

139
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,839
You're not happy.

140
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:11,879
That's right.

141
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:14,360
From now on, we can call each other sisters.

142
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,040
Ladies, please don't flatter me.

143
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,439
Can you help me think of a solution?

144
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:24,199
Don't you want to be the Emperor's beauty?

145
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:25,360
Absolutely not.

146
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:27,680
Didn't become Crown Princess.

147
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,519
Now I'm just discarded.

148
00:07:29,720 --> 00:07:30,839
Then...

149
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,480
I have an idea.

150
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,160
A big mole on the left cheek.

151
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:40,639
That's a really great thing.

152
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,079
This snail noodle smells way too strong.

153
00:07:48,519 --> 00:07:50,839
A woman like this is unique.

154
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:00,720
I just can't bring myself to do it.

155
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,079
We can only help you this far.

156
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,399
Accept your fate, sister.

157
00:08:14,959 --> 00:08:16,079
My dears,

158
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,959
Once I'm gone,

159
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,399
you must grow up well.

160
00:08:22,399 --> 00:08:23,879
I really can't bear to leave you.

161
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
I can't bear to leave Consort Leng.

162
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,720
Can't bear it.

163
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,560
Him.

164
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,279
Xue Niang.

165
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,279
Your Highness.

166
00:08:34,279 --> 00:08:35,440
You're still awake?

167
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:36,879
I came to check on you.

168
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,919
Someone weighs on your heart.

169
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,360
Hard to leave, isn't it?

170
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,879
Your Highness understands me best.

171
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I've never seen Zi Heng

172
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,240
look at anyone

173
00:08:54,799 --> 00:08:56,000
the way he looked at that girl.

174
00:08:57,879 --> 00:08:58,519
I guess

175
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:00,840
you are in his heart.

176
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,720
But what does it matter?

177
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,600
Even if you don't leave now,

178
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:07,759
in the future,

179
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:10,559
you still can't stay by his side for long.

180
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:13,399
There's always a way.

181
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,919
Thank you for comforting me, Your Highness.

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,919
You should go.

183
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,080
Go on.

184
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:31,080
Where to?

185
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,399
Anywhere is fine.

186
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,559
Your Highness.
