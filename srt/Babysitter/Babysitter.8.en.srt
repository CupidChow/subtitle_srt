1
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:33,719
Fu Kang

2
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:35,399
Imperial Physician

3
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,640
When did you become an imperial physician?

4
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:38,920
No more crying now.

5
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:41,000
What is this?

6
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,640
This is "wan".

7
00:00:43,799 --> 00:00:45,119
You wouldn't know even if I told you.

8
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:48,679
You used to bully me when we were kids.

9
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:50,240
And you still make fun of me now.

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,679
That's because, as a kid,

11
00:00:51,679 --> 00:00:52,359
you were so silly.

12
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Look who's talking.

13
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,200
We used to play house together as kids.

14
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,399
You even asked His Majesty to grant us a marriage.

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:01,640
That was all when we were little.

16
00:01:01,759 --> 00:01:02,399
And also,

17
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,040
I was most afraid of fish eyes.

18
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:06,040
You always scared me with fish eyes.

19
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:09,920
Second Prince

20
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,480
Second Prince

21
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:16,560
Are we still going to the Imperial Garden?

22
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:17,599
Who are you?

23
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,159
Me.

24
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,519
This is Mother Consort's maid.

25
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,040
Xue Niang

26
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:22,879
Maid Xue Niang

27
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,239
Your introduction of me is a bit...

28
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,439
Maid.

29
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:29,799
Consort Leng really spoils her servants.

30
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,400
So unruly.

31
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,319
He invited me first.

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,200
Yes.

33
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,000
We did arrange something.

34
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,000
Brother Ziheng

35
00:01:43,599 --> 00:01:44,560
Brother Ziheng

36
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,120
How about you come with me to greet Consort Leng?

37
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:50,480
Sure.

38
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,560
You're still here.

39
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:56,920
You're not needed anymore.

40
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:57,760
Go on, get back to work.

41
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,079
Got it.

42
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,120
Xue Niang

43
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,359
Let's go, Brother Ziheng.

44
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,000
Mother Consort

45
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,840
Look who's here.

46
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,199
Consort Leng

47
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:12,319
Fu Kang

48
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,240
Come.

49
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,759
Sit.

50
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:17,639
It's been years since we last met.

51
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:19,199
Fu Kang has grown so graceful.

52
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,360
She's a young lady now.

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,960
Consort Leng

54
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,800
I heard you suffered a difficult labor.

55
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,120
I truly regret

56
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,479
not coming to the palace sooner to help you.

57
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,800
It's all in the past.

58
00:02:30,479 --> 00:02:33,280
You came back to help Zi Heng with his allergy.

59
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:34,719
That's a good thing.

60
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,639
Mother Consort

61
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,560
I'm fine.

62
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
Fu Kang should focus more on the Health Care Center.

63
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,680
Health Care Center

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,080
Yes.

65
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
It was Xue Niang's idea.

66
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,599
She takes great care of all us palace women.

67
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:50,680
You know a lot.

68
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:52,680
Help out more when you have time.

69
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,520
Yes.

70
00:02:54,639 --> 00:02:56,159
Fu Kang is truly fortunate.

71
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:03,960
Xue Niang

72
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:06,039
Is she even worthy of my help?

73
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,439
Fu Kang, Imperial Physician

74
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,400
What are you doing?

75
00:03:20,439 --> 00:03:23,800
I carefully selected all these wet nurses.

76
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,319
We promote breastfeeding here.

77
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:28,719
We don't need wet nurses.

78
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:30,319
Breast milk.

79
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:31,439
Ridiculous.

80
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,759
My wet nurses are the best.

81
00:03:33,759 --> 00:03:34,960
Their milk is excellent.

82
00:03:35,960 --> 00:03:36,639
The best.

83
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,120
Did you add DHA to this milk,

84
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,599
or calcium, magnesium, zinc, selenium, lutein?

85
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,280
First,

86
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,039
breastfeeding can lower a mother's

87
00:03:47,039 --> 00:03:49,120
risk of breast and ovarian cancer.

88
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:50,599
Second,

89
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,840
frequent skin contact between mother and baby

90
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,719
can strengthen their bond.

91
00:03:55,719 --> 00:03:56,520
Nonsense.

92
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,159
Truly ridiculous.

93
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,240
You're the ridiculous one.

94
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,520
Before we officially begin,

95
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,439
ladies, please adjust your breathing.

96
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,319
Practice yoga.

97
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,599
I'm not doing that.

98
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,599
How embarrassing.

99
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:12,479
I knew Noble Consort An would say that.

100
00:04:12,759 --> 00:04:13,800
Last night,

101
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,639
I asked my friend in Yushanfang

102
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:17,199
to find his fisherman friend

103
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,879
and prepare everything for the ladies.

104
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,839
Prepare what?

105
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:21,600
Ladies,

106
00:04:22,839 --> 00:04:23,879
show it off.

107
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,680
What is this?

108
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,000
Fishnet stockings.

109
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Noble Consort An

110
00:04:37,639 --> 00:04:38,360
You have them too.

111
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,040
I have them too?

112
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,079
When did I wear these?

113
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:45,519
Who put these on me?

114
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,600
Alright.

115
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:48,399
Ladies,

116
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:51,199
let's officially begin our practice.

117
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,120
What are you all doing?

118
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:10,439
Physician Fu Kang.

119
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,279
Why are you here?

120
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Such a risky move.

121
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,959
Who taught you that?

122
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,519
Why do you say that?

123
00:05:15,639 --> 00:05:18,399
Pregnant and postpartum women
should rest in bed.

124
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,720
You have them do these exercises.

125
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:20,399
Are you trying to harm someone?

126
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,480
Don't worry, Physician Fu Kang.

127
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:25,120
I know what I'm doing.

128
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,839
That's right.

129
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:27,839
We've been doing this exercise
for a long time.

130
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,879
Our backs don't hurt anymore.

131
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,800
I think it's pretty good.

132
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:32,920
Ladies,

133
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:34,600
let's practice on our own.

134
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,959
Remember the key points
I just mentioned.

135
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,680
Are you ready?

136
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:41,920
Are you ready?

137
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Okay, okay, we're ready.

138
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,240
Three, two, one.

139
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,399
What are you all doing?

140
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:50,279
It's so noisy in a place
meant for rest.

141
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,720
Why are you here again
so late at night?

142
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:57,199
Ladies,

143
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,720
it's time for your tonic.

144
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,160
We still have to drink it?

145
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,800
I drank it earlier and got
a nosebleed.

146
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,439
You can't just take tonics blindly.

147
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,720
Lady Xu has liver fire hyperactivity.

148
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,079
How can she take blood and energy tonics?

149
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,040
None of your business.

150
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,199
If something goes wrong,
it's your hair removal cream.

151
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,439
Why don't you say your medicine
is the problem?

152
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,199
I use top-quality herbs.

153
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,120
My hair removal cream
is all-natural.

154
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:18,839
I'll test if your stuff is toxic.

155
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:19,639
Fine.

156
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
Then I'll test your medicine too.

157
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,399
Test.

158
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,439
I'll test it too.

159
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,160
I'll test.

160
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:26,040
I'll test.

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:26,720
Me.

162
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,240
Just you wait and see.

163
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,839
My nosebleed

164
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,839
might be because the room is dry.

165
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,680
Just now,

166
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,959
it was a dark and windy night.

167
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,519
I just wanted to deliver milk.

168
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,480
But I ran into a ghost.

169
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,120
Lady Xu,

170
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
there really is a ghost!

171
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,360
There definitely is.

172
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,120
I saw it with my own eyes.

173
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:05,920
It was huge.

174
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:07,720
A massive figure.

175
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
Flickering in and out.

176
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,759
Appearing and disappearing.

177
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,120
Then it vanished suddenly.

178
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,319
This Milk Thief Ghost

179
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,480
is also short on milk.

180
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:22,399
Today, the new physician Fu Kang told me

181
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,199
if we all had wet nurses,

182
00:07:24,519 --> 00:07:26,600
there wouldn't be any Milk Thief Ghost.

183
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,680
Now,

184
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:29,560
the Milk Thief Ghost knows
where the milk is stored.

185
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,800
From now on,

186
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,839
it'll probably show up often.

187
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:37,279
What about my milk? Come with me.

188
00:07:40,279 --> 00:07:41,720
Hurry and bring the stored milk.

189
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,560
I've been holding it in
just talking to you.

190
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:46,120
I really can't come alone.

191
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,680
Just have the servants do this.

192
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,279
We'd better not go in.

193
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,480
We're already here.

194
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:53,519
Come with me, I'm scared.

195
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,560
I'm even more scared.

196
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:01,399
Let's go!

197
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,120
What are you talking about?

198
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:04,759
What are you talking about?

199
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:05,240
My lady.

200
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,079
Tonight,

201
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,120
Noble Consort An,

202
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,160
you're a first-class guest.

203
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,639
How can you come to the economy
Mothers' Lounge?

204
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,319
What do you mean by that?

205
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:22,040
Your status is higher than theirs.

206
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:24,600
So of course, it's different.

207
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:26,439
But...

208
00:08:29,399 --> 00:08:30,040
Aunt Kang.

209
00:08:30,079 --> 00:08:30,879
Let's go. Yes.

210
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,240
Don't worry too much.

211
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,399
I think this Milk Thief Ghost

212
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:38,200
If you ask me,

213
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,919
we should just get wet nurses.

214
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,519
Maybe it's the breast milk

215
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,000
that broke some taboo.

216
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,120
Heaven is punishing us.

217
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:47,399
Oh, right.

218
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,679
There's one more thing.

219
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:49,759
What?

220
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:51,840
There's no such thing as ghosts.

221
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,240
I'm a firm materialist.

222
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,480
Ladies, don't leave!

223
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,159
We can't stay here anymore.

224
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,399
I'd rather die than stay.

225
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,080
You must refund all our remaining money.

226
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,159
Not a single cent less.

227
00:09:08,159 --> 00:09:09,080
It's haunted now.

228
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:10,039
Full refund.

229
00:09:10,039 --> 00:09:11,240
No.

230
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,960
There's no such thing as a Milk Thief Ghost.

231
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,080
Let's not overthink things.

232
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,960
Then how do you explain the stolen milk?

233
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:19,279
Xue Niang said

234
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,960
she's on duty tonight.

235
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:22,720
She'll definitely help us find

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:24,120
the person pretending to be a ghost.

237
00:09:26,159 --> 00:09:26,759
Meilan.

238
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:28,919
My lady.

239
00:09:29,919 --> 00:09:30,639
My lady.

240
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,159
The two sisters are truly worried.

241
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:35,399
If you want to leave, just go.

242
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,120
My lady.
