1
00:00:36,759 --> 00:00:37,840
What should be said

2
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:38,840
and what should not be said?

3
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:40,320
Do you understand?

4
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:41,880
Your servant understands.

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,439
Thank you, Your Highness.

6
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,840
Your servant will handle it now.

7
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:55,880
Emperor.

8
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,079
Xue Niang is a bringer of misfortune.

9
00:00:58,439 --> 00:01:00,119
You must not marry her.

10
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,520
What?

11
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,159
You mean

12
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,359
the southern flood

13
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,840
is related to her?

14
00:01:08,079 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes, yes.

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:11,359
As they say, Crimson Stream of Mars

16
00:01:11,359 --> 00:01:12,799
brings bad luck this year.

17
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,359
Used for warding off bad luck.

18
00:01:14,359 --> 00:01:15,599
It must not be done.

19
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:18,000
Mars controls the north.

20
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:20,239
No, Mars controls the south.

21
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,200
So the southern flood is likely...

22
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,120
Last time you said it was good luck.

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,359
Now you say she's a curse.

24
00:01:26,359 --> 00:01:27,640
Can you be trusted?

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:30,760
The stars change in an instant.

26
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,840
They are ever-changing, after all.

27
00:01:34,599 --> 00:01:36,480
The imperial order is given, hard to recall.

28
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,359
Find another way.

29
00:01:39,359 --> 00:01:40,439
Emperor.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,079
My head hurts, my head hurts.

31
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:47,959
Yes.

32
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:49,719
Yes, yes, yes.

33
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:51,680
A bit deeper.

34
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,120
A bit deeper.

35
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:56,680
So comfortable, so comfortable.

36
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,000
That's good, that's good.

37
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,439
Keep it, keep it.

38
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,159
Little An,

39
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:07,439
your belly...

40
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,759
I...

41
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,560
What's wrong with my belly?

42
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,120
You feel fine, right?

43
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,240
Thanks to Your Majesty's fortune,

44
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,360
I'm doing well.

45
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,199
But Your Majesty,

46
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:20,319
you work hard every day.

47
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,960
Your servant worries about you.

48
00:02:22,479 --> 00:02:23,719
No need to worry.

49
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:27,520
About you and Xue Niang...

50
00:02:28,439 --> 00:02:29,639
What about me and Xue Niang?

51
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:32,800
It's about the child.

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,080
Emperor.

53
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,759
Emperor, your servant was wrong.

54
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:39,919
What happened?

55
00:02:40,039 --> 00:02:41,000
Quick, get up!

56
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:41,800
Hurry, hurry!

57
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:42,759
Get up, Little An, get up!

58
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,039
Let me tell you,

59
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:48,800
what I worry about most now

60
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,319
is the child in your belly.

61
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:55,560
Don't worry, no matter whom I marry,

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,159
no one will affect our son.

63
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,159
Don't upset the baby.

64
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,240
Xue'er.

65
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:12,080
Mom.

66
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:13,879
Mom.

67
00:03:13,879 --> 00:03:14,680
Xue'er.

68
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,159
Mom, you came to see me again.

69
00:03:17,759 --> 00:03:19,039
You're about to get married.

70
00:03:19,039 --> 00:03:20,120
How could I not come?

71
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,280
But I'm marrying a fatherly boyfriend.

72
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,479
That's wonderful!

73
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,960
Now I'm relieved.

74
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,719
A fatherly boyfriend

75
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:31,360
is rich, wealthy, and stable.

76
00:03:31,759 --> 00:03:33,400
Though he's a bit older,

77
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,800
as long as he treats you well.

78
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,280
Don't mind his age.

79
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,159
He doesn't bathe?

80
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,639
Doesn't bathe.

81
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:49,159
That's not acceptable.

82
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:06,240
Stop it.

83
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,159
Consort Leng.

84
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:09,919
Is there no other way?

85
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:19,079
Such a headache.

86
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,079
Second Prince.

87
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,319
You should go fetch your bride.

88
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,199
Xue Niang, do you know?

89
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,120
I had a dream too.

90
00:04:41,959 --> 00:04:42,759
A nightmare.

91
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,879
A sweet dream.

92
00:04:47,439 --> 00:04:48,600
I dreamed

93
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:53,399
we had three children together.

94
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:55,920
Every morning I saw you all.

95
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,160
It was pure happiness.

96
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,160
Do you know

97
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,560
what that's called?

98
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:06,639
It's called building a family.

99
00:05:08,879 --> 00:05:09,560
A family.

100
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,920
Yes.

101
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,720
That's the feeling of home.

102
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:23,560
The princess has arrived.

103
00:05:27,839 --> 00:05:28,720
Congratulations, Your Highness.

104
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,879
Best wishes, Your Highness.

105
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:31,639
Let's start getting you ready.

106
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:56,439
Brother Ziheng.

107
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Today

108
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:01,519
is our big wedding day.

109
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,319
Why have you become like this?

110
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,279
Brother Ziheng.

111
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,199
What are you saying?

112
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,800
The Emperor granted us marriage.

113
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,959
I'm so happy I could die.

114
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,519
Don't tell me

115
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,439
you're not happy?

116
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:21,920
You know that I...

117
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,240
What's so good about Xue Niang?

118
00:06:27,279 --> 00:06:28,959
Why do you only think of her?

119
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:31,120
I love you so much.

120
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:34,199
Can't you see that?

121
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,959
Even if we marry,

122
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,560
my heart still belongs to Xue Niang.

123
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:40,600
You don't care?

124
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:51,079
I don't care if you love me.

125
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,759
It's enough that I love you.

126
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,040
You're crazy.

127
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,480
I'm not crazy.

128
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:12,040
Drink this cup of wine,

129
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,360
and I'll be yours.

130
00:07:30,399 --> 00:07:32,480
Wei Ziheng.

131
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,240
Xue Niang.

132
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:07,839
No matter what,

133
00:08:08,079 --> 00:08:09,160
I won't let you marry.

134
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,120
Xue Niang.

135
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:17,560
Ziheng.

136
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,839
Ziheng.

137
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,680
Xue Niang.

138
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:27,959
Ziheng.

139
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,439
Xue Niang.

140
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,399
What should we do?

141
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,840
What now? Quick, think of another way.

142
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,480
Noble Consort, Noble Consort An.

143
00:08:51,759 --> 00:08:52,320
Ziheng.

144
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,039
My stomach...

145
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:53,600
Xue Niang.

146
00:08:55,559 --> 00:08:56,240
Your Highness.

147
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:57,919
I'll stall the Emperor for you.

148
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:02,360
The Second Prince defied his superior.

149
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,399
Unforgivable crime. The Emperor commands—

150
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:08,799
Imprison him at once, no visits allowed.

151
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:13,639
Is the child all right?

152
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,759
The Emperor keeps saying he loves me.

153
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:18,159
But now he still wants to marry Xue Niang.

154
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,519
She's just a nanny with a child.

155
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,360
How is she worthy to be a Beauty?

156
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,039
Emperor.

157
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,720
Noble Consort An's health comes first.

158
00:09:25,879 --> 00:09:27,960
We must be careful with the Dragon Heir.

159
00:09:28,679 --> 00:09:29,399
Otherwise...

160
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,759
Our situation...

161
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,159
Let's discuss it later.

162
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,279
Xiao An, what's wrong, what is it?

163
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:34,799
We...

164
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,519
Didn't we already agree?

165
00:09:36,639 --> 00:09:38,000
Who did you agree with?

166
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:38,919
Anyway...

167
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:41,279
The child inside doesn't want this.

168
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:43,360
If the Emperor insists on marrying Xue Niang,

169
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:44,480
this child...

170
00:09:44,799 --> 00:09:46,320
Your servant doesn't want this child.

171
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:46,720
I...

172
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:48,960
All right, all right.

173
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,000
Xiao An, Xiao An...

174
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,159
I promise to think it over carefully.

175
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:54,399
Don't be reckless, don't be reckless.

176
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,039
Emperor.

177
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,080
Fukang is here.

178
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Good, good timing.

179
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:09,960
Quick, help me take a look.

180
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,399
Noble Consort An, is your stomach all right?
