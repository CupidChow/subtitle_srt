1
00:00:30,839 --> 00:00:31,960
Your Highness

2
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:34,200
Why are you making things
difficult for the Emperor?

3
00:00:34,799 --> 00:00:36,679
Why are you so upset about this?

4
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,520
I'm not upset.

5
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,000
We asked the master
to give a name.

6
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,000
Lovely

7
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,439
But he hasn't even come
to see the child.

8
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:45,920
Your Highness

9
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,000
What should we do next?

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,799
Postpartum confinement
costs money.

11
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:56,320
Go check

12
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,799
if there are any gold
or silver jewelry left.

13
00:01:00,119 --> 00:01:01,320
Have someone sell them.

14
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:03,039
Yes.

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,920
So the valuables I have

16
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:14,719
do I have to give them away
before I even use them?

17
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:17,799
Zhang Xiaoxue

18
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:18,879
Think of the bigger picture.

19
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,280
But...

20
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,480
Pawning jewelry

21
00:01:25,719 --> 00:01:27,319
only helps for a while.

22
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:29,120
It can't solve the real problem.

23
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,799
We need to earn,
not just save.

24
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,120
What do you mean?

25
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:39,760
Use money

26
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:42,040
to make more money.

27
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,959
Health Care Center

28
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,760
That's right.

29
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,280
The hardest time for women

30
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:49,879
is pregnancy and childbirth.

31
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:51,560
There are many women
in the palace.

32
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,760
Business will be booming.

33
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,239
Look here.

34
00:01:56,400 --> 00:02:00,239
This is a place every woman
in the palace dreams of.

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,280
Here, new mothers

36
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,480
become full of energy.

37
00:02:04,519 --> 00:02:05,799
Those who want another child

38
00:02:06,239 --> 00:02:07,040
can get pregnant again.

39
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:07,879
For those afraid of childbirth...

40
00:02:08,199 --> 00:02:09,919
We won't do anything
the Emperor wouldn't approve.

41
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:11,120
Anyway,

42
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:14,439
mothers share and support
each other.

43
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,960
Children get standardized,
high-quality care.

44
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,360
Xue Niang

45
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,240
This is much more thorough
than just a nanny.

46
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,240
Exactly.

47
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:26,240
The key is the maternity nurse.

48
00:02:26,639 --> 00:02:28,159
Not only do children need care,

49
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,000
mothers need care too.

50
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,840
From daily life to meals
to recovery—full service.

51
00:02:34,199 --> 00:02:36,120
I'll offer packages
at different prices.

52
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,840
for Your Highnesses to choose.

53
00:02:38,439 --> 00:02:39,199
Xue Niang

54
00:02:39,719 --> 00:02:42,319
Don't let the palace sisters
feel jealous.

55
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:43,759
Don't worry, Your Highness.

56
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,560
I'll make sure it's worth
every penny.

57
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:50,240
I guarantee Your Highnesses
will be satisfied.

58
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,840
Though we don't have
everything yet,

59
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,360
it's already taking shape.

60
00:03:04,439 --> 00:03:06,360
Once we get clients,

61
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,080
make money,

62
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,919
it'll get even better.

63
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:10,400
Xue Niang

64
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:12,240
Can we really make money?

65
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,560
Of course!

66
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:14,479
Trust me.

67
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,400
By the way, Meilan,

68
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:23,120
give me a list of pregnant
Your Highnesses.

69
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:25,400
Beauty Xu just gave birth.

70
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,120
Consort Xin's child
is still young.

71
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,080
Here's what we'll do.

72
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,000
List

73
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:29,680
Accounts

74
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,879
You keep track of everything.

75
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,759
Got it.

76
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,439
I can't write.

77
00:03:39,039 --> 00:03:39,759
I'm coming in.

78
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:41,759
Aren't you already inside?

79
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:43,120
Mother, what do you need?

80
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:45,000
It's not Noble Consort Leng.

81
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,360
I'm looking for you.

82
00:03:47,199 --> 00:03:48,599
I don't have money
to pay your gambling debts.

83
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,400
I didn't gamble.

84
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:52,879
Who spread these false rumors?

85
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:54,599
Spreading rumors is easy.

86
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,479
Clearing them up is exhausting.

87
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,840
You know how to play chess?

88
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,400
I learned at the youth center.

89
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
Why are you really here?

90
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,360
To borrow money from you.

91
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:07,400
Here's the thing.

92
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,560
We

93
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,240
plan to start a business
in the Cold Palace.

94
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,240
Open a Health Care Center.

95
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,800
Health Care Center

96
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,000
Yesterday, the Emperor
visited Noble Consort Leng.

97
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,800
The atmosphere was peaceful.

98
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,120
Suddenly, it turned cold.

99
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:20,240
You could say something happened.

100
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:21,759
Or that it was just normal.

101
00:04:22,279 --> 00:04:23,759
Or that nothing happened.

102
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,079
The Emperor got angry

103
00:04:25,079 --> 00:04:26,600
and cut our palace's

104
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,879
half-month allowance.

105
00:04:29,079 --> 00:04:30,839
He even told us

106
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:33,000
not to let you help.

107
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,600
Business isn't that easy.

108
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:35,879
Especially in the Cold Palace.

109
00:04:35,879 --> 00:04:36,680
Yeah.

110
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,519
Noble Consort Leng said

111
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,000
to pawn all the jewelry.

112
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,319
Pawning won't get us far.

113
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:43,160
That's right.

114
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,360
So,

115
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,199
you invest.

116
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,000
It's not a loan.

117
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,800
You're an angel investor.

118
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:52,120
What investor?

119
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,399
Just know you're an angel.

120
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:03,639
Don't miss out
if you're passing by!

121
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,959
Grand opening sale!

122
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,560
Sign up and get a big gift, yes.

123
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,879
Buy one, get one free.

124
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,199
Buy one, get one free!

125
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,480
Come, come, this way!

126
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,920
Check out our Health Care Center.

127
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:15,920
Come, take our little red booklet.

128
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,160
Take it home for Your Highness.

129
00:05:17,319 --> 00:05:18,439
Your Highnesses

130
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,439
Come, come, come.

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,319
Learn about our Health Care Center.

132
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,759
Your Highness, please come in.

133
00:05:23,839 --> 00:05:25,240
Hello, Consort Xin. What's this?

134
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,199
Hello, Beauty Xu.

135
00:05:26,839 --> 00:05:29,680
Our Cold Palace is now
a Health Care Center.

136
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,120
All the services are listed there.

137
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:33,639
Your Highness

138
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,240
Who knows what new tricks
the Cold Palace is up to.

139
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,519
Now all the maids

140
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:39,160
have a little booklet.

141
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:40,439
I secretly got one.

142
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,800
It's called the Little Red Booklet.

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,920
They think they can open a Health Care Center?

144
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,240
So much fun, so much fun.

145
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,439
Xiao Yaoyao, slow down!

146
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,000
I'll get rid of them first.

147
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,519
Noble Consort An

148
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,079
Why have you come here?

149
00:06:00,199 --> 00:06:02,600
I oversee the entire harem.

150
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,279
Can't I come to your place?

151
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:05,480
No.

152
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,160
Noble Consort An, you exaggerate.

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,199
I mean,

154
00:06:08,399 --> 00:06:11,240
I thought you'd bring a grand opening bouquet.

155
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:22,240
This Health Care Center of yours—

156
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,920
Has the Emperor approved it?

157
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,319
Do you have the required permits?

158
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
You think you can just open it?

159
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,279
We're still processing the paperwork.

160
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:32,920
Your Highness.

161
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:37,839
Noble Consort An, no need to press so hard.

162
00:06:37,959 --> 00:06:39,680
I'll report this to the Emperor.

163
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:40,839
If he agrees,

164
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,199
we'll keep it open.

165
00:06:42,439 --> 00:06:43,720
If he doesn't,

166
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,199
we'll close it for good.

167
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:48,399
No need to trouble yourself, Noble Consort An.

168
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,079
Having a child makes you special, huh?

169
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:55,839
Aunt Kang.

170
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,800
Let's go.

171
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:04,959
Go.

172
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:05,959
Go, go.

173
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,399
This big pool—

174
00:07:17,399 --> 00:07:19,639
It's as big as my own bathroom.

175
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:22,560
So comfortable.

176
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:29,040
Who's there?

177
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,319
What's that sound?

178
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:32,800
Mother Consort.

179
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,279
Your Highness, there's a thief! A thief!

180
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:37,199
Someone stole a porcelain vase.

181
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:38,759
What?

182
00:07:39,079 --> 00:07:40,959
All this fuss for a stolen vase?

183
00:07:43,279 --> 00:07:43,920
Darn it.

184
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,399
Lure the tiger away from the mountain.

185
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,079
Bing'er.

186
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:46,920
Your Highness.

187
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,480
Bing'er.

188
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,399
Bing'er! Bing'er!

189
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,639
Put down the prince!

190
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,480
Wei Ziheng.

191
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,199
Don't alert the enemy.

192
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:00,720
Right.

193
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:04,399
I know how to find Bing'er.

194
00:08:04,399 --> 00:08:05,040
How?

195
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,120
Paw Patrol.

196
00:08:12,079 --> 00:08:12,959
Paw Patrol.

197
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,839
Whenever there's trouble,

198
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,120
Paw Patrol.

199
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:19,720
Paw Patrol.

200
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,720
we'll be there right away.

201
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,519
In the cellar.

202
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,240
Bing'er! Bing'er!

203
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,639
No!

204
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,159
Xue Niang.

205
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:47,720
What should we do?

206
00:08:48,519 --> 00:08:49,120
Are you alright?

207
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,360
I'm fine.

208
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,840
Help!

209
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,840
Is anyone there?

210
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,279
Bing'er, don't be afraid.

211
00:08:58,759 --> 00:09:00,879
Your Highness and the others will come for us.

212
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,519
Reporting to Noble Consort,

213
00:09:07,679 --> 00:09:09,720
the little prince was stolen successfully.

214
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,639
Xue Niang and the second prince went after them.

215
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,519
There's no news from them now.

216
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,559
I believe

217
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,480
things look grim.

218
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,039
The water temperature is nice today.

219
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:21,639
Your Highness.

220
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,080
This move kills two birds with one stone.

221
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,320
It's truly clever.

222
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,759
I shall rest well tonight.

223
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,960
I hate those chirping noises the most.

224
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,120
Tell the servants—

225
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,799
if they hear birds tomorrow morning,

226
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,720
just blow them up for me.

227
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,799
Yes, Your Highness.
