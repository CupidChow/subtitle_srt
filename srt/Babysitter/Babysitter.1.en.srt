1
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,600
Zhang Xiaoxue, patient in bed ten is calling.

2
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,600
Go check right away.

3
00:00:34,679 --> 00:00:35,600
Stop hiding in the bathroom.

4
00:00:35,799 --> 00:00:38,759
Cold Palace Storms: Mother, Please Let Go, Chapter Eighteen

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,840
Why do I never feel the urge to poop

6
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:42,439
except at times like this?

7
00:00:42,439 --> 00:00:43,840
Giving Consort Leng calming tea every day.

8
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,039
In the end, one body, two lives lost.

9
00:00:51,759 --> 00:00:52,479
Where's my phone?

10
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:55,079
Where are my clothes?

11
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:55,759
What's going on here?

12
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,799
Welcome, Zhang Xiaoxue.

13
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:58,960
You startled me.

14
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:00,840
I've entered the novel.

15
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,119
According to the usual plot,

16
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:04,799
shouldn't you tell me

17
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:06,640
how I can return to the real world?

18
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:09,439
If you want to go back,

19
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:11,560
you must complete the system task.

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,159
Become the Crown Princess.

21
00:01:13,319 --> 00:01:14,079
Otherwise,

22
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,879
you'll be wiped out completely.

23
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,879
You already know, yet you ask.

24
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,079
At least give me some respect.

25
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:21,200
Is there a reward for finishing the task?

26
00:01:21,319 --> 00:01:23,200
You'll never be constipated again.

27
00:01:23,719 --> 00:01:25,159
Then I have to finish the task.

28
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,519
Phone.

29
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:34,760
If I had my phone, I could record this.

30
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,319
Xue Niang.

31
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,799
Why did you take so long in the toilet?

32
00:01:39,799 --> 00:01:41,120
I'm the expendable Xue Niang.

33
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:42,920
So you are

34
00:01:42,959 --> 00:01:43,640
Mei Lan.

35
00:01:43,719 --> 00:01:44,920
Did you poop yourself silly?

36
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:45,879
Where's the calming tea?

37
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:46,879
Go get it quickly.

38
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,000
This is too exciting.

39
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,120
Others enter novels

40
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,040
as princesses, consorts, or noble ladies.

41
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,799
I start as a maid in the Cold Palace.

42
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,560
Mei Lan, let me ask you.

43
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,439
Tell me,

44
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,719
who is the current Crown Prince?

45
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,120
The Crown Prince hasn't been appointed yet.

46
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,960
The Emperor has two grown sons.

47
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,120
One is Wei Ziheng.

48
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,000
The other is Wei Ziyue.

49
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:16,599
Sadly, the Emperor doesn't favor either.

50
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,000
Why is that?

51
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,599
Wei Ziyue

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,960
is charming and handsome,

53
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,039
dashing and heroic.

54
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
He's always away at war.

55
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,120
But he doesn't care for politics.

56
00:02:30,439 --> 00:02:32,240
Now, about Wei Ziheng—

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,599
he's well-read,

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,639
full of talent.

59
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,120
But he's a jinx.

60
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,360
A jinx?

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,159
Jinxes bring bad luck.

62
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,439
Not fit to inherit the throne.

63
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:44,159
Feudal superstitions ruin lives.

64
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:45,319
Don't talk about that.

65
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:48,080
Once Consort Leng gives birth to a prince,

66
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,360
our good days

67
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,280
will return.

68
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,120
That's right.

69
00:02:53,039 --> 00:02:54,000
The book says

70
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,439
Consort Leng is pregnant.

71
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,719
Even if she gives birth,

72
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm over twenty years older than him.

73
00:02:58,759 --> 00:03:01,879
Me as Crown Princess? That's absurd.

74
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:03,159
In Da Wei Kingdom,

75
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,680
Crown Princesses have always been older by twenty years.

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,120
What a unique setup.

77
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:16,439
Where do I get the calming tea?

78
00:03:16,479 --> 00:03:17,120
Xue Niang.

79
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,960
Noble Consort An has waited for you.

80
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are you dawdling?

81
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:22,560
Hurry up.

82
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,599
That's Auntie Kang, the villain in the novel.

83
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:25,439
Wait a moment.

84
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,919
Can I not go?

85
00:03:28,639 --> 00:03:30,560
Which chapter of the novel is this?

86
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,120
What is Xue Niang up to?

87
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,520
Why are you muttering?

88
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,919
Watch your head.

89
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:37,879
Kneel.

90
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,639
Why were you so slow?

91
00:03:43,199 --> 00:03:44,800
Just now,

92
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:46,039
I was constipated.

93
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,080
I visited the House of ease.

94
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,879
It took some time.

95
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,759
Today, Consort Leng must

96
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:54,319
drink the last bowl of special calming tea.

97
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,280
So this is the main villain, Noble Consort An.

98
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,960
She gives Consort Leng calming tea every day.

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,120
In the end, one body, two lives lost.

100
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,000
Then she turns and kills Xue Niang.

101
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,879
Use and discard.

102
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,680
Cruel and ruthless.

103
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,039
Once it's done,

104
00:04:11,039 --> 00:04:12,599
you'll get your reward.

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:14,319
You may leave.

106
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,599
Yes.

107
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,360
As a maternity center

108
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,079
officially certified future star intern,

109
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,000
I actually met the pregnant Consort Leng.

110
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,319
It's a perfect match for my specialty.

111
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,959
So this is Consort Leng.

112
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:34,160
She's had a child before,

113
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,720
but still so graceful.

114
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Xue Niang.

115
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,639
Why were you gone so long?

116
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,000
The tea is getting cold.

117
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,160
Don't blame her.

118
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,319
Bring it here.

119
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,279
Your Highness.

120
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,839
Just set it down.

121
00:04:58,959 --> 00:04:59,759
I'll drink it later.

122
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:05,560
Your Highness.

123
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,800
This environment

124
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,920
isn't very good for you or the baby.

125
00:05:10,079 --> 00:05:11,959
Older mothers need extra care.

126
00:05:12,079 --> 00:05:13,720
Room temperature should stay at twenty-four degrees.

127
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,240
Humidity should be around 52 percent.

128
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,519
Catching a cold late in pregnancy is very risky.

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,600
What are you talking about?

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,480
I'm saying

131
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:21,920
you need a warm, comfortable place for delivery.

132
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:23,360
Looks like thirty-three weeks.

133
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,279
Your mental state is good.

134
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,360
Keep your weight and blood sugar stable.

135
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,720
Stop eating these sugary pastries.

136
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,120
Switch to cherry tomatoes and cucumbers instead.

137
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:32,839
Your Highness.

138
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,959
Let's not listen to her lecture.

139
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:36,439
Let's drink tea first.

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,560
Mother, don't drink it!

141
00:06:10,519 --> 00:06:11,079
Guards!

142
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,079
Seize Xue Niang!

143
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:15,199
Why are you arresting me?

144
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:16,240
Ziheng.

145
00:06:16,399 --> 00:06:17,319
Why are you here?

146
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:19,680
Wei Ziheng, that jinxed prince.

147
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,680
Even if you are a prince,

148
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,279
you can't just barge into the Cold Palace.

149
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,639
Should I just watch you harm my mother?

150
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:26,720
Me?

151
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,120
Harm your mother?

152
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:29,759
Mother.

153
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:32,800
Today I saw Xue Niang meet Noble Consort An
in the imperial garden.

154
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,399
Mother and Noble Consort An
have always been at odds.

155
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,399
Noble Consort An had her deliver this tea.

156
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,800
So you're saying

157
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,199
there's something wrong with my tea?

158
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,240
That's right.

159
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:55,879
Let me show you

160
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,720
what true vision means.

161
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,839
Others transmigrate for romance,

162
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,199
but I

163
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,600
am here to build my career.

164
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,920
Why are you here again?

165
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,439
This only proves the tea isn't poisoned.

166
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:12,759
Mother.

167
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,720
Let me take her for questioning.

168
00:07:14,839 --> 00:07:16,639
Why are you so stubborn?

169
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:18,240
Xue Niang has served me for years.

170
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,079
On this matter,

171
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:20,519
I still trust her.

172
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,399
Mother.

173
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,639
Then please allow me

174
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:30,879
to station guards at the Cold Palace.

175
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,600
To prevent schemers

176
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,519
with ill intentions.

177
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,279
You're a prince,

178
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,839
standing guard at the Cold Palace all day?

179
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,040
Besides, you're not in good health.

180
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,519
Guarding day and night

181
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:42,959
is too exhausting.

182
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,399
I'm already a useless son.

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,560
Guarding the palace gate

184
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,759
at least gives me some purpose.

185
00:07:47,319 --> 00:07:47,800
Mother.

186
00:07:47,959 --> 00:07:48,920
I'll handle everything properly.

187
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,279
Please rest well.

188
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,519
What's wrong, Your Highness?

189
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,040
Your Highness.

190
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,160
Are you feeling unwell?

191
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,959
It's nothing.

192
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:07,959
Your Highness.

193
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,480
Shall we have a

194
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:13,360
Ma Sha Ji before bed?

195
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:15,160
Horses can kill chickens?

196
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,279
A foot soak before bed

197
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:20,040
can help women in late pregnancy

198
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,720
relax more easily.

199
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:23,160
Xue Niang.

200
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,279
There's a saying among palace nurses:

201
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,360
A pointed belly means a girl,

202
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,399
a round belly means a boy.

203
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:31,639
About this,

204
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:32,960
what do you think?

205
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,759
Without an ultrasound, it's all nonsense.

206
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,480
I actually hope

207
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:38,960
it's a little princess.

208
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,159
Why?

209
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,679
Shouldn't you want a son?

210
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,960
To defy fate?

211
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,600
Even if it's a son,

212
00:08:46,919 --> 00:08:49,039
being a prince is enough.

213
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,159
Don't become Crown Prince.

214
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,840
As Crown Prince, there are troubles inside and out.

215
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,200
Bound by court affairs.

216
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,559
How can he live peacefully?

217
00:08:58,799 --> 00:08:59,720
I get it.

218
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,519
All mothers are like this.

219
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,200
Before giving birth,

220
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,919
they just want their child healthy and safe.

221
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,879
After the child is born,

222
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:10,279
they become "Haidian moms" pushing their kids.

223
00:09:10,279 --> 00:09:11,200
What are you talking about?

224
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,080
I mean,

225
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,240
from now on,

226
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,159
let's soak our feet every night before bed.

227
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:18,960
That way,

228
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,480
it's more relaxing.

229
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,559
Don't worry, Your Highness.

230
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,080
I'll help you safely deliver the Crown Prince.

231
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,279
So I can go home.

232
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:28,840
Look at the kitten.

233
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,639
I'm scared of cats, don't tease me.

234
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:32,919
Little tigers are cuter.

235
00:09:35,679 --> 00:09:37,159
That frail Consort Leng

236
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:38,639
looks rosy lately.

237
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:39,679
Her pregnancy is stable.

238
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,559
They say it's thanks to Xue Niang's care.

239
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,080
That Xue Niang—

240
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,960
If she won't serve me,

241
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,039
she doesn't need to live.

242
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,279
Your servant

243
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,000
has a foolish idea.

244
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,799
Not sure if I should say it.

245
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:54,360
You know it's foolish yet you say it?

246
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,000
Your Highness.

247
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,000
Instead of waiting for doom,

248
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,799
why not

249
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,960
take the initiative?

250
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,960
Speak plainly.

251
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:02,120
Since Consort Leng

252
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,080
trusts Xue Niang so much,

253
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,559
if Xue Niang makes a mistake,

254
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,399
wouldn't they both suffer?
