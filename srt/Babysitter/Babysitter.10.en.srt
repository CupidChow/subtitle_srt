1
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:38,600
Your Highness

2
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:39,479
Play this one

3
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:46,679
Your turn

4
00:00:46,759 --> 00:00:47,359
Me

5
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:51,759
Binger, hurry up!

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,560
Coming

7
00:00:53,159 --> 00:00:53,560
Eight Bamboo

8
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:54,079
I'll take it

9
00:00:57,359 --> 00:00:58,600
Did you all hear?

10
00:00:58,799 --> 00:01:00,039
The First Prince is back

11
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,320
Is His Majesty going to make him Crown Prince?

12
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,640
Are you kidding?

13
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,480
His Majesty doesn't even want to look at him

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,079
Why would he make him Crown Prince?

15
00:01:09,239 --> 00:01:09,959
Exactly

16
00:01:10,359 --> 00:01:11,319
Honestly

17
00:01:11,319 --> 00:01:12,680
It has to be Binger

18
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,400
Now His Majesty only visits him in the nursery

19
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,439
He doesn't even hold my Princess Yue Yue anymore

20
00:01:17,799 --> 00:01:18,719
Don't talk nonsense

21
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,840
Noble Consort An's baby

22
00:01:20,879 --> 00:01:22,640
might be a little prince too

23
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,480
Right, right

24
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:26,560
Look at me, talking too much

25
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,159
Fifty thousand

26
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,879
I win

27
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,439
Mei Lan, Mei Lan

28
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,920
Are you showing off like a peacock?

29
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,120
Am I pretty?

30
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:51,480
Beautiful

31
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,280
The First Prince is coming back

32
00:01:54,879 --> 00:01:56,719
Today I'll finally meet

33
00:01:57,519 --> 00:01:59,840
the idol I've been dreaming of

34
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,519
That's the First Prince! Isn't he handsome?

35
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:04,680
Handsome

36
00:02:05,359 --> 00:02:06,000
What are you doing?

37
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,319
Right?

38
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:09,680
Mei Lan

39
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:13,120
We have to make sure the First Prince remembers us

40
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,039
Let's chase him together

41
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:16,400
Together

42
00:02:16,439 --> 00:02:17,120
Together

43
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:17,800
Together

44
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,879
Together—chase who?

45
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,879
Good looks are justice

46
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,759
Who doesn't love a handsome guy?

47
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,280
Here he comes

48
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:36,000
Fly brave, Crown Prince, to the top!

49
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Meilan's love will never stop!

50
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,840
Fly brave, Crown Prince, to the top!

51
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,599
Meilan's love will never stop!

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,319
Fly brave, Crown Prince, to the top!

53
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:44,960
Meilan's love will never stop!

54
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,759
Fly brave, Crown Prince, to the top!

55
00:02:46,759 --> 00:02:48,520
Meilan's love will never stop!

56
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:02,960
Royal Brother

57
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:03,800
You're back

58
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,199
Zi Heng

59
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:09,719
Long time no see

60
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,639
Xue Niang, I'm no longer a fan

61
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,479
Thank you

62
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,479
Ziyue greets Your Highness

63
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,680
Congratulations, Your Highness

64
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,759
on giving birth to a little prince

65
00:03:29,719 --> 00:03:31,639
Ziyue, is everything well?

66
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:33,960
Your child is in good health

67
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:35,360
Oh, right

68
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:38,039
I just went to see the little prince

69
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,000
Binger has a heroic look

70
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,000
Just like me

71
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:45,360
Very good, very good

72
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,560
Oh, right

73
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,840
Please look

74
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,520
This

75
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:00,159
What is this?

76
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,319
A small gift

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:02,840
It's nothing

78
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,120
All made by Ziyue's own hands

79
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:06,960
Please treasure it, Your Highness

80
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,680
That's amazing

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,120
Doraemon

82
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,840
Ultraman

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,680
Astronaut

84
00:04:22,319 --> 00:04:23,800
Always at war

85
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:26,279
You still have time for wood carving?

86
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,399
That's my main job

87
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:33,199
First Prince, you're extraordinary

88
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:34,279
He

89
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,319
He looks like he could really fight monsters

90
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,319
That's his opponent

91
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
Tesla

92
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,439
Do you believe in light too?

93
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:56,160
You know wood carving

94
00:04:58,519 --> 00:04:59,600
Consort Leng's people

95
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,839
Great taste, as expected

96
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:09,040
May I ask

97
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:10,759
Your name, miss?

98
00:05:11,839 --> 00:05:12,759
My name is Xue Niang

99
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,639
Xue Niang

100
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:20,759
Royal Brother

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:22,600
Royal Brother

102
00:05:23,079 --> 00:05:24,279
Mother prepared some dishes

103
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,040
Would you like to stay for a meal?

104
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,879
The one who understands me

105
00:05:28,879 --> 00:05:30,000
is Xue Niang

106
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:38,360
Royal Brother

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,040
Are you planning to assist Father this time?

108
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,879
You're skilled in military affairs

109
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,319
Always victorious in battle

110
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,480
He just cares about his reputation

111
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,120
He tells everyone I'm brave and fierce

112
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,680
But I won't fight any wars

113
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,920
But when it comes to wood carving

114
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,120
I'm a real expert

115
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:57,160
So what's your plan for coming back?

116
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:00,160
I've always thought about Father's tree in the Imperial Garden

117
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:01,800
That tree

118
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,360
is the most precious in the country

119
00:06:03,839 --> 00:06:04,720
I plan to cut it down

120
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,879
and take it to Jiangnan

121
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:08,199
to open another wood carving workshop

122
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,639
Royal Brother

123
00:06:10,879 --> 00:06:13,199
That's a very unusual idea

124
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:14,600
Father may not agree

125
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,000
We're not in the same circle

126
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:16,800
You don't get it

127
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,199
But someone does

128
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:20,800
That maid understands

129
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,480
Xue Niang

130
00:06:25,040 --> 00:06:25,560
Yes

131
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,000
She's very smart

132
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:32,920
I think she's great too

133
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:35,680
It's getting late

134
00:06:35,879 --> 00:06:36,480
Rest early

135
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:39,839
Xue Niang

136
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,160
Royal Brother

137
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:45,199
What did you mean by "great" just now?

138
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,399
Paw Patrol, Paw Patrol

139
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:57,079
We’ll be there in no time

140
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,040
I wish he could stay like this forever

141
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:07,519
Where I’m from, we take full moon photos of babies

142
00:07:07,879 --> 00:07:11,759
Some moms also make baby footprints as keepsakes

143
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,360
Baby footprints

144
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,199
What are baby footprints?

145
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,560
Your Highness

146
00:07:21,399 --> 00:07:22,639
I’ve got an idea

147
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,000
Hey everyone, hey family

148
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:27,000
Next, let’s open link number one, okay?

149
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,680
So, what’s in link number one?

150
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:31,000
Full Moon Wood Carving Gift Set

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,879
Come on, click the link, click the link

152
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,240
This gift set is truly

153
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,839
remarkable

154
00:07:35,839 --> 00:07:36,879
exquisitely crafted

155
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:37,600
Yes, that’s right

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,040
Let me introduce the materials of this gift set

157
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,120
It’s made from the oldest tree in the Imperial Garden

158
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,240
The very oldest tree, right at the center

159
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:46,800
Oh my gosh

160
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,279
And it was cut straight from the root

161
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,800
Seriously

162
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,480
Once it’s cut, it’ll never grow back

163
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,519
It’s gone, gone for good

164
00:07:53,519 --> 00:07:55,680
So you see how precious this wood is, right?

165
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:57,439
And who’s the maker?

166
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,120
Who?

167
00:07:58,639 --> 00:07:59,519
First Prince

168
00:07:59,879 --> 00:08:00,920
Who?

169
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,319
First Prince!

170
00:08:03,279 --> 00:08:06,879
These carvings are handmade by the First Prince

171
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Every detail is carved by hand

172
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,160
If he makes a mistake, he can’t fix it

173
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,439
So it’s

174
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,600
one of a kind

175
00:08:14,079 --> 00:08:14,759
First Prince

176
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,040
Your wood carving collab with the Health Care Center

177
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:18,399
is super popular

178
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,199
The money we make

179
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,519
We’ll split it between us

180
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,279
Money doesn’t matter

181
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,040
A soulmate is hard to find

182
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,759
I feel a little dizzy

183
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:33,879
First Prince, what’s wrong?

184
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:35,279
Because of love

185
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:38,159
It makes people lose their minds

186
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,399
A stunner
