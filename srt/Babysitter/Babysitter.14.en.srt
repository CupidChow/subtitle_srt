1
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,439
So,

2
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,960
all the more reason, in limited time,

3
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,399
to do things that bring joy and meaning.

4
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,200
Go for it, Zhang Xiaoxue!

5
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,240
Darn it, this is so tough for me.

6
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,119
If you're tired, take a break.

7
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,520
You know what?

8
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,479
After Mei Lan left,

9
00:00:59,759 --> 00:01:02,039
I had to do all the work by myself.

10
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:04,079
I'm the junior nurse.

11
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,359
I'm the head nurse.

12
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:06,760
I'm the nutritionist.

13
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,200
I'm also the security chief.

14
00:01:09,359 --> 00:01:12,000
These KPIs are just impossible to meet.

15
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,200
I can help you.

16
00:01:19,239 --> 00:01:19,719
You?

17
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,640
You could be a male maternity nurse.

18
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,120
Why not?

19
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,840
Bing'er is my younger brother.

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:27,120
It's only natural for me to care for him.

21
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,480
It's worth a try, even if it's desperate.

22
00:01:33,359 --> 00:01:34,239
But...

23
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:36,799
I need to train you first to see if you have talent.

24
00:01:36,879 --> 00:01:37,200
Alright.

25
00:01:37,359 --> 00:01:39,040
Don't underestimate this job.

26
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,680
You need guts and care in this field.

27
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,239
And also...

28
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:46,200
And...

29
00:01:47,079 --> 00:01:47,840
There's me, too.

30
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,439
Auntie Kang.

31
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,519
Don't break the whole stalk.

32
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,359
You need to take off

33
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:55,239
the part that's been bitten by bugs.

34
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:56,200
He doesn't know how.

35
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:58,159
Don't make things hard for the Second Prince.

36
00:02:00,359 --> 00:02:01,040
Xue Niang.

37
00:02:02,959 --> 00:02:04,920
First Prince, why are you here?

38
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:07,760
Zi Heng.

39
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,080
I've made up my mind.

40
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,039
Xue Niang.

41
00:02:12,479 --> 00:02:13,560
I have something for you.

42
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:14,759
What is it?

43
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,919
I'm planning to...

44
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,080
marry her.

45
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,000
Brother.

46
00:02:25,919 --> 00:02:27,919
What's this? What is he doing?

47
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:31,599
Brother.

48
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,159
Brother.

49
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,639
Your taste is getting more and more unique.

50
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:46,680
Isn't this me?

51
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,840
First Prince.

52
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
You put thought into this.

53
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:55,520
How does this look like you?

54
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,159
Her face is so sharp.

55
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:58,080
Your face is so round.

56
00:02:59,439 --> 00:03:00,000
Brother.

57
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,400
This isn't accurate.

58
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:03,800
Well said.

59
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,039
But don't say it again next time.

60
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,520
First Prince.

61
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:08,560
I'll go find a place to display it.

62
00:03:09,319 --> 00:03:10,199
Let's go right now.

63
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,199
Let's go.

64
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,120
Zi Heng.

65
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,120
What are you doing here?

66
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,199
They're short-staffed at the Health Care Center.

67
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:24,639
I'm helping them pick vegetables, just lending a hand.

68
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,240
Absurd!

69
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:26,879
You're the dignified Second Prince,

70
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,080
doing women's work?

71
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:28,960
How improper!

72
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:29,960
Come back with me.

73
00:03:30,199 --> 00:03:31,039
Brother.

74
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,879
This is a profession.

75
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,280
There's a lot to learn in it.

76
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,000
The harem is full of yin energy.

77
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,240
Do you want Father to send you to the frontier?

78
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,280
That's right.

79
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,240
I have strong yang energy.

80
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,199
Where help is needed,

81
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,879
leave it to me.

82
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:51,719
Your Highness.

83
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:53,879
This servant looked after the children today.

84
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,000
I found them so adorable.

85
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,080
They're noisy and lively.

86
00:03:58,479 --> 00:03:59,879
They really are a bit rowdy.

87
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:00,960
But,

88
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,080
watching them play makes this servant happy.

89
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,039
They're so full of life.

90
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,120
Your Highness.

91
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:08,479
If only you had your own child.

92
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:11,039
This servant would take great care of them.

93
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,400
This servant spoke out of turn.

94
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,240
This servant spoke out of turn.

95
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:20,639
It's alright.

96
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:25,600
How you hold a child is very important.

97
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:29,920
First, place your right thumb and index under the child's neck.

98
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,480
Then, slide your left forearm under their bottom.

99
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,160
Support them from underneath.

100
00:04:36,519 --> 00:04:38,199
Of course, protect their hands and feet.

101
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:40,040
Lift them up steadily.

102
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,319
This way, you protect their spine

103
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,199
and keep their head safe.

104
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,399
Alright.

105
00:04:46,519 --> 00:04:47,839
Everything I've taught you

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,120
is now finished.

107
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,480
Practice on your own.

108
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,000
Where are you going?

109
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,240
I need to visit the House of ease.

110
00:05:03,560 --> 00:05:04,639
Don't be in such a rush.

111
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,199
Forget it.

112
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,959
Second Prince, why are you in such a hurry?

113
00:05:06,959 --> 00:05:07,399
Let me do it.

114
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,759
I can, I can.

115
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:09,600
I can.

116
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,720
Let me do it instead.

117
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,079
I can handle it.

118
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,319
I'll do it.

119
00:05:16,759 --> 00:05:17,319
You do it.

120
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:19,000
Better if you do it.

121
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,040
I'll go take a look.

122
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:36,920
Such a top-notch handsome dad,

123
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,839
who wouldn't be smitten?

124
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,680
But I have to leave in the end.

125
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:44,120
My mission is the Crown Prince,

126
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,399
not the Second Prince.

127
00:05:45,959 --> 00:05:47,279
Even if we fall in love,

128
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,399
what difference does it make?

129
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:50,519
All of this

130
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,519
isn't real.

131
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,920
I like you.

132
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,120
What about you?

133
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,240
I do.

134
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:00,959
Of course I like you.

135
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:19,920
Brother Zi Heng

136
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:20,879
Why are you here?

137
00:06:22,079 --> 00:06:23,040
Brother Zi Heng

138
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:25,560
Fu Kang was impulsive a few days ago.

139
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:27,560
I've thought it over.

140
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,399
I also made some mistakes.

141
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,519
I wonder if I can make it up.

142
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,680
No need.

143
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:35,759
Fu Kang

144
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:38,040
I just ask you not to hurt Xue Niang.

145
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,920
She means a lot to me.

146
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:45,920
Brother Zi Heng, I'm sorry.

147
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,879
I truly know I was wrong.

148
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:50,519
It's only because I like you.

149
00:06:50,519 --> 00:06:52,720
That's why I felt hostile toward Xue Niang.

150
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,839
But now I understand.

151
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,639
If I want you to like me,

152
00:06:56,879 --> 00:06:59,720
I must first accept what you care about.

153
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:00,800
I've made up my mind.

154
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:03,879
I want to do something for the Health Care Center.

155
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:05,680
Alright.

156
00:07:06,519 --> 00:07:07,120
You want to sleep.

157
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,040
Then go ahead and sleep.

158
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:09,839
I'll go check the accounts.

159
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,639
Brother Zi Heng, I'll go with you.

160
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,800
No need.

161
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,920
Brother Zi Heng is afraid of bugs.

162
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:02,600
Why are you here?

163
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,480
Fu Kang brought Your Highness a calming soup.

164
00:08:09,399 --> 00:08:10,759
I'm not drinking that.

165
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:13,120
Who knows if you put something in it?

166
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,000
Auntie Kang

167
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,160
Feed it to the dog.

168
00:08:16,439 --> 00:08:17,439
Yes.

169
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:21,000
I heard from my father

170
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
that you advised His Majesty to cut the army and salaries.

171
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,000
As a consort,

172
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,399
you meddle in state affairs.

173
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,959
What's your motive?

174
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:34,120
What do state affairs have to do with you?

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,919
Afraid I'll ruin your father's plans?

176
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,480
Your Highness

177
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,000
Don't think carrying the Dragon Seed makes you invincible.

178
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,279
Be careful it backfires.

179
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,639
Don't worry.

180
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,720
The child in my belly

181
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,799
is perfectly healthy.
