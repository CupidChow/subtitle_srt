1
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
This Xue Niang

2
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,200
Can this be fixed? What's wrong?

3
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,719
Come see what you've done.

4
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:38,560
My hair is almost all gone.

5
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:41,200
How can I face His Majesty now?

6
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,439
Xue Niang

7
00:00:43,159 --> 00:00:43,840
Come with me.

8
00:00:44,799 --> 00:00:45,679
Yes.

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,159
What's going on?

10
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:53,280
What did you use to wash it?

11
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,159
My shampoo

12
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,479
is made from all-natural ingredients.

13
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,520
Meilan and I used it too.

14
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,880
It wasn't this bad.

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,920
Your Highness

16
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,039
It's recorded in ancient texts.

17
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:05,280
After childbirth, bathing is strictly forbidden.

18
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,920
And her shampoo smells unusually strong.

19
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,480
Who knows what she used?

20
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
She doesn't know anything.

21
00:01:12,599 --> 00:01:15,680
She even dares to open a Health Care Center,
spreading fallacies.

22
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:23,519
Calm down.

23
00:01:26,599 --> 00:01:28,159
She was punished for this.

24
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,040
Why are your legs still shaking?

25
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,400
Consort Leng

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,280
Such a serious mistake

27
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,200
Squat until evening before getting up.

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,439
Your Highness, I take my leave.

29
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,439
Did I scare you?

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,400
I'm fine.

31
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,200
You were wronged this time.

32
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:09,080
Wei Ziheng is investigating the shampoo.

33
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,120
If someone did this on purpose,

34
00:02:11,199 --> 00:02:12,520
I will clear your name.

35
00:02:13,039 --> 00:02:14,639
How is Lady Xu?

36
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,919
Lady Xu is calm now.

37
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:19,719
She's playing with Princess Yue'er.

38
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,479
That's a relief.

39
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,319
Are you tired?

40
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,719
Keep going!

41
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:38,120
Brother Ziheng

42
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,120
Do you like my new dress?

43
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:48,080
Aren't you cold?

44
00:02:55,439 --> 00:02:56,439
I...

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,400
I came to play with you.

46
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:06,000
You came at the right time.

47
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,319
I just have something to ask you.

48
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,479
Do you recognize this?

49
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,599
Why are you asking me?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:15,719
If you won't say,

51
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:17,960
then I'll tell you.

52
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,840
This is Qilin Fruit residue.

53
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,759
When Qilin Fruit and Five-Spice Seed
are used together,

54
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:24,479
what happens?

55
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,560
You know better than I do.

56
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:29,120
I-I don't know what you mean.

57
00:03:29,479 --> 00:03:31,000
You made Lady Xu suffer.

58
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,960
You got Xue Niang punished.

59
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,759
It's always about Xue Niang.

60
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,039
She deserves it.

61
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,159
Fu Kang

62
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,159
You're kind at heart.

63
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,199
Stop being so stubborn.

64
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:41,919
You're the Second Prince.

65
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,080
Yet you defend her.

66
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:46,360
What did she give you to charm you?

67
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:47,919
If this happens again,

68
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,240
I'll report it to Father.

69
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:54,800
It's getting cold.

70
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:56,639
Put your clothes on properly.

71
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,360
Consort Leng

72
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,000
Is Lady Xu alright today?

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,800
Why are you still wearing that?

74
00:04:25,519 --> 00:04:26,439
Take it off.

75
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:28,480
I forgot.

76
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,160
Lady Xu went for a nap.

77
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,680
I've already told her

78
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:35,240
this has nothing to do with you.

79
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,360
She shouldn't get too emotional.

80
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,439
You were wronged this time.

81
00:04:47,319 --> 00:04:49,399
Such a mistake at work

82
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,439
is my fault.

83
00:04:51,079 --> 00:04:51,720
I accept the punishment.

84
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,560
As for Fu Kang,

85
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,079
I'll have someone keep an eye on him.

86
00:04:56,279 --> 00:04:57,240
Don't worry, Your Highness.

87
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:00,439
The safety of the ladies and children
is most important.

88
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,160
I won't cause any trouble.

89
00:05:02,879 --> 00:05:04,600
I'm glad you think that way.

90
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,399
The item you wanted

91
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:13,279
I've brought it for you.

92
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:14,759
Bought from Yanhuayou Lane.

93
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,680
It works very well.

94
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,959
No one saw you, right?

95
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,000
No one saw me.

96
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,199
First Prince, what a coincidence.

97
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,519
Where are you headed?

98
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
Xue Niang asked to meet me.

99
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:34,040
It must be something important
this late.

100
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:36,160
To discuss wood carving business.

101
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,160
First Prince, be careful to avoid suspicion.

102
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:40,839
Thank you, Imperial Physician Fu Kang.

103
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,680
Then about this matter,

104
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,480
you must keep it secret for me.

105
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:46,680
Otherwise,

106
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:48,560
meeting Xue Niang at night,

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,360
if other ladies see it,

108
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:53,439
there will be jealousy again.

109
00:05:54,279 --> 00:05:55,399
That's for sure.

110
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:57,720
I'm leaving.

111
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:15,879
Brother

112
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,160
Second Brother

113
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,040
Why are you here so late?

114
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,519
And you're here, Brother...

115
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,120
This Xue Niang

116
00:06:27,959 --> 00:06:29,240
asked me to discuss wood carving business.

117
00:06:30,279 --> 00:06:30,879
And also

118
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,160
have some tea.

119
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,680
This Xue Niang treats me...

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,040
She asked you to discuss business
so late,

121
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:46,439
and have tea too.

122
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:47,920
These matters between men and women

123
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:49,160
you don't understand.

124
00:06:49,399 --> 00:06:52,120
My relationship with Xue Niang

125
00:06:53,959 --> 00:06:54,680
After all,

126
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
First Prince

127
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,439
You're here.

128
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,279
Someone from your palace is here.

129
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,680
The premium redwood you ordered
has arrived at the palace gate.

130
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:03,800
They want you to inspect it.

131
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,680
It arrived so quickly.

132
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,279
Ziheng

133
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,360
So,

134
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,519
please tell Xue Niang for me

135
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,399
I'll have tea with her tomorrow.

136
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:16,240
After all,

137
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,399
a man must put his career first.

138
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:19,519
Let's go.

139
00:07:32,959 --> 00:07:33,600
Second Prince

140
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:34,560
Why are you here?

141
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160
I brought you fried chicken.

142
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:45,360
Let's eat inside.

143
00:07:48,439 --> 00:07:49,759
You read my mind.

144
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,560
I was just craving fried chicken.

145
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,279
The children are all asleep now.

146
00:07:54,079 --> 00:07:54,680
Let's eat together.

147
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,680
Speaking of which,

148
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,199
you have fine tea.

149
00:08:06,279 --> 00:08:07,720
Why ask the First Prince to taste it?

150
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,680
You're a young lady,

151
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:10,759
shouldn't you avoid suspicion?

152
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,519
What fine tea?

153
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,839
I didn't invite your brother.

154
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,639
That wretched maid!

155
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,720
Let's see you seduce Brother Ziheng now!

156
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,759
Bowel and urine are both fine.

157
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:40,960
Concubine Xin's child is the healthiest.

158
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:43,000
What's wrong?

159
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:48,440
What's wrong with you?

160
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,399
Why is this door locked?

161
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:02,320
Wei Ziheng!

162
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,399
Are you feeling unwell?

163
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,879
Are you okay?

164
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,240
So hot...

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:07,519
Hot...

166
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,120
Why is it so hot?

167
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,039
This tea...

168
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,440
There's something wrong with this tea.

169
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,440
The tea is off.

170
00:09:17,639 --> 00:09:18,759
This isn't my tea.

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,080
This isn't your tea?

172
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:26,039
This plot is way too intense!

173
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,000
Wei Ziheng!

174
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,240
Are you feeling unwell now?

175
00:09:31,799 --> 00:09:32,440
Xue Niang!

176
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:33,519
Don't come any closer!

177
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:34,480
Okay, okay, okay.

178
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,320
I won't come closer.

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:41,879
Wei Ziheng!

180
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:42,639
Water...

181
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:44,960
You're undressing way too fast!

182
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,720
Xue Niang!

183
00:09:51,679 --> 00:09:52,519
No, no, no!

184
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,159
Calm down, calm down!

185
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,720
This is too much!

186
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,200
Maybe I should...

187
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,480
I'll just savor the night.

188
00:10:02,559 --> 00:10:03,639
Enjoy the moment.
