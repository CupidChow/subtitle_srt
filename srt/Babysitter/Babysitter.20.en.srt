1
00:00:43,359 --> 00:00:44,320
First Prince

2
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:46,280
What do you need from me?

3
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:47,880
You...

4
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,000
Xue Niang

5
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,159
For the woodcarving business,

6
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,159
I've already bid farewell to Father.

7
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,240
I'm heading south to start my own venture.

8
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:59,520
Jiangnan is a comfortable place.

9
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,840
The climate is just right.

10
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:03,280
The scenery is nice, too.

11
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,159
Starting a business right after New Year.

12
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,079
I'm learning from you.

13
00:01:09,319 --> 00:01:10,239
See?

14
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,640
I went home and got nothing.

15
00:01:13,599 --> 00:01:15,519
The best wood from the Imperial Garden,

16
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,640
Father wouldn't give me any.

17
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:19,719
Besides,

18
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:22,359
With your current status,

19
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,840
Zi Heng and I

20
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,519
will have to call you Mother Consort.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,879
That title makes me feel old.

22
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:35,680
Father is still Father.

23
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:37,000
An arm

24
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,519
can never twist a thigh.

25
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,959
And life in the palace

26
00:01:47,519 --> 00:01:48,519
is something I can't get used to.

27
00:01:49,359 --> 00:01:49,760
I'm leaving.

28
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:56,959
First Prince

29
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,599
First Prince, fly bravely!

30
00:02:01,599 --> 00:02:03,359
Meilan, I will always be with you.

31
00:02:03,359 --> 00:02:05,120
First Prince, fly bravely!

32
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,000
Meilan, I will always be with you.

33
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,759
First Prince, fly bravely!

34
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:10,759
Meilan, I will always be with you.

35
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:14,240
First Prince flies bravely, Xue Niang stays forever.

36
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:17,000
Farewell.

37
00:02:34,439 --> 00:02:35,199
Zi Heng

38
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,039
Why are you here?

39
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,039
Xue Niang

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,479
You don't want to be Beauty Xue,

41
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,439
right?

42
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:48,560
Of course.

43
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:50,400
I definitely don't want to.

44
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,680
Come with me.

45
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,280
Where to?

46
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,680
We'll head south together,

47
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,919
pass Dongxi,

48
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:07,759
Nanchuan,

49
00:03:07,759 --> 00:03:08,479
then reach Haibei.

50
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,319
We'll leave the capital far behind.

51
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,120
Okay?

52
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,560
Xue Niang,

53
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:19,639
I'll protect you.

54
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,159
Let's elope.

55
00:03:34,479 --> 00:03:36,000
Even if it's a dead end,

56
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,360
I still want the life I choose.

57
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:41,360
As long as I'm with you,

58
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,719
no place is a dead end.

59
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,319
Where are we going?

60
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:58,360
Fu Kang

61
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,520
Please let us go.

62
00:04:04,199 --> 00:04:05,520
How dare you, Xue Niang!

63
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,080
A lowly maid dares seduce a prince.

64
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,520
Seize her!

65
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:09,960
Yes.

66
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,519
It was all Xue Niang's idea.

67
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,079
Zi Heng is innocent.

68
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:24,079
Xue Niang urged Zi Heng to leave the palace.

69
00:04:24,079 --> 00:04:26,399
Who knows what sweet talk she used.

70
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:27,399
Father

71
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,399
Silence!

72
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,000
Xue Niang

73
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,879
I am deeply disappointed in you.

74
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:36,920
Your Majesty, it was all my idea.

75
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,000
It has nothing to do with the Second Prince.

76
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,319
From today on,

77
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,600
neither of you may go anywhere.

78
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:44,839
Wait for the wedding day.

79
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:50,800
I think tomorrow is a good day.

80
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,000
Why not

81
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:54,079
set the wedding for tomorrow?

82
00:04:54,279 --> 00:04:55,079
Your Majesty, Father

83
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,639
I and Xue Niang,

84
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,199
Zi Heng and Fu Kang,

85
00:05:10,959 --> 00:05:12,399
will marry together.

86
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:16,240
Your Majesty is wise.

87
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,199
Respectfully seeing off Your Majesty.

88
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:54,600
Xue Niang

89
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,040
Ladies

90
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
Xue Niang

91
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:03,120
Dumplings for arrival, noodles for departure.

92
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,079
Go ahead and eat.

93
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:07,399
Noble Consort An

94
00:06:08,079 --> 00:06:09,759
This is your favorite chicken leg.

95
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,480
There's plenty.

96
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,519
I remember

97
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,439
this is your favorite dessert.

98
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,279
Xue Mei Niang

99
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,040
Eat your fill, then have some fruit.

100
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,040
Ladies

101
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,319
I thought the ending would be different.

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,879
But in the end,

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,360
it's all the same.

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:42,920
Alright.

105
00:06:43,959 --> 00:06:45,079
Then today,

106
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,199
I'll eat myself to death.

107
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:32,800
Loosen it for me, let me relax.

108
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,519
My Lady

109
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,600
Be careful with everything.

110
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,240
If someone finds out about this belly, it'll be trouble.

111
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,959
I'm in my room, what am I afraid of?

112
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,319
Watching Xue Niang eat made me hungry too.

113
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:43,279
Go get me something to eat.

114
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,120
Noble Consort An

115
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:55,480
You...

116
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:57,000
You've finished eating.

117
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:59,079
No need to hide it.

118
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,680
I've known for a long time.

119
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:05,839
This...

120
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:06,800
is for you.

121
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,199
This is...

122
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,240
Counting the days,

123
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:13,079
you should be four months pregnant now.

124
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,959
After a while,

125
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,480
that one won't work anymore.

126
00:08:17,079 --> 00:08:17,879
From now on,

127
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:19,920
use mine instead.

128
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,600
My Lady

129
00:08:27,160 --> 00:08:28,160
Take my advice.

130
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,959
Fake is always fake.

131
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,559
You need to plan for your future.

132
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:33,799
Xue Niang

133
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,000
If I'm found out this time,

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,279
I'm really done for.

135
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:41,559
Noble Consort An

136
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,600
Consort Leng is frail,

137
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,320
and Bing'er is still young.

138
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:48,960
After I leave,

139
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:53,200
please take good care of her for me.

140
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:57,120
Even now,

141
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,639
you're still worried about others.

142
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,559
When you become Beauty Xue,

143
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,600
we can all come back and play together.

144
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,240
I won't be coming back.

145
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:16,399
Don't worry.

146
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,080
I will definitely help you.

147
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,000
Thank you.
