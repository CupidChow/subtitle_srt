1
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,000
Why does this taste so good?

2
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:40,799
Yeah.

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:41,719
It's so sweet.

4
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:43,399
I even lost money because of it.

5
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:46,240
Today I must catch you, Milk Thief Ghost.

6
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:48,119
Xue Niang.

7
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,840
Are you sure Noble Consort An did it?

8
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,240
Besides her,

9
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,520
who else would go against our Health Care Center?

10
00:01:37,599 --> 00:01:38,439
Your Majesty.

11
00:01:38,719 --> 00:01:40,519
Please stand up for me, Your Majesty.

12
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:41,959
This wretched maid

13
00:01:42,239 --> 00:01:43,760
always scares me in the middle of the night.

14
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:47,359
She doesn't want your child to be well, Your Majesty.

15
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,400
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:48,519 --> 00:01:50,200
Replace her for me.

17
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:51,480
I just

18
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:57,159
want to catch the Milk Thief Ghost.

19
00:01:57,359 --> 00:01:58,079
Your Majesty.

20
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,920
Our Lady was frightened.

21
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:00,959
Her whole body aches.

22
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,560
She can't even sleep at night.

23
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,840
It's really pitiful. Yes.

24
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:07,920
Punish.

25
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,080
Your Majesty.

26
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,599
I failed to discipline her properly.

27
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:12,639
I

28
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:13,680
am willing to accept punishment.

29
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:14,800
No.

30
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,840
I alone will bear the consequences.

31
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,560
It has nothing to do with anyone else.

32
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,840
If you must punish, punish only me.

33
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,919
Then I'll punish you alone.

34
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,120
Your Majesty.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,960
I have a headache, Your Majesty.

36
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:25,759
Your Majesty.

37
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,439
This matter—

38
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,800
Let's not talk about it anymore.

39
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:29,240
Xue Niang.

40
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,000
You alone will receive twenty strokes of the cane.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,240
Go accept your punishment. Go now.

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,319
Yes.

43
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:45,280
Does it hurt a lot?

44
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,560
Imperial Physician Fu Kang has examined you.

45
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,879
There's nothing for me to check here.

46
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,000
No need for treatment.

47
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,439
If not, why let her examine you?

48
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:56,919
I...

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,120
I got this from the most effective master.

50
00:03:10,199 --> 00:03:10,919
Take it.

51
00:03:11,319 --> 00:03:12,240
It will protect you.

52
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,680
Amulet.

53
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,080
You believe in ghosts too?

54
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,280
I believe in you.

55
00:03:18,639 --> 00:03:19,360
It's just...

56
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,000
I waited in line for ages in heavy rain.

57
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,199
I bought many other charms too.

58
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,759
Only then did he agree to sell it to me.

59
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:27,599
I didn't expect

60
00:03:28,719 --> 00:03:30,840
even this needs to be bundled.

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,639
Just take it.

62
00:03:35,759 --> 00:03:36,599
For peace of mind.

63
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:38,840
Thank you.

64
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,120
I'll apply medicine for you.

65
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,120
Ow, ow, ow!

66
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:55,599
You're not the only one working here.

67
00:03:56,240 --> 00:03:57,639
In this situation,

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:03:59,520
your health matters most.

69
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:12,719
I won.

70
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:15,960
Lady, you're amazing.

71
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,560
Lady.

72
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:20,879
According to The Red Booklet's pregnancy tips,

73
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:23,279
you can't eat these sugary fruits anymore.

74
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:24,600
Are you stupid?

75
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,920
I'm not maintaining any fake pregnancy.

76
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,399
Lady.

77
00:04:27,839 --> 00:04:29,879
Aren't you afraid of the Milk Thief Ghost?

78
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:30,920
Why should I be afraid?

79
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,519
Imperial Physician Fu Kang is back.

80
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,040
Our lie

81
00:04:34,759 --> 00:04:36,399
won't last much longer.

82
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,759
Ghosts aren't scary.

83
00:04:40,279 --> 00:04:41,600
People are scarier.

84
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,879
Noble Consort.

85
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:47,079
You'd better think of a solution quickly.

86
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,120
If His Majesty finds out,

87
00:04:49,279 --> 00:04:50,680
we could lose our heads.

88
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,759
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

89
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,759
We must let them keep running the Health Care Center.

90
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:59,839
Spirits above, spirits below,

91
00:04:59,839 --> 00:05:04,240
Guanyin Bodhisattva, please show your power.

92
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,920
Bless the Cold Palace with safety.

93
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,839
Guanyin Bodhisattva blesses the Cold Palace—what are you doing?

94
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,720
I...

95
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,439
Xue Niang.

96
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,360
What happened to your face?

97
00:05:21,959 --> 00:05:23,720
It's all thanks to Noble Consort An.

98
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,399
So what should we do?

99
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,439
Are we still putting Consort Leng's milk in tonight?

100
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:31,680
Of course.

101
00:05:31,839 --> 00:05:32,600
Definitely.

102
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:34,800
And let everyone know we did.

103
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,040
But it's just the two of us.

104
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,240
How do we catch the ghost?

105
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,439
Of course, it's someone pretending to be a ghost.

106
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:04,319
Oh my god, my eyes!

107
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,480
A person!

108
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:16,839
Why do you suddenly want to find Fu Kang?

109
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,240
Do you need something from her?

110
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:19,680
I have something to return to her.

111
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:21,279
What is it?

112
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,800
Imperial Physician Fu Kang.

113
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,079
What a coincidence.

114
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,759
Brother Ziheng.

115
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,079
Fu Kang.

116
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,399
We were just talking about you.

117
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:37,360
How have you been lately?

118
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,879
Thank you for your concern, Brother Ziheng.

119
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,879
I've been busy studying medicine and writing prescriptions.

120
00:06:46,519 --> 00:06:48,079
I've become so haggard.

121
00:06:48,399 --> 00:06:49,639
Is it your turn to speak?

122
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:52,560
Today, I

123
00:06:52,759 --> 00:06:54,319
at the cellar entrance,

124
00:06:54,399 --> 00:06:56,560
found an earring.

125
00:06:57,079 --> 00:06:57,879
Please see

126
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,600
if it's yours.

127
00:07:02,519 --> 00:07:04,360
No, it's not.

128
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,480
But it really looks like yours to me.

129
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,600
I said it's not.

130
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,720
Brother Ziheng.

131
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,279
It's not mine.

132
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,560
Then maybe I was mistaken.

133
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,160
Imperial Physician Fu Kang.

134
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,040
Go where you should go.

135
00:07:25,279 --> 00:07:26,360
Don't go where you shouldn't.

136
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:27,720
Stay away.

137
00:07:28,519 --> 00:07:29,600
So you don't get hurt.

138
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:33,000
Are you telling me how to do my job?

139
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,720
I wouldn't dare.

140
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:38,079
I just wanted to remind Imperial Physician Fu Kang.

141
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,959
Where the breast milk is kept

142
00:07:40,439 --> 00:07:41,560
is prone to ghostly trouble.

143
00:08:06,199 --> 00:08:07,279
You really found it in the cellar

144
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:08,439
and picked up Fu Kang's earring?

145
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,160
Of course I was bluffing her.

146
00:08:17,519 --> 00:08:18,639
But next,

147
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:19,720
Health Care Center

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:20,959
won't be haunted anymore.

149
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,759
Fu Kang isn't truly bad at heart.

150
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,519
She was probably just being playful.

151
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:26,439
Playful?

152
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,160
What do you mean by that?

153
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:29,480
Fu Kang does know medicine.

154
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:31,040
Father has high hopes for her.

155
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:33,279
This incident involves General Fu again.

156
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:34,720
If Father finds out,

157
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,080
it'll get very troublesome.

158
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,039
I worked so hard to catch the real culprit,

159
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,399
and you're still defending that schemer.

160
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,679
The Empress and the children being safe is what matters.

161
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,320
You...

162
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm too lazy to talk to a guy like you.

163
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:50,159
I'm leaving.

164
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
The ghost is gone,

165
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:08,200
but the ladies aren't coming back.

166
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,679
My Health Care Center can't last much longer.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,799
Can't last much longer...

168
00:09:13,799 --> 00:09:15,720
Then what about our package?

169
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,120
Your Highnesses,

170
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,799
Ladies,

171
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,399
why did you come back?

172
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:25,879
Refund me, then I'll pay you back.

173
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,320
If there's another haunting,

174
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,480
I want double compensation.

175
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:30,919
I want my package upgraded.

176
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:34,399
Noble Consort An's mattress looks pretty good to me.

177
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:37,600
Rest assured, Your Highnesses.

178
00:09:37,759 --> 00:09:39,600
I swear on my head to you both.

179
00:09:39,679 --> 00:09:41,559
There will never be another haunting.

180
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:44,519
So what are you giving me?

181
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:48,399
Noble Consort An

182
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,200
Noble Consort An invited us back.

183
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,440
She said the Health Care Center misses us.

184
00:09:52,559 --> 00:09:53,759
It's not lively.

185
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,159
Playing mahjong and such,

186
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,840
it's liveliest here.

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,120
I'll let you stay with me for now.

188
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes, yes.

189
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,360
We promised Noble Consort An we'd play mahjong.

190
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,720
We'll play mahjong as promised.
