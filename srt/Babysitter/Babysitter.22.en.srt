1
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:31,440
Fu Kang is here.

2
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,799
Good, good, you came at the right time.

3
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:34,399
Quick, help We take a look.

4
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:36,840
Noble Consort An, is your belly well?

5
00:00:45,359 --> 00:00:46,280
What do you want?

6
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:54,679
We's child.

7
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,799
We's child.

8
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,039
Your Majesty.

9
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,840
Noble Consort An was never pregnant.

10
00:01:06,319 --> 00:01:07,519
It was all fake.

11
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,000
Fake belly, fake child.

12
00:01:16,359 --> 00:01:17,239
Xue Niang.

13
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Helped Noble Consort An hide her fake pregnancy.

14
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:26,920
Please punish severely to set an example.

15
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:27,959
Your Majesty.

16
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,159
It was all my idea alone.

17
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,519
It has nothing to do with Noble Consort An.

18
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,319
Shut up.

19
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:36,719
You all...

20
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:40,879
How dare you!

21
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,040
You dare joke about We's royal son?

22
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,159
Noble Consort An.

23
00:01:48,439 --> 00:01:51,319
House arrest, reflect on yourself.

24
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,959
Demoted to Beauty An.

25
00:01:56,480 --> 00:01:57,760
Xue Niang.

26
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:01,599
Also Snow Beauty.

27
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:03,920
Thrown into prison.

28
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,719
Guards!

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,000
Zi Heng.

30
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:50,199
Xue Niang.

31
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,080
Xue Niang, are you alright?

32
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:52,919
I'm fine.

33
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,039
Get in.

34
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,240
Xue Niang.

35
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:02,240
Zi Heng.

36
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,400
Xue Niang.

37
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,120
Zi Heng.

38
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:05,680
Xue Niang.

39
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,199
Xue Niang, are you alright?

40
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:11,360
I'm fine.

41
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,319
Silly, you aren't hurt, are you?

42
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:15,599
I'm fine.

43
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:16,960
That's good.

44
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:19,199
Let me see you quickly.

45
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:36,039
Doomed lovers facing death—

46
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:38,479
How dramatic.

47
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,719
Fu Kang.

48
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,560
If you hate me, come at me.

49
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:42,919
Don't drag Xue Niang into this.

50
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,759
I hate her more than I hate you.

51
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:57,800
I'll make your deaths as miserable as possible.

52
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,520
Wei Zi Heng.

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,439
I'll make you regret it.

54
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,319
You don't think she'll survive this prison,

55
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:08,639
and make it out alive, do you?

56
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,960
Just wait to die.

57
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:11,560
Xue Niang.

58
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,199
Are you scared?

59
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,480
I...

60
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,879
I'm staying optimistic.

61
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:23,319
It's more humid than the maternity center.

62
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:24,800
Great for moisturizing.

63
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,439
My skin's gotten softer.

64
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,720
Even now,

65
00:05:32,439 --> 00:05:33,879
you can still joke?

66
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,040
I'm scared.

67
00:05:40,839 --> 00:05:41,959
I'm afraid of losing you.

68
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:48,600
Xue Niang.

69
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,240
No matter what happens,

70
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,720
I'll protect you.

71
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,720
You're in prison too.

72
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,199
How will you protect me?

73
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,160
Zi Heng.

74
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,240
Maybe staying here

75
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:10,480
is our best ending.

76
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:12,920
No matter what happens,

77
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,240
I won't leave you.

78
00:06:20,079 --> 00:06:21,000
I trust you.

79
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,680
Insolence!

80
00:06:32,959 --> 00:06:36,480
The memorial says he rules city affairs.

81
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,839
Ridiculous.

82
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:39,920
Does We look like a decoration?

83
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,839
Guards!

84
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:45,160
Demote General Fu to Captain.

85
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,759
Entry to the palace is forbidden without a summons.

86
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,319
Yes.

87
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,839
How did I end up here by accident?

88
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,959
I know my mistake.

89
00:07:07,959 --> 00:07:08,519
I shouldn't have...

90
00:07:08,519 --> 00:07:09,439
Enough, enough, enough.

91
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,000
Princess Yao Yao.

92
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,519
Peace to Father Emperor.

93
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,720
Why is the princess here?

94
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:19,480
I came to see my siblings.

95
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,959
And chase butterflies.

96
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,600
Chasing butterflies too?

97
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,680
Princess Yao Yao is so smart and tall now.

98
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Noble Consort said the same last time.

99
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,040
She always talks to me for a long time.

100
00:07:32,839 --> 00:07:34,000
Princess misspoke.

101
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,800
It's Beauty An, Beauty An.

102
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,560
Father Emperor.

103
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:41,199
Why did Noble Consort become a Beauty?

104
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
A maid said Noble Consort can't have children.

105
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,240
So you don't like her anymore?

106
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,839
Nonsense!

107
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,160
Who is spouting nonsense here?

108
00:07:50,959 --> 00:07:52,480
Spare me, Your Majesty! Spare me!

109
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,519
Father Emperor isn't like that.

110
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:58,160
Father likes Noble Consort, child or not.

111
00:07:58,160 --> 00:07:58,639
That's right.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,759
Princess Yao Yao is right.

113
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,199
So well-behaved.

114
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,680
Your Majesty.

115
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,000
I'll escort the princess out now.

116
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,639
You

117
00:09:08,559 --> 00:09:10,080
Will you not speak to We
anymore?

118
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,759
What else is there
to say?

119
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,679
Are you resenting We?

120
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,799
I do wish I could resent you.

121
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,960
Resent you for your sincerity
at the start.

122
00:09:20,639 --> 00:09:22,279
Resent you for your kind hopes
for me.

123
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,279
Xiao An

124
00:09:24,519 --> 00:09:25,879
You only wanted
a child.

125
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,200
How could you care
about me?

126
00:09:29,799 --> 00:09:30,440
Then...

127
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:32,440
Then why would We
still come here?

128
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:34,759
Ever since I told you
I was pregnant,

129
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,960
Whether I was gentle
or willful,

130
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,919
You became much
more patient with me.

131
00:09:41,639 --> 00:09:42,519
I know.

132
00:09:43,559 --> 00:09:44,639
You do not love me.

133
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,039
It is because I have
this child.

134
00:09:47,919 --> 00:09:48,639
Xiao An

135
00:09:49,080 --> 00:09:50,200
It is not like that.

136
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,000
It has been so many years.

137
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,840
We could have chosen
not to have this child.

138
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:56,600
But that was because
you told We

139
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:59,519
that you were carrying
this child.

140
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:01,399
That is why We
were even happier.

141
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,399
Your Majesty,
no need to explain.

142
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:04,879
This is the Cold Palace.

143
00:10:05,799 --> 00:10:06,720
Please leave.

144
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,120
Xiao An

145
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:09,919
Xiao An

146
00:10:10,679 --> 00:10:11,639
Listen to We.

147
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:13,039
We know.

148
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:14,960
Without this child,

149
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,799
your heart aches
a hundred times more than We's.

150
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,519
We truly neglected you
all these years.

151
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,039
But now We know
We were wrong.

152
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,360
We have thought it through.

153
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,720
From now on,

154
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,120
We will stay
by your side.

155
00:10:27,919 --> 00:10:28,960
You will not be
alone anymore.

156
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,519
Is that alright?

157
00:10:32,879 --> 00:10:33,399
Xiao An

158
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:35,120
Xiao An

159
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:39,240
Don't cry anymore.

160
00:10:41,039 --> 00:10:41,879
We will stay
by your side.
