1
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:32,399
The Emperor actually wants something new.

2
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,039
Everyone, think of some good ideas.

3
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,359
Let Lady Xu perform the Startled Swan Dance.

4
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,399
The Emperor loves that the most.

5
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,759
He's seen that so many times already.

6
00:00:43,759 --> 00:00:46,039
The Emperor lost interest long ago.

7
00:00:46,439 --> 00:00:49,359
Past celebrations were for royal relatives.

8
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,200
Can we do something different this year?

9
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,479
Let the palace staff who can't go home join in.

10
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,799
With the Emperor's protection,

11
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:56,119
they'll feel much warmer.

12
00:00:56,119 --> 00:00:57,399
And work even harder next year.

13
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Makes sense.

14
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:00,479
So, tell me—

15
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,000
what should we eat?

16
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,799
Your Highnesses,

17
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:08,680
Or else,

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,560
let's make something the Emperor hasn't seen.

19
00:01:14,519 --> 00:01:16,640
I have a bad feeling about this.

20
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,680
Southern ostrich with branches stuck in it.

21
00:01:21,719 --> 00:01:22,680
What kind of dish is that?

22
00:01:23,319 --> 00:01:24,040
Ziyue.

23
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,640
Is this the New Year's dinner you prepared for We?

24
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,959
Why put branches in it for New Year's?

25
00:01:29,239 --> 00:01:30,200
And Ziheng,

26
00:01:30,359 --> 00:01:32,280
everything you ordered is spicy.

27
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,120
We told you, We don't eat spicy food.

28
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:36,120
We don't eat spicy food.

29
00:01:37,120 --> 00:01:40,040
We want to comfort the palace staff.

30
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,719
We want a New Year's dinner that's different.

31
00:01:45,319 --> 00:01:47,879
We want all our subjects

32
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:50,040
to laugh heartily,

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,159
feel happy and content.

34
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:55,239
Make them truly feel

35
00:01:55,239 --> 00:01:57,719
this year was worth it.

36
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:00,319
Next year will be even better.

37
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,040
And you two—

38
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,280
what kind of menu is this?

39
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,920
Will this idea meet their expectations?

40
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,400
You two

41
00:02:13,479 --> 00:02:14,719
are both useless.

42
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:21,840
Ziheng.

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,000
Did you understand what the Emperor wants?

44
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,240
I only understood what he doesn't want.

45
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,000
Your Highnesses,

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,520
move your arms and legs first.

47
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:32,280
Here, Your Highness Leng,

48
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,560
you're doing fine.

49
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:34,560
Believe in yourself.

50
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,039
Show the feeling of the Startled Swan Dance.

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,639
Startled Swan, yes, that's it.

52
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:41,080
Add some of your opera moves, add a bit more.

53
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Highness An,

54
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:42,840
this is yours.

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Are you sure the Emperor likes this?

56
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,560
I'm sure.

57
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,520
The Emperor looks like he loves girl groups.

58
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,360
Let's get started.

59
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,479
Let me walk everyone through the moves.

60
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,120
The first move is—

61
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,680
The Emperor has very high standards for food.

62
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:43,000
We've searched for the best imperial chefs everywhere.

63
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,199
He still isn't satisfied.

64
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,599
Let's try thinking from another angle.

65
00:03:50,759 --> 00:03:53,560
If you were the Emperor,

66
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,080
what would you want to eat most?

67
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,560
There's plenty of imperial food in the palace.

68
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,879
But think carefully—

69
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,560
maybe you'd just want a taste of home.

70
00:04:03,199 --> 00:04:04,280
Home-style dishes.

71
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:07,120
What's the first home dish that comes to mind?

72
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,680
Got some ideas now?

73
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,400
I know a place

74
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,959
that'll make your face flush and heart race,

75
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,199
get your blood pumping,

76
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,639
and make you sweat.

77
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,199
Candied hawthorn.

78
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:26,319
Sir, look—candied hawthorn.

79
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,279
How much is this?

80
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,319
Miss, you can try it.

81
00:04:28,319 --> 00:04:29,480
Eat as much as you like.

82
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:30,680
I'll have this one.

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,480
Thank you.

84
00:04:32,319 --> 00:04:34,319
The good place you mentioned is the food street.

85
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:34,920
That's right.

86
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,079
Ideas just burst out like crazy.

87
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,439
Sugar figurines.

88
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,199
Boss, how much for this sugar figurine?

89
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:41,839
Ten wen.

90
00:04:42,279 --> 00:04:42,959
Boss,

91
00:04:42,959 --> 00:04:44,720
make one shaped like this gentleman.

92
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:45,360
Sure.

93
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,199
Wait a second.

94
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,439
Sir,

95
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:51,639
It's too expensive, spend money wisely.

96
00:04:52,319 --> 00:04:53,720
You look good in men's clothes.

97
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,399
Then today I'm your male attendant.

98
00:05:00,399 --> 00:05:03,600
Sir, let's look for places with free samples.

99
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:04,240
Okay.

100
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:07,959
Boss, make one for me.

101
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:08,920
Alright, come back to pick it up later.

102
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,160
Can I try this one?

103
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,360
Yes, yes, free samples.

104
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:14,879
It's free.

105
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,959
Right, give me a skewer.

106
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:16,720
Alright.

107
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:27,319
Boss,

108
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:30,920
This wood looks ordinary,

109
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,639
but it's strong and sturdy.

110
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:35,480
This is rare wood.

111
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,959
Are you eating or not?

112
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:37,839
If not, I'll stoke the fire.

113
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:39,839
Stir-fry it for me.

114
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,240
Add a few more eggs.

115
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:41,839
Alright.

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,279
Let me tell you,

117
00:05:49,279 --> 00:05:50,720
at the food street,

118
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,920
ideas just burst out like crazy.

119
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:56,279
Sir,

120
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,759
very fresh mangoes.

121
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:00,120
Take a look, they're really fresh.

122
00:06:01,079 --> 00:06:01,680
Thank you.

123
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,360
Come back for more if you like it. Okay.

124
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,519
Here you go, thank you, sir.

125
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,240
Great Emperor.

126
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:13,600
Sir,

127
00:06:25,639 --> 00:06:26,360
Big brother.

128
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,079
Why are you two here?

129
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,160
Boss, make two more servings.

130
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:40,199
Little Leng,

131
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:41,399
come here.

132
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:43,519
Try it.

133
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
We specially prepared milk tea for you.

134
00:06:56,399 --> 00:06:57,600
O-open it and see.

135
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
Xiao Leng,

136
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:15,000
these earrings

137
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,800
are a New Year's gift I picked out for you.

138
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,000
Don't underestimate them.

139
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:21,079
They

140
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:26,079
were blessed by a master I visited far away.

141
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:28,279
He blessed and prayed for them for you.

142
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:29,519
They'll keep you safe for life.

143
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:33,800
I know, before this,

144
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,600
I owed you something.

145
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,560
I even cut your monthly allowance before.

146
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,120
And that Noble Consort An

147
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,120
is out of line.

148
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,319
She keeps bothering you.

149
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:45,920
So,

150
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,600
I reflected deeply on this.

151
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:50,720
I've decided

152
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,720
to make it up to you.

153
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,600
I've already thought it through.

154
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,920
I'll make our Bing'er the Crown Prince.

155
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:08,519
Emperor, why not consider Ziyue and Ziheng?

156
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,600
Ziyue and Ziheng?

157
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,639
How could those two possibly do it?

158
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,319
Ziyue just fiddles with a piece of wood all day.

159
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,800
Always tinkering with it.

160
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,959
And Ziheng,

161
00:08:17,959 --> 00:08:21,120
he gets rashes just touching the opposite sex.

162
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,839
How could either of them be Crown Prince?

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,279
But Bing'er is too young.

164
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,399
You always do this—

165
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,160
making decisions for others.

166
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,120
What's wrong with that?

167
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,000
Can't I, as his father, decide for him?

168
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:32,879
You—

169
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,440
There's no reasoning with you.

170
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:44,759
Enjoy your meal.

171
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,240
Thank you, boss.

172
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,200
Ziheng,

173
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,840
you asked Xue Niang for help with the celebration.

174
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,519
You should've told me earlier.

175
00:08:57,159 --> 00:08:59,399
She listens to me better than to you.

176
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:04,559
Then, please bear with me, brother.

177
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:08,600
And keep today's matter secret for me.

178
00:09:08,799 --> 00:09:10,360
Understood, understood.

179
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,200
Last time, we mentioned

180
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:17,159
the two sons of the Zhangs at the village gate.

181
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,879
The younger son—

182
00:09:18,879 --> 00:09:19,679
he's scholarly,

183
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,639
quite a fine young man.

184
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:23,039
But,

185
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,759
he's lacking in that area.

186
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:26,039
Not interested in women.

187
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,120
Gets rashes when he touches a woman.

188
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,000
And he's always a bit dazed.

189
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,679
Now, about the elder son—
