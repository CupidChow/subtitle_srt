1
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:35,920
Your Highness

2
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,920
Why is there not a single servant here?

3
00:00:38,479 --> 00:00:39,719
What's wrong with you?

4
00:00:40,799 --> 00:00:41,399
It's nothing serious.

5
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:44,560
I'm just worried about Zi Heng and Xue Niang.

6
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,320
My old problem is acting up again.

7
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:49,560
That's true.

8
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:52,280
Xin Pin and I can't sleep at all.

9
00:00:52,439 --> 00:00:54,520
I heard the prison is cold and damp.

10
00:00:54,799 --> 00:00:57,439
Xue Niang and Zi Heng will suffer there.

11
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,880
And many people have died in that prison.

12
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,560
Restless spirits linger there.

13
00:01:03,119 --> 00:01:04,799
It's definitely haunted.

14
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,480
Now even An Guifei...

15
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,920
The Cold Palace truly faces endless misfortune.

16
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:13,079
Your Highness

17
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,959
Is there really nothing we can do?

18
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
There's only one way left.

19
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:23,840
What?

20
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,959
Jail-

21
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:28,319
-break.

22
00:01:37,239 --> 00:01:38,239
We'll enter through the south gate.

23
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:39,920
Xin Pin will handle the sleeping drug.

24
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,680
Xu Meiren will create a diversion.

25
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,799
I'll be in charge of finding the key.

26
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:43,920
I have a question.

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:44,439
Go ahead.

28
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:46,040
At that time,

29
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,239
I need to nurse my child.

30
00:01:47,599 --> 00:01:48,400
Me too.

31
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:49,920
Then bring them along.

32
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:51,519
We can't neglect the children.

33
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:53,319
I have another question.

34
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:54,000
Go ahead.

35
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:55,799
We're short one person for cover.

36
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,959
If we split up, it'll be dangerous.

37
00:02:02,239 --> 00:02:03,079
Let me do it.

38
00:02:04,120 --> 00:02:05,560
An Meiren

39
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:08,319
Your status isn't restored yet.

40
00:02:08,439 --> 00:02:09,560
Don't bring trouble upon yourself.

41
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:11,919
I'm someone who knows gratitude and grudges.

42
00:02:11,919 --> 00:02:14,960
Thanks to Xue Niang, I could speak openly with His Majesty.

43
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:16,240
I owe her a favor.

44
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,199
We're all sisters here.

45
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:18,520
How could I just stand by?

46
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:19,520
Well said.

47
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,000
Let's work together.

48
00:02:22,639 --> 00:02:25,159
Let's show the strength of Cold Palace women!

49
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,360
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

50
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:07,879
Who's there?

51
00:03:44,039 --> 00:03:44,960
Your Highnesses

52
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:47,680
Mother Consort, be careful.

53
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:49,919
Your Highness, be careful.

54
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,120
Hurry, go!

55
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:04,879
Zi Heng

56
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,560
Xue Niang

57
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,479
Your Highnesses

58
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,560
Why are you all here?

59
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,039
No time to explain, just go!

60
00:04:10,199 --> 00:04:10,719
Mother Consort

61
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:11,960
You'll be blamed for this.

62
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
Forget blame, just go!

63
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,560
That's right, hurry!

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:15,919
Quick!

65
00:04:36,959 --> 00:04:37,519
Zi Heng

66
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,639
We can only escort you this far.

67
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:43,079
Treat Xue Niang well.

68
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,879
Or I won't let you off.

69
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,800
Your Highnesses

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,319
Thank you all.

71
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,519
Don't worry.

72
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:09,240
Xue Niang

73
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,519
Let's go.

74
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,360
Hurry, let's go.

75
00:05:16,079 --> 00:05:16,480
Alright.

76
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:17,720
Take care.

77
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:19,000
Take care.

78
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,759
Commandant Fu is rebelling!

79
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:28,000
Looks like this day has finally come.

80
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,120
Xue Niang

81
00:05:31,519 --> 00:05:32,199
I understand.

82
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,319
Go quickly.

83
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:37,519
Be careful.

84
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,680
How dare you, Fu Mo!

85
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,000
Protect His Majesty!

86
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,439
You finally came.

87
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,279
We haven't talked in so long.

88
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:08,800
Commandant Fu

89
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:10,839
Your Majesty

90
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:13,040
It's come to this.

91
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,959
You're still stubborn.

92
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,480
Am I a commandant

93
00:06:30,959 --> 00:06:32,079
or a general?

94
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:33,839
Does it even matter now?

95
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,480
Fu Mo

96
00:06:36,959 --> 00:06:38,120
Even if you kill me,

97
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
without the command token,

98
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,639
you can't move the Xuanwu Army.

99
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:42,959
You still can't be emperor.

100
00:06:42,959 --> 00:06:43,839
Fine.

101
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,920
Then issue the command token now.

102
00:06:47,279 --> 00:06:50,040
Announce to all that I, Fu Mo, am emperor.

103
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,759
For old times' sake,

104
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,759
I'll spare your life.

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,480
We truly saw your true colors.

106
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:07,399
Father

107
00:07:07,399 --> 00:07:08,160
Your Majesty

108
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,720
How did the star-crossed lovers escape?

109
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:12,920
Fu Mo

110
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,079
The command token isn't with us.

111
00:07:15,279 --> 00:07:16,759
Stop dreaming.

112
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,639
What?

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:18,879
Father

114
00:07:19,399 --> 00:07:20,360
Don't waste words with them.

115
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,839
Just kill them first.

116
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,480
You all

117
00:07:24,439 --> 00:07:25,120
Kill!

118
00:07:25,399 --> 00:07:26,720
The command token is here!

119
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:28,759
Fu Mo, your guards are surrounded by the Xuanwu Army.

120
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:30,639
No one dares act rashly.

121
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,360
Mother Consort

122
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,839
Back when Bing'er was born,

123
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:45,079
His Majesty placed the command token in her swaddling.

124
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,759
Just waiting for traitors like you

125
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,560
to reveal yourselves.

126
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,720
Fu Mo

127
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,439
Your grand dream

128
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,120
should end now.

129
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,800
I don't believe it.

130
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,439
Protect His Majesty!

131
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,160
Your Highness, be careful.

132
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,000
Zi Heng

133
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:31,000
Xue Niang

134
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,759
Xue Niang

135
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,480
Xue Niang

136
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,600
Xue Niang

137
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,879
Xue Niang

138
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,279
Xue Niang

139
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,480
Zi Heng

140
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:00,879
Zi Heng

141
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,840
Xue Niang

142
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:03,559
Xue Niang

143
00:09:07,879 --> 00:09:08,559
Xue Niang

144
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,919
Let me handle Xue Niang's medicine and meals.

145
00:09:26,039 --> 00:09:27,240
I've already instructed the royal kitchen.

146
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,559
Let me do it instead.

147
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:30,600
I'm here to take care of her.

148
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,600
That should ease your mind.

149
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,200
What about Zi Heng?

150
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,720
The Second Prince hasn't slept for three days.

151
00:09:38,919 --> 00:09:40,440
He really needs to get some rest.

152
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,080
Ladies,

153
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:47,759
we're here to take over the shift.

154
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,519
You should go rest now.

155
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,720
Father,

156
00:10:02,879 --> 00:10:03,919
Did you have a nightmare?

157
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:07,720
It's so late.

158
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,279
Why are you here, Father?

159
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:11,919
We

160
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,080
just wanted to check on you.

161
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:18,159
Xue Niang hasn't woken up.

162
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:19,879
I can't sleep well.

163
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,399
You...

164
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:24,720
Take care of yourself first.

165
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:28,120
We know you two care for each other.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,399
If this time Xue Niang

167
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:32,519
can truly recover from danger,

168
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,000
We will grant you both your wish.

169
00:10:43,799 --> 00:10:45,600
F-Father, you mean...

170
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,039
Zi Heng,

171
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,960
after all we've been through,

172
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,960
We know what truly matters now.

173
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,320
Fate chart,

174
00:10:58,759 --> 00:11:00,360
good or bad omens—

175
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,799
We don't care about any of that.

176
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:09,600
It's getting cold.

177
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,480
Cover yourself with the quilt.

178
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:13,159
We will leave now.
