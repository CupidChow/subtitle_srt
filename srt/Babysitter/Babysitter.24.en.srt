1
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,479
Why aren't you awake yet?

2
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:39,439
Are you awake now?

3
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,479
Her eyelashes are moving.

4
00:00:40,479 --> 00:00:41,520
No, they're not.

5
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:43,479
Is she about to wake up?

6
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:47,799
She opened her eyes.

7
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:50,119
She's awake, she's awake!

8
00:00:50,799 --> 00:00:51,840
She's awake, she's awake.

9
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,880
Xue Niang.

10
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,200
Xue Niang.

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,439
Your Ladyships.

12
00:00:57,079 --> 00:00:58,640
She's awake. That's good.

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,840
Xue Niang.

14
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,079
Xue Niang.

15
00:01:10,599 --> 00:01:11,959
It's too tight.

16
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:26,840
You must be hungry.

17
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:29,319
Mm-hmm.

18
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,959
I'll get you your favorite Xue Mei Niang soon.

19
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:33,560
But...

20
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:35,079
Let me look at you first.

21
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,239
I'm afraid I'm dreaming.

22
00:01:41,359 --> 00:01:43,200
Have you lately...

23
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,560
not been sleeping well?

24
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
I can't sleep.

25
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,840
I know why.

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,319
Because I've been thinking of you.

27
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,680
Only when I think of you

28
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:01,040
can I wake up.

29
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:06,920
I've dreamed of being with you countless times.

30
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:09,560
Countless times.

31
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,000
Quantum entanglement.

32
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,080
No wonder you can't sleep.

33
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,479
Emperor.

34
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,879
I started as a humble maid in the palace.

35
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,439
Consort Leng and Wei Ziheng helped me.

36
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,400
They trusted me unconditionally.

37
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,840
They treated me kindly.

38
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:25,599
They let me open the Health Care Center.

39
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,080
They saved me from dire straits.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:29,400
I've long seen them as my family.

41
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:32,639
Consort Leng

42
00:03:33,719 --> 00:03:34,919
is my confidante.

43
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:38,319
And Wei Ziheng

44
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,000
is the love of my life.

45
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,080
Father.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,560
Xue Niang and I have pledged our love.

47
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,919
We are united as one.

48
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:52,919
We share honor together.

49
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,520
We share loss together.

50
00:03:58,199 --> 00:03:59,159
No need to say more.

51
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,599
Grant Wei Ziheng and Xue Niang

52
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,560
permission to marry.

53
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:06,759
Thank you, Father.

54
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,919
Thank you, Emperor.

55
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,960
Also,

56
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,360
appoint Wei Ziheng

57
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,360
as Crown Prince.

58
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:21,160
I accept your decree.

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,120
Hello.

60
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:34,160
Future Crown Princess.

61
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,240
My mission

62
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,000
is finally complete.

63
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,160
Why am I suddenly a bit nervous?

64
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,920
Wei Ziheng has been gone so long.

65
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,680
I've waited so long I'm hungry.

66
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:19,839
Why bother serving the royals?

67
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,040
Where did you go?

68
00:07:15,439 --> 00:07:16,120
For so long?

69
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:16,879
Sorry.

70
00:07:17,319 --> 00:07:18,120
Kept you waiting.

71
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:21,160
For a super long time.

72
00:07:26,079 --> 00:07:26,560
Wait a moment.

73
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:27,959
I...

74
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:29,959
I'm not ready yet.

75
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,240
Ready for what?

76
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,199
Ready.

77
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,240
Right.

78
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,800
I got this for you.

79
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,879
Do you like it?

80
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:57,360
I have plenty more.

81
00:07:58,279 --> 00:07:58,920
Then...

82
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,120
They're all mine from now on.

83
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:04,639
Okay.

84
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,160
Please take a look.

85
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,360
Please take a look.

86
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,839
What's the Health Care Center?

87
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,199
There's even music here.

88
00:08:31,439 --> 00:08:32,279
Impressive.

89
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,360
The Emperor approved it.

90
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,320
It's for mothers in need across the city

91
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:37,039
to give birth and raise children here.

92
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,039
Will this work?

93
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,159
Having babies outside the palace...

94
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,200
Is it reliable?

95
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:43,679
The ladies all seem interested.

96
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,320
Here,

97
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,200
fruit is unlimited.

98
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,840
Free audiobooks.

99
00:08:48,879 --> 00:08:50,519
There's yoga and massage.

100
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,159
Custom parenting plans.

101
00:08:52,559 --> 00:08:55,320
Ladies can bathe and soak their feet together.

102
00:08:55,679 --> 00:08:57,000
Twenty-four hours.

103
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,960
Play mahjong whenever you want.

104
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,120
Please come inside.

105
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:02,879
Alright, alright.

106
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,120
We can play mahjong now.

107
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,039
Let's go, let's go.

108
00:09:06,919 --> 00:09:07,600
Hurry, hurry.

109
00:09:09,879 --> 00:09:10,840
Let's go in too.

110
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:11,919
Okay.

111
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,799
Slow down, don't trip, Princess.

112
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:24,720
Slow down, don't trip.

113
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,759
Xue Niang.

114
00:09:34,519 --> 00:09:35,519
I want it!

115
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,519
Xue Niang, Xue Niang.

116
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:38,320
Hello, Your Ladyships.

117
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,759
Xue Niang.

118
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,559
Hurry up.

119
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:41,799
Forty thousand.

120
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:43,960
Forty thousand.

121
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:44,919
Come on, come on.

122
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:45,720
Come have one.

123
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,360
Sis, play your card already!

124
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:47,879
Here I go.

125
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,519
I want it, wait a sec.

126
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:53,000
Now this is a trip worth making.

127
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:55,320
Whether this place is real or not,

128
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,440
whether you're the lead or supporting role,

129
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:02,159
everyone can live a bright life.

130
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:14,440
Ziheng.

131
00:11:15,919 --> 00:11:17,279
I want to visit

132
00:11:17,639 --> 00:11:18,960
the House of ease.

133
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,240
Zhang Xiaoxue

134
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,399
You startled me.

135
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,799
It's been postponed for a month.

136
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:45,600
Your task is finished.

137
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:46,960
Hurry home now.

138
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,799
Can I not go back?

139
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,120
Did you get carried away?

140
00:11:51,159 --> 00:11:52,639
Your membership expired.

141
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,000
I really don't want to leave.

142
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,799
Don't you miss your

143
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,399
fried chicken and Wi-Fi

144
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,919
or sauna and house parties?

145
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,799
None of that is here.

146
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,360
But you have them here.

147
00:12:11,159 --> 00:12:12,600
The funny moms,

148
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,120
my best friends,

149
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,000
my mother-in-law,

150
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,679
and also

151
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,440
my goofy husband.

152
00:12:29,879 --> 00:12:30,559
I'm leaving.

153
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:33,679
Can they take care of themselves?

154
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,960
You've grown up.

155
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,200
But time's up.

156
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,759
Let's go, Zhang Xiaoxue.

157
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,600
If only this wasn't a dream,

158
00:12:51,759 --> 00:12:53,279
how wonderful that would be.

159
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,080
Excuse me,

160
00:13:58,919 --> 00:14:00,080
where did everyone go?
