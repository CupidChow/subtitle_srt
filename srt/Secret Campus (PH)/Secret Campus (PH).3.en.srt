1
00:00:19,436 --> 00:00:23,314
We were taught that two
people in love have sex.

2
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:26,181
Shit.

3
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:32,652
Shit.

4
00:00:36,774 --> 00:00:37,775
Oh, shit.

5
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:44,826
But sex is so far from love.

6
00:00:52,829 --> 00:00:53,830
Yeah.

7
00:01:01,838 --> 00:01:05,216
Because the person best at lying

8
00:01:14,598 --> 00:01:17,726
is the man who craves the vagina.

9
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:25,891
Die, you motherfucker!

10
00:02:27,301 --> 00:02:30,225
I really just want to finish my studies.

11
00:02:30,858 --> 00:02:32,902
You have nothing left,
including your career.

12
00:02:33,277 --> 00:02:35,920
It's showtime, fucks!

13
00:02:36,517 --> 00:02:39,006
It must be sad being alone.

14
00:03:23,658 --> 00:03:24,868
Sis?

15
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:27,618
Hello, you little troublemaker.

16
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:30,055
Sis, I won the spelling bee.

17
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,583
Wow, you're really amazing.

18
00:03:32,608 --> 00:03:35,360
Buy me a toy car.

19
00:03:35,385 --> 00:03:38,626
Because of that, sure, I'll
save up for one. I promise.

20
00:03:38,651 --> 00:03:40,844
Don't keep asking stuff
from your sister.

21
00:03:40,844 --> 00:03:42,306
Hello, Eunice?

22
00:03:42,382 --> 00:03:43,383
Hi, mom.

23
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,206
Don't let yourself be
swayed by your little brother.

24
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:49,893
Oh, it's fine. I really
miss that little one.

25
00:03:50,349 --> 00:03:53,352
And I earn from my student
assistant job, anyway.

26
00:03:53,805 --> 00:03:55,473
I also miss you, mom.

27
00:03:55,606 --> 00:03:56,982
We miss you too.

28
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,570
Are you doing okay there?

29
00:03:58,570 --> 00:04:01,573
Yes. I'm doing fine here.

30
00:04:01,573 --> 00:04:03,826
Just keep praying, alright?

31
00:04:03,851 --> 00:04:06,270
Yes, mom. I'll always follow your advice.

32
00:04:06,588 --> 00:04:10,801
And you know what? I've been praying
that I get to taste your Sinanglao again.

33
00:04:10,895 --> 00:04:13,773
During your vacation, dear,
come home immediately.

34
00:04:14,229 --> 00:04:16,648
Are you eating well there?

35
00:04:22,932 --> 00:04:25,571
Yes, mom. I'm perfectly fine here.

36
00:04:28,431 --> 00:04:30,640
Alright, bye-bye.

37
00:04:43,953 --> 00:04:46,706
Do you know the gossip recently?

38
00:04:47,155 --> 00:04:50,117
I told you, that's why
she got pregnant early.

39
00:04:50,142 --> 00:04:52,103
Yeah, she insisted it
was her boyfriend's,

40
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,293
but rumor has it that Sir
Lazaro is the real father.

41
00:04:54,318 --> 00:04:56,571
What? Just kidding!

42
00:04:56,622 --> 00:04:58,165
But be quiet about it, okay?

43
00:04:58,190 --> 00:05:01,193
- She'll be with us later.
- Of course. Let's go.

44
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,182
Large fries?

45
00:05:10,894 --> 00:05:11,895
Huh?

46
00:05:12,109 --> 00:05:13,653
Your order every morning.

47
00:05:18,484 --> 00:05:20,152
Just the small one, sir.

48
00:05:20,736 --> 00:05:21,737
Gabo.

49
00:05:23,341 --> 00:05:24,342
Huh?

50
00:05:24,507 --> 00:05:26,509
Just call me Gabo.

51
00:05:27,034 --> 00:05:29,828
And you're Miss Huh?

52
00:05:30,604 --> 00:05:31,605
Huh?

53
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:33,040
It is you.

54
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:39,539
One large fries for Miss Huh.

55
00:05:43,148 --> 00:05:44,650
Thank you, Gabo.

56
00:06:00,477 --> 00:06:01,514
Can I join?

57
00:06:01,539 --> 00:06:03,362
- Stop messing around!
- Leave her, bro.

58
00:06:03,387 --> 00:06:04,847
How selfish.

59
00:06:07,969 --> 00:06:09,875
On the other door, pal.

60
00:06:15,251 --> 00:06:16,252
Oh come on, babe.

61
00:06:16,277 --> 00:06:17,278
What?

62
00:06:17,746 --> 00:06:19,016
At least I helped.

63
00:06:19,628 --> 00:06:20,852
Her breasts are big.

64
00:06:36,228 --> 00:06:37,437
Please, come in, Dean.

65
00:06:37,462 --> 00:06:40,171
Eunice, have you received
your stipend this week?

66
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,567
Yes, ma'am.

67
00:06:42,304 --> 00:06:47,602
I heard that some of the student assistants
are having dinner later. Are you going?

68
00:06:48,870 --> 00:06:52,665
Dean, thank you, but not I'm not.

69
00:06:53,177 --> 00:06:57,265
I still need to review.
Finals are scheduled early tomorrow.

70
00:06:57,355 --> 00:07:01,360
Investing in your future
is important but

71
00:07:01,831 --> 00:07:06,293
at your age, you also
need to invest in memories.

72
00:07:07,176 --> 00:07:09,313
Make effort and make friends.

73
00:07:11,172 --> 00:07:13,599
You know, the
value of college life is

74
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,185
through the people
you meet and grow with.

75
00:07:17,853 --> 00:07:19,813
Dean, honestly,

76
00:07:20,610 --> 00:07:23,116
my family is counting on me.

77
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:28,614
You know, Dean Medina from the
faculty of engineering and I are close.

78
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:33,260
He mentioned that,
giving your initial grades,

79
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:38,165
there's a big chance you'll make it
to the Dean's List this semester.

80
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,302
Really?

81
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,252
Oh, Dean. Thank you so much.

82
00:07:42,502 --> 00:07:45,589
This is a huge help for
my partial scholarship.

83
00:07:45,881 --> 00:07:48,342
Just consider my advice, okay?

84
00:07:49,509 --> 00:07:51,511
- Yes, ma'am.
- You are a good student.

85
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:56,022
Did you call for me, Dean Domingo?

86
00:07:56,047 --> 00:07:57,680
Ugh, unlike others.

87
00:07:57,746 --> 00:08:00,195
Yes, Dennis? Have a seat.

88
00:08:10,914 --> 00:08:12,382
Babe, not here.

89
00:08:12,407 --> 00:08:13,492
It's fine.

90
00:08:13,634 --> 00:08:15,219
What if we get caught?

91
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:17,452
No one comes up here.

92
00:08:18,367 --> 00:08:19,604
But what if?

93
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:25,422
What's the point of having
lawyer parents then?

94
00:08:26,164 --> 00:08:27,631
I'm serious.

95
00:08:31,593 --> 00:08:32,844
Do you trust me?

96
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:35,541
Yes.

97
00:08:35,787 --> 00:08:36,788
Really?

98
00:08:37,557 --> 00:08:38,558
Yes.

99
00:09:00,854 --> 00:09:04,531
Remember, Dennis,
this is your last chance.

100
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:07,084
Or you'll be dropped.

101
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,732
Hey, you're the one from earlier, right?

102
00:09:27,474 --> 00:09:29,414
I apologize for my friends' behavior.

103
00:09:29,886 --> 00:09:31,492
Hayley's really a bitch.

104
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:35,657
Do you have someone to
have lunch with? Come on.

105
00:09:36,199 --> 00:09:37,437
I brought my own.

106
00:09:38,616 --> 00:09:39,742
What's your name?

107
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,400
Oh my God!

108
00:10:35,425 --> 00:10:36,676
Sorry, sorry.

109
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,232
Do you think it's funny, Julian?

110
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,070
Well, I'm not glad.

111
00:10:54,569 --> 00:10:56,363
Fuck, that was solid.

112
00:10:56,388 --> 00:10:59,391
Damn, you shouldn't be
bringing your lust to school.

113
00:11:00,077 --> 00:11:01,383
Idiot!

114
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,035
You have the guts to say that, huh?

115
00:11:03,191 --> 00:11:06,648
Well at least I'm not the
one getting caught, bro.

116
00:11:09,714 --> 00:11:11,446
What if she reports us, babe?

117
00:11:12,212 --> 00:11:13,781
We're about to graduate.

118
00:11:14,047 --> 00:11:16,299
You're running for Latin honors.

119
00:11:17,488 --> 00:11:20,407
Then you'd be "summa cum expelled."

120
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:22,431
- Idiot.
- I'm serious.

121
00:11:24,134 --> 00:11:27,304
Babe, she won't report us.

122
00:11:27,745 --> 00:11:29,714
Do you think that girl
knows a lot of people?

123
00:11:30,062 --> 00:11:31,231
I don't care.

124
00:11:31,648 --> 00:11:34,067
I don't even know that stupid bitch.

125
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,883
We even teased her earlier.

126
00:11:37,128 --> 00:11:38,959
You teased her.

127
00:11:38,984 --> 00:11:40,365
You're in trouble!

128
00:11:40,365 --> 00:11:41,450
Fuck you.

129
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:43,561
Hey, why are you making a fuss over there?

130
00:11:43,719 --> 00:11:46,889
Bro, these horny guys
got caught in the act.

131
00:11:47,795 --> 00:11:52,466
Damn, man. They were caught
having sex in the restroom.

132
00:11:54,433 --> 00:11:57,609
The girl from earlier, the one
who couldn't get through the door.

133
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:00,489
This one?

134
00:12:06,954 --> 00:12:08,247
How did you get this?

135
00:12:08,272 --> 00:12:09,898
She's a student
assistant for the Dean.

136
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,983
Fuck. Babe, you need to make her shut up.

137
00:12:16,716 --> 00:12:20,220
I'll shut her up using my balls, you like?

138
00:12:21,143 --> 00:12:23,645
Or do you want me to stuff her mouth?

139
00:12:24,284 --> 00:12:25,494
Exactly.

140
00:12:26,203 --> 00:12:30,749
I don't care how you do it.
Just make that damned woman shut up.

141
00:12:31,484 --> 00:12:33,861
They can handle it.
Right?

142
00:12:35,274 --> 00:12:36,484
Exactly.

143
00:15:25,251 --> 00:15:26,466
Hello, who's this?

144
00:15:26,466 --> 00:15:28,093
Hey, it's Dennis.

145
00:15:29,344 --> 00:15:31,930
Dennis? How did you get my number?

146
00:15:32,312 --> 00:15:33,564
From your ID.

147
00:15:43,151 --> 00:15:45,195
Dennis, please return it, okay?

148
00:15:45,346 --> 00:15:49,726
That's why I called. I'm here
at the corner near Solana, close to campus.

149
00:15:50,392 --> 00:15:52,924
Can I have it brought here to the dorm?

150
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:54,942
I'm actually about to leave.

151
00:15:56,359 --> 00:16:01,495
My finals are happening early tomorrow
and the professor is strict.

152
00:16:01,984 --> 00:16:04,153
If you want, you can come here.

153
00:16:04,283 --> 00:16:07,732
It's better than begging the guard and
going through the process of a lost ID.

154
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:09,854
That would be a hassle for you.

155
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:18,143
Alright, alright. Wait for me there.

156
00:16:20,395 --> 00:16:21,730
Okay.

157
00:16:39,914 --> 00:16:41,195
Where's my ID?

158
00:16:44,019 --> 00:16:45,468
Is there no "thank you"?

159
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:49,155
Thank you. Give it to me.

160
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,913
We're headed to a club.
Maybe you'd like to join.

161
00:16:53,198 --> 00:16:56,410
I can't. Just hand it over, please.

162
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:59,413
Come on. It'll be quick.

163
00:16:59,587 --> 00:17:00,588
Let's go.

164
00:17:02,395 --> 00:17:03,730
Do whatever you want.

165
00:17:04,314 --> 00:17:06,232
Stop messing around with her.

166
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:07,751
Clyde.

167
00:17:07,776 --> 00:17:09,077
She knows you, bro?

168
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:10,463
Nice.

169
00:17:11,343 --> 00:17:13,220
Don't mind them.

170
00:17:14,901 --> 00:17:16,319
It's just that I...

171
00:17:16,344 --> 00:17:17,721
You have an exam tomorrow?

172
00:17:19,237 --> 00:17:22,367
I'm sure that you'll still pass
even if you take it tonight, right?

173
00:17:24,334 --> 00:17:25,418
Let's go.

174
00:17:25,418 --> 00:17:27,504
Don't worry, Hayley
isn't here. You're safe.

175
00:17:31,382 --> 00:17:35,053
I really can't. And look,
I'm just in my house clothes.

176
00:17:35,548 --> 00:17:38,217
That's fine. It's our treat.

177
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,118
We're friends anyway, right?

178
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,061
Come on.

179
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:46,940
Let's go.

180
00:18:09,504 --> 00:18:12,173
Clyde, I thought we were going to the club?

181
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:14,844
Let's do a pre-game so we'll
be happy when we get there.

182
00:18:14,901 --> 00:18:17,946
He's right. Don't you
do that in the province?

183
00:18:18,117 --> 00:18:19,713
This is how it is in Manila.

184
00:18:23,226 --> 00:18:24,519
Where are you from?

185
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,435
Ilocos.

186
00:18:26,543 --> 00:18:28,962
Really? Nice. My dad is from there too.

187
00:18:29,132 --> 00:18:30,133
Really?

188
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,238
Where are they, your parents?

189
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:39,046
They're not here. They're
in the States with my siblings.

190
00:18:39,457 --> 00:18:42,085
Only my aunt and I are
here in the Philippines.

191
00:18:44,455 --> 00:18:46,666
It must be lonely being on your own, right?

192
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:51,421
Sometimes, but it's okay. And
my parents have high standards.

193
00:18:51,796 --> 00:18:56,801
You know what? I nearly dropped a course
once, and they almost disowned me for it.

194
00:18:57,427 --> 00:18:58,753
That's too much.

195
00:19:02,246 --> 00:19:04,402
Do you want some drinks?

196
00:19:04,427 --> 00:19:06,095
No, I'm okay. Thank you.

197
00:19:06,996 --> 00:19:09,003
It's mild. I promise.

198
00:19:09,743 --> 00:19:11,175
Okay, sure.

199
00:19:17,206 --> 00:19:20,238
This is good, dude. I
really think she's a virgin.

200
00:19:20,887 --> 00:19:23,390
I wonder who among us will get her first?

201
00:19:23,455 --> 00:19:24,790
If we even can.

202
00:19:28,872 --> 00:19:30,207
Let's drink first.

203
00:19:31,210 --> 00:19:32,211
Thanks.

204
00:19:32,435 --> 00:19:33,436
Cheers.

205
00:19:34,005 --> 00:19:35,261
Cheers.

206
00:19:41,738 --> 00:19:44,407
Clyde, about what happened...

207
00:19:44,432 --> 00:19:45,642
What happened?

208
00:19:46,683 --> 00:19:48,393
In the bathroom.

209
00:19:49,854 --> 00:19:52,398
It's nothing. It wasn't your fault.

210
00:19:56,621 --> 00:19:58,956
Dude, you remember Vanessa, right?

211
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:03,217
Remember when we rushed her
to the hospital because she fainted?

212
00:20:03,242 --> 00:20:06,287
But her eyes were rolling
back and she was even smiling.

213
00:20:07,642 --> 00:20:08,727
Sorry, bro.

214
00:20:10,118 --> 00:20:11,620
This thing is big, that's why.

215
00:20:12,168 --> 00:20:13,636
That's big?

216
00:20:13,714 --> 00:20:15,046
Then what about mine?

217
00:20:15,046 --> 00:20:16,923
At least my dick is harder.

218
00:20:16,988 --> 00:20:18,948
Your dick is harder? Idiot!

219
00:20:19,195 --> 00:20:20,832
Is Hayley your girlfriend?

220
00:20:21,427 --> 00:20:22,428
Uh-huh.

221
00:20:22,878 --> 00:20:23,879
For now.

222
00:20:24,597 --> 00:20:25,932
It's a bit complicated.

223
00:20:28,518 --> 00:20:29,727
Why's that?

224
00:20:31,158 --> 00:20:32,868
I'm not sure about that girl.

225
00:20:33,074 --> 00:20:35,952
The moment I took off my
briefs, she really cried, bro.

226
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:38,514
Maybe she cried because it's small.

227
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:42,764
- Bro.
- There you go.

228
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:44,242
- Thanks.
- You know, recently

229
00:20:44,242 --> 00:20:46,119
I hooked up with someone from Marikina.

230
00:20:46,818 --> 00:20:48,304
She was so good, man.

231
00:20:48,329 --> 00:20:49,664
Super hot.

232
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:51,384
Kath?

233
00:20:51,409 --> 00:20:52,619
Jilian, dude.

234
00:20:52,644 --> 00:20:53,645
Was she good?

235
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,213
Not just good, bro.

236
00:20:55,346 --> 00:20:59,392
She was so tight. Damn,
her pussy felt like an ass.

237
00:20:59,623 --> 00:21:03,186
I was trying so hard not to
come, man. It was really amazing.

238
00:21:04,095 --> 00:21:05,221
Did she blow you?

239
00:21:05,246 --> 00:21:08,750
Dude, let's take it easy.
We have a lady with us.

240
00:21:08,917 --> 00:21:12,803
Eunice understands.
Right, friend?

241
00:21:13,766 --> 00:21:16,769
Yeah, she knows a lot.

242
00:21:18,661 --> 00:21:19,998
Have you done it?

243
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:26,004
I've never had a boyfriend.

244
00:21:26,065 --> 00:21:28,177
Really now?

245
00:21:28,202 --> 00:21:30,496
Yeah, my mom would be mad.

246
00:21:30,817 --> 00:21:33,178
Why? Is it your mom that's being courted?

247
00:21:33,277 --> 00:21:35,193
Fuck you, you're such an idiot.

248
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,247
- Come on, let's light it up.
- Let's go!

249
00:21:37,272 --> 00:21:38,482
Give that to me.

250
00:21:38,507 --> 00:21:39,549
It's full.

251
00:21:40,423 --> 00:21:41,424
Lighter.

252
00:21:52,366 --> 00:21:53,409
This is great.

253
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:54,435
Good, right?

254
00:21:55,061 --> 00:21:56,696
- You want?
- This is good.

255
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:59,522
I don't know how to do that, Clyde.

256
00:21:59,547 --> 00:22:01,623
Then let's shotgun it.

257
00:22:01,795 --> 00:22:02,796
Huh?

258
00:22:03,948 --> 00:22:05,283
What's shotgun?

259
00:22:06,750 --> 00:22:08,210
Just like that.

260
00:22:09,837 --> 00:22:12,089
Give it to me. Pass it over.

261
00:22:16,244 --> 00:22:17,287
Are you okay?

262
00:22:39,816 --> 00:22:41,192
Cheers!

263
00:22:44,445 --> 00:22:46,114
Hold on, I'll be back.

264
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:51,702
You okay?

265
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,463
I'm fine.

266
00:23:05,497 --> 00:23:07,249
Dude, a snack.

267
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:11,193
Hey, what are you dong?

268
00:23:12,612 --> 00:23:14,947
Stop, it tickles me.

269
00:23:19,052 --> 00:23:21,415
Good thing you came with
us. Told you it's fun here.

270
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,609
Clyde, I still have to review.

271
00:23:23,943 --> 00:23:26,571
Let's just finish this. We're almost done.

272
00:23:26,596 --> 00:23:27,848
Are you okay?

273
00:23:28,193 --> 00:23:31,826
I'm okay.
Are you guys okay?

274
00:23:42,763 --> 00:23:46,233
- This will spill.
- That's enough, you can do it later.

275
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:47,355
Hey!

276
00:24:07,825 --> 00:24:08,826
Bro.

277
00:24:11,485 --> 00:24:12,943
Can you get the rag?

278
00:25:07,851 --> 00:25:09,144
What are you doing?

279
00:25:16,307 --> 00:25:17,308
Hey.

280
00:25:36,244 --> 00:25:37,536
Hey, Clyde.

281
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:11,183
What are you doing, Clyde?

282
00:26:37,595 --> 00:26:39,638
Guys, what are you doing?

283
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:47,980
Bro, what a waste. She's still a virgin.

284
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:49,132
Exactly, dude.

285
00:26:49,328 --> 00:26:52,251
Don't stick it inside.
We might get into trouble.

286
00:26:52,276 --> 00:26:54,148
Damn it, bro.

287
00:27:05,664 --> 00:27:07,416
Clyde, please don't.

288
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:10,961
Please.

289
00:27:11,355 --> 00:27:12,356
Stop it.

290
00:27:13,464 --> 00:27:15,773
What's the matter? You want this too.

291
00:27:28,806 --> 00:27:30,187
You want this, right?

292
00:27:36,101 --> 00:27:37,304
Let's go here.

293
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:38,871
Come here!

294
00:27:39,529 --> 00:27:41,281
- Put it in your mouth.
- Let me go.

295
00:27:41,306 --> 00:27:42,307
Put it in.

296
00:27:42,874 --> 00:27:44,292
I said put it in your mouth!

297
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:33,024
She's a virgin.

298
00:29:33,049 --> 00:29:34,634
That's right, dude.

299
00:29:38,327 --> 00:29:39,578
Thank you, guys.

300
00:29:39,603 --> 00:29:41,605
For sure, that gossipy
perv will now be quiet.

301
00:29:42,529 --> 00:29:44,028
The pleasure is ours.

302
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,325
You didn't bring anyone else,
right? Someone else might find out.

303
00:29:50,612 --> 00:29:53,615
No. Only we did that.

304
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:57,878
Okay, good. We're safe now, babe.

305
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:07,087
I don't understand why they did that.

306
00:30:07,292 --> 00:30:08,544
Hayley,

307
00:30:09,495 --> 00:30:12,333
Dennis, Julian, and Clyde planned this?

308
00:30:13,207 --> 00:30:16,919
Dean, I really had no
intention of reporting what I saw.

309
00:30:17,352 --> 00:30:20,465
I don't want any trouble.
I'm just a transferee here.

310
00:30:21,026 --> 00:30:22,945
So you went willingly?

311
00:30:25,342 --> 00:30:27,520
That night it happened?

312
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:29,967
Yes, because they said...

313
00:30:29,992 --> 00:30:31,619
It doesnt matter.

314
00:30:31,911 --> 00:30:34,473
Those were three boys
but you went with them?

315
00:30:34,498 --> 00:30:36,208
You should be smart, right?

316
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,481
But what they did wasn't right.

317
00:30:42,684 --> 00:30:44,227
Don't get me wrong.

318
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:48,419
I know what happened
to you was not good

319
00:30:48,698 --> 00:30:51,284
but, were you raped?

320
00:30:53,509 --> 00:30:54,510
Raped?

321
00:30:54,731 --> 00:30:56,787
Was the sexual act consummated?

322
00:30:57,079 --> 00:30:58,825
Was there penetration?

323
00:30:59,189 --> 00:31:00,473
No.

324
00:31:00,774 --> 00:31:03,611
Then it could be possible that

325
00:31:03,925 --> 00:31:09,764
you were too intoxicated so they thought
you were comfortable with what you all did.

326
00:31:10,576 --> 00:31:13,037
I'll be honest with you, dear.

327
00:31:13,747 --> 00:31:16,552
You can pursue this, but

328
00:31:16,941 --> 00:31:20,361
if you escalate this to
OSA, or even to the police,

329
00:31:20,711 --> 00:31:23,786
this will have a signifcant
impact on you, too.

330
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,385
You willingly went with the
guys. In the middle of the night!

331
00:31:28,513 --> 00:31:31,891
You knew the risk, yet
you still engaged with them.

332
00:31:32,959 --> 00:31:35,043
And how do you think it will
sound?

333
00:31:44,730 --> 00:31:47,774
- Hello, mom?
- How were your finals, dear?

334
00:31:48,155 --> 00:31:49,573
They were okay, mom.

335
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:51,692
Are you sure?

336
00:31:52,018 --> 00:31:57,064
Eunice, even in your voice,
I can sense something's wrong.

337
00:31:57,940 --> 00:31:59,776
Mom, I'm really fine.

338
00:32:00,125 --> 00:32:03,545
I'm just a bit sleep-deprived
from finals. You know how it is.

339
00:32:04,254 --> 00:32:09,370
Just remember, you can
come home if you can't handle it there.

340
00:32:10,683 --> 00:32:13,811
Mom, I promise. I'm really okay.

341
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,724
Don't worry.

342
00:32:16,475 --> 00:32:19,770
Alright, always take care.

343
00:32:21,687 --> 00:32:22,980
Bye, mom.

344
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:35,771
You look cute in the photos I sent, right?

345
00:32:39,748 --> 00:32:43,627
What's your problem? I
haven't done anything to you.

346
00:32:45,703 --> 00:32:49,916
I just needed collateral to make sure
you won't spill the beans.

347
00:32:50,175 --> 00:32:51,552
In that way?

348
00:32:51,849 --> 00:32:53,851
Hayley, you have no conscience.

349
00:32:54,192 --> 00:32:57,028
Conscience? Did I do
anything wrong?

350
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:00,644
Look at this.

351
00:33:02,183 --> 00:33:03,757
You look like you're enjoying.

352
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:08,056
See, you're even smiling.

353
00:33:09,811 --> 00:33:15,608
Don't test me if you don't want it to
spread on every porn site you can imagine.

354
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:18,497
Bye.

355
00:33:24,384 --> 00:33:27,952
Hey, Eunice! We'll go ahead, okay?

356
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:31,517
- Are you okay there?
- I'm fine, thanks. Take care.

357
00:33:46,971 --> 00:33:49,095
Have you vented out your frustrations?

358
00:33:52,875 --> 00:33:55,308
Don't you know who you cried to?

359
00:33:56,439 --> 00:33:57,816
You're stupid, aren't you?

360
00:33:58,250 --> 00:34:00,884
Of all people you could report to,
you had to report to my aunt.

361
00:34:01,433 --> 00:34:03,393
Please, stop bothering me.

362
00:34:04,376 --> 00:34:06,044
We're just getting started.

363
00:34:13,943 --> 00:34:14,944
Answer it.

364
00:34:17,763 --> 00:34:21,767
Answer it so she knows how
slutty her daughter is.

365
00:34:22,215 --> 00:34:24,551
Hurry up, you bitch.

366
00:34:27,606 --> 00:34:28,732
Hello, mom?

367
00:34:30,108 --> 00:34:31,777
Yes, I'm on my way home.

368
00:34:49,814 --> 00:34:51,230
Damn, this woman.

369
00:34:51,255 --> 00:34:53,423
Yeah, bro.

370
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:05,285
- Dude, a snack.
- I've never had a boyfriend.

371
00:35:05,310 --> 00:35:07,120
- Are you okay?
- What's shotgun?

372
00:35:07,145 --> 00:35:08,730
Come on, let's light it up!

373
00:35:09,415 --> 00:35:10,583
Clyde.

374
00:35:10,608 --> 00:35:12,401
Don't.

375
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,366
Come here!

376
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:25,655
I said put it in!

377
00:35:29,597 --> 00:35:34,560
Just remember, you can always
come home if you can't handle it there.

378
00:35:47,415 --> 00:35:49,281
I don't care how you do it.

379
00:35:49,306 --> 00:35:51,850
Just make that damned woman shut up.

380
00:36:14,783 --> 00:36:15,951
Large fries?

381
00:36:29,105 --> 00:36:31,121
You really won't leave me alone, huh?

382
00:36:31,146 --> 00:36:32,205
You jerk.

383
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,276
- What now?
- Dude, stop that.

384
00:36:34,555 --> 00:36:36,182
Who are you, huh?

385
00:36:43,829 --> 00:36:45,723
Good thing I caught up with you.

386
00:36:45,983 --> 00:36:48,523
Otherwise, I might have just
seen you on the news.

387
00:36:54,585 --> 00:36:57,630
People like Clyde
deserve to die, anyway.

388
00:36:59,085 --> 00:37:00,376
For what he did to you?

389
00:37:01,613 --> 00:37:03,997
Just killing him
would be too forgiving.

390
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,945
He should be raped from the ass.

391
00:37:09,837 --> 00:37:12,563
That's what they do to rapists
who get imprisoned.

392
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:17,719
Notice my tattoo?

393
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:21,323
I got this in prison.

394
00:37:22,504 --> 00:37:27,467
I shot my cousin when I found
out he was beating up my child.

395
00:37:30,859 --> 00:37:32,181
You've been in jail?

396
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,718
A lot of times.

397
00:37:34,717 --> 00:37:36,427
I've also peddled drugs.

398
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:40,438
I even know their "S."

399
00:37:41,091 --> 00:37:43,720
So if you want, I'll help you.

400
00:37:44,698 --> 00:37:47,201
I'll help you get your revenge properly.

401
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:19,608
She's delicious.

402
00:38:20,706 --> 00:38:21,832
Who will be next?

403
00:38:21,857 --> 00:38:24,642
Don't run. Don't
run! Come with us!

404
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:27,086
What do you want? I have a lot of money.

405
00:38:28,788 --> 00:38:31,291
Eunice? How dare you!

406
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:36,580
- Get in, get in!
- Just follow along and don't act tough.

407
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,315
- Faster!
- What do you want?

408
00:38:38,690 --> 00:38:39,691
Strip.

409
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,781
No.

410
00:38:44,279 --> 00:38:45,947
Strip!

411
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,701
This second bullet is for your
beautiful face.

412
00:38:49,763 --> 00:38:51,390
Bullet or strip?

413
00:38:51,924 --> 00:38:54,551
- Faster, faster!
- We didn't do anything wrong, why?

414
00:39:02,297 --> 00:39:03,298
Strip!

415
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,952
It was Dennis and Julian who harassed you.

416
00:39:15,977 --> 00:39:18,063
Why are you punishing me?

417
00:39:18,396 --> 00:39:19,898
Is that what Clyde told you?

418
00:39:20,635 --> 00:39:22,986
That only Dennis and Julian
touched me?

419
00:39:29,446 --> 00:39:32,575
I don't believe you.
Clyde loves me!

420
00:39:35,163 --> 00:39:38,708
Hayley! Just because you
have a picture by Clyde's bed

421
00:39:38,848 --> 00:39:41,393
doesn't mean you're the
only woman he's sleeping with.

422
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:46,995
I'm sure you're not the only woman
who moaned that way in that room.

423
00:39:47,222 --> 00:39:50,205
Please, don't spread that.

424
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,981
It depends on you.

425
00:39:52,514 --> 00:39:55,225
If you'll do exactly
what I tell you to.

426
00:39:55,553 --> 00:39:58,473
You've already had your revenge
on me, what more do you want?

427
00:40:05,105 --> 00:40:07,524
I can't understand
why he did that.

428
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:10,073
Hayley, stop lying.

429
00:40:10,703 --> 00:40:12,413
Do I look like I'm lying?

430
00:40:12,635 --> 00:40:15,805
I get why you didn't help me
when I first approached you,

431
00:40:15,954 --> 00:40:17,570
but Clyde has really gone too far.

432
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:21,334
We will sue Clyde Domingo
and this entire school.

433
00:40:21,518 --> 00:40:22,519
Attorney...

434
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:25,839
And I will make sure your
career is ruined.

435
00:40:26,214 --> 00:40:31,136
My child was abused and you're just
going to cover up for your damned nephew?

436
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,531
You have some nerve!

437
00:40:34,556 --> 00:40:35,557
You're crazy!

438
00:40:35,582 --> 00:40:36,958
So you're the one causing trouble!

439
00:40:38,822 --> 00:40:39,823
Pervert!

440
00:40:40,613 --> 00:40:41,990
Rot in jail!

441
00:40:43,046 --> 00:40:44,047
You brute!
