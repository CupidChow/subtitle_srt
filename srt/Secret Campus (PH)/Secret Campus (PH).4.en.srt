1
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:54,421
Mayette!

2
00:00:54,762 --> 00:00:56,346
I'm here!

3
00:00:59,676 --> 00:01:01,570
I'm on my way, grandma!

4
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:04,647
Mayette!

5
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,232
I'm coming!

6
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:07,650
Here I am, grandma!

7
00:01:07,675 --> 00:01:08,777
Mayette!

8
00:01:08,913 --> 00:01:10,079
Grandma.

9
00:01:10,199 --> 00:01:12,467
Where have you been, you fool?

10
00:01:12,927 --> 00:01:14,852
I was downstairs.

11
00:01:15,398 --> 00:01:16,749
Just downstairs?

12
00:01:17,074 --> 00:01:18,342
Are you deaf?

13
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:21,080
I've been calling
you since earlier!

14
00:01:21,105 --> 00:01:26,757
Grandma, I was at the back, washing
clothes. I wasn't playing around.

15
00:01:28,152 --> 00:01:29,968
Ah, doing the laundry.

16
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:36,721
Damn you! Just admit that you're flirting
with Mrs. Pulgado's son again, right?

17
00:01:36,846 --> 00:01:37,989
Oh, grandma.

18
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,375
Stop making excuses!
You're such a fool!

19
00:01:40,484 --> 00:01:42,611
You think I don't know?
I've known for a long

20
00:01:42,644 --> 00:01:44,771
time that you've been
flirting with that guy.

21
00:01:44,984 --> 00:01:49,445
You think he'd fancy you?
With that fat body of yours!

22
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:52,598
He won't ever settle for
someone like you. Stupid girl!

23
00:01:54,697 --> 00:01:58,076
- Where's Myra?
- She isn't home yet. She's at school.

24
00:01:58,429 --> 00:02:00,787
Why are you calling me, grandma?

25
00:02:00,882 --> 00:02:07,644
Why? You fool! My chamber pot,
I told you to bring it down earlier.

26
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:08,789
Damn you!

27
00:02:09,151 --> 00:02:10,897
Yes, I'm bringing it down now.

28
00:02:10,922 --> 00:02:13,967
Be careful not to spill it. My
room already smells of urine.

29
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:15,844
- Yes.
- You move so slowly.

30
00:02:15,844 --> 00:02:18,039
As if there's pus on your soles!

31
00:02:19,764 --> 00:02:20,890
Fool!

32
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,351
Oh, God!

33
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:19,699
Die, you motherfucker!

34
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:24,920
I really just want
to finish my studies.

35
00:03:25,381 --> 00:03:27,383
You've lost everything,
including your career.

36
00:03:27,678 --> 00:03:30,451
It's showtime, fucks!

37
00:03:31,038 --> 00:03:33,178
It must be sad being alone.

38
00:03:42,718 --> 00:03:44,153
It feels so good!

39
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:45,850
- Damn it!
- It hurts, wait!

40
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:46,944
Oh, fuck!

41
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,560
Ouch, ouch. Hold on, hold on!

42
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:52,065
Just a bit more, baby.

43
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:54,155
I said it hurts. Wait!

44
00:03:55,126 --> 00:03:56,127
Does it feel good?

45
00:03:56,152 --> 00:03:57,764
I said it hurts.

46
00:03:57,847 --> 00:03:59,130
- Just a bit more.
- Wait.

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:01,616
Exactly. Go slow. It hurts.

48
00:04:01,658 --> 00:04:02,659
Does it feel good?

49
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,285
- It hurts.
- Does it feel good?

50
00:04:04,310 --> 00:04:05,740
Damn it.

51
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,958
Go slow.

52
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,417
It hurts.

53
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,795
Wait, wait.

54
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,296
Just a bit more, baby.

55
00:04:15,321 --> 00:04:17,281
I said wait. It hurts.

56
00:04:17,368 --> 00:04:19,237
Damn, you're so good.

57
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:22,971
It hurts!

58
00:04:22,971 --> 00:04:24,263
You feel so good!

59
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:26,772
Go slow.

60
00:04:27,642 --> 00:04:28,772
It hurts.

61
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:34,357
Rommel!

62
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,109
I'm almost there. I'm close.

63
00:04:37,923 --> 00:04:39,655
It hurts.

64
00:04:39,825 --> 00:04:41,302
Wait for me.

65
00:04:42,735 --> 00:04:43,811
Damn it.

66
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:45,618
I'm close.

67
00:04:51,779 --> 00:04:53,488
- Here it comes.
- Ouch, it hurts.

68
00:04:53,513 --> 00:04:55,302
I'm coming! Here it comes!

69
00:04:55,776 --> 00:04:56,777
Damn it.

70
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:58,381
Fuck!

71
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:01,926
Here it comes.

72
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,639
I told you to wait for me.

73
00:05:21,404 --> 00:05:22,405
Hey babe.

74
00:05:22,613 --> 00:05:23,614
Are you mad?

75
00:05:24,443 --> 00:05:25,732
Do I look happy?

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,353
Why are you mad?

77
00:05:30,079 --> 00:05:31,565
You know what I feel, Rommel?

78
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,122
I feel like you're just using me.

79
00:05:35,348 --> 00:05:36,683
Using for what?

80
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:41,841
You bring me here, then you drop
your pants and briefs.

81
00:05:42,467 --> 00:05:47,974
Then you'll stick in your
dick. Whatever.

82
00:05:51,996 --> 00:05:53,039
What should it be?

83
00:05:53,603 --> 00:05:55,271
I should also be happy.

84
00:05:56,584 --> 00:05:57,841
Didn't you enjoy it?

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:01,725
How can I enjoy when all
you did was ride me.

86
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:06,258
What do you want? Some
romantic stuff?

87
00:06:07,693 --> 00:06:08,852
Okay, okay.

88
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,620
I'll romance you.

89
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,621
Idiot!

90
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,191
Don't be mad.

91
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:16,793
I'm going home.

92
00:06:17,727 --> 00:06:18,728
Wait a minute.

93
00:06:18,753 --> 00:06:20,700
It's late. They're
looking for me at home.

94
00:06:21,604 --> 00:06:23,926
Just a moment. Please,
just a moment. Promise.

95
00:06:24,591 --> 00:06:26,319
Stay here for now.
Don't get dressed.

96
00:06:26,344 --> 00:06:27,345
What are you doing?

97
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:29,430
- Just one minute.
- I'm still horny. Come on.

98
00:06:29,455 --> 00:06:30,448
Just one.

99
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,350
- Let go of me.
- Just one round, a quickie.

100
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,952
- Just one. This is just for once.
- Fuck you!

101
00:06:34,977 --> 00:06:36,020
You're so tempting!

102
00:06:37,647 --> 00:06:38,648
Fussy!

103
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,861
Told you, right?

104
00:07:42,219 --> 00:07:43,468
What time is it?

105
00:07:44,103 --> 00:07:45,563
About six.

106
00:07:46,038 --> 00:07:48,040
Right. It's six.

107
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,761
Aren't you supposed
to go home at three?

108
00:07:51,137 --> 00:07:52,180
Three-thirty.

109
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:54,359
Then why did you
come home so late?

110
00:07:54,536 --> 00:07:55,912
Where else did you go?

111
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,265
We had a meeting with my study group in the
library because we have a project deadline.

112
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,357
Project. Who are
you trying to fool?

113
00:08:07,187 --> 00:08:09,981
You went out
with your friends!

114
00:08:10,359 --> 00:08:13,390
What do you think I am, a
fool that you can deceive?

115
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,273
You're lying. Damn you!

116
00:08:18,326 --> 00:08:22,506
You’re just like your
promiscuous mother

117
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,900
who has has three
kids from different men.

118
00:08:27,882 --> 00:08:32,303
You know what? I won't be surprised
if one day you end up pregnant too.

119
00:08:34,526 --> 00:08:35,527
Well?

120
00:08:36,695 --> 00:08:38,530
Why are you silent?

121
00:08:40,019 --> 00:08:41,646
What do you want me to say?

122
00:08:41,979 --> 00:08:43,648
Are you being sarcastic now?

123
00:08:45,816 --> 00:08:48,531
Get out of my sight.

124
00:08:49,953 --> 00:08:54,125
I'm hungry. Cook my dinner!

125
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:04,707
What's for dinner, Mayette?

126
00:09:08,999 --> 00:09:10,075
Are you crying?

127
00:09:13,055 --> 00:09:14,954
What did auntie
do to you this time?

128
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:21,834
It really hurts when grandma
speaks when she's mad.

129
00:09:23,591 --> 00:09:24,874
What did she say to you?

130
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,525
Why did she get mad?

131
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,476
Because...

132
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,783
Because...

133
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:35,398
Because I didn't hear
her calling me earlier.

134
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,230
She was asking me to
bring down her chamber pot.

135
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:42,250
I was downstairs,
doing the laundry.

136
00:09:42,806 --> 00:09:46,018
I always rush upstairs
when I hear her bell.

137
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:49,468
But when I got there, she started
saying all sorts of things to me.

138
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:55,195
She said I have puss on my feet,
that I'm too fat, that I'm flirting around.

139
00:09:57,833 --> 00:10:03,125
Next time she does that, pour the
chamber pot's contents on her face.

140
00:10:04,472 --> 00:10:07,725
Pretend you tripped.
Then apologize.

141
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,132
Well?

142
00:10:33,713 --> 00:10:35,965
You're too much.
Are you still mad?

143
00:10:36,517 --> 00:10:37,518
I don't know.

144
00:10:38,358 --> 00:10:39,789
What's your problem anyway?

145
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,057
A lot.

146
00:10:41,335 --> 00:10:42,545
What do you mean a lot?

147
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:43,801
Just a lot.

148
00:10:45,509 --> 00:10:47,511
Did your aunt fight
with you again?

149
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:50,483
Is there a day when that
old witch and I don't quarrel?

150
00:10:52,645 --> 00:10:54,043
I don't want to be here anymore.

151
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,571
Pardon?

152
00:10:57,012 --> 00:10:58,722
Rommel, I don't want
to be here anymore.

153
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:09,085
Grandma, are you
taking your medicine?

154
00:11:09,143 --> 00:11:10,978
What's my blood pressure?

155
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:13,881
It's a bit high,
but nothing to worry about.

156
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,150
What did you read?

157
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,636
One fifty over one seventy.

158
00:11:19,318 --> 00:11:20,778
That's high, isn't it?

159
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,761
Yes, but you really
shouldn't stress yourself out.

160
00:11:25,118 --> 00:11:27,078
You shouldn't wear yourself out.

161
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:30,289
Just chill, breathe, smile. Okay?

162
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:34,652
And most importantly, take
your medicine on time. Okay?

163
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:36,737
Okay.
Thank you, Shirley.

164
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:43,411
What happened to auntie?

165
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:45,355
Let's talk over there.
Someone might hear.

166
00:11:51,126 --> 00:11:54,212
Wait, wait. Who takes
care of your grandma again?

167
00:11:54,456 --> 00:11:55,657
Is it still your maid?

168
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:58,634
Mayette knows how
to take care of auntie.

169
00:11:59,053 --> 00:12:00,095
You think?

170
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,529
Why not?

171
00:12:03,722 --> 00:12:08,494
Your aunt is old. She becomes
grumpy because of her illness.

172
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:11,810
It's different when someone
else looks after a sick person.

173
00:12:12,334 --> 00:12:14,294
What are you trying to say?

174
00:12:14,725 --> 00:12:17,937
Hire someone who
knows what to do.

175
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,798
Where would we get the
money for a caregiver?

176
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:25,010
You only check on auntie out of charity,
and just because you're our neighbor.

177
00:12:25,035 --> 00:12:29,290
Don't take offense at what
I'm saying. I'm just saying

178
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:32,735
you should get someone
experienced to care for her.

179
00:12:32,892 --> 00:12:35,084
Not some provincial maid.

180
00:12:39,654 --> 00:12:41,951
Alright, I have a shift. I'll be late.

181
00:12:58,582 --> 00:12:59,817
Just let it go.

182
00:13:00,909 --> 00:13:05,347
I'm tired of everyone reminding me
that I have to care for that old woman.

183
00:13:05,990 --> 00:13:09,411
You're crazy.
You know your aunt is ill.

184
00:13:09,503 --> 00:13:10,542
And...

185
00:13:10,567 --> 00:13:14,784
You know, I know she's disabled
and has all sorts of illnesses.

186
00:13:15,292 --> 00:13:17,771
She's only a few steps
away from Satan taking her.

187
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:21,342
Hey! You're really insane.
She took care of you.

188
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:27,308
Yes. Because my mom was a
prostitute and left me with relatives.

189
00:13:27,467 --> 00:13:31,706
And they were the only 'saintly'
ones who took me in, and cared for me.

190
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,172
I know that story.

191
00:13:36,323 --> 00:13:40,494
Everyone thinks that old woman
is so kind. But they don't know.

192
00:13:41,239 --> 00:13:42,261
That what?

193
00:13:42,672 --> 00:13:45,007
The only reason
Aunt Rosita took me in

194
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,727
is because she wanted
someone to care for her.

195
00:13:48,212 --> 00:13:51,757
She didn't get along with anyone
because of her bad attitude.

196
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,986
She only took care of me so when
she got old, she'd have a servant.

197
00:14:00,836 --> 00:14:06,133
You know, as soon as I graduate,
I'm leaving that old woman.

198
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:08,206
Where will you go?

199
00:14:08,563 --> 00:14:11,534
I'm going abroad. I'll find a job.

200
00:14:12,382 --> 00:14:14,009
I will become rich.

201
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:20,234
And you know?
I won't come back here.

202
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:23,667
I won't look back at
this hell I'm currently in.

203
00:14:32,569 --> 00:14:34,120
Mayette!

204
00:14:34,659 --> 00:14:38,077
You bitch, where are you!?

205
00:14:39,336 --> 00:14:42,769
You bitch, where are you?

206
00:14:47,678 --> 00:14:49,655
- Myra...
- What happened here?

207
00:14:49,718 --> 00:14:52,679
Where's the maid,
where's Mayette?

208
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,270
Myra.

209
00:14:59,106 --> 00:15:01,222
What are you doing? Help me.

210
00:15:02,234 --> 00:15:03,611
Help me.

211
00:15:05,946 --> 00:15:09,325
Help me, come on!

212
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:13,412
Mayette?

213
00:15:17,131 --> 00:15:18,132
Mayette?

214
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,502
Mayette?

215
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:49,531
Bobet, come here.

216
00:15:52,218 --> 00:15:53,344
Myra, What's up?

217
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:54,896
You know our maid, right?

218
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,206
Ah, the small one who sings a lot?

219
00:15:57,584 --> 00:15:58,983
Have you seen her, Bobet?

220
00:15:59,731 --> 00:16:01,358
Why, is she missing?

221
00:16:02,169 --> 00:16:06,340
She just left this letter. I just want
to know if someone saw her leave.

222
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:10,636
Did she steal something? Do
you want to report it to the village?

223
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:11,844
No, no.

224
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,044
Did she run away?

225
00:16:14,694 --> 00:16:17,085
I'm looking for her, aren't I?
Why are you still asking?

226
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:46,997
Myra, what about grandma?

227
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,216
I'm looking for a
replacement for Mayette.

228
00:16:49,413 --> 00:16:51,077
While you're searching,
what will you do?

229
00:16:52,593 --> 00:16:55,221
You're gonna leave
the old woman alone?

230
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:56,990
I'm studying.

231
00:16:57,073 --> 00:16:58,492
I know, but...

232
00:16:58,517 --> 00:17:00,924
I'm graduating next semester.

233
00:17:01,436 --> 00:17:03,689
So, what will you do with her?

234
00:17:03,975 --> 00:17:06,853
Do you know she can't
stand without getting dizzy?

235
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,862
What if she falls, breaks a bone,
slips? What will you do then?

236
00:17:11,098 --> 00:17:13,142
Yes, I understand, that's why

237
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:15,367
I'm looking for a maid
because Mayette left me.

238
00:17:15,367 --> 00:17:17,065
You should stay with
her for the meantime.

239
00:17:17,090 --> 00:17:19,175
- What about school?
- What about grandma?

240
00:17:19,900 --> 00:17:24,042
You know, I don't know
the solution to your problem.

241
00:17:24,386 --> 00:17:29,182
But I hope you don't abandon the
old lady. She's already old and sick.

242
00:17:29,269 --> 00:17:32,628
Have pity on your aunt.
She's only relying on you.

243
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,456
Fine!

244
00:17:54,911 --> 00:17:58,456
Enough. Don't shove it in my
mouth! What's wrong with you?

245
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:00,990
Do you want to choke me?

246
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:02,058
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:02,211 --> 00:18:05,456
You always say sorry.
You're no different from Mayette.

248
00:18:05,615 --> 00:18:09,456
That fool, always clueless,
but turns out to be a thief.

249
00:18:09,481 --> 00:18:12,822
Auntie, please don't be too
hard on her. She already left us.

250
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:17,137
Then it's good that she left. I was
planning to ask her to leave anyway.

251
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,181
I don't want this anymore.

252
00:18:19,924 --> 00:18:21,325
Stop it, I can't take it anymore.

253
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:23,060
You might get hungry later.

254
00:18:23,338 --> 00:18:26,633
I'll wake up then. Are you
planning to go somewhere?

255
00:18:27,456 --> 00:18:28,457
Where will you go?

256
00:18:28,499 --> 00:18:30,501
Didn't you say you're already full?

257
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:32,549
Are you challenging me?

258
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,214
Fuck you. You
have no respect for elders.

259
00:18:35,239 --> 00:18:36,406
Fuck you too.

260
00:18:36,532 --> 00:18:37,866
- What?
- Nothing!

261
00:18:39,448 --> 00:18:41,229
Damn this woman.

262
00:18:48,978 --> 00:18:50,446
Why did you call for me?

263
00:18:50,908 --> 00:18:52,618
That witch might hear you.

264
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:54,800
What?

265
00:18:55,073 --> 00:18:56,282
I need you.

266
00:19:05,187 --> 00:19:06,462
Hey, what are you doing?

267
00:19:08,083 --> 00:19:09,084
Hey!

268
00:19:09,109 --> 00:19:10,894
Why?
Don't you want this?

269
00:19:11,704 --> 00:19:14,373
What is this?
Your aunt might hear us.

270
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,392
There.
Don't you want this?

271
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,418
Hey, whay are you doing?

272
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,009
Don't you want to?

273
00:19:32,013 --> 00:19:33,517
Don't leave me hanging.

274
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,575
Fuck.

275
00:20:49,601 --> 00:20:50,686
Fuck.

276
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:52,751
Do you like that?

277
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:53,794
Yes.

278
00:20:53,936 --> 00:20:54,937
Are you happy?

279
00:20:54,962 --> 00:20:56,042
I'm happy.

280
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,324
Do you like this?

281
00:22:49,747 --> 00:22:50,748
Fuck.

282
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,188
Happy?

283
00:23:20,286 --> 00:23:22,705
Don't go too fast. Wait for me.

284
00:23:23,794 --> 00:23:24,932
I can't hold back anymore.

285
00:23:25,164 --> 00:23:27,416
Damn you, Rommel. Wait for me.

286
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,681
Wait!

287
00:24:09,457 --> 00:24:10,500
Are you mad?

288
00:24:13,758 --> 00:24:15,379
Hey, I'm sorry.

289
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:17,330
It's okay.

290
00:24:20,475 --> 00:24:24,270
Babes, I tried to control it, but...

291
00:24:24,543 --> 00:24:26,754
I said it's okay.

292
00:24:31,141 --> 00:24:32,705
Rommel, be honest with me.

293
00:24:33,739 --> 00:24:35,165
Do you really love me?

294
00:24:37,504 --> 00:24:38,752
Do you really have to ask?

295
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:40,687
Yes, I'm asking.

296
00:24:42,042 --> 00:24:43,257
Isn't it obvious?

297
00:24:44,972 --> 00:24:45,973
Why?

298
00:24:46,344 --> 00:24:47,512
What do you mean, "why"?

299
00:24:49,611 --> 00:24:53,183
Do you only love me when we
have sex because it feels good?

300
00:24:54,596 --> 00:24:55,597
Yes.

301
00:24:57,756 --> 00:24:58,757
That's it?

302
00:25:00,067 --> 00:25:03,768
Hey, stop. I'm tired
and that one's asleep.

303
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:05,442
You really love me?

304
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,245
Yes, yes.

305
00:25:07,706 --> 00:25:09,374
- I do, yes.
- Really?

306
00:25:10,453 --> 00:25:11,454
Yes.

307
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,265
Hey, where are you from?

308
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:24,749
Grandma almost died.

309
00:26:24,808 --> 00:26:26,751
Why, what happened?

310
00:26:27,141 --> 00:26:29,947
- She fell from the stairs.
- You're in trouble.

311
00:26:38,223 --> 00:26:40,624
- It hurts, Shirley.
- Aunt, what happened?

312
00:26:41,611 --> 00:26:45,057
You have the guts to ask me
what happened you motherfucker?

313
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:47,856
You left me alone!

314
00:26:48,191 --> 00:26:50,328
Grandma, enough.
Enough.

315
00:26:50,384 --> 00:26:53,712
You let me be alone. I
almost fell down the stairs!

316
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,058
Calm down, calm down.

317
00:26:57,157 --> 00:27:02,417
You're so ungrateful,
you whore!

318
00:27:02,454 --> 00:27:09,627
You're using school as an excuse
but the truth is you're flirting around!

319
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:14,424
Grandma, hold on. Myra,
let's step out first. Let's go.

320
00:27:19,954 --> 00:27:21,373
Did aunt get hurt?

321
00:27:21,723 --> 00:27:26,519
She was dizzy, lost balance. She couldn't
find you so she went down the stairs.

322
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:28,177
What's going on?

323
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:32,484
She was frightened, not knowing
where you went. What were you doing?

324
00:27:32,636 --> 00:27:33,943
I brought something to school.

325
00:27:33,943 --> 00:27:36,529
And you left
without her knowing?

326
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:39,783
What do you want me to do?
Watch her all day and night?

327
00:27:39,956 --> 00:27:41,386
What about the
things I need to do?

328
00:27:41,411 --> 00:27:44,846
It's not about what
I want you to do

329
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:47,316
but it's about what
you should do.

330
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,021
Aunt, I'll head out for a bit.

331
00:28:47,053 --> 00:28:48,095
You can't.

332
00:28:49,106 --> 00:28:51,076
I'll just be at Jenny's for a moment.

333
00:28:51,789 --> 00:28:54,998
I just need to hand in our
assignment to our teacher.

334
00:28:56,443 --> 00:29:00,613
I said you can't.
Are you dumb or deaf?

335
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:12,041
Okay, fine. I'll just
call Jenny to pick it up.

336
00:29:15,285 --> 00:29:18,866
See? The truth came out.

337
00:29:19,782 --> 00:29:20,989
What truth?

338
00:29:21,222 --> 00:29:24,433
Fish get caught by their mouths.

339
00:29:27,199 --> 00:29:29,660
You were still
trying to deceive me.

340
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:35,665
And you are using your studies
as an excuse to flirt outside.

341
00:29:35,832 --> 00:29:40,012
Auntie, I'm not flirting. I just
really want to finish my studies.

342
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:47,260
For what, to escape from me? So
after you graduate, you can leave me?

343
00:29:47,412 --> 00:29:51,623
What do you think of me, stupid?
Do you think I don't know your plans?

344
00:29:52,365 --> 00:29:53,766
That's not true.

345
00:29:53,916 --> 00:29:56,711
I know. I know your plans, fool!

346
00:29:57,798 --> 00:30:01,093
Next time, make your
lies more believable.

347
00:30:01,763 --> 00:30:04,861
You're no different from that
fool Mayette who did nothing

348
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:08,198
but steal from us and then leave.

349
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:12,310
Auntie, I just really want to
graduate, that's what you promised me.

350
00:30:14,561 --> 00:30:17,439
I never promised such a thing.

351
00:30:18,358 --> 00:30:19,359
Please, auntie.

352
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:24,672
I need you here at home.
Stop your studies.

353
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,840
I can't.

354
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:30,286
What do you mean, you can't?
Am I asking for your permission?

355
00:30:32,047 --> 00:30:36,068
You know I've thought
about it, stopping your studies.

356
00:30:37,373 --> 00:30:41,481
Auntie, I really want to graduate.
Just two more semesters.

357
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:45,510
Well, find someone
else to pay your tuition.

358
00:30:47,111 --> 00:30:50,865
But if you graduate
and leave me...

359
00:30:51,085 --> 00:30:53,001
I'll find a replacement for Mayette.

360
00:30:54,005 --> 00:30:59,469
Is that so? Why, because you
don't want to take care of me?

361
00:30:59,849 --> 00:31:04,449
Damn you. You're so
ungrateful. Is this how you repay me

362
00:31:04,482 --> 00:31:08,458
after everything
I've done for you?

363
00:31:10,761 --> 00:31:15,568
Fine. Study! I won't stop you.

364
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:20,662
But find someone
to pay your tuition

365
00:31:20,687 --> 00:31:23,693
and also find a place
to stay because I don't

366
00:31:23,718 --> 00:31:26,076
need freeloaders in my house.

367
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:30,305
You whore.

368
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:00,585
Rommel.

369
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:02,691
Rommel.

370
00:32:17,644 --> 00:32:19,087
Hey what happened to you?

371
00:32:20,164 --> 00:32:22,166
Rommel, didn't you
say you love me?

372
00:32:22,497 --> 00:32:23,886
Yes, why?

373
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:27,596
I really, really need your help.

374
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:30,695
What kind of help?

375
00:32:31,571 --> 00:32:35,117
I don't want to go home to Aunt
Rosita anymore. I want to be with you.

376
00:32:35,995 --> 00:32:36,996
Be with me?

377
00:32:37,664 --> 00:32:38,665
Where?

378
00:32:39,078 --> 00:32:41,580
Anywhere. I just
don't want to go home.

379
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:43,503
I want to be with you.

380
00:32:44,501 --> 00:32:45,669
Are you crazy?

381
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:49,117
You think my parents
will let you live with us?

382
00:32:51,341 --> 00:32:53,385
Don't you want
us to be together?

383
00:32:54,659 --> 00:32:59,854
Of course I do.
But not like this.

384
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:04,841
Rommel, I really can't
go home anymore.

385
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:13,370
Take me anywhere. Even if you
just let me stay in your garage.

386
00:33:13,535 --> 00:33:17,039
Please, Rommel.
I don't want to go home.

387
00:33:17,802 --> 00:33:20,221
Myra, I really can't do this.

388
00:33:20,951 --> 00:33:21,952
What?

389
00:33:22,685 --> 00:33:24,694
I mean, I can't do what you want.

390
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,470
You won't help me?

391
00:33:29,527 --> 00:33:32,947
Sorry, I really can't.
I'm really sorry.

392
00:33:33,986 --> 00:33:36,822
You've done
nothing but apologize.

393
00:33:49,085 --> 00:33:51,763
Hey, you know what?

394
00:33:52,029 --> 00:33:54,031
- She and her boyfriend had a fight.
- Really?

395
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,366
Yeah, she was crying.

396
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:56,409
Cool, alright.

397
00:33:57,222 --> 00:33:58,344
Leave it to me.

398
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,955
If I were you,
I'll meet her upstairs.

399
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:03,624
Talk to her already.

400
00:34:03,887 --> 00:34:07,140
Alright dude, this stays
between us. Don't tell anyone.

401
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,005
- Of course!
- Alright.

402
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,182
Myra, where's my food?

403
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:22,368
I'm starving. Hurry up!

404
00:34:22,393 --> 00:34:24,312
Yes. Fucking bitch!

405
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:11,108
Auntie, it's time to eat!

406
00:35:22,537 --> 00:35:25,632
Why are you late? You
went out again, didn't you?

407
00:35:29,131 --> 00:35:30,132
What's that?

408
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:32,397
Didn't you say you were hungry?

409
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:36,425
Is that what you're
going to feed me?

410
00:35:36,808 --> 00:35:38,768
Yes. Do you have
a problem with it?

411
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:43,057
And you placed it there?
What do you think I am, a dog?

412
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:45,491
If you don't want to eat it,
then don't.

413
00:35:46,788 --> 00:35:49,576
Don't speak to me like that.

414
00:35:49,654 --> 00:35:52,091
You don't want this? You don't?

415
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,569
Do you know who
you're talking to?

416
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,570
You don't want it, huh.

417
00:35:55,595 --> 00:35:56,596
Hey!

418
00:35:56,721 --> 00:35:58,965
Son of a bitch.
What are you doing?

419
00:35:59,179 --> 00:36:00,236
You don't want
to eat this, right?

420
00:36:00,261 --> 00:36:03,348
Go to the kitchen and
make your own meal then.

421
00:36:03,802 --> 00:36:06,305
You're so ungrateful.

422
00:36:06,347 --> 00:36:09,810
If I still owed you anything,
I'm sure I've already paid it back.

423
00:36:09,835 --> 00:36:11,168
You fucking bitch!

424
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:14,255
Yes, I'm a bitch. Aren't we blood-related?
So, you're also a bitch.

425
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,281
Bitch.

426
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:18,175
Ouch, that hurts...

427
00:36:18,613 --> 00:36:22,116
Auntie, fuck you and die already.

428
00:36:22,878 --> 00:36:25,631
Myra, Myra!

429
00:36:26,568 --> 00:36:28,557
Come back here!

430
00:36:29,691 --> 00:36:30,942
Myra!

431
00:36:31,018 --> 00:36:33,145
Come back!

432
00:36:44,148 --> 00:36:45,149
Bobet!

433
00:36:45,762 --> 00:36:48,098
Oh, Myra, what's up?

434
00:36:48,263 --> 00:36:49,390
Come inside.

435
00:36:49,474 --> 00:36:50,525
Come in?

436
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,751
Is it okay?

437
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:53,612
Yes, of course. I invited you.

438
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:59,169
- Such a lucky day for me.
- Here.

439
00:37:03,771 --> 00:37:04,772
Come.

440
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,515
What's this all about?

441
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,558
Come here.

442
00:37:09,242 --> 00:37:12,005
Let me see how
manly you really are.

443
00:37:12,505 --> 00:37:13,798
Really now?

444
00:37:14,435 --> 00:37:16,228
Let's see. Make this hard.

445
00:37:16,751 --> 00:37:17,752
You sure?

446
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:20,237
I'm already holding it,
and you're still asking?

447
00:37:23,633 --> 00:37:24,851
What was that noise?

448
00:37:24,876 --> 00:37:26,795
- Ignore it.
- Is that Grandma?

449
00:37:31,266 --> 00:37:32,735
Myra!

450
00:37:36,683 --> 00:37:37,934
Does it feel good?

451
00:37:38,214 --> 00:37:39,590
Oh shit, Myra!

452
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,676
You feel so good.

453
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,773
Myra!

454
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,278
Myra!

455
00:38:06,617 --> 00:38:10,454
You’re just like your
promiscuous mother

456
00:38:10,479 --> 00:38:13,789
who has three
kids with different men.

457
00:38:15,944 --> 00:38:17,278
Myra!

458
00:38:28,821 --> 00:38:33,985
You're using your studies
as an excuse to flirt outside.

459
00:38:42,028 --> 00:38:46,438
Auntie, I'm not flirting. I just
really want to finish my studies.

460
00:38:50,343 --> 00:38:56,039
For what? To escape from me?
To leave me once you graduate?

461
00:38:56,064 --> 00:38:57,485
Fuck you!

462
00:39:12,138 --> 00:39:13,348
Myra!

463
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,560
You're so ungrateful. Is
this how you repay me?

464
00:39:16,585 --> 00:39:19,625
after everything I've done for you?

465
00:39:26,508 --> 00:39:29,142
Fuck you, you have
no respect for elders!

466
00:39:55,593 --> 00:39:58,383
You're just flirting,
you wretch!

467
00:40:46,477 --> 00:40:47,478
Yes!
