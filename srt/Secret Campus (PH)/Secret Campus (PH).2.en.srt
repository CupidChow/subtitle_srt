1
00:00:19,546 --> 00:00:25,442
Comedy is all about making
us laugh and enjoy ourselves.

2
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:28,987
It's an everyday life situation.

3
00:00:30,968 --> 00:00:32,407
Hey. I'll go ahead, okay?

4
00:00:32,449 --> 00:00:33,742
- Okay.
- Bye.

5
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:39,372
Funny characters, silly mistakes,
or quirks!

6
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:43,084
That's why comedy aims to entertain us.

7
00:00:43,204 --> 00:00:47,458
It also gives
joy and laughter to our lives.

8
00:00:48,679 --> 00:00:52,302
In our next lesson, we will
discuss the two dramatic forms

9
00:00:52,327 --> 00:00:54,371
which are the purpose and
structure.

10
00:00:54,876 --> 00:00:56,623
So, thank you for today.

11
00:01:55,394 --> 00:01:57,559
Die, you motherfucker!

12
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:01,813
I really just want to finish
my studies.

13
00:02:02,786 --> 00:02:05,122
You have nothing left,
including your career.

14
00:02:05,147 --> 00:02:07,566
It's showtime, fucks!

15
00:02:08,421 --> 00:02:10,882
It must be sad being alone.

16
00:02:21,786 --> 00:02:22,912
- Sir.
- Sir, sir, sir!

17
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:25,606
Sir, would it be possible to extend
the concept paper's deadline?

18
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:28,728
Sir, I just have a clarification
regarding your lesson.

19
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:31,713
Sir, have you read
First Person Singular by Murakami?

20
00:02:31,866 --> 00:02:33,543
What is your favorite from there?

21
00:02:34,622 --> 00:02:36,082
Let's go. Come on.

22
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:57,660
You're trying to be Mr. Congeniality again.

23
00:02:57,770 --> 00:03:00,434
I really just can't say no to them.

24
00:03:00,484 --> 00:03:02,945
I assume you won't say no to this...

25
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:04,054
Wait. What is that?

26
00:03:04,594 --> 00:03:07,723
It's Bobby's birthday celebration tonight.

27
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:10,755
I'm sorry, but I can't make it!

28
00:03:11,137 --> 00:03:14,393
What do you mean?
It's a Friday night.

29
00:03:14,418 --> 00:03:16,402
You don't have any classes tomorrow.

30
00:03:16,489 --> 00:03:19,284
I know.
But I have somewhere to go to.

31
00:03:20,559 --> 00:03:21,849
You have a date?

32
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:25,328
I just have somewhere to go to. Every
Friday night. You know that.

33
00:03:25,353 --> 00:03:27,772
So I'll make it up to you
next time.

34
00:03:28,097 --> 00:03:29,474
Okay, fine.

35
00:03:55,895 --> 00:03:59,028
- Hi.
- Hello Sir, J. Hannah again?

36
00:03:59,207 --> 00:04:02,598
Is she available yet? She said she
still had something at eight p.m.

37
00:04:02,817 --> 00:04:06,073
It will be over soon.
Should I have the room ready, sir?

38
00:04:06,098 --> 00:04:07,059
Will you be showering?

39
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:08,509
- Okay.
- Got it.

40
00:04:15,137 --> 00:04:17,321
Good evening, sir.
Are you ready?

41
00:04:17,445 --> 00:04:18,446
I'm ready.

42
00:06:37,382 --> 00:06:39,271
Why didn't you come
to my birthday?

43
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:42,049
I invited him but he said he
had somewhere to go to.

44
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:45,012
You always have an excuse
whenever we invite you.

45
00:06:45,937 --> 00:06:47,515
You both know that I have
somewhere to be

46
00:06:47,556 --> 00:06:49,983
Every Friday night, right? So
just give that to me, please?

47
00:06:50,278 --> 00:06:54,407
You aren't married or have children,
so what are you up to?

48
00:06:54,961 --> 00:06:57,934
Maybe you have a girlfriend already
and you just don't tell us.

49
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,002
Whoa!

50
00:06:59,608 --> 00:07:02,528
You know what, guys? I'll go ahead.
I still have a consultation to go to.

51
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,779
I'll see you around.

52
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,531
- I'll be going too.
- Sure.

53
00:07:05,994 --> 00:07:06,995
Bye!

54
00:07:08,656 --> 00:07:10,169
- Joaquin!
- Yes?

55
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:12,213
- Here.
- What's this?

56
00:07:12,623 --> 00:07:15,809
The doctorate application
form for N.U.S.

57
00:07:16,977 --> 00:07:21,606
You've been wanting to do a
PhD in Singapore for a while now.

58
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:23,535
If not now, when?

59
00:07:23,607 --> 00:07:25,525
You won't lose anything
if you try.

60
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:26,677
I'll think about it.

61
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:28,866
Okay.

62
00:07:28,891 --> 00:07:29,892
Hi.

63
00:07:30,047 --> 00:07:31,622
- Sir.
- Yes?

64
00:07:31,952 --> 00:07:34,121
Can you sign my book?

65
00:07:34,351 --> 00:07:35,394
Sure.

66
00:07:35,394 --> 00:07:38,272
Let's do it in my office
so I can write properly.

67
00:07:38,402 --> 00:07:39,904
Okay, thank you.

68
00:07:39,984 --> 00:07:41,161
Okay, excuse me.

69
00:07:41,269 --> 00:07:42,888
- Irene, see you.
- Okay.

70
00:07:45,536 --> 00:07:48,162
So, what name should I put?

71
00:07:48,187 --> 00:07:49,188
"Andrea", sir.

72
00:07:49,213 --> 00:07:51,132
Or you can also put "Andi" instead.

73
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:52,520
Okay.

74
00:07:57,522 --> 00:08:00,358
Hold on.
Are you in my class?

75
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,709
No, sir.

76
00:08:02,908 --> 00:08:05,869
No? But are you in Liberal Arts?

77
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,348
Not as well, sir.

78
00:08:07,629 --> 00:08:10,382
I'm taking a business course. Economics.

79
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:14,013
My parents are the ones that...

80
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:18,210
I really do love writing, but...

81
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:22,403
Actually, I want to have a book
of my own like you someday.

82
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:24,255
Wow, thanks!

83
00:08:27,846 --> 00:08:30,567
- Okay, here's your signature.
- Thank you.

84
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,605
So what's your genre?

85
00:08:34,196 --> 00:08:37,032
Fiction, non-fictional, poetry?

86
00:08:37,956 --> 00:08:40,834
I'm not sure yet. I haven't
explored it yet.

87
00:08:40,834 --> 00:08:44,671
My parents don't want
me to pursue writing.

88
00:08:45,395 --> 00:08:47,981
They are the ones that
chose my course.

89
00:08:48,133 --> 00:08:53,138
Well, not all writers
studied writing.

90
00:08:53,639 --> 00:08:57,434
If you want to be an economist,
Then why not?

91
00:08:57,893 --> 00:09:01,927
Just be sure never to forget
about writing.

92
00:09:02,645 --> 00:09:04,731
If I may ask,
do you do journaling?

93
00:09:05,165 --> 00:09:08,377
No, sir. I don't have the time, yet.

94
00:09:08,528 --> 00:09:11,197
Okay, it's okay. It's
fine. It's totally fine.

95
00:09:11,624 --> 00:09:14,502
Okay. Next semester, get a writing class.

96
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,053
It will definitely help you.

97
00:09:16,167 --> 00:09:18,106
What are you teaching next sem?

98
00:09:18,194 --> 00:09:21,692
Well actually, I don't know yet.
But I might study leave.

99
00:09:22,299 --> 00:09:24,677
- Study leave?
- It's not definite yet.

100
00:09:33,348 --> 00:09:35,239
Do you like poetry?

101
00:09:35,264 --> 00:09:37,491
- Saks.
- "Saks"?

102
00:09:37,622 --> 00:09:38,728
It means, "just right."

103
00:09:38,753 --> 00:09:40,005
Oh. Just right?

104
00:09:40,304 --> 00:09:41,388
Okay.

105
00:09:41,413 --> 00:09:46,253
Maybe you can come by
later on my poetry reading

106
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:47,723
around seven pm?

107
00:09:48,492 --> 00:09:51,786
If that's good for you,
then I'll see you then.

108
00:09:54,341 --> 00:09:56,301
Come join me, please?

109
00:09:56,326 --> 00:09:58,703
- But I have somewhere to be.
- Where are you going, anyway?

110
00:09:58,728 --> 00:10:00,688
I'll be with my fellow
club members.

111
00:10:01,646 --> 00:10:03,523
What if I join you?

112
00:10:04,256 --> 00:10:07,384
What? You can't come.
You're not a member.

113
00:10:07,467 --> 00:10:08,660
What the heck.

114
00:10:09,057 --> 00:10:12,143
Well, just come with me, then.

115
00:10:12,168 --> 00:10:14,880
What am I going to do
during a poetry reading?

116
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:16,763
I'll fall asleep with
my eyes open.

117
00:10:16,805 --> 00:10:20,614
- I won't have company.
- That's okay.

118
00:10:22,975 --> 00:10:26,103
In the depths of solitude, I reside

119
00:10:26,723 --> 00:10:29,435
a world within where shadows hide.

120
00:10:43,949 --> 00:10:48,897
Good thing I found time
for all of us to meet.

121
00:10:51,582 --> 00:10:53,395
It's not near yet.

122
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,100
And it's not sure yet.

123
00:10:57,005 --> 00:10:58,715
Miss, are you all alone?

124
00:11:00,235 --> 00:11:04,074
Miss, I'm still talking to you. Don't
be so rude. Where are you going?

125
00:11:04,436 --> 00:11:06,074
- Are you going home?
- I don't want!

126
00:11:07,345 --> 00:11:08,598
Sir, don't!

127
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:11,737
- No. No!
- Come!

128
00:11:11,762 --> 00:11:13,473
- Hey! Buddy!
- I said no!

129
00:11:13,963 --> 00:11:15,256
Let go of her.

130
00:11:28,502 --> 00:11:29,503
Sir.

131
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,395
Oh, Andi.
Are you okay?

132
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:35,151
Thank you, sir.

133
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:39,702
Wait, wait.
Don't you have someone with you?

134
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,107
I don't.

135
00:11:41,782 --> 00:11:44,215
You should have
brought a friend with you.

136
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,826
My friend has
somewhere to be tonight.

137
00:11:47,927 --> 00:11:50,179
Wait. Where do you live?

138
00:11:50,473 --> 00:11:52,016
In España.

139
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,611
Okay, okay.

140
00:11:53,636 --> 00:11:55,513
- I'll take you home, okay?
- Sir, don't.

141
00:11:55,538 --> 00:11:56,873
- It's embarrassing.
- No, no, no.

142
00:11:56,898 --> 00:12:01,319
I invited you. You're my responsibility,
so I'll take you home.

143
00:12:01,344 --> 00:12:02,387
Okay?

144
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,395
Sir, you might want to have coffee first.

145
00:12:18,804 --> 00:12:20,014
Oh, no. I'm okay.

146
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,910
And I might wake your parents up.

147
00:12:21,935 --> 00:12:24,187
Oh, I live alone here.

148
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,895
So where's your family, then?

149
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,188
In Bukidnon.

150
00:12:31,022 --> 00:12:33,567
Oh, okay. So you're from there.

151
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:34,609
Yes, sir.

152
00:12:34,634 --> 00:12:37,094
Don't you get sad here being alone?

153
00:12:38,323 --> 00:12:43,433
Well, I've gotten used to being alone so
I no longer think if I'm sad or not.

154
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:45,390
Okay.

155
00:12:46,282 --> 00:12:47,675
Give me your phone.

156
00:12:47,984 --> 00:12:48,985
Sir?

157
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:50,909
Yup, give me your phone.

158
00:13:00,135 --> 00:13:02,721
There. I saved my number there.

159
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:06,177
If you need anything just
message me or call me.

160
00:13:06,433 --> 00:13:08,059
Thank you, sir.

161
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:10,940
Alright, have some rest now.

162
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:27,835
Buddy, let go of her.

163
00:13:31,308 --> 00:13:33,249
Andi, are you okay?

164
00:13:34,483 --> 00:13:36,068
Thank you, sir.

165
00:13:37,448 --> 00:13:41,898
I invited you. You're my responsibility,
so I'll take you home.

166
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,142
Okay?

167
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,679
Hi, sir!

168
00:15:48,704 --> 00:15:50,890
- Andi, yes?
- Here.

169
00:15:51,607 --> 00:15:54,360
- What's this for?
- A thank-you gift.

170
00:15:55,109 --> 00:15:56,123
Why?

171
00:15:56,148 --> 00:15:58,062
For bringing me home.

172
00:15:58,554 --> 00:16:00,540
What do you mean?
That was nothing.

173
00:16:00,565 --> 00:16:06,109
You know I appreciate this but it's better
if you just give this to your classmates.

174
00:16:06,898 --> 00:16:09,726
But I baked these cookies for you.

175
00:16:09,905 --> 00:16:12,968
I even had a hard time mixing
because I don't have a mixer.

176
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,890
Okay, I appreciate the effort. Thank you.

177
00:16:19,501 --> 00:16:24,189
Sir, didn't you tell me to take an
elective writing class next semester?

178
00:16:24,214 --> 00:16:29,344
I couldn't wait so I applied to
Jocelyn Escribo's workshop.

179
00:16:29,369 --> 00:16:30,829
Hey, she's good!

180
00:16:30,999 --> 00:16:33,334
You'll learn a lot from her.

181
00:16:33,516 --> 00:16:34,640
- I know.
- That's good.

182
00:16:34,665 --> 00:16:38,804
Well, her workshops take place
every weekend for two months

183
00:16:38,829 --> 00:16:40,914
- and I have my manuscript here.
- Okay.

184
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:46,476
Can you check this and let me
know about your feedback?

185
00:16:46,501 --> 00:16:47,502
Sure.

186
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:49,249
Thank you, sir.

187
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:51,679
It's only five pages.

188
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:55,704
Sure, okay. I'll read this and
give you my comments after.

189
00:16:55,729 --> 00:16:57,439
Okay. When?

190
00:16:59,253 --> 00:17:00,569
I'll just message you.

191
00:17:00,834 --> 00:17:03,304
Okay, sir.
In your office? Or...

192
00:17:03,329 --> 00:17:04,998
No, maybe in the cafeteria instead.

193
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:07,507
- Okay, sir.
- Okay, thank you.

194
00:17:07,507 --> 00:17:09,156
Thank you.
See you.

195
00:17:17,726 --> 00:17:19,978
Andi, sorry. Have you been
here for a while?

196
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:21,312
It's fine, sir.

197
00:17:21,635 --> 00:17:22,678
Sorry, sorry.

198
00:17:23,053 --> 00:17:27,156
But, good news.
I've read your manuscript.

199
00:17:27,363 --> 00:17:29,615
Sir, right now? Let's make an order first.

200
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,288
Sure, okay.

201
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,750
What coffee would you like, sir?

202
00:17:41,291 --> 00:17:44,377
Actually, black coffee would be great.

203
00:17:45,671 --> 00:17:48,523
Black coffee, please.
I'd like some water, too.

204
00:17:48,548 --> 00:17:49,562
Thank you.

205
00:17:50,370 --> 00:17:53,061
- Did you like my cookies?
- Yes?

206
00:17:53,344 --> 00:17:54,695
Cookies...

207
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,001
Saks.

208
00:17:57,225 --> 00:18:00,413
Wait, did I say it right? "Saks"?

209
00:18:00,438 --> 00:18:02,231
Yes, or possibly "suck."

210
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:07,066
Okay, can we proceed
now to my comments?

211
00:18:07,192 --> 00:18:09,110
Hold on, I'll take notes.

212
00:18:09,374 --> 00:18:10,583
Okay, sure.

213
00:18:14,088 --> 00:18:15,945
Actually, it was fun to read.

214
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:17,873
Short, but sweet.

215
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,085
And I liked how you
built up the suspense.

216
00:18:22,310 --> 00:18:25,021
The way you make your
readers feel unpleasant

217
00:18:25,074 --> 00:18:28,257
but it ends differently.
I like it, though.

218
00:18:29,353 --> 00:18:31,802
- Thank you, sir.
- You're welcome.

219
00:18:32,877 --> 00:18:34,726
- Hi!
- Irene!

220
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,470
- How are you?
- Hi.

221
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:39,115
What time did your classes end?

222
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:40,934
- I have more.
- Oh, yeah?

223
00:18:41,055 --> 00:18:43,189
I need my caffeine fix.

224
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,672
By the way, Irene, this is Andi.

225
00:18:45,772 --> 00:18:47,257
Hi!
Is she your student?

226
00:18:47,282 --> 00:18:51,812
No, but she's into writing. So I'm
giving some pointers. It might help.

227
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:55,494
And, Andi, this is Irene Nolasco.

228
00:18:55,519 --> 00:18:56,812
Hi, Miss Nolasco.

229
00:18:56,837 --> 00:18:58,718
Hi.
So can I join you, guys?

230
00:18:58,743 --> 00:19:00,203
- Sure.
- No, ma'am.

231
00:19:00,286 --> 00:19:01,287
Pardon?

232
00:19:01,329 --> 00:19:05,208
Sorry. I'm not confident
with my writing yet.

233
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:07,543
I want to show this
to Sir Joaquin first, so...

234
00:19:08,038 --> 00:19:09,054
I'm sorry.

235
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:11,123
But your writing is fine, Andi.

236
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:14,053
Sir, I would really like it
to be just the two of us.

237
00:19:14,969 --> 00:19:17,931
It's okay. I'll leave the two
of you guys alone.

238
00:19:17,956 --> 00:19:20,210
I just remembered I still have
some things to do.

239
00:19:20,235 --> 00:19:21,421
- Okay.
- I'll see you.

240
00:19:21,446 --> 00:19:22,447
Bye.

241
00:19:22,813 --> 00:19:24,981
So, Andi, I think we're good.

242
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:29,026
Actually, I have to go since
I'm catching an appointment.

243
00:19:29,686 --> 00:19:31,279
So, I'll see you around. Okay?

244
00:19:31,695 --> 00:19:33,906
- Alright.
- Take care.

245
00:20:06,766 --> 00:20:07,767
Andi?

246
00:20:16,529 --> 00:20:18,101
- Andi...
- What?

247
00:20:18,126 --> 00:20:19,920
- Andi.
- What did you say?

248
00:20:19,984 --> 00:20:21,819
Oh, nothing.
Nothing.

249
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,898
- Sir!
- Sir, I have a question.

250
00:20:34,898 --> 00:20:35,898
Yes?

251
00:20:36,149 --> 00:20:38,860
- Can you move the deadline?
- Please do, sir.

252
00:20:38,885 --> 00:20:40,935
Sure. No problem.

253
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,992
Hopefully, we can start the
new topic next week.

254
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:47,800
Cool! That's why you're my favorite!

255
00:20:48,019 --> 00:20:51,992
What's our next topic, anyway?
We want to be prepared for it.

256
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:54,853
Hopefully, it wouldn't
be too complicated.

257
00:20:54,878 --> 00:20:57,255
I hope so too.

258
00:20:57,561 --> 00:20:58,598
Sir!

259
00:20:58,623 --> 00:21:00,292
- I'll go ahead, sir.
- Okay.

260
00:21:00,711 --> 00:21:02,445
- Yes?
- Sir.

261
00:21:02,548 --> 00:21:06,260
I have a new manuscript
and I want you to read it.

262
00:21:06,649 --> 00:21:07,718
Are you busy?

263
00:21:08,002 --> 00:21:12,796
Sure. Just e-mail it to me, then I'll
send my comments to you. Alright?

264
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:16,132
It would be better if you give
your feedback in real time.

265
00:21:16,837 --> 00:21:20,749
I'll e-mail it to you then
let's meet for thirty minutes?

266
00:21:20,774 --> 00:21:24,736
No, no, no, no. It's okay.
Just e-mail it to me.

267
00:21:25,264 --> 00:21:26,265
Okay?

268
00:21:29,224 --> 00:21:30,249
Sir!

269
00:21:30,601 --> 00:21:31,788
- Sir!
- Yes?

270
00:21:31,813 --> 00:21:32,814
Yes?

271
00:21:33,318 --> 00:21:34,820
Are you avoiding me?

272
00:21:35,233 --> 00:21:37,697
No! No, I'm not.
Why?

273
00:21:38,929 --> 00:21:42,140
Because you declined my
offer to have coffee, and...

274
00:21:42,429 --> 00:21:44,550
I call, I text, but
you don't answer.

275
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:45,584
No, no, no.

276
00:21:45,609 --> 00:21:47,495
I'm really sorry. I'm just...

277
00:21:47,495 --> 00:21:50,123
I'm just really busy.
I have a lot of stuff to do.

278
00:21:50,164 --> 00:21:52,041
Just e-mail it to me, okay?

279
00:22:12,069 --> 00:22:16,155
Hey, Eugene's admission letter
has been received by N.U.S.

280
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,218
- Wow!
- How about yours?

281
00:22:18,476 --> 00:22:19,811
- Mine?
- Yeah.

282
00:22:21,241 --> 00:22:23,405
Oh, nothing. Maybe I didn't get accepted.

283
00:22:23,656 --> 00:22:26,367
That's impossible. Maybe
it just got delayed.

284
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:27,754
Well, I hope so.

285
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,803
Answer it.

286
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,352
No, it's okay.
Maybe later.

287
00:22:36,491 --> 00:22:38,729
It might be important.
Who is that anyway?

288
00:22:38,754 --> 00:22:40,655
Just a student bugging me.

289
00:22:41,502 --> 00:22:44,702
Well, aren't you Mr. Congeniality?

290
00:23:13,478 --> 00:23:14,663
Yes, Andi?

291
00:23:14,688 --> 00:23:16,007
Hi, sir.

292
00:23:16,206 --> 00:23:19,155
The door was open
so I came in.

293
00:23:21,492 --> 00:23:24,554
Yes, what's up?

294
00:23:25,945 --> 00:23:32,780
I have a poem and I wanted your input
before I submit it next week.

295
00:23:33,819 --> 00:23:34,862
Okay.

296
00:23:35,494 --> 00:23:38,452
Don't worry, sir.
This is going to be quick.

297
00:23:39,007 --> 00:23:40,366
Just a quickie. I mean...

298
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:42,670
- I'm sorry?
- Just quick.

299
00:23:45,808 --> 00:23:48,132
Oh, come on, Andi.

300
00:23:48,157 --> 00:23:49,450
Please, no.

301
00:23:49,818 --> 00:23:51,861
Sir, I know you want this.

302
00:23:53,346 --> 00:23:54,999
I know you want this.

303
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:56,561
Andi, please.

304
00:23:57,044 --> 00:23:58,170
Sir...

305
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:08,419
Andi. Andi, please.
Can you not?

306
00:24:08,659 --> 00:24:09,660
No!

307
00:24:10,222 --> 00:24:12,893
Sir, no one will know.

308
00:24:41,353 --> 00:24:42,562
Andi!

309
00:24:51,074 --> 00:24:52,077
Andi!

310
00:27:06,527 --> 00:27:07,945
Are you okay?

311
00:27:15,239 --> 00:27:16,968
Good afternoon, ma'am.

312
00:27:31,536 --> 00:27:33,452
- Joaquin, are you okay?
- Yes.

313
00:27:40,084 --> 00:27:41,132
Are you okay?

314
00:27:42,326 --> 00:27:43,733
It's nothing.

315
00:27:44,206 --> 00:27:45,717
Maybe I'm just tired.

316
00:27:46,853 --> 00:27:49,443
I know something is wrong.

317
00:27:56,369 --> 00:27:57,451
Nothing is wrong.

318
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,779
I know something is wrong.
Tell me.

319
00:28:15,601 --> 00:28:17,843
- Look, Joaquin.
- Yes?

320
00:28:17,843 --> 00:28:20,179
You can tell me everything.

321
00:28:21,418 --> 00:28:23,102
I will not judge you.

322
00:28:24,741 --> 00:28:27,981
Do you have a relationship
with your student?

323
00:28:36,483 --> 00:28:37,538
Okay...

324
00:28:39,772 --> 00:28:41,203
Something happened between us.

325
00:28:41,730 --> 00:28:44,540
But it's just a one-time thing.

326
00:28:45,621 --> 00:28:47,206
I'm getting nervous.

327
00:28:48,764 --> 00:28:50,766
I regret it, Irene.

328
00:28:51,661 --> 00:28:52,828
I don't know.

329
00:28:52,912 --> 00:28:55,331
Maybe tomorrow I
won't be here anymore.

330
00:28:55,592 --> 00:28:58,595
My profession, my career will be ruined.

331
00:29:00,468 --> 00:29:02,161
I just don't know what to do.

332
00:29:02,961 --> 00:29:05,227
Don't blame yourself.

333
00:29:05,901 --> 00:29:09,321
- You're not a bad person.
- I hope so.

334
00:29:11,547 --> 00:29:13,120
It's going to be okay.

335
00:29:14,248 --> 00:29:15,988
It's going to be okay.

336
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:38,716
Sir!

337
00:29:38,757 --> 00:29:40,694
- Andi.
- How are you?

338
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:44,099
I'm sorry but I have a class.
I'll see you.

339
00:29:44,932 --> 00:29:46,059
Sir.

340
00:29:48,809 --> 00:29:49,810
Sir.

341
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:54,676
Joaquin!

342
00:29:55,385 --> 00:29:56,512
Andi.

343
00:29:57,038 --> 00:29:58,260
What do you want from me?

344
00:29:58,285 --> 00:30:00,032
After what happened between us,

345
00:30:02,014 --> 00:30:03,577
you're just going to avoid me?

346
00:30:05,748 --> 00:30:06,765
Andi,

347
00:30:07,844 --> 00:30:10,584
You're the one who wanted it.
You forced me.

348
00:30:10,898 --> 00:30:13,726
Sir, admit that you wanted it too.

349
00:30:13,751 --> 00:30:15,835
You know that I really love you, right?

350
00:30:16,842 --> 00:30:19,051
Please, Andi.
That's not true.

351
00:30:19,373 --> 00:30:20,844
Why are you denying it?

352
00:30:21,557 --> 00:30:22,558
Okay...

353
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,183
You're too young, Andi.

354
00:30:27,053 --> 00:30:29,597
You'll meet a lot of other people.

355
00:30:30,835 --> 00:30:33,815
Whatever happened between us,
just forget it.

356
00:30:34,363 --> 00:30:36,657
Forget about me, okay?

357
00:30:38,608 --> 00:30:40,374
- Andi, please.
- No, I don't want to forget.

358
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:41,452
- Andi!
- No!

359
00:30:41,477 --> 00:30:43,992
- I don't want to. I don't want to!
- Please!

360
00:31:02,536 --> 00:31:04,913
- Hey, Joaquin. Congratulations!
- Bobby!

361
00:31:04,985 --> 00:31:05,928
For what?

362
00:31:05,953 --> 00:31:09,081
For getting into the
graduate program at N.U.S.

363
00:31:09,278 --> 00:31:11,196
I haven't even received
a letter yet.

364
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:13,452
It's addressed to the department chair.

365
00:31:13,579 --> 00:31:16,066
Hold on.
Is this a prank?

366
00:31:16,535 --> 00:31:19,288
Sir Joaquin, you're being called by
the dean to his office.

367
00:31:19,467 --> 00:31:23,163
- But why?
- That's it! He'll be congratulating you.

368
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:24,744
I hope.

369
00:31:29,937 --> 00:31:30,976
Hi, Dean.

370
00:31:31,207 --> 00:31:32,499
Sit down, Joaquin.

371
00:31:38,184 --> 00:31:39,298
What is this about, Dean?

372
00:31:40,228 --> 00:31:43,929
A complaint letter
from Andrea Saavedra.

373
00:31:46,129 --> 00:31:47,214
Andrea?

374
00:31:47,837 --> 00:31:49,255
Sexual harassment.

375
00:31:50,661 --> 00:31:53,312
Dean, you know me.
You know I can't do this!

376
00:31:54,202 --> 00:31:56,023
Do I really know you, Joaquin?

377
00:31:56,601 --> 00:32:01,028
Why would this lady lie?
What's in it for her?

378
00:32:20,476 --> 00:32:22,674
Why are you doing this, Andi?

379
00:32:23,211 --> 00:32:26,772
Why are you doing this?
Why do you have to lie?

380
00:32:27,009 --> 00:32:29,179
I'm just telling them
what happened between us.

381
00:32:29,204 --> 00:32:31,343
Stop. Please.

382
00:32:34,308 --> 00:32:37,895
Can you take back
what you told the dean?

383
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:39,396
Stop this!

384
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:41,951
First of all, Andi...

385
00:32:42,483 --> 00:32:46,323
We were never together, we
had nothing, and I do not like you.

386
00:32:49,064 --> 00:32:50,524
Is that right, sir?

387
00:32:52,336 --> 00:32:53,580
Nothing, then.

388
00:32:55,649 --> 00:32:57,667
You have nothing left,
including your career.

389
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:01,064
Andi.

390
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:02,318
Andi!

391
00:33:03,650 --> 00:33:04,651
Andi!

392
00:33:07,925 --> 00:33:08,926
Andi!

393
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,060
Andi!

394
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:18,532
Andi!

395
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,566
So, what name should I put?

396
00:33:24,333 --> 00:33:25,695
Andi, sir.

397
00:33:25,865 --> 00:33:27,074
Andi.

398
00:33:29,504 --> 00:33:30,672
Andi!

399
00:33:36,395 --> 00:33:40,961
I told him I wanted to show
him the poem that I wrote.

400
00:33:43,007 --> 00:33:45,882
But he said we should do it
in his office.

401
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:48,677
Then what?

402
00:33:50,923 --> 00:33:52,472
Do you have a boyfriend?

403
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,097
I don't.

404
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:58,433
You don't? With that beauty of yours,
you don't have a boyfriend?

405
00:33:58,475 --> 00:34:00,602
- I don't.
- That's so sad.

406
00:34:03,043 --> 00:34:05,026
So are you doing anything tonight?

407
00:34:11,368 --> 00:34:12,812
He held me.

408
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:14,757
Andi, wait!

409
00:34:15,468 --> 00:34:17,038
Where are you going? Let's drink.

410
00:34:17,319 --> 00:34:20,055
- I have to go to class, sir.
- The night is young.

411
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:21,793
I'm good, sir.

412
00:34:23,930 --> 00:34:27,215
I said no, Dean.
I said I didn't want to, but...

413
00:34:28,841 --> 00:34:29,968
But what?

414
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:34,528
Wait. Where do you live, Andi?

415
00:34:34,765 --> 00:34:35,826
I'm okay.

416
00:34:35,851 --> 00:34:37,726
I'll take you home, okay?

417
00:34:37,991 --> 00:34:40,476
I'll be the one to take you.
Just leave it to me.

418
00:34:44,458 --> 00:34:46,902
- He forced me.
- That's not true!

419
00:34:49,376 --> 00:34:52,249
- He hurt me.
- You're a liar, Andi.

420
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:55,108
You came to me.
You seduced me!

421
00:35:09,093 --> 00:35:13,030
Joaquin, enough.
Let's go.

422
00:35:17,101 --> 00:35:18,429
You know what, Irene?

423
00:35:20,468 --> 00:35:21,636
I've lost...

424
00:35:23,067 --> 00:35:25,110
I've lost hope.

425
00:35:27,024 --> 00:35:29,819
Everything that I worked
hard for are gone.

426
00:35:31,179 --> 00:35:33,615
My degree is also gone.

427
00:35:34,208 --> 00:35:35,334
What now?

428
00:35:35,582 --> 00:35:38,578
All my hard work, Irene, they're gone.

429
00:35:39,455 --> 00:35:41,998
Just because of that one mistake.

430
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:52,508
Joaquin.

431
00:36:15,821 --> 00:36:20,245
We did an investigation and
we've come up with a conclusion.

432
00:36:21,808 --> 00:36:22,905
Yes, Dean?

433
00:36:23,591 --> 00:36:25,092
I'm sorry, Joaquin.

434
00:36:27,105 --> 00:36:29,232
I am very sorry that I doubted you.

435
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,259
I should have known that
you would never do that.

436
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:33,924
What?

437
00:36:35,549 --> 00:36:37,259
We are dropping the complaint.

438
00:36:37,345 --> 00:36:42,132
No, Dean. That's unfair. You're
favoring him after what he did to me?

439
00:36:42,493 --> 00:36:45,704
We have witnesses that said
you made that all up.

440
00:36:45,729 --> 00:36:49,866
Everything you wrote in
this complaint letter are lies.

441
00:36:50,250 --> 00:36:54,101
You are the one that keeps
going after Mr. Jimenez.

442
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:56,412
And when he didn't give you a chance,

443
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:02,546
You made up accusations against
him to get revenge.

444
00:37:06,468 --> 00:37:09,312
Dean, Joaquin is innocent.

445
00:37:09,564 --> 00:37:12,312
I know the student that made
a complaint against him.

446
00:37:12,944 --> 00:37:16,690
Whenever Joaquin and I are together,
Andi keeps calling him on the phone.

447
00:37:16,715 --> 00:37:18,085
Joaquin doesn't answer.

448
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,904
He would reject her
calls and her messages.

449
00:37:21,177 --> 00:37:23,846
Are you sure about these, Irene?

450
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:26,767
Yes, Dean. I, myself, have heard

451
00:37:27,114 --> 00:37:30,982
that Andi admitted to Joaquin
that she's in love with him.

452
00:37:32,427 --> 00:37:37,113
Andrea, because of what you did,
you have to face disciplinary action.

453
00:37:37,747 --> 00:37:40,291
No, Dean. That's unfair.
They're lying.

454
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:45,163
They're teaming up against me. That Irene
is covering up what Joaquin did to me.

455
00:37:45,911 --> 00:37:49,748
Andrea, you may
step out of my office.

456
00:37:49,855 --> 00:37:52,817
No.
It's unfair, Dean.

457
00:37:53,101 --> 00:37:57,064
Who I want to talk to are your
parents or whoever your guardian is.

458
00:37:57,089 --> 00:37:58,927
There's nothing else
that we can talk about.

459
00:38:26,296 --> 00:38:29,037
She's the one who filed a harassment
case against a professor, right?

460
00:38:29,062 --> 00:38:30,856
But it got dismissed.

461
00:38:31,027 --> 00:38:34,238
Well, as it turns out,
she's the one obsessed with the teacher.

462
00:38:34,263 --> 00:38:39,585
Pathetic, isn't she? Doesn't she have
friends who call her out? My god!

463
00:38:40,011 --> 00:38:41,803
Belle!
Belle.

464
00:38:42,368 --> 00:38:45,746
Andi, please.
Not now.

465
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:46,493
Irene, thank you for the save.

466
00:39:47,444 --> 00:39:51,748
I only said what
I saw and what I heard.

467
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:55,227
That girl? She was obsessed with you.

468
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:58,366
I was just being friendly to her.

469
00:39:58,391 --> 00:40:02,104
- Just quit trying to be Mr. Congeniality.
- Okay.

470
00:40:02,129 --> 00:40:05,525
- No more Mr. Nice Guy.
- Okay, okay.

471
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:09,124
I'm not really a "nice guy."
You know that.

472
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,387
I also have dark secrets.

473
00:40:11,853 --> 00:40:13,522
But thank you.

474
00:40:14,822 --> 00:40:16,240
You're welcome.

475
00:40:21,692 --> 00:40:23,947
So, do you want me to take you home?

476
00:40:24,295 --> 00:40:27,655
No need, my brother will pick me up.
How about you?

477
00:40:28,484 --> 00:40:32,197
I've booked a ride,
so he'll be here in seven minutes.

478
00:40:32,222 --> 00:40:34,641
- Are you sure?
- Yeah. Okay, I'll see you in school?

479
00:40:34,824 --> 00:40:35,913
- See you.
- Bye.

480
00:40:35,938 --> 00:40:37,468
- You be safe.
- You too.

481
00:40:57,244 --> 00:40:59,482
- Yes?
- Hello, sir.

482
00:41:00,269 --> 00:41:01,609
Did you miss me?
