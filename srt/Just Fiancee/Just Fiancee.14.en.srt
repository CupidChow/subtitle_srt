2
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,110
(Su Yu's home)
I had no other options.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,810
Please, let Mai go home with us.

4
00:00:17,810 --> 00:00:18,190
Don't touch me!

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:19,670
That's enough!

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:23,430
Grandpa!

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,610
Leave, now.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,150
When Mai comes back,

9
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,150
please tell her about it.

10
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:32,430
Thank you.

11
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,310
Yu.

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:38,110
What is this all about?

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,910
Don't lie to me!

14
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:44,290
The truth is,

15
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,230
she is not Gu Manman.

16
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:47,670
What?

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,570
(Qiao Mai's home)

18
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,370
Mai,

19
00:00:58,010 --> 00:00:58,970
you are back!

20
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:00,590
Did you have a fight with your husband?

21
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:02,370
I'm tired.

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:03,170
I need to rest.

23
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:03,850
Mai!

24
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,490
The Su family is wealthy.

25
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:07,530
You must not let Su Yu go.

26
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:08,810
Just bear with it and it will be fine.

27
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:09,530
Your younger brother

28
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:11,010
needs you to pay for his college fees.

29
00:01:11,290 --> 00:01:12,650
And I need money to live.

30
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:13,330
Do you understand?

31
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,490
Life's hard for your mom.

32
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:15,090
It's really not easy!

33
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,290
Starting from tomorrow,

34
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,730
I will go back to work.

35
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,850
There is some money left in this card.

36
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:25,810
Take it and buy some clothes for Xiaoguang.

37
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:27,780
I wouldn't want him

38
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:28,930
to be looked down upon in college.

39
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,730
Mai!

40
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,590
Explain yourself.

41
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:34,870
Go on.

42
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:36,510
OK.

43
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,110
But you must promise me, Grandpa.

44
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:40,710
You must continue with the operation.

45
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:42,260
The doctor said that

46
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:43,470
this time you'd have a good chance.

47
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,710
Don't lie to me.

48
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:47,190
My illness is incurable.

49
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,910
I thought

50
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:50,110
I could witness you

51
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,430
and Manman getting married

52
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:53,110
and living a happy life.

53
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,630
But I guess

54
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,170
I don't have the luck.

55
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:58,010
Grandpa!

56
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,030
Yu,

57
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:02,430
were you two

58
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:05,910
only doing it because of the contract?

59
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:07,950
Yes.

60
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:10,230
There was nothing more.

61
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:11,750
In my opinion,

62
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,510
Qiao Mai really has feelings for you.

63
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,170
In fact, I like her a lot.

64
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:19,050
Luo Da.

65
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,970
Let's go.

66
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,550
Yu,

67
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:27,710
you should ask yourself what you really feel.

68
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:28,390
Let's go.

69
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:51,290
Su Yu.

70
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:52,330
What?

71
00:02:57,210 --> 00:02:58,530
The only one person in this world

72
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,930
that loved me

73
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,730
has left me.

74
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:06,890
Don't worry.

75
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:07,970
You have me.

76
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,850
No matter what problems you face,

77
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:11,010
I will help you deal with them.

78
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:25,370
Qiao Mai!

79
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:26,890
As a lifeguard,

80
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,090
what matters the most?

81
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,490
Faith!

82
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,250
Wrong!

83
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,290
It's to always get warmed up!

84
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,370
You can only help others

85
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,290
after you are fully warmed up.

86
00:03:33,410 --> 00:03:33,890
That's enough!

87
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,890
Raise your left hand!

88
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:39,850
Your left hand!
