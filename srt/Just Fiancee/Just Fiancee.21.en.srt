2
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,870
Where did you take Su Yu?

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,830
Tell me now!

4
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,030
Su Yu?

5
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:21,190
In a few hours' time,

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,750
Max Group will be mine.

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,510
When that moment comes,

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,950
he might end up like your sister

9
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,550
and kill himself.

10
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:32,150
No.

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,790
I have to look for him.

12
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:35,120
(Six months ago)

13
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:35,710
(Six months ago)
Dad.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,110
You are home.

15
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,310
How is your relationship with Su Yu?

16
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:41,590
Have you found the chance to do it?

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:43,350
(Gu Manman)

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,190
I told you!

19
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:45,390
Emotions

20
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:47,190
are the most useless things in the world.

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:49,790
Come here.

22
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:53,790
We must

23
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,110
make the Gu family great again!

24
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:57,350
You must use our connection

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,350
with Senior Su

26
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:00,070
and marry Su Yu.

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:01,520
After that I want you

28
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,470
to get that thumb drive.

29
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:03,430
No!

30
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:03,840
If I do that,

31
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,990
Su Yu will hate me for eternity!

32
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,110
You are my daughter,

33
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:07,790
yet you won't listen to me?

34
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:08,390
That's enough!

35
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:11,270
Your sister died because of him!

36
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:12,470
Yet you still want to help him!

37
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,310
You are just as rebellious as your sister!

38
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,790
I pity my sister

39
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:17,110
for having a father like you.

40
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,870
You were the reason she killed herself!

41
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,110
Do you know how much she liked Su Yu?

42
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:25,030
Yet you forced her

43
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,110
to steal from the person she loved the most!

44
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:29,630
You are a monster!

45
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,750
A monster that will use his own daughters!

46
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,520
Why are you still pretending

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,470
to be a good person?

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,990
Take her!

49
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,190
Don't touch me.

50
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,750
I get it now.

51
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,430
Luo Da, you've been a great actor.

52
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,430
Tell me,

53
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:47,900
how long have you

54
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:48,790
been working for the Gu family?

55
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:52,030
The day I realized I want more.

56
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:53,110
What Mr. Gu offered me

57
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:55,390
is so much more than my lousy salary.

58
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:56,950
Mr. Gu and I
have been friends for a long time.

59
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,390
What you people want

60
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,630
is more than lowering Max's stock prices

61
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,590
and buying it out, right?

62
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,310
What else do you want?

63
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,150
Tell me.

64
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,350
The password to this.

65
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:06,160
You threatened me

66
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,750
with my company's stock prices.

67
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,990
I bet you know very well

68
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,750
the value of this thumb drive.

69
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,190
What if we add Qiao Mai to the equation?

70
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,190
I dare you!

71
00:02:21,630 --> 00:02:22,030
Fine.

72
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,230
Take me to him.

73
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,270
What are you going to do?

74
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,910
Call Su Yu now

75
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:35,190
and make him tell us the password.

76
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:36,750
I will not.

77
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:39,750
Stop it!

78
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,110
Su Yu.

79
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:47,870
What's the password?

80
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,870
Mr. Gu.

81
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:55,920
You have been hiding here

82
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,750
and waiting for years.

83
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,750
You can wait a little longer.

84
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,030
Beat him up!

85
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,230
What's the password?

86
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,670
If you stop now,

87
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,750
I can give you some property

88
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,950
for Qiao Mai and Gu Manman's sake.

89
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,860
Do you think you have

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,910
the upper hand right now?

91
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:22,390
You want me to wait?

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,190
For what?

93
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:26,830
I'm waiting

94
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,670
for three sounds.

95
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:30,990
Mr. Gu.

96
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:31,910
Look at this.

97
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,030
All the stocks of Max Group

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,430
were bought out by the Lin Group.

99
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,270
What?

100
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,710
(Max Group)

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,150
Mr. Lin.

102
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:44,550
Starting from today...

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,970
All the stocks of Max Group

104
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,950
belong to us,

105
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,150
- the Lin family.
- The Lin family.

106
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:51,950
Move aside!

107
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,710
Who are you working for?

108
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:04,270
We are with the Jiayan Group.

109
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:05,460
Mr. Su said that you might

110
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,230
come to Xiaolin Bay

111
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:06,950
and it would be dangerous.

112
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:07,990
So he asked us to follow you.

113
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,070
He...

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,070
Where is he now?

115
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,870
Take me to him.

116
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:12,550
OK.

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,270
Hand those people to the police.

118
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,470
Miss Qiao,

119
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:15,910
this way please.

120
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,090
Su Yu!

121
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,790
Su Yu, are you alright?

122
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,050
Mai.

123
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,340
Do you want both your daughters

124
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:43,930
to die because of you?
