2
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,190
Remember to think of me.

3
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:17,780
I'll definitely miss

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:19,430
the instant noodles you made.

5
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:21,870
Silly boy. What's good about instant noodles?

6
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,870
I brought you something.

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:26,270
This is for mosquito bites.

8
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:28,710
This is for car sickness.

9
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:32,150
This is for cuts or scratches.

10
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:34,470
And this one...

11
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:38,950
What's this?

12
00:00:39,110 --> 00:00:40,790
This is pepper spray.

13
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:43,110
Are you using it against me?

14
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:43,910
Yes.

15
00:00:53,130 --> 00:00:54,130
Where did you learn this from?

16
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:56,170
TV dramas.

17
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,450
Show me

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:03,090
how much you've learned.

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,610
You look tired.

20
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:38,770
Why don't you go back in and get some rest?

21
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,250
It's all your fault.

22
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:41,690
Oh, it's my fault?

23
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:44,930
Remember to take care of Grandpa for me.

24
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:47,410
Also, no matter what happens to me,

25
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:49,570
do not go to Xiaolin Bay to look for me.

26
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,330
Why can't I go look for you?

27
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:54,410
If you come looking for me,

28
00:01:54,410 --> 00:01:55,930
I won't be able to work.

29
00:01:58,250 --> 00:01:58,840
Mr. Gu wants to know if you

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,320
have found the password

31
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,000
for the thumb drive.

32
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:00,970
Not yet.

33
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:02,250
You have ten minutes.

34
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:03,970
I'll ask Zhang Yang to stall them. Go.

35
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:11,610
Chairman.

36
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:12,660
There is something wrong

37
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,330
with the car's ignition system.

38
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:14,250
It won't start.

39
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:15,810
What?

40
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,090
I've been waiting for you for so long.

41
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:17,970
Where is Luo Da?

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:25,010
Luo Da is not feeling well.

43
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:26,180
How could he drop the ball

44
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,570
at such a crucial moment!

45
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:29,610
Where is my phone?

46
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:30,410
I'll fetch it for you.

47
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,570
Luo Da?

48
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:09,050
I thought you weren't feeling well.

49
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:10,530
Miss Qiao,

50
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,530
what are you doing up here?

51
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:21,850
I'm looking for Su Yu's cellphone.

52
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,410
Cellphone?

53
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:24,530
That's right.

54
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:26,850
I came looking for his phone.

55
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:27,610
He left it here.

56
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,850
Luo Da,

57
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,530
wake me up when we get there.

58
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,130
Alright, Chairman.
