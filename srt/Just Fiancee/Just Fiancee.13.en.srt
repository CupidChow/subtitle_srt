00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:15,430
Manman,

3
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,230
do you remember

4
00:00:16,450 --> 00:00:18,030
Aunt Wang who lived downstairs from us?

5
00:00:18,230 --> 00:00:19,550
We'd always buy some lollipops

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:20,870
from her after school.

7
00:00:21,230 --> 00:00:22,430
I liked the strawberry flavor

8
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,390
and you liked the Lychee flavor.

9
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:24,710
Right.

10
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,090
It was so delicious.

11
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,950
That flavor.

12
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:27,950
Every time,

13
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:29,130
I'd take your lollipop

14
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,330
and give it a try.

15
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,630
Then you'd run after me.

16
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,430
You know what?

17
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,710
The spicy snacks we had back then

18
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,030
were only sold in Aunt Wang's store.

19
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:35,550
Gu Manman!

20
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,170
I got you!

21
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:36,870
Super tasty...

22
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,790
Brother,

23
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:43,150
why are you having dinner here?

24
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,470
I didn't expect to see you here, Gu Manman!

25
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:48,710
Lin Shaoshao,

26
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:49,510
what are you doing?

27
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,350
Stop interrupting my date with Manman.

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:53,070
This is such a rare opportunity!

29
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:55,470
No way.

30
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:56,550
What?

31
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,510
I told someone else to come.

32
00:01:00,070 --> 00:01:01,070
Who?

33
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:15,630
Manman,

34
00:01:15,830 --> 00:01:16,470
don't you remember?

35
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:17,070
And aunt Li who

36
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:17,830
lived downstairs from us.

37
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:19,110
The soda pop she sold

38
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:20,310
was amazing!

39
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,290
Every time after school...

40
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:23,390
What stories do you want me to tell you?

41
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,130
I want you to tell me bedtime stories.

42
00:01:33,050 --> 00:01:33,490
Stop right there.

43
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:34,770
Come back.

44
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:39,070
What?

45
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:40,310
Am I broke or something?

46
00:01:40,510 --> 00:01:41,390
Why did you look for him?

47
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,190
What are you talking about?

48
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:45,950
Why don't you let me go first?

49
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,430
Your sudden

50
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,390
closeness with him!

51
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,190
It can't be for love, can it?

52
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:53,070
Of course it is love!

53
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:54,110
Mind your own business!

54
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:54,910
Mind your own business!

55
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,190
I'm just worried

56
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:03,030
he might find out about our secret.

57
00:02:03,110 --> 00:02:04,510
I don't need him to reveal it.

58
00:02:04,850 --> 00:02:06,110
I'll tell him the truth now!

59
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:07,790
You never did it for my grandpa.

60
00:02:07,790 --> 00:02:08,790
It was all an act!

61
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,590
You were in it just for the money, right?

62
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,770
Su Yu,

63
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,930
I don't want to see you anymore!

64
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:20,590
Manman!

65
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:44,730
Hey.

66
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:46,730
Su Yu!

67
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:48,410
Didn't I tell you to go back first?

68
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:50,330
I want to tell you something.

69
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:51,570
Come here.

70
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:55,010
What?

71
00:02:56,730 --> 00:02:57,690
Kiss me.

72
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,410
You must be mad.

73
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:03,410
How about I spend the night at your place?

74
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,410
Get a cab and go home!

75
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,090
I don't think

76
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,930
Ms. Gu is coming home tonight.

77
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:11,770
Won't you feel lonely

78
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:12,930
sleeping alone tonight?

79
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:16,730
Seriously,

80
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,210
Su Yu.

81
00:03:17,330 --> 00:03:18,410
I don't know what you see

82
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,450
in Gu Manman!

83
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,930
I've looked into it.

84
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:21,930
Before she left,

85
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:24,070
she stole all of your company's

86
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,630
most important secrets.

87
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:25,410
She's even more cold-blooded

88
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,130
than me!

89
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:27,330
Enough!

90
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:29,170
Why should I?

91
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:32,930
Hello, Grandpa.

92
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:34,550
A woman called Wang Li

93
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,270
is here at our house.

94
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,130
She claims to be Qiao Mai's mother.

95
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:37,930
My name is Wang Li.

96
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:39,250
I'm Qiao Mai's mom.

97
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,130
Nice to meet you.

98
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:56,890
She has not come home

99
00:03:57,330 --> 00:03:59,010
for a long time.

100
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,730
She even took wedding pictures

101
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:02,770
without telling me.

102
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:04,690
Mister,

103
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:06,730
please talk to Mai.

104
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,050
What are you doing here?

105
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:09,930
My son-in-law.

106
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:11,010
You are back.

107
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:12,450
Where is Mai?

108
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:13,610
It has nothing to do with you.

109
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,130
I can't find her.

110
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,770
Please let Mai go home!

111
00:04:17,770 --> 00:04:19,070
The money she sent last time

112
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,470
is almost gone!

113
00:04:19,470 --> 00:04:20,230
Don't touch me!

114
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:20,870
Please ask Mai...

115
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,630
You were the one that kicked her out before!

116
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:23,390
As well as that son of yours,

117
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,430
Qiao Xiaoguang!

118
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,590
Birds of a feather!

119
00:04:26,270 --> 00:04:28,030
Don't you feel any remorse?

120
00:04:28,070 --> 00:04:29,110
I had no other options.

121
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,550
Please, let Mai go home with us!

122
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:31,150
Don't touch me!

123
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:32,630
That's enough!
