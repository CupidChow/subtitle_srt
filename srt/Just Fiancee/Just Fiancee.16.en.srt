00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:14,830
Chairman.

3
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:15,590
Take it off.

4
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:16,910
Alright.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,310
Are you ready?

6
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:22,790
Bring it on.

7
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:27,670
Chairman, try to remember

8
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,430
your time with Miss Gu.

9
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,230
How is it?

10
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:36,630
Fairly calm.

11
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:38,270
Chairman,

12
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:39,910
now try to imagine

13
00:00:39,910 --> 00:00:40,950
spending time with Miss Qiao.

14
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:02,710
Your heart is beating so fast!

15
00:01:03,310 --> 00:01:04,270
It's like a galloping horse!

16
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:07,030
Chairman,

17
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,230
I think your heart has the answer.

18
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:13,830
It's fine.

19
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:15,110
I'll go find Qiao Mai.

20
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,190
OK.

21
00:01:27,030 --> 00:01:28,030
Okay, I can go back on my own from here.

22
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,230
Are you really living here?

23
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:32,750
Yes.

24
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:34,310
I told you I'm not Gu Manman.

25
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,550
I bet you'll give up now.

26
00:01:36,470 --> 00:01:37,150
Qiao Mai,

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:39,830
will we still be friends?

28
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,950
Of course.

29
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:42,230
We are both

30
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:44,030
the guardians of the sea!

31
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:47,150
We are the guardians of the sea.

32
00:01:48,190 --> 00:01:49,230
Bro,

33
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:51,070
I hope you'd find Gu Manman soon!

34
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:54,190
I will try my best to find where Manman is.

35
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:55,630
By the way.

36
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:58,390
Though Su Yu and I

37
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,070
have been fighting for years over Gu Manman,

38
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:03,230
Su Yu made it clear from the beginning

39
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,550
that he had no feelings for her.

40
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,630
Manman was the one that liked him.

41
00:02:07,630 --> 00:02:09,230
He is sincere

42
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:10,950
and a pretty good guy.

43
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,110
What?

44
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:15,310
Are you his wingman now?

45
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:18,790
No matter if it's Manman or you,

46
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,270
I hope you can be happy.

47
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:23,030
Keep it up!

48
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,110
See you.

49
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:36,430
See you next time.

50
00:02:48,590 --> 00:02:49,430
Where is Mom?

51
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:50,910
She should be home soon.

52
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:52,590
I'll be in my room.

53
00:02:52,790 --> 00:02:53,270
Hold on.

54
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:54,590
What?

55
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,950
Be careful.

56
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:57,470
Be careful?

57
00:02:58,710 --> 00:02:59,830
You're acting weird.

58
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,790
What are you doing here?

59
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,470
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

60
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,510
This is my room!

61
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,510
Get out!

62
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:22,510
Is my heart racing?

63
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,630
Why are you acting so weird?

64
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,230
What do you want?

65
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,710
I like you.

66
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:35,670
Get out!

67
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,830
Why are you being like this?

68
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:41,430
What more do you want?

69
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:44,110
I want

70
00:03:44,110 --> 00:03:45,830
to be with you

71
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,950
forever and ever.

72
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:50,670
And I want to take you to watch the sunrise

73
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,990
and sunset by the sea, just like your dad did.

74
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,830
I want to bring you to all the nice places.

75
00:03:55,830 --> 00:03:56,670
And...

76
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:57,310
Enough.

77
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,430
Fine.

78
00:04:07,910 --> 00:04:09,390
Alright, let's sleep.

79
00:04:09,790 --> 00:04:11,710
No, Su Yu! This is my room!

80
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,910
Get out now!

81
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:13,710
Just...

82
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,870
I'm not leaving!

83
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,670
Get out!

84
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:18,670
Just get out!

85
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,510
You're not old enough for this!

86
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:27,990
Brother.

87
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,070
Let's go home.

88
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,590
You go first.

89
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,270
I want to stay a bit longer.

90
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,710
Brother.

91
00:04:34,710 --> 00:04:36,470
You can't force someone to like you.

92
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:46,710
But if you want to hang out,

93
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,470
I don't mind.
