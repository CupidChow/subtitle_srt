(Xiaolin Bay)
Mr. Su.

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:14,070
This is your guide for this trip.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,070
He will also be your chaperone.

5
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:17,400
(Xiaolin Bay project guide, Tan Ying)
The Hui style houses

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,950
you see here

7
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,070
are where we host tourists.

8
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:22,190
They are very unique.

9
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:24,270
The scenery here is impressive.

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:25,280
I bet many companies

11
00:00:25,280 --> 00:00:26,150
would want to invest here.

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:29,680
Previously there was a company

13
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:31,190
that wanted to invest in us.

14
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:32,630
And it is?

15
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:34,150
The Gu Family.

16
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:35,230
The Gu family?

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:36,870
But later on,

18
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:38,150
the Gu family had a liquidity crisis

19
00:00:38,150 --> 00:00:40,270
and the land prices shot up at that time,

20
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:41,390
so the negotiations fell through.

21
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:44,620
So many villagers invested

22
00:00:44,620 --> 00:00:45,430
all their money into this.

23
00:00:46,070 --> 00:00:46,420
In the end, they caused them

24
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:47,190
to lose everything.

25
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:48,140
The Gu family is a bunch of

26
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,910
fickle-minded fools.

27
00:00:49,470 --> 00:00:50,870
This is how they run businesses.

28
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,950
Looks like Mr. Su knows as much as me.

29
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:54,550
Luo Da,

30
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:57,310
tell the head of Jiayan Group

31
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,400
that Max is willing

32
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,110
to give him stock options

33
00:00:59,150 --> 00:00:59,800
as long as he puts in the effort

34
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:00,710
to develop this place

35
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,750
and protect the rights of the villagers.

36
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:02,870
Alright, Chairman.

37
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:04,350
Let's continue.

38
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:21,470
Get out!

39
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:22,910
You are not welcome here!

40
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,600
Members of the Gu family

41
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,000
are not welcomed here!

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,710
What is the meaning of this?

43
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:25,630
What's wrong?

44
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:26,400
Members of the Gu family

45
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:26,950
are not welcomed here!

46
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:28,270
I am not a member of the Gu family.

47
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:29,000
Members of the Gu family

48
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,830
are not welcomed here!

49
00:01:29,830 --> 00:01:30,430
Get out!

50
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:31,650
We don't want your investment!

51
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:34,590
Get out! Get lost!

52
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,590
Chairman, let's go.

53
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,590
We don't want your investment!

54
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,140
We don't want any investment

55
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,110
from the Gu family!

56
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:38,990
Get out!

57
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:46,350
He attacked him!

58
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:46,950
Stop them.

59
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:47,870
But don't hurt them.

60
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:51,710
They attacked us!

61
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,610
Mr. Su went there on the pretense of investing,

62
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,180
but used the opportunity

63
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,070
to attack the villagers

64
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,780
and force them to sell

65
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,330
their land to Max Group.

66
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:14,310
I wonder if a headline like this

67
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,750
would tickle your fancy,

68
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:18,870
Su Yu?

69
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:32,940
(Last night)
I spent a lot of time

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,550
investigating the matter

71
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:35,160
and also talked

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,630
to some members of the Gu family

73
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,910
to learn about the truth.

74
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:47,030
(Six months ago)

75
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,630
Have a seat.

76
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:49,910
(Former shareholder of Gu Group, Luo Wen)
Senior Su,

77
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,310
(Former shareholder of Gu Group, Chen San)
what are you doing here?

78
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,750
I invited both of you over today

79
00:02:54,030 --> 00:02:57,470
to talk about Gu Manman.

80
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:03,950
If it's related to Gu Manman,

81
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:05,190
we don't know much about it.

82
00:03:06,870 --> 00:03:09,390
You two have been cast out of the Gu family!

83
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,630
Why are you still holding back?

84
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,710
Chen.

85
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:14,750
You probably know this.

86
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,710
If Gu Tianlin finds out about this,

87
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:18,710
we will suffer the consequences.

88
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,390
Right?

89
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:20,030
Yeah.

90
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:28,270
Well...

91
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:30,110
Now you can tell me, right?

92
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:31,750
It's not like that, Senior Su.

93
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,080
Enough with the act.

94
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:35,920
You two were forced

95
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,070
to start your own business,

96
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,510
but you have been losing money.

97
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,680
The money there is enough

98
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,000
for you two to start a new company.

99
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,310
Fine.

100
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,380
We are close enough

101
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,850
to share all of the information.

102
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,150
Don't tell anyone else about this.

103
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,510
You mean...

104
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:09,950
Gu Manman was...
