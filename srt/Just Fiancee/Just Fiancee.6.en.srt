(Su Yu's Home)
Why did I do that?

3
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,430
It's so embarrassing.

4
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,550
Why are you so slow?

5
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,230
You think I'm a tortoise?

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:28,750
Faster!

7
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:30,070
Step on the gas!

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:31,590
Come on!

9
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:33,230
What's the matter, Grandpa?

10
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:35,390
Ask him!

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,790
Miss Gu, Senior Su wants to speed up.

12
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,190
Speed up?

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,420
Are you still thinking of

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:41,390
becoming a racer at your age?

15
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,630
It's too dangerous.

16
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,510
Danger is my middle name!

17
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,510
When I was young,

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,470
I was a cool guy.

19
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:50,750
I always drove fast.

20
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:52,910
Senior Su was a racer.

21
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,390
I didn't know you were that amazing!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,110
Do you still want to drive fast?

23
00:00:57,880 --> 00:00:58,550
Of course.

24
00:00:59,280 --> 00:00:59,870
Give me a moment.

25
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:14,710
Let's go!

(Caution Do not imitate)

31
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,830
Why didn't you do your job?

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,150
I told you to take good care of my grandpa!

33
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:36,310
Why did you listen to Manman?

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:37,670
Am I your boss or is she your boss?

35
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:42,990
Run after them!

36
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,230
Did you have a good time, Grandpa?

37
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:47,350
I had so much fun.

38
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,510
I'm glad to hear that.

39
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,470
Manman,

40
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,750
can you promise me one thing?

41
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,350
What is it?

42
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:58,430
Never disappear again in the future.

43
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,350
I know sometimes

44
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:04,990
Yu might get on your nerves.

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,430
Yu's parents

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,150
passed away when he was very young.

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:10,110
From then on,

48
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,710
I was all he had.

49
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:13,230
We depended on each other.

50
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,230
I always have this worry.

51
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,830
What will happen to him

52
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:21,270
when I pass away?

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,750
I'm glad you've come back.

54
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,190
With you by his side,

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,270
I can rest assured now.

56
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,790
I want the two of you

57
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:33,110
to live a happy life.

58
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:35,470
If you don't like Yu any longer in the future

59
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,590
and want to leave him,

60
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,070
I won't stand in your way.

61
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,270
So long as you are willing to stay here,

62
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,910
this place

63
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,230
will be your home.

64
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,070
Tonight,

65
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:48,590
Max will have a celebration.

66
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:49,470
You

67
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:51,150
should go with Yu.

68
00:02:51,910 --> 00:02:52,510
All right?

69
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,790
Good girl.

70
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:16,710
Shaoshao,

71
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,710
will you not be my girlfriend?

72
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,110
Who do you think you are?

73
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:22,510
Are you still in love with Su Yu?

74
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,630
He is already engaged.

75
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,470
After he got engaged to Gu Manman,

76
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,590
Gu Manman disappeared.

77
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,830
To me,

78
00:03:28,830 --> 00:03:30,070
that's good news.

79
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,270
As for you...

80
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,590
Don't block my view of Su Yu!

81
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,350
(Lin Shaoshao, the daughter
of the Lin Group's president)

82
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:41,310
Tonight,

83
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:44,270
I will win over Su Yu.

84
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,750
Yu,

85
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,580
it's been a while since we last met.

86
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,230
Aren't you going to say hello?

87
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,150
Don't you think you're treating

88
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,270
your childhood sweetheart too coldly?

89
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,270
I'll drink as punishment.

90
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,470
This is not enough.

91
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:01,630
I want you

92
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,390
to be with me tonight.

93
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:06,790
Stop it!

94
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:07,980
Gu Manman has gone missing

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:08,990
for such a long time.

96
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,510
Why won't you make me your girlfriend?

97
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,990
People are watching.

98
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:14,750
Come here!

99
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,550
Watching me?

100
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:19,910
Then I'll give them a show!

101
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,750
If you keep this up,

102
00:04:27,760 --> 00:04:29,070
I will not be kind!

103
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:33,390
If you want me to stop,

104
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,310
kiss me.
