Stop it!

Qiao Mai,

4
00:00:16,700 --> 00:00:17,360
will you really

5
00:00:17,360 --> 00:00:18,910
let them take your brother away?

6
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,570
Do something!

7
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:25,610
Mai!

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:26,730
I didn't mean it.

9
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,610
Stop it!

10
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,470
Did they bully you?

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,090
From now on,

12
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,430
except for me,

13
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:44,750
no one else can bully you.

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,730
Sir,

15
00:00:53,740 --> 00:00:55,090
we are just trying to get our money back.

16
00:00:55,100 --> 00:00:56,250
This woman owes us money.

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,210
I have no other choice.

18
00:00:58,180 --> 00:00:58,830
What do you want me to do?

19
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:00,370
According to the contract,

20
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:01,810
you have fulfilled all your promises.

21
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,530
I will take care of it myself.

22
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:03,970
OK.

23
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:04,830
I understand.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:07,860
This is a check

25
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:08,650
for five hundred thousand yuan.

26
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,850
Cash the check at Max.

27
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:10,600
You can keep the rest

28
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,010
for your medical expenses.

29
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,450
Thank you, Sir!

30
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,250
Hold it!

31
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,250
You should thank Miss Gu.

32
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,730
Thank you, Miss Gu.

33
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:21,550
Good girl!

34
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,770
Why did they call you Miss Gu?

35
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:23,610
Don't come any closer!

36
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:24,610
I don't want to see you.

37
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,100
I didn't pay the money back

38
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:26,090
for you for nothing.

39
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:27,450
I was wrong.

40
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:27,960
Why say something like that?

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,290
We're a family.

42
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,130
Is he your boyfriend?

43
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:31,930
I'm Wang Li.

44
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:32,950
Qiao Mai's mother.

45
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:33,610
Nice to meet you!

46
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,210
Guang, come here!

47
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:36,190
Greet

48
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:36,990
your brother-in-law!

49
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,470
Your sister has found a good man!

50
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,930
He has really done us a great favor!

51
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,570
Pah!

52
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,570
Mom, in my opinion,

53
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,050
she must be his mistress!

54
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,050
How could she be so capable?

55
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,610
Pal, watch your mouth!

56
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:47,890
What do you want me to do?

57
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,330
I will take care of it myself.

58
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:50,810
Got it!

59
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,550
What do you want?

60
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,670
Apologize to your sister.

61
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,250
Please, my son-in-law!

62
00:01:55,260 --> 00:01:56,290
Guang is still young.

63
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:57,210
Don't take his words seriously.

64
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,290
You should step aside!

65
00:01:58,300 --> 00:01:59,290
Don't forget that you pushed my wife just now!

66
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:01,690
Apologize!

67
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,130
Luo Da,

68
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,790
go get those men.

69
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:07,850
Ask them to take him away!

70
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,050
Get on your knees!

71
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:13,650
I'm sorry.

72
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:14,570
I can't hear you!

73
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:16,250
I'm sorry, Sister!

74
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:24,230
Let's go.

75
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:24,930
Where are we going?

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,990
Wherever you want.

77
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,770
One more cup!

78
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:39,690
Don't drink too much.

79
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:41,610
Leave me alone.

80
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,090
I'm unhappy.

81
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:47,530
Unhappy!

82
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:48,850
Very unhappy!

83
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,330
Why do they all bully me?

84
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,170
Don't worry.

85
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,690
From today on,

86
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:58,930
no one will bully you!

87
00:02:58,940 --> 00:03:00,090
You are kind to me

88
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:01,570
because

89
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,870
I look like Gu Manman.

90
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,330
Don't worry.

91
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,130
I will do my best to act like her.

92
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:08,890
Cheers!

93
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:10,870
Let's stop after this.

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,010
Hello?

95
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,930
Hello, Chairman.

96
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,690
The new designs are ready.

97
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,840
Why don't you come over

98
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,610
to have a look at them?

99
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,610
Are you there?

100
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,530
Okay.

101
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,370
What is all this?

102
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:34,800
Do you plan to fool the consumers

103
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,610
with this rubbish?

104
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,170
I'm sorry, Chairman.

105
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,370
Do you think saying sorry is...

106
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,570
I will give you two more days

107
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,530
to redo the designs!

108
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:45,170
Okay.

109
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,110
What's the matter?

110
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,010
I had a nightmare.

111
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,940
I dreamt about my mom

112
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:05,490
chasing me out the house.

113
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,570
It's all right, stop crying.

114
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:14,810
Su Yu,

115
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,730
you are the first man who is kind to me

116
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,010
besides my father.

117
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:20,970
I...
