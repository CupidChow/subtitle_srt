It's time to go to the company.

You're already awake, right?

5
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,110
Why do you keep looking at me?

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,620
I was thinking about

7
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:43,430
how to make it up to you.

8
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:44,990
How about

00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:46,310
going to the company with me?

and do nothing all day, right?

15
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,910
Maybe I

need to find a small job?

17
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,630
This is your job.

Then what can I help you with anything?

19
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:22,950
I'm going to another office.

Stay here.

What's wrong?

29
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,830
Do you still want to let it continue?

30
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,270
Since Grandpa's health is improving,

31
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,550
we surely will continue with the project.

aren't you worried that

34
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,190
it may be a trap left

35
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,230
by the real Miss Gu?

36
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,550
What do you mean?

And yet you want to

continue the project she developed.

I feel that something might go wrong.

I don't know if I should say this.

you have a lot to say today.

What is it?

49
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,790
How could it be so coincidental

50
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,350
that two unrelated people look so alike?

Chairman,

52
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,230
I think you should be careful.

I need to get something.

Nothing.

How could it be so coincidental...

Give it to me.

61
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,270
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:14,990
I dropped your pen.

That's alright.

You're acting so weird.

Attend the meeting with me.

(Max Group, Discussion on Xiaolin Bay Project)
I called everyone to this meeting

didn't we come to an agreement

to develop a tourism project there?

85
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,950
It is intended to stimulate the economy there

and improve the lives of the villagers.

Do you agree with what he said?

Does Miss Gu's opinion matter?

I have decided to cancel the project!

Those in favor, raise your hand.

97

Raise your hand.
