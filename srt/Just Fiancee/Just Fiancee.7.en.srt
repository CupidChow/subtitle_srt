00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,250
Miss Gu, would you like a glass of wine?

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,590
No, thanks.

4
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:31,910
Mr. Su, what do you think?

5
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:32,590
I'll think about it.

6
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,010
I'm leaving.

7
00:00:36,130 --> 00:00:36,890
No, you can't.

8
00:00:37,850 --> 00:00:38,890
I'm hungry.

9
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,310
Get something to eat.

10
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:54,730
Miss Gu.

11
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:56,530
Hello!

12
00:00:58,890 --> 00:00:59,610
Hello?

13
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:12,210
Qiao Mai, what are you doing here?

14
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:18,730
Miss Gu!

15
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,770
Do you know the waiter?

16
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,370
We're friends.

17
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:27,490
We are just friends.

18
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:28,650
Stop right there!

19
00:01:29,650 --> 00:01:30,490
What is it?

20
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:31,970
You are not Gu Manman!

21
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:34,130
Do you have any evidence?

22
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:34,870
I'm Gu Manman.

23
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,870
Do you need evidence to show

24
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:37,930
who you are?

25
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:39,770
The fact that you said that

26
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:42,330
makes me even more suspicious.

27
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:44,170
Su Yu brought home a fake Gu Manman.

28
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,770
Others might be fooled,

29
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:47,370
but not me.

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:49,050
I guess you don't know.

31
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:50,190
But in the past,

32
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:51,050
Gu Manman

33
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,490
would not act like this.

34
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:53,990
Let me see what the waiter

35
00:01:53,990 --> 00:01:55,110
has put in your bag!

36
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:56,070
They are my belongings!

37
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:01,770
I'm sorry.

38
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:03,330
How dare you slap me?

39
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,170
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:05,890
Lin Shaoshao!

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,770
You really crossed the line this time.

42
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:09,570
Let's go.

43
00:02:11,310 --> 00:02:12,330
I crossed the line?

44
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:14,090
She slapped me!

45
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,410
(Lin Duoduo, young master of the Lin Group)

46
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,490
Brother, someone has slapped me!

47
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,850
I have arrived.

48
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:27,050
Let me see

49
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,410
who was bold enough

50
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,390
to slap my sister!

51
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,290
How could she slap me!

52
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,090
Gu Manman!

53
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:36,250
I will get my revenge sooner or later!

54
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:44,450
Who slapped my sister?

55
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,970
Gu Manman slapped me!

56
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:48,250
What? Gu...

57
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:49,490
Manman?

58
00:02:59,450 --> 00:03:00,010
Brother!

59
00:03:01,730 --> 00:03:02,610
Tell me!

60
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:04,130
Where did Manman go?

61
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:06,210
You don't care about me at all!

62
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,330
Have I not warned you about her?

63
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:09,970
Even I got slapped by her numerous times!

64
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:12,170
Tell me where Manman is?

65
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,610
She left a while ago!

66
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,450
However,

67
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:19,450
she has been away for such a long time.

68
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:20,650
Where was she during that time?

69
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,270
Why has she come back all of a sudden?

70
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:24,530
I find it strange, too.

71
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,130
Manman!

72
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,050
(Lin Duoduo, Gu Manman)
Don't marry Su Yu.

73
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:27,850
I don't know what you see in him!

74
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,470
You brought me out here

75
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:30,490
just to talk about this?

76
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,770
This is your marriage we're talking about!

77
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:33,890
It's none of your business!

78
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:35,090
Stay away from me!

79
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:40,920
Su Yu has also changed

80
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,170
his attitude towards her.

81
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,410
I don't care! Even if she's back,

82
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,130
I will take Su Yu

83
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,170
from her!

84
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:49,090
I think I know where the real Gu Manman is.

85
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,050
Who are you?

86
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:53,910
I hired a private investigator

87
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,450
and obtained two pictures of Gu Manman here.

88
00:03:55,450 --> 00:03:56,190
Do you know her?

89
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:56,670
No, we don't.

90
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,550
The two of you are lying!

91
00:04:04,270 --> 00:04:05,990
This is Qiao Mai.

92
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,950
And this is Gu Manman.

93
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:09,830
Why did Gu Manman

94
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,910
draw freckles on her face

95
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,510
and pretend to be someone else?

96
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:15,230
Aren't freckles hereditary?

97
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,930
Oh, she is Gu Manman!

98
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:21,910
How about this?

99
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,590
I can give you a lot of money

100
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,470
if you can get her to meet me somewhere.
