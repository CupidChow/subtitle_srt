00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:15,690
I don't care!

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,130
That lipstick was a gift from you.

4
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,210
We have to get it back.

5
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:18,690
Qiao Mai!

6
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:19,770
Come here!

7
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,130
I lost one of my lipsticks.

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:27,970
Did you take it?

9
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:29,370
No, I didn't.

10
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:30,540
I've been working here for months

11
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:31,530
and nothing like this has ever happened.

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,210
But my things went missing after you came!

13
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:34,210
Who else could it be other than you?

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,570
I'm not even going to argue with you.

15
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:35,930
Stop right there!

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:37,610
Qiao Mai,

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,050
just show her your bag.

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,210
Why do you suspect it's me?

19
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:42,450
Just because she said so?

20
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:43,160
Why are you meddling with

21
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:43,890
my personal belongings?

22
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,650
What are you doing?

23
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:45,370
All of you, don't move!

24
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:47,450
Give the bag to me!

25
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:51,390
What are you hiding from us?

26
00:00:51,470 --> 00:00:53,470
Let's see what's inside the bag!

27
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:00,970
How could you meddle with my things?

28
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,730
(Mr. Wang, manager of Max's Canteen)
Is that Lulu's lipstick?

29
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:08,330
Call the police!

30
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:09,730
It's unnecessary to call the police.

31
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:11,170
It's just a lipstick.

32
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,290
Just fire her.

33
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:12,850
Mai,

34
00:01:13,220 --> 00:01:14,570
why don't you just resign?

35
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:18,170
Pack up your things

36
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,110
and leave!

37
00:01:20,260 --> 00:01:22,250
I'd like to see who would make her leave!

38
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:28,450
Chairman!

39
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:56,010
You really look like her.

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,030
Like who?

41
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,190
My fiancée.

42
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:05,350
What happened here?

43
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:07,470
They wanted to frame Qiao Mai as the thief!

44
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:08,310
I saw everything!

45
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:08,580
Lulu put the lipstick

46
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,350
into Qiao Mai's bag by herself.

47
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,270
How ridiculous!

48
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,150
If we

49
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,790
find out that you people are lying,

50
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:14,710
all of you

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,190
will be fired!

52
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,590
How dare you lie to us

53
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,310
and try to frame her!

54
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,670
I'm sorry, Chairman!

55
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,550
I will deal with her right away!

56
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:25,190
Wang Hao, what are you doing?

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:25,600
You misled everyone

58
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,630
by saying that Qiao Mai was the thief!

59
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,630
This is what you get in return!

60
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:28,730
What are you doing?

61
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:29,830
I think we should just forget it.

62
00:02:32,860 --> 00:02:33,730
Then come with me.

63
00:02:34,130 --> 00:02:38,030
(Max Group)

64
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,750
What do you want from me?

65
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,090
I want you to be my fiancée.

66
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:53,730
I am not interested in you.

67
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,110
However,

68
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,290
you look exactly like my fiancée.

69
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,090
Read it.

70
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:05,510
You can look at it as a job.

71
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:06,790
The duration of the contract is one month.

72
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,170
During that time,

73
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,430
you will be my fiancée.

74
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,600
So that my grandpa

75
00:03:10,610 --> 00:03:11,610
can have his operation in peace.

76
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:12,950
After one month,

77
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:14,050
the contract will be terminated automatically.

78
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,090
As long as you can complete the job,

79
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,030
I will satisfy all of your requests.

80
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:20,670
No!

81
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,270
This is ridiculous!

82
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:23,730
Wait!

83
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,990
It's just a job.

84
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,750
After one month,

85
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,830
you will be free!

86
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,350
No!

87
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:32,530
I can't accept it.

88
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,030
This is your only chance!

89
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,710
No, I don't want it!

90
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,390
Do you want me to go after her?

91
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:42,530
What do you think?

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,270
I understand. This is her only chance!

93
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:47,790
This is your only chance!

94
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:48,990
Follow her!

95
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,550
Yes, sir!

96
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:51,010
Don't come back without her!

97
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,510
Mai, you are back!

98
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:00,790
I'm hungry.

99
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,190
Go make me something to eat.

100
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,330
Mom, I will cook later.

101
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,410
I want to ask you something.

102
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,290
What's wrong?

103
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,690
Well...

104
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,850
When you and Dad

105
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,450
adopted me,

106
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,170
was I alone?

107
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,970
Was your dad adopting you not enough?

108
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:22,930
You want him to adopt two?

109
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,570
Did I have a sister?

110
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,090
Go make food!

111
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:28,690
Hello?

112
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,250
You finally called!

113
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:33,410
What futures should we buy tomorrow?

114
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:35,570
OK!
