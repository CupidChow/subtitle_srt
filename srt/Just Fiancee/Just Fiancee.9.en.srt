2
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,950
You are nothing like Gu Manman!

3
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:17,590
He will notice it at first sight!

4
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:21,950
I knew it!

5
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,870
I am nothing to you all.

6
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:28,070
Don't be mad.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:34,790
What are you thinking about?

8
00:00:35,030 --> 00:00:36,190
My father.

9
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,270
Though he is only my adoptive father,

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,510
he loved me very much.

11
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:43,270
When I was little and I got sick,

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:44,510
he would carry me on his back

13
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,060
and walked dozens of kilometers

14
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:47,030
to the town to see a doctor.

15
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:48,830
But

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,270
I can't be with him anymore.

17
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:54,910
The only one person in this world

18
00:00:54,990 --> 00:00:56,910
that loved me

19
00:00:58,190 --> 00:00:59,350
has left me.

20
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:04,110
Don't worry.

21
00:01:04,790 --> 00:01:05,470
You have me.

22
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:07,170
No matter what problems you face,

23
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,190
I will help you deal with them.

24
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,230
I'm hungry now.

25
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:12,900
I will ask Aunt Zhang

26
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:15,310
to cook noodles for you.

27
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:18,150
When I was little,

28
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:20,350
my dad would make egg noodles for me.

29
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:25,830
Then I will ask Aunt Zhang to add an egg, too?

30
00:01:26,590 --> 00:01:27,590
You,

31
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,030
all you know is how to yell at others!

32
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,430
What is it?

33
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:08,430
How many eggs are left?

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,470
It's because the eggs are of poor quality.

35
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:13,100
I'll ask Aunt Zhang to buy

36
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:14,830
some good ones tomorrow.

37
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:17,030
Then will I be able to have

38
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:19,090
egg noodles tonight?

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,510
Of course! I will crack another egg for you.

40
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:21,870
Give it here.

41
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,110
Let me teach you how to crack an egg!

42
00:02:26,030 --> 00:02:28,350
Up next, I will show you

43
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:30,510
my family's traditional method

44
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:32,190
of cracking an egg.

45
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:39,070
Who was the one

46
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,490
that said she would teach me?

47
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:45,630
People make mistakes.

48
00:02:46,710 --> 00:02:47,670
Are you aware that

49
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:48,310
mistakes

50
00:02:49,550 --> 00:02:50,990
lead to punishment?

51
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,050
Who is it?

52
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:01,850
Get out of my way.

53
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:03,330
Why are you people in my house?

54
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:10,690
Who are you?

55
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:11,410
Get out!

56
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,970
Why are you at my home?

57
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:16,170
If you don't get out, I will call the police!

58
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,130
I'll call the police for you.

59
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:18,330
Don't do that.

60
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,050
The girl is drunk.

61
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:21,670
Let's find out what's going on first.

62
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:25,110
Miss,

63
00:03:25,110 --> 00:03:25,810
are you OK?

64
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,210
Why did you come to our home?

65
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,770
Miss Gu?

66
00:03:30,130 --> 00:03:30,710
What did you say?

67
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,010
Excuse me.

68
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:34,290
I drank too much and got lost.

69
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,490
I'll leave now.

70
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:40,230
Hello?

71
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:40,950
Mr. Gu.

72
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:42,290
I saw Miss Gu just now.

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:43,170
What?

74
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:43,730
Good job!

75
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:44,510
Come back first.

76
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,070
OK.

77
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:49,410
Oh yeah, Qiao Mai.

78
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:50,720
Something doesn't feel right

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,090
about that woman.

80
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:53,270
I have never seen her

81
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,370
around this area before.

82
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,020
You've been saying that

83
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,730
for more than an hour.

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:57,970
It's so boring.

85
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:58,810
I'm serious.

86
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,010
I really think something is wrong.

87
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,730
Don't you think so too?

88
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:04,930
Qiao Mai!

89
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:08,170
Aren't you gonna finish your food?

90
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,410
I feel sleepy.

91
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,910
Let's go upstairs, all right?

92
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:14,150
You'll catch a cold sleeping here.

93
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:17,070
I just want to take a nap.
