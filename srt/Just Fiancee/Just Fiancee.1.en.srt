(Max Group)
The largest tourism group in the city,

00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:04,350
Max,

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:05,270
is going to announce the engagement of

4
00:00:05,270 --> 00:00:07,070
Su Yu, its chairman,

5
00:00:07,070 --> 00:00:08,670
with Gu Manman,
the daughter of Gu Group's founder,

6
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:10,110
tonight.

7
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:10,990
Miss Gu!

8
00:00:11,350 --> 00:00:12,230
Miss Gu!

9
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:13,270
Look this way please! Miss Gu!

10
00:00:13,270 --> 00:00:13,910
This way!

11
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:14,590
(Su Yu, Chairman of Max Business Group)

12
00:00:14,590 --> 00:00:15,950
Mr. Su, why don't you look this way?

13
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:16,950
(Gu Manman,
the daughter of Gu Group's founder)

14
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,390
Look over here!

15
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,670
Miss Gu, look this way!

16
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:21,710
Both our families

17
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:23,030
agreed on this matter 20 years ago.

18
00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:25,070
Do you think your unhappy look
would change things?

19
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:26,590
Whatever floats your boat.

20
00:00:26,590 --> 00:00:27,470
Here comes Senior Su!

21
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:28,310
Out of the way please!

22
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:31,070
The Gu family

23
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,470
has helped us, the Su family.

24
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,830
And Manman

25
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,270
has always liked Yu.

26
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:37,910
That is why I decided

27
00:00:37,910 --> 00:00:40,470
to have Yu marry Manman.

28
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,190
This is also to fulfill the promise
I made to my old friend.

29
00:00:45,830 --> 00:00:47,910
Su Yu, why are you so reluctant to marry me?

30
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:49,150
I know very well

31
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:50,430
what you are thinking

32
00:00:50,710 --> 00:00:51,670
and what you want to do.

33
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,070
What you really want isn't me.

34
00:00:54,070 --> 00:00:55,550
You just want
the business secrets of the Su family.

35
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:56,310
Nonsense.

36
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,990
This thing doesn't belong to us.

37
00:01:00,950 --> 00:01:01,910
Don't go too far!

38
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,710
(Gu Manman mysteriously disappeared)
Max Group recently announced

39
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,590
(after Su Yu broke off the engagement)
that the wedding date of Su Yu and Gu Manman

40
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:14,590
(Five months after Gu Manman disappeared)
would be postponed indefinitely

41
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:16,390
for unknown reasons.

42
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:18,030
(Su Yu's home)
Sir, in the last six months,

43
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:19,510
your illness has become worse.

44
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,750
The chairman is worried about you.

45
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:21,470
Grandpa,

46
00:01:21,470 --> 00:01:22,470
the operation can't be delayed any longer.

47
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:25,030
Bring Gu Manman back!

48
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:26,950
Otherwise, I won't promise you anything!

49
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:29,190
Grandpa!

50
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:29,950
Go away!

51
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:39,750
If I suddenly left,

52
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,030
would you come find me?

53
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:44,630
(It's as if)

How are you not able
to make your own food at your age?

62
00:02:15,470 --> 00:02:16,550
Don't you have hands?

That's mine!

00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:20,590
I want to have two!

65
00:02:22,550 --> 00:02:23,950
Why can't you give your share
to your younger brother?

66
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,430
He is going through
a growth spurt and needs nutrition.

67
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:27,470
Just go out and buy some later.

It's time for work.

Why did you do that?

You think everyone likes you?

Get out of my face!

Because my boyfriend is the manager here.

Qiao Mai, what's the matter with you?

How could a new comer like you
argue with a long-time employee?

91

But she was the one that...

No.

we have searched all the possible places

that Miss Gu would go.

What's the matter, Chairman?

Gu Manman.

Gu Manman?

115

I think you've got the wrong person.

This thing doesn't belong to us.
