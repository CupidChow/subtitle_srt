2
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,450
Su Yu!

3
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:30,750
Su Yu, are you alright?

4
00:00:31,820 --> 00:00:32,750
Mai.

5
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:36,160
Do you want both your daughters

6
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,130
to die because of you?

7
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:55,530
Everything is alright now.

8
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,530
Let's never be apart.

9
00:00:59,540 --> 00:01:01,170
Ever.

10
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,650
Earlier today,

11
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,410
Gu Tianlin, the chairman of Gu Group,

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:09,490
has been sentenced to prison for crimes...

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,210
I wonder how Grandpa is doing.

14
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:13,970
He'll be fine.

15
00:01:13,980 --> 00:01:15,370
The operation went well this time.

16
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:17,090
Where is Grandpa?

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:23,130
Where is my grandpa?

18
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,410
Senior Su has left us.

19
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,410
What?

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,010
Didn't the operation go well?

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,210
Yeah.

22
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,490
The operation went well.

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,410
I can walk now.

24
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,450
Grandpa!

25
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:41,690
Allow me.

26
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:42,330
You can take a rest.

27
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,530
Grandpa,

28
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:44,650
you just had your surgery.

29
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,130
How can you be so naughty?

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,090
Grandpa,

31
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:48,620
the doctor said that

32
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:50,010
you should rest in bed for a few months

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:50,890
before you're allowed to be discharged.

34
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:54,330
I almost died a few times,

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,530
but I'm still here alive and kicking.

36
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,130
I suppose

37
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,930
this old man

38
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:01,250
still has enough time

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,210
to witness you two getting married.

40
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:08,250
I don't plan on marrying him.

41
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,250
What do you mean?

42
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,210
Mai,

43
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,250
what do you mean?

44
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:17,250
He hasn't proposed to me.

45
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:20,850
You little brat!

46
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,430
Did you hear that?

47
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:24,370
And you need Mai to remind you?

48
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:25,970
You little brat!

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,530
Grandpa,

50
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:28,530
don't worry.

51
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:30,210
I've already prepared the proposing present.

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,970
What?

53
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:37,930
It was badly damaged,

54
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,770
but you managed to fix it.

55
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:40,810
Of course.

56
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:42,450
It took me a lot of time.

57
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,390
Don't mind me.

58
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:05,210
So many things have happened.

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,490
I wonder if my late sister

60
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,330
would give us her blessing.

61
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:19,130
Older sister.

62
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:20,330
Little sister.

63
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,370
Su Yu is a good man.

64
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,810
Make sure you cherish him.

65
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:26,330
Will you blame me?

66
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:27,970
Silly girl.

67
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,250
You cannot force a relationship.

68
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:31,570
Both of us went through

69
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:33,090
so much when we were young.

70
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:33,730
Now,

71
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,570
you have finally found happiness.

72
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:37,650
And so I am relieved.

73
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,260
Some people reminisce about

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,010
their childhood
to deal with their dreadful life,

75
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,660
while some use a whole lifetime

76
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:45,330
to heal their childhood wounds.

77
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:47,330
Most broken families

78
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:49,010
will cause a lifetime of pain for the kids.

79
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:51,530
I wish you the best

80
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,850
and I'm glad you've found happiness.

81
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:55,210
Live a happy life with Su Yu.

82
00:03:55,820 --> 00:03:56,570
I will.

83
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,650
Rest assured, Sister.

84
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:11,010
Su Yu and I will definitely

85
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,330
live a happy life together.

86
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,570
Qiao Mai,

87
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:18,370
I promise you,

88
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,090
I will protect you like a family member

89
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,970
and I will never leave you.

90
00:04:22,980 --> 00:04:23,930
Do you accept me?

91
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:25,810
I do.

92
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,690
(The end)
