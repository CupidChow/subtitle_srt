2
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,630
You mean...

3
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,310
Gu Manman...

4
00:00:22,360 --> 00:00:23,390
Killed herself?

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:28,510
After she took

6
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,990
Max's blueprint for the Xiaolin Bay project,

7
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,990
she gave it to her father

8
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,150
and went missing.

9
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,750
And I also heard

10
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:39,030
that her father is in Xiaolin Bay.

11
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:40,390
What?

12
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,310
If he thinks that Gu Manman's death

13
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:44,870
has something to do with Su Yu,

14
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:45,430
then...

15
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,550
Su Yu would be in danger!

16
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,910
Let's call the police, Grandpa!

17
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:53,190
But I don't have any concrete evidence.

18
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,510
No.

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,110
I'm going there.

20
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:57,590
Don't!

21
00:00:58,240 --> 00:00:58,990
Grandpa!

22
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:00,020
You will only make things

23
00:01:00,020 --> 00:01:01,030
more complicated if you go there.

24
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,190
Luo Da is with him.

25
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,790
So far he hasn't reported anything,

26
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,430
which means they should be fine.

27
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,790
(No, I still think something will go wrong.)

28
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,950
(Su Yu, I'm worried about you.)

29
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:21,870
(If I told you about it,)

30
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,390
(you would have
definitely told me not to come.)

31
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,230
(That is why I've decided to come on my own.)

32
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:26,750
Mr. Gu,

33
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,150
our men have picked up Miss Qiao.

34
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,790
Good, ask them to bring Qiao Mai over.

35
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:32,390
You keep an eye on Su Yu.

36
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,110
Don't let him get away.

37
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:33,830
Alright, Mr. Gu.

38
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,670
Where is Su Yu?

39
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,470
Qiao Mai.

40
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:41,550
That's me.

41
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:43,350
Your step-parents

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,070
are Wang Li

43
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,950
and Qiao Ze.

44
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,230
How did you find out about this?

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,110
Who are you?

46
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:54,910
I'm your father,

47
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,550
as well as Gu Manman's father.

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,150
You and Manman are twins.

49
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:08,510
We were poor back then

50
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,950
and we couldn't
afford to raise the both of you,

51
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:13,190
so your mother sent you away

52
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,670
and kept your elder sister with us.

53
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,670
This is my biggest regret in life.

54
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:22,190
My father

55
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,670
is Qiao Ze.

56
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,030
Who do you think you are?

57
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,190
Where did you take Su Yu?

58
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:28,990
Tell me now!

59
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,750
Mr. Su Yu, the chairman of Max Group,

60
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:32,600
went to Xiaolin Bay on the pretense

61
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,630
of investing and surveying,

62
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,070
and violently beat up the local villagers,

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:37,110
forcing them to sell their land to Max Group.

64
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,790
The investigation of the matter is ongoing.

65
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:48,630
Luo Da,

66
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,630
what is this all about?

67
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:51,510
Chairman,

68
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,470
your reputation in the company

69
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,510
has been tarnished.

70
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,070
Because you attacked the villagers,

71
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,560
the company's stock prices

72
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,670
have hit rock bottom.

73
00:02:58,480 --> 00:02:59,630
I see.

74
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,910
We shouldn't stay in Xiaolin Bay any longer.

75
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:01,830
Let's go back.

76
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,910
Hold it!

77
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,310
Chairman,

78
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,150
you won't be able to leave now.

79
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:07,950
Mr. Gu

80
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:08,590
wants to see you.

81
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,630
Her disappearance

82
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:12,000
has something to do

83
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
with her father, Gu Tianlin.
