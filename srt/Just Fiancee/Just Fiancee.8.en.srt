2
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:15,710
My goodness!

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,270
I didn't think I would slap her.

4
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:28,630
What are you doing?

5
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:31,790
Which hand did you slap her with?

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:33,150
This one.

7
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:35,990
I'm sorry.

8
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,830
I shouldn't have

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:37,790
left you alone.

10
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:39,710
It's OK.

11
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,310
I know you were busy.

12
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:41,990
I understand.

13
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,870
There's nothing between Lin Shaoshao and I.

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:46,190
The relationship between you and Lin Shaoshao

15
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:46,990
is none of my business.

16
00:00:47,470 --> 00:00:48,510
Does my relationship with her

17
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:50,110
have nothing to do with you?

18
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:52,150
How does your relationship with her

19
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,190
have anything to do with me?

20
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:54,910
Qiao Mai, aren't you...

21
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:57,590
jealous?

22
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,110
Not really.

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,470
Su Yu.

24
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:06,910
Su Yu!

25
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:08,030
What?

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:08,910
Come closer.

27
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:11,230
I know she is only

28
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,510
your friend.

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,070
And I'm

30
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,350
your fiancée.

31
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:20,990
Unfortunately, I'm a fake!

32
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:24,110
You're real for me!

33
00:01:51,750 --> 00:01:53,350
(Mom)

34
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,070
Hello?

35
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,510
Hello?

36
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,430
Mai!

37
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,830
A man named Lin Duoduo

38
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:04,950
came to our home just now

39
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:05,790
with a picture of another girl

40
00:02:05,800 --> 00:02:06,550
who looks just like you!

41
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,790
Did you tell him anything about me?

42
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,550
Of course not!

43
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,030
I kept my lips sealed!

44
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:10,950
That's good.

45
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,430
What happened?

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,110
A man named Lin Duoduo

47
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:15,110
came to my home just now

48
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,190
with Gu Manman's picture.

49
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,150
What?

50
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,630
(Qiao Mai's home)
Mom, where did that man go?

51
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,510
(Qiao Mai's home)
He already left.

52
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,030
He left two photos on the table.

53
00:02:24,630 --> 00:02:25,710
What's going on?

54
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,240
How did Lin Duoduo

55
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,150
manage to locate your home?

56
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:32,950
I don't know.

57
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,430
I have a feeling

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,950
Grandpa might find out sooner or later.

59
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,950
Maybe we should tell him now.

60
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:38,590
No.

61
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,030
I told you.

62
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,390
Grandpa hasn't had his operation yet.

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,830
We have to continue the lie.

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,670
But now

65
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,030
so many people know about this.

66
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,470
They even managed to find my home!

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,670
Why don't we tell Grandpa ourselves?

68
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,270
Are you sure about that?

69
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,070
Look at you two lovebirds!

70
00:02:58,910 --> 00:02:59,990
Why are you two so happy?

71
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:01,070
Share it with Grandpa!

72
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:02,790
You tell him.

73
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:04,350
Tell me already!

74
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:04,990
You tell him.

75
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,790
Come on!

76
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,150
You should tell him.

77
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:09,550
Grandpa!

78
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:12,470
If someone lied to you,

79
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,310
what would you do?

80
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:15,630
I hate

81
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:17,310
dishonest people the most!

82
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:18,510
Those who lie to me

83
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,790
will never be forgiven!

84
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:22,670
But,

85
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,310
Manman,

86
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,830
I'm sure you are an honest girl.

87
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,350
I never lie!

88
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:26,230
And I believe Yu won't lie to me.

89
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,110
No, I won't.

90
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,550
I'm an honest man.

91
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,750
Grandpa,

92
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,790
we need to take care of something.

93
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,950
We'll go to our room.

94
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,110
You should rest early!

95
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,510
You should rest early!

96
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:51,630
How did Lin Duoduo find your home?

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:52,870
What if Grandpa

98
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,710
found out about it?

99
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,910
Maybe I should talk to Lin Duoduo?

100
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,790
No, Lin Duoduo

101
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,550
doesn't care

102
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,750
whether you are Qiao Mai or Gu Manman

103
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,670
since you two look exactly the same.

104
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,230
Don't worry.

105
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,750
I will act just like Gu Manman.

106
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,790
No, I won't allow it.

107
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:14,550
Why?

108
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:15,800
Lin Duoduo likes Gu Manman

109
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,510
for her beautiful face.

110
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,510
But I like you.

111
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,190
I don't want you to meet him.

112
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:21,070
But...

113
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:21,870
No buts.

114
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:23,830
Come on,

115
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,230
he has found my home!

116
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,030
Trust me!

117
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,110
I will act just like her.

118
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,710
No!

119
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,110
You are nothing like Gu Manman!

120
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,750
He will notice it at first sight!

121
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:35,870
What's wrong?

122
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:36,910
I knew it!

123
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,030
I am nothing to you all.
