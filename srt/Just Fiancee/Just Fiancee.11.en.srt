(Max Group)

3
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,110
Ms. Gu is here.

4
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:16,850
Ms. Gu.

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:19,150
We can't stop this project.

6
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,670
It'd make our company

7
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:22,090
look bad

8
00:00:22,310 --> 00:00:23,310
and we'd not be able to answer

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,510
to those villagers.

10
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:26,910
What do you mean by that?

11
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:29,350
Don't you know?

12
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,530
Do tell.

13
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:33,700
You said in the past that

14
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:35,050
Xiaolin Bay was your hometown.

15
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:36,590
It is surrounded by rivers

16
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,290
and the villagers are

17
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:39,430
cut off from the outside world.

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:41,050
It was your suggestion to develop that place

19
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,150
into a tourist attraction.

20
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:43,250
Ms. Gu,

21
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,950
you agreed to the project in the past.

22
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,650
How come...

23
00:00:48,910 --> 00:00:49,510
Zhong, Zhou!

24
00:00:49,630 --> 00:00:50,290
Enough.

25
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:51,530
What has already been decided

26
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:52,530
will not change.

27
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:55,070
What's with that attitude, Zhong?

28
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,690
Don't cross the line!

29
00:00:58,790 --> 00:00:59,830
Look here, Zhong!

30
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,590
If you behave like this one more time,

31
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,150
I'll...

32
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:01,870
Enough.

33
00:01:02,230 --> 00:01:03,150
Why did you decide to stop the project?

34
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:05,060
I don't want to get involved

35
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,230
in Gu Manman's projects.

36
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:07,130
But

37
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:08,590
the villagers did nothing wrong.

38
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,710
Gu Manman once

39
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:11,030
stole company files.

40
00:01:11,890 --> 00:01:12,860
Who knows whether the project

41
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,570
would be a trap?

42
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,030
I'm a businessman.

43
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:15,990
I have to look at the big picture.

44
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:16,770
But...

45
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:17,530
No buts.

46
00:01:17,830 --> 00:01:19,470
I don't change my mind easily.

47
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,170
Hello?

48
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:22,670
Mom.

49
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,630
What's wrong?

50
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,790
A friend of yours came looking for you.

51
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:26,370
He asked you to meet him by the beach.

52
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,050
A friend?

53
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,610
I don't think I have any friends.

54
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:29,950
It's the guy from last time.

55
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:31,050
Lin Duoduo.

56
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:31,730
Alright.

57
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,310
I got it.

58
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:34,870
Erm, Su Yu...

59
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:35,730
That's enough from you.

60
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:38,430
Fine.

61
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:39,350
I'll deal with it on my own.

62
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:40,150
I'm leaving.

63
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:57,810
Hey.

64
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:03,410
Long time no see.

65
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,190
Who are you?

66
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:12,110
Good one, Gu Manman.

67
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:13,630
How dare you pretend to not know me?

68
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:18,270
What's your name?

69
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:20,230
Gu Manman!

70
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:21,910
Do you know what happened here by the beach?

71
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,070
Here?

72
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,510

73

(Gu Manman)

74
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,490
Let's play together.

75
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:36,670
I don't play with childish people.

76
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:43,010
Got it?

77
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,370
I don't remember.

78
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,950
I, Lin Duoduo, have been trying
to win your heart for years

79
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:53,130
and you are saying you don't know me?

80
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,200
I looked for you for months

81
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:54,930
after you went missing,

82
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,250
but now you are saying you don't know me?

83
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,270
Duoduo.

84
00:02:58,610 --> 00:02:59,690
I have some memories of you.

85
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:01,010
Then do you remember

86
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,230
what happened between us?

87
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:10,350
My head is killing me.

88
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,990
I can't remember anything.

89
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:14,150
Manman.

90
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:15,470
Manman.

91
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,260
Something traumatic

92
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:17,830
must have happened

93
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:18,630
for you to lose your memory.

94
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:19,490
Don't worry.

95
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,470
I'll help you remember it all.

96
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,090
Do you remember this ring?

97
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,550
A wedding ring?

98
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,290
Did you propose to me?

99
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:29,850
Yes.

100
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,510
Then did I

101
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:32,810
say yes?

102
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:33,890
No.

103
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,290
You took this ring

104
00:03:35,490 --> 00:03:36,610
and proposed to Su Yu.

105
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,090
What?

106
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:44,410
Marry her!

107
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:46,590
I'm running out of patience.

108
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:48,330
Do you want to be with me or not?

109
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:49,270
Su Yu.

110
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,150
We can never be together.

111
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:54,610
You are mine.

112
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,490
That is what happened.

113
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,770
That sounds ridiculous.

114
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,970
Then why do you still like her...

115
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,930
I mean me?
