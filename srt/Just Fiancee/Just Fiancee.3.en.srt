00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:20,990
Miss Qiao!

3
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,070
You finally came!

4
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:27,310
How long have you been waiting here?

5
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,830
I've been waiting for you all day.

6
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:29,910
Have this.

7
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,830
Don't waste your time.

8
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,070
Go home and get some rest.

9
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:39,460
Didn't you go out to buy food?

10
00:00:39,650 --> 00:00:40,960
Where's the dinner for your brother?

11
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:42,150
I'll order delivery for you.

12
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,350
Deliveries are so unhealthy.

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:45,010
What?

14
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,010
Are you not going to cook today again?

15
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:48,190
Hurry up! Your brother is still hungry!

16
00:00:48,190 --> 00:00:49,110
He is an adult.

17
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:50,270
Why doesn't he cook for himself?

18
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:51,110
What's wrong with not knowing how to cook?

19
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,030
Precisely!

20
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:54,390
I'm going to my room.

21
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:55,620
Wait. Wait.

22
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:56,830
Don't you need to go to work today?

23
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,250
I resigned.

24
00:00:57,770 --> 00:00:58,510
What's wrong with you?

25
00:00:58,910 --> 00:00:59,340
How are you going to pay

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:00,310
for your brother's tuition
if you're not working?

27
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,710
And how are you going to support me?

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:02,790
After your dad adopted you,

29
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:04,030
we spent a lot of money on raising you.

30
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:05,660
Enough.

31
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,520
You...

32
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:07,570
I'm warning you!

33
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,650
You should go out and earn money!

34
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:09,750
Your dad...

35
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,090
How could you be like this?

36
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:12,030
You are so ungrateful!

37
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:17,410
Dad,

38
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:19,190
I miss you!

39
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:22,030
Mai, we are by the sea now.

40
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:22,790
Stop crying.

41
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:24,990
Dad will work hard to make money.

42
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:28,230
Let's live over there in the future, okay?

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:30,980
Once upon a time, there was

44
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:32,770
a little princess that got bullied a lot.

45
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:34,750
Whenever she got unhappy,

46
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:37,710
she would go to the beach and yell out,

47
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:39,230
"Are there any dolphins?"

48
00:01:44,300 --> 00:01:45,630
Wang Li! Pay us our money!

49
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:46,490
Come down!

50
00:01:46,850 --> 00:01:47,770
It has been such a long time!

51
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,530
Pay us back!

52
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:55,790
Are you mad?

53
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,640
Mai, I'm sorry.

54
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,410
I shouldn't have been that harsh.

55
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,090
Let's get in first. Let's get in first.

56
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,030
Sit here.

57
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,170
What do you want to say?

58
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:07,490
I'm thinking

59
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,970
maybe

60
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,170
we can sell this apartment.

61
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,650
And rent a smaller one.

62
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,690
No! Dad left this apartment for us.

63
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:15,330
We can't sell it.

64
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,850
But if you don't sell this apartment,

65
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,330
I will go to prison!

66
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:20,530
What did you do?

67
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,490
I...

68
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:24,590
Recently, I invested in futures online

69
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:26,970
with your Aunt Zhao.

70
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:28,290
I lost all my money

71
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:29,850
and borrowed over 300,000 yuan from her.

72
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,690
Over 300,000!

73
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:32,210
How dare you borrow over 300,000?

74
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:34,330
Get out of my room! Get out!

75
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:35,650
I don't have the money for you!

76
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:35,880
If you don't sell this apartment,

77
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,930
Mom will go to prison!

78
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,510
I said no and that's final!

79
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,230
You can't sell this!

80
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:40,870
You are like your dad! Ungrateful!

81
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:44,430
How could you say that about my dad?

82
00:02:45,370 --> 00:02:46,210
I don't care! He's ungrateful!

83
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,110
I will smash it.

84
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,090
I will come up with something.

85
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:11,330
But we can't sell this apartment.

86
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:12,570
Why didn't you say this earlier?

87
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:14,170
Things wouldn't have turned out like this!

88
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,410
Goodbye, Qiao Mai.

89
00:03:49,290 --> 00:03:49,850
Miss Qiao!

90
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,430
I will go with you.

91
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,730
Hurry up and open the door for Miss Qiao!

92
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:02,810
(Su Yu's Home)

93
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,450
Hi, Luo Da. How did it go?

94
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,930
Chairman, Miss Qiao is in the car.

95
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:08,030
Shall we take her to you right away?

96
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:08,990
Great news!

97
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:10,650
Grandpa has turned in.

98
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:11,790
Get her settled in first.

99
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,650
Get her dressed up.

100
00:04:14,450 --> 00:04:15,100
I want to see her

101
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,090
looking exactly like Gu Manman.

102
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:16,930
Got it?

103
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,250
Got it, Chairman.

104
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:19,570
Miss Qiao wants to talk to you.

105
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:20,660
I'd like to remind you that

106
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,430
this is nothing but business.

107
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,390
Also, don't forget about my conditions.

108
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,610
Sure. But I would also like to remind you that

109
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:27,860
if my grandfather finds out that

110
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,840
you're the fake Gu Manman,

111
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,030
then you would have breached the contract.

112
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:30,780
As a result, you will have to

113
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:31,670
pay me a hefty compensation.

114
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,290
Got it.

115
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:35,190
Alright. I'm tired now.

116
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:36,710
I'll be going to bed soon. Bye.

117
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:52,050
Miss Qiao, from now on,

118
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:53,610
you will be Gu Manman.

119
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,230
Are you ready?
