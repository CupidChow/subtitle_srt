2
00:00:13,730 --> 00:00:14,250
Grandpa!

3
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,550
(Su Yu's Home)
Listen to me.

4
00:00:16,010 --> 00:00:16,620
You should have the operation

5
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,310
as soon as possible.

6
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,390
You brat!

7
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:20,210
Don't try to persuade me!

8
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:21,850
Bring Manman back!

9
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:23,330
Otherwise, I won't listen to you!

10
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,600
Grandpa, it's impossible

11
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,290
for Gu Manman and I to get married.

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:28,210
Her grandfather and I

13
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:30,610
were great buddies ever since childhood!

14
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:32,170
If I don't see Manman today,

15
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:33,570
I won't forgive you!

16
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,210
Chairman, Miss Gu has arrived.

17
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,390
Manman!

18
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:51,790
Oh Manman, come here!

19
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:53,470
Manman!

20
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:55,590
I haven't seen you for so long!

21
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,830
Aren't you gonna speak to me?

22
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,250
(Most Auspicious)
I wish Grandpa Su happiness

23
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,470
and longevity.

24
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,060
Most auspicious.

25
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,150
Manman, you have changed a lot!

26
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:18,890
Grandpa, let me explain.

27
00:01:18,890 --> 00:01:20,450
When we found Manman,

28
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,170
she

29
00:01:22,870 --> 00:01:23,850
was not well in the head.

30
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:26,960
Nonsense!

31
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,050
Manman.

32
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,990
I bet you've had it tough.

33
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:33,250
Where did you go all this while?

34
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:38,110
Erm...

35
00:01:39,010 --> 00:01:41,650
- Luo Da, take my grandpa back!
- Let's talk some other time.

36
00:01:41,970 --> 00:01:42,330
Come on!

37
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:55,210
If I leave,

38
00:01:55,870 --> 00:01:57,290
Grandpa Su will be sad.

39
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,970
We can't lie to him like that.

40
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:00,030
Qiao Mai, I'm warning you.

41
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,650
It's too late for regrets now.

42
00:02:02,650 --> 00:02:04,530
But I shouldn't lie.

43
00:02:04,910 --> 00:02:06,110
- Grandpa!
- Stop!

44
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,390
Let me remind you.

45
00:02:11,950 --> 00:02:13,350
We have signed a contract.

46
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:15,190
Do you know how much
you have to compensate me?

47
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:15,870
But

48
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:17,250
- Grandpa will...
- There is no "but".

49
00:02:17,330 --> 00:02:18,650
If you cause any more trouble,

50
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,650
I will punish you.

51
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:23,330
What are you two arguing about?

52
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:24,850
Grandpa, what are you doing here?

53
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,550
Grandpa!

54
00:02:26,570 --> 00:02:27,510
Grandpa! Everything is fine!

55
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:29,310
We are tired.

56
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:30,530
And we were about to rest.

57
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:44,810
What are you looking at?

58
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:49,330
This will be my last warning.

59
00:02:49,970 --> 00:02:51,030
Should you cause any more trouble,

60
00:02:52,290 --> 00:02:53,210
I will...

61
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,910
Your phone is ringing.

62
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:01,010
I said your phone is ringing!

63
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:05,050
Why is your cell phone broken like this?

64
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:06,550
I will give you a backup cell phone.

65
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,830
Get some rest.

66
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:22,890
Am I being too mean towards Qiao Mai?

67
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:25,350
She isn't Gu Manman after all.

68
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:31,790
(A year ago, in Su Yu's office)

69
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:36,070
How can they look so alike?

70
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:39,270
Gu Manman, is this one of your tricks again?

71
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:51,990
Luo Da!

72
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,430
What happened?

73
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,990
Miss Qiao... I mean... Miss Gu left.

74
00:03:57,410 --> 00:03:57,880
She said something serious

75
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,310
had happened to her family.

76
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:02,210
You don't pay your debt and you fought back?

77
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:02,830
What are you going to do?

78
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,270
Come with us!

79
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,110
Let him go! What do you want?

80
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:06,590
Why are you taking him?

81
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:10,390
Let him go, please!

82
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:11,910
What's going on? What are you doing?

83
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,150
My daughter, you're back!

84
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:15,210
They are taking your brother away!

85
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:15,710
Let him go!

86
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:16,450
Are you her daughter?

87
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,570
She wouldn't pay us back

88
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,700
and this guy gave me a punch!

89
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,950
You have to settle your debt today!

90
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:21,370
I said I would give you the apartment!

91
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,270
- Why are you being so aggressive?
- You can't give the apartment to them!

92
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,330
I gave you all my money!

93
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:24,800
Your Aunt Wang said

94
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,230
I had a chance to get my investment back,

95
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,190
so I invested that money too.

96
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:27,770
What?

97
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,690
Give us our money!

98
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,290
Mai, you have to figure something out!

99
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,530
You can't let them take your brother away!

100
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,410
I will go borrow money now

101
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:33,150
and pay you back tomorrow!

102
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,230
Give me 24 hours!

103
00:04:34,230 --> 00:04:34,730
Tomorrow?

104
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:36,090
Then I'm taking this brat with me today!

105
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:37,200
You owe us four hundred thousand yuan

106
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:37,830
including the medical fees!

107
00:04:37,970 --> 00:04:39,030
Go to the police station with us!

108
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,090
That's enough! Stop it!

109
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,910
Qiao Mai, will you really
let them take your brother away?

110
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,390
Do something!
