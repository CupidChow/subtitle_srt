2
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,490
Mr. Su, all of the tests came back normal.

3
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:18,450
You can get ready for the operation.

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:21,090
Grandpa.

5
00:00:21,530 --> 00:00:22,130
Grandpa.

6
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,170
Mr. Su, we'll excuse ourselves.

7
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:24,730
Okay.

8
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:26,010
Grandpa.

9
00:00:26,330 --> 00:00:26,840
Why did you reschedule

10
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,910
your operation to an earlier date?

11
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:30,610
I want to watch

12
00:00:31,290 --> 00:00:32,290
you two getting married

13
00:00:32,930 --> 00:00:34,610
after the operation.

14
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:39,290
Take a seat.

15
00:00:40,970 --> 00:00:41,610
For me,

16
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,290
I don't care if you're Manman

17
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:45,010
or Mai.

18
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,410
What I hope, is for my silly boy

19
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,250
to have a good partner.

20
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:53,570
Now that my wish has been fulfilled,

21
00:00:53,810 --> 00:00:56,410
I don't mind having the operation sooner.

22
00:00:56,410 --> 00:00:58,610
If I survive the surgery,

23
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:00,330
maybe I would be lucky enough

24
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:02,460
to attend your wedding.

25
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:04,370
Of course you will, Grandpa.

26
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:05,090
Yeah, Grandpa.

27
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,330
Don't say such silly things.

28
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:10,890
The patient will undergo surgery soon.

29
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:11,700
I need to inform you

30
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:12,890
about some pre-surgery instructions.

31
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:13,400
Would a family member

32
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,460
please come with me?

33
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,010
Mai,

34
00:01:18,450 --> 00:01:20,730
I want to talk with Yu alone.

35
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:21,890
Go ahead.

36
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,650
Alright, Grandpa.

37
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:26,890
What's wrong, Grandpa?

38
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:29,930
Are you going to Xiaolin Bay?

39
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,720
Yes, I plan on going there

40
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,530
after your operation.

41
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,860
Answer me.

42
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,450
What Gu Manman took

43
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,650
(One year ago at Su Yu's office)
from Max

44
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:39,280
was the blueprint for

45
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,410
the Xiaolin Bay project, right?

46
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:41,770
Yes.

47
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,930
I got someone to look into the matter.

48
00:01:46,050 --> 00:01:48,170
Gu Tianlin has been coveting Xiaolin Bay

49
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:50,650
for a long time.

50
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:52,890
The day she went missing

51
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,340
happens to be the day

52
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:57,930
she handed the blueprint to her father.

53
00:01:59,130 --> 00:01:59,850
So,

54
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:01,490
you are saying...

55
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:02,570
I think

56
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,890
her father is in Xiaolin Bay.

57
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:07,130
Yu,

58
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,970
don't go there.

59
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,290
I have a bad feeling.

60
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:22,050
If I went missing someday,

61
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,730
would you come for me?

62
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,090
It would seem that

63
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:31,290
the truth will be revealed

64
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:33,410
when I go to Xiaolin Bay.

65
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:39,130
What's wrong?

66
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:44,890
Nothing.

67
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,530
By the way,

68
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:47,660
I'm planning on going to Xiaolin Bay

69
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:48,570
these couple of days.

70
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,850
To inspect the tourism project.

71
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,060
So you have decided

72
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,010
to continue on with that project?

73
00:02:52,010 --> 00:02:53,100
I wouldn't want to be the one

74
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,810
to disappoint the villagers.

75
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,210
Good boy.

76
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:58,610
Are you taking me with you?

77
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,790
I have a bad feeling.

78
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,850
No.

79
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,450
No?

80
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,010
Are you hiding something from me?

81
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:12,890
Who do you plan to bring then?

82
00:03:15,050 --> 00:03:16,530
I'll be bringing Luo Da.

83
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,570
Luo Da!

84
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,050
Luo Da!

85
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,610
Why can't you bring me along?

86
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:25,170
That's weird.
