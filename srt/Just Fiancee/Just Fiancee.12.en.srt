00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:16,710
Manman,

3
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:18,590
we've been friends since we were kids

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:19,870
and we grew up together.

5
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:21,750
I can't accept this!

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:23,070
Why did you suddenly fall in love

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,070
with that brat, Su Yu!

8
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:24,710
All he knows

9
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:26,550
is study,

10
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:27,030
work,

11
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:27,870
study,

12
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,870
work...

13
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:30,430
Unlike him,

14
00:00:30,670 --> 00:00:32,290
I have so much free time

15
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:33,110
to be with you!

16
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:34,710
It sounds like

17
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:36,470
he is better than you.

18
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,430
You are quite straightforward.

19
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:42,270
And I find that adorable.

20
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:43,070
For real?

21
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,110
Then I have more to tell you.

22
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,190
Bear with me.

23
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,550
Do you remember?

24
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:49,430
When we were kids,

25
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,630
every time we went home from school,

26
00:00:50,630 --> 00:00:52,270
we'd pass by Aunt Li's house.

27
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,410
She had so many...

28
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:57,290
(Can someone help me?)

29
00:01:00,730 --> 00:01:01,970
Chairman.

30
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:04,370
What's this, Chairman?

31
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,300
How could Aunt Zhang

32
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,250
make something like this?

33
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:07,490
I'll tell her to make another bowl!

34
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,090
I made this.

35
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:13,510
You made this?

36
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:15,470
No wonder it...

37
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:16,970
looks so presentable

38
00:01:17,230 --> 00:01:18,250
and unique.

39
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,130
It's not bad, is it?

40
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,730
Yeah, it's not bad.

41
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,970
Eat with me.

42
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:23,850
I just had my meal

43
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,370
and I feel quite full.

44
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,990
Why don't you have it all, Chairman?

45
00:01:26,990 --> 00:01:28,030
You can have it all.

46
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,370
Enough, Luo Da.

47
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:41,010
You don't have to eat it all.

48
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:42,490
It's fine, Chairman.

49
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:44,610
Why did you decide

50
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,010
to cook today?

51
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,210
Qiao Mai taught me so.

52
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:50,850
Miss Qiao is quite unique then.

53
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:52,090
When Miss Gu was around,

54
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,570
you'd never do things like this.

55
00:01:56,830 --> 00:01:57,650
I'm sorry, Chairman.

56
00:01:57,650 --> 00:01:58,570
I shouldn't have brought that up.

57
00:01:59,370 --> 00:01:59,890
Don't worry.

58
00:02:00,710 --> 00:02:01,890
You've been with me for a long time.

59
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,410
I consider you as a friend.

60
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,650
Actually,

61
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,170
I don't hate Gu Manman that much.

62
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:08,730
I just can't figure out

63
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,970
why she'd steal company secrets.

64
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,290
So...

65
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,170
Will you always be with Miss Qiao?

66
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,490
Of course.

67
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:18,810
By the way,

68
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,610
continue to locate Gu Manman.

69
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,170
We owe her family an explanation.

70
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,010
Do you understand?

71
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:24,090
Yes, Chairman.

72
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,730
Excuse me, Chairman.

73
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:47,330
Manman!

74
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:49,090
I feel so happy

75
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:50,090
to be with you.

76
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,090
I really hope

77
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:52,690
this day

78
00:02:52,970 --> 00:02:53,830
would go on a loop.

79
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:55,310
You have never

80
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,570
talked with me this much.

81
00:02:57,290 --> 00:02:58,330
Lin Duoduo,

82
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,130
I don't know

83
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:01,490
how I treated you before,

84
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:02,970
but

85
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:03,930
I think

86
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,530
you should be with someone better.

87
00:03:05,610 --> 00:03:06,970
Someone that loves you more.

88
00:03:08,450 --> 00:03:09,090
No.

89
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,730
My love is persistent.

90
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:14,110
Forget it.

91
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,850
I'm leaving.

92
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:17,050
Manman,

93
00:03:17,570 --> 00:03:18,730
why don't you join me for dinner?

94
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,330
But Su Yu will be looking for me.

95
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:21,450
Bye.

96
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:43,850
Don't look at me like that!

97
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:45,100
I've been losing so much money

98
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,010
since you took over

99
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,370
the management of this beach.

100
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,930
Where are my bikes?

101
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,330
Where are my yachts?

102
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,290
All...

103
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:52,650
All gone.

104
00:03:53,130 --> 00:03:54,450
Ms. Lin, I'm sorry!

105
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,090
Why is nothing going according to my plans!

106
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,290
Give it here.

107
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:05,850
I mean the binoculars!

108
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:16,440
Gu Manman, who would've guessed

109
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:16,990
you would fool around with

110
00:04:16,990 --> 00:04:18,710
another man behind Su Yu's back?

111
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:23,170
Su Yu.

112
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,730
What now?

113
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:27,110
Come to my place.

114
00:04:27,110 --> 00:04:28,160
Your Gu Manman is fooling around

115
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,010
with another man.
