Your left hand!

00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,750
I swear to the ocean!

I swear to the ocean!

00:00:23,510 --> 00:00:24,350
Starting from today!

7
00:00:24,670 --> 00:00:25,630
Starting from today!

8
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:26,350
I will be

the guardian of this sea!

10
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:30,230
I will be the guardian of this sea!

11
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:30,870
Alright.

12
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,830
I present to you the equipment you will need!

13
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:37,630
And then,

14
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:39,470
I'll lend you my

15
00:00:39,470 --> 00:00:40,470
All-seeing Eyes!

16
00:00:42,350 --> 00:00:43,550
Look toward the beach,

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:45,230
hold up your weapon,

18
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:47,030
and start working!

19
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:11,030
Starting from today,

20
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,230
I'll start my new life.

21
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,550
Manman!

22
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:19,470
Manman.

23
00:01:19,910 --> 00:01:20,950
What are you two doing here?

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,950
Why are you dressed like this?

25
00:01:24,590 --> 00:01:25,830
I'm working here.

26
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:27,590
I'm the guardian of this sea.

27
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,310
I think

28
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:30,470
you didn't lose your memory

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,990
but your mind!

30
00:01:32,270 --> 00:01:32,790
Manman,

31
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,110
you are so admirable!

32
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:35,310
You are wealthy,

33
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,190
yet you choose to experience the working life.

34
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,350
I also want to be the guardian of the sea!

35
00:01:42,230 --> 00:01:44,070
Did you break up with Su Yu?

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,550
Why isn't he with you?

37
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:47,830
Sort of.

38
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:02,390
From today on, let's put everything

39
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:03,910
behind us.

40
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:04,390
You

41
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:05,630
shall guard your ocean.

42
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:05,990
As for me,

43
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,270
I'll protect my Su Yu.

44
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,590
I will officially be taking over your role now.

(Max Group)

46
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:16,630
Chairman.

47
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:18,590
Did you change your mind?

48
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,390
The project at Xiaolin Bay,

49
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:23,430
let it carry on.

50
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,750
That's good!

51
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,470
The villagers will be happy to know about it.

52
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:32,710
What about Ms. Gu?

53
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:33,870
Is she coming?

54
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,710
Xiaolin Bay is her hometown.

55
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:37,390
She will know the place better.

56
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,070
I'll think about it.

57
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:52,910
Sure.

58
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:54,510
I got it.

59
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:56,430
When the time comes...

60
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:05,110
Yu.

61
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:05,790
You are here.

62
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:08,630
Nothing.

63
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,710
Alright, I got it.

64
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,550
I heard you and Gu Manman broke up.

65
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,590
So I came here to claim my ownership.

66
00:03:20,310 --> 00:03:20,990
It's fine.

67
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:22,590
There was a mosquito.

68
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:23,950
Sure.

69
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:25,150
Then at the time...

70
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:26,750
Yu.

71
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:28,670
Do you know

72
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,310
the best way

73
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:31,510
to cure a broken heart

74
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:33,030
is to find a new lover?

75
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:34,030
I'll talk to you later.

76
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,150
Lin Shaoshao,

77
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:36,830
look at you.

78
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:38,990
What do you want?

79
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,870
Can't you leave me alone?

80
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:43,550
Yu, oh my!

81
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:45,510
Your heart is beating so fast.

82
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:47,510
So this is what it feels like

83
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:48,670
to like someone?

84
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,110
Do you have any common sense?

85
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:53,670
My heart

86
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:54,390
is here.

87
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:06,630
Fine.

88
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:07,950
You are good.

89
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:10,470
Now this office is yours.

90
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,830
You won't leave, right?

91
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,190
I'll go.

92
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,590
Yu!

93
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,470
I'm sorry.

94
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:17,990
Please don't be mad.

95
00:04:18,350 --> 00:04:19,950
If you think about me,

96
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:20,870
call me.

97
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:24,190
Sorry.

98
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:25,990
I was being too emotional.

99
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:27,750
It's fine.

100
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,830
I'll go then.

101
00:04:38,870 --> 00:04:40,070
Good day, Ms. Lin.

102
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:40,590
Hi.
