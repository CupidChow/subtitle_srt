00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
(Previously)
Could you give her this letter?

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,670
Don't be surprised Eeang Peung.

3
00:00:03,670 --> 00:00:06,610
I just want Fongkaew feel like she's part of our family.

4
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,000
She going to be punished by your parents.

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,520
This is your first time offence,

6
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,040
but your punishment

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,000
is eating the left overs in the kitchen for two weeks

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,910
As for Jom, as an accomplice

9
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:20,320
must be punished as well.

10
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:21,080
That's...

11
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,850
There's an event today.

12
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:24,420
I want you to join me.

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,560
Event?

14
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,610
A Christmas event.

15
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:37,200
Khun Yai.

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,420
So

17
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:48,520
Where did you bring me?

18
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,480
This is the place I told you about.

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,850
Really?

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,680
Ever since we walked in

21
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,240
I haven't seen a Christmas party
that you spoke about.

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,210
We're not there yet.

23
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,600
Oh..

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,840
Let's go,

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,160
follow me.

26
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,120
Come on Jom.

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,160
Ok.

28
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,320
Jom.

29
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,640
Let's find a seat.

30
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,200
Let's get this table.

31
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:24,560
Oh.

32
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,240
Thank you.

33
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,880
What are you looking for?

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Oh, nothing.

35
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,800
I'm just excited

36
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,840
I never imagined that I'd...

37
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,440
have the chance to celebrate Christmas

38
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,120
here...

39
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:12,880
Do you like it here?

40
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:16,200
Yes, it's pretty nice.

41
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,600
I knew that you'd like it here.

42
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,880
This is my favorite place.

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,390
They call it the Puttyuban Bar.

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,400
In fact

45
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,800
I only discovered it recently.

46
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,110
It's very secretive.

47
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,080
So much so that

48
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,160
not many people know about it.

49
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,040
This is your favorite place?

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:49,800
Yes.

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,120
For someone who likes to come here

52
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,000
it must mean that you are a person who likes to drink.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,880
You once told me that

54
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,990
you don't really like to drink.

55
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,720
I drink sometimes.

56
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,880
I remember

57
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,290
I've already told you.

58
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,660
Heh...

59
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:16,200
I thought you told me that

60
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,790
You can not remember what happened that night?

61
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,900
How do you remember your own words that night?

62
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,120
Uh...

63
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,710
I...

64
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,290
I remember before I fell asleep.

65
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,360
Oh

66
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,000
I ordered a drink.

67
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,760
Wait a moment.

68
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,690
Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!

69
00:04:48,690 --> 00:04:49,860
Cheers to the most

70
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,990
wonderful time of the year

71
00:04:52,450 --> 00:04:54,280
Ho! Ho! Ho!

72
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:55,680
Cheers lady

73
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:56,430
Cheers

74
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,090
Cheers

75
00:04:57,170 --> 00:04:57,960
Cheers

76
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,880
I wish you all a wonderful christmas

77
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,390
filled with memories you'll cherish forever!

78
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:07,340
Merry Christmas and Happy New Year

79
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,980
Thank you very much

80
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:09,880
Thank you

81
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,520
Merry Christmas

82
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,370
Cheers

83
00:05:12,370 --> 00:05:13,300
Thank you very much

84
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,600
Jom.

85
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,010
Wait for me here, don't do anywhere.

86
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,360
If you want to eat anything

87
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:25,520
you can go ahead and order.

88
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,610
I have some business to tend to,

89
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,520
I'll be right back.

90
00:06:42,200 --> 00:06:46,200
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 6)

91
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:47,560
Cheers, nice to meet you

92
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,480
Why did a foreigner,
respected by the lumber traders like you

93
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,530
so dressed up an occasion
that it seems rather disgraceful?

94
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,110
I'll see you later.

95
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,360
- Nice to meet you
- Take care

96
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,160
I think that,

97
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,280
you've been following your father around for too long.

98
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,080
So you've

99
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,190
been picking up his way of thinking.

100
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,390
I was just having fun with change,
not holding on to things.

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,150
You should try that sometime.

102
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,000
If the occasion ever comes up.

103
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,320
But I never thought

104
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,130
that I'd see you here today.

105
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,000
Have a seat.

106
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,800
The thing that I asked you to investigate.

107
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,200
How is it going?

108
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:49,800
You just got here and you jumped straight to the point.

109
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:51,880
I don't know why I should beat around the bush.

110
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,880
I'm not you.

111
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:03,200
I went in and asked for secret information.

112
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,720
From the case file of a friend in the department.

113
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:11,120
The fire incident at Kad six months ago.

114
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,220
The case was concluded to be an accident.

115
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,850
Accident?

116
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,320
Yes.

117
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,980
But my friend in the department

118
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,360
he found out the secret of that case.

119
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,640
He told me that

120
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,160
at the scene of the crime, evidence was found.

121
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,420
Which is expected to point to arson

122
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:36,800
but that piece of evidence
was not recorded in the document.

123
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,660
The officers who overlooked this case

124
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,720
that took and stance and was going to
tell people about the documents

125
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:48,360
were reassigned to other government offices.

126
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:54,400
Do you think something suspicious is going on?

127
00:08:56,400 --> 00:09:00,170
What about the things that
are related to my brother in law?

128
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,000
I haven't found a connection yet

129
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:16,390
other than that his new wife

130
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:19,350
was affected by that fire.

131
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,800
They say that the land's price

132
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:25,500
will become even higher in the future

133
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,600
but the land owners are not selling it.

134
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,000
People who see this opportunity

135
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,200
might want to use this

136
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,890
as an excuse to evict people out.

137
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,880
Khun Yai.

138
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,000
Khun Yai.

139
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:50,000
Thank you for the information James.

140
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,640
But it seem like I must bother you to

141
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,780
to investigate this matter further.

142
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,160
If there are any updates

143
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,500
please inform me.

144
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,880
Please excuse me.

145
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,520
Wait Khun Yai.

146
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:08,730
I have done your bidding.

147
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:12,560
So I would like to negotiate my exchange.

148
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,940
What's the exchange?

149
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,000
If I can do it, I'm happy to do it.

150
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,730
This is my exchange.

151
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:30,480
It doesn't have much to do with you.

152
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,600
But it's more about your close friends.

153
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,080
May I please sit with you?

154
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,640
Uh... who?

155
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,680
It's me, Mr. James.

156
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,200
Oh, it's Mr. James that's why your voice sounds familiar.

157
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,680
Please have a seat.

158
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:14,480
Thank you

159
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,670
It may have value to its owner.

160
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,280
Otherwise, they wouldn't keep it in this chest.

161
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,610
And look at the lines.

162
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,710
It's not an old style kind of drawing.

163
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:51,750
Are you ok?

164
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,960
If you're not comfortable with me sitting here, I can go.

165
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:58,080
Oh, not at all.

166
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:03,600
Mr. James, please sit with me for a moment.

167
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Sure.

168
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,720
I'm very willing.

169
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,740
But I had no idea

170
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,360
that you'd wear this kind of outfit

171
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,670
like other people.

172
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,670
Well, I was just having fun.

173
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,990
This is my safe place.

174
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,400
And everyone here is already a familiar face.

175
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:33,400
But I didn't know that it this place

176
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,200
s also your favorite place.

177
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:41,960
Well, actually this is my first time here.

178
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,880
Khun Yai has brought me here.

179
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,640
Well, that's good.

180
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:48,800
Anyway, I hope you like this place as much as I do.

181
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,640
Wow!

182
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:25,320
Who is that?

183
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,720
That's Nuey.

184
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:30,840
But the villagers call him Neuy, the green queen.

185
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,140
Green queen?

186
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:37,440
Yes

187
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,760
He likes wearing green

188
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:45,000
and the way he acts

189
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:48,460
is very feminine.

190
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,800
So that's why people call him that.

191
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,560
But...

192
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:12,920
he looks very happy.

193
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,520
No Jom.

194
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,760
Before he could get to this point.

195
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:21,640
He went through alot.

196
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:24,850
Neuy used to live in Phranakorn

197
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,640
before he fled to this city.

198
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,210
The villagers in Phranakorn saw him as an outcast

199
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,480
and he was always taken advantage of by the men.

200
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,520
He might not be a saint

201
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:44,970
but what he has always done

202
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:50,350
he has always wanted a place like this.

203
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:57,720
And that is why this is one of my favorite places.
Because it is a place

204
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,800
Because it is a place

205
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:02,880
where I can vent out repressed feelings

206
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,280
and be able to be myself as much as possible.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:11,070
You understand, right?

208
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:14,700
I understand.

209
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,720
I understand a lot too

210
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:24,570
that this matter is not strange at all

211
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,080
Here, Khun Yai.

212
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:49,540
The thing that you asked me to look for.

213
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,640
Thank you very much for providing this for me.

214
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,080
It's ok.

215
00:15:55,520 --> 00:15:57,380
I'd should rather apologize to you

216
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,480
because it took such a long time

217
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,690
because we had to make it again.

218
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,040
It's ok, I understand.

219
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:06,720
Is this for a special someone?

220
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,720
Please excuse me.

221
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,800
You're dressed up as Santa Claus like this.

222
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:20,550
Do you have to prepare gifts for everyone?

223
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,400
I was actually thinking about

224
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,790
what gifts should I buy for everyone?

225
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,680
I think everyone must be very happy.

226
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,520
Because even when you just entered the room,

227
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,490
everyone became so cheerful.

228
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:34,900
Uh, I just want to...

229
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,840
Oh, Khun Yai.

230
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:42,490
Jom, have you been waiting for me long?

231
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,600
Oh, not for long.

232
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Well, just now, Mr. James saw me sitting alone.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,260
So he volunteered to sit with me to keep me company.

234
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,000
Looks like it's time for me to eat and drink.

235
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,640
Thank you very much for your kindness James

236
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,120
for keeping Jom company.

237
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,250
It's okay, Khun Yai.

238
00:17:07,080 --> 00:17:09,580
If it's Jom then I'm always happy to help.

239
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:15,000
See you around Jom.

240
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:18,520
Merry Christmas.

241
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,540
Ho! Ho! Ho!

242
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,080
Jom.

243
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:42,200
What did you and Mr.James talk about?

244
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,000
We talked about a lot of things

245
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:49,460
but nothing of importance.

246
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,000
Oh.

247
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,720
Is there something wrong?

248
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:23,360
No.

249
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,480
Geez!

250
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,110
When it's time to go home
you just drop everything!

251
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,760
Put everything in it's place!

252
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,720
Yes sir.

253
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,520
Good!

254
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,160
Pick it up!

255
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,820
Put away the stairs!

256
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,640
And those cloths on the floor!

257
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:11,790
Get home safe.

258
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:12,750
Get home safe.

259
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,540
Get home safe.

260
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,960
Bye.

261
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:17,880
Get home safe.

262
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,840
Oh, Uncle Tun

263
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:24,640
could you please follow up on the equipment

264
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,200
That will be used to practice with
the roof that is leaking.

265
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:28,720
And for tomorrow, it's the same

266
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,120
I won't be able to come in tomorrow.

267
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,460
But you can call me anytime.

268
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:33,080
Yes, Mr.Jom.

269
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,400
I'm going to go home now.

270
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:34,960
Ok.

271
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:35,480
Bye.

272
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,140
Get home safe.

273
00:20:36,140 --> 00:20:36,760
Sure.

274
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,480
What is this?

275
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:32,800
Jom.

276
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:11,240
It's just what happened last time.

277
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:33,800
Jom.

278
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,120
Jom.

279
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:42,350
Wait!

280
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:43,400
Wait!

281
00:22:43,800 --> 00:22:44,440
Wait!

282
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:48,720
Jom!

283
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,800
Jom.

284
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:20,290
Who are you calling out for?

285
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,430
I...

286
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,240
Don't lie to me

287
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:32,340
this isn't the first time that you're acting like this.

288
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:38,410
I was dreaming.

289
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:40,680
Dreaming?

290
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:45,200
It was just a silly dream.

291
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,020
You don't have to worry yourself about it.

292
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:50,110
Please tell me about it.

293
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:54,090
Then I'll decide if it's a silly thing or not.

294
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:04,120
I dreamt of this place

295
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:09,140
but it's not here, in this current time.

296
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,270
I don't know how to explain it.

297
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,100
Do you want to sleep in my room?

298
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,400
Huh?

299
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,060
Why?

300
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:24,620
In case you sleep walk

301
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:27,600
and I can just grab you in time.

302
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:32,400
Uh... I don't think that's a good idea.

303
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:35,120
It doesn't look good.

304
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,480
Look good?

305
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,720
I'm not telling you to

306
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,380
sleep on the same bed as me.

307
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Uh... ok.

308
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,280
That's... what I understood too.

309
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,200
I didn't meant that

310
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,360
I meant it in any other way.

311
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:58,600
Oh, at Puttyuban Bar.

312
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,200
What were you talking to Mr.James about?

313
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:07,130
You know about that?

314
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:09,920
Yes.

315
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:12,280
Mr.James briefly told me about it

316
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
when we were sitting together

317
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:14,880
before you came back.

318
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:17,770
I thought you said that

319
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,640
you were just talking about normal things.

320
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,200
Uh...

321
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:25,000
Never mind.

322
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:30,360
I was just wondering about something
related to my brother-in-law.

323
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:32,320
As you once asked me

324
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,920
So I asked Mr. James to do it for me.

325
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:41,900
Whose picture is this?

326
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,600
May I have a look?

327
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:45,210
Oh

328
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,190
The drawing isn't finished yet.

329
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,240
And it's not very pretty either.

330
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:51,600
You don't need to see it.

331
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:53,800
It's okay.

332
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,250
I probably shouldn't know yet.

333
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:01,240
Jom, go to sleep.

334
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,850
It's already very late.

335
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:07,030
Uh... Khun Yai.

336
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,520
Jeed has really gotten me into trouble this time!

337
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,380
Running out of the grass

338
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:24,960
and into the foriegn master!

339
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,000
I really wanted to just disapear and hide underground.

340
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,680
What a waste of bannanas to feed him!

341
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:33,990
Could you help me train him?

342
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,000
Jom.

343
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,080
Jom.

344
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:44,560
Jom.

345
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,400
Oh?

346
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:47,250
What?

347
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,300
I've been talking since we entered the market
and we're at the end of the market.

348
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,600
Didn't you listen to what I said at all?

349
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,370
Uh... I was just thinking about something.

350
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:59,800
So what did you say?

351
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:03,700
Did you and Jeed lose?

352
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:05,400
Yeag.

353
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,660
The pig ran and stepped on the masters pride!

354
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,320
How could I win?

355
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:12,590
Will you get punished?

356
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,720
No.

357
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,550
This time I wore a good amulet.

358
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,200
Well, Fongkaew, came to help me.

359
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,000
Fongkaew?

360
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:20,880
Yeah.

361
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,620
I was surprised too.

362
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:26,740
Now Fong Kaew has become master's favorite wife.

363
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:28,480
That's very suspicious

364
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,600
Jom.

365
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:34,200
Fongkaew.

366
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,720
I snuck out to see you at your house

367
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,370
but people there told me that

368
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,070
you came out to the market with Ming.

369
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:45,440
Is there something wrong?

370
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,620
Can we go talk somewhere private?

371
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,480
Please? Ming?

372
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,690
Because Khamsaen finds me.

373
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:58,600
Merry christmas and happy new year

374
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,360
If it's Jom then I'm always happy to help.

375
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Ho! Ho! Ho!

376
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:30,200
Uh.. Why did you bring me here?

377
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,960
This is my home.

378
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,200
Mom.

379
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:40,200
Mom.

380
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:41,120
Huh?

381
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,590
Who is shouting?

382
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,400
It's Fongkaew.

383
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,200
How did you come here?

384
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:52,220
Oh, don't run!

385
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,490
I ran away.

386
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,560
You and your mouth.

387
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:01,560
I missed you.

388
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:04,480
Oh, you're acting strange.

389
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,340
Who is this?

390
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,800
Or are you secretly having an affair!?

391
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:16,240
No, that's not true.

392
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:22,770
I'm... friends with her.

393
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:24,560
My name is Jom.

394
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,930
This is my friend.

395
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:33,350
He is very good to me at that house.

396
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,170
Oh, that's what it is.

397
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,080
Thank you so much for being kind to her.

398
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,120
This one is stubborn,
that's why she has only a few friends.

399
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:49,320
Let's eat together first.

400
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:51,440
Ok.

401
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,620
No need to rush back yet.

402
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,240
I missed you.

403
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:55,490
I missed you too.

404
00:30:55,490 --> 00:30:56,960
You look so beautiful.

405
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,280
Really beautiful

406
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,740
Here's drinking water.

407
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,000
Oh, thank you.

408
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:19,080
Have you lived here since you were a child?

409
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:21,360
No.

410
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,670
I just moved here

411
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,120
after my home caught on fire.

412
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:41,520
So that means that your mother's face is like that

413
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:42,600
is because..

414
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:51,720
Yes, half of my mother's face was burnt.

415
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,630
But my father...

416
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,380
my father...

417
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,520
he was burnt alive in that house.

418
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,760
After my father died

419
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,710
I was sent to wed with Mr.Robert.

420
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:24,080
My mother thought he was a saint

421
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:30,200
because he earlier asked for my hand

422
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:32,920
and he also helped us

423
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,830
after the fire.

424
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,600
But before that

425
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:40,630
I declined his marriage offer

426
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,220
because I had Khamsaen

427
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:53,770
not long after that, my home was burned down.

428
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:56,560
Don't you think it's strange?

429
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,680
I brought you here

430
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:04,740
to tell you everything

431
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,160
so that you could understand me better.

432
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:14,870
Thank you for the letter.

433
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,030
I see the truth much clearer.

434
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:29,850
About Mr.Robert,

435
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:34,110
Khun Yai also has his doubts too.

436
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,880
Fongkaew.

437
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,400
What are you doing in this room?

438
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,680
This is my private study room.

439
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,680
No one is allowed in here.

440
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:34,610
I just wanted to come in and help clean it.

441
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,080
I didn't know that it wasn't allowed.

442
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,390
I'm so sorry.

443
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:47,300
Why are you home so early?

444
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:50,200
I had a headache,

445
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:52,240
so I came to rest.

446
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:56,640
Then,

447
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:05,440
let me help you feel better.

448
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:35,670
Oh.

449
00:36:35,800 --> 00:36:38,650
Khun Yai, you're up so early today.

450
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:41,040
I'm a lone wolf.

451
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:44,000
I should be able to take care of my own self.

452
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:48,910
Nobody can look after me forever.

453
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:56,000
Then I'll go in and help clean up the room for you.

454
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:03,480
I've taken care of everything myself.

455
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,770
Jom, if you have something to do, go do it.

456
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:28,840
Snacks have arrived, Khun Yai.

457
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:29,680
Please eat first.

458
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:30,940
You will have the strength to continue reading.

459
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,680
I'm going to go out now.

460
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:40,360
Could you prepare my tennis clothes for me.

461
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:41,700
It's time now.

462
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,120
Wait, Khun Yai.

463
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,550
Khun Yai...

464
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,220
Are you angry at me?

465
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,020
Don't you know

466
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,390
how I feel about you?

467
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:19,830
Uh... I don't know.

468
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,720
Did my actions

469
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,960
not reach your heart at all?

470
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,800
Oh.

471
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,600
Khun Yai...

472
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,240
Or should I write you a long poem?

473
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:40,780
Or in what way should I tell you?

474
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,960
So that you can understand how I feel about you.

475
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,800
Argh.

476
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,320
What's wrong?

477
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:31,880
It's your beloved Khun Yai!

478
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,560
I don't know what is wrong with him

479
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:33,700
he won't tell me

480
00:39:33,700 --> 00:39:35,240
and if he won't tell me then how can I know?

481
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,000
Right?

482
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:46,960
Auntie Prik

483
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,610
You've taken care of Khun Yai
since he was little, right?

484
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,310
Uh, it was me.

485
00:39:56,880 --> 00:39:58,760
That means you should know.

486
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:01,560
What Khun Yai like to eat?

487
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,840
Right?

488
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:06,890
If I didn't know, no one would know!

489
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:11,230
Hm... really asking the right person.

490
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,080
But what is it, Aunt Prik?

491
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,490
How much do I have to add?

492
00:40:33,640 --> 00:40:34,440
It doesn't have to be a lot.

493
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,810
What are you doing?

494
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,120
I'm grating a coconut.

495
00:40:40,280 --> 00:40:41,200
Woah!

496
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:44,360
Come get up, I'll show you.

497
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:45,810
Lift it to the side.

498
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,400
And then keep turning it.

499
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:54,020
Do this until it becomes sticky together.

500
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,560
Uh.

501
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:08,000
Oh.

502
00:41:09,360 --> 00:41:10,680
Is it going to be finished today?

503
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,270
There's always mistakes to be made along the way.

504
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,180
Like this?

505
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:20,240
The color is so pretty.

506
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:23,460
This one will be sprinkled on top of the dessert.

507
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:36,920
Hmm.

508
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:44,000
This is the dessert that
Khun Yai liked to eat since childhood.

509
00:41:44,520 --> 00:41:45,970
Thank you very much, Aunt Prik.

510
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:47,960
Take it and put it away well.

511
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,270
It will spoil before Khun Yai can eat it.

512
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:52,000
Yes.

513
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,170
Does it have to be that serious, Khun Yai?

514
00:42:14,640 --> 00:42:16,440
So much that you have to put so much emotion into it?

515
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,000
With Jom.

516
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:23,000
My feelings towards Jom

517
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:25,240
is not that different from you.

518
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:27,200
Do you know that

519
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,450
very few people understand Neuy,

520
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,480
No...

521
00:42:37,480 --> 00:42:38,600
people like us

522
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:45,480
Do you know that I..

523
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:48,100
I do.

524
00:42:49,120 --> 00:42:50,400
And just like I said.

525
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:56,350
It's not a strange thing.

526
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,600
And do you know that

527
00:43:01,080 --> 00:43:02,120
I...

528
00:43:03,480 --> 00:43:04,600
like you.

529
00:43:14,400 --> 00:43:18,730
I've liked Jom since the first time we met.

530
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:22,960
I don't know.

531
00:43:24,600 --> 00:43:28,420
You have something similar to my first male lover.

532
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:31,180
When I saw you

533
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:36,650
I felt the same way.

534
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:48,250
Then what about that lover of Mr. James?

535
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,560
He... where has he gone?

536
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,280
He's not here anymore.

537
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,510
I would like to tell him that I like him.

538
00:44:03,120 --> 00:44:06,600
But it was already too late.

539
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:13,720
Don't worry.

540
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,890
I'm not going to expect anything.

541
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,800
If you don't feel the same way.

542
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,000
I'm just afraid

543
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,120
I'm afraid I won't have the chance to say it.

544
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,000
I...

545
00:44:43,720 --> 00:44:45,270
I'm sorry, Mr. James.

546
00:44:48,080 --> 00:44:49,820
I already have someone I like.

547
00:44:58,000 --> 00:44:59,730
I can see that.

548
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:07,600
So Jom, don't forget to tell him.

549
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:12,890
Don't want you to regret it later.

550
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:28,810
It's time that you do something.

551
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:30,840
Or else

552
00:45:31,400 --> 00:45:33,770
I'll be back in the game with you again.

553
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,470
Khun Yai.

554
00:46:02,120 --> 00:46:03,520
Here's your favorite food.

555
00:46:11,920 --> 00:46:14,910
How did you know that I liked muscats?

556
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,840
Auntie Prik told me

557
00:46:16,840 --> 00:46:18,920
that it's your favorite.

558
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,540
Only a few people know.

559
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:25,000
Thank you.

560
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:31,620
Khun Yai.

561
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,600
I don't know why you're angry at me.

562
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,120
But please don't be angry at me.

563
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,720
When you're like this

564
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:39,900
it makes me feel bad.

565
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,370
It's not your fault.

566
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:51,880
It's me,

567
00:46:52,400 --> 00:46:53,720
that doesn't know how to calm down.

568
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,000
Hm...

569
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,800
The drawing in your bedroom

570
00:47:00,200 --> 00:47:01,880
Is this a picture of Mr.James?

571
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:07,560
Did you come into my room?

572
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,140
Why did you do that?

573
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:12,810
It's because you refuse to tell me everything.

574
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,420
I knew that that night

575
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,920
Mr. James said that he liked you.

576
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,700
Well, I just thought

577
00:47:25,480 --> 00:47:27,790
that it was Mr.James's personal matter.

578
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:31,990
I didn't think I had to tell you.

579
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,290
But anything about you

580
00:47:34,440 --> 00:47:36,150
also concerns me now.

581
00:47:37,720 --> 00:47:38,600
Ok.

582
00:47:40,720 --> 00:47:42,170
Uh...

583
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:47,800
It's just that.

584
00:47:59,320 --> 00:48:00,760
I like you.

585
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:19,590
What's wrong?

586
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,880
Please excuse me.

587
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,000
Jom.

588
00:50:59,720 --> 00:51:00,760
Everything is all done.

589
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:02,830
Please excuse me.

590
00:51:04,320 --> 00:51:05,400
Wait.

591
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:12,480
Am I making you feel uncomfortable?

592
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,260
What do you mean?

593
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:31,030
It's about how I feel about you like I said before.

594
00:51:35,000 --> 00:51:36,600
If you hate me.

595
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,000
I will not persist.

596
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,140
It's not like that.

597
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,800
I just..

598
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:49,160
I'm just afraid.

599
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:54,120
You know very well

600
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:56,460
that the relationship between the two of us

601
00:51:56,460 --> 00:52:01,400
might be a big problem for you in the future.

602
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:05,780
What about Khun Luang and Khun Ying?

603
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:08,170
And the society around you.

604
00:52:11,160 --> 00:52:14,680
Khun Yai, please think about it one more time.

605
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:17,160
I don't care.

606
00:52:18,400 --> 00:52:21,410
Whether it is pressure from my family or society.

607
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:23,720
I can bare it.

608
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,590
But if I don't get to be with you

609
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:30,360
then I probably would be heart broken.

610
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,400
Jom

611
00:52:38,680 --> 00:52:40,200
Jom, look at me.

612
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,120
Then please answer me.

613
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,670
Do you want to be a piece with me?

614
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:54,830
What do you mean by piece?

615
00:52:56,000 --> 00:52:57,460
A lover.

616
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,640
Try cutting everything out

617
00:53:03,360 --> 00:53:05,400
and tell me your feelings.

618
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:08,990
Do you want to be with me or not?

619
00:53:20,120 --> 00:53:22,160
Don't forget to tell him.

620
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:25,640
I don't want you to regret it later.

621
00:53:25,840 --> 00:53:27,420
Did my actions

622
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:29,700
not reach your heart at all?

623
00:53:29,700 --> 00:53:31,390
Or should I write you a long poem

624
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:32,820
to tell you

625
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,260
so that you can understand how I feel about you.

00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,800
I thought I'd give it since Christmas.

633
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,850
But there was no opportunity to give it at all.

634
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:31,000
Please sit and wait for me for a moment.

635
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,510
Oh, ok.

636
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,800
Is this really for me?

637
00:55:06,480 --> 00:55:08,000
Consider it a gift from me.

638
00:55:09,720 --> 00:55:10,980
The time for the two of us

639
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,760
has begun, Jom.

640
00:55:18,840 --> 00:55:20,000
Thank you.

641
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:27,320
Well, I have a present for you as well.

642
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,480
Jom.

643
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,910
I thought there was only a picture of Mr.James.

644
00:55:59,320 --> 00:56:00,400
Khun Yai

645
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:03,520
Mr. James's painting is just

646
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:06,720
the picture that I intended to capture the atmosphere of Puttyuban Bar.

647
00:56:06,720 --> 00:56:07,560
That's all.

648
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:11,520
But your picture,

649
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,000
I really put my heart into it

650
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,040
at first I was going to keep it for myself.

651
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:35,640
Khun Yai.

652
00:56:36,360 --> 00:56:38,520
Why are you so close?

653
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:40,320
What are you doing?

654
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:48,800
I'm just thinking

655
00:56:50,760 --> 00:56:52,080
of why

656
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:55,770
do I love you so much.

657
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,800
You have a really sweet mouth.

658
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,210
How do you know?

659
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:14,320
Have you tasted it?

660
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:20,600

Jom.

673
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:39,880
Can you stay tonight and scratch my back

674
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:41,580

675
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:47,250
That's all.

676
00:58:48,320 --> 00:58:50,160
I won't do anything else to you.

677
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:51,200
I promise.

678
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,050
(Next Episode)
What are you doing?

679
00:59:55,050 --> 00:59:57,290
We're downstairs, someone might see us.

680
00:59:57,290 --> 00:59:58,320
Are you still not used to it,

681
00:59:58,680 --> 01:00:00,450
being hugged often by me?

682
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:03,760
Can I ask my father to rub it on my back for me?

683
01:00:05,010 --> 01:00:08,310
Are you sure?

684
01:00:09,960 --> 01:00:14,350
There's something about different about Yai.

685
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,320
I think Khun Yai and Jom are secretly dating each other.

686
01:00:19,320 --> 01:00:21,640
I'm really asking you.

687
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:23,600
