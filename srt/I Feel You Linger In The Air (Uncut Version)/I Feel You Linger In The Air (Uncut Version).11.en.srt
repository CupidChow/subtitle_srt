00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,150
(Previously)
Phraya Soradech and Mr. Robert

2
00:00:02,188 --> 00:00:04,590
are involved and behind the arson

3
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:05,451
at Kad Luang.

4
00:00:05,828 --> 00:00:07,860
Do you still want to go study abroad?

5
00:00:08,222 --> 00:00:10,500
But if there is something

6
00:00:10,742 --> 00:00:13,360
that makes me return from
where I'm from with no choice.

7
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:14,340
- Jom.
- Will you...

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,874
I have one thing that I want you to see.

9
00:00:19,068 --> 00:00:20,480
The person in that picture is Jom.

10
00:00:20,857 --> 00:00:23,520
What if I told you that
I'm not from this place.

11
00:00:23,971 --> 00:00:25,520
But I came from the future.

12
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,245
Would you believe me?

13
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:48,990
Khun Yai.

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,740
Do you believe me?

15
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,860
Everything you told me

16
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,430
sounds so strange
that it's hard to believe.

17
00:01:07,502 --> 00:01:08,330
I understand.

18
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:12,451
But I don't think that you're lying.

19
00:01:14,702 --> 00:01:15,960
I don't believe it at all,

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,010
that you're a ghost or demon.

21
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:23,508
Don't you know?

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:25,788
You've unknowingly spoken

23
00:01:26,417 --> 00:01:28,360
about the future many times.

24
00:01:30,702 --> 00:01:32,070
As for your shadow,

25
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,800
I have no clue

26
00:01:35,714 --> 00:01:36,931
but if you want me to believe

27
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:40,028
that you're a ghost or demon.

28
00:01:43,023 --> 00:01:44,200
I will not believe that at all.

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:48,668
About that,

30
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,440
I have to tell you

31
00:01:54,297 --> 00:01:55,268
that I am not a ghost.

32
00:01:57,657 --> 00:01:58,610
Of course not.

33
00:02:09,971 --> 00:02:10,560
Right?

34
00:02:12,440 --> 00:02:13,550
What kind of ghost

35
00:02:14,845 --> 00:02:16,491
would be so warm?

36
00:02:19,845 --> 00:02:24,220
Aren't you scared of me?

37
00:02:28,388 --> 00:02:29,342
I'm not.

38
00:02:31,851 --> 00:02:32,880
But I'm afraid...

39
00:02:37,878 --> 00:02:38,714
that one day

40
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:43,834
I will disappear

41
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,493
and no one

42
00:02:52,862 --> 00:02:53,840
will remember me.

43
00:02:57,004 --> 00:03:05,357
You, Jeed, and mother.

44
00:03:10,397 --> 00:03:14,040
It's ok.

45
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,510
I'm here with you.

46
00:03:21,899 --> 00:03:23,230
You don't have to be afraid.

47
00:03:26,210 --> 00:03:28,410
What should I do?

48
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:30,510
It's ok, Jom.

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:54,000
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 11)

50
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:11,700
Are you asleep?

51
00:05:14,010 --> 00:05:14,340
Yes.

52
00:05:17,424 --> 00:05:18,262
What about you?

53
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:21,650
Me too.

54
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:39,110
Khun Yai, our relationship

55
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,550
how do you think it will play out?

56
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,610
I don't know.

57
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:56,030
The future is something we cannot foresee.

58
00:05:57,785 --> 00:05:59,665
You're from the future yourself

59
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:03,635
and you don't even know your fate.

60
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:05,220
Right?

61
00:06:13,125 --> 00:06:14,775
But what I know right now

62
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,095
is that you're my love

63
00:06:22,485 --> 00:06:24,560
and all I can do it be with you

64
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,100
in a time like this.

65
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:29,810
I will never let you

66
00:06:31,535 --> 00:06:33,165
worry all alone.

67
00:06:34,955 --> 00:06:35,835
I promise you.

68
00:06:58,425 --> 00:06:59,175
Do you know that

69
00:07:01,925 --> 00:07:02,745
at first

70
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:05,900
when I arrived

71
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,310
I didn't want to be here at all.

72
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,290
I tried everyway

73
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,800
to go back.

74
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:18,085
I cried all alone every night

75
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:25,531
closing my eyes and hoping
that when I open my eyes

76
00:07:26,762 --> 00:07:28,740
this would be all just a dream.

77
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:39,840
But after meeting you,

78
00:07:41,072 --> 00:07:42,980
those thoughts went away.

79
00:07:44,976 --> 00:07:50,853
You've taught me so many things

80
00:07:52,512 --> 00:07:56,752
that I've never known before.

81
00:07:58,645 --> 00:08:02,480
But you still understand us all,

82
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:07,500
everyone, and that includes me

83
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,538
who are ordinary people unlike you
and your noble family

84
00:08:12,954 --> 00:08:14,261
You might not know this

85
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,789
but the person who changed
everything around here

86
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:21,306
so that we could have this day,

87
00:08:22,976 --> 00:08:23,781
is you.

88
00:08:27,248 --> 00:08:29,990
I should be the one saying those words.

89
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:35,264
Thank you so much.

90
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:38,160
Thank you for everything

91
00:08:38,912 --> 00:08:39,829
that you've done for us.

92
00:08:41,328 --> 00:08:42,869
You're like family,

93
00:08:44,197 --> 00:08:45,925
an important person of
the House of Palathip.

94
00:08:49,029 --> 00:08:50,384
Jom, please remember.

95
00:08:56,490 --> 00:09:04,940
♪ Dear, my dearest, I've
been defeated completely ♪

96
00:09:05,381 --> 00:09:11,685
♪ Even in the life after,
I'll be loving you solely ♪

97
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,242
Doctor?

98
00:09:30,026 --> 00:09:32,560
How is Khun Eeang Peung?

99
00:09:33,010 --> 00:09:35,370
Overall symptoms are nothing unusual.

100
00:09:35,978 --> 00:09:39,045
But during this time, the internal
organs will work a little harder.

101
00:09:40,218 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't work too hard.

102
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:43,664
Doctor,

103
00:09:44,176 --> 00:09:47,510
I think it's not normal.

104
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:48,901
Just like I said

105
00:09:49,813 --> 00:09:51,680
that the internal organs
are working a little harder

106
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,590
because there is
a baby in the womb

107
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:04,290
Huh... A baby?

108
00:10:28,768 --> 00:10:29,445
Khun Eeang Peung.

109
00:10:31,418 --> 00:10:32,200
Maey.

110
00:10:33,888 --> 00:10:35,480
What should I do?

111
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:37,790
What should I do?

112
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:39,514
Please calm down.

113
00:10:40,362 --> 00:10:41,960
You'll fall ill again.

114
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,300
I can't go on like this.

115
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:46,634
I'm pregnant...

116
00:10:47,578 --> 00:10:50,101
with that man's child.

117
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,184
I understand.

118
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,056
I understand.

119
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,680
But you have to stay calm.

120
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,940
Calmly think things out...

121
00:11:02,727 --> 00:11:04,334
Nothing can change.

122
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,426
I can't stand it

123
00:11:11,502 --> 00:11:13,817
to see his child grow up.

124
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,060
I can't accept that life.

125
00:11:20,860 --> 00:11:21,653
Khun Eeang Peung.

126
00:11:24,506 --> 00:11:26,573
Even though he's not in my life anymore

127
00:11:28,328 --> 00:11:30,520
but he has left me with pain and sorrow.

128
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:34,031
Why is it not over yet?

129
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:38,355
Why has my life come to this?

130
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,980
Everything will be ok.

131
00:12:00,840 --> 00:12:01,225
Fong Kaew.

132
00:12:01,380 --> 00:12:01,770
Mom!

133
00:12:03,012 --> 00:12:04,050
Khamsaen!

134
00:12:04,402 --> 00:12:05,700
What are you doing?

135
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,820
You scared the life out of me.

136
00:12:09,922 --> 00:12:14,056
I saw you drifting off

137
00:12:14,889 --> 00:12:16,216
so I has wanted to play a joke,

138
00:12:17,148 --> 00:12:18,969
so you'd pay attention to me.

139
00:12:28,414 --> 00:12:29,962
What's wrong?

140
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,461
Khun Eeang Peung is with child.

141
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:42,390
Who is the father?

142
00:12:43,487 --> 00:12:44,912
It is Robert.

143
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:55,783
Oh... How sad.

144
00:12:57,463 --> 00:13:01,200
She can't seem to escape that
foreigner husband of hers.

145
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,609
I don't know how else to help her.

146
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,343
When I see her sad

147
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:12,170
it makes me feel even worse
for the things I did to her.

148
00:13:16,404 --> 00:13:17,800
Fong Kaew...

149
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:22,480
You did the best you could do.

150
00:13:27,195 --> 00:13:28,700
I am actually happy

151
00:13:29,783 --> 00:13:32,263
that the foreigner didn't
do the same things to you.

152
00:13:37,708 --> 00:13:39,210
You're lucky

153
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,440
that you're still my Fong Kaew

154
00:13:51,778 --> 00:13:55,011
I'm not the same person
you once knew anymore.

155
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,235
I am not...

156
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,809
Ever since the first night
we met at this house.

157
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:14,847
Fong Kaew..

158
00:14:22,715 --> 00:14:23,604
Khamsaen...

159
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:29,232
You should love someone

160
00:14:29,298 --> 00:14:30,390
who is better than me.

161
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:32,620
In this life...

162
00:14:34,089 --> 00:14:37,440
I don't think I can be the same
Fong Kaew for you anymore.

163
00:14:55,849 --> 00:14:56,635
Fong Kaew, don't go.

164
00:15:30,701 --> 00:15:33,388
Is this is picture you told me about?

165
00:15:34,748 --> 00:15:35,171
Yes.

166
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,574
Before this, I drew these pictures

167
00:15:39,689 --> 00:15:43,317
there was a vision that overlaped
with the era that I came from.

168
00:15:46,814 --> 00:15:47,957
If so, it shows that

169
00:15:50,305 --> 00:15:51,821
your sleepwalking condition is...

170
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:53,000
Yes.

171
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:59,610
It was when the I saw those visions.

172
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,442
And how did you know

173
00:16:03,854 --> 00:16:05,096
that you had to draw these pictures?

174
00:16:06,969 --> 00:16:10,890
I've seen it before.

175
00:16:12,178 --> 00:16:13,336
Where did you see it?

176
00:16:14,922 --> 00:16:15,628
These pictures were

177
00:16:18,823 --> 00:16:22,188
in one of the old chests
in the House of Palathip

178
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,340
in the time that I came from

179
00:16:28,110 --> 00:16:29,140
and I think that

180
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:35,557
the person who probably
kept these pictures in that trunk

181
00:16:41,157 --> 00:16:42,112
was you.

182
00:17:01,929 --> 00:17:02,983
Hope.

183
00:17:07,025 --> 00:17:09,130
Did you miss me?

184
00:17:10,974 --> 00:17:13,891
You've gotten fat!

185
00:17:14,103 --> 00:17:14,330
Hmm?

186
00:17:17,797 --> 00:17:19,460
You didn't miss me?

187
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,004
Huh?

188
00:17:20,690 --> 00:17:23,444
Chubby like a pig.

189
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:31,330
You didn't tell me that you had kids!

190
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:32,900
You never tell me anything anymore.

191
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:38,897
Oh!

192
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:40,470
Jom.

193
00:17:44,154 --> 00:17:44,637
Khun Yai.

194
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:49,830
Jom.

195
00:17:52,434 --> 00:17:54,300
Why don't you try drawing Hope again?

196
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:01,945
It's not useful, sir.

197
00:18:03,925 --> 00:18:04,948
Because before

198
00:18:06,202 --> 00:18:08,280
I tried drawing the house again.

199
00:18:12,285 --> 00:18:12,740
Jom.

200
00:18:13,042 --> 00:18:14,090
What is wrong?

201
00:18:14,745 --> 00:18:17,987
But... no vision came up at all.

202
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:22,900
But trying again won't do any harm, Jom.

203
00:18:28,446 --> 00:18:29,275
And what if...

204
00:18:31,995 --> 00:18:37,880
drawing this time will make
me completely disappear.

205
00:18:50,178 --> 00:18:53,876
I don't know what will happen

206
00:19:00,732 --> 00:19:01,920
but I have no way

207
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,230
to really help you.

208
00:19:10,313 --> 00:19:16,010
I'm also confused about
what's going on here.

209
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:22,050
Part of me wants
you to stay with me.

210
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:27,940
But if I stay silent

211
00:19:29,816 --> 00:19:30,649
I have no clue

212
00:19:33,877 --> 00:19:35,543
when your faint shadow

213
00:19:39,703 --> 00:19:40,820
will make you...

214
00:19:44,277 --> 00:19:45,950
disappear forever?

215
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:49,957
So I thought

216
00:19:52,545 --> 00:19:54,131
I should let you disappear

217
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,564
to return to the place you came from

218
00:20:01,708 --> 00:20:04,922
it would be better than
letting you disappear right before my eyes.

219
00:20:07,689 --> 00:20:08,663
Because I can't...

220
00:20:09,501 --> 00:20:11,150
remember anything about you again

221
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,049
and I won't let it be that way.

222
00:20:27,402 --> 00:20:28,183
Are you afraid?

223
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:40,178
It's ok,

224
00:20:43,487 --> 00:20:44,588
not matter what happens

225
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:49,727
I will sit beside you here

226
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,414
don't fret.

00:21:03,628 --> 00:21:09,260

Jom.

247
00:23:08,404 --> 00:23:09,115
It's ok.

248
00:23:10,303 --> 00:23:12,530
We can try.

249
00:23:13,153 --> 00:23:13,962
I don't think we should.

250
00:23:14,825 --> 00:23:15,469
I think we should stop.

251
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:17,852
Even if we try

252
00:23:18,471 --> 00:23:20,220
the person in that portrait is you.

253
00:23:28,774 --> 00:23:30,564
What about the chest you told me about?

254
00:23:32,909 --> 00:23:35,861
Are there any pictures
that you haven't drawn yet?

255
00:23:44,812 --> 00:23:45,562
There is one picture.

256
00:23:47,595 --> 00:23:48,492
What's the picture?

257
00:23:49,112 --> 00:23:54,560
Er... it's a picture of a man.

258
00:23:56,036 --> 00:23:57,316
But I don't know who he is.

259
00:23:59,644 --> 00:24:01,204
Standing under the tree

260
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:07,364
and then there was... I
can't remember what it was.

261
00:24:07,370 --> 00:24:08,097
Jom, Jom.

262
00:24:08,102 --> 00:24:08,880
Jom, Jom.

263
00:24:11,715 --> 00:24:13,688
That's enough for today.

264
00:24:15,404 --> 00:24:18,330
I have a picture that I want you

265
00:24:18,355 --> 00:24:19,490
to draw for me, please.

266
00:24:24,377 --> 00:24:25,204
What's the picture?

267
00:24:45,911 --> 00:24:49,146
Huh. Khun Yai, don't move.

268
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:50,893
The picture won't come out pretty.

269
00:24:51,968 --> 00:24:53,164
Well, I'm itchy.

270
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,920
I thought it would be like this.

271
00:24:56,031 --> 00:24:58,168
You have to be patient, you know?

272
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,391
Ok, my talented artist.

273
00:25:04,804 --> 00:25:06,930
But why suddenly

274
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:10,688
did you want a portrait of yourself?

275
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:13,413
The picture that you
secretly drew of me before this

276
00:25:14,315 --> 00:25:15,822
was a picture of when I...

277
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,395
was drunk.

278
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:22,755
If someone sees that picture,

279
00:25:24,088 --> 00:25:25,257
it wouldn't look good.

280
00:25:27,448 --> 00:25:28,368
But Khun Yai

281
00:25:29,168 --> 00:25:30,764
I'm going to tell you something

282
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,497
Even if it's this picture.

283
00:25:33,328 --> 00:25:34,600
I can't let other people see it anyway.

284
00:25:36,942 --> 00:25:37,560
Why?

285
00:25:38,893 --> 00:25:41,297
Do I still look bad?

286
00:25:42,982 --> 00:25:44,340
It's because in this picture

287
00:25:44,382 --> 00:25:46,390
you're topless.

288
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:49,360
Therefore, I won't let other people see it.

289
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:49,760
Hm?

290
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:56,746
Are you jealous of me?

291
00:26:00,724 --> 00:26:00,940
Yes.

292
00:26:01,675 --> 00:26:02,420
Wow.

293
00:26:03,933 --> 00:26:07,220
Now dare to admit your own feelings

294
00:26:07,220 --> 00:26:08,852
towards me.

295
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:10,460
So it's not good?

296
00:26:27,906 --> 00:26:31,753
Khun Yai, why are you
staring at me like that?

297
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:37,172
You stared at me while drawing this

298
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:41,620
so I wanted to remember you

299
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:43,730
with my own two eyes.

300
00:26:55,550 --> 00:26:57,360
Oh! Khun Yai!

301
00:26:57,892 --> 00:26:58,309
What?

302
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,100
What are you doing? Sit.

303
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:04,150
I can't keep on drawing.

304
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,583
I thought you wanted a portrait?

305
00:27:06,033 --> 00:27:07,406
I don't want a portrait anymore.

306
00:27:08,430 --> 00:27:09,543
Khun Yai, what are you doing?

307
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:11,156
Khun Yai.

308
00:27:11,637 --> 00:27:15,670
Khun Yai, oh! Khun Yai!

309
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:17,670
That tickles!

310
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,430
Don't squirm!

311
00:27:18,430 --> 00:27:19,077
Jom.

312
00:27:19,350 --> 00:27:20,067
Khun Yai.

313
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:28,130
Khun Eeang Peung.

314
00:27:29,541 --> 00:27:30,623
How are you?

315
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:37,360
I'm slowly feeling better.

316
00:27:38,589 --> 00:27:41,208
I meant your heart.

317
00:27:45,949 --> 00:27:48,202
It's not doing well.

318
00:27:50,576 --> 00:27:52,560
I can't imagine

319
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:56,180
that when this child comes

320
00:27:58,214 --> 00:28:00,320
how I'm supposed to feel about it.

321
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,802
But it has happened

322
00:28:07,473 --> 00:28:09,280
we have to accept it.

323
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:16,470
Even if we don't want to.

324
00:28:20,581 --> 00:28:21,637
Khun Eeang Peung.

325
00:28:24,374 --> 00:28:26,210
You don't have to worry about me.

326
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:29,326
I've been through so many things

327
00:28:30,850 --> 00:28:34,694
and I will get through this too.

328
00:28:38,046 --> 00:28:39,764
Don't give up

329
00:28:40,938 --> 00:28:42,787
and think that you don't have a choice.

330
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:47,844
Do I have that luxury?

331
00:28:51,587 --> 00:28:53,347
It might sound bad

332
00:28:54,795 --> 00:28:58,160
but I know a herbal doctor

333
00:28:59,355 --> 00:29:01,200
that might be able to help you

334
00:29:01,730 --> 00:29:03,162
to move past this terrible thing.

335
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:09,423
I don't want to see you stuck

336
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,410
with something from the past.

337
00:29:12,623 --> 00:29:14,540
I want to see you

338
00:29:15,510 --> 00:29:17,578
build new hope for your life

339
00:29:18,871 --> 00:29:21,140
with the person you love.

340
00:29:29,254 --> 00:29:33,170
Fong Kaew, what would
you do in this situation?

341
00:29:56,140 --> 00:29:57,385
Leave it.

342
00:29:58,311 --> 00:29:59,671
I don't want to drink it.

343
00:30:29,734 --> 00:30:30,240
Maey.

344
00:30:32,261 --> 00:30:33,820
There' something I need to tell you.

345
00:30:37,402 --> 00:30:39,258
I not here to ask for advice

346
00:30:40,644 --> 00:30:42,000
but I want to tell you

347
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:45,090
because you're my love.

348
00:30:47,578 --> 00:30:48,400
What is it Khun Eeang Peung?

349
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:53,460
I going to take you to Phranakorn.

350
00:30:55,764 --> 00:30:58,460
We're going to start our lives over there.

351
00:30:59,945 --> 00:31:00,880
What do you think?

352
00:31:04,724 --> 00:31:05,671
I won't go against you

353
00:31:06,193 --> 00:31:07,183
if that's the case.

354
00:31:08,926 --> 00:31:10,440
No matter where you go

355
00:31:11,713 --> 00:31:13,528
I am happy to follow you everywhere.

356
00:31:18,690 --> 00:31:19,692
But before we go...

357
00:31:20,736 --> 00:31:23,137
I must come to terms with my sorrows.

358
00:31:23,142 --> 00:31:24,177
Let it end first.

359
00:31:25,765 --> 00:31:26,625
What is the matter?

360
00:31:28,668 --> 00:31:30,840
I have to go find Fong Kaew's acquaintance.

361
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:38,905
They are a medicinal doctor
who can help with my suffering

362
00:31:40,522 --> 00:31:42,228
and make it go away.

363
00:31:45,482 --> 00:31:47,645
Don't tell me that you will...

364
00:31:51,408 --> 00:31:53,005
I can't accept it.

365
00:31:53,928 --> 00:31:55,365
But I've made up my mind.

366
00:31:57,514 --> 00:31:59,985
I don't want you to be contaminated

367
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:02,585
like the foreigner.

368
00:32:03,434 --> 00:32:05,048
You have encountered enough misfortune.

369
00:32:07,017 --> 00:32:08,237
Don't create bad karma again.

370
00:32:10,057 --> 00:32:11,425
Do you remember what I told you?

371
00:32:12,520 --> 00:32:14,440
That I didn't come to ask for advice

372
00:32:15,634 --> 00:32:17,337
I've just come to tell you.

373
00:32:19,274 --> 00:32:19,640
But...

374
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,660
Do you really want to
see me suffering like this?

375
00:32:27,802 --> 00:32:29,348
I just want to be with you

376
00:32:31,094 --> 00:32:32,860
to move past that day

377
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:39,960
and we can start our lives over.

378
00:33:11,951 --> 00:33:13,130
What are you reading?

379
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,785
I'm looking for some information.

380
00:33:18,451 --> 00:33:19,402
What information?

381
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:22,962
It's information that I don't know

382
00:33:23,900 --> 00:33:25,871
about what you're going through.

383
00:33:39,508 --> 00:33:40,020
Jom.

384
00:33:46,011 --> 00:33:46,974
Don't worry.

385
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:51,185
I just looked it up.

386
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,820
Just in case there is a way to fix it.

387
00:33:58,822 --> 00:34:01,380
Oh, that's... Jom

388
00:34:02,838 --> 00:34:04,175
I'm starting to get hungry.

389
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:07,036
Could you prepare some snacks

390
00:34:07,523 --> 00:34:09,447
and bring it to me by the river?

391
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:32,250
Snacks, Khun Yai.

392
00:34:58,990 --> 00:34:59,580
Khun Yai.

393
00:35:00,773 --> 00:35:01,750
Yes, Jom?

394
00:35:08,796 --> 00:35:09,771
What are you reading?

395
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:12,700
I've seen a western novel

396
00:35:14,628 --> 00:35:19,081
that talks about going back in time.

397
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,786
The title is The Time Machine.

398
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,630
I think it's by H.G. Wells.

399
00:35:28,617 --> 00:35:29,329
But I think...

400
00:35:30,773 --> 00:35:34,072
you won't find anything.

401
00:35:36,106 --> 00:35:39,090
Please let me try.

402
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,260
You're not from around here,

403
00:35:54,925 --> 00:35:55,428
right?

404
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:00,937
Khun Yai.

405
00:36:03,607 --> 00:36:07,840
Tomorrow, you take me to see

406
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,912
and meet Kruba?

407
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,790
Why do you want to go?

408
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,805
I just realized that

409
00:36:22,899 --> 00:36:25,280
when I met Kruba for the first time

410
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:27,512
He spoke about how I
wasn't from this place.

411
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:29,690
So I thought that maybe...

412
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:33,009
Kruba might have an answer for this.

413
00:36:42,723 --> 00:36:43,440
Are you ready?

414
00:36:48,411 --> 00:36:49,352
Let's go meet Kruba.

415
00:37:02,419 --> 00:37:03,954
How are you? What brings you here.

416
00:37:05,264 --> 00:37:09,325
I have a problem and
would like to consult with you.

417
00:37:10,255 --> 00:37:12,285
How is your father?

418
00:37:13,744 --> 00:37:17,280
I rarely see my father.

419
00:37:18,659 --> 00:37:21,203
Maybe it's because I
moved to a small house.

420
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,649
As for my father, after that incident...

421
00:37:28,190 --> 00:37:29,230
he mostly kept to himself

422
00:37:29,832 --> 00:37:31,960
and won't really talk to
anymore like before.

423
00:37:33,504 --> 00:37:36,900
The test of time and winds of change

424
00:37:37,410 --> 00:37:38,780
if one tries to block it

425
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,005
they would only go tumbling down.

426
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,960
It's about this man

427
00:37:44,891 --> 00:37:46,518
that you need help about?

428
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:49,885
Yes.

429
00:37:51,820 --> 00:37:53,462
Do you remember

430
00:37:55,051 --> 00:37:58,220
that you once said he wasn't from here?

431
00:38:01,756 --> 00:38:02,815
Of course I do.

432
00:38:04,167 --> 00:38:05,428
How did you know that?

433
00:38:13,257 --> 00:38:14,990
It's all in the eyes.

434
00:38:15,923 --> 00:38:19,400
Those eyes aren't from someone around here.

435
00:38:20,053 --> 00:38:21,352
If you know that

436
00:38:23,760 --> 00:38:25,714
do you have a way to help

437
00:38:26,163 --> 00:38:29,017
make Jom's body

438
00:38:29,165 --> 00:38:30,240
to return to normal?

439
00:38:31,489 --> 00:38:33,333
I already answered that question.

440
00:38:34,495 --> 00:38:37,222
The test of time and winds of change

441
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:39,653
if one tries to block it

442
00:38:40,156 --> 00:38:43,020
they would only go tumbling down.

443
00:38:45,725 --> 00:38:52,864
So does that mean that I
will disappear over time?

444
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:57,090
There's no answer to that.

445
00:38:57,942 --> 00:39:00,970
But the answer will show itself

446
00:39:01,352 --> 00:39:03,500
when our time comes.

447
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,220
So...

448
00:39:08,057 --> 00:39:11,370
Where do you think Jom will go?

449
00:39:13,706 --> 00:39:16,906
He's going to be where you want him to be.

450
00:40:07,146 --> 00:40:08,361
My love, my Jom.

451
00:40:17,512 --> 00:40:18,777
What's the matter?

452
00:40:26,510 --> 00:40:28,944
I don't want you to leave me.

453
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:35,588
I try to find answers

454
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,516
to what is happening

455
00:40:41,904 --> 00:40:43,131
but I am a fool.

456
00:40:45,222 --> 00:40:46,674
I'm such a fool

457
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:51,645
that can not foresee what will happen.

458
00:40:51,961 --> 00:40:52,400
Khun Yai.

459
00:41:04,251 --> 00:41:05,188
Don't say that.

460
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,434
I'm not going anywhere.

461
00:41:09,817 --> 00:41:11,161
I'm still here.

462
00:41:14,285 --> 00:41:16,281
I still here, right in front of you.

463
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,600
But how long will it be like that?

464
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:27,672
I don't know.

465
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:34,457
But I just...

466
00:41:37,607 --> 00:41:39,386
don't want to see you be like this anymore.

467
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:42,742
Jom.

468
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:50,209
Let's enjoy the time we have left together.

469
00:41:52,053 --> 00:41:52,770
Please?

470
00:41:57,459 --> 00:41:58,548
I'll try.

471
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,530
Argh...

472
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:26,640
I'm so tired.

473
00:42:26,933 --> 00:42:28,605
What are you complaining about Ming?

474
00:42:29,398 --> 00:42:31,325
It's really draining.

475
00:42:31,878 --> 00:42:33,398
Auysuya!

476
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,207
Just asking the master to leave

477
00:42:37,569 --> 00:42:38,914
but never thinking of
finding a replacement.

478
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:41,912
I can't even farm.

479
00:42:42,274 --> 00:42:44,156
But you've been doing if for a while.

480
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,250
Why do you still think you can't?

481
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:53,066
I can, but it's so tiring.

482
00:43:01,733 --> 00:43:04,550
Are you giving this to me?

483
00:43:04,998 --> 00:43:07,767
Yeah, I made it just for you

484
00:43:08,796 --> 00:43:10,360
so you'd have the strength to work

485
00:43:10,819 --> 00:43:13,970
but I didn't make it for
you to get stupid drunk!

486
00:43:14,476 --> 00:43:16,514
Just take a sip or two!

487
00:43:17,611 --> 00:43:18,011
Mom!

488
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:25,912
Oh! Why are you hugging me!

489
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:28,742
What are you looking at? Get back to work!

490
00:43:32,636 --> 00:43:33,870
What is it?

491
00:43:34,674 --> 00:43:35,828
It's Khun Eeang Peung.

492
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:37,428
What about her?

493
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:39,154
Listen to me.

494
00:43:39,935 --> 00:43:41,310
She's leaving us.

495
00:43:41,565 --> 00:43:41,988
Huh?!

496
00:43:43,097 --> 00:43:44,300
What are you going on about?

497
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:45,721
Explain.

498
00:43:45,870 --> 00:43:47,020
Listen to me.

499
00:43:49,097 --> 00:43:52,960
Khun Eeang Peung and
Maey are moving to Phranakorn

500
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:53,680
very soon.

501
00:43:55,740 --> 00:43:56,388
Maey.

502
00:43:59,695 --> 00:44:04,310
What's the matter?

503
00:44:05,295 --> 00:44:06,190
What?

504
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:11,725
Ming.

505
00:44:15,005 --> 00:44:18,487
I need your help with something.

506
00:44:23,820 --> 00:44:24,100
Ming.

507
00:44:25,771 --> 00:44:26,491
What?

508
00:44:28,674 --> 00:44:29,443
It's an invitation letter.

509
00:44:31,070 --> 00:44:36,090
I'd like to ask you to help me get these letters

510
00:44:36,182 --> 00:44:39,090
to the person to whom I
addressed on the envelope.

511
00:44:40,605 --> 00:44:42,849
What is the invitation letter?

512
00:44:43,203 --> 00:44:45,240
Why is there a servant's name like me?

513
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:51,382
Maey's name, Fong Kaew's name,
also includes Khamsaen.

514
00:44:53,032 --> 00:44:56,681
It's not any serious party.

515
00:44:58,129 --> 00:45:00,148
Well, I had a conversation with Khun Yai
that I wanted to...

516
00:45:00,784 --> 00:45:03,851
invite everyone to eat and drink together.

517
00:45:05,512 --> 00:45:11,771
Because soon I have to go.

518
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,047
Go? Where

519
00:45:15,348 --> 00:45:16,380
Dammit, where are you going?

520
00:45:18,156 --> 00:45:21,756
I'm going back to where I came from.

521
00:45:23,638 --> 00:45:25,234
Do you remember everything now?

522
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:27,840
Something like that.

523
00:45:30,876 --> 00:45:34,811
And where is the place
you're going back to, Jom?

524
00:45:35,291 --> 00:45:36,182
In case any day there is a chance

525
00:45:36,373 --> 00:45:38,034
I'll be able to visit and say hello.

526
00:45:44,076 --> 00:45:50,057
Well, where I come from is very far away.

527
00:45:50,990 --> 00:45:54,464
So far that I don't know after I've gone.

528
00:45:56,700 --> 00:45:58,152
Will I be able to meet everyone again?

529
00:45:59,775 --> 00:46:00,354
Jom...

530
00:46:06,891 --> 00:46:09,619
Don't make that face.

531
00:46:10,994 --> 00:46:12,678
I'm still here.

532
00:46:14,285 --> 00:46:16,963
And besides, you told me

533
00:46:17,798 --> 00:46:21,170
If there is an opportunity,
you would like me

534
00:46:23,104 --> 00:46:24,560
to go back from where I came from.

535
00:46:25,603 --> 00:46:28,994
Yes, I said that to you.

536
00:46:29,512 --> 00:46:33,565
But that time was
when the house was not yet what it was.

537
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:37,973
Today I heard two goodbyes.

538
00:46:39,291 --> 00:46:42,340
The first time was about Maey.

539
00:46:44,087 --> 00:46:48,335
The second time is you.

540
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,746
But I think someday

541
00:47:04,285 --> 00:47:05,238
we will meet again.

542
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:18,430
Um.

543
00:47:28,986 --> 00:47:29,527
Sure.

544
00:48:04,739 --> 00:48:05,798
Everyone has arrived.

545
00:48:07,089 --> 00:48:08,057
I'm sorry, Khun Yai.

546
00:48:09,352 --> 00:48:13,234
Jom, you're not done dressing up.

547
00:48:35,330 --> 00:48:36,540
Let's go find them.

548
00:49:14,095 --> 00:49:15,603
I feel kind of heartbroken too, Auntie.

549
00:49:16,750 --> 00:49:20,201
Now everyone is going their separate ways.

550
00:49:21,775 --> 00:49:23,790
Don't think too much Ming.

551
00:49:24,815 --> 00:49:27,798
At least everyone did what they wanted.

552
00:49:28,742 --> 00:49:30,440
You just have to be happy for them.

553
00:49:33,706 --> 00:49:34,540
That's true.

554
00:49:59,718 --> 00:50:00,255
Maey.

555
00:50:01,447 --> 00:50:02,320
What's wrong?

556
00:50:06,487 --> 00:50:08,803
I'm worried about Khun Eeang Peung.

557
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:13,184
Don't think too much Maey.

558
00:50:13,725 --> 00:50:16,582
Auntie Khamthip is with Khun Eeang Peung.

559
00:50:17,177 --> 00:50:17,942
Nothing is going to happen.

560
00:50:20,594 --> 00:50:21,516
I'll be right back.

561
00:50:27,610 --> 00:50:28,150
Fong Kaew.

562
00:50:34,022 --> 00:50:34,870
Khamsaen.

563
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:42,370
Don't ever leave me again.

564
00:50:49,946 --> 00:50:50,632
But I...

565
00:50:52,434 --> 00:50:52,990
I...

566
00:50:53,062 --> 00:50:53,600
I know...

567
00:50:55,352 --> 00:50:56,860
I know what you're going to say

568
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:00,689
but I don't care...

569
00:51:08,377 --> 00:51:15,653
Even though you think you've changed

570
00:51:19,413 --> 00:51:20,270
but to me

571
00:51:22,323 --> 00:51:25,300
you're still my Fong Kaew.

572
00:51:40,201 --> 00:51:42,940
Everyone! Jom and Khun Yai are coming down!

573
00:52:03,691 --> 00:52:05,226
Thank you everyone for...

574
00:52:07,485 --> 00:52:08,575
coming to this party.

575
00:52:11,295 --> 00:52:14,133
Actually, it is not a
special or grand event.

576
00:52:16,171 --> 00:52:17,430
But that I...

577
00:52:18,838 --> 00:52:21,222
I asked Khun Yai to help
organize this party because

578
00:52:22,533 --> 00:52:25,866
I have something I want to tell everyone.

579
00:52:27,283 --> 00:52:29,348
I want everyone to know that

580
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:42,796
soon I will have to return home.

581
00:52:46,929 --> 00:52:50,410
Only where I come from is...

582
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:55,889
very, very far.

583
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:01,000
So far away that I
don't know if when I leave,

584
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:03,460
I'll ever have a chance to come
back and see everyone again.

585
00:53:06,740 --> 00:53:08,262
Everyone here

586
00:53:09,687 --> 00:53:11,375
are the people I want to thank.

587
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:16,170
For all the things that happened

588
00:53:17,725 --> 00:53:20,041
all this time that I've been here.

589
00:53:23,169 --> 00:53:24,410
So I want this party

590
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:31,325
to be the last good memory
I'll have with everyone.

591
00:53:33,420 --> 00:53:35,767
And hope it will be a
good memory for everyone.

592
00:53:38,567 --> 00:53:40,948
Because it will definitely
be a good memory for me.

The back, squeeze in
a little more, can you?

641
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,389
Don't look so tense.

642
00:56:54,862 --> 00:56:56,198
Okay, I'm ready.

643
00:56:56,530 --> 00:56:57,961
Let's take a photo.

644
00:56:59,210 --> 00:57:00,696
Ok.

645
00:57:00,989 --> 00:57:01,582
Ready?

646
00:57:02,512 --> 00:57:03,463

648
00:57:09,016 --> 00:57:12,120
Oh... Mr.James.

649
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:14,830
Is there something wrong?

650
00:57:17,336 --> 00:57:21,336
Well, I'm afraid that the picture

651
00:57:22,444 --> 00:57:23,108
might...

652
00:57:27,478 --> 00:57:30,571
No problem, Mr. James.
Please take the photo.

653
00:57:36,607 --> 00:57:36,918
Ok.

654
00:57:38,903 --> 00:57:39,425
Ready?

655
00:57:39,685 --> 00:57:40,429
Look at the camera.

656
00:57:42,983 --> 00:57:43,600

657
00:57:44,278 --> 00:57:44,918

658

1

659
00:58:07,057 --> 00:58:08,328
What are you doing
standing there all alone?

660
00:58:11,312 --> 00:58:13,342
I'm smelling the scent
of the plumeria flowers.

661
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:14,690
Hm?

662
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:18,835
You didn't let me take
in your scent last night.

663
00:58:21,398 --> 00:58:22,687
You're being so over the top.

664
00:58:23,034 --> 00:58:25,990
I just want to sleep
in my room for a night.

665
00:58:26,669 --> 00:58:26,874
Hm?

666
00:58:32,029 --> 00:58:36,000
Just one night.

667
00:58:37,611 --> 00:58:40,071
I miss you very much.

668
00:58:46,640 --> 00:58:47,137
Jom.

669
00:58:48,032 --> 00:58:48,675
Hm?

670
00:58:49,540 --> 00:58:53,710
But going back to sleep in your room...

671
00:58:54,527 --> 00:58:55,786
What are you going to do?

672
00:59:00,936 --> 00:59:04,177
I...

673
00:59:11,454 --> 00:59:11,991
What?

674
00:59:15,614 --> 00:59:20,942
I'm just afraid I won't have the chance to

675
00:59:23,505 --> 00:59:25,466
go back to my original home.

676
00:59:28,097 --> 00:59:32,752
I wanted to write this down and record it.

677
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:36,610
And I would like to
leave it with you as well.

678
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:44,311
I would like to leave this letter.

679
00:59:46,426 --> 00:59:48,174
For you to keep

680
00:59:52,619 --> 00:59:54,065
and pass it down to your
family's next generation

681
00:59:56,702 --> 01:00:01,550
because I want my family to read it

682
01:00:04,232 --> 01:00:09,120
if I cannot return to them.

683
01:00:24,461 --> 01:00:25,138
I promise you.

684
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,390
I will cherish and look after this.

685
01:00:34,625 --> 01:00:35,196
Thank you.

686
01:00:45,020 --> 01:00:50,112
Will I have a chance to read this?

687
01:00:52,910 --> 01:00:53,381
Hmm?

688
01:00:54,247 --> 01:00:55,476
Do you want to read it?

689
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:58,054
Yes.

690
01:00:59,058 --> 01:00:59,832
I do.

691
01:01:07,025 --> 01:01:12,320
You have to read it when
I'm not here anymore.

692
01:01:14,330 --> 01:01:14,792
Why?

693
01:01:15,818 --> 01:01:19,660
It would be embarrassing.

694
01:01:21,261 --> 01:01:23,130
Ah, if you want to read it now...

695
01:01:24,138 --> 01:01:26,989
I will go upstairs.

696
01:01:46,243 --> 01:01:48,710
To my mother and Somjeed, it's Jom.

697
01:01:49,461 --> 01:01:51,010
The author of this letter.

698
01:01:51,010 --> 01:01:52,832
I'm in the most confusing time of my life

699
01:01:53,723 --> 01:01:56,083
because I don't know if I will ever
be able to go back to everyone again.

700
01:01:56,778 --> 01:01:59,350
And was afraid that if I really disappeared

701
01:02:00,116 --> 01:02:01,996
everyone will be upset if
they didn't know the news.

702
01:02:03,181 --> 01:02:04,363
What happened to me?

703
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:06,378
The story is almost unbelievable.

704
01:02:07,167 --> 01:02:09,050
I slipped back into the past

705
01:02:09,050 --> 01:02:11,600
and lived in the year 1928

706
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,790
before there was a change

707
01:02:14,790 --> 01:02:16,110
with the Siamese revolution of 1932.

708
01:02:17,295 --> 01:02:20,428
I came to live in an era
that I wasn't used to at first.

709
01:02:21,070 --> 01:02:23,433
It was very difficult for
me to adjust to being here.

710
01:02:23,924 --> 01:02:26,590
Before finding out that
this place has changed

711
01:02:27,667 --> 01:02:30,054
I met many people during this time.

712
01:02:31,009 --> 01:02:33,556
They helped and taught me a lot.

713
01:02:34,447 --> 01:02:37,217
Let me know the
existence of different lives

714
01:02:38,190 --> 01:02:41,468
and then we fought and helped each other

715
01:02:41,945 --> 01:02:44,867
until it became a home
that I didn't want to leave.

716
01:02:46,784 --> 01:02:48,270
I met a man

717
01:02:48,817 --> 01:02:50,428
the person I told you about, Somjeed.

718
01:02:51,154 --> 01:02:53,939
Do you remember when I
told you I dreamt of someone?

719
01:02:54,899 --> 01:02:58,020
He came to help me forget the pain

720
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,427
from the old love from Ohm

721
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:03,515
and became my lover

722
01:03:04,402 --> 01:03:08,825
that I... want to spend my life with him
forever to the end.

723
01:03:11,174 --> 01:03:13,496
Finally, I would like to say that...

724
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:17,824
I love you and mom very much

725
01:03:21,842 --> 01:03:26,012
even though I didn't have the chance
to say goodbye to everyone in person.

726
01:03:27,195 --> 01:03:30,235
May everyone be able
to move on with their lives.

727
01:03:31,401 --> 01:03:32,520
Even though I'm not in your life anymore.

728
01:03:33,755 --> 01:03:34,983
I'm still waiting

729
01:03:35,526 --> 01:03:37,530
to always be able to
see smiles from everyone.

730
01:03:40,086 --> 01:03:41,656
With love, Jom
