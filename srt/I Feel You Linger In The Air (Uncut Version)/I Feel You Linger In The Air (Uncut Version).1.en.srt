1
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:08,594
Jom.

2
00:00:13,769 --> 00:00:15,769
Jom.

3
00:02:50,663 --> 00:02:52,268
Wake up Khun Yai.

4
00:02:54,582 --> 00:02:57,235
I'll go get everything ready.

5
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:20,891
Jom.

6
00:03:28,617 --> 00:03:30,334
The sun hasn't risen yet.

7
00:03:32,656 --> 00:03:34,656
Just a little bit more sleep.

8
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:20,929
Jom!!!

(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 1)

10
00:08:56,523 --> 00:09:04,279
(Chiang Mai, 2023)

11
00:09:46,453 --> 00:09:47,776
Hello.

12
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:49,744
Hi.

13
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:54,201
Jom, why did you suddenly
change the design of that little house?

14
00:10:54,483 --> 00:11:01,353
The house that I redesigned, I just
think it makes the house look livelier.

15
00:11:02,198 --> 00:11:04,197
Do you think you can just
change anything as you please?

16
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:08,195
We already offered the first plan to
customers together, do you remember?

17
00:11:08,897 --> 00:11:11,405
If that's the case, Thanet,
you don't have to worry at all.

18
00:11:11,405 --> 00:11:14,025
Well, I've talked to customers
and they were ok with it.

19
00:11:15,131 --> 00:11:19,106
So you just went over my head?
You think that's ok?

20
00:11:22,767 --> 00:11:24,146
I'm sorry.

21
00:11:24,735 --> 00:11:28,392
I just saw that you didn't reply
to me, so I took it upon myself

22
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:32,072
to start and it's just that we
needed to start working on it.

23
00:11:32,846 --> 00:11:33,943
So...

24
00:11:33,943 --> 00:11:37,196
Don't talk like I'm in the wrong. If the
customer didn't exclusively choose you,

25
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:40,296
you wouldn't have the opportunity
to do a big project like this.

26
00:11:40,321 --> 00:11:42,981
If you're going to do anything
without telling me,

27
00:11:43,005 --> 00:11:45,664
you'll be in trouble cause I'm
not ok with people like this...

28
00:11:45,689 --> 00:11:46,560
Jom.

29
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:47,772
Yes.

30
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:50,000
Could you take a look upstairs?

31
00:11:51,612 --> 00:11:55,079
I gotta go, I need to get back to work.

32
00:11:56,061 --> 00:11:57,327
Let's go.

33
00:12:01,701 --> 00:12:03,080
Right here Mr. Jom.

34
00:12:03,105 --> 00:12:03,605
Yes.

35
00:12:08,608 --> 00:12:09,197
Oh.

36
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,605
Huh?

37
00:12:13,238 --> 00:12:15,294
When did it come here, Uncle Tan?

38
00:12:15,576 --> 00:12:16,886
I don't know Mr. Jom.

39
00:12:16,886 --> 00:12:19,091
Woaw came to work in here and saw it,

40
00:12:19,091 --> 00:12:21,689
so he called me to look
and I came to tell you this.

41
00:12:23,436 --> 00:12:25,436
Uh, Mr. Jom.

42
00:12:25,436 --> 00:12:27,405
Didn't Khun Ying leave the keys with you?

43
00:12:27,405 --> 00:12:30,868
Don't you want to try and open it?
To know what it is.

44
00:12:30,868 --> 00:12:32,612
Do you think that's a good idea?

45
00:12:32,612 --> 00:12:35,778
Of course, it'd be good,
Jom we're not going to steal.

46
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:37,840
I just want to know what's inside.

47
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:42,762
Sure.

48
00:13:08,181 --> 00:13:10,802
It's like you knew which exact key to use.

49
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:14,065
Oh... I'm just guessing, Uncle Tan.

50
00:13:14,065 --> 00:13:15,056
Really?

51
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:19,163
Let's see.

52
00:13:32,339 --> 00:13:33,549
Uhh.

53
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:40,159
Is this just a drawing?

54
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:43,350
I thought it would be something
more valuable than that.

55
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:47,991
Uncle Tan, it might be
valuable to his owner.

56
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:49,579
Otherwise, they wouldn't
have kept it in this chest.

57
00:13:49,579 --> 00:13:55,336
And look at the lines, looks like it's
not a typical old-style drawing either.

58
00:13:55,336 --> 00:13:57,981
So where would you like to keep this chest?

59
00:13:59,034 --> 00:14:00,752
Let's keep it in the storage room.

60
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:04,675
So when Khun Ying and her children come
back, they won't think it's gone missing.

61
00:14:10,476 --> 00:14:11,742
Quickly put it away.

62
00:14:12,008 --> 00:14:15,701
Help lift it up, it's going to break.

63
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:17,900
I'll be going now.

64
00:14:41,948 --> 00:14:44,343
(P' Ohm)

65
00:14:45,147 --> 00:14:46,244
That's so strange.

66
00:15:21,901 --> 00:15:23,167
What is this?

67
00:16:59,682 --> 00:17:01,682
Hoy!

68
00:17:25,571 --> 00:17:31,182
(Somjeed)

69
00:17:45,418 --> 00:17:49,732
Oh... such a sullen face, are
you disappointed it's Somjeed?

70
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:52,722
What's up?

71
00:17:52,747 --> 00:17:54,988
What disappointment?
You're imagining things.

72
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:59,236
Why? Hasn't he called yet?

73
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:02,282
Yeah.

74
00:18:02,724 --> 00:18:06,135
I warned you that he's weird.

75
00:18:06,135 --> 00:18:09,718
And look, you relocated
to work in his hometown.

76
00:18:09,718 --> 00:18:12,264
To wait for him to return, is it worth it?

77
00:18:12,264 --> 00:18:15,968
Ugh, you're complaining like mom.

78
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:20,919
Let me tell you something,
he's coming back in a few days!

79
00:18:23,371 --> 00:18:24,412
Yeah.

80
00:18:26,618 --> 00:18:29,464
So... how are things there?

81
00:18:31,037 --> 00:18:33,924
Well...

82
00:18:33,924 --> 00:18:34,965
good.

83
00:18:37,115 --> 00:18:38,212
What's wrong?

84
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,785
Honestly.

85
00:18:43,821 --> 00:18:48,981
Since I accepted the
latest renovation work,

86
00:18:50,758 --> 00:18:55,467
I felt like something
strange has happened to me.

87
00:18:58,528 --> 00:18:59,738
A strange thing?

88
00:18:59,738 --> 00:19:00,310
Um.

89
00:19:01,139 --> 00:19:07,996
I dreamed that I saw
myself with a man who

90
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:14,876
I've never met and we've
never met each other before.

91
00:19:15,379 --> 00:19:17,718
And another thing, this
house that is being renovated.

92
00:19:17,718 --> 00:19:20,073
I'm so familiar with it, I don't know why.

93
00:19:20,073 --> 00:19:24,380
Wait a minute, you're not
stressed or pressured by

94
00:19:24,404 --> 00:19:28,710
your boss that you're
doing their load of the work?

95
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,345
No.

96
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:33,372
Jom.

97
00:19:33,372 --> 00:19:33,872
Yeah.

98
00:19:33,872 --> 00:19:37,653
Does that the owner of
that house secretly like you?

99
00:19:38,274 --> 00:19:39,849
You're getting on my nerves.

100
00:19:41,551 --> 00:19:43,382
So what's wrong?

101
00:19:43,407 --> 00:19:45,387
A hundred days, thousands
of years, you never call.

102
00:19:46,505 --> 00:19:48,956
Can't I miss you?

103
00:19:49,334 --> 00:19:50,939
Liar.

104
00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:54,018
Well?

105
00:19:54,174 --> 00:19:55,749
Well...

106
00:20:01,469 --> 00:20:03,130
Jeed, just a sec.

107
00:20:07,608 --> 00:20:08,874
Uncle Tan is calling me.

108
00:20:09,664 --> 00:20:11,393
Let me pick it up, I think
it's some urgent work.

109
00:20:11,393 --> 00:20:12,290
Just a sec.

110
00:20:12,290 --> 00:20:14,399
It's ok, focus on your work.

111
00:20:14,399 --> 00:20:17,826
It's nothing, I'm going to
go find something to eat first.

112
00:20:19,452 --> 00:20:20,662
Ah... ok.

113
00:20:31,349 --> 00:20:32,446
Yes?

114
00:20:37,411 --> 00:20:38,677
What?

115
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:42,191
Ok, I'll go right away.

116
00:20:58,397 --> 00:20:59,720
Argh!

117
00:21:11,343 --> 00:21:13,343
What in the world?

118
00:21:16,297 --> 00:21:18,297
Come on, wipe it.

119
00:21:19,910 --> 00:21:21,176
Uncle Tan.

120
00:21:22,547 --> 00:21:23,757
When did you get here?

121
00:21:24,200 --> 00:21:25,805
I just got here.

122
00:21:26,002 --> 00:21:26,591
Huh?

123
00:21:27,613 --> 00:21:30,403
Did you not come last night?

124
00:21:32,007 --> 00:21:33,668
I didn't come.

125
00:21:33,887 --> 00:21:34,758
Why?

126
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,515
It's nothing, it must have been the wind.

127
00:21:39,722 --> 00:21:42,201
Last night, I heard you calling me.

128
00:21:42,896 --> 00:21:43,655
Huh?

129
00:21:44,192 --> 00:21:45,233
Oh, Mr. Jom.

130
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,571
Last night it rained heavily
and the wind was strong.

131
00:21:48,571 --> 00:21:50,881
The tree fell down and
hit the roof of the house.

132
00:21:50,881 --> 00:21:54,082
So the roof is leaking
and flooding the house.

133
00:21:54,345 --> 00:21:56,063
What do you want us to do?

134
00:21:58,262 --> 00:22:01,955
Could you help me order
tiles and wood to fix it quickly?

135
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,774
If my boss finds out,
working will be difficult.

136
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,990
If so, I will wait for the rain to
stop first and let the workers do it.

137
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,288
Ok.

138
00:22:10,288 --> 00:22:14,974
I think Mr. Thanet probably understands because
things like this are beyond our control.

139
00:22:15,812 --> 00:22:17,417
He doesn't understand, uncle.

140
00:22:17,615 --> 00:22:20,000
In any case, please help me.

141
00:22:20,516 --> 00:22:23,080
Yes, let me take a look upstairs first.

142
00:22:24,892 --> 00:22:27,343
Let's wipe it clean.

143
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,000
(Ohm: See you tonight, Jom.)

144
00:22:46,758 --> 00:22:50,789
(Jom: I left the key in the lobby.)

145
00:22:54,432 --> 00:22:56,037
Jom, Jom.

146
00:22:57,238 --> 00:22:59,238
Yes, I'll be right there.

147
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:02,321
Food has arrived.

148
00:24:02,499 --> 00:24:04,499
Wow... that was fast.

149
00:24:13,769 --> 00:24:14,415
Jom.

150
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:16,624
Yes?

151
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,380
Why does this have our name?

152
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:23,872
There.

153
00:24:29,373 --> 00:24:30,244
Do you like it?

154
00:24:31,507 --> 00:24:36,723
Well... I do, it's very pretty.

155
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:43,440
I'm telling you this is
going to be our home.

156
00:24:47,641 --> 00:24:49,077
Ours?

157
00:24:49,077 --> 00:24:49,588
Yes.

158
00:24:51,253 --> 00:24:59,630
I just want a house for
the both of us to live in.

159
00:25:10,451 --> 00:25:11,548
Jom.

160
00:25:15,879 --> 00:25:22,224
I don't know if my head
is too far in the clouds,

161
00:25:22,249 --> 00:25:23,377
But...

162
00:25:26,078 --> 00:25:31,351
I want to design our house
with my own two hands.

163
00:25:33,046 --> 00:25:38,827
So that in our future,

164
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:45,240
we can finally be a real family.

165
00:25:58,177 --> 00:25:59,105
Jom.

166
00:26:02,157 --> 00:26:04,157
Can you wait for me?

167
00:26:05,073 --> 00:26:08,371
After I graduate,

168
00:26:09,722 --> 00:26:13,358
we'll make this dream come true together.

169
00:26:14,546 --> 00:26:15,417
Ok?

170
00:26:29,344 --> 00:26:30,723
Please?

171
00:26:31,945 --> 00:26:32,647
Please?

172
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:38,096
Sure.

173
00:26:39,147 --> 00:26:40,526
Thank you.

174
00:26:43,292 --> 00:26:45,856
I'm going to miss you
so much when I'm there.

175
00:26:45,856 --> 00:26:48,914
I'll also miss you so badly.

176
00:26:48,914 --> 00:26:51,563
Who will I kiss when I'm there.

177
00:26:52,056 --> 00:26:54,056
Don't let me catch you
kissing someone else.

178
00:26:54,056 --> 00:26:54,787
Of course not!

179
00:26:54,787 --> 00:26:56,426
I'll fly over to see you.

180
00:27:02,179 --> 00:27:05,082
When you come back, don't forget.

181
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:07,396
I won't forget, how can I forget?

182
00:27:09,489 --> 00:27:13,464
But where will our room be?

183
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:14,899
There?

184
00:27:15,203 --> 00:27:17,711
This is fine, we will
be able to see the view.

185
00:27:17,964 --> 00:27:23,463
Or it can be right here if
you like a narrow place.

186
00:27:25,074 --> 00:27:26,905
No.

187
00:27:45,248 --> 00:27:46,232
Ohm.

188
00:27:58,294 --> 00:27:59,560
Jom.

189
00:28:02,172 --> 00:28:05,639
I missed you so much.

190
00:28:09,768 --> 00:28:13,348
I also missed you.

191
00:28:14,582 --> 00:28:15,961
Ohm!

192
00:28:16,214 --> 00:28:19,681
So why didn't you answer
my message for days?

193
00:28:20,001 --> 00:28:24,427
I didn't dare double text because I was
afraid that you'd be busy with moving back.

194
00:28:24,641 --> 00:28:25,456
Hmm.

195
00:28:27,238 --> 00:28:28,674
Umm... I...

196
00:28:30,273 --> 00:28:31,427
I'm sorry.

197
00:28:33,282 --> 00:28:37,031
It's okay, just having you here,

198
00:28:37,808 --> 00:28:39,526
makes me very happy.

199
00:29:53,795 --> 00:29:55,174
Ohm.

200
00:29:56,543 --> 00:29:57,922
Is something wrong?

201
00:30:03,181 --> 00:30:04,052
Wait, Jom.

202
00:30:09,469 --> 00:30:11,469
I have something I need to tell you.

203
00:30:12,595 --> 00:30:13,636
It's that...

204
00:30:16,493 --> 00:30:17,816
I'm getting married.

205
00:30:24,099 --> 00:30:27,340
What do you mean?

206
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:27,925
Jom,

207
00:30:30,304 --> 00:30:32,022
listen to me.

208
00:30:33,801 --> 00:30:35,180
It's just that...

209
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:42,629
I've met that person ever
since I went to study in the UK,

210
00:30:44,028 --> 00:30:46,028
after a while, things got serious.

211
00:30:52,157 --> 00:30:53,593
Ohm...

212
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,168
What are you talking about?

213
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:58,664
Jom.

214
00:30:59,713 --> 00:31:01,600
Do you know that...

215
00:31:02,707 --> 00:31:04,707
when we're there and we don't know anyone,

216
00:31:05,743 --> 00:31:07,743
how it feels,

217
00:31:09,767 --> 00:31:12,839
and that person came into
my life when I needed someone.

218
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,725
But it's like we've known
each other for a long time.

219
00:31:21,952 --> 00:31:23,388
And...

220
00:31:25,609 --> 00:31:27,200
it's turned into love,

221
00:31:29,375 --> 00:31:31,375
without me realising it.

222
00:31:36,613 --> 00:31:37,936
Love?

223
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,114
What about me?

224
00:31:46,698 --> 00:31:48,190
You don't love me anymore?

225
00:31:49,663 --> 00:31:51,663
I still feel the same about you.

226
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,145
But...

227
00:31:56,919 --> 00:31:58,355
What did I do wrong?

228
00:31:58,355 --> 00:32:00,412
No, it's not your fault at all.

229
00:32:00,825 --> 00:32:01,922
I'm...

230
00:32:03,349 --> 00:32:04,672
I'm sorry.

231
00:32:05,788 --> 00:32:07,788
I didn't want things to
turn out this way either.

232
00:32:14,537 --> 00:32:16,537
What did I do wrong?

233
00:32:20,906 --> 00:32:22,906
Jom, I'm sorry.

234
00:32:26,086 --> 00:32:31,359
I hope you meet someone better than me.

235
00:32:44,401 --> 00:32:45,724
Ohm.

236
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,550
Ohm!!

237
00:33:07,794 --> 00:33:09,794
Ohm! Ohm!

238
00:33:11,722 --> 00:33:14,625
Let's talk together first, don't go.

239
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:15,918
Let's talk about it first.

240
00:33:15,918 --> 00:33:16,844
Let go of me, Jom.

241
00:33:16,844 --> 00:33:19,172
Let's talk about it first.
Otherwise, I won't let go.

242
00:33:19,743 --> 00:33:20,445
Jom!

243
00:33:20,956 --> 00:33:22,320
Ohm.

244
00:33:24,597 --> 00:33:26,202
Jom!!

245
00:33:38,461 --> 00:33:40,461
I think you should cool
off and calm down first.

246
00:33:41,650 --> 00:33:43,199
Then we'll talk again.

247
00:33:47,208 --> 00:33:49,208
How can I calm down?

248
00:33:59,293 --> 00:34:00,334
Don't you think...

249
00:34:03,753 --> 00:34:05,753
that I wasn't lonely?

250
00:34:11,524 --> 00:34:12,960
2 years.

251
00:34:14,855 --> 00:34:16,855
2 years!!

252
00:34:21,116 --> 00:34:23,116
2 years, I waited for you.

253
00:34:26,122 --> 00:34:28,122
I was able to wait.

254
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:35,115
We made a promise, didn't we?

255
00:34:39,557 --> 00:34:41,557
So why can't you keep it?

256
00:34:42,118 --> 00:34:44,400
Why was I able to?

257
00:34:48,774 --> 00:34:50,379
What did I do wrong?

258
00:34:52,218 --> 00:34:53,936
Tell me.

259
00:34:56,678 --> 00:34:58,452
What did I do wrong?

260
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:00,421
Ohm.

261
00:35:13,961 --> 00:35:15,961
This is what I was going to tell you.

262
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,343
I'm sorry Jom,

263
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,640
but I have to go.

264
00:36:11,733 --> 00:36:13,733
I told you not to smoke.

265
00:37:47,096 --> 00:37:49,096
How could you do this to me.

266
00:38:43,481 --> 00:38:46,045
Oh, sorry.

267
00:38:46,721 --> 00:38:48,721
Can I dance with you tonight?

268
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:52,860
Sure.

269
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:01,000
Careful.

270
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:06,123
Thank you, it's ok.

271
00:39:18,203 --> 00:39:19,244
Jom.

272
00:39:25,115 --> 00:39:27,115
I have something I need to tell you.

273
00:39:28,050 --> 00:39:30,050
I love you.

274
00:39:37,314 --> 00:39:38,524
Ohm.

275
00:39:40,001 --> 00:39:41,380
Do you hear me?

276
00:39:42,605 --> 00:39:43,871
I love you.

277
00:39:48,115 --> 00:39:49,494
Ohm.

278
00:39:53,955 --> 00:39:55,955
I also love you, Ohm.

279
00:40:00,001 --> 00:40:02,001
Ohm.

280
00:40:11,755 --> 00:40:12,739
Hey!

281
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,752
Dammit!

282
00:41:42,472 --> 00:41:44,472
My car!!

283
00:41:45,717 --> 00:41:47,120
It's all because of you.

284
00:41:50,041 --> 00:41:51,360
I'm going to tell the police.

285
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:52,695
No police is going to believe you.

286
00:41:52,875 --> 00:41:54,875
A man getting raped.

287
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:58,034
And in the club, everybody
will think that you wanted this.

288
00:44:24,398 --> 00:44:30,000
So this is how it feels to die.

289
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:34,660
Even though all the things I've
encountered were so dreadful.

290
00:44:35,962 --> 00:44:42,646
But who would have thought that life
would really come to an end.

291
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,640
It's so fast and it's not pretty at all.

292
00:44:50,123 --> 00:44:54,154
But if this is an ending
to a new beginning,

293
00:44:55,051 --> 00:45:03,145
I prayed for life after my
death to be a better journey.

294
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:06,448
I'm ready.

295
00:47:48,461 --> 00:47:49,276
Hey!

296
00:47:57,657 --> 00:47:58,923
Aren't you dead yet?

297
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,503
Who are you, where did you come from?

298
00:48:05,912 --> 00:48:07,912
Why won't you answer?

299
00:48:07,912 --> 00:48:09,011
Who are you?

300
00:48:13,016 --> 00:48:18,402
Or are you a criminal who
came to hurt the foreign master?

301
00:48:21,008 --> 00:48:21,936
Right?

302
00:48:22,514 --> 00:48:24,720
Who are you? Who are you?

303
00:48:24,720 --> 00:48:25,586
Why won't you answer?

304
00:48:25,586 --> 00:48:27,898
Answer me, who are you?

305
00:48:27,898 --> 00:48:31,016
Well?

306
00:48:35,768 --> 00:48:37,768
Why are you throwing up on me?

307
00:48:43,402 --> 00:48:44,640
What... oh man...

308
00:48:45,886 --> 00:48:49,184
This guy, what am I going to do with him?

309
00:49:05,749 --> 00:49:06,677
Mom.

310
00:49:07,085 --> 00:49:09,762
Do you think he's a good person?

311
00:49:11,319 --> 00:49:15,745
From his complexion, he seems harmless.

312
00:49:16,601 --> 00:49:18,206
Looking at his clothes.

313
00:49:18,694 --> 00:49:22,560
He may even be a lord or leader.

314
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:26,565
A lord?

315
00:49:27,614 --> 00:49:29,614
I know what you're thinking.

316
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:34,760
By the way, we must stay here.
How can you leave our foreign master?

317
00:49:37,208 --> 00:49:40,800
I don't know why you are so loyal to him.

318
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,516
He doesn't even care about us nowadays.

319
00:49:45,191 --> 00:49:47,755
He gives us food and water.

320
00:49:48,281 --> 00:49:50,845
Do you want to be called
ungrateful to your boss?

321
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,560
Hey.

322
00:50:02,135 --> 00:50:03,006
Hey.

323
00:50:03,904 --> 00:50:07,194
I know you're awake, get up and talk.

324
00:50:10,756 --> 00:50:11,740
Wake up!

325
00:50:14,619 --> 00:50:15,716
Hey.

326
00:50:16,095 --> 00:50:18,659
How did you fall into the river?

327
00:50:37,438 --> 00:50:38,640
Who...

328
00:50:42,804 --> 00:50:45,989
Who are you? And where did you take me?

329
00:50:45,989 --> 00:50:49,436
My car, my clothes, and my phone.

330
00:50:49,436 --> 00:50:52,314
Are you the ones who took them?

331
00:50:52,314 --> 00:50:55,520
He's talking nonsense.

332
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:59,213
We should be asking who you are!

333
00:50:59,454 --> 00:51:00,880
Why aren't you speaking
the northern dialect?

334
00:51:01,204 --> 00:51:05,348
Mom, calm down. He just woke up.

335
00:51:06,604 --> 00:51:10,805
By the way, do you understand
the northern language?

336
00:51:17,330 --> 00:51:20,741
What's wrong, do you still have a headache?

337
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:27,480
Then rest a little longer.

338
00:51:27,838 --> 00:51:29,048
Nevermind.

339
00:51:30,549 --> 00:51:33,280
I think I'd better go now.

340
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,786
Oh and where are you going to?

341
00:51:37,029 --> 00:51:38,070
Well...

342
00:51:40,001 --> 00:51:44,540
Wherever you found me.

343
00:51:56,550 --> 00:51:58,099
I saw you here.

344
00:52:01,362 --> 00:52:02,640
Here?

345
00:52:03,108 --> 00:52:03,923
Yes.

346
00:52:04,245 --> 00:52:07,599
When I saw you, you were lying here.

347
00:52:07,959 --> 00:52:11,840
That's not all, you threw up all over me.

348
00:52:14,947 --> 00:52:16,044
I'm sorry.

349
00:52:20,090 --> 00:52:25,194
Oh, but can I borrow your handheld?

350
00:52:30,566 --> 00:52:32,360
What are you going to do with my hand?

351
00:52:34,641 --> 00:52:35,230
Here.

352
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:39,450
My hand.

353
00:52:39,746 --> 00:52:41,360
Well, not like that.

354
00:52:41,360 --> 00:52:45,653
I mean mobile phones that
are used to contact other people.

355
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:48,770
What joke is this?

356
00:52:49,594 --> 00:52:52,480
What are you talking
about? Have you gone crazy?

357
00:52:53,689 --> 00:52:56,705
I'm not crazy, you're crazy.

358
00:52:56,705 --> 00:52:59,029
How do you not know a mobile phone?
From which era are you from?

359
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,001
What's up with that.

360
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:07,944
Oh...

361
00:53:08,561 --> 00:53:10,956
Do you mean this one?

362
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,481
I saw it beside you.

363
00:53:16,006 --> 00:53:18,514
I didn't steal it, don't misunderstand.

364
00:53:19,055 --> 00:53:20,886
I just forgot to tell you.

365
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,493
Ah, then I'll take you to the police.

366
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:53,326
Maybe they can help you.

367
00:53:55,475 --> 00:53:57,200
Thank you very much.

368
00:54:47,998 --> 00:54:49,321
Are you going to the market?

369
00:54:49,321 --> 00:54:52,122
Yes uncle, where are you going?

370
00:54:54,321 --> 00:54:55,240
Good luck.

371
00:55:00,927 --> 00:55:04,880
Ming, why don't you take a car?

372
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:09,536
Do people like me have a car?

373
00:55:10,686 --> 00:55:13,420
Just having a boat to row is a merit.

374
00:55:15,098 --> 00:55:17,098
Or do you have a car?

375
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:22,143
Well, everyone has them.

376
00:55:35,281 --> 00:55:37,281
Are you selling well?

377
00:55:38,745 --> 00:55:40,745
I haven't seen you for a long time.

378
00:55:43,536 --> 00:55:45,536
Auntie's fabric is beautiful.

379
00:55:52,467 --> 00:55:54,467
What are you doing?

380
00:55:57,323 --> 00:56:00,000
Where is this place?

381
00:56:01,019 --> 00:56:05,502
It's Kad Luang, the
police station is close.

382
00:56:05,502 --> 00:56:07,625
Can you do it yourself?

383
00:56:09,550 --> 00:56:11,719
Sure, thanks.

384
00:56:31,586 --> 00:56:34,360
Hey, what's your name?

385
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:36,465
My name is Jom.

386
00:56:37,176 --> 00:56:39,740
Jom, my name is Ming.

387
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:43,536
When you get home, don't
forget me and my mother.

388
00:56:43,536 --> 00:56:47,370
We live at Master Robert's home over there.

389
00:56:51,921 --> 00:56:53,921
Don't forget... Ming.

390
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:56,034
Ming.

391
00:57:02,442 --> 00:57:03,708
Ming.

392
00:57:49,149 --> 00:57:50,000
Excuse me.

393
00:57:50,275 --> 00:57:51,767
Oh, what are you going to buy?

394
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,872
No, I wanted to borrow your phone.

395
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:59,606
Huh, what phone, I only know telegrams.

396
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:01,817
Go, go somewhere else if you're not buying.

397
00:58:06,056 --> 00:58:09,520
Why aren't you leaving yet?!

398
00:58:10,189 --> 00:58:11,230
Sorry.

399
00:58:12,399 --> 00:58:14,399
Why is she so angry?

400
00:58:20,745 --> 00:58:21,504
Cheers!

401
00:58:24,816 --> 00:58:26,139
Bottoms up!

402
00:58:28,761 --> 00:58:29,745
Cheers!

403
00:58:30,235 --> 00:58:31,163
Bottoms up!

404
00:58:38,717 --> 00:58:40,000
Excuse me.

405
00:58:40,326 --> 00:58:43,285
What is going on here?

406
00:58:44,180 --> 00:58:46,631
What are you talking about?

407
00:58:48,326 --> 00:58:55,630
This event? You're in
costume and very in character!

408
00:58:55,630 --> 00:58:57,537
Then I asked that aunt if
I could borrow her mobile

409
00:58:57,561 --> 00:58:59,467
phone and she acted like
she didn't know what it was.

410
00:58:59,749 --> 00:59:02,752
How can I borrow your cell phone?
It's really necessary.

411
00:59:02,752 --> 00:59:03,499
Please.

412
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:09,760
Eh... He's really asking for it.

413
00:59:10,012 --> 00:59:12,012
Do you really want to get punched?

414
00:59:14,592 --> 00:59:16,592
Please... excuse me.

415
00:59:16,592 --> 00:59:17,385
Sorry.

416
00:59:25,719 --> 00:59:27,042
Thank you.

417
00:59:29,667 --> 00:59:31,103
Northern sausage.

418
00:59:40,001 --> 00:59:41,493
How many pieces do you want?

419
00:59:42,768 --> 00:59:44,147
It's northern sausage.

420
00:59:54,364 --> 00:59:59,411
Oh sorry, I forgot that I didn't...

421
01:00:00,247 --> 01:00:01,680
have any money.

422
01:00:01,680 --> 01:00:04,200
If you don't have money,
Why are you standing in front of my store?

423
01:00:05,780 --> 01:00:06,990
I'm sorry.

424
01:00:10,001 --> 01:00:13,920
Wait, there's one piece that's burnt right here.

425
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:16,640
Eat first, then bring me the money later.

426
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,031
No, it's okay.

427
01:00:18,031 --> 01:00:20,915
Just take it and get out of the way.

428
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:23,086
I'm trying to make a
living and you're in the way.

429
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:25,266
Hurry up and get me the money later.

430
01:00:26,494 --> 01:00:27,648
Go!

431
01:00:33,755 --> 01:00:38,407
Why won't you look where you're going?
Look, so weirdly dressed.

432
01:00:39,234 --> 01:00:40,000
I'm sorry.

433
01:00:40,000 --> 01:00:41,346
Clumsy again.

434
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:42,493
I'm sorry.

435
01:02:57,574 --> 01:02:59,000
What is this?

436
01:03:00,056 --> 01:03:02,395
I want to ask you where
is the police station?

437
01:03:03,194 --> 01:03:05,758
Keeping going further away from
the gold shop, go straight over there.

438
01:03:07,465 --> 01:03:08,957
Oh...

439
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:26,376
Oh boy, you keep staring!

440
01:03:26,643 --> 01:03:29,659
I said it's around the corner,
go straight, do you understand?

441
01:03:29,659 --> 01:03:33,472
Yes, may I ask one question?

442
01:03:33,472 --> 01:03:35,388
Help, there's a thief stealing money.

443
01:03:35,388 --> 01:03:37,681
What year are we in?

444
01:03:40,561 --> 01:03:43,520
Help catch the thief!

445
01:03:43,520 --> 01:03:44,070
Dammit!

446
01:03:44,070 --> 01:03:45,277
A thief stole money!

447
01:03:45,277 --> 01:03:46,159
You dropped this.

448
01:03:46,159 --> 01:03:48,292
Stop it, thief! Give my
friend back her money!

449
01:03:48,292 --> 01:03:51,283
Huh? What is this?

450
01:03:52,017 --> 01:03:54,017
They don't use this kind of money anymore.

451
01:03:54,017 --> 01:03:57,345
You don't have to act like you don't
know anything! Caught red-handed like this!

452
01:03:57,345 --> 01:04:00,345
Dressed up so weirdly
but you're actually a thief!

453
01:04:01,064 --> 01:04:05,660
I saw Chan gave him some northern
sausage to eat, but he's actually evil!

454
01:04:05,660 --> 01:04:08,275
Knowing this, I would have
stabbed him the first time!

455
01:04:08,275 --> 01:04:11,178
Well, take it easy, Auntie.
I'm not really a thief.

456
01:04:11,178 --> 01:04:12,803
It's a misunderstanding, I
haven't done anything yet.

457
01:04:12,803 --> 01:04:15,638
What do you mean you didn't do anything?
The evidence is in your hand!

458
01:04:15,638 --> 01:04:17,640
I'll take you to the police right now.

459
01:04:17,640 --> 01:04:21,115
Bring the police to arrest him!

460
01:04:21,115 --> 01:04:23,209
Where's the thief?

461
01:04:25,106 --> 01:04:25,921
Ming!

462
01:04:26,258 --> 01:04:27,129
Mr. Jom.

463
01:04:27,458 --> 01:04:28,668
Do you know him?

464
01:04:29,935 --> 01:04:33,910
Ming, please explain to this auntie
that, Just now, someone ran into me.

465
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:37,039
Then he ran over there, He
dropped the money and I picked it up.

466
01:04:37,039 --> 01:04:39,165
And now the aunties
think that I'm a thief.

467
01:04:41,804 --> 01:04:44,707
Auntie, is this your money basket?

468
01:04:45,205 --> 01:04:45,851
Yes.

469
01:04:46,259 --> 01:04:50,347
Auntie, I saw Somyot running and carrying
it all the way to Yang Temple over there.

470
01:04:50,571 --> 01:04:53,643
He came with me, he's not a thief.

471
01:04:54,489 --> 01:04:55,586
How do you know that?

472
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,242
Why would I lie to you?

473
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:04,716
That's what I thought! You were
so sure, cursing at him like that.

474
01:05:04,716 --> 01:05:05,884
Well, I had no idea.

475
01:05:06,689 --> 01:05:07,955
I'm so sorry.

476
01:05:07,955 --> 01:05:09,614
Come on, let's go catch Somyot.

477
01:05:09,614 --> 01:05:11,350
I'm so sorry honey.

478
01:05:11,350 --> 01:05:12,541
Come on.

479
01:05:16,686 --> 01:05:23,000
Jom, you really aren't a lord.

480
01:05:23,616 --> 01:05:26,632
If you don't have me, you'd be
dead as a doornail, you know?

481
01:05:27,355 --> 01:05:29,355
Dead as a doornail.

482
01:05:35,736 --> 01:05:37,736
Thank you again, Ming.

483
01:05:37,736 --> 01:05:40,707
But where are you taking me?

484
01:05:40,707 --> 01:05:47,440
You have nowhere to go, right?
I will take you to find a place to eat.

485
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,760
So won't you let me
go to the police station?

486
01:05:54,022 --> 01:05:59,320
Police Station, I think
you'd be eaten alive in there.

487
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:05,920
If I take you there, you'll do
something stupid and really land in jail.

488
01:06:11,481 --> 01:06:14,158
Umm, let me ask.

489
01:06:14,952 --> 01:06:16,331
What?

490
01:06:16,927 --> 01:06:22,566
What is the day, month, year now?

491
01:06:23,689 --> 01:06:24,899
Jom.

492
01:06:29,281 --> 01:06:33,087
Besides not knowing who you are,
you still don't know the date?

493
01:06:33,922 --> 01:06:35,019
Well?

494
01:06:37,737 --> 01:06:42,051
Then what kind would
you tell me, B.E. or R.E.?

495
01:06:42,778 --> 01:06:43,424
Huh?

496
01:06:44,473 --> 01:06:47,094
What is R.E.?

497
01:06:47,657 --> 01:06:51,576
Dammit, don't tell me
that you don't know R.E.

498
01:06:53,107 --> 01:06:57,364
Yeah, but it's not that strange, They
stopped counting like that a long time ago.

499
01:07:05,542 --> 01:07:10,871
Ming, then, who is the governor now?

500
01:07:11,536 --> 01:07:16,978
No, who's ruling this place now?

501
01:07:18,430 --> 01:07:27,840
Jom, it's Lord Kaew Nawarat,
he's the ruler of Chiang Mai.

502
01:07:28,370 --> 01:07:30,370
What rock have you been living under?

503
01:07:30,370 --> 01:07:31,688
Lord Kaew Nawarat.

504
01:07:31,688 --> 01:07:32,397
Yeah.

505
01:07:35,616 --> 01:07:37,616
What's wrong with him?

506
01:08:50,613 --> 01:08:55,829
I dreamt of me and a man.

507
01:08:56,280 --> 01:08:59,378
A man I've never seen and don't know.

508
01:09:09,234 --> 01:09:11,234
Hey!!

509
01:09:11,234 --> 01:09:11,734
What?

510
01:09:11,734 --> 01:09:12,373
Gecko!

511
01:09:12,373 --> 01:09:12,873
What?

512
01:09:12,873 --> 01:09:13,373
Gecko!

513
01:09:14,737 --> 01:09:15,383
Gecko!

514
01:09:15,383 --> 01:09:16,681
Hey, Calm down!

515
01:10:23,060 --> 01:10:24,660
(Next Episode)
Khun Yai, this is Jom.

516
01:10:24,700 --> 01:10:26,020
He lost his way.

517
01:10:26,020 --> 01:10:27,780
You're not from around here are you?

518
01:10:27,780 --> 01:10:30,540
If so, why don't you take Jom
to change out of his clothes.

519
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:33,780
This is the one you said that
you're going to bring to me?

520
01:10:33,780 --> 01:10:35,700
Ming said he found me here.

521
01:10:38,300 --> 01:10:39,580
Jeed, what's wrong with you?

522
01:10:40,140 --> 01:10:41,300
What's wrong with you?

523
01:10:41,300 --> 01:10:41,820
Help!

524
01:10:43,220 --> 01:10:44,620
Jom just lost his spirit.

525
01:10:44,860 --> 01:10:46,380
Let me bring your spirit back.

526
01:10:47,740 --> 01:10:49,460
I hope that your spirit,

527
01:10:50,020 --> 01:10:51,860
comes back to you.
