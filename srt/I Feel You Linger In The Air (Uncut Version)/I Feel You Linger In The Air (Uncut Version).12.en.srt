1
00:00:00,177 --> 00:00:02,190
(Previously)
I'm going to take you to Phranakorn.

2
00:00:03,390 --> 00:00:04,142
In this life..

3
00:00:04,491 --> 00:00:07,980
I don't think I can be the same
Fong Kaew for you anymore.

4
00:00:08,491 --> 00:00:10,180
So does that mean that I
will disappear over time?

5
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,034
But the answer will show itself

6
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,540
when our time comes.

7
00:00:15,817 --> 00:00:18,760
Someday we will meet again.

8
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:23,320
With love, Jom.

9
00:00:24,068 --> 00:00:26,960
October, 1928.

10
00:00:41,702 --> 00:00:45,062
What are we digging for, Khun Yai?

11
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:49,430
I don't know if you will believe me, Jom.

12
00:00:50,257 --> 00:00:51,430
But I feel like...

13
00:00:54,297 --> 00:00:55,577
there is something

14
00:00:56,491 --> 00:00:58,222
that is important to you and me

15
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,160
buried under this plumeria tree.

16
00:01:03,217 --> 00:01:04,537
Something important?

17
00:01:06,234 --> 00:01:06,820
Yes.

18
00:01:09,097 --> 00:01:10,714
But I'm not quite sure,

19
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:12,980
so I asked you to prove it together.

20
00:01:14,422 --> 00:01:15,790
Please help me, Jom.

21
00:01:46,474 --> 00:01:48,314
Jom, please take this from me.

22
00:02:11,742 --> 00:02:12,308
A ring?

23
00:02:14,891 --> 00:02:15,634
What's the ring?

24
00:02:19,177 --> 00:02:19,620
Jom,

25
00:02:20,525 --> 00:02:21,950
please give me your hand.

26
00:02:24,302 --> 00:02:25,245
My hand?

27
00:02:25,662 --> 00:02:26,074
Yes.

28
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,690
I have a gut feeling

29
00:02:33,474 --> 00:02:34,828
that you will be able to wear this ring.

30
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:41,137
What makes you this confident?

31
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,754
And we don't even know whose ring it is.

32
00:02:42,806 --> 00:02:43,370
Is it a good idea?

33
00:02:45,088 --> 00:02:46,584
Please believe me just once, Jom.

34
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,946
If something bad happens,

35
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,060
I would be right here with you,

36
00:02:52,535 --> 00:02:53,339
I won't go anywhere.

37
00:03:20,431 --> 00:03:21,728
Jom, listen to me.

38
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,511
I may give you this ring

39
00:03:25,067 --> 00:03:26,309
so that you'll be reminded

40
00:03:27,172 --> 00:03:30,740
that my heart will be only yours forever.

41
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,561
Khun Yai!

42
00:03:51,053 --> 00:03:51,670
Jom!

43
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:56,840
Did you have a nightmare?

44
00:04:10,998 --> 00:04:15,140
What are you staring at me like that?

45
00:04:17,693 --> 00:04:20,880
Or that nightmare had to do with me?

46
00:04:29,356 --> 00:04:30,713
No, Khun Yai.

47
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:37,040
Well, I...

48
00:04:39,043 --> 00:04:40,313
I dreamed of you...

49
00:04:42,987 --> 00:04:44,990
a different version of you from now.

50
00:04:49,008 --> 00:04:50,646
What do you mean?

51
00:04:55,234 --> 00:05:05,510
In my dream, you had dark
skin and a thick moustache.

52
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:15,190
You had tattoos, and your voice...

53
00:05:18,170 --> 00:05:19,446
it was so harsh,

54
00:05:21,415 --> 00:05:25,400
as if you were an ancient
warrior or something like that.

55
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:28,452
And in your dream,

56
00:05:29,857 --> 00:05:34,619
did that version of me do you any harm?

57
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:37,826
Oh, not at all.

58
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,840
The Yai in my dream,

59
00:05:44,633 --> 00:05:46,066
he only gave me a ring

60
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:51,165
with a lion head on it.

61
00:05:54,483 --> 00:05:55,753
Then, he told me...

62
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:05,798
that his heart would
be only mine forever.

63
00:06:13,078 --> 00:06:17,627
I... I don't get it.

64
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:21,805
I don't get it, Khun Yai.

65
00:06:23,631 --> 00:06:24,930
Bless you, Jom.

66
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,400
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 12)

67
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:02,034
Jom, what are we digging for?

68
00:08:03,853 --> 00:08:06,360
If what happened in my dream

69
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,920
is true in a way,

70
00:08:09,172 --> 00:08:11,638
there must be something
important down here for sure.

71
00:08:15,673 --> 00:08:16,486
Something important?

72
00:08:17,113 --> 00:08:17,864
Yes.

73
00:08:20,831 --> 00:08:21,631
Jom.

74
00:08:37,015 --> 00:08:38,100
Impossible.

75
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,420
There must be something, mustn't it?

76
00:08:53,993 --> 00:08:54,438
Jom,

77
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,570
you might be so anxious

78
00:09:01,453 --> 00:09:03,387
that it turned into your dream about us.

79
00:09:05,801 --> 00:09:06,271
But...

80
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:11,210
Jom, it's time to bid Eeang
Peung and Maey farewell.

81
00:09:38,806 --> 00:09:41,220
I'm here to bid your
farewell, Father and Mother,

82
00:09:42,187 --> 00:09:44,160
because I'm moving out.

83
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:49,123
Do you really have to go
that far away, Eeang Peung?

84
00:09:50,264 --> 00:09:53,113
Our house has survived Robert.

85
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,510
So why don't you just live here?

86
00:09:57,349 --> 00:09:58,942
I know, Mother.

87
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:02,573
But I can't keep on living here

88
00:10:03,624 --> 00:10:05,520
without thinking of the past.

89
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:11,502
I've thought over it, Mother,

90
00:10:14,076 --> 00:10:16,810
although that house is
actually our old house.

91
00:10:17,947 --> 00:10:19,269
So how would you get
on with your life there?

92
00:10:21,686 --> 00:10:23,471
Don't worry, Mother.

93
00:10:24,584 --> 00:10:26,532
Maey and I...

94
00:10:27,815 --> 00:10:29,815
we will fix the house together,

95
00:10:30,473 --> 00:10:35,440
and we might sell something

96
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,584
to make a little money.

97
00:10:39,471 --> 00:10:43,680
And I will use it as an opportunity

98
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:46,830
to study politics at the same time, Mother.

99
00:10:56,267 --> 00:10:58,194
With such determination of yours,

100
00:10:59,572 --> 00:11:01,012
what can I say?

101
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:05,820
Thank you, Mother.

102
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,360
Maey.

103
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:12,720
Yes, Khun Ying?

104
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,510
Please take care of my daughter.

105
00:11:19,182 --> 00:11:20,601
Please take care of my daughter.

106
00:11:26,709 --> 00:11:30,431
I will do my best for Khun Eeang Peung.

107
00:11:35,704 --> 00:11:38,984
Won't you say something to your daughter?

108
00:11:39,526 --> 00:11:40,751
She's leaving.

109
00:11:43,356 --> 00:11:44,921
What more do you want from me?

110
00:11:46,633 --> 00:11:47,721
At this moment...

111
00:11:48,476 --> 00:11:51,015
I feel all bewildered with
what has happened in my life.

112
00:11:53,356 --> 00:11:54,633
Whatever they want to do,

113
00:11:55,683 --> 00:11:56,880
just let them do.

114
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:05,950
Let Chan see you off.

115
00:12:07,673 --> 00:12:09,582
He has got the car prepared
at the front of the house.

116
00:12:11,419 --> 00:12:12,946
While you're living there,

117
00:12:13,436 --> 00:12:16,417
send us some letters
and visit us here at times.

118
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:22,100
Father...

119
00:12:27,693 --> 00:12:28,841
I wish you luck, Eeang Peung.

120
00:13:06,946 --> 00:13:08,403
We've got to go now, Yai.

121
00:13:09,426 --> 00:13:11,070
Bon voyage, Eeang Peung.

122
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:13,446
Take care of yourself.

123
00:13:14,973 --> 00:13:17,707
If I pass by your place
someday, I will pay you a visit.

124
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,634
You too, Yai.

125
00:13:22,667 --> 00:13:23,920
Take care of each other.

126
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,539
Don't worry, Eeang Peung.

127
00:13:27,641 --> 00:13:29,589
I will never let anything happen to him.

128
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:35,230
Maey, take care of my sister for me.

129
00:13:37,260 --> 00:13:38,316
Yes, Khun Yai.

130
00:13:42,852 --> 00:13:43,410
Jom.

131
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,502
Yes, Khun Eeang Peung?

132
00:13:46,274 --> 00:13:51,307
I don't know if we met before.

133
00:13:53,057 --> 00:13:57,010
But I feel some good chemistry between us.

134
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:02,563
Anyway, please take
care of Yai for me, Jom.

135
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:06,754
Yes, Khun Eeang Peung.

136
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:11,937
Don't forget to look after your health.

137
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:16,434
Someday we will meet again.

138
00:14:18,570 --> 00:14:19,947
I hope so.

139
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,950
The car is ready, Khun Eeang Peung.

140
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:29,457
Maey and I have to go now.

141
00:14:31,495 --> 00:14:32,466
See you later.

142
00:14:33,537 --> 00:14:33,906
Yes.

143
00:14:37,422 --> 00:14:37,645
Let's go.

144
00:15:00,386 --> 00:15:02,685
Khun Yai, now you've got to
have a meal at that house, right?

145
00:15:03,387 --> 00:15:07,340
Yes. Prik told me that Father and Mother,

146
00:15:07,516 --> 00:15:09,540
they wanted to talk with
me about studying abroad.

147
00:15:10,507 --> 00:15:11,000
Yeah.

148
00:15:11,993 --> 00:15:15,160
So it means that Khun
Phra has compromised, right?

149
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,510
I'm not sure.

150
00:15:17,676 --> 00:15:19,154
But regarding Eeang
Peung's issue this morning,

151
00:15:19,641 --> 00:15:20,295
I think it might be true.

152
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:44,323
You made it all by yourself, Khun Yai?

153
00:15:49,090 --> 00:15:51,930
Absolutely.

154
00:15:54,417 --> 00:15:57,430
So why did you do this?

155
00:16:02,413 --> 00:16:03,930
I just don't want you

156
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,873
to see your own shadow gradually fade away.

157
00:16:12,310 --> 00:16:14,845
But won't it...

158
00:16:14,918 --> 00:16:15,650
Jom,

159
00:16:19,387 --> 00:16:22,120
don't be paranoid with
what hasn't yet come.

160
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,350
I'm right here with you.

161
00:16:28,236 --> 00:16:30,093
So now you're just right here with me.

162
00:16:37,660 --> 00:16:37,993
Yes.

163
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:22,330
Jom!

164
00:19:24,201 --> 00:19:24,460
Jom!

165
00:19:25,241 --> 00:19:25,819
Khamsaen!

166
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:38,629
What brings you here?

167
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,440
Oh! What are you doing here?

168
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,446
Is everything all right?

169
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:46,650
Jom,

170
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,102
have you seen Fong Kaew around here?

171
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:54,580
Fong Kaew?

172
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:00,650
Well, thinking of it,

173
00:20:02,800 --> 00:20:04,598
I haven't seen her for a while.

174
00:20:06,678 --> 00:20:07,193
Why?

175
00:20:12,914 --> 00:20:14,643
She's left me.

176
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:19,600
What do you mean?

177
00:20:22,288 --> 00:20:23,360
She's left a letter

178
00:20:26,636 --> 00:20:28,288
and had it sent to me at the Kad.

179
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,690
She said she would begin her new life

180
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:36,006
somewhere else with her mom.

181
00:20:36,883 --> 00:20:39,690
So how has it turned out this way?

182
00:20:40,027 --> 00:20:40,720
What happened?

183
00:20:41,095 --> 00:20:43,140
You guys seemed to
live happily ever after, didn't you?

184
00:20:46,893 --> 00:20:47,760
I don't know either.

185
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,400
I have no clue at all.

186
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,415
She said she's changed.

187
00:20:58,104 --> 00:20:59,030
She's changed.

188
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:04,070
She's not the same Fong Kaew for me.

189
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:08,671
What do I do?

190
00:21:11,735 --> 00:21:13,227
What do I do, Jom?

191
00:21:14,034 --> 00:21:17,558
I have given her all my love.

192
00:21:19,005 --> 00:21:21,168
All that is left is my life.

193
00:21:23,652 --> 00:21:24,751
So what more does she want from me?!

194
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,280
Calm down, Khamsaen.

195
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:35,304
Calm down.

196
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,540
I've got nobody left.

197
00:21:49,885 --> 00:21:51,043
Please move on, Khamsaen.

198
00:21:53,332 --> 00:21:54,566
Just think...

199
00:21:56,963 --> 00:22:01,430
that you two are not meant
for each other in this life.

200
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,210
I know that Fong Kaew

201
00:22:10,210 --> 00:22:12,493
doesn't want me to get
involved with her any more.

202
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:15,071
Even if I happened to die right here,

203
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:21,390
I still love her.

204
00:22:26,907 --> 00:22:31,906
If such a thing happened
to you and who you loved,

205
00:22:34,153 --> 00:22:37,010
could you really move on from him, Jom?

206
00:22:46,706 --> 00:22:47,377
Khamsaen,

207
00:22:51,436 --> 00:22:51,958
listen to me.

208
00:22:56,226 --> 00:22:56,928
Fong Kaew...

209
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:01,662
she hasn't fallen out of love with you.

210
00:23:03,888 --> 00:23:08,386
I think she might've just...

211
00:23:10,664 --> 00:23:12,692
had so many factors...

212
00:23:16,302 --> 00:23:17,850
that made her decide to do something

213
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:19,580
that she probably didn't want to.

214
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:26,970
But the most important thing,

215
00:23:29,544 --> 00:23:31,550
it's that she made the decision herself.

216
00:23:33,582 --> 00:23:34,740
It was one of the few times...

217
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,933
when she could choose her own path.

218
00:23:44,290 --> 00:23:45,270
So, please put youself in her shoes.

219
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:00,034
Although, in this life,

220
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,370
you and Fong Kaew, thanks to your fate,

221
00:24:05,370 --> 00:24:06,461
are not meant for each other.

222
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:13,786
But who knows? In another life,

223
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:17,694
you two...

224
00:24:18,639 --> 00:24:20,223
might end up together.

225
00:24:58,937 --> 00:24:59,580
Jom!

226
00:25:04,756 --> 00:25:05,380
Jom!

227
00:25:07,107 --> 00:25:07,725
Jom!

228
00:25:17,915 --> 00:25:19,234
Jom! Jom!

229
00:25:20,594 --> 00:25:21,175
Khun Yai!

230
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:21,993
Jom!

231
00:25:23,786 --> 00:25:24,190
Jom!

232
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:37,403
I woke up and didn't see you there.

233
00:25:39,561 --> 00:25:41,027
I thought you would have been gone.

234
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:47,682
Don't say that, Khun Yai.

235
00:25:49,505 --> 00:25:50,580
Don't be nervous.

236
00:25:52,988 --> 00:25:53,840
I'm still here.

237
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:03,870
I'm afraid, Jom.

238
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,569
Don't be so.

239
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:15,703
I haven't left you.

240
00:26:36,112 --> 00:26:37,350
I love you so much, Jom.

241
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,858
I want to say it

242
00:26:45,703 --> 00:26:48,889
because I will get fewer chances.

243
00:26:59,171 --> 00:26:59,844
I also...

244
00:27:02,828 --> 00:27:04,025
I also love you, Khun Yai.

245
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:23,830
Khun Yai, what do you think
our world will be like from now on?

246
00:30:24,312 --> 00:30:25,465
I don't know.

247
00:30:27,487 --> 00:30:29,023
But what I know right now

248
00:30:29,610 --> 00:30:31,380
is that you are my lover.

249
00:30:32,970 --> 00:30:35,270
I can only stay by your side.

250
00:30:35,557 --> 00:30:36,604
In times like these,

251
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:43,710
I will never leave you
alone with your worries.

252
00:30:44,903 --> 00:30:45,850
I promise.

253
00:30:47,781 --> 00:30:49,185
I'm not going anywhere.

254
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:52,647
But how long will it be like that?

255
00:30:54,160 --> 00:31:00,380
Enjoy the remaining time
that we have left, right?

256
00:31:01,047 --> 00:31:02,145
I'll try.

257
00:32:30,357 --> 00:32:32,023
Khun Yai, what's wrong?

258
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:33,520
Why are you making that face?

259
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:33,780
Hmh?

260
00:32:36,437 --> 00:32:37,240
Your body...

261
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:40,684
Jom... Your body...

262
00:33:18,272 --> 00:33:18,910
Jom,

263
00:33:20,927 --> 00:33:22,348
you haven't found the
corner you're familiar with?

264
00:33:24,527 --> 00:33:24,976
No, I haven't.

265
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:28,341
Well, I think this must be the place...

266
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:30,818
depicted in the drawings
in that chest, Khun Yai.

267
00:33:31,345 --> 00:33:33,170
But we've been here for a long time

268
00:33:33,170 --> 00:33:36,072
and seen nobody standing
under these rubber trees.

269
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:42,209
So why don't you sit down and rest here?

270
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:08,997
It isn't long until...

271
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:12,700
you've got to study abroad, right?

272
00:34:16,376 --> 00:34:17,320
When I go,

273
00:34:19,757 --> 00:34:21,228
will you think of me?

274
00:34:25,790 --> 00:34:27,329
Of course, I will.

275
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:35,250
When I come back,

276
00:34:36,698 --> 00:34:40,014
I intend to do the test to become a judge.

277
00:34:43,940 --> 00:34:45,675
And when my aspiration becomes true,

278
00:34:48,390 --> 00:34:52,110
I may have power to make a change.

279
00:35:00,425 --> 00:35:00,851
Khun Yai.

280
00:35:03,296 --> 00:35:03,690
Yes?

281
00:35:06,089 --> 00:35:12,550
Do you remember it when you asked me

282
00:35:14,063 --> 00:35:17,700
to wait for you until you graduate

283
00:35:18,188 --> 00:35:21,520
and come back?

284
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:23,755
Certainly.

285
00:35:25,792 --> 00:35:28,190
And your answer is...

286
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,385
I will.

287
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,050
I will wait for you at the little house.

288
00:35:36,428 --> 00:35:38,820
I will wait until you come back to me,

289
00:35:41,390 --> 00:35:44,421
no matter if I will still be there

290
00:35:46,460 --> 00:35:47,661
or if I will have already gone.

291
00:35:49,023 --> 00:35:49,825
Come what may,

292
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:53,010
I will wait for you there.

293
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:24,268
I promise you right here, Jom,

294
00:36:29,409 --> 00:36:33,649
that I will never love anyone else.

295
00:36:36,945 --> 00:36:37,931
No matter how far apart we will be

296
00:36:40,303 --> 00:36:41,760
or how long it will take,

297
00:36:43,757 --> 00:36:45,200
I will never let anyone

298
00:36:46,117 --> 00:36:48,630
rip the love out of my heart

299
00:36:52,496 --> 00:36:55,950
expect you, Jom.

300
00:37:22,835 --> 00:37:24,157
My Jom and only.

301
00:37:27,644 --> 00:37:29,428
If you say anything else,

302
00:37:32,414 --> 00:37:33,623
I'll definitely start crying.

303
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:36,830
Jom...

304
00:37:47,220 --> 00:37:52,124
Well, I've got some idea.

305
00:37:55,240 --> 00:37:56,936
Please go and stand under that tree,

306
00:37:58,454 --> 00:37:59,630
and I'll be waiting here.

307
00:38:01,432 --> 00:38:02,065
Why?

308
00:38:04,637 --> 00:38:09,300
I want to draw a portrait of you
and keep it as my souvenir.

309
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:12,788
When I'm studying overseas,

310
00:38:15,176 --> 00:38:16,477
when you're not with me,

311
00:38:19,340 --> 00:38:21,410
then I can look at it

312
00:38:22,324 --> 00:38:23,510
to cure myself when I miss you.

313
00:38:28,861 --> 00:38:32,614
Look at what you said.

314
00:38:34,423 --> 00:38:35,748
I've got to give in, right?

315
00:38:36,903 --> 00:38:39,160
You left me with nothing I can say.

316
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:42,018
Why?

317
00:38:44,178 --> 00:38:47,656
Are you afraid that my
drawing won't be impressive?

318
00:38:50,317 --> 00:38:51,371
Well...

319
00:38:51,595 --> 00:38:52,992
Hey, Jom!

320
00:38:57,232 --> 00:38:58,216
Yes.

321
00:38:58,858 --> 00:38:59,221
I will do it.

322
00:39:05,552 --> 00:39:06,736
How is it, Khun Yai?

323
00:39:07,788 --> 00:39:09,096
It's getting quite nice, Jom.

324
00:39:10,597 --> 00:39:11,776
Don't move now.

325
00:39:12,830 --> 00:39:15,651
Woah! Can I trust you?

326
00:39:16,282 --> 00:39:16,722
Hey!

327
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:18,832
If you don't trust me,

328
00:39:19,588 --> 00:39:20,930
who else can you trust, then?

329
00:39:24,816 --> 00:39:25,880
I'm nearly done, Jom.

330
00:39:26,604 --> 00:39:27,647
Wait a minute.

331
00:39:41,661 --> 00:39:42,141
Jom!

332
00:39:58,660 --> 00:39:59,242
Khun Yai!

333
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:03,680
I think...

334
00:40:08,849 --> 00:40:10,301
it's time I have to go.

335
00:40:14,211 --> 00:40:17,130
Jom, don't say this!

336
00:40:21,595 --> 00:40:27,130
From now on, when I'm gone,

337
00:40:30,967 --> 00:40:32,050
you've got to...

338
00:40:35,167 --> 00:40:37,301
enjoy your life to the fullest.

339
00:40:39,983 --> 00:40:41,781
How could I live, Jom?

340
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:50,087
I love you so much.

341
00:40:52,609 --> 00:40:53,727
Don't go, Jom.

342
00:40:55,007 --> 00:40:56,503
Be with me right here. Please, Jom.

343
00:40:59,755 --> 00:41:01,178
Although we won't part in this way,

344
00:41:03,708 --> 00:41:05,303
someday we must be away from each other,

345
00:41:07,970 --> 00:41:12,180
be it alive or by death.

346
00:41:15,548 --> 00:41:17,656
Nothing lasts forever, Khun Yai.

347
00:41:19,696 --> 00:41:24,237
Don't worry.

348
00:41:27,322 --> 00:41:28,720
I've promised you

349
00:41:29,938 --> 00:41:31,847
that I will wait for you
at the House of Palathip.

350
00:41:33,792 --> 00:41:35,696
If everything that would
happen isn't too bad,

351
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:43,696
I would wait for you right there.

352
00:41:52,395 --> 00:41:52,976
Khun Yai,

353
00:41:56,865 --> 00:41:57,804
I love you.

354
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:01,877
I'm about to go.

355
00:42:03,950 --> 00:42:04,908
Please smile for me.

356
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:18,490
I love you very much.

357
00:42:23,204 --> 00:42:24,720
I hope we will meet each other again.

You!

375
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:35,595
You!

376
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:37,724
Do you hear me?

377
00:45:38,530 --> 00:45:38,968
You!

378
00:45:40,070 --> 00:45:41,035
Do you hear me?

379
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:43,764
Do you hear me?

380
00:46:14,820 --> 00:46:22,260
(Chiang Mai, 2023)

381
00:46:23,950 --> 00:46:25,386
Wow!

382
00:46:25,964 --> 00:46:29,555
Did you clean up my whole room?

383
00:46:30,128 --> 00:46:32,591
Hey! Of course!

384
00:46:33,431 --> 00:46:34,897
Normally I don't even care to do it.

385
00:46:35,755 --> 00:46:38,662
But if I were not your nice little sister,

386
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:41,320
the room wouldn't be pristine like this, right?

387
00:46:50,928 --> 00:46:51,457
Thank you.

388
00:46:52,564 --> 00:46:55,497
No! Don't be cheesy!
I'm getting goosebumps!

389
00:46:56,780 --> 00:46:58,720
Look at you!

390
00:46:58,720 --> 00:46:59,515
Ouch! It hurts!

391
00:47:02,270 --> 00:47:02,920
Jom.

392
00:47:03,986 --> 00:47:04,222
Hmh?

393
00:47:05,528 --> 00:47:08,160
Actually, that Ohm phoned you.

394
00:47:10,217 --> 00:47:10,620
When?

395
00:47:12,284 --> 00:47:14,730
When you were at the hospital.

396
00:47:14,813 --> 00:47:18,900
But don't worry. I've blocked his number.

397
00:47:26,017 --> 00:47:28,013
I don't want them to mess around with you.

398
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:33,240
Yeah, I didn't even say anything.

399
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:34,920
I'm fine.

400
00:47:41,662 --> 00:47:43,191
Who? Mom?

401
00:47:44,324 --> 00:47:45,230
I don't think so.

402
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:46,262
She's not even back.

403
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,630
You ordered some
desserts a while ago, right?

404
00:47:52,115 --> 00:47:52,460
Ah!

405
00:47:53,151 --> 00:47:53,942
I'm getting them for you.

406
00:48:00,631 --> 00:48:00,911
Jeed.

407
00:48:03,137 --> 00:48:03,800
Well...

408
00:48:05,730 --> 00:48:06,770
I can't contact Jom.

409
00:48:07,826 --> 00:48:09,280
I've just heard of what happened to him,

410
00:48:10,017 --> 00:48:11,680
so I intended to visit him at the hospital.

411
00:48:12,404 --> 00:48:14,155
But they said he had just left,

412
00:48:15,008 --> 00:48:17,577
so I tried checking him out here.

413
00:48:18,991 --> 00:48:20,631
So why would you ever think to come here?

414
00:48:23,573 --> 00:48:26,017
Jeed, please let me and
Khaimook talk to Jom.

415
00:48:26,510 --> 00:48:27,750
So who's at the door, Jeed?

416
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:36,160
Ohm...

417
00:48:55,844 --> 00:49:01,755
Jeed, go wait in the room.

418
00:49:05,435 --> 00:49:05,690
But...

419
00:49:05,804 --> 00:49:06,220
Jeed.

420
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:11,471
Please.

421
00:49:23,471 --> 00:49:24,520
Ohm, Jeed...

422
00:49:28,173 --> 00:49:31,173
If I were her, I would do the same.

423
00:49:35,831 --> 00:49:36,853
So, you and...

424
00:49:41,577 --> 00:49:44,297
What made you guys want to see me here?

425
00:49:50,515 --> 00:49:56,600
Well, Khaimook and I
want to apologize to you.

426
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:00,690
Apologize to me?

427
00:50:07,328 --> 00:50:09,370
We felt so bad

428
00:50:10,568 --> 00:50:14,008
after hearing of your accident that night.

429
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:18,182
And she was really worried

430
00:50:19,444 --> 00:50:20,880
about your condition.

431
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,280
So, if you could go back in time,

432
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:30,630
would you still do the same?

433
00:50:39,248 --> 00:50:40,400
I was just talking nonsense.

434
00:50:40,764 --> 00:50:41,786
At the end of the day,

435
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:43,804
we can never travel back in time.

436
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:46,262
But never mind.

437
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:51,413
Let bygones be bygones.

438
00:50:56,186 --> 00:50:59,510
I'm sorry, Jom,

439
00:51:00,450 --> 00:51:02,200
that I asked Ohm to make the decision

440
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,430
because I needed an answer myself.

441
00:51:06,755 --> 00:51:08,840
I just didn't want you or me to...

442
00:51:09,804 --> 00:51:11,142
be in such a situation forever.

443
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:14,520
Do you understand me?

444
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,857
I understand both of you,

445
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,350
after everything has happened.

446
00:51:34,204 --> 00:51:36,155
But I want you guys to
understand me as well

447
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:38,530
that it's impossible

448
00:51:38,530 --> 00:51:39,577
to think that I have no feelings.

449
00:51:40,915 --> 00:51:41,890
As I told you, anyway,

450
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:47,022
don't worry, because I don't mind any more.

451
00:51:51,924 --> 00:51:58,830
Jom, I'm sorry for everything I did to you.

452
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:04,928
Never mind, Ohm.

453
00:52:07,946 --> 00:52:13,004
Now you get to be with who you love,

454
00:52:15,684 --> 00:52:17,980
so do your best for her.

455
00:52:41,888 --> 00:52:45,030
Woah! Why are you devouring it like that?

456
00:52:45,373 --> 00:52:47,100
You don't know anything.

457
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:50,180
How I miss the desserts in this era!

458
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:51,120
Huh?

459
00:52:53,620 --> 00:52:54,355
What did you say?

460
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:06,060
No! I mean, I haven't eaten
desserts in this area for so long.

461
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:09,822
Wait, Jom.

462
00:53:11,013 --> 00:53:12,790
Why did you talk so nicely with them,

463
00:53:13,911 --> 00:53:15,804
when they hurt you like that?

464
00:53:16,831 --> 00:53:18,180
Think about it.

465
00:53:19,022 --> 00:53:22,510
Ohm brought the other
girl in this very room.

466
00:53:23,248 --> 00:53:24,920
Don't you feel anything?

467
00:53:32,260 --> 00:53:35,070
So how do you want me to feel?

468
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:37,568
Everything has ended.

469
00:53:40,564 --> 00:53:41,311
But...

470
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:49,050
Why don't you let him

471
00:53:50,620 --> 00:53:51,808
live their lives as they please?

472
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,017
So how are you doing?

473
00:53:59,340 --> 00:54:01,400
I mean... are you all right?

474
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:02,573
How do you feel?

475
00:54:04,262 --> 00:54:04,890
I'm good.

476
00:54:06,991 --> 00:54:11,484
But there might be some times when...

477
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:17,470
when I think of something out of the blue.

478
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:25,115
Ah! I remember it!

479
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:27,680
Before the accident,

480
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,840
it seemed like you called
me to tell me something, right?

481
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,462
And it seemed like
you didn't get to tell me.

482
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:36,111
What was it?

483
00:54:40,170 --> 00:54:40,653
Hurry up.

484
00:54:41,290 --> 00:54:42,271
You've got such good memory.

485
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:50,880
I have a crush on my friend.

486
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:54,590
What?

487
00:54:55,630 --> 00:54:56,870
So why are you stressed out?

488
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:57,890
Is he a 7-year-old?

489
00:54:58,831 --> 00:55:00,470
That's not even a
thing, and it seems like...

490
00:55:01,742 --> 00:55:02,820
You're supposed to be happy, aren't you?

491
00:55:04,364 --> 00:55:06,071
It's not like that, unfortunately.

492
00:55:06,367 --> 00:55:06,700
How?

493
00:55:06,706 --> 00:55:09,404
My crush is with someone else.

494
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,150
One more thing...

495
00:55:13,306 --> 00:55:16,090
Her boyfriend is my senior peer.

496
00:55:21,013 --> 00:55:25,377
Jeed, are you telling me that your crush...

497
00:55:26,626 --> 00:55:27,440
Right.

498
00:55:29,173 --> 00:55:34,360
I think I like women now.

499
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:37,680
But I don't think it's the last decision.

500
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,244
It's kind of flexible.

501
00:55:42,410 --> 00:55:43,333
It doesn't matter, does it?

502
00:55:43,711 --> 00:55:45,142
You can tell me when
you're sure about that.

503
00:55:46,493 --> 00:55:51,591
But don't ruin their relationship, ok?

504
00:55:52,231 --> 00:55:52,511
Hmh?

505
00:55:55,004 --> 00:55:56,093
No, I won't.

506
00:55:59,648 --> 00:56:00,453
Do you mind it?

507
00:56:04,946 --> 00:56:06,217
Of course not. Why?

508
00:56:07,075 --> 00:56:07,937
I was just asking.

509
00:56:08,084 --> 00:56:08,800
Just in case.

510
00:56:09,980 --> 00:56:11,982
Hey! What makes you think I should mind?

511
00:56:12,493 --> 00:56:14,470
First, you're my sister.

512
00:56:14,470 --> 00:56:17,924
Second, you're ok with
me as well, aren't you?

513
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:21,928
Of course. I'm your good sister.

514
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:25,591
Give me your hand.

515
00:56:31,017 --> 00:56:34,915
Ouch! It hurts!

516
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:37,453
You just said you didn't like
me being cheesy, didn't you?

517
00:56:37,657 --> 00:56:38,940
You're doing it all yourself.

518
00:56:39,520 --> 00:56:41,311
Just once in a while!

519
00:56:41,980 --> 00:56:46,564
Besides, I've got only one good brother.

520
00:56:47,431 --> 00:56:48,791
Give me your hand.

521
00:56:57,311 --> 00:56:58,480
Thank you.

522
00:57:03,502 --> 00:57:04,217
Thank you, too.

523
00:57:12,871 --> 00:57:14,010
Get it! Get it!

524
00:57:14,404 --> 00:57:15,590
I want that one!

525
00:57:15,590 --> 00:57:16,690
- Get it!
- No!

526
00:57:25,528 --> 00:57:26,066
Jom!

527
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:28,866
Jom!

528
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:32,060
Jom!

529
00:58:29,813 --> 00:58:37,986
I miss you so much, Khun Yai.

530
00:59:38,870 --> 00:59:39,355
Uncle Tan.

531
00:59:40,982 --> 00:59:42,020
Hey, Mr. Jom!

532
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:42,740
Hello!

533
00:59:42,893 --> 00:59:43,448
Hello!

534
00:59:43,546 --> 00:59:44,691
It's been so long since we met each other.

535
00:59:45,017 --> 00:59:45,640
How are you doing?

536
00:59:45,902 --> 00:59:46,790
You're recovered, right?

537
00:59:47,620 --> 00:59:48,644
Yes, I am.

538
00:59:48,719 --> 00:59:50,088
So I'm back to work here.

539
00:59:50,460 --> 00:59:52,950
Oh my goodness!

540
00:59:53,710 --> 00:59:55,390
I was really agitated.

541
00:59:55,817 --> 00:59:56,950
I kept traveling around and praying,

542
00:59:57,186 --> 00:59:59,497
asking holy spirits to
bless and protect you.

543
01:00:00,137 --> 01:00:01,330
Thank you so much, Uncle Tan.

544
01:00:02,330 --> 01:00:05,391
They helped me a lot, I think.

545
01:00:07,470 --> 01:00:10,100
Well, I think...

546
01:00:10,626 --> 01:00:12,200
after you have undergone such misfortune,

547
01:00:12,792 --> 01:00:14,917
Why don't you see a sorcerer
to bring back your blessings?

548
01:00:15,675 --> 01:00:19,710
Hmh? Do you believe in the ceremony?

549
01:00:21,135 --> 01:00:25,477
Well, I can't say I fully believe it.

550
01:00:26,300 --> 01:00:29,644
It's an ancient belief among
some Northern people.

551
01:00:30,100 --> 01:00:32,568
They said we've got 32 blessings,

552
01:00:33,093 --> 01:00:36,370
which will protect us and
bring happiness to our lives.

553
01:00:36,826 --> 01:00:40,017
When we get sick or
undergo misfortune, as you did,

554
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:42,715
we should undertake such a ceremony
to bring the blessings back to you again.

555
01:00:43,653 --> 01:00:46,050
But when we die,

556
01:00:46,466 --> 01:00:50,760
our blessings will be reincarnated
in the form of our close relatives.

557
01:00:51,497 --> 01:00:53,090
That's why, when a baby is newly born,

558
01:00:53,226 --> 01:00:56,750
they tend to guess who
it was in the past life.

559
01:00:57,911 --> 01:00:58,800
Ah! That's right!

560
01:00:58,875 --> 01:01:00,266
I've heard of it as well.

561
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:04,200
I'm talking too much, I think.

562
01:01:05,324 --> 01:01:06,460
Not at all, Uncle.

563
01:01:06,893 --> 01:01:07,950
Well, Mr. Jom.

564
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:08,530
Yes?

565
01:01:10,302 --> 01:01:13,130
Someone has given you this thing.

566
01:01:16,650 --> 01:01:17,511
Who?

567
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:20,160
Well... the lady who owns the house.

568
01:01:21,981 --> 01:01:23,221
The key of a chest?

569
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:25,930
I don't know either.

570
01:01:26,432 --> 01:01:29,810
But she insisted that
I must give it to you.

571
01:01:32,927 --> 01:01:34,494
Well, Mr. Jom.

572
01:01:35,861 --> 01:01:37,560
I've got some strange
story to tell you.

573
01:01:39,072 --> 01:01:39,283
Yes.

574
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:43,173
Do you remember the first
time when we found the chest?

575
01:01:44,458 --> 01:01:44,727
Yes, I do.

576
01:01:45,283 --> 01:01:48,785
I had it moved to another room.

577
01:01:49,378 --> 01:01:52,323
But it was so heavy none of
the staff could carry it at all.

578
01:01:52,807 --> 01:01:55,720
So I wanted to get the stuff
inside out so that they could.

579
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:59,700
But I couldn't open it
with any of the keys I had.

580
01:02:00,927 --> 01:02:01,800
Do you think it's strange?

581
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,800
So where is the chest?

582
01:02:08,556 --> 01:02:09,287
In the same place, Mr. Jom.

583
01:02:10,127 --> 01:02:10,803
I don't want it to be moved now.

584
01:02:15,120 --> 01:02:16,570
By the way, excuse me for work.

585
01:03:32,923 --> 01:03:33,120
Eh?

586
01:03:35,338 --> 01:03:37,083
I can open it.

587
01:04:07,363 --> 01:04:10,316
The time of us has begun, Jom.

588
01:04:29,429 --> 01:04:30,290
Is everyone ready?

To my blessing Jom,

611
01:06:54,327 --> 01:06:57,240
When you get to see the
notes behind this portrait,

612
01:06:57,618 --> 01:06:59,700
I may have already passed away.

613
01:07:00,898 --> 01:07:01,890
But don't be sorrowful,

614
01:07:02,654 --> 01:07:04,843
for this is the way of life.

615
01:07:05,705 --> 01:07:09,250
After you are gone, I feel like a man
who has lost his blessings.

616
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:13,000
I have lost much of my consciousness
and the power to do anything.

617
01:07:14,207 --> 01:07:15,949
I never understood it when you had told me

618
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,500
before we parted

619
01:07:19,065 --> 01:07:21,356
that you would be waiting
for me at the little house

620
01:07:22,330 --> 01:07:26,240
until I saw these drawings.

621
01:07:26,716 --> 01:07:28,540
You deliberately drew them

622
01:07:29,305 --> 01:07:31,309
and left them here for me, right?

623
01:07:35,567 --> 01:07:36,054

Jom is gone.

But you're still here.

637
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,220
You have promised him.

638
01:08:20,221 --> 01:08:23,261

Khun Yai.

640
01:08:27,007 --> 01:08:29,770
I had got through the time
without you with such difficulty

641
01:08:30,429 --> 01:08:33,560
that my family decided to
hold a blessing ceremony for me again.

642
01:08:34,225 --> 01:08:36,629
I listened to those prayers
with my saddened heart,

643
01:08:37,060 --> 01:08:40,334
for it reminded me of the first time

644
01:08:40,941 --> 01:08:44,380
when I got to tie the holy threads
and listen to the prayers

645
01:08:44,920 --> 01:08:45,810
with you, Jom.

646
01:08:47,541 --> 01:08:49,581
It wasn't until I went to study abroad

647
01:08:49,950 --> 01:08:52,294
that my condition was gradually better,

648
01:08:52,767 --> 01:08:55,190
because I was reminded of the promise
I had made with you,

649
01:08:55,796 --> 01:08:57,750
that I would come back and make a change,

650
01:08:58,385 --> 01:09:01,410
more or less, as you had looked forward to.

651
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:05,538
When I was studying law in France,

652
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,356
I met a group of people who
shared the same thoughts.

653
01:09:09,790 --> 01:09:12,550
Although my role in their faculty

654
01:09:12,876 --> 01:09:14,730
might not have been so memorable,

655
01:09:15,109 --> 01:09:17,000
much less my personal identity,

656
01:09:17,327 --> 01:09:19,810
which was considered
to be controversial there,

657
01:09:20,421 --> 01:09:22,705
I felt proud that I met them.

658
01:09:23,934 --> 01:09:26,270
I have headed towards
the end of my life.

659
01:09:28,694 --> 01:09:32,356
Throughout the course
of my life, I have learnt

660
01:09:33,480 --> 01:09:37,345
that the current of time
always runs forward

661
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:39,380
without any retreat.

662
01:09:40,440 --> 01:09:43,700
With the matter of time, I
might already be your past,

663
01:09:44,520 --> 01:09:47,236
but, for me, you are my future.

664
01:09:48,803 --> 01:09:51,410
I'm still looking forward to
seeing you at the same place,

665
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:55,450
and I hope that someday we will
get back and spend our lives together.

666
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:59,261
