1
00:00:00,093 --> 00:00:01,180
(Previously)
I'm so glad

2
00:00:01,566 --> 00:00:04,746
to be here with you on
such a special night, Jom.

3
00:00:04,913 --> 00:00:05,720
Me too.

4
00:00:06,313 --> 00:00:08,060
My daughter, Busabong.

5
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:09,520
They have known each other for a long time.

6
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:11,600
You wouldn't mind

7
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:13,650
If we were to merge
our family trees, right?

8
00:00:14,066 --> 00:00:15,940
I beg you, Fong Kaew.

9
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:17,693
Please let Khamsaen go.

10
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:20,666
When my love and respect for you

11
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:23,113
doesn't make you love me at all,

12
00:00:23,326 --> 00:00:25,466
then I will never give
them to you any more.

13
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:26,820
Help!

14
00:00:27,173 --> 00:00:27,686
Jom!

15
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:29,000
Wake up, Jom!

16
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,480
Jom!

17
00:01:09,913 --> 00:01:10,520
Khun Yai,

18
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:15,880
- what brought me here?
- Jom.

19
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,086
Please stay silent for now.

20
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:20,380
Take a rest.

21
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:23,846
Are you awake?

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:24,713
Jom?

23
00:01:25,826 --> 00:01:26,800
Can you get up?

24
00:01:28,413 --> 00:01:30,926
Or do you me to get someone
else to wipe your body?

25
00:01:31,766 --> 00:01:32,466
That's fine, Prik.

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:33,700
I can do it.

27
00:01:34,526 --> 00:01:35,333
You needn't call for anybody else.

28
00:01:35,773 --> 00:01:37,106
You may go,

29
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:37,853
if you want.

30
00:01:38,606 --> 00:01:39,653
Well... yes, sir.

31
00:02:00,186 --> 00:02:03,780
Can you get up, Jom?

32
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:07,486
Please get up and take some medicine.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:09,433
Well...

34
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,946
Or do you prefer European medicine?

35
00:02:29,553 --> 00:02:30,440
No, thanks.

36
00:02:31,113 --> 00:02:32,906
I can take this.

37
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:29,660
- That's fine. I can take care of it.
- Jom,

38
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,253
I was the one who made you like this.

39
00:03:34,813 --> 00:03:37,960
Let me wipe your body, please.

40
00:05:03,586 --> 00:05:07,840
You look agitated
when I'm doing it for you.

41
00:05:12,093 --> 00:05:17,553
I just feel a bit strange.

42
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,506
Come on.

43
00:05:22,046 --> 00:05:23,680
You're my lover.

44
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:29,040
If you listen to me

45
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:31,120
and recover quickly,

46
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:33,746
I will take you to the cinema.

47
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:43,226
I'm not even a kid that would be
easily won over by something like that.

48
00:05:46,046 --> 00:05:51,366
If so, what should I do

49
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,166
to convince someone like you?

50
00:06:10,773 --> 00:06:12,560
Ooh! Ahem!

51
00:06:14,993 --> 00:06:15,733
What's wrong, Prik?

52
00:06:16,646 --> 00:06:19,000
I told you I can take care
of him myself, didn't I?

53
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,560
Well, I know.

54
00:06:23,093 --> 00:06:25,300
But a while ago I ran into Chan.

55
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:26,866
He told me

56
00:06:28,473 --> 00:06:31,926
that Khun Luang wants to
meet you as soon as possible.

57
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,900
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 9)

58
00:07:50,453 --> 00:07:51,793
Here comes Khun Yai, Khun Phra.

59
00:07:57,113 --> 00:07:57,646
Sit.

60
00:08:08,733 --> 00:08:11,373
What's going on, Father?

61
00:08:12,453 --> 00:08:13,926
Chan told me you've got some urgent matter.

62
00:08:17,488 --> 00:08:19,020
What on earth are you doing, Yai?

63
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:21,586
Me?

64
00:08:23,793 --> 00:08:23,980
Yes.

65
00:08:25,886 --> 00:08:27,840
Striving to leave the main house

66
00:08:29,233 --> 00:08:30,926
and moving into the guest's house alone,

67
00:08:31,573 --> 00:08:32,420
what do you think you're doing?

68
00:08:33,526 --> 00:08:37,080
Aparting from studying official
affairs as you commanded,

69
00:08:38,046 --> 00:08:39,153
I'm not doing anything.

70
00:08:39,866 --> 00:08:40,986
Don't talk back to me!

71
00:08:41,953 --> 00:08:43,160
I'm asking you!

72
00:08:45,546 --> 00:08:47,146
I was just informing you of the truth.

73
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:49,426
I didn't intend to talk back or anything.

74
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,820
If you've got something on your mind,

75
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,213
please let me know.

76
00:08:58,593 --> 00:08:58,900
All right.

77
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:02,040
If you want me to, I'll do it.

78
00:09:05,953 --> 00:09:09,066
What's going on between
you and your majordomo Jom?

79
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:12,733
I've had my person observe you for a while.

80
00:09:14,526 --> 00:09:15,206
Father!

81
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,360
You wanted me to ask
you frankly, didn't you?

82
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,946
When it comes to this,
I will tell you the truth.

83
00:09:39,239 --> 00:09:42,119
Jom and I, we love each other.

84
00:09:42,486 --> 00:09:44,680
Shame! How dare you say that shamelessly?!

85
00:09:46,153 --> 00:09:47,510
I've got nothing to be ashamed of.

86
00:09:48,006 --> 00:09:49,040
Why not?!

87
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,646
This truth of yours is very
shameless and embarrassing!

88
00:09:53,326 --> 00:09:54,880
What if other people knew

89
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,160
that the son of the newly-appointed lord

90
00:09:58,706 --> 00:09:59,926
turns out to be a sodomite?!

91
00:10:01,413 --> 00:10:04,513
Do you ever think what your
mother and I would do? Huh?!

92
00:10:06,093 --> 00:10:07,613
There's nothing you and she
should be concerned about.

93
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:10,180
I understand.

94
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,473
Jom and I never do
anything explicit in public.

95
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:21,740
Yai, you know, right?

96
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:24,250
What has our family had been through?

97
00:10:24,486 --> 00:10:27,880
It wasn't easy to get us
over to this point at all.

98
00:10:29,493 --> 00:10:32,650
And now you're doing something
without caring for the others.

99
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:33,688
It's wrong!

100
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,025
How about my desires?

101
00:10:38,618 --> 00:10:39,347
Can I ever do what I want?

102
00:10:40,766 --> 00:10:41,890
Back then,

103
00:10:42,787 --> 00:10:44,341
when I asked for your
permission to study abroad,

104
00:10:44,951 --> 00:10:45,974
you turned it down.

105
00:10:46,618 --> 00:10:47,469
Or, when I was young,

106
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:50,172
I had to follow every path you drew for me.

107
00:10:51,023 --> 00:10:51,894
And now, this.

108
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:55,343
Can I do what I want?

109
00:10:55,515 --> 00:10:56,231
Can I?!

110
00:10:56,484 --> 00:10:57,027
Yai!

111
00:11:01,355 --> 00:11:03,423
I knew you would never listen.

112
00:11:08,336 --> 00:11:11,191
But, from now on, if
you want to do anything

113
00:11:11,941 --> 00:11:12,635
serve yourself, then.

114
00:11:17,768 --> 00:11:19,250
I will spend all of my time

115
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:22,901
only on what I want to do as well.

116
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:30,138
Yai!

117
00:11:51,738 --> 00:11:52,206
Who's that?

118
00:12:04,463 --> 00:12:05,364
I asked who is that?!

119
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:20,867
Oh! Khun Eeang Peung!

120
00:12:22,021 --> 00:12:22,872
It's me!

121
00:12:25,094 --> 00:12:26,682
I've got something to talk over with you.

122
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,740
May I come inside?

123
00:12:47,326 --> 00:12:49,456
What has he done with
you, Khun Eeang Peung?

124
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:52,635
What do you want to do?

125
00:12:53,195 --> 00:12:55,018
Has he sent you here?

126
00:12:59,381 --> 00:13:00,134
No.

127
00:13:01,338 --> 00:13:03,566
It has nothing to do with him.

128
00:13:06,066 --> 00:13:08,666
I know that, previously,

129
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:12,311
whatever I have done to you

130
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:14,989
has made it hard for you to trust me.

131
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:22,260
But today I'm here to apologize to you,
Khun Eeang Peung.

132
00:13:26,212 --> 00:13:26,776
Apologize?

133
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:30,644
Yes.

134
00:13:33,524 --> 00:13:37,355
I got it wrong that you and your husband

135
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:39,290
would not be that different.

136
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:42,275
But, seeing him treat you like this,

137
00:13:43,885 --> 00:13:48,085
I've seen you in a new light.

138
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:59,720
Fong Kaew, I'm not that
different from Robert, actually.

139
00:14:03,473 --> 00:14:07,173
What do you mean, Khun Eeang Peung?

140
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:15,306
I had know that he was all about you,

141
00:14:18,326 --> 00:14:21,593
ever since we visited
your parents' tailor shop.

142
00:14:23,506 --> 00:14:27,573
But I never opposed him,

143
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:33,393
because I was selfish, Fong Kaew.

144
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:38,046
I thought that letting you
in would help me survive

145
00:14:38,213 --> 00:14:40,613
from my suffering from being his wife.

146
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,166
I'm sorry, Fong Kaew.

147
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:49,973
I'm sorry.

148
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:54,626
Khun Eeang Peung.

149
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:01,633
For me, you're not a bad person.

150
00:15:03,006 --> 00:15:06,506
It's just that you've been
oppessed by him, just like me.

151
00:15:08,913 --> 00:15:10,313
We are women.

152
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:13,520
We just have to fight.

153
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:21,853
Anyway, I'm here today

154
00:15:23,013 --> 00:15:24,700
because I want to ask you something.

155
00:15:26,226 --> 00:15:26,960
What's that?

156
00:15:29,713 --> 00:15:33,653
I knew he had my house set on fire,

157
00:15:34,340 --> 00:15:35,760
causing my father to
pass to the other side.

158
00:15:37,060 --> 00:15:38,320
Do you know this?

159
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,026
What do you mean, Fong Kaew?

160
00:15:42,433 --> 00:15:44,806
I just knew that your house
had been burned down,

161
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,460
so you had to move here

162
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,635
in order to financially
support your family.

163
00:15:49,675 --> 00:15:51,195
What do you mean, Fong Kaew?

164
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:56,341
That's fine. I knew it.

165
00:15:56,934 --> 00:15:58,231
I knew that you should not know it.

166
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,818
But now, my concern...

167
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,865
it's that I've got to find proof.

168
00:16:06,867 --> 00:16:08,294
That's how I can rescue you.

169
00:16:09,814 --> 00:16:11,145
So how do you do it?

170
00:16:11,650 --> 00:16:12,720
Can I give you a hand?

171
00:16:13,818 --> 00:16:15,061
It won't be good if you know
about this issue too much.

172
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:18,134
He would become
suspicious. Please believe me.

173
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:55,768
Jom...

174
00:17:04,315 --> 00:17:07,098
Jom, please sleep a little longer.

175
00:17:10,214 --> 00:17:14,050
What's wrong, Khun Yai?

176
00:17:15,094 --> 00:17:20,097
It seems like you've got
something on your mind.

177
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:28,657
No.

178
00:17:30,768 --> 00:17:34,813
Today Father had me
look over some case files.

179
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:45,088
I thought you would have
had some quarrel with him.

180
00:17:46,986 --> 00:17:48,293
I saw the agitated look on your face.

181
00:17:54,897 --> 00:17:58,777
You were peeping at me again, Jom?

182
00:18:01,884 --> 00:18:02,520
Well...

183
00:18:17,462 --> 00:18:17,924
Jom,

184
00:18:22,355 --> 00:18:23,937
are you happy,

185
00:18:25,413 --> 00:18:27,137
living with me in this house?

186
00:18:34,671 --> 00:18:38,568
Of course. I'm very happy.

187
00:18:40,022 --> 00:18:42,777
Everyone has been nice to me here,

188
00:18:44,888 --> 00:18:45,751
especially you.

189
00:18:57,115 --> 00:19:01,456
So, are you so happy that
you want to live with me here forever?

190
00:19:11,871 --> 00:19:13,777
Actually, it's me who should ask you

191
00:19:16,888 --> 00:19:21,512
if you want to be here for good.

192
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,504
I love you, Jom.

193
00:19:27,064 --> 00:19:30,436
So I must certainly want
my lover to be with me.

194
00:19:35,501 --> 00:19:40,145
Hmh? So can I ask you something?

195
00:19:43,821 --> 00:19:49,833
When did you realize that you loved me?

196
00:19:51,613 --> 00:19:51,873
Hmh...

197
00:20:01,482 --> 00:20:05,200
At the very first time I saw you.

198
00:20:06,503 --> 00:20:08,047
I knew that you were the one,

199
00:20:11,237 --> 00:20:12,555
the one I had been waiting for so long.

200
00:20:15,002 --> 00:20:16,677
Huh?

201
00:20:18,635 --> 00:20:23,280
Love at first sight?

202
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:36,400
It seems like I have been
loving you for so long,

203
00:20:38,763 --> 00:20:39,512
knowing that I have loved you

204
00:20:41,789 --> 00:20:44,240
even before I met you on that day.

205
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:59,600
Don't you feel the same?

206
00:21:08,123 --> 00:21:15,054
Certainly. I feel exactly the same.

207
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:53,076
Jom!

208
00:22:05,781 --> 00:22:06,400
Jom!

209
00:22:08,356 --> 00:22:08,938
Jom!

210
00:22:09,585 --> 00:22:10,967
I'm in here, Khun Yai!

211
00:22:17,883 --> 00:22:18,509
Jom!

212
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,356
Are you recovered?

213
00:22:29,650 --> 00:22:30,487
Yes, I am.

214
00:22:31,087 --> 00:22:32,480
I already told you

215
00:22:33,003 --> 00:22:34,465
that it wasn't a thing.

216
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,323
It's true.

217
00:22:59,752 --> 00:23:01,250
Your temperature is
not as high as yesterday.

218
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:05,789
So,

219
00:23:06,734 --> 00:23:08,480
why didn't you tell me in the morning?

220
00:23:08,838 --> 00:23:10,552
I walked to the main house

221
00:23:10,887 --> 00:23:12,680
in order to bring you some breakfast.

222
00:23:14,370 --> 00:23:16,647
I'm sorry.

223
00:23:16,727 --> 00:23:21,710
When I woke up, I didn't see you there.

224
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:26,028
So I thought you would have
been out for work with Khun Phra.

225
00:23:28,436 --> 00:23:30,044
Today I'm not going out.

226
00:23:31,828 --> 00:23:33,232
I'm spending all day with you.

227
00:23:35,584 --> 00:23:36,080
Really?

228
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:45,600
So would you like to bathe with me?

229
00:23:49,306 --> 00:23:49,768
Of course.

230
00:24:19,706 --> 00:24:22,631
Khun Yai, you don't have to teach me now.

231
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,471
I'm good at it now.

232
00:24:26,675 --> 00:24:28,586
I'm not trying to teach you anything.

233
00:24:30,382 --> 00:24:36,933
I just want to touch my lover's hands.

234
00:24:40,993 --> 00:24:41,743
Huh?

235
00:24:50,951 --> 00:24:51,768
Yai.

236
00:24:53,402 --> 00:24:57,367
I've made you a croissant.

237
00:24:58,269 --> 00:25:00,516
Uncle said that you should like it.

238
00:25:04,189 --> 00:25:05,047
My father?

239
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:11,280
Thank you so much, Busabong.

240
00:25:13,032 --> 00:25:15,345
But you shouldn't have
brought it to me here yourself.

241
00:25:16,523 --> 00:25:18,887
That's not such a big deal, Yai.

242
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:23,010
By the way, what are you doing?

243
00:25:24,276 --> 00:25:27,178
And who's that?

244
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:30,261
Do I know him?

245
00:25:32,174 --> 00:25:32,901
This is Jom.

246
00:25:34,036 --> 00:25:35,112
He is...

247
00:25:39,425 --> 00:25:43,090
Ugh, he is my majordomo.

248
00:25:45,890 --> 00:25:48,269
Ah! Jom!

249
00:25:48,989 --> 00:25:50,263
My name is Busabong.

250
00:25:51,236 --> 00:25:53,836
Well, you can eat my croissant.

251
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,366
I don't mind it.

252
00:25:59,220 --> 00:25:59,843
Thank you.

253
00:26:02,913 --> 00:26:04,683
Have you got anything else, Busabong?

254
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:07,840
Now I'm working.

255
00:26:09,296 --> 00:26:10,410
No, I haven't.

256
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:14,186
So, excuse me.

257
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,846
See you later, Yai.

258
00:26:17,420 --> 00:26:17,620
Yes.

259
00:26:26,110 --> 00:26:26,283
Check!

260
00:26:27,423 --> 00:26:28,000
Wow!

261
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,886
Let me ask you frankly,

262
00:26:36,743 --> 00:26:38,510
Won't you really enter
the partnership with me?

263
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:45,134
I think it will help you
expand your business

264
00:26:45,238 --> 00:26:46,361
and your power.

265
00:26:49,878 --> 00:26:52,314
I want to consider it after the
engagement ceremony, Brother Dech.

266
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,850
But I'm still concerned about that issue.

267
00:26:57,505 --> 00:27:00,342
Why don't we talk
about it after I feel better?

268
00:27:01,321 --> 00:27:03,354
All right. Fine.

269
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:09,510
I don't expect you to give
me an answer right now.

270
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,160
And when it comes to
Yai's issue, don't worry.

271
00:27:14,273 --> 00:27:16,575
It's coming soon.

272
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:18,689
Yes.

273
00:27:25,172 --> 00:27:25,852
Father!

274
00:27:27,293 --> 00:27:30,367
Hey! You're back from
the house, aren't you?

275
00:27:31,632 --> 00:27:33,138
How quickly!

276
00:27:34,109 --> 00:27:34,494
Yeah.

277
00:27:35,014 --> 00:27:37,101
Yai was getting busy with his work,

278
00:27:37,498 --> 00:27:39,563
so I didn't really want to disturb him.

279
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:42,254
Was he busy, Busabong?

280
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:44,243
Yes, he was.

281
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,960
He was having his majordomo

282
00:27:48,389 --> 00:27:51,294
type some paperwork or something like that.

283
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:59,680
By the way, it seems like

284
00:28:00,184 --> 00:28:03,132
he still doesn't know about
the upcoming engagement.

285
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,024
Busabong!

286
00:28:08,373 --> 00:28:09,657
Don't worry, Busabong.

287
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,200
Soon...

288
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,902
he will know about it.

289
00:28:30,484 --> 00:28:31,586
Well, Mother,

290
00:28:32,573 --> 00:28:35,271
will there be another event at our home?

291
00:28:36,071 --> 00:28:38,577
Why do I have to get my measurements
done and a new suit made?

292
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:43,954
There will be an auspicious ceremony, Yai.

293
00:28:45,232 --> 00:28:45,974
What will it be now?

294
00:28:46,486 --> 00:28:47,510
Why wasn't I informed?

295
00:28:49,064 --> 00:28:49,680
Well...

296
00:28:50,824 --> 00:28:53,111
Girls, get out,

297
00:28:53,435 --> 00:28:54,397
and I'll call you back later on.

298
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:03,514
This ceremony has a
lot to do with you, Yai.

299
00:29:04,931 --> 00:29:05,585
Does it?

300
00:29:07,634 --> 00:29:12,716
Father thinks it's about time.

301
00:29:12,775 --> 00:29:14,059
That's why he is holding it for you.

302
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:18,650
So why don't you tell me now?

303
00:29:19,113 --> 00:29:19,986
Please don't beat around the bush.

304
00:29:21,071 --> 00:29:21,714
Well...

305
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:25,426
Well...

306
00:29:27,516 --> 00:29:29,707
That auspicious ceremony...

307
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:34,250
It's the engagement ceremony
for you and Busabong.

308
00:29:38,378 --> 00:29:42,789
For me?

309
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:45,600
Yes, son.

310
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:48,112
Well, Father...

311
00:29:48,496 --> 00:29:50,416
he's got everything ready.

312
00:29:52,741 --> 00:29:56,165
So why did nobody tell me about it?

313
00:30:03,274 --> 00:30:07,168
Yai, it's just like I told you.

314
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:10,064
Father,

315
00:30:10,746 --> 00:30:12,752
he has seen it's about time

316
00:30:14,213 --> 00:30:15,797
that you got married.

317
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:25,557
So has anybody ever asked me if I want to?

318
00:30:29,829 --> 00:30:31,562
Or whatever he thinks is good,

319
00:30:32,602 --> 00:30:33,658
you just agree with him, don't you?!

320
00:30:37,088 --> 00:30:38,261
How about me, then?

321
00:30:39,962 --> 00:30:41,856
I will have to end up
like Eeang Peung, right?!

322
00:30:46,826 --> 00:30:47,397
Yai!

323
00:30:58,069 --> 00:30:58,544
Well...

324
00:31:03,072 --> 00:31:05,754
Tell the two girls to get in here, Prik.

325
00:31:47,626 --> 00:31:48,213
Khun Yai,

326
00:31:50,064 --> 00:31:50,981
what's wrong?

327
00:31:52,042 --> 00:31:53,024
Are you worried about you work?

328
00:31:55,808 --> 00:31:56,936
Just a bit, Jom.

329
00:32:00,149 --> 00:32:01,725
Now Father's work...

330
00:32:05,453 --> 00:32:06,629
is a lot bigger and harder.

331
00:32:10,037 --> 00:32:11,269
I'm afraid

332
00:32:12,557 --> 00:32:13,898
that I can no longer do it.

333
00:32:16,362 --> 00:32:17,018
Hmh?

334
00:32:18,544 --> 00:32:22,730
But you've been doing it so
well all along, haven't you?

335
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:28,417
And the reason you
have studying the affairs

336
00:32:28,455 --> 00:32:33,568
is that you aim to serve the government
like your father, right?

337
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:37,584
That's not what I dream of, actually.

338
00:32:40,372 --> 00:32:42,616
But it's been his alone.

339
00:32:44,804 --> 00:32:49,797
I had another dream.

340
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,256
So why don't you tell me?

341
00:32:55,722 --> 00:32:56,654
What was it?

342
00:32:57,844 --> 00:32:58,056
Hmh...

343
00:33:04,201 --> 00:33:05,829
I wanted to study in France.

344
00:33:08,295 --> 00:33:10,153
I heard from my friends
at the Puttyuban Bar

345
00:33:11,885 --> 00:33:15,846
that there are many
thinkers and writers there.

346
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:24,805
And there are strikes and debates

347
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,529
by those who think
differently from each side.

348
00:33:31,781 --> 00:33:33,520
So I wanted to experience it,

349
00:33:34,895 --> 00:33:36,156
myself for once.

350
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,540
Hmh...

351
00:33:43,753 --> 00:33:46,252
But when I told Father about this,

352
00:33:48,116 --> 00:33:49,203
he turned it down,

353
00:33:50,793 --> 00:33:53,015
for he didn't really agree to it.

354
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:56,966
He wanted to me to work
for the government here

355
00:33:58,266 --> 00:34:02,320
and inherit the dignity he
has built up for his whole life

356
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:04,315
for our family.

357
00:34:17,524 --> 00:34:18,960
But now my dream has changed

358
00:34:21,872 --> 00:34:25,703
ever since I met you.

359
00:34:31,632 --> 00:34:32,268
Hmh?

360
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:35,435
How?

361
00:34:36,531 --> 00:34:38,578
I can contine to work for the state here

362
00:34:41,421 --> 00:34:42,988
as long as I have you by my side.

363
00:34:44,894 --> 00:34:46,258
It doesn't matter if my
dream will be smaller,

364
00:34:48,256 --> 00:34:54,261
as long as I get to live
my life with someone I love.

365
00:35:00,186 --> 00:35:01,248
That's all I ask.

366
00:35:14,421 --> 00:35:18,106
Who is this cute man?

367
00:35:20,602 --> 00:35:21,653
Your lover, certainly.

368
00:35:43,648 --> 00:35:44,016
Wait!

369
00:35:44,261 --> 00:35:44,565
Ugh!

370
00:35:45,242 --> 00:35:47,242
Khun Lek! Woah!

371
00:35:49,002 --> 00:35:49,820
Khun Lek,

372
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,740
according to the rules, we're
just supposed to compete

373
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:57,480
until any of us reaches the
finish line first, aren't we?

374
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,565
Why are you spinning
it to and fro like this?

375
00:36:00,937 --> 00:36:03,260
I just want to keep playing it like this.

376
00:36:05,871 --> 00:36:07,094
Are you tired now, Jom?

377
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:11,631
Yeah.

378
00:36:12,194 --> 00:36:14,014
Are you that tired?

379
00:36:16,268 --> 00:36:20,170
You can say that. You're
still a little boy, aren't you?

380
00:36:22,102 --> 00:36:25,020
Fine. So let's do something else.

381
00:36:28,129 --> 00:36:29,478
Thanks.

382
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,228
But... what should we do?

383
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:39,527
Hmhhh...

384
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:42,057
Can you draw me something, Jom?

385
00:36:42,586 --> 00:36:44,083
It's been so long since you did it.

386
00:36:45,893 --> 00:36:46,575
Yes, I can.

387
00:36:47,558 --> 00:36:49,055
It'll be less tiring.

388
00:36:49,653 --> 00:36:53,916
So what would you like
me to draw, Khun Lek?

389
00:36:55,628 --> 00:36:56,664
Hmhhh...

390
00:36:59,044 --> 00:37:00,216
Brother Yai.

391
00:37:00,620 --> 00:37:01,944
I want to give it to him as a present.

392
00:37:02,696 --> 00:37:03,664
On what occasion?

393
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:07,304
On his engagement with Busabong.

394
00:37:07,956 --> 00:37:08,580
Khun Lek!

395
00:37:11,044 --> 00:37:13,396
Khun Yai ordered us
not to tell this to Jom.

396
00:37:14,064 --> 00:37:14,848
Don't you remember it?

397
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:24,960
Forget it, Jom.

398
00:37:25,396 --> 00:37:27,104
He was just talking nonsense as a kid.

399
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:28,850
It's nothing.

400
00:37:28,856 --> 00:37:29,712
Is it true?

401
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:34,232
Auntie Prik.

402
00:37:44,987 --> 00:37:45,597
Jom!

403
00:37:46,228 --> 00:37:47,128
Where are you going, Jom?!

404
00:37:47,401 --> 00:37:47,688
Hold on!

405
00:37:49,325 --> 00:37:51,625
Khun Lek, please wait for me right here.

406
00:37:52,237 --> 00:37:52,529
Please.

407
00:37:55,032 --> 00:37:55,755
Jom!

408
00:37:56,465 --> 00:37:57,171
Wait for me!

409
00:37:57,190 --> 00:37:57,997
Jom!

410
00:37:58,428 --> 00:37:58,830
Ouch!

411
00:38:01,376 --> 00:38:02,383
Where is Khun Yai, Auntie?

412
00:38:04,472 --> 00:38:08,826
He was ordered by Khun Phra
for the preparation at the main house.

413
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,280
Why?

414
00:38:27,568 --> 00:38:28,821
Why does it turn out like this again?

415
00:38:31,637 --> 00:38:33,301
Why does this keep happening to me?

416
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:35,754
What do you mean, Jom,

417
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,740
when you said something
like this happened to you?

418
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,242
No matter where I am,

419
00:38:42,032 --> 00:38:45,156
my life has always ended up like this.

420
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:48,967
I don't get it.

421
00:38:50,483 --> 00:38:51,578
I'm tired, Auntie Prik.

422
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:56,960
Did I do something wrong?

423
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:57,260
No.

424
00:38:57,260 --> 00:38:57,486
No, you're not wrong.

425
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:58,870
Calm down, Jom.

426
00:39:48,698 --> 00:39:49,356
How are you doing, Jom?

427
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:52,289
Khun Phra!

428
00:39:55,538 --> 00:39:57,981
You're making it as if
seeing a ghost or something!

429
00:39:59,064 --> 00:40:00,624
I'm sorry.

430
00:40:01,166 --> 00:40:01,966
I didn't intend to.

431
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,015
Are you waiting for Yai?

432
00:40:12,698 --> 00:40:13,169
No, I'm not.

433
00:40:13,243 --> 00:40:16,510
I've got something on my mind,

434
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:17,040
so I'm...

435
00:40:19,317 --> 00:40:20,730
You've known everything, right?

436
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,670
It's not too hard for a wise man like you

437
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,158
to guess what I'm talking about.

438
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:37,542
Yes, sir.

439
00:40:38,193 --> 00:40:39,920
So, I'm getting to the point.

440
00:40:42,578 --> 00:40:43,719
I want you

441
00:40:43,778 --> 00:40:45,856
to slowly end your relationship with Yai.

442
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:52,940
Khun Phra...

443
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:56,181
I know that you might see me

444
00:40:56,233 --> 00:40:58,650
as a person as mean
and heartless as Yai said.

445
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,800
I just want my son to live a normal life,

446
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:08,672
have a family, and pass on our heritage
to his descendants.

447
00:41:11,728 --> 00:41:13,770
You know right, Jom?

448
00:41:14,525 --> 00:41:16,912
You will be his weak
point in the future to come.

449
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,613
You two might despise me today,

450
00:41:22,208 --> 00:41:23,365
but when times passes,

451
00:41:24,594 --> 00:41:29,204
you will understand the matters of life
and my demands better.

452
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:31,852
I don't mind if you will hate me,

453
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:35,300
but I can never see my own son

454
00:41:35,504 --> 00:41:36,696
fall down to pieces right before me!

455
00:41:44,212 --> 00:41:45,288
Please, Jom.

456
00:42:22,764 --> 00:42:25,208
You came here at the right him, Jom.

457
00:42:27,032 --> 00:42:29,000
Do you remember it when I asked you

458
00:42:29,336 --> 00:42:31,080
about you and Khun Yai?

459
00:42:31,608 --> 00:42:33,560
So can you answer me now?

460
00:42:42,836 --> 00:42:46,440
Ming, would you hate me

461
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,720
if the answer is...

462
00:42:51,643 --> 00:42:53,269
I saw it.

463
00:42:55,829 --> 00:42:56,916
You know what?

464
00:42:57,780 --> 00:43:00,248
Maey and Khun Eeang Peung,

465
00:43:01,466 --> 00:43:03,230
they are not different from
you and Khun Yai at all.

466
00:43:08,459 --> 00:43:10,651
What do you mean, Ming?

467
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,752
Maey and Khun Eeang Peung,

468
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:20,546
they were caught having an
affair by the foreign master.

469
00:43:20,689 --> 00:43:21,040
What?

470
00:43:23,525 --> 00:43:24,656
Seriously?

471
00:43:27,917 --> 00:43:31,489
So how are they doing now?

472
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,846
Now they're just as twisted
up as you and Khun Yai.

473
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:52,240
And you?

474
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:54,240
Me?

475
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:57,604
I'm just heartbroken!

476
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:04,632
Even so,

477
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:11,580
it's not so much as Maey,
Khun Eeang Peung, Khun Yai,

478
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:13,614
and you feel.

479
00:44:17,084 --> 00:44:20,912
At first, I didn't really understand
the sort of love you've got.

480
00:44:23,118 --> 00:44:26,601
But when I saw everyone I love in pain,

481
00:44:27,476 --> 00:44:29,380
I couldn't help feeling the same.

482
00:44:41,916 --> 00:44:42,360
Jom,

483
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:46,710
maybe he doesn't want to do

484
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:48,122
what he's doing right now.

485
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,748
Come on! Drink up!

486
00:44:53,825 --> 00:44:56,780
Hey, enough!

487
00:44:58,348 --> 00:44:59,374
Just drink it up!

488
00:45:02,514 --> 00:45:03,262
Jom! Ming!

489
00:45:05,262 --> 00:45:07,200
Hey, Fong Kaew.

490
00:45:09,971 --> 00:45:11,714
I need your help.

491
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:49,452
Pan!

492
00:45:49,452 --> 00:45:49,850
Woah!

493
00:45:50,192 --> 00:45:52,680
Ming! I was all shocked!

494
00:45:56,978 --> 00:45:57,936
What's that bottle?

495
00:45:58,816 --> 00:46:02,691
Whiskey, the one the
foreign master likes to drink.

496
00:46:02,840 --> 00:46:03,897
Don't you remember?

497
00:46:05,102 --> 00:46:05,667
Yes, I do!

498
00:46:06,410 --> 00:46:07,950
But why are you giving it to me?

499
00:46:08,597 --> 00:46:10,422
It's the master's, isn't it?

500
00:46:11,497 --> 00:46:12,480
If he ever finds out,

501
00:46:13,085 --> 00:46:15,370
we will be whipped to death!

502
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:18,760
Come on! This is not his, Pan.

503
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,664
I got it from my friend.
Don't you want to try?

504
00:46:22,999 --> 00:46:25,943
Here you go.

505
00:46:26,814 --> 00:46:27,130
Come on! Here you go!

506
00:46:31,014 --> 00:46:32,229
Hey, no!

507
00:46:32,952 --> 00:46:34,712
I have to watch over
Maey until the sun rises.

508
00:46:35,294 --> 00:46:37,276
I'll be screwed if I get drunk.

509
00:46:38,134 --> 00:46:39,381
So, no. You drink it yourself.

510
00:46:39,923 --> 00:46:42,123
Bruh! What's wrong with you, Pan?

511
00:46:42,505 --> 00:46:45,887
Such a good thing doesn't come to us often!

512
00:46:46,658 --> 00:46:49,673
One more thing, I haven't
even seen the foreign master

513
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,249
pay a visit to Maey at all.

514
00:46:51,738 --> 00:46:53,189
And she can't get out herself, right?

515
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:57,734
If we keep our mouths
shut, how would he know?

516
00:46:58,413 --> 00:46:58,755
Right?

517
00:47:11,111 --> 00:47:11,453
Yeah.

518
00:47:16,642 --> 00:47:16,948
Ming!

519
00:47:20,544 --> 00:47:21,004
Ming!

520
00:47:27,206 --> 00:47:27,757
Ming!

521
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:29,855
I told you to get Pan drunk,

522
00:47:29,855 --> 00:47:31,025
not yourself!

523
00:47:34,168 --> 00:47:35,062
Where's the key?

524
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:37,531
Hmhhh...

525
00:47:41,206 --> 00:47:42,252
Such a lightweight.

526
00:47:43,270 --> 00:47:44,837
Yeah, Ming!

527
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:48,080
Yeah!

528
00:47:51,473 --> 00:47:51,988
The keys...

529
00:47:53,271 --> 00:47:54,030
The keys...

530
00:47:55,335 --> 00:47:56,256
The keys...

531
00:47:57,086 --> 00:47:57,809
Such a lightweight.

532
00:48:01,304 --> 00:48:01,848
Follow me.

533
00:48:05,052 --> 00:48:05,799
You lightweight.

534
00:48:17,241 --> 00:48:17,702
Maey!

535
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:23,685
Maey!

536
00:48:24,055 --> 00:48:24,441
Maey!

537
00:48:25,630 --> 00:48:26,140
Maey!

538
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:30,320
How did you end up in such a sorry state?

539
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:32,402
Ming.

540
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:34,540
Fong Kaew.

541
00:48:35,628 --> 00:48:36,822
How come you got in here?

542
00:48:37,095 --> 00:48:39,420
What if the foreign master sees us?

543
00:48:39,705 --> 00:48:40,774
Nobody will at this time.

544
00:48:42,016 --> 00:48:43,957
Ming, take Maey to the pier right now.

545
00:48:44,635 --> 00:48:45,974
The boat man is waiting there.

546
00:48:46,357 --> 00:48:46,920
Let's go.

547
00:48:47,141 --> 00:48:47,640
Where?

548
00:48:48,619 --> 00:48:49,648
Where are you taking me?

549
00:48:51,049 --> 00:48:53,853
You will be staying at my home.

550
00:48:54,020 --> 00:48:55,123
I've told my mom.

551
00:48:55,972 --> 00:48:58,066
How about Khun Eeang Peung?

552
00:48:59,286 --> 00:49:00,893
Are you taking her with us as well?

553
00:49:01,899 --> 00:49:03,332
You should care about yourself first.

554
00:49:04,194 --> 00:49:06,688
She will be fine.

555
00:49:07,711 --> 00:49:11,043
At least, she's the daughter of Khun Luang.

556
00:49:12,208 --> 00:49:13,364
But you, Maey,

557
00:49:13,764 --> 00:49:16,832
who would care if anything happened to you?

558
00:49:17,210 --> 00:49:17,730
Right?

559
00:49:20,320 --> 00:49:21,000
Fong Kaew,

560
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:24,770
could you please help Khun Eeang Peung out?

561
00:49:25,549 --> 00:49:27,363
Please, I beg you.

562
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:31,530
Please don't resent her.

563
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:37,458
She did it out of necessity.

564
00:49:38,778 --> 00:49:39,200
Please.

565
00:49:39,258 --> 00:49:40,414
I understand, Maey.

566
00:49:41,589 --> 00:49:44,090
But now you've got to leave here first.

567
00:49:44,989 --> 00:49:47,192
Ming, take her to the pier.

568
00:49:47,498 --> 00:49:47,694
Let's go.

569
00:49:48,076 --> 00:49:48,669
Let's go, Maey.

570
00:49:49,850 --> 00:49:51,360
Maey, slowly get up.

571
00:49:54,414 --> 00:49:56,887
Fong Kaew, can I ask you to help Maey out?

572
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:00,796
I'm really worried about her.

573
00:50:02,643 --> 00:50:04,418
Please rescue her, Fong Kaew.

574
00:50:05,177 --> 00:50:09,180
I promise I will help you two.

575
00:50:19,892 --> 00:50:21,467
Maey, please stay at Fong Kaew's house

576
00:50:21,730 --> 00:50:23,330
and take care of
yourself until you recover.

577
00:50:23,860 --> 00:50:27,218
Don't worry about Khun Eeang Peung.

578
00:50:27,455 --> 00:50:28,876
I'll keep an eye on here.

579
00:50:30,707 --> 00:50:36,560
Ming, why are you rescuing me

580
00:50:37,902 --> 00:50:42,631
when I already turned you down?

581
00:50:45,006 --> 00:50:46,940
It's your feelings.

582
00:50:48,518 --> 00:50:51,606
I can't force you to love me, can I?

583
00:50:54,003 --> 00:50:55,292
But I help you

584
00:50:56,691 --> 00:50:59,008
because I love you.

585
00:51:03,609 --> 00:51:05,817
I cannot stand seeing my loved one

586
00:51:06,556 --> 00:51:08,227
suffering like this.

587
00:51:30,537 --> 00:51:31,257
Thank you.

588
00:51:33,321 --> 00:51:35,380
You will be my best friend,

589
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:38,848
always.

590
00:52:09,481 --> 00:52:10,176
See you, Ming.

591
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:02,153
What the hell is wrong with you?!

592
00:53:02,297 --> 00:53:03,395
How come you let her escape?!

593
00:53:04,873 --> 00:53:07,731
I really didn't know what happened!

594
00:53:08,924 --> 00:53:12,836
I remember drinking whiskey here

595
00:53:13,708 --> 00:53:14,588
and falling asleep immediately.

596
00:53:17,736 --> 00:53:21,060
You left a guilty servant out!

597
00:53:21,980 --> 00:53:23,556
You must be punished for this!

598
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:27,780
From now on, you take
her place in the dark prison

599
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:33,840
until I see fit to let
you see the sunlight again!

600
00:53:35,352 --> 00:53:36,895
Please don't do this to me, Master!

601
00:53:37,299 --> 00:53:39,314
I've got my family to feed.

602
00:53:40,365 --> 00:53:44,438
Without me, who else would
be there for them, Master?

603
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,740
That's not my concern!

604
00:53:51,315 --> 00:53:52,092
Master.

605
00:53:52,854 --> 00:53:53,571
What now, Ming?

606
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,120
Please don't punish Pan.

607
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:04,115
I was the one who asked
him to drink with me.

608
00:54:12,768 --> 00:54:15,640
The longer you're here,
the more ungrateful you are.

609
00:54:15,798 --> 00:54:18,020
I think it's about time

610
00:54:18,070 --> 00:54:19,900
you and your mom were
kicked out of this house!

611
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:22,678
Sir,

612
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:25,388
please don't do that to him.

613
00:54:25,862 --> 00:54:28,556
Ming and Maen have served
you for such a long time.

614
00:54:29,075 --> 00:54:32,524
Please consider their
loyalty from the very first day.

615
00:54:33,763 --> 00:54:35,753
Get your hands off me!

616
00:54:39,222 --> 00:54:42,700
You and your mom go pack
your things and leave my house!

617
00:54:43,782 --> 00:54:45,737
Don't come back here ever again!

618
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:53,923
Isn't it too harsh, Robert?

619
00:55:17,558 --> 00:55:18,697
Are you still angry at me?

620
00:55:22,950 --> 00:55:25,123
You know how lax my servants are?

621
00:55:26,096 --> 00:55:27,097
If I just let go,

622
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,720
I'll just lose my firm ruling hand on them.

623
00:55:31,299 --> 00:55:32,243
But it's too harsh.

624
00:55:33,328 --> 00:55:35,200
You know very well how they speak of you.

625
00:55:35,756 --> 00:55:36,585
If this continues,

626
00:55:37,494 --> 00:55:39,261
they'll think you're more barbaric
than them.

627
00:55:41,482 --> 00:55:43,140
What business are you here for, James?

628
00:55:45,030 --> 00:55:46,580
Why didn't you attend yesterday's meeting?

629
00:55:47,729 --> 00:55:49,804
Yesterday I had things
that I must handle at home.

630
00:55:50,024 --> 00:55:54,714
Please, Robert? Can you please
distinguish what's more important?

631
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:57,771
Is the foresty not
important to you any more?

632
00:56:01,638 --> 00:56:04,776
There's a reception party for
the new manager at the foresty.

633
00:56:05,673 --> 00:56:09,003
And you will attend the
party tonight at the Gymkhana.

634
00:56:09,750 --> 00:56:10,360
Tonight I can't...

635
00:56:10,390 --> 00:56:10,983
Robert!

636
00:56:19,416 --> 00:56:20,800
Why do you have to persuade me so much,

637
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:21,420
Mr. James?

638
00:56:25,660 --> 00:56:29,490
Because I don't think you would let them

639
00:56:29,490 --> 00:56:30,620
speak badly of you.

640
00:56:33,088 --> 00:56:34,330
And also please don't forget

641
00:56:35,821 --> 00:56:37,154
anything you had to go through

642
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:38,540
to get to where you are now.

643
00:57:04,816 --> 00:57:06,042
Jom, are you happy,

644
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,541
living with me in this house?

645
00:57:09,224 --> 00:57:13,123
Of course. I'm very happy.

646
00:57:13,745 --> 00:57:17,680
When did you realize that you loved me?

647
00:57:21,556 --> 00:57:22,664
At the very first time I saw you,

648
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:27,200
I suddenly knew that you were the one.

649
00:57:36,098 --> 00:57:36,540
Khun Yai.

650
00:57:43,236 --> 00:57:45,673
I'm done with packing your belongings.

651
00:57:47,913 --> 00:57:48,615
Excuse me.

652
00:57:53,206 --> 00:57:53,993
Wait, Jom.

653
00:58:08,080 --> 00:58:12,061
You've got to take a rest,

654
00:58:13,686 --> 00:58:14,424
because tomorrow...

655
00:58:15,790 --> 00:58:20,196
is your engagement cerenomy
between you and Busabong.

656
00:58:24,984 --> 00:58:26,098
But I never loved her.

657
00:58:29,323 --> 00:58:30,307
I love you, Jom.

658
00:58:40,135 --> 00:58:40,683
I know.

659
00:58:45,446 --> 00:58:47,064
I know that you love me.

660
00:58:52,953 --> 00:58:54,264
And I love you, too.

661
00:59:00,806 --> 00:59:03,243
But the best thing I can do for you now

662
00:59:08,596 --> 00:59:10,129
is contragulate you, my love.

663
00:59:30,898 --> 00:59:31,249
Jom,

664
00:59:41,563 --> 00:59:43,120
could you please not say those words?

665
00:59:53,107 --> 00:59:53,581
Khun Yai,

666
00:59:57,156 --> 00:59:59,255
I think it's about time

667
01:00:03,858 --> 01:00:05,120
we accepted the truth.

668
01:00:10,443 --> 01:00:12,578
Please get engaged to Busabong.

669
01:00:17,796 --> 01:00:23,212
I can wait.

670
01:00:27,181 --> 01:00:28,652
I can't stand that, Jom!

671
01:00:33,304 --> 01:00:36,092
Having to live with someone I don't love,

672
01:00:38,110 --> 01:00:39,618
I can't do it! I can't do such a thing!

673
01:01:17,581 --> 01:01:18,080
Khun Yai,

674
01:01:23,655 --> 01:01:32,213
it takes time for something to change.

675
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,608
You told me that yourself, didn't you?

676
01:01:38,862 --> 01:01:39,657
And it turns out that...

677
01:01:44,893 --> 01:01:48,720
it includes the story of us.

678
01:01:57,151 --> 01:01:57,822
Khun Yai,

679
01:02:02,284 --> 01:02:03,266
please believe me.

680
01:02:05,124 --> 01:02:08,906
Let's keep our story

681
01:02:11,728 --> 01:02:13,257
as a good memory for us.

682
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:22,051
Whenever you come to think of it,

683
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:27,957
just so you know

684
01:02:31,214 --> 01:02:35,350
that I'll be dealing with myself

685
01:02:35,350 --> 01:02:36,900
when I'm thinking of you as well.

686
01:03:32,047 --> 01:03:32,672
Jom.

687
01:04:03,351 --> 01:04:03,970
Khun Phra,

688
01:04:10,675 --> 01:04:13,250
everything you have anticipated

689
01:04:13,274 --> 01:04:14,044
has been well.

690
01:04:16,832 --> 01:04:17,315
Good.

691
01:04:18,402 --> 01:04:19,745
So I can stop being nervous.

692
01:04:20,936 --> 01:04:22,154
Thank you so much, Chan,

693
01:04:23,312 --> 01:04:25,223
for having helped me witht this issue.

694
01:04:27,567 --> 01:04:28,758
You're welcome, Khun Phra.

695
01:04:33,881 --> 01:04:34,426
Khun Phra,

696
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:40,068
are you really sure about it?

697
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:47,514
Go and have a rest.

698
01:04:48,657 --> 01:04:50,142
In tomorrow's morning,

699
01:04:50,933 --> 01:04:52,880
there are so many things
you've got to handle.

700
01:04:56,331 --> 01:04:57,748
So, excuse me.

701
01:05:32,894 --> 01:05:34,471
On such an auspicious moment,

702
01:05:35,451 --> 01:05:37,013
The House of Palathip of mine

703
01:05:38,186 --> 01:05:41,580
has offered the tray of gifts,

704
01:05:41,891 --> 01:05:44,680
together with prosperity,
wealth, abundance, happiness,

705
01:05:45,801 --> 01:05:48,016
and dowry, to you so
as to propose Busabong.

706
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:52,951
Would you and your family

707
01:05:53,702 --> 01:05:56,564
agree to it?

708
01:05:56,800 --> 01:05:58,762
When you have brough the dowry,

709
01:05:59,444 --> 01:06:00,550
as agreed on,

710
01:06:01,235 --> 01:06:02,329
then I have nothing against it.

711
01:06:02,705 --> 01:06:05,229
And I may ask you,
Khun Phra Thep Nititham, and your family

712
01:06:05,928 --> 01:06:09,002
to take care of her as you see fit,

713
01:06:09,370 --> 01:06:14,020
love her, and have mercy on her like I do.
Then I'll give her to you.

714
01:06:16,060 --> 01:06:17,165
Thank you so much, Brother Dech.

715
01:06:54,410 --> 01:06:55,500
All right.

716
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:56,520
Is everyone ready?

717
01:06:57,341 --> 01:06:57,769
You are, right?

718
01:06:58,246 --> 01:07:00,000
Let’s take a group photo, then.

719
01:07:00,460 --> 01:07:02,314
Please look at the camera.

720
01:07:04,431 --> 01:07:04,860
Yes.

721
01:07:05,197 --> 01:07:05,628
Ready?

722
01:07:06,542 --> 01:07:10,167
3... 2... 1...

723
01:07:24,367 --> 01:07:26,730
Brother Dech, they look perfect together,

724
01:07:27,694 --> 01:07:30,749
like a match made in heaven.

725
01:07:40,901 --> 01:07:41,989
Here, Yai.

726
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:44,509
Eat a bit, please.

727
01:07:44,912 --> 01:07:46,014
So you'll have more energy.

728
01:07:46,832 --> 01:07:48,090
What a lovely view, Father!

729
01:07:48,520 --> 01:07:50,120
They've begun to care for
each other right after the engagement.

730
01:07:51,541 --> 01:07:52,887
Don't be jealous, Robert.

731
01:07:53,323 --> 01:07:55,690
My daughter can also do it like Busabong,

732
01:07:57,276 --> 01:07:57,549
right?

733
01:07:58,661 --> 01:08:00,781
Eeang Peung has taken the best care of me.

734
01:08:14,167 --> 01:08:17,265
What's going on? Why
have you stopped playing?

735
01:08:28,265 --> 01:08:29,607
Sorry for interruption.

736
01:08:35,400 --> 01:08:36,170
I'm Jom,

737
01:08:37,392 --> 01:08:38,985
Khun Yai's majordomo.

738
01:08:43,298 --> 01:08:46,891
On this auspicious day
for my beloved master,

739
01:08:48,500 --> 01:08:51,532
I have prepared a show

740
01:08:52,922 --> 01:08:54,113
to present

741
01:08:55,793 --> 01:08:56,454
as a gift for him.

742
01:09:13,498 --> 01:09:15,140
(Next Episode) What the hell
do you think you're doing exactly?

743
01:09:15,301 --> 01:09:17,620
What I'm doing is
just revealing the truth

744
01:09:17,620 --> 01:09:19,027
of what happened.

745
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:21,423
Yai, do you still want to study abroad?

746
01:09:22,008 --> 01:09:23,340
Do you miss its voice?

747
01:09:23,428 --> 01:09:23,840
Oops!

748
01:09:25,142 --> 01:09:25,878
What are you doing?

749
01:09:26,046 --> 01:09:27,823
You'll get to scratch
my back all night long.

750
01:09:28,195 --> 01:09:32,280
I want to taste the lips of my lover.

751
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:34,820
What if it were something

752
01:09:35,002 --> 01:09:35,941
that made me come back

753
01:09:36,395 --> 01:09:37,720
unconditionally?

754
01:09:38,197 --> 01:09:38,840
- Jom,
- You will...

755
01:09:39,560 --> 01:09:42,164
