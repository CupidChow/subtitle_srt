1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:02,650
(Previously)
They call it the Puttyuban Bar.

2
00:00:02,830 --> 00:00:04,060
This is your favorite place?

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:04,510
Yes.

4
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,620
May I please sit with you?

5
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:07,490
Oh, it's Mr. James.

6
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:09,065
I like you.

7
00:00:10,172 --> 00:00:12,892
Are you angry at me?

8
00:00:13,132 --> 00:00:16,530
Did my actions not reach your heart at all?

9
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:17,900
I like you.

10
00:00:18,606 --> 00:00:19,853
Try cutting everything out

11
00:00:20,193 --> 00:00:21,750
and tell me your feelings.

12
00:00:22,096 --> 00:00:23,680
Do you want to be with me or not?

13
00:00:40,223 --> 00:00:41,893
Choi! Come and eat!

14
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:51,552
I'm just here,

15
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,156
Do you really have to
call out for me like that?

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:56,963
I made your favorite food

17
00:00:58,745 --> 00:00:59,720
to have with the vegetables.

18
00:01:00,312 --> 00:01:01,087
Eat up.

19
00:01:01,494 --> 00:01:02,861
We have to go to the orchard next.

20
00:01:04,941 --> 00:01:06,600
You really know me.

21
00:01:07,338 --> 00:01:08,170
Stop playing around.

22
00:01:19,807 --> 00:01:20,592
The other day...

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,280
Seng, your ex-husband came over,

24
00:01:26,254 --> 00:01:28,425
are you still speaking on good terms?

25
00:01:32,076 --> 00:01:33,581
Are you worried about something?

26
00:01:36,912 --> 00:01:37,436
No.

27
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,436
I just don't really trust him.

28
00:01:46,067 --> 00:01:47,452
Don't worry about it.

29
00:01:48,947 --> 00:01:51,833
We're good friends.

30
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,080
Even though we were actually
husband and wife before.

31
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,864
But it's all over.

32
00:02:07,427 --> 00:02:09,963
Now I have only you.

33
00:02:19,255 --> 00:02:20,295
You can continue eating.

34
00:02:44,621 --> 00:02:45,987
The dog is barking, it's so annoying!

35
00:02:46,356 --> 00:02:49,329
I think I'll take some rice and
throw it to chase away these demons.

36
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:52,960
Choi, calm down.

37
00:02:53,108 --> 00:02:53,660
Choi.

38
00:03:05,146 --> 00:03:05,793
Choi.

39
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,946
Choi, Choi, Choi!

40
00:03:18,213 --> 00:03:19,940
Choi! Choi!

41
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,293
Choi!

42
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,546
Help!

43
00:03:23,033 --> 00:03:23,833
Help!

44
00:03:24,333 --> 00:03:25,000
Choi!

45
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:26,866
Choi!

46
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,413
Gay marriage.

47
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:41,600
Mrs. Choi was attacked and shot,
her intestines gushing out.

48
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:44,373
One word came out of her and she died.

49
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:52,506
I knew this would happen

50
00:03:52,506 --> 00:03:54,692
that they would definitely not survive.

51
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:58,186
This Sri Krung newspaper is diligent about

52
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,113
reporting news that isn't really a story.

53
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,913
What's the matter?

54
00:04:02,193 --> 00:04:05,100
It's the story of a lesbian
married couple being shot dead.

55
00:04:06,593 --> 00:04:08,466
I had already guessed that

56
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,446
there would definitely be problems
and they won't stay together for long.

57
00:04:11,933 --> 00:04:13,733
They are strange and
parading it to the world.

58
00:04:17,206 --> 00:04:18,306
But this kind of event

59
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,473
a husband and wife couple,
there are men and women, right?

60
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,526
Then again, this matter
happened from an outsider.

61
00:04:26,726 --> 00:04:28,480
It's not the two of
them hurting each other.

62
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,360
Yes, there is.

63
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:33,813
But the people who live smooth lives.

64
00:04:33,813 --> 00:04:34,796
There's a lot, right?

65
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,460
But before that

66
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:42,566
gay couples usually don't last long.

67
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:43,800
It didn't end well.

68
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:45,733
It ends in a lawsuit

69
00:04:46,566 --> 00:04:49,446
or deaths tears them apart.

70
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,373
But...

71
00:04:53,026 --> 00:04:57,040
You've called us here today.

72
00:04:57,526 --> 00:04:58,620
Is there something going on?

73
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,280
There's a big event coming up dear.

74
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:05,593
So I want you both to be prepared.

75
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,213
Event?

76
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,520
The event for you father's promotion.

77
00:05:15,113 --> 00:05:17,060
I know about that.

78
00:05:17,913 --> 00:05:19,546
But do we need to organize a party?

79
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:24,793
Father's promotion party

80
00:05:25,213 --> 00:05:27,593
will be organized to bring people together.

81
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,653
And it's a declaration of new power.

82
00:05:30,626 --> 00:05:32,786
Uncle Dech recommended
that it should be arranged.

83
00:05:34,660 --> 00:05:39,080
Anyway, Peung please
invite Robert to come as well.

84
00:05:41,426 --> 00:05:41,826
Yes.

85
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:47,760
Oh, Chan.

86
00:05:49,346 --> 00:05:49,673
Yes.

87
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:53,246
I leave you to oversee this event.

88
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:56,140
With pleasure sir.

89
00:05:57,186 --> 00:05:57,480
Um.

90
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,600
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 7)

91
00:07:36,233 --> 00:07:37,378
What are you doing?

92
00:07:38,264 --> 00:07:39,046
Oh! Oh!

93
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:40,461
Khun Yai.

94
00:07:41,064 --> 00:07:41,969
This is downstairs!

95
00:07:41,969 --> 00:07:43,094
Someone might see us.

96
00:07:46,091 --> 00:07:47,249
Don't worry.

97
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:49,264
We are at our house.

98
00:07:49,767 --> 00:07:50,712
No one will see us.

99
00:08:13,306 --> 00:08:14,605
Are you still not used to it?

100
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,449
To be hugged by me often.

101
00:08:17,523 --> 00:08:19,030
It's been going on for quite a while.

102
00:08:20,716 --> 00:08:22,240
I want to get used to it.

103
00:08:22,673 --> 00:08:23,322
But you,

104
00:08:23,322 --> 00:08:25,466
you keep creeping up on me.

105
00:08:25,704 --> 00:08:26,724
Of course I'd be startled.

106
00:08:28,584 --> 00:08:30,160
If I told you first

107
00:08:30,908 --> 00:08:32,968
you'd be as evasive as
you were was just now.

108
00:08:34,128 --> 00:08:38,352
I want to hug you forever.

109
00:08:40,234 --> 00:08:41,013
Me too.

110
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:52,240
This purity is my own cherished virtue,

111
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:56,520
Reserved for the beloved,
my heart's true hue.

112
00:08:57,502 --> 00:08:59,946
Innocence graces this soul of mine,

113
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:03,840
A serenity for a man to enshrine.

114
00:09:05,724 --> 00:09:07,066
Yet, should the ending
take a different guise,

115
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:09,125
Would you not see, or realize,

116
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:13,560
That I employ my virtue true,

117
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:18,410
For love's sake, for my joy anew?

118
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:27,070
While he battles love with might,

119
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,020
Cutting through emotions, day and night,

120
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:34,110
For his comfort and his heart's ease,

121
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,770
A woman's act in modernity, if you please.

122
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:40,070
Can this be done, in this day and age,

123
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,500
In the end, I express my gratitude,

124
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:50,200
For your enduring attitude.

125
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,392
In displaying disdain, relentless and true,

126
00:09:58,230 --> 00:09:59,290
For the moments I
shared, a heartfelt adieu.

127
00:10:00,534 --> 00:10:01,860
Believe in this, hold it dear,

128
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:07,111
That if I were to depart,
if death draws near.

129
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:22,700
What were you reading?

130
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,520
The story is titled 'Nara's Heart.'

131
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:32,106
Nara seems to be a woman devoted to love.

132
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:38,951
Not at all.

133
00:10:40,453 --> 00:10:43,217
Nara's life is pitiful.

134
00:10:45,338 --> 00:10:47,050
She is about to marry a man

135
00:10:48,992 --> 00:10:50,544
as a mistress

136
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:54,501
in exchange for her family's
comfort and happiness.

137
00:10:57,722 --> 00:11:01,141
This short story reflects the oppression

138
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:05,632
and principles of a woman
being kept and suppressed.

139
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,138
However, after I've read it,

140
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:15,493
it also reflects who I am.

141
00:11:23,260 --> 00:11:29,400
If I ever had the opportunity
to choose my own path,

142
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:42,656
I would just want to spend
time with the person I love,

143
00:11:47,102 --> 00:11:48,548
not much different from Nara in this story.

144
00:11:59,748 --> 00:12:00,571
Khun Yai.

145
00:12:03,954 --> 00:12:04,502
Lamyai.

146
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:08,205
What is it?

147
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:10,177
Why did you come and not make a sound?

148
00:12:11,314 --> 00:12:12,622
The master sent me to call for you

149
00:12:12,622 --> 00:12:15,099
to prepare for the
official duties tomorrow.

150
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:18,417
I'll hurry along.

151
00:12:18,994 --> 00:12:19,908
Please inform him as well.

152
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:20,948
Yes.

153
00:12:36,931 --> 00:12:38,268
Khun Yai.

154
00:12:39,491 --> 00:12:40,554
Do you see this?

155
00:12:41,445 --> 00:12:43,070
I've told you before, right?

156
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,788
That you shouldn't do
this in broad daylight.

157
00:12:45,245 --> 00:12:45,891
Well?

158
00:12:49,514 --> 00:12:49,800
Oh.

159
00:12:50,862 --> 00:12:51,477
Khun Yai.

160
00:12:51,477 --> 00:12:51,736
Oh!

161
00:12:59,369 --> 00:13:02,026
What are you making? Chili paste?

162
00:13:03,009 --> 00:13:04,403
I have a story to tell you.

163
00:13:04,847 --> 00:13:06,700
Hurry, come and listen.

164
00:13:07,752 --> 00:13:09,389
- What?
- I have a story to tell.

165
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:11,180
What is it?

166
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:13,283
Walking around like this.

167
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:19,325
I think that Khun Yai and Jom

168
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,290
are secretly screwing.

169
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:23,637
What are you saying?

170
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,200
How can it be like that?

171
00:13:25,552 --> 00:13:26,986
Don't talk nonsense.

172
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:28,874
Well, I went and saw it.

173
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:31,482
When Khun Yai and Jom

174
00:13:31,786 --> 00:13:32,832
were moving their faces closer together

175
00:13:32,992 --> 00:13:34,320
until their lips almost touched!

176
00:13:34,778 --> 00:13:37,018
No one thinks of evil like you, Lamyai.

177
00:13:37,738 --> 00:13:38,606
Shut up

178
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:41,744
and don't go around and spreading gossip
until it reaches the ears of the master.

179
00:13:42,013 --> 00:13:43,933
He will kick you out of the
house before you know it.

180
00:13:45,882 --> 00:13:47,226
Well, I really saw it.

181
00:13:47,786 --> 00:13:50,922
If any of you don't believe me

182
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:52,661
then just wait and see!

183
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:02,800
Get to work!

184
00:14:02,949 --> 00:14:05,013
Why are you gossiping?!

185
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,850
I really like this time.

186
00:14:53,216 --> 00:14:54,426
Why do you like it?

187
00:14:59,872 --> 00:15:03,520
I feel like I can be myself.

188
00:15:04,704 --> 00:15:06,826
Time spent together with you.

189
00:15:10,645 --> 00:15:14,613
I thought that you'd get used to it

190
00:15:15,610 --> 00:15:18,640
because we've been
doing this for a long time.

191
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:28,442
Don't say that.

192
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:42,352
You know that I'm never bored of you.

193
00:17:20,728 --> 00:17:25,560
When are you going
to tell me about this scar?

194
00:17:30,351 --> 00:17:32,368
I've asked you so many times

195
00:17:34,835 --> 00:17:36,831
you never said anything to me.

196
00:17:43,884 --> 00:17:45,235
Don't pay any attention to it.

197
00:17:46,622 --> 00:17:49,684
It's nothing to think about.

198
00:17:56,048 --> 00:17:57,248
Please tell me.

199
00:17:58,982 --> 00:18:01,577
And I won't ask again.

200
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:19,795
Khun Eeang Peung, do you
remember what I asked for?

201
00:18:21,551 --> 00:18:23,355
That I didn't want you to tell anyone

202
00:18:24,568 --> 00:18:26,315
that I came to live with you at this house.

203
00:18:32,977 --> 00:18:37,180
I remember that...

204
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:41,069
when you first arrived

205
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:48,349
your parents took you back

206
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:55,280
because they didn't
want to be apart from you.

207
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:04,760
Now that I've escaped.

208
00:19:07,556 --> 00:19:08,872
I'm now living with Khun Eeang Peung.

209
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,480
I'm afraid to go back there again.

210
00:19:19,665 --> 00:19:22,778
Where is that?

211
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,140
My parents

212
00:19:32,385 --> 00:19:34,487
sold me to a brothel.

213
00:19:45,498 --> 00:19:52,384
This wound came when
I met an evil customer.

214
00:19:54,669 --> 00:19:58,538
He used things in the room to hit me

215
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:05,410
then he used his hand to squeeze the wound.

216
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:13,860
He said he liked hearing me moan

217
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:20,270
and he liked seeing me hurt.

218
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,790
- And then...
- That's enough.

219
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:22,565
Maey.

220
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:23,250
Maey.

221
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:23,934
That's enough.

222
00:20:24,968 --> 00:20:25,484
That's enough.

223
00:20:25,498 --> 00:20:25,920
That's enough.

224
00:20:27,364 --> 00:20:29,333
You don't have to tell me.

225
00:20:30,261 --> 00:20:31,560
I don't want to listen anymore.

226
00:20:32,874 --> 00:20:33,989
I don't want to listen anymore.

227
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm here now.

228
00:20:38,272 --> 00:20:39,189
I'm here now.

229
00:20:41,322 --> 00:20:42,720
You don't have to tell me.

230
00:20:44,394 --> 00:20:45,002
You don't have to tell me.

231
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:14,981
Maey.

232
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:18,101
Yes sir.

233
00:21:21,941 --> 00:21:22,565
Last night.

234
00:21:23,482 --> 00:21:27,333
I saw creeping in the big house.

235
00:21:29,024 --> 00:21:31,877
Well, that is...

236
00:21:37,050 --> 00:21:37,450
Maey.

237
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,200
What did you come to do?

238
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,309
I was the one who called her up.

239
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:06,922
Because last night I wasn't feeling well.

240
00:22:08,192 --> 00:22:10,592
So I called Maey to come
up and take care of me.

241
00:22:22,949 --> 00:22:24,880
So why do you have to hide like that?

242
00:22:28,050 --> 00:22:32,480
Because if you knew that
someone came to see me

243
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:36,980
here will be an investigation
and be blown out of proportion.

244
00:22:40,181 --> 00:22:43,482
There's enough trouble in this house.

245
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:47,984
If there's nothing then that's good.

246
00:22:52,096 --> 00:22:54,912
Next time,

247
00:22:55,424 --> 00:22:57,290
don't creep around like
a thief like this again.

248
00:23:00,224 --> 00:23:01,642
Yes sir.

249
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:48,282
Jom.

250
00:23:49,509 --> 00:23:50,010
Yes?

251
00:23:51,365 --> 00:23:52,597
Are you secretly looking at me?

252
00:23:54,752 --> 00:23:56,938
Oh, no.

253
00:23:57,946 --> 00:24:01,082
I saw you looking at me for a long time.

254
00:24:03,898 --> 00:24:05,450
Khun Yai.

255
00:24:06,336 --> 00:24:08,298
I was just wondering

256
00:24:08,298 --> 00:24:10,941
what you were doing.

257
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:15,386
Come here.

258
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,957
Olive oil, it's used to
nourish the skin during winter.

259
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:37,240
Oh, I had no idea

260
00:24:37,240 --> 00:24:40,730
that you also take care of your skin.

261
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:48,800
Is it strange?

262
00:24:51,595 --> 00:24:52,188
Not at all.

263
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,712
It's not strange at all.

264
00:25:03,241 --> 00:25:09,900
Then could you rub it on my back?

265
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:13,649
What?

266
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,248
I can't reach it.

267
00:25:18,546 --> 00:25:23,013
It would be nice for you to help me.

268
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,433
Are you sure?

269
00:25:31,753 --> 00:25:32,098
Yes.

270
00:29:11,566 --> 00:29:12,701
Thank you very much.

271
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,524
You can now return to your room.

272
00:29:18,013 --> 00:29:19,306
I don't have any business anymore.

273
00:29:22,026 --> 00:29:24,804
As for the olive oil, keep it.

274
00:29:38,031 --> 00:29:38,711
Thank you very much.

275
00:30:31,204 --> 00:30:32,680
Run you buffalo!

276
00:30:33,044 --> 00:30:33,780
Run!

277
00:30:34,715 --> 00:30:35,444
Run!

278
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:37,346
Go!

279
00:30:37,346 --> 00:30:37,951
Go buffalo!

280
00:30:38,217 --> 00:30:38,795
Go!

281
00:30:39,431 --> 00:30:40,386
Quickly!

282
00:30:40,386 --> 00:30:41,428
Khun Lek, be careful.

283
00:30:41,764 --> 00:30:42,760
Oh.

284
00:30:43,315 --> 00:30:43,920
Quickly!

285
00:30:43,924 --> 00:30:45,004
Crawl faster!

286
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:47,062
Quickly!

287
00:30:48,115 --> 00:30:50,448
Could I take a rest?

288
00:30:51,004 --> 00:30:54,000
My back hurts.

289
00:30:54,355 --> 00:30:55,240
- Uh.
- Be careful Khun Lek.

290
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:02,400
A buffalo can't speak!

291
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:07,093
And they won't complain
that they are tired.

292
00:31:07,613 --> 00:31:08,377
What's going on?

293
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:09,875
What happened?

294
00:31:11,573 --> 00:31:13,106
Well, it's Jom!

295
00:31:13,582 --> 00:31:14,671
He's complaining that he's tired

296
00:31:15,382 --> 00:31:16,960
even though I'm still
making him be a buffalo.

297
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,204
Buffalo can't complain.

298
00:31:21,933 --> 00:31:22,888
Are you okay?

299
00:31:24,755 --> 00:31:26,440
Are you ok with continue
playing with Lek for a while?

300
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:30,862
I'm already tired.

301
00:31:33,826 --> 00:31:35,022
Even if the buffalo won't complain.

302
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:37,657
But I am person, not a buffalo.

303
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:40,613
Jom.

304
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:44,484
Jom.

305
00:31:46,217 --> 00:31:46,693
Jom.

306
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:55,611
Fine, I won't play anymore.

307
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:59,120
Jom looks very angry.

308
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:03,443
It's not like that Lek.

309
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:10,947
But for now, you are going into the house.

310
00:32:15,100 --> 00:32:16,166
Please take care of Khun Lek.

311
00:32:32,603 --> 00:32:38,020
So who will be the next buffalo?

312
00:33:12,504 --> 00:33:13,056
Jom.

313
00:33:18,024 --> 00:33:19,464
What are you angry about?

314
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,500
There's nothing, Ming.

315
00:33:32,971 --> 00:33:34,100
Is it a big deal for you?

316
00:33:45,860 --> 00:33:47,948
I'm really asking you.

317
00:33:49,348 --> 00:33:50,744
What's going on with you and Khun Yai?

318
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:58,288
Huh? Why are you asking me that?

319
00:33:58,789 --> 00:34:01,178
I'm asking because I'm worried about you?

320
00:34:05,925 --> 00:34:09,498
So what's going on with you and Khun Yai?

321
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:53,520
If there's nothing more

322
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:55,445
then please excuse me.

323
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,508
Jom.

324
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,092
I'm sorry.

325
00:35:08,492 --> 00:35:10,444
If you're unhappy with me

326
00:35:11,388 --> 00:35:12,620
then be straight with me.

327
00:35:14,652 --> 00:35:15,904
Don't give me the silent treatment.

328
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:26,456
I'm the one

329
00:35:26,456 --> 00:35:27,526
who should be asking you

330
00:35:28,630 --> 00:35:31,240
that what's wrong with you.

331
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:35,164
Me..?

332
00:35:37,304 --> 00:35:38,024
Yes.

333
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:40,628
After that day

334
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:46,970
you seemed to distance yourself from me.

335
00:35:50,430 --> 00:35:55,240
It's the time I spend with you.

336
00:35:57,430 --> 00:35:58,885
My mind often...

337
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,360
wanders far.

338
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,620
So I had to keep my distance.

339
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:13,800
Because I'm afraid I'll accidentally hurt you.

340
00:36:21,591 --> 00:36:25,060
I'm sorry for making you worry.

341
00:36:27,083 --> 00:36:28,378
Please forgive me.

342
00:36:55,800 --> 00:37:00,450
I want to say I'm sorry as well.

343
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,832
I was really too hot-tempered.

344
00:37:06,283 --> 00:37:07,560
But you understand me, right?

345
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,280
If so, after this

346
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:25,360
if we are in front of others

347
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:28,924
we'll act normal.

348
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,980
But if we're alone

349
00:37:34,532 --> 00:37:38,026
then you'll be as my special person.

350
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:39,433
What do you think?

351
00:38:08,491 --> 00:38:09,382
There's so many people.

352
00:38:11,051 --> 00:38:12,645
- Hello.
- Hi.

353
00:38:13,205 --> 00:38:13,640
Hello.

354
00:38:13,668 --> 00:38:14,645
Hello, welcome.

355
00:38:21,217 --> 00:38:21,754
Hi.

356
00:38:23,022 --> 00:38:24,140
Hello.

357
00:38:24,954 --> 00:38:26,080
Hi, welcome.

358
00:38:33,885 --> 00:38:35,005
How are you?

359
00:38:35,457 --> 00:38:36,730
Is everything okay?

360
00:38:37,805 --> 00:38:40,430
Everything is being arranged, sir.

361
00:38:41,611 --> 00:38:42,297
Thank you very much.

362
00:38:42,845 --> 00:38:44,697
Do you want anything more?

363
00:38:45,034 --> 00:38:45,685
Not anymore.

364
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:50,720
As time goes on, you look
more and more dignified.

365
00:38:54,074 --> 00:38:56,900
It is because of your kindness.

366
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,700
If someone were to strive to be like this,
it would be nice.

367
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,200
Please continue working.

368
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,660
Thank you for coming.

369
00:39:14,530 --> 00:39:14,980
Thank you.

370
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:17,800
The day has finally arrived, sir.

371
00:39:19,701 --> 00:39:22,682
I has been quite a long journey.

372
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:25,248
I want today's work to be my event

373
00:39:25,941 --> 00:39:27,269
and it's our family's.

374
00:39:31,722 --> 00:39:32,700
I'm so happy.

375
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,794
Please excuse me.

376
00:39:35,936 --> 00:39:36,440
Wait, Yai.

377
00:39:36,512 --> 00:39:37,560
- Wait, Yai.
- Yai.

378
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,260
Hello.

379
00:39:40,032 --> 00:39:41,300
Hi.

380
00:39:41,989 --> 00:39:43,178
- Hello.
- Hello.

381
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:44,700
Oh.

382
00:39:44,954 --> 00:39:45,466
How are you?

383
00:39:45,573 --> 00:39:47,221
Thank you so much for coming.

384
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:48,373
I'll be right back.

385
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:49,904
- Wait, Lumyai.
- Prik.

386
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:53,178
Take Khun Ying Aeu to her table.

387
00:39:53,861 --> 00:39:54,560
Please.

388
00:39:55,189 --> 00:39:57,230
Please, come this way. Right this way.

389
00:40:01,549 --> 00:40:02,258
So happy.

390
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:12,375
See?

391
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:17,040
I told you that it's true!

392
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:20,400
None of you believed me!

393
00:40:22,505 --> 00:40:25,485
You're still not shutting your mouth?

394
00:40:26,505 --> 00:40:28,960
Ming, if you don't believe me.

395
00:40:29,265 --> 00:40:31,350
Go to the small house

396
00:40:31,690 --> 00:40:33,955
and see that your friend and Khun Yai

397
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:36,160
are really in a relationship like I said.

398
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,545
I told you to stop talking!

399
00:40:38,985 --> 00:40:40,160
What is this?

400
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:40,690
Stop!

401
00:40:40,885 --> 00:40:42,240
Even if you're a woman

402
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,135
I won't stop.

403
00:40:43,245 --> 00:40:46,140
Lumyai, why are you slandering my friend?

404
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,986
- Lumyai.
- Ming.

405
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,326
- You and I...
- What is this?

406
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,983
- Why are you slandering my friend?
- It's true.

407
00:40:50,040 --> 00:40:51,816
Stop! I said stop!

408
00:40:52,786 --> 00:40:54,530
What is this?

409
00:40:55,980 --> 00:40:56,300
Ming.

410
00:40:57,396 --> 00:40:58,460
Listen to what she's saying.

411
00:40:58,700 --> 00:41:00,096
If you said bad things about your friend

412
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,596
would you just stand
by and not do anything?

413
00:41:01,723 --> 00:41:03,590
You're evil!

414
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:06,953
It's in your nature to even hurt women.

415
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:09,810
Lumyai, I told you to stop.

416
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:10,876
Ming, come on.

417
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:12,441
- Lumyai.
- So people will know what you're like!

418
00:41:12,620 --> 00:41:16,540
- Come on!
- Stop, that's enough.

419
00:41:17,309 --> 00:41:18,640
Stop what you're doing, Lumyai.

420
00:41:19,397 --> 00:41:20,362
You saw what he's doing to me!

421
00:41:22,741 --> 00:41:23,440
Huh?

422
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:33,793
That's enough. Enough.

423
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:37,014
Go fetch her.

424
00:41:37,882 --> 00:41:38,084
Yes.

425
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:55,048
Oh, what are you doing?

426
00:41:55,082 --> 00:41:55,962
Someone might see.

427
00:41:56,362 --> 00:41:57,300
No one will see us.

428
00:42:00,376 --> 00:42:04,432
Today, my Jom looks
different than every other day.

429
00:42:08,860 --> 00:42:10,220
What do you mean?

430
00:42:10,904 --> 00:42:13,496
I look like any other day.

431
00:42:14,712 --> 00:42:17,984
What do you mean? You look better everyday.

432
00:42:21,216 --> 00:42:24,800
Look at me.

433
00:42:30,760 --> 00:42:31,640
You look so good.

434
00:42:37,656 --> 00:42:38,760
Khun Yai.

435
00:42:40,088 --> 00:42:41,712
You're acting like a kid.

436
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:45,880
You don't even know that
your hair is all messed up.

437
00:42:47,790 --> 00:42:49,404
It might be a plan of mine

438
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,500
so that you can help me fix my hair.

439
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:55,302
You're not that coy.

440
00:42:56,128 --> 00:42:56,660
I know that very well.

441
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:03,460
You're starting to know me very well.

442
00:43:13,978 --> 00:43:14,830
Ahem.

443
00:43:18,552 --> 00:43:19,090
Yai.

444
00:43:26,946 --> 00:43:28,473
Uncle Dech, when did you get here?

445
00:43:30,584 --> 00:43:31,603
You mean...

446
00:43:33,332 --> 00:43:35,213
for the party

447
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:36,980
or here?

448
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:43,043
Who is this?

449
00:43:45,660 --> 00:43:47,062
Could you introduce him to me?

450
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:50,731
Oh, this is Jom.

451
00:43:51,664 --> 00:43:52,920
He is my majordomo.

452
00:43:54,034 --> 00:43:54,441
Oh.

453
00:43:59,219 --> 00:44:01,760
It's time to join the party downstairs.

454
00:44:02,735 --> 00:44:04,937
Don't keep your father
and the guests waiting long.

455
00:44:44,068 --> 00:44:45,401
People are starting to gather.

456
00:44:46,688 --> 00:44:46,896
Yes.

457
00:44:48,010 --> 00:44:51,205
Proud, right? The the
day has finally arrived.

458
00:44:53,162 --> 00:44:54,320
I'm very proud.

459
00:44:54,917 --> 00:44:57,333
It was a tough fight with
the government officials.

460
00:44:59,226 --> 00:45:00,613
I got very tired.

461
00:45:01,685 --> 00:45:04,874
If it weren't for Brother Dech
helping me in every matter.

462
00:45:06,005 --> 00:45:07,472
I probably won't have this day.

463
00:45:08,368 --> 00:45:09,360
Thank you very much.

464
00:45:09,424 --> 00:45:11,985
Hey, I didn't do anything.

465
00:45:13,181 --> 00:45:16,229
You did it yourself.

466
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:20,746
I did enough to help.

467
00:45:21,482 --> 00:45:22,773
It was not much on my part.

468
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:31,985
Do you know that preserving what you gained

469
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:33,687
is much more difficult.

470
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,980
Are you trying to tell me something?

471
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,116
After this, if you must be strict,

472
00:45:45,430 --> 00:45:46,189
then do so.

473
00:45:47,105 --> 00:45:50,225
Because otherwise, it's
the people under your control

474
00:45:51,090 --> 00:45:54,340
that will ruin the honor you've earned.

475
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:57,400
Brother Dech, don't beat around the bush.

476
00:46:00,323 --> 00:46:02,363
Then let me be forward with you.

477
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:09,128
Do you think that Yai

478
00:46:09,744 --> 00:46:11,580
is different from the past?

479
00:46:29,864 --> 00:46:31,296
I hope we can work
together again in the future.

480
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:34,200
Please excuse me.

481
00:46:39,904 --> 00:46:41,300
Oh, Robert.

482
00:46:41,760 --> 00:46:42,664
Hello.

483
00:46:44,016 --> 00:46:45,600
I haven't seen you in quite a long time.

484
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:46,536
Yes.

485
00:46:47,296 --> 00:46:48,272
How are you?

486
00:46:49,256 --> 00:46:50,100
I'm good.

487
00:46:50,904 --> 00:46:52,860
There's something...

488
00:46:54,608 --> 00:46:55,080
Fong Kaew.

489
00:46:55,824 --> 00:46:56,632
Yes?

490
00:46:57,128 --> 00:46:58,608
Go fetch me some whiskey

491
00:46:58,640 --> 00:47:00,408
from the cellar room?

492
00:47:02,600 --> 00:47:05,200
Why don't you ask a servant to do it?

493
00:47:06,008 --> 00:47:07,160
It's expensive.

494
00:47:08,056 --> 00:47:10,832
You know I don't trust the servants much.

495
00:47:12,328 --> 00:47:14,360
Yes, I'll go pick it up for you.

496
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:36,864
Oh, why does the foreinger
master's liquor taste so good?

497
00:47:49,336 --> 00:47:52,104
Oh my, that's enough.

498
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:56,752
Drinking won't make anything better.

499
00:48:01,496 --> 00:48:02,520
I'm just afraid.

500
00:48:03,072 --> 00:48:04,480
I'm afraid of what Lumyai said.

501
00:48:04,480 --> 00:48:05,868
It will reach the ears of the master.

502
00:48:06,896 --> 00:48:08,536
I'm afraid that Jom will be punished.

503
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:15,977
What do you think about this?

504
00:48:29,668 --> 00:48:30,902
I've already asked Jom.

505
00:48:31,651 --> 00:48:32,657
But he hasn't answered me.

506
00:48:37,508 --> 00:48:42,251
What if what Lumyai said is true?

507
00:48:44,868 --> 00:48:46,937
Would you be able to accept your friend?

508
00:49:00,190 --> 00:49:02,713
I don't know how to feel about this.

509
00:49:03,655 --> 00:49:06,332
You know it's not a normal thing.

510
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:10,860
It's normal

511
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,578
but it's been treated
as something abnormal.

512
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:18,313
No matter what happens

513
00:49:19,427 --> 00:49:20,824
if it's true

514
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,981
it's all about feelings.

515
00:49:24,461 --> 00:49:27,753
It's like when you like someone.

516
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:47,200
I think... I should go.

517
00:49:50,232 --> 00:49:50,815
Wait Maey.

518
00:49:58,299 --> 00:49:58,987
Is there something wrong?

519
00:50:06,351 --> 00:50:08,121
From the first time I saw you.

520
00:50:10,320 --> 00:50:11,376
I think...

521
00:50:14,821 --> 00:50:15,903
that I like you.

522
00:50:45,648 --> 00:50:45,796
Uh.

523
00:50:50,606 --> 00:50:55,960
I think the party is getting pretty busy.

524
00:50:56,297 --> 00:50:59,246
Nobody is helping.

525
00:51:00,313 --> 00:51:02,640
Please excuse me.

526
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,680
See you around.

527
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,160
Father, today's party
seems to be a success.

528
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:50,113
Congratulations again.

529
00:51:50,873 --> 00:51:51,566
Thank you very much.

530
00:51:52,066 --> 00:51:55,193
It was organized for meeting
and socializing together.

531
00:51:57,346 --> 00:52:01,746
Oh, I heard that you won
a lot of concessions, right?

532
00:52:02,726 --> 00:52:07,417
Yes, this time I think the
land we got is very interesting.

533
00:52:07,923 --> 00:52:09,702
If you get stuck on
anything, you can tell me.

534
00:52:09,737 --> 00:52:10,035
Yes.

535
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:12,048
Don't worry, I can help with everything.

536
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:19,653
Please excuse me.

537
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,146
Where did you go?

538
00:52:29,675 --> 00:52:31,040
I went to get things from the house.

539
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:34,746
What are you talking about, father and son?

540
00:52:35,186 --> 00:52:37,520
Oh, it's nothing, Brother Dech.

541
00:52:40,431 --> 00:52:43,260
Eh, is that Busabong?

542
00:52:44,420 --> 00:52:46,000
Heh, that's right.

543
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,900
This is my daughter.

544
00:52:51,386 --> 00:52:54,920
I used to take her to the
house back in Phranakorn.

545
00:52:57,005 --> 00:52:57,788
I remember now.

546
00:52:58,925 --> 00:52:59,874
We haven't seen each other for a long time.

547
00:53:01,017 --> 00:53:04,160
My father sent me to
study at a boarding school.

548
00:53:04,845 --> 00:53:06,240
Just had the opportunity to come back.

549
00:53:07,165 --> 00:53:09,331
How are you?

550
00:53:10,874 --> 00:53:11,445
I'm good.

551
00:53:15,005 --> 00:53:17,100
Oh, this kind of atmosphere.

552
00:53:18,074 --> 00:53:22,181
You should have a dance with her.

553
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:26,130
In the past, you used
to dance together often.

554
00:53:27,221 --> 00:53:29,560
Why not try reminiscing a bit?

555
00:53:30,727 --> 00:53:30,981
Go.

556
00:53:34,433 --> 00:53:35,233
Yes, Father.

557
00:53:40,487 --> 00:53:41,040
Please come this way.

558
00:53:41,563 --> 00:53:41,985
Yes.

559
00:54:10,523 --> 00:54:11,940
Just like when we were kids.

560
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,580
Do you remember?

561
00:54:16,832 --> 00:54:20,253
Uh, a little bit.

562
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:16,773
Is something wrong with you?

563
00:55:18,680 --> 00:55:21,580
I feel dizzy.

564
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,177
Should we take a rest?

565
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:28,645
But...

566
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:32,100
I know how you feel

567
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:35,205
because I feel the same way.

568
00:55:36,200 --> 00:55:39,366
If you're not ok, let's head back.

569
00:56:53,541 --> 00:56:55,500
Mr. James, why are you
taking pictures of me?

570
00:56:57,584 --> 00:56:59,510
I just want to record pictures of people

571
00:56:59,510 --> 00:57:01,128
who can't keep their cool.

572
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,176
What do you mean?

573
00:57:07,861 --> 00:57:10,992
And really, you should ask
permission from the person

574
00:57:11,270 --> 00:57:12,018
before taking pictures of them.

575
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:29,180
Uh...

576
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:31,000
Please excuse me.

577
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:32,941
Uh, Brother Yai.

578
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,096
Jom.

579
00:58:16,755 --> 00:58:20,030
Are you ok?

580
00:58:20,960 --> 00:58:22,640
Why did you leave the party?

581
00:58:26,860 --> 00:58:27,635
I'm fine.

582
00:58:30,412 --> 00:58:34,160
I just feel a bit sick.

583
00:58:35,000 --> 00:58:35,464
So...

584
00:58:37,666 --> 00:58:39,751
Please excuse me to go get some rest.

585
00:58:42,328 --> 00:58:43,200
Jom.

586
00:58:47,986 --> 00:58:48,700
Are you jealous?

587
00:58:51,080 --> 00:58:51,902
What do you mean?

588
00:58:52,782 --> 00:58:54,631
You're coming up with
these ideas on your own.

589
00:58:56,493 --> 00:58:57,840
If you're not jealous

590
00:58:59,773 --> 00:59:03,552
then can I ask something from you?

591
00:59:07,120 --> 00:59:07,704
What is it?

592
00:59:10,387 --> 00:59:13,065
Could you be my dance partner?

593
00:59:14,949 --> 00:59:16,749
I want to dance with you right here.

594
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,618
Why do you want to dance with me?

595
00:59:23,625 --> 00:59:26,778
Go dance with that person in the party.

596
00:59:28,763 --> 00:59:29,740
I don't know how to dance.

597
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,908
I'll teach you.

598
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:39,260
As for dancing with the person in party...

599
00:59:41,176 --> 00:59:41,886
Who would I dance with?

600
00:59:42,932 --> 00:59:44,380
My dance partner is here.

601
01:00:33,691 --> 01:00:34,525
Follow me.

602
01:02:51,864 --> 01:02:52,560
Jom.

603
01:02:55,312 --> 01:02:58,920
I told you that I'm not good at dancing.

604
01:03:00,430 --> 01:03:02,984
It's ok, I understand.

605
01:03:06,072 --> 01:03:08,656
But I can sing.

606
01:03:09,632 --> 01:03:10,320
Sing?

607
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:10,776
Yes.

608
01:03:13,152 --> 01:03:13,584
Try.

609
01:03:14,352 --> 01:03:16,496
Sing for me.

610
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:22,886
But you must help make the rhythm for me.

611
01:03:24,180 --> 01:03:24,526
Okay.

612
01:03:27,786 --> 01:03:29,013
You have to rock like this.

613
01:03:29,766 --> 01:03:31,100
Yo yo.

614
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:36,560
One two three.

615
01:03:36,993 --> 01:03:39,330
- Yo yo yo.
- Yo yo yo.

616
01:03:40,833 --> 01:03:43,433
Khun Yai House of Palathip.

617
01:03:44,493 --> 01:03:47,920
Walked for two, three beeps.

618
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:51,940
Hope eats a banana with Mowgli.

619
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:59,500
Run away... I saw Khun Yai coming
so I ran away, very far away.

620
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:02,700
Yo yo yo.

621
01:04:02,771 --> 01:04:03,760
Run away from me?

622
01:04:05,020 --> 01:04:05,840
Jom.

623
01:04:06,942 --> 01:04:08,314
Your verses

624
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,228
sounds quite strange.

625
01:04:12,982 --> 01:04:13,937
But it's pretty good.

626
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:16,611
Is that right, my beloved Jom?

627
01:04:17,925 --> 01:04:20,060
Khun Yai, you don't have
to keep praising everything.

628
01:04:20,142 --> 01:04:21,108
I know it.

629
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:22,937
Of course you do.

630
01:04:27,765 --> 01:04:37,533
I'm sorry I walked away like that.

631
01:04:42,700 --> 01:04:43,557
It's okay.

632
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,297
Before, I thought it was just me

633
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,568
who was jealous.

634
01:04:57,613 --> 01:04:59,413
So I'm more than happy

635
01:05:01,760 --> 01:05:03,900
that you're jealous of me too.

636
01:05:09,540 --> 01:05:10,462
Who is jealous?

637
01:05:11,604 --> 01:05:12,297
I told you.

638
01:05:12,297 --> 01:05:13,939
I was not jealous in the slightest.

639
01:05:16,151 --> 01:05:17,220
Aren't you a little jealous?

640
01:05:20,096 --> 01:05:20,501
No.

641
01:05:22,430 --> 01:05:26,032
Are you telling me the truth?

642
01:05:28,568 --> 01:05:28,856
Hmm?

643
01:05:31,112 --> 01:05:32,160
