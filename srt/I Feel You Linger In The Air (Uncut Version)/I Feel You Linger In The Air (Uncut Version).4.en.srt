1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,120
(Previously) You saw Fong Kaew
secretly having an affair at the pier.

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:04,520
So I want to ask you

3
00:00:04,800 --> 00:00:05,520
Yes, sir.

4
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:06,360
I saw that.

5
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:08,200
Are you the one who told them?

6
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:10,640
In this life, she's compelled
to be that bastard's wife.

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:13,400
If you do anything to
me and my people again,

8
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,680
I won't stand for it.

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,640
May you be safe from misfortune,

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:19,120
even in your dreams.

11
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:20,400
Good night.

12
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,520
If Jom continues to reside here,

13
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,000
it won't be a good thing.

14
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,520
So I want you..

15
00:00:25,520 --> 00:00:26,880
To come stay with me as...

16
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:28,040
my majordomo.

17
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,800
Can you do that?

18
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:37,600
Mother, I would like to talk about Jom.

19
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,720
I need to consult you.

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,760
What now, Yai?

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,440
I would like him

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,200
to move and live in our house

23
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:51,400
rather than to share a house with Ming.

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:52,640
Why?

25
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:54,000
They're not on good terms?

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:55,640
Yes, they are.

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,400
It just seems quite inappropriate

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:00,520
that I was the one inviting Jom over here

29
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,840
but having him live with someone else.

30
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:07,120
But Mr. Robert is not
just someone else, is he?

31
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:10,440
He is your sister's husband

32
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,360
Well... I don't want to bother him.

33
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,120
So why don't you just get Jom

34
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
to move here and share the bedroom

35
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,600
with our male servants?

36
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:29,920
Well...

37
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,240
If you allow me, Mother,

38
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,120
may I get him

39
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:37,720
to take care of my business?

40
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:46,720
These days Father has
been out for work quite often,

41
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,320
and Chan has to accompany him

42
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,440
every single minute.

43
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,360
If Jom becomes my majordomo,

44
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,640
he will help me work and ease my burden.

45
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,600
But I have a different opinion, Khun Yai.

46
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:02,160
It's true that he hasn't brought
any trouble to our house,

47
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:04,640
but if you keep him by your side,

48
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:07,920
you might get into some one day.

49
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Right.

50
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,680
Personally, I don't really trust him.

51
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:16,600
Please trust me, Mother.

52
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:19,760
He is not a bad person
or anything of that sort.

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,000
He's just having a difficult time.

54
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,400
Nothing more.

55
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:26,120
I wouldn't mind, actually,

56
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,400
if you've thought carefully.

57
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,880
But your father...

58
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,320
If he knows that you've got a stranger

59
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,920
to be your majordomo,

60
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,800
I'm afraid that you two

61
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,000
will be on bad terms again.

62
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Don't worry, Mother.

63
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:46,320
I'll take care of it.

64
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,600
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 4)

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,200
What is wrong with you, Jom?

66
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,560
Well... I don't know.

67
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,560
I don't know what's
going on in my life again

68
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:26,840
after moving to
that house, Ming.

69
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,720
Why are you thinking too much, then?

70
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,080
You've made up your mind.

71
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:33,440
One more thing,

72
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,120
I agree with Khun Yai.

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,200
It's good that you live there.

74
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,080
But I don't know anybody there, Ming.

75
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:45,680
Living here, I've got you as my friend.

76
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,120
Maybe I should second guess my decision.

77
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,200
Jom,

78
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:53,880
after you move there,

79
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,280
we'll still be friends as usual.

80
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,360
And our places are not too far.

81
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,160
You know.

82
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:03,520
Don't be nervous.

83
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:19,640
Let's go.

84
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,400
Are you all right, Jom?

85
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,720
Well... I'm just excited

86
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,960
to come and work here.

87
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,240
It might be a bit tense at the beginning.

88
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,120
So Prik will inform you
of your responsibilities,

89
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,240
like what you've got to do,

90
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,920
until Father returns and meets you here.

91
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,200
Father... Your father, right?

92
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:15,920
Yes.

93
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,640
My father, Luang Nititham.

94
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,400
He's been out for work,
but he is coming back

95
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,880
in the next few days.

96
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:33,080
And is he... harsh?

97
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,320
He's not that kind of person.

98
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,760
He might be a bit strict,

99
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,520
but when you meet him,

100
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,920
you'll understand what I'm saying.

101
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,240
Let's get inside.

102
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,520
Here is your bedroom.

103
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:49,200
Mine?

104
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,160
Do you like it?

105
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,000
Yes, I do.

106
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
Me too.

107
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:08,520
So now we're living under the same roof,

108
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:09,720
Jom.

109
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,600
Close them.

110
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,320
Auntie Prik,

111
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,120
this house was newly built, wasn't it?

112
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:57,760
Yes.

113
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,520
After Khun Luang moved here for his career,

114
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:04,080
he had the big house built,

115
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:06,520
and then he had the
small one built for guests.

116
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:14,240
"So did they ever use old wood removed from
the previous house for the construction?"

117
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,800
I don't know.

118
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,800
Well... I've just noticed something.

119
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,360
Where are you from?

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,080
Your accent sounds different
from those of the others.

121
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,120
Why are you asking that?

122
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:29,520
I just want to know.

123
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,960
You just blend in with
where you are right now

124
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,960
and care about what
you've got to do from now on.

125
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,320
Otherwise,

126
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:40,400
Khun Luang will never let you live here

127
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,320
and waste his properties for sure.

128
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:47,920
Your duties for every morning are

129
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,560
getting up before Khun Yai

130
00:09:49,633 --> 00:09:53,033
and preparing his outfits
and belongings for him

131
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,920
before he gets up.

132
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,600
Sometime you might have
to wake him up as well.

133
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,640
Here is his wardrobe.

134
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,560
This one.

135
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,720
Khun Yai wears these clothes

136
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,200
when he accompanies his father for work.

137
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,560
Here is his bed.

138
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:09,360
Every morning after he gets up,

139
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,360
you must make his bed in this condition.

140
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:13,240
You work on that side.

141
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:14,360
Oh!

142
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:19,040
You also have to prepare the blanket

143
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,320
for him every night.

144
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,640
And in every morning,

145
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,200
you just tidy it up after he gets up.

146
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:28,640
Why do masters have such good lives?

147
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,240
What did you say?

148
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,040
Nothing.

149
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,880
Next, his bathing routine.

150
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,440
You have to pour water into this tub

151
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:47,560
and sprinkle some fragrances or flowers.

152
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,000
Plumeria?

153
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:53,120
He has loved plumeria ever
since he was a little child.

154
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:56,280
He said they smell sweet.
That's why he's liked them.

155
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,000
These flowers don't have long lifespan.

156
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,320
After getting them from the trees,

157
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,400
you have to soak them in water

158
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,760
because their sap is poisonous.

159
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,760
But you've got to
measure the time carefully.

160
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,440
If you're too late,

161
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:14,880
the flowers might
already wither and perish.

162
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,880
Wait here.

163
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:45,920
Yes.

164
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,680
What about the food?

165
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,400
Here.

166
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,720
No, thanks.

167
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:55,600
I'm not hungry yet.

168
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,160
It's not for you!

169
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:59,840
I'm getting you to serve it to Khun Yai.

170
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,000
Oh! It's for him!

171
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,280
Every afternoon,

172
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:08,680
unless Khun Yai accompanies Khun Luang,

173
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:11,000
he will be reading at either his desk

174
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:12,560
or the pavillion by the river.

175
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,240
You have to come here to get his dessert

176
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,200
and serve it to him
after every single meal.

177
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:22,120
Well, can I ask you something, Auntie Prik?

178
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,040
How old is Khun Yai?

179
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:30,640
He's just turned 20.

180
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,080
20...

181
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,800
So doesn't he have to

182
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,920
go to university or something like that?

183
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
What are you talking about?

184
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,800
He's got a teacher to teach him
state affiars at this house.

185
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,120
It's the teacher hired by Khun Luang.

186
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,080
He hopes his son to

187
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:52,280
work for the state just like him.

188
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,520
But...

189
00:12:55,080 --> 00:12:55,840
That's it.

190
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,800
That's all you need to know.

191
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,920
Go serve him this meal now.

192
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,440
Yes.

193
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,680
He should already
have finish his studies.

194
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:04,320
And now he's reading
in the house, I suppose.

195
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,800
Wait! Wait!

196
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,680
Yes?

197
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:12,880
Don't walk around outside at night.

198
00:13:13,293 --> 00:13:15,293
The country is undergoing a crisis.

199
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,680
The rebels are scattering around.

200
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,000
Or people will think you're one.

201
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:23,560
But if you ever think to run away at night

202
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,320
and get caught,

203
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,880
you will be in trouble for sure.

204
00:13:27,520 --> 00:13:28,720
Mark my words.

205
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,120
Go.

206
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:33,600
Yes.

207
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:44,000
Here is your dessert, Khun Yai.

208
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:46,840
Thank you so much, Jom.

209
00:13:49,646 --> 00:13:50,686
How is it going?

210
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,320
You've learned your duties from Prik.
Are you tired now?

211
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:58,320
Well, just a bit.

212
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,240
It's quite a bit, Jom.

213
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,320
But I'll try to be easy-going.

214
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Don't worry.

215
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,920
Are you secretly looking at me?

216
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:43,680
No, I'm not!

217
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,320
I'm just looking around.

218
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:51,160
And the roti you've eaten looked so tasty.

219
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,440
Roti...

220
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:59,960
Ah! Are you talking about lutti?

221
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,840
Y... Yeah!

222
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,520
It's Mother's favorite dish.

223
00:15:07,626 --> 00:15:09,026
Have you ever tried it?

224
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:13,000
Not in this style.

225
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,080
Why don't you try some?

226
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,160
No, thanks.

227
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,520
This is yours.

228
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:22,280
No worries. I don't mind.

229
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:24,960
I'll do it for you.

230
00:15:33,080 --> 00:15:33,920
Thank you.

231
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,880
How was it?

232
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,320
Very delicious!

233
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,320
I'm glad you like it.

234
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:49,440
So a while ago,

235
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,520
what were you doing?

236
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:52,920
I've just finished studying.

237
00:15:53,280 --> 00:15:54,520
So I will take a rest for a while.

238
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:55,920
I feel a bit tired now.

239
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,320
So...

240
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:03,040
can you read for me, Jom?

241
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:05,720
I want to relax

242
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,000
while enjoying my dessert.

243
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,320
Read for you?

244
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,720
I've read so many books already.

245
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,680
It might be good that
someone reads for me instead.

246
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
You can read, right?

247
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:30,760
And then Plai Kaew,

248
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,120
after Pim fell into a deep slumber,

249
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:37,400
stealthily exited their chamber

250
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,960
and directed towards Sai Thong's hastily.

251
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,800
And then he cast the spell,

252
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,920
unlatching the doors.

253
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,960
And then he slithered into the room slyly,

254
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:53,560
sitting by and cherishing her body,

255
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,400
kissing her cheeks,
thrusting at her breasts

256
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,680
until they were released
from her cloth with liberty.

257
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,720
And then he asserted his
body onto hers, embracing her,

258
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,440
fondling her, and, with
his charm, enchanting her!

259
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,080
You ran out of energy, Jom?

260
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,840
No, I didn't. It's just reading, isn't it?

261
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:19,160
I saw you frowning so much.

262
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:21,720
Really?

263
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,160
I might've been quite into it.

264
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:30,760
Into it...

265
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:39,920
Ah! It means, "getting emotionally
involved with what one's doing."

266
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:42,880
Just like I'm into reading the book now.

267
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,320
It's like an English word.

268
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:48,320
I learned it from a missionary
who was teaching me around my house.

269
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:54,920
So now you remember something, right?

270
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,240
It's not like that, Khun Yai.

271
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,240
I recalled it just a
little out of the blue.

272
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,200
Anyway, you don't like
something about the book, do you?

273
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,400
The line I just finished on!

274
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,520
Don't let me talk about it!

275
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,120
Plai Kaew is just a bastard!

276
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:22,520
How could he, after having sex with Pim,

277
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:24,400
instantly get into her nurse's room
and attack her while she was sleeping?!

278
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,800
And when she resisted him,
he just cast a spell on her!

279
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,120
This is simply sexual
assault, Khun Yai!

280
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,680
You don't like a libertine, do you?

281
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,680
Who does?!

282
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Much less him being the main character!

283
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,840
This is even worse!

284
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:40,000
I understand

285
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,920
that it's normal for men in
this period to have many wives.

286
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,840
But what Plai Kaew did
is way too much, isn't it?!

287
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,480
You're saying as if you were not
from this period or things like that.

288
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,720
Well, it's not like that, Khun Yai.

289
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:04,240
I mean the period in this poem,

290
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,280
not this very period.

291
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:12,160
Thinking about it, I
begin to feel tired now.

292
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,960
So I may put away the
dishes in the kitchen.

293
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:23,000
Into it... He's just into it.

294
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:28,760
Hey, Jom! How is it going after
being the majordomo for Khun Yai?

295
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:29,840
Is it good?

296
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:32,680
Not at all, Ming!

297
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,240
There's a lot more work than in the garden.

298
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,320
It's not just a labor job.

299
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,200
Come on! At least you'll
be more safe than here.

300
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:45,960
My foreign master hates your guts.

301
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,800
I don't know when he will get you again.

302
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,600
It's true.

303
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,840
Many people hate me.

304
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,760
That's already enough.

305
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,520
Obviously!

306
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,480
You've just become Khun Yai's majordomo out of the blue.

307
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,040
That's why they dislike you.

308
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:08,120
I think...

309
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:12,000
it's only you who envy him.

310
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:16,880
Isn't it too hard to be happy for him?

311
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:20,120
I don't think it's only me.

312
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,280
How different are you from me?

313
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,880
You want to quit this house so badly,

314
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,760
but you can't, because of your mother!

315
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,680
Lamyai!

316
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:29,400
Ming!

317
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,520
What, you got a problem?

318
00:20:32,093 --> 00:20:32,693
Ming!

319
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:33,920
Ming!

320
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,040
Am I wrong?!

321
00:20:37,413 --> 00:20:41,213
Calm down, Ming. It's
not good being like this.

322
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:44,480
Wow! What a loser!

323
00:20:49,339 --> 00:20:49,939
Ming!

324
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,440
Don't listen to her!

325
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,960
She's foul-mouthed.

326
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:08,360
But what she said was
not entirely wrong, was it?

327
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:29,520
You really enjoy reading, Khun Eeang Peung.

328
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,240
Aren't you already familiar, Maey?

329
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,080
You have been with me for so long.

330
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:42,080
One more thing, I've
got to read a lot of these,

331
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,400
in case I could make use of it someday.

332
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,680
Really?

333
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:53,000
I don't think it's always true.

334
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,120
I've seen some uneducated people around me.

335
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,440
They can still get on with their lives.

336
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,520
You're right. It's not always true.

337
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,000
But if we gather a lot of knowledge,

338
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,600
we might be able to make use of it.

339
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:14,200
And someday we could protect outselves

340
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,480
from other people,

341
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:18,920
so they wouldn't be able
to take advantage of us.

342
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:23,160
If you want to study so much,

343
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:28,600
why don't you ask Khun Luang again?

344
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,240
Forget it, Maey.

345
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,120
It'll be just the same.

346
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,600
Don't make that face.

347
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,760
I'm fine.

348
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,440
Maey, I think...

349
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:41,320
you should hide now.

350
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,920
These days, if Robert knows

351
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:48,040
that a servant like you has got
into this house at night like this,

352
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,800
I'm afraid you'll be in big trouble.

353
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,320
I'll ask you to keep
this book with you.

354
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,440
What were you doing?
What took you so long to open the doors?

355
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:26,920
I'm a woman. There are
many things I have to do

356
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:30,120
before opening my bedroom's door for a man,

357
00:24:31,819 --> 00:24:33,680
although he is my own husband.

358
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,800
So why didn't you tell me
first that you would come here?

359
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,840
I don't need to make it that
formal and ceremonious, do I?

360
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:43,280
I just want to sleep with my life.

361
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,360
Sit here, Eeang Peung.

362
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,200
It's been so long since I got to
look at your face closely like this.

363
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,840
And it's been so long since
you fulfilled your duty as my wife.

364
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,280
We see each other every
day. Aren't you sick of it?

365
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,080
No, I'm not.

366
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,400
I never get sick of you, Eeang Peung.

367
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:33,080
You're just the same.

368
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,880
You act like this every time I touch you.

369
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,480
What brings you here exactly?

370
00:25:44,120 --> 00:25:47,120
I'm considering joining the pig race
at the club on Christmas Day.

371
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,680
So I want to invite you to go with me.

372
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,800
I'm afraid I can't.

373
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,080
I'm sick of the stares and glances
from the wives of those foreign men.

374
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:04,080
I hate the way they look at me.

375
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:07,800
There's nothing to be
ashamed of if you go with me.

376
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,560
These days I've been
trying to make us powerful

377
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,440
so that they will respect
us and our family.

378
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,280
You don't need to, sir.

379
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,520
You can't even force them not
to look at me that way yourself.

380
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,720
I know...

381
00:26:27,743 --> 00:26:29,413
Talking about the pig racing,

382
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,840
have you got a pig trainer for you?

383
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:33,880
James told me

384
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:37,920
that Jom, the servant of
that house, can train pigs.

385
00:26:38,560 --> 00:26:40,800
So I think I will ask him about it.

386
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:46,600
Finally, you've ended up asking for help

387
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,280
from someone you accused, right?

388
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,240
What's wrong with you?

389
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:53,800
Why are you heckling me so much?

390
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,480
What you're doing is strange.

391
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,960
How can I agree with you?

392
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:01,920
You just do whatever you want with anyone

393
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,600
and exploit whoever you want.

394
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,680
Eeang Peung!

395
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,560
That hurts!

396
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:26,080
I think I should go

397
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:28,760
before doing something more than this.

398
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:36,960
There you go.

399
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:05,880
Are you all right, Khun Eeang Peung?

400
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,280
I'm fine.

401
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,840
I think...

402
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,240
you should go back tonight.

403
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,000
I don't know if he will
come back here again.

404
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,320
But...

405
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,160
Please, Maey.

406
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:25,920
I can be alone.

407
00:28:58,120 --> 00:29:00,360
Now I'm your husband!

408
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,320
Let me go! Mr. Robert, I'm begging you!

409
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,000
Let me go! Mr. Robert! Let me go!

410
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,320
Master!

411
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
Sir...

412
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:29,760
Maey.

413
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,280
Where have you been, Maey?

414
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:36,720
I couldn't sleep,

415
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,880
so I'm walking around here.

416
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,400
How about you? What are
you doing here at this time?

417
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,640
I couldn't sleep either,

418
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,240
so I...

419
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:51,920
You want to drink with me?

420
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:04,920
Here, Maey.

421
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,680
Thanks.

422
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,520
You're very welcome.

423
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:24,280
So why are you drinking alone?

424
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,640
Where is Jom?

425
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:29,520
Jom is way too lucky.

426
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:31,960
He's become Khun Yai's majordomo.

427
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:33,680
Really?

428
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,040
Why didn't I know that?

429
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,280
I knew.

430
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,120
You're not a gossip.

431
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,560
What's wrong, Maey?

432
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,400
What's preventing
you from sleeping?

433
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:13,560
I've got a little thing on my mind.

434
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,040
A little thing?

435
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:17,960
You can talk to me.

436
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:29,440
Ming,

437
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:40,800
have you every felt for
someone you should not have?

438
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:53,720
Of course.

439
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:00,640
I'm still feeling it right now.

440
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,800
Really?

441
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:04,840
For whom?

442
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,720
For...

443
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,360
Forget it!

444
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:40,080
Here, Maey. Drink a lot
so that you can forget it.

445
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,360
Thanks, Ming.

446
00:34:25,000 --> 00:34:27,360
This is the time you sleep, Maey?!

447
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,720
Yes, Auntie Kham Thip.

448
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:45,000
Did you drink?! You stink!

449
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:54,520
What's with that smile?

450
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,560
You're a woman.

451
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:02,640
Going out to drink at night like this,

452
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:04,600
it's dangerous.

453
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,080
What if people gossip about it?

454
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,720
They'll say,

455
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,640
that I didn't teach you right.

456
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:18,120
They'll gossip about me as well!

457
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,520
Are you worried about me?

458
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,080
I'm going to get you!

459
00:35:26,760 --> 00:35:31,240
While you're here, you're my kin.

460
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:32,920
Don't forget that.

461
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:35,280
Do you understand?

462
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,720
I've told you so many times

463
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:01,160
that the foreign master hates it
when his servants drink in his house.

464
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,280
Huh?! Ming!

465
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,360
The foreign master...

466
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,000
The foreign master...

467
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,720
If he hates it, just let him be, then.

468
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:19,240
Or actually, it's not him.

469
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,000
But it's you who hate it.

470
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,080
What are you talking about?

471
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,960
You hate it when I drink

472
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,600
because this was what Dad did, right?

473
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,080
Dad, who dumped you.

474
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:34,720
Ming!

475
00:36:35,720 --> 00:36:36,920
Or you're saying I'm wrong?

476
00:36:38,120 --> 00:36:41,920
If you still don't listen to me,
I'll just stop and let you be!

477
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,720
Khun Yai, do you feel comfortable

478
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,520
with sleeping in this house?

479
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,440
I think your bedroom in the main house

480
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,480
doesn't have a lot of space.

481
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,760
I feel better sleeping here.

482
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:15,680
Jom,

483
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:29,200
what would you do if I couldn't sleep?

484
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,000
Well...

485
00:37:34,200 --> 00:37:39,520
Why don't you count sheep
to put yourself to sleep?

486
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,520
One,

487
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,800
two,

488
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:48,160
three,

489
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:51,400
and four, five, six... Just keep counting.

490
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,440
Does it work on you?

491
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:02,760
Not at all. I even lose count at ten.

492
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,120
So why did you suggest this, Jom?

493
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,720
So what else...?

494
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,680
How about having someone scratch your back?

495
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,600
I used to do that when I was a kid.

496
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,880
It worked very well, I can tell.

497
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:27,480
So would you do that for me?

498
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,160
Never mind.

499
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:41,840
Today was your big day, actually.

500
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,240
You can scractch my back on another day.

501
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,800
Take your full rest tonight.

502
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:53,000
There are more things I've
got to teach you tomorrow.

503
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:55,840
Yes, sir.

504
00:39:50,800 --> 00:39:53,760
I'm telling you that this house...

505
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:55,440
this house is for both of us.

506
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:56,640
I'm sorry.

507
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,520
I didn't want things to
turn out this way either.

508
00:40:00,120 --> 00:40:01,760
2 years!!

509
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:04,520
2 years, I waited for you.

510
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:12,480
Why did you choose me

511
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,840
to be your majordomo?

512
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:25,320
Why didn't you choose any other servant?

513
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,640
Did you hear something they said

514
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:30,360
that made you nervous?

515
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:31,960
Not at all, sir.

516
00:40:32,720 --> 00:40:34,840
I just want to know.

517
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:38,840
A majordomo is an intimate position, Jom.

518
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,160
He is like my friend.

519
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:44,320
He is the one who
manages everything for me.

520
00:40:46,520 --> 00:40:48,720
So it must be someone I can trust

521
00:40:50,440 --> 00:40:54,880
and favor to some extent.

522
00:40:59,080 --> 00:41:03,640
But he must be competent as well.

523
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,880
He must be able to read,
write, and work on documents.

524
00:41:07,640 --> 00:41:10,240
How about others?

525
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:12,120
Does it mean that any other
guys who want my position

526
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:14,840
will never have the right?

527
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:17,400
It might not sound good, Jom,

528
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:22,720
but, at the end of the day,
I'm not the one finalising the decision.

529
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:26,040
But it's Father.

530
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,320
How is it going?

531
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,120
Can you do it?

532
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:21,360
I'm all right now.

533
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,080
I'm getting familiar with the typewriter.

534
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,240
I don't have any more problems when typing.

535
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:30,520
There's only the layout stuff

536
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,920
that I'm not quite sure about.

537
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:36,600
Let me see.

538
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:49,320
Exactly.

539
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:54,440
You seem to type it fast,
and every word is correct.

540
00:42:55,933 --> 00:43:01,133
But you need to work on paragraphing more.

541
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:04,920
I knew it.

542
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,760
Can you please insert
another piece of paper here?

543
00:43:10,692 --> 00:43:11,320
Yes, sir.

544
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,440
What are you doing, Khun Yai?

545
00:43:31,120 --> 00:43:32,680
I'm going to help you, Jom.

546
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:36,920
Thank you.

547
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:41,280
When you want to start typing a document

548
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:43,320
or writing a new chapter,

549
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,040
press this button to indent the
first line for a new paragraph.

550
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:49,080
Here.

551
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:56,320
Ah! It's the "tab" button!

552
00:43:57,000 --> 00:43:58,080
I knew it.

553
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:31,260
Did you forget it?

554
00:44:49,840 --> 00:44:53,920
Jom, you're distracted and
making a mess of the document.

555
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:56,560
I'm sorry.

556
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:00,200
Yai!

557
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:04,000
Lek!

558
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,400
Eh? Are you here as well, Jom?

559
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,360
Yes, sir.

560
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:12,120
Are you helping Yai with his work?

561
00:45:14,120 --> 00:45:17,520
Oh! Didn't I tell you, Khun Lek,

562
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,040
not to get into this house
when your brother is working?

563
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,760
I just wanted him to draw me a picture.

564
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,040
I don't know why you're getting in my way.

565
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,600
That's fine, Prik.

566
00:45:30,440 --> 00:45:34,320
So, please draw me a picture.

567
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:38,720
Please, Yai.

568
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:05,320
I'm done.

569
00:46:08,520 --> 00:46:09,880
How is it, Lek?

570
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:13,320
This is not the airplane in my head, Yai.

571
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,240
Not pretty at all.

572
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,280
Well... Khun Yai,

573
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:29,000
can I see it?

574
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:33,720
Well...

575
00:46:34,920 --> 00:46:36,000
I don't think you should see it.

576
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:40,360
Please. Just for a moment.

577
00:46:43,320 --> 00:46:45,000
Don't be shy.

578
00:46:46,080 --> 00:46:46,760
Please.

579
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:02,000
Look! I knew it!

580
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,600
I didn't say anything, did I?

581
00:47:05,600 --> 00:47:08,200
It's cute.

582
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:12,120
Khun Lek,

583
00:47:13,080 --> 00:47:15,120
if you don't like it,

584
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:16,920
can I draw you a new one?

585
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:18,160
Can you draw?

586
00:47:18,440 --> 00:47:19,080
Yes, I can.

587
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:21,280
What kind of airplane do you want?

588
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:23,520
You can tell me, so I can draw you one.

589
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:26,000
I don't want an airplane any longer.

590
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:30,240
Ah! You're looking after my piglet.

591
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,480
So can you draw me the piglet

592
00:47:34,480 --> 00:47:36,360
that you're looking after for me?

593
00:47:36,800 --> 00:47:38,360
I will show it to Father.

594
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:40,240
Of course.

595
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:24,200
Do you like this, Khun Lek?

596
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:29,720
Khun Lek!

597
00:48:36,120 --> 00:48:37,240
Mr. Jom!

598
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:40,480
Uncle Tan!

599
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:45,200
Uncle Tan!

600
00:48:47,280 --> 00:48:48,040
Uncle Tan!

601
00:48:51,080 --> 00:48:51,840
Uncle Tan!

602
00:48:53,240 --> 00:48:54,160
Uncle Tan!

603
00:48:59,640 --> 00:49:00,720
Jom!

604
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:07,480
Jom!

605
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:10,080
Jom!

606
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:13,120
Jom!

607
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:15,920
Jom!

608
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:21,500
Jom!

609
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,080
Oh! Khun Lek!

610
00:49:29,120 --> 00:49:30,080
I'm sorry.

611
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,120
What's going on?

612
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:38,920
What are you guys doing?

613
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:44,720
Nothing.

614
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,680
Lek has just got Jom
to draw him the piglet.

615
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,800
So what brings you here?

616
00:49:51,800 --> 00:49:55,240
You rarely visit this place.

617
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,840
James told me that you could train a pig.

618
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:01,760
So I want to see it with my own two eyes.

619
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,480
Right. He's very good at it.

620
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:06,126
He's training my piglet.

621
00:50:07,120 --> 00:50:10,040
Why do you want to train your pig?

622
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:12,960
Or...

623
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:16,120
Yes. I want Jom to train my pig

624
00:50:16,145 --> 00:50:17,825
for the race on Christmas Day.

625
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:20,320
If I win,

626
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:23,320
I will give him a huge prize, I think.

627
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:27,120
I'm afraid that is
not going to happen.

628
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:32,920
Now he is my majordomo.

629
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:38,120
Why did you choose him?!

630
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:42,120
I thought that this job suited him.

631
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:46,800
So can I get him to train
my pig for the race, Yai?

632
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:50,320
I can give him a special wage.

633
00:50:51,120 --> 00:50:52,080
I'm afraid not.

634
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:55,720
Now he's got so much work to do.

635
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,520
I think you'd better find someone else.

636
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,600
Fine, Yai.

637
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,360
I will never mess with your person.

638
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,120
But keep it mind,

639
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:13,800
what I'm doing will
bring fame to our house.

640
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:16,920
If you don't support me, that's fine.

641
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:33,640
Where are you taking me, Prik?

642
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:35,400
Please let me go.

643
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:40,480
Khun Yai.

644
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:41,920
I have told you, Khun Yai,

645
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,720
that Jom will bring trouble to you someday.

646
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:48,000
But nothing has yet happened, right?

647
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,520
I can manage it.

648
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:51,120
Not now.

649
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,760
But please think about it.

650
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,280
Mr. Robert is Khun Luang's favorite.

651
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:57,800
If he can convince him,

652
00:51:57,920 --> 00:51:59,520
what will do you then?

653
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:06,360
Prik, I understand that you worry about me,

654
00:52:07,120 --> 00:52:10,720
but can you also trust me

655
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:12,240
to make my own decisions?

656
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,880
I'm not a kid any more.

657
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:23,480
And you know that, up to this time,

658
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:28,200
I...

659
00:52:32,120 --> 00:52:36,400
I haven't had many chances
to choose things for myself.

660
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:46,960
If you mention this point,

661
00:52:50,120 --> 00:52:52,120
how can I resist you?

662
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,640
Thank you so much, Prik.

663
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:20,200
The liquor is gone!

664
00:53:41,120 --> 00:53:42,120
What is wrong with him?

665
00:53:42,520 --> 00:53:44,800
Drinking all the liquor
and disturbing others.

666
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,360
Leave him like that. He
looks insane, actually.

667
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,920
By the way, how come you're this rich?!

668
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:54,520
You're treating us to
liquor every single day.

669
00:53:54,520 --> 00:53:57,920
I was about to ask you, too.

670
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:01,680
I'm just... working for a foreign master.

671
00:54:02,824 --> 00:54:05,560
What kind of work? Can we do it, too?

672
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:08,000
Just the work to kick out his
tenants who can't pay the rental.

673
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:11,720
I did something at a woman's
house until she couldn't stand it

674
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:14,600
and finally left. Nothing much...

675
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:16,520
You bastard!

676
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:19,520
You don't even share
your job with friends like us!

677
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,080
Come on! It's dangerous!

678
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:23,640
You don't need to know that.

679
00:54:24,520 --> 00:54:27,640
What a shame! The daughter of that house

680
00:54:28,373 --> 00:54:31,893
was bloody pretty! Now she
must've already gotten married, I think.

681
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:37,400
What the hell is wrong
with you from the start?

682
00:54:37,480 --> 00:54:38,920
Then what the hell is
wrong with you bastards?

683
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,920
We're just talking. Not
even your bloody business.

684
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,360
So what were you bloody talking about?

685
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,600
Who were you talking about?!

686
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,120
This bastard!

687
00:55:00,520 --> 00:55:01,160
Let go of me!

688
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:13,200
Khun Lek.

689
00:55:13,800 --> 00:55:17,120
I'm not playing anymore,
please stop running.

690
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,520
Oh, be careful!

691
00:55:20,800 --> 00:55:22,200
Khun Lek.

692
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,800
Oh my, Khun Lek.

693
00:55:26,716 --> 00:55:29,866
No more running, you'll slip and fall.

694
00:55:30,080 --> 00:55:30,920
Khun Lek.

695
00:55:31,320 --> 00:55:34,400
I'm not playing anymore.

696
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:39,720
Oh?

697
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:40,720
Dad.

698
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:43,520
Hey, has school closed yet?

699
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,800
Yes, I've been home for a while.

700
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,320
Come here. Come here.

701
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:50,000
I missed you so much.

702
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,920
Sit, sit.

703
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:00,360
Chan, put away my belongings.

704
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:01,600
Yes, sir.

705
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:05,920
Have you finished your work, sir?

706
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:09,320
Everyone is perfect here, Kaekai?

707
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:13,120
Yes, it is. There's nothing to worry about.

708
00:56:14,920 --> 00:56:17,120
It seems like I've got some good news

709
00:56:17,120 --> 00:56:18,640
to tell you, Kaekai.

710
00:56:22,080 --> 00:56:24,760
I'd better tell you all at
once when we're together.

711
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,000
Father,

712
00:56:27,880 --> 00:56:29,760
I've got something to show you.

713
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:31,800
What's that?

714
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,320
Prik, get that drawing for me.

715
00:56:37,880 --> 00:56:38,640
Yes, sir.

716
00:56:43,410 --> 00:56:45,120
You weren't a stubborn boy, right?

717
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,400
Here, Father.

718
00:56:56,840 --> 00:57:00,480
Did you do it yourself?!
Have you got such talent?!

719
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:02,320
No, I didn't.

720
00:57:03,360 --> 00:57:05,240
It's Yai's new majordomo.

721
00:57:05,240 --> 00:57:06,400
He drew it for me.

722
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:09,720
A new majordomo?

723
00:57:33,320 --> 00:57:36,440
Who is he?

724
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,280
My name is Jom, sir.

725
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:40,880
That's it?

726
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:43,120
And where do you come from?

727
00:57:44,080 --> 00:57:46,400
Well, I...

728
00:57:48,120 --> 00:57:49,640
He can't remember, Father.

729
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:51,520
He was lost.

730
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:53,960
So that was how you just let him in?

731
00:57:55,000 --> 00:57:55,840
Yes, Father.

732
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:57,720
But don't worry.

733
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:02,640
Nothing bad has happened
yet since he lived here.

734
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:07,640
What if he caused any trouble?

735
00:58:08,600 --> 00:58:09,760
I'd be responsible for it myself.

736
00:58:10,080 --> 00:58:13,040
Huh! You?

737
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:14,040
Yes, Father.

738
00:58:15,440 --> 00:58:17,400
I'd be responsible for it myself.

739
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,040
Finally, you've said this word
after leaving me waiting for so long.

740
00:58:28,040 --> 00:58:29,800
I've inspected the upper floor.

741
00:58:30,120 --> 00:58:31,800
Everything is good, sir.

742
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,360
There are no weapons or
any deadly objects in his room.

743
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,240
Do you see that, Father?

744
00:58:38,080 --> 00:58:39,240
He has done nothing wrong.

745
00:58:39,720 --> 00:58:41,120
If you think so,

746
00:58:42,520 --> 00:58:44,400
why don't you get him to
work a little bit to see if it works?

747
00:58:49,320 --> 00:58:50,320
Yes, I can.

748
00:59:13,520 --> 00:59:14,240
I'm finished, sir.

749
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:34,280
Not too bad.

750
00:59:37,320 --> 00:59:40,000
But I still don't trust him that much.

751
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:42,640
Why not, Father?

752
00:59:44,320 --> 00:59:46,200
Be it Thai or English documents,

753
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:50,440
Jom can do them all.

754
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:53,760
So doesn't it mean that he
can do everything like Chan?

755
00:59:54,112 --> 00:59:57,152
He can't even remember his own history,

756
00:59:58,513 --> 01:00:01,233
so how can you trust this kind of person?

757
01:00:02,120 --> 01:00:05,840
So I have to choose only
what you have chosen for me.

758
01:00:06,080 --> 01:00:07,080
Is that right, Father?

759
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,440
When it comes to my own business,

760
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,440
you seem to have some problems.

761
01:00:14,520 --> 01:00:15,520
You!

762
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:20,760
Now I don't want to rebuke you too much,

763
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,400
or I won't be in the mood
to tell you my good news.

764
01:00:25,080 --> 01:00:27,400
Uncle Dech will dine with us here tonight.

765
01:00:27,920 --> 01:00:29,240
Prepare yourself.

766
01:00:29,600 --> 01:00:32,320
Tell your majordomo
to prepare you an outfit.

767
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:37,600
I'm leaving.

768
01:01:13,240 --> 01:01:16,440
Are you still upset, Jom?

769
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:18,760
A bit, sir.

770
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,000
I never though that Khun Luang...

771
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:30,400
Well, your father. I never
thought he would be this strict.

772
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:37,800
That's normal. You'll
get used to it after a while.

773
01:01:44,933 --> 01:01:49,413
So why did you have to help me that much?

774
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:56,840
As I said earlier,

775
01:01:59,080 --> 01:02:00,680
I just want to choose what I want

776
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,040
and go by my wish sometimes.

777
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,000
The suit is better.

778
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:39,880
You can go to bed before me tonight.

779
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:42,000
I might come back late.

780
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:43,200
You don't need to wait.

781
01:02:43,720 --> 01:02:44,720
Take a rest, then.

782
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:48,120
Yes, sir.

783
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:53,240
I'm going.

784
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:31,440
Jom...

785
01:03:36,240 --> 01:03:37,400
Jom...

786
01:03:41,080 --> 01:03:41,720
Khun Yai!

787
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:42,520
Khun Yai!

788
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:45,840
Jom...

789
01:03:46,720 --> 01:03:47,720
Khun Yai

790
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:00,520
Jom...

791
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:02,640
Yes?

792
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:06,680
I'm drunk, I suppose.

793
01:04:09,840 --> 01:04:12,640
Yes, you are. Very drunk, actually.

794
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,480
So let me take you to your room.

795
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:22,240
Slowly get up.

796
01:04:22,240 --> 01:04:23,960
Hold me tight.

797
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:28,080
Ok

798
01:04:28,080 --> 01:04:29,120
Walk slowly.

799
01:04:42,760 --> 01:04:47,840
Khun Yai, wait a minute.

800
01:04:49,320 --> 01:04:50,320
I'm going to turn on the light.

801
01:04:59,840 --> 01:05:02,440
Khun Yai, please go up and lie on your bed!

802
01:05:10,080 --> 01:05:10,880
Khun Yai!

803
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:11,680
Jom...

804
01:05:13,120 --> 01:05:13,680
Yes?

805
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,920
Here is my Jom...

806
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:26,640
I thought I was dreaming...

807
01:05:27,120 --> 01:05:28,320
Dreaming?

808
01:05:30,080 --> 01:05:32,920
I think I'd better bring a
wet cloth to clean your body.

809
01:05:38,320 --> 01:05:39,000
Yes?

810
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,360
Jom...

811
01:05:48,800 --> 01:05:50,760
Be with me here...

812
01:05:51,807 --> 01:05:53,127
Don't go...

813
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:02,360
You drink often, don't you?

814
01:06:07,720 --> 01:06:09,000
Not really...

815
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,640
I drink at times...

816
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:25,520
Did you have a fight with Khun Luang?

817
01:06:56,440 --> 01:06:57,400
Jom...

818
01:07:04,060 --> 01:07:05,780
Where is your mind wandering?

819
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:09,120
No, it's not.

820
01:07:12,720 --> 01:07:18,480
Are you thinking of your departed lover?

821
01:07:23,440 --> 01:07:30,080
I... I don't have such a thing, sir.

822
01:07:32,120 --> 01:07:34,000
Not a single one?

823
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,400
It was ended, actually.

824
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:52,160
You're really drunk, aren't you?

825
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:05,640
Not a drop of liquor to interfere,
drunk on love's celestial bliss

826
01:08:09,080 --> 01:08:14,240
I've tried to resist
this sweet intoxication

827
01:08:17,120 --> 01:08:23,440
no matter how drunk I am,
sobriety comes with the morning light

828
01:08:27,086 --> 01:08:33,006
Drunk on love, my
heart undone every night

829
01:08:42,520 --> 01:08:44,840
You seem to be following the steps
of the poet, Phraya Sisunthonwohan.

830
01:08:45,000 --> 01:08:47,720
Soon you'll have about
10 wives under your arm.

831
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:52,320
Lovers?

832
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:59,520
One is enough for me.

833
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:45,000
Drawings?

834
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:47,000
Just some drawings?

835
01:09:47,280 --> 01:09:49,480
I thought it would be something
more valuable than these.

836
01:10:27,480 --> 01:10:31,560
(Next Episode) Did I accidentally
do something to you last night?

837
01:10:32,040 --> 01:10:34,360
What are you going to do?

838
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:37,320
I was afraid that the alcohol,

839
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:41,600
might have accidentally made me do
something from my deepest desires.

840
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:43,880
Jom, do you want to try making a garland?

841
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:48,720
Maen is being punished by
the foreign master in the kitchen.

842
01:10:48,720 --> 01:10:49,880
Oh..

843
01:10:50,120 --> 01:10:51,600
Do you know Prik?

844
01:10:51,600 --> 01:10:53,400
I have something important
to discuss with him.

845
01:10:53,400 --> 01:10:55,960
Prik is about to be punished
by Khun Yai's parents.

846
01:10:56,520 --> 01:10:59,520
As for Jom, an accomplice with Prik,

847
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:00,720
must be punished as well.
