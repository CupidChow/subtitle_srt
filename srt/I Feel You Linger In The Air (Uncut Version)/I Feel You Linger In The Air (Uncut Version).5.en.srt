1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
(Previously)
So now we're living under the same roof,

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:05,720
He has loved plumeria ever
since he was a little child.

3
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:06,880
He said they smell sweet.

4
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:09,160
Why did you choose me?

5
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:11,441
A majordomo is an intimate position, Jom.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,480
He drew it for me.

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:18,680
Now I don't want to rebuke you too much,

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,320
Tell your majordomo to
prepare you some outfits.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,776
Yes, you are. Very drunk, actually.

10
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:25,920
Not a drop of liquor to interfere,
drunk on love's celestial bliss

11
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,220
Drawings?

12
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:08,307
Hey! You!

13
00:02:09,273 --> 00:02:10,713
Khun Yai, there's someone...

14
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:13,714
Hey!

15
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,795
Khun Yai.

16
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,425
Be careful with that.

17
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,080
If it breaks, we will be scolded again.

18
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:27,720
This house is truly haunted.

19
00:02:28,412 --> 00:02:30,663
No matter how much we
renovate, it's never finished.

20
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,505
If it was my house,

21
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,800
I would already have it demolished.

22
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,730
Hey, hey

23
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,000
watch your mouth.

24
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:44,048
This house is old

25
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,960
so it's deteriorated over time.

26
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,560
If you're not satisfied
and just think about demolishing it,

27
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,336
what will others remember your story from?

28
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,505
Go get the stuff outside, there
are still many things to carry.

29
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,720
Uncle Tan!

30
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,200
Uncle Tan!

31
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,520
When did you get here?

32
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,435
I just got here moments ago.

33
00:03:09,713 --> 00:03:11,153
You didn't come here last night?

34
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,962
No, I didn't

35
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,600
Uncle Tan, the tree fell.

36
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,784
Come and help me.

37
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,654
Wait Uncle Tan!

38
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,960
Wait!

39
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,628
Wait!

40
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:26,400
Uncle Tan!

41
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:27,639
Open, open!

42
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:28,680
Uncle Tan!

43
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,448
Open...

44
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,811
Uncle Tan!

45
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,276
What happened?

46
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,800
Why were you shouting like that?

47
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:11,596
I thought I saw something

48
00:04:14,880 --> 00:04:16,328
but it was just my imagination.

49
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:24,760
You must really miss
the place you came from.

50
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,120
I heard you calling out for an uncle.

51
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,960
It's nothing.

52
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,635
It's really nothing.

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:03,301
Jom.

54
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:11,321
You're here with me.

55
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:21,113
Just think of this as another home.

56
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:04,500
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 5)

57
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:07,927
I need to ask you for something.

58
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,944
Yes?

59
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:16,400
Last night..

60
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,083
Did I accidentally do
something to you last night?

61
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,217
Last night?

62
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,322
Yes, you know that I was very drunk.

63
00:08:39,840 --> 00:08:40,520
You did.

64
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,616
What did I do?

65
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,127
Please tell me.

66
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,000
You were very drunk last night.

67
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,011
You suddenly put your hands like this

68
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:54,200
and pushed it to my face like this

69
00:08:54,800 --> 00:09:02,000
then slowly placed your
thumbs on my eyebrows like this

70
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,000
and said to me

71
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,800
You're here with me.

72
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:20,360
Just think of this as another home.

73
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,509
And massaged my eyebrows like this.

74
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:43,729
Uh.. I'm sorry, I was just.

75
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,400
It's okay, I already told you,

76
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,869
I'm not an egotistical person like that.

77
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,120
I feel relieved.

78
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,803
Last night I was afraid,

79
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,828
afraid that I was not in my right mind

80
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:11,209
and I accidentally did
something bad to you.

81
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,164
What were you going to do?

82
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:23,000
I was afraid that the
effect of the alcohol,

83
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,600
would will make me accidentally

84
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,512
follow my wishes.

85
00:10:36,386 --> 00:10:37,880
But I don't want it to be like that

86
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,481
because I want to
honor the people that I...

87
00:10:49,280 --> 00:10:50,051
uh...

88
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
I'm going to go now.

89
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,240
Hey, hey

90
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,583
Oh.

91
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,139
Jom

92
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:40,893
Oh Ming, what are you doing?

93
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,800
My master sent me to
deliver some documets for Luang Nititham.

94
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:53,400
Your face..

95
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,240
Ouch, that hurts.

96
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:59,880
Could you be more gentle? It hurts.

97
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,961
I'm sorry.

98
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:03,253
What happened?

99
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:12,962
Ming.

100
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,498
Hey! Ming!

101
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,135
What it is Maey?

102
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,400
Is there something wrong?

103
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,487
Something bad has happened.

104
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,394
My master has sent me to fetch you.

105
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:24,675
Auntie Maen is being
punished by the foreign master.

106
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:28,560
Mom!

107
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,800
Wait for me!

108
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,897
You are really foolish Maen.

109
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,680
Lately, you seem to be out of your mind,

110
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,307
I don't think I can keep you anymore.

111
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,080
Hit her so that she learns her lesson!

112
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,483
Mom!!

113
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:51,440
I said stop!

114
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,656
You're the one that needs to stop!

115
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:00,434
Are you going against my orders?!

116
00:13:04,253 --> 00:13:05,803
What did my mother do?

117
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,046
Why do you have to punish her?

118
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,280
Your mother almost burned my house down!

119
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,320
But the fire did not spread so much

120
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,263
and my mother is already old.

121
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:44,760
Why are you so angry at my mother?

122
00:13:45,107 --> 00:13:48,524
If I didn't smell the smoke
and send someone to look

123
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,160
by now, my house would probably
have been completely destroyed.

124
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,971
Ming, I was wrong.

125
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:57,320
So I must admit to being wrong

126
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,680
But Mom...

127
00:13:58,800 --> 00:13:59,806
That's enough.

128
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:18,167
In that case, my lord,
please punish me instead.

129
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:19,120
Ming!

130
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,509
Okay, bring the stick.

131
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,520
I'll punish him myself.

132
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,361
Oh, it hurts.

133
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,313
Ah, take it and compress it.

134
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:11,946
What's this?

135
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,751
Just take it.

136
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,840
It's herbs that will help relieve bruising.

137
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,640
Don't ask too many questions,
just do what I tell you to.

138
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,905
I don't know why you help me.

139
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,956
And if it was me who was punished by him?

140
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,189
Would you come help me?

141
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:47,066
Hurry and apply the
herbs so you'll get better.

142
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,515
You're hurt but your still sassy.

143
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,000
Ow.

144
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,880
Give it to me and I'll compress it for you.

145
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:21,200
Come on.

146
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:25,910
Give it to me.

147
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:39,646
Move closer.

148
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,739
Oh mom, it hurts.

149
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:50,080
It hurts, Mom, it hurts.

150
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:41,760
Jom.

151
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:42,720
Yes?

152
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:48,335
Is there something wrong?

153
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,184
Well... I have a question.

154
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:03,117
What's the matter? You can ask me.

155
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:13,018
What is Mr.Robert like?

156
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:21,080
Why do you want to know
about my brother-in-law?

157
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:29,832
Well... I just don't feel
very good about him.

158
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,200
Jom.

159
00:18:36,386 --> 00:18:38,059
Don't be afraid to ask me.

160
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,200
You're not the only one who feels this way.

161
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,080
Sit.

162
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,360
Uh... thank you.

163
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,142
I've had my doubts with Robert
from the first time I laid my eyes on him.

164
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:08,285
But I couldn't say much

165
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:11,980
because he is father's favorite.

166
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,150
But what I'm more worried about

167
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,093
is my older sister.

168
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,400
Today I saw Ming

169
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,724
and he told me that

170
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:37,120
he and his mother were
punished by lashing last night

171
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,854
so I can't help but worry about Ming.

172
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,208
I wonder how he's doing.

173
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,334
I'll try to bring this up
with my father and mother.

174
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,002
Jom, you don't have to worry.

175
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,200
If there is something serious

176
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:02,583
then my family would probably already know.

177
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,507
Thank you very much, Khun Yai.

178
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,120
So, sweet dreams.

179
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,159
Good night, Jom.

180
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:58,960
Yai... is something wrong?

181
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,050
That expression doesn't look good at all.

182
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,040
It's nothing mother.

183
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,480
I'm worried about Phueng.

184
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:13,687
Hmm... You're worried about your sister?

185
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,646
What are you worried about?

186
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:24,089
I heard that at that house,
they punished their elderly servants.

187
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,458
What?

188
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:28,563
So I was worried about what
it would be like for Pueng.

189
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,366
What could happen to her?

190
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,240
She's his wife.

191
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,060
Plus, Robert really puts
your sister on a pedestal.

192
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,120
He wouldn't dare.

193
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:45,480
You should stop listening to these stories

194
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,300
from all the servants.

195
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:51,440
It's their home and they have
their own way of running it.

196
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,200
You should worry about yourself.

197
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:00,720
It's true Khun Yai.

198
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,040
It's not like the servants
at that house are innocent,

199
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,360
they are really sneaky!

200
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:10,021
The punishment was probably for show.

201
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:11,225
Prik!

202
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,200
Lately, you've been paying
a lot of attention to my house.

203
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:20,520
The matters in my family
are discussed by the people in this family.

204
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,231
It has nothing to do with you.

205
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,264
There's nothing.

206
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,970
Let's eat.

207
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,360
Jom.

208
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:06,840
Jom.

209
00:23:12,280 --> 00:23:12,960
Jom.

210
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:46,520
Jom.

211
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,200
It's me.

212
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:51,373
Khamsaen.

213
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,480
What are you doing here?

214
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,788
Are you here to cause more problems?

215
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:57,720
I have something I need to tell Fong Kaew,

216
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,240
something about her family.

217
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,680
Could you give her this letter?

218
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,520
What? Why does it have to be me again?

219
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,604
I don't know who else to turn to.

220
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,800
You're the only one in
this house that I know.

221
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,874
Another thing is, if you feel
bad about what you did last time

222
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:24,120
then this is your chance to fix things.

223
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:32,800
Please?

224
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,487
I'm begging you.

225
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,144
Jom.

226
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,080
Fine.

227
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:41,200
Tomorrow I'm going to that house

228
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:42,760
and I'll deliver the letter to Fong Kaew.

229
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:46,040
Thank you so much.

230
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:49,400
But the only thing I ask of you

231
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:54,680
is that after I send to letter to Fong Kaew

232
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,244
from now on

233
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:01,760
I want the both of you to leave me alone.

234
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,520
Here are some snacks, Khun Yai.

235
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,463
Jom.

236
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:36,664
What's wrong?

237
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:40,925
Nothing is wrong.

238
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,960
Is it that obvious?

239
00:27:56,120 --> 00:28:00,233
I have something bothering me.

240
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,000
I'm starting to get used to it.

241
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,310
Khun Yai.

242
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:21,000
Hmm? You know how to make garlands?

243
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:22,800
Yes.

244
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,760
My mother taught me when I was a child.

245
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,200
That's strange.

246
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:33,819
Normally, I don't see many families

247
00:28:33,880 --> 00:28:35,520
teach their sons how
to make flower garlands.

248
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,262
It's not strange at all.

249
00:28:41,800 --> 00:28:46,249
Is making flower garlands
something only women do?

250
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:49,674
That's true...

251
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:53,527
When I was a child

252
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,520
I wasn't strong and healthy like other boys

253
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,048
my mother was worried

254
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,662
she thought I lost my
spirit when I was born.

255
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,200
So she started making making
flower garlands and Baci.

256
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:09,250
When my mother started making them,

257
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:11,394
I regained my health

258
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:15,040
and it stuck as a habit.

259
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:18,216
When I feel uneasy,

260
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,308
I start making flower garlands.

261
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,400
So right now,

262
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:29,060
is there something bothering you?

263
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,073
I feel like this question,

264
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:41,298
should be directed at you.

265
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:46,204
Do you want to try making a flower garland?

266
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:56,092
We will intertwine and intersect.

267
00:29:57,480 --> 00:30:00,120
One step here, then here.

268
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,720
Insert in the middle.

269
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,400
In the middle.

270
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,640
Ow.

271
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,440
Jom.

272
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:23,195
I'm ok.

273
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,362
Eh!

274
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,000
Are you okay?

275
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,020
I'm fine.

276
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,610
It's a minor wound.

277
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:35,246
Here.

278
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:40,200
Then plug it in.

279
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:42,288
Yes.

280
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,739
Bring it this way.

281
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:50,760
Yes

282
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:51,800
Turn the flower this way.

283
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:21,320
The last flower.

284
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,080
Please check my work Teacher Yai.

285
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,600
It's great.

286
00:31:42,600 --> 00:31:45,600
I wouldn't believe it
if you told me this was your first time.

287
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,160
It's because my teacher was good.

288
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:55,960
It smells so nice.

289
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:51,928
Kham Thip.

290
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:52,939
Yes?

291
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,939
Mr.Robert hasn't come down yet?

292
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,800
He hasn't come down yet.

293
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:18,291
Khun Ying, I have something to tell you.

294
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,037
What is the matter?

295
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,800
You're constantly
gossiping about other people.

296
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:27,280
You, I love you like a
child, like a grandchild.

297
00:35:27,546 --> 00:35:29,546
Look at you trying to
find words to insult me.

298
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,120
But isn't it the truth?

299
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,400
What? I haven't said anything yet.

300
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
That's enough.

301
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,169
If you have something
to say, say it quickly.

302
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:42,494
Last night, I secretly saw Fong
Kaew doing something horrendous.

303
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:47,013
Could you explain how it was horrendous?

304
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:54,314
Yes, last night, late at night.

305
00:35:55,080 --> 00:35:56,438
Come on in.

306
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:44,200
Wearing a red dress like a slut.

307
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,782
Auntie, that's enough.

308
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:48,800
Miss Eeang Peung.

309
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,560
Don't listen to her.

310
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:55,240
She likes to blow things out of proportion.

311
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,425
That's true..

312
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,775
I've never seen Kham Thip act

313
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,406
the way she said.

314
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,880
Fine, you'll see it for
yourself soon enough.

315
00:37:07,360 --> 00:37:09,559
I'm never wrong about people.

316
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,720
What's for breakfast?

317
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:21,013
I'm starving.

318
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:37,760
Don't be surprised Eeang Peung.

319
00:37:38,513 --> 00:37:41,503
I just want Fong Kaew to feel
like she's part of our family.

320
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,200
Listen up.

321
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:54,240
From now on, Fong Kaew
will be joining us for every meal

322
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:56,800
so you all have prepare her
meals they same way as ours.

323
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:58,800
Yes.

324
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,568
Well? Thip?

325
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,360
Go get her plate.

326
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,252
Come on, quickly.

327
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:09,800
Quickly set the table.

328
00:38:48,520 --> 00:38:50,002
What wrong Maey?

329
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,394
I saw you look worried
since after breakfast.

330
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,720
I'm just beginning to believe
Aunt Kham Thip's words.

331
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,080
After seeing Fong Kaew

332
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,860
Walking with master like that.

333
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:15,567
It's good now, let her
have a status worthy of a wife.

334
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,611
I don't take offense.

335
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:24,480
But I'm afraid that Fong Kaew
will do bad things to you after this.

336
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,845
Do you remember?

337
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,317
This is why we brought her here.

338
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:39,705
Let Fong Kaew be his favorite.

339
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,080
Isn't it a good thing?

340
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,200
But...

341
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:56,316
Maey, what we thought
out is going well, don't worry.

342
00:40:42,600 --> 00:40:44,391
May my suffering

343
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,750
float away with this garland.

344
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,200
Young man.

345
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,548
Young man, don't go yet.

346
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,480
Come on, quickly.

347
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:29,800
Where did you come from?

348
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,000
Wait, don't say anything yet, just help me.

349
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:31,960
Ok.

350
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:34,751
Ow.

351
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,600
Help me get up.

352
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,440
Sure.

353
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:39,802
Ow.

354
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:44,215
Who are you?

355
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:46,771
Puk, my name is Puk.

356
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,602
Auntie Puk.

357
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:52,209
Ok.

358
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:54,280
What are you doing here?

359
00:41:55,760 --> 00:41:57,207
Do you know Prik?

360
00:41:57,960 --> 00:41:59,657
I have something
important to talk to her about.

361
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:01,920
Auntie Prik.

362
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,444
Please help me.

363
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,360
Please, I beg of you boy.

364
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,150
Ok, sure.

365
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:43,880
Bang! Bang! Bang! I got you!

366
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:46,520
Ok.

367
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:49,066
I lost! Khun Lek, you've won.

368
00:42:50,120 --> 00:42:51,960
Now that you've won

369
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:53,680
should we take a rest?

370
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,240
We've been playing for a long time.

371
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,160
It's because you're old!

372
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:00,880
Try to catch a tiger like me!

373
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,480
Um, Khun Lek

374
00:43:04,960 --> 00:43:06,971
Wait for me!

375
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:08,800
Khun Lek

376
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:12,240
Khun Lek! Bang!

377
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:12,760
Oh!

378
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:13,280
Missed me!

379
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,120
It tore!

380
00:43:20,120 --> 00:43:24,080
Um, have you heard the story
that Aunt Prik disappeared from the house?

381
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,199
I heard.

382
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:29,600
I heard Lumyai said that Khun
Ying Kaekai was very angry.

383
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:30,471
Really?

384
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,600
She ordered to search the whole house.

385
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:36,680
I think this time Aunt Prik will definitely
get beaten until her back is split open.

386
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:37,440
Just wait and see.

387
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:48,280
Khun Lek stay with Khun Yai for a moment.

388
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,880
What are you doing here?

389
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,240
Why are you folding holy things like this?

390
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,480
Look at the lotus flowers you chose!

391
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:05,013
They are both withered and bruised.

392
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:06,000
Khun Ying.

393
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,560
Here's another person, what's wrong now?

394
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:16,600
I heard that you are
looking for Aunt Prik, right?

395
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:21,800
Well, Aunt Prik went out last night.

396
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:24,112
It was very sudden, ma'am.

397
00:44:24,586 --> 00:44:27,386
Her younger sister came to inform her
that her mother is about to pass away.

398
00:44:33,182 --> 00:44:34,713
So you just believed them?

399
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,640
Yes, I was there.

400
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:38,496
I can confirm.

401
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,584
You still don't know, right?
I scolded her the other day.

402
00:44:45,840 --> 00:44:48,411
I might have been so sad that she ran away.

403
00:44:51,640 --> 00:44:53,451
But thank you for telling me.

404
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,664
Even if she comes back or not.

405
00:44:57,800 --> 00:45:01,868
But did you know that you
might also be punished?

406
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,221
Puk.

407
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:13,960
Prik.

408
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:15,210
What about mom?

409
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,480
How did you get here and who is Mom with?

410
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:20,960
She told me to come here.

411
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:23,360
She's staying at the
home of an acquaintance.

412
00:45:25,360 --> 00:45:26,720
Mom is about to pass away.

413
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,903
She wants to see your face one last time.

414
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,520
Prik, please come see mom and us.

415
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,000
It's already dark.

416
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:43,080
At this time, none of
the servants can leave.

417
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:47,308
I don't get paid a salary
if I don't serve my master.

418
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:50,480
How can I go?

419
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:51,190
You know that very well.

420
00:45:53,520 --> 00:45:55,400
I already told mom

421
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:58,200
She...

422
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:07,625
Go tell her

423
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:14,125
that in this life, our time
together has run its fated course.

424
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,080
If I was to be born as her child again,

425
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,434
I will make it up to her.

426
00:46:24,280 --> 00:46:27,091
Aunt Prik, please go see your mother.

427
00:46:29,880 --> 00:46:30,600
But I..

428
00:46:30,600 --> 00:46:31,230
Please go.

429
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:34,138
I'll inform Khun Ying.

430
00:46:35,400 --> 00:46:36,802
Please go see your mother.

431
00:46:37,880 --> 00:46:40,558
I think she really wants to see you.

432
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:41,210
I understand..

433
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:45,560
Thank you so much Jom.

434
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,560
Thank you so much.

435
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:51,200
Slowly..

436
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:40,600
Khun Yai.

437
00:47:42,880 --> 00:47:43,967
What is the matter?

438
00:47:44,600 --> 00:47:46,080
Can you help Aunt Prik?

439
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:49,967
Why? What happened to her?

440
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:54,680
She going to be punished by your parents.

441
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:56,373
I had no idea.

442
00:47:57,320 --> 00:47:59,800
All I know of is that she
disappeared from the house.

443
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:02,960
She's gone to see her dying mother.

444
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,520
Why won't anyone understand?

445
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,195
Even Khun Ying.

446
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,872
Aunt Prik is like a second
mother to her children.

447
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:14,517
Jom...

448
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,400
The future of our country
is changing Khun Yai,

449
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:20,500
why are you letting these
kind of things happen in your own home?

450
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,080
I understand you

451
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,240
but sometimes when things
have been this way for so long,

452
00:48:32,920 --> 00:48:34,984
it's difficult to change in a few days.

453
00:48:35,740 --> 00:48:37,691
But if nobody speaks up

454
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,753
will change ever happen?

455
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:48,750
Jom.

456
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:49,800
Jom.

457
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,246
Listen to me.

458
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:18,761
I've spoken to Khun Luang.

459
00:49:19,120 --> 00:49:21,901
Prik, your punishment is

460
00:49:22,920 --> 00:49:27,107
you must be whipped and
detained for one month.

461
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:34,326
Please have mercy on me.

462
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:39,693
You can punish me by
whipping or confinement.

463
00:49:42,733 --> 00:49:45,613
But please allow me to go back
and take care of my mother's corpse first.

464
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:46,701
Please, Khunying.

465
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:51,571
Father, mother.

466
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:56,786
I would like to ask you to
reconsider Prik's punishment one more time.

467
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,657
I know she may have done something wrong.

468
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:08,216
But listen to the story she told,

469
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:12,015
don't you feel any sympathy for her?

470
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:13,631
You're still a kid

471
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:16,640
that uses feelings to judge governance

472
00:50:17,800 --> 00:50:21,640
If we let Park go, everyone
who knows will see it

473
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,643
and follow in her step, then
what will become of our home?

474
00:50:26,800 --> 00:50:29,560
I understand father.

475
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,766
But I don't think we need to punish her

476
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,569
like those old traditions.

477
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:38,678
You know very well

478
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:40,857
that these are out of date.

479
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:01,080
This is your first time offence,

480
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,401
I will refrain from whipping you

481
00:51:05,320 --> 00:51:06,880
but your punishment

482
00:51:07,680 --> 00:51:10,880
is eating the left overs in
the kitchen for two weeks

483
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:14,000
go and take care of your mother's funeral.

484
00:51:16,600 --> 00:51:19,400
Thank you so much for your kindness.

485
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:20,200
Thank you.

486
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:32,080
As for Jom, as an accomplice

487
00:51:32,320 --> 00:51:33,640
must be punished as well.

488
00:51:35,720 --> 00:51:39,520
The rules must be rules and I
have been very merciful about them.

489
00:51:39,800 --> 00:51:41,520
If this was another ruler of the north,

490
00:51:41,560 --> 00:51:43,240
you both would have faced
much crueler punishments.

491
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:41,720
Jom.

492
00:52:46,200 --> 00:52:47,343
I am sorry

493
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:50,280
I could only help so much.

494
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:27,308
You don't have to apologize.

495
00:53:29,160 --> 00:53:30,120
I understand

496
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,320
Just like you once said.

497
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:43,021
This matter is too deep-rooted to be
resolved in this short period of time.

498
00:53:53,720 --> 00:53:55,307
Please wait for me Jom.

499
00:53:57,480 --> 00:54:00,393
Someday I will be the head of this house
and take care of everything.

500
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:02,342
I promise.

501
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:07,212
I will make this better.

502
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:52,739
They are being punished.

503
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:55,880
Look.

504
00:54:58,751 --> 00:55:01,680
Jom is being punished by Khun Luang.

505
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,000
Serves him right.

506
00:55:04,600 --> 00:55:07,600
Lumyai, why don't you
shut up for once in a while?

507
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:08,720
You're always barking away like a dog.

508
00:55:09,120 --> 00:55:10,768
Why? I want to say it?

509
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,320
Just eat.

510
00:55:12,320 --> 00:55:13,360
Why don't you just eat?

511
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:14,400
Damn you and your mouth.

512
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:15,207
Why?

513
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:23,986
Jom.

514
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,000
I'm sorry for dragging you into this.

515
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:31,932
It's ok.

516
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,866
To be honest, I didn't
think this would happen either,

517
00:55:40,073 --> 00:55:42,320
that the two of
us will still be punished.

518
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:45,520
I thought

519
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:49,671
if I told the masters the truth.

520
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,939
I thought they would understand.

521
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:56,508
But...

522
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,320
Auntie, don't think too much.

523
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:11,350
I'm not angry.

524
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:18,827
If we should ever be angry,

525
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:23,240
we should be angry at
what made us like this.

526
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,257
The life of a servants
like us is like this.

527
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:37,240
We are not the owners of our own lives.

528
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:44,500
That's...

529
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:28,280
Wait!

530
00:59:30,800 --> 00:59:31,564
Hey! Wait!

531
00:59:33,520 --> 00:59:34,175
Wait!

532
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:37,084
Jom!

533
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:40,112
Who are you calling out to?

534
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:45,240
Uh...

535
00:59:50,600 --> 00:59:53,120
No one.

536
00:59:55,600 --> 00:59:56,577
It's a good thing you're here.

537
00:59:58,280 --> 00:59:59,640
There's an event today.

538
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:02,474
I want you to join me.

539
01:00:05,134 --> 01:00:06,086
Event?

540
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:08,964
A Christmas event.

541
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,000
Christmas..

542
01:00:14,800 --> 01:00:16,609
Sure! I want to go.

543
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,320
Then get ready for tonight.

544
01:00:25,480 --> 01:00:31,680
Uh, do you remember the shirt I bought you?

545
01:00:33,560 --> 01:00:35,450
Uh.. I do.

546
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:37,800
If it's not too much.

547
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:42,214
Please wear that shirt.

548
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:47,441
Of course.

549
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,600
It's just a normal drawing.

550
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,409
I thought it was going to
be something more valuble.

551
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:25,819
It might be valuble to the owner.

552
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,433
If not, they wouldn't
keep it in this chest.

553
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,240
Look at the drawings,

554
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:33,480
it's not an old style of drawing.

555
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,445

They call it the Puttyuban Bar.

556
01:01:42,445 --> 01:01:43,863
Is this your favorite place?

557
01:01:43,863 --> 01:01:44,440
Yes.

558
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,240
Can I sit with you?

559
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,200
This is James.

560
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:49,023
I like you.

561
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:51,440
You're up really early today.

562
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:52,524
I'm a loner,

563
01:01:52,524 --> 01:01:54,600
that's why I can manage my life.

564
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:57,743
Are you angry at me?

565
01:01:57,743 --> 01:02:01,418
Did my actions not reach your heart at all?

566
01:02:01,418 --> 01:02:03,113
Or should I write you a long poem?

567
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:05,456
So that you can understand
how I feel about you.

568
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:07,400
