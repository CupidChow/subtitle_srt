1
00:00:00,001 --> 00:00:01,160
(Previously)
I'm getting married.

2
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:02,559
You don't love me anymore?

3
00:00:02,559 --> 00:00:05,815
I hope you meet someone better than me.

4
00:00:10,693 --> 00:00:13,902
I prayed for life after my death,

5
00:00:13,902 --> 00:00:16,571
to be a better journey.

6
00:00:16,571 --> 00:00:19,350
What year are we in?

7
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:22,967
Then what kind do you want
me to tell you, B.E. or R.E.?

8
00:00:22,967 --> 00:00:29,824
I dreamt of me with a man I've
never seen and never known.

9
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:00,828
Well, are you awake, Khun Yai?

10
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:05,990
I'll go get everything ready.

11
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:09,007
Jom.

12
00:01:10,444 --> 00:01:12,339
The sun hasn't risen yet.

13
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:15,821
Just a little bit more sleep.

14
00:02:09,692 --> 00:02:11,219
Jom...

15
00:02:11,867 --> 00:02:13,394
What's going on?

16
00:02:26,988 --> 00:02:28,305
Jom!!

17
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:42,684
Jasmine-infused water, Khun Yai.

18
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:44,367
Thank you so much, Prik.

19
00:03:48,517 --> 00:03:51,831
It's been so long since I've
seen you make garlands.

20
00:03:53,453 --> 00:03:57,608
So why are you doing one?
Is there something on your mind?

21
00:03:59,404 --> 00:04:00,458
Not really.

22
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:04,596
I just had some strange dreams.

23
00:04:04,859 --> 00:04:09,476
So I want to do something
to get myself together.

24
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:14,240
The ancients said that a
dream predicts the future.

25
00:04:15,186 --> 00:04:16,976
What was your dream?

26
00:04:17,621 --> 00:04:19,463
You can tell me.

27
00:04:27,023 --> 00:04:28,077
Prik,

28
00:04:29,057 --> 00:04:31,320
have you ever kept on
dreaming of someone...

29
00:04:32,028 --> 00:04:34,554
you have never known?

30
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:41,075
I've dreamt of a man...

31
00:04:42,329 --> 00:04:43,856
spending time with me.

32
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:49,148
We seemed to be so intimate,

33
00:04:49,148 --> 00:04:51,543
that I feel strange myself,

34
00:04:53,322 --> 00:04:55,690
as if we'd been intimate for so long.

35
00:04:57,085 --> 00:04:59,085
Well...

36
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:06,035
Am I the only person
you've told about this dream?

37
00:05:09,104 --> 00:05:11,104
Good, then.

38
00:05:11,549 --> 00:05:13,549
If it reaches your father's ear,

39
00:05:13,549 --> 00:05:15,631
it will be such chaos.

40
00:05:17,989 --> 00:05:22,617
That dream might not be the
prediction of the future as I said.

41
00:05:23,276 --> 00:05:26,170
It might be just the
reflection of your frustration.

42
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:28,638
Don't overthink it, Khun Yai.

43
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:34,653
Thanks, Prik.

44
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:38,370
So will you excuse me?

45
00:06:30,455 --> 00:06:31,877
Hey!!

46
00:06:31,877 --> 00:06:33,425
Ming!! Calm down!

47
00:06:33,425 --> 00:06:34,097
Calm down, Ming!!

48
00:06:34,097 --> 00:06:34,597
Hey!!

49
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:02,600
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 2)

50
00:08:28,337 --> 00:08:29,023
Are you...

51
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,040
all right?

52
00:08:35,158 --> 00:08:38,840
What happened, Khun Yai?

53
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:41,935
Prik, please go get some fabric for this man.

54
00:08:42,998 --> 00:08:43,720
Sure.

55
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:48,040
Do you live around here?

56
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,360
Jom!! Jom!!

57
00:08:53,988 --> 00:08:56,120
Well, excuse me, Khun Yai.

58
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,509
Jom!! Jom!!

59
00:09:09,787 --> 00:09:11,051
Oh! Who's that?

60
00:09:11,361 --> 00:09:12,257
Jom!!

61
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:15,596
Jom!! Jom!!

62
00:09:16,781 --> 00:09:18,560
What's wrong with you?

63
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,958
Why are you being so ill-mannered?

64
00:09:21,827 --> 00:09:22,355
You don't...

65
00:09:22,355 --> 00:09:23,806
Follow me.

66
00:09:24,345 --> 00:09:26,345
Where are you taking me? I'm going home.

67
00:09:28,352 --> 00:09:30,352
Have you remembered your home now?

68
00:09:35,122 --> 00:09:36,281
Somehow,

69
00:09:36,281 --> 00:09:38,631
you have to thank him first.

70
00:09:38,631 --> 00:09:40,190
Khun Yai has rescued you.

71
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,306
Khun Yai?

72
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:45,126
Yeah.

73
00:09:48,758 --> 00:09:50,000
Who's he, Ming?

74
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,469
Jom...

75
00:09:52,111 --> 00:09:56,319
He is the son of Luang
Nititham and Khun Ying Kaekai,

76
00:09:56,319 --> 00:09:57,760
the owners of the House of Palathip.

77
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:00,584
The House of Palathip?

78
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:03,829
Yeah, this one.

79
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,598
Impossible.

80
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,449
No.

81
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,420
What are you saying that is impossible?

82
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:27,680
Khun Yai.

83
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:32,317
Jom, bend down your head!

84
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:35,166
Ming,

85
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:37,800
Stand straight.

86
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,557
You know I don't mind, don't you?

87
00:10:40,928 --> 00:10:42,928
You don't have to be that submissive to me.

88
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:47,880
Well, that's what I've got from that house.

89
00:10:51,904 --> 00:10:54,377
Hey! Say "Thank you" to Khun Yai now, Jom!

90
00:10:55,557 --> 00:10:57,031
Quickly.

91
00:10:58,072 --> 00:11:01,229
Well, thank you so much
for rescuing me, Khun Yai.

92
00:11:05,057 --> 00:11:06,689
You don't live around here, right?

93
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:11,734
Khun Yai, this is Jom.

94
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,600
He was lost. He seems even frantic,
not knowing his background.

95
00:11:17,932 --> 00:11:21,193
So I've taken him to Khun Luang,

96
00:11:21,666 --> 00:11:23,666
in case he could help
him at least a little.

97
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:31,433
Get him to change first, Ming.

98
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,488
It's not quite right that he
goes around with this outfit.

99
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:38,749
Then, take him to the main house.

100
00:11:39,255 --> 00:11:42,412
Father is not there today, but I'll...

101
00:11:43,027 --> 00:11:44,760
talk it over with Mother.

102
00:11:46,456 --> 00:11:48,824
Thank you for your mercy, Khun Yai.

103
00:11:51,737 --> 00:11:55,945
What are you waiting, Jom? Thank him now!

104
00:11:57,169 --> 00:11:58,748
Thank you so much, Khun Yai.

105
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:30,920
Why are you grabbing my mom's fabric?

106
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:32,541
You want to wear it?

107
00:12:33,407 --> 00:12:36,600
Well... I don't know which is which.

108
00:12:37,722 --> 00:12:39,722
Let me get it for you.

109
00:12:39,722 --> 00:12:43,508
I don't want to share my bed with
a lunatic dressing like a woman.

110
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,168
Here.

111
00:12:49,754 --> 00:12:51,807
Go change now. Hurry up.

112
00:13:00,498 --> 00:13:03,080
What's wrong with you?
Why don't you change now?

113
00:13:04,797 --> 00:13:06,639
When I'm doing that,

114
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:09,520
could you wait outside?

115
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,880
Why do you want me to do so?

116
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:13,912
Well...

117
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:16,600
I'm pretty shy.

118
00:13:22,836 --> 00:13:23,830
Seriously?

119
00:13:28,011 --> 00:13:28,697
Sigh!

120
00:13:30,382 --> 00:13:31,961
Hurry up, then.

121
00:13:31,961 --> 00:13:33,249
I'll wait outside.

122
00:13:34,878 --> 00:13:36,510
Quick! It's cold!

123
00:13:37,326 --> 00:13:38,590
Thank you, Ming.

124
00:13:40,204 --> 00:13:41,731
What's wrong with him?

125
00:15:13,331 --> 00:15:15,800
What are you doing, Jom? Sit!

126
00:15:21,516 --> 00:15:23,516
Khun Ying Kaekai is
coming downstairs, Khun Yai.

127
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:37,552
What brings you to this house today, son?

128
00:15:38,294 --> 00:15:41,280
Do I need a reason to come here these days?

129
00:15:42,369 --> 00:15:45,894
Well, I was kidding.

130
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:51,800
I'm quite surprised, though. You
just lock yourself in your little house.

131
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:55,904
Well, Mother.

132
00:15:55,904 --> 00:15:56,434
What?

133
00:15:56,796 --> 00:16:00,215
I've made you a flower garland.

134
00:16:05,721 --> 00:16:08,667
Beautiful as always. That's my son.

135
00:16:10,811 --> 00:16:14,320
But have you got something on
your mind that made you do so?

136
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,986
Something previously bothered me a little.

137
00:16:22,037 --> 00:16:25,141
But it's better now.

138
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:28,411
That's good, then.

139
00:16:29,001 --> 00:16:29,739
Mother.

140
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:33,195
This is the man you asked
me to put into my care, right?

141
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:35,859
How did you know, Mother?

142
00:16:36,377 --> 00:16:41,600
Our walls have ears, son.

143
00:16:55,426 --> 00:17:02,946
So who are you? What's your name?
Where are you from?

144
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:10,000
He is Jom, Khun Ying. He fell into
the water and has lost his memory.

145
00:17:11,510 --> 00:17:13,510
And how come you showed up at my house?

146
00:17:13,675 --> 00:17:16,621
He jutted out from the
riverside out of nowhere.

147
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,881
He even vomited on me, and he...

148
00:17:18,881 --> 00:17:21,004
So he's deaf as well, right?

149
00:17:21,722 --> 00:17:23,722
He doesn't even answer my questions.

150
00:17:31,619 --> 00:17:32,681
Well...

151
00:17:32,681 --> 00:17:38,361
So how can I trust someone,
who can't even remember his own name?

152
00:17:38,361 --> 00:17:39,152
How?

153
00:17:42,487 --> 00:17:43,383
What now?

154
00:17:44,738 --> 00:17:46,120
Can you remember anything at least?

155
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:51,160
I...

156
00:17:52,566 --> 00:17:54,566
My name... is Jom.

157
00:17:55,483 --> 00:17:56,694
And...

158
00:18:00,575 --> 00:18:01,786
That's all I can remember.

159
00:18:05,637 --> 00:18:06,691
Yai,

160
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:10,880
I think we should
send him to the police.

161
00:18:12,031 --> 00:18:15,720
He doesn't look native here.

162
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,253
I don't want to bring such a
suspicious threat into our house.

163
00:18:19,253 --> 00:18:22,462
Please don't send me to the police.
I'm not a criminal.

164
00:18:22,462 --> 00:18:25,175
And I have no ill
intentions towards anyone.

165
00:18:26,357 --> 00:18:28,357
Please let me stay here for a while.

166
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:32,917
Whenever I find out who I am actually, I
will leave this place as soon as possible.

167
00:18:35,001 --> 00:18:35,687
Yai,

168
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,349
what do you think?

169
00:18:43,257 --> 00:18:44,206
I think...

170
00:18:45,451 --> 00:18:47,451
we should let him stay here first, Mother.

171
00:18:48,483 --> 00:18:52,113
Meanwhile, we can entrust
him with some errands.

172
00:18:54,123 --> 00:18:55,280
Are you sure?

173
00:18:56,174 --> 00:19:00,802
He can't even tell us who
he is and where he's from.

174
00:19:02,315 --> 00:19:03,158
Jom,

175
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:06,835
can you do some errands?

176
00:19:08,961 --> 00:19:10,000
Yes, I can.

177
00:19:10,723 --> 00:19:13,880
Can you do some labor tasks as well?

178
00:19:15,098 --> 00:19:15,889
Of course.

179
00:19:15,889 --> 00:19:17,612
Don't worry, Khun Yai.

180
00:19:17,612 --> 00:19:19,642
I'll keep my eyes on him.

181
00:19:20,892 --> 00:19:22,480
But you know, right?

182
00:19:22,933 --> 00:19:24,933
If anything wrong happens
and affects your father,

183
00:19:25,373 --> 00:19:27,373
you must be responsible for your man.

184
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:31,840
Can you take that?

185
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:34,600
Yes, I can.

186
00:19:40,156 --> 00:19:41,735
So, suit yourself.

187
00:19:45,387 --> 00:19:47,387
Go teach him how to work,

188
00:19:47,387 --> 00:19:48,793
and let him start tomorrow.

189
00:19:49,400 --> 00:19:52,520
Thank you so much, Khun Ying.
Thank you so much, Khun Yai.

190
00:19:58,834 --> 00:20:01,044
Maen,

191
00:20:02,253 --> 00:20:03,832
I have something to tell you...

192
00:20:04,322 --> 00:20:08,214
Mae Nai Eeang Peung told
me that she wouldn't have dinner.

193
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:09,227
Really?

194
00:20:09,227 --> 00:20:10,717
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

195
00:20:11,182 --> 00:20:15,022
She didn't like the
lunch you made, I guess.

196
00:20:15,261 --> 00:20:19,416
So she was like, "The food is so
bad. I don't want to eat it any longer."

197
00:20:19,824 --> 00:20:23,401
Meh! Look at you!

198
00:20:23,401 --> 00:20:24,318
Yeah.

199
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,400
Watch your bloody mouth, Khamtip!

200
00:20:27,241 --> 00:20:28,032
Hey!!

201
00:20:28,032 --> 00:20:30,371
What's with the screaming and shouting?!

202
00:20:30,371 --> 00:20:33,872
Khamtip insulted me!

203
00:20:36,211 --> 00:20:38,001
It was true, wasn't it?

204
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:40,000
You two fight literally every day.

205
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:43,880
Eh? Why are you still here, Jom?

206
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,333
Didn't Ming take you to Kad Luang already?

207
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:48,306
Huh?

208
00:20:49,544 --> 00:20:52,806
He is going to be a new gardener.

209
00:20:53,013 --> 00:20:54,120
He will assist Grandpa Suya.

210
00:20:54,950 --> 00:20:55,531
What?!

211
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,360
Who's gonna take my place?

212
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:00,258
Listen carefully.

213
00:21:00,258 --> 00:21:02,735
He will assist you.

214
00:21:03,307 --> 00:21:05,600
He will be just a temporary gardener.

215
00:21:06,761 --> 00:21:10,360
But he speaks Thai,
so try to understand him.

216
00:21:10,684 --> 00:21:12,053
That scared me!

217
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,012
I haven't got the money, So how
could they kick me out of the house?

218
00:21:18,539 --> 00:21:21,485
So how can we trust him?
We don't even know him.

219
00:21:21,485 --> 00:21:23,001
He's going to work with my dad.

220
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:28,628
Whatever the masters do, they never
ask for any opinions from servants like us.

221
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,965
Nobody has such an ill
thought like you, Lamyai.

222
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,063
Hey, Aunt!

223
00:21:36,063 --> 00:21:38,743
Is it wrong that I worry about my dad?

224
00:21:40,252 --> 00:21:43,671
Enough, enough, enough! Shut up, Lamyai!

225
00:22:03,182 --> 00:22:03,868
Jom,

226
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:06,538
what's wrong with you? Why don't you eat?

227
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:10,000
Or are you too snobbish to eat with us?

228
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,994
Not at all, Ming.

229
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:16,920
I just wonder what these are.

230
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:21,478
Let me tell you. This is rotten meat.

231
00:22:21,879 --> 00:22:22,722
What?!

232
00:22:22,932 --> 00:22:27,259
And this is nam prik num.
This is a spicy frog salad.

233
00:22:27,527 --> 00:22:28,423
What?!

234
00:22:28,423 --> 00:22:32,135
The last one is my favorite,
steamed curry made from a pig's brain.

235
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:33,758
What?!

236
00:22:36,983 --> 00:22:39,720
Try it first. It's very good.

237
00:22:41,653 --> 00:22:43,080
A pig's brain?!

238
00:22:43,080 --> 00:22:43,912
Yeah.

239
00:22:43,912 --> 00:22:44,913
Try.

240
00:22:44,913 --> 00:22:45,801
No... No, thanks.

241
00:22:45,801 --> 00:22:46,896
Try it first, Jom.

242
00:22:46,896 --> 00:22:47,850
I've never tried it before.

243
00:22:49,755 --> 00:22:52,333
Come on, get a load.

244
00:22:55,466 --> 00:22:57,840
What's wrong? It's bad, huh?

245
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:01,726
It's just... It's just new to me.

246
00:23:03,607 --> 00:23:07,520
Try this one, rotten meat.

247
00:23:10,562 --> 00:23:12,562
Eat it, so you can work.

248
00:23:14,074 --> 00:23:15,455
One more thing.

249
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,819
Not this one! I don't eat frogs!

250
00:23:19,479 --> 00:23:20,690
Huh?

251
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,068
Here. Eat.

252
00:23:26,387 --> 00:23:28,720
Your food is so strange.

253
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,582
But it tastes good, doesn't it?

254
00:23:34,038 --> 00:23:35,512
Khun Eeang Peung.

255
00:23:36,043 --> 00:23:40,000
Khun Eeang Peung, we
have been walking for so long.

256
00:23:40,518 --> 00:23:43,412
I think we should go home now.

257
00:23:43,837 --> 00:23:47,414
You might get sick from the dew.

258
00:23:51,395 --> 00:23:53,605
Let me walk a little bit more, Maey.

259
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:56,120
Khun Eeang Peung...

260
00:23:56,313 --> 00:23:57,998
Don't worry.

261
00:23:58,505 --> 00:24:00,768
I want to smell the fresh air.

262
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:08,629
You know how suffocating
it is to stay indoors.

263
00:24:11,517 --> 00:24:12,255
Yes.

264
00:24:23,607 --> 00:24:26,389
Maey, that servant works for which house?

265
00:24:27,413 --> 00:24:29,280
I don't know either.

266
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,393
There are so many mosquitoes here!

267
00:24:46,316 --> 00:24:48,316
Ming said he'd found me at this spot.

268
00:24:56,389 --> 00:24:57,653
Hey!

269
00:25:41,305 --> 00:25:42,306
Maey!

270
00:25:42,333 --> 00:25:45,296
Go find someone to look for him right now!

271
00:25:46,097 --> 00:25:47,519
Yes, Khun Eeang Peung!

272
00:26:01,547 --> 00:26:03,920
Help! Somebody help!

273
00:26:05,695 --> 00:26:07,274
Is anyone here?!

274
00:26:12,728 --> 00:26:14,728
What are you doing down there?!

275
00:26:15,698 --> 00:26:16,360
Jeed!

276
00:26:20,001 --> 00:26:20,687
Jeed!

277
00:26:22,336 --> 00:26:23,705
It's you, Jeed! Jeed!

278
00:26:23,948 --> 00:26:24,448
Jeed!

279
00:26:24,448 --> 00:26:25,669
What are you talking about?

280
00:26:27,134 --> 00:26:28,871
What's wrong with you, Jeed?!

281
00:26:28,871 --> 00:26:30,319
Do you know what I've been through?

282
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,279
Let go of me!

283
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:32,911
Jeed!

284
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:34,213
Jeed!

285
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:38,670
What's wrong with you, Jeed?!

286
00:26:38,953 --> 00:26:40,000
It's me!

287
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,962
Help!

288
00:26:40,962 --> 00:26:43,234
What are you doing,
Jeed?! This is not funny!

289
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:44,375
Help!

290
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,455
What's wrong, Jeed?!

291
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:46,979
Ouch!

292
00:26:46,979 --> 00:26:47,787
Hey! Hey! Hey!

293
00:26:48,895 --> 00:26:49,634
What's wrong with you?

294
00:26:49,634 --> 00:26:51,789
Why are you messing with my little sister?

295
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:52,438
Jom!

296
00:26:52,438 --> 00:26:54,163
Jom! What the hell is wrong with you?

297
00:26:54,163 --> 00:26:55,658
He kicked me, Ming!

298
00:26:55,658 --> 00:26:56,421
He's messing with my sister!

299
00:26:56,421 --> 00:26:58,917
Who is this jerk?! How
dare he touch my wife?!

300
00:27:01,701 --> 00:27:06,487
He is my friend. He has fallen into
the water twice, he's pretty crazy.

301
00:27:06,512 --> 00:27:11,165
He's getting close to being mad.
Please don't mind him, Master.

302
00:27:11,586 --> 00:27:13,807
Please have mercy on him.

303
00:27:15,514 --> 00:27:17,514
Bow your head, Jom!

304
00:27:18,284 --> 00:27:24,489
If you still want a place to sleep,
apologize to them now!

305
00:27:25,401 --> 00:27:26,000
Jom!

306
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,018
If your friend can't keep
his damn mouth shut,

307
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:33,261
you and your mom will be punished
for letting this bastard in my house!

308
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:35,905
And you, get the hell out of my house!

309
00:27:35,905 --> 00:27:36,605
Get out!!

310
00:27:37,937 --> 00:27:39,464
I'm afraid you can't do it.

311
00:27:39,677 --> 00:27:40,363
Yai.

312
00:27:42,608 --> 00:27:45,765
Jom is a new servant
of the House of Palathip.

313
00:27:46,377 --> 00:27:48,195
The only person who can make him leave,

314
00:27:48,749 --> 00:27:50,328
is me and only me.

315
00:27:51,239 --> 00:27:54,000
Your servant was messing with my wife.

316
00:27:56,432 --> 00:27:58,240
But nothing bad really happened to me, Yai.

317
00:27:58,949 --> 00:28:00,949
I think it was just a misunderstanding.

318
00:28:09,043 --> 00:28:10,102
I...

319
00:28:11,251 --> 00:28:13,882
I'm sorry, Khun Ying.

320
00:28:15,721 --> 00:28:17,160
How about me?!

321
00:28:19,772 --> 00:28:24,348
He has apologized to me!
Why are you still making a fuss?

322
00:28:26,976 --> 00:28:29,607
Let's go home, Maey.

323
00:28:30,262 --> 00:28:31,000
Yes.

324
00:28:38,835 --> 00:28:40,835
Take care of him, Yai.

325
00:29:00,561 --> 00:29:05,760
Ming! Ming! Ming! Wait!

326
00:29:08,846 --> 00:29:11,635
What the hell is wrong with you, Jom?

327
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:14,042
I'm so tired of helping you
with every trouble you've caused.

328
00:29:14,418 --> 00:29:16,240
Well, I'm just...

329
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:20,451
Without Khun Yai, my mom and I would've
been whipped by the foreign master!

330
00:29:20,451 --> 00:29:21,731
Do you realize?

331
00:29:22,522 --> 00:29:23,920
I'm really sorry. Well...

332
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:28,116
If you still want to be here,
stop getting my mom and me into trouble.

333
00:29:28,116 --> 00:29:33,184
Please, Jom. I've been so sick of this
place even before you showed up here.

334
00:29:34,017 --> 00:29:34,703
Ming!

335
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,149
Ming!

336
00:29:39,755 --> 00:29:40,756
Jom.

337
00:29:43,251 --> 00:29:44,640
Yes, Khun Yai.

338
00:29:44,954 --> 00:29:50,440
As my big sister said,
you didn't have some ill intention, right?

339
00:29:52,631 --> 00:29:54,736
I didn't mean it at all, Khun Yai.

340
00:29:54,736 --> 00:30:00,000
Well... your sister looks so much
like someone I've known.

341
00:30:02,297 --> 00:30:04,297
She's like someone you've known?!

342
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:11,550
If so, now you seem to
remember something, right?

343
00:30:14,251 --> 00:30:19,255
It's merely a flash in my head,
not yet as clear as it should be.

344
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,013
Excuse me.

345
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:35,760
It's so dark I can see nothing.
Khun Eeang Peung! Khun Eeang Peung!

346
00:30:40,061 --> 00:30:42,061
Khun Eeang Peung!

347
00:30:43,037 --> 00:30:45,037
Khun Eeang Peung!

348
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:54,094
Oh! God save my life! Khun Eeang Peung!

349
00:30:54,094 --> 00:30:55,251
Where have you been?

350
00:30:55,251 --> 00:30:56,378
What's wrong, Khamtip?

351
00:30:56,378 --> 00:30:56,886
Eeang Peung!

352
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,000
Why did you help him?

353
00:31:00,681 --> 00:31:01,945
No, I didn't.

354
00:31:02,519 --> 00:31:04,834
I just told them the truth.

355
00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:08,077
So why did you go outside
alone at night like that?

356
00:31:08,994 --> 00:31:12,560
It's not the right thing for a woman to do,
knowing how dangerous it is.

357
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:15,458
Unless it's because...

358
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:16,583
Don't worry, sir.

359
00:31:17,488 --> 00:31:19,488
I'm not the kind of woman.

360
00:31:20,983 --> 00:31:22,089
Anyway...

361
00:31:23,277 --> 00:31:25,277
do you still care about me?

362
00:31:26,841 --> 00:31:32,760
You're about to tie the
knot to your underage wife,

363
00:31:33,135 --> 00:31:35,480
although you already have me as your wife.

364
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,706
But you never got criticized for anything.

365
00:31:39,041 --> 00:31:41,672
They even cherish you.

366
00:31:42,263 --> 00:31:44,263
If a woman does the same,

367
00:31:44,925 --> 00:31:48,280
she will certainly be
punished and insulted.

368
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:51,149
But never mind.

369
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:56,064
You should spend your time
getting the ceremony prepared.

370
00:31:56,576 --> 00:31:59,575
I no longer oppose
nor am against it.

371
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:06,000
Enjoy yourself with your new
wife as much as you like it.

372
00:32:06,315 --> 00:32:06,858
Eeang Peu...

373
00:32:06,858 --> 00:32:07,893
Excuse me.

374
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:08,956
Let's go, Maey.

375
00:32:16,460 --> 00:32:17,280
Khamtip!

376
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,151
What the hell are you looking at?

377
00:32:18,401 --> 00:32:19,350
Get out!

378
00:32:19,350 --> 00:32:20,468
Yes. Yes. Yes.

379
00:34:35,541 --> 00:34:36,122
Jom.

380
00:34:36,582 --> 00:34:37,163
Yes.

381
00:34:37,163 --> 00:34:38,197
Go feed the chickens.

382
00:34:39,122 --> 00:34:40,000
Ahh.

383
00:34:40,154 --> 00:34:41,103
Go feed the chickens.

384
00:34:41,566 --> 00:34:42,297
Yes.

385
00:34:46,505 --> 00:34:47,874
Eat up.

386
00:34:50,735 --> 00:34:54,480
Ugh! Somebody helps me catch the pig!

387
00:34:54,956 --> 00:34:56,799
Come on! Let me help!

388
00:34:56,799 --> 00:34:58,903
Let me do it!

389
00:34:58,954 --> 00:35:00,950
Whose pig is it, Auntie?
How come it showed up here?

390
00:35:00,950 --> 00:35:04,119
Khun Lek's pig. Khun Yai's little brother.

391
00:35:04,577 --> 00:35:05,720
Get it!

392
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:06,428
Here!

393
00:35:08,296 --> 00:35:09,770
Hold it, Auntie Prik!

394
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:10,615
Hey! It's gone!

395
00:35:10,615 --> 00:35:11,900
Hurry up! Prik!

396
00:35:13,031 --> 00:35:17,880
Don't chase it now, Auntie. It'll be
more frightened and keep running away.

397
00:35:47,198 --> 00:35:50,460
Finally! How naughty you are!

398
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,544
Jom,

399
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:54,120
Did you ever work in a pigsty?

400
00:35:56,526 --> 00:35:57,898
No, I didn't.

401
00:35:57,898 --> 00:36:02,321
But I kinda know how to
train a domesticated piglet.

402
00:36:03,262 --> 00:36:05,262
But we're not pig trainers, are we?

403
00:36:06,477 --> 00:36:11,684
Well, I used to help my sister with
the training when we were young.

404
00:36:14,202 --> 00:36:15,520
Can you remember something?

405
00:36:20,782 --> 00:36:27,303
Yeah. It's just come out
of the blue in my head.

406
00:36:27,303 --> 00:36:29,875
It's like the flash from the past, I think.

407
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:31,137
Prik!

408
00:36:34,355 --> 00:36:35,304
Have you caught it?

409
00:36:35,304 --> 00:36:38,933
Yes, sir. Jom found a way to do it.

410
00:36:42,709 --> 00:36:44,026
Is it your piglet, Khun Lek?

411
00:36:47,404 --> 00:36:49,404
You're Jom, right?

412
00:36:51,147 --> 00:36:52,200
Yes, sir.

413
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:57,960
If you can train a piglet,
why don't you help me?

414
00:37:02,309 --> 00:37:05,040
Training your piglet?

415
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:05,764
Yeah.

416
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:25,299
What's going on here? In a period
series, when they travel back in time,

417
00:37:25,299 --> 00:37:27,982
they're supposed to be
aristocrats, aren't they?

418
00:37:28,007 --> 00:37:30,962
So now why do I
become a piglet's trainer?

419
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:36,480
What are you ranting about?

420
00:37:39,033 --> 00:37:39,815
Nothing.

421
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,802
How crazy you are! Talking to a pig!

422
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:45,710
So today you just take
care of the pig like that.

423
00:37:46,411 --> 00:37:49,410
And tomorrow you'll work in the garden.

424
00:38:02,454 --> 00:38:05,768
I was scolded because of you!

425
00:38:12,768 --> 00:38:14,768
Ugh! Come on!

426
00:38:23,504 --> 00:38:26,040
Have you got a name, by the way?

427
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:29,820
If not, that's fine. I'm
gonna give you one myself.

428
00:38:30,993 --> 00:38:33,057
Hmhhh... What should it be, then?

429
00:38:34,215 --> 00:38:41,080
In my time, you'd be
named "Fatty" or "Piglet."

430
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:44,297
I'm just talking nonsense!

431
00:38:45,665 --> 00:38:48,138
What should it be...?

432
00:38:53,881 --> 00:38:54,840
It should be... Hope!

433
00:38:55,975 --> 00:39:02,000
So you could at least be my
hope when I'm at this place.

434
00:39:03,124 --> 00:39:03,863
Okay?

435
00:39:04,761 --> 00:39:06,340
If so, nod.

436
00:39:49,187 --> 00:39:50,120
Ming.

437
00:39:51,851 --> 00:39:54,850
What do you want me to help with again?

438
00:39:56,878 --> 00:39:59,667
No, I just wanna tell you something.

439
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:03,869
Thank you, Ming.

440
00:40:07,617 --> 00:40:10,600
Fine! Take it as charity.

441
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:26,040
You know, Ming? Today...

442
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,097
Jom! Jom!

443
00:40:28,383 --> 00:40:32,200
Today I had to chase Hope
the Piglet. It was so hard.

444
00:40:32,721 --> 00:40:37,480
And after I caught it, Khun Lek
just told me to help him train it.

445
00:40:37,728 --> 00:40:38,640
So why are you telling me this?

446
00:40:40,914 --> 00:40:42,546
Nothing, Ming.

447
00:40:42,546 --> 00:40:49,613
I just want to tell you what's
going on in my life today.

448
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,878
Khun Lek's just got back from school.

449
00:40:55,878 --> 00:40:58,281
He's not usually here, actually.

450
00:40:58,281 --> 00:41:00,322
He goes to a boys boarding school.

451
00:41:00,322 --> 00:41:03,601
He might be lonely, so he has a piglet as his pet.

452
00:41:05,957 --> 00:41:07,480
How about you, Jom?

453
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:09,054
You still can't remember anything, right?

454
00:41:13,267 --> 00:41:14,689
No, I can't.

455
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:19,960
I'm not trying to kick you out, but if
you have a better place to go, just go.

456
00:41:33,875 --> 00:41:36,075
Jom, where are you going?

457
00:41:36,771 --> 00:41:37,667
Getting home, of course.

458
00:41:38,293 --> 00:41:38,926
Sit down.

459
00:41:40,276 --> 00:41:41,382
I told you to sit down.

460
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:44,486
Why, Ming?

461
00:41:45,098 --> 00:41:46,520
I'll teach you how to paddle.

462
00:41:47,571 --> 00:41:49,150
Untie the rope.

463
00:41:49,150 --> 00:41:50,139
Me?

464
00:41:50,139 --> 00:41:53,045
Yeah, you. Don't make that confused face.

465
00:41:53,045 --> 00:41:56,414
I'm not your slave to
paddle for you every time.

466
00:41:57,337 --> 00:42:00,920
It's easy in such a still river.
Untie the rope. Hurry up.

467
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:01,689
Yeah.

468
00:42:02,725 --> 00:42:03,551
Hurry up, Jom!

469
00:42:03,551 --> 00:42:04,386
Yeah.

470
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:08,467
Ugh! It's hard, isn't it?

471
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:10,842
Get the paddle.

472
00:42:12,582 --> 00:42:13,320
Jom!!

473
00:42:14,266 --> 00:42:14,766
What?!

474
00:42:14,766 --> 00:42:15,325
It's mine!

475
00:42:17,340 --> 00:42:18,341
Ahhh...

476
00:42:19,282 --> 00:42:20,000
Yeah.

477
00:42:23,857 --> 00:42:25,857
Push it out like this. Get it?

478
00:42:26,453 --> 00:42:31,565
Lean yourself forward a little,
and get the paddle into the water.

479
00:42:32,195 --> 00:42:33,216
This side?

480
00:42:36,342 --> 00:42:37,120
It's up to you.

481
00:42:37,869 --> 00:42:38,765
Any side is fine.

482
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:39,673
Row.

483
00:42:40,001 --> 00:42:40,529
Row.

484
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:42,765
Row, and twist your wrist.

485
00:42:42,765 --> 00:42:43,371
Twist.

486
00:42:43,396 --> 00:42:44,347
Row.

487
00:42:44,694 --> 00:42:45,432
Twist.

488
00:42:45,751 --> 00:42:46,440
Row.

489
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:48,336
Jom, Jom, Jom, Jom! Argh! Jom!

490
00:42:48,336 --> 00:42:48,836
Row.

491
00:42:48,836 --> 00:42:52,786
Hey! Hey! Jom! Jom!

492
00:42:56,812 --> 00:42:58,444
Row. Twist. Lift.

493
00:42:58,444 --> 00:42:59,728
Ugh! You don't have to!

494
00:43:00,375 --> 00:43:01,960
Don't go too fast!

495
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:04,463
When I did it slowly,
you said I was weak.

496
00:43:04,487 --> 00:43:06,989
When I did it fast, you
said it was too much!

497
00:43:06,989 --> 00:43:09,192
I'm gonna get you when we get off, Jom.

498
00:43:09,192 --> 00:43:10,440
Argh! It's about to flip over.

499
00:43:27,298 --> 00:43:28,669
Khun Yai.

500
00:43:29,352 --> 00:43:31,352
The ceremony at that
house is about to begin.

501
00:43:32,598 --> 00:43:35,080
Thank you, Prik. I'm going right now.

502
00:43:36,175 --> 00:43:38,175
Why did you decide to join?

503
00:43:39,061 --> 00:43:42,428
It's the blessing ceremony for the
foreign master and his second wife.

504
00:43:45,015 --> 00:43:46,384
I worry about Eeang Peung,
so I want to keep tabs on her.

505
00:43:47,262 --> 00:43:50,997
I want to see if she is all right.

506
00:43:52,192 --> 00:43:52,720
Ok.

507
00:43:53,568 --> 00:43:55,042
So please hurry up, Khun Yai.

508
00:43:56,380 --> 00:43:57,240
Thanks.

509
00:44:23,081 --> 00:44:25,291
Hurry up. The masters are arriving soon.

510
00:44:27,959 --> 00:44:29,749
Get the desserts ready, kid.

511
00:44:35,872 --> 00:44:41,568
Hurry up, or you'll be late
for their auspicious time.

512
00:44:41,831 --> 00:44:44,025
Is everything complete?
Check it before getting it up there.

513
00:44:45,382 --> 00:44:47,382
The time is getting close!
Why do you still make me rush you?!

514
00:44:50,677 --> 00:44:55,160
If we're late, the foreign
master will scold me!

515
00:44:55,269 --> 00:44:59,480
She's the one wanting a blessing and
bringing chaos to the whole household.

516
00:44:59,480 --> 00:45:00,871
Hurry up!

517
00:45:00,871 --> 00:45:04,333
Why are you still complaining?

518
00:45:04,333 --> 00:45:05,942
Come and help!

519
00:45:07,554 --> 00:45:08,976
I did, actually.

520
00:45:09,174 --> 00:45:13,200
I helped those in the kitchen.
I don't want to go into the house.

521
00:45:13,487 --> 00:45:15,487
I don't want to see that
fallen woman... that lady?

522
00:45:17,476 --> 00:45:19,680
That lady?

523
00:45:21,061 --> 00:45:22,200
You just slack off, don't you?

524
00:45:25,094 --> 00:45:25,720
Hey!

525
00:45:26,558 --> 00:45:28,295
Nobody's folding the lotus petals?

526
00:45:28,295 --> 00:45:29,121
Huh?

527
00:45:30,128 --> 00:45:32,128
Nobody's folding the lotus petals?

528
00:45:34,286 --> 00:45:35,182
You do it, then.

529
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,534
Me?

530
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:37,238
Yeah?

531
00:45:44,586 --> 00:45:46,586
How can I help, Ming?

532
00:45:49,369 --> 00:45:53,600
Jom, don't you have to
help Grandpa Suya today?

533
00:45:54,485 --> 00:45:58,220
I'm finished. I see there's a ceremony,
so I asked him to have a look here.

534
00:45:58,737 --> 00:46:00,422
You don't have to help me.

535
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:01,818
These are not your tasks.

536
00:46:01,818 --> 00:46:04,407
They are for the servants
of the foreign master.

537
00:46:04,407 --> 00:46:09,073
If you want to help, he
will order you himself.

538
00:46:09,098 --> 00:46:10,465
Then you can.

539
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:15,360
But I really can help
you. Let me help, please.

540
00:46:20,001 --> 00:46:22,422
Well... Ugh... Yeah...

541
00:46:33,895 --> 00:46:34,720
Robert.

542
00:46:35,789 --> 00:46:37,211
Hey, James.

543
00:46:38,241 --> 00:46:40,241
Learn to come and go as a normal person.

544
00:46:40,241 --> 00:46:43,671
If it's like a normal person,
you know very well that's not me.

545
00:46:45,131 --> 00:46:48,498
I heard that fewer people turned up to
your event than expected.

546
00:46:48,802 --> 00:46:50,600
I didn't invite the others.

547
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:56,520
You know very well that the
proprietors would not come.

548
00:46:57,591 --> 00:47:02,062
And even if they did… they'd
gaze at me with the same look,

549
00:47:02,429 --> 00:47:03,903
because of my second Laos wife.

550
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:10,455
I understand that…

551
00:47:11,664 --> 00:47:12,665
I truly do.

552
00:47:17,248 --> 00:47:20,320
Very well then, I shall take my leave.

553
00:47:20,772 --> 00:47:23,200
What? Where are you
going? You've just arrived.

554
00:47:24,268 --> 00:47:26,268
I have some business
to be done at the forest.

555
00:47:26,268 --> 00:47:29,004
I just wanted to come to
congratulate you in person,

556
00:47:29,633 --> 00:47:31,633
and... say my goodbyes.

557
00:47:32,942 --> 00:47:34,995
Oh, I've said that now.

558
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:36,723
So, I shall leave.

559
00:47:37,445 --> 00:47:38,551
See you later, Robert.

560
00:48:05,571 --> 00:48:06,840
Hey, Yai.

561
00:48:07,991 --> 00:48:09,518
Are you joining?

562
00:48:10,489 --> 00:48:11,227
Yes, I am.

563
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:17,195
I just want to have a visit.

564
00:48:18,508 --> 00:48:19,825
Visit?

565
00:48:29,519 --> 00:48:31,204
To the blessing ceremony?

566
00:48:33,408 --> 00:48:36,039
It's just something Robert
wanted to hold on his own.

567
00:48:37,090 --> 00:48:40,667
Don't worry about me. I'm fine.

568
00:48:41,192 --> 00:48:43,665
Physically and mentally.

569
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:50,000
Are you sure about that?

570
00:48:51,648 --> 00:48:52,859
Yes, I am.

571
00:48:53,168 --> 00:48:55,168
You know why, Yai.

572
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:04,519
If so, it's good, then.

573
00:49:06,031 --> 00:49:07,190
Don't worry.

574
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,960
I think you should worry about that.

575
00:49:26,641 --> 00:49:30,000
If my husband sees
your servant in this house,

576
00:49:30,506 --> 00:49:32,979
the auspicious ceremony
will turn into a funeral.

577
00:49:58,306 --> 00:50:01,520
You get the tray
here and wait outside.

578
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,328
Do not let the foreign
master see you at all.

579
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:06,760
Why not, Ming?

580
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:10,823
Don't you remember that
you were about to punch him?

581
00:50:10,823 --> 00:50:11,351
Ahhh.

582
00:50:12,982 --> 00:50:14,982
If he sees you here,

583
00:50:15,776 --> 00:50:17,513
you'll be kicked out for sure.

584
00:50:21,031 --> 00:50:21,531
Ming.

585
00:50:23,897 --> 00:50:26,580
Yes, Maey.

586
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:32,538
Wow! You look so pretty today!

587
00:50:34,427 --> 00:50:35,270
Really?

588
00:50:36,378 --> 00:50:40,800
You're talking nonsense. I
dress up like this every day.

589
00:50:43,660 --> 00:50:46,659
I'm here to tell you to
get everything ready.

590
00:50:46,883 --> 00:50:52,560
The foreign master and...
They are coming soon.

591
00:50:58,713 --> 00:51:03,880
Woah! This is the first time
I've heard your No.2 voice.

592
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:05,918
No.2 voice?

593
00:51:07,695 --> 00:51:08,840
What does it mean?

594
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,422
What are you talking about? No.2 voice?

595
00:51:15,184 --> 00:51:20,233
Here comes your real
master. I'm leaving you here.

596
00:51:20,889 --> 00:51:22,240
Where are you going, Ming?

597
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:23,081
Jom,

598
00:51:24,554 --> 00:51:25,818
What are you doing in this house?

599
00:51:27,710 --> 00:51:31,587
I just wanted to help
Ming with the preparation.

600
00:51:32,811 --> 00:51:33,760
Let's leave, come with me.

601
00:51:34,678 --> 00:51:37,467
If my brother-in-law sees you here,
you will get into trouble.

602
00:51:52,131 --> 00:51:52,869
Maey.

603
00:51:53,756 --> 00:51:55,020
Have they arrived?

604
00:52:38,705 --> 00:52:39,338
Yai.

605
00:52:40,227 --> 00:52:40,965
Yes.

606
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:43,109
Jom.

607
00:52:44,304 --> 00:52:44,990
Jom!

608
00:52:45,591 --> 00:52:46,329
Yes!

609
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,111
Let's go. I'll obstruct his
view so he won't see you.

610
00:53:13,561 --> 00:53:16,560
Oh, I'm sorry. Are you...

611
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:17,749
It's alright... It's alright.

612
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:22,601
I didn't realize that this place has...

613
00:53:22,601 --> 00:53:28,480
Argh! I'm really really sorry, Mr...

614
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:30,777
James. My name is James.

615
00:53:31,738 --> 00:53:32,687
I'm alright.

616
00:53:33,449 --> 00:53:37,080
I just didn't realize that this place
has a servant who can speak English.

617
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:41,952
Well... I...

618
00:53:42,984 --> 00:53:43,985
What's going on?

619
00:53:45,095 --> 00:53:47,095
Hey, are you coming here, Khun Yai?

620
00:53:48,013 --> 00:53:48,513
Yes.

621
00:53:49,388 --> 00:53:50,442
But...

622
00:53:51,125 --> 00:53:55,240
did my servant bother you or something?

623
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:57,648
Not really.

624
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:03,680
I just find him interesting.

625
00:54:07,801 --> 00:54:12,429
I think that the servants of
a forestry manager like you,

626
00:54:13,323 --> 00:54:16,848
should be more interesting than mine.

627
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:27,476
So will you excuse me?

628
00:54:38,713 --> 00:54:42,290
Well, excuse me, Khun Yai. See you later.

629
00:54:42,290 --> 00:54:43,274
See you later.

630
00:56:02,518 --> 00:56:04,781
Eeang Peung, excuse me.

631
00:56:45,607 --> 00:56:46,661
Jom.

632
00:56:48,776 --> 00:56:49,720
Khun Yai.

633
00:56:51,014 --> 00:56:52,120
What's going on?

634
00:56:54,209 --> 00:56:57,523
Nothing. I'm just...

635
00:56:58,083 --> 00:57:00,924
Every time you see me,

636
00:57:02,501 --> 00:57:05,184
why do you look stiff and
tremble as if seeing a ghost?

637
00:57:05,891 --> 00:57:08,154
Well, it's not like that.

638
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:17,080
Now I just... I just
don't feel good myself.

639
00:57:18,439 --> 00:57:20,200
Do you have a fever?

640
00:57:25,617 --> 00:57:27,091
No, you don't.

641
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:42,200
Have you ever seen this kind
of ceremony in that house?

642
00:57:46,037 --> 00:57:50,320
A few times. They call it
the blessing ceremony, right?

643
00:57:53,398 --> 00:57:57,840
Right. The ancients believed
that blessing was within us.

644
00:57:57,840 --> 00:58:01,800
And when something bad happens and
causes the blessing to get away from us,

645
00:58:01,800 --> 00:58:08,007
it will result in sickness
or misfortune befalling us.

646
00:58:14,579 --> 00:58:16,264
It's like you've lost your blessing.

647
00:58:17,395 --> 00:58:19,395
Please let me bring it back for you.

648
00:58:31,512 --> 00:58:32,520
Give me your hand.

649
00:58:33,985 --> 00:58:36,195
My hand?

650
00:58:39,512 --> 00:58:42,280
Are you sure?

651
00:59:00,244 --> 00:59:06,960
May your blessing come back to you again.

652
01:01:25,954 --> 01:01:26,640
Hey!

653
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,132
Khamsan!

654
01:01:36,831 --> 01:01:37,885
Khamsan!

655
01:01:38,296 --> 01:01:39,192
Fong Kaew!

656
01:01:42,468 --> 01:01:43,206
Fong Kaew!

657
01:01:53,312 --> 01:01:54,240
I missed you so much.

658
01:01:57,041 --> 01:01:58,200
Please talk with me first.

659
01:01:58,491 --> 01:01:59,440
Jom!

660
01:02:00,121 --> 01:02:02,121
2 years, I waited for you.

661
01:02:02,448 --> 01:02:05,237
We made a promise, didn't we?

662
01:02:07,502 --> 01:02:08,345
Ohm!

663
01:02:25,900 --> 01:02:27,140
(Next Episode)
Run away with me, my love.

664
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:31,820
You saw Fong Kaew with
her damn affair on the pier.

665
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:33,180
So I wanted to ask you.

666
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:36,660
But I'm afriad that, if you still
allow Jom to stay in this house,

667
01:02:36,700 --> 01:02:38,260
it might not be really good.

668
01:02:39,620 --> 01:02:41,140
You're the one who told them, right?

669
01:02:41,820 --> 01:02:43,740
If you do anything with
my man one more time,

670
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:44,860
I will never let you get away with it.

671
01:02:46,780 --> 01:02:51,580
May you be safe from
misfortune, even in your dreams.

672
01:02:52,300 --> 01:02:53,500
Good night.
