00:00:00,276 --> 00:00:00,850
(Previously)
Maey!

2
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:02,516
Last night

3
00:00:02,849 --> 00:00:05,080
I saw creeping in the big house.

4
00:00:05,298 --> 00:00:06,363
What are you doing?

5
00:00:06,529 --> 00:00:07,410
This is downstairs!

6
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:08,660
Someone might see us.

7
00:00:08,702 --> 00:00:09,690
No one will see us.

8
00:00:09,792 --> 00:00:10,361
Ahem.

9
00:00:11,454 --> 00:00:13,040
Are you trying to tell me something?

10
00:00:13,419 --> 00:00:16,770
After this, if you must be strict,

11
00:00:16,955 --> 00:00:17,646
then do so.

12
00:00:17,932 --> 00:00:18,826
Because otherwise,

13
00:00:18,849 --> 00:00:20,380
it's the people under your control

14
00:00:20,522 --> 00:00:23,060
that will ruin the honor you've earned.

15
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,926
Can I ask something from you?

16
00:00:25,235 --> 00:00:25,800
What is it?

17
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:29,310
Could you be my dance partner?

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:54,760
It's raining like this.

19
00:00:55,175 --> 00:00:56,905
How is the party going?

20
00:00:59,325 --> 00:01:00,330
Forget it, Jom.

21
00:01:02,005 --> 00:01:05,505
Now there's only two of us in this house.

22
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:09,240
Ugh!

23
00:01:14,515 --> 00:01:15,680
You're soaking wet, Khun Yai.

24
00:01:17,205 --> 00:01:20,480
Why don't you let me undress you?

25
00:01:20,915 --> 00:01:21,555
So you won't catch a cold.

26
00:01:23,885 --> 00:01:24,285
There you go.

27
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,930
Let me do the same for you,

28
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,695
or you'll have a fever.

29
00:04:36,495 --> 00:04:37,560
I love you, Jom.

30
00:04:41,110 --> 00:04:42,480
I love you too, Khun Yai.

31
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:16,600
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 8)

32
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:42,610
Are you awake, Khun Yai?

33
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:47,416
So I'll put away your stuff there.

34
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:53,490
Jom, the sun hasn't yet risen.

35
00:06:55,485 --> 00:06:56,250
Why don't you stay here a little longer?

36
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,330
Jom?

37
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,160
Do you see something?

38
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:10,855
No, I don't, Khun Yai.

39
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:12,970
It's nothing.

40
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:50,465
No matter what,

41
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:55,530
I will always be with you right here.

42
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:28,600
Khun Eeang Peung.

43
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:30,730
Khun Eeang Peung.

44
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,010
Maey.

45
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,760
I had a nightmare.

46
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,860
Oh! It will be all right.

47
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:48,460
It's all right.

48
00:09:48,475 --> 00:09:49,595
It's nothing.

49
00:09:50,805 --> 00:09:52,330
It was such a bad dream.

50
00:09:55,535 --> 00:09:56,975
What was it like?

51
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:09,020
Please make yourself at home.

52
00:10:14,090 --> 00:10:15,760
These vegetables and fruit,

53
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:17,200
you cut them all yourself?

54
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:19,080
No, I didn't.

55
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,215
These cut vegetables and fruit,

56
00:10:22,561 --> 00:10:24,826
my daughter Eeang Peung did it all.

57
00:10:30,626 --> 00:10:31,716
How exquisite!

58
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:48,830
Ah, eat up.

59
00:10:50,705 --> 00:10:51,910
How do you find Robert

60
00:10:52,405 --> 00:10:53,690
after having conversed with him?

61
00:10:55,335 --> 00:10:57,260
He's like what you've said.

62
00:10:57,535 --> 00:10:59,560
Hmh... He looks quite accomplished.

63
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,910
He is humble

64
00:11:02,590 --> 00:11:04,650
and strong at the same time.

65
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,750
Yeah, right.

66
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:12,445
He has climbed up to become
a forest owner at such an age.

67
00:11:13,445 --> 00:11:16,810
Not to mention his power
in business negotiation.

68
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:19,940
He's quite ambitious, isn't he?

69
00:11:21,205 --> 00:11:22,650
By the way,

70
00:11:23,315 --> 00:11:25,650
Robert, as a middleman,
could be of help to you,

71
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,820
who have just moved here,

72
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:32,740
in strengthening your power in
official and commercial affairs.

73
00:11:33,235 --> 00:11:33,725
I think...

74
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:43,550
Mother, I overheard Father
and Uncle Dech talking.

75
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:48,295
It seems like they want me

76
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,670
to tie the knot with Robert.

77
00:11:53,335 --> 00:11:56,780
We don't even know each other so well.

78
00:11:57,680 --> 00:12:00,560
And they are talking about our relationship

79
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,020
and our marriage.

80
00:12:02,902 --> 00:12:04,544
How would that be possible?

81
00:12:06,982 --> 00:12:08,520
I know how you feel, daughter.

82
00:12:09,257 --> 00:12:11,980
But it might not turn
out as badly as you think.

83
00:12:12,685 --> 00:12:13,942
Take your father and me.

84
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,906
Our marriage was also arranged,

85
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,920
but, in the end, I just love him.

86
00:12:22,060 --> 00:12:24,200
But the idea of marraige
is not yet my concern.

87
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,866
Also the idea of moving
out and being a wife.

88
00:12:26,586 --> 00:12:29,299
You know that I want to further my studies.

89
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,820
I want to work in the
government services like Father.

90
00:12:33,866 --> 00:12:35,800
But isn't it too unrealistic?

91
00:12:37,017 --> 00:12:42,910
Women like us have been expected to
take care of households.

92
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:47,120
There's no room for us there.

93
00:12:48,137 --> 00:12:50,280
So how would my life be afterwards, Mother?

94
00:13:01,226 --> 00:13:04,270
What if the marriage came true?

95
00:13:05,457 --> 00:13:06,760
Why don't you consider it

96
00:13:07,355 --> 00:13:10,880
to be for your honor and your family?

97
00:13:11,342 --> 00:13:16,541
Whenever you could no
longer endure your marriage life,

98
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,540
you would always have
some paths to choose from.

99
00:13:21,572 --> 00:13:23,360
Mark my words, Eeang Peung.

100
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:45,120
Are you afraid of me, Eeang Peung?

101
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:50,270
No, I'm not.

102
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:54,267
I... I'm just...

103
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,360
Don't be afraid.

104
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,660
If you still distrust me,

105
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:03,723
it's fine.

106
00:14:04,905 --> 00:14:06,710
I will never to anything to you

107
00:14:06,955 --> 00:14:09,522
until you consent to it.

108
00:14:10,494 --> 00:14:11,360
Don't worry.

109
00:14:18,186 --> 00:14:19,134
Thank you.

110
00:15:40,186 --> 00:15:41,066
Are you awake?

111
00:15:50,281 --> 00:15:52,540
I really can't get rid of
this thought from my head.

112
00:15:56,568 --> 00:15:57,395
It's all right.

113
00:15:59,288 --> 00:16:02,560
Now you have me.

114
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:07,825
I will never let you

115
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,531
suffer all alone,

116
00:16:16,405 --> 00:16:19,840
at least in this house.

117
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:24,857
I will cure your sufferings,

118
00:16:26,685 --> 00:16:27,840
easing them off.

119
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:39,215
I love you so much, Maey.

120
00:16:44,037 --> 00:16:45,392
I live you too, Khun Eeang Peung.

121
00:17:08,255 --> 00:17:09,940
What the hell are you doing?!

122
00:17:13,107 --> 00:17:14,255
Hey! Maey!

123
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:16,450
Maey!

124
00:17:21,242 --> 00:17:23,480
You, get this harlot out from this house!

125
00:17:24,392 --> 00:17:25,070
Now!

126
00:17:26,030 --> 00:17:26,835
Yes! Ouch!

127
00:17:28,985 --> 00:17:29,515
Maey!

128
00:17:30,642 --> 00:17:31,535
Stop! Stop!

129
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:35,276
Khun Eeang Peung, please!

130
00:17:35,993 --> 00:17:36,678
Maey!

131
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:12,926
Jom, come here.

132
00:18:13,372 --> 00:18:14,350
What are you doing, Khun Yai?

133
00:18:14,945 --> 00:18:15,740
Come on.

134
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,810
Trust me.

135
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:25,385
Wow! Did you prepare all these on your own?

136
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:27,460
Yes.

137
00:18:34,710 --> 00:18:36,855
I noticed you were nervous about something,

138
00:18:38,845 --> 00:18:42,650
something I can't percieve.

139
00:18:44,285 --> 00:18:47,405
But what I could and should do

140
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,450
as your lover

141
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:55,880
is... to make you feel more relaxed.

142
00:19:10,005 --> 00:19:10,960
Come on!

143
00:19:12,825 --> 00:19:16,400
Are you sure this is for me,

144
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,140
not yourself?

145
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:23,120
For us, honestly.

146
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,195
Get rid of negative
thoughts from your mind.

147
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,360
Just at this time.

148
00:20:20,710 --> 00:20:21,960
Your skin...

149
00:20:23,945 --> 00:20:24,930
it's very smooth.

150
00:20:28,585 --> 00:20:32,860
Thanks to your olive oil.

151
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,300
I knew it.

152
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,350
Khun Yai,

153
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:58,020
what makes you like plumeria?

154
00:21:05,005 --> 00:21:06,910
Well, why are you asking this?

155
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:15,870
They're quite an unpopular
flower, aren't they?

156
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:19,190
Because the Thai name means misery,

157
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:21,798
which sounds quite inauspicious.

158
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,916
So try smelling it.

159
00:21:42,377 --> 00:21:46,468
Its gentle scent makes me feel liberated,

160
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:52,777
and it's also enchanting.

161
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:59,580
I think, it smells like you, Jom.

May all your ailments be cured.

173
00:23:38,487 --> 00:23:41,421
May all dangers never befall you.

174
00:23:41,475 --> 00:23:44,084
May you be full of happiness
and have a long live.

176
00:23:47,310 --> 00:23:50,676
Age, Skin, Happiness, and Health.

177
00:23:50,713 --> 00:23:53,877
May they all befall
those who habitually pray

178
00:23:54,138 --> 00:23:58,160
and obey the elderly.

179
00:24:00,931 --> 00:24:02,112
I'll put them all away.

180
00:24:02,277 --> 00:24:03,105
Thank you, Prik.

181
00:24:03,449 --> 00:24:04,108
Thank you, Auntie Prik.

182
00:24:19,571 --> 00:24:22,428
What's going on, provost?

183
00:24:23,317 --> 00:24:25,369
Nothing.

184
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:29,440
I just don't think I've seen
this young man before.

185
00:24:30,828 --> 00:24:32,094
This is Jom. He's just
lived here for a while.

186
00:24:32,597 --> 00:24:33,887
You might not have ever seen him.

187
00:24:34,339 --> 00:24:40,420
And I hadn't got up early enough to
offer food to monks for quite a long time.

188
00:24:42,792 --> 00:24:46,252
You were not born and
bred around here, right?

189
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:57,356
Let's go.

190
00:25:08,864 --> 00:25:09,216
Jom.

191
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:10,864
Jom.

192
00:25:12,976 --> 00:25:13,148
Eh?

193
00:25:17,984 --> 00:25:18,684
What's going on?

194
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:21,532
Nothing.

195
00:25:23,748 --> 00:25:26,480
Well, why did you, out of the blue,

196
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:29,812
take me to offer food to the monk with you?

197
00:25:31,652 --> 00:25:35,220
I wanted us to make merit together,

198
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:40,760
so it might elevate our relationship

199
00:25:40,864 --> 00:25:41,508
to the end of our lives.

200
00:25:46,776 --> 00:25:50,540
Moreover, I don't know if you feel it.

201
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:55,608
But I feel such intimacy with you

202
00:25:57,668 --> 00:25:59,008
as if we had met each other

203
00:26:00,956 --> 00:26:02,620
and been together before.

204
00:26:07,924 --> 00:26:13,064
Eh? Do you believe in
reincarnation, Khun Yai?

205
00:26:14,868 --> 00:26:16,276
I had doubted it, actually,

206
00:26:17,892 --> 00:26:20,532
until I met you, Jom.

207
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:24,400
But this hasn't made me

208
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,364
completely believe such a thing.

209
00:26:26,556 --> 00:26:28,560
Because I don't even know how I can tackle

210
00:26:29,604 --> 00:26:30,864
what's going these days.

211
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,400
Yeah.

212
00:26:36,044 --> 00:26:37,088
Let's go home.

213
00:26:43,944 --> 00:26:44,824
Have you got something, Chan?

214
00:26:45,172 --> 00:26:46,300
I have got a little bit, sir.

215
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:50,768
This morning I saw Khun Yai and Jom
offering food to a monk together.

216
00:26:51,136 --> 00:26:53,044
Khun Yai also held Jom's hand.

217
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,084
They were talking in
quite an intimate fashion.

218
00:26:56,124 --> 00:26:57,760
They looked so close to each other, sir.

219
00:26:57,992 --> 00:26:59,320
And...

220
00:26:59,364 --> 00:27:01,480
Stop! I don't want to hear it any longer.

221
00:27:06,616 --> 00:27:08,772
Keep watching over them.

222
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,668
If they ever cross the line,
inform me as soon as possible.

223
00:27:13,572 --> 00:27:13,832
Yes, sir.

224
00:27:21,504 --> 00:27:24,852
I think, if Khun Yai finds it out,

225
00:27:25,392 --> 00:27:26,796
he won't be happy about it for sure.

226
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,416
So don't let it happen.

227
00:27:30,084 --> 00:27:31,560
I'm putting a lot of trust in you, Chan.

228
00:27:31,952 --> 00:27:33,824
Do you remember

229
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:35,800
how I have supported your family?

230
00:27:36,844 --> 00:27:38,208
Don't let me down.

231
00:27:40,916 --> 00:27:41,692
Yes, sir.

232
00:28:08,456 --> 00:28:09,460
Eat.

233
00:28:10,204 --> 00:28:10,612
No!

234
00:28:13,268 --> 00:28:14,560
I will never eat anything

235
00:28:15,408 --> 00:28:17,196
as long as I and Maey
are still under punishment

236
00:28:17,828 --> 00:28:19,412
when we did nothing wrong!

237
00:28:21,208 --> 00:28:22,168
So I will never eat!

238
00:28:27,996 --> 00:28:30,212
How dare you talk to me
like this, Eeang Peung?

239
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,340
You said you did nothing wrong

240
00:28:33,648 --> 00:28:35,268
when you and Maey were having an affair!

241
00:28:35,424 --> 00:28:36,840
I and Maey, we just love each other!

242
00:28:38,148 --> 00:28:40,296
We have loved each
other even before I met you.

243
00:28:41,632 --> 00:28:42,756
So why are we wrong,

244
00:28:43,868 --> 00:28:45,612
when, between us, it's been pure love?

245
00:28:46,068 --> 00:28:47,644
Because now I'm your husband!

246
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:57,360
Why are you so heartless
to me, Eeang Peung?

247
00:28:58,512 --> 00:29:00,496
I have loved you even since I saw you.

248
00:29:01,036 --> 00:29:04,076
I have honored you even
since you became my life.

249
00:29:05,056 --> 00:29:07,300
But you repay me with your cold heart.

250
00:29:07,776 --> 00:29:09,500
You even suggested I have a second wife.

251
00:29:09,796 --> 00:29:12,080
So you could stray with Maey, right?!

252
00:29:12,324 --> 00:29:12,840
Yes!

253
00:29:13,516 --> 00:29:15,684
I'm such an unfaithful
wife, according to you!

254
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:18,100
But has anybody asked me

255
00:29:18,964 --> 00:29:21,460
what I want or don't want to do?

256
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:26,116
It's not me who has betrayed you,

257
00:29:27,804 --> 00:29:29,412
but it's your own thoughts

258
00:29:30,712 --> 00:29:33,300
that have made you think that
I can be someone you want me to!

259
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:34,060
Eeang Peung!

260
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:34,558
Come on!

261
00:29:34,558 --> 00:29:35,142
Do it!

262
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:36,764
Just do it!

263
00:29:37,501 --> 00:29:40,131
If you want to hit me
just like a slave, just do it!

264
00:29:40,704 --> 00:29:43,189
As a woman, I've got no choice, haven't I?

265
00:29:43,509 --> 00:29:46,377
However, it can never change the truth

266
00:29:47,452 --> 00:29:48,840
that I never loved you.

267
00:29:56,368 --> 00:29:58,841
When my love and respect for you

268
00:29:59,497 --> 00:30:01,251
doesn't make you love me at all,

269
00:30:01,478 --> 00:30:03,766
then I won't give them to you any more.

270
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,012
What are you doing, Robert?!

271
00:30:06,294 --> 00:30:06,748
Let go of me!

272
00:30:07,043 --> 00:30:07,718
What are you doing?!

273
00:30:08,096 --> 00:30:08,659
Let go of me!

274
00:30:10,156 --> 00:30:12,792
No! Ouch! Help! Ouch!

275
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,156
Help!

276
00:30:18,921 --> 00:30:19,640
No!

277
00:30:19,668 --> 00:30:20,643
Let go of me!

278
00:30:21,695 --> 00:30:23,089
Help!

279
00:30:24,567 --> 00:30:25,051
Help!

280
00:30:25,767 --> 00:30:26,377
Help!

281
00:30:27,988 --> 00:30:28,643
Help!

282
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,544
Auntie, how is Khun Eeang Peung?

283
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:40,784
How is she doing?

284
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,794
How dare you ask about her at this time?

285
00:30:47,916 --> 00:30:52,400
Why are you looking
at me like this, Auntie?

286
00:30:53,711 --> 00:30:56,135
So what do I do?

287
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,864
Do you realize what you have done, Maey?!

288
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,940
Don't you ever learn to be humble
and know your own place?!

289
00:31:06,528 --> 00:31:12,234
I love and care for you
just like my actual niece.

290
00:31:13,808 --> 00:31:18,560
I have cursed Fong Kaew every single day

291
00:31:19,605 --> 00:31:24,026
without evening realizing

292
00:31:24,714 --> 00:31:27,376
that you would do such a lewd thing
to your own master!

293
00:31:28,864 --> 00:31:31,880
But Khun Eeang Peung and I,

294
00:31:32,613 --> 00:31:34,085
We have loved each other for so long.

295
00:31:34,704 --> 00:31:36,368
We have done nothing wrong!

296
00:31:36,832 --> 00:31:40,026
So you don't know that she's married?!

297
00:31:40,885 --> 00:31:44,900
You don't know that her
husband is your master,

298
00:31:45,434 --> 00:31:48,709
who has given you shelter and food?!

299
00:31:50,896 --> 00:31:56,900
Maey, you could have
done it with anybody else,

300
00:31:57,104 --> 00:31:59,136
not with Khun Eeang Peung!

301
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:04,052
Auntie!

302
00:32:04,052 --> 00:32:08,078
Argh! Just eat!

303
00:32:08,773 --> 00:32:11,300
And think of what you have done.

304
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,840
If you still have no brains,

305
00:32:14,123 --> 00:32:17,260
then this is where you belong!

306
00:32:19,286 --> 00:32:19,720
Auntie...

307
00:33:00,260 --> 00:33:00,866
Eeang Peung,

308
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:04,656
I...

309
00:34:10,863 --> 00:34:11,833
What are you doing, Fong Kaew?

310
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:19,236
I asked, why are you
still here at this time?

311
00:34:21,770 --> 00:34:22,787
Sir,

312
00:34:24,028 --> 00:34:26,380
I just came here to
clean the stuff as usual.

313
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:28,954
Aren't you already familiar?

314
00:34:31,411 --> 00:34:32,485
How hardworking you are!

315
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:39,232
How strange! You have cleaned the room,

316
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,003
but why is there still
dust on my bookshelf?

317
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:49,000
Well, I mightn't have
cleaned it well enough.

318
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:56,421
So, thank you for your help.

319
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,469
But you don't have to do it any longer.

320
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:03,363
I will have someone else
clean this room instead,

321
00:35:04,581 --> 00:35:05,880
so you don't have to be bothered.

322
00:35:08,396 --> 00:35:08,821
Yes, sir.

323
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:12,920
So, please excuse me.

324
00:35:15,505 --> 00:35:16,341
Fong Kaew.

325
00:35:18,363 --> 00:35:19,247
Yes, sir.

326
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:24,640
Bring me some desserts in this room.

327
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,580
I think, from now on,

328
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:31,680
I will be working in this
room again for a while.

329
00:35:34,088 --> 00:35:37,241
It seems like I have to take charge
of everyone's conduct here.

330
00:35:39,636 --> 00:35:40,143
Yes, sir.

331
00:35:50,545 --> 00:35:51,561
The lettuces are selling out.

332
00:35:52,109 --> 00:35:53,197
Today we've got a good sale, mom?

333
00:35:55,323 --> 00:35:56,659
Two items, and the cabbage, right?

334
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:57,620
Yes.

335
00:35:58,312 --> 00:35:59,716
No change! Thank you!

336
00:36:01,825 --> 00:36:04,149
Khamsaen, you've turned
over a new leaf, haven't you?

337
00:36:04,384 --> 00:36:06,430
So take care of the stall.

338
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,242
- Yes.
- I'm going home.

339
00:36:08,892 --> 00:36:10,291
You're selling them good today, right?

340
00:36:12,629 --> 00:36:12,908
I'm leaving.

341
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:14,059
Yes.

342
00:36:23,473 --> 00:36:24,418
Khamsaen.

343
00:36:29,238 --> 00:36:31,192
Well, I...

344
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:34,940
I don' think we should be talking here.

345
00:36:37,006 --> 00:36:40,936
I'm afraid that any of your servants
or acquaintances will see us again.

346
00:36:44,910 --> 00:36:46,129
Go and wait for me at
the corner over there.

347
00:36:47,014 --> 00:36:47,847
Be careful.

348
00:36:49,215 --> 00:36:51,404
Go, and when my mom comes back here,
I will come for you as soon as possible.

349
00:37:19,931 --> 00:37:20,468
Fong Kaew!

350
00:37:22,634 --> 00:37:23,140
Auntie...

351
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,540
What are you doing here?

352
00:37:29,699 --> 00:37:34,800
Well, I'm... I'm here to meet Khamsaen.

353
00:37:36,414 --> 00:37:38,112
Why do you want to meet my son again?

354
00:37:39,696 --> 00:37:41,897
He has become a better
person and moved on from you!

355
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:44,473
Better...?

356
00:37:45,683 --> 00:37:50,220
Don't you know that he was such a drunkard,

357
00:37:50,758 --> 00:37:52,048
losing his very sense,

358
00:37:53,107 --> 00:37:54,640
just because you had dumped him!

359
00:37:56,134 --> 00:37:58,180
So how dare you show up here again?!

360
00:38:00,310 --> 00:38:04,427
But... I needed to do it.

361
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:09,066
I know you might have seen
me as an indecent woman,

362
00:38:10,979 --> 00:38:16,683
but you know what I have
been through, don't you?

363
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:21,627
I know. I understand you, Fong Kaew.

364
00:38:22,893 --> 00:38:27,180
And I know how your mom never learns
to keep her feet on the ground.

365
00:38:28,325 --> 00:38:30,000
She still looks down on my family

366
00:38:31,617 --> 00:38:33,380
as she has always done,

367
00:38:34,908 --> 00:38:38,440
even now that she's
reached the nadir of her life.

368
00:38:39,628 --> 00:38:41,405
I beg you, Fong Kaew.

369
00:38:43,931 --> 00:38:45,628
Please let Khamsaen go.

370
00:38:48,653 --> 00:38:53,240
Think that you are no longer meant for him.

371
00:38:54,182 --> 00:38:59,302
Please... I want my son back.

372
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:25,954
- Mom.
- Hey, Khamsaen.

373
00:39:26,314 --> 00:39:29,110
Help me sort the
vegetables out on the stall.

374
00:39:29,537 --> 00:39:32,540
Ok, mom. Excuse me for a while.

375
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,340
Khamsaen!

376
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:35,700
Son! Khamsaen!

377
00:39:48,914 --> 00:39:49,268
Fong Kaew!

378
00:39:53,817 --> 00:39:54,300
Fong Kaew!

379
00:40:20,977 --> 00:40:22,170
Ah! Here you come!

380
00:40:24,280 --> 00:40:26,017
What is so urgent that made you

381
00:40:26,702 --> 00:40:27,690
invite me to your house like this?

382
00:40:30,560 --> 00:40:32,490
Do you remember your
concern for me at the party

383
00:40:32,515 --> 00:40:33,505
on the promotion day?

384
00:40:35,506 --> 00:40:36,440
Yes, I do.

385
00:40:37,266 --> 00:40:38,810
Well, is something else going on?

386
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:41,422
Not at this time.

387
00:40:42,393 --> 00:40:45,550
But I think I've seen it coming

388
00:40:45,550 --> 00:40:47,780
in the way you have foretold.

389
00:40:53,504 --> 00:40:53,938
Hmh...

390
00:40:57,654 --> 00:40:59,720
If you want to nip it in the bud,

391
00:41:00,290 --> 00:41:02,840
you might have to do the same

392
00:41:03,247 --> 00:41:07,216
as you did to your daughter Eeang Peung.

393
00:41:10,556 --> 00:41:11,900
So who would be the right woman?

394
00:41:14,822 --> 00:41:16,520
My daughter, Busabong.

395
00:41:17,094 --> 00:41:20,054
They have known each other for a long time.

396
00:41:21,036 --> 00:41:22,921
You wouldn't mind.

397
00:41:24,115 --> 00:41:25,780
If we were to join our family trees, right?

398
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:29,420
Because I think that.

399
00:41:30,614 --> 00:41:33,382
Yai has met her often since he was young.

400
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:37,560
I think this will be a good solution

401
00:41:37,763 --> 00:41:39,049
for our families.

402
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:42,537
It sounds nice.

403
00:41:43,939 --> 00:41:46,580
I finally want to settle
this once and for all.

404
00:41:57,936 --> 00:42:00,940
Where are you taking me, Khun Yai?

405
00:42:02,544 --> 00:42:03,520
Just follow my lead.

406
00:42:08,464 --> 00:42:08,992
Stay here.

407
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:10,384
Yes.

408
00:42:19,558 --> 00:42:20,537
I'll open the blindfold.

409
00:42:31,344 --> 00:42:33,260
This is what I want you to see,

410
00:42:59,300 --> 00:43:03,080
my favorite spot ever
since I moved to Chiang Mai.

411
00:43:04,326 --> 00:43:05,900
Khun Yai, it's very beautiful!

412
00:43:06,744 --> 00:43:09,904
I have watched fireflies
with my friends quite a few times,

413
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:11,790
but this is the very first time...

414
00:43:12,773 --> 00:43:14,272
when I see so many fireflies like this.

415
00:43:16,457 --> 00:43:19,510
So you remember another
thing about your past, don't you?

416
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:30,400
Ugh! Well... It's getting more and more.

417
00:43:31,820 --> 00:43:33,988
There's a flash of a vision in my head

418
00:43:33,996 --> 00:43:35,920
when I see a familiar scenario.

419
00:44:06,590 --> 00:44:07,636
I'm so glad

420
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,300
to be here with you Jom

421
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:14,760
at such a special night.

422
00:44:18,092 --> 00:44:18,900
Me too.

423
00:44:21,456 --> 00:44:31,370
♪ Because my love is
endless, it goes on perpetually ♪

424
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:36,870
♪ Nothing can erase these
traces of love from me ♪

425
00:44:37,076 --> 00:44:42,366
♪ Unlike a flower's scent
that can't be scented forever ♪

426
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:53,520
♪ Because my heart beats
persistently, only for you, tirelessly ♪

427
00:44:53,911 --> 00:44:58,950
♪ This scent of love will
follow you indefinitely ♪

428
00:44:59,431 --> 00:45:04,355
♪ This heart will search
for you, for always ♪

429
00:45:16,933 --> 00:45:17,310
Jom.

430
00:45:18,626 --> 00:45:18,860
Yes.

431
00:45:19,324 --> 00:45:20,020
What's going on?

432
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:25,213
Well, I...

433
00:45:26,146 --> 00:45:28,720
I think I see...

434
00:45:30,222 --> 00:45:31,060
Ugh! Ugh!

435
00:45:31,853 --> 00:45:32,573
It's raining, Jom.

436
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:34,013
Let's go home.

437
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:34,813
Well, yes.

438
00:45:42,568 --> 00:45:45,795
Eh? It's stopped raining.

439
00:45:49,555 --> 00:45:50,555
What are you laughing, Jom?

440
00:45:52,604 --> 00:45:54,355
I think it's quite funny.

441
00:45:54,506 --> 00:45:56,564
Last time we were running
for shelter from the rain,

442
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:57,608
just like this time.

443
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,750
Right. I already planned to make this night

444
00:46:02,750 --> 00:46:04,317
our special night.

445
00:46:06,362 --> 00:46:07,970
But it's raining again!

446
00:46:14,378 --> 00:46:14,774
Huh?

447
00:46:17,006 --> 00:46:18,492
What are you doing?!

448
00:46:19,319 --> 00:46:24,445
You just said that
it's raining like before,

449
00:46:25,646 --> 00:46:30,650
so now it's supposed to end with...

450
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:31,588
Stop, please.

451
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:37,512
Come on, Jom!

452
00:46:43,225 --> 00:46:47,547
I was kidding. Please don't mind it.

453
00:46:49,301 --> 00:46:52,385
Whenever I see you like this,

454
00:46:53,498 --> 00:46:55,520
I really adore you.

455
00:47:03,949 --> 00:47:05,898
Well, Khun Yai.

456
00:47:08,174 --> 00:47:11,068
Do you feel like I feel?

457
00:47:11,120 --> 00:47:15,250
These times,

458
00:47:16,745 --> 00:47:18,795
it seems like someone is always spying us.

459
00:47:21,495 --> 00:47:22,490
No, I don't.

460
00:47:23,930 --> 00:47:24,775
Do you?

461
00:47:27,035 --> 00:47:27,290
Yes.

462
00:47:29,850 --> 00:47:31,880
Hmh... But when you don't feel it,

463
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:34,948
then it might be all in my head.

464
00:47:54,792 --> 00:47:55,124
Huh?

465
00:47:57,048 --> 00:47:57,804
What's this, Jom?

466
00:47:58,870 --> 00:47:59,716
Can I ride on your back?

467
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:02,252
Ride on my back?

468
00:48:02,888 --> 00:48:03,224
Yes.

469
00:48:03,448 --> 00:48:03,916
My back?

470
00:48:04,424 --> 00:48:04,752
Yes.

471
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:09,688
Can't I?

472
00:48:10,636 --> 00:48:14,970
Yes, you can.

473
00:48:16,741 --> 00:48:18,186
1... 2... 3!

474
00:48:18,363 --> 00:48:19,030
Ugh! Ugh!

475
00:48:19,393 --> 00:48:21,436
Ouch! Oh!

476
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:24,133
How do you feel, Khun Yai?

477
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,410
So now you know how I feel, right?

478
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:28,520
Everytime you plead me to do stuff,

479
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,254
it's a real burden.

480
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,257
Are you getting revenge on me?

481
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:35,920
- Huh?
- Ouch!

482
00:48:36,024 --> 00:48:36,234
Hey!

483
00:48:36,502 --> 00:48:37,368
No, Khun Yai!

484
00:48:37,575 --> 00:48:37,955
No!

485
00:48:38,378 --> 00:48:39,421
Khun Yai!

486
00:48:39,765 --> 00:48:43,024
Hey! Khun Yai! I'm gonna fall!

487
00:48:43,558 --> 00:48:46,416
How was it? Do you still
want to ride on my back?

488
00:48:46,730 --> 00:48:50,048
Aw! How wicked the boys are these days!

489
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:56,954
So, it's your bath time, right?

490
00:48:57,568 --> 00:48:57,770
Eh?

491
00:48:58,016 --> 00:48:59,093
Let's bathe!

492
00:48:59,824 --> 00:49:01,740
Hey! I can walk! Khun Yai, stop!

493
00:49:01,957 --> 00:49:03,066
Khun Yai!

494
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:27,200
No, it still doesn't work.

495
00:49:28,229 --> 00:49:29,738
It's not quite an auspicious time.

496
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:35,637
And, based on their natal
charts, they're not a match.

497
00:49:39,509 --> 00:49:40,901
Is there any solutions, provost?

498
00:49:42,016 --> 00:49:43,717
Well...

499
00:49:44,858 --> 00:49:48,400
I want them to get married
as soon as possible.

500
00:49:49,744 --> 00:49:51,797
If you want to rush it,

501
00:49:52,650 --> 00:49:53,970
there's a solution.

502
00:49:54,853 --> 00:49:57,754
You have to hold an engagement
ceremony for them first.

503
00:50:00,458 --> 00:50:01,296
Amen.

504
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:04,906
I will follow your instruction
as soon as possible.

505
00:50:07,196 --> 00:50:09,543
Why are you being in such a hurry?

506
00:50:10,512 --> 00:50:11,850
Now Yai is only

507
00:50:12,170 --> 00:50:14,917
20 years old recently.

508
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:18,106
Isn't it too quick for him, sir?

509
00:50:19,808 --> 00:50:23,717
Well, I've got something on my mind.

510
00:50:25,274 --> 00:50:28,725
So I believe that,

511
00:50:29,722 --> 00:50:32,112
if I get him to marry
Brother Dech's daughter before,

512
00:50:34,528 --> 00:50:36,544
I will have nothing to worry
about in the future to come.

513
00:50:41,066 --> 00:50:43,109
Your worry,

514
00:50:44,037 --> 00:50:48,469
it has to do with the boy
who has just moved to your house, right?

515
00:50:54,768 --> 00:50:55,904
How did you know that?

516
00:50:56,864 --> 00:50:59,578
I might not perceive everything,

517
00:51:01,077 --> 00:51:03,157
but I have to tell you something.

518
00:51:04,608 --> 00:51:09,248
They were destined to
meet each other long ago.

519
00:51:11,066 --> 00:51:12,378
And he is the one

520
00:51:12,789 --> 00:51:14,600
who will bring change

521
00:51:15,141 --> 00:51:16,848
to your house.

522
00:51:39,861 --> 00:51:40,565
Tea, Khun Yai.

523
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:52,368
Are you all right, Jom?

524
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:53,866
What's going on?

525
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:56,820
Today,

526
00:51:57,013 --> 00:51:58,048
you look quite unwell.

527
00:51:59,738 --> 00:52:02,997
Well, I'm fine, Khun Yai.

528
00:52:03,754 --> 00:52:06,850
I think it's sunnier than usual today,

529
00:52:06,901 --> 00:52:09,850
so I might be a bit tired from the heat.

530
00:52:11,578 --> 00:52:12,485
No worries.

531
00:52:13,728 --> 00:52:14,837
But if something happens with you,

532
00:52:15,877 --> 00:52:16,890
you have to tell me immediately.

533
00:52:42,197 --> 00:52:42,737
Jom!

534
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:44,668
Jom!

535
00:52:46,545 --> 00:52:47,037
Jom!

536
00:52:48,251 --> 00:52:48,622
Jom!

537
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:50,710
Jom! What's going on?!

538
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:52,797
Jom! What's going on?!

539
00:52:54,391 --> 00:52:55,380
Wake up, Jom! Jom!

540
00:52:58,074 --> 00:52:59,080
Anybody's here?!

541
00:52:59,811 --> 00:53:00,480
Help!

542
00:53:03,068 --> 00:53:03,520
Jom!

543
00:53:04,371 --> 00:53:05,368
Wake up, Jom! Jom!

544
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:09,820
Help!

545
00:53:10,571 --> 00:53:11,382
Jom!

546
00:53:13,928 --> 00:53:15,071
(Next Episode)
You still have a temperature, Jom.

547
00:53:15,110 --> 00:53:16,170
Let me wipe your body to bring it down.

548
00:53:16,542 --> 00:53:18,637
Khun Yai, you don't have to teach me now.

549
00:53:18,820 --> 00:53:24,440
I just want to touch my lover's hands.

550
00:53:24,965 --> 00:53:26,020
Yai.

551
00:53:26,228 --> 00:53:29,050
I've made you a croissant.

552
00:53:29,211 --> 00:53:31,445
I was told that you should like it.

553
00:53:31,577 --> 00:53:35,497
Your father thinks this is the right time.

554
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:38,620
The engagement ceremony
for you and Busabong.

555
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:40,260
So why did nobody

556
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:41,520
tell me about it, Mother?

557
00:53:41,641 --> 00:53:42,797
I want you to gradually

558
00:53:42,855 --> 00:53:44,987
break off your relationship with Yai, Jom.

559
00:53:45,685 --> 00:53:55,570
♪ Because my love is
endless, it goes on perpetually ♪

560
00:53:55,570 --> 00:54:00,980
♪ Nothing can erase these
traces of love from me ♪

561
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:06,420
♪ Unlike a flower's scent
that can't be scented forever ♪

562
00:54:07,660 --> 00:54:17,620
♪ Because my heart beats
persistently, only for you, tirelessly ♪

563
00:54:17,897 --> 00:54:23,060
♪ This scent of love will
follow you indefinitely ♪

564
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:34,220
♪ This heart will search
for you, for always ♪
