1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,500
(Previously)
Will there be another event at our home?

2
00:00:02,500 --> 00:00:04,841
It's the engagement ceremony for you and Busabong.

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:07,400
Having to live with someone I don't love,

4
00:00:07,422 --> 00:00:08,915
I can't do it! I can't do such a thing!

5
00:00:09,042 --> 00:00:10,011
Khun Yai, please believe me.

6
00:00:10,397 --> 00:00:12,700
Let's keep our story

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,391
as a good memory for us.

8
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:15,860
Khun Phra, everything

9
00:00:16,017 --> 00:00:17,953
you have anticipated has happened.

10
00:00:18,152 --> 00:00:19,180
What's going on?

11
00:00:19,298 --> 00:00:20,580
Why did you stop playing?

12
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:21,698
I am Jom.

13
00:00:21,889 --> 00:00:24,416
On this auspicious day
for my beloved master,

14
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,762
I have prepared a show

15
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,920
to present as a gift for him.

16
00:01:16,673 --> 00:01:17,200
Mr. James.

17
00:01:18,244 --> 00:01:18,860
Someone is here to see you.

18
00:01:21,629 --> 00:01:22,934
Oh? Jom.

19
00:01:31,065 --> 00:01:31,646
Mr. James.

20
00:01:33,322 --> 00:01:34,004
Is there something wrong?

21
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,357
How did you get here?

22
00:01:37,258 --> 00:01:39,482
Where's Khun Yai?

23
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:43,347
Ah... He didn't come with me today.

24
00:01:44,566 --> 00:01:47,580
The reason I came here today is because...

25
00:01:47,993 --> 00:01:50,116
I need your help with something.

26
00:02:15,643 --> 00:02:16,220
Fong Kaew.

27
00:02:17,950 --> 00:02:18,516
Khun Eeang Peung.

28
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:20,893
How are you?

29
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,387
Robert has not arrived yet right?

30
00:02:23,052 --> 00:02:25,360
I've had Mr. James
trick him to go to the party

31
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,360
at the club.

32
00:02:27,476 --> 00:02:29,600
Don't be worried.

33
00:02:30,006 --> 00:02:31,280
But I'm not sure

34
00:02:31,815 --> 00:02:35,593
how long he can trust
the people in his home.

35
00:02:36,769 --> 00:02:37,606
Fong Kaew.

36
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,849
So the thing you told me to look for...

37
00:02:42,627 --> 00:02:43,920
Does it look like this?

38
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:54,996
That's right, Khun Eeang Peung.

39
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:01,581
Thank you.

40
00:03:07,975 --> 00:03:09,780
Jom, please wait a moment.

41
00:03:10,344 --> 00:03:11,913
The person that I'm supposed to
meet with is almost here.

42
00:03:12,289 --> 00:03:14,633
And if it's as I assumed,

43
00:03:15,766 --> 00:03:17,400
he should really be able to help us.

44
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,603
Thank you very much, Mr. James.

45
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:30,393
Jom.

46
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,620
It must hurt a lot.

47
00:03:37,027 --> 00:03:37,620
Jom.

48
00:03:48,283 --> 00:03:53,994
Mr. James, do you remembers the story
that you told me about

49
00:03:55,148 --> 00:03:57,262
your ex-lover?

50
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,400
I remember.

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,280
I think that, sometimes...

52
00:04:08,514 --> 00:04:10,300
we're not so different.

53
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:27,380
Because every time I truly love someone,

54
00:04:27,925 --> 00:04:29,960
something happens that

55
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,500
comes and stops my love forever.

56
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,604
Making my love come to an end and
having no way to go. Every single time.

57
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,160
And now I think that

58
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,140
maybe...

59
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:45,136
I wasn't meant to love anyone.

60
00:04:45,904 --> 00:04:47,300
Sometimes I imagine that

61
00:04:48,228 --> 00:04:49,788
is there was a god...

62
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:55,200
he might have cursed me

63
00:04:57,728 --> 00:04:59,244
with not being able to have love.

64
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,052
Isn't that a good thing?

65
00:05:11,748 --> 00:05:14,360
That you experienced the feeling

66
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,040
of being with the person you love.

67
00:05:18,844 --> 00:05:22,690
I said that I was more unlucky than you

68
00:05:26,825 --> 00:05:29,145
it's because I've never experienced it.

69
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:37,700
Mr. James.

70
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:47,507
Mr. James.

71
00:05:53,553 --> 00:05:54,635
You've arrived.

72
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:55,820
Yes.

73
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:06,060
Hello.

74
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,600
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 10)

75
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:10,269
Sorry for interrupting everyone.

76
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:25,945
I'm Jom.

77
00:07:27,313 --> 00:07:29,002
Khun Yai's closest majordomo.

78
00:07:33,044 --> 00:07:35,625
Because today is an auspicious
day for my beloved master,

79
00:07:36,697 --> 00:07:39,830
so I made preparations for a show

80
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:44,762
to present as a gift for him.

81
00:07:47,971 --> 00:07:51,200
Khun Yai, are you willing to accept it?

82
00:08:10,705 --> 00:08:11,929
Ah ha ha.

83
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:16,360
On the night when I was walking.

84
00:08:16,385 --> 00:08:19,900
In the midst of the
seemingly empty atmosphere,

85
00:08:20,282 --> 00:08:23,072
much like every night, my
life for over thirty years...

86
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,649
I have walked past many people,

87
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:31,383
those who mock me for being myself.

88
00:08:32,475 --> 00:08:35,162
In reality, they do not hate or despise me,

89
00:08:36,512 --> 00:08:40,400
but they never acknowledge me,

90
00:08:41,102 --> 00:08:42,920
just like they do with each other.

91
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,173
Many faces, many men,

92
00:08:45,404 --> 00:08:48,720
see me only as... a time killer.

93
00:08:50,324 --> 00:08:52,013
They pursue their desires,

94
00:08:52,671 --> 00:08:54,160
and when morning comes,

95
00:08:54,782 --> 00:08:56,720
they act as if they have forgotten

96
00:08:57,177 --> 00:09:00,520
who laid beside them last night.

97
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:02,786
But I won't stand for it,

98
00:09:03,484 --> 00:09:07,080
because... I will go find them later.

99
00:09:08,216 --> 00:09:10,080
Ha-ha.

100
00:09:10,621 --> 00:09:12,936
This house looks nice too, doesn't it?

101
00:09:14,729 --> 00:09:17,068
Oh, because tonight,

102
00:09:18,715 --> 00:09:22,425
I still believe and continue to seek

103
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:26,865
someone to be my pillar of strength.

104
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,903
And I have found them.

105
00:09:34,456 --> 00:09:35,783
They walked past me,

106
00:09:35,929 --> 00:09:37,576
with mysterious and enticing gestures.

107
00:09:38,169 --> 00:09:41,162
There's an overwhelming
charm on the path of Kad Luang,

108
00:09:42,235 --> 00:09:43,821
and I'm not hesitating at all.

109
00:09:44,037 --> 00:09:47,491
I follow him with a strong
and daring desire in my heart.

110
00:09:47,694 --> 00:09:49,120
I follow him,

111
00:09:50,277 --> 00:09:54,140
walking into Kad Luang,

112
00:09:54,849 --> 00:09:58,000
incessantly, following the
footsteps of the man I love.

113
00:09:58,547 --> 00:09:59,464
Going on and on.

114
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,142
Going on and on.

115
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:03,794
Going on and on.

116
00:10:04,175 --> 00:10:05,400
Ha-ha.

117
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:09,580
And then I found him there.

118
00:10:09,965 --> 00:10:11,280
I found him there.

119
00:10:12,114 --> 00:10:15,740
So, I began to move my body

120
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,660
according to the song in my own mind,

121
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:23,900
just to catch his gaze one time.

122
00:10:24,325 --> 00:10:28,325
Could you gaze into my eyes just once?

123
00:10:31,093 --> 00:10:34,340
While I was being ecstatic

124
00:10:35,724 --> 00:10:38,533
my face was bathed in red light,

125
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,140
as everything came to a halt,

126
00:10:42,103 --> 00:10:43,180
right in front of me.

127
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,766
It was a flickering flame rising
amidst the grandeur of Kad Luang.

128
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:52,446
And I gazed at that man.

129
00:10:52,893 --> 00:10:54,566
His hand was holding an oil can.

130
00:10:55,653 --> 00:11:00,840
He ignited the flames and
gazed at the red flickering fire,

131
00:11:01,328 --> 00:11:03,840
looking so contented.

132
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,288
Suddenly, he began chanting,

133
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:09,180
about a man wielding power over him,

134
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,180
wielding power over him,

135
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,824
giving out the orders.

136
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,344
I pondered,

137
00:11:15,864 --> 00:11:18,792
what kind of mindset must
the one pulling the strings

138
00:11:19,424 --> 00:11:21,464
behind him possess to
command such things...

139
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,840
to order something like that?

140
00:11:24,472 --> 00:11:26,180
Such heinous things.

141
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:34,228
Oh no,

142
00:11:34,263 --> 00:11:34,840
Oh!

143
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,060
Oh no!

144
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:37,100
Ha-ha.

145
00:11:37,205 --> 00:11:37,820
Oh no, anger!

146
00:11:37,862 --> 00:11:44,400
Ha-ha!

147
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,796
He's not even angry like you!

148
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:48,963
Stop!

149
00:12:03,369 --> 00:12:04,950
What exactly are you intending to do?

150
00:12:05,436 --> 00:12:07,580
Who brought this pervert to ruin our party.

151
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,140
Huh?!

152
00:12:12,024 --> 00:12:13,739
I don't plan on ruining anyone's party.

153
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:15,400
What I did

154
00:12:17,071 --> 00:12:18,160
was just that I wanted to reveal the truth.

155
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:19,603
With the matter that happened, that's all.

156
00:12:23,968 --> 00:12:25,467
What truth?

157
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,426
This is what I said to you before.

158
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:31,193
It didn't go into your head at all?

159
00:12:31,481 --> 00:12:32,340
The fact that...

160
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,580
Phraya Soradech and Mr. Robert

161
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,700
are involved and behind

162
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,580
the arson at Kad Luang.

163
00:12:50,713 --> 00:12:52,540
Stop your nonsense.

164
00:12:53,353 --> 00:12:55,154
Just because you think
you're my son-in-law's favorite helper

165
00:12:55,913 --> 00:12:56,980
you think I won't dare do anything?

166
00:12:57,746 --> 00:12:58,904
I'm not talking nonsense.

167
00:12:59,822 --> 00:13:00,796
I have evidence

168
00:13:02,139 --> 00:13:03,405
and the evidence is that

169
00:13:06,326 --> 00:13:07,499
sheet of paper that Niew

170
00:13:07,753 --> 00:13:09,580
just gave to Mr. Robert.

171
00:13:10,299 --> 00:13:12,125
Evidence from a pervert

172
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,380
that thinks he is a woman?

173
00:13:26,097 --> 00:13:28,354
Anyone can write this!

174
00:13:32,427 --> 00:13:34,107
And if I am the one who confirms

175
00:13:36,059 --> 00:13:37,321
that it is in fact that piece of paper,

176
00:13:38,514 --> 00:13:40,573
which I took from your room,

177
00:13:41,252 --> 00:13:41,714
Robert?

178
00:13:44,473 --> 00:13:46,914
Mr. Robert, you're probably thinking

179
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,608
that you had people burn and throw it away.

180
00:14:05,231 --> 00:14:08,800
Actually, it was not the original letter.

181
00:14:10,488 --> 00:14:12,208
But I am a person who rewrote it
from the strokes of your pen.

182
00:14:13,048 --> 00:14:14,680
Next to the page that was torn out.

183
00:14:15,305 --> 00:14:16,500
The actual paper,

184
00:14:17,663 --> 00:14:19,309
Niew was the one who picked it up from Kad.

185
00:14:23,663 --> 00:14:24,917
I have evidence.

186
00:14:29,957 --> 00:14:30,840
But what does it have to do with me?

187
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:33,886
And that book belonged to Robert.

188
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:35,680
It has nothing to do with me at all.

189
00:14:38,741 --> 00:14:39,860
Is it true, Uncle?

190
00:14:40,795 --> 00:14:42,016
But in that book,

191
00:14:42,484 --> 00:14:46,940
there is information that you were involved

192
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,580
in the corruption of villagers' land.

193
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:52,227
It was very clear.

194
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:56,018
And not just this.

195
00:14:57,673 --> 00:14:59,501
Because I also have additional evidence.

196
00:15:00,923 --> 00:15:01,470
Let me go!

197
00:15:01,956 --> 00:15:02,615
Let me go!

198
00:15:03,132 --> 00:15:03,833
Let go of me!

199
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,860
I said let go!

200
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:08,980
Khamsaen.

201
00:15:16,701 --> 00:15:18,360
He's confessed it all

202
00:15:19,716 --> 00:15:21,640
that he was hired by you

203
00:15:22,603 --> 00:15:24,104
and he's made a lot of money.

204
00:15:25,304 --> 00:15:27,658
He's the man I saw that night.

205
00:15:27,829 --> 00:15:30,240
On the day of the fire at the Kad.

206
00:15:30,672 --> 00:15:32,420
Thank you very much for the truth, Niew.

207
00:15:33,407 --> 00:15:34,960
If you don't want to go to jail,

208
00:15:36,414 --> 00:15:39,212
you will tell the truth now.

209
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:48,800
Mr. Robert and Phraya Soradech hired me.

210
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,056
It's true.

211
00:15:52,196 --> 00:15:55,905
I did it because I was greedy.

212
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,952
I'm really sorry, sir.
Please don't take me to jail.

213
00:16:05,105 --> 00:16:05,709
Well?

214
00:16:06,683 --> 00:16:08,400
The evidence is so clear.

215
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,567
How will you make excuses?

216
00:16:17,418 --> 00:16:18,014
Brother Dech.

217
00:16:25,818 --> 00:16:26,392
Khun Phra.

218
00:16:28,392 --> 00:16:30,138
If you thinks that Niew is perverted

219
00:16:32,392 --> 00:16:34,974
just because he dresses
and behaves like a woman.

220
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:37,600
If so...

221
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:42,820
What Phraya Soradech and Mr. Robert did,
isn't it even more perverted?

222
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,796
Will you really let this engagement

223
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:54,130
smear the Palathip family?

224
00:16:59,549 --> 00:17:00,618
Please.

225
00:17:03,658 --> 00:17:05,330
Please reconsider.

226
00:18:04,247 --> 00:18:04,669
Brother Dech.

227
00:18:11,236 --> 00:18:12,545
Why did you have to do that?

228
00:18:14,712 --> 00:18:16,087
If we want to be powerful

229
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,716
you have to take risks.

230
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,741
I've taught you this before.

231
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:25,400
Today I might get caught.

232
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:26,349
Ugh!

233
00:18:27,376 --> 00:18:28,036
But do you know?

234
00:18:29,060 --> 00:18:32,120
How many people have not been caught

235
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:35,460
and are still in power?

236
00:18:36,945 --> 00:18:37,375
Brother Dech.

237
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:27,060
Bus.

238
00:19:28,155 --> 00:19:29,285
Yes?

239
00:19:29,875 --> 00:19:33,110
I'm sorry too

240
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:34,800
about the matter that happened.

241
00:19:36,450 --> 00:19:38,100
It's okay.

242
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,140
I've known about my father for a while.

243
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,120
And besides, I'm bored

244
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:46,395
of playing the role of a perfect lady.

245
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:50,377
After this I will be
able to live my own life.

246
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,244
Eh!

247
00:19:54,737 --> 00:19:58,586
You did not intend to get engaged

248
00:19:58,611 --> 00:20:01,040
to Khun Yai?

249
00:20:01,944 --> 00:20:03,140
No.

250
00:20:03,748 --> 00:20:05,196
Even though I'm all grown up

251
00:20:05,512 --> 00:20:06,715
but I don't want to rush into marriage

252
00:20:06,715 --> 00:20:07,966
like other people.

253
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:12,337
This big problem has passed.

254
00:20:12,894 --> 00:20:13,970
From now on,

255
00:20:14,717 --> 00:20:16,968
take care of the person you love.

256
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,140
I will take good care of him.

257
00:20:26,915 --> 00:20:29,124
Please excuse me.

258
00:20:30,164 --> 00:20:30,973
See you again.

259
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:31,906
Yai.

260
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:32,893
Jom.

261
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:35,444
Good luck.

262
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:09,693
It's over, Fong Kaew.

263
00:21:12,475 --> 00:21:14,466
Misfortune has passed us.

264
00:21:20,315 --> 00:21:24,740
This time, you'll be able
to go back with me, right?

265
00:21:25,542 --> 00:21:26,124
Fong Kaew.

266
00:21:30,635 --> 00:21:31,595
Khamsaen.

267
00:21:34,302 --> 00:21:35,340
You go back first.

268
00:21:36,768 --> 00:21:38,982
I have other matters in the house
that need to be taken care of.

269
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:41,257
So when will you come back with me?

270
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,697
I can't wait patiently like in the past.

271
00:21:49,337 --> 00:21:50,060
Fong Kaew.

272
00:21:53,324 --> 00:21:54,377
It won't be long.

273
00:21:55,462 --> 00:21:56,368
I promise...

274
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:14,746
Sure, I've been waiting
for you all my life.

275
00:22:18,266 --> 00:22:23,845
Then I'll go back first, Fong Kaew.

276
00:23:25,973 --> 00:23:27,160
What's wrong?

277
00:23:28,565 --> 00:23:30,149
This is not like you.

278
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,095
I'm much weaker than you think.

279
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:39,930
If I was stronger,

280
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:44,940
this wouldn't have happened.

281
00:23:47,485 --> 00:23:48,340
That's right

282
00:23:49,475 --> 00:23:51,250
that you should blame yourself.

283
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:57,255
Your ambition for power is high.

284
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,895
And it came at the cost of suffering
for both of our children.

285
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,500
Are you trying to make me feel worse?

286
00:24:11,815 --> 00:24:12,755
Hmm, Kaekai?

287
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,225
I'm not going to aggravate you.

288
00:24:17,780 --> 00:24:21,563
But I couldn't speak to you more politely.

289
00:24:32,847 --> 00:24:33,614
Who knows?

290
00:24:35,192 --> 00:24:36,541
Things like this.

291
00:24:39,138 --> 00:24:40,254
If I'd known before,

292
00:24:43,221 --> 00:24:44,138
I probably wouldn't do it.

293
00:24:48,283 --> 00:24:51,381
You don't have to shirk
your responsibilities.

294
00:24:54,235 --> 00:24:57,580
Your ego is high.

295
00:24:59,008 --> 00:25:03,464
Do you know how sorry I have been?

296
00:25:03,811 --> 00:25:07,074
I had to had Peung to marry that Robert.

297
00:25:09,028 --> 00:25:13,240
Both of us should kneel
in front of our children

298
00:25:13,822 --> 00:25:15,520
and even apologize.

299
00:25:25,028 --> 00:25:27,142
For twenty years,

300
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,937
I was willing to be a passive wife.

301
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:37,188
Never interfere in your decisions.

302
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,137
But now I've changed.

303
00:25:46,228 --> 00:25:50,080
I am going to decide things

304
00:25:51,148 --> 00:25:52,480
on my own.

305
00:27:31,902 --> 00:27:33,411
You like to say that

306
00:27:33,514 --> 00:27:35,700
I'm secretly looking at you.

307
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:37,280
But it's you who is peeking at me.

308
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:39,020
Always peeking.

309
00:27:42,102 --> 00:27:43,291
Who said so?

310
00:27:44,594 --> 00:27:46,177
I'm looking at you with much intent.

311
00:27:51,350 --> 00:27:52,633
- Umm.
- Oh!

312
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:56,446
You've gotten feisty.

313
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:59,800
Your words are...

314
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:04,405
not really fitting for a 20 year old child.

315
00:28:14,262 --> 00:28:15,468
Who said I was a child?

316
00:28:18,165 --> 00:28:19,297
Actually, you

317
00:28:20,205 --> 00:28:21,331
should know best

318
00:28:22,914 --> 00:28:23,845
that I'm not a child anymore.

319
00:28:39,354 --> 00:28:41,554
Do you miss its sound?

320
00:28:49,548 --> 00:28:50,285
Yes.

321
00:28:52,325 --> 00:28:53,325
Before this...

322
00:28:56,394 --> 00:28:57,820
it beat so slowly

323
00:28:59,994 --> 00:29:05,175
that I didn't think it'd
beat like this again.

324
00:29:08,849 --> 00:29:13,580
♪ Do you know? That our hearts are bound ♪

325
00:29:13,913 --> 00:29:16,740
♪ Like twin flames found ♪

326
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,960
♪ Like a once lived life coming around ♪

327
00:30:03,603 --> 00:30:04,911
I won't take it anymore, Jom.

328
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,486
I won't let our home

329
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:14,173
be like this again.

330
00:30:48,427 --> 00:30:50,107
What are you doing?

331
00:30:51,666 --> 00:30:55,926
I just do what lovers should do.

332
00:31:00,577 --> 00:31:03,542
That night, you stayed and
scratched my back all night.

333
00:31:06,245 --> 00:31:06,822
Khun Yai.

334
00:31:08,702 --> 00:31:09,297
Khun Yai.

335
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:30,228
I've missed you.

336
00:31:33,651 --> 00:31:35,542
We haven't slept together
for only a few days.

337
00:31:38,228 --> 00:31:40,314
I couldn't help but yearn for you.

338
00:31:45,994 --> 00:31:47,560
Hm?

339
00:31:51,182 --> 00:31:52,348
What does that mean?

340
00:31:53,737 --> 00:31:59,469
It means that after we finished

341
00:32:01,389 --> 00:32:02,821
you don't miss me anymore?

342
00:32:03,818 --> 00:32:04,123
Hm?

343
00:32:06,363 --> 00:32:07,541
It's not like that.

344
00:32:09,156 --> 00:32:10,283
For you,

345
00:32:12,407 --> 00:32:13,949
I'm addicted to you.

346
00:32:30,836 --> 00:32:31,780
Khun Yai.

347
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:38,050
At this very moment

348
00:32:39,687 --> 00:32:40,880
how do you think everyone is feeling?

349
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,960
After the engagement

350
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,900
I came straight to you.

351
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:04,589
How do you feel?

352
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:08,349
When you were starting the ceremony?

353
00:33:11,796 --> 00:33:13,098
I did not feel a thing.

354
00:33:21,767 --> 00:33:27,500
Uh... That's good, Khun Yai.

355
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:31,421
That means that you're not unhappy.

356
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,300
Hmmm.

357
00:33:48,512 --> 00:33:49,675
It's worse than that.

358
00:33:54,004 --> 00:34:00,698
If the feeling still reminds
us that we are human,

359
00:34:03,226 --> 00:34:09,720
but not feeling is like being dead.

360
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:12,900
Just a body that can move.

361
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:18,053
No life, no heart.

362
00:34:19,622 --> 00:34:24,060
My morale at that moment...

363
00:34:27,930 --> 00:34:29,340
has gone somewhere.

364
00:35:04,750 --> 00:35:09,744
I wish your heart

365
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:14,549
will come back soon.

366
00:35:16,789 --> 00:35:22,312
And I wish you to pass
through all the evils

367
00:35:24,574 --> 00:35:25,469
through and through.

368
00:35:30,523 --> 00:35:30,967
Amen!

369
00:35:56,420 --> 00:35:59,200
My heart is back.

370
00:36:03,258 --> 00:36:04,872
It's right here in front of me.

371
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,985
I've told you before

372
00:36:14,312 --> 00:36:19,540
that you are... my heart and soul.

373
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,929
Oh, Khun Eeang Peung.

374
00:37:26,002 --> 00:37:26,891
Fong Kaew.

375
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:27,560
Yes?

376
00:37:27,979 --> 00:37:30,900
Oh, why won't you eat first?

377
00:37:31,873 --> 00:37:34,220
I'm used to it Khun Eeang Peung.

378
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:35,926
Sit down.

379
00:37:36,286 --> 00:37:36,840
OK.

380
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:50,660
How are you?

381
00:37:51,086 --> 00:37:52,773
I meant about today.

382
00:37:56,226 --> 00:38:01,180
I feel carefree and relaxed.

383
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,520
Do you feel the same?

384
00:38:03,613 --> 00:38:04,500
That's right.

385
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:11,906
But what are you thinking of doing next?

386
00:38:12,246 --> 00:38:13,760
What's the next plan?

387
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:21,340
I will probably be here a while.

388
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:25,420
But in the future, I will have to expand

389
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:28,400
and find a way to get myself out.

390
00:38:29,186 --> 00:38:31,020
Why don't we stay here together?

391
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,080
I'm too afraid to do that.

392
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,173
And besides,

393
00:38:38,846 --> 00:38:41,500
I have no dignity left in this house.

394
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,920
Fong Kaew, why do you say that?

395
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:50,140
You're like one of my friends.

396
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:53,480
If you think you will
come, you will surely can.

397
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,740
If you want to stay, you
can stay, Fong Kaew.

398
00:39:00,773 --> 00:39:02,473
Thank you.

399
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:05,713
Please eat.

400
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:06,740
Yes.

401
00:39:13,900 --> 00:39:15,760
Oh, Khun Eeang Peung?

402
00:39:16,753 --> 00:39:20,120
Do you have any errands
that you need to run today?

403
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,960
There isn't any.

404
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:30,480
I want to take you

405
00:39:31,433 --> 00:39:33,020
to meet someone.

406
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:38,173
Who is it?

407
00:39:57,193 --> 00:40:00,340
Where is it?

408
00:40:01,073 --> 00:40:03,640
At my home.

409
00:40:04,566 --> 00:40:08,206
Well, the truth is...

410
00:40:08,526 --> 00:40:11,880
I want to take you to meet my mother.

411
00:40:12,586 --> 00:40:15,586
But I don't know where she went.

412
00:40:16,873 --> 00:40:18,966
Please let me go get her.

413
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:21,260
Yes, Fong Kaew.

414
00:40:34,893 --> 00:40:35,573
Khun Eeang Peung.

415
00:40:39,486 --> 00:40:40,320
Maey.

416
00:40:43,953 --> 00:40:44,820
It really is Maey.

417
00:40:46,153 --> 00:40:47,680
Yes, it's me.

418
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,180
Maey, how are you?

419
00:40:54,686 --> 00:40:55,840
Where does it hurt?

420
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:57,353
Are you well?

421
00:40:58,120 --> 00:40:59,180
I'm fine now.

422
00:40:59,453 --> 00:41:00,620
I am feeling fine now.

423
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:03,400
Fong Kaew's mother took good care of me.

424
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,766
Khun Eeang Peung, don't blame yourself.

425
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:08,986
I understand everything well.

426
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,013
Maey.

427
00:41:13,653 --> 00:41:14,500
It's ok.

428
00:41:14,746 --> 00:41:15,560
I am sorry.

429
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:19,760
It's ok.

430
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,813
I've missed you so much.

431
00:41:27,626 --> 00:41:29,900
I've missed you so much.

432
00:41:31,053 --> 00:41:32,960
I've missed you too.

433
00:41:45,580 --> 00:41:48,300
Is there something wrong?

434
00:41:59,920 --> 00:42:02,700
Are you ok?

435
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,020
What happened?

436
00:42:11,013 --> 00:42:13,866
I don't know, suddenly she felt nauseated.

437
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,446
Like she's going to throw up.

438
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,486
How are you?

439
00:42:19,773 --> 00:42:20,700
Do you want a glass of water?

440
00:42:22,753 --> 00:42:23,260
No, thank you.

441
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,020
I think...

442
00:42:25,686 --> 00:42:29,480
I probably have a lot to
worry about these days.

443
00:42:30,453 --> 00:42:34,340
I think you should take me home first.

444
00:42:35,113 --> 00:42:36,360
Maey, Fong Kaew.

445
00:42:37,580 --> 00:42:38,360
Yes, Khun Eeang Peung.

446
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:40,360
Let's go.

447
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:55,306
Luckily, Khun Eeang Peung
is a kind-hearted person.

448
00:42:55,780 --> 00:42:57,093
Giving compensation to the servants

449
00:42:57,269 --> 00:42:58,600
and now many of them

450
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,076
are able to move out
and set up their own roots.

451
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:07,698
And what about Ming and Aunt Maen?

452
00:43:08,316 --> 00:43:09,101
What should you do next?

453
00:43:09,858 --> 00:43:13,664
Sigh, what am I going to do?

454
00:43:14,304 --> 00:43:15,696
We have nowhere to go.

455
00:43:15,740 --> 00:43:16,740
So it must be here.

456
00:43:17,477 --> 00:43:20,282
Even if we get money, will it be
enough to last us for a few years?

457
00:43:20,500 --> 00:43:23,504
Ugh, I tried convincing my mom

458
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:24,874
but she refused to go.

459
00:43:25,173 --> 00:43:27,706
You know that my mother is stubborn.

460
00:43:28,266 --> 00:43:30,080
You really are something.

461
00:43:32,410 --> 00:43:33,568
We aren't much

462
00:43:34,261 --> 00:43:35,200
but you look at her...

463
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:41,200
After the Maey disappeared

464
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:42,394
Thip fell into this condition.

465
00:43:48,912 --> 00:43:50,720
What's wrong?

466
00:43:54,288 --> 00:43:56,005
Huh?!

467
00:43:57,312 --> 00:43:58,032
Huh?!

468
00:43:58,442 --> 00:43:59,100
Maey!

469
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:02,330
Is this really Maey?

470
00:44:06,368 --> 00:44:09,580
That hurts!

471
00:44:10,730 --> 00:44:11,580
Good!

472
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,613
So you know how worried I was!

473
00:44:14,938 --> 00:44:18,357
Maey...

474
00:44:18,778 --> 00:44:20,420
Welcome home.

475
00:44:20,420 --> 00:44:21,450
Hmm.

476
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:22,698
Ming.

477
00:44:27,088 --> 00:44:28,453
I know...

478
00:44:29,034 --> 00:44:30,352
We're just friends.

479
00:44:31,700 --> 00:44:32,784
Like you and me!

480
00:44:33,008 --> 00:44:34,360
Sure.

481
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:36,940
What about me?

482
00:44:43,136 --> 00:44:43,760
Maey...

483
00:45:05,754 --> 00:45:07,210
Have you been waiting for long?

484
00:45:08,234 --> 00:45:09,413
Not long, Mother.

485
00:45:09,820 --> 00:45:10,720
I just came a while ago.

486
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,460
Prik, please bring me some tea.

487
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:18,000
And bring some fresh jasmine water for Yai.

488
00:45:18,466 --> 00:45:19,555
Yes, Khun Ying.

489
00:45:22,271 --> 00:45:23,537
How are you?

490
00:45:24,648 --> 00:45:25,444
I'm doing good.

491
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:28,488
How are you holding up?

492
00:45:29,391 --> 00:45:31,120
I'm fine.

493
00:45:39,666 --> 00:45:41,462
Are you looking for your father?

494
00:45:42,253 --> 00:45:45,709
Yes.

495
00:45:47,316 --> 00:45:49,767
I haven't seen him in a few days.

496
00:45:50,661 --> 00:45:51,927
How is he?

497
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:54,574
It's how it is.

498
00:45:55,527 --> 00:46:00,160
Sigh, the older one get, the
more they hold on to their ego.

499
00:46:00,370 --> 00:46:01,570
That's why it's been like this.

500
00:46:02,683 --> 00:46:05,760
Your father is not a person
who lets things go so easily.

501
00:46:06,407 --> 00:46:07,900
Give him some time.

502
00:46:09,527 --> 00:46:09,780
Yes.

503
00:46:12,800 --> 00:46:16,189
Is there something wrong?

504
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:23,920
Thank you Prik.

505
00:46:27,796 --> 00:46:28,472
Well?

506
00:46:29,745 --> 00:46:31,540
Do you remember when you asked your father

507
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:32,941
about going to study abroad?

508
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:35,963
Yes.

509
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:40,354
But he didn't agree with me.

510
00:46:42,510 --> 00:46:46,305
If it was like the past,
I would let it be your father's decision.

511
00:46:47,294 --> 00:46:50,300
But everything has changed now.

512
00:46:51,397 --> 00:46:54,630
I will be the one deciding things for you

513
00:46:54,912 --> 00:46:55,774
on my own.

514
00:46:57,880 --> 00:46:59,214
What do you mean by that?

515
00:47:00,771 --> 00:47:02,708
Do you still want to go study abroad?

516
00:47:06,826 --> 00:47:07,451
I do.

517
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,666
Then make preparations.

518
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:13,786
I will get everything in
order in three months.

519
00:47:17,748 --> 00:47:18,571
Really?

520
00:47:20,015 --> 00:47:20,754
Yes.

521
00:47:24,201 --> 00:47:25,748
Thank you so much.

522
00:47:29,443 --> 00:47:31,200
I love you so much.

523
00:47:33,120 --> 00:47:35,220
You're smiling from ear to ear!

524
00:47:37,055 --> 00:47:37,939
Thank you so much.

525
00:47:53,493 --> 00:47:54,057
Jom.

526
00:47:54,899 --> 00:47:55,683
Jom?

527
00:47:57,130 --> 00:47:58,043
Khun Yai.

528
00:47:58,533 --> 00:47:59,006
Wait.

529
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:01,053
Someone might see us.

530
00:48:01,150 --> 00:48:03,021
Is there something going on?

531
00:48:03,660 --> 00:48:04,697
I'm just happy.

532
00:48:06,231 --> 00:48:06,800
Happy?

533
00:48:07,911 --> 00:48:10,217
My dream is coming true.

534
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:13,035
What is that?

535
00:48:14,288 --> 00:48:15,555
I'm going to get to study again.

536
00:48:17,844 --> 00:48:18,937
Congratulations Khun Yai.

537
00:48:22,991 --> 00:48:23,604
So...

538
00:48:26,728 --> 00:48:28,337
When are you leaving?

539
00:48:29,208 --> 00:48:29,977
In three months.

540
00:48:42,540 --> 00:48:43,240
Jom.

541
00:48:48,488 --> 00:48:49,580
You look taken back.

542
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:52,000
Are you afraid of being lonely?

543
00:48:53,653 --> 00:48:54,444
That's not it.

544
00:49:06,293 --> 00:49:07,271
You've caught on to me.

545
00:49:08,506 --> 00:49:11,493
Of course I'd miss you.

546
00:49:14,582 --> 00:49:15,684
I'll be gone for only a few years.

547
00:49:17,146 --> 00:49:18,360
Please wait for me here.

548
00:49:22,364 --> 00:49:23,240
Um...

549
00:49:24,573 --> 00:49:29,684
I'm not sure about that.

550
00:49:31,863 --> 00:49:32,767
I'm not sure about that.

551
00:49:37,350 --> 00:49:41,462
In case my memory returns

552
00:49:42,102 --> 00:49:43,051
I have to return home.

553
00:49:44,524 --> 00:49:46,226
If you leave and won't return...

554
00:49:47,297 --> 00:49:49,222
where would I find another majordomo?

555
00:49:51,582 --> 00:49:52,795
Khun Yai.

556
00:49:53,924 --> 00:49:55,768
The work that I'm doing

557
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:58,391
is easily replaceable.

558
00:49:59,595 --> 00:50:00,973
There are many people

559
00:50:01,626 --> 00:50:04,200
who can read and write.

560
00:50:05,284 --> 00:50:06,128
I won't find someone.

561
00:50:07,871 --> 00:50:11,538
No one can replace my Jom.

562
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:24,927
But if

563
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:29,694
there is something that
makes me return from where I'm from

564
00:50:30,611 --> 00:50:34,820
with no choice

565
00:50:36,821 --> 00:50:38,143
and no clue if I can come back.

566
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,210
- Will you...
- Jom...

567
00:50:45,237 --> 00:50:46,223
What are you saying?

568
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:10,677
I'm just kidding.

569
00:51:11,877 --> 00:51:12,425
Don't overthink about it.

570
00:51:13,660 --> 00:51:16,458
It's not a funny joke.

571
00:51:18,825 --> 00:51:19,562
I know...

572
00:51:21,023 --> 00:51:21,637
I won't say anything anymore.

573
00:51:24,088 --> 00:51:26,324
You should go take a bath.

574
00:51:26,770 --> 00:51:28,412
I will prepare your bath for you.

575
00:51:28,884 --> 00:51:29,094
Hmm.

576
00:51:31,242 --> 00:51:32,833
It's getting late and there
will be a lot of mosquitoes.

577
00:51:38,791 --> 00:51:39,701
I'll just follow along.

578
00:52:11,402 --> 00:52:15,330
Khun Yai, stop staring at me.

579
00:52:15,945 --> 00:52:17,082
What is that?

580
00:52:17,663 --> 00:52:18,244
I can't.

581
00:52:19,642 --> 00:52:23,120
When you spoke of leaving,

582
00:52:23,968 --> 00:52:26,620
I have to look at you before you disappear.

583
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:29,510
Oh, I already said that

584
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:31,896
I was just kidding.

585
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,209
Jom, please lock the doors

586
00:52:36,281 --> 00:52:37,333
and all the windows too.

587
00:52:37,931 --> 00:52:39,550
I'm afraid you will sleepwalk away from me

588
00:52:39,622 --> 00:52:40,580
and disappear into another dimension.

589
00:52:40,580 --> 00:52:42,580
Oh my gosh.

590
00:52:45,340 --> 00:52:46,582
Just kidding.

591
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:48,868
Fine, I won't tease you anymore.

592
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:50,430
Keep rubbing it.

593
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:52,640
It's all sticky now.

594
00:52:53,638 --> 00:52:55,560
As for this arm... move closer.

595
00:52:58,270 --> 00:52:59,211
Rub some on my back for me.

596
00:53:02,133 --> 00:53:02,739
Umm.

597
00:53:04,910 --> 00:53:09,009
Oh, but your family

598
00:53:10,012 --> 00:53:11,981
moved from Bangkok?

599
00:53:15,507 --> 00:53:16,252
Bangkok?

600
00:53:19,175 --> 00:53:21,821
I meant Phranakorn.

601
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:24,400
Yes.

602
00:53:25,420 --> 00:53:28,418
My father had a lot of land there.

603
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:33,920
My mother also had land in
Thon Buri and Nakhon Pathom.

604
00:53:34,984 --> 00:53:35,956
Why are you asking?

605
00:53:37,827 --> 00:53:39,907
Oh, nothing.

606
00:53:40,512 --> 00:53:48,690
Well, are you thinking
of keeping it or selling it?

607
00:53:51,545 --> 00:53:52,920
I've never given it any thought.

608
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:58,000
Let me tell you something,

609
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:02,835
the land near Phranakorn

610
00:54:03,830 --> 00:54:07,540
you have to keep it for a long time

611
00:54:07,765 --> 00:54:09,080
because I believe that one day

612
00:54:09,080 --> 00:54:11,390
in the near future

613
00:54:11,980 --> 00:54:14,560
the land will be worth a fortune.

614
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:18,610
And you'll be a hundred and

615
00:54:18,610 --> 00:54:19,730
a thousand times richer

616
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:22,120
if you listen to my advice.

617
00:54:23,498 --> 00:54:23,989
Jom.

618
00:54:24,723 --> 00:54:27,341
Do you know what you sound like right now?

619
00:54:29,334 --> 00:54:29,723
What?

620
00:54:30,887 --> 00:54:34,992
It's like you're going
to look after my riches.

621
00:54:36,456 --> 00:54:38,320
Khun Yai.

622
00:54:38,503 --> 00:54:39,152
Yes?

623
00:54:40,202 --> 00:54:42,578
Don't make that voice.

624
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,360
I didn't mean it like that.

625
00:54:45,425 --> 00:54:48,070
I just wanted to know.

626
00:54:48,070 --> 00:54:49,500
It's you're family's land

627
00:54:49,500 --> 00:54:50,527
and it has nothing to do with me.

628
00:55:30,634 --> 00:55:31,466
Can you start rubbing the lotion?

629
00:55:31,472 --> 00:55:31,680
Oh.

630
00:55:31,848 --> 00:55:32,380
Oh.

631
00:55:33,890 --> 00:55:36,420
Oh, it's all a mess, Khun Yai.

632
00:55:37,484 --> 00:55:38,280
Are you teasing me?

633
00:55:38,280 --> 00:55:38,520
No.

634
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:38,980
I'm not teasing you.

635
00:55:38,980 --> 00:55:39,582
I'm not teasing.

636
00:55:39,735 --> 00:55:40,260
I wasn't teasing you.

637
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,850
I wasn't teasing you! No!

638
00:55:41,850 --> 00:55:43,480
- Hmm, come on.
- Khun Yai, no, the bed will be messy.

639
00:55:43,484 --> 00:55:44,296
Khun Yai, no, the bed will be messy.

640
00:55:44,296 --> 00:55:45,926
- No. No.
- Let's rub it together, Jom.

641
00:55:46,074 --> 00:55:46,960
I wasn't trying to tease you.

642
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:48,030
Aren't you teasing me, Jom?

643
00:55:48,743 --> 00:55:49,600
- Let's rub it together.
- It's a mess.

644
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:50,450
It's a mess.

645
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:51,600
Calm down.

646
00:55:52,998 --> 00:55:54,589
Where will you run to?

647
00:56:26,474 --> 00:56:26,918
Jom.

648
00:56:29,010 --> 00:56:29,854
This snack,

649
00:56:31,345 --> 00:56:32,420
did you bring it to me?

650
00:56:37,351 --> 00:56:38,240
I'm sorry, Khun Yai.

651
00:56:40,432 --> 00:56:41,271
I'm sorry, Khun Yai.

652
00:56:42,248 --> 00:56:43,445
Just seeing you full from my food

653
00:56:44,379 --> 00:56:45,580
it's like I also got to eat it.

654
00:56:52,394 --> 00:56:52,865
No.

655
00:56:55,182 --> 00:56:56,130
I'm not full yet.

656
00:56:58,447 --> 00:57:00,824
Do you want some more?

657
00:57:02,320 --> 00:57:02,920
No.

658
00:57:04,956 --> 00:57:06,580
I want to taste it

659
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:11,380
from the lips of the person I love.

660
00:57:36,229 --> 00:57:36,987
Hmm?

661
00:57:38,740 --> 00:57:41,099
I think I have to tell Maen

662
00:57:42,396 --> 00:57:45,136
that the snacks are too sweet.

663
00:57:48,056 --> 00:57:48,806
How sweet is it?

664
00:57:49,636 --> 00:57:50,653
So sweet.

665
00:57:53,726 --> 00:57:54,196
Ahem.

666
00:57:57,550 --> 00:57:59,583
Am I interrupting something?

667
00:58:00,830 --> 00:58:02,386
Are you very much so.

668
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:04,433
Right?

669
00:58:06,183 --> 00:58:08,810
What? He is not interrupting anything.

670
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,990
Are you here to see me?

671
00:58:15,845 --> 00:58:18,720
Yes, I need your advice on something.

672
00:58:20,090 --> 00:58:23,555
What is it?

673
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:29,360
Could you wait in the house?

674
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:33,860
When we're done, I'll
have Khun Yai go see you.

675
00:58:36,451 --> 00:58:38,658
Of course.

676
00:58:41,300 --> 00:58:43,860
I'll be with you after this.

677
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:18,555
Is there something wrong?

678
00:59:20,116 --> 00:59:22,996
Why are you making that face?

679
00:59:26,449 --> 00:59:28,301
Do you believe in mysteries

680
00:59:29,433 --> 00:59:32,295
or something that science can't explain?

681
00:59:34,344 --> 00:59:37,200
Do you remember Khun
Phra's promotion party?

682
00:59:37,384 --> 00:59:38,640
The one where I took photos.

683
00:59:39,772 --> 00:59:43,778
Was there anything unusual about it?

684
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:48,140
I have one thing that I want you to see.

685
00:59:56,473 --> 00:59:57,181
Whose picture is this?

686
00:59:58,178 --> 00:59:58,904
I can't see.

687
01:00:00,196 --> 01:00:02,040
If I came all the way here

688
01:00:02,689 --> 01:00:04,744
to show this picture to you.

689
01:00:05,981 --> 01:00:08,000
Who do you think is in the photo?

690
01:00:22,024 --> 01:00:23,156
You mean that

691
01:00:25,300 --> 01:00:26,820
the person in that picture is Jom.

692
01:00:28,689 --> 01:00:29,180
Jom.

693
01:00:30,080 --> 01:00:30,560
Huh?

694
01:00:40,153 --> 01:00:41,132
Huh?

695
01:00:42,276 --> 01:00:43,280
Why is it like this?

696
01:00:44,418 --> 01:00:47,620
Is there a problem with your camera?

697
01:00:47,932 --> 01:00:48,340
No.

698
01:00:49,218 --> 01:00:50,340
I've tested it on everything.

699
01:00:51,575 --> 01:00:53,300
But it's happened to only Jom.

700
01:01:22,781 --> 01:01:23,480
Jom.

701
01:01:29,975 --> 01:01:30,480
Jom.

702
01:01:31,833 --> 01:01:32,276
Jom.

703
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,006
What's wrong?

704
01:01:44,520 --> 01:01:45,020
Shadow...

705
01:01:46,018 --> 01:01:47,185
Khun Yai, my shadow.

706
01:02:03,280 --> 01:02:03,720
Jom.

707
01:02:19,555 --> 01:02:20,590
What if I told you

708
01:02:25,893 --> 01:02:26,986
that I'm not from this place.

709
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:32,180
But I came from the future.

710
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,380
Would you believe me?

711
01:02:49,175 --> 01:02:50,090
What are you talking about?

712
01:03:09,537 --> 01:03:11,022
I think this might be...

713
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,425
a sign.
