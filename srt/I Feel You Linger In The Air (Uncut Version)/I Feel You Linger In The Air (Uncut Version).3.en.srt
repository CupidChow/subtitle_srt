1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,793
(Previously)
Khun Yai,

2
00:00:00,793 --> 00:00:04,081
he is the son of Luang
Nititham and Khun Ying Kaekai.

3
00:00:04,081 --> 00:00:04,762
No.

4
00:00:04,762 --> 00:00:06,869
Go teach him how to work,

5
00:00:06,869 --> 00:00:08,052
and let him start tomorrow.

6
00:00:08,052 --> 00:00:10,001
Have you got a name, by the way?

7
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:10,882
It should be... Hope!

8
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:13,180
Why did you decide to join in?

9
00:00:13,180 --> 00:00:16,333
It's the blessing ceremony for the
foreign master and his second wife.

10
00:00:16,954 --> 00:00:18,482
It's like you've lost your blessing.

11
00:00:18,863 --> 00:00:22,175
May your blessing come back to you again.

12
00:00:22,175 --> 00:00:22,806
Hey.

13
00:00:23,944 --> 00:00:24,737
Ohm.

14
00:00:32,726 --> 00:00:33,624
Hey.

15
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,983
Khamsan.

16
00:00:43,111 --> 00:00:43,904
Fong Kaew.

17
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:45,988
Khamsan.

18
00:00:48,513 --> 00:00:49,359
Fong Kaew.

19
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:50,843
Fong Kaew.

20
00:01:01,235 --> 00:01:02,185
Ohm.

21
00:01:03,095 --> 00:01:03,993
Fong Kaew.

22
00:01:04,971 --> 00:01:06,971
How are you?

23
00:01:07,504 --> 00:01:09,504
I'm fine.

24
00:01:09,713 --> 00:01:11,713
You shouldn't have come here.

25
00:01:11,713 --> 00:01:13,261
It's very dangerous.

26
00:01:14,118 --> 00:01:15,646
I missed you.

27
00:01:16,367 --> 00:01:17,685
Fong Kaew.

28
00:01:18,542 --> 00:01:21,434
Why are you being so cruel to me?

29
00:01:21,884 --> 00:01:25,668
If Boon didn't send word that you
were bought to be the foreigner's wife,

30
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:28,532
I would never have
known that you'd be here.

31
00:01:30,647 --> 00:01:31,440
If...

32
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,155
If I told you,

33
00:01:33,997 --> 00:01:35,997
you'd stop me from doing it.

34
00:01:36,908 --> 00:01:38,751
I had to do it.

35
00:01:39,501 --> 00:01:41,501
The reason I came to live in this house,

36
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:43,898
is because I want a
comfortable life for my mother.

37
00:01:44,976 --> 00:01:47,186
After the store caught fire,

38
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,399
my family had nothing left to our name.

39
00:01:50,528 --> 00:01:52,161
You know that.

40
00:01:54,669 --> 00:01:56,669
Fong Kaew, I understand.

41
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,419
I understand everything.

42
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:01,451
But... now,

43
00:02:02,229 --> 00:02:04,334
You should run away with me.

44
00:02:11,856 --> 00:02:12,492
Go.

45
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,553
Fong Kaew!!

46
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:24,254
Right?

47
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,283
Go quickly!

48
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:28,953
Go on!

49
00:02:28,953 --> 00:02:30,253
I asked who is it?!

50
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:31,619
Leave with me now.

51
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,040
Who is it?!

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,949
You go, I can't leave.

53
00:02:35,265 --> 00:02:36,425
We'd be in big trouble.

54
00:02:36,425 --> 00:02:39,672
If you won't worry about
yourself then please think of me.

55
00:02:39,672 --> 00:02:40,603
Go! Go!

56
00:02:40,603 --> 00:02:41,678
Go!

57
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:44,083
Is that Fong Kaew?

58
00:02:45,714 --> 00:02:46,560
What?

59
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,424
Who is he?

60
00:02:47,558 --> 00:02:48,876
What is it?

61
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:49,783
Oh, it's you.

62
00:02:50,459 --> 00:02:51,095
What?

63
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,217
Fong Kaew? Is that really you?

64
00:02:52,594 --> 00:02:54,332
What are you doing out here so late?

65
00:02:54,332 --> 00:02:55,607
Why are you out here?

66
00:02:55,862 --> 00:03:00,000
- I was just taking in some fresh air
and taking in the view. - What's here?

67
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,718
Nothing.

68
00:03:01,718 --> 00:03:03,833
Where the hell did he go?

69
00:03:03,833 --> 00:03:05,345
What are you looking for?

70
00:03:05,345 --> 00:03:06,601
Is that a man?

71
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:08,520
There's no man there.

72
00:03:08,861 --> 00:03:10,284
There! In the boat!

73
00:03:10,284 --> 00:03:12,315
I can't see who it is.
What are you doing?

74
00:03:12,315 --> 00:03:13,259
Who is he?

75
00:03:13,477 --> 00:03:15,005
Hey, hey.

76
00:03:20,415 --> 00:03:21,365
Who's there?

77
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:24,160
Is that Jom?

78
00:03:24,292 --> 00:03:26,292
Jom! Stay there and don't go anywhere!

79
00:03:26,292 --> 00:03:28,646
Hey, don't go anywhere!

80
00:03:28,646 --> 00:03:30,338
Keep an eye on her and I'll...

81
00:03:30,338 --> 00:03:31,534
Jom?!

82
00:03:31,534 --> 00:03:33,644
- Argh, Auntie!
- Where are you running to?

83
00:03:34,115 --> 00:03:35,433
What?
Let go of me.

84
00:03:35,433 --> 00:03:37,656
Look, where did he go?

85
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,000
(I Feel You Linger in the Air)
(Episode 3)

86
00:04:53,289 --> 00:04:56,548
Are you sure that you saw a man?

87
00:04:56,964 --> 00:04:58,597
I'm sure.

88
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,960
I'm definitely not mistaken.

89
00:05:01,732 --> 00:05:04,677
Fong Kaew was going
to run away with her lover!

90
00:05:05,462 --> 00:05:06,622
That's not true.

91
00:05:07,287 --> 00:05:09,287
She's accusing me.

92
00:05:09,287 --> 00:05:11,257
I've just married into this
house for not over a day.

93
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,935
How could I do that to my master?

94
00:05:13,935 --> 00:05:15,038
You liar!

95
00:05:15,153 --> 00:05:17,153
Are you saying that I'm lying?!

96
00:05:17,242 --> 00:05:19,242
I'm just saying what I saw!

97
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:20,979
Well, you don't like me, don't you?

98
00:05:21,224 --> 00:05:22,909
Ever since I came here,

99
00:05:22,909 --> 00:05:26,415
you've been glaring at me,
you don't like me, don't you?

100
00:05:26,415 --> 00:05:28,313
What? So you're not going to tell
the truth and now you're talking back?

101
00:05:28,313 --> 00:05:29,650
Khamthip! Stop!

102
00:05:30,147 --> 00:05:33,144
Did you forget that Fong Kaew is my wife?

103
00:05:33,144 --> 00:05:34,633
And she is also your boss.

104
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:38,195
I'm sorry master.

105
00:05:41,902 --> 00:05:44,059
Are you sure that you saw a man?

106
00:05:44,749 --> 00:05:47,746
Go find evidence and a witness.

107
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Of course master.

108
00:05:58,792 --> 00:06:01,159
I have a witness.

109
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:04,267
Who?

110
00:06:06,063 --> 00:06:09,427
Jom, the new servant
of the House of Palathip.

111
00:06:10,163 --> 00:06:12,163
I saw him there.

112
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
So I made him keep an eye on...

113
00:06:17,536 --> 00:06:20,271
Miss Fong Kaew.

114
00:06:24,329 --> 00:06:27,221
Maey, go fetch Jom now.

115
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,463
Yes, master.

116
00:06:50,566 --> 00:06:51,149
Ming.

117
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,519
Ming.

118
00:06:53,525 --> 00:06:55,735
Jom, get up and look around.

119
00:06:56,943 --> 00:06:57,789
Ming.

120
00:06:57,952 --> 00:06:59,427
Hey, Jom.

121
00:07:04,238 --> 00:07:05,241
Ming.

122
00:07:05,749 --> 00:07:06,752
Maey.

123
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,012
Maey!

124
00:07:19,257 --> 00:07:20,000
Maey!

125
00:07:22,098 --> 00:07:24,413
Ming, come here.

126
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:46,665
What's going on?

127
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,528
Where's Jom?

128
00:07:50,189 --> 00:07:51,192
Where's Jom?

129
00:07:52,262 --> 00:07:53,580
Is he in the house?

130
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,416
Something big happened!

131
00:07:58,069 --> 00:07:59,387
What happened?

132
00:08:00,777 --> 00:08:02,147
Well, Jom...

133
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:13,644
Hey!

134
00:08:14,518 --> 00:08:15,888
Hey! Hey! Hey!

135
00:08:15,888 --> 00:08:16,812
Hey, let me go!

136
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,926
Help... Help... Help...

137
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:24,452
Quiet, quiet, quiet, I'm not
going to do anything to you.

138
00:08:25,239 --> 00:08:26,032
Be quiet.

139
00:08:37,694 --> 00:08:38,435
Ohm.

140
00:08:41,694 --> 00:08:43,117
Are you a servant of this house?

141
00:08:51,853 --> 00:08:52,646
Huh?

142
00:08:56,128 --> 00:08:57,498
Are you a servant of this house?

143
00:09:01,892 --> 00:09:05,256
And just now, it was you, right,
who secretly watched me at the pier?

144
00:09:09,395 --> 00:09:10,503
You've got the wrong person.

145
00:09:10,503 --> 00:09:11,807
It wasn't me.

146
00:09:11,807 --> 00:09:14,147
I'm not wrong, I saw
you hiding behind a tree.

147
00:09:18,173 --> 00:09:20,173
Come on, help Fong Kaew.

148
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,840
Don't tell anyone about what you've seen.

149
00:09:24,191 --> 00:09:26,191
Otherwise, Fong Kaew
will definitely be punished.

150
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,685
This has nothing to do with me, let me go.

151
00:09:31,685 --> 00:09:33,203
Wait, wait

152
00:09:33,203 --> 00:09:35,203
I don't want anything with... you either.

153
00:09:35,925 --> 00:09:37,080
Let me go.

154
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,480
Please, I beg of you.

155
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,200
Please.

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:44,120
Fong Kaew's life has already
encountered a lot of hardships.

157
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,000
Please.

158
00:09:59,006 --> 00:10:02,200
May you have sympathy for our love, please.

159
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,600
Jom.

160
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Jom.

161
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,600
Jom.

162
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,400
Jom.

163
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:39,400
Jom.

164
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,400
Where did you go?

165
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,000
I was looking all over for you.

166
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:49,400
Uh.. Nothing is going
on, I just couldn't sleep.

167
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,680
So I came out to walk
and think about things.

168
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:56,600
Damn, I really can't take my eyes off you.

169
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,400
Whenever I let my guard
down, there's always trouble!

170
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,000
What?

171
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,200
Master called you to go to the house.

172
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:08,000
Aunt Thip said she wants
you there as a witness

173
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,200
that you saw Fong Kaew secretly
having an affair, did you really see her?

174
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Well...

175
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,001
I...

176
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
This time, I can't help you.

177
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Go tell the master yourself.

178
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Go hurry!

179
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,600
What?!

180
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,200
Master has called for
you for a long time, quickly.

181
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,600
Damn, hurry up.

182
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Have you come already?

183
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,030
Master has already scolded us.

184
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,000
Oh.

185
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,400
Jom, go in first.

186
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:46,800
Aw, won't you go in with me?

187
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:49,480
Uh, you go first, I'll follow you.

188
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:50,800
Oh, Ming.

189
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:51,400
Jom.

190
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,000
Hurry up and go in.

191
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,000
Jom has arrived, master.

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,257
Where did you fetch him from?

193
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,682
Why were you so slow?

194
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,400
You can wait patiently
for a bit, what of it?

195
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,400
Weren't you expecting an answer anyway?

196
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,000
It's not their working hours anyway.

197
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:23,730
Lately you've been
opposing everything with me.

198
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:32,600
Master asked someone to fetch me
in the middle of the night like this.

199
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:34,800
Is there something wrong?

200
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,600
Kham Thip says

201
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,600
that you saw Fong Kaew secretly
having an affair at the pier.

202
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,600
So I want to ask you

203
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:46,000
whether you really saw it or not.

204
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:49,400
Tell the master.

205
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,200
You really are bad luck.

206
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:19,600
Wherever you go, everything goes to shit.

207
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:30,033
Why are you silent?

208
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,757
Aren't you fiesty?

209
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,290
Answer my question!

210
00:13:34,290 --> 00:13:35,280
Answer me.

211
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,000
Whether you really saw it or not.

212
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,035
Jom.

213
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,000
Tell him.

214
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:51,000
Did you see what I saw?

215
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:55,120
Fong Kaew was secretly having
an affair at the pier, tell him.

216
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,421
What's wrong with you?

217
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,534
Why won't you answer my question?

218
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,000
If so I will punish both of you.

219
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,520
What?

220
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,529
For wasting my time.

221
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,400
Well, hurry up and say it.

222
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,280
Or we will all be in trouble.

223
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,682
Say it!

224
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:18,200
Jom.

225
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,400
I can't seem to agree with you, Robert.

226
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,249
Yai? Why are you here?

227
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, this is a matter
related to my servants.

228
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:45,720
I had to come.

229
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,375
That's strange.

230
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,714
Before this, I had never
seen you interested in anyone.

231
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:56,400
Before, we didn't have any disputes
between these two houses.

232
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,221
But now it's different.

233
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:10,200
Well then, make him say,

234
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:14,369
whether he actually saw my wife
secretly having an affair at the pier.

235
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,303
So that I can let him go.

236
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,399
Well? Jom?

237
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,019
Did you see it or not?

238
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,678
I..

239
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,600
Speak according to the truth that you saw.

240
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:53,400
Jom!

241
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,400
Two years, I've been waiting for you.

242
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,200
Ohm.

243
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:03,200
I hope that you would find
someone better than me.

244
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,837
Yes, I saw them.

245
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,600
I saw that Fong Kaew was with a man.

246
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,200
See, I told you.

247
00:16:28,173 --> 00:16:31,267
You see, I'm not lying.

248
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,120
Who was it?

249
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,600
It's true.

250
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:40,400
I saw them hugging each other.

251
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:43,400
Crying at the lake.

252
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,520
Sympathizing with each other.

253
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,600
Right, Jom?

254
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:56,026
But... I don't know who he is.

255
00:16:56,026 --> 00:16:59,176
And I don't know if it was her lover.

256
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,577
I saw from afar.

257
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
That's all I know.

258
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,400
We're all done here.

259
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,213
I'm going to take my people back.

260
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Let's go Jom.

261
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:00,000
I, too, will have to take my leave.

262
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,670
Apparently it's none of my business.

263
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,600
Let's go, Maey.

264
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:08,239
Yes.

265
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:16,800
Go.

266
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,400
Please excuse me.

267
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,480
Fong Kaew!

268
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,521
Eeang Peung.

269
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,737
What will happen to Fong Kaew?

270
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:07,959
I pity her.

271
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:13,200
I don't know how Robert will punish her.

272
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:17,206
Don't think too much about it.

273
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,192
I am afraid.

274
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,680
I like it more when you
have a smile on your face.

275
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,902
But if you smile and it's tiring.

276
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,480
You don't have to force a smile.

277
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,424
I understand what you're feeling.

278
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,625
But don't overthink it.

279
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,286
Because when that day truly comes.

280
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,241
I believe that there will be a solution.

281
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:45,200
Let go of me!

282
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
That hurts!

283
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,280
Who do you think you are?

284
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,120
Doing this to me?

285
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,585
Marrying you

286
00:20:52,920 --> 00:20:55,845
means that I can't see anyone?

287
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,080
Don't change the subject!

288
00:20:58,080 --> 00:20:59,304
If you didn't do anything

289
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,922
then why did you lie to me?

290
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
If I told master

291
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,800
then would master believe me?

292
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,549
Would you let me see him?

293
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:13,600
Stop calling me that!

294
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:16,000
Remember that

295
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,622
I am your husband!

296
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,799
Don't call me like those
other lowly servants!

297
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:31,400
I forgot, you aren't really my wife yet.

298
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:35,551
Or...

299
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,375
Should I make you remember that.

300
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:41,120
I'm your husband now.

301
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,800
Let go of me!

302
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,151
Oh, now you're playing hard to get!

303
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,985
Acting all innocent and jumpy!

304
00:21:47,985 --> 00:21:49,200
But when you're out of sight

305
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,720
you present yourself to that low life thug!

306
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,790
Mr.Robert, please let go of me.

307
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,159
I'm beggin you.

308
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,280
Do you know that

309
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,680
the fact that I took you as my wife

310
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:02,080
I had to face the pitiful looks

311
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,830
from those foreign businessmen?

312
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,720
This is how I help you and your mother

313
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:11,120
and are you still going
to cause me trouble?!

314
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,200
Fong Kaew!

315
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,871
Let me go!

316
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,244
Let me go!

317
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,600
Please let me go!

318
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:28,523
Mr Robert let me go.

319
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,345
How was it?

320
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,000
It's all taken care of.

321
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:03,240
Jom, Robert didn't
do anything to you right?

322
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:05,680
I'm ok.

323
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:07,480
That's a relief.

324
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,520
I was on my toes outside.

325
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,216
I couldn't even go in.

326
00:23:11,216 --> 00:23:14,000
Mr. Robert might think that
I called Kun Yai to help ypu.

327
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,680
But it's good that you're fine.

328
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:18,200
Thank you Kun Yai

329
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,800
for helping Jom again.

330
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,917
It's ok Ming.

331
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,520
Jom is my people.

332
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:30,600
What's more, I gave my word to mother

333
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,000
that if anything happened to Jom.

334
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,120
I'd take on full responsibility.

335
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:40,218
But I'm afraid that

336
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,248
if Jom continues to reside here

337
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,400
it won't be a good thing.

338
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:50,039
Could you look after Jom a bit longer?

339
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,200
If I can find a solution

340
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,207
then we'll talk.

341
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,025
Of course Kun Yai.

342
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:02,270
Let's go to sleep

343
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,039
it's very late.

344
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,478
There's trouble everyday.

345
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:16,523
Should we go get drunk?

346
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,200
Huh?

347
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,000
Yai?

348
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:30,963
Oh, mother.

349
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,734
Why aren't you in bed yet?

350
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:34,714
Oh..

351
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:36,171
Prik told me that.

352
00:24:36,171 --> 00:24:38,200
Ming came to call you to that house

353
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,415
so I was worried.

354
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,806
It's nothing mother.

355
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:43,584
It was just a quarrel.

356
00:24:44,280 --> 00:24:46,621
Kham Thip was telling everyone

357
00:24:46,621 --> 00:24:49,234
that Fong Kaew, Mr.Robert's new wife

358
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,680
was having an affair.

359
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,566
And also said that Jom was involved.

360
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,697
Was that why you had to go over there?

361
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:58,800
Yes.

362
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:02,047
But it's nothing mother,

363
00:25:02,047 --> 00:25:03,080
you don't need to worry.

364
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,842
Ever since they let him stay,

365
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:10,287
that house has seen nothing but trouble.

366
00:25:10,893 --> 00:25:14,854
Many things aren't related to Jom.

367
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:17,028
Don't spread rumours.

368
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,920
Um.. Mother..

369
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,400
There's something about Jom that
I want to get your advice on.

370
00:25:51,899 --> 00:25:52,600
Ming!

371
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,941
Where are you taking me? What are we doing?

372
00:25:54,941 --> 00:25:57,080
Jom, keep your voice down

373
00:25:57,080 --> 00:25:58,376
or my mother will wake up.

374
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,200
Then why are we sneaking around?

375
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,080
Sit down.

376
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:14,509
Stop standing over my head.

377
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,250
I'm not.

378
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,200
What's this?

379
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,008
At this time, you've been
getting alot of trouble.

380
00:26:20,008 --> 00:26:21,120
Try it.

381
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,520
I marinated it myself.

382
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,057
No.

383
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:27,000
I don't want to have any of these things.

384
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,400
Jom, you act like you never drank.

385
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:34,006
The first time I met you,
the smell of alcohol was buzzing.

386
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,280
Come on.

387
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:41,880
Ming.

388
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,113
So, what will happen to Fong Kaew?

389
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:52,221
I don't know either.

390
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,811
Mr.Robert is a fierce man.

391
00:26:54,811 --> 00:26:56,672
Erratic.

392
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:57,800
And another thing

393
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,280
this matter is serious.

394
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,683
If it was me, he would hit me

395
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:05,400
and beaten until there
were lashes on my back.

396
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,800
Well, but Fong Kaew is a mistress.

397
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:14,510
Oh I don't know

398
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,950
I can't guess.

399
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,341
Jom.

400
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,200
The man you saw,

401
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:22,400
what did he look like?

402
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:26,546
May you see my love for it.

403
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,720
Good, then drink up.

404
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:39,193
It's good stuff.

405
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:46,337
So, Ming, how did you
come live with Mr.Robert?

406
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,840
Where can I go, dammit?

407
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:54,996
In the past, my master
was a lord in Lampang.

408
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:58,692
But when power was consolidated,
my master's power declined.

409
00:27:58,692 --> 00:28:01,891
Luckily, Mr.Robert came to the rescue.

410
00:28:01,891 --> 00:28:04,991
Therefore, my mother has
been serving him until today.

411
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,469
That's all to our life.

412
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:18,440
First thing is our masters, next is booze.

413
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:22,811
In the morning you have to wake up to
go to work, when it's dark, drink liquor.

414
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:25,623
To forget the difficult things.

415
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:28,569
Finally end up sleeping.

416
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,600
Sigh, life just goes on and on.

417
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,800
Come on Jom!

418
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:40,660
I'll pour it.

419
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,880
Good, drink up.

420
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,121
You really are an acoholic.

421
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,045
Give me your glass.

422
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,378
Let me tell you.

423
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:04,000
Last night.

424
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:07,615
I saw Fong Kaew

425
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:11,000
get dragged into the room by Mr.Robert.

426
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:14,400
After the doors closed,
there was the sound of ruckus.

427
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,996
I'm so happy!

428
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:19,720
Fong Kaew must have
been beaten up by Mr.Robert!

429
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,720
Really?

430
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,103
Of course!

431
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:24,776
I was the one who heard the noise!

432
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:27,018
Bang, bang, bang! Like that!

433
00:29:27,680 --> 00:29:30,840
You speak like you were
in the room with them.

434
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,543
He might have called for a massage.

435
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,880
You really like to make others look bad.

436
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,600
I'm your aunt!

437
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,671
Well, not by blood

438
00:29:39,671 --> 00:29:41,932
but I raised you all these
years not to talk back at me!

439
00:29:41,956 --> 00:29:43,800
Wait, please finish the story.

440
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,520
You should be interested like her!

441
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,401
Do you understand?

442
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,629
This morning Pun saw Fong Kaew

443
00:29:50,800 --> 00:29:54,000
she was washing clothes
for Mr. Robert by the river.

444
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,113
What do you think happened?

445
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,120
You're full right? I'll put it away.

446
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,720
No, I'm not full yet.

447
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:07,054
I'm so happy!

448
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:12,200
Jom? Why won't you eat?

449
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,054
Uh..

450
00:30:13,054 --> 00:30:14,088
Eat.

451
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:31,120
Jom?

452
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,160
Where are you going?

453
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:33,733
Jom!

454
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:35,520
Jom!

455
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,200
I..

456
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:25,719
I didn't think it would turn out this way.

457
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,031
I..

458
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:35,880
I..

459
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:37,366
I'm not blaming anyone.

460
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,993
It's karma for women like me.

461
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,600
Hope, what am I doing here?

462
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,400
Geez.

463
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:18,880
That's perfect.

464
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:22,097
Uh..

465
00:32:24,284 --> 00:32:25,433
Hope?

466
00:32:26,520 --> 00:32:27,320
Mr. James.

467
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:30,280
Who named the pig that? That's a cute name.

468
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,115
Does it mean aspiration?

469
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:39,600
I don't know what it means.

470
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,160
I just think the word sounds nice.

471
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:46,262
Hmm.. Interesting.

472
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:48,200
What is the owners name?

473
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:51,369
I forgot to ask you the last time we met.

474
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,328
Uh.. My name is Jom.

475
00:32:55,280 --> 00:32:57,794
But Hope is not my pig

476
00:32:57,794 --> 00:32:59,713
he's the master's pig.

477
00:32:59,800 --> 00:33:03,395
I was sent to train the pig.

478
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:08,724
Jom.. That's a nice name.

479
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,200
What does it mean?

480
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:17,138
Jom means a master in a topic of knowledge.

481
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,276
So Jom, can you tell me
some tricks for training Hope?

482
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,384
Of course.

483
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:27,200
I trained it with sound.

484
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:31,301
I use the bell to let him
learn when he hears the bell.

485
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:32,276
He will get food.

486
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:35,694
And when it hears the bell then
it will come running to me.

487
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:40,437
Someday, come and train my pig.

488
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:44,141
I would like to send some to compete.

489
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:47,800
Compete?

490
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,020
Yes.

491
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:51,408
At the Christmas party at the club.

492
00:33:51,408 --> 00:33:54,108
The foreign tradesmen
often go to celebrate.

493
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:59,615
Oh... and Mr. James raises pigs as well?

494
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:03,554
Not yet, but I want to

495
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,319
for next year.

496
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:08,800
Next year.

497
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,974
Jom, will you help me?

498
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:19,738
Help me, Jom.

499
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,430
Uh...

500
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
Jom.

501
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,200
Kun Yai.

502
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:35,508
Kun Yai, it's as if you
knew that I was coming.

503
00:34:36,193 --> 00:34:40,153
I was just... calling my people.

504
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:44,657
But what business do you have

505
00:34:44,657 --> 00:34:45,738
to be able to come here?

506
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:48,274
I'm here to see Mr. Robert

507
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:50,153
but I ran into Jom first.

508
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:58,231
Please excuse me.

509
00:34:58,600 --> 00:35:01,019
Please continue using
your people as you please.

510
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,769
See you soon Hope.

511
00:35:04,760 --> 00:35:06,070
[in English] See you soon, Jom.

512
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:22,280
Hope or...

513
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,619
Kun Yai, do you need something?

514
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:36,325
Are you free this afternoon?

515
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,479
I'm free.

516
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:41,403
Kun Yai, do you want me to do something?

517
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:44,000
Ming told me that

518
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,406
you were practicing rowing.

519
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,945
How is it going? Are you able to row yet?

520
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,241
I'm getting the hang of it.

521
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:55,205
Where do you want to go?

522
00:35:56,800 --> 00:36:00,662
Then can you take me to Kad Luang?

523
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:22,892
Why do you have that big
smile on your face, James?

524
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:29,192
Nothing.. Well, let's
just say I saw something.

525
00:36:29,713 --> 00:36:31,313
How have you been Robert?

526
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:35,560
I've been quite busy,
still looking for a pig for the race.

527
00:36:36,775 --> 00:36:42,867
Well, what about Christmas? The
people at the royal department of forests,

528
00:36:42,892 --> 00:36:44,560
they've been asking me about it.

529
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,520
And obviously, all the guys at the Gymkhana

530
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:53,040
have talking on and on about their little
pigs all day, it's making me rather annoyed.

531
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,552
I'm still looking for
someone to train my pig.

532
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:59,703
I really want to win the bet this time.

533
00:36:59,720 --> 00:37:01,693
I need more concession of the forest.

534
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,667
I want to shame them.

535
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,409
Well, Robert.. You know you don't
have to keep your secrets from me right?

536
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,958
I do know that you have a
very competent pig trainer.

537
00:37:17,966 --> 00:37:20,206
Who are you talking
about? I don't have any.

538
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,400
Well, Jom? The domestic
servant from Palathip house?

539
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:27,941
Jom?

540
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:51,408
Who are you buying a shirt for?

541
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:56,030
It's for you.

542
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,217
Me?

543
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,420
Why?

544
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,933
In case you need to go somewhere

545
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,921
so you have something new to wear.

546
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:09,734
Out of this house.

547
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,000
This one doesn't look bad.

548
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:29,480
What do you think?

549
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:31,607
Do you like it?

550
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:50,406
That's so cool!

551
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,944
Cool?

552
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,794
Uh.. I mean..

553
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,280
This one is really nice.

554
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:03,971
Oh..

555
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:07,297
If you like this one..

556
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:10,735
I'll take this one.

557
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:26,291
Uh.. Could you get the
shirt from the merchant?

558
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,336
And just take a walk around here first.

559
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:32,600
I need to buy some things for my mother.

560
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,000
Of course Kun Yai.

561
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,520
Are you the one who told them?

562
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:06,635
I thought you that we were both slaves

563
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,680
that you'd be more sympathetic.

564
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,482
You're really ruthless.

565
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:19,105
Do you know what Fong Kaew wrote
in the letter she wrote me?

566
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:22,425
Do you know?

567
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:28,090
Fong Kaew told me to forget her.

568
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:31,095
In this life, she's compelled
to be that bastard's wife.

569
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:33,562
Do you see what you've done?

570
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,400
This is what you did?!

571
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,249
Do you see?

572
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,568
Don't fight in my shop.

573
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:45,918
You get out!

574
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:48,400
I will kill you!

575
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,919
Die!!

576
00:40:58,800 --> 00:41:00,754
Why are you so selfish?

577
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,363
What else do you want from me?

578
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:06,893
Can you blame only me?

579
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,585
Well, it's because of all of us, isn't it?

580
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,720
When you asked for my help

581
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:22,977
for my sympathy.

582
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:25,821
Have you ever sympathized with me?

583
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:29,400
How will I feel?

584
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,200
Jom!

585
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,643
Kun Yai.

586
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:55,216
Kun Yai is...

587
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,564
I'm sorry.

588
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:05,240
In this life, if I and Fong
Kaew were not happy together.

589
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:07,400
Then don't expect that
you'll live happily ever after.

590
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:14,022
I said enough.

591
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,687
If you do anything to
me and my people again.

592
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,077
I won't stand for it.

593
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:26,880
Khamsaen, what the hell are you doing?

594
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,814
I apologize on behalf of my son.

595
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,993
When he's drunk, he likes
to argue with other people.

596
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:37,000
Don't mind him.

597
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,160
Saen! Let's go home!

598
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:46,587
Come back! Come!

599
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:12,000
Follow me!

600
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:12,960
Let go!

601
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,844
No!

602
00:43:13,844 --> 00:43:15,033
Mom, let go of me.

603
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,099
Where are you going?

604
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:18,200
Ow.

605
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:22,200
Do you know what you've done?!

606
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:25,120
Out drinking all night.

607
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:29,000
When I came back and had you
watch my things for a moment.

608
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:30,898
You went around looking
for trouble with him.

609
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,880
Do you know who he is?

610
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:36,074
It's whoever it is.

611
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,086
I don't care.

612
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:42,079
I'm interested in Fong Kaew, you know that.

613
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,280
Learn to know your place.

614
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:48,466
Fong Kaew is already
in a good place in life.

615
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,800
Now her mother is wealthy.

616
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:57,172
But now you have to help me with
my daily work to have food on the table.

617
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,000
Do you understand?

618
00:44:01,412 --> 00:44:02,986
I love her.

619
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:07,277
I love Fong Kaew, mom.

620
00:44:09,600 --> 00:44:10,680
I love her.

621
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,315
I know.

622
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:23,035
I've raised you since you were young,
why wouldn't I understand you?

623
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:26,289
But Fong Kaew

624
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,524
has gone on to live a good life.

625
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,958
You should let her go.

626
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:34,600
Saen.

627
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,196
What about me, mom?

628
00:44:47,971 --> 00:44:49,364
What about me?

629
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:50,454
Saen.

630
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:56,155
It's just the way life is.

631
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,329
Make peace with it.

632
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,642
Saen.

633
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:09,879
Make peace with it.

634
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,968
What did I do wrong?

635
00:45:17,960 --> 00:45:20,800
Forget her.

636
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,819
I love her with all my heart.

637
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:29,960
What's wrong with that?

638
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:50,847
Please may you have
sympathy for our love, please.

639
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:58,000
You are really bad luck! Wherever you go,
everything goes to shit.

640
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:00,460
I didn't think it'd be like this.

641
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,960
In this life, she's compelled
to be that bastard's wife.

642
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,600
This is what you did.

643
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:25,083
Let me.. Go home.

644
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:58,385
Please let me go home.

645
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,455
Please let me go home.

646
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:20,600
Jom.

647
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:27,056
Kun Yai.

648
00:47:28,040 --> 00:47:30,675
What are you doing?

649
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:38,000
I... have no clue.

650
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:42,654
Jom.

651
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,243
Do you want to sit with me?

652
00:48:18,952 --> 00:48:22,430
Are you thinking about
what happened this evening?

653
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,828
Ever since you came here.

654
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:33,630
I never asked you

655
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,205
how you are.

656
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:51,491
I'm... still trying to fit in.

657
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:59,637
Do you have a something
you want to tell me about Jom?

658
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,120
If not, that's fine, I understand.

659
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:17,520
Sometimes people have
stories that they can't tell anyone.

660
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:30,057
I'm just... confused.

661
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:37,891
I used to feel that way too.

662
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:47,978
And I always come
here when I feel like that.

663
00:49:51,600 --> 00:49:52,926
So..

664
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,535
Have you ever been like me?

665
00:49:58,406 --> 00:50:04,556
Feeling like you're in a
completely wrong place.

666
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:12,200
And I don't understand why

667
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:15,252
all the bad things
that're all happening now

668
00:50:18,600 --> 00:50:20,280
have to happen to me.

669
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:25,621
Even though I didn't feel
that I had done anything wrong

670
00:50:27,600 --> 00:50:28,960
but I don't understand.

671
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,373
Why do things like this
have to happen to me?

672
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:43,600
Did I do something wrong?
That I have to be here.

673
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:47,729
I do not understand.

674
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,213
Did what happened today

675
00:50:54,400 --> 00:51:00,409
make you miss where you came from?

676
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,320
If it makes you miss it

677
00:51:14,226 --> 00:51:16,007
and it makes you sick

678
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:18,926
then forget about it.

679
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:23,120
If remembering

680
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:27,073
makes you sad.

681
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:33,407
Just forget about it completely.

682
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,487
Let's start again.

683
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:43,807
Relax your heart.

684
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:01,685
Don't you love me anymore?

685
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:04,449
I still feel the same towards you.

686
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,011
I hope you find someone better than me.

687
00:52:08,040 --> 00:52:08,960
Ohm.

688
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:24,738
Kun Yai.

689
00:53:28,200 --> 00:53:28,879
Hmm?

690
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:32,540
Thank you.

691
00:53:36,600 --> 00:53:37,600
It's ok.

692
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:40,915
Go back to your house and get some rest.

693
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:47,987
During this time, everything may have
changed from what you're used to.

694
00:53:58,592 --> 00:53:59,374
Jom!

695
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:07,318
Yes?

696
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:18,520
May you be safe from misfortune,

697
00:54:21,800 --> 00:54:23,394
even in your dreams.

698
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,071
Good night.

699
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,847
I think you've lost your spirit.

700
00:55:37,840 --> 00:55:39,683
Let me help you bring it back.

701
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,203
I hope that your spirit

702
00:55:44,800 --> 00:55:46,486
comes back to you.

703
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,398
Ever since you came here

704
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:53,557
I've never asked you how you were.

705
00:55:54,200 --> 00:55:55,520
Do you like it?

706
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:33,450
It's good, right?

707
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,160
Eat lots.

708
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,040
Because I want you to know that

709
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,663
if from now on I can't be with you,

710
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:41,282
you might not get to eat
delicious food like this all the time.

711
00:56:41,600 --> 00:56:42,480
Eat up.

712
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:43,320
Come on, quickly.

713
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:48,128
Where is Hope?

714
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,812
Oh, Kun Yai.

715
00:56:58,200 --> 00:56:59,922
I just stopped by

716
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,091
to see if you're doing better.

717
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,493
But seeing you play with Hope

718
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,118
has really made me less worried.

719
00:57:18,400 --> 00:57:24,113
Uh.. So why did you say Por
Jom? Why did you call me that?

720
00:57:25,080 --> 00:57:28,342
I don't know

721
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,123
but it makes me feel at ease.

722
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:37,222
You don't like it?

723
00:57:39,200 --> 00:57:40,065
No.

724
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:42,384
You haven't answered me yet.

725
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,946
Where are you going?

726
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:05,400
I'm not sure yet

727
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:09,874
that everyone still
wants me to stay or not

728
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,163
with everthing that happened.

729
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,400
Why would you think like that?

730
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:23,120
Before this,

731
00:58:23,960 --> 00:58:26,143
you even said so yourself

732
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:29,181
that you don't want me to be here anymore.

733
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:36,400
But I'm afraid to let you to
continue to stay in this house.

734
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:38,242
It may not be a good thing.

735
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:45,046
I didn't mean it like that.

736
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:48,280
I meant that...

737
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,433
I was the one who brought you in.

738
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,235
Letting you live in Ming's home
which is that house's servant.

739
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:59,772
I see it as inappropriate..

740
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,840
Hope, were you the one who named it?

741
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:11,837
Yes.

742
00:59:12,800 --> 00:59:17,058
You know what it means...

743
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:32,319
This isn't the first time I've seen you

744
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:33,736
different from others.

745
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:38,228
Since the first time you met Mr. James

746
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:39,960
at my brother-in-law's house.

747
00:59:40,812 --> 00:59:44,754
I overheard you speaking in English.

748
00:59:49,272 --> 00:59:50,895
So I want you..

749
00:59:52,200 --> 00:59:53,784
to come stay with me as...

750
01:00:01,800 --> 01:00:03,214
my majordomo.

751
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,367
Can you do that?

752
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:16,600
A ma...jor...do...mo??

753
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:47,200
(Next Episode)
We're finally living in the same home.

754
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:49,289
It's ok, Auntie.

755
01:00:49,289 --> 01:00:50,040
I'm not hungry yet.

756
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:51,247
I'm not letting you eat it.

757
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:55,200
Staying at someone else's home,
you must know how to behave.

758
01:00:55,200 --> 01:00:57,800
And only focus on what
you have to do after this.

759
01:00:57,800 --> 01:00:58,905
Because if you can't

760
01:00:58,905 --> 01:01:01,040
his lord won't probably
won't let you stay here

761
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:02,562
and waste rice.

762
01:01:02,800 --> 01:01:04,235
How are you Jom?

763
01:01:04,413 --> 01:01:05,541
Can you do it?

764
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,120
Kun Yai.

765
01:01:07,320 --> 01:01:09,055
I'm very drunk.

766
01:01:09,213 --> 01:01:13,947
I'm not phased by liquor
but taken aback by love.
