1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,120
Need Not

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,840
Bye bye.

3
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:55,780
Father,

4
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:59,420
serve us this cup of wine.

5
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
After drinking this cup,

6
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,000
I will marry Ying.

7
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I will be your wife.

8
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Come.

9
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Commander, he's awake!

10
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
He's awake!

11
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
Come.

12
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Tie this bastard up.

13
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
General!

14
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
The man who is not poisoned,

15
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
is not clear.

16
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Come.

17
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Send him back to the room.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Master!

19
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
You...

20
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I never thought that

21
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,000
you would be so dangerous.

22
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Be careful!

23
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
General!

24
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Master!

25
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Why did you say that?

26
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Are you insane?

27
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Yes, Master!

28
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
General!

29
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
General, you can't do that.

30
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Take his soldiers away.

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
So that he can hurt himself.

32
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You two?

33
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
This is General!

34
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
General, be careful!

35
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
General!

36
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
General!

37
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Who dares to hurt General?

38
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Be careful!

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
You will be married soon.

40
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
And you will hurt my wife.

41
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Who is your wife?

42
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Stop it!

43
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
You're a traitor.

44
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You're a traitor.

45
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
You're a traitor.

46
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You're a traitor.

47
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
You're a traitor.

48
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Who dares to hurt General?

49
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
You're a traitor.

50
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're a traitor.

51
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Mr. Cui,

52
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
don't think that you can defeat me.

53
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
The Master of the World has said

54
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
that he's not a traitor.

55
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He's called Liu Chengfeng.

56
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He's called Mr. Cui.

57
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
That's right.

58
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
He's not pretending to be Mr. Cui.

59
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
But he's called Liu Chengfeng.

60
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Mr. Cui.

61
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Liu Chengfeng.

62
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Mr. Cui.

63
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
You're dead.

64
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
How dare you collude with the Master of the World?

65
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Are you trying to kill our family?

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Cui!

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Who is it?

68
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Why do you have to

69
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
say such a ridiculous thing?

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Let me ask you.

71
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Have you ever been sincere?

72
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
Have you ever been sincere?

73
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Have you ever been sincere?

74
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Have you ever really

75
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
treated me like your own son?

76
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
You're just using me.

77
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
What's the difference between

78
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
the blood and the blood of Cui and Jie?

79
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Fine.

80
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm not my son.

81
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
I'm just a daughter.

82
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Ying.

83
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
Your identity

84
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
is also hidden.

85
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Everyone.

86
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
This is my daughter.

87
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
What's going on?

88
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
She's the real Cui Lin.

89
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
She's the one

90
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
who has always been Cui Lin's identity.

91
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Even in the army,

92
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I've always treated her as my own son.

93
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Since she's now an enemy,

94
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
she doesn't want to be my son.

95
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Then I'm Cui Yi's only daughter.

96
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Cui Lin is my Cui Yi's only daughter.

97
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
But she's the only one

98
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
who has ever been sincere.

99
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Liu Cheng Feng.

100
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Since you've made a deal with me,

101
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,000
you've been treated like an enemy

102
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
and you're not loyal or filial.

103
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Now that you've lost your way,

104
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
you're still not going to stop fighting?

105
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,000
Do you think you can catch me today?

106
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
I'll kill you.

107
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
These swords have blue light.

108
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
I think it's poison.

109
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
Lin Ni.

110
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
You've been taken away by your identity.

111
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can't take the army to the capital.

112
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
You're the only ones who can catch me.

113
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Can you catch me?

114
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
I'm going to kill you, traitor.

115
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
Father.

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
General.

117
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
Are you all right?

118
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
I'm fine.

119
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't worry.

120
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
There's a real emperor outside the city.

121
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Today's battle

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
will be a double-dead battle.

123
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Let Liu Cheng Feng go.

124
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Get out.

125
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Go.

126
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Qi Lang.

127
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
You're surrounded by people.

128
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Liu Cheng Feng is leaving the city.

129
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You can meet him.

130
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Take care.

131
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Father.

132
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll call Tao Zi to clean up the pulse for you.

133
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
No need.

134
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'm fine.

135
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Tao Zi said

136
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
he'd better not move the antidote

137
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
if he did it himself.

138
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
But I couldn't bear to see

139
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the traitor's death.

140
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,000
He even colluded with me.

141
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm sorry.

142
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I'm sorry.

143
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
He knew that

144
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
our Cui family and the接hru

145
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,000
had a blood feud.

146
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
I don't know why he's like a mother now.

147
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,000
I've treated him

148
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
as my own son for so many years.

149
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,000
Father.

150
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,000
Don't be sad.

151
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
Ying.

152
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
We married for more than ten years.

153
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Although we wanted to avoid

154
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,000
the imperial court's suspension,

155
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I was a woman

156
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
and I was born a boy.

157
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
But we still have a selfish mind.

158
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Even if we leave

159
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
the Cui family to you,

160
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
it's just that

161
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
the world is precious to men.

162
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Without a daughter,

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
you can't have a family.

164
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,000
Especially in the military.

165
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
You're a man.

166
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
You can really

167
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
have everything in the Cui family.

168
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,000
I understand, Father.

169
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You know everything

170
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,000
from my understanding.

171
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
You told me

172
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
everything clearly.

173
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
It's my own choice.

174
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I don't feel sorry for it.

175
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,000
It's a pity.

176
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,000
Liu Chengfeng is good.

177
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,000
Cui Li is good.

178
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
If I can help you with everything,

179
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,000
it's just that it's not good.

180
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
It's a pity that I have a low heart.

181
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Even if I have a low heart,

182
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
I'll still show my ambition

183
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
at the end.

184
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Father.

185
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
You've done enough for me.

186
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,000
Ying.

187
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
I'm afraid that

188
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
you'll have more trouble

189
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,000
if you

190
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,000
reveal your identity today.

191
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
I know you'll never

192
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,000
be a man of your own.

193
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
But as a father,

194
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,000
I still feel sorry for you.

195
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
I'm afraid that I haven't taken good care of you.

196
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,000
I'll go to the underground

197
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
to see your mother.

198
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Father.

199
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Don't worry.

200
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
I'm your daughter.

201
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,000
No matter how much trouble

202
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
I have to face,

203
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,000
what can I do?

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Your daughter

205
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
will be the one

206
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
who will be the one who will be the king.

207
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
You're right.

208
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Now,

209
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
the time is different.

210
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Even if the troubles

211
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
in the world

212
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
are all in the past,

213
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
we, our parents and our children

214
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
will be the ones

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
who will be the one who will be the king.

216
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You're right.

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Don't worry, father.

218
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Greetings, General.

220
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
In the past,

221
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,000
the court had no son.

222
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,000
They had to give me a wife.

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
I was in a relationship with Zhuo Jing.

224
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
So after I had a daughter,

225
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I only had a son.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Later, the court changed the situation.

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
I kept

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,000
telling the truth

229
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
to the people.

230
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Actually, Cui Lin

231
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
is my only daughter.

232
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
So it is.

233
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,000
Miss,

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,000
you were in the army

235
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
and you were a member of the Hexiao Sect.

236
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
But what you did

237
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
was our own personal gain.

238
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:01,000
The state of Jin didn't let Xu Mei

239
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
to be our son.

240
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
I will definitely help you.

241
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Please, Your Highness.

242
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Don't worry.

243
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:17,000
I and General Pei

244
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
were ambushed outside the city

245
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:20,000
according to your instructions.

246
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,000
We met Liu Chengfeng

247
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
and took the prisoner.

248
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,000
We killed him

249
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
and couldn't take it.

250
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
But unfortunately,

251
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,000
their poison was too strong.

252
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Although they cut a lot of people,

253
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Liu Chengfeng's man

254
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,000
was still there.

255
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
This person has been heartbroken

256
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
and has been colluding with the enemy.

257
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
Please be careful

258
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
when you are poisoned.

259
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Yes.

260
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,000
Isn't that He Xiaowei?

261
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No.

262
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
Miss Cui's big sister is here.

263
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
Miss Cui, thank you for your hard work.

264
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
Thank you, Brother Bao.

265
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
We are all enemies

266
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
for Miss Cui.

267
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,000
We are happy

268
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
to be friends with the Zhexi Bureau.

269
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I will leave now.

270
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
You and Shi Qi Lang,

271
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
talk slowly.

272
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I'm so glad to see you.

273
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
We were friends

274
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
for Miss Cui.

275
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
We are happy

276
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
to be friends with the Zhexi Bureau.

277
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
I am also.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
You are so stubborn.

279
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Old Bao said

280
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
we killed many prisoners.

281
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
But Liu Chengfeng

282
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
still wants to escape.

283
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Liu Chengfeng colluded

284
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
with the prisoner.

285
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
We were so close

286
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
to the prisoner.

287
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,000
We were so devoted to the war.

288
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,800
I've been worried about him since I was a child.

289
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:46,080
He's not my brother.

290
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,680
He's the enemy of our Cui family.

291
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:52,840
Although I shouldn't,

292
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,280
I want to say

293
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,480
I feel comfortable hearing this.

294
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,600
You haven't told me

295
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,840
how you found out that my father was poisoned.

296
00:17:04,040 --> 00:17:05,040
How you found out

297
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,200
Liu Chengfeng's plan

298
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
and made a deal with my father.

299
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,640
After I returned to the camp,

300
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,720
I was worried about him.

301
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,040
I was worried about him.

302
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:16,040
So I went back to my mansion with Taozi

303
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,400
and asked him

304
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,680
what poison he was poisoned.

305
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,280
Erduo, clean up.

306
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,200
Don't let anyone find out.

307
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,960
I'm sure

308
00:17:42,440 --> 00:17:44,440
that General Taozi was poisoned by the poison.

309
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
You were poisoned by the poison, too.

310
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,440
You saw Liu Chengfeng at that time.

311
00:17:49,920 --> 00:17:50,960
So I suspect

312
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:53,840
that General Taozi was poisoned by him.

313
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,480
General Taozi didn't want to believe him.

314
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,000
Until then,

315
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,560
he found out it was him.

316
00:18:03,320 --> 00:18:04,080
Father,

317
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,480
I've been worried about you.

318
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:06,680
I've been worried about you.

319
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,680
I've been worried about you.

320
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:08,680
I've been worried about you.

321
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:09,680
I've been worried about you.

322
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,080
I'm really worried.

323
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,080
Your Majesty.

324
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:20,040
Don't mind.

325
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,760
Your Majesty, did you hear that?

326
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,760
Your Majesty, it's...

327
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,920
This Cuiyi

328
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,400
knows that he has a son.

329
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,000
What do you think?

330
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,160
This son is not his son.

331
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,720
Not his son?

332
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:34,520
Yes.

333
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,520
He has only a daughter.

334
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,720
He's been a boy since he was a kid.

335
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,600
His daughter is half-boy.

336
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,240
She's been in the Cui family.

337
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,680
I heard that she's quite famous.

338
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,640
Her name is...

339
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,200
He Xiaowei.

340
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:51,200
She's really famous.

341
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,720
But this Cuiyi

342
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,040
is obviously the wife of the emperor.

343
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
But the ministers in the court said

344
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,960
Cuiyi is a big man.

345
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,760
Plus, Sun Jing is not dead.

346
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,000
He's still in the same place.

347
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:11,960
Plus,

348
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,640
Cuiyi

349
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,720
has been in the court for a long time.

350
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:19,320
So the ministers in the court

351
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,440
have advised me

352
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:23,040
to take good care of Cuiyi.

353
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,840
But I was so anxious

354
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:30,120
that I came up with a good idea.

355
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,200
Your Majesty, you're thinking...

356
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,160
Cuiyi doesn't have a son.

357
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:39,360
I'll take care of him.

358
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:43,320
Then someone will be in the Cui family.

359
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,640
General Cui will be my son.

360
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,240
Your Majesty,

361
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,880
who wants to be in the Cui family?

362
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,840
So I'm here to find you.

363
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:02,200
I want to choose one of your nephew

364
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,920
and go to their Cui family.

365
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:07,080
Your Majesty,

366
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,880
I'm afraid it's not right.

367
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:10,920
What?

368
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:12,800
You don't want to?

369
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,640
I don't want to.

370
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,640
But I think

371
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,400
General Cuiyi is the general of Pingliang.

372
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:22,200
General Cui is the commander.

373
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:25,640
He was in the war.

374
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:28,840
I've heard about General Cui's name.

375
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:30,760
Such a person

376
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,800
is now in Changzhou and unwilling to retreat.

377
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,320
It's obvious that he's not in charge of the court.

378
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,000
His Majesty is kind-hearted.

379
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:42,960
He wants to be a minister for him.

380
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,720
I'm afraid he's just...

381
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,440
His Majesty wants to take over his Cui family.

382
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,400
He wants to be the military power of the Cui family.

383
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,280
I'm thinking the same.

384
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,000
Besides,

385
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,520
how can Cuiyi be the commander?

386
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,560
Cuiyi has been in the army for many years.

387
00:21:05,800 --> 00:21:07,640
He can give his daughter to his son

388
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,320
and give her a smart spiritual power.

389
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:12,720
Now, he's going to be the general of the palace.

390
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,800
How will he have the plan to be the governor?

391
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:19,600
How will he be the minister of the emperor?

392
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,600
What should we do?

393
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
I should

394
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,720
let Cuiyi's daughter be the minister of the emperor

395
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,120
and then let her be the princess.

396
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,680
After she becomes the princess,

397
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,920
I should find a obedient father for her.

398
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,160
Am I right?

399
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,840
I can use Cuiyi's military power.

400
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:51,000
Cuiyi is a man.

401
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,120
I'm afraid she's not a common person.

402
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:57,080
I'm afraid she doesn't want to be the princess.

403
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,080
Even the princess doesn't want to be the princess.

404
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:00,360
What does she want to do?

405
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,240
I just guess.

406
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,480
If His Majesty has a plan,

407
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
we should go to the person who is good at it

408
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:10,440
and check the Cui family's reputation.

409
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:13,760
Let's see if she wants to be the princess.

410
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,120
Father.

411
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:23,800
Sit down.

412
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,000
Let's cool off.

413
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:33,880
What?

414
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,960
Cuiyi principe

415
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,160
has returned to the imperial court.

416
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,480
Remaining a son, what does it mean?

417
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,360
There was a big happening inoly to the imperial court.

418
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,680
Cuiyi's son, Cui Ling.

419
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:48,040
So he's her daughter.

420
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:48,840
What?

421
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,720
Cuiyi was just a daughter.

422
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,320
but her biological daughter, He,

423
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,920
was also known in the Cui family.

424
00:22:57,280 --> 00:22:58,680
She was called He Xiao Wei.

425
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:02,680
So He Xiao Wei is Cui Yi's daughter.

426
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:05,360
No wonder...

427
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,800
Father, do you remember?

428
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,640
Prince Qin was in the Western capital before.

429
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:14,800
He met you in the dressing room.

430
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,720
He was He Xiao Wei by his side.

431
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,600
And that time we met,

432
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,040
he was also the one who made the plan for Prince Qin.

433
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,920
That little girl was so impulsive.

434
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,720
She was so impulsive that it made people think of her.

435
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,520
So she was Cui Yi's daughter.

436
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:36,800
Mother,

437
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:40,160
I know you always have a big brother.

438
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,240
But since Cui Lin is Cui Yi's daughter,

439
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,880
I'm afraid Prince Qin might be suspicious of her.

440
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:50,560
Father.

441
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,960
Can you help me?

442
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:56,880
You're such a clever daughter.

443
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,200
I will tend to protect you

444
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,920
while in your charge.

445
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:04,800
So what's Cui Yi's daughter like?

446
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,720
She's the general who 的切割重兵

447
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,120
is in charge of the war.

448
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,040
But her father is the leader of Wunchen.

449
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,160
Whenever I heard that

450
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,440
Her Lady would survey the border in flight,

451
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:24,600
Even so, I've never heard of your shrewd culture that will limit my craft power.

452
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:25,080
Joint!

453
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,280
You have his ankle with care.

454
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,360
I knew that mine will never群隊birth girl.

455
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:51,600
Who are you?

456
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:54,200
I'm the Master of Immortals Bureau.

457
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,240
How about I go and sevi to the head of it?

458
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:13,800
My mom

459
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,240
looks very beautiful today.

460
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,160
Since it's like this,

461
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,120
I'll just be honest

462
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:20,800
and show my true self.

463
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:23,480
As my father's daughter,

464
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:26,440
I'll make her proud.

465
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,080
Stand up and have a look.

466
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:32,880
You're so pretty.

467
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:34,360
You chose the right one.

468
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,440
I'm not your husband.

469
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,400
Your Highness,

470
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,760
I've met you.

471
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:41,720
Your Highness, what's the matter?

472
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,400
It's still a long story.

473
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,120
I want to meet you

474
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,480
and talk about Changzhou.

475
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,640
Prince Qin saved my life.

476
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,480
So,

477
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:54,640
I'm here to repay your kindness.

478
00:25:55,920 --> 00:25:56,440
You're welcome.

479
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:02,080
Who sent the letter to us?

480
00:26:02,920 --> 00:26:04,520
We're here to pay the price.

481
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,280
You won't forget, will you?

482
00:26:07,160 --> 00:26:08,520
General, you're a good man.

483
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm grateful to you.

484
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,200
But you're too close.

485
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:14,160
You're in Changzhou.

486
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:16,160
You're not going to be punished by the court.

487
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,640
You must be respectful.

488
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:18,880
Besides,

489
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,280
Changzhou and Luoyang

490
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,720
are related to each other.

491
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:24,320
They're from Pingliang and Yingzhou.

492
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:25,720
They're from the same place.

493
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,280
I'm afraid you'll be punished

494
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:29,920
if you're not here.

495
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,000
You don't want to say

496
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,720
that I'm useless

497
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:37,080
to you

498
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:38,720
because of the mountain rain in Changzhou.

499
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:39,680
General,

500
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,560
if you're going to

501
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,680
replace Luoyang and Changzhou with Weiyang,

502
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,160
as you said,

503
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,520
Weiyang is not my family.

504
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,000
But Weiyang is in Pingliang.

505
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,600
The people are mine.

506
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:55,520
I'm the general of Pingliang.

507
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:00,640
You're going to use my things

508
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:01,840
to replace mine.

509
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,680
You're going to use one and two?

510
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:06,160
You can't be too straightforward.

511
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,440
Weiyang is in Pingliang.

512
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,880
But there are soldiers in the imperial court.

513
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:12,800
If there's a decree from the imperial court,

514
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,360
the general will be in Pingliang

515
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:16,480
and Weiyang.

516
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,120
From now on, the general will be in the imperial court.

517
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,800
The general will be in Pingliang and Weiyang.

518
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,600
The imperial court will be in Pingliang.

519
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:27,400
How is the general?

520
00:27:38,840 --> 00:27:39,960
If so,

521
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,240
when the imperial court receives the decree from Wei and Authorities,

522
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,040
I would step out of Changzhou,

523
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:46,200
but Luoyang

524
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:49,440
needs no detainment from him.

525
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,760
That's too quick for you.

526
00:27:56,760 --> 00:27:58,760
There is a Ulinea of thick thorns42

527
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,000
and why does she be so mad at the imperial court?

528
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,360
It sanctions the imperial court.

529
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,680
Just for Changzhou's sake,

530
00:28:05,680 --> 00:28:07,080
I'll ask the court to send an order.

531
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
I'll only mention Changzhou

532
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,640
and not Luoyang.

533
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,200
Please don't worry, General.

534
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,240
Okay.

535
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,240
Your Highness,

536
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,600
Changzhou is a good place.

537
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:21,400
You can go back to the capital and pay the price.

538
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:22,880
I won't hide it from you, General.

539
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,280
Li Ni

540
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:25,960
has another request.

541
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:27,360
What is it?

542
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,400
I want to ask Miss Cui

543
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,320
to lead the Cui family

544
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,920
to join the government together

545
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:32,840
to eliminate Sun Jin.

546
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:37,280
Do you want my daughter to lead the army

547
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,040
to fight Sun Jin with you?

548
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:41,520
Your Highness,

549
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:45,120
you're too eager to fight for me.

550
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,840
Sun Jin is not alone.

551
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,040
Not only is the court's trust in him,

552
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,760
but also the general will be deeply in love with him.

553
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:53,720
The general was in the south of the army

554
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:54,840
with Prince Qin.

555
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,960
Now he's in Changzhou

556
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,880
and is in charge of the army.

557
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,080
It's hard to avoid the discussion in the court.

558
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,880
As long as the general agrees to join the army,

559
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,400
we'll be in the same boat.

560
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,560
We'll eliminate Sun Jin and take over the government.

561
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,360
The discussion in the court

562
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:10,240
will be organized in peace.

563
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:14,080
The people will be loyal to the general.

564
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,560
What if I don't agree?

565
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,480
After Li Ni takes over the government,

566
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
I'm afraid the court

567
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:22,560
will order Li Ni to fight with the general

568
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:23,640
and in the competition,

569
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,280
Li Ni will be in no position to push the bill.

570
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:29,480
And the court will

571
00:29:30,120 --> 00:29:31,480
take back the capital.

572
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:34,360
Prince Qin, you can try.

573
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:38,320
I've never met Prince Qin before.

574
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:40,560
I really want to see him.

575
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:43,280
Prince Qin is not worthy of the military.

576
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,080
I don't want to

577
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:46,720
fight with the general.

578
00:29:47,280 --> 00:29:48,760
General, you know very well.

579
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,120
The copper crown is for two gold coins.

580
00:29:51,320 --> 00:29:52,120
In addition to the copper crown,

581
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,480
two gold coins are no longer dangerous.

582
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,560
As long as the general agrees to join the army,

583
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,120
we'll be in the same boat together.

584
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,080
The court will definitely

585
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:01,120
take care of the general's decision.

586
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,680
I hope the general

587
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:05,000
can make it.

588
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Since that's the case,

589
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,920
I don't need my daughter to go with you.

590
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,200
I'll go with you to the copper crown.

591
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,320
Since that,

592
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
I discussed with Ying first.

593
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:25,560
She told me

594
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,280
the general will definitely say this.

595
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:29,840
I asked Ying how to do it.

596
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:31,640
Ying told me

597
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,480
that

598
00:30:33,960 --> 00:30:35,320
she's in a good business with me.

599
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,400
She's willing to sign with me.

600
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,440
Since you've discussed it,

601
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,800
why do you ask me?

602
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,280
So, the general agreed.

603
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Thank you, Uncle Cui.

604
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:49,160
Who's your uncle?

605
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,480
Get out!

606
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:53,440
Yes.

607
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:03,640
King of Qin is in密 aides,

608
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:05,560
but outside Changzhou,

609
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:08,160
the Prince of Zhenxi Gorge is still in seclusion.

610
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,960
He's the son of the emperor to Fengzhi,

611
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:13,580
and so, he's willing to trade him in disguise.

612
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,480
Ying.

613
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:19,360
There are so many men in this world.

614
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,480
Why do you have to look down at him too?

615
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,080
Father.

616
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:26,280
He was worthy of my famoso name,

617
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,560
so I just followed the Omar Emissary

618
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:28,800
and ordered him to go.

619
00:31:28,800 --> 00:31:29,640
Take the advantage.

620
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:30,600
Wait.

621
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:32,200
He deserves my opinion.

622
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:35,120
The situation is very bad.

623
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,560
Sun Jing and Sun Jing are still in the same place.

624
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:39,720
Three princes are fighting each other.

625
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:42,160
Prince Qin is highly skilled and skilled.

626
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,120
Although Prince Qin is not a genius,

627
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,840
he is not a good match.

628
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:49,480
Ying,

629
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,240
have you really thought it through?

630
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,240
You want to burn the soul water?

631
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,360
Father,

632
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
I like Li Ni.

633
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,160
He likes me too.

634
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,400
Although there are so many men in this world,

635
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:17,160
only one can be like my daughter.

636
00:32:26,400 --> 00:32:27,600
Father, only you,

637
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,320
only you,

638
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,840
if you think it through,

639
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:33,960
you have a decision.

640
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,240
I won't let you down.

641
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,040
Thank you, father.

642
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,720
Cheers.

643
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,440
Miss Wenwu is our general's daughter.

644
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:59,720
What kind of person

645
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,640
can you match with?

646
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,480
I think Prince Qin is good.

647
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:04,360
Think about it.

648
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,760
Since the time of the King of Qin,

649
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,160
Prince Qin has been the leader of the West Army.

650
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,320
He is a good match.

651
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,200
He can't play anything else.

652
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:10,760
He can't play anything else.

653
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:12,640
He is a handsome man who has never been in the army.

654
00:33:12,760 --> 00:33:13,720
Prince Qin is good,

655
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,520
but he is the emperor's son.

656
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:16,640
Our lady

657
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,800
should be a good match.

658
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:20,560
Yes, yes, yes.

659
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:21,600
Yes, yes, yes.

660
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,080
Do you hear that?

661
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:24,280
They all think

662
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,600
I can match with him.

663
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:27,560
I only heard them say

664
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,120
I want to be a good match.

665
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:30,920
Do you want to

666
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:32,760
be the emperor's son?

667
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:39,360
I don't care

668
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,160
if I want to be the emperor or not.

669
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:44,560
Aying,

670
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:46,560
let's go back to the old manor.

671
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,120
We will have a wedding there.

672
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,840
We will have seven or eight horses.

673
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,880
Half of them will be yours.

674
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:51,720
Half of them will be mine.

675
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:52,920
We will marry them.

676
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:53,800
We will get married.

677
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:54,560
Is that okay?

678
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,160
You are so beautiful.

679
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:58,240
Who wants to play with you?

680
00:33:59,000 --> 00:33:59,920
Then four.

681
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:01,360
At least four.

682
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:02,720
Two are in your surname.

683
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,680
Two are in my surname.

684
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,160
How about it?

685
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,280
If you talk nonsense again,

686
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,880
I will tear your mouth.

687
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,600
Tear my mouth?

688
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:09,840
Just tear it.

689
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:10,880
Just tear it.

690
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,200
No.

691
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:58,160
Don't be afraid, Your Highness.

692
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:27,160
I am okay.

693
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:27,760
Okay?

694
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,240
General Han.

695
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:38,600
So long.

I will be nice

699
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,080

700

followed you up to Huaiyang

702
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,680
for safety reasons.

703
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,840
Are you going to stop them today?

704
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:55,960
General Han,

705
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,360
I'll respect your loyalty.

706
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:00,800
As long as you hand over the Tai Sun,

707
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:02,640
I'll spare your life.

708
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,400
I'll protect the Tai Sun!

Let me go!

Li Xuanze, have you seen your uncle?

754
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,160
You're a rebel!

755
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
Shut up!

756
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,160
Don't scare the child.

757
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:24,160
General, you've been hiding for so long.

758
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,160
You're still holding back, aren't you?

759
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Even if you're loyal,

760
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,160
you'd still be able to live a life.

761
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
I'm afraid I'm not good enough.

762
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:45,160
I'm not good enough.

763
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
I'm sorry.

764
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:49,160
I'm sorry.

765
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm sorry.

766
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,160
I'm sorry.

767
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,160
Your Highness.

768
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,160
Did you send the letter to Prince Qin?

769
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:13,160
I sent it with the fastest speed.

770
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Don't worry, Your Highness.

771
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Prince Qin will surely find a way to save the grandchild.

772
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:19,160
Although he's a grandchild,

773
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I don't think he'll be too fast to save the grandchild.

774
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:25,160
I hope he can save the grandchild in time.

775
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
General Han also said that he's a rebel.

776
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
He'll find a way to save the grandchild.

777
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:31,160
The grandchild has his own world.

778
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
He'll be fine.

779
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
Your Majesty,

780
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,160
why did you send the letter to Prince Qin?

781
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,160
I asked him to go to Changzhou to settle the case.

782
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:44,160
He's a good man.

783
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,160
He must force me to go to the throne.

784
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,160
I thought that General Wei Yang

785
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,160
said that

786
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:55,160
he'd never mention the fact that he's a rebel.

787
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:58,160
That's the capital.

788
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:02,160
He's buying the court's grandchild.

789
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
He even sent the letter.

790
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,160
He even said that he'll settle the case in Changzhou.

791
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:10,160
He'll go to the throne with you.

792
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:14,160
You're so kind.

793
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:16,160
What if they

794
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:19,160
deal with Sun Jing and Li Ying?

795
00:42:19,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Your Majesty,

796
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:23,160
this is a decision made by the court.

797
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:26,160
Since Cui Yi has the power to settle Wei Yang,

798
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:30,160
why don't you give him the name Xu?

799
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:47,160
I heard that the court has sent a decree.

800
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:49,160
Prince Qin is in charge.

801
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I guessed that my father was going to scold me.

802
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:55,160
But I didn't realize that it would be so fast.

803
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:57,160
You're not a soldier.

804
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:59,160
You've settled the case in Changzhou,

805
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,160
but you've let out the risk of General Wei Yang.

806
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:03,160
You promised not to mention Luo Yang.

807
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:05,160
Isn't that the biggest problem?

808
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:07,160
You've given the court the enemy?

809
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,160
If I were you,

810
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,160
I'd also attack the royal family.

811
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:13,160
You'll attack the royal family too.

812
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:16,160
You're just a soldier.

813
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Most of the generals in the court

814
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:20,160
are from the Zhengxi Army.

815
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
They'll look at you.

816
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
Otherwise,

817
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:25,160
I'm afraid that it's not the end of the world.

818
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:27,160
It's the end of your love.

819
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:29,160
End of the world?

820
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,160
Anyway,

821
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:33,160
I'll be in trouble

822
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,160
after I settle the case.

823
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,160
I'll be there

824
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:39,160
to be the best in the court.

825
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
I'm afraid that if you kill the crown prince,

826
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:43,160
you won't be able to return to the Lan State.

827
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
That's not true.

828
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:49,160
Shi Qi Lang,

829
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,160
Consort Xiao sent a message to send people to report

830
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,160
that Sun Jing has captured the Grand Sun.

831
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,160
What?

832
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,160
Report!

833
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:00,160
The crown prince has been reported!

834
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:02,160
Sun Jing has sent a report to the Grand Sun

835
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,160
with the name of the Grand Sun.

836
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,160
The Grand Sun?

837
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,160
Yes.

838
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,160
Sun Cui found the Grand Sun.

839
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,160
He was responsible for it in the news.

840
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:11,160
Responsible?

841
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:13,160
Yes.

842
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:15,160
His Majesty is the emperor.

843
00:44:15,160 --> 00:44:16,160
He sent the Grand Sun

844
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:18,160
to the throne

845
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,160
to remove the throne.

846
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,160
Father,

847
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,160
since Sun Jing has been released,

848
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,160
he has been a former emperor.

849
00:44:29,160 --> 00:44:31,160
No one knows

850
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,160
who the Grand Sun is.

851
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:33,160
I think

852
00:44:33,160 --> 00:44:35,160
we should find a son

853
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,160
who can tell

854
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,160
who the Grand Sun is.

855
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:41,160
Your Highness,

856
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,160
since Sun Jing has been released,

857
00:44:44,160 --> 00:44:46,160
he can prove his identity.

858
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,160
If we find a fake one,

859
00:44:48,160 --> 00:44:49,160
wouldn't it be

860
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
that he is a fool

861
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:53,160
and can't be tried?

862
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:55,160
Does Sun Jing

863
00:44:55,160 --> 00:44:56,160
have any evidence

864
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,160
to prove his identity?

865
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,160
Sun Jing said in the news

866
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:01,160
that the Grand Sun is

867
00:45:01,160 --> 00:45:03,160
the one who took the throne.

868
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,160
Your Majesty,

869
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:10,160
Sun Jing

870
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:12,160
is the one who

871
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:14,160
took the throne.

872
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,160
He can tell who the Grand Sun is.

873
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
I think

874
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,160
no matter who the Grand Sun is,

875
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:21,160
the court should send troops

876
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:22,160
to kill Sun Jing

877
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:23,160
and take back the throne

878
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
and take back the Grand Sun.

879
00:45:25,160 --> 00:45:26,160
I think

880
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:28,160
Prince Qin has taken back the throne

881
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,160
and fought with Sun Jing many times.

882
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,160
There are also some people

883
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:33,160
who have the right to kill the Grand Sun.

884
00:45:33,160 --> 00:45:34,160
So, the court ordered

885
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Prince Qin to fight.

886
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,160
It's the best.

887
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,160
Then,

888
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,160
Prince Qin will lead the troops to fight

889
00:45:47,160 --> 00:45:48,160
and kill Sun Cui

890
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:50,160
to take back the throne.

891
00:45:51,160 --> 00:45:53,160
He loves to fight, right?

892
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:56,160
This time, he will fight enough.

893
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:58,160
Sun Jing is a good fighter.

894
00:45:58,160 --> 00:45:59,160
But it's just that

895
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:00,160
the Grand Sun has been released

896
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:01,160
for a long time.

897
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,160
His reign is not enough

898
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,160
for the Grand Sun.

899
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:05,160
Have you already set up

900
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,160
to enter the palace

901
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:07,160
as soon as possible?

902
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,160
How do you know that I have been planning?

903
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,160
The Grand Sun is a man of the palace.

904
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
But you used to

905
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:15,160
have a hard time

906
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:16,160
and fought with me.

907
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:17,160
Then,

908
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:18,160
the Zhanxi Army

909
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:19,160
stopped the Grand Sun for ten days.

910
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,160
With your personality,

911
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:21,160
you must have

912
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,160
been watching the outside world

913
00:46:22,160 --> 00:46:24,160
all over the world.

914
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,160
Yes.

915
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:27,160
I have made a secret

916
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:29,160
secret for myself in the Grand Sun.

917
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,160
Secret secret?

918
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:35,160
Is it the water pipe?

919
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:38,160
How did you guess it?

920
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:41,160
The copper pipe is made of copper,

921
00:46:41,160 --> 00:46:43,160
so it's hard to dig the ground.

922
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,160
So this secret pipe

923
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:46,160
shouldn't be newly built.

924
00:46:46,160 --> 00:46:47,160
It was originally used

925
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:48,160
by the descendants.

926
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:50,160
I remember that in the year of Rui Jing,

927
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:51,160
the copper pipe was once

928
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:52,160
exposed to the red,

929
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:54,160
and the five-core smoke was removed.

930
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,160
Then, the Ministry of Revenue

931
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:56,160
removed the silver and two.

932
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:58,160
The water pipe was re-built.

933
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,160
The rubber pipe was made

934
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,160
more deeply.

935
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,160
It should be able to move.

936
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,160
You know

937
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:04,160
what the Ministry of Revenue

938
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:05,160
has done in the years of Rui Jing.

939
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:07,160
When I was young,

940
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,160
I liked to read books with my father.

941
00:47:08,160 --> 00:47:09,160
In his study,

942
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,160
he published a book

943
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:11,160
called Ice Book.

944
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:12,160
He collected the books

945
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,160
that were popular all over the world

946
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:14,160
and were very popular.

947
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:16,160
I read it as a story.

948
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:17,160
I read it and wrote it down.

949
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:20,160
Then, tonight...

950
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:21,160
Tonight,

951
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,160
Prince Qin

952
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:23,160
will be the little housewife

953
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,160
of the water pipe.

954
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,160
Of course, I have to make a arrangement.

955
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:26,160
I'll wait for you

956
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,160
to test it out there.

957
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,160
I'll wait for you to test it out there.

958
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:07,160
That car is my boyfriend.

959
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:14,160
If I never had you in my life,

960
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
I would have missed you

961
00:48:16,160 --> 00:48:21,160
until the very first moment.

962
00:48:21,160 --> 00:48:22,160
I would have loved you

963
00:48:22,160 --> 00:48:26,160
for all my life.

964
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,160
I would have missed you

965
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,160
for all my life.

966
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:37,160
If I never had you in my life,

967
00:48:37,160 --> 00:48:40,160
I would have loved you

968
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:44,160
for all my life.

969
00:48:44,160 --> 00:48:46,160
I would have loved you

970
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:49,160
for all my life.

971
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:51,160
I would have loved you

972
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,160
for all my life.

973
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:04,160
If I never had you in my life,

974
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,160
I would have loved you

975
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:11,160
for all my life.

976
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:15,160
I would have loved you

977
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:20,160
for all my life.

978
00:49:21,160 --> 00:49:25,160
If I never had you in my life,

979
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:27,160
I would have missed you

980
00:49:27,160 --> 00:49:30,160
for all my life.

981
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:33,160
I would have loved you

982
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:39,160
for all my life.

983
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:46,160
I would have waited for you to come back to me.
