The sky is full of wind and wind

Episode 1

12
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,760
Yun!

13
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:12,680
Zui Li, why did you take me?

14
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,800
You colluded with the foreign thief and the Zheng Xi Army.

15
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,800
What?

16
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:18,800
Aren't you guilty?

17
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,040
Where's the evidence?

18
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,640
This is the secret letter from the Zheng Xi Army.

19
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,960
You secretly reported the Zheng Xi Army

20
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,760
when the Ying Zhou was under the command of the foreign thief.

21
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,920
The letter is clearly written on it.

22
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,920
How did you get this letter?

23
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,040
What?

24
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,800
You admit it?

25
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,440
The evidence is like a mountain.

26
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,160
If it wasn't for you,

27
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,680
Luo Yang City would have no need to give it to the Zheng Xi Army.

28
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,680
Take it!

29
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,360
Stop!

30
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:58,640
Master, you're finally back.

31
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,640
What happened?

32
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,640
The report from the army.

33
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,640
Li Jun and Li Lan have been sent to the army.

34
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,640
They are in a coma.

35
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,640
It seems that Sun Jing has already withdrawn

36
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,640
the soldiers who have been under my brotherly command.

37
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:15,640
The two of my brothers are indeed not in the same team.

38
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,640
What are you doing?

39
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,640
Lin, you're just fine.

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,640
I've already suspected that

41
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,640
the secret letter from He Xiaowei and the Zheng Xi Army

42
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,640
is the one who leaked many of our military records.

43
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:38,640
This is the evidence.

44
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:43,640
It's He Xiaowei who leaked the secret letter

45
00:03:43,640 --> 00:03:45,640
that we had been under the command of the Ying Zhou.

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,640
We have to fight for it in Luo Yang City.

47
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:50,640
If He Xiaowei doesn't die,

48
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,640
how can we be against it?

49
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:55,640
Those soldiers who have been under the command of the bloodthirsty.

50
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,640
Lin, I know you're soft-hearted.

51
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,640
I'll take care of this matter for you.

52
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,640
Don't worry.

53
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Come on!

54
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:07,640
Stop!

55
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,640
Sui Li, this letter was stolen by Taozi.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:18,640
The Prince also knows about this.

57
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:22,640
He Xiaowei found a move in the army recently.

58
00:04:22,640 --> 00:04:24,640
After this incident was reported to me,

59
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,640
he deliberately wrote this letter as a bait.

60
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:33,640
Just to see who would be hurt.

61
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:39,640
You're trying to frame me?

62
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:41,640
Now I'm in the house.

63
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,640
If you didn't steal the letter from the people who had been under the command of the bloodthirsty,

64
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,640
I wouldn't have been able to kill you.

65
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:50,640
Why would you do that?

66
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,640
Lin, I did this because

67
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,640
he was so suspicious.

68
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,640
I just wanted to help you.

69
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:02,640
You have to believe me.

70
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:03,640
I did this for...

71
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,640
The army of Cui family was led by the commander.

72
00:05:05,640 --> 00:05:07,640
The soldiers were all over the place.

73
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,640
The army was so strict.

74
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:13,640
There was never a time when we were all fighting.

75
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,640
Cui Li,

76
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,640
how many times have you been fighting with your comrades?

77
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:21,640
Do you think your actions and thoughts

78
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:24,640
really didn't affect you?

79
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,640
To fight with your comrades?

80
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:29,640
How do you deal with the army of Cui family?

81
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,640
To fight with your comrades?

82
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:33,640
To take the military power?

83
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,640
To kill the three-time emperor?

84
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,640
Cui Li, the commander of the army of the army of Cui family,

85
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,640
was killed by the commander.

86
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:43,640
He was killed by you.

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:45,640
He was killed by the commander.

88
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,640
Lin, go!

89
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:57,640
This time,

90
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,640
Cui Li took back the military power.

91
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:02,640
I think he can't make any trouble now.

92
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,640
Sir.

93
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:10,640
Are you okay?

94
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,640
Did you stand outside for a long time and get cold?

95
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:14,640
I'm Tao Zi Lan.

96
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll give you a hand.

97
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,640
Ying,

98
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:20,640
you went to the river today.

99
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,640
Where did you go?

100
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,640
I went to see Lin Yi.

101
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,640
Lin Yi is the commander of the army of the army of Cui family.

102
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:33,640
You shouldn't have gone to see him

103
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,640
all the time.

104
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,640
I know.

105
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,640
I'm telling you these things, you don't like to hear it.

106
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
But just like what you see today,

107
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,640
we set up a trap and waited for the snake to move.

108
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,640
You went out on your own.

109
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,640
Cui Li stopped you in advance.

110
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:52,640
What if he really did it?

111
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,640
Sir, don't worry.

112
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,640
Just a Cui Li can't do anything to me.

113
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,640
Ying,

114
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
I know you have a brother.

115
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
But there's no eye for a sword.

116
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,640
If you really get hurt,

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,640
you can let me rest assured.

118
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,640
Sir, hurry up.

119
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,640
Drink some tea first.

120
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:22,640
Drink it.

121
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,640
Is it better?

122
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:35,640
Ying,

123
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,640
do you know that

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:41,640
in fact,

125
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,640
you are more important to me

126
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:46,640
than anything else.

127
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:50,640
Even,

128
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
even more important than myself.

129
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:04,640
You and I grew up together.

130
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:07,640
I always regard you as my brother.

131
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:09,640
So,

132
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:13,640
you are more important to me.

133
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:21,640
Yes.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,640
We are brothers and sisters.

135
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,640
These words

136
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:31,640
are

137
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:34,640
a big deal.

138
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:39,640
The doctor told me

139
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,640
to let you rest well.

140
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,640
I won't bother you.

141
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,640
Have a good rest.

142
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:48,640
Okay.

143
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Allち明日

144
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:20,640
Xu Bicheng and Li Laoyang

145
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:21,640
will lead the army to survive tomorrow.

146
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:22,940
They are both

147
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,640
loyalty garments.

148
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,640
All Berdas

149
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,640
ix suddenly line up.

150
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,660
Since the Emirati are already here,

151
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:35,660
let's go.

152
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,840
Send Luoyang City to them.

153
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,840
Send Luoyang City to them?

154
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:53,360
The insightful 對啊 and Jiaju

155
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,680
What can the same

156
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,260
He even has a plan for revenge!

157
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
No trace was given to him?

158
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,520
The body maiden is quite present in a matter of minutes.

159
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:11,120
I know you want to test the chance.

160
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,320
I hope that

161
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,840
you find out how I badly mis threats him.

162
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,280
Comrade.

163
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,600
Comrade Xiyan did head Shan Aofji asked us

164
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,520
to back out the second half of the moves with his army.

165
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,960
He will fight for us with both W microf Rights and heicheng Censury.

166
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,200
There is only one base here.

167
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,960
We can finally hunt one more winter'sé in Bastion PSY.

168
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,720
would have chired the brave bike

169
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,840
and forced theaboration into new problems

170
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,080
for us.

171
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,360
That's great.

172
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,600
As long as all of us

173
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,040
produce our closely with each other,

174
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,160
no attack, no retreat, no arm,

175
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,120
and no rest.

176
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,020
chyong,

177
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,440
I thought

178
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:49,920
you cared so much for them.

179
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,760
Now it seems

180
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,200
you get so angry.

181
00:10:54,860 --> 00:10:56,960
I am also thinking for my (* present*) brothers.

182
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
They are so happy.

183
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,960
They can easily be chosen.

184
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:03,960
Why don't you let them stay in Luoyang?

185
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:05,960
In case they get into any trouble again,

186
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:08,960
I'll try my best to save them.

187
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Sir, you're awake.

188
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Where's He Xiaowan?

189
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
She was in her camp last night.

190
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:38,960
She didn't go out.

191
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:46,960
Sir, the doctor has checked with you.

192
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,960
She said you've been in a coma for two times.

193
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:51,960
You should be more careful and careful.

194
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,960
I know you still can't let He Xiaowan go.

195
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
But she'll understand sooner or later.

196
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,960
The best person in this world is you, Sir.

197
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,960
She's so smart.

198
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,960
I'm good to her.

199
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:15,960
She can feel it.

200
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Sir, you should be more careful.

201
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,960
Xiaowan isn't a person who's unwell.

202
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,960
You saved her yesterday.

203
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:25,960
She'll be touched by it.

204
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,960
But I want her.

205
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,960
She's never touched or hugged me.

206
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:41,960
Third Brother, stop drinking.

207
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:42,960
You're not well.

208
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:45,960
You'll be in a coma.

209
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,960
You're so drunk.

210
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:53,960
Why did you lie to me?

211
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:56,960
You forced me to give you the military blood.

212
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,960
It seems they've already been suspicious of me.

213
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:09,960
I'm afraid I can't do anything else.

214
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,960
Third Brother, we just received a secret report.

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:16,960
He's been sent to the He's Department.

216
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,960
Is Cui Lin in?

217
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,960
He's sent to He's Department directly.

218
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,960
The chief is not aware of it.

219
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:27,960
Are we going to send someone to investigate this time?

220
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,960
After what happened yesterday,

221
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:31,960
He's Department might be released.

222
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,960
We don't know what we can investigate.

223
00:13:36,960 --> 00:13:38,960
As long as Cui Lin is still here,

224
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:42,960
it's not a good idea to investigate He's Department.

225
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
But if we can investigate the intelligence,

226
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:49,960
it's a good idea.

227
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,960
Yes.

228
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:57,960
We'll investigate the secret report.

229
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:01,960
We can't reveal any clues.

230
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
There's nothing to do.

231
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:05,960
The court will personally hold a meeting.

232
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:08,960
Royal Descendant will be the first to take the picture.

233
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
Can you give me a jade seal?

234
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:14,960
To make Royal Descendant aware of it.

235
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:18,960
You're not going to return the letter?

236
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,960
Why are you in such a hurry?

237
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,960
I...

238
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,960
I'm not in a hurry.

239
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:27,960
This letter is not for me.

240
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,960
You're not in a hurry.

241
00:14:30,960 --> 00:14:32,960
I'll go and take care of the documents.

242
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:33,960
Go and take a rest.

243
00:14:33,960 --> 00:14:35,960
I don't need to stay with you.

244
00:14:35,960 --> 00:14:37,960
I'm not in a hurry.

245
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,960
But the letter from Song Xin.

246
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,960
She's in a hurry.

247
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,960
She's in a hurry.

248
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:45,960
Such a handsome man.

249
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,960
She's gone back early.

250
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
You don't know.

251
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,960
That man is a dead man.

252
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,960
If you don't return the letter and don't tell him,

253
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
he'll be waiting outside.

254
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Xiao Wei.

255
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:04,960
I'll tell him.

256
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:06,960
I'm going.

257
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:08,960
I'm leaving.

258
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:09,960
Wait.

259
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,960
Since you're in a hurry,

260
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,960
I'll return the letter.

261
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:18,960
I can't let Miss Taozi run away.

262
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:20,960
Okay.

263
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:21,960
I'll wait.

264
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:25,960
Xiao Wei.

265
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:26,960
The rear report.

266
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:28,960
The Zhenxu Army has retreated from Luoyang.

267
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Lord Liang's eldest son, Lin Zi, is in the capital.

268
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:31,960
He's going to the capital.

269
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:32,960
It's tonight.

270
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Lord Liang's son,

271
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:34,960
will be in the capital soon.

272
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,960
He's going to be in the capital.

273
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
I see.

274
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
I didn't expect that

275
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
Lord Li's brother

276
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,960
is really generous.

277
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
He just said yes.

278
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:49,960
But Xiao Wei.

279
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
After he left Luoyang,

280
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:52,960
where will he go?

281
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:54,960
Did he say it in his heart?

282
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,960
Of course, he won't say those words.

283
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,960
If he doesn't say those words,

284
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:02,960
what do you know about it?

285
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
Just a joke.

286
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:12,960
Let's go.

287
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:14,960
Go.

288
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:23,960
Miss Taozi.

289
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:25,960
This is the letter

290
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:26,960
that Xiao Wei will return to Royal Descendant.

291
00:16:27,960 --> 00:16:28,960
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

292
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm going now.

293
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:32,960
You're leaving now?

294
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:35,960
What if I don't?

295
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,960
What?

296
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:40,960
What did you say?

297
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:42,960
This is the gold-plated medicine

298
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,960
that I made myself.

299
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:46,960
I can't buy it outside.

300
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
I think when you're in a fight,

301
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,960
you'll be in a fight.

302
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,960
You'll be sure to get it.

303
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

304
00:16:58,960 --> 00:16:59,960
You're so nice.

305
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:01,960
What did you say?

306
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
I'm leaving.

307
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:04,960
Thank you.

308
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,960
Silly girl.

309
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
Last night, the rain stopped.

310
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,960
The moon was bright and the blood was blood.

311
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
I remember that you were in the stars.

312
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:29,960
I was in the dark.

313
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
I was in the dry valley with the bamboo shoot.

314
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,960
The smell was so good.

315
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,960
The feet were like a broken dragon.

316
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,960
It was so long.

317
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:38,960
It was so good.

318
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:51,960
The dry valley and the national mansion

319
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:52,960
are really good.

320
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,960
The people in the dry valley and the national mansion

321
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,960
are often together.

322
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,960
They're interesting.

323
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:31,960
The flowers I want to say will become my dream.

324
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,960
One by one.

325
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,960
The moon and the water were so beautiful.

326
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,960
I went to the village and saw the wild boar.

327
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,960
The scent of the wine and the bamboo shoot were so good.

328
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,960
It was so good.

329
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,960
I was so lucky.

330
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:53,960
I was so lucky.

331
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,960
I hope we can be together again.

332
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:21,960
Xiaowei.

333
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,960
Xiaowei.

334
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:26,960
I've been looking for you for a long time.

335
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,960
I'm here.

336
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:28,960
What's wrong?

337
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:32,960
Nothing.

338
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:33,960
I just want to ask you.

339
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,960
Do you want to go back today?

340
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,960
Are you afraid of that Xie Chang'er?

341
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:40,960
No.

342
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:42,960
I've made an appointment with him.

343
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:43,960
You're in Luoyang.

344
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:45,960
You're in the city of Hu Xiang.

345
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:48,960
You're in Luoyang?

346
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:51,960
It's your idea.

347
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,960
Is this your idea or Xie Chang'er's idea?

348
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,960
That's his idea.

349
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,960
He asked me to meet him in Luoyang

350
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,960
so that he wouldn't have trouble meeting him in the army.

351
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,960
Xie Chang'er is a messenger between the two armies.

352
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,960
As long as he remembers the time he's reached,

353
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,960
and calculates the speed of the horse's skin.

354
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,960
It's easy to figure out where the Xie army is.

355
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,960
This Li Huang is so cunning.

356
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,960
Xiao Wei, it's you.

357
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,960
You can guess the tricks and tricks of him.

358
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:29,960
So you're saying I'm cunning too?

359
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:30,960
No.

360
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:31,960
You're a smart girl.

361
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:35,960
Then, do you want to write a reply?

362
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:39,960
I don't know.

363
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,960
How could I not know?

364
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:44,960
Write a reply?

365
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:45,960
I don't know.

366
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:46,960
Write a reply?

367
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,960
Write a reply?

368
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:48,960
Write one.

369
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:50,960
Someone's in.

370
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,960
Fatty, let's go.

371
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
Let's take a walk.

372
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
Xiao Wei, let's not go in

373
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
and bet on the spy.

374
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
It's okay.

375
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I just want to find out the spy

376
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,960
because I'm a close friend of Li Ni.

377
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,960
Since they're already on the hook,

378
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
and they're making a fool of themselves,

379
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
let them do it.

380
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
Salong.

381
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,960
This is Li Ni's letter to He Shi.

382
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I've figured out the way.

383
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,960
I secretly wrote a letter to him.

384
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,960
The nut and the fruit are made of stone.

385
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,960
The flavor is really rich.

386
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:31,960
It's often made of stone.

387
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:35,960
What's this?

388
00:21:35,960 --> 00:21:37,960
According to my opinion,

389
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,960
Li Ni and He Shi are both from the deep-sea.

390
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,960
This letter is so fair and square.

391
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,960
He used the word secret to hide the secret.

392
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,960
So He Shi

393
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,960
is the one who hid the secret.

394
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:50,960
He's so generous

395
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,960
and not afraid of being seen.

396
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,960
One of these

397
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,960
must be the secret they've agreed to.

398
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:00,960
That's reasonable.

399
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,960
Then let's find someone

400
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,960
to break the secret.

401
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:06,960
Of course.

402
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:08,960
I'm different.

403
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,960
Although I've been with you for years,

404
00:22:13,960 --> 00:22:15,960
I've been thinking about this for a long time.

405
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,960
I'm really thankful.

406
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:30,960
Sometimes,

407
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,960
the water is so beautiful.

408
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,960
It's not the fish's but the fish's.

409
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:37,960
After the fire,

410
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,960
there's a fire.

411
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,960
It's dangerous because

412
00:22:49,960 --> 00:22:52,960
I haven't come to拱 The Trust yet.

413
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:53,960
What are you doing?

414
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,960
We'd better keep pretending to behave this way.

415
00:22:56,960 --> 00:23:00,960
We should not even help each other.

416
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,960
He Shi is the one who hid the secret.

417
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:06,960
If our props can be broken,

418
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,960
you wouldn't even pay for your mistake.

419
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,960
If Li Ni and He Shi Vitamin

420
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
is vice spoke of,

421
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:19,640
This time, he left Luo Yang

422
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:21,600
and he must also want to use this move.

423
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,680
That makes sense.

424
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,440
Continue.

425
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,600
Third Master, please look.

426
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:30,040
This letter was received by He Shi.

427
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,520
It is not a stone.

428
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,920
It is in the water.

429
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:34,000
It is not a paper.

430
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,640
The target is in the lake.

431
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,960
The stone is separated.

432
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,760
It is not a paper.

433
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,520
It is just a paper.

434
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:43,120
Then the target of the lake is...

435
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
Our army is not a trick today.

436
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:46,520
After the lake,

437
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:49,240
it is now on the lake side.

438
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,560
If there is no accident,

439
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,960
there will be a stone today.

440
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,320
Then the army of Zhen Xi will send people to He Shi

441
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:56,480
to lead the army to attack us.

442
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:57,640
Third Master,

443
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,840
why don't we

444
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:01,400
tell the commander about this matter now?

445
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,280
Then we will come to the capital

446
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,760
and as long as we have defeated the army of Zhen Xi,

447
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:07,880
it is a great honor.

448
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:11,040
Yes.

449
00:24:11,040 --> 00:24:13,080
You are a great honor.

450
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,480
Third Master Xindo, I ask you.

451
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,680
Now no one knows

452
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,480
that he is in the same position as the Mongols.

453
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,800
How can he attack us separately?

454
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:24,520
Well...

455
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:26,880
Now that something has passed,

456
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,800
where is his rational person?

457
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:30,360
Speak.

458
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,360
Third Master, Third Master.

459
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,280
Go away.

460
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,000
Get out.

461
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,080
Get out.

462
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:35,800
Yes.

463
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:38,240
Commander Su.

464
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:40,120
Where did you get this?

465
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,920
Cui Li has sent people to listen to He Xiao Wei.

466
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,840
He secretly leaked his letter.

467
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,560
I got the copy from Cui Li.

468
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:47,760
But he found out

469
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,520
what Cui Li did.

470
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,520
He didn't find out.

471
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,600
Third Master, don't be angry.

472
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:01,560
I suddenly thought of an important thing.

473
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,680
Last time He Shi

474
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:05,320
designed us with the letter.

475
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:07,320
Now I remember

476
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:10,280
that it was a coincidence.

477
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,720
I was wondering

478
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:14,440
why you went to see Pei Yuan.

479
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
You mean

480
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,440
after Pei Yuan met me,

481
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,960
you told me what happened.

482
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,400
The two of them

483
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,640
colluded with the design to attack us.

484
00:25:27,640 --> 00:25:30,160
To kill Cui Li,

485
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:31,760
you and I

486
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,600
should be the same.

487
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,320
I want the royal grandson's handbook

488
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:41,440
to see if I can kill Cui Li.

489
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:45,400
It seems that Li Ni and He Shi are close.

490
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:46,440
If not,

491
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:47,640
how can we tell him

492
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:49,760
such a secret?

493
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:52,960
I thought

494
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
at least we should kill He Shi.

495
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,440
Now it seems

496
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,760
he won't help us

497
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:01,280
and will be our enemy.

498
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,040
Don't worry.

499
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,920
Now the leader is Luoyang.

500
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:06,920
He is Li Ni's brother,

501
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:09,040
Li Jun and Li Lai.

502
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,960
They are always close to Li Ni.

503
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:14,480
Why don't we join them?

504
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,200
In this way,

505
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,920
we can get rid of the problem of military power.

506
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:24,160
Wonderful.

507
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,920
The world is full of chess and chess.

508
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,480
It's hard to defend.

509
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,560
Li Ni's army fought hard for six days.

510
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,520
The match with Peiyuan is finally over.

511
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,440
We finally get to break the rule.

512
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,800
Congratulations, Your Highness.

513
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:44,680
After these troops

514
00:26:44,680 --> 00:26:46,360
get to the capital,

515
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,080
we will rule together.

516
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,800
We rule together?

517
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,000
Then the Xi Changjing is not far away.

518
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:57,880
Yes.

519
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,440
The Xi Changjing is not far away.

520
00:27:04,560 --> 00:27:07,320
Li Ni didn't fight with his brother.

521
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:09,960
He gave up on Luoyang.

522
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:13,720
Qiqi of Wu Baili is strong and unruly.

523
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,680
Dai Zhu is a good son.

524
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,520
This Lord Liang

525
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,880
has a good son.

526
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,560
Well,

527
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:25,320
the three sons of Lord Liang

528
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,840
are now in the capital.

529
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,760
He has been a father

530
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,320
and a brother in the capital for a long time.

531
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:35,240
You should write a letter to your son.

532
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:38,240
Sit.

533
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:43,800
Master Shiqing, how is the war?

534
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:44,800
Sit.

535
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,480
The army is in the capital.

536
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,800
Don't chase after the poor.

537
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:49,800
What about you?

538
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,800
How is it?

539
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,800
My skin is damaged.

540
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,880
Good.

541
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,720
We've been working for a long time.

542
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,720
Finally, we can break the rule.

543
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:02,560
I heard my father said

544
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,600
the commander is the first to be called.

545
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:06,960
He has been in the army for a hundred years.

546
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,200
He can be a guest.

547
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,720
In the future,

548
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:11,240
we can also leave a letter

549
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:13,360
to the general of the imperial court.

550
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,720
Now that the palace is in the hands of the emperor,

551
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,720
how should you protect the commander

552
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,720
in the future?

553
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,880
Shiqing,

554
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,200
in this world,

555
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,880
there is no second commander.

556
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,600
There is no second commander.

557
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:31,800
Then there is no second

558
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,600
commander in the world?

559
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,480
Don't say that.

560
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:36,840
But Shiqing,

561
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,240
there is a problem.

562
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:39,800
You know it well.

563
00:28:39,800 --> 00:28:41,600
Why do you still write a letter to the king of the palace

564
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,600
and the king of the capital?

565
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,600
Let them drink the western capital together.

566
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,280
My brothers

567
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:50,840
are like the dead donkey in my father's coffin.

568
00:28:50,840 --> 00:28:52,360
You want to go west,

569
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,360
they will go east.

570
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,240
I don't want them to take the credit

571
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:57,960
for their success

572
00:28:58,040 --> 00:28:59,920
and the failure of the army.

573
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,000
Of course, I want to ask them

574
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,400
for their approval.

575
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,680
In this way, they will not listen to me.

576
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,320
Although I just heard the sound of the sound,

577
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:07,800
I can't move.

578
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:09,960
So this paper cave is fine.

579
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,800
It's fine to turn the tide.

580
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:12,680
older brother

581
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:23,480
How can this letter

582
00:29:23,480 --> 00:29:24,920
say

583
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,920
Watch yourself

584
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,200
只是你拿下了同官

585
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:34,440
People of our kingdom

586
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:35,160
Are all together

587
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,720
same as the Western capital

588
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:38,920
but gonna fall into a trap

589
00:29:39,180 --> 00:29:40,560
along the way

590
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:43,100
We came here to see you,

591
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,680
but...

592
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:48,840
you raised us like some floating semicir cabinets.

593
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,440
So you had to go to Zh heads' body bar

594
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,680
to see Mr. Zhang and redo my surge of power.

595
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:54,640
Brother,

596
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,960
ering to the artificial dads' ground

597
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:00,920
in these dark fads

598
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,520
is not just a matter terms,

599
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:04,240
the person who will create us

600
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,220
will have to do our respective duties eventually!

601
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,160
I knew Li Ni had a plan.

602
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,000
I couldn't let her

603
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,720
lose her mind.

604
00:30:23,640 --> 00:30:24,480
Brother,

605
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,000
Cui Li sent a secret envoy

606
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,400
to come here two days ago.

607
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:30,560
You mean?

608
00:30:31,360 --> 00:30:32,080
Brother,

609
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:35,320
I think we can take the army to Cui Li.

610
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,880
Because Cui Li wants to kill Cui Ling

611
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,160
and marry Li Ni.

612
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:40,320
If we give Li Ni the order,

613
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,800
she will definitely be

614
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,000
a sword in the hands of my brother.

615
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,080
Young Master.

616
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,600
You're back.

617
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,760
Thank you for your hard work.

618
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,080
How is your recovery?

619
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:54,480
Everything is fine.

620
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,320
But I heard that you came here

621
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,520
and you were very busy.

622
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,520
I'll take the order back

623
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:01,360
and give it to you.

624
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:05,640
Great.

625
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,160
With this order,

626
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:09,120
we can let Cui Li return to Ying Zhou.

627
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:11,240
Don't worry about her being born outside the palace.

628
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
Cui Ling

629
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,640
has taken the order of Uncle

630
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,920
to return to Ying Zhou

631
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,560
as soon as she's ordered.

632
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:17,800
She can't follow the army.

633
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,560
Great.

634
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,720
Cui Ling is so impatient.

635
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,160
She wants to take the order.

636
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,400
Calm down.

637
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:32,080
Luo Yang is back.

638
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,320
Why don't you look at the letter first?

639
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,320
Positive.

640
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,000
This will make it appropriate for you to return at the right time.

641
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:43,840
You can go back now.

642
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:46,440
Thank you.

643
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,360
Through the word,

644
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,840
you can succeed when you die.

645
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:55,280
Once I have some respect for you,

646
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,360
congratulations, General.

647
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:03,800
General Cui.

648
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,760
As long as Cui Lin dies,

649
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,520
my commander, Cui Jiajun,

650
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:11,920
will grow up in success.

651
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,240
By then,

652
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:14,840
I'll put everything

653
00:32:14,840 --> 00:32:16,280
in Li Ni's hands.

654
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,360
I'll kill both of them.

655
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,240
Heaven and earth will be free.

656
00:32:32,440 --> 00:32:34,360
No wonder you're so hard-working.

657
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,960
Look at the wall.

658
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:38,160
Look at the mountains and rivers.

659
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,120
It's really a blessing.

660
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,760
It's a blessing.

661
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,480
When the war is over,

662
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,520
when the workers are on the road,

663
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,720
they'll know that the mountains and rivers are good.

664
00:32:49,400 --> 00:32:50,200
No.

665
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,640
If the old man has half of the money,

666
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:54,680
we don't need so many people to guard it.

667
00:32:55,080 --> 00:32:58,480
ashing

668
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:03,680
Is there a new person here?

669
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:07,800
Shiqing.

670
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,480
You may be

671
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,000
wearing sickle.

672
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:19,740
Report!

673
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,680
New闇 will arrive at new city.

674
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:50,400
Only Grass's

675
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,240
Wait a minute hold my hand

676
00:33:54,040 --> 00:33:55,420
If I want my order to disbelieve

677
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,420
What if I disobey the order?

678
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:58,340
If I disobey my order

679
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:01,020
After 30 days

680
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:03,740
I will prepare the気man's talisman

681
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,300
It will be N potion to death

682
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,060
Who knows my father

683
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:09,020
Worth the wait

684
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,220
You knocked N official over

685
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,040
Did you send him to hospital

686
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:13,140
Tell my brothers

687
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:15,400
Yes

688
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,220
Don't you know

689
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,540
Compared with the two brothers,

690
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:22,820
who would be more careful?

691
00:34:31,420 --> 00:34:32,140
Xiao Wei,

692
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:33,980
you haven't finished the dried fruit, right?

693
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:37,660
The food was very popular in the capital.

694
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,020
Everyone praised it for its delicious taste.

695
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:40,700
There are many people who bought it in the countryside.

696
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:43,900
You can remember these details.

697
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,140
Xiao Wei?

698
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:51,260
We would eat just the dried fruit with the whelk.

699
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:58,660
Xiao Wei

700
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:02,740
loves to eat with him and the humble man.

701
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,100
Am I that old?

702
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:05,700
Besides,

703
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,340
fruits are really filling.

704
00:35:08,620 --> 00:35:11,620
But even for couples,

705
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,620
togetherness never changes, right?

706
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:15,420
I'll just tell you the truth.

707
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:22,860
Probably something happened in the middle of the world.

708
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,580
He didn't write it down.

709
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,020
Xiaowei.

710
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:29,820
Who is he?

711
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,780
Who is he?

712
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:36,820
Who is he?

713
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:38,460
Who is he?

714
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:40,940
He's a dried fruit.

715
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,700
He's not even on the bed.

716
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,420
I'm not going to say anything.

717
00:35:48,300 --> 00:35:49,100
Who is he?

718
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:57,580
Senior.

719
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:58,900
Luoyang reported that

720
00:35:59,180 --> 00:36:00,500
Prince Lin and Prince Kuiji

721
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,620
have decided to withdraw from Luoyang.

722
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:04,740
My two brothers

723
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,500
have been fighting since they were little.

724
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:08,300
It's not my fault

725
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:09,980
that my father always loved them.

726
00:36:10,860 --> 00:36:11,620
Luoyang was the advantage

727
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,740
that they had in your hands.

728
00:36:13,900 --> 00:36:15,060
Of course, he wouldn't have.

729
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:16,620
But now,

730
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:18,260
we're going to withdraw from Luoyang.

731
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,860
We can't let go of the same government.

732
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:22,420
If Luoyang loses,

733
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,820
our army will be destroyed.

734
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,300
But that Sun Jing

735
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,740
is really ruthless.

736
00:36:26,860 --> 00:36:28,180
If we don't withdraw,

737
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,220
he will really do something to Prince Liang.

738
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:32,820
What should we do, Senior?

739
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,940
Senior.

740
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:40,300
I'll ask the emperor

741
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,300
to be the best in the court.

742
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,860
If we don't withdraw,

743
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:45,660
Prince Liang will really hurt Sun Jing.

744
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,580
He will surely

745
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,660
cause a disaster to the court.

746
00:36:48,140 --> 00:36:48,900
Those old people

747
00:36:48,900 --> 00:36:49,900
and Prince Qi

748
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,340
will leave us.

749
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:54,780
Senior.

750
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,900
What should we do now?

751
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,500
Miss, you can't go.

752
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,460
If you go,

753
00:37:00,460 --> 00:37:01,660
you'll be sent to death.

754
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:02,740
Qiu Cui,

755
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,340
don't stop me.

756
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,420
I have to

757
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,260
love my parents.

758
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,740
It's dangerous to die in the hospital.

759
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:13,700
If Royal Descendant of the Royal Descendant

760
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,060
is killed,

761
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,540
I'm afraid I'll lose my life.

762
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,580
When he saved me,

763
00:37:19,860 --> 00:37:21,540
he was like a god.

764
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:24,100
I thought about it.

765
00:37:24,620 --> 00:37:26,580
Maybe he's the one I should be.

766
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,460
To repay him,

767
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,620
even if I'm broken,

768
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:32,420
Miss,

769
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,460
you've been suffering since you were little.

770
00:37:35,140 --> 00:37:36,980
If you really die because of this,

771
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:38,460
I'm afraid you won't even

772
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:40,060
have a real heart.

773
00:37:41,140 --> 00:37:42,100
Miss,

774
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,660
I want to live with you

775
00:37:43,660 --> 00:37:45,220
and return to the Western City.

776
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,580
Royal Descendant Li is now in Luoyang.

777
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,660
He's in the same place.

778
00:37:50,060 --> 00:37:51,220
He's as evil as a broken pearl.

779
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,260
Obviously, he's not a loyal person.

780
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,580
There must be a storm

781
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,380
in the future.

782
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:59,380
Royal Descendant is a loyal person.

783
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:00,900
If he's in danger,

784
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:02,020
he'll be in danger.

785
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,780
Royal Descendant will definitely

786
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,100
protect the people.

787
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:09,260
If I can help him at this moment,

788
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,780
I'll ask him to stay in the house

789
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,020
and not to chase him.

790
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:13,700
It's more suitable

791
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,740
for me to stay here.

792
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:17,820
Miss,

793
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,580
why do you suddenly

794
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:22,220
look like a changed person?

795
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:25,860
You used to be so stubborn.

796
00:38:26,460 --> 00:38:28,020
Sometimes, you're so weak.

797
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,140
You don't need me to help you.

798
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:32,820
Qiu Cui,

799
00:38:33,700 --> 00:38:35,220
I used to be so stubborn

800
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:37,580
because I didn't have the strength

801
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,220
to fight for it.

802
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:40,900
Why did you have to

803
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,220
fight for it?

804
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:48,820
You'll be my new father in the future.

805
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,780
You should learn to look at it more

806
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:51,860
and think more.

807
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,900
When should you give up?

808
00:38:54,860 --> 00:38:56,620
This is the way to be a smart person.

809
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,020
Greetings, General.

810
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:11,660
Greetings, General.

811
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,100
Miss Gu, you're so polite.

812
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,860
I have a secret request

813
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:21,340
to discuss with you.

814
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,860
Miss Gu, please say it.

815
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:30,460
I heard that

816
00:39:30,580 --> 00:39:31,540
the imperial family of the capital

817
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,340
has helped General Xiaopo.

818
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:35,220
I'm willing to go to Changjing

819
00:39:35,220 --> 00:39:36,740
to take you to the court

820
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,220
to save His Highness.

821
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:42,100
Why did you give me this?

822
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,340
For all the safety of the old people

823
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:47,020
and the country,

824
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:49,900
Grandson Flipass he's too big

825
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,700
and least scope- wollte to take.

826
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:52,420
Please carefrew me, General.

827
00:39:52,620 --> 00:40:04,580
After I'm back home,

828
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,740
if the goldness and reputation ofron

829
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,900
and takevantagé

830
00:40:07,940 --> 00:40:08,540
influence Great Qin

831
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:09,380
maybe Lord Liang will be rewarded.

832
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:09,980
Even...

833
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:10,980
I'm not afraid of death.

834
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,900
If I die for Zhongyi,

835
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,340
I will die for Rongyan.

836
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,900
As my father,

837
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:17,300
General, as you know,

838
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:19,300
he will never marry Sun Zui.

839
00:40:20,020 --> 00:40:21,940
He will also be my wife.

840
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,740
Thank you for your consideration.

841
00:40:29,420 --> 00:40:30,500
There is a decree in the capital.

842
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:32,020
Don't worry, Miss Gu.

843
00:40:39,620 --> 00:40:40,620
The April지 appearance.

844
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:42,220
You can take it.

845
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,140
Y�o Ruoyang,

846
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:51,660
the,

847
00:40:52,780 --> 00:41:06,300
Mr. Jin have prepared

848
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,340
an elixir.

849
00:41:07,340 --> 00:41:08,260
Thank you.

850
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:10,260
No, it's not like that.

851
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:12,460
This letter is a new record.

852
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,860
Every word is not recorded.

853
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:19,380
But I do understand what she wants.

854
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:23,740
I think Li Ni wants to join me.

855
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,900
I think she has planned for a long time

856
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:29,860
and finally has the confidence to save Prince Liang.

857
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:31,740
Your Highness, let's...

858
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:32,940
We have to help her.

859
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:34,780
According to what she said,

860
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,420
move跟� dishwashingogen to the window.

861
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:39,660
Yes.

862
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,380
Your Majesty.

863
00:42:04,380 --> 00:42:05,820
to become her trusted person.

864
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:08,020
Then, is she going to...

865
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:12,700
Royal Descendant

866
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:14,540
and that Imperial Descendant

867
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,660
have been in a lot of relationship

868
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:17,020
since the beginning of the war.

869
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:18,100
Fortunately,

870
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:19,820
Imperial Descendant has already been punished.

871
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,660
He will be in great favor in the future.

872
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:24,020
If I were her trusted person,

873
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,660
I would have a way

874
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,060
to make her and that Imperial Descendant

875
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,100
meet in the woods.

876
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,980
If you can marry Royal Descendant,

877
00:42:31,380 --> 00:42:32,580
that would be great.

878
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,340
No one in the family

879
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,180
can save you.

880
00:42:35,980 --> 00:42:37,620
It's early in the morning.

881
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:40,700
I wonder if Royal Descendant

882
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,780
can save Prince Liang this time.

883
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:45,980
Actually,

884
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:48,140
can we save Prince Liang?

885
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,180
It's all because of Royal Descendant.

886
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,220
It's all because of me.

887
00:42:53,900 --> 00:42:54,620
Your Highness,

888
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,580
I don't understand.

889
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:01,300
If we can save Prince Liang,

890
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:03,460
it will be a great joy.

891
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:05,260
Royal Descendant will have no more soldiers

892
00:43:05,420 --> 00:43:06,580
and no more bullets.

893
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,860
If we can't save Prince Liang,

894
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,820
if we kill Prince Liang,

895
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:14,180
Royal Descendant will be in great pain.

896
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,460
Actually, we don't have to be angry at all.

897
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:19,220
Even if the court has a discussion about it,

898
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:21,700
as long as Royal Descendant is all in the fog,

899
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:22,780
who dares to blame Royal Descendant

900
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:24,660
the other day?

901
00:43:28,980 --> 00:43:29,740
Royal Descendant

902
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,180
actually likes smart people.

903
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:33,300
Then, in front of him,

904
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:35,340
I don't have to hide it.

905
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,020
Do you think

906
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:44,020
Royal Descendant will leave the same place

907
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,180
like his brothers?

908
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,060
Guess.

909
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:49,940
If the battle is defeated,

910
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:51,140
it can be a great joy.

911
00:43:51,460 --> 00:43:52,740
But if the heart is lost,

912
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,020
it will be hard to cut it back.

913
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,740
His brothers are about to leave Luoyang.

914
00:43:57,220 --> 00:43:58,820
If Royal Descendant doesn't do anything,

915
00:43:58,940 --> 00:44:00,300
it will be a great joy.

916
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:01,580
I guess he will leave.

917
00:44:02,500 --> 00:44:03,820
Li Nisu will make a plan.

918
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:06,220
He has saved Prince Liang long ago.

919
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,580
It's easy for Royal Descendant to be a hero.

920
00:44:08,740 --> 00:44:10,420
It's easy to save Prince Liang.

921
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,740
So, we must think of a way

922
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,820
to make the heaven and earth meet.

923
00:44:15,580 --> 00:44:17,020
But I think that Li Baosun

924
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:20,420
is about to make the heaven and earth meet.

925
00:44:20,780 --> 00:44:22,500
Heaven and earth meet?

926
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:25,300
How can we make the heaven and earth meet?

927
00:44:26,100 --> 00:44:26,620
Taozi,

928
00:44:27,580 --> 00:44:28,500
do you remember

929
00:44:29,340 --> 00:44:30,700
you used to have a medicine?

930
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,420
Xiao Wei!

931
00:44:34,860 --> 00:44:36,460
Xiao Wei!

932
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:40,540
Xiao Wei,

933
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:41,820
the news from Yingzhou is coming.

934
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:43,620
Please go back to the doctor.
