1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Additional spoke

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The King's Desire

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
Shi Qi.

5
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Brother Bao.

6
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
Aduo, what's wrong?

7
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
The people from the palace have been waiting for a half hour.

8
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I was the one who asked,

9
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
did Shi Qiang like it?

10
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Didn't I tell them?

11
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
The King is sick.

12
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:06,000
He's seriously ill.

13
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
He can't get up.

14
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
But...

15
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Bao, you go.

16
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Chang'er won't lie.

17
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
He'll be killed if he's said it.

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
It hurts.

19
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I can't get up.

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
How are you?

21
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You're doing well, Brother Bao.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
We should eat the meat from the Fengyin Restaurant.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's too expensive.

24
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
We can't afford it.

25
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
It's said that we should pay three yuan.

26
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Fine.

27
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Your Highness,

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I'll take care of the other things.

29
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I'll send them away.

30
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I won't let them bother you.

31
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Give me three yuan.

32
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Xiao Lei, you're done writing this?

33
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I thought...

34
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
What did you think?

35
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I thought...

36
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
you'd explain to the King of Qin.

37
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After all,

38
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
we're in Changzhou City.

39
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Li Ni asked me to save him.

40
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
I have to save him?

41
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I came here from Changzhou City.

42
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Otherwise,

43
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
how could I be against the army of Cui's army?

44
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Moreover,

45
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
he's always reading the letter

46
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
and supports my army.

47
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Shouldn't I...

48
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
should I take the blame myself?

49
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Dudo.

50
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Don't spread it.

51
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
People's Dongya army is...

52
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes.

53
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
But

54
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
this poison is so cruel.

55
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,000
We should find out who poisoned it.

56
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
In order to...

57
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm afraid that Dudo is

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
so cruel.

59
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
The army of Cui's army

60
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
has been suffering from death.

61
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Only 60,000 people are left.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I didn't expect

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
that the rest of the tens of thousands

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
are suffering in Changzhou City.

65
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Cui's old man

66
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
is indeed a forbidden enemy.

67
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Dudo.

68
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Cui has taken Changzhou City.

69
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
If he and the King of Qin

70
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
have the chance,

71
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
the King of Qin is only Li Ni.

72
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
He can fight with Cui.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I think this time,

74
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
the idea of Cui's army

75
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
is Li Ni's idea.

76
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I didn't expect

77
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
that Sun Mo would be so talented.

78
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Only if we stick to the same rule

79
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
in the golden season,

80
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
we can get the Taishun power

81
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
as soon as possible.

82
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes.

83
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
For a few days,

84
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Li Ni is not willing to give up.

85
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
If he is so stubborn,

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
he will kill me.

87
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
In a few days,

88
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
the people of Cui's family

89
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
will be defeated in the Western World.

90
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Father.

91
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Now Cui's family has been in Changzhou City.

92
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
As long as they are willing,

93
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
they can attack Danzhou and Luzhou at any time.

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
The situation is so urgent.

95
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Li Ni is against it.

96
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He doesn't use the army as his main force.

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
He should be punished.

98
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Punish him.

99
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You know how to punish him.

100
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
If you punish the King of Qin,

101
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you will lead the army.

102
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Can you do it?

103
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Brother.

104
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Brother.

105
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Don't go to the heart of Father.

106
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Father loves you.

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
He knows the truth.

108
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Brother San is right.

109
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He is always like this.

110
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Why did he suddenly get angry?

111
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Can't you see it?

112
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Li Ni is so stubborn.

113
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
She has made Father angry at me.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Brother.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
A few days ago,

116
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I went to San Ding's house.

117
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
I thought of going back to sleep.

118
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I thought if I could persuade him,

119
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
it would be over.

120
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,000
But he is not kind to me.

121
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I suggest you not to go to San Ding's house again.

122
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You should go to Qi Rong.

123
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
Brother.

124
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Father.

125
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Why are you back?

126
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Father.

127
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I was just thinking about it.

128
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Brother San refused to lead the army to go out.

129
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
He must have something in his mind.

130
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Something?

131
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Tell me.

132
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Now, Chang Zhou is in a serious situation.

133
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
If you want anything,

134
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Father will give it to him.

135
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then you go to ask him for me.

136
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What exactly do you want?

137
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Of course, I can't ask him directly.

138
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
If I ask him directly,

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
he will be confused and refuse to tell me.

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You are a fool.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I am his son.

142
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I can't ask him what he wants.

143
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Father, don't worry.

144
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I will do my best to find out

145
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
whether he will lead the army to go out or not.

146
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
It's good that you are here.

147
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Good.

148
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
You can understand my feelings.

149
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Your brother is a man of the past.

150
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,000
He can't expect anything.

151
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Chang Zhou is a man of the past.

152
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
The people of the past are the present.

153
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
They are the present.

154
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,000
They are not only the late-night people,

155
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
but also the late-night people.

156
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I am here to reward you.

157
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
Master.

158
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Master.

159
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,000
Master.

160
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
You are so angry.

161
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Master, you are right.

162
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
The smell of the Qin's mansion

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
is really good.

164
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I went to drink with them.

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
How?

166
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
I drank three cans of good wine.

167
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
According to your order,

168
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
I have been drinking with them for a long time.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I will eat them with the cow and the horse.

170
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
I will put them in the trough.

171
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,000
I don't know if my brother is smart.

172
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Shi Qi, where are you going?

173
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
To fishing.

174
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Fishing?

175
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
You need to practice fishing first.

176
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
Where is so much water?

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Your Highness, be careful.

178
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
I love you.

179
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Third Brother.

180
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Third Brother.

181
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
Second Brother, why are you here?

182
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I came to visit you.

183
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Are you feeling better?

184
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,000
I don't want to hide it.

185
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,000
The imperial doctor said I was very good at fishing.

186
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,000
He told me to sit by the water without any trouble.

187
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
I was so happy to receive the emperor's blessings.

188
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
But you know that

189
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,000
my father ordered me to leave the country without thinking about it.

190
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
So I made a decision.

191
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Look, I am also sitting by the water.

192
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
But the pool is a little small.

193
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I let people in the private area and around

194
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
put water on it.

195
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Third Brother, you are so beautiful.

196
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,000
I want to ask for a quick prison sentence.

197
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Third Brother, I still have a question.

198
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I have told my father

199
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
to return the military power to you.

200
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
How can I expect that?

201
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
The land of Mo Fei is under the sky.

202
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
The army of Mo Fei is under the land.

203
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,000
The army of Mo Fei is under the sea.

204
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:34,000
How can I say that it is my military power?

205
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Third Brother,

206
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Changzhou has been occupied by the Cuiyi.

207
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Sun Jing and Pan Ju are in the same place.

208
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,000
The capital of Xi is very dangerous.

209
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,000
My brother is very busy.

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
I have blamed him.

211
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Now, my father has said in the edict

212
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,000
that you should lead the army to the capital.

213
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
You should lead the army to Xi.

214
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
You should lead the army to Changzhou.

215
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,000
If you still don't want to be angry,

216
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,000
I can only take my father to apologize to you.

217
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Second Brother,

218
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,000
isn't it a little ridiculous?

219
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,000
I just want my brother to be punished.

220
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
If I am to be punished,

221
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,000
I can't have the food and military power.

222
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Of course.

223
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Although the army is difficult to handle,

224
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,000
but Second Brother is so willing to do it,

225
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:44,000
my father is willing to do it.

226
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Then I can only do it

227
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,000
to avoid the enemy.

228
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Third Brother is very wise.

229
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
Xiao Wei. Xiao Wei.

230
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
Is Prince Qin really coming?

231
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,000
He is.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,000
You said you invited him to eat grilled fish.

233
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,000
He is.

234
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
He is not willing to do it.

235
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,000
He is leading the army to Changzhou.

236
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,000
How about taking the army?

237
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,000
Can't he bring the army to eat grilled fish?

238
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
No.

239
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,000
Xiao Wei.

240
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,000
Do you think we have hit his trap?

241
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,000
Look.

242
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,000
He wrote a letter first.

243
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We just asked him to solve the problem for General Pei.

244
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
And he also killed the army of Sun Jingzheng.

245
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,000
But he led the army

246
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,000
to Changzhou.

247
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
If Li Ni is really capable,

248
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:53,000
then we can take Changzhou back.

249
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Come and have a look.

250
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
You are so bold.

251
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
You are so bold.

252
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Plus, the last time you made a mistake,

253
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
I think there are 20 seconds left.

254
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
That's great.

255
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
We can finally tell the Qin family and Xiao Xi'er

256
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
from the play.

257
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Uncle Yang,

258
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,000
you are too naive.

259
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,000
You are a man of the wrong.

260
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
You said the war was over.

261
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
How many people can't survive?

262
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
The Qin family

263
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
sold the city for a few years.

264
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,000
And the princess was forced to make a secret case.

265
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
And they sold the daughter to the boss.

266
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,000
If they didn't meet us,

267
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,000
wouldn't they have been in the water with the daughter?

268
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
It's a good idea.

269
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
We can ask the general

270
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,000
to fight with the Qin people

271
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
to solve the problem.

272
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
What's the point?

273
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:37,000
We just want to make more people

274
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
suffer after the peace.

275
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Right?

276
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,000
You are right.

277
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
You are right.

278
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
I have a question.

279
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Think about it.

280
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,000
Think about the way to save people.

281
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
You must

282
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
make the Qin family and Xiao Xi'er

283
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
a good family.

284
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
Right.

285
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
Let's go.

286
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Let's go.

287
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
Let's go.

288
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:05,000
Young Master,

289
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I heard that Prince Qin has been led by the Qi Army.

290
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
He is here to take over Changzhou.

291
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
He is the general of the army.

292
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:19,000
I heard.

293
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,000
He is the general of the army.

294
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
It's enough.

295
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,000
Let's go.

296
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Let's go.

297
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Let's go.

298
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,000
Let's go.

299
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
Let's go.

300
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Let's go.

301
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Let's go.

302
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:36,080
Any help from me, please do ask Madam.

303
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:42,680
I'm fine now.

304
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
I even..."

305
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,560
Hu Luobels.

306
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,920
It seems your body is sufficient now.

307
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,920
Yes.

308
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,880
I promised to save you,

309
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,060
the III Government officers

310
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,320
were swordless and commonly like everyone else�

311
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,360
I can still become like Wushan

312
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,380
but I cannot

313
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,860
teach Rep valuableing of吕's military

314
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:12,360
to Commander

315
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,000
I cannot fight

316
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:27,780
bothoff the military and honor warrior

317
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:30,060
this medicine unblocked the Xu Ming demon.

318
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:33,260
As long as I don't give you

319
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,980
any chance to 40 Moon Ember from theHave,

320
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:37,940
you'll die

321
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,380
of indomitable filial piety,

322
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,420
Master said

323
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:47,020
that the inc 사람이

324
00:15:48,220 --> 00:15:49,980
extend the negligence

325
00:15:52,020 --> 00:15:54,020
caused by being located in the mountains

326
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,500
and the predcarged to Jungle.

327
00:15:57,780 --> 00:16:01,780
I know how to make them kill themselves.

328
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,780
If the leader believes me,

329
00:16:06,780 --> 00:16:08,780
he will send a team of people

330
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:10,780
to join the Central Plains with me.

331
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,780
I will make the leader see

332
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:17,780
the return of my life.

333
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,780
As long as the situation is in the Western Capital,

334
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,780
we will be able to save the people.

335
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:26,780
As long as the King of Qin is in the Western Capital,

336
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,780
we will have a chance to kill him.

337
00:16:30,780 --> 00:16:33,780
He is in you, I am in peace.

338
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:38,780
Now, there is a slow and difficult time.

339
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:42,780
The King of Qin is already near Changzhou.

340
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:44,780
We have a chance to kill him now.

341
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,780
Ying, this time,

342
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:52,780
no matter what, I will let you come back to me.

343
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,780
I will come back to you.

344
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:02,780
General, come and take the medicine.

345
00:17:09,780 --> 00:17:12,780
I have taken this medicine for more than ten years.

346
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:14,780
I don't know when it will be a headache.

347
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,780
The medicine is bitter and has a good effect on the patient's health.

348
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,780
My father's old injury is always caused by the Heavenly Buddha's hair.

349
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,780
So, this medicine must not be used for long term.

350
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
Come, drink it.

351
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,780
It's good for your health.

352
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,780
I know.

353
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,780
You should take care of my father.

354
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:38,780
I heard that the Emperor asked Li Ni to lead the troops to lead Changzhou.

355
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:42,780
Changzhou is a southern palace.

356
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:43,780
What if he comes?

357
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Is my father afraid of him?

358
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:49,780
You are talking nonsense.

359
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,780
This time, I will not be in the hands of Liu Qing.

360
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,780
Don't be in the hands of Liu Qing.

361
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:57,780
Li Ni is a young man.

362
00:17:57,780 --> 00:18:00,780
I will let him know that my father is good at it.

363
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:01,780
Of course.

364
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,780
Hello, you two.

365
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:11,780
Xiao Wei, the rose-pickled cherry blossom is so beautiful.

366
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,780
It looks like a flower.

367
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,780
The name is also good.

368
00:18:16,780 --> 00:18:18,780
You are a little bit like a little cat.

369
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:19,780
It smells so good.

370
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,780
Young Master.

371
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:58,780
Young Master.

372
00:19:11,780 --> 00:19:12,780
Young Master.

373
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,780
Young Master.

374
00:19:17,780 --> 00:19:18,780
Young Master.

375
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,780
What are you doing?

376
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,780
Why are you here with me?

377
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:47,620
I...

378
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,860
Stop fighting!

379
00:20:07,300 --> 00:20:08,220
Xiaowan, are you okay?

380
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,380
No.

381
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:11,340
Be careful.

382
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:12,660
They poisoned me.

383
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:13,700
You...

384
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:17,300
What are you going to do when you arrive in Changzhou?

385
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,820
You're going to take the army

386
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:23,420
and rush to the West to fight against the Cui's army?

387
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,500
Of course not.

388
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
I have another plan.

389
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,460
I can get the army.

390
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,500
If you don't move the sword,

391
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:33,500
you'll be able to get the army back to Changzhou?

392
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,140
You said that this He Xiaowei

393
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,140
wouldn't eat even a little bit of kui.

394
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,060
You wrote a letter to save General Pei.

395
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,300
He really saved the army.

396
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,540
But he also killed Changzhou.

397
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,380
That's too much.

398
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,460
I said, Shi Qi Lang,

399
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,180
in the future,

400
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,540
you'll be afraid of your wife.

401
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:56,980
You can't count on her.

402
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,900
Is it okay to say the right thing?

403
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:00,380
It's not the right thing.

404
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:02,980
General, send a message.

405
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:08,260
How did you find this pigeon?

406
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,540
It's a bit sad.

407
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:13,940
There are only new people in the world.

408
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,940
Do you think this pigeon

409
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,740
is delicious?

410
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:21,180
I'm just a man.

411
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,020
I'll eat the meat of that Feng Yino.

412
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,740
Didn't I give you money

413
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,540
for the waist pain last time?

414
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,020
It's not that I have a flower shop

415
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,100
before I left the capital.

416
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,260
Xiao Bao,

417
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,660
you don't have much money.

418
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,620
When you don't fight in the future,

419
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,740
you can go home and get the land.

420
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,180
How nice to marry a wife.

421
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,380
The boat is straight.

422
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:48,020
When you really get to this place,

423
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:50,420
you must save money to get the land.

424
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,220
Then you can marry a wife.

425
00:21:53,340 --> 00:21:54,180
But now,

426
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,700
I said, Shi Qi Lang,

427
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,820
do you think this pigeon

428
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,380
is delicious?

429
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:05,700
Thank you.

430
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,260
Let's go.

431
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:10,900
All right.

432
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:36,700
Putting on antibodies

433
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:39,460
to the body

434
00:22:39,740 --> 00:22:40,700
I'm not sure.

435
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:47,540
I don't know

436
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,540
if Ying's poison is not cured.

437
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,060
Young Master,

438
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,660
if we don't use this method at the moment,

439
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,300
we can't force Li Ni out.

440
00:22:58,820 --> 00:22:59,980
If Xiao Wei is blaming you,

441
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,340
you'll say I'm the one who did it.

442
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:03,580
No.

443
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,700
He won't blame me.

444
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,780
Because Ying is about to marry me.

445
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,180
How could he blame me?

446
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,900
Is the sweet soup ready so soon?

447
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,700
It's you.

448
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,580
Why can't it be me?

449
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,540
You've been in Changzhou for a long time.

450
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,700
I shouldn't have taken you to Changzhou

451
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,380
to get you in the middle of the night.

452
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,620
Since you want to protect me,

453
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:01,540
why did you come here with the sweet soup?

454
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,660
Then I should have let you go first.

455
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,540
Or else, if you were so stubborn,

456
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:08,140
I wouldn't have brought you here

457
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:10,100
and you wouldn't have been here.

458
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:12,060
You can lie to me

459
00:24:12,060 --> 00:24:13,180
if you want to have the sweet soup.

460
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:14,540
Besides,

461
00:24:14,980 --> 00:24:17,140
the soup is not made by you.

462
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,540
It's made by Taozi.

463
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,380
There's no sincerity.

464
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:22,660
Aren't you afraid

465
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,140
that I'll call someone in

466
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,340
and tie you up

467
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:27,060
and leave it to our general?

468
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,220
Tie you up.

469
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,740
I'm also here

470
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,140
to discuss Changzhou with the general.

471
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:35,740
Drink this medicine quickly.

472
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,940
When I received the message from Taozi,

473
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,260
I was scared.

474
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,580
I ran over to pick you up.

475
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,380
Well,

476
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:42,980
it must be very bitter.

477
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,980
I'll try it on you first.

478
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,820
Why did you drink it?

479
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:50,340
The medicine that detoxifies the poison

480
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:51,500
is a poison that is used to detoxify the poison.

481
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,260
It's poisonous.

482
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:56,420
Why did you drink it?

483
00:24:56,420 --> 00:24:57,260
I don't know.

484
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,940
Why didn't you say that it's poisonous?

485
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:01,460
It hurts.

486
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:03,860
It hurts.

487
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:04,620
Are you okay?

488
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,020
Shi Qi Lang.

489
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:06,740
Let's go.

490
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,180
Shi Qi Lang.

491
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:10,980
Are you okay, Shi Qi Lang?

492
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:11,980
What's wrong?

493
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,100
Shi Qi Lang.

494
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:15,900
Shi Qi Lang.

495
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,180
Wake up.

496
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:19,300
Shi Qi Lang.

497
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,060
How is it?

498
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:32,980
Are you okay?

499
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:35,420
How dare you trust me?

500
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,420
How can I?

501
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,620
I'll try the medicine for you.

502
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,340
Is it bitter?

503
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,140
It's not bitter, right?

504
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,220
No.

505
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:41,620
Come and try it again.

506
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,820
Hurry up.

507
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,020
It's too late.

508
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,780
Arrest him here.

509
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,660
Your Highness,

510
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,740
why are we on Angые City?

511
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:14,060
ない

512
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:17,100
Let me Challenge you to GuBLO.

513
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:28,900
Your Highness.

514
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,940
Tell me this morning,

515
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,500
which deed is workshops followed?

516
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,780
Before Iψay אזah,

517
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,700
Yes, General.

518
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,340
Guards!

519
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:40,060
Take the spy of the four windows into the mansion!

520
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:41,740
General!

521
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,220
It's not him! General!

522
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,260
It's not him!

523
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,540
He Xiaobei!

524
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:51,180
You have taken the military base

525
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,260
of the General's mansion

526
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:55,260
and you don't know

527
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:56,060
how to deal with the military base

528
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,980
of our Cui family.

529
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,780
You should follow the military base

530
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,460
these days.

531
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:06,180
So that you can let him go.

532
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:34,940
I have changed.

533
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:47,820
Take your place.

534
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Wait here.

535
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,060
anın.

536
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:53,380
You're back.

537
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,660
How's Aiariat?

538
00:27:55,020 --> 00:27:56,500
The General gently instructes.

539
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,780
So I'm here to find out

540
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:59,260
if you are couldn't bring

541
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,540
his scrape out of the aid.

542
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,660
Otherwise,

543
00:28:01,940 --> 00:28:03,420
you can take the military leg

544
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,180
I'm sorry.

545
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,660
This Li Ni

546
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,620
always says that she's the best

547
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,020
of Zhen Xi Xun.

548
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,820
Qiao Qiao came to see me.

549
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:11,940
My father

550
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:12,900
has a serious problem.

551
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:15,140
What should we do now?

552
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:17,300
Since she's the best,

553
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:18,500
she shouldn't

554
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:19,900
leave a mark on herself.

555
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,300
What mark?

556
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:22,620
Where's your whistle?

557
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:25,660
Right.

558
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,740
If the King of Qin comes,

559
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,860
the ears are also coming.

560
00:28:28,180 --> 00:28:29,340
I'll blow the whistle and call him.

561
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,660
Make him tap it.

562
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,420
Have some water.

563
00:28:58,340 --> 00:28:59,140
Xiao Wei.

564
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:00,140
It's bright.

565
00:29:00,700 --> 00:29:01,700
It hasn't come with his ears.

566
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,020
Just the King of Qin

567
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,740
I...

568
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,140
So annoying.

569
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,700
Xiaowei,

570
00:29:10,820 --> 00:29:11,380
Taozi,

571
00:29:11,580 --> 00:29:12,420
it's breakfast time.

572
00:29:24,700 --> 00:29:25,260
Taozi.

573
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,100
Why did you come here?

574
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,460
My fever is almost gone.

575
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,460
I thought you wouldn't come.

576
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:32,700
I knew it.

577
00:29:32,780 --> 00:29:34,500
You will come to see us.

578
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
It's late.

579
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,140
You were so strict.

580
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,420
I was so hard to get in.

581
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,060
I was the one who came in.

582
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:41,580
I'm sorry.

583
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,620
Forgive me.

584
00:29:44,140 --> 00:29:44,900
Where's Shi Qi Lang?

585
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,140
Prince Qin has been locked up in the water.

586
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:48,820
Xiao Wei and I are locked up now.

587
00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,300
That's why I want to find you a way.

588
00:29:51,100 --> 00:29:52,460
No wonder I waited for half a night outside.

589
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,620
I didn't wait for him.

590
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:55,420
He's locked up in the water now.

591
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,660
You have to help me to get him out.

592
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,660
But how can I help you?

593
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:00,900
What did you wear?

594
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:02,820
I'm under a lot of pressure.

595
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,660
So you are wearing the same clothes as well.

596
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:17,420
And look at you.

597
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,260
And then I sent him in.

598
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:21,940
I should have made you hungry already.

599
00:30:29,660 --> 00:30:31,300
He even didn't laugh at you.

600
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,540
What gum?

601
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,260
Eating gum?

602
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:38,780
Don't you get home easily now?

603
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,300
Come here.

604
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:42,700
Is this for real?

605
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:47,580
But you can do something that you really should do!

606
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:52,020
You kiss me.

607
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:53,820
You sway.

608
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:55,780
What?

609
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,260
Why not?

610
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:59,260
I don't know if you have any food or medicine.

611
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,260
You are so fierce.

612
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,260
Just wait for me to escape.

613
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,260
I'll take you to the temple.

614
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:10,260
Okay?

615
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:14,260
Okay.

616
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,260
Why are you here?

617
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
You were locked up in the jail for me.

618
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,260
I came to see you.

619
00:31:33,260 --> 00:31:35,260
Did you agree to it?

620
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:37,260
What did I agree to?

621
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,260
Siwen.

622
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,260
What if I regret it?

623
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,260
This time,

624
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,260
I won't let you go no matter what.

625
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,260
Okay.

626
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,260
Since you are so lively,

627
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,260
I won't worry about it.

628
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,260
Just stay here.

629
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,260
When I'm free,

630
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:01,260
I'll let you out.

631
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:04,260
Are you leaving?

632
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,260
Are you kidding me?

633
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:08,260
I'm leaving.

634
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:10,260
Xiaobin.

635
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,260
Who was that?

636
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,260
Why are you so serious?

637
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:20,260
We don't look serious.

638
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:22,260
You are so young.

639
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:24,260
You are the general's wife.

640
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,260
I'm leaving.

641
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,260
Why are you back?

642
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,260
I'm not taking the medicine.

643
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:48,260
How could I save you?

644
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:50,260
I knew you wouldn't leave.

645
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,260
I'm sorry.

646
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,260
I knew you wouldn't leave.

647
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,260
Let's go.

648
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,260
Dad won't let me get out of the door.

649
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,260
I came out of the room.

650
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:08,260
I guess I can't hide it.

651
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,260
Let's go.

652
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
These keys are not in the closet.

653
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:14,260
I took the eight notes by myself.

654
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,260
And there are some materials.

655
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:18,260
Let's get out of here.

656
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:19,260
Let's go.

657
00:33:23,260 --> 00:33:24,260
I'm leaving.

658
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:25,260
I'm leaving.

659
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:53,260
Good.

660
00:33:54,260 --> 00:33:56,260
You dare to break my army's guards.

661
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:57,260
I wish you good luck.

662
00:33:57,260 --> 00:33:58,260
General Cui.

663
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:00,260
I came here for the sake of Changzhou.

664
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,260
I should have come here to visit you.

665
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,260
But I'm afraid that I'll get the soldiers.

666
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,260
General Cui will misunderstand.

667
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:07,260
So I'm going to be alone.

668
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:09,260
You are so cunning.

669
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:10,260
General Cui.

670
00:34:10,260 --> 00:34:12,260
Ying hasn't come home yet.

671
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,260
Let her go back to her room and rest.

672
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,260
I'll follow you if you want to kill.

673
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:19,260
Don't worry.

674
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,260
General Cui is so brave.

675
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
He's not a kind person.

676
00:34:23,260 --> 00:34:24,260
He won't kill me.

677
00:34:26,260 --> 00:34:27,260
Don't wear high-skinned hats.

678
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:29,260
Don't think that I won't kill you

679
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:31,260
if I wear a flower-patterned hat.

680
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,260
General Cui won't kill you.

681
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:37,260
Go ahead.

682
00:34:38,260 --> 00:34:39,260
I...

683
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:53,260
Do you like my daughter?

684
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:55,260
Yes.

685
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:57,260
General Cui.

686
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:00,260
I've been a fan of you.

687
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:02,260
I hope you can fulfill your wish.

688
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,260
I'll do it.

689
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,260
If you really like Ying,

690
00:35:11,260 --> 00:35:13,260
I can't help you.

691
00:35:14,260 --> 00:35:15,260
Really?

692
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,260
But you have to promise me one thing.

693
00:35:18,260 --> 00:35:20,260
As long as I'm not being loyal to you,

694
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:22,260
I'll make a living by your side.

695
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,260
I'll do it for you.

696
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,260
I want you to give up on Changzhou

697
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:31,260
and join the Cui family.

698
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,260
I'll give Ying Xu

699
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:36,260
the position of Cui's army.

700
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:39,260
General Cui.

701
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:41,260
I can't do it.

702
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:42,260
You're worried that

703
00:35:42,260 --> 00:35:45,260
the Cui family will be ruined by you.

704
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,260
Why do you ask me that?

705
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:50,260
You're a son of Chen Gang and Fu Wei Zi Gang.

706
00:35:50,260 --> 00:35:51,260
As your son,

707
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,260
if I join the Cui family,

708
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,260
I'll be the one to be the emperor.

709
00:35:56,260 --> 00:35:58,260
And I'll be the emperor.

710
00:35:58,260 --> 00:35:59,260
The court will

711
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,260
humiliate you

712
00:36:01,260 --> 00:36:02,260
and humiliate me.

713
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:04,260
The court will

714
00:36:04,260 --> 00:36:06,260
fight for the Cui family.

715
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:09,260
The world will be in a state of war.

716
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:11,260
It's not loyal to the country.

717
00:36:11,260 --> 00:36:12,260
It's unfilial to the father.

718
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,260
It's hard to do it.

719
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,260
You're so generous.

720
00:36:22,260 --> 00:36:23,260
Then you don't have to say anything.

721
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,260
Go back to the prison.

722
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,260
General Cui.

723
00:36:26,260 --> 00:36:27,260
I don't want to go back to the prison.

724
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
But I can't let you go.

725
00:36:28,260 --> 00:36:29,260
General Cui.

726
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,260
A Ying has a poison in her body.

727
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,260
I want to stay and take care of her.

728
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:35,260
But she's not well.

729
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:37,260
I'll let you handle it.

730
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,260
Good.

731
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,260
You can think like that.

732
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:46,260
It's a good thing.

733
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,260
Then general Cui.

734
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,260
Is it her?

735
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:53,260
But you're good at the general's family.

736
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:55,260
You have a good chance of getting the chance.

737
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,260
You have to follow my order.

738
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,260
You'll be the first to be the border guard.

739
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,260
I'll let you go.

740
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:03,260
Prince Qin.

741
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:06,260
Are you the border guard or the prison guard?

742
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,260
You can choose the two.

743
00:37:10,260 --> 00:37:12,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

744
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,260
Good.

745
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:15,260
Good.

746
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:17,260
Guards.

747
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,260
Take the border guard.

748
00:37:18,260 --> 00:37:19,260
Yes.

749
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:20,260
General Cui.

750
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:22,260
A Ying lives far away from here.

751
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,260
I'm afraid that she'll get a rest.

752
00:37:24,260 --> 00:37:26,260
Let's go outside.

753
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,260
Good.

754
00:37:32,260 --> 00:37:34,260
It's your turn to be the border guard.

755
00:37:34,260 --> 00:37:36,260
You've been the border guard for 30 days.

756
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:37,260
How is it?

757
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,260
Just ask general Cui not to hit me.

758
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:42,260
I don't want A Ying to worry.

759
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,260
Fine.

760
00:37:45,260 --> 00:37:47,260
I'll give you my word.

761
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Don't touch my face.

762
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,260
Yes.

763
00:37:54,260 --> 00:37:56,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

764
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:26,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

765
00:38:54,260 --> 00:38:58,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

766
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

767
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:03,260
You're a good boy.

768
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,260
You're a good boy.

769
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,260
General Cui.

770
00:39:12,260 --> 00:39:14,260
Please give me a piece of clothing.

771
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,260
So that A Ying can see it.

772
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,260
Fine.

773
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:21,260
I'll give you my word.

774
00:39:22,260 --> 00:39:23,260
I'm sorry.

775
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,260
I'll give you my word.

776
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:56,260
A Ying.

777
00:39:56,260 --> 00:39:57,260
I'm sorry.

778
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:00,260
I'm sorry.

779
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,260
Just tell me.

780
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,260
I'm sorry.

781
00:40:05,260 --> 00:40:06,260
You're a good boy.

782
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:08,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

783
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:11,260
I'll be the border guard for the rest of my life.

784
00:40:14,260 --> 00:40:16,260
A Ying, you're awake.

785
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:19,260
A Ying, you're awake.

786
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,260
Didn't father lock you in?

787
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,340
I'm sure Father will be reprimanded.

788
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:26,300
You think you can fight for a long time

789
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,580
with the Western Army?

790
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:29,900
You're a great warrior.

791
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,260
You think you're like your father?

792
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:34,100
Tell me quickly.

793
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,380
What did you tell Father?

794
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:38,500
He let you in to accompany me.

795
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,700
I told him that you like me.

796
00:40:48,180 --> 00:40:49,780
If you can't see me,

797
00:40:50,020 --> 00:40:51,460
you can't eat or drink.

798
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,620
You don't want to drink.

799
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,660
You should let me in

800
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:56,780
to accompany you.

801
00:40:57,340 --> 00:40:59,460
Although Father doesn't like me,

802
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:01,900
he still agrees.

803
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:03,820
I knew it.

804
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:05,260
He must take me in.

805
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:06,700
He wants to wake Father up.

806
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,700
What's wrong?

807
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:10,980
Nothing.

808
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:11,940
Are you hurt?

809
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:12,780
No.

810
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:14,380
Show me.

811
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,660
Are you hurt?

812
00:41:17,940 --> 00:41:18,820
No.

813
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,100
No.

814
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,060
Take off your clothes.

815
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:21,860
How can a girl

816
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,060
take off her clothes?

817
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:23,660
If you don't take off your clothes,

818
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,500
I'll tie you up.

819
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:25,340
I'll take it myself.

820
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:26,220
No.

821
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:27,700
Do you want to eat?

822
00:41:27,900 --> 00:41:28,620
I'll make you something to eat.

823
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,780
Take it off.

824
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:52,140
We're forming alike then.

825
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:53,640
Dare to date again?

826
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,780
Father hit you so many times.

827
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:04,500
30 years old.

828
00:42:04,980 --> 00:42:06,540
You've been�essing me all this while.

829
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,060
You won't show up

830
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,660
just to eat you in.

831
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:09,500
You told him a lot

832
00:42:09,620 --> 00:42:10,860
when you were here.

833
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,140
App выпуск kou shin shin said

834
00:42:12,260 --> 00:42:14,300
that I was the best food in Zhen Xi Jun.

835
00:42:14,460 --> 00:42:15,860
Then why didn't you亮 my talent

836
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:17,100
and suddenly left?

837
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:18,180
Will anyone else

838
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:19,380
catch you saying you have a bad-reffentlich.

839
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:20,540
Alright, Auntie.

840
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:21,900
I'm not angry.

841
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:24,540
You look so angry.

842
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,500
You said you're not angry.

843
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,620
I don't know

844
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:27,940
such a silly person like you.

845
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:30,940
Aying.

846
00:42:32,580 --> 00:42:33,420
Think about it.

847
00:42:33,780 --> 00:42:35,340
If we were a daughter,

848
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:36,620
we would be so proud.

849
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,580
We would be like a pig.

850
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:39,900
Suddenly,

851
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,660
a stinky brat came in

852
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,340
and stole our daughter

853
00:42:43,940 --> 00:42:45,300
from my daughter's bed.

854
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,260
If I found out,

855
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:48,780
I wouldn't cut her

856
00:42:48,780 --> 00:42:49,980
into pieces.

857
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:51,540
Only 30 times.

858
00:42:51,740 --> 00:42:52,700
It's cheaper.

859
00:42:53,020 --> 00:42:54,580
Who wants to be a daughter?

860
00:42:55,260 --> 00:42:56,060
Son.

861
00:42:56,860 --> 00:42:57,740
Son.

862
00:42:58,420 --> 00:42:59,180
Anyway,

863
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,820
don't be angry.

864
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,780
Don't blame Uncle Cui.

865
00:43:04,780 --> 00:43:05,860
General Cui.

866
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:08,820
Where's Taozi?

867
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:10,340
The medicine is ready.

868
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:11,340
I'll get it for you.

869
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,780
I want to get him some medicine.

870
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,300
The medicine is ready.

871
00:43:14,580 --> 00:43:15,580
He's taking the medicine.

872
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,060
His wound is like this.

873
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:18,500
If he doesn't take the medicine today,

874
00:43:18,580 --> 00:43:20,020
he'll be in trouble tomorrow.

875
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:25,460
I'll get it.

876
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:27,500
Will you help me

877
00:43:27,940 --> 00:43:28,900
get it back?

878
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:30,380
You love to be a fool.

879
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:31,740
Such a silly person

880
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:33,420
can make you suffer.

881
00:45:48,500 --> 00:45:55,380
I'm waiting for you to come back to me.
