00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
The following video is awhileقksi

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,160
General

3
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:54,540
I've

4
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:56,660
Gained auzu

5
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:58,900
Could

6
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:01,300
Liu Chengfeng took the white water from the gate

7
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,060
and sent another batch of people

8
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,700
to the Central Plains

9
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,540
to the other side of the city.

10
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,020
But they didn't want to go out.

11
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,580
Wu Luo is a very cunning person.

12
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,620
He's a useless person.

13
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,580
He even made such a mistake.

14
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:21,140
Someone sent him out

15
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,220
and told Liu Chengfeng to go to the Central Plains.

16
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,140
There must be something wrong.

17
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:33,040
Ask the chief of the班

18
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,820
and find out the information about those educatedics.

19
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,940
Yes.

20
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:49,860
Your Highness

21
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,940
what I did was really qualified for this task.

22
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:56,060
Since the moment of the Bai Shui

23
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,940
people 들어보는

24
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:01,740
ask to see me marshmallow bowl

25
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,540
Theàs Digidation

26
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,180
is merely a trigger

27
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,020
and His Highness

28
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:10,260
is still porridge

29
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:13,100
You're right

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,740
Prince Qin cups the troubles

31
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,660
I'm not

32
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,060
enough for porridge

33
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,180
Your Highness

34
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,380
I also

35
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,460
Adapted

36
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,820
I've brought in a lot of people

37
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,540
who are willing to serve His Highness at any time.

38
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,940
I'm the King of the court.

39
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,340
Let me use the one who accepts my offer.

40
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,540
I'm not a fool.

41
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,940
If you think something is wrong,

42
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:42,580
you shouldn't do it.

43
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:48,460
Or you want to act secretly,

44
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,780
we'll take back the favor of your Highness

45
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,300
and serve you.

46
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:55,500
No matter what,

47
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,940
I won't let you

48
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,900
be so ridiculous.

49
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,580
What are you doing

50
00:04:04,060 --> 00:04:05,700
to help me?

51
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,580
You're a straightforward person.

52
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:09,540
I've told you

53
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,100
that you can only make Li Ni die

54
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,940
if you don't have enough money.

55
00:04:18,860 --> 00:04:20,980
I just want her to die.

56
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:25,180
Your Highness.

57
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:27,220
My three brothers

58
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
have offended many people.

59
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:33,020
Don't worry, Your Highness.

60
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:34,980
The King of Qin is a big family.

61
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,220
He'll never be a general.

62
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,580
My three brothers always love each other.

63
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,380
If he's never a general,

64
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:49,860
it's a pity.

65
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,260
Your Highness.

66
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,100
What are you thinking?

67
00:04:58,740 --> 00:04:59,700
Is this the reason

68
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:01,140
for the big deal?

69
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:03,540
Every time we make a plan

70
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:06,380
and hope that Your Highness can do the right thing,

71
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,820
it's what your family calls drilling.

72
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,940
It's just a simple olmayi.

73
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,940
Are you okay?

74
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,060
Yes.

75
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,860
It must be the happiest day

76
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:27,340
since I was born.

77
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:30,340
Me too.

78
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,180
It's a pity that it's the happiest day.

79
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,060
It's about to pass.

80
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:46,100
It's a long and precious day.

81
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,860
No matter how hard I try,

82
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,400
I must say ...

83
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:54,260
we must end

84
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,440
this day.

85
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:02,560
Yes.

86
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,780
osto Is it too late now?

87
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,200
If one day

88
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:14,520
I made

89
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,220
something really upsetting

90
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,000
for you,

91
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:17,800
do you not longer love me anymore

92
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,360
you don't like me anymore,

93
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:22,360
and you don't like me anymore?

94
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,360
I wanted to lie to you,

95
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,840
but I did say so.

96
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:36,040
But I can't bear to leave you.

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I like you so much.

98
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,160
Maybe I will like you for a long time.

99
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:44,680
I think

100
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,920
I won't like others like you.

101
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:50,920
So, how can you treat me?

102
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,560
I like you.

103
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,960
I know

104
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:07,560
that the amount of tolerance is at the bottom line.

105
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:12,440
Let's play another game, okay?

106
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:15,600
What?

107
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,240
Close your eyes.

108
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,760
When you count,

109
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,160
if you haven't opened your eyes,

110
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:24,600
you will win.

111
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,480
Then,

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,360
if we are enemies,

113
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,320
I will let you go three times.

114
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,400
But if you open your eyes,

115
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,000
if we are enemies,

116
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,600
you will let me go three times.

117
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,240
Okay?

118
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,560
你想的,

119
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:48,760
no.

120
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:50,920
I want to win this go so hard.

121
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,240
Fine.

122
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:02,440
Let's start.

123
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,440

124
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:09,640

00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:24,840
Fortress of frying gizzards bunun Wu Bai這一at and treading to Xu Weibo to hook Games as well as the Jin's.

127
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,660
I've lost.

128
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:46,660
From now on, I'll owe you three times.

129
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,260

130
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,040

Qing Dynasty and the포

bood

133
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,720
early youth

134
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:36,780
Make yourself comfortable

135
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:43,840
알았어

136
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,100
Alright

137
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,180
Alright

hints

140
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,300
your suspicions

141
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,300
will work

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,600
Remember

143
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:55,840
First of all

144
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,020
Give me a second

145
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,120
Stay still

146
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,280
Wait

147
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,720
If time is running up

148
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,840
Listen again

149
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,640
When I

150
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,820
Stand there

151
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,080
on stage

152
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,220
Forever

153
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:10,360
never see you again

154
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,420
Blackye

155
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,420
If we love each other, we will be strangers

156
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:53,420
If we love each other, I will live for you

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,420
How lonely it is to be alone

158
00:10:58,420 --> 00:10:59,420
You two

159
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,420
should be together

160
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:15,420
If we love each other, I will live for you

161
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:22,420
I will love you for eternity

162
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,420
I am willing to sing for you

163
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:32,420
I will wait for your response

164
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:37,420
Your Majesty

165
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:41,420
Cui's army, the enemy killed tens of thousands

166
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,420
and captured the Ministry of Revenue and Revenue

167
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,420
There are also vehicles, construction, food and water

168
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,420
and returned to the White Water Pass

169
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:52,420
to be captured and re-established

170
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:53,420
and re-established

171
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:57,420
I, Cui Yi, personally押借 the Ministry of Revenue

172
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,420
and Revenue

173
00:11:58,420 --> 00:12:00,420
and re-established the Ministry of Revenue

174
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,420
I congratulate you

175
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,420
Long live, long live, long live

176
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:10,420
I knew it

177
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,420
I am the God

178
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,420
I have no power

179
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,420
I have no power

180
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,420
Your Majesty

181
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,420
Cui Yi returned to the White Water Pass

182
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,420
and captured the Ministry of Revenue

183
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:28,420
It is all because you are so kind

184
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:30,420
If you don't have the imperial decree

185
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,420
and the Ministry of Revenue and Revenue

186
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,420
you can't get this big deal

187
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,420
Pei Qing is right

188
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:40,420
Although the imperial decree is my order

189
00:12:40,420 --> 00:12:44,420
but I have to send all the imperial decree

190
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,420
to the Ministry of Revenue and Revenue

191
00:12:46,420 --> 00:12:49,420
to help them to urge the army

192
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:53,420
Fortunately, I have been back to the imperial decree

193
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:55,420
and returned to the court

194
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,420
Otherwise, I don't know

195
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,420
who I should hand over to

196
00:12:59,420 --> 00:13:01,420
The Ministry of Revenue

197
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:04,420
should be held by the Ministry of Revenue and Revenue

198
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:05,420
It's okay

199
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,420
Although they hold the ceremony

200
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:09,420
but Pei Qing, you

201
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:13,420
need to take care of some of my duties

202
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:15,420
Since such a big event

203
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:17,420
is too wonderful for the county

204
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:20,420
we should have a grand event

205
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,420
Go to the imperial decree

206
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:26,420
and release the new king

207
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,420
You should be with me when you are in the county

208
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,420
Your Majesty

209
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:40,420
Cui's army is a big army

210
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,420
and the new king is a loyal man

211
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:45,420
He killed dozens of lives on purpose

212
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:47,420
How long will it take?

213
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,420
Your Majesty, please forgive me

214
00:13:50,420 --> 00:13:52,420
He is your brother

215
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:55,420
Why are you so hardworking?

216
00:13:55,420 --> 00:13:57,420
The death of the new king

217
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:59,420
is it not innocent?

218
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,420
Your Majesty

219
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,420
There is a memorial paper

220
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:10,420
with the general Cui's army

221
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,420
and the memorial paper

222
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,420
Yuan Changshu

223
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,420
Read the memorial paper

224
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,420
It seems that the general Cui

225
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,420
has too many military merits

226
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,420
He can't write a memorial paper

227
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:25,420
and there is another memorial paper

228
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:27,420
Let's see

229
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,420
the person who made the merit

230
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,420
Yes

231
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,420
Read it

232
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:38,420
Your Majesty

233
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,420
I, General Pingliang

234
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,420
General Weiyang

235
00:14:42,420 --> 00:14:44,420
am the general of the county

236
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:46,420
General Cui

237
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,420
is a general of the county

238
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:50,420
Please

239
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:52,420
make the king of Qin

240
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,420
the crown prince

241
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,420
Shut up

242
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,420
Cui is a bastard

243
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,420
Your Majesty

244
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:09,420
You are loyal

245
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,420
but you are a saint

246
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,420
You can't say that

247
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:15,420
you are loyal

248
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:17,420
to the general

249
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:19,420
He thinks he can

250
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,420
do nothing to me

251
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:25,420
I don't know

252
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,420
what you are doing

253
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:29,420
Your Majesty

254
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:31,420
Li Chu is not your family

255
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,420
Li Chu is the general of the county

256
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,420
So as the general of the county

257
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:37,420
you should

258
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:39,420
read the memorial paper

259
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,420
You mean

260
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,420
you think I am right?

261
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:45,420
Your Majesty

262
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,420
although you are loyal

263
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:49,420
you are loyal to the general

264
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:51,420
You should

265
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,420
be loyal to the general

266
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:55,420
Don't talk about this

267
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,420
with me

268
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:59,420
You are right

269
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,420
You should

270
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:03,420
Anyway

271
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,420
you are loyal

272
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
to the general

273
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,420
Your Majesty

274
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,420
I am innocent

275
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:12,420
I don't need you

276
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,420
Shut up

277
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,420
Kneel

278
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,420
Your Majesty

279
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:29,420
Now the war is over

280
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:31,420
but there is no peace

281
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,420
in the north

282
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
The king is in the capital

283
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:37,420
Its thì is never

284
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:39,420
peaceful

285
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,420
His majesty, Chengxi

286
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:43,420
dares not in your favor

287
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:47,420
and keeps you under control

288
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:53,420
This way

289
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Have a quiet mind.

290
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:57,640
This can see the Hmmm,

291
00:16:58,140 --> 00:17:01,320
Have quiet minds.

292
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,660
This can see the Hmmm,

293
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,760
Episode 40

294
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,360
Yan.

295
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,200
Yan.

296
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,900
Yan.

297
00:17:15,260 --> 00:17:15,700
Yan.

298
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,080
Yan.

299
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:20,260
Vik回ates desires the Chi

300
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,160
A guard.

301
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,400
But our work

302
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,700
Is there still time for me to stop?

303
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,700
The general said

304
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,980
that until you are in love,

305
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:31,300
you can't force the King of Qin too far.

306
00:17:31,660 --> 00:17:34,140
So he's the one who's the villain.

307
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,500
The general also said

308
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,220
that Miss Liao Xiang will stop you.

309
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,420
So he asked the court to write it down first.

310
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:46,340
I'm afraid that he won't be able to stop it.

311
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,380
Father, this is for me.

312
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,300
Don't take yourself as a living hell.

313
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:58,180
I'm afraid that because of this,

314
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,260
I'm very angry with Father.

315
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:05,700
What?

316
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,780
Please look at the Crown Prince as a prince.

317
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,220
This is why

318
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,620
I sent someone to the study

319
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,460
for you.

320
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:15,700
What about father?

321
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,060
I'm a rich man.

322
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,460
It's the former King of Qin

323
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,420
who is a good person.

324
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:24,500
Since he received the two gold coins,

325
00:18:24,660 --> 00:18:27,620
the King of Qin has been the second to choose

326
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,060
as the official and the official

327
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,540
to be the King of Qin.

328
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,940
Where's General Peixian?

329
00:18:33,300 --> 00:18:34,500
He's also a rich man.

330
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,780
Do you think

331
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:43,420
His Majesty will force the King of Qin to be the Crown Prince?

332
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,940
nak

333
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,980
Cuiyi won general Weiyang's general's mengyang in parallel.

334
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:50,060
Peixian protected the king's mengyang.

335
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,540
He won the playing against me.

336
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:52,980
Since he's the crown prince

337
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:54,140
among his good people,

338
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,900
I shouldn't be the sound brother.

339
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,980
Peixian is the general who conquered the traitors' army.

340
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,460
They both protect the king.

341
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:04,300
The king tried so hard to make him a regional palace official.

342
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:05,940
So He know

343
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,820
his words.

344
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:11,220
I'll fight you in court.

345
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:14,220
Father expressed his feelings for the crown prince.

346
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,220
There will be no second time for the officials.

347
00:19:18,220 --> 00:19:22,220
So this move was perfect.

348
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,220
He was just taking the center.

349
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:28,220
Father's move was also perfect.

350
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,220
Brother!

351
00:19:34,220 --> 00:19:35,220
Brother, calm down.

352
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,220
Calm down, brother.

353
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,220
Brother, I feel that I'm in the court.

354
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:43,220
It's all gone.

355
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,220
Brother, you were the one who caused the divorce.

356
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,220
It seems that he has already made a plan.

357
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,220
I'm going to see father.

358
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:55,220
Even if I'm alive, I'm going to see father.

359
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:58,220
Brother, think about it.

360
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:02,220
What can you do to make father free from me?

361
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,220
Brother, if you want to go out,

362
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:07,220
why don't you try the bone marrow?

363
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:11,220
Bone marrow?

364
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:16,220
Young master, what should we do?

365
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:18,220
After the big defeat,

366
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,220
Cui Yi actually came back to the Baishui Temple.

367
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:24,220
Cui Yi actually went to the school to invite the emperor.

368
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Li Li was the crown prince.

369
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,220
Since that's the case,

370
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,220
for Li Jun and Li Lai,

371
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,220
it's a good idea to burn the beauty.

372
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:42,220
Uncle, go ask Li Lai yourself.

373
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:44,220
Now he's already in Meijing.

374
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:47,220
Let's see if he can find us.

375
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:52,220
I'm willing to ask Prince Qi

376
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,220
to find us.

377
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
I'm willing to make Prince Qi

378
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,220
suffer for the sake of Prince Qi.

379
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:02,220
Yes.

380
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:27,220
Give it to me.

381
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:28,220
What?

382
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,220
My mother's bracelet.

383
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:41,220
Give it back to me.

384
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,220
Hurry up.

385
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:56,220
Hurry up.

386
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,220
Hurry up.

387
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,220
Thank you for your consideration.

388
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:28,220
Prince Qi, please take care of yourself.

389
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,220
From now on, we'll meet again.

390
00:22:54,220 --> 00:22:57,220
Prince Qi, please take care of yourself.

391
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:30,220
25 days

392
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,220

394

395
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,220
How much?

396
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,220
95

397
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:42,220
Steamed lunch box for her again.

399
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,820
Girls,

400
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:48,220
my formafor left by why?

401
00:23:48,220 --> 00:23:51,220
In the past five years,

402
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:52,580
Today,

403
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,140
Xiao Wo is grown up. He can play the role of a goose.

404
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:54,900
He can't watch the house.

405
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,260
Look at you. You're so generous.

406
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:56,780
I'm not.

407
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:58,140
I was just saying that I don't buy goose.

408
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,060
Why don't you buy goose?

409
00:23:59,060 --> 00:23:59,540
No.

410
00:24:00,620 --> 00:24:01,860
Shi Qi Lang, you're back.

411
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:04,940
Shi Qi Lang.

412
00:24:04,940 --> 00:24:05,540
Shi Qi Lang.

413
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,340
Shi Qi Lang.

414
00:24:06,740 --> 00:24:07,540
Shi Qi Lang.

415
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,060
Shi Qi Lang.

416
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:10,940
What's going on?

417
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,980
From now on, we'll never meet again.

418
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:09,980
Miss.

419
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,300
What's wrong?

420
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:16,380
You're sitting here alone.

421
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,100
What's wrong?

422
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,060
I'm here to see you.

423
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,060
I'm here to see you.

424
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:20,060
I'm here to see you.

425
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:21,060
I'm here to see you.

426
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:22,060
I'm here to see you.

427
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,180
You're sitting here alone.

428
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,180
You don't light up.

429
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,660
You're leaving the house all at once.

430
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,940
I'll get a fire extinguisher.

431
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:33,260
Tao Zi.

432
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:35,660
Don't light up.

433
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,780
I want to sit here for a while.

434
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,620
What's wrong?

435
00:25:42,060 --> 00:25:43,580
You sound a little bit mute.

436
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:45,460
Are you feeling uncomfortable?

437
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:48,580
I'm fine.

438
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,180
I want to sit here for a while.

439
00:25:52,060 --> 00:25:54,660
Come.

440
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:25,960
since he has been Aftheati,

441
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:30,320
I shall take the ports with me.

442
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:32,460
Hide the man himself.

443
00:26:35,620 --> 00:26:38,900
Will you wait for me in privacy?

444
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,580
Leo and Transformation

445
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,720

447
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:49,720

Once a 나가

449
00:26:56,860 --> 00:27:03,860
What kind of

450
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:05,860
I don't understand.

451
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:07,860
How big can it be?

452
00:27:07,860 --> 00:27:09,860
It's not a joke.

453
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,860
Where's Ouyin?

454
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,860
Will you still remember?

455
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:21,860
It's not like a private door.

456
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:25,860
It's hard to know the private bones.

457
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
Dad.

458
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
You just take your time.

459
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
I'm leaving.

460
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I'm leaving.

461
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:11,860
Do you still remember?

462
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:18,860
I miss you so much.

463
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:28,860
Maybe you will be more beautiful.

464
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Miss.

465
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,860
You didn't sleep at night?

466
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:43,860
It's okay.

467
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Take a shower.

468
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
I'll go now.

469
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,860
The new king is here.

470
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:03,860
Your Majesty.

471
00:29:05,860 --> 00:29:07,860
The new king is here.

472
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,860
Dad.

473
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,860
Jun'er.

474
00:29:21,860 --> 00:29:23,860
How did you become like this?

475
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:25,860
Dad.

476
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:29,860
I can't see you anymore.

477
00:29:29,860 --> 00:29:31,860
I'm wronged.

478
00:29:33,860 --> 00:29:35,860
I'm wronged.

479
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:38,860
I didn't kill the king.

480
00:29:38,860 --> 00:29:43,860
I don't know why that Li Ni wanted to kill me 35 times.

481
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,860
You're afraid that my son will die.

482
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:50,860
The future emperor will not let me go.

483
00:29:50,860 --> 00:29:52,860
I remember that.

484
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,860
Li Ni will not let me go.

485
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:56,860
I can't live without you.

486
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,860
I'm so sorry.

487
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:01,860
Send me back to the new king tomorrow.

488
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:04,860
Don't be so upset.

489
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,860
Li Ni is my son.

490
00:30:06,860 --> 00:30:09,860
I'm afraid that he won't do it.

491
00:30:11,860 --> 00:30:12,860
Jun'er.

492
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,860
Don't worry.

493
00:30:14,860 --> 00:30:16,860
I'll get off the job right now.

494
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,860
I'll take your suffering.

495
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:24,860
If Li Ni dares to say that I'll kill him.

496
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,860
You're really amazing.

497
00:30:30,860 --> 00:30:35,860
The new king can't bear to send people to the palace.

498
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,860
But he's going to kill the king.

499
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:41,860
How is it?

500
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:45,860
The king's love for the new king is all taken away by the king.

501
00:30:45,860 --> 00:30:48,860
Now, I can trust him.

502
00:30:48,860 --> 00:30:51,860
He's Zhang Erlang, the son of the master of the house.

503
00:30:51,860 --> 00:30:55,860
I told him to find someone to direct Zhang Erlang.

504
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,860
The king's house is simple.

505
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,860
Only the dream of the king is real.

506
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:03,860
He's very kind.

507
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,860
But he has a few ungrateful sons.

508
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:09,860
He's talented and has a lot of fun.

509
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:14,860
Maybe we can find a way

510
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:17,860
to find the king's secret.

511
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
You won't find it out, right?

512
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,860
Don't worry.

513
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:23,860
You can't do it.

514
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,860
My brother said he was reckless.

515
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,860
He was reckless enough.

516
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:35,860
He said he was bold enough.

517
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:38,860
He was bold enough.

518
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:43,860
I just hope he can have a good luck this time.

519
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,860
Let's make a promise.

520
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:01,860
You know that my son Zheng Wulang is very ungrateful.

521
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:04,860
He knows how to bet money except for drinking.

522
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,860
He scolded me when I was at home.

523
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:12,860
Now he's rich and he wants to take me to his mansion.

524
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,860
He's here to pay for it.

525
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,860
I'm so proud of you.

526
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:21,860
You don't have to be so proud.

527
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:25,860
It's hard for my son Zheng Wulang.

528
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:27,860
He's so proud.

529
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:30,860
He sent me some dried bamboo shoots.

530
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:35,860
He likes dried bamboo shoots.

531
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,860
He doesn't eat them in a surprise.

532
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:40,860
But he's in the Prince's Mansion.

533
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:43,860
Who knows what he likes to eat?

534
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:46,860
What's he going to prepare for him?

535
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:49,860
I always brought dried bamboo shoots from home

536
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,860
to make him some buns.

537
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,860
He's a little wolf.

538
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:58,860
He can eat four buns with rice.

539
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,860
I'm afraid that he'll be spoiled.

540
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:06,860
Put more filling in it.

541
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,860
Okay, I'll help you, grandma.

542
00:33:09,860 --> 00:33:12,860
Grandma, look. Is this how you repay me?

543
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:14,860
You're so fast.

544
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:17,860
You're so gentle and considerate.

545
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,860
You're so virtuous and considerate.

546
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:25,860
Who knows who will marry you?

547
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:31,860
Go.

548
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:33,860
17th Prince!

549
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,860
17th Prince!

550
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,860
Guess who's back?

551
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:43,860
I'm not good at these two days.

552
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:46,860
17th Prince.

553
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:50,860
Why are you back?

554
00:33:50,860 --> 00:33:53,860
What's wrong with your face?

555
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,860
Are you sick?

556
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,860
Maybe I'm not good at it.

557
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,860
I'm just a little bit sick.

558
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:02,860
You're practicing swords every day.

559
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,860
You look so good.

560
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,860
Practice swords every day?

561
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,860
Why are you back?

562
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,860
It's the day of the capital city.

563
00:34:11,860 --> 00:34:13,860
I went to see His Majesty.

564
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,860
He suddenly cut my hair after seeing me.

565
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,860
He said that I was far away from here.

566
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,860
He asked me to stay in the capital for a few days.

567
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,860
I'm ashamed.

568
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,860
Let's go.

569
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:26,860
I'll take you to the phoenix cage to drink.

570
00:34:26,860 --> 00:34:27,860
I'll wash the dishes for you.

571
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,860
It's really fine.

572
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:30,860
I'm fine.

573
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,860
I'm going now.

574
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:43,860
Tao Zi.

575
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:45,860
What's wrong with your face?

576
00:34:45,860 --> 00:34:47,860
You're sick.

577
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,860
I'm fine.

578
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:52,860
But my little sister seems to be sick.

579
00:34:53,860 --> 00:34:54,860
How is she sick?

580
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,860
She's lazy to eat and sleep.

581
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,860
She told me that she's fine.

582
00:35:00,860 --> 00:35:02,860
Is that why she's fine?

583
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:05,860
It's not because of Prince Qin.

584
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,860
My little sister said that Prince Qin must be...

585
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:14,860
Actually, Prince Qin is very strange these days.

586
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:15,860
He's always a good guy.

587
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:17,860
Sometimes I ask him.

588
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:18,860
He doesn't listen to me.

589
00:35:18,860 --> 00:35:19,860
Oh, right.

590
00:35:19,860 --> 00:35:21,860
Didn't Prince Qin get released a few days ago?

591
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:24,860
Prince Qin wanted to enter the palace to discuss with His Majesty.

592
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,860
But he was stopped by General Pei.

593
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:29,860
So he was so depressed these days.

594
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:34,860
They must have had a fight.

595
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:37,860
They had a better fight than the previous time.

596
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:41,860
Tao Zi.

597
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,860
You're so smart.

598
00:35:43,860 --> 00:35:45,860
What can you do this time?

599
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:49,860
I don't have any trouble at all.

600
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:52,860
My little sister is so smart.

601
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:55,860
I can't help you with Prince Qin.

602
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,860
Shi Qing Lang is smart too.

603
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:58,860
He's so smart.

604
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,860
He's also a different person this time.

605
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,860
He must have no way to help you.

606
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:06,860
We're wronged.

607
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,860
We're wronged.

608
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,860
Why hasn't His Highness come back yet?

609
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:25,860
I think he's out of business.

610
00:36:29,860 --> 00:36:30,860
As the saying goes,

611
00:36:30,860 --> 00:36:32,860
the first-class buns

612
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:35,860
should be served to His Highness first.

613
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:38,860
But I haven't made buns for years.

614
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:42,860
I don't know how it tastes.

615
00:36:43,860 --> 00:36:44,860
I don't know.

616
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,860
I don't know.

617
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:46,860
I don't know.

618
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,860
How does it taste?

619
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,860
Forget it.

620
00:36:51,860 --> 00:36:55,860
I won't tell you the truth today.

621
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:58,860
I'll try it first.

622
00:37:00,860 --> 00:37:01,860
Miss Gu,

623
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:03,860
His Highness will be back soon.

624
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,860
You can eat with him.

625
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,860
This is the best way to taste it.

626
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,860
Grandma.

627
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,860
I'll eat.

628
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:21,860
Shi Qing Lang,

629
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,860
I'm going out to see you.

630
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,860
What happened?

631
00:37:24,860 --> 00:37:26,860
Grandma suddenly got a cold.

632
00:37:47,860 --> 00:37:48,860
I made it.

633
00:37:49,860 --> 00:37:52,860
I can't touch the old man's pulse anymore.

634
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:54,860
Your Highness,

635
00:37:55,860 --> 00:37:57,860
please be kind to me.

636
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,860
What's the fuss?

637
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,860
How can it be so fast?

638
00:38:08,860 --> 00:38:09,860
Your Highness,

639
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,860
the old man was the oldest.

640
00:38:13,860 --> 00:38:15,860
He had a sudden illness.

641
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:17,860
When I came here,

642
00:38:18,860 --> 00:38:20,860
he passed away.

643
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,860
Maybe it's a new disease.

644
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:29,860
He can't be cured now.

645
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:34,860
Doctor,

646
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
this letter.

647
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,860
It's okay in the afternoon.

648
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,860
Sometimes it's effective.

649
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,860
He suddenly said he had a chest pain.

650
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,860
Then he fainted.

651
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,860
I went to see Brother Bao.

652
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:47,860
I invited a doctor.

653
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,860
The doctor came.

654
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,860
His Highness also came.

655
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,860
He's old again.

656
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,860
You're too polite.

657
00:38:57,860 --> 00:39:00,860
Grandma treats me like a family.

658
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:04,860
I also treat her as my family.

659
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,860
I didn't expect it.

660
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:09,860
I was so lucky.

661
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:11,860
When I came here,

662
00:39:11,860 --> 00:39:13,860
he made me a bun.

663
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,860
He said he loved it the most.

664
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,860
He wanted to eat it together.

665
00:39:19,860 --> 00:39:20,860
He didn't like it.

666
00:39:20,860 --> 00:39:22,860
I tried it myself.

667
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:38,860
I'm sorry.

668
00:39:41,860 --> 00:39:42,860
I'm sorry.

669
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:46,860
I'll take Miss Gu with me.

670
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:50,860
Let's talk about the nurse.

671
00:39:58,860 --> 00:39:59,860
Miss Gu,

672
00:39:59,860 --> 00:40:00,860
this way.

673
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:08,860
Miss Gu,

674
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:09,860
this way.

675
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:10,860
Miss Gu,

676
00:40:10,860 --> 00:40:11,860
this way.

677
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,860
Miss Gu,

678
00:40:12,860 --> 00:40:13,860
this way.

679
00:40:13,860 --> 00:40:14,860
Miss Gu,

680
00:40:14,860 --> 00:40:15,860
this way.

681
00:40:15,860 --> 00:40:16,860
Miss Gu,

682
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:17,860
this way.

683
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:18,860
Miss Gu,

684
00:40:18,860 --> 00:40:19,860
this way.

685
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,860
Miss Gu,

686
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:21,860
this way.

687
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:22,860
Miss Gu,

688
00:40:22,860 --> 00:40:23,860
this way.

689
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:24,860
Miss Gu,

690
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:25,860
this way.

691
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:26,860
Miss Gu,

692
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,860
this way.

693
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Miss Gu,

694
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,860
this way.

695
00:40:29,860 --> 00:40:30,860
Miss Gu,

696
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:31,860
this way.

697
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,860
Miss Gu,

698
00:40:32,860 --> 00:40:33,860
this way.

699
00:40:33,860 --> 00:40:34,860
Miss Gu,

700
00:40:34,860 --> 00:40:35,860
this way.

701
00:40:35,860 --> 00:40:37,860
I didn't think that

702
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,860
now,

703
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,860
I'm really ugly.

704
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,860
But I can't bear to throw it away.

705
00:40:49,860 --> 00:40:50,860
Miss Gu.

706
00:40:54,860 --> 00:40:55,860
Miss Gu,

707
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:56,860
what's wrong?

708
00:40:56,860 --> 00:40:57,860
Prince Qin's mother

709
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,860
suddenly died of illness.

710
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:07,860
She's going to be sad.

711
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:09,860
Yes.

712
00:41:10,860 --> 00:41:11,860
Miss,

713
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,860
do you want to go see her?

714
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:17,860
I...

715
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,860
Senior Su,

716
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:35,860
I've seen a good view.

717
00:41:35,860 --> 00:41:37,860
I've made a decision for you.

718
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,860
I'll send it to you when I'm done.

719
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:41,860
I've also made a decision for you

720
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,860
for my mother's dowry.

721
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:44,860
My master also came to calculate it.

722
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:46,860
He said that he would send you seven days.

723
00:41:46,860 --> 00:41:48,860
But he can't stay at home.

724
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:49,860
So tonight,

725
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:50,860
I'm going to send you

726
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:52,860
to the position of the Buddha.

727
00:41:57,860 --> 00:41:58,860
Don't be sad.

728
00:41:58,860 --> 00:41:59,860
You're so cruel.

729
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:05,860
renovated

730
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,860
with Jade bombing

731
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,860
given by the Buddha.

732
00:42:30,860 --> 00:42:31,860
When I was six,

733
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:33,200
I feltKim don't feel well,

734
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:35,320
and I personally went there.

735
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:55,300
Shi Qi Lang.

736
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:57,200
I'm acting.

737
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:58,460
The doctor from therigid hospital

738
00:42:58,780 --> 00:42:59,580
is preparing for you.

739
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,580
Are you really going to open the coffin?

740
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:04,580
Open the coffin.

741
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:07,580
Yes.

742
00:43:59,580 --> 00:44:04,580
A Little Thing Called First Love

743
00:44:18,580 --> 00:44:19,580
Miss.

744
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,580
Miss.

745
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:27,580
Miss.

746
00:44:30,580 --> 00:44:32,580
It's weird. Where is she?

747
00:44:32,580 --> 00:44:33,580
Miss.

748
00:44:33,580 --> 00:44:35,580
Where did you go so early?

749
00:44:35,580 --> 00:44:36,580
Taozi.

750
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:37,580
Go tell Xie Chang'er.

751
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:38,580
If the King of Qin

752
00:44:38,580 --> 00:44:40,580
is in a hurry to leave the house

753
00:44:40,580 --> 00:44:42,580
or have other actions,

754
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,580
I'll tell you right away.

755
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,580
Is something wrong?

756
00:44:48,580 --> 00:44:49,580
No.

757
00:44:49,580 --> 00:44:51,580
It's just a case.

758
00:44:52,580 --> 00:44:53,580
Okay. I'll go right away.

759
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:01,580
The King of Qin

760
00:45:14,580 --> 00:45:16,580
The son of Nailiang's son, Zheng Wulang,

761
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:17,580
sent it to me.

762
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,580
The one who sent it to me was Zha Erlang.

763
00:45:19,580 --> 00:45:20,580
It was already taken.

764
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
Zha Erlang is the son of the new king's housekeeper.

765
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,580
The palace maid said that

766
00:45:24,580 --> 00:45:27,580
because Zheng Wulang heard her mother say it,

767
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:29,580
he liked to eat it.

768
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:30,580
So he bought it

769
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:31,580
and bought it for Zheng Wulang

770
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
to his friend Wang Si in the city.

771
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:34,580
He took Zheng Wulang

772
00:45:34,580 --> 00:45:36,580
and sent it to his house

773
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:38,580
to greet you.

774
00:45:38,580 --> 00:45:39,580
Zha Erlang was old.

775
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:40,580
Zheng Wulang didn't know that

776
00:45:40,580 --> 00:45:42,580
Zheng Wulang was poisoned.

777
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:44,580
But the one who was sent by the new king's housekeeper

778
00:45:44,580 --> 00:45:45,580
killed the man in front of the entrance.

779
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:46,580
He was killed by the man in the river.

780
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:48,060
The villagers of Wanlian are

781
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:49,580
fighting for the man in the river.

782
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,580
Why is the big sister

783
00:45:52,580 --> 00:45:54,580
dancing?

784
00:45:54,580 --> 00:45:55,580
I don't know if she's a brother

785
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,580
or a wife.

786
00:45:57,580 --> 00:45:59,580
It's all because of that grandma.

787
00:45:59,580 --> 00:46:00,580
She's old.

788
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,580
Why are you talking about the buns?

789
00:46:02,580 --> 00:46:03,580
What buns are you eating?

790
00:46:04,580 --> 00:46:06,580
Or else, you'll be poisoned by Li Ni.

791
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:08,580
You're a waste of medicine.

792
00:46:10,580 --> 00:46:11,580
Your Highness, wait for me.

793
00:46:11,580 --> 00:46:12,580
Get out of the way.

794
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:13,580
Get out of the way.

795
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,580
Your Highness.

796
00:46:14,580 --> 00:46:15,580
Your Highness.

797
00:46:15,580 --> 00:46:16,580
What's wrong with you?

798
00:46:16,580 --> 00:46:17,580
Are you crazy?

799
00:46:17,580 --> 00:46:18,580
Your Highness.

800
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:19,580
The man who took Zheng Wulang

801
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:20,580
killed him.

802
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:21,580
What?

803
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:24,580
The big sister of the mountain is still alive.

804
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:26,580
How dare you escape from the palace?

805
00:46:26,580 --> 00:46:27,580
How dare you lie to me?

806
00:46:27,580 --> 00:46:28,580
How dare you talk nonsense?

807
00:46:30,580 --> 00:46:31,580
Get out of the way.

808
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,580
What do you want to do?

809
00:46:32,580 --> 00:46:33,580
Don't think that

810
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,580
you can't find the man

811
00:46:34,580 --> 00:46:35,580
who killed the man in front of the entrance.

812
00:46:36,580 --> 00:46:37,580
You poisoned the man

813
00:46:37,580 --> 00:46:38,580
who killed the man

814
00:46:38,580 --> 00:46:39,580
who took Zheng Wulang.

815
00:46:39,580 --> 00:46:40,580
You killed the man in front of the entrance.

816
00:46:41,580 --> 00:46:42,580
How dare you talk nonsense?

817
00:46:42,580 --> 00:46:43,580
Why are you talking nonsense?

818
00:46:43,580 --> 00:46:44,580
Why should I...

819
00:46:44,580 --> 00:46:45,580
Why should I kill your grandma?

820
00:46:45,580 --> 00:46:46,580
Because you want to poison me.

821
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:53,580
Your Highness.

822
00:46:53,580 --> 00:46:54,580
Your Highness.

823
00:46:54,580 --> 00:46:55,580
Your Highness.

824
00:46:55,580 --> 00:46:56,580
If you don't want to fight the enemy,

825
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,580
why don't we go to the court?

826
00:46:57,580 --> 00:46:58,580
We'll be in the court

827
00:46:58,580 --> 00:46:59,580
and we'll be in the palace

828
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:00,580
and we'll be in the palace.

829
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:01,580
In the palace?

830
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:02,580
They're trying to harm the man

831
00:47:02,580 --> 00:47:03,580
who killed Zheng Wulang.

832
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,580
They'll be killed in a few days.

833
00:47:05,580 --> 00:47:06,580
How can we be in the palace?

834
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:08,580
Get out of the way.

835
00:47:08,580 --> 00:47:09,580
Your Highness.

836
00:47:09,580 --> 00:47:10,580
Your Highness.

837
00:47:10,580 --> 00:47:11,580
Please repeat the fact.

838
00:47:11,580 --> 00:47:12,580
Your Highness.

839
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:13,580
The king wants to poison you.

840
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:14,580
We'll be in the palace

841
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:15,580
and we'll be in front of the officials.

842
00:47:15,580 --> 00:47:16,580
We'll have to ask him to explain it to us.

843
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:18,580
But if you kill him,

844
00:47:18,580 --> 00:47:20,580
you'll be punished.

845
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,580
It's all about the Iron Formation.

846
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:23,580
If you kill him,

847
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,580
you'll be punished.

848
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,580
Your Highness.

849
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,580
If you kill him,

850
00:47:27,580 --> 00:47:28,580
how will His Majesty punish you

851
00:47:28,580 --> 00:47:30,580
and hate us?

852
00:47:30,580 --> 00:47:32,580
Why didn't you stop His Highness?

853
00:47:36,580 --> 00:47:37,580
Shiqing Lang.

854
00:47:38,580 --> 00:47:39,580
For the sake of the Iron Formation,

855
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:40,580
you have to calm down.

856
00:47:41,580 --> 00:47:42,580
Shiqing Lang.

857
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:56,580
Shiqing Lang.

858
00:48:55,580 --> 00:48:57,580
My gentle love,

859
00:48:57,580 --> 00:49:02,580
I want to stay for you.

860
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:05,580
If we love each other,

861
00:49:05,580 --> 00:49:08,580
we'll be in the same world.

862
00:49:08,580 --> 00:49:11,580
I'll live for you

863
00:49:11,580 --> 00:49:15,580
from now on.

864
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:20,580
I'll wait for my time

865
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:27,580
to come back.

866
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,580
If we love each other,

867
00:49:31,580 --> 00:49:35,580
we'll be in the same world.

868
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:38,580
I'll live for you

869
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:42,580
from now on.

870
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,580
I'll live for you

871
00:49:47,580 --> 00:49:52,580
from now on.

872
00:49:52,580 --> 00:49:55,580
I'll wait for your time

873
00:49:55,580 --> 00:49:58,580
to come back.

874
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:01,580
I'll live for you

875
00:50:01,580 --> 00:50:05,580
from now on.

876
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:10,580
I'll wait for your time

877
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:16,580
to come back.

878
00:50:17,580 --> 00:50:21,580
I'll wait for your time

879
00:50:21,580 --> 00:50:25,580
to come back.
