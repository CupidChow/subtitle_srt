1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,180
For Cat shocked that he was deceived.

2
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,740
Two years later

3
00:00:23,740 --> 00:00:24,520
One road ahead

4
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:27,260
For a sign that she went wrong

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:28,080
Forge

6
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,080
I will never forget

7
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:05,580
The sky is so clear and clear

8
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,580
The sky is so clear and clear

9
00:01:07,580 --> 00:01:10,580
The sky is so clear and clear

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:13,580
The wind is blowing in the wind

11
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,580
The wind is blowing in the wind

12
00:01:15,580 --> 00:01:17,580
The sky is so clear and clear

13
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,580
The sky is so clear and clear

14
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,580
The sky is so clear and clear

15
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,580
The sky is so clear and clear

16
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:26,580
The sky is so clear and clear

17
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:28,580
The conferenceaniang and bravado

18
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:31,080
Once our lightwho is with you

19
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:36,080
Who abodes me

20
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:44,080
Is someone I just want to meet

21
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,960
Yixing

22
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,520
Yixing

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,320
Yes.

24
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:04,520
Your Highness,

25
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,480
the west gate of the capital is closed.

26
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
I lead the troops to the east,

27
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,440
you lead the troops to the west.

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:12,120
The remaining troops will go north and south.

29
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,360
Give me a inch of your color.

30
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,240
Yes.

31
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,480
Go.

32
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,540
Judging which謝謝 is better,

33
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:29,420
I'll kill all the soldiers assigned to come to Obe-M leaning his aura.

34
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,180
I'll use a cloth to carry him.

35
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:50,540
ETG

36
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,220
Todo.

37
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,480
ин

38
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,520
Lun

39
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,360
I need you.

40
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
Something's not right.

41
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,120
Nothing is wrong.

42
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,720
I've seen this kind of thing before in the desert.

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,320
It's not like that at all!

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,320
Since you don't want to go on the road,

45
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:35,160
don't mind me.

46
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,280
What do you want to do?

47
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:40,720
I thought you were a good dog.

48
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:42,360
I wanted to keep you a whole world.

49
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:46,040
But you didn't want to eat the poison.

50
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,480
Now, you have to use other methods

51
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,760
to take you on the road.

52
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,560
You want to kill me?

53
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,000
Why?

54
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,080
You're too greedy.

55
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,320
You just want to kill us

56
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,600
and torture us.

57
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:06,440
Now, you want to take the daughter of Cui Yi to the high-ranking consort.

58
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,880
Then, go to the imperial court together.

59
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,000
You just asked me

60
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,360
why Shu didn't do it with me.

61
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,600
I told you

62
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,360
that Shu went crazy.

63
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:18,760
But actually,

64
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,400
Shu didn't go to the imperial court.

65
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
So what?

66
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,480
He doesn't know where we are.

67
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,800
He can come to save you?

68
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,320
But he knows

69
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:32,680
that Gu Xiang has already colluded with Sun Jing.

70
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,960
He also knows that I used Gu Xiang to frame Cui Yi

71
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,240
to destroy the Cui family.

72
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:38,760
He knows

73
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,000
that you're buried in all the secret rooms in the Xie Chang Jin.

74
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,200
And all the bodies of all the people who have been buried in the north of the country.

75
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,240
You're too greedy to kill me.

76
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,920
Of course, I can't believe you're talking to me.

77
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,200
Am I right?

78
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,040
Where is Shu?

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,240
Tell me.

80
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,000
Give me the medicine.

81
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,840
I'll take it to the imperial court.

82
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:07,880
Your Majesty.

83
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:09,360
The Crown Prince ordered the imperial army

84
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,360
to close all the gates in the Xie Chang Jin.

85
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,120
What?

86
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,920
The Crown Prince ordered

87
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:18,640
that even if His Majesty had your order,

88
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,400
no one would be allowed to leave the city.

89
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,840
Crown Prince.

90
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,920
You're going to rebel?

91
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,200
Your Majesty, you need to think of a way.

92
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:33,560
Crown Prince.

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
This is indeed a mistake.

94
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,560
You're doing this all of a sudden.

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,000
You can't tell me.

96
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,720
It's too late.

97
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
It's too late.

98
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,160
Since we arrived in the Xie Chang Jin,

99
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,960
all the people who have been buried in the Xie Army

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,080
have been replaced by the imperial guards.

101
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,560
If this traitor wants to kill me,

102
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:07,120
I will have no one to help me.

103
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:15,640
I'll kill you.

104
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,360
No matter how you approach me,

105
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,400
I won't tell you where Shu is.

106
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,080
Shu and I have long been in the same country.

107
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:31,080
If anything happens to us,

108
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,440
I won't be allowed to leave.

109
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:34,320
After 12th Mountain,

110
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,120
he will leave the city

111
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
and take me to his life.

112
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,600
I'll take all the blame.

113
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,720
I didn't expect

114
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,920
to have the dog that helps me to release the sheep.

115
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,760
Now, the owner of Yaoji is here.

116
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,600
You're the first to come out.

117
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,120
You have no words.

118
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,160
If I don't protect you,

119
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,520
I'm afraid I'll die long ago.

120
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,160
Who are you to do this to me?

121
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,360
Let me and Sui Lin go.

122
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,760
Prepare to welcome us on the way.

123
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,640
Take our safety.

124
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,600
Follow us.

125
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,920
These two are the people who have been exposed.

126
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,960
They are all the most powerful warriors.

127
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:16,280
They can kill the wolf who hates you

128
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,000
and kill the enemy.

129
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,480
Do you think you can still fight with us?

130
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:26,400
If you don't tell Shu where he is,

131
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
I'll kill him now.

132
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,520
Don't kill him.

133
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,480
My lord.

134
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,680
Don't kill him.

135
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,160
My lord.

136
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:42,640
Move aside.

137
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:47,520
My lord.

138
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,080
The guards are already in the prison.

139
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,840
Nothing happened.

140
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,200
The three tribes are already closed.

141
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,400
They are being locked up in the north and south.

142
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,440
We'll meet at the next exit.

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,160
Yes.

144
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's go.

145
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:56,720
Yes.

146
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,120
Greetings, my lord.

147
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,120
Get out of the way.

148
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:05,080
Get out of the way.

149
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,920
Get out of the way.

150
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:08,920
The crown prince ordered

151
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:12,040
to close all the gates of the west capital.

152
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,280
And he said

153
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,360
the imperial decree can't be issued.

154
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,800
Now he's still in the prison.

155
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,360
My lord.

156
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,960
What should we do?

157
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:23,200
My lord.

158
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
The crown prince's resignation is indeed abnormal.

159
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,080
He doesn't want to say anything else.

160
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:28,640
He has to be in the prison first

161
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:30,200
when he's in the prison.

162
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,200
Besides, the big thing about closing the gates

163
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,080
is that it's more difficult for the people to talk.

164
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:37,800
Is it because of the

165
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,320
emergency situation?

166
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,000
The crown prince can't stop it.

167
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,520
So he's in the prison.

168
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,800
So what's the problem?

169
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,120
That's why the crown prince

170
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,400
closed all the gates.

171
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:51,920
My lord.

172
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,640
We'd better ask the crown prince back

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,000
and then we'll know everything.

174
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:02,840
Wu Xiang.

175
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,360
Your Highness.

176
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,440
Do you

177
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,760
want to rebel?

178
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,800
Your Majesty.

179
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:18,920
It's a close call.

180
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,120
We should ask the crown prince back as soon as possible

181
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,880
to know what's going on.

182
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,480
All right.

183
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,200
Let the crown prince in.

184
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:31,600
Yes.

185
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,300
Damn you.

186
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:35,080
Our royal clansnięta

187
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:50,340
and

188
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:58,840
Brother Liang.

189
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,200
Brother Liang.

190
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:03,480
Brother.

191
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:05,080
What are you doing?

192
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,000
Yes.

193
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,480
This is a gift from the Prime Minister.

194
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:12,200
It's a rose.

195
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,280
This rose is so delicious.

196
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,840
Your Highness.

197
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,320
I've searched this place carefully.

198
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
There's no need to worry.

199
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,240
Keep searching.

200
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,920
Yes.

201
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,520
Search.

202
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,840
I told you before.

203
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,080
If you dare to touch him with a cold-blooded cat,

204
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,480
I'll go to hell immediately.

205
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
In this way,

206
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,600
I'll never know where where he is.

207
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,600
Tomorrow,

208
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,360
you and your men

209
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,560
won't be able to escape any time soon.

210
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,680
A lot of you will be killed for treason.

211
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,720
Do you think that we

212
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,680
have nothing against you at all?

213
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,760
Do you think that we can

214
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,480
expose all the lost hire to you?

215
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,320
You...

216
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,280
You...

217
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,960
Your uncle knows the answer.

218
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:34,480
It's just a trick.

219
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:35,880
He'll destroy it.

220
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,960
I can let you go.

221
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,080
But this woman

222
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,800
must die.

223
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,760
Have you seen this person?

224
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:47,560
No.

225
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:48,320
Have you seen this person?

226
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,040
No.

227
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,560
Have you seen this person?

228
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:50,960
No.

229
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,600
Have you seen this person?

230
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:52,200
No.

231
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,360
Have you seen this person?

232
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:55,360
Have you seen this person?

233
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,080
No.

234
00:11:56,080 --> 00:11:57,120
Have you seen this person?

235
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,760
Your Highness, I'm sick.

236
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:01,360
No.

237
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,640
Your Highness.

238
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,280
No.

239
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,000
Your Highness.

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:05,960
Your Highness.

241
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,920
His Majesty ordered you to enter the palace immediately.

242
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,200
I'm going to see His Majesty now.

243
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:09,800
Go away.

244
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:11,480
Your Highness.

245
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,120
Your Highness.

246
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:13,640
His Majesty ordered you to enter the palace.

247
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,440
Go in.

248
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,600
House resonator.

249
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
Your Highness,

250
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,000
do you plan to painful medicine with him?

251
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,120
What's good about this woman?

252
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:47,800
She'll go with you when she wakes up.

253
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,040
She's willing.

254
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,160
I'm so lucky.

255
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,640
How could I marry Li Ni?

256
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,120
She forced you to do that.

257
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:57,640
She likes me.

258
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,000
I don't like you.

259
00:12:59,200 --> 00:12:59,880
I suggest you

260
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,080
not to hide yourself.

261
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,160
You're willing to do that.

262
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,600
No.

263
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:11,920
No.

264
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:15,080
I like you.

265
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:21,560
Aying.

266
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,240
You like me, right?

267
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,160
Aying.

268
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:28,880
Aying.

269
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:31,320
Your Majesty.

270
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,920
Your Majesty.

271
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,040
Where's the crown prince?

272
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:36,480
I can't.

273
00:13:36,680 --> 00:13:38,000
The crown prince said...

274
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,040
What did he say?

275
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,440
The crown prince said

276
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,680
he has something urgent.

277
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,200
He's going to the palace without any reason.

278
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,440
His Majesty...

279
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:50,680
I...

280
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:53,240
I'm here.

281
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,360
Excuse me.

282
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,080
Have you seen this man?

283
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,520
No.

284
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,240
Your Highness.

285
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,560
The Imperial Courtyard has searched

286
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,480
and found nothing.

287
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:12,480
Let's go.

288
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,160
Yes.

289
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,080
Have you seen this man?

290
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:16,720
No.

291
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,200
Have you seen this man?

292
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:17,920
Have you seen this man?

293
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:18,360
No.

294
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:18,920
No.

295
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:20,640
Have you seen this man?

296
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:21,240
No.

297
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,800
Have you seen this man?

298
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,520
No.

299
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,400
How's it going?

300
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:31,920
You two can only live one.

301
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,280
I think

302
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,240
I can't stand to die for him.

303
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,200
He doesn't like you anyway.

304
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,280
It's better to kill him

305
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
as soon as possible.

306
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,560
Anyway,

307
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,560
you've taken the medicine I've received.

308
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:46,360
You dare not to take it.

309
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,560
But this woman

310
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,160
is not allowed to die.

311
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:52,600
Good.

312
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:57,880
As long as you promise me

313
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:00,640
that you'll take the medicine,

314
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,080
I can kill her.

315
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:07,560
But...

316
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,480
But...

317
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,440
I'll kill her myself.

318
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:14,840
Good.

319
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,080
Good.

320
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,920
The hunter we're talking about

321
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:19,680
will kill the hunter

322
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,800
who met the ungrateful man.

323
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,880
I hate to see the blood.

324
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,120
I'll leave a message to him.

325
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,800
Don't be heartless.

326
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,280
Okay.

327
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,720
This is the best medicine we've received.

328
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,960
Without pain,

329
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,080
you'll die.

330
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,520
You won't be heartless.

331
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,920
Hurry up.

332
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,120
Wan Ying.

333
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,480
Don't be afraid.

334
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,400
This medicine won't hurt you.

335
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,000
You won't be sad either.

336
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:07,440
Although today,

337
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,760
we have to say goodbye.

338
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,400
But if there's a next life,

339
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,640
as long as you take the medicine,

340
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:44,640
I can let youIF

341
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:47,480
go home tomorrow.

342
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,480
I'm thinking of the person who lives for you

343
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,480
I remember the years have passed

344
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,480
I will turn back to you

345
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,480
Hurry up

346
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
Don't be late

347
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Don't be afraid

348
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Don't be afraid

349
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,480
I'm afraid

350
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:11,480
But I love you

351
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:17,480
I want to hold on to the gentleness of the moment

352
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I want to live for you for this life

353
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,480
When the memory is silent, my heart is silent

354
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:31,480
I forgot to leave this life

355
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
Ma Ying

356
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:34,480
Ma Ying

357
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
Ma Ying

358
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:40,480
I'm by your side

359
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Ma Ying

360
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Ma Ying

361
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
Ma Ying, don't be afraid

362
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:50,480
Ma Ying

363
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Ma Ying

364
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Ma Ying

365
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,480
Don't be afraid

366
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,480
Ma Ying

367
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
Ma Ying

368
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,480
Ma Ying

369
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Ma Ying

370
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,480
Ma Ying

371
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
Ma Ying

372
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,480
Ma Ying

373
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,460
Tell me.

374
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:40,380
I can't do the same blood.

375
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,740
I'd die very quick.

376
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,420
Eat less rice.

377
00:18:53,380 --> 00:18:54,380
Pay task separately.

378
00:18:54,780 --> 00:18:57,300

�리

380
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,420
Your Highness.

381
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,020
Your Highness.

382
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:09,740
Your Highness.

383
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:12,220
His Majesty ordered you to enter the palace immediately.

384
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,860
I said I have something important to do.

385
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,940
Your Highness,

386
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:16,780
His Majesty's order is to leave immediately.

387
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:18,740
If His Highness doesn't want to leave with me,

388
00:19:19,060 --> 00:19:19,980
I can only

389
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:21,540
let him go.

390
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:29,140
The Taoist spirit is here.

391
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,380
The Taoist spirit is here.

392
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,060
Don't touch me!

393
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,140
Go tell His Majesty

394
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,660
that you don't understand me.

395
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,660
Otherwise, I'll kill you.

396
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:00,140
Get out of the way.

397
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:01,140
Yes.

398
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:02,420
Get out.

399
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,260
Go...

400
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:06,700
Go.

401
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:32,480
a thief's

402
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:38,480
Take her

403
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:40,280
the murderer

404
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,420
has come and reported

405
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:43,320

406
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,680
a pretty and young

407
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:45,760
He looks cataclysmal

408
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,500
and all our finding people are similar

409
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:48,900
And he has a knife wound

410
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,260
and sees his sword

411
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,020
go to Yizhuang

412
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,400

413
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,520
let's go

414
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:55,820

415
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,520
we have to change our methods

416
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:01,820
bridge

417
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:23,420
the dial

418
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,580
A'Ying.

419
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,980
I am sorry.

420
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
I...

421
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:29,640
tile

422
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:33,720
but

423
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:41,040
I

424
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:42,520
go back to

425
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,860
find

426
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,700

00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:51,400
why Ma

428
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,320
Why hasn't he come yet?

429
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:53,720
Hurry up and let him come here.

430
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:54,840
Come here quickly.

431
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:57,920
Ying.

432
00:23:58,360 --> 00:23:58,960
Ying.

433
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:00,040
Are you okay?

434
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,120
Are you okay?

435
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,240
Don't be scared.

436
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:02,920
Ying.

437
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:03,840
Ying.

438
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:05,400
Wake up.

439
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:06,000
Ying.

440
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:06,840
Ying.

441
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:08,320
Ying.

442
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,400
Ying.

443
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:10,800
Your Highness.

444
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,960
Your Highness.

445
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:52,480
Your Highness.

446
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,240
Your Highness.

447
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:58,880
Your Highness.

448
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,640
I don't know what your highness is doing.

449
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,960
For a great seasons,

450
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:06,600
Her Highness has been promoted.

451
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:09,320
His Highness

452
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,360
has already moved the thrones of Princess Consort.

453
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:15,160
The power of herna

454
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,600
has fell from their blade.

455
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,440
Then don't worry,

456
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,280
if you were sad bad enough,

457
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,600
you just need to shake your stomach.

458
00:25:27,960 --> 00:25:29,400
These are young men.

459
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:30,800
I'm the eldest man.

460
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,760
How are you going to cover a throne?

461
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,000
What are you saying?

462
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,440
The crown prince won't die.

463
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,640
He just passed away.

464
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,080
Eat some people,

465
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,560
He's gone mad.

466
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,240
His Highness is still alive.

467
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
He's still alive.

468
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,560
Get out of here.

469
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,560
Save him.

470
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:00,840
Save him.

471
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:01,840
Your Highness.

472
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,880
His Highness was in the army for years.

473
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,800
When the Crown Princess Consort Bao came back,

474
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:08,280
His Highness should have known what he was thinking.

475
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,160
Get up. Get up.

476
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:11,840
What did you say?

477
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,760
I understand.

478
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:13,760
Let me explain.

479
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:14,560
Your Highness.

480
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:15,640
I understand.

481
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,520
He won't die.

482
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:17,520
He won't die.

483
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:19,280
He won't die.

484
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:20,280
Your Highness, please spare me.

485
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,480
Get up.

486
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,120
Get up.

487
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:25,760
Don't curse him.

488
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:26,840
Get up.

489
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,480
Your Highness.

490
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,960
Put down the prisoner

491
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,280
and erase him.

492
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:35,160
Get up.

493
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:37,840
Get up.

494
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,160
Bring him up.

495
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,480
Get up.

496
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,960
Your Highness.

497
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:49,360
Save me.

498
00:26:50,280 --> 00:26:53,680
Xiaoqin, pleaseック

499
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:56,000
Group

500
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:13,080
Some more

501
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,840
Kun

502
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:17,680
Come on, Kun

503
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,840
Thank you

504
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,840
Let's go.

505
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,040
Fine.

506
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:51,680
Stay here for long.

507
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,160
Ai Ying.

508
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,000
Wake up.

509
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,720
If you dare not wake up.

510
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,160
then I'll think of this as a dead end.

511
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:18,680
Go ahead.

512
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:50,160
What should I do to wake you up?

513
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:58,960
As long as you wake up, I'll do whatever you want.

514
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Come on. Wake up.

515
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,360
Look at me, okay?

516
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:33,160
Didn't we agree?

517
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,160
We have to teach this painting together.

518
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,160
Wake up, okay?

519
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,160
I'll do whatever you want.

520
00:29:41,160 --> 00:29:43,160
I'll do whatever you want.

521
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,160
I'll do whatever you want.

522
00:29:46,160 --> 00:29:48,160
Wake up, okay?

523
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:55,160
Why don't you wake up?

524
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,160
Why don't you wake up?

525
00:30:04,160 --> 00:30:06,160
Why?

526
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,160
I know.

527
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,160
It must be because of the bad winter.

528
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:20,160
That's why you don't want to wake up.

529
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:22,160
Yes.

530
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,160
I don't like Zhang Lei either.

531
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,160
I'm going to Leyou Garden.

532
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,160
A Yan.

533
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,160
I'm going to Leyou Garden, okay?

534
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,160
But you have to promise me.

535
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:44,160
You have to promise me that you will wake up.

536
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,160
I promise.

537
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:50,160
I promise.

538
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,160
Brother Liang.

539
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,160
Brother Liang, the Crown Prince is crazy.

540
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,160
Brother Liang, the Crown Prince is crazy.

541
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:11,160
The Crown Prince is carrying the Crown Prince back.

542
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:13,160
He sent many doctors to see him.

543
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,160
He said the Crown Prince had been crazy.

544
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:16,160
But the Crown Prince refused to believe it.

545
00:31:16,160 --> 00:31:18,160
He said the Crown Prince was just dizzy.

546
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,160
He drove the doctors out.

547
00:31:20,160 --> 00:31:21,160
He made them dizzy.

548
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:23,160
He said they couldn't even see the Crown Prince alive.

549
00:31:26,160 --> 00:31:27,160
It seems

550
00:31:27,160 --> 00:31:29,160
the Crown Prince is going to be sad for a while.

551
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,160
I didn't expect the Crown Prince to suddenly be so crazy.

552
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:36,160
Take away the filial piety on your face.

553
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,160
The Crown Prince is crazy.

554
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:44,160
The Crown Prince is sad.

555
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:46,160
Let's be happy here.

556
00:31:47,160 --> 00:31:48,160
What do you mean?

557
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,160
Yes.

558
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,160
A Yan.

559
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,160
Do you remember

560
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,160
when we first came to Leyou Garden?

561
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,160
It was here.

562
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,160
You're not good at singing.

563
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:40,160
Good.

564
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,160
I was a little bit out of tune.

565
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,160
Then you let me sing.

566
00:32:44,160 --> 00:32:45,160
But it's good.

567
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:46,160
Really?

568
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:49,160
Then I'll sing it seriously.

569
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,160
Okay.

570
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,160
Then I'll sing it seriously.

571
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
I'll sing it for you.

572
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,160
Okay?

573
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:07,160
But you have to promise me.

574
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:11,160
After I finish singing,

575
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,160
you can come over.

576
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:16,160
I'll sing it for you.

577
00:34:15,160 --> 00:34:16,160
You can come over.

578
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,160
Come over.

579
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:42,160
How nice it is to be with me again.

580
00:34:43,160 --> 00:34:44,160
If I lose,

581
00:34:46,160 --> 00:34:47,160
you open your eyes.

582
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:50,160
That's you.

583
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,160
If I lose,

584
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,160
you don't open your eyes.

585
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,160
That's me.

586
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,160
I lost.

587
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,160
I lost.

588
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,160
I lost.

589
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:14,160
One.

590
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:18,160
Two.

591
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,160
Three.

592
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,160
Four.

593
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,160
Five.

594
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,160
Six.

595
00:35:47,160 --> 00:35:48,160
Seven.

596
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Eight.

597
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,160
Nine.

598
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,160
Eight.

599
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,160
Let me smell it.

600
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,160
Okay, attention.

601
00:36:22,160 --> 00:36:23,160
Great!

602
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,160
Assistant Chief!

603
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,160
Tom,

604
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,160
I'm back.

605
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,160
Let's go and dance with each other.

606
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:34,160
Take a seat.

607
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,160
Alright.

608
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,160
I'm dead.

609
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:41,160
My mother is dead too.

610
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,160
They left me.

611
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:52,160
I'm so scared.

612
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,160
I'm really scared.

613
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm really scared.

614
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
If you can't wake up,

615
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:23,160
if you can't wake up,

616
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,160
it won't happen.

617
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
You can't wake up.

618
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:11,160
The second bowl is that green egg.

619
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:16,160
It's made of iron and made of iron.

620
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:21,160
It's not like the girl's leg.

621
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:26,160
The third bowl is that golden sand egg.

622
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Golden sand egg made of golden sand.

623
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,160
Stop.

624
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,160
I thought you can't defeat the enemy

625
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:48,160
with a thousand-year-old skill.

626
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:50,160
But you can't even defeat the fish.

627
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:52,160
I didn't expect our Shi Jilang

628
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,160
to catch the fish after a long time.

629
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,160
He didn't send it well to me.

630
00:38:57,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Again.

631
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:00,160
Behind you.

632
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:03,160
Behind you.

633
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:10,160
If you have a half-baked fish,

634
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:17,160
it's hard to eat.

635
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,160
If you can't defeat the fish,

636
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,160
it's hard to eat.

637
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,160
I've lost everything.

638
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,160
Why are you still not happy?

639
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:45,160
What should I do?

640
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,160
You should wake up.

641
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:53,160
What should I do?

642
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
You should wake up and see me.

643
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
I know I'm crazy.

644
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
What should I do?

645
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:12,160
We promised to eat horse meat together.

646
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:15,160
We've filmed a movie.

647
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
You're my wife.

648
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,160
You should be with me.

649
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:39,160
Why did you become so cold?

650
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Why did you become so cold?

651
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:47,160
Why did you become so cold?

652
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,160
I thought

653
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
I wouldn't live anymore.

654
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:17,160
I want to live for you.

655
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:22,160
I want to see the blue sky.

656
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,160
But I know I can't die.

657
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,160
Because

658
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,160
I promised to protect the world

659
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,160
and save the world.

660
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:41,160
Let me bear it for the night.

661
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:49,160
I'm not the crown prince.

662
00:41:52,160 --> 00:41:54,160
I don't care about the world.

663
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,160
We should stay here.

664
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:03,160
Stay here quietly.

665
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Okay?

666
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,160
We should stay here quietly.

667
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:15,160
Okay.

668
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:46,160
I'm not the crown prince.

669
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:48,160
I'm not the crown prince.

670
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
I'm not the crown prince.

671
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,160
I'm not the crown prince.

672
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
I'm not the crown prince.

673
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
I'm not the crown prince.

674
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,160
I'm not the crown prince.

675
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,160
I'm not the crown prince.

676
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,160
I'm not the crown prince.

677
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,160
I'm not the crown prince.

678
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:06,160
I'm not the crown prince.

679
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:08,160
I'm not the crown prince.

680
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:10,160
I'm not the crown prince.

681
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:12,160
I'm not the crown prince.

682
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,160
I'm not the crown prince.

683
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I'm not the crown prince.

684
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:21,160
Sengr at the breakfastたとら

00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:29,160
parameters

686
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:35,000
When the past additive

687
00:43:35,160 --> 00:43:36,880
If

688
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,160
Waiting for memories

689
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:14,160
I don't know all the warmth I've had

690
00:44:14,160 --> 00:44:19,160
I want to stay for you

691
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:25,160
If we love each other, what will we do?

692
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I will live for you

693
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:32,160
if I love you

694
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,160
I will wait for my love

695
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:44,160
but my promise is true

696
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:51,160
If I love you, what I'm saying is true

697
00:44:51,160 --> 00:44:54,160
I will love you

698
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:58,160
if I love you

699
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:03,160
I will wait for your life

700
00:45:03,160 --> 00:45:08,160
I will wait for your life

701
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:15,160
If I love you, what I'm saying is true

702
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:18,160
I will love you

703
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:22,160
if I love you

704
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:26,160
I will wait for your life
