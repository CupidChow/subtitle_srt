1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,740
The singer, Ray面

2
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:17,940
standing the frost

3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,140
your glimmer

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:24,840
it came suddenly

5
00:00:25,120 --> 00:00:26,800
pursuing waves

6
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,800
My night has passed, the night has passed, the night has passed

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:42,800
I want to forget the mirror of the dark night, the long and long

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:52,800
When the encounter is parting, when the encounter is distant, I will never forget

9
00:00:53,800 --> 00:01:01,800
The light of the sky is shining, the sky is shining brightly, the wind is blowing

10
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:11,800
The wind is blowing, the wind is blowing, the sky is blowing, the wind is blowing

11
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:19,800
The wind is blowing, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

12
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:26,800
The light of the sky is blowing, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing, the wind is blowing

13
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:35,800
The sun is shining and the sky is shining, the sky is shining brightly, the wind is blowing

14
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:38,800
Episode 8

15
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:42,800
Episode 6

16
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,800
Young Master,

17
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,200
the guards have been settled.

18
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,200
No matter how the map is arranged,

19
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,800
the guards won't wake up.

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I wonder

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,800
if we can meet again.

22
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,200
How long have you been with the guards?

23
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
It's my blessing.

24
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:11,400
Don't be so silly.

25
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,400
If General really comes in,

26
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,400
tell him that

27
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,200
I forced you to do it.

28
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,800
You must keep your life.

29
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
After you're out of the body,

30
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
come to me.

31
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,200
Young Master,

32
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:23,200
I'm sorry.

33
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,200
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,200
What's that sound?

35
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:45,800
It's the air of the Cui's army.

36
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,000
What kind of air?

37
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,600
The whole country knows.

38
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:53,000
That's the enemy of the Cui's army.

39
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,000
There's nothing to block the air of the Cui's army.

40
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
No matter who it is,

41
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,400
no matter what the law is,

42
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,400
the air of the Cui's army

43
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,200
will be peaceful.

44
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,400
Let's go.

45
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:49,400
Go.

46
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
Go.

47
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,800
Aiyu.

48
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:20,800
Aiyu.

49
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,800
Go.

50
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,200
Go.

51
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,600
Go.

52
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:41,600
Go.

53
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Go.

54
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Go.

55
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Go.

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
The air of the Cui's army

57
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:49,400
will be peaceful.

58
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Aiyu.

59
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
Aiyu.

60
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:57,400
Aiyu.

61
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Aiyu.

62
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Aiyu.

63
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,400
You can't do this again.

64
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:19,000
If you do this,

65
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,800
my heart will be in pain.

66
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Aiyu.

67
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Hu Zai.

68
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Hu Zai.

69
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,400
Senior.

70
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,800
Is it really you?

71
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,200
It's me.

72
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Do you know that one day,

73
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I managed to escape

74
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,400
and saw you.

75
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
And I found out

76
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:58,400
that dream wasn't real.

77
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Now I'm real.

78
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
You can't do this.

79
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,400
Go.

80
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
Go.

81
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,400
We found the cow

82
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,400
in the garden.

83
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,400
We pulled it out.

84
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,400
On this cow's belly,

85
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,400
we tied it up.

86
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,400
You don't know that

87
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,400
when the cow was out,

88
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
it was shaking.

89
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
But your people

90
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,400
thought it was the Cui's army's

91
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,400
attack.

92
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,400
They were all shouting

93
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:48,400
that the Disheng army was coming.

94
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,400
That scene was spectacular.

95
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,400
Bye.

96
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:55,400
What's wrong with your injury?

97
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,400
Don't mention it.

98
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,400
When I was in the cow's belly,

99
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
the people in the street

100
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
were panicking for a while.

101
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,400
But look,

102
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,400
it wasn't an attack.

103
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
It was a calm.

104
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,400
I saw it.

105
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,400
I went after it.

106
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,400
But it was injured.

107
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
You're so stubborn.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
Did you get hurt?

109
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
I'm telling you,

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
it was a serious injury.

111
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:28,400
You've been here for a year and a half.

112
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,400
You can't fight with animals anymore.

113
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,400
Otherwise,

114
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
your injury will be damaged.

115
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
You can't save the God Sword

116
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,400
in the prison.

117
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
I'm not fighting.

118
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:35,400
It's not like

119
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I'm drinking more.

120
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,400
You can't drink wine.

121
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,400
You can only eat some peanuts.

122
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Yes, peanuts.

123
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:43,400
Eat peanuts.

124
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
I'm telling you,

125
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:46,400
hurry up and get Miss Taozi back.

126
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,400
Otherwise,

127
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,400
she'll be in charge of the west.

128
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,400
I can't take it.

129
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,400
That's right.

130
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:53,400
You're wrong.

131
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,400
How can Miss Taozi

132
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
marry the girl

133
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
and not be in charge of the west?

134
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
No, you're right.

135
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
You don't understand

136
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:00,400
what he means.

137
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,400
After Miss Taozi married the girl,

138
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,400
she's in charge of the ears.

139
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:04,400
She doesn't care about us.

140
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
That's right.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,400
Miss Taozi is a good girl.

142
00:09:06,400 --> 00:09:07,400
Even if she's married,

143
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,400
we'll be hurt.

144
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Can we not care about us?

145
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:10,400
No, no, no.

146
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:13,400
God's Spirit, I don't want to be hurt.

147
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,400
Miss Taozi,

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
I'll never be in charge of you.

149
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,400
We won't let Miss Taozi worry about us.

150
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,400
Miss Taozi should be worried about us.

151
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
We'll be in charge of the ears.

152
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
We'll be in charge of the ears.

153
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
Right?

154
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
Right?

155
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
Don't touch me.

156
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
Don't touch me.

157
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
Don't touch me.

158
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't touch me.

159
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,400
Don't touch me.

160
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Don't touch me.

161
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
Don't touch me.

162
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,400
We're talking nonsense.

163
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
Don't be angry.

164
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Chen Hanchang

165
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:39,400
greets Your Highness.

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,400
General Han, please.

167
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:45,400
I'm a person who's been practicing.

168
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:48,400
Don't mention the title ever again.

169
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
Yes.

170
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,400
Please sit down.

171
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
Your Highness,

172
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
please sit down.

173
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
I heard that I'm here to see you.

174
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
I'm very happy.

175
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,400
I just hope that one day,

176
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,400
I can come to see you in person.

177
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
He must have grown up a lot.

178
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
The situation in the capital is complicated.

179
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
Otherwise,

180
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,400
I'll bring him here to see you.

181
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,400
Prince Qin promised me

182
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
that he would help the Grand Sun

183
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,400
and inherit the capital.

184
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,400
Do you still think

185
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,400
Prince Qin is trustworthy?

186
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,400
I still think he's trustworthy.

187
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Prince Qin is trustworthy.

188
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:45,400
Prince Qin and Prince Qi are very ambitious.

189
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,400
Prince Qin is the chief.

190
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,400
Prince Qi is the first.

191
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,400
Prince Qin has a high reputation

192
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,400
and is very anxious.

193
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Prince Qin is a very suspicious person.

194
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:59,400
He's impulsive and angry.

195
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,400
He's very vicious.

196
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,400
But he's not very smart.

197
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:05,400
He can see through

198
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,400
the fact that he killed the father-in-law.

199
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
I just hope that

200
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,400
he'll be locked up forever.

201
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Yes.

202
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
I'll contact

203
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:17,400
the old minister of the Crown Prince.

204
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I won't let Prince Qin

205
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
let Prince Qin out easily.

206
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
As for Prince Qi,

207
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:24,400
he's very strict.

208
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,400
But he can see

209
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,400
that he's very suspicious

210
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:30,400
about the position of the Chu.

211
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
This person

212
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,400
is only a little smart.

213
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
He's not very smart.

214
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,400
He'll be out of the horse's corner soon.

215
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,400
Then we'll

216
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,400
take a shot at him.

217
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,400
Yes.

218
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,400
Here, Miss.

219
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:56,400
Miss.

220
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Let's try our new friend.

221
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Thank you.

222
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,400
Let me try.

223
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Eat.

224
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
It's so delicious.

225
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
You're eating?

226
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
Yes.

227
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,400
You're eating?

228
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Yes.

229
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:07,400
There's something

230
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
that we've been hiding from you.

231
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
What is it?

232
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Are you hiding it

233
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
from me again

234
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
to go to Fengying House to drink?

235
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,400
No.

236
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
No.

237
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
I asked you

238
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
to get some money.

239
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
You said that

240
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
you'd go to Fengying House to drink.

241
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
But it's not true.

242
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
We spent the money

243
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,400
in other places.

244
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,400
Brother Bao, don't say that.

245
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,400
You said that

246
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
we spent the money

247
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
in a place

248
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,400
that we can't see.

249
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Yes.

250
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
We spent the money

251
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
in a place

252
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
that we can't see.

253
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
What is it?

254
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Fengying House.

255
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
Taozi,

256
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
eat the lamb.

257
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
Yes.

258
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Yes.

259
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
Yes.

260
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
We

261
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:41,400
saved a person.

262
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Yes.

263
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Yes.

264
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
We saved a person.

265
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,400
We saved a person.

266
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
No.

267
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
We saved two people.

268
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,400
Yes.

269
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:49,400
Two people.

270
00:12:49,400 --> 00:12:50,400
We saved

271
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,400
the daughter of the Qin's wife

272
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Xiao Xi'er.

273
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,400
It's not good.

274
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
We've been fighting.

275
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,400
The Qin's wife

276
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:56,400
has entered the imperial palace.

277
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,400
She can't return the money.

278
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,400
She's been beaten to death.

279
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,400
Yes.

280
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:01,400
She's been sold for no money.

281
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:03,400
The leader forced her to make a crime scene.

282
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
And she sold her daughter, Xiao Xi'er.

283
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Xiao Xi'er is only four years old.

284
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
Can she admit it?

285
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,400
No.

286
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
We spent the money

287
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
to save the country

288
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,400
and save the body.

289
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,400
We saved the money

290
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
in the house of

291
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
my brother Zhao.

292
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,400
We even built a three-bedroom house.

293
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
In the imperial palace,

294
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
there's a village of Zhao's family

295
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
in the countryside.

296
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Zhao's family

297
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
is a good place.

298
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,400
There's a mountain and a river.

299
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
There are many ducks in the river.

300
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, there are ducks.

301
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
One...

302
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,800
He can only take a day off.

303
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,200
He's a little girl.

304
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,360
Shiqing,

305
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,800
let's go back to Lanlan Temple together.

306
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,240
Yes.

307
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,560
Let's go back to Lanlan Temple.

308
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:38,400
All three of us.

309
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,120
Shiqing,

310
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,520
we've discussed it.

311
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:41,480
We'll go back to Lanlan Temple

312
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,320
and take a day off.

313
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,040
We'll go back to Sanli Temple from Lanlan Temple.

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,120
If you're free,

315
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,240
come and visit us.

316
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,120
Come and visit us?

317
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:49,880
Shiqing,

318
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:50,600
you blow the bull,

319
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,440
we'll help you.

320
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,880
We'll make a good deal of it.

321
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,240
We'll buy the bull.

322
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,240
We'll help you.

323
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,440
We'll help you.

324
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:58,440
Since that's the case,

325
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,320
then...

326
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,640
OK.

327
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,480
Let's do it.

328
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,320
Let's do it.

329
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:05,600
Let's go.

330
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,000
Let's go.

331
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,800
The water is full.

332
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:13,000
The clouds are full.

333
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,480
The sun is shining.

334
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,040
The clouds are shining.

335
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:18,200
The sun is shining.

336
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:20,320
The clouds are shining.

337
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,440
The clouds are shining.

338
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
The sun is shining.

339
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,440
The sun is shining.

340
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:28,440
The clouds are shining.

341
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:30,440
The sun is shining.

342
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,440
The sun is shining.

343
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:34,440
The sun is shining.

344
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,440
The sun is shining.

345
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:38,440
The sun is shining.

346
00:14:38,440 --> 00:14:40,440
The sun is shining.

347
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,440
The sun is shining.

348
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:44,440
The sun is shining.

349
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,440
The sun is shining.

350
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,440
The sun is shining.

351
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,440
The sun is shining.

352
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
The sun is shining.

353
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,440
The sun is shining.

354
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,440
The sun is shining.

355
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
The sun is shining.

356
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
It's cold in Yingzhou.

357
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,440
The fireflies are not so well.

358
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:12,440
No one can avoid it when the autumn comes.

359
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:14,440
However,

360
00:15:14,440 --> 00:15:16,440
when I was in my youth,

361
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,440
the fireflies flew in from the window,

362
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,440
and stopped on my wall.

363
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,840
She was so silly and bright.

364
00:15:23,840 --> 00:15:26,840
So, my mother asked me to write this name for her.

365
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,040
She called me Ying.

366
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,240
So, your name came from this?

367
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,440
My name is...

368
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:38,240
from the four of the Central Government.

369
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,240
I'm a good person.

370
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,040
I hope I can be smart in the future.

371
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,440
So, I'm named Ni.

372
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
But I don't have a name either.

373
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,040
My mother called me Shi Qilong since I was a child.

374
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,440
So, I called her and she passed away.

375
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:01,040
Then, I'll only call you Shi Qilong in the future.

376
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:06,240
You called me Prince Qin in a hurry.

377
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,640
You don't know how angry I was.

378
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,440
When I was a child,

379
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:23,440
dad knew I liked fireflies.

380
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,040
He always told me,

381
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,440
Ying, I'll tell you a firefly.

382
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,640
Just promise me one thing, okay?

383
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:33,040
Either I'll be a book or a letter.

384
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,440
But I always tell him,

385
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
Dad,

386
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,440
I can't catch a firefly.

387
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:41,440
I'll promise you 100 times.

388
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,440
But dad is too busy.

389
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:46,440
He has no time.

390
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,440
He can't catch a firefly.

391
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,440
He really helps me catch it.

392
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,440
So, I've never seen

393
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,440
100 fireflies together.

394
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,240
But tonight,

395
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,040
there must be 100 fireflies here.

396
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,440
Shansong.

397
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,440
Shansong.

398
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Ying, I'll tell you 100 fireflies.

399
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,440
Can you promise me one thing?

400
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
I won't.

401
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,440
Even if you give me

402
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:55,440
10,000 fireflies,

403
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
I won't promise you.

404
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
It's so happy tonight.

405
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,440
Don't mention anything else, okay?

406
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:14,440
The water is so nice.

407
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,440
Tonight, it's a night-summer party.

408
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,440
A night-summer party.

409
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
The two of us.

410
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,440
The two of us.

411
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,440
The water is so nice.

412
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:32,440
This song is so nice.

413
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,440
Yes.

414
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Yes.

415
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
I hope this kind of time

416
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
can last longer.

417
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
And longer.

418
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
Ying.

419
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:12,440
Actually, I...

420
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:38,440
I...

421
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:09,440
The police is here.

422
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,440
The Jiesuo Palace is destroyed by the White Water Pass.

423
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Where is it?

424
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:15,440
Your Majesty.

425
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,440
The White Water Pass is the most important place in Lianzhou.

426
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:22,440
It's the most important gate in the north of the Chao Dynasty.

427
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,440
After the White Water Pass, it's Yanzhou.

428
00:20:24,440 --> 00:20:27,440
It's a safe place to stay.

429
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,440
It's only a place to fight against the enemy.

430
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:31,440
The Iron Qi of Jiesuo

431
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,440
can even be put into Shuozhou's territory.

432
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,440
Your Majesty.

433
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:40,440
How did the White Water Pass be destroyed?

434
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,440
It's an important gate to guard the Jiesuo Palace.

435
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
General Cui Yi of Pingliang

436
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:48,440
should have been there to guard the army.

437
00:20:48,440 --> 00:20:50,440
As the saying goes,

438
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,440
the White Water Pass's chief is the son of Cui Yi.

439
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,440
He's been promoted to the leader of the Jiesuo Palace.

440
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:58,440
The White Water Pass is a difficult city.

441
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,440
It's so crowded.

442
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:03,440
The Iron Qi of Jiesuo Palace is so crowded.

443
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,440
The military intelligence is more detailed.

444
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:07,440
It'll be passed in the court in a few days.

445
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:09,440
I heard that Cui Yi left Luoyang in person

446
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:12,440
a few days earlier.

447
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,440
He's been in the north all the way.

448
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
What's the point of Cui Yi's position?

449
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:18,440
Since the White Water Pass is his son,

450
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:21,440
Cui Yi has been colluding with the Jiesuo Palace.

451
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,440
I'm afraid that the mountain river is in danger now.

452
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
Where's the King of Qin?

453
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,440
When he couldn't find him,

454
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
he would fight in the battlefield.

455
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:35,440
Where is he now?

456
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,440
This bastard

457
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,440
just wants to piss me off.

458
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,440
Brother,

459
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
I still feel sorry for you.

460
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,440
But the whole court has come out again.

461
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:54,440
They said that they were going to punish you.

462
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,440
They just didn't have enough money

463
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:58,440
to make you suffer.

464
00:21:58,440 --> 00:22:00,440
I'm not happy to hear that.

465
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,440
But it's not good to go back to Brother.

466
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,440
Li Ni is in the village.

467
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,440
By the way,

468
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:10,440
Father really made up for Li Ni this time.

469
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,440
He even scolded me today.

470
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,440
He said that if Li Ni didn't go, he would just leave the capital.

471
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,440
On the way back to the capital,

472
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:18,440
he went to Brother's palace

473
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,440
to steal Brother's food and water.

474
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,440
He's too angry.

475
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,440
He's just doing something wrong with me.

476
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
He just wants to erase my face.

477
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,440
When he was being seduced by me,

478
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,440
he even dared to steal my clothes.

479
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:36,440
Father said that he was originally hoping that Li Ni would go to the capital.

480
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:38,440
But Cui Yi was still in the village.

481
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,440
He said that he was near Shuzhou.

482
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,440
Then Father said that he would let Cui Yi go to the capital.

483
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:44,440
He also said that when Prince Qi comes back,

484
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,440
he will let him go to the capital.

485
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
To be honest,

486
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,440
he is the chief of the Zhengxi army.

487
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,440
He can fight.

488
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,440
There's no way.

489
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:57,440
Who told the Zhengxi army to listen to Li Ni?

490
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,440
That's the Zhengxi army of our state.

491
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,440
It's not his Li Ni.

492
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:05,440
In the past, there was no one to take care of the war and crisis.

493
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
Now the world is too peaceful.

494
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Why did he guard the Zhengxi army?

495
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,440
He just did whatever he wanted to do.

496
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Yes, Brother.

497
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,440
There are many cases of illness in the court.

498
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Father has been worried about it several times.

499
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:22,440
But he can't get rid of his military power.

500
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Father.

501
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,440
Good.

502
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:32,440
It's good to be safe.

503
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,440
Let me see.

504
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
It's good.

505
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,440
He was just a little bit injured.

506
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:40,440
He didn't get hurt.

507
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
Father was injured, too.

508
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,440
He was also broken.

509
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
He must be the night army.

510
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
He was worried about me.

511
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,440
He received the letter from Tao Zifei.

512
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:51,440
He said that Prince Qi has saved you.

513
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:53,440
To be honest,

514
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:55,440
he was worried about me.

515
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,440
To be honest,

516
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:00,440
he closed his eyes and fell asleep.

517
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
On this road,

518
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,440
he was so worried.

519
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
He was worried about me.

520
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:20,440
Why didn't Prince Qin win?

521
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,440
He was afraid of the army of our Cui family.

522
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,440
Father.

523
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:26,440
Prince Qin sent his daughter here to meet you.

524
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,440
He will leave soon.

525
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
Look at him.

526
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,440
He is afraid that he won't even lose his hair.

527
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,440
He is afraid that he will lose his hair.

528
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:37,440
He is afraid that he will lose his hair.

529
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
Father.

530
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:40,440
He was worried about the army of our Cui family.

531
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:42,440
He was worried about the army of our Cui family.

532
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,440
He called him the stupid emperor.

533
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,440
He should have killed him.

534
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:48,440
Father.

535
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,440
Father.

536
00:25:14,440 --> 00:25:16,440
He really left like that?

537
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,440
He saved you.

538
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:22,440
You didn't even go to see him off?

539
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:23,440
You just said that

540
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
he should have killed his father.

541
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,440
That's a big deal.

542
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,440
He saved your life.

543
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,440
Why didn't you go to see him off?

544
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Forget it.

545
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,440
It's not a good idea.

546
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:37,440
I said it.

547
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
They are all stupid.

548
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
Father.

549
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,440
Who are you?

550
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
I can't help it.

551
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,440
Report.

552
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
General.

553
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,440
It's time to take care of the White Water Pavilion.

554
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Father.

555
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,440
You remember it.

556
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:07,440
Especially about the words about Cui Yi and White Water Pavilion.

557
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,440
You must be patient.

558
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,440
You must be patient.

559
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:11,440
You must be patient.

560
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:12,440
Don't worry.

561
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,440
I can remember

562
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,440
just a few words.

563
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,440
I'll take my leave.

564
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,440
Father.

565
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
Here is Your Highness.

566
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,440
Greetings, father.

567
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
You know you are back.

568
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:43,440
The game is against the rules.

569
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,440
It's far away.

570
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,440
You are playing against rules.

571
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,440
How could you make the game

572
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,440
against your brother?

573
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,000
and took away all the food

574
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,320
from your brother's cabinet?

575
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:56,920
I was just wondering, Father,

576
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,160
why did you come to the court

577
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,360
to remove the forbidden curse of the Prince of Xin?

578
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,080
This is why you don't have to

579
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:03,880
let it out for long.

580
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,560
You're so thoughtful.

581
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:07,240
How can you see it?

582
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,240
Stop talking nonsense.

583
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,440
You're not even a official.

584
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,440
You're so thoughtful.

585
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,840
Am I the emperor or are you the emperor?

586
00:27:17,400 --> 00:27:18,720
Father, you shouldn't say that.

587
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,960
Stop teaching me.

588
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:22,600
I dare not.

589
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,000
You dare not?

590
00:27:25,280 --> 00:27:27,160
You dare to do so many things.

591
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:33,280
So,

592
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,560
Dai Bing left the capital.

593
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,520
I heard that his daughter

594
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,160
just returned to Luoyang.

595
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
She's been keeping her hand

596
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,880
for a long time.

597
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,040
Since you're back,

598
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,280
you should lead the Khexi Army

599
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:48,760
to take over Luoyang.

600
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,520
Father,

601
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:54,600
There were a lot of troops

602
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,520
seventeenth comrades there.

603
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
I made sure that Luoyang wasn't released.

604
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,160
Are you not afraid

605
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:00,840
that coldyas would cause

606
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,760
them any trouble?

607
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:07,320
Luoyang is a board leader of men's power.

608
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:08,800
She has been acting as

609
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,040
nobody in the kins.

610
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:11,680
She shouldn't be

611
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,080
satisfied and

612
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:14,040
afraid to slack off?

613
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,880
How did you think about this?

614
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:18,360
You've been fighting all day.

615
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,640
Now you're fighting

616
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:20,840
but you have a counter-attack.

617
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:22,800
Father,

618
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,120
Cui Yi is fighting in the front line.

619
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,880
We can't mess with his back.

620
00:28:30,520 --> 00:28:32,680
How did the White Water Passer-by lose?

621
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:35,160
The military report said it was clear.

622
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:36,680
Cui Yi's son

623
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,880
is good at persuading.

624
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,800
He's known as a general and is fond of saving people.

625
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,320
He can't kill him.

626
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,240
He's good.

627
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,840
He's in the dead of the war.

628
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,720
He killed the general.

629
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:50,920
Cui Yi raised such a son

630
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,840
to be the best selling country.

631
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:54,960
The officials in the court

632
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,160
said they'd punish him.

633
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,480
But Prime Minister Gu told me

634
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:02,880
to let Cui Yi take the credit.

635
00:29:03,240 --> 00:29:03,840
Father,

636
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,080
Cui Yi and his wife Liu Cheng Feng

637
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,440
have been together for a long time.

638
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,640
Because Liu Cheng Feng colluded with the enemy,

639
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,120
Cui Jia and the enemy

640
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,440
have been fighting all day.

641
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:14,320
Even if father suspects anyone,

642
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:15,600
he shouldn't suspect Cui.

643
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,880
Prince Qin,

644
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:24,560
you really disappointed me.

645
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,440
Now, I ask you

646
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,640
to let me take the capital.

647
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,480
Do you obey or not?

648
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:36,800
I don't.

649
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:42,200
I'll leave the letter to the official.

650
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,720
Zheng Xixun.

651
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:51,520
Minister Couple has been subject to office work.

652
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,320
You should return now.

653
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,640
Just close our door and leave.

654
00:29:56,160 --> 00:29:57,240
Yes, father.

655
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:08,800
Let's go.

656
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:17,560
Yes.

657
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,400
17th Prince.

658
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:25,800
Why are you here?

659
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,480
Stop talking.

660
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:28,960
Today, in the court,

661
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,640
His Majesty entrusted the army of Zhenxi to Prince Qi.

662
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:34,280
Prince Qi ordered me and my father to leave the capital immediately.

663
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,760
My father took me to Lingzhou.

664
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,040
I took my father to Bizhou.

665
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,560
Prince Qi has been a devout man for a long time.

666
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:44,040
That day, my father wanted me to take over Dongdu.

667
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:45,760
He was very strict.

668
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,680
If my father couldn't say that,

669
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:52,000
Prince Qi would have told him so.

670
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,640
He wanted to teach you a lesson

671
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,880
and then deviate you from the army.

672
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:02,920
I'm very strict in the capital.

673
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:06,240
Since I was a teenager,

674
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
we were together.

675
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:09,360
You understand me, too.

676
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:13,280
But I don't mean anything in the capital.

677
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,720
And the imperial palace is meaningless.

678
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:19,120
And Leshi was very strict.

679
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,040
But in fact,

680
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:25,120
we wouldn't be able to return to the prison.

681
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,360
Yずi has made me understand

682
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:38,840
that Prince Qi and Prince Qi can't be trusted.

683
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:42,680
But the world shouldn't have a princess like her.

684
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:43,840
I have to help her.

685
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,640
She wants me to be the crown prince.

686
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:49,520
But I promised Consort Xiao

687
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,720
to help her.

688
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:54,680
A'Ying and I

689
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:56,760
were in love.

690
00:31:58,680 --> 00:31:59,680
Because of this,

691
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:01,680
we almost got separated.

692
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,080
I know what she said.

693
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,120
But I have something to say

694
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,080
to her.

695
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:13,960
Furthermore,

696
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,720
you didn't lose to the crown prince.

697
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:18,400
But I am your lover.

698
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:20,800
aria

699
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,520
From now,

700
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,400
you are just a newlywed man.

701
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,440
This Gangjie

702
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:36,760
is your chance Bo elas.

703
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,600
It's been full-time.

704
00:32:40,560 --> 00:32:41,320
What does it mean?

705
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:44,560
If I become the crown prince,

706
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:48,280
will the court allow the crown prince to be the chief of the Cui family?

707
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:52,080
If I become the crown prince,

708
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,280
Cui Yi won't give me the Cui family army.

709
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,080
That day,

710
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,480
my father ordered me to take the poison and was rejected by me.

711
00:33:05,680 --> 00:33:07,080
He gave me the Western Xun to the King of Qi

712
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,880
under his rule.

713
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:10,680
I didn't want to see Ying Bilong

714
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:14,080
because I didn't want to be the crown prince.

715
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,480
But once I become the crown prince,

716
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:22,080
I have to go to the Cui family army myself.

717
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:39,680
Six hundred.

718
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,080
Six hundred.

719
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:48,480
Where is he?

720
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,080
Tao Zi.

721
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:53,480
You scared me.

722
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:55,680
Here you are.

723
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:57,080
What?

724
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:02,880
So much money?

725
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:05,080
I used to collect it.

726
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,480
I forgot to give it to you

727
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,280
when I was busy last time.

728
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,080
Give me so much money.

729
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,280
Take it for me first.

730
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,080
Wait for the future.

731
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,480
The future.

732
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:20,080
Why do you want me to take it for you?

733
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,480
The future?

734
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:22,880
What future?

735
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,280
I don't understand.

736
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:27,480
Tao Zi.

737
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,880
Didn't you promise me last time?

738
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:30,680
This...

739
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:31,880
You fool.

740
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,280
I understand you.

741
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:34,880
I will be less than you.

742
00:34:36,680 --> 00:34:37,680
You are blind.

743
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,080
Okay.

744
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,680
I will keep these money for you.

745
00:34:42,280 --> 00:34:44,880
I will put my money with him in the future.

746
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,880
Maybe we can buy a chicken and a sweet.

747
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,480
Or a shop.

748
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:50,080
Okay.

749
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:51,680
Whatever you say, whatever it is.

750
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,680
You have to be careful in the future.

751
00:34:54,080 --> 00:34:55,680
You can't be fooled easily.

752
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,480
Okay.

753
00:34:56,880 --> 00:34:57,680
Let's go.

754
00:34:57,880 --> 00:34:58,880
I will take you to the Western Xun.

755
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,080
Let's go.

756
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:01,680
Tao Zi.

757
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,480
This way. This way.

758
00:35:05,480 --> 00:35:07,080
Mr. Shi. Mr. Shi.

759
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Get up. Get up.

760
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:09,880
Get up.

761
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:11,480
Wake up. Wake up.

762
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,280
Mr. Shi.

763
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,080
What's wrong?

764
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,080
I have good news.

765
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:17,880
Miss Cui is here.

766
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:19,080
What?

767
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,280
Miss Cui is here in the Western Xun.

768
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,280
Tao Zi is here too.

769
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,080
She is going to see Tao Zi now.

770
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,280
I heard that Miss Cui is here

771
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:28,480
to see His Majesty.

772
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
To see His Majesty?

773
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:31,280
Yes.

774
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:32,280
Miss Tao Zi said that

775
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:33,480
she said that

776
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,480
Miss Cui is here

777
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,480
to see His Majesty with General Cui.

778
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:38,480
So she said

779
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,480
she hopes to see His Majesty

780
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,280
in the Great Court.

781
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:44,480
She is so angry.

782
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:46,680
Mr. Shi.

783
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,080
You are wrong.

784
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:49,880
Although she is seeing His Majesty,

785
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,480
she still wants to see him.

786
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:53,680
You said that

787
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:55,480
it's hurtful.

788
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,480
You don't understand.

789
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,480
I don't understand.

790
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:00,480
Then teach me.

791
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,480
Tell me.

792
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:08,680
The imperial family of the imperial family

793
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:09,880
is full of people.

794
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,080
It's like the oil pot of the master.

795
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,080
The water is so deep.

796
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,680
He is still here to teach me.

797
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:20,880
Besides,

798
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,080
he said that he wants to see His Majesty

799
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,280
with General Cui.

800
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:26,880
He is so selfish.

801
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:28,480
He can't be a good son

802
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
without General Cui.

803
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:31,880
Besides, he is General Cui's daughter.

804
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,880
How can he go to the court?

805
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,280
Those officials in the court

806
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,280
can't even punish him.

807
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,480
I don't understand.

808
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,280
How can you hear this?

809
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:45,880
You are worried about Miss Cui.

810
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:53,680
He is so big.

811
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:55,480
Why should I worry about him?

812
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,480
He is here.

813
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Shall we go to see him?

814
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,280
No.

815
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:10,480
Really?

816
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,280
No.

817
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:12,080
No.

818
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:12,680
No.

819
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,680
Really?

820
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,480
This cloth

821
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,480
is so fresh.

822
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:31,480
It's not cooked.

823
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:32,880
I don't know when

824
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:34,480
you can go to see His Majesty.

825
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,080
Miss,

826
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
do you want to go to see His Majesty?

827
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:51,480
This is true.

828
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
You have been here for days.

829
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,680
He didn't even come to see you.

830
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:57,080
Last time,

831
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,280
he went to save you.

832
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:00,280
Later,

833
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,280
he sent you back to General Cui.

834
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,680
I thought that

835
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,680
this person is really good to our Miss.

836
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,280
It's only for a few days.

837
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,680
Why do you suddenly

838
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,280
look like a stranger?

839
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,680
Have you seen Qi Chang'er?

840
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:18,880
Of course.

841
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,280
Then what did he tell you?

842
00:38:21,280 --> 00:38:23,280
He didn't tell me anything.

843
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,680
He didn't tell you anything.

844
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:27,880
He didn't say anything important.

845
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,280
Then I guess

846
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,280
he didn't say anything important to me.

847
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,280
So he didn't see me.

848
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:35,680
That's not it.

849
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,880
Although he didn't say anything important,

850
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,280
but you see,

851
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:40,880
Erdu and I

852
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:42,480
went to see the war.

853
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:43,880
We went to the shop

854
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,680
and bought a lot of things.

855
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,880
Even if there is nothing important,

856
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:50,880
as long as we two are walking on the street,

857
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,880
we are happy.

858
00:38:53,480 --> 00:38:54,880
Prince Qin didn't come to see me?

859
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:56,880
Why are you so anxious?

860
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,280
I'm not anxious.

861
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:00,880
I'm worried about you.

862
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:02,480
I'm worried about you.

863
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm thinking

864
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,280
if you want to see Prince Qin.

865
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,080
Will you?

866
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,880
Or who do you want to see?

867
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:11,480
I don't want to.

868
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,680
This poor girl.

869
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,280
This poor girl.

870
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:24,880
Taozi.

871
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,480
You came so late.

872
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:27,480
You are late.

873
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:29,280
Today, the 17th Wolf is at the seal building.

874
00:39:29,480 --> 00:39:30,280
He asked to drink with us.

875
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,680
I came here as soon as I heard the whistle.

876
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:32,880
But it's too far away.

877
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:33,880
So I came here.

878
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,080
You said

879
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,480
Prince Qin asked you to drink at the seal building?

880
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:38,480
Yes.

881
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:40,880
Did he say

882
00:39:41,080 --> 00:39:42,480
he wants to see our lady?

883
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:44,880
No.

884
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:47,680
What's going on with him?

885
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,480
He asked you to drink with us.

886
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:50,680
Does he mean he's not busy?

887
00:39:51,080 --> 00:39:52,680
Why didn't he come to see our lady?

888
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,680
This old man asked him.

889
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,080
But the 17th Wolf didn't hear anything.

890
00:39:59,880 --> 00:40:01,280
These two are so mean.

891
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:03,080
Why did they make a scene again?

892
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,080
Yes.

893
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,280
After saving Miss Cui last time,

894
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:08,280
they came back on the way.

895
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:09,480
It feels good.

896
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,480
There was no quarrel on the way.

897
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,480
There was no fight.

898
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,680
It feels so strange.

899
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:16,080
What do you know?

900
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,480
There was no quarrel on the way.

901
00:40:18,680 --> 00:40:19,880
That's why it's so hard.

902
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:22,280
No.

903
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:24,280
We have to think of a way.

904
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,480
What way?

905
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,280
Since

906
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:30,280
he doesn't want to see her,

907
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,280
he doesn't want to see her either.

908
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,880
Among these two,

909
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:37,080
we must have someone

910
00:40:37,280 --> 00:40:38,480
to sell the first one.

911
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:39,880
What?

912
00:40:40,080 --> 00:40:41,080
What do you mean?

913
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:42,480
I'm confused.

914
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:43,680
There is.

915
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
Let's go buy dried dog.

916
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,680
What?

917
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,080
Let's go buy dried dog.

918
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,680
Let's go.

919
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:51,480
Hurry up.

920
00:40:56,480 --> 00:40:58,680
I heard that Feng Yingluo is the best restaurant in the capital.

921
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,080
It's so good.

922
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:01,680
It's so delicious.

923
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,680
It's good.

924
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,680
It's good to have wine.

925
00:41:05,080 --> 00:41:06,880
But we can't drink wine now.

926
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,080
Where is Brother Bao?

927
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
He just said he's on the way.

928
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,080
Did he fall into a trap?

929
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,880
He said he's on the way.

930
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,280
Why do you call him that?

931
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,480
It's convenient.

932
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:17,280
He's not on the way.

933
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,280
Can he go to the villa?

934
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:19,280
Of course.

935
00:41:19,480 --> 00:41:20,080
How about this?

936
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,080
Let's bet.

937
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:22,280
Who wins the bet

938
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,080
and drinks the wine.

939
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:25,480
If you lose, go to find Bao.

940
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,680
Let's see if he really falls.

941
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:27,480
Come on.

942
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,280
Let's have fun.

943
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:28,880
Let's have fun.

944
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:29,480
Come on.

945
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:32,280
Hello, brothers.

946
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,480
Three stars.

947
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:34,880
Five times the loss.

948
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,080
Six times the loss.

949
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:37,280
Five times the loss.

950
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,480
Seven times the loss.

951
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,880
Seven times the loss.

952
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:41,280
Hello, brothers.

953
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,480
Six times the loss.

954
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:43,680
Five times the loss.

955
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,080
Eight times the loss.

956
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:46,480
I won.

957
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:47,280
Shen Xilong.

958
00:41:47,480 --> 00:41:48,680
Guess who's next to you.

959
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,080
I'll do it.

960
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:50,680
Let's go.

961
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,680
Hello, brothers.

962
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,880
Seven times the loss.

963
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,480
Don't you want to know?

964
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Three times the loss.

965
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:57,680
Brother lost.

966
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:58,880
Shen Xilong.

967
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,280
Don't you want to go and see?

968
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:02,680
Fine.

969
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:03,880
Anyway, I told you.

970
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:04,880
You don't need to do it.

971
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:06,280
Come on.

972
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,080
Come on.

973
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,480
Come on.

974
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:08,480
I'll go.

975
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,680
Brothers.

976
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:10,280
Brother.

977
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,480
Three stars.

978
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,880
Five times the loss.

979
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:14,080
Brothers.

980
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:14,880
Taozi.

981
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,480
Why did you buy so many nuts?

982
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:17,480
What do you want to do?

983
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:19,880
The lady likes this.

984
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,480
I'm going to use this nut.

985
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:23,680
I'll drive her crazy.

986
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:24,680
Honey.

987
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
Taozi is a thousand-year-old man.

988
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:28,080
We can't drink wine this year.

989
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:28,680
Let go.

990
00:42:29,480 --> 00:42:30,880
If you don't drink, you don't drink.

991
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:33,080
Brother Bao, here's some peanuts.

992
00:42:33,280 --> 00:42:33,880
There are.

993
00:42:34,080 --> 00:42:34,680
Yes, Brother Bao.

994
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,880
There are peanuts.

995
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:36,880
Isn't that...

996
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,480
Give it to me.

997
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:38,080
Give it to me.

998
00:42:38,480 --> 00:42:38,680
Here.

999
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:39,480
Give it to me.

1000
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,480
What's this?

1001
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:43,080
You two are the same age.

1002
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:44,280
This old man is too...

1003
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:45,280
You're too late.

1004
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,480
It's not you.

1005
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:48,680
There are some heads in the wine.

1006
00:42:49,080 --> 00:42:50,080
I'll go out and have a look.

1007
00:42:51,880 --> 00:42:52,680
Brother Sui, be careful.

1008
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:53,480
Let's go.

1009
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:53,880
Let's go.

1010
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:54,680
Go on.

1011
00:42:55,880 --> 00:42:56,880
Six, six.

1012
00:42:57,080 --> 00:42:57,480
Brothers.

1013
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:58,480
Brothers.

1014
00:42:58,680 --> 00:42:59,280
Six, six.

1015
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,080
Come here.

1016
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:01,480
Come here.

1017
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,080
Buy a shopkeeper.

1018
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,280
Let's read.

1019
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:07,680
The 17th Lang.

1020
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,080
Go or not?

1021
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:10,480
You want to live?

1022
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:12,280
I think he will definitely go.

1023
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:12,880
Okay.

1024
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:13,680
The Yashun.

1025
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:14,480
Go.

1026
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,080
The Yashun.

1027
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:15,880
Who else?

1028
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,480
I'm telling you, he won't go.

1029
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:18,880
He must go.

1030
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:19,480
Okay.

1031
00:43:20,480 --> 00:43:21,480
The Yashun.

1032
00:43:22,680 --> 00:43:23,280
The Yashun.

1033
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:23,880
Not going.

1034
00:43:24,080 --> 00:43:24,280
Okay.

1035
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:24,680
Not going.

1036
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:25,480
I'll make a decision.

1037
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:26,480
I'll bet on the book.

1038
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:27,280
I'll bet on the book.

1039
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:27,680
Okay.

1040
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:37,680
The Yashun.

1041
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:05,080
What?

1042
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:06,080
I can't hear it.

1043
00:44:06,280 --> 00:44:07,680
I'll just have to listen to it.

1044
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,480
Miss.

1045
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:35,880
Miss.

1046
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:36,480
Miss.

1047
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:39,680
Prince Qin bought the dried fruit you like.

1048
00:44:39,880 --> 00:44:40,680
He asked me to bring it here.

1049
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:41,680
Really?

1050
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:43,480
Yes.

1051
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:44,480
Miss.

1052
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:45,680
You don't know that

1053
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,080
this dried fruit

1054
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:49,080
will take a long time to buy.

1055
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,080
Give me a try.

1056
00:44:53,080 --> 00:44:53,680
He's back.

1057
00:44:54,080 --> 00:44:54,680
He's back.

1058
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:55,680
The 17th Lang.

1059
00:44:56,480 --> 00:44:57,480
You're not even close to him.

1060
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:58,080
Did he come in?

1061
00:44:58,280 --> 00:44:58,480
Didn't he come in?

1062
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,480
How come he's still here?

1063
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,480
Didn't come in.

1064
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:04,280
The Yashun.

1065
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:05,280
The Yashun.

1066
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:05,880
The Yashun.

1067
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:06,480
Hold on.

1068
00:45:06,880 --> 00:45:07,480
The Yashun.

1069
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:08,480
This...

1070
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,280
Prince Qin.

1071
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,280
Why didn't you go in?

1072
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,880
You said a lot about it.

1073
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:13,880
You don't know that, do you?

1074
00:45:14,880 --> 00:45:17,080
The 17th Lang is the best heir to the army.

1075
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:18,680
He must have found out

1076
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:20,480
that there are two big holes next to him.

1077
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:21,880
He found out that it's not Miss Sui.

1078
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:23,480
So he didn't go in.

1079
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:24,080
Yes.

1080
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:24,880
It's three.

1081
00:45:25,680 --> 00:45:26,280
Three?

1082
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,480
How can I see two?

1083
00:45:29,080 --> 00:45:30,880
They ordered a long meal.

1084
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,680
Even the chopsticks

1085
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:33,280
are made by the chef.

1086
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:34,080
You...

1087
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:36,680
How did you find out there are three?

1088
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,080
There's another one downstairs.

1089
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,080
He just came in.

1090
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:41,280
They're all businessmen who work for the maids.

1091
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:42,680
They just came from Xingzhou.

1092
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:44,680
There are a lot of money on them.

1093
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,080
They're going to exchange the money for the money.

1094
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:48,680
They didn't want to come to Fengying Restaurant for dinner.

1095
00:45:48,880 --> 00:45:49,880
They thought about it later.

1096
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,280
So there are many Li Fu Wan Kuan in the tea house.

1097
00:45:52,880 --> 00:45:55,080
The 17th Lang is still amazing.

1098
00:45:55,880 --> 00:45:56,280
I'm impressed.

1099
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:57,080
I'm impressed.

1100
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,280
I told you.

1101
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,280
Although the 17th Lang didn't go in,

1102
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:01,880
he must have found out

1103
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:02,480
who the next door is.

1104
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,080
You're not convinced.

1105
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:07,280
You're going to hide from me.

1106
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:08,280
You lose.

1107
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:08,880
Give me the money.

1108
00:46:09,080 --> 00:46:10,080
Give me the money.

1109
00:46:11,280 --> 00:46:12,080
It's mine.

1110
00:46:12,280 --> 00:46:12,880
I lost again, Shi Wen.

1111
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,280
Prince Qin bought you a dry fruit.

1112
00:46:15,680 --> 00:46:16,880
Shouldn't we

1113
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,280
give him something?

1114
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:19,680
To express our gratitude.

1115
00:46:22,680 --> 00:46:23,680
It's really delicious.

1116
00:46:24,080 --> 00:46:25,480
You've been on the line for so long.

1117
00:46:29,080 --> 00:46:29,880
How do you know

1118
00:46:30,080 --> 00:46:31,680
that this is not bought by Prince Qin?

1119
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:35,080
You've lost your sight.

1120
00:46:35,880 --> 00:46:37,880
He can't lie to Cheng Yu.

1121
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,680
What did he lie to him?

1122
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,480
He said that this dry fruit

1123
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:44,280
was brought back by a long-haired man.

1124
00:46:44,480 --> 00:46:46,080
We had a deal.

1125
00:46:46,280 --> 00:46:48,080
You bought this dry fruit for him.

1126
00:46:48,480 --> 00:46:49,680
It's good now.

1127
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:51,880
He can't lie to Cheng Yu.

1128
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:53,880
Here.

1129
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:56,680
Who bought it? Who ate it?

1130
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,080
Who bought it? Who ate it?

1131
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,880
You're right.

1132
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,080
It's delicious.

1133
00:47:05,480 --> 00:47:06,480
Thank you.

1134
00:47:07,480 --> 00:47:08,480
You're welcome.

1135
00:47:12,080 --> 00:47:12,880
I respect you.

1136
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:15,880
Brother,

1137
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:17,880
you don't know

1138
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:21,280
that although my father asked me to take care of Zheng Xi Jun,

1139
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,280
he refused to listen to me.

1140
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:27,680
I'm just a useless man.

1141
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:30,880
I'm here to take care of him.

1142
00:47:31,480 --> 00:47:32,880
You should take care of him.

1143
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,880
Why do you have to be so angry?

1144
00:47:35,080 --> 00:47:36,680
There's a chance

1145
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:38,280
to ask for his father's help.

1146
00:47:40,680 --> 00:47:41,480
What chance?

1147
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:42,680
What chance?

1148
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:45,080
The heir of the mother is coming.

1149
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,280
I'm sure

1150
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:48,880
he'll be happy to see the heir of the mother.

1151
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,280
Yes.

1152
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,280
The heir of the mother is coming.

1153
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:56,480
I'll tell him about this.

1154
00:47:56,680 --> 00:47:59,680
Maybe he'll let the heir of the mother go.

1155
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:00,880
Don't worry, brother.

1156
00:48:01,280 --> 00:48:04,480
I'll do my best to beg for his help.

1157
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:59,280
I miss the moment when I taste the most.

1158
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,280
The warmth of the bitter and bitter fruit.

1159
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:09,280
I want to stay for you.

1160
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:15,280
If love is a dream, we can always be strangers.

1161
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,280
I want to live for you

1162
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:22,280
since I was born.

1163
00:49:22,680 --> 00:49:26,680
The warmth of the bitter and bitter fruit.

1164
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:34,280
I want to stay for you.

1165
00:49:36,280 --> 00:49:42,280
If love is a dream, we can always be strangers.

1166
00:49:42,680 --> 00:49:49,280
I'll love you for the rest of my life.

1167
00:49:50,280 --> 00:49:59,280
I'll wait for you for the rest of my life.

1168
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:05,280
If love is a dream, we can always be strangers.

1169
00:50:06,280 --> 00:50:12,280
I'll love you for the rest of my life.

1170
00:50:12,280 --> 00:50:24,280
I'll wait for you for the rest of my life.
