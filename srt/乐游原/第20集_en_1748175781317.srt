1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,240
Which episode...

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:39,000
The King of Qin

3
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Episode 1

4
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Do you think this can really make the King of Qin feel better?

5
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:51,000
The King of Qin is a person with a high level of inner strength.

6
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,000
He fights with his sides and fights with his enemies.

7
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:59,000
In fact, his inner strength is soft and he can't overdo it.

8
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,000
As long as the words are correct, you can definitely understand him.

9
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
His Majesty ordered the King of Qin to close the door and think.

10
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Didn't Prime Minister say that many people have read the memorials and said that the King of Qin is bad?

11
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,000
The wood-burning rain forest is closed and the wind is blowing.

12
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's because the King of Qin has worked hard this time, so he was replaced by others.

13
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
His Majesty is now at the top of his head.

14
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
If the King of Qin doesn't want to admit his mistakes,

15
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,000
I'm afraid that the father and son will be in danger.

16
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,000
It's a big sign that the King of Qin loves him.

17
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Greetings, Your Highness.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Miss Gu, I'm going to visit Prime Minister of the Manor.

19
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
But I'm not going out now.

20
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Please help me transfer the imperial edict after you return to the Manor.

21
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
You're welcome.

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Actually, I didn't come today to ask for your permission.

23
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm just doing my own business.

24
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I have something to send to Your Highness.

25
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're welcome.

26
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
There's no need to be so courteous in the Manor.

27
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
You shouldn't have said that.

28
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
This is what I embroidered myself.

29
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm a traditional Chinese.

30
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,000
I've seen many people who have seen the birth of the King of Qin.

31
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'll follow the image of Lady Liu's portrait

32
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
and show it to them.

33
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
After I finished the portrait,

34
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I showed it to the people who know Lady Liu.

35
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
They all said that it looked like her.

36
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness, our lady has been looking for a long time.

37
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
It's easy to find a few people who have seen Lady Liu.

38
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
She asked them for a long time and asked them very carefully.

39
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
She also embroidered the white, dark and white hair and embroidered the white hair.

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Her eyes are red.

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
She finally got this portrait out.

42
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Your Highness,

43
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,000
as a child, you can't have a mother like me.

44
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
Of course, you'll feel sad.

45
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,000
But Lady Liu is very spiritual in heaven.

46
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
She knows that you're a good person now.

47
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
You must be very happy.

48
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Thank you, Miss Gu.

49
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:15,000
I'll take this portrait.

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Your Highness, you're a good person.

51
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:23,000
You're a smart person.

52
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Of course, you know that Lady Liu

53
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
won't be willing to give birth to you

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
for her sake.

55
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
Your Highness, look.

56
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
I used the gold and silver for this portrait.

57
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I thought that if you put Lady Liu's portrait on the mark,

58
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
it wouldn't be too bright and red.

59
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Miss Gu, you're too thoughtful.

60
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I'm grateful to you.

61
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You're welcome.

62
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I know that you're not a good person.

63
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I'll take my leave.

64
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Miss, didn't you say that you'd persuade Prince Qin

65
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
to admit his mistake?

66
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Why didn't you say it afterwards?

67
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
You're leaving so soon?

68
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I thought I was wrong.

69
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Prince Qin has been watching the birth mother closely.

70
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
I was watching Prince Qin's figure.

71
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
If I continue to persuade him,

72
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
he'll be unhappy.

73
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Besides,

74
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
he took the portrait of Lady Liu.

75
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Every time I see the portrait,

76
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
he'll feel something for me.

77
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Since that's the case,

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'd better say goodbye.

79
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Prince Qin really doesn't want to be Prince Qin anymore.

80
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Then will His Majesty still punish him?

81
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
The Dragon Phoenix in the world

82
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
won't be as important as you.

83
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
A person like Prince Qin

84
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,000
can only disturb him for a lifetime.

85
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's impossible for him to disturb him for a lifetime.

86
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Let's go.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
We're back.

88
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You're back.

89
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Stop looking at it.

90
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You didn't reply.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
You didn't even reply to me.

92
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I wasn't waiting for your reply.

93
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
But there's one thing I have to say.

94
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Something is true about that Miss Cui.

95
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,000
He said

96
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,840
that this situation

97
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:51,640
should be like

98
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:52,540
First Surface of the wegen bandit's army as Head texture

99
00:06:52,660 --> 00:06:54,200
should always be like,

100
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,240
well indeed

101
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,680
you probably can hold it out here.

102
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,500
But you never really have a hand in it.

103
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,760
What is this?

104
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,440
My mother 1965

105
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:13,380
said that

106
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,880
to the very first generation of those 502 soldiers

107
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,020
I never saw them.

108
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:22,000
That's a good embroidery.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
It's just a good embroidery.

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
Yes.

111
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
Miss Gu sent it.

112
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
She said she embroidered it for a long time.

113
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
Miss Gu sent it?

114
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
It seems that Miss Gu is very interested in you.

115
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
It's true.

116
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
Does she have feelings for you?

117
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm not the same type of person as her.

118
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm more into my own eyes.

119
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I like Miss Cui.

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Miss Cui?

121
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Miss Cui doesn't even look at me.

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is there any miracle in the poison?

123
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,000
The doctor has been trying to cure the poison for a long time.

124
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
The poison has been removed.

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,000
The poison is very dangerous.

126
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
Dadao.

127
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Dadao.

128
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Dadao.

129
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I promised Prince Qin

130
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:42,000
that if he promises to protect the grandchild and protect the grandchild and the throne,

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,000
I will kill Sun Jing by myself.

132
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,000
I will sacrifice myself to save him.

133
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
But I didn't expect that I didn't kill him.

134
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
Anyway, I lost my faith

135
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
after he left the palace.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Your Highness, you've tried your best.

137
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
It's not a bad fate.

138
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Prince Qin came to see you yesterday.

139
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
He said that Sun Jing is kind,

140
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
but he is still in danger.

141
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,000
He is still very cautious.

142
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
Write a letter to General Han

143
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,000
and tell him to not expose Sun Jing.

144
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Yes.

145
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Your Highness.

146
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Consort Xiao is here.

147
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
How is mother?

148
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Prince Qin told me that

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,000
there is no news from mother,

150
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
but she has been missing.

151
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
I'm worried that

152
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,000
something bad has happened to her.

153
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Don't worry, Your Highness.

154
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Consort Xiao is fine.

155
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
She is in Qingyun Temple outside the capital.

156
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
She is safe now.

157
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
Now that the capital is full,

158
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
can we go back to the capital?

159
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Your Highness.

160
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Consort Xiao is here.

161
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
She is calling us to show her mercy.

162
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Sun Jing is still in the capital.

163
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Prince Qin is a kind person.

164
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Prince Qin, Prince Qi,

165
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,000
and Prince Qin are also kind.

166
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Your Highness,

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
let's keep it a secret.

168
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I'm afraid that

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
you will be displeased

170
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
by all the other forces.

171
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
I know.

172
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Prince Xin wants to lead the army to Changzhou?

173
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Yes.

174
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
Father just told me to lead the army to Changzhou

175
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
in the court today.

176
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,000
He has been against Sun Jing for hundreds of days.

177
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Prince Xin has already seen the army.

178
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And several ministers of the imperial family

179
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
are telling us that

180
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:01,000
since I have seen the army,

181
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,000
I have been in charge of the general affairs of Prince Qin.

182
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
Now,

183
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Prince Xin has been in charge of the army.

184
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Isn't that nonsense?

185
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
How did he lose Luoyang?

186
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,000
He is the one who has been in charge of the army.

187
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Isn't that why I have been in charge of the army?

188
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,000
Just withdraw.

189
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
And I am still with Prince Qi.

190
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,000
Prince Qi is brave and can help me.

191
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,000
In the end,

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
even His Majesty is going to be touched.

193
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,000
His Majesty has ordered?

194
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
He hasn't officially ordered yet.

195
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
But His Majesty is very clear about it now.

196
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Prince Xin is the general of the army.

197
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Prince Qi is the general.

198
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I am the ex-convict.

199
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
I will send all of the army to Changzhou.

200
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
Prince Xin

201
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Prince Xin wanted to be better in this situation.

202
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
He wants to stay in Changzhou

203
00:11:58,000 --> 00:11:59,680
and improve the quality of court

204
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
so as to dispel our militarychw sexual kry Salvage.

205
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,140
дум

206
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,140
he wants to seize our haircut from Zhe Xi army.

207
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Hmm?

208
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,140
Father said so.

209
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:12,540
Father also smash down

210
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,580
the three branches ofсck to the crown prince.

211
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:16,140
But the moment he was arson,

212
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:18,100
the Serping Guard couldn't compete with Cybercwolf.

213
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,500
So he took

214
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,780
To take the heartyt of Chang'Zhou.

215
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,860
Sun Jing is a army of big haul.

216
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,140
Thewords are used against them.

217
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,700
Fl personality.

218
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,420
their might is not over.

219
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,000
To lady Prince passaigati設

220
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,340
is ill.

221
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,220
King of Qi?

222
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,780
You are such a third-cold man.

223
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,460
Well.

224
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,620
As this is the second plight,

225
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,820
you can only win the battle.

226
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,140
You can fight both teams

227
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:49,700
in every battlefield given three rounds.

228
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,940
Come on, express it.

229
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,720
To yours first.

230
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,280
To yours first

231
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,140
Your Majesty,

232
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:00,580
what business do you have?

233
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,300
Prince Qin's son…

234
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,120
His Majesty...

235
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:04,580
And princess Qin's.

236
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,260
Your Majesty, pleaseborn her through the word of rank.

237
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,340
Didn't you ask him to close the door?

238
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:11,700
Do you know where you are?

239
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:14,300
You're like a memorial.

240
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,220
Do you want to see it?

241
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,940
Father,

242
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,260
you'd better take a look.

243
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,300
If Third Brother has any request,

244
00:13:20,420 --> 00:13:21,700
you'd better go to the doctor.

245
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:38,540
Yes, Father.

246
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:43,620
It man-ducks my eyes.

247
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:47,660
I'm afraid I'llend my life with you.

248
00:13:49,260 --> 00:13:50,620
Yisei is my personal bomber.

249
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,880
Is a man

250
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,660
who imitates your mind.

251
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:56,340
My love

252
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,340
is obviously yours,

253
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,980
so I can't

254
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,900
explain to you what happened to him.

255
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:09,380
denigrating the grandmother to think met smoother inauthentic.

256
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,700
To policy to equal basic law.

257
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:14,440
I dare not act recklessly.

258
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:20,260
But the royal decision of Grandfather cannot be easily challenged.

259
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,720
I have控utened Your Majesty.

260
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:35,720
Please solids the grandusi to him.

261
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,600
by the court debate.

262
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,000
Maybe it's the Been easiest

263
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,680
to get rid of him in the past few days.

264
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:43,760
Your Highness.

265
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:45,360
Please send her back to her manor

266
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:46,840
and tips her childhood.

267
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,380
Please make nem30

268
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,040
to assume Goddess Ji

269
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,760
diseases as soon as possible.

270
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:54,480
Do you agree, your Highness?

271
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,360
Only when the bow is the first thing

272
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,800
possessed in the Palace

273
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,720
will we become the crown prince this evening.

274
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,320
Don't be ridiculous,

275
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,720
I don't want to hear it from you.

276
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:09,120
I don't want to let Prince of Xin and Prince of Qi lead the army to Changzhou.

277
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,680
I understand.

278
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,000
I will tell my father about your business.

279
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:30,120
Father, what did Third Brother say in the memorial?

280
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:33,520
He said he didn't want to be a man.

281
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,720
He asked to be his mother.

282
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,920
He didn't want to be a man for Third Brother.

283
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,320
He even asked Father to be his mother.

284
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:48,520
Why did he suddenly admit his mistake?

285
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:51,120
So,

286
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,720
we must be careful.

287
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:55,720
Look.

288
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,720
He wants to know what he's been thinking about for a few days.

289
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,720
Third Brother may be just saying it out loud.

290
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:07,720
He still hates Father in his heart.

291
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:10,720
Since he's already admit his mistake,

292
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,720
I think it's better to pursue the trend and become a Consort Xian.

293
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:18,320
After all, you and Lai'er's mother have been pursuing the Empress.

294
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:21,120
Those ministers are also making sense.

295
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,120
I only have three sons.

296
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:27,120
Only his mother is being pursued as a Zhao Yi.

297
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,520
A Zhao Yi?

298
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,320
It's indeed inappropriate.

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:35,320
Third Brother, at this time,

300
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:40,120
I think he wants to take the army to Changzhou.

301
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,720
If he admits his mistake and Father takes the army,

302
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,320
it's too much for him to take.

303
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:47,120
How can he make him

304
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,520
feel the danger of taking the throne?

305
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,720
Don't worry.

306
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:54,720
Since he's been thinking about the future,

307
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:58,720
let him think about the future for a while.

308
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,320
Wei,

309
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:04,720
Prince Qin has been thinking about the future for so long.

310
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,320
Why did he suddenly think of that?

311
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:11,720
He asked the Emperor to pursue the mother as a Zhao Yi.

312
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,120
But he didn't become the Emperor's order.

313
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:18,120
In the end, he became Consort Xian.

314
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,520
This matter has been settled.

315
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:23,920
Prince Qin has already retired.

316
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,320
Shouldn't this matter have been settled?

317
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,320
We can settle the dispute.

318
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,320
But if we're hurt,

319
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,920
we can't just say it out loud.

320
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,320
I have to go see him.

321
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,720
Wei, we finally managed to get into the palace.

322
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,320
Prince Qin's mansion is so big.

323
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,320
Where is the palace?

324
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,520
Don't you have a fever?

325
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,320
Hurry and ask Er Dong to bring you in.

326
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,920
Yes.

327
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:18,120
Tao Zi, He Xiao Wei, why are you here?

328
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
Hurry and take our Xiao Wei to see Prince Qin.

329
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:21,520
Okay, follow me.

330
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,920
Let's go.

331
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,120
Let's go.

332
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:30,120
Bring me some wine.

333
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,720
Bring me some wine.

334
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,920
Just put it down. I'll make some wine.

335
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,720
Don't I really need to make wine?

336
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:48,320
One person is alone, but the other is hurt.

337
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,920
I'll accompany you.

338
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,920
Why are you here?

339
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:58,320
I came to see if the Prince Qin's mansion

340
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,320
is surrounded by nine-leafed-beast forest.

341
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,320
What's the day when everyone is pregnant?

342
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
Nine-leafed-beast forest is not here.

343
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,320
No one is here.

344
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,720
It's indeed here.

345
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,320
It's time.

346
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:25,320
Shi Qi Lang, are you okay?

347
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:30,120
I'm fine.

348
00:19:40,920 --> 00:19:44,920
My mother died for me.

349
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,520
Since I came to this world,

350
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,520
I've never had a life like this.

351
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
She was born in a humble family.

352
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,920
She was born in a mansion of Prince Liang.

353
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,520
She was like a wild grass.

354
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
No one asked her for money.

355
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,520
No one cared about her.

356
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,920
She died many years ago.

357
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
She didn't even have a name.

358
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,120
I thought about it on the court that day.

359
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,120
Even if I don't do it for Prince Qin,

360
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,120
I'll still help her.

361
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,120
Even if...

362
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,120
Even if it's just a name.

363
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:33,120
But it's just a name.

364
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:36,120
They wouldn't even give it to her.

365
00:20:38,120 --> 00:20:39,120
Father.

366
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,520
They wouldn't give anything to her.

367
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Since I knew my father didn't like me,

368
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,120
he blamed me for killing my mother.

369
00:20:54,720 --> 00:21:00,120
I thought he was so selfish to care about my mother.

370
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,120
Now I've realized

371
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:10,120
that he doesn't care about my mother's death.

372
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,520
He's so despicable to her.

373
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,720
You know,

374
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,520
my mother is living for me.

375
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,520
Isn't it unknowable?

376
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:33,520
My mother ate a lot of bitter fruits for me.

377
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,720
It's said that the medicine she had before

378
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,520
was all for a little god.

379
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:44,120
But when my mother was alive,

380
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:46,120
she often said that

381
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:49,120
the most valuable thing in her life

382
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:52,120
was to give birth to me.

383
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,320
Shiqielang,

384
00:21:56,120 --> 00:22:02,120
what evil, evil, and son are all nonsense.

385
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:05,920
Your mother has been trying to bring you to the world.

386
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,920
She doesn't want to see you being selfish now.

387
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:13,520
But she wants you to live a life of self-pity.

388
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:19,920
Self-pity?

389
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,920
Self-pity?

390
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,920
There's no self-pity in life.

391
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:35,920
I thought

392
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:38,920
if I'm recovered from the Xichang Capital,

393
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:41,120
I can attain Complete Patience.

394
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,420
But now,

395
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,920
you see,

396
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,920
the imperial palace

397
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,740
will be filled with

398
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,240
ames and nå tw интests.

399
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,240
I beg you to paused and settle down.

400
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,240
I can't do anything.

401
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,240
I can't even do anything.

402
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,240
I can't even be a citizen

403
00:23:19,240 --> 00:23:20,240
for my mother.

404
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:24,240
I can't do anything.

405
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,240
I don't know what else I can do.

406
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,240
I think

407
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,240
I'm useless.

408
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,240
I think I'm useless.

409
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,240
Father.

410
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,240
Actually, I'm very sad.

411
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:01,240
But I feel very sad.

412
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,240
I know it's a mistake.

413
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,240
Actually,

414
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,240
I'm very sorry for my mother.

415
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:27,240
Why?

416
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
Because she can always be with you.

417
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:36,240
I'm here to see you.

418
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,240
But you're leaving soon.

419
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:46,240
Okay.

420
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,240
I promise you.

421
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,240
I won't leave.

422
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:54,240
I won't leave tonight.

423
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,240
Really?

424
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,240
Really.

425
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,240
Taozi.

426
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:34,240
Why are you so anxious?

427
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,240
You left me alone.

428
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,240
Because I...

429
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,240
Because I went to get this for you.

430
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,240
What is this?

431
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:44,240
These are the herbs I picked for you.

432
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:45,240
Look.

433
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,240
This is yellow mushroom.

434
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,240
And this is the rose.

435
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,240
This is white wine.

436
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,240
And these.

437
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,240
I bought these herbs in the pharmacy.

438
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:55,240
After I went to the mountains,

439
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:56,240
I was so dry.

440
00:25:58,240 --> 00:25:59,240
Actually,

441
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,240
I've never thought of you.

442
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:03,240
I want to pick up the herbs.

443
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,240
You pick them every time you miss me.

444
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,240
Then I'll see

445
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,240
if you miss me.

446
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
If you miss me,

447
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
I'll pick it up more than 30 times.

448
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:27,240
Then,

449
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,240
if you miss me,

450
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,240
you can come to see me.

451
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:33,240
You can write a letter

452
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:36,240
like a prince and a filial son.

453
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,240
Really?

454
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:40,240
Of course.

455
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,240
Then, Taozi,

456
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:46,240
have you ever

457
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,240
missed me?

458
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,240
Then you guess it.

459
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
I guess

460
00:26:58,240 --> 00:26:59,240
you must have thought of me.

461
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:01,240
Why are you so stubborn?

462
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:04,240
Because if you don't miss me,

463
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,240
you won't call me to see you.

464
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:08,240
Nor will you call me

465
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,240
to write a letter to you

466
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:10,240
like a 17-year-old.

467
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,240
Really?

468
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,240
I'll say it.

469
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,240
It's okay.

470
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:28,240
I'll say it.

471
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,240
It's late.

472
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,240
It's late.

473
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:04,240
I should leave.

474
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:08,240
You don't have to leave.

475
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,240
It's late.

476
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,240
I'll let you go

477
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,240
if you need another poem.

478
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:23,240
As you wish,

479
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,240
the world

480
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,240
is your power.

481
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,240
Why do you need me?

482
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,240
I don't want the world.

483
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,240
I only want you.

484
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,240
You don't want the world.

485
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,240
But you want the people of the world,

486
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,240
but you won't let them go.

487
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:49,240
Then, let the world be theirs.

488
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:52,240
Don't want anything.

489
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,240
I only want you.

490
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,240
I only want you.

491
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
I only want you.

492
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:26,240
I only want you.

493
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
You don't want the world.

494
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,240
But you want the people of the world,

495
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,240
but you won't let them go.

496
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:31,240
I only want you.

497
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
You don't want the world.

498
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,240
But you want the people of the world,

499
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,240
but you won't let them go.

500
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:38,240
You don't want the world.

501
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,240
But you want the people of the world,

502
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
but you won't let them go.

503
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,240
You don't want the world.

504
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:48,240
But you want the people of the world,

505
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
but you won't let them go.

506
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,240
You don't want the world.

507
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
But you want the people of the world,

508
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
but you want the world.

509
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Shi Qi Lang.

510
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Shi Qi Lang.

511
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,240
You're finally awake.

512
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,240
What time is it now?

513
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
It's already past five o'clock.

514
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,240
I remember.

515
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,240
I remember I drank a lot in the room last night.

516
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,240
And then I drank too much.

517
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
I had a beautiful dream.

518
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,240
What dream did you have?

519
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:32,240
A dream

520
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:36,240
that I was very happy about.

521
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,240
It's like real.

522
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:43,240
You must have dreamed of the Hexia Wei.

523
00:31:45,240 --> 00:31:47,240
Where did the Hexia Wei come from?

524
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,240
I think you have a similar disease.

525
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:53,240
You're as ill as a tall man.

526
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:55,240
Last night,

527
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,240
you were here drinking wine.

528
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,240
I want to drink with you.

529
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
And you drove me away.

530
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,240
Yes.

531
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Xiao Wei, have some.

532
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:17,240
You eat.

533
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,240
I don't have any appetite.

534
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:21,240
But you don't have any appetite.

535
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
You didn't sleep last night.

536
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:27,240
Shall we go to the front town to find a inn?

537
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:29,240
We'll be there in the evening.

538
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:30,240
No need.

539
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:32,240
Actually, I had a fight last night.

540
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,240
Tell me.

541
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:38,240
You're so polite.

542
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,240
You dare to meet Prince Qin in Pixing.

543
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,240
Why don't you stay for a few days?

544
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:45,240
You only said that to Prince Qin.

545
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,240
That's enough.

546
00:32:49,240 --> 00:32:50,240
I just want to see him.

547
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,240
I'm relieved.

548
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,240
I'm relieved.

549
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,240
If someone else finds out,

550
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,240
I'll be able to give him a lot of advice.

551
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,240
But I don't know

552
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,240
how sad and guilty he is.

553
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,240
How long will it take to make him feel better?

554
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,240
I still think

555
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:11,240
it's better for the two of us

556
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:13,240
to stay together for a long time.

557
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,240
You only said such a harsh words.

558
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,240
That's not enough.

559
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,240
I think some people

560
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,240
want to be with him

561
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,240
for a long time.

562
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,240
Xiao Wei.

563
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:29,240
But don't say that.

564
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,240
I just left him for a while.

565
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,240
I really miss him.

566
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:36,240
What about you?

567
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,240
Do you miss Prince Qin?

568
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:43,240
Indeed.

569
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:45,240
I miss him all the time.

570
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,240
I miss him so much.

571
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,240
Indeed.

572
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,240
17.

573
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,240
17.

574
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:09,240
17.

575
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:20,240
What did you do?

576
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:22,240
Didn't Taozi come yesterday?

577
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:23,240
He said he wanted to eat dried fruit.

578
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:24,240
So I bought some in the morning.

579
00:34:24,240 --> 00:34:26,240
I was going to find someone to send it to him.

580
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:28,240
Taozi came yesterday?

581
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:29,240
Yes.

582
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:30,240
He came with Xiao Wei.

583
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:33,240
I don't know where he is now.

584
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,240
Did he eat?

585
00:34:46,240 --> 00:34:47,240
When did they leave?

586
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:49,240
They left without telling me.

587
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:51,240
Xiao Wei said it was hard to let the guards see it.

588
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:53,240
So they left without telling me.

589
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,240
I'm going to see him.

590
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,240
I have a lot to tell him.

591
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,240
17.

592
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,240
But His Majesty ordered you to close the door.

593
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,240
You can't do that.

594
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:05,240
What do you think?

595
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,240
The prince of Heaven is here.

596
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,240
I'm going to see him.

597
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,240
17.

598
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:40,240
Sir.

599
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,240
Please have a seat.

600
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Sir.

601
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,240
Do you want to try our new tea?

602
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:44,240
It's very delicious.

603
00:35:44,240 --> 00:35:45,240
Okay.

604
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,240
Let's eat first.

605
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,240
Okay.

606
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,240
Xiao Wei.

607
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:52,240
We can feel the sunset in the dark.

608
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:58,240
Your shop is quite elegant.

609
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,240
You can buy tea and flowers.

610
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,240
Enjoy yourselves.

611
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:06,240
Xiao Wei, try it.

612
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,240
It smells good.

613
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,240
How come there's more?

614
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,240
Can't you come out?

615
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:25,240
It's so crowded here.

616
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:30,240
Why are you here?

617
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,240
I just want to come and see you.

618
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:36,240
You didn't see enough last night?

619
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:41,240
Last night, I didn't see it clearly.

620
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,240
I'm so sorry.

621
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:44,240
I ran so far to see you.

622
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:45,240
I told you to stop.

623
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,240
I'm willing to do it.

624
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I don't think it's hard.

625
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:51,240
I'll go see you in a few days.

626
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:54,240
You're so mean.

627
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:56,240
Aren't you afraid of being misunderstood?

628
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:58,240
You thought you'd bring the soldiers

629
00:36:58,240 --> 00:36:59,240
to take back Luoyang?

630
00:37:00,240 --> 00:37:01,240
My father has been thinking

631
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:02,240
to fight with Prince Qin

632
00:37:02,240 --> 00:37:04,240
on the battlefield.

633
00:37:04,240 --> 00:37:06,240
Do you want to give him such a chance?

634
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,240
If he sent you away,

635
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,240
my father would lose.

636
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:12,240
If he saves Qin,

637
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:14,240
it's a pity that he's a wolf.

638
00:37:14,240 --> 00:37:15,240
You want to protect Luoyang?

639
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:18,240
Don't worry, Your Highness.

640
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
If you're in danger,

641
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:21,240
I'll help you out.

642
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Okay.

643
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,240
I'll do my best.

644
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:29,240
But Prince Qin is too brave.

645
00:37:29,240 --> 00:37:31,240
Don't give me such a chance.

646
00:37:31,240 --> 00:37:33,240
I'll do my best.

647
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,240
Then you'll always owe me a favor.

648
00:37:35,240 --> 00:37:37,240
I can't repay it.

649
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
I think Li Ni

650
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
is just a little bit too close.

651
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,240
She gave the letter to my father

652
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:53,240
to say she'd like to be his mother-in-law.

653
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,240
But my father

654
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,240
is just going to be his mother-in-law?

655
00:37:57,240 --> 00:38:00,240
Li Ni is thinking about it.

656
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,240
She's always thinking about

657
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,240
how to re-enact the army.

658
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Brother,

659
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:07,240
my father told you to stay

660
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:09,240
and hold the mother-in-law's memorial.

661
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:12,240
He told you to take over the general's position.

662
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:15,240
He told General Pei to lead the army alone in Changzhou.

663
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,440
We need to stop Li Ni's

664
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,240
from doing anything to protect Changzhou.

665
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
What's more,

666
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,240
he even took the military power from the Xi army.

667
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:26,240
Don't worry.

668
00:38:26,240 --> 00:38:28,240
Since I'm the general of the army,

669
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,240
I won't give them a chance.

670
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,240
I only said that I'm in danger in Changzhou.

671
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,240
I only want Pei Yuan to bring

672
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:38,240
three-layered military force and two-storey immortal.

673
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,240
He'll think that

674
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:42,240
there's a big army in Changzhou.

675
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,240
He's just dreaming.

676
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:48,240
Didn't Pei Yuan only listen to Li Ni's instructions?

677
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,240
If this war is over,

678
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,240
I'll see

679
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,240
if Li Ni can still keep her.

680
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,240
Chief Zhao,

681
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
you've just been discharged from the army.

682
00:39:01,240 --> 00:39:04,240
You should take a break.

683
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Li Ni is a very old man.

684
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:11,240
I guess he's going to stop me

685
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:14,240
from returning to the army in Changzhou.

686
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:16,240
The news came from the capital.

687
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,240
Li Ni was dismissed from the general's office.

688
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,240
He ordered to close the door.

689
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:24,240
He probably used the trust of the king and the king.

690
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
It's too difficult.

691
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:29,240
He's so incompetent.

692
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,240
Three armies.

693
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:33,240
A small man like Lord Liang

694
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,240
can't be a emperor.

695
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,240
He's so weak.

696
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,240
He's so self-abuse.

697
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,240
Chief Zhao!

698
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,240
Chief Zhao,

699
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:46,240
send the people who are after Taicun back to the capital.

700
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:50,240
Taicun is hiding in the city of Yishu near the capital.

701
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:01,240
Send the order to ask Taicun to kill the rest of them.

702
00:40:01,240 --> 00:40:03,240
Yes.

703
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,240
It's a great day.

704
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,240
I wish you a happy life.

705
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:29,240
Peiyuan sent a letter to the capital.

706
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:32,240
He said the army of the hundred-month army

707
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:34,240
has passed the flood.

708
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
He forced Changzhou to

709
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,240
urge the court to capture the army of Changzhou.

710
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:42,240
He urged the court to send troops.

711
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
Father,

712
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,240
according to my opinion,

713
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,240
the army of the hundred-month army

714
00:40:49,240 --> 00:40:51,240
is not as good as the one in the faraway land.

715
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:54,240
And there are no supplementary supplies on the way to the capital.

716
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,240
Only a few thousands of people.

717
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:59,240
Peiyuan was born in the army of the five generals.

718
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:01,240
He's been in the army for many years.

719
00:41:01,240 --> 00:41:03,240
He won't even be able to handle it now.

720
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:05,240
General Pei is a member of the court.

721
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,240
If the court doesn't know the truth,

722
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:09,240
I'm afraid Peiyuan will have a new idea.

723
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:12,240
Father, you're the woman.

724
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,240
Peiyuan is great.

725
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:17,240
That's also the father's son.

726
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,240
If he wants anything,

727
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:20,240
what will he give?

728
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:23,240
What's the problem with the father?

729
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:26,240
The court only sent three-layered troops.

730
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:28,240
There's not much to do.

731
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,240
Father,

732
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:33,240
Li Ni led the troops to the west.

733
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,240
The court never spread the provisions.

734
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,240
The west army is also in the long-term.

735
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
From the old manor,

736
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,240
they've been killed for two jin.

737
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:44,240
Now the court has sent the west army again.

738
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,240
It's spread three-layered provisions.

739
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:49,240
The so-called reinforcements

740
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,240
are just to eat and drink.

741
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,240
These are all the rules in the army.

742
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,240
Father,

743
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,240
don't be fooled by them.

744
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,240
You're the general of the army.

745
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:01,240
How can you

746
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:04,240
restore Peiyuan with your sword?

747
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:06,240
According to the court,

748
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:08,240
the court must order

749
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:10,240
Peiyuan to disobey the order.

750
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
He will immediately

751
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,240
send a letter from Changzhou

752
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,240
to destroy the Sun Bu rebels in the last 100 months.

753
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,240
You're still here?

754
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,240
You said you'd send the general of the west army

755
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:24,240
to the north.

756
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:25,240
When the war started,

757
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,240
the army only gave

758
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,240
three-layered provisions and two-layered provisions.

759
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Now, they're not sending the reinforcements

760
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,240
to the north.

761
00:42:32,240 --> 00:42:33,240
They're not sending reinforcements

762
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:35,240
to the north.

763
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,240
Isn't that to make the soldiers

764
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,240
of the west army die?

765
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:41,240
Leave it to Taozi.

766
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:43,240
When did you

767
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,240
write the letter to the He Family?

768
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,240
The court refused to send reinforcements

769
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
to the north.

770
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,240
Instead, they want Peiyuan to leave the capital.

771
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,240
I can't leave the capital.

772
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:53,240
Now,

773
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:55,240
I have to ask the Cui Family to help

774
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
the Cui Family.

775
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:58,240
Okay. I'll go now.

776
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Shiqing,

777
00:43:01,240 --> 00:43:03,240
you asked the Cui Family to solve Changzhou's problem.

778
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:05,240
Can this be solved?

779
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
Anyway, I said it in my heart.

780
00:43:06,240 --> 00:43:08,240
I was trapped in Changzhou.

781
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:10,240
He can't die.

782
00:43:18,240 --> 00:43:19,240
What are you looking at?

783
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
I'm looking at

784
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,240
the world's first white face.

785
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:25,240
What is it?

786
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
If you want to beg, you can beg.

787
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,240
You can't be too rich.

788
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,240
If you can use a letter to solve Changzhou's problem,

789
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:37,240
this soft meal is really

790
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:39,240
a waste of money.

791
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,240
I dare not.

792
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:42,240
I dare not.

793
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:54,240
You're so selfish.

794
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:58,240
I think Prince Qi is wrong.

795
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:00,240
What's wrong?

796
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:02,240
He must know

797
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,240
that if you're fine,

798
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:04,240
you'll be able to

799
00:44:04,240 --> 00:44:06,240
get the magic wand.

800
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:08,240
But you have to use the herb to do this.

801
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,240
What if he gets it broken in three days?

802
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,240
He should

803
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:14,240
use wood to cast a spell.

804
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,240
That's how he'll accept it.

805
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,240
It's still a good idea.

806
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,240
Otherwise,

807
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:21,240
he wouldn't have thought of

808
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,240
making you a young man.

809
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,240
Why can't he get it broken?

810
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,240
It seems that

811
00:44:25,240 --> 00:44:28,240
Prince Qin is really not a good man.

812
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:29,240
Wei.

813
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,240
Wei.

814
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,240
Why did you say that Cao Cao is here?

815
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:37,240
It's a letter from the Qin.

816
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,240
Your Majesty.

817
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:52,240
Your Majesty.

818
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,240
The report from Changzhou.

819
00:44:53,240 --> 00:44:54,240
How is it?

820
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:56,240
General Pei was ordered to attack.

821
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:57,240
He was shot to death two days later.

822
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:59,240
He was killed by the Sun Bu rebels.

823
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,240
The Zhan Xi army didn't survive.

824
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,240
General Pei was killed by the Shen Bu.

825
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,240
What about Changzhou?

826
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
General Pei and Cui Yi

827
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,240
took Cui's army to the capital.

828
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,240
They killed Sun Bu rebels.

829
00:45:09,240 --> 00:45:11,240
General Pei took the Zhan Xi army to the river.

830
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,240
He should be in the city of Changzhou.

831
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:17,240
But Cui Yi took Cui's army

832
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
and entered Changzhou.

833
00:45:18,240 --> 00:45:19,240
What?

834
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,240
Cui Yi took Changzhou?

835
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
Father.

836
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,240
Changzhou is a military camp.

837
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
No matter it's in Sun Jing's hands

838
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
or Cui Yi's hands,

839
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
it's all against us.

840
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:29,240
Father.

841
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,240
Cui Yi lost Changzhou.

842
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
He's the one to blame.

843
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,240
Brother.

844
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:36,240
Isn't it time to talk about the team?

845
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:38,240
Changzhou was lost by Pei Yuan.

846
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:40,240
Why can't he be the one to blame?

847
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:44,240
Father refused General Pei's request.

848
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:46,240
General Pei personally went to the palace

849
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,240
to ask for Father's help.

850
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,240
He sent the Zhan Xi army to help him.

851
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:52,240
But you said

852
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:54,240
General Pei was a military camp.

853
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
He was in a fight.

854
00:45:55,240 --> 00:45:57,240
Then he sent three imperial decree to Changzhou.

855
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,240
He was in a fight.

856
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:01,240
Now Changzhou is lost.

857
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:04,240
If General Pei is the one to blame,

858
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:07,240
I'm afraid Pei's family won't agree.

859
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:12,240
Let's find a way.

860
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,240
Cui Yi killed Pei.

861
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
He took Dong Du last time.

862
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
Now he's in Changzhou.

863
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Let's go down.

864
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:19,240
What's the point of being the emperor?

865
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:20,240
What's the point of being the emperor?

866
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
Father.

867
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:23,240
I want to protect someone.

868
00:46:23,240 --> 00:46:25,240
If this person can lead the army to war,

869
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I'll take over Changzhou.

870
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
Who is it?

871
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:30,240
I'll protect three brothers.

872
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:31,240
No.

873
00:46:31,240 --> 00:46:32,240
Li Ni is in the door.

874
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:34,240
How can he lead the army?

875
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,240
Three brothers can fight well.

876
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,240
Besides, he fought with Sun Jing and Zhu Bu.

877
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Cui's army fought with them.

878
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:40,240
They're all good friends.

879
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:42,240
Besides, in the Manchang Cultural and Dance,

880
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,240
only three brothers and Pei's family are close.

881
00:46:44,240 --> 00:46:46,240
If three brothers lead the army to Changzhou,

882
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:49,240
they might be able to cancel Pei's army.

883
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
They'll be re-enact.

884
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Li Ni is so arrogant.

885
00:46:55,240 --> 00:46:57,240
You're so arrogant.

886
00:46:57,240 --> 00:46:59,240
Is that how it is?

887
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,240
Who can lead the army to war at this moment?

888
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,240
Is it possible for you to fight with them?

889
00:47:05,240 --> 00:47:07,240
You're the eldest son of father.

890
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:09,240
Even if you're the first one to fight,

891
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:11,240
it's impossible for the Manchang Cultural and Dance

892
00:47:11,240 --> 00:47:13,240
to lead the army to war.

893
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,240
All right.

894
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,240
I'm right.

895
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:20,240
Go and wear the edict.

896
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:23,240
Prince Qin is very cautious.

897
00:47:23,240 --> 00:47:25,240
He's very strict.

898
00:47:25,240 --> 00:47:27,240
He's in a hurry to lead the army

899
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:29,240
to Changzhou.

900
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:30,240
Yes.
