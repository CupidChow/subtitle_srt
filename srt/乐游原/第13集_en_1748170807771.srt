1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
Would you insist on roaming the world?

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:11,380
I'm still afraid to fall asleep and cry about it.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,340
I thought I could have had a paper doll.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,320
IHe, for your投稿 which was lacking things,

5
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,040
did join someaws from fancy,

6
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:21,940
cuarto of that time.

7
00:00:21,940 --> 00:00:26,780
If we consider a couple in exactly the same age,

8
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,780
My night passes by, and the night falls into the river

9
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:39,780
I want to see the mirror of the dark night

10
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:42,780
The sky is long

11
00:00:43,780 --> 00:00:45,780
When the rain and the wind are separated

12
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:48,780
When the rain and the wind are separated

13
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,780
I will never forget

14
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:56,780
The light of the future

15
00:00:56,780 --> 00:01:01,780
The sky is full of light

16
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:05,780
In the broken wind and the wind are broken

17
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,780
The sky is long

18
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,780
When the rain and the wind are separated

19
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:16,780
I will never forget

20
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,780
I will never forget

21
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:24,780
I will never forget

22
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,780
I will never forget

23
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,780
I will never forget

24
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:36,780
I will never forget

25
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,780
The Long Ballad

26
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,780
Episode 14

27
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:45,780
Young Master.

28
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:46,780
A Ying.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
Be careful.

30
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,780
A Ying.

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,780
How is your injury?

32
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:58,780
Don't worry, Young Master.

33
00:01:58,780 --> 00:01:59,780
I'm fine.

34
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:01,780
It's just a minor injury.

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:04,780
You were seriously injured.

36
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:06,780
Here.

37
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:08,780
Drink the medicine first.

38
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:10,780
Here.

39
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:12,780
Drink the medicine first.

40
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,780
Drink it.

41
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:31,780
A Ying.

42
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:33,780
My injury is fine.

43
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,780
We will go back to Yingzhou

44
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,780
as soon as possible, okay?

45
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,780
I've asked the doctor

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,780
about the injury.

47
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:41,780
They said

48
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:43,780
we must take a good rest.

49
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,780
A Ying.

50
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:46,780
It's a minor injury.

51
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,780
We can't do it here.

52
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:50,780
Look.

53
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,780
This is what the Zhen Xi Army is doing.

54
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:56,780
Lin Yi kept you and me.

55
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:58,780
I was afraid that he would be killed.

56
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:01,780
Yingzhou is in a critical situation.

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,780
You know it.

58
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:05,780
The Zhen Xi Army is taking care of Luo Yang.

59
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,780
He is also my superior.

60
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:10,780
He is going to attack our Cui family army.

61
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,780
I'm afraid that...

62
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,780
The Zhen Xi Army won't do that.

63
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,780
Do you think the Zhen Xi Army won't do that?

64
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
Or do you think Lin Yi won't do that?

65
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,780
Sun Jing is not out.

66
00:03:20,780 --> 00:03:22,780
The Zhen Xi Army is the king of Qin.

67
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,780
No matter what,

68
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,780
the Zhen Xi Army won't do that to us.

69
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,780
Sun Jing is already in a critical situation.

70
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,780
The East Poison is also in a critical situation.

71
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,780
His 100,000 troops are in the south.

72
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,780
If Lin Yi sees the West Poison,

73
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:39,780
Sun Jing will be punished by the Gu's.

74
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,780
He is the only one who can do that.

75
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,780
If Lin Yi attacks the West Poison,

76
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,780
he will take our hand and

77
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:49,780
go to the Xie Po to help our father and Cui family army.

78
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:50,780
You are so smart.

79
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:53,780
Don't say that the West Poison is in a critical situation.

80
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,780
Even if Lin Yi attacks the West Poison,

81
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,780
he won't do anything to us.

82
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,780
You are being forced into the Cui family army.

83
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:02,780
If you are in the Cui family army's comfort,

84
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,780
your father's comfort will be so great.

85
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,780
You should go to the Qingxin

86
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,780
to beg for a little man.

87
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:11,780
Childe, I am just a lawyer.

88
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:18,780
You are not recovered yet.

89
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,780
You should rest well.

90
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:22,780
Ying.

91
00:04:22,780 --> 00:04:23,780
Ying.

92
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:24,780
Childe.

93
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:34,780
Xiao Wei.

94
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,780
Although the secret medical device is in a critical situation,

95
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,780
you should still be careful with your wound.

96
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
You must take the medicine.

97
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:41,780
Otherwise, you will be in trouble.

98
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,780
Okay. I got it.

99
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,780
Why did you come in so suddenly?

100
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,780
When I came in, I bumped into Taozi.

101
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,780
He didn't let me stay outside.

102
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:58,780
I can only get in the window.

103
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,780
Look at what I prepared for you.

104
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:04,780
I thought it was a treasure to be in the Royal Descendant's Mansion.

105
00:05:04,780 --> 00:05:06,780
It's just a few pancakes.

106
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:08,780
Actually, there is a bowl of meat

107
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:09,780
that I want you to eat.

108
00:05:09,780 --> 00:05:11,780
But I heard from Taozi that

109
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:12,780
you should take a breath.

110
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:13,780
You can't eat the soul.

111
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:14,780
So I ate the meat.

112
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:17,780
You should eat the pancake.

113
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:19,780
What's the matter with the pancake?

114
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:21,780
It's worth the Royal Descendant's help.

115
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,780
Of course, there is no need.

116
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:24,780
I just know that your family

117
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:25,780
is very responsible for your cooking.

118
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,780
Since you can't eat meat,

119
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:30,780
you should eat the honey.

120
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
It's so hard to eat.

121
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,780
Where did you get honey?

122
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:37,780
In the afternoon,

123
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:39,780
I found a seal under the rock.

124
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:42,780
So I took it with my wife.

125
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,780
The honey is good for you.

126
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,780
You should take the medicine.

127
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,780
If you take the medicine,

128
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:50,780
you can drink the honey together.

129
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
By the way,

130
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
I have something to ask you.

131
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
What is it?

132
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,780
I will be honest and honest.

133
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,780
I will be honest.

134
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:10,780
How do you plan to convince the Royal Descendant

135
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:11,780
to take the Western Capital?

136
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:18,780
If I tell you

137
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,780
I will be a good cook,

138
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:21,780
will you believe it?

139
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,780
I believe it.

140
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:23,780
If I were you,

141
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,780
I would be a good cook, too.

142
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:26,780
I will be a good cook.

143
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,780
The Western Capital is a capital city in the state.

144
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,780
The Crown Prince has been in charge of

145
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:31,780
the ten thousand-dollar mansion for sixteen years.

146
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,780
He is a good cook.

147
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,780
Sun Jing is a famous general.

148
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:37,780
He has been a great cook.

149
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,780
His skills in cooking

150
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,780
are much better than our palace.

151
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,780
Besides, the palace is

152
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,780
much more difficult than cooking.

153
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,780
And Sun Jing is cold-hearted and cruel.

154
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:48,780
He is almost ruthless.

155
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:51,780
Can I be a good cook?

156
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:54,780
Now he has been in the army for a hundred months

157
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:56,780
and sent a large army of people to north of Yingzhou.

158
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:57,780
Actually,

159
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,780
he doesn't use the soldiers.

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:00,780
There are ten thousand soldiers

161
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,780
who are left with the hands of the city.

162
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,780
The soldiers are the emperor's family.

163
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,780
Can we move them?

164
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,780
It was the army that was in the army.

165
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,780
How about Sun Jing

166
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,780
can kill the king

167
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,780
by the power of one-sided skill?

168
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:20,780
I am confused.

169
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,780
I am confused.

170
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Confused?

171
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:29,780
Confused.

172
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,780
It's a low level.

173
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Now Sun Jing is in the army

174
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,780
and is in the army.

175
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,780
Even if he is in the army for a year and a half,

176
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:40,780
he can't kill the king.

177
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:43,780
Sun Jing must have

178
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:44,780
sent a hundred-month army

179
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
to the capital.

180
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,780
Even if we don't have the hands,

181
00:07:48,780 --> 00:07:49,780
we may not win.

182
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,780
If

183
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:54,780
I have a plan

184
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,780
and I can break it,

185
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,780
will Royal Descendant

186
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:58,780
agree to my request?

187
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:00,780
Are you willing to stay

188
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,780
and break the Western Changjing with me?

189
00:08:04,780 --> 00:08:05,780
You want to take advantage of the old Zhao

190
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,780
to relieve the difficulties of Yingzhou, right?

191
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,780
If we can break the Western Changjing,

192
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:11,780
or force Sun Jing

193
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:12,780
to turn the crisis

194
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:13,780
into the military code of Yingzhou,

195
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:15,780
Yingzhou will be our own.

196
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,780
I promise you.

197
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,780
Even if you give me ten thousand things,

198
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,780
I can promise you.

199
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,780
Royal Descendant is really a hypocrite.

200
00:08:29,780 --> 00:08:30,780
If I can't break it,

201
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,780
then you can't promise me anything.

202
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:34,780
But it's not like that.

203
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,780
If you can't break it,

204
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:38,780
I can promise you 9999 things.

205
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,780
But you have to promise me one thing.

206
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:42,780
What is it?

207
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
I haven't decided yet.

208
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,780
When I have decided,

209
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,780
you can promise me nothing.

210
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Such a weird saying.

211
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
I always think

212
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
you are planning something.

213
00:08:56,780 --> 00:08:57,780
Don't worry.

214
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,780
I won't let He Xiao make you a burden.

215
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:02,780
Then I won't let you

216
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:03,780
make you a burden.

217
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
San Lang.

218
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,780
I've found out later

219
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,780
that Cui Lin and He Shi

220
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,780
were being trained by Li Ni

221
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:33,780
after being rescued.

222
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,780
It's hard to find the secret

223
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:40,780
of the uncle's illness.

224
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Cui Lin and He Shi

225
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
were lying to each other

226
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
and killing each other.

227
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Who knows that he has a Li Ni?

228
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:49,780
Now they are both in the same place.

229
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,780
We have no choice.

230
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,780
Good Li Ni.

231
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,780
You are not a bad person.

232
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,780
San Lang, don't worry.

233
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,780
Cui Lin and He Shi's soldiers

234
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
are still in the same place.

235
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:07,780
Cui Jia and His Majesty

236
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
are also trapped in the map.

237
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,780
They can't

238
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
stay in the same place forever.

239
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:14,780
As long as we wait patiently,

240
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
we can always find a chance

241
00:10:16,780 --> 00:10:17,780
to fight again.

242
00:10:20,780 --> 00:10:21,780
I order you to

243
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:23,780
stay in the same place forever.

244
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,780
And

245
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,780
let Cui Lin and He Shi's men

246
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:27,780
investigate the secret of the uncle's illness.

247
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Once they leave the same place,

248
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:33,780
it will be their fate.

249
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
Yes.

250
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Sir.

251
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,780
Sir.

252
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,780
Sir.

253
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,780
You can't say

254
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:50,780
that you can't kill me.

255
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:51,780
Listen to me.

256
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:52,780
If we can

257
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,780
break the promise with the Emperor,

258
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:55,780
the situation in Yingzhou

259
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:56,780
will be solved in time.

260
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,780
The Emperor can't do it.

261
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,780
Besides,

262
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
besides the Xi Chang Jing,

263
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
if someone knows your identity,

264
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,780
it's a matter of the future.

265
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
Sir.

266
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:09,780
Sun Jing was a spy at the time.

267
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:10,780
But he was arrogant.

268
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,780
He never thought

269
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
that Li Ni and I

270
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:14,780
would go to Xi Chang Jing alone.

271
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
He can't do it.

272
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,780
What if...

273
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,780
If the Xi Chang Jing is solved,

274
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:22,780
Yingzhou will be the barrier.

275
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,780
If this is a real deal,

276
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
then this is the end.

277
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:27,780
Don't say anything.

278
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,780
I won't let you go.

279
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,780
You are worried about Yingzhou.

280
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
But you are worried about my safety.

281
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
But I have a feeling.

282
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Yi Jun.

283
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,780
Don't worry, sir.

284
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,780
Even if it's a promise,

285
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
I will definitely do it.

286
00:11:56,780 --> 00:11:57,780
Ying.

287
00:11:58,780 --> 00:11:59,780
I beg you.

288
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Can you not leave?

289
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
Sir.

290
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:09,780
Ying.

291
00:12:09,780 --> 00:12:10,780
I really worry about you.

292
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,780
If...

293
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
If you are in Xi Chang Jing,

294
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,780
how can I go to the capital?

295
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,780
If you are really in Xi Chang Jing,

296
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,780
I will die.

297
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:27,780
Sir.

298
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,780
I have made up my mind.

299
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
Uncle.

300
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
Take care of him.

301
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
Ying.

302
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
Sir.

303
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,780
Why don't you take the knife?

304
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
Now you are going to kill me.

305
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I can't act as a mirror.

306
00:12:47,780 --> 00:12:48,780
What if he doesn't know?

307
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,780
He...

308
00:12:50,780 --> 00:12:51,780
You just told me.

309
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,780
You planned to fight with He Shi.

310
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:57,780
You planned to go to Xi Chang Jing.

311
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:58,780
You want to get rid of him.

312
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Yes.

313
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,780
Yes.

314
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,780
You are still against me.

315
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:04,780
Fine.

316
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,780
I will go find a rope now.

317
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,780
I will tie myself up.

318
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:08,780
I don't need father to ask me.

319
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,780
I will go to the old man's father.

320
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:11,780
I will go now.

321
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:14,780
No.

322
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,780
I should tie you up.

323
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:19,780
Send the back of Zhen Xu Jun to my father.

324
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Even if you want to turn the world around,

325
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,780
it's none of my business.

326
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,780
The back of General Pei's back is in this world.

327
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,780
If you don't say it, he won't know.

328
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,780
Why are you angry?

329
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:32,780
Shi Qi Lang.

330
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,780
Think about it.

331
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:39,780
You are the commander of Zhen Xu Jun.

332
00:13:39,780 --> 00:13:40,780
My lord.

333
00:13:40,780 --> 00:13:41,780
You are suitable for two people.

334
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:43,780
You want to go to Xi Chang Jing.

335
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
If Sun Jing finds out,

336
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,780
it will be a mess.

337
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,780
You are innocent.

338
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,780
Who said that only I and him are two people?

339
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:52,780
I plan to wear a old hat and a long ear.

340
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,780
Who said that we are going to go to Xi Chang Jing?

341
00:13:54,780 --> 00:13:56,780
We will be treated like soldiers.

342
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,780
Don't talk about this.

343
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,780
I don't know what to do.

344
00:13:58,780 --> 00:13:59,780
If you don't mind,

345
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,780
let's go together.

346
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,780
I can't go with you.

347
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:03,780
Yes.

348
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,780
You can't go.

349
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,780
Hong Guan needs you here.

350
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,780
You stay here.

351
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:08,780
Wait for my good news.

352
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,780
Thank you.

353
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:15,780
After you enter Xi Chang Jing,

354
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:17,780
what do you plan to do with the plan?

355
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,780
No plan.

356
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,780
It's a spy.

357
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,780
What?

358
00:14:22,780 --> 00:14:24,780
You...

359
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,780
Don't worry.

360
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,780
There must be a plan.

361
00:14:26,780 --> 00:14:27,780
Even if something happens,

362
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,780
I will find a chance to escape.

363
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,780
But Tong Guan needs you here.

364
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,780
Stay here.

365
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:33,780
Don't worry about anything else.

366
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,780
Do you know that

367
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,780
if you are in Xi Chang Jing,

368
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,780
I can't save you?

369
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,780
They will take you

370
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,780
and threaten the whole Zhan Xi Army.

371
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:45,780
Of course.

372
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,780
Don't worry.

373
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:48,780
If I am really caught by Sun Jing,

374
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:50,780
I have made up my mind for you.

375
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,780
I will say that

376
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,780
you are already in the dark.

377
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,780
If you kill me,

378
00:14:55,780 --> 00:14:58,780
you will be a little more than a brother.

379
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:01,780
I promise that Sun Jing will die.

380
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,780
Sun Jing is not angry with you.

381
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,780
I am already angry with you.

382
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,780
So I will not kill you.

383
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,780
I will leave you alone.

384
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:11,780
Don't worry.

385
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,780
If you are really in this world,

386
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,780
I will get rid of you.

387
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:16,780
I promise.

388
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:19,780
If you are really in this world,

389
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:22,780
I will kill you.

390
00:15:27,780 --> 00:15:28,780
My lady,

391
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,780
your highness is here.

392
00:15:35,780 --> 00:15:36,780
Greetings, your highness.

393
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,780
You are welcome.

394
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:40,900
There's something I want to ask you.

395
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,860
You're welcome.

396
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,300
As you wish.

397
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:49,980
I'm in the capital.

398
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,380
I'd like to ask you to give me a letter.

399
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:53,860
I'd like to ask you to come to the capital

400
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,820
and discuss the matter of the Western Capital.

401
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:58,140
If I don't have a letter,

402
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,660
I'm afraid it's hard to get a letter.

403
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,860
You want to ask me to come to the capital.

404
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:04,660
I'm sure you're a man of faith.

405
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:06,380
Since that's the case,

406
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,900
I don't need a letter.

407
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,940
I'd like to go there myself.

408
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:10,940
No.

409
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,620
I don't want to see you

410
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:15,380
and let you have a good time.

411
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:17,420
Royal Descendant of the Imperial family is a man of faith.

412
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,220
Now the Western Capital is in a bad shape.

413
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:22,180
I'm a woman.

414
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,620
I'd like to be a man of faith

415
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:24,900
and be a man of faith.

416
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,020
My father is a man of faith.

417
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,420
He's a man of faith.

418
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:30,380
No matter what I do,

419
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,380
I'll help you.

420
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,220
Go to the Western Capital.

421
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,220
Once you're lost,

422
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,620
you'll be in danger.

423
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:41,860
Royal Descendant will let Brother Xie

424
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,340
and Brother Bao help you to enter the capital.

425
00:16:43,820 --> 00:16:45,300
They're all brave people

426
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,580
who are brave and brave.

427
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,580
I'll do everything I can

428
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:49,700
to help you.

429
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,460
If something happens,

430
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:55,380
I'll make a decision

431
00:16:56,060 --> 00:16:57,380
and won't let anyone down.

432
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,180
I've tasted it.

433
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,580
It's good.

434
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,900
This wine is from Luzhou.

435
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:13,780
Why do you want to travel to the Western Capital?

436
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,060
My master is in the capital for a long time.

437
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,220
The business is bad these two years.

438
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,100
My master is old.

439
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,100
My master asked me to come to the capital

440
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,180
by myself.

441
00:17:24,380 --> 00:17:25,580
He went to the capital by himself.

442
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,540
My Young Madam's Liang Jiayuan is in the capital.

443
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:29,060
He followed me to the capital

444
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,180
and returned to the capital.

445
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,420
He's a man of faith.

446
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:32,620
He's a man of faith.

447
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,860
He's a man of faith.

448
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:34,700
He came to the capital

449
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,500
and returned to the Liang Family to visit his elders.

450
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,180
You're awake.

451
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,860
The plan is good.

452
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:43,140
Only He Xiao Wei is the female lead.

453
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,380
Now, there's a new Miss Gu.

454
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:46,900
What should I say?

455
00:17:53,100 --> 00:17:54,500
I can only say that she's my sister.

456
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:56,980
Did you tell Miss Gu

457
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,420
about what she's going to do?

458
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,340
Yes.

459
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,500
Then, Miss Gu is going to do

460
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:01,540
your sister's business.

461
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,060
You told her too?

462
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:03,900
Yes.

463
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:05,820
Then, He Xiao Wei

464
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:07,460
is not going to say anything else.

465
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,100
He said

466
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,500
he can do her own business.

467
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,500
But I think

468
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,540
it's the same for her to do someone else's business.

469
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:15,420
It's really different.

470
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:16,420
You

471
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:17,780
should let Miss Gu

472
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,740
do He Xiao Wei's business.

473
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:37,100
Miss Gu.

474
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,300
時間 su relatively.

475
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:44,140
Miss Gu Spain is looking for you.

476
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:46,420
Don't talk about me.

477
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,980
He Xiao Wei, you're here too.

478
00:18:59,300 --> 00:18:59,580
Yes.

479
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,380
Hope you'll ensure the jobs to your master.

480
00:19:01,820 --> 00:19:02,820
All my hope

481
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,860
tablet and combat constituents

482
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,820
will be related.

483
00:19:07,220 --> 00:19:08,260
Is hong sunemp coming?

484
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,980
It's not fun the doggie,

485
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:11,660
The boss will scold either of theği

486
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:14,180
We have another big day.

487
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
If we still do not accept the demand yet,

488
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:16,800
there won't be another

489
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:18,580
effort to contribute informally

490
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,740
Although it can be said again,

491
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,620
No need to worry more

492
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:29,420
there a lot of effort

493
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,380
They said that if it weren't for Xu San Lang to go to the Ministry of Food and Food,

494
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:36,780
I'm afraid that he would have to send the food to them.

495
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,980
Madam Xu is so sad for you.

496
00:19:38,980 --> 00:19:41,980
In the future, he will surely be the mother of the one who loves you.

497
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:43,780
Mother.

498
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:48,380
Mother, the military force is here.

499
00:19:48,380 --> 00:19:51,180
Madam Xu said that the people from Sun Da Du Du Sect are taking care of the food everywhere.

500
00:19:51,180 --> 00:19:52,380
What should we do?

501
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:52,980
Hurry.

502
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,580
What should we do? Where should I hide it?

503
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:57,580
Take the clothes from mother. Hurry.

504
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,980
Hurry. There's someone in front.

505
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
Hurry.

506
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:02,980
Hurry.

507
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:06,180
Hurry. Hurry. Hurry.

508
00:20:19,180 --> 00:20:21,980
Miss Gu, just ask whatever you want to ask.

509
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,180
Did you poison the embroidery sword?

510
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,380
I did. But I also have antidote.

511
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:34,180
I'm just curious.

512
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:38,380
As a woman, He Xiao Wei has naturally been very unwell in the army.

513
00:20:38,380 --> 00:20:42,980
But how did the sound and the sound of the weapon get out of the cage?

514
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,180
What does a person look like?

515
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,380
He can't even look at his eyes.

516
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,180
I was originally like this.

517
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:53,980
I didn't have to look at my eyes. Naturally, I got out of the cage.

518
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:59,580
The world is in the middle of the world. If you ask for it, you will naturally know what's difficult.

519
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,580
Miss Gu is a smart person.

520
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,780
She must also understand.

521
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:07,580
Thank you, He Xiao Wei.

522
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,780
Help! Help!

523
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:15,780
Mother! Mother!

524
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,380
What's wrong?

525
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:19,580
Someone is shouting for help in the front door.

526
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:21,180
Help! Help!

527
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:23,580
Mother! Mother!

528
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,980
Mother! Mother!

529
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,580
Mother, wake up! Mother!

530
00:21:27,580 --> 00:21:28,980
You brat!

531
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:31,980
You dare to bite me to relieve your anger!

532
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:35,980
I won't make you a few pieces of Wei Lang today.

533
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,180
I can't bear to see you hurt.

534
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,380
Your grandfather is here!

535
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,380
I'm here!

536
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:54,380
I'm here!

537
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:56,380
I'm here!

538
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,380
I'm here!

539
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,380
I'm here!

540
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,380
Mother, thank you.

541
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:11,380
Mother! Mother!

542
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:13,580
It was the grandson who entered the world.

543
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,180
No wonder he was so cruel.

544
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:16,580
It wasn't stealing, it was killing.

545
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,380
Mother!

546
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:22,380
Mother! Mother, wake up!

547
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:25,380
Mother! Mother!

548
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,780
Mother, you're awake!

549
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,380
Mother!

550
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:36,380
Ah Shen, are you okay?

551
00:22:36,380 --> 00:22:40,580
Yes, it's these ceremony. Lu Guo saved us.

552
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:43,780
Thank you for saving me.

553
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,580
Ah Shen, don't be polite.

554
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,860
We also passed by.

555
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:48,780
The road was rough, we were able to help each other.

556
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,780
Those people were too bad.

557
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:54,780
Not only did they steal your things, they also killed innocent people.

558
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:57,380
Those were all military affairs.

559
00:22:57,380 --> 00:23:00,180
I'm afraid there will be trouble.

560
00:23:00,180 --> 00:23:02,980
Everyone left in a flash.

561
00:23:02,980 --> 00:23:06,980
At that time, they said that it was my old madam who was in a hurry

562
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:09,980
and injured the military affairs.

563
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,780
Mother, it's okay.

564
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,380
Those bad guys are all dead.

565
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:15,180
The doctors buried them.

566
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,980
They even buried grass on them.

567
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,780
Ah Shen, it's okay.

568
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,180
You can rest assured.

569
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:24,780
To save my old madam and my daughter,

570
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:27,180
they injured the military affairs.

571
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:30,180
If they were killed by the outsiders,

572
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:35,380
they would be taken to the imperial court by officials.

573
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,580
Ah Shen, don't worry.

574
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:40,580
If you don't say it, we won't say it. No one will know.

575
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,980
Ah Shen, it's late. Take Xiao Ning home.

576
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:47,180
After a few hours,

577
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,380
I'll be half of my old madam.

578
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,380
No need. Get up. Get up.

579
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:53,180
Ah Shen.

580
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:58,380
After a few hours, the cars were all food.

581
00:23:58,380 --> 00:24:00,580
After a while, we saved our mother and daughter's lives.

582
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,380
Those food were given to you.

583
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,380
No need. Thank you, Ah Shen.

584
00:24:05,380 --> 00:24:06,780
We are taking care of the people outside.

585
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:10,180
You all go to the city. We won't be able to go in anymore.

586
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:12,380
Come, mother.

587
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:17,380
Then, thank you for saving my life.

588
00:24:17,380 --> 00:24:19,780
Thank you, Ah Shen.

589
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:40,780
Miss Liu, why are you back?

590
00:24:40,780 --> 00:24:43,980
It's hard to see you. Go tell father.

591
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:46,380
Miss Liu, the husband is not feeling well.

592
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:47,780
He won't be able to enter the city.

593
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:51,180
I have an urgent matter. If you delay it, can you afford it?

594
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:53,580
Miss Liu, what urgent matter?

595
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:55,580
I'll go to the city to help father.

596
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:57,980
If I come back, there must be an urgent matter.

597
00:24:57,980 --> 00:25:00,780
You are a slave. You will be blocked from telling me.

598
00:25:00,780 --> 00:25:04,780
According to the rules, you will be punished for being a criminal.

599
00:25:04,780 --> 00:25:07,380
Miss Liu is a mess from the beginning.

600
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:10,380
Why are you suddenly so good today?

601
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,980
Miss Liu is seriously injured. Miss Liu, please come in.

602
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,980
I'll tell you right away.

603
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,780
You mean, the 17th Royal Descendant has signed the contract.

604
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:37,980
I hope we can meet again.

605
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:40,380
I'm here to see the Western Army.

606
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,580
I saw it in person.

607
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:45,380
The 17th Royal Descendant is a great man. He can fight well.

608
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:48,180
I'm here to see the Western Army.

609
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:50,180
Now, the Royal Descendant is here to see the Western Army.

610
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:53,180
He will be here to see the Western Army.

611
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:55,780
The Western Capital is also a mess.

612
00:25:55,780 --> 00:26:00,180
Although I'm a little arrogant, I'm just a little worried.

613
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:06,180
Mother, you've never been so good

614
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,580
but never said so much.

615
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:11,580
You've never said so much.

616
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:14,580
You used to be the Taiping Prime Minister of the Imperial Court.

617
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:19,580
Your daughter is different from now.

618
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,780
What's different? Tell me.

619
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,180
As the daughter of the Taiping Prime Minister,

620
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,780
as long as you respect your parents,

621
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:29,780
and respect your parents, and love your family,

622
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:32,380
you should always be sincere,

623
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:35,780
enjoy your life, and listen to your teachers.

624
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:39,780
What about now?

625
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:43,180
Father, you're the Sun Jing in the prison. You're still alive.

626
00:26:43,180 --> 00:26:46,380
You're the rice in the Golden Ceremony.

627
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:49,980
Even the Royal Descendant mentioned you.

628
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:53,580
As your daughter, you should know the truth.

629
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:55,180
You should know the world.

630
00:26:55,180 --> 00:26:58,980
You should be honest and honest.

631
00:26:58,980 --> 00:27:03,180
If you think my daughter is still ungrateful,

632
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,180
then I'm satisfied.

633
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:14,380
Mother, I've wronged you from the beginning.

634
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:17,980
Father is a state official. He's very close to his family.

635
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:22,180
How else can he be wronged by his father?

636
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:28,180
Then tell me, what's the reason why the Royal Descendant sent people to see me?

637
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,780
I apologize to my father.

638
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:34,780
I lied to my parents.

639
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,780
Actually, the Royal Descendant wasn't the one who sent people to see me.

640
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,780
He came by himself. He wanted to talk to my father.

641
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,780
Miss Gu.

642
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:02,180
Greetings, Royal Descendant.

643
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,580
Miss Gu, you're welcome.

644
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:06,380
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

645
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:09,980
Yes. After my mother returned home, she told me about my father.

646
00:28:09,980 --> 00:28:13,180
Royal Descendant has already entered the city. My father is very happy.

647
00:28:13,180 --> 00:28:15,980
He just wanted to see Royal Descendant in person.

648
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:20,380
But after my father was discharged, Sun Jing sent people to monitor him.

649
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:24,780
Although my father was able to leave the palace, he was always with me.

650
00:28:24,780 --> 00:28:27,380
I don't know how many people were there in the palace.

651
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,380
My mother pretended to be in the city and was in a good mood today.

652
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:32,180
She specially invited Royal Descendant.

653
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:36,380
She asked Royal Descendant to think of a way to make my father leave the palace.

654
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,780
She asked Royal Descendant to see me.

655
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:41,180
Miss Gu, don't worry. This is natural.

656
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,380
I'll go back and study a way.

657
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:46,980
I will surely not make Sun Jing's eyes look suspicious.

658
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,180
Thank you, Royal Descendant.

659
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:51,580
You're welcome, Miss Gu. It should be me who should thank you.

660
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,380
Royal Descendant,

661
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:58,580
have you been safe and sound since you entered the city?

662
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:01,780
We are waiting for the execution of the wine and gold.

663
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:04,580
Although the capital is under a crisis,

664
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
it's not a big deal.

665
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,180
Then I'll be at ease.

666
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,780
I still have one thing to ask for.

667
00:29:13,780 --> 00:29:15,180
Please say it.

668
00:29:15,180 --> 00:29:18,580
I came to the capital today to visit you.

669
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:21,780
I heard that the Qingyun Temple is very famous.

670
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:24,180
If you go back to the capital and see the jade,

671
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,980
you can get rid of the disease.

672
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:30,580
If you don't go back, you'll only be afraid of being caught in the trap.

673
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:34,380
Could you please go back to the capital with me?

674
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:37,180
Of course.

675
00:29:37,180 --> 00:29:39,180
Thank you, Royal Descendant.

676
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:44,380
They all said that the capital is under a crisis.

677
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:47,780
Before the execution of the wine and gold, you must go to the capital to make a wish.

678
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:51,380
I hope that the one who reads it will be safe and sound.

679
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,180
I will go back to the capital.

680
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:56,180
I will go back to the capital.

681
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,180
I will go back to the capital.

682
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
I will go back to the capital.

683
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:02,180
I will go back to the capital.

684
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:04,180
I will go back to the capital.

685
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:06,180
I will go back to the capital.

686
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:08,180
I will go back to the capital.

687
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:11,180
I will go back to the capital.

688
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,180
I will go back to the capital.

689
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:15,180
I will go back to the capital.

690
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:17,180
I will go back to the capital.

691
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,180
I will go back to the capital.

692
00:30:19,180 --> 00:30:21,180
I will go back to the capital.

693
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:23,980
Is it this one?

694
00:30:23,980 --> 00:30:25,980
It's the one next to it.

695
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:40,580
Thank you for today.

696
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:44,380
Thank you so much, Your Highness.

697
00:30:44,380 --> 00:30:46,380
It's okay, Miss Gu.

698
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,380
Just call me 17 Wolf in the future.

699
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:50,980
Okay, 17 Wolf.

700
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:53,580
Okay.

701
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:09,780
17 Wolf, the spirit of the gods is weak,

702
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:11,180
but today is a festival.

703
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:13,380
We will have a bath and bath today.

704
00:31:13,380 --> 00:31:16,380
If you want to take it back and give it to Prince Liang,

705
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:18,380
I'm afraid it won't be too late.

706
00:31:18,380 --> 00:31:21,380
The person who sent it is in the city.

707
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:26,180
They all said that the spirit of the outside world is weak.

708
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:28,780
I saw it. It was a flat tree.

709
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:31,780
It can be poisoned with poison.

710
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:34,780
I've already told the shopkeeper to prepare a lot of hot water for you.

711
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,980
Use it later to soak the bath and bath.

712
00:31:36,980 --> 00:31:38,780
It will be good for your health.

713
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,780
You went to the outside world?

714
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,980
Gu Wan Niang asked me to meet in the outside world.

715
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:46,180
She said that the hometown can be out of the city now, but it can't be out of the city.

716
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:48,380
She said that the outside world can't be out of the city.

717
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:51,380
She will be shattered every time she goes out.

718
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,980
So if we meet again, we must find a way.

719
00:31:57,180 --> 00:32:00,380
I've come up with a good idea.

720
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,780
It's a good idea to come up with a good idea so soon.

721
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:06,780
Then we must find a way soon to hold your handkerchief.

722
00:32:11,780 --> 00:32:15,380
I didn't expect that Li Ni really saved Prince Fu.

723
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:18,980
He took the Eastern capital and used troops to join the army.

724
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,180
He even forced the Western city to go to the capital.

725
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:24,780
He is going to be a great success in the future.

726
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,980
Although we lost the first chicken,

727
00:32:26,980 --> 00:32:30,580
there is a way to turn the hunting into a success.

728
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,780
Let me hear you out.

729
00:32:31,780 --> 00:32:35,580
Brother, as the late emperor, Prince Fu is a cautious bloodline.

730
00:32:35,580 --> 00:32:36,780
He is the son of the royal family.

731
00:32:36,780 --> 00:32:38,780
If Prince Fu is the heir to the throne,

732
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:41,580
that will be a great success.

733
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,180
If Prince Fu is the heir to the capital,

734
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,580
then he is not the first one to be the heir.

735
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:48,180
Who forced Prince Fu? When did he do that?

736
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:51,780
That is much more important than the Western capital.

737
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:53,780
That is the credit of the credit.

738
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:56,380
Brother, you are the eldest son.

739
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:59,580
Once Prince Fu is the heir, you will be the first official.

740
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:02,380
Who will be the heir to the Eastern palace?

741
00:33:02,380 --> 00:33:05,980
Moreover, Li Ni has the army and has the power to take down the war.

742
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:07,580
But once Prince Fu is the heir,

743
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:10,980
his war will become a great success.

744
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:18,780
Brother, you are really making a scene.

745
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:21,180
But now Prince Fu is in the same palace.

746
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:23,380
Li Ni is full of tricks.

747
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:26,980
What if Li Ni doesn't let Prince Fu go to Luoyang?

748
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,580
What will happen?

749
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:30,180
This matter needs to be dealt with by Brother Fan.

750
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:33,180
He will personally go to the same palace to attract Prince Fu.

751
00:33:33,180 --> 00:33:34,980
Prince Fu loves Brother the most.

752
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,780
If Brother Fu goes there personally,

753
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:38,580
Prince Fu will surely be happy.

754
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:40,180
If he stops,

755
00:33:40,180 --> 00:33:43,580
then he will be unfilial.

756
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:45,780
Unwilling.

757
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,580
This is unreasonable.

758
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:51,380
Don't worry. I will definitely remind Prince Fu

759
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,580
to grant you the throne.

760
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:55,980
Brother, the urgent matter now is to invite Prince Fu back.

761
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
We can't wait for the day to come.

762
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,380
As for the matter of Feng Feng, it's not urgent.

763
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,180
I know that Brother is a good man.

764
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:04,380
But I'm afraid that others will hate me.

765
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:07,380
I will lead Brother to a safe place.

766
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,980
You are still the second brother.

767
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,980
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

768
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:14,380
Husband, second brother.

769
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:16,380
I have made some soup for the kitchen.

770
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,780
You guys have been busy for a day. How much do you need?

771
00:34:18,780 --> 00:34:19,580
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

772
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:22,580
It's late. I won't disturb you.

773
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:33,780
Use it.

774
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:41,180
I talked with you for a long time tonight.

775
00:34:41,180 --> 00:34:42,780
Did something happen?

776
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:45,980
Nothing. You don't need to worry.

777
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,580
If Third Brother were here,

778
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:53,180
you three brothers would be able to support each other.

779
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:56,380
You can have a good time or a bad one.

780
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,980
You are short in three places.

781
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,380
You treat him as your brother.

782
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:01,980
He might not think like that.

783
00:35:05,380 --> 00:35:08,580
Actually, Third Brother's heart has always been very clear to you.

784
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:11,780
Otherwise, it's impossible for him to let Luo Yang out.

785
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:15,380
Is he willing to let Luo Yang out?

786
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,180
He is just trying to steal the official's heart.

787
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:20,380
Look at him. He looks like a thousand-power man.

788
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:23,780
He is actually stealing the official's heart everywhere.

789
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,980
When you just got married,

790
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:29,580
you took care of him for a few days.

791
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:32,780
Don't be fooled.

792
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,380
Okay, okay. You can go back now.

793
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:36,380
I have something to do.

794
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Go back.

795
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,780
Shi Qing Lang, the commander is here.

796
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:49,580
Something happened.

797
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,180
What's wrong?

798
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,180
Prince Lin brought the car himself.

799
00:35:53,180 --> 00:35:55,580
He took Lord Liang away from the commander.

800
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:59,180
General Xiao Fei can't do anything. He just sent someone to send his heart.

801
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:03,380
This Xiong Cheng,

802
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:08,180
he is really trying to show his true colors.

803
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,980
We won. We won.

804
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:16,380
General Wei Meng.

805
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:17,580
What did you say?

806
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:19,380
This area is a hundred years old.

807
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:20,380
Come on.

808
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:23,180
You are a cucumber.

809
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:25,980
You just said what happened to Prince Lin.

810
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:27,180
What did you say?

811
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,580
Prince Lin?

812
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:30,380
Tell me.

813
00:36:30,380 --> 00:36:33,180
I heard that you are not sleeping well.

814
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,380
You are asking for a doctor everywhere.

815
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:39,380
You even asked the State of Wu to pray for you every day.

816
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:45,980
I am really worried about Jun'er.

817
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:48,580
Your Highness, the State of Wu said

818
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:51,780
that you are a person who has a real life.

819
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:53,580
The ancestors' children and grandchildren

820
00:36:53,580 --> 00:36:55,580
can only be cured by you.

821
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,980
They are dangerous.

822
00:36:56,980 --> 00:36:58,580
As long as you are on the throne,

823
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:02,780
the evil spirit in your grandson will be defeated.

824
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,580
For the people of the world,

825
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:07,380
Your Highness, you have to be a chicken.

826
00:37:07,380 --> 00:37:09,980
That's right.

827
00:37:09,980 --> 00:37:13,380
For the people of the world,

828
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:15,980
I should do this.

829
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,580
I should do this.

830
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,980
Why did you bring me here?

831
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:27,780
This is a general's house.

832
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,980
If Xiao Ruo is wronged,

833
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,580
if he is beaten by his father,

834
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,580
he will secretly stay here in the house.

835
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:34,180
Then he will hide in the tree.

836
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:36,580
When he is in the tree,

837
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:39,180
he will look up at the sky.

838
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,980
Every summer,

839
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:43,580
Chang'an will leave here

840
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,780
and leave a empty treatment box.

841
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:49,180
I will take the treatment box and paint it.

842
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,580
Then it will look like real property.

843
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,180
Then I guess you must have scared the people

844
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,180
with this fake treatment.

845
00:37:57,180 --> 00:37:58,580
Yes.

846
00:37:58,580 --> 00:38:01,580
Li Jun is the most afraid of these bugs.

847
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:04,380
Once, he put the ink on the book

848
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:07,380
and slashed me to make me be beaten by my father.

849
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:08,580
I can't stand it.

850
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,180
I will put the empty treatment box on his bookshelf.

851
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:14,780
Then I will put him in the kitchen.

852
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,580
Okay.

853
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,980
He is going to the high villa now.

854
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:19,180
I will be beaten by my father.

855
00:38:21,580 --> 00:38:22,780
In our Yingzhou,

856
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,580
there is also a small mountain range.

857
00:38:24,580 --> 00:38:26,180
After the forest,

858
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,780
during the spring,

859
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,980
the mountain range is full of wild flowers.

860
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:32,380
When I was a kid, I often stuck on the mountain range

861
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,980
holding a horse.

862
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:35,780
I saw the clouds in the sky

863
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,780
floating slowly.

864
00:38:41,380 --> 00:38:44,780
If you could know me when I was a kid,

865
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:45,980
that would be different.

866
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:48,580
Maybe you would still think I hate you when you were a kid.

867
00:38:48,580 --> 00:38:49,980
When you first met me,

868
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,380
you didn't hate me and hate Yang Yang.

869
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,380
But you were so bad.

870
00:38:54,380 --> 00:38:55,780
You kept pushing me to the greenery

871
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:57,580
and made me soak in cold water for a long time.

872
00:38:57,580 --> 00:38:59,780
Then you even pushed me to the river.

873
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,980
Should I give you two more blows now?

874
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:06,980
Come over here.

875
00:39:13,980 --> 00:39:15,580
You said you can't play.

876
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:16,980
Why can't I play?

877
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,180
I don't care.

878
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,180
If you play, I will play.

879
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,180
Look.

880
00:39:27,380 --> 00:39:28,980
Let me play.

881
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,380
Let me play.

882
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,380
Miss.

883
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,780
Miss.

884
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:39,980
Chuan Fei.

885
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:44,180
Miss, I finally see you.

886
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,580
Why are you back?

887
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:46,980
Didn't I ask you to stay at the same place

888
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,380
to take care of Lord Liang?

889
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:50,580
Lord Liang was taken to Luoyang.

890
00:39:50,580 --> 00:39:54,180
He said it was a forest.

891
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:56,180
He was Lord Liang's son.

892
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:58,380
He brought his horse to the same place himself.

893
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,380
Lord Ling.

894
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:02,780
Lord Ling took Lord Liang away?

895
00:40:02,780 --> 00:40:04,180
Yes, Lord Ling.

896
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:10,780
I'm afraid that the wind is blowing again.

897
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,780
Why are you talking about the wind?

898
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,780
Miss, you are already home.

899
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:21,580
This incense stove is so delicious.

900
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,580
It was sent by my father.

901
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:26,580
Master.

902
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:28,380
Master treats you so well.

903
00:40:28,380 --> 00:40:29,580
No one in the house

904
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,780
dares to despise you anymore.

905
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,380
For my father,

906
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
a useful daughter

907
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,580
is a good daughter.

908
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:44,380
We have a deal with the Prime Minister.

909
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,780
We will meet him tomorrow

910
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,980
and go out with him.

911
00:40:59,380 --> 00:41:00,620
Lianming,

912
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,580
come with me.

913
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,140
Come in.

914
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:07,540
Come in.

915
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:16,500
Let the Prime Minister

916
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,820
wear only items that match the decorations.

917
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,580
I have different Heavens

918
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,260
which nữa you offer.

919
00:41:21,260 --> 00:41:22,060
Enjoy the noodles inside.

920
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:22,700
Young Master.

921
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:23,500
Look after guests.

922
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,140
Let me give the meal to you.

923
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,820
You don't like outs touch?

924
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,560
There was a risk of人- constraints after the 돌아ent Actions stop being in control.

925
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:29,420
It really started to shake it up.

926
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:31,660
The Imperial Envoy of that College,

927
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,080
I spared no effort to be quick in this field.

928
00:41:33,080 --> 00:41:34,700
Those were really friendly,

929
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,840
and he really needed to be my sole pair.

930
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:40,780
Is there anything valuable in the palace?

931
00:41:40,780 --> 00:41:43,440
Take a look andau for yourيع.

932
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:45,860
Father, I think this angle is just perfect.

933
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,600
It seemed that her whole appearance

934
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:50,340
was considered supper for self-yearning.

935
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,980
Father, please take a look at this arrow.

936
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:56,380
This arrows can be put in the gang as well so that
