Episode PB

3
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:43,000
I want to be like the mirror of the dark night

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:53,000
When the encounter is parting, when the encounter is far away, I will never forget

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The light of the sword is shining, the sky is shining brightly

6
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows through the broken wind, the sky is full of clouds

7
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows through the broken wind, the sky is full of clouds

8
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The cold snow is cold, the wind blows through the cold snow, the sky is full of clouds

9
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
I will let you be by my side, I will let you be by my side

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The sky is full of clouds, the sky is full of clouds, the sky is full of clouds

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:37,000
The wind blows through the broken wind, the sky is full of clouds

Desperate Zone

13
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,140
Wait for the grand city's

00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
swordvent to тебе

Grandaddbe

16
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Grandaddbe, did your father actually have died?

17
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
I am the crazy guy

18
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,000
What are you staring at?

19
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,600
How could he be so wronged

20
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,800
by the enemy's sword?

21
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:09,600
How could he be so wronged?

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your Highness! Your Highness!

23
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
What happened to you?

24
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Your Highness, I beg you!

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Please get up!

26
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Your Highness!

27
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
How could you hurt His Highness?

28
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
You've been lying down for years, Your Highness!

29
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Get up!

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Your Highness!

31
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Your Highness!

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
Your Highness!

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Your Highness!

34
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Your Highness!

35
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
You can't hurt His Highness!

36
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Your Highness!

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Your Highness!

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Get up!

39
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Let's think of a way to turn back.

40
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
Senior, get up!

41
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Your Highness, he's a good man.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
He's been taking me around for a while.

43
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Maybe we can turn back.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Your Highness!

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Your Highness, I beg you!

46
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Get up!

47
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
You have to love yourself!

48
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Your Highness!

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Your Highness!

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your Highness!

51
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Your Highness!

52
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
Your Highness...

53
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,920
It's late now. Still not enough time to sleep?

54
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:05,040
I've caught up certain news recently.

55
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,680
What is it?

56
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:09,280
Nothing.

57
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,240
Tao Zi,

58
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,180
help me look at the door

59
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,560
to see if General Pei is kept in.

60
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:16,360
If he looks around,

61
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:17,660
I'm sure if anyone in the house겨

62
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,080
wants to meet him,

63
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,340
please come in.

64
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,300
Shut up!

65
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,080
That's too late.

66
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:25,780
Chiefanimers are hard to get along with LEDs.

67
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,720
Do you hear it unsolvable?

68
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,680
Is he still here?

69
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,520
Yes.

70
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,560
But it's so late now.

71
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,080
The rain is so heavy.

72
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,640
If he's not here,

73
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,160
I feel that I'm not doing anything right.

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,960
I wonder if the rain is too heavy.

75
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,560
It's okay.

76
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,120
A few days ago,

77
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:53,240
my father came back alone.

78
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,800
These days,

79
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:56,840
I've never seen anyone come to you.

80
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,400
I haven't come here myself.

81
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:01,440
I think he's embarrassed to come here.

82
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,840
After all,

83
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,480
he's the one who came back.

84
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,720
He's also the one

85
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:08,120
who got you and your father trapped in this house.

86
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,080
It's like a iron cage outside.

87
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,360
We can't go out.

88
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,080
I think that

89
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,400
not long ago,

90
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:21,680
he was so badly injured.

91
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,120
This time, he went after his father.

92
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,440
I'm afraid that he won't be able to return.

93
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,560
And after he came back,

94
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,760
he never rested.

95
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,120
Taozi, you know that

96
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:35,320
he was seriously injured this time.

97
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,280
You should help me check

98
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:39,640
whether General Pei is still here.

99
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,080
I'm so worried.

100
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,560
I'm afraid something will happen.

101
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:44,880
Don't worry.

102
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:45,920
I'll go check it out now.

103
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,960
Elizabeth March

104
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,960
Episode 06

105
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,440
How is itsbuat?

106
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:22,000
You're the cleverest one, Your Highness.

107
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,280
When he got hurt very badly,

108
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:27,000
I should have been well-off for the past six months.

109
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,800
But I was too busy

110
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,400
and I was too anxious to take care of myself.

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:31,480
I was in the rain

112
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,840
and I had been kneeling for so long.

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,480
I was not feeling well.

114
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,240
I was not feeling well.

115
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,680
I'll go and report to His Majesty.

116
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll open a room first.

117
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:47,520
I remember there was a girl named Taozi

118
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:49,400
who was good at the golden needle.

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,800
His Highness was injured at that time

120
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,280
because of her.

121
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,360
How about we ask her to

122
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,160
make a toast to His Highness?

123
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,040
Father.

124
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:58,400
I'll go and ask Taozi.

125
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:58,920
Okay.

126
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,280
Your Highness.

127
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,120
I don't know how to tell Taozi.

128
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,600
Your Highness, but you're awake now.

129
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,640
Your Highness,

130
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,120
His Majesty has already asked for your help.

131
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:16,920
I believe that General Cui is innocent.

132
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:17,880
But...

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,360
But...

134
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:20,240
Your Highness,

135
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
I want to see you.

136
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:22,960
Your Highness,

137
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:30,080
you don't know

138
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:34,840
how I was hurt when this happened to me?

139
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,680
Go away!

140
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,720
Please.

141
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:46,840
Father.

142
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:54,040
I look for Master Fu

143
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,140
and tell him about the matter.

144
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,860
To some hundred of it,

145
00:07:58,180 --> 00:08:00,040
I want to ask what the prince said.

146
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:01,280
If my dad is 거� هنا,

147
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,840
I'll follow Prince Yuan's order.

148
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,080
We won't find the tras Simple lб b ay,

149
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,160
so let's play an interesting game.

150
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,040
Let's play scissors.

151
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,480
Can I play scissors to win the victory?

152
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,340
Hello, Miss Fu.

153
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:18,520
Excuse me,

154
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,080
Sure.

155
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:24,240
Can I leave now?

156
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,400
His Highness said

157
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:29,120
he has some physical problems today.

158
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,040
He doesn't want to see you.

159
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,320
I should go back to Anzhi

160
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:32,920
to take care of him.

161
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,560
General Pei,

162
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,160
this is the Eastern Palace.

163
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,200
Our Lady is the emperor's brother.

164
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,520
You're stopping us.

165
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,000
Do you really mean that?

166
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,400
Please forgive me.

167
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:44,760
I'm sorry.

168
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,160
General Pei said

169
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,520
you don't want to see me.

170
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,880
Of course I do.

171
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,280
General Pei,

172
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,720
this girl is rude.

173
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,760
She will punish you

174
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,160
severely.

175
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,720
I'm sorry.

176
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,720
She has been cold.

177
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:56,320
She's really cold.

178
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,440
My Lady.

179
00:10:05,280 --> 00:10:06,480
Didn't I say

180
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,400
I'm the emperor?

181
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,680
I'm the emperor of the crown prince.

182
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll be the crown prince

183
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,640
in the future.

184
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,360
Elder Seilong.

185
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,520
My Lady Jingacity Fairy.

186
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:45,240
Miss,

187
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,720
it's been a while.

188
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:49,600
General Pei hasn't been here lately.

189
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,840
I just came outside to reach another requests to talk to him.

190
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,460
No.

191
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:56,500
I don't.

192
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:00,380
I don't hate you.

193
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,580
You even call him king of chicken,

194
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,140
am I not a king of chicken?

195
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,280
Miss Taozi,

196
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:25,280
Chang'er is here too.

197
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:26,280
But she can't come in without a seal.

198
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:27,280
Why don't you go out with me

199
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:29,280
and talk to her?

200
00:11:41,280 --> 00:11:43,280
Why are you so pale?

201
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,280
Did something happen?

202
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,280
No.

203
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:50,280
A'Ying.

204
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,280
Your Majesty and the court officials

205
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,280
all think that

206
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,280
General Cui is innocent.

207
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,280
Your Majesty also agreed

208
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,280
to let me marry you as the Crown Princess.

209
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,280
But there is a condition.

210
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,280
Disband the Cui family.

211
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,280
Disband the Cui family?

212
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,280
You can't.

213
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,280
I can't.

214
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:26,280
I can't agree.

215
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,280
Don't worry.

216
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:32,280
The Cui family is a fake.

217
00:12:33,280 --> 00:12:34,280
They won't do anything good.

218
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:38,280
If the court officials

219
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:40,280
think that the Cui family has too many people,

220
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:42,280
they can withdraw the money.

221
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,280
But they can't disband the Cui family.

222
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:47,280
Do you know

223
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,280
that the Cui family

224
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,280
is my father's blood

225
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,280
and my life?

226
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,280
If I have to disband the Cui family,

227
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,280
I won't marry you.

228
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,280
No.

229
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,280
You have to marry me as the Crown Princess.

230
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:14,280
Otherwise, I can't keep you

231
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,280
as your father.

232
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,280
Then why did you

233
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:17,280
come back to me?

234
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,280
If you didn't go to Lan Tang,

235
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:22,280
he would have returned to Ying Zhou.

236
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:23,280
If he had returned to Ying Zhou,

237
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
our father wouldn't have been like this.

238
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:27,280
The Cui family will be hurt

239
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,280
if we let them do anything.

240
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,280
You don't need to say that

241
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,280
to keep our father's life.

242
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,280
Aunt, don't you understand?

243
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,280
Disbanding the Cui family

244
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,280
is a real crime.

245
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,280
I don't want to be a criminal.

246
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't want to be a criminal.

247
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,280
Aunt,

248
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,280
if General Cui really returns to Ying Zhou,

249
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:50,280
the Cui family will only be more worried about him.

250
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,280
By then,

251
00:13:52,280 --> 00:13:54,280
we will have to see each other.

252
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,280
I don't care about the situation.

253
00:13:59,280 --> 00:14:00,280
If we disband the Cui family,

254
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,280
what will the people of Ying Zhou do?

255
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:03,280
What will the Cui family do

256
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:05,280
to the 100,000 soldiers?

257
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:08,280
The Cui family will be worried

258
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,280
about us.

259
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,280
We can't do anything about it.

260
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,280
The court doesn't only have the Cui family to fight.

261
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:37,280
So it is.

262
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,280
We have to break the bridge.

263
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:45,280
Ying,

264
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,280
I said

265
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:50,280
the Cui family will be a criminal.

266
00:14:50,280 --> 00:14:51,280
The army won't do anything good.

267
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,280
The people of Ying Zhou will be worried.

268
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
That's what you said.

269
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,280
But we have to be careful.

270
00:14:55,280 --> 00:14:56,280
We can't do anything about it.

271
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,280
Yes.

272
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,280
I know you want to keep everything.

273
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,280
But there are many things that can't be kept.

274
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,280
I have tried my best

275
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:12,280
to protect you and General Cui.

276
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,280
That's why the court promised

277
00:15:17,280 --> 00:15:18,280
that as long as we disband the Cui family,

278
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,280
you can be the crown princess.

279
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,280
General Cui

280
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:24,280
is my father-in-law.

281
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,280
If we have to disband the Cui family,

282
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:37,280
we have to force father to be so determined.

283
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:46,280
I will not marry you then.

284
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:08,280
Go tell General Cui

285
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,280
what he is going to do.

286
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,280
Disband the Cui family.

287
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:18,280
You are the crown princess.

288
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,280
If you don't do it,

289
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:23,280
you have to disband the Cui family.

290
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,280
Otherwise,

291
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:29,280
General Cui's life

292
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:33,280
will be in danger.

293
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:45,280
General Cui

294
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,280
I know.

295
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,280
General Cui came here personally.

296
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,280
I know.

297
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
I know.

298
00:17:24,280 --> 00:17:25,280
I know.

299
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:27,280
I know.

300
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,280
I know.

301
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I know.

302
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,280
I know.

303
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,280
I know.

304
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,280
I know.

305
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,280
I know.

306
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,280
I know.

307
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,280
I know.

308
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
I know

309
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:49,280
what you want to say.

310
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,280
Father.

311
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,280
I can always think of a way.

312
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,280
Although I have a few words for Li Ni,

313
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:03,280
she will always have

314
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,280
a soft heart.

315
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,280
In a few days,

316
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,280
I will take her to the mansion.

317
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,280
She will be the one.

318
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,280
Our father and daughter

319
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,280
can always think of a way

320
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:17,280
to get out of the capital and leave.

321
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,280
I will leave.

322
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:19,280
No need, Ying.

323
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:23,280
I am just like your mother.

324
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:27,280
I just hope you are fine.

325
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,280
You and her love each other.

326
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:36,280
Why do I have to disband you?

327
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,280
Father.

328
00:18:41,280 --> 00:18:43,280
You are not a daughter.

329
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
General Cui

330
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:48,280
is the blood of our Cui family.

331
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:51,280
When I was young,

332
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,280
you told me often that

333
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,280
our Cui family is in Yingzhou.

334
00:18:58,280 --> 00:19:00,280
We have been in the same boat for many times.

335
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,280
We are in the same boat.

336
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,280
So we have been in the same boat

337
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,280
since we were born.

338
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,280
When we were in the same boat,

339
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:10,280
we established the Cui family.

340
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,280
Our Cui family is called the Emperor of Ding.

341
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:17,280
You brought us many kids

342
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:20,280
and you made them bleed.

343
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:24,280
I died for the sake of the capital.

344
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,280
Cui family

345
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,280
is the king of our family forever.

346
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,280
No, Ying.

347
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:38,280
You are the biggest

348
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,280
chance for me and your mother.

349
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,280
Father.

350
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:51,280
I don't want to marry anyone.

351
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,280
Let's go to the high-class.

352
00:19:54,280 --> 00:19:56,280
Silly girl.

353
00:19:58,280 --> 00:19:59,280
I am old.

354
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,280
Even if I come back to Yingzhou,

355
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,280
I can live a few days of peace.

356
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,280
I used to

357
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,280
have a grudge against my father.

358
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:19,280
He is so cruel.

359
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,280
But look.

360
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Li Ni is a man who is cruel to the emperor.

361
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,280
He is younger than my father.

362
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,280
He is also better than my father.

363
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,280
In his hands,

364
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:42,280
the court must be able to defeat the emperor.

365
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,280
Why do you think

366
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:48,280
I have to be a troublemaker?

367
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:53,280
But father.

368
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,280
I don't want to.

369
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,280
Father.

370
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,280
What are you talking about?

371
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,280
Originally.

372
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,280
Originally.

373
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:18,280
Father wanted to leave Cui family to you.

374
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,280
You want to marry someone.

375
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:26,280
This is the best dowry.

376
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,280
You don't want to marry anyone.

377
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,280
In this life.

378
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:37,280
You can do whatever you want.

379
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:39,280
You can do whatever you want.

380
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,280
Now.

381
00:21:44,280 --> 00:21:46,280
You want to be a crown princess.

382
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:51,280
This dowry is useless.

383
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:53,280
It's out of the ordinary.

384
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,280
He is

385
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,280
the king of the world.

386
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,280
You are the king of the world.

387
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
The King of the World

388
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,280
The King of the World

389
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:34,280
The King of the World

390
00:24:02,280 --> 00:24:04,280
The King of the World

391
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,280
The King of the World

392
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,280
General.

393
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:34,280
The King of the World

394
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:04,280
The King of the World

395
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,280
The King of the World

396
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:04,280
The King of the World

397
00:27:32,280 --> 00:27:34,280
The King of the World

398
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:45,280
Father.

399
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,280
Father.

400
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,280
Father, your hair is burning.

401
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:09,280
Father.

402
00:28:13,280 --> 00:28:15,280
Father, your hair is all white.

403
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,280
Aunt.

404
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,280
Father, please forgive me.

405
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,280
Father, it's useless.

406
00:28:28,280 --> 00:28:30,280
Father, I can't save you.

407
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:34,280
I even can't remember the way home.

408
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,280
You are going to the capital this time.

409
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:42,280
I haven't seen you for the last time.

410
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:46,280
I can't even help you.

411
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:50,280
Come.

412
00:28:51,280 --> 00:28:53,280
Let's stay here.

413
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:54,280
Let's go home.

414
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:56,280
Go home.

415
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,280
No.

416
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,280
Go home.

417
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,280
I want to go to the temple.

418
00:29:05,280 --> 00:29:06,280
I want to go to the temple.

419
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,280
Father.

420
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,280
Father.

421
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:11,280
Father.

422
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,280
Father.

423
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:14,280
Father, where are you going?

424
00:29:15,280 --> 00:29:16,280
Father.

425
00:29:16,280 --> 00:29:17,280
General.

426
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,280
Father.

427
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,280
I can't go home.

428
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:20,280
Where are you going?

429
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:21,280
Father.

430
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:22,280
Let's go home, father.

431
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:25,280
Where is the camp of the General?

432
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:28,280
Why can't I find it?

433
00:29:29,280 --> 00:29:30,280
Father.

434
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Where is the camp?

435
00:29:32,280 --> 00:29:34,280
Where is the camp?

436
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:38,280
Where is the camp?

437
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,280
Where is the camp?

438
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,280
Father.

439
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,280
I love you.

440
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,280
The camp is over.

441
00:30:01,280 --> 00:30:03,280
The camp is over.

442
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,280
Everyone.

443
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,280
The camp is over.

444
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,280
It's the end of the festival.

445
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,280
The ceremony is over.

446
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,280
The ceremony is over.

447
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,280
The new man and the new woman.

448
00:31:02,280 --> 00:31:04,280
The funeral is over.

449
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,280
The funeral is over.

450
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:10,280
The ceremony is over.

451
00:31:25,280 --> 00:31:27,280

452
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,280

The ceremony is over.

456
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:38,280
After the two parties,

457
00:31:38,280 --> 00:31:40,280
I will go to the temple.

458
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,280
The ceremony is over.

459
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:48,280
You have to bow before me.

460
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,280
Where is the alliance?

461
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
The ceremony is over.

462
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,280
The ceremony is over.

464
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,580
Cheers, Sir.

465
00:32:25,280 --> 00:32:27,040
Lord Fan,

466
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,160
you're looking for the reason

467
00:32:29,240 --> 00:32:47,840
that the

468
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,680
Lord Anshun can do nothing

469
00:32:50,680 --> 00:33:00,440
Long longs, longs...

470
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:51,960
Your Highness.

471
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:52,560
My Lady,

472
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,340
I am sorry.

473
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,540
What's wrong?

474
00:34:00,020 --> 00:34:01,200
Damn it.

475
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:12,920
Yinzhen,

476
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:15,200
rest easy.

477
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:16,140
Do you see them

478
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:19,240
paneling his clothes

479
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:31,820
The

480
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,320
third time I promised you to let me go.

481
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,820
This is the first time.

482
00:35:34,820 --> 00:35:36,820
If you have the ability, kill me.

483
00:35:36,820 --> 00:35:38,820
I don't need you to let me go.

484
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,240
The third time I promised you to let me go.

485
00:36:19,240 --> 00:36:22,240
The third time I promised you to let me go.

486
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:51,240
Shh.

487
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:08,240
Your Highness.

488
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
Your Highness, you're not here.

489
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,240
It's time for you to get up.

00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:52,600
to Your Majesty

495
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,000
I am waiting for that

496
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,960
Eight years ago

497
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:59,720
When Xinyan arrived

498
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,880
I wondered what country and place

499
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:03,960
she had inside

500
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,880
She was dead

501
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,040
Freedom

502
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:11,640
The Justice is in me

503
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:15,680
It can't be

504
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:17,700
Divorce Kyung...

505
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,140
This stubborn love,

506
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:21,140
if the people know that I can live with this love for you

507
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,460
they may think it is not for me to do.

508
00:38:23,460 --> 00:38:25,020
ALMFD is wrong.

509
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,920
Everyone knows that

510
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:28,960
His Majesty and Empress Dowager

511
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,900

512
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,140
will not pay for letting him live.

513

514
00:38:34,260 --> 00:38:36,600

You and your club both gather together.

00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:45,260
From today on,

530
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,680
she gave her map with the Eastern Palace

531
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,060
decorated with a TЗEFAU

532
00:39:13,700 --> 00:39:16,360
I'm not begging at such point.

544
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,080
Your Highness, is there anything wrong?

545
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,080
I'll give you a good death.

546
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:14,720
It's obvious that you have something to do.

547
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,920
Why didn't you tell me that you would agree?

548
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,160
Mother is also a kind heart.

549
00:40:20,800 --> 00:40:22,000
You must be thinking too much.

550
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,080
Ying,

551
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,800
don't do this to me, okay?

552
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,600
Your Highness, do you want me to laugh?

553
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:30,120
I can laugh.

554
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:33,920
If you hate me,

555
00:40:34,480 --> 00:40:36,040
you can give me the same as yesterday.

556
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,880
Why should I give you?

557
00:40:37,880 --> 00:40:39,040
I only give you.

558
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:40,840
I can't beat you.

559
00:40:41,960 --> 00:40:43,720
I only wanted to give you three times.

560
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,720
Now I only have two more times.

561
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:48,400
What if you really kill me?

562
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:53,600
My father is like a child now.

563
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,560
He can't go home in time.

564
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,880
I don't know that the Cui family

565
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,800
is gone.

566
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:07,280
I read it every day.

567
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,640
I'll go back to the Cui family to see it.

568
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,840
If I die,

569
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:18,000
my father won't be alive.

570
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:24,200
Your Highness wants to marry me.

571
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:26,320
He has married me now.

572
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:29,080
Your Highness wants me to be the crown princess.

573
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:32,280
I'm already the crown princess now.

574
00:41:35,720 --> 00:41:37,160
If Your Highness still wants to,

575
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:41,400
let me be like the prince of Xin Yue,

576
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,720
the 17th Prince of Xin Yue.

577
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,640
I'm afraid I can't.

578
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,880
Girl.

579
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:10,480
Peach.

580
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,860
Girl, they didn't let me get in.

581
00:42:12,860 --> 00:42:14,200
I've met you again.

582
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:17,760
My screen is so poor.

583
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,680
There was a boat here last night.

584
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,020
rooted character.

585
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:24,420
I've recently had clairement cut to my own sleeves.

586
00:42:24,720 --> 00:42:25,680
Have some sweet soup,

587
00:42:25,940 --> 00:42:27,060
it could be proper.

588
00:42:27,780 --> 00:42:28,760
Yes, Your Highness.

589
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:40,900
Presenting His Majesty's Gu Yan

590
00:42:40,900 --> 00:42:46,020
His Majesty also!

591
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:51,020
His Majesty also certified forさま

592
00:42:51,060 --> 00:42:56,420
If I forget the shooting stars

593
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:02,260
Waiting for memories to fall into the light

594
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
I will be your hero

595
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,260
I will be your hero

596
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:08,260
I will be your hero

597
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:10,260
I will be your hero

598
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,260
I will be your hero

599
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260

600
00:44:14,260 --> 00:44:16,260

601
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:18,260

602
00:44:18,260 --> 00:44:20,260
I will be your hero

603
00:44:20,260 --> 00:44:22,260
I will be your hero

604
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:24,260

605
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260

606
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
I will be your hero

607
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,260
I will be your hero

608
00:44:30,260 --> 00:44:32,260
I will remember

609
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:34,260
The promise I made for you

610
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:38,260
I will support you

611
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:40,260

00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:46,260
I will support you

615
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,260
I will wait for you

616
00:44:48,260 --> 00:44:50,260
to come back

617
00:44:50,260 --> 00:44:52,260
To me
