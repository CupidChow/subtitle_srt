The Long Ballad

00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:42,580
Episode 1

4
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
Dong Dong.

5
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,580
Dong Dong.

6
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:49,580
Father, help me!

7
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,580
Get out of the way!

8
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,580
Father, help me!

9
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,580
Father!

10
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:56,580
Jun'er, get up!

11
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,580
What... what's going on?

12
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:02,580
Qi Huotang killed me!

13
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:03,580
Your Majesty!

14
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:05,580
What?

15
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,580
The Prince of Qin is outside the palace.

16
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,580
Father, did you see that?

17
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,580
He didn't let Jun'er come to see me.

18
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,580
Father, please help me!

19
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,580
Help me!

20
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:16,580
No, no.

21
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,580
Don't let the Prince of Qin come in.

22
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:18,580
Let him kneel before him.

23
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:19,580
He doesn't have my order.

24
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:20,580
Don't get up!

25
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,580
Yes.

26
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:23,580
Thank you, Father.

27
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,580
Thank you, Father.

28
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:37,580
Miss, the rumor that

29
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:39,580
General Pei really stopped the Prince of Qin.

30
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:42,580
But now the Prince of Qin still wants to get into the palace.

31
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:45,580
General Pei is trying to persuade him.

32
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,580
But fortunately,

33
00:02:46,580 --> 00:02:49,580
General Pei has already brought people to the palace.

34
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,580
I think that no matter what,

35
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,580
the Prince of Qin can also stop him.

36
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,580
He can't just take the sword and enter the palace.

37
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:56,580
It seems that this time,

38
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,580
he is really sad.

39
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,580
Miss, how do you know that

40
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,580
if General Pei tells you that,

41
00:03:07,580 --> 00:03:09,580
he will definitely persuade the Prince of Qin.

42
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:14,580
That person is very loyal to the Prince of Qin.

43
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,580
When he is in the capital,

44
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:20,580
he will not worry about his own things.

45
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,580
But Pei Yuan and Zhen Xi's army are in the same boat.

46
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,580
He will definitely worry about it.

47
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,580
As long as I tell him,

48
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,580
if he kills the Prince of Qin,

49
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:34,580
the emperor will definitely take Pei Yuan and Zhen Xi's army to the capital.

50
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:36,580
He will calm down.

51
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,580
Miss, you really are the most sensible person.

52
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:46,580
Now,

53
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,580
even if you know,

54
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:53,580
what can you do?

55
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:04,580
It turns out that you are not a sudden illness,

56
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,580
but a serious poison.

57
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,580
Prince of Qin is trying to poison the Prince of Qin.

58
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,580
He didn't expect that he would be in the house.

59
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,580
Oh my god.

60
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,580
When you fell down,

61
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:18,580
you were right in front of me.

62
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,580
You scared me.

63
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:21,580
Miss, you are so dangerous.

64
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:23,580
Didn't you just put poison in my liver?

65
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,580
You almost ate that poisonous bun.

66
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,580
Yes.

67
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,580
It's almost the same.

68
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:34,580
I might be poisoned by it.

69
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:38,580
Miss, this is too dangerous.

70
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,580
Don't see Prince of Qin again.

71
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,580
As the saying goes,

72
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,580
wealth is in the hands of the world.

73
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,580
How can I not see Prince of Qin again?

74
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,580
Well said.

75
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:53,580
You are indeed my daughter.

76
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:57,580
Father, please sit down.

77
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:04,580
You know everything?

78
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,580
I heard that Prince of Qin

79
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:10,580
took the witness and sent him to Prince of Qin's mansion.

80
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,580
Fortunately, when General Pei went,

81
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:15,580
he saw the palace.

82
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,580
This is where Prince of Qin was led.

83
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:21,580
It's also where he was punished.

84
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,580
The name of the dragon is Prince of Qin who poisoned him.

85
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,580
But His Majesty is partial to Prince of Qin.

86
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,580
Prince of Qin is a man of the world.

87
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:31,580
But he is partial to Prince of Qin.

88
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:33,580
He will protect Prince of Qin.

89
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:37,580
Prince of Qin is very ignorant.

90
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:40,580
Father, you mean...

91
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:45,580
Prince of Qin should be the one who knows the truth.

92
00:05:45,580 --> 00:05:47,580
If I knew it long ago,

93
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,580
I would teach him.

94
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:51,580
I would get the witness and the witness first.

95
00:05:51,580 --> 00:05:54,580
I would go to the palace and kneel in front of His Majesty.

96
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,580
He would say that he wouldn't believe

97
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,580
that Prince of Qin poisoned Prince of Qin

98
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,580
to get the witness.

99
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,580
But he couldn't believe it.

100
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:06,580
I only hope that His Majesty can see the father's will.

101
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,580
To avoid his death,

102
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
he sent the witness to the border to protect his life.

103
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:13,580
He would pursue Prince of Qin without mentioning the witness.

104
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,580
His Majesty will be very content.

105
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:18,580
The officials of the Manchukuo Empire,

106
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:20,580
I and Pei Xian,

107
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,580
including General Cui of the border,

108
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
will naturally help him.

109
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:27,580
They will surely kill Prince of Qin.

110
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:31,580
Prince of Qin will not do this.

111
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:32,580
Yes.

112
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,580
With this good plan,

113
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:36,580
he can beat the Great God of the Sky.

114
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:39,580
He can even defeat Prince of Qin.

115
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,580
But he is just a handsome man.

116
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,580
He is now a general.

117
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,580
What do you plan to do now?

118
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,580
We will be ministers.

119
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,580
Prince of Qin is being destroyed.

120
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:57,580
He can't be killed by the enemy.

121
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:02,580
Prince of Qin is very fond of his mother.

122
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,580
He is very sad.

123
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:07,580
You are the one who found his mother.

124
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,580
When he sees you,

125
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:11,580
he will be very happy.

126
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:14,580
You must take good care of him.

127
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,580
You must take good care of yourself.

128
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:19,580
Okay.

129
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,580
I understand.

130
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,580
My mother has prepared the skin care.

131
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,580
I will go to Prince of Qin's mansion later.

132
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,580
I didn't expect that

133
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:33,580
my brother is still not lucky enough.

134
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,580
He is just a single mother of Prince of Qin.

135
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,580
Your Highness,

136
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:43,580
our plan has already become half.

137
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:47,580
I have to go to advise

138
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,580
my brother who is not sure about his soul.

139
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:53,580
Let him work harder.

140
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
Miss Gu,

141
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:03,580
Prince of Qin is not in the mansion.

142
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,580
His Highness has gone to the palace.

143
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,580
He hasn't come back yet.

144
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,580
It's okay.

145
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:11,580
I am here to pick up my mother.

146
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,580
Your Highness,

147
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,580
since you are not in the palace,

148
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,580
let's go back to the mansion.

149
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:15,580
It's been a day.

150
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,580
Who taught you

151
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,580
the call in Prince of Qin's mansion?

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:25,580
I thought about it myself.

153
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Miss Cui taught me this.

154
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,580
She said that only by saying this

155
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,580
can she stop you.

156
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,580
And she said that

157
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,580
she is not afraid of being in the mansion.

158
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,580
She said that she can stop you.

159
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,580
And I asked her

160
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,580
why she didn't tell you.

161
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,580
She said that you don't want to see her.

162
00:08:45,580 --> 00:08:46,580
And she said that

163
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,580
you are not sure about it.

164
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:49,580
So I have to say it.

165
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:53,580
Shi Qi Lang,

166
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,580
at first,

167
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,580
I was very impressed by Miss Cui.

168
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,580
But after the day-to-day break,

169
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,580
I found that she really has a way of life.

170
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,580
She is thoughtful and

171
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,580
she always plans for you.

172
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,580
The most difficult thing is

173
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:06,580
that she doesn't pay the money to the palace.

174
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,580
Shi Qi Lang,

175
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,580
you two are in love.

176
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:11,580
It's a good match.

177
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,580
What?

178
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:18,580
You mean

179
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,580
to let the king go?

180
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:22,580
Right?

181
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:24,580
Your Majesty,

182
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,580
that's what I mean.

183
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,580
That's my son.

184
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:37,580
Even if

185
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,580
the so-called witness is true,

186
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,580
the king of Xin

187
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
is going to poison the king of Qin.

188
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
But Li Ni is not dead.

189
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,580
Why should the king of Xin

190
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,580
take the king's life?

191
00:09:48,580 --> 00:09:49,580
And he is going to let it go?

192
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,580
Your Majesty,

193
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:52,580
the king of Qin is also your son.

194
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:54,580
Besides, the king of Qin

195
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,580
has taken two golds and

196
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,580
is in the palace to design.

197
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:58,580
And what about the king of Xin?

198
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,580
He killed the queen of Xin.

199
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,580
This is a court-court-based investigation.

200
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:03,580
But it hasn't been carried out.

201
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:05,580
It was just released by the government.

202
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,580
So he wanted to murder the chief.

203
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,580
The most vicious person

204
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:11,580
who killed the people.

205
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,580
Your Majesty,

206
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,580
do you still insist on

207
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:15,580
using the national law

208
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:17,580
to defend him?

209
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,580
Gu Qing,

210
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,580
it's not that serious.

211
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,580
It's not that serious.

212
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,580
It's just that

213
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:24,580
they are just making a scene.

214
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,580
Look,

215
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,580
the king of Qin

216
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,580
also used the sword

217
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
to kill the king of Xin?

218
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:30,580
Besides,

219
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:32,580
he is also out of the palace.

220
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,580
Why can't he let go of his brother?

221
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,580
That's his brother.

222
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
Your Majesty.

223
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:46,580
Your Majesty,

224
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:48,580
why are you so generous?

225
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,580
Your Majesty,

226
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,580
the king of Qin

227
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:52,580
has taken two golds and

228
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:54,580
is in the palace to design.

229
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,580
But today,

230
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:56,580
the one who killed him

231
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:59,580
is in the palace to defend him.

232
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:00,580
Will anyone

233
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:01,580
in the future

234
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:02,580
be able to

235
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:04,580
kill the official?

236
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,580
In the army of Zhenxi,

237
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,580
the people are all in the same place.

238
00:11:09,580 --> 00:11:10,580
They are all in the same place.

239
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,580
They are all in the same place.

240
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,580
This is the fate of the army of Zhenxi.

241
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,580
Your Majesty,

242
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
the royal law of the dead

243
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:20,580
is a lie.

244
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,580
I will lead the army of Zhenxi

245
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,580
to avenge the king of Qin

246
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:27,580
and keep the king of Qin alive.

247
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,580
Your Majesty,

248
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:29,580
if you don't want to

249
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,580
let the king of Qin

250
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:31,580
rule the country,

251
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,580
I

252
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:35,580
will have to lead the imperial court

253
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,580
to give the order to the imperial court.

254
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,580
Gu Qing, Pei Qing,

255
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,580
why are you doing this?

256
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,580
Why are you doing this?

257
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:45,580
Can't you

258
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,580
let the king of Qin

259
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,580
live in the imperial court?

260
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
Your Majesty,

261
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,580
the king of Qin

262
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:52,580
is the one who killed the royal family

263
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:53,580
and the chief of the family.

264
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,580
He has committed

265
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,580
a grave crime.

266
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,580
Now,

267
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,580
the king of Xueju

268
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,580
has decided to let him live.

269
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:00,580
He has already let him live.

270
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,580
My Jun'er.

271
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,580
How can you bear

272
00:12:11,580 --> 00:12:13,580
the suffering of Liu Fang?

273
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,580
I will leave.

274
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:19,580
Please wait,

275
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,580
please wait.

276
00:12:20,580 --> 00:12:21,580
Please wait.

277
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Liu Fang is fine.

278
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:29,580
But,

279
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,580
how far is Liu Fang?

280
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,580
According to my imperial law,

281
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:35,580
the king of Xueju

282
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,580
has left 3000 miles

283
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
to the north of the capital,

284
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:40,580
the place of the age.

285
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,580
Can't you be closer?

286
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,580
What?

287
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:52,580
It's the day after the emperor's death.

288
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,580
Can you let the king of Xin

289
00:12:54,580 --> 00:12:55,580
go with me

290
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,580
to worship his mother?

291
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,580
If I let the king of Qin

292
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:00,580
go,

293
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,580
can you let the king of Xin

294
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,580
be his servant

295
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,580
and apologize to him?

296
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,580
Is that okay?

297
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,580
Can you

298
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,580
leave 1000 miles

299
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,580
to Qiongzhou?

300
00:13:13,580 --> 00:13:14,580
Is that okay?

301
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,580
Your Majesty,

302
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:17,580
the queen of Dong

303
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:19,580
is not the birth mother of the king of Qin.

304
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,580
The birth mother of the king of Qin

305
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:22,580
is Consort Liu.

306
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,580
When she was chasing after the birth mother,

307
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,580
she has already wronged the king of Qin.

308
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:26,580
Now,

309
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,580
she is going to the temple again.

310
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,580
I'm afraid it's not right.

311
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:31,580
At that time,

312
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:32,580
I should also

313
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
chase after the king of Liu.

314
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,580
I shouldn't

315
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,580
be so angry at that moment.

316
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,580
How about this?

317
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,580
At that time,

318
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,580
I will first send the queen of Dong

319
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,580
and then send Consort Liu to death.

320
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,580
I will call the king of Xin

321
00:13:46,580 --> 00:13:47,580
before Consort Liu's

322
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:49,580
death

323
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:50,580
to apologize to the king of Qin.

324
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:53,580
Is that okay?

325
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,580
If the king of Xin

326
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,580
can apologize

327
00:13:57,580 --> 00:13:59,580
before Consort Liu's death,

328
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:00,580
then

329
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
the queen of Liu will go to Qiongzhou

330
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
for 1000 miles.

331
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
This is also

332
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:06,580
the heart of the emperor's love.

333
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,580
But this is the law.

334
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:09,580
We can't cut it off.

335
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,580
I understand

336
00:14:16,580 --> 00:14:18,580
the meaning of the two love.

337
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:21,580
I know.

338
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:24,580
I know

339
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,580
that I can't

340
00:14:30,580 --> 00:14:31,580
ever

341
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,580
protect her again.

342
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,580
I understand.

343
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,580
Miss,

344
00:14:43,580 --> 00:14:44,580
the general's letter said

345
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:45,580
that the king of Jieshuo

346
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,580
sent a group of people

347
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,580
to follow Liu Chengfeng

348
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:48,580
to the middle of the land.

349
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,580
Then the general continued to search.

350
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:51,580
He found that the group of people

351
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:52,580
disappeared

352
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,580
after they entered the area near Jizhou.

353
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,580
I think they were hiding.

354
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,580
Where is the commander-in-chief?

355
00:14:56,580 --> 00:14:57,580
He's not far from Jinzhou.

356
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,580
We will take a group of people

357
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,580
to the north to win the commander-in-chief.

358
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:02,580
We will secretly kill them.

359
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:03,580
Okay.

360
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,580
Father.

361
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:05,580
Father.

362
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,580
I was wronged.

363
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,580
I was still abandoned by Liu.

364
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:11,580
I was killed.

365
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,580
Father.

366
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:15,580
Jin'er.

367
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,580
I and Prime Minister

368
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,580
have discussed for a long time.

369
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,580
He's in the same place.

370
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:23,580
From Liu Fang's 3000 miles,

371
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:26,580
he took Liu Fang's 1000 miles.

372
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
The place in Qiongzhou

373
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,580
is also good.

374
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,580
It's to prevent the war.

375
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:37,580
Can't we not leave Liu Fang?

376
00:15:38,580 --> 00:15:39,580
I...

377
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:41,580
I can't bear to leave you.

378
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:43,580
I'll go there.

379
00:15:45,580 --> 00:15:48,580
I can't come back to Jianing again.

380
00:15:49,580 --> 00:15:50,580
Jin'er.

381
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,580
Mother.

382
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:56,580
Mother.

383
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:02,580
Father.

384
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,580
Jin'er.

385
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:05,580
I can't bear to leave you.

386
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:07,580
I have no other choice.

387
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:12,180
I'm going to kill the whole imperial clan

388
00:16:13,580 --> 00:16:15,580
I can't.

389
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
I can't.

390
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,580
I can't.

391
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,580
I can't.

392
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,580
I can't.

393
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,580
I can't.

394
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:30,960
Imperial Guard Aqua Question

395
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,720
You were so ».

396
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,600
She who she does routing

397
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,300
I do both

398
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:34,680
Yes

399
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,480
Father

400
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,840
I beg you

401
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,420
Come.

402
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,780
What are you looking for?

403
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,460
The carriage can't even get in.

404
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,580
It's not good to ride a horse.

405
00:17:10,620 --> 00:17:11,780
Your Highness is planning

406
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:13,340
to take the throne.

407
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,220
How can you not

408
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,740
take the throne secretly?

409
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,300
Liu Chengfeng!

410
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,020
What are you talking about?

411
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,780
The one who bought the throne

412
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:25,220
and tried to take the throne

413
00:17:25,220 --> 00:17:26,620
was my brother.

414
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:28,620
I'm not a man of the word.

415
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:30,340
As long as my two brothers die,

416
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,660
the throne will be mine.

417
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,140
Yes.

418
00:17:34,260 --> 00:17:36,180
Your Highness just wants to make up for it.

419
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,060
It's a big deal.

420
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:39,820
But don't worry.

421
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,940
We will make you

422
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,100
realize your dream.

423
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,300
After all, we don't want to

424
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:46,500
let you

425
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,660
live.

426
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,860
Help me tell the Oulong.

427
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,580
As long as you can help me succeed,

428
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:59,780
I will make all the arrangements

429
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,340
for the throne

430
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,540
of the Crown Prince

431
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,620
in the north of Yan and Zhuo.

432
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,460
Mr. Shiqing.

433
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,300
As I said,

434
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,460
you will be the empress and my mother

435
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,340
if you lose your memory.

436
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:21,060
You will be punished

437
00:18:21,260 --> 00:18:22,700
by my mother.

438
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,140
Don't worry.

439
00:18:24,820 --> 00:18:25,780
I won't cause trouble.

440
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:27,540
Mr. Shiqing.

441
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,100
The Prince of Xie will be released soon.

442
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,940
This is the most important place.

443
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:37,940
Today is my grandmother's illness.

444
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:41,260
I will tell the old men

445
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:44,180
to pretend that I'm still in the army.

446
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:45,500
When the city is out,

447
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,940
I will send my grandmother to the hospital

448
00:18:48,100 --> 00:18:49,020
and then go to the capital.

449
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,300
That's not a big deal.

450
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:52,300
If others know about it...

451
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:53,700
I will make the carriage in the city.

452
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,260
I will be in the carriage.

453
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,820
Who will know?

454
00:18:58,020 --> 00:18:58,500
All right.

455
00:18:58,900 --> 00:18:59,460
Go back.

456
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:00,900
Don't make your father worry.

457
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,100
Yes.

458
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,340
Brothers.

459
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:09,580
Take care.

460
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:10,460
Take care.

461
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:10,860
OK.

462
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,300
The path isRecavation

464

Enough.

465
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,660
One Spirit breaking

466
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:36,780
will kill both heroes.

467
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,220
In the charge of morale

468
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:40,900
he will see me.

469
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,340
lanternливо.

470
00:19:50,380 --> 00:19:52,400
Era I took

471
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,480
the black céu

472
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:56,260
a pretty ghost

473
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,660
is over there

474
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:01,160

Help!

482
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:36,180
My looking should have been more advanced than usual.

483
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,820
Why didn't you tell me not to tell me?

484
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:39,860
Send her to the site!

485
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:57,580
The Coronavirus is all that's reasons.

486
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,900
Tell dön-senbe to get Ta-taikun out of Hujia.

487
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:00,740
I'll hide them.

488
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,620
Go back toNice County.

489
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:02,660
Too dark!

490
00:23:39,240 --> 00:23:40,920
Thus, all of you come to see them.

491
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,360
Of course I don't bother to see you.

492
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
You absolutely aren't gonna be so assertive

493
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,960
even before I find you back in the back.

494
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:54,920
I was only thinking about the long distance to motorspr sucks.

495
00:23:55,680 --> 00:23:57,560
It's not like you can get through this side.

496
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:05,600
The sentry-cube.

497
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,800
It's about time.

00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:10,720
You're afraid of my father.

00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:12,600
Yes.

502
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:18,920
My father.

503
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,640
Who are you?

504
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,680
How dare you leave me here alone?

I'll take care of it.

527
00:26:14,180 --> 00:26:16,380
Who told me to live in the Emperor's House?

528

These...

529
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,460
These assassins are all you've found.

Are you going to rebel?

538
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,180
The new emperor is going to rebel.

539
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:43,180
Protect the emperor!

540
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:44,940

Your Majesty, take it.

You are vlogging.

I want to die.

571
00:29:35,260 --> 00:29:37,260
