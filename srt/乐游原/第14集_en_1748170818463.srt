It's very well-n ثediged.

16
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:16,340
I wonder, what is the cause of Cang's risk?

17
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,680
Just put it that way, The Catholic Holyory is cursed.

18
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,300
It was passed away long ago

I am hoping that the M福

21
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:39,840
I don't mean that.

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,640
Since the time of the Zhengguo Palace in Luoyang,

23
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,160
he has been very strict

24
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,800
with the imperial court.

25
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:47,840
To be honest,

26
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,520
if it weren't for the arrangement of the 17th Lang,

27
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,640
I wouldn't have met him.

28
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,520
Father,

29
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,960
Sir, look at the cloth.

30
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,200
Sir, look at our cloth.

31
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Sir,

32
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:05,520
are you using it

33
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:07,160
or buying it for the family?

34
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:07,880
Sir.

35
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,040
I'll go and have a look.

36
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:10,320
Sir,

37
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,120
you can see our cloth.

38
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,040
It's a good cloth for the family.

39
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,120
I'll go and have a look.

40
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,560
The palace is a military city.

41
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,040
As long as the old and new members of the royal family

42
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,000
of the city are in the state court,

43
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,480
they can live in peace.

44
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,720
The army will be in the city.

45
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:24,320
No one will be in the city.

46
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:25,800
I'm afraid that the army will be in the city

47
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,720
and it will be in chaos.

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,000
So it's important to be vigilant.

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:28,880
There are many ways to go.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,480
There is also a city council in the city.

51
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,440
Otherwise, the people will be close to the city.

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,680
It must be a people's county.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,960
This is

54
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:37,240
a way to be in the city.

55
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,840
The storage,

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,160
the oil room, the water well,

57
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:40,920
the kitchen,

58
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,040
and many other things

59
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:43,320
are in the room.

60
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:44,440
The people of the city

61
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:45,720
have their own guards.

62
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,680
When we arrive,

63
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,760
we will protect the state first.

64
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,720
Thank you, Prime Minister.

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,480
It seems that

66
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,520
you are still in the city.

67
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,480
You have a chance to break the city.

68
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,520
I have something to say.

69
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,960
This is a secret.

70
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,000
If you know more,

71
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,080
you will be in danger.

72
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,760
You don't have to tell me.

73
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:08,840
By then,

74
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:10,920
I will follow the order of the 17th Lang.

75
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,640
I will complete what he told me to do.

76
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,640
If you don't buy the materials,

77
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,000
you will be punished by other rules.

78
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:17,760
Am I right?

79
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:20,480
Move aside.

80
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:30,240
Where are the people?

81
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,680
This sword is still in the body.

82
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:33,440
Father.

83
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,360
What are you doing?

84
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,280
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

85
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:36,880
I'm sorry.

86
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,080
I just let this stupid person

87
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,840
break in without any investigation.

88
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,840
Let's go.

89
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,680
Today,

90
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,040
we can meet each other in the hometown.

91
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:51,600
It's a good day.

92
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,040
I should thank you for your memory.

93
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,760
I don't need to

94
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,200
thank you for the 17th Lang.

95
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,800
It's a good day.

96
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
Young lady, come here.

97
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:01,840
Do you remember

98
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,040
we had a tea party

99
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
with Xia Yincha in the room?

100
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:07,240
Of course, I do.

101
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:09,560
I was able to recover the scene this time.

102
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:11,040
I was able to kill Sun Jing.

103
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:12,720
When we were in the hall,

104
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,560
we ate the horse in the park together.

105
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,600
I was afraid that

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,640
Royal Descendant of Royal Descendant

107
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:19,760
would be busy with the affairs.

108
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,840
I forgot

109
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,320
that I had a date with the amusement park.

110
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,520
No way.

111
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,600
I won't forget you

112
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:26,560
no matter how busy I am.

113
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,720
I won't forget

114
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,360
the date with your amusement park.

115
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,920
Where are your sons?

116
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:40,200
Your Highness, they're so old.

117
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,560
Where are your sons?

118
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,080
Where are your sons?

119
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,080
Come on.

120
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:07,840
Pick wallet.

121
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:08,720
Fake wallet.

122
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:13,920
What is that?

123
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,800
Duggies like you

124
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,680
would go against using that for någ the army.

125
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,160
Wait a minute.

126
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,000
Who taught you?

127
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,120
There are some bad thoughts in the news.

128
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,720
The tea from Trinket,

129
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,320
MBACon Richard Enougher,

130
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,080
has failed to get it right.

131
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,040
Right.

132
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,160
will protect the King of Liang

133
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:39,520
secretly,

134
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,280
then revive hisnap

135
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,120
and cultivate surface for족 Medien.

136
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:48,480
This tricks

137
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,920
are very powerful.

138
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:53,680
I don't know if

139
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,820
we will lose our cell

140
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:57,120
from the successful Henry Naos.

141
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:00,920
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

142
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,480
What?

143
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:06,580
I don't need to Ask asking of strangers.

144
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,380
They all killed their dead people!!!

145
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:22,600
But I've seen many, many merchants

146
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,260
waiting for your hand.

147
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,140
They reckon with them

148
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:28,880
Ookava vs Xichen

149
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
Of course, we want to disturb the people's minds.

150
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,080
Why must we be so close to them?

151
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,080
After all, you're a great emperor.

152
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:38,680
Once you're closed,

153
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,680
the people will be in chaos.

154
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,280
We'll be out of the war.

155
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,680
The capital is in a good mood.

156
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,480
But,

157
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,080
the people from the capital are going to investigate the Yan family.

158
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,080
We must search the city thoroughly.

159
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:57,080
We must catch those spies who spread the news.

160
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,680
Send them to Luoyang.

161
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,880
And kill that prince.

162
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,280
The prince is so small.

163
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,680
If I'm really scared to death,

164
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,880
it'll be a great effect.

165
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,480
Yes.

166
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:45,400
Yanб everlasting

167
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,680
It's forbidden.

168
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,880
For real?

169
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,760
It's not appropriate for prince Lin and Prince Kuai Ji

170
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,880
to kill Prince Liang at this moment.

171
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:55,600
Why?

172
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,040
I thought they were going to take father back

173
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,440
to give him the gold.

174
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,480
It's just a rumor.

175
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,400
But I didn't expect that

176
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,360
they were trying to force father

177
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,480
to be in Luoyang

178
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,920
and to take over the world.

179
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,640
It's so stupid.

180
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,800
Shi Qi Lang.

181
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,080
The situation is bad.

182
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:17,240
Sun Jing's soldiers

183
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,400
are searching for the missing people.

184
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:20,600
And

185
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,760
when I came back,

186
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,560
I heard the chief of the Li Sect

187
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,680
and the chief of the Dianpu Sect

188
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:26,240
were going to check the box.

189
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,280
It's not good to have the Dianpu Sect.

190
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
It seems that

191
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,160
we can't live here for long.

192
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,160
Although we didn't find the box,

193
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,360
we didn't find it.

194
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,280
But the Western Cemetery

195
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,160
is in the right place.

196
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,600
As long as we use our heart,

197
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,880
we can see

198
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,040
the box is meaningful.

199
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:47,560
It's not good.

200
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:48,880
I got the news

201
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:49,760
that the army of Jin Army

202
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:50,960
surrounded the Gu's Mansion.

203
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,560
I dare not follow too closely.

204
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,080
Sir.

205
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,600
Sir.

206
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,440
The herbs that General Pei gave us

207
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,320
are very useful.

208
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,360
From the賣,

209
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,080
your business has been set up for 7 or 8 minutes.

210
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,600
When the Prime Minister comes back,

211
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,840
we can

212
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,280
meet with the army.

213
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:09,800
Sir.

214
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:11,840
What's the matter?

215
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
The news from Luoyang City.

216
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,680
The Li's Army and the Gu's Mansion

217
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,760
are coming to the capital to get the goods.

218
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:19,760
What?

219
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:21,560
You two are so bad.

220
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,160
We really got excited.

221
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,520
Tao Zi.

222
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,560
I specially followed Xiao Wei

223
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:26,640
before we left.

224
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,760
He must have left the goods

225
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,800
on the way.

226
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,360
Tell him to leave the city right now.

227
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,560
I'm afraid Sun Jing

228
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,600
will regret it.

229
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,480
If we close the city,

230
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,400
I'm afraid Xiao Wei will be in danger.

231
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,160
Yes.

232
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,080
I'll leave the city right now.

233
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:40,840
Uncle.

234
00:10:41,080 --> 00:10:42,520
Go and contact our army.

235
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,440
Tell them to leave the city right now.

236
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:45,880
If Xiao Wei can't leave the city,

237
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,000
I'll try my best

238
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,920
to save him.

239
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:48,920
Yes.

240
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:55,400
Let me go.

241
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,400
Let me go.

242
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,160
Let me go.

243
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:58,240
Let me go.

244
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:58,880
Let me go.

245
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,520
Let me go.

246
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,480
Let me go.

247
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,080
Let me go.

248
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,360
Let me go.

249
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,000
Let me go.

250
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,280
Let me go.

251
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
I'm a good man.

252
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,960
Let me go.

253
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,640
I didn't expect you two brothers

254
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:16,920
to be so upset.

255
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,320
There's no room for worry.

256
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:24,740
Good day, Miss Gu.

257
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,400
17th bastard,

258
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,280
I'm here.

259
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:29,960
Please sit.

260
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,680
What can I do

261
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,280
when watch you deliver a Nobody boots here?

262
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,120
وں many people

263
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:36,840
said I was sent for jobs

264
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:37,680
by the army

265
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:39,440
once I started to walk.

266
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,440
Although I don't want to,

267
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,040
I am so afraid of murdering my family

268
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,840
and being arrested in the game.

269
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
One night

270
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,600
I picked up the ball

271
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,880
and reported to You.

272
00:11:50,600 --> 00:12:03,940
тел

273
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,140
I'm afraid that if we go too far,

274
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:07,020
Sun will not kill her easily.

275
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,140
Miss Gu,

276
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,500
don't worry too much.

277
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:12,700
You should leave now.

278
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,180
I saw a lot of soldiers on the way.

279
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,180
If...

280
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,740
If I find out that Royal Descendant is in trouble,

281
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:22,140
we will be in trouble.

282
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,660
If Royal Descendant needs it,

283
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:25,140
we can avoid it.

284
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:26,220
Don't worry.

285
00:12:26,540 --> 00:12:27,980
We have our own arrangement.

286
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,340
Miss Gu,

287
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,700
don't come out today.

288
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,140
Erduo,

289
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,300
send Miss Gu back.

290
00:12:34,460 --> 00:12:35,060
Yes.

291
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:36,700
Miss Gu, please.

292
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:48,700
Search for me.

293
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:50,420
I can't let go of the Tiger.

294
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:51,220
Take it.

295
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:51,780
Hurry up.

296
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,260
Take it.

297
00:12:53,260 --> 00:12:53,660
You know it.

298
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,460
You know it.

299
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:54,980
Your Majesty.

300
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,660
It's all yours.

301
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,140
How about it?

302
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:56,980
It's in the closet.

303
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,020
I saw it at the entrance here.

304
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,740
No.

305
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:07,580
They looked into each other so early.

306
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:09,180
Bgers and Lao Bao also need a call on the searchline.

307
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,220
Can they shoot them off?

308
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,100
They might!

309
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,420
Also,

310
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,300
they will help those soldiers.

311
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,500
I will come here to meet them later.

312
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,180
Your Majesty,

313
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,300
what could I do

314
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,100
with you when you are still working?

315
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,980
사랑22 lawsuit

316
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,060
My Lady

317
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,600
Guau Yu你的室

318
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,620
Have more water.

319
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:29,540
Water!

320
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:31,540
I dare to take your grandpa's clothes off.

321
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,540
Look at my big beard.

322
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,540
I won't kill you.

323
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:35,540
Everyone, don't say anything.

324
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,540
Yes.

325
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,540
This way.

326
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,540
This way.

327
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,540
Today, let you see my great grandpa.

328
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,540
Guo Ge, get out of the way.

329
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,540
Get out of the way.

330
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
Guo Ge, get out of the way.

331
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,540
Get out of the way.

332
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,540
Get out of the way.

333
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:08,540
Get out of the way.

334
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:09,540
Get out of the way.

335
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,540
Go there.

336
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,540
Go.

337
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:12,540
Go upstairs and look.

338
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
Go.

339
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
Go.

340
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,540
Grandpa.

341
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,540
Guo Ge.

342
00:14:17,540 --> 00:14:19,540
It's Grandpa.

343
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,540
Grandpa.

344
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,540
Your Highness, I've heard from the news.

345
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,540
After the ascension of Prince Liang,

346
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:31,540
he was furious.

347
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,540
He didn't only add a few scams in the capital.

348
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:35,540
He even brought some old ministers.

349
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
He didn't allow them to go out.

350
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
He was afraid that something would happen to Prince Liang.

351
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:44,540
Did he send the letter to General Han?

352
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,540
The message came back

353
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:49,540
saying that there is no news from General Han yet.

354
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,540
However,

355
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,540
I think General Han's close friend

356
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:54,540
has already helped the grandchild.

357
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:55,540
He has escaped temporarily.

358
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,540
It's good that there is no news.

359
00:15:02,540 --> 00:15:03,540
We can't find them.

360
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:05,540
Of course, the others can't find them.

361
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,540
Your Highness, the people in the capital are in a panic.

362
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:14,540
The imperial guards and the imperial guards are in the same place.

363
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,540
I think they will attack the capital anytime.

364
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,540
Now, they are making the people in the capital

365
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:20,540
more careful and careful.

366
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,540
The imperial guards have sent a message

367
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,540
to summon the 100-month army.

368
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,540
If the army is in the same place,

369
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,540
if the army is in the same place,

370
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,540
it will be difficult to guard the country.

371
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:32,540
Li Ni may not be able to win.

372
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:34,540
Then we must...

373
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,540
This is not an important matter.

374
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:37,540
The urgent matter is that

375
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,540
we must find General Han first

376
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:41,540
and ensure that the grandchild is safe.

377
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:44,540
We must think of a way to convey the message to Li Ni.

378
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:48,540
I have an important matter to discuss with him.

379
00:15:57,540 --> 00:16:00,540
If General Han saved me,

380
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:02,540
I would have died again.

381
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,540
Your Highness, don't do that.

382
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,540
This is my plan.

383
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:13,540
The secret of the capital is so close to the throne.

384
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,540
It may be the victory of the soldiers.

385
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,540
The grandchild will die

386
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
and the funeral will be over.

387
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,540
I will not let you go.

388
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:25,540
I will just fight for my life and die.

389
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,540
I will just be sad.

390
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:39,540
The wolf ran away recently.

391
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:40,540
It was very dangerous.

392
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,540
I don't know if after the 17-year-old revolution,

393
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:45,540
there is any change in the capital.

394
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,540
When we

395
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,540
remove the iron flag that was chasing after the back,

396
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,540
we will find out the secret of the capital.

397
00:16:57,540 --> 00:16:58,540
Your Highness,

398
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,540
I just took the fruit to the street to have a look.

399
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:04,540
Every shop has a hotel and a inn.

400
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,540
There are many people in search of it.

401
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
Even if there is a public road,

402
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,540
they will be checked by the details.

403
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,540
Your Highness,

404
00:17:11,540 --> 00:17:14,540
I will live here for a few days.

405
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,540
If you know the truth,

406
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:19,540
I will have a chance to tell you the truth.

407
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,540
If we stay here,

408
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:25,540
I am afraid that Cui Chong will be in trouble.

409
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
It's still dark.

410
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Let's just leave it here.

411
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:34,540
The Taozi Chamber of Commerce has come to say that the investigation is serious.

412
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,540
But we have found the location of the school.

413
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:38,540
The location of the missing school is also safe.

414
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:41,540
But the city is in the kitchen.

415
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,540
The house is still open.

416
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,540
The evidence is clear.

417
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,540
The only thing is that the time is long.

418
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:45,540
The place is exposed.

419
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
But the school is still open.

420
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,540
But the school is still open.

421
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,540
I think the way to get out of the city is better than the way to get out of the city.

422
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:51,540
Can the secret office in the city

423
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,540
be connected to the people in the palace?

424
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,540
Yes.

425
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,540
Then wait a little more.

426
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:56,540
Wait for the school to get out of the city.

427
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:57,540
Yes.

428
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,540
How is our army?

429
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,540
We will arrive at the same place.

430
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,540
Okay.

431
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:04,540
I will go to the north first.

432
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:06,540
Now the royal family and the school are in danger.

433
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:09,540
We urge the army to go to the far side.

434
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:12,540
We want to invite General Pei to put our army in the same place.

435
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,540
Go to the heart.

436
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:15,540
Tell them to prepare well.

437
00:18:17,540 --> 00:18:18,540
Yes.

438
00:18:22,540 --> 00:18:23,540
I think of a way.

439
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:24,540
Even if we are in the capital,

440
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,540
we will not be in contact with the Yang'er God.

441
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,540
What is the way?

442
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,540
Yang'er God's daughter, Yang Qiniang,

443
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:32,540
was named Xu Sanliang's wife.

444
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,540
But I asked Yang Qiniang.

445
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:37,540
Zuo Lin and You She never met this Xu Sanliang.

446
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,540
Qiniang.

447
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Did you go to the countryside

448
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:44,540
when you came back from the city that day?

449
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:45,540
Did you go to your family?

450
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:49,540
If we have a chance to get out of the city,

451
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,540
I'm afraid you will have to go to your family again.

452
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,540
You must avoid Zuo Lin's social discrimination.

453
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:57,540
I went there that day.

454
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
It's not a place to go.

455
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
It's my fiance's family.

456
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,540
His name is Xu Sanliang.

457
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
He is my wife.

458
00:19:03,540 --> 00:19:06,540
But he went to the Ministry of Food.

459
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,540
Otherwise,

460
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:10,540
I can't go to the countryside to get food that day.

461
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,540
I was in a hurry.

462
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
So,

463
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
Yang Qiniang told me

464
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:16,540
that his mother had already prepared

465
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,540
a wedding dress for him.

466
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:19,540
She was waiting for Xu Sanliang to marry him.

467
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
I met Yang Qiniang at a young age.

468
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
I was about the same age.

469
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:26,540
When you become Xu Sanliang's fiance,

470
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:29,540
I will wear a wedding dress and wear a wedding gown.

471
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
At that time,

472
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
everyone thought I was Yang Qiniang.

473
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
I was sitting in the flower sedan chair,

474
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:35,540
walking out of the city in a rush.

475
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
I also had a gift certificate and a book.

476
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:39,540
I won't make trouble in the city.

477
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,540
No.

478
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
If I do that,

479
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,540
not only will Yang Qiniang be in danger,

480
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
but also will delay Miss Yang's recovery.

481
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:50,540
Eunuch, you saved my wife and my daughter's life.

482
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
Why are you saying that?

483
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:54,540
This is a great plan.

484
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:57,540
It's just that you are giving the price for my daughter's name.

485
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Why are you taking risks?

486
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
When Sanliang comes back,

487
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:02,540
I will secretly send my daughter over

488
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,540
and have a party with her.

489
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
I will be a good person to her.

490
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Moreover,

491
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,540
Eunuch once saved our lives.

492
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Only by grace and mercy,

493
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:14,540
I can be at ease.

494
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,540
Thank you for your help.

495
00:20:17,540 --> 00:20:18,540
Senior,

496
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,540
let's go out of the city quickly.

497
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:25,540
In that case,

498
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:27,540
thank you for your help.

499
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,540
Yang Qiniang.

500
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:51,540
This is Junyan.

501
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,540
Today's wedding date.

502
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,540
This is Li Zhengchu's wedding certificate and a book.

503
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:59,540
Xu Zanlang, a Xu family member in the city,

504
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:01,540
is going to marry Yang Qiniang.

505
00:21:01,540 --> 00:21:02,540
Yes.

506
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:03,540
Today's wedding date.

507
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
This is the wedding cake from the He family in the East Street.

508
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:10,540
I will give Junyan some chicken.

509
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:19,540
They all said the cake from the He family is delicious.

510
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:21,540
Then I won't delay your food.

511
00:21:21,540 --> 00:21:22,540
Let's go.

512
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,540
Thank you, Junyan.

513
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:24,540
Let's go.

514
00:21:39,540 --> 00:21:42,540
Although the Royal Descendant took his clothes,

515
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:45,540
he put the wedding dress in his yard.

516
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:48,540
This is a good thing.

517
00:21:48,540 --> 00:21:50,540
Compared to the previous unmarried wedding,

518
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:52,540
he is still much older.

519
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,540
Didn't he get a sudden death?

520
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
Actually,

521
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,540
I like to wear this wedding dress.

522
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,540
Xiao Wei.

523
00:22:02,540 --> 00:22:03,540
Xiao Wei.

524
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
Tao Zi.

525
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,540
Just now,

526
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
a group of people from the Cui family

527
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,540
were separated by the Sun Jing.

528
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
So he hopes that we can go there as soon as possible

529
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:10,540
and go back to Tongguan together.

530
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:14,540
Since that's the case,

531
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,540
let's change to the Cui family.

532
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,540
Does the Royal Descendant want to go back to Tongguan?

533
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,540
Although it's only a hundred miles,

534
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:22,540
but the terrain is complicated at this point.

535
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:23,540
I'll go with you.

536
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
In that case,

537
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,540
the Royal Descendant is worried that

538
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:29,540
I and the Lord will go back to Tongguan.

539
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,540
It's not good for Tongguan.

540
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,540
Of course.

541
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:34,540
You are so cunning.

542
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:36,540
I will have to watch you personally.

543
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,540
Let's go.

544
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
Sir.

545
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Tao Zi sent a message.

546
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
Xiao Wei has left the city.

547
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
Where is Li Ni?

548
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
She is still with Xiao Wei.

549
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,540
She can't go back to Tongguan.

550
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
How is our army doing?

551
00:23:13,540 --> 00:23:14,540
We are in Tongguan.

552
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
It's settled.

553
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
Come and see the letter I wrote.

554
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
It's a secret city.

555
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
But it's a secret city.

556
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
These letters are so magical.

557
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
They are full of notes.

558
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,540
It seems that the Prince has recovered.

559
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
The injury is naturally healed.

560
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
It's fully healed.

561
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,540
In that case,

562
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:43,540
I should teach him the past mistakes.

563
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:47,540
I will never change it.

564
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Cui Lian sent a letter.

565
00:23:58,540 --> 00:24:01,540
He said that he can go back to Tongguan with me.

566
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,540
He will replace me for the army.

567
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:07,540
Cui Lian is Cui Yi's son.

568
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
Cui Yi has been born in Yingzhou.

569
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
He is obviously a great leader.

570
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
He is in the world.

571
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
Now Cui Lian is out of business.

572
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
He is in Tongguan.

573
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,540
There are some feelings

574
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
about him.

575
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:25,540
In the third season of the national dynasty,

576
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
except for the line with my illness,

577
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,540
Cui Yi is the only one.

578
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Since Cui Yi's son died,

579
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:35,540
he has been fighting like a wind.

580
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:37,540
Now, in this situation,

581
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
he won't give up this chance.

582
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:43,540
But even if he is in the world,

583
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
he will see if he has the ability.

584
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
Cui's son, Cui Lian,

585
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:52,540
will not be able to sit down.

586
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,540
Dado,

587
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,540
although Cui Lian knows about this,

588
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:00,540
he is obviously in contact with the Xi army.

589
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Dado needs to prevent it.

590
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:04,540
There is a battle in this.

591
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,540
He is playing tricks on me.

592
00:25:11,540 --> 00:25:12,540
He is still playing tricks.

593
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:15,540
Tell Cui Lian to return to his position.

594
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
Tell him that

595
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
he can send someone to deal with him.

596
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:21,540
But

597
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
we must wait until

598
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:24,540
Tongguan falls into my hands.

599
00:25:25,540 --> 00:25:27,540
Then I will be the general of Yangzhou.

600
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,540
Yes.

601
00:25:34,540 --> 00:25:35,540
Your Highness.

602
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:37,540
General Han.

603
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,540
Is this place still in use?

604
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,540
Huayang Town is quiet.

605
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,540
It's just that

606
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:46,540
the Xi Changjing is not far from here.

607
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:48,540
Will it be dangerous for us to live here?

608
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,540
I'm afraid

609
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,540
no one can imagine

610
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
that we will choose

611
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,540
the close town of Xi Changjing.

612
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
I think

613
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
we will choose

614
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,540
the close town of Xi Changjing.

615
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
It's just that

616
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,540
the light is dark.

617
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,540
Besides,

618
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
I think the Xi army is in trouble.

619
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
It's a long way from here.

620
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
We can

621
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
stay here for a while.

622
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,540
General Han.

623
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
You can say it directly.

624
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
After the royal uncle Liang's arrival,

625
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
will you still

626
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
try to kill us?

627
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
I'm afraid

628
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
you will be more cautious.

629
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,540
Although Prince Liang has arrived,

630
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
the world is in the right place.

631
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,540
Actually, it's you.

632
00:26:40,540 --> 00:26:41,540
You are the only one

633
00:26:41,540 --> 00:26:42,540
who is the Crown Prince.

634
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,540
You know that

635
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
if you can

636
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,540
love him,

637
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,540
you can help him

638
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:51,540
to lead the world.

639
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
Uncle Liang.

640
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
I don't remember

641
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
what he looks like.

642
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
He didn't see the palace often.

643
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,540
Actually, Prince Liang is not enough.

644
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:03,540
Only Prince Liang is capable of doing things.

645
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:06,540
Now Prince Liang is in the throne.

646
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
I'm afraid...

647
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:10,540
Will you be able to do it?

648
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
Your Highness.

649
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,540
Don't be so heartless.

650
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,540
Here you are.

651
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:30,540
Here you are.

652
00:27:31,540 --> 00:27:32,540
Here you are.

653
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,540
Where did you get this?

654
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
Xiao Wei got a nickname.

655
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
It's called Gan Guo.

656
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
Gan Guo?

657
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,540
I heard that this is not good to buy.

658
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
I tried it and it was really good.

659
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:47,540
Xiao Wei knew that I like it,

660
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
so he gave me all of it.

661
00:27:49,540 --> 00:27:50,540
Thank you, sister Taozi.

662
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:52,540
I took this...

663
00:27:52,540 --> 00:27:53,540
Enough.

664
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,540
I took a lot of clothes.

665
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,540
Then I could eat

666
00:27:56,540 --> 00:27:57,540
the crispy and delicious Gan Guo.

667
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
This Gan Guo

668
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:00,540
is really good.

669
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
What do you mean?

670
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
I'm not good enough.

671
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
Isn't Taozi good to everyone?

672
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
Didn't you notice that

673
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
sister Taozi is

674
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
very good to you?

675
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
No.

676
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
Taozi is good to everyone.

677
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Why did he leave?

678
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
What are you doing?

679
00:28:21,540 --> 00:28:22,540
Are you stupid?

680
00:28:22,540 --> 00:28:23,540
You're not going to chase him?

681
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
No.

682
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
Why?

683
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:26,540
If you don't chase him,

684
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:27,540
sister Taozi will poison you.

685
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,540
Hurry up.

686
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,540
Let's go.

687
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,540
Taozi.

688
00:28:33,540 --> 00:28:35,540
I didn't find a way to break the city this time.

689
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:36,540
I was afraid that I would be in trouble.

690
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:38,540
It seems that we have to make another plan.

691
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
Let's see how to take the Western capital.

692
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
When we take the Western capital,

693
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,540
what's your plan?

694
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:53,540
By that time,

695
00:28:53,540 --> 00:28:54,540
I'm sure that I won't be in trouble.

696
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
I'll

697
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:58,540
persuade my father to

698
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,540
return to the court with my grandchild.

699
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
I'll go out of the capital with my grandchild.

700
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
Then I'll go back to the Lan State.

701
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
What about you?

702
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:07,540
Do you go back to Yingzhou?

703
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
Lord Liang has already ascended to the throne.

704
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:13,540
You're the son of the emperor.

705
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:15,540
You won't stay in the capital.

706
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,540
Do you really want to go back to the Lan State?

707
00:29:21,540 --> 00:29:22,540
I like the Lan State.

708
00:29:23,540 --> 00:29:24,540
I don't like the Western capital.

709
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Otherwise,

710
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,540
I wouldn't have found a way to break the city.

711
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
I would have the late emperor

712
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
go to the Lan State with me.

713
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
You were the son of Lord Liang.

714
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,540
You were the son of the most

715
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:38,540
ill-fated person in the royal family.

716
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:40,540
You will naturally come to the capital.

717
00:29:40,540 --> 00:29:42,540
There's nothing different now.

718
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:43,540
My father likes my brother.

719
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:45,540
Let them accompany my father.

720
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
What about you?

721
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:49,540
You haven't answered my question yet.

722
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:51,540
Will you go back to Yingzhou?

723
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:53,540
What?

724
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,540
Royal Descendant is afraid that

725
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:56,540
my son will be like Sun Jing

726
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
who will be in the Western capital

727
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,540
and won't go back to Yingzhou?

728
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,540
When I went to Yingzhou,

729
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:08,540
I had this wish.

730
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
I hoped that I could settle down

731
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,540
and make the world peaceful.

732
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:14,540
So that the people

733
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:16,540
could have a peaceful and good life.

734
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,540
If one day,

735
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,540
I can really settle down in the Western capital,

736
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:22,540
then the world will be peaceful.

737
00:30:23,540 --> 00:30:25,540
Why do we have to fight for the right to be in the war?

738
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:31,540
Yes, yes, yes.

739
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,540
I, Xiao Ren,

740
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,540
hope that you will be a good person

741
00:30:36,540 --> 00:30:37,540
and have a good life.

742
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
What do you want to do

743
00:30:41,540 --> 00:30:42,540
after the world is peaceful?

744
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,540
I...

745
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,540
I...

746
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,540
I haven't thought about it.

747
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,540
The world is so vast and vast.

748
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,540
I have never been to Laolan Pass.

749
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,540
I have never seen

750
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,540
many places.

751
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,540
So,

752
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:00,540
I want to go there to see you.

753
00:31:02,540 --> 00:31:03,540
If you want to travel to the world,

754
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,540
will you come to Laolan Pass?

755
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:11,540
One day,

756
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
I will go to Laolan Pass.

757
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,540
To see the desert seal you mentioned,

758
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,540
and that Laolan Pass.

759
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Okay.

760
00:31:23,540 --> 00:31:24,540
I will keep my word.

761
00:31:36,540 --> 00:31:37,540
Who are you?

762
00:31:37,540 --> 00:31:38,540
Miss Taozi.

763
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:40,540
Don't come over.

764
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:45,540
What's wrong with you?

765
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:47,540
What's wrong with you?

766
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,540
I am making you angry again.

767
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:51,540
But I don't know

768
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:52,540
why I am making you angry.

769
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,540
I don't know.

770
00:31:54,540 --> 00:31:55,540
I don't know. Just think about it.

771
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,540
Did you

772
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:00,540
say something wrong?

773
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,540
I am sorry.

774
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,540
I am not good at speaking.

775
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:09,540
Then tell me.

776
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,540
What did you say wrong?

777
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,540
I...

778
00:32:13,540 --> 00:32:14,540
I...

779
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,540
You are so useless.

780
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,540
Get away from me.

781
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,540
Taozi.

782
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,540
Your Highness.

783
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:38,540
General Han has come to inform you.

784
00:32:38,540 --> 00:32:40,540
He said that the sun is setting.

785
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,540
That's great.

786
00:32:47,540 --> 00:32:49,540
You are really a good person.

787
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,540
Congratulations, Your Highness.

788
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:01,540
You can be at ease for now.

789
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,540
A few days ago,

790
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:06,540
the capital city

791
00:33:07,540 --> 00:33:08,540
deliberately closed the ice horse.

792
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,540
I always thought

793
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:11,540
something was wrong.

794
00:33:11,540 --> 00:33:13,540
It was his uncle who found out that

795
00:33:13,540 --> 00:33:14,540
the sun was setting.

796
00:33:16,540 --> 00:33:17,540
If he wanted to catch a child,

797
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:20,540
he would have caused so many ice horses.

798
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,540
Is it the one who caused the fall of the capital city

799
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,540
or the Yingzhou?

800
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:29,540
I don't know either.

801
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,540
Did any news

802
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,540
from the person who sent Li Ni to you?

803
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:38,540
He said he hadn't seen Li Ni.

804
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:40,540
So he hasn't heard from her for the time being.

805
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:43,540
I'm sorry.

806
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,540
I hope that Doudu

807
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:51,540
is not going to the same place.

808
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,540
Maybe,

809
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
I thought too much about it.

810
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:12,380
Okay.

811
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:16,140
What are you thinking about?

812
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:19,340
I'd an institution for the first time.

813
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
I'd go to the WesternC pelogyCity away from the estate of our mansion.

814
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,500
By then,

815
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:29,140
I was a top of the 소리 ofereg.

816
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:31,020
Over these years,

817
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,700
there were only few sometime in man inhabitated for the royal memorial of the emperor.

818
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,500
After that last preventing edicts from entering the capital,

819
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,180
I'd feel bitterness in Jing,

820
00:34:41,540 --> 00:34:43,420
Compared to the sandstorm,

821
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,900
it's just a small matter.

822
00:34:47,780 --> 00:34:49,420
Why do you suddenly think of saying that?

823
00:34:58,820 --> 00:34:59,540
Look.

824
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,100
The sun is about to fall.

825
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,020
The sun is shining on the palaces of the palace.

826
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,620
And on the yellow sand of the west.

827
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:11,020
It's all red.

828
00:35:11,940 --> 00:35:13,140
What's your name?

829
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:15,980
Don't mention it.

830
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,780
Thank you.

831
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:32,740
Jin.

832
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,060
I've ordered 100,000 soldiers

833
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,500
to wait for the storm

834
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:47,980
in the snow of Canyang.

835
00:35:49,340 --> 00:35:51,100
Although there are thousands of horses,

836
00:35:51,580 --> 00:35:53,180
I'm busy with my work.

837
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,140
I'm also like today's Jijing.

838
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,300
I'm not afraid of anything.

839
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:09,860
As long as I can be with you,

840
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,260
you and me

841
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:16,820
can be friends.

842
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:24,820
Maybe that boy

843
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,380
has already decided

844
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:29,100
he'soe aspirated.

845
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:33,180
Jin.

846
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,260
I don't want to hear anymore.

847
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:40,980
Since time is average,

848
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:45,740
I can go to Mount Li and stay for a few more days.

849
00:36:58,140 --> 00:36:59,140
Okay.

850
00:37:00,740 --> 00:37:01,740
I will go.

851
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,540
What's wrong?

852
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:15,540
What's wrong?

853
00:37:16,540 --> 00:37:17,540
You've been angry for two days.

854
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,540
You don't even pay attention to the fight.

855
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,540
Who is he?

856
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:24,540
Why did you hit him when he was fighting?

857
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:28,540
I didn't think that

858
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:29,540
there would be a army nearby.

859
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,540
It's not appropriate for me.

860
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:31,540
Stop for a while.

861
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,540
Xiao Wei,

862
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,540
the army that was shot down

863
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:45,540
is ahead of us.

864
00:37:59,540 --> 00:38:00,540
Xiao Wei,

865
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:01,540
wait a moment.

866
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:10,540
Be careful.

867
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:13,540
Be careful.

868
00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:21,540
Xiao Wei,

869
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,540
the soldiers that were shot down

870
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:24,540
are now out of the blue.

871
00:38:25,540 --> 00:38:26,540
Why did Cui Jiaxun

872
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:28,540
have Li Youwei and Xi Xi?

873
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:30,540
It's a common habit.

874
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,540
It's a common habit

875
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:34,540
that Xi Xi has been fighting for.

876
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:37,540
Xiao Wei,

877
00:38:37,540 --> 00:38:39,540
we lost so many enemies

878
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:41,540
in the war.

879
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:42,540
Xiao Pei.

880
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
Lu Huan.

881
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,540
Shi Xi Lang,

882
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:01,540
you're so good.

883
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,540
When you entered the camp,

884
00:39:02,540 --> 00:39:03,540
you found something wrong.

885
00:39:03,540 --> 00:39:04,540
You asked me to stay for a while

886
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:05,540
when I was feeding horses.

887
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:06,540
I looked closely.

888
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,540
I found that their provisions were heavy.

889
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,540
They were heavy.

890
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:10,540
They were fine.

891
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:11,540
If it's what Tao Zi said,

892
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,540
Cui Jiaxun

893
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:13,540
was shot down by the army.

894
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,540
There were a few soldiers

895
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:16,540
who were killed.

896
00:39:16,540 --> 00:39:17,540
But their military capacity was high.

897
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:18,540
They were not like the ones

898
00:39:18,540 --> 00:39:19,540
that were attacked by the enemy.

899
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:30,540
Tao Zi,

900
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,540
the master told you

901
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:34,540
that the horse was shot down by the army.

902
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,540
So he asked us to meet him.

903
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:37,540
Yes.

904
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,540
When we first came here,

905
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:40,540
you gave me hot water

906
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:41,540
and asked me to wash the books.

907
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:43,540
But it's not the time to blow up.

908
00:39:43,540 --> 00:39:44,540
Why are you still alive?

909
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:47,540
What do you mean, Xiao Wei?

910
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:51,540
I always think it's wrong.

911
00:39:52,540 --> 00:39:54,540
If the army was shot down,

912
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:55,540
it would be alert everywhere.

913
00:39:56,540 --> 00:39:58,540
Why are you still alive

914
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,540
when it's not blowing up?

915
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:02,540
But this is

916
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,540
the camp of Cui Jiajun.

917
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:06,540
We also saw the commander's commander.

918
00:40:06,540 --> 00:40:07,540
He also said

919
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:08,540
that the army was shot down.

920
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,540
Xiao Wei,

921
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:11,540
what do you think is wrong?

922
00:40:12,540 --> 00:40:13,540
When I entered the camp,

923
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:15,540
I found that their horses were broken.

924
00:40:15,540 --> 00:40:16,540
They were badly damaged.

925
00:40:16,540 --> 00:40:18,540
The soldiers were all dead.

926
00:40:18,540 --> 00:40:20,540
It's like the army was attacked.

927
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,540
If they were shot down,

928
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:23,540
they would have to wait for the camp.

929
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:24,540
Or they would be afraid that

930
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:25,540
the army would come to visit them.

931
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,540
They wouldn't be able to attack the army.

932
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,540
So I asked you to take the horse

933
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:31,540
and have a look.

934
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:34,540
Shi Qi Lang,

935
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:35,540
what should we do now?

936
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:38,540
Ying.

937
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,540
Since you are safe here,

938
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:45,540
I'll go back to Tongguan first.

939
00:40:46,540 --> 00:40:47,540
Let's go together.

940
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:48,540
It's not far from Tongguan.

941
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,540
Since we are all together,

942
00:40:50,540 --> 00:40:51,540
let's go to Tongguan together.

943
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,540
Okay.

944
00:40:56,540 --> 00:40:57,540
Cover them all.

945
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:00,540
Cover them all.

946
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:03,540
Cover them all.

947
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:08,540
It's okay.

948
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:11,540
San.

949
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:15,540
Slow down, San.

950
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:18,540
Cover them all.

951
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,540
Go.

952
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:29,540
Hurry up.

953
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:31,540
Don't forget what I told you.

954
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:33,540
Go.

955
00:41:35,540 --> 00:41:36,540
Miss Cao Zi,

956
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:37,540
I know what I said wrong.

957
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,540
What did you say wrong?

958
00:41:41,540 --> 00:41:42,540
The boss told me

959
00:41:43,540 --> 00:41:44,540
why you are unhappy.

960
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:46,540
It's all my fault.

961
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:47,540
I can't speak.

962
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,540
Actually, I wanted to say

963
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,540
you are kind and kind.

964
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:50,540
You are good to everyone.

965
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,540
I wanted to praise you.

966
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,540
I also know you are good to me.

967
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:54,540
But...

968
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:55,540
I...

969
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,540
I didn't make it clear.

970
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:00,540
Enough.

971
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:01,540
You are so stupid.

972
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
Miss Cao Zi,

973
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,540
I want to say

974
00:42:04,540 --> 00:42:05,540
I know you are good to me.

975
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:06,540
So I want to be nice to you.

976
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:07,540
Okay.

977
00:42:07,540 --> 00:42:08,540
I know.

978
00:42:08,540 --> 00:42:09,540
Really?

979
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:10,540
Are you not angry?

980
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,540
You know you are upset

981
00:42:12,540 --> 00:42:13,540
when you don't care about me.

982
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,540
Then I will see

983
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:16,540
Miss Cao Zi's feelings.

984
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,540
Sun.

985
00:42:27,540 --> 00:42:28,540
Coming.

986
00:42:29,540 --> 00:42:30,540
I think I should raise the ladder.

987
00:42:31,540 --> 00:42:32,540
Second,

988
00:42:32,540 --> 00:42:33,540
you should take the secret of the new emperor.

989
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:34,540
Even if I only have one arm,

990
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:36,540
I can still fight.

991
00:42:36,540 --> 00:42:37,540
You are so stupid.

992
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,540
I am willing to do it.

993
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:41,540
We saved him and Cui Jiaxun.

994
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:42,540
He is going to lock us up like this.

995
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:43,540
It's a dead end.

996
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,540
Even if we die today,

997
00:42:44,540 --> 00:42:45,540
we will be brothers.

998
00:42:45,540 --> 00:42:46,540
I won't let him go

999
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:47,540
if we become a soul.

1000
00:42:47,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Okay.

1001
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:49,540
Put the injured brothers

1002
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:50,540
in the woods.

1003
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,540
Put them on the ground

1004
00:42:51,540 --> 00:42:52,540
and take the soldiers.

1005
00:42:52,540 --> 00:42:53,540
Keep them on the ground.

1006
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,540
Okay.

1007
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:57,540
Follow them.

1008
00:43:01,540 --> 00:43:02,540
How is it?

1009
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,540
There are some enemies ahead.

1010
00:43:03,540 --> 00:43:04,540
They stopped.

1011
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,540
But they are not many.

1012
00:43:05,540 --> 00:43:06,540
I don't know if they are friends.

1013
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
Then go up.

1014
00:43:08,540 --> 00:43:09,540
They are enemies.

1015
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:11,540
We should kill them.

1016
00:43:11,540 --> 00:43:12,540
Okay.

1017
00:43:29,540 --> 00:43:30,540
General Xiao Fei.

1018
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:32,540
We can fight with you today.

1019
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:33,540
We are here.

1020
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,540
Yes.

1021
00:43:35,540 --> 00:43:36,540
Good brothers.

1022
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,540
Brothers.

1023
00:43:43,540 --> 00:43:44,540
Kill.

1024
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:54,540
General Xiao Fei.

1025
00:43:57,540 --> 00:43:58,540
What's going on?

1026
00:43:58,540 --> 00:43:59,540
Are you in the same place?

1027
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:01,540
Why are you so serious?

1028
00:44:01,540 --> 00:44:03,540
You are the only one who came.

1029
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,540
We are so many brothers.

1030
00:44:17,540 --> 00:44:19,540
Kill this Cui family.

1031
00:44:19,540 --> 00:44:20,540
Take the soldiers.

1032
00:44:20,540 --> 00:44:21,540
Yes.

1033
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:22,540
General.

1034
00:44:22,540 --> 00:44:23,540
This is your own people.

1035
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:25,540
Your own people?

1036
00:44:25,540 --> 00:44:27,540
Cui's army sold the comrades.

1037
00:44:27,540 --> 00:44:29,540
They colluded with Sun Jing Li and Li Ying Wan He.

1038
00:44:29,540 --> 00:44:30,540
So many brothers are dead.

1039
00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:32,540
You said he is your own people.

1040
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:34,540
General.

1041
00:44:35,540 --> 00:44:37,540
You can't be fooled by him.

1042
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:40,540
He and Cui's previous comrades

1043
00:44:40,540 --> 00:44:42,540
colluded with Sun Jing Li and Li Ying Wan He.

1044
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:45,540
Cui's army sold the comrades.

1045
00:44:45,540 --> 00:44:47,540
Kill all of our brothers.

1046
00:44:47,540 --> 00:44:49,540
Kill all of them.

1047
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,540
My daughter.

1048
00:44:52,540 --> 00:44:54,540
I will not be with you.

1049
00:45:01,540 --> 00:45:02,540
Ying.

1050
00:45:04,540 --> 00:45:05,540
He Xiao Wei.

1051
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:08,540
You are the one who planned this.

1052
00:45:10,540 --> 00:45:12,540
You insisted on going to the capital with me.

1053
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:15,540
You said you could take Yingzhou as your position.

1054
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:16,540
No.

1055
00:45:16,540 --> 00:45:18,540
I will go to the capital.

1056
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,540
You said Cui's army

1057
00:45:19,540 --> 00:45:21,540
was re-enforced and needed to return to the river.

1058
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:24,540
You knew I was not at ease.

1059
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:26,540
You must have been sent back to the river.

1060
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:28,540
I will go to the river.

1061
00:45:28,540 --> 00:45:29,540
I will escort you to the river.

1062
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,540
But this is the fishing trip.

1063
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:34,540
I will not let you go.

1064
00:45:36,540 --> 00:45:38,540
I said I was not aware of it.

1065
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:40,540
Are you not willing to believe me?

1066
00:45:41,540 --> 00:45:42,540
Shi Qi Lang.

1067
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:43,540
You can't believe him anymore.

1068
00:45:44,540 --> 00:45:45,540
How many times did he lie to you

1069
00:45:45,540 --> 00:45:47,540
from the bridge to now?

1070
00:45:47,540 --> 00:45:48,540
Shi Qi Lang.

1071
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:49,540
He killed you so many times.

1072
00:45:49,540 --> 00:45:50,540
You still believe him?

1073
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:00,540
You are not aware of it?

1074
00:46:02,540 --> 00:46:03,540
You are not aware of it?

1075
00:46:06,540 --> 00:46:08,540
I really like to die so many brothers.

1076
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:12,540
Isn't it what you Cui's army and Sun Jing did?

1077
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,540
You still don't believe me?

1078
00:46:29,540 --> 00:46:30,540
Then I will tell you.

1079
00:46:30,540 --> 00:46:31,540
I don't believe you.

1080
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,540
You are the daughter of your husband.

1081
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,540
Such a big thing.

1082
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,540
He won't let you go to the river.

1083
00:46:44,540 --> 00:46:46,540
I did calculate the situation.

1084
00:46:46,540 --> 00:46:47,540
I did calculate the situation.

1085
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:49,540
But this time,

1086
00:46:49,540 --> 00:46:50,540
I really didn't.

1087
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,540
Besides Tong Guan,

1088
00:46:52,540 --> 00:46:53,540
we saved you and General Cui.

1089
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:57,540
How could you be so sincere to us?

1090
00:46:59,540 --> 00:47:00,540
I don't believe you.

1091
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:02,540
I don't believe you.

1092
00:47:03,540 --> 00:47:05,540
I am the mother of the General Cui.

1093
00:47:06,540 --> 00:47:07,540
I don't believe you.

1094
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:09,540
I don't believe you.

1095
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:11,540
I don't believe you.

1096
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:13,540
I don't believe you.

1097
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:17,540
Stop it!

1098
00:47:28,540 --> 00:47:32,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1099
00:47:34,540 --> 00:47:39,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1100
00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,540
If the half of what you have in your heart

1101
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:53,540
That car is me, the car is me

1102
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:59,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1103
00:48:00,540 --> 00:48:06,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1104
00:48:07,540 --> 00:48:11,540
If the half of what you have in your heart

1105
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:16,540
That car is me, the car is me

1106
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:22,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1107
00:48:23,540 --> 00:48:28,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1108
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:34,540
If the half of what you have in your heart

1109
00:48:35,540 --> 00:48:40,540
That car is me, the car is me

1110
00:48:41,540 --> 00:48:46,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1111
00:48:47,540 --> 00:48:52,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1112
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:58,540
If the half of what you have in your heart

1113
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:04,540
That car is me, the car is me

1114
00:49:05,540 --> 00:49:11,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1115
00:49:12,540 --> 00:49:17,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1116
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:22,540
If the half of what you have in your heart

1117
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:28,540
That car is me, the car is me

1118
00:49:29,540 --> 00:49:35,540
If I forget the six years of the fire

1119
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:41,540
When the memory is broken and the silence

1120
00:49:41,540 --> 00:49:46,540
When the memory is broken and the silence
