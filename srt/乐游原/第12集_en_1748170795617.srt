The wind is blowing in the wind

00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,820
the most fiercely

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:45,140
Theomet vide

18
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:52,520
Come back

19
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,120
Sir

20
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
What's the situation in答半

21
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Father suddenly fell ill.

22
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,000
The cause is nothing. Where is the body?

23
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
The body is the relative of my father.

24
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
He was injured in the journey.

25
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,000
He died after he was sent to the second floor.

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Master, is the master's body poisoned or is he ill?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
There is no mention in his heart.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Please allow me to take a pair of relatives and leave immediately.

29
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Please go to the hospital.

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
It's about father's safety.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
I'll go with you.

32
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,000
No.

33
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
The army is still carrying the burden.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
It's not convenient to go.

35
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You should take the army back to the hospital

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
according to the original plan.

37
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Moreover, your body is not recovered.

38
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's also a emergency.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Your body can't be recovered.

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
A Ying, I've decided.

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
You can take the army with you to the new dimension.

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
No need to fight.

43
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Okay.

44
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,220
Make way for the퇴 nationally.

45
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:40,000
Great!

46
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Keep fighting.

47
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Our power is still in the advertised and limited range.

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I can't be worried.

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
You so stubborn!

50
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Without interest,

51
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,880
you will no longer be able to take over the future.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
And your Founding of Ah政.

53
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,480
Are you with aating my father?

54
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,000
What are you talking about?

55
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Even twenty-five people alone

56
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
should never start an evil program.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,740
You should learn by experience.

58
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Among us three sons in Song brother's study,

59
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Li Jun and Li Lai were disbanded.

60
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,680
They immediately agreed to withdraw.

61
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,800
They also asked me to take good care of you.

62
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,240
As for Li Ni,

63
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,880
he even sent the head of the State of Zheng

64
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,960
and put a letter on it.

65
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,240
No letter.

66
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,340
Kill your father.

67
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:41,080
No need to help acold.

68
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,200
Li Ni------------

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,120
Will run after you as your crown prince, of course.

70
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,940
Prince Liang,

71
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,140
it's a big joy.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:49,420
ρώ

73
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:50,800
If little prince

74
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,000
says anything

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,420
dominated the empire.

76
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,320
The first time he killed me,

77
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:03,140
the first time he killed me!

78
00:04:03,140 --> 00:04:06,540
You hurt me this time.

79
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:08,580
Big brother, you're so wise.

80
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,900
Big brother, you're so wise.

81
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,300
Big brother, you're so wise.

82
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,700
Big brother, you're so wise.

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,620
Big brother, you're so wise.

84
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,820
Big brother, you're so wise.

85
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,900
Big brother, you're so wise.

86
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,300
Bring him here.

87
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:43,780
Let's see what's going on.

88
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,580
Yes.

89
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:05,620
Here, put your arm onomb.

90
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,100
Arrange a charge for Her Holiness

91
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:11,700
to tell statehouse Madam.

92
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:13,940
Yes.

93
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,380
axe axe has advanceduguese spirit low for many years,

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,620
and it has new signals.

95
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:27,980
It's causing so manyером tramples on her.

96
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,860
It's her craftsmanship admonishment.

97
00:05:30,260 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm afraid...

98
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,460
I'm afraid it'll mess things up.

99
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,380
Can you save her?

100
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:45,460
I'm not afraid.

101
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,700
She may go on.

102
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,780
Be quick.

103
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,940
Be quick.

104
00:05:57,940 --> 00:05:58,980
Stop doing that.

105
00:05:58,980 --> 00:06:00,140
The battery will be broken.

106
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,140
Shi Qi Lang.

107
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,500
Shi Qi Lang.

108
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,220
Luoyang reported.

109
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:09,700
As the saying goes,

110
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,020
the soldiers under Prince Lin's watch

111
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,700
are very active.

112
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:13,220
A group of Qing Qi's men

113
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,420
have fallen into the water.

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,420
They don't know what to do.

115
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:16,380
No.

116
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:19,340
A group of Qing Qi's men

117
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:21,140
are not like the ones who left Luoyang

118
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:22,180
and were more like the Fu Sha.

119
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,700
Who do they want to kill?

120
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,820
Retreat.

121
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,060
Retreat.

122
00:06:58,980 --> 00:06:59,820
Retreat.

123
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:29,820
A group of Qing Qi's men.

124
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,020
A group of Qing Qi's men.

125
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,620
What's wrong with you?

126
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,620
Did you kill them all?

127
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:05,420
Cui Lin.

128
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,460
I'm looking for

129
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:10,300
any good shit this time.

130
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:31,120
M- you...

131
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,520
Serves you right...

132
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:06,380
Yue

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,580
Army

134
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,200
Lee

135
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,000
Lim

136
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:17,340
Dr.

137
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,340
Gong Zi

138
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,240
To the forest.

139
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,260
AJ, it's time to die.

140
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:01,220
Alright.

141
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,700
But you can't get us out of here.

142
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,420
We are本当ing all of you.

143
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,580
Retreat!

144
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:07,420
Make it!

145
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:07,700
Leave now!

146
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:08,460
Let's get in,

147
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:09,560
and leave!

148
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:13,580
Alright.

149
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,580
Just go forward to the side!

150
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,980
No one.

151
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:53,980
Come on!

152
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,980
Kill them!

153
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,980
Kill them!

154
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,980
No!

155
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:57,980
The Western Army is coming!

156
00:11:57,980 --> 00:11:58,980
It's Li Ni.

157
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,980
Li Ni is here to save people.

158
00:11:59,980 --> 00:12:00,980
What?

159
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,980
It's Li Ni!

160
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:13,980
My son!

161
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:28,980
Go!

162
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:33,980
Go!

163
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:35,980
Go!

164
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,980
Did I just see

165
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:43,980
Cui Ling and He Shi escape?

166
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,980
The Western Army is not easy to get rid of.

167
00:12:46,980 --> 00:12:48,980
Li Ni is a strong soldier.

168
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:50,980
Although we have some soldiers,

169
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:51,980
we can't tell them

170
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:52,980
if we have too many soldiers.

171
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:54,980
San Lang,

172
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,980
the Qing Mountain is still alive.

173
00:12:55,980 --> 00:12:56,980
We can't kill them.

174
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,980
What's going on?

175
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:11,980
Why did you bring him to us?

176
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,980
Call the doctor.

177
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:13,980
Hurry!

178
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,980
Did you get hurt?

179
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:26,980
This arrow is too deep.

180
00:13:26,980 --> 00:13:27,980
It's a knife-like thing.

181
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,980
If it's full of force,

182
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,980
it might hurt the machine

183
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:31,980
and it might bleed.

184
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,980
The blood can only be pulled out

185
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,980
by the arrow.

186
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:34,980
Cui Ling is old.

187
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,980
He won't be able to dig it.

188
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:37,980
It's okay.

189
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,980
I know the trick.

190
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,980
I'll do it.

191
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:41,980
But this method is very painful.

192
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,980
He can't bear it.

193
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,980
A Ying.

194
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,980
You said you'd dig the whole tribe.

195
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:00,980
I feel a little bit hurt.

196
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:02,980
Can you bear it?

197
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:06,980
If I'm here,

198
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:08,980
I'm sure it won't be a problem.

199
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,980
Wei, where's the blood?

200
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:32,980
Hold on.

201
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:33,980
It'll be fine soon.

202
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:34,980
Hurry up.

203
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,980
Hold on.

204
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,980
It's okay.

205
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:57,980
It's okay.

206
00:14:58,980 --> 00:14:59,980
It's okay.

207
00:14:59,980 --> 00:15:00,980
It's okay.

208
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:02,980
It's okay.

209
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,980
It's okay.

210
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,980
I'll help you.

211
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,980
Come on.

212
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:41,980
The valley is dangerous.

213
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Do you know how many soldiers the enemy has hidden?

214
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,980
Moreover,

215
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,980
the enemy is still very strong.

216
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:48,980
You can retreat with full power.

217
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:50,980
It's the greatest gift from God.

218
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:52,980
Shi Qi Lang,

219
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:54,980
you're not good at threatening.

220
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:01,980
You're a good warrior.

221
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,980
Why did you choose your uncle?

222
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:05,980
You're so stubborn.

223
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,980
You always make a big deal out of it.

224
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,980
We just shared the same opinion.

225
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,980
It's the important moment to persuade the capital.

226
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:17,980
If you make a little mistake,

227
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:19,980
what will we do?

228
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,980
Besides,

229
00:16:22,980 --> 00:16:23,980
that He Shi,

230
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,980
he's from the Cui family.

231
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,980
Why did you save him?

232
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,980
Who said I was saving him

233
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,980
for He Shi?

234
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:30,980
You didn't do it for...

235
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:31,980
I was saving Mr. Cui.

236
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:35,980
Do you think I believe it?

237
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,980
I think you do.

238
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:41,980
Fine.

239
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:45,980
You're right.

240
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:53,980
You're...

241
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:54,980
You're...

242
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,980
Who are you?

243
00:16:57,980 --> 00:16:59,980
Li Ming Ji dares to kill my brother.

244
00:16:59,980 --> 00:17:01,980
How dare he kill my brother?

245
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,980
I'll kill you now.

246
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,980
I'll kill you to kill my brother.

247
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:07,980
Madam.

248
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,980
You dare to kill my brother?

249
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:10,980
I'll kill you now.

250
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,980
Our people have been fighting for a long time.

251
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:18,980
We're not afraid of the enemy.

252
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:20,980
We're afraid of the enemy.

253
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:22,980
Our people are already

254
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:23,980
pulling Madam Wei.

255
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,980
The doctor knows what to say.

256
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:26,980
Don't worry, Your Highness.

257
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,980
The capital is here.

258
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:41,980
Please take the capital.

259
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,980
Lord Liang went into the capital.

260
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,980
The pulse is weak.

261
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,980
Moreover, the ingredients...

262
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,980
The ingredients are caused by the anger of Madam.

263
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,980
The blood pressure is high.

264
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,980
The anger of the heart is high.

265
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,980
The medicine is too high.

266
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:53,980
It's too much.

267
00:17:57,980 --> 00:17:58,980
I...

268
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,980
I'm going to cut his head

269
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
and give it to his son.

270
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,980
Let him have a taste.

271
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:04,980
What is the pain of chasing the heart?

272
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,980
This man died in the play.

273
00:18:15,980 --> 00:18:16,980
I...

274
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:17,980
I believe that

275
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:19,980
he burned the ashes

276
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:20,980
and killed Yang Hui.

277
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,980
He also killed the Duke of Zheng.

278
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,980
No.

279
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,980
I'm going to cut his head

280
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:27,980
and give it to his son.

281
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
You...

282
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:31,980
You hit me.

283
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:34,980
You hit me.

284
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:46,980
What's wrong?

285
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:50,980
Lord Liang is dead.

286
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,980
What?

287
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,980
Bring back the head of Duke Zheng

288
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,980
from your head.

289
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
I'll kill him.

290
00:19:06,980 --> 00:19:07,980
I'll kill him.

291
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:09,980
I'll kill him.

292
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,980
I'll kill him.

293
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:13,980
I'll kill him.

294
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:14,980
Bring it back.

295
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Madam Wei is in a critical state.

296
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,980
She killed Lord Liang.

297
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,980
Then we must seal this news immediately.

298
00:19:23,980 --> 00:19:24,980
We can't let Li Ni

299
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:26,980
know that Lord Liang is dead.

300
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,980
I only know that

301
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,980
Madam Wei is stupid.

302
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:32,980
I didn't expect

303
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,980
that she ruined my grand plan.

304
00:19:37,980 --> 00:19:39,980
Li Ni is a strange person.

305
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:41,980
She is a heartless person.

306
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,980
She is so cunning.

307
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:44,980
Lord Liang is alive.

308
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,980
He may not be able to push it.

309
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:51,980
You don't have to be so anxious.

310
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,980
I just married

311
00:19:57,980 --> 00:19:58,980
and got married.

312
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:00,980
That's why I'm in pain.

313
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:05,980
Even so,

314
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:08,980
even if she makes a mistake,

315
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,980
you never

316
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:12,980
treat her the same way.

317
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:15,980
I'm sure she is a bad wife.

318
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:17,980
After all, she is different from you.

319
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:22,980
Why do you need to be like this?

320
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:28,980
She is your pure and pure wife.

321
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
I just don't like her.

322
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,980
You know that in my heart,

323
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,980
you are the only wife I have.

324
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,980
You are the only wife I have.

325
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:47,980
But I'm still the only one

326
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,980
who can help you.

327
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:54,980
I'm sorry.

328
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:56,980
I'm sorry.

329
00:20:57,980 --> 00:20:58,980
I'm sorry.

330
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:01,980
I'm sorry.

331
00:21:02,980 --> 00:21:04,980
I'm sorry.

332
00:21:04,980 --> 00:21:05,980
I'm sorry.

333
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:07,980
I'm sorry.

334
00:21:08,980 --> 00:21:09,980
I'm sorry.

335
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:10,980
I'm sorry.

336
00:21:11,980 --> 00:21:12,980
I'm sorry.

337
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,980
Right here.

338
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:15,980
Burn it.

339
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:17,980
I've told you to make a mistake.

340
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:18,980
Yes.

341
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,980
How did it happen?

342
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,980
Yes.

343
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:27,980
My lord.

344
00:21:27,980 --> 00:21:29,980
The sound of the coffin falling

345
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,980
was very loud.

346
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,980
The mistakes made

347
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
by the few people in the palace

348
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,980
were all killed by the fox.

349
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:36,980
So the old legend says

350
00:21:36,980 --> 00:21:38,980
that there is a devil who is the culprit.

351
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,980
My lord.

352
00:21:40,980 --> 00:21:41,980
The person who died today

353
00:21:41,980 --> 00:21:42,980
is a Chinese.

354
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,980
He has several enemies.

355
00:21:44,980 --> 00:21:45,980
And a blood.

356
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,980
It looks very promising.

357
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,980
Look at this.

358
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:49,980
It's better to burn it

359
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,980
and sell it to us.

360
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,980
You dare to send it to a dead person.

361
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:54,980
No wonder someone is making money.

362
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,980
Xiao Jiang's head wants you to take the job.

363
00:21:58,980 --> 00:21:59,980
Alright.

364
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Where do you think you are going?

365
00:22:00,980 --> 00:22:01,980
Alright.

366
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:02,980
The master said

367
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,980
we should let Qi Yan

368
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:04,980
see him burn the dead.

369
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:06,980
I'm sorry.

370
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:07,980
I saw him burn the dead.

371
00:22:08,980 --> 00:22:09,980
Please.

372
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:12,980
Hurry up.

373
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:31,980
Hurry up.

374
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:33,980
Hurry up.

375
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:34,980
Hurry up.

376
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,980
Hurry up.

377
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:37,980
Hurry up.

378
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:54,980
My lord.

379
00:22:58,980 --> 00:22:59,980
My lord.

380
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,980
Are you feeling better?

381
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,980
I'm not a enemy.

382
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:10,980
I'm just a murderer.

383
00:23:11,980 --> 00:23:13,980
I must be a blood.

384
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,980
Do you remember this?

385
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,980
Yes.

386
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Father.

387
00:23:22,980 --> 00:23:23,980
You are not filial.

388
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:26,980
You are not filial.

389
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:30,980
You are going to kill me.

390
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,980
You are so cruel.

391
00:23:33,980 --> 00:23:34,980
You want to be the emperor.

392
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:36,980
You want to kill me.

393
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:38,980
Father.

394
00:23:38,980 --> 00:23:40,980
That's just to anger Sun Jing's power.

395
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,980
I have to save you.

396
00:23:48,980 --> 00:23:49,980
Save me?

397
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,980
Where is this?

398
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:58,980
This is the copper coffin.

399
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:00,980
Since Sun Jing was murdered,

400
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:03,980
he has been kept in the capital.

401
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,980
I have been planning to save him.

402
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:10,980
Through the soldiers in the palace,

403
00:24:11,980 --> 00:24:14,980
I can only wait for the execution.

404
00:24:18,980 --> 00:24:20,980
What a good execution.

405
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,980
Your execution is to give Sun Jing

406
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,980
a heart that is not a big deal.

407
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Do you know?

408
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:29,980
If Sun Jing is still alive,

409
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:31,980
I will kill him.

410
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:36,980
Father.

411
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:38,980
I know that after you see the letter,

412
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,980
you will be furious.

413
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,980
You are always in a bad health.

414
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:43,980
You are always in a bad health.

415
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,980
You will be in a bad health.

416
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
I will kill you.

417
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,980
I will use the dead medicine.

418
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:51,980
I will let you kill Sun Jing.

419
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,980
When you enter the palace,

420
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:55,980
you will be saved by me

421
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,980
in the Taojiao.

422
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:03,980
You are so mean.

423
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:06,980
You are so mean.

424
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,980
You are so arrogant.

425
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,980
You are doing the death

426
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,980
of your father.

427
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:14,980
Do you know?

428
00:25:15,980 --> 00:25:16,980
I don't dare.

429
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,980
What else do you dare?

430
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:25,980
I will see you get angry.

431
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:29,980
Get out.

432
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:31,980
Get out.

433
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,980
Yes.

434
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:36,980
I will leave now.

435
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:38,980
When you get angry,

436
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:40,980
I will come to see you.

437
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,980
Get out.

438
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,980
General.

439
00:26:06,980 --> 00:26:08,980
I heard that you have returned to Lord Liang.

440
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:10,980
You have made a chicken soup.

441
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:11,980
You have boiled the oil.

442
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,980
Then you can eat the eggs.

443
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,980
I think you are so healthy.

444
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,980
You can use some food for your health.

445
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,980
You can also cultivate your own food.

446
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,980
I don't know.

447
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,980
My lady is guarding the little stove.

448
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:24,980
She has cooked a few dishes.

449
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:25,980
She is so good at cooking.

450
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:26,980
She is so good at cooking.

451
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:28,980
I think you are so good at cooking.

452
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:30,980
I think you are so good at cooking.

453
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,980
I think you are so good at cooking.

454
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:33,980
I think you are so good at cooking.

455
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:34,980
I have cooked a few dishes.

456
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,980
I think you are so good at cooking.

457
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:36,980
I am so good at cooking.

458
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:39,980
Miss Gu, you are so thoughtful.

459
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Where is General?

460
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:42,980
He is a general.

461
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,980
He is busy with military affairs.

462
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:45,980
My mother is so good at cooking.

463
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:47,980
She is so gentle.

464
00:26:47,980 --> 00:26:49,980
She has put a lot of trouble in the army.

465
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:51,980
Since you have returned to Lord Liang,

466
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:53,980
please allow my mother to take care of

467
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,980
your health.

468
00:27:00,980 --> 00:27:01,980
Well...

469
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:03,980
It's not good to trouble Miss Gu.

470
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,980
Now that my father has just been saved,

471
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:07,980
there are some new things to do.

472
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:09,980
I am not good at tempering.

473
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:11,980
Please don't worry.

474
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:14,980
My mother has also been a good mother.

475
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:16,980
She knows that she is sick and suffering.

476
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:18,980
Of course she will be a little tempered.

477
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,980
Please don't worry.

478
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,980
My mother will take care of Lord Liang.

479
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,980
Yes.

480
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:25,980
My lady is so thoughtful.

481
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,980
Our master was sick at that time.

482
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:27,980
She was the one who was in the army.

483
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:30,980
Please let my mother

484
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:31,980
take care of her health.

485
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:37,980
Thank you, Miss Gu.

486
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,980
Miss Taozi.

487
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:02,980
Are you feeling better?

488
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,980
It's nothing serious.

489
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:06,980
I just feel better after a few days.

490
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:08,980
Are you hungry?

491
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:09,980
Have something to eat.

492
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:13,980
Okay.

493
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:21,980
What's wrong? Is the noodles not good?

494
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:24,980
It's so hot.

495
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,980
Is it good to eat it with pork?

496
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:26,980
Is it good?

497
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:31,980
What are you laughing at?

498
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:32,980
Nothing.

499
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:33,980
The noodles are almost cold.

500
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:34,980
Eat it.

501
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:56,980
Miss Taozi.

502
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Come on.

503
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:54,980
Why are you so drunk?

504
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:56,980
You want to steal my money?

505
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:06,980
How can you know that I stole your money?

506
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:12,980
You are the one who saved your life.

507
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:14,980
Imagine how many times I saved you.

508
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:16,980
You are so mean to the救er.

509
00:30:17,980 --> 00:30:19,980
Don't worry, Royal Descendant.

510
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:21,980
If you have a life,

511
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:24,980
I will definitely make a great effort

512
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:25,980
to save you.

513
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:28,980
I am willing to do it.

514
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:29,980
I will do it.

515
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:37,980
How did you know

516
00:30:37,980 --> 00:30:38,980
someone was going to ambush us?

517
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,980
I know that Luo Yang sent a group of Qing Qi soldiers.

518
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:45,980
They were very angry at him.

519
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:47,980
It was obvious that they were going to ambush us.

520
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:49,980
I came to think of it.

521
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:51,980
Suddenly, I thought of the Cui Jia Jun Cui Li.

522
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,980
He once talked to Peiyuan.

523
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
He wanted to ambush Mr. Cui.

524
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:57,980
I think Cui Li

525
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,980
may not be in contact with anyone else.

526
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,980
He is going to attack Mr. Cui.

527
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:05,980
Yes.

528
00:31:06,980 --> 00:31:08,980
Cui Li must be him.

529
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,980
I don't know what method he used.

530
00:31:14,980 --> 00:31:15,980
How could he let Luo Yang's men

531
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:16,980
give him the money?

532
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,980
Since Cui Li is going to kill Mr. Cui,

533
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
he must find someone

534
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,980
to kill him as a murderer.

535
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:24,980
I am in the same place.

536
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,980
I am the commander of the Zhen Xi Army.

537
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,980
I am the best choice.

538
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:31,980
I think he used this method

539
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,980
to convince my brothers to take the disease.

540
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:36,980
Your brothers?

541
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:39,980
How could they do this?

542
00:31:40,980 --> 00:31:41,980
They are stupid and stupid.

543
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:44,980
They are easily used by others.

544
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
This is an unexpected thing.

545
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:55,980
Isn't Cui Li your master's cousin?

546
00:31:56,980 --> 00:31:57,980
He is also your brother's brother.

547
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,980
No.

548
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:10,980
Ying Zhou is definitely more suspicious.

549
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,980
Where is the master?

550
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,980
Where is Tao Zi?

551
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,980
Are they all injured?

552
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:17,980
Where is my horse?

553
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:20,980
Are you going to rush back to Ying Zhou?

554
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:21,980
I am worried.

555
00:32:24,980 --> 00:32:26,980
Ying Zhou is the root of Cui's army.

556
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:28,980
No.

557
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:30,980
I have to find a way to get back.

558
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,980
Ying, your injury is not fatal.

559
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
But your master

560
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:38,980
may need to recuperate for some time.

561
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,980
If you insist on rushing back,

562
00:32:41,980 --> 00:32:42,980
I won't come to you.

563
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:43,980
But you need to figure out

564
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,980
whether you can get back to the university

565
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:47,980
and if you have the strength

566
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:48,980
to solve Ying Zhou's problem.

567
00:32:48,980 --> 00:32:49,980
Don't worry.

568
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:51,980
The matter of the accident

569
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:53,980
is not as good as we thought.

570
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,980
Is there any other way?

571
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:20,980
Young Master.

572
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:23,980
Young Master, you are awake.

573
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:29,980
Where is Ying?

574
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:31,980
Don't worry, Young Master.

575
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:32,980
Xiaowan is fine.

576
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:33,980
She just got some injuries.

577
00:33:33,980 --> 00:33:34,980
She is not in a good condition.

578
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:36,980
That's good.

579
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
Where is Xing?

580
00:33:43,980 --> 00:33:44,980
Where is Xing?

581
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,980
Young Master.

582
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,980
Xing is gone.

583
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:55,980
Young Master.

584
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:56,980
Don't be sad.

585
00:33:57,980 --> 00:33:58,980
Protecting Young Master

586
00:33:58,980 --> 00:33:59,980
is our duty.

587
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:01,980
But now

588
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:05,980
Xing is gone.

589
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:10,980
Xing is really gone.

590
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,980
Young Master.

591
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:13,980
Xing doesn't look like you.

592
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:14,980
He is so sad.

593
00:34:15,980 --> 00:34:16,980
For Xing,

594
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:18,980
we are all the orphans.

595
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,980
If you didn't take us

596
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:23,980
and Xiao Wei

597
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:24,980
to stay in the Cui family,

598
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:25,980
we wouldn't have the honor.

599
00:34:26,980 --> 00:34:27,980
If we can kill you,

600
00:34:28,980 --> 00:34:29,980
Xing wouldn't regret it.

601
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:31,980
I wouldn't regret it either.

602
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:32,980
You can't say that.

603
00:34:39,980 --> 00:34:40,980
Where is this?

604
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:42,980
The Tongguan.

605
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,980
The army of the Zhenxi Army

606
00:34:43,980 --> 00:34:44,980
is in Lihuang.

607
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,980
He took us here.

608
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:53,980
Li.

609
00:34:54,980 --> 00:34:55,980
Young Master.

610
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:56,980
Take a good rest.

611
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,980
Taozi sold the goods to you.

612
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:00,980
The doctors of the Zhenxi Army

613
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:01,980
have also seen it.

614
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,980
You are injured.

615
00:35:03,980 --> 00:35:04,980
You need to rest well.

616
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:07,980
No.

617
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,980
I can't stay here.

618
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:10,980
Young Master.

619
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,980
We have to make a plan

620
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,980
before the war ends.

621
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:14,980
There are still thousands of medicines

622
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:15,980
in Yingzhou.

623
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:17,980
If you don't take care of it,

624
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,980
you will be in the capital

625
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,980
and be executed.

626
00:35:26,980 --> 00:35:27,980
There is still one more thing.

627
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:31,980
Xing.

628
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:32,980
And those soldiers of the Cui family

629
00:35:32,980 --> 00:35:33,980
who died in the war.

630
00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:36,980
Please, Royal Descendant.

631
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:38,980
Send someone to help me

632
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,980
to take care of them.

633
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:44,980
Don't worry.

634
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:45,980
When you are unconscious,

635
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,980
I have sent someone to take care of

636
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:48,980
the soldiers of the Cui family.

637
00:35:49,980 --> 00:35:50,980
I know that

638
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,980
you are the master's personal guard.

639
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:54,980
I ordered someone to prepare a cup for him.

640
00:35:55,980 --> 00:35:57,980
When you are well-off,

641
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,980
you can go to the inn personally.

642
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:01,980
Ying.

643
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,980
Please come with me.

644
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,980
Thank you.

645
00:36:11,980 --> 00:36:12,980
All right.

646
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,980
Since you are awake,

647
00:36:14,980 --> 00:36:15,980
you should take the medicine.

648
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:17,980
Taozi, keep an eye on the host.

649
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:19,980
I will keep an eye on you.

650
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:20,980
Don't make a scene.

651
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,980
Taozi.

652
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:23,980
Come on.

653
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,980
Taozi,

654
00:36:25,980 --> 00:36:26,980
I am going to look for you.

655
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,980
What a coincidence.

656
00:36:28,980 --> 00:36:29,980
I am going to look for you, too.

657
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:31,980
What do you want from me?

658
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,980
This is my name.

659
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,980
You can't be sure.

660
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,980
It's not a name.

661
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,980
I just want to know

662
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:39,980
if you are okay.

663
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:41,980
I don't know.

664
00:36:42,980 --> 00:36:43,980
It's not a name.

665
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,980
I don't know.

666
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,980
I don't know.

667
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:49,980
I don't know.

668
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:51,980
I don't know.

669
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:52,980
I don't know.

670
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
I found the medicine that I only need for you.

671
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
You put it on your wound.

672
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
It won't hurt if you do that.

673
00:37:02,980 --> 00:37:03,980
You fool.

674
00:37:03,980 --> 00:37:05,980
You forget that I will take the medicine.

675
00:37:05,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Of course I don't forget.

676
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:08,980
I am afraid that

677
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,980
if you don't have it,

678
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,980
you said that

679
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:12,980
your wound will hurt for a few days.

680
00:37:13,980 --> 00:37:14,980
Okay.

681
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:15,980
I will take it.

682
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:16,980
Thank you.

683
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,980
What do you want from me?

684
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:21,980
I want you

685
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:22,980
to help me.

686
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:24,980
What do you want from me?

687
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Just tell me.

688
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:26,980
I will.

689
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:27,980
Do you have sugar?

690
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,980
If you have sugar,

691
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:29,980
it's better.

692
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:31,980
Sugar?

693
00:37:32,980 --> 00:37:33,980
How can we have sugar

694
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:34,980
in the kitchen

695
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:35,980
when we are in the army?

696
00:37:35,980 --> 00:37:36,980
It's better to have sugar.

697
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
What do you want from me?

698
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,980
Our family's filial piety.

699
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:41,980
We don't want to eat

700
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,980
since we were young.

701
00:37:42,980 --> 00:37:44,980
If we have sugar,

702
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,980
we will give her a drop of sugar

703
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,980
after we finish eating.

704
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:47,980
She can eat well.

705
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,980
But there is no emergency room nearby.

706
00:37:50,980 --> 00:37:51,980
I will go and buy it.

707
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,980
Prince Lian has arrived at the capital.

708
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,980
I hope that

709
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
you can be a good son

710
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,980
and be a good son.

711
00:38:10,980 --> 00:38:11,980
Don't worry, Your Highness.

712
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:13,980
I will be safe.

713
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,980
Li Ni has taken the capital.

714
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:19,980
I think

715
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:22,980
she has been in a mess.

716
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:23,980
Look.

717
00:38:23,980 --> 00:38:25,980
She has been in charge of the war.

718
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:27,980
She has made the people

719
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:28,980
in the city

720
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:29,980
eat well enough

721
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
for three months.

722
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:31,980
It seems that

723
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:32,980
she has been

724
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:33,980
well-prepared

725
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,980
and well-prepared.

726
00:38:35,980 --> 00:38:36,980
Will the emperor

727
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,980
be the emperor at that time?

728
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:43,980
The capital is in the capital.

729
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,980
It's hard to guard it.

730
00:38:45,980 --> 00:38:47,980
Li Ni will not be forced to attack.

731
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,980
I really hope so.

732
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:01,980
Before Sun Jing

733
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,980
returns to the army of Zheng Baiyue,

734
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:04,980
Li Ni will be able to

735
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,980
return to the capital.

736
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:08,980
What are you doing?

737
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:09,980
You don't even use the lunch.

738
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,980
I just went to the mountains to take a walk.

739
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:19,980
Shi Qi Lang,

740
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:20,980
you are now the commander

741
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
of the Zhengxi Army.

742
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:22,980
You can't do anything

743
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,980
without being able to take care of yourself.

744
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:25,980
Just like this time,

745
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:26,980
you didn't care about the danger

746
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:28,980
and went to save the He family.

747
00:39:28,980 --> 00:39:29,980
He family is the only family

748
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,980
that can save the people.

749
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,980
I hope that

750
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:33,980
you can be a good son

751
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:34,980
and be a good son.

752
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:35,980
I hope that

753
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,980
you can be a good son

754
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:37,980
and be a good son.

755
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,980
You are loyal to Cui Lin.

756
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:40,980
He will soon

757
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,980
become our new general.

758
00:39:43,980 --> 00:39:44,980
I think

759
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:47,980
he is more loyal to Cui Yi.

760
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:49,980
Do you think

761
00:39:49,980 --> 00:39:50,980
he is very strange

762
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:52,980
between Cui and Mr. Cui?

763
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:53,980
What's strange?

764
00:39:53,980 --> 00:39:55,980
Is that He family's filial piety

765
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:56,980
or the filial piety of filial piety

766
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:57,980
all the same?

767
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,980
The father and son are the same.

768
00:40:00,980 --> 00:40:02,980
I don't necessarily say something.

769
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:05,980
But if I don't say anything to you,

770
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:06,980
then no one will say anything to you.

771
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,980
The marriage of the four forces

772
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,980
is not done by the emperor.

773
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,980
You misunderstood

774
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:14,980
what you were thinking.

775
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:16,980
Mr. Shen,

776
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:17,980
look.

777
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,980
I've prepared everything.

778
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:20,980
I'll tell you later.

779
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:22,980
Where are you going?

780
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:24,980
I won't tell you.

781
00:41:32,980 --> 00:41:33,980
I'll tell you later.

782
00:42:02,980 --> 00:42:03,980
I'll tell you later.

783
00:42:32,980 --> 00:42:34,980
I'll tell you later.
