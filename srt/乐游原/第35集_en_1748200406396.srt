1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,280
My double top

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:05,140
In Shanghai, I will regret

3
00:00:05,140 --> 00:00:08,660
All the townares

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:30,880
Come.

5
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:36,340
Let me help you.

6
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,080
It's fine.

7
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,800
Rest in peace now.

8
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,740
I can't keep on eatingME.

9
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,280
I'll have two dishes for breakfast

10
00:00:54,080 --> 00:00:55,200
after I'm done.

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,360
I ask the palace prince to check for the написvous.

12
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:25,800
Prince

13
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:27,900
就 sue Duke Qin.

14
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:31,940
No�� Yunyun's certo.

15
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,820
What's going on there?

16
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,100
When did she graduate?

17
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,320
If shebra should come to be elected,

18
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:42,900
than what happened then?

19
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:46,260
The former one has come to be theishi.

20
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,160
Minister,

21
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,380
you're late.

22
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:55,020
Your Highness and Princess Consort

23
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:56,180
will go to the Fengzhang Hall

24
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,140
to greet Your Majesty and Empress.

25
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,740
So I only came until now.

26
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,540
Tomorrow, I will definitely come at 5 o'clock.

27
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,700
I will set up the palace for Princess Consort.

28
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,500
No need.

29
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,060
I won't come without my own permission.

30
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:11,580
And there are many people here.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,660
You don't have to come here to set up.

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,660
Yes.

33
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:25,380
I made a painting of the moon.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,740
I congratulate Your Highness and Princess Consort

35
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,220
on your wedding.

36
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,020
It's a good one.

37
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,780
You are so great.

38
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:35,660
Since the news of the wedding

39
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,540
has been sent by Your Highness,

40
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,780
I am happier than anyone.

41
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:39,860
First, I am lucky

42
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,860
to be with you.

43
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,340
Until you are a kind and kind person,

44
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:46,260
you don't have any affection for me.

45
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,940
Second, Your Highness became a princess.

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,820
Your Highness is happy.

47
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,060
Of course, I am happy.

48
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,620
I feel that I have the heart of a princess.

49
00:02:57,300 --> 00:03:00,020
The painting of the moon is indeed good.

50
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,620
It's just right.

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:03,740
I still need a flat brush.

52
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,380
Then help me to make a big brush.

53
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,780
I won't trouble you.

54
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,100
Your Highness is so polite.

55
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,060
I won't trouble you.

56
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,700
Your Highness looks like my fortune.

57
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,940
That's good.

58
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:20,500
I am tired.

59
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,420
You can go back and rest.

60
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:23,900
Yes.

61
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,420
I will come to Your Highness tomorrow.

62
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,260
You don't have to come tomorrow.

63
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,860
Since the princess consort likes your embroidery,

64
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:38,300
then you should fix it quickly.

65
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,060
Yes.

66
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,620
How about we try to replace the doctor?

67
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,260
The princess consort did it on purpose.

68
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,660
She didn't learn magic for a long time.

69
00:04:02,980 --> 00:04:04,380
She clearly knew that

70
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:04,900
Emperor Liang

71
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,980
needs to salute lose to her and Your Highness,

72
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,660
on the spot of Spring Festival.

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:14,580
She even asked you to build the Guats' Hall.

74
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:16,700
Put on a ceremony

75
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:18,300
to fix the cross-wood on the moon.

76
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,220
It's a wishful thinking.

77
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,500
Even Your Highness

78
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,060
My son,

79
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:25,220
you can complain to the crown prince.

80
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:31,420
The crown princess is the only daughter of General Cui.

81
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:32,980
She is in a relationship with the family.

82
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,580
She doesn't even want to get married.

83
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:37,180
I don't know how long she has been fighting with the army.

84
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,820
She has been sleeping and getting married.

85
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:42,300
It's obvious that she is a coward.

86
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:44,380
She just doesn't want to see my father.

87
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,980
Since she doesn't want to see me,

88
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,580
it means she cares about me.

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:50,500
Since she cares about me,

90
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,820
I should show up in front of her.

91
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,220
I should remind her.

92
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:56,820
In the Eastern Palace,

93
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:58,020
there is a crown prince and a brother

94
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,700
besides her.

95
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:16,940
Your Highness.

96
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:21,460
You...

97
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:23,340
Who is it?

98
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:25,780
And what's up?

99
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,420
This thing.

100
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:28,980
I don't know this.

101
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:31,940
Please.

102
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:36,020
I don't know it.

103
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,460
I didn't do anything to protect you.

104
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:42,580
But I fell in love with a happy man.

105
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,180
I might have treated very badly

106
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,300
and nearly killed him.

107
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:49,380
I haven't seen him for a long time.

108
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:51,200
Lending you a kiss to my sister?

109
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:53,540
Troublerie is a liar.

110
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,940
You are坦白.

111
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:09,380
I hurriedly gave you this.

112
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,080
You can Neither Yellow Nor intention to make her fall for my sister.

113
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:17,060
When fans encourage one's brother to dat when they hear that it will exciting,

114
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,420
The yaşat plan

115
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,500
scattering

116
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:42,660
General Cui.

117
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,020
Every day the time should be here.

118
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:49,140
I'll go pick it up.

119
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,460
Is it calling me?

120
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,100
Who are you?

121
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,780
Look.

122
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,140
This is a good place.

123
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:10,940
If that enemy does what?

124
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,940
What should we do?

125
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:17,940
What should we do if the enemy comes to rob us?

126
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,940
The enemy is a good match. The enemy is a good match.

127
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,940
If the enemy is quite good,

128
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:30,940
we will use the bow there.

129
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,940
If the enemy is more than me,

130
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:37,940
we will use the bow on the left and on the right.

131
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
If the enemy is more than me,

132
00:07:40,940 --> 00:07:41,940
we will use the bow on the right.

133
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,940
You are right.

134
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:48,940
How can a Cui's army have such a descendant like you?

135
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
It's a rare and precious thing.

136
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,940
Tell me your name.

137
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
I will be your captain in the future.

138
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,940
I will make a good contribution.

139
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:01,940
The poison is not good.

140
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,940
General.

141
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:07,940
I am Li Ni.

142
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:15,940
I heard your name.

143
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,940
I didn't realize it.

144
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:27,940
I think I have seen you there.

145
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:30,940
But I can't remember it.

146
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:43,940
Miss.

147
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,940
I give general the ten-pronged medicine every day.

148
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
Although general woke up,

149
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,940
he still said many things.

150
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,940
I am sick.

151
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:01,940
I am afraid the ten-pronged medicine

152
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:04,940
will be used to cure the disease.

153
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:06,940
I am sick.

154
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:08,940
I am sick.

155
00:09:09,940 --> 00:09:10,940
I am sick.

156
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
I am afraid the ten-pronged medicine

157
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:13,940
will not cure the disease.

158
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,940
We have to think about other ways.

159
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,940
I will go back and check some more medicines.

160
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:23,940
See if there is any medical treatment.

161
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:32,940
What's wrong?

162
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Just tell me.

163
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,940
The news from the Dali Temple.

164
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:47,940
Liu Chengfeng is too seriously ill.

165
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,940
He is infected with a cold.

166
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:51,940
He has been feverish.

167
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
He died last night.

168
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,940
He died?

169
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:12,940
You and the emperor are getting married.

170
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
Your Majesty is going to take the throne.

171
00:10:16,940 --> 00:10:19,940
The Dali Temple thought Liu Chengfeng was also infected.

172
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:24,940
So he changed his prison to the prison.

173
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
Who would have thought

174
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,940
there was a criminal in the prison who got a cold.

175
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,940
He was infected by many people.

176
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,940
He was infected by him.

177
00:10:34,940 --> 00:10:35,940
He died like this.

178
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
Where is the corpse?

179
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
Because of the cold,

180
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
the Dali Temple was not buried easily.

181
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
He was buried by his corpse

182
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:49,940
and other criminals.

183
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,940
He burned the ashes

184
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,940
and buried them in the prison.

185
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:03,940
I know.

186
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:12,940
Your Majesty,

187
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:14,940
how long do you need to fix

188
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:16,940
such a big dress?

189
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
Why don't you choose a simple pattern

190
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,940
and fix it early?

191
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
Since I can fix it,

192
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
I can't deny it.

193
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
I just need to fix a white bird's nest.

194
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:31,940
White bird's nest?

195
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:34,940
Then I need to use hundreds of threads.

196
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
I'm afraid I'll have to fix it for a year and a half.

197
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:37,940
My lady,

198
00:11:37,940 --> 00:11:38,940
no.

199
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
My lady,

200
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:40,940
no.

201
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,940
My brother.

202
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
This is so good.

203
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,940
Yes.

204
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
Such a complicated pattern.

205
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,940
I need to fix it slowly.

206
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:54,940
In the city hall where the crown princess lives,

207
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,940
there is such a white bird's nest.

208
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
It's so good.

209
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,940
But I don't know if I can fix it

210
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
and if it can stay there.

211
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,940
I'm old now.

212
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:14,940
I used to have this patience.

213
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,940
What fish did I fish?

214
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:20,940
I fished a few in the water.

215
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
I was in a hurry.

216
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:26,940
But then,

217
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,940
the fish and the snake-fishing suit

218
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
looked very similar.

219
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
Look.

220
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,940
The fish and the snake-fishing suit

221
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,940
looked very similar.

222
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,940
Look.

223
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
In the water,

224
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,940
there is a fish

225
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,940
with a strong tail.

226
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,940
Then I need to hold the breath

227
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,940
and wait for the fish to go up.

228
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
Look.

229
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,940
Does it look like the snake-fishing suit?

230
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,940
General,

231
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:03,940
tell me about the Cui Xia Fishing.

232
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,940
The Cui Xia Fishing suit

233
00:13:10,940 --> 00:13:12,940
was in the civilized age.

234
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:14,940
At that time,

235
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:33,000
the

236
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
land was too large.

237
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
The court gave it to Liang Xiang.

238
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
The Cui Xia Fishing suit

239
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
had to go to the city to kill the enemies.

240
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,000
They died early.

241
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
So the elders

242
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
always had to

243
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
get married and have children.

244
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm already angry

245
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
when I was in your age.

246
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I'm angry too.

247
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:07,000
I only got the firewoodしよう

248
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,700
Honey

249
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:17,600
It's okay

250
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:21,360
I really don't let you down

251
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:24,000
for the people to be their Mostly people come to Xicheng

252
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,440
What a pity

253
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,940
my wife

254
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,540
once

255
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,360
I was treating to win a war

256
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,680
after a color

257
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,260
the others came to Xicheng

258
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,160
with their wives

259
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:49,420
and surely

260
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,420
We didn't even have a little bit of a follow-up step.

261
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:56,900
Then theyILL immediately settle for a new state.

262
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:09,700
Once I'm finally back,

263
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:13,800
Our bond will never be changed.

264
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,860
Don't worry.

265
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,240
This Khan Hua didn't meddle her in the end.

266
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,180
There was a child.

267
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,300
Otherwise,

268
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,660
he wouldn't have survived.

269
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:51,500
General.

270
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,940
It's hard to talk to a boy.

271
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,260
It's just a sad story.

272
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,780
My wife and I have been married for over ten years.

273
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:07,420
She followed me around the world.

274
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,500
We haven't even had a good day.

275
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,380
My wife and I

276
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:20,540
never thought we would be so happy.

277
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,180
Even the last time we met,

278
00:16:28,660 --> 00:16:30,900
this is my biggest regret.

279
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,100
Tell me.

280
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,220
What's the point of having a big husband?

281
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
That was the biggest regret

282
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,700
in my heart.

283
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:50,420
At that time, I only had one thing in my heart.

284
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,380
It was revenge.

285
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:56,780
Revenge for my wife.

286
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,060
Later,

287
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,220
I was revenge for my wife.

288
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,720
It was better that

289
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,220
our Sui army was taken in

290
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:18,380
by the imperial court.

291
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:21,820
As a political court,

292
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,980
they 이름ously called them

293
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,820
imperial reunions between the Western State and the Western State.

294
00:17:30,380 --> 00:17:31,580
Both the imperial officers

295
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,300
and the imperial subjects wereprom Helen.

296
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,140
I've always thought

297
00:17:39,700 --> 00:18:01,420
It is as if overt AR and

298
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:05,540
a car is left off.

299
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:07,540
I could just have a good look at it.

300
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:12,540
You were late.

301
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,540
You didn't see me

302
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,540
setting up a trap in the water.

303
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:21,540
That snow was very big.

304
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:25,540
We, the Cui family,

305
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:27,540
were buried in the snow.

306
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,540
It was so quiet.

307
00:18:30,540 --> 00:18:31,540
It was really

308
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:34,540
a bird's-eye view.

309
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:38,540
The half-wit was dead.

310
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:40,540
Such a big snow.

311
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:44,540
I couldn't even see a living thing.

312
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:47,540
I think

313
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,540
maybe

314
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,540
it's better to not walk this path

315
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:56,540
and have the snow falling.

316
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,540
Then I'll be buried here

317
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,540
in the middle of the snow.

318
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,540
But I didn't expect

319
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,540
the Cui family would be so important.

320
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:12,540
The dream

321
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:13,540
you grew up in

322
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,540
is so weird.

323
00:19:15,540 --> 00:19:16,540
I've heard that

324
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,540
since the Cui family was formed,

325
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,540
the Cui family

326
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
would never cross the Cui Mountain again.

327
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,540
Sun Jing

328
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,540
defeated Yi Luo

329
00:19:29,540 --> 00:19:30,540
and

330
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,540
I drove out the people

331
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,540
from the Cui Mountain

332
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,540
to the line

333
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:35,540
and let Qin army

334
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,540
never come near the river.

335
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,540
Whether it's the court or the people,

336
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:42,540
that's a happy thing.

337
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:43,540
All of us

338
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:45,540
are the three of us.

339
00:19:46,540 --> 00:19:47,540
His Majesty

340
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,540
called for our imperial office

341
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,540
and didn't eat the food.

342
00:19:53,540 --> 00:19:54,540
After leaving the palace,

343
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
he ran to Fengyin House

344
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,540
to find food.

345
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:00,540
Then

346
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,540
Sun Jing and Pei Xian

347
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:03,540
drove them out of the line.

348
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,540
They were drunk.

349
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
I think I remember

350
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,540
who you are.

351
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:24,540
Come here.

352
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
You are

353
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,540
Pei Xian's son.

354
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,540
Pei Mang

355
00:20:32,540 --> 00:20:33,540
was 13 years old.

356
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,540
You were waiting for your father

357
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
in Fengyin House.

358
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
Your father couldn't sing.

359
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:41,540
You blamed me and Sun Jing

360
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,540
for making your father drunk.

361
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,540
General

362
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
Pei Mang is my brother.

363
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,540
I'm Pei Yuan.

364
00:20:56,540 --> 00:20:57,540
I think

365
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,540
you are very familiar with him.

366
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:04,540
Are you

367
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:08,540
Sun Jing's son?

368
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,540
Wait.

369
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,540
The floor is cold.

370
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,540
You should

371
00:22:05,540 --> 00:22:06,540
keep this bed.

372
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,540
No need.

373
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,540
Two beds in total.

374
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,540
Cover it.

375
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:57,540
Why are you here?

376
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,540
I'm here to serve

377
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
Your Highness the Crown Princess.

378
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,540
The weather is nice today.

379
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
I went to the garden

380
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,540
to get some.

381
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,540
I'll finish the work

382
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,540
before Your Highness the Crown Princess.

383
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,540
The Crown Princess is still sleeping?

384
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
Yes.

385
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,540
The Crown Princess said

386
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
she would come to the garden

387
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,540
to take care of her.

388
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
But

389
00:23:16,540 --> 00:23:17,540
she is not here.

390
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
She is not here.

391
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:21,540
She is not here.

392
00:23:22,540 --> 00:23:23,540
She is not here.

393
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
She is not here.

394
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,540
The Crown Princess said

395
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
she would not come to the garden.

396
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,540
So I'm afraid

397
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
I'll disturb her

398
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,540
and wait here.

399
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
No need.

400
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:33,540
The Crown Princess always

401
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
doesn't like these flowers.

402
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,540
Take them back.

403
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:41,540
Your Highness.

404
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
She asked you to embroider the phoenix.

405
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,540
You embroider the phoenix first.

406
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:49,540
Yes.

407
00:23:56,540 --> 00:23:57,540
Your Highness.

408
00:23:58,540 --> 00:23:59,540
I think you have a bad face.

409
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:01,540
Did you get a retort?

410
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,540
Nothing.

411
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,540
It was too cold last night.

412
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,540
I didn't sleep well.

413
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
It was too cold?

414
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
How did the people

415
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,540
in the Eastern Palace

416
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
serve you?

417
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Didn't they

418
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
give you some change

419
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
and get you into the back?

420
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Enough.

421
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
Let's not talk about this.

422
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,540
Let's have a good chat.

423
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
Didn't the doctor say

424
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:28,540
that General Cui's disease

425
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
was caused by the Tan's poem

426
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,540
and caused the heart disease?

427
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:33,540
Is it because of the muddle-headedness

428
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
and the lightness?

429
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:35,540
But the doctor said

430
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:38,540
that the new disease needs a new medicine.

431
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
If General Cui's disease

432
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
doesn't have a positive one,

433
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:44,540
it's hard to cure it.

434
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
The doctor said

435
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,540
it's better to

436
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,540
remove the blood

437
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,540
from General Cui's chest

438
00:24:49,540 --> 00:24:50,540
and make it better.

439
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Or it's better to

440
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:54,540
make General Cui

441
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,540
re-emerge in the war.

442
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:58,540
It's also good for him.

443
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:01,540
General Cui is old enough.

444
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:02,540
And you know

445
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:03,540
how the situation is now.

446
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:05,540
General Cui has been removed.

447
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,540
How can he be in the war?

448
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,540
Then we can only bet.

449
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,540
We can remember him.

450
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
Your Highness,

451
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
you are a dangerous person.

452
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:17,540
The doctor said

453
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,540
if we can't cure him,

454
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
General Cui's disease

455
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,540
will be more serious.

456
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:23,540
I was with him

457
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,540
every day before.

458
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,540
I knew that General Cui

459
00:25:27,540 --> 00:25:28,540
was the most patient

460
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,540
and his wife's death.

461
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,540
Only by using this

462
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:35,540
can we cure him.

463
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:36,540
I think

464
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:38,540
if General Cui

465
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:40,540
knows his disease,

466
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,540
he will also be more cautious.

467
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,540
Because he is a

468
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:46,540
useful person.

469
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,540
I believe him.

470
00:25:49,540 --> 00:25:50,540
I understand.

471
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,540
You are so kind.

472
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:56,540
I am not a person

473
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,540
who can make him

474
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,540
die in the war.

475
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:00,540
I am just a person

476
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,540
who can cure him.

477
00:26:03,540 --> 00:26:04,540
Miss.

478
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:08,540
Miss.

479
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,540
The garden in the Eastern Palace

480
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,540
is so big.

481
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,540
I think these flowers

482
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:12,540
are very good.

483
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:13,540
I picked them for you.

484
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:17,540
What a coincidence.

485
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,540
The Crown Prince

486
00:26:18,540 --> 00:26:19,540
was on the way.

487
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:20,540
He asked me

488
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,540
if these flowers are enough.

489
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,540
After you came to the Eastern Palace,

490
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,540
are you used to it?

491
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,540
Do you want to

492
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,540
set up a small kitchen for you in the Eastern Palace?

493
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,540
You can leave first.

494
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:37,540
Isn't it nice?

495
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,540
What's wrong?

496
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:48,540
Are you still angry with him?

497
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:51,540
He was like that just now.

498
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,540
He was anxious to

499
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:53,540
ask me something.

500
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,540
But don't worry.

501
00:26:55,540 --> 00:26:56,540
I didn't say anything.

502
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,540
I was scared that he would come.

503
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:00,540
I said that

504
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,540
you can't eat or sleep well.

505
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,540
You can't sleep well either.

506
00:27:03,540 --> 00:27:04,540
No.

507
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,540
You are both sleeping

508
00:27:07,540 --> 00:27:08,540
in the same room.

509
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,540
You can't lie to him.

510
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,540
Miss.

511
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,540
Did I say something wrong?

512
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:15,540
Then...

513
00:27:15,540 --> 00:27:16,540
Are you sure you can't eat well?

514
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
You haven't

515
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,540
eaten anything for the past two days.

516
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:20,540
Taozi.

517
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,540
I've been

518
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,540
thinking about something these days.

519
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,540
What is it?

520
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:28,540
I always think

521
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:31,540
Liu Chengfeng is not dead.

522
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,540
No way.

523
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,540
Look.

524
00:27:37,540 --> 00:27:38,540
It's a coincidence.

525
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,540
He just returned from

526
00:27:40,540 --> 00:27:41,540
the prison alone

527
00:27:41,540 --> 00:27:43,540
and got hurt immediately.

528
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,540
Then he left

529
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,540
and immediately reported to the king.

530
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,540
Because of the wound,

531
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:50,540
he couldn't be treated.

532
00:27:50,540 --> 00:27:52,540
He got hurt immediately.

533
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:54,540
Don't you think

534
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:57,540
it's a coincidence?

535
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Miss.

536
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:01,540
What do you mean?

537
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:03,540
Although Cui's army is gone,

538
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,540
the secret weapon

539
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:05,540
that we installed

540
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:06,540
in the prison

541
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,540
is still there.

542
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,540
You two can go and check it out.

543
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:09,540
See if Liu Chengfeng

544
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:10,540
has any

545
00:28:10,540 --> 00:28:11,540
any problem

546
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,540
with his death.

547
00:28:13,540 --> 00:28:14,540
And what's the problem

548
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,540
with Liu Chengfeng?

549
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,540
I always think

550
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,540
Liu Chengfeng and Jieshu

551
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
won't be able to handle it.

552
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:24,540
This is the medicine

553
00:28:24,540 --> 00:28:25,540
sent by Jieshu.

554
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:40,540
Sir.

555
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,540
Jieshu's army

556
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,540
sent a message to the prison.

557
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,540
He is dissatisfied

558
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:47,540
with your actions.

559
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:49,540
He said he needs to

560
00:28:49,540 --> 00:28:51,540
give you more important things.

561
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,540
You are so greedy.

562
00:28:55,540 --> 00:28:56,540
Sir.

563
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,540
How about we think of a way

564
00:28:59,540 --> 00:29:00,540
to get rid of Jieshu's evil power

565
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,540
and leave?

566
00:29:05,540 --> 00:29:06,540
How is Ying?

567
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,540
The Eastern Palace is a wild place.

568
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:14,540
I can't

569
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:16,540
defeat him.

570
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,540
Sir.

571
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:28,540
Shuhu.

572
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,540
Don't worry.

573
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
I will not die anyway.

574
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:35,540
It hurts.

575
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,540
But if it doesn't hurt,

576
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,540
how can I remember

577
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:46,540
the feeling of pain?

578
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,540
I will not die anyway.

579
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:57,540
I will not die anyway.

580
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,540
Ling.

581
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,540
It's really time to die.

582
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,540
I will take Ying back someday.

583
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,540
Because I will let Ling know

584
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,540
that the one who was taken away

585
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,540
is the one who drove the heart of the traitor.

586
00:30:25,540 --> 00:30:26,540
Sir.

587
00:30:27,540 --> 00:30:28,660
I'm not sure.

588
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:33,020
I'm really worried about you.

589
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,900
I've said that

590
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,380
I'm not a person who is married to others.

591
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,260
I can be a concubine

592
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,820
or a servant.

593
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,660
I've come to the Eastern Palace

594
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,780
to be a good son for you.

595
00:30:47,020 --> 00:30:48,340
I can't come to visit you

596
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:50,420
even if I'm a military official.

597
00:30:50,540 --> 00:30:52,980
So I'm very happy today

598
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,780
to visit you.

599
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,340
You're welcome.

600
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,020
If you're a woman,

601
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,220
it's normal for you to visit me.

602
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:04,020
I'm just worried

603
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:06,220
that I can't let you down.

604
00:31:06,660 --> 00:31:08,260
I've asked you

605
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,620
if you're grateful for your spirit.

606
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:11,820
You said that

607
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:14,580
you were very concerned about her

608
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:16,460
in the Eastern Palace.

609
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,380
I should have been worried.

610
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,660
But

611
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,420
I just sent my daughter

612
00:31:22,540 --> 00:31:23,780
to the Eastern Palace

613
00:31:23,860 --> 00:31:24,980
to talk about it.

614
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:27,300
I don't know

615
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:28,900
where she is.

616
00:31:29,020 --> 00:31:31,060
Her Highness is very unhappy.

617
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,060
Since she entered the Eastern Palace,

618
00:31:33,340 --> 00:31:34,500
Her Highness has never

619
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:36,900
been so kind to her.

620
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:39,260
Even sitting in her box,

621
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,700
she hasn't been there for a long time.

622
00:31:45,860 --> 00:31:49,060
You know a lot about the court.

623
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,860
I understand.

624
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,100
I'm just worried

625
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:55,700
that I might have made a mistake

626
00:31:55,860 --> 00:31:57,620
in the palace.

627
00:31:57,860 --> 00:31:58,700
Or

628
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:01,420
I might have offended you.

629
00:32:02,140 --> 00:32:04,300
You don't have to give me the face.

630
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:06,500
If she really made a mistake,

631
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,700
I'll let Crown Princess Consort

632
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,820
teach her a lesson.

633
00:32:09,820 --> 00:32:10,660
Well...

634
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:15,100
I'm not wrong.

635
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,820
Since that,

636
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,540
please take care of me

637
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:20,300
in the face of Crown Prince.

638
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:22,460
I'll take care of you

639
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:26,020
this is our honor走吧.

640
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,420
Your Highness.

641
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,220
Since she has entered the Eastern Palace,

642
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,340
Her Highness has never been

643
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,700
so kind and disconnectionAY.

644
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,100
If others see her,

645
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:38,540
I'm sure

646
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:41,700
Her Highness really doesn't like

647
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:44,260
The lover of Crown Prince.

648
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,300
Don't worry, Your Highness.

649
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:50,700
I finally understood her.

650
00:32:52,460 --> 00:32:54,860
I won't go to the night market with him tonight.

651
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:58,260
I'm going to the night market with Gu Liang.

652
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:01,860
Yes.

653
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:02,660
And

654
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:05,860
I must tell the crown princess

655
00:33:06,260 --> 00:33:07,460
to come back with me.

656
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:09,860
Yes.

657
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,260
I'm going to the night market with Gu Liang.

658
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,260
I really just want to tell the crown prince this?

659
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:38,260
Of course.

660
00:33:38,660 --> 00:33:39,660
Our lady.

661
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,380
I'm not going to drive you away.

662
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:42,980
Didn't you say

663
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,820
that you're anxious to meet His Highness?

664
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:47,660
Then don't you have anything to say to me?

665
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:49,580
I...

666
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:51,860
Forget it.

667
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:52,860
Just say it.

668
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:55,100
What do you want to say to me?

669
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,740
You fool.

670
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,740
You're running so fast.

671
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:33,020
Your Highness.

672
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:34,380
How is it going?

673
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,580
What did the Crown Princess say?

674
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:38,060
The Crown Princess said that

675
00:34:39,060 --> 00:34:40,140
the Crown Princess said

676
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:42,540
she never wanted to have dinner with His Highness.

677
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:44,860
So where do you want to go?

678
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,500
Where?

679
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,860
Taozi told me

680
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,420
that I must tell His Highness

681
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,380
the reason for the Crown Princess.

682
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,500
It hurts.

683
00:34:55,140 --> 00:34:55,660
What?

684
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,500
You're so dry.

685
00:34:56,820 --> 00:34:57,500
Do you want me to

686
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:58,620
ask the Imperial Physician to check on you?

687
00:34:58,620 --> 00:34:59,460
No need.

688
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,220
I know you can hear me clearly.

689
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,940
Then His Highness knows

690
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,420
that I can hear everything clearly.

691
00:35:05,740 --> 00:35:06,460
Yes.

692
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,820
Bake some more Liberalú.

693
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,980
Don't refuse me!

694
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:24,820
Brother Liang,

695
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:26,140
the crown prince is here.

696
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:33,780
Your Highness.

697
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,100
Yes, please take a seat.

698
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,460
These dishes were made by my brother.

699
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,980
I don't know what you're thinking.

700
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,900
I made some home-cooked dishes

701
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:45,420
according to what my grandmother taught me.

702
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:48,620
You go out first.

703
00:35:48,940 --> 00:35:50,060
I have something to say to my brother.

704
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:51,380
Yes.

705
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,380
Come in.

706
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:08,860
Miss Gu.

707
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,540
You've been nice to me.

708
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:13,340
And I know

709
00:36:13,860 --> 00:36:14,980
what you're thinking.

710
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,140
I know Prince Guessing is my mother.

711
00:36:17,660 --> 00:36:19,100
I feel that I don't know those useless words.

712
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:21,180
When he wasn't in the capital,

713
00:36:21,740 --> 00:36:23,820
his Majesty sent me to the Eastern Palace.

714
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,820
But actually,

715
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,460
I have no choice.

716
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Yes.

717
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,980
I admit I doubted you.

718
00:36:39,340 --> 00:36:40,260
But he's just because

719
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:41,660
you thought you'd gone to only him somehow.

720
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:43,180
What?

721
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,260
I was a little selfish.

722
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,460
But that's because I admired you.

723
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:48,060
I know

724
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,700
I shouldn't make you upset.

725
00:36:51,260 --> 00:36:52,180
I also know

726
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:54,660
that you only like Crown Princess.

727
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:56,780
It has nothing to do with Crown Princess.

728
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:58,420
Even if she's not here,

729
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:00,220
I won't like you.

730
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:02,900
I saved you

731
00:37:03,940 --> 00:37:05,340
because I didn't want to

732
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,300
be a stranger

733
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,660
and I'd save you

734
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,860
under the dangerous situation.

735
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:12,620
I'm not asking you to tell me anything.

736
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:15,340
You've done a lot of things

737
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,580
to fix my mother's necklace

738
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:18,980
and to find my grandma

739
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:19,780
and take care of her.

740
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,300
I'm grateful for that.

741
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:26,340
I'm not grateful for that.

742
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,060
When I went back to the capital,

743
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,460
you entered the Eastern Palace

744
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:34,620
and became the Crown Prince.

745
00:37:35,340 --> 00:37:36,620
And you just found a short sword.

746
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,060
So I think

747
00:37:38,500 --> 00:37:39,940
it's not appropriate for me to tell you.

748
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:41,980
But today,

749
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,380
I want to make it clear.

750
00:37:45,620 --> 00:37:47,020
I don't want to delay your loyalty.

751
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:51,980
Your Highness.

752
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:55,220
My loyalty is your loyalty.

753
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,820
Your Highness, how can you say that?

754
00:37:59,300 --> 00:38:00,420
Although I'm the Crown Prince,

755
00:38:01,180 --> 00:38:02,460
I don't want to

756
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:04,940
keep anything

757
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:06,060
except Crown Princess.

758
00:38:07,940 --> 00:38:09,380
I know I'm going to make you go to the Eastern Palace

759
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,460
and force you to die.

760
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,900
So you should stay in the Eastern Palace.

761
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,620
I'll come back to you

762
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:17,460
and make you feel better.

763
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:19,460
It's not a bad thing

764
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
to stay in the Eastern Palace.

765
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:23,940
But I won't be a burden to you.

766
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,340
I can only let you be the emperor.

767
00:38:28,340 --> 00:38:29,420
But you don't have to.

768
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:31,900
When you have someone to tell me,

769
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,780
I'll make you a doctor

770
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,940
and be a guide.

771
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,780
I'll find a way

772
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,340
to send you out of the Eastern Palace.

773
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:41,900
I'll change my name.

774
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,820
From now on,

775
00:38:44,340 --> 00:38:45,540
you'll be married to a doctor.

776
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:48,340
You're still young.

777
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,100
You should be with a person

778
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,500
who's willing to be a doctor.

779
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,340
But I only like you.

780
00:38:56,540 --> 00:38:58,740
I only want to be a doctor with you.

781
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:00,580
Your Highness, you're saying that

782
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:01,980
you'll be like a knife

783
00:39:01,980 --> 00:39:03,700
on my heart.

784
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:06,900
I really don't know

785
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,500
what I'm doing.

786
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:10,820
I'm asking you to be so angry.

787
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,380
It's good that you're not angry.

788
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:17,020
But I don't like your father.

789
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:21,300
But I like you.

790
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:24,100
I like you more than Crown Princess Consort.

791
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:25,820
Crown Princess Consort is a high-ranking official.

792
00:39:26,060 --> 00:39:27,500
She's a good person.

793
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:31,220
As long as I get your love,

794
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:33,220
I'll be satisfied.

795
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:36,100
I won't treat you like Crown Princess Consort.

796
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:41,220
Your Highness, you're so good to Crown Princess Consort.

797
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:43,340
But what's she doing to you?

798
00:39:44,380 --> 00:39:45,580
That's our business.

799
00:39:47,220 --> 00:39:47,940
Miss Gu,

800
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:50,140
I think you should know it from the beginning.

801
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,300
Love is a difference between love and love.

802
00:39:52,460 --> 00:39:53,740
That's the difference.

803
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,180
Your Highness,

804
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:56,700
Your Highness,

805
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,260
you haven't given me a chance.

806
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,380
How do you know

807
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,180
that I won't love you

808
00:40:01,180 --> 00:40:02,700
like you do?

809
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:05,100
I don't like to be in your shoes.

810
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,940
I don't like to be in your shoes.

811
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:08,460
Miss Gu,

812
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,620
I've said what I should say.

813
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:12,380
Take care.

814
00:40:37,580 --> 00:40:38,160
How about Technical Miss?

815
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:39,340
Really?

816
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,860
masks for you.

817
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:42,020
Help yourself.

818
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:04,060
Please.

819
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,780
His Highness didn't eat anything.

820
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:12,940
Why?

821
00:41:32,220 --> 00:41:33,700
His Highness said

822
00:41:34,220 --> 00:41:36,620
he would come to see me

823
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:40,020
if I stay here.

824
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,060
Your Highness.

825
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:06,060
Your Highness.

826
00:42:06,060 --> 00:42:07,060
Your Highness.

827
00:42:07,060 --> 00:42:08,060
Your Highness.

828
00:42:08,060 --> 00:42:09,060
Your Highness.

829
00:42:09,060 --> 00:42:10,060
Your Highness.

830
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
Your Highness.

831
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Your Highness.

832
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,060
Your Highness.

833
00:42:13,060 --> 00:42:14,060
Your Highness.

834
00:42:14,060 --> 00:42:15,060
Your Highness.

835
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,060
Your Highness.

836
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,060
Your Highness.

837
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:18,060
Your Highness.

838
00:42:18,060 --> 00:42:19,060
Your Highness.

839
00:42:19,060 --> 00:42:20,060
Your Highness.

840
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Your Highness.

841
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:22,060
Your Highness.

842
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,060
Your Highness.

843
00:42:23,060 --> 00:42:24,060
Your Highness.

844
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:25,060
Your Highness.

845
00:42:25,060 --> 00:42:26,060
Your Highness.

846
00:42:26,060 --> 00:42:27,060
Your Highness.

847
00:42:27,060 --> 00:42:28,060
Your Highness.

848
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,060
Your Highness.

849
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,060
Your Highness.

850
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:31,060
Your Highness.

851
00:42:31,060 --> 00:42:32,060
Your Highness.

852
00:42:32,060 --> 00:42:33,060
Your Highness.
