The governing room,

is full of

10
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,540
men and woman now.

00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:54,820
and said that they would come to….

12

Let me take care of him now.

wydaje Han Gong.

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,620
It's his time to gain fame.

15
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,820
How dare you stop me, son?

16
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,820
Is it possible to keep HeMS

17
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,300
and 148 economy every day to assist your fleet?

18
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,260

Achieve and become garrzen.

00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,260
Achieve and become Ni Xiu.

21
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,580
At one point,

22
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,420
we were

23
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:31,860
determined to菜 Strike it all.

24
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,540
Have them ready?

25
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,180
The domination of him

26
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:36,140
became clear so quickly.

27
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,900
You are village chief,

28
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,940
why to make such a decision?

29
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:44,820
Eunuch Han,

30
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,740
our he is under the air management of Wanyu.

31
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,740
Please call him out

32
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,100
and have some check in.

33
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:58,540
I will take care of the He Xiaowei of the Cui family.

34
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,540
How could you do that?

35
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:04,540
My Cui family has been in the city of Bingzhou.

36
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,540
If you insist on arresting someone,

37
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,540
don't blame me for entering the city.

38
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,540
Han,

39
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:13,540
this is your fault.

40
00:03:13,540 --> 00:03:15,540
You are against the Cui family

41
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,540
because you are so loyal to the army.

42
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:20,540
Instead, you are against the Cui family.

43
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,540
If you are so loyal to the army,

44
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
I will report to the capital.

45
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,540
I saw what you said.

46
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:30,540
We have such a thing.

47
00:03:31,540 --> 00:03:34,540
We have never seen the He Xiaowei you said.

48
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,540
You can fool the Cui family,

49
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,540
but you can't fool me.

50
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,540
The rear-view guest room is 3-dimensional.

51
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:44,540
We can't even get close to the gold-fist position.

52
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:48,540
The Cui family's army must be there.

53
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:50,540
Let's go.

54
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:52,540
I will take you to the He Xiaowei.

55
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:54,540
Thank you.

56
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
No need.

57
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,540
I will ask the Cui family to come out.

58
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:19,540
Go.

59
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,540
Master.

60
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,540
How is it?

61
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:50,540
Can you hold it?

62
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,540
Master.

63
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,540
Master, why do you need it?

64
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:58,540
I just want to get you two to take the banquet.

65
00:04:58,540 --> 00:04:59,540
If you come to see the guest,

66
00:04:59,540 --> 00:05:01,540
you will be happy.

67
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,540
Dalu.

68
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:19,540
Master.

69
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,540
Master Cui is here.

70
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:50,540
Master.

71
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,540
You are so beautiful.

72
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,540
Today is the day of the banquet.

73
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:05,540
I am so lucky.

74
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,540
Master Cui.

75
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:11,540
This is the time of Dalu.

76
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,540
I am so glad to see you.

77
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,540
I am so glad to see you.

78
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:22,540
I have a good news.

79
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,540
Master.

80
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:30,540
The Cui family has thousands of people

81
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,540
outside of the city.

82
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,540
They are all here to see you.

83
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:37,540
The guest in the palace won't let me go out.

84
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,540
How about this?

85
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:42,540
Tell the army to kill them.

86
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,540
So that everyone can see

87
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,540
the power of the Cui family.

88
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,540
Master Cui misunderstood.

89
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:53,540
The city is busy with the food and the road is busy with the road.

90
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:56,540
It's not like I am in the palace to take the banquet.

91
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,540
I just want to keep you

92
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:02,540
in the palace for a few days.

93
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,540
Master Cui, please be more relaxed.

94
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:08,540
If Dulu knows that you are in the hospital,

95
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:12,540
he will send someone to escort you to the capital.

96
00:07:12,540 --> 00:07:15,540
The capital is a place of great prosperity.

97
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,540
Master Cui will be happy to be with you.

98
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,540
Wait.

99
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,540
I will take Dulu to the capital.

100
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,540
Master Cui is so reckless.

101
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:35,540
Can't you see Dulu?

102
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:37,540
I am so angry.

103
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:39,540
Master Cui loves the beauty.

104
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Master Cui loves the beauty.

105
00:07:41,540 --> 00:07:43,540
But he is too young to be happy.

106
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:45,540
I am the master of Dulu.

107
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:47,540
I am going out with Dulu.

108
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:49,540
You are so arrogant.

109
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:51,540
You want to rebel?

110
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:05,540
Don't be angry.

111
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,540
Do you have any idea?

112
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:11,540
This He's daughter is the one who is in love with Master Cui.

113
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,540
If so,

114
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:16,540
let this He's daughter, Ru Jingxing,

115
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:18,540
be the winner of Dulu.

116
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,540
What do you mean by that?

117
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,540
You are humiliating me, Master Cui.

118
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:23,540
She is injured.

119
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,540
She can't jump.

120
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:35,540
Why don't I help her today?

121
00:08:35,540 --> 00:08:38,540
I will give her a sword for Dulu.

122
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:40,540
Great.

123
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:44,540
You are so lucky today.

124
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,540
Come on.

125
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:47,540
Let's go.

126
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,540
No need.

127
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:52,540
How about the sword of Han Palace?

128
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,540
Master Cui doesn't know that

129
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,540
Han's sword is a gentleman's sword.

130
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:00,540
It's not open.

131
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,540
It's okay.

132
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,540
I am just a sword.

133
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:06,540
It's not a murderer.

134
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:12,540
Master Cui is so talkative.

135
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:22,540
Master Cui gave me a sword.

136
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:25,540
I will sing for you.

137
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:30,540
No one can be unworthy of Master Cui.

138
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:38,540
Master Cui, please.

139
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,540
Master Cui.

140
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,540
Master Cui.

141
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:06,540
Master Cui.

142
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,540
Master Cui.

143
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,540
Master Cui.

144
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:40,540
I will sing for you.

145
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:46,540
You are just a gentleman.

146
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:00,540
Master Cui.

147
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
Yes.

148
00:13:02,540 --> 00:13:05,540
Kill.

149
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,540
You are so far away.

150
00:13:14,540 --> 00:13:17,540
Master Cui, you are so talkative.

151
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:23,540
You are so talkative.

152
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,540
I am so happy to sing for you.

153
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,540
Now, you know that

154
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,540
you are here.

155
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:39,540
Master, if you fall into Master Cui's hands,

156
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:41,540
it will be hard for you to escape.

157
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:47,540
I am afraid that you will be in trouble.

158
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:49,540
We know about the poison of Han Palace.

159
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:52,540
But your master Cui is so cunning.

160
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,540
He doesn't want to go out.

161
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,540
He is giving us the difficult question.

162
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,540
You are joking.

163
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,540
If we kill Sun Jing,

164
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:03,540
you can let us go.

165
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:07,540
If I take the promise of Han Palace,

166
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,540
you will be fooled by me.

167
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:16,540
But if you kill the time,

168
00:14:16,540 --> 00:14:19,540
how can you go back?

169
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,540
As for you,

170
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,540
please return to your home for a few days.

171
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:25,540
You can take the army of Cui to the imperial palace

172
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:29,540
and I will definitely return it to you.

173
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:36,540
Han Palace,

174
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,540
the flowers are good and the flowers are good.

175
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:39,540
You are lucky.

176
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:41,540
Are you happy to take the promise of your life?

177
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:42,540
Let him go.

178
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:44,540
Of course.

179
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,540
You are injured.

180
00:14:47,540 --> 00:14:49,540
You must find the doctor to take care of it.

181
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,540
Don't leave the illness.

182
00:14:55,540 --> 00:14:57,540
Let's go. I will send you off.

183
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,540
Thank you.

184
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:21,540
Your hairpin.

185
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,540
You are my good friend.

186
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:30,540
If he is gone,

187
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:32,540
I wonder if someone will cry for me.

188
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:36,540
I won't cry.

189
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:58,540
Two, two, three,

190
00:15:58,540 --> 00:16:01,540
two, two,

191
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,540
two, one,

192
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:19,540
Ying.

193
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,540
Lord.

194
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
What happened to your foot?

195
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:22,540
It's nothing.

196
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,540
It's just a small injury.

197
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,340
You're on time.

198
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,740
Till the suit wears down.

199
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,540
Get undressed first.

200
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,900
I'll give you more honor.

201
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:36,100
Are you about to die?

202
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,980
It's a bit confusing,

203
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:39,620
I don't want to lose them,

204
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,460
so I'm not looking for that.

205
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:41,900
Too bad,

206
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,940
you brought Elixir quality ancient 로,

207
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,500
but it doesn't matter.

208
00:16:46,020 --> 00:16:46,980
Let me be your doctor.

209
00:16:47,260 --> 00:16:48,340
No, crown prince.

210
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060
We'll lose them if we lose them.

211
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,060
Are you tired?

212
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,580
We'll go get some rest.

213
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:53,900
I ordered a table food,

214
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:55,100
How do I know?

215
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:56,700
The hairpin I went to

216
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,580
is gone.

217
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,540
You're lying.

218
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,020
That hairpin

219
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:02,860
was left by her mother.

220
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:05,060
Even if she lost her life,

221
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,660
she wouldn't have lost that hairpin.

222
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:08,940
Did you hide something from her?

223
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,500
No.

224
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:11,220
I did.

225
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,420
The hairpin is so annoying.

226
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,860
I stopped her from going back to find it.

227
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,940
It's too dangerous.

228
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:18,220
I'm not lying.

229
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,900
The hairpin is gone.

230
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,340
Look.

231
00:17:30,580 --> 00:17:31,540
It's so pretty.

232
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,020
Can you put it back on?

233
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,140
Yes.

234
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:35,860
Yes.

235
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,460
You're so good.

236
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,180
It won't fall.

237
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,900
It won't fall.

238
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,700
It won't.

239
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:40,780
It won't fall.

240
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,660
It won't fall.

241
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,260
Look.

242
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,340
It's so high and round.

243
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,060
It's so high.

244
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,900
It's so high.

245
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:49,700
Put it back on.

246
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,900
It's up.

247
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:56,660
It's up.

248
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:57,340
It's up.

249
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,500
It won't fall, right?

250
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,220
It won't.

251
00:17:59,220 --> 00:18:00,220
It won't.

252
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,300
It's so high.

253
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:01,820
It's up.

254
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,540
It's up.

255
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,020
It's so high.

256
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:08,620
It's up.

257
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,460
It's up.

258
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,620
It's up.

259
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,420
It's up.

260
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,100
It's up.

261
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:13,820
Wait.

262
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,460
Be careful.

263
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,020
Let's go.

264
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,180
Hey.

265
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,220
It's you.

266
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:35,580
Mixing things like that

267
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:35,960
and putting them in

268
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,980
is no it.

269
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:39,780
Just

270
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:46,440
my Purple

271
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,320
值.

272
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,420
That's good!

273
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:53,540
Well.

274
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,780
I am thinking of going to a kindergarten.

275
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,260
So Iowment.

276
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:07,780
What are you doing?

277
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,860
My petrified niet巨頭

278
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,700
is of the

279
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,420
🍦 Kelan royal chi.

280
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,320
So I can only call

281
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:19,780
you the winner ofthis bet.

282
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,660
Please turn me on.

283
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,740
Are you Okay?

284
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,300
Are you hurt?

285
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:28,980
I'm fine.

286
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:31,140
I'm very very worried.

287
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:44,780
She is acting here!

288
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,780
Is it because of the Mr Ban Maid,

289
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,140
or just a nanny?

290
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,220
You should really think

291
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:51,740
and think of what else I can do.

292
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,180
That's amazing!

293
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,500
Your Highness,

294
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:57,580
Madam Wei is so orbiting around you.

295
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,580
Your Highness is feeling awkward.

296
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,780
Why do you

297
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,220
불�rt Dan...

298
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,900
Could you think of giving some tools

299
00:20:06,060 --> 00:20:06,900
for?'

300
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,460
Then you should borrow a 추천 from Madam Wei.

301
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:17,780
You should compensate her

302
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,100
for making such a big deal.

303
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:57,740
You don't know what your mind won't speak.

304
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,280
What is it?

305
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,180
No need.

306
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,500
It's just a CT for your instrument.

307
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,180
Xiao Wei.

308
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:22,840
Tell me

309
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:23,680
Fine.

310
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,600
But we still have to keep going

311
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,000
the next few days.

312
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:27,960
Otherwise,

313
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:29,280
it's not good to leave the ice cream.

314
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,080
Okay.

315
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:30,960
I'll listen to you.

316
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:33,400
By the way, Taozi.

317
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:34,640
This time,

318
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,760
I met that royal grandson Li Ni.

319
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,920
He was the one

320
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:40,680
who wanted to kill himself in the village.

321
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,200
It was him?

322
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,080
Didn't you tell me

323
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,400
that Li Ni was the prince of the Western Army?

324
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,720
He must be a grasshopper in the medical room.

325
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:51,600
Taozi.

326
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,040
I thought it over.

327
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,400
He's a good man.

328
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,400
He's very capable.

329
00:21:57,520 --> 00:21:58,520
He's very smart.

330
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:01,160
But we can't lose our innocence.

331
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,400
I didn't expect

332
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,760
that Li Ni

333
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:08,200
has such a outstanding son.

334
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
He's never heard of it before.

335
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,200
How is he so good?

336
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,360
He's smarter than us.

337
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:20,680
You're so sweet.

338
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,880
What did you eat

339
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:22,920
when I was gone?

340
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,960
They made pig's feet for me.

341
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
I didn't expect

342
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,720
that Mr. Cui is a very affectionate person.

343
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:31,640
He's always watching

344
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:33,160
her leave.

345
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:35,560
He's so modest.

346
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:37,720
He's so sweet.

347
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,000
A young hero

348
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,680
can't be affectionate.

349
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:45,680
Master.

350
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,080
Master.

351
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,440
I'm here to send you a letter.

352
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:49,880
It's written by Mr. Cui.

353
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:52,120
Mr. Cui?

354
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,320
He's not in our mansion.

355
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:58,120
Go.

356
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,240
Yes.

357
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:14,080
Young Master, Xiao Wei is here.

358
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,240
young master.

359
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:18,480
Young master,

360
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,360
we were in the manor and now

361
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,320
you areDoesn't feel good.

362
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,600
Understood.

363
00:23:28,280 --> 00:23:30,080
I'm not going because from a few days ago

364
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,040
Iood microbes in my soldiers

365
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:32,520
are causing a Strong Disruptivemented Golden Ne harness.

366
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:33,480
According toET,

367
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,400
it was affected by poison.

368
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,120
I've recorded.

369
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,280
Didn't you say

370
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:40,760
Great Master Youளin is said to be soldiers of consorts?

371
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:43,160
they can't get close to each other anymore.

372
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,680
As for the Western capital,

373
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,080
it's even more unbearable.

374
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,160
You're right.

375
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,320
I agree.

376
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:50,720
I think that

377
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
since the army is in the hands of the people,

378
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,080
it's better to attack the Zhou State.

379
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:55,120
As long as the Zhou State is in the hands of the people,

380
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,760
whether it's the Sun Jing or the Li Royal Descendant,

381
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,600
we must all look at the colors of our Cui family.

382
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:02,000
Young Master,

383
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,320
I've seen the Li Royal Descendant this time.

384
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,440
The Qin people

385
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,560
can't be laughed at.

386
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,400
It's not a joke.

387
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,800
And it's the opponent of the Han sword.

388
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:15,320
We must be careful.

389
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:17,240
What kind of person is he?

390
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,320
How can you say such a thing?

391
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,760
Although he's great,

392
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,640
we can't

393
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,960
take the Zhou State.

394
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:36,520
The army is in the hands of the people.

395
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,000
What's your plan?

396
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,040
Can you attack the Zhou State?

397
00:24:39,800 --> 00:24:41,040
Isn't the general Pei

398
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:42,080
in the Wang State?

399
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:43,440
Why don't we

400
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:44,800
go and save him first?

401
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,200
But we've been in contact with the Western army.

402
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,920
It's because of the military provisions.

403
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,160
We've just had a fight.

404
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:51,320
I'm worried

405
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,480
that they won't be able to

406
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:53,360
join hands with us easily.

407
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:54,640
Even if they do,

408
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,560
I'm afraid they'll be suspicious.

409
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,360
Don't worry, Young Master.

410
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,840
I have a way

411
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,360
to let them agree to join hands with us.

412
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:02,400
I also have a way

413
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,120
to make them not dare to be suspicious.

414
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,120
logs

415
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:07,340
heard

416
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:08,440
You killed my father.

417
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,320
You!

418
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:11,860
Who put processor on theして he killer?

419
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,240
What's wrong?

420
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:13,600
Master.

421
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,220
Please.

422
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:25,520
Go�

423
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:27,460
After

424
00:25:27,460 --> 00:25:28,160
Then we all

425
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,960
bring people up to murder.

426
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:30,680
Yes.

427
00:25:31,720 --> 00:25:32,360
No.

428
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:33,620
Let him be killed.

429
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:35,280
What's there to say?

430
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:38,200
Han Gong, I'm not hiding it.

431
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,360
I'm the one who's trying to seduce you.

432
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,680
I'm ordered to

433
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,680
discuss something important with you.

434
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:46,080
Zeng Liu,

435
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,080
I think Han Gong is your son.

436
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:50,280
I can only make a mistake

437
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,120
if I try to do it in the Imperial Court.

438
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,880
But I don't lie to Han Gong.

439
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,280
I was born and raised in the Cui family.

440
00:25:58,800 --> 00:25:59,720
But I didn't expect that

441
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,160
they would betray me today.

442
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,840
I didn't expect that they would be my wife.

443
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,160
Since you know that you're my wife,

444
00:26:11,160 --> 00:26:12,520
what else do you need?

445
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,160
Han Gong,

446
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,160
since you're not from the Cui family,

447
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,680
I'm not tired of it.

448
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,360
I have a plan.

449
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,760
I can see Han Gong as beautiful as possible.

450
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:26,560
I know that

451
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,560
the Cui family used to

452
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:28,760
marry Zeng Xi Jun's Liu.

453
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,800
Zeng Xi Jun is short of power.

454
00:26:31,280 --> 00:26:33,520
He's also a traitor to the Cui family.

455
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,120
Han Gong should send people to Wangzhou

456
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,120
to discuss with Li Huan Sun.

457
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:39,600
The two armies

458
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:41,080
killed the Cui family.

459
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:42,800
Han Gong is the only one

460
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,280
who can take care of Zeng Xi Jun.

461
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:50,400
Master,

462
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,000
he's right.

463
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,000
Our spy

464
00:26:56,200 --> 00:26:58,520
also reported to Jieling.

465
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:00,680
I'm just a person

466
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:01,920
who's been abandoned by the Cui family.

467
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,120
I have nothing.

468
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:05,920
Only Han Gong

469
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,800
can give me a chance.

470
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,560
Han Gong should send people

471
00:27:10,560 --> 00:27:11,880
to talk about Zeng Xi Jun's face.

472
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:13,960
As for me,

473
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,000
Han Gong is going to kill me.

474
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:17,240
It's not a good idea.

475
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,240
If Zeng Xi Jun doesn't let go,

476
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,240
Han Gong will kill my sister.

477
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:22,040
I'm not going to be late.

478
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,440
If this plan works,

479
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,360
I'm willing to follow Han Gong

480
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,640
just like Han Gong

481
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,320
and accept Han Gong's death.

482
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:30,960
I will

483
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,000
do my job myself.

484
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:37,360
Go.

485
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,640
Fill their carrot later.

486
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,880
We'll set fire to the boss.

487
00:27:56,360 --> 00:28:06,000
The

488
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:06,280
Simayo

489
00:28:06,280 --> 00:28:07,040
Emily

490
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:08,400
嚕十七郎

491
00:28:18,380 --> 00:28:20,560
Can addition

492
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,220
for

493
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:23,920
scouting

494
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:25,280
tax

495
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,320
calendar

496
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:27,800
in the Hanli Mansion in Bingshou.

497
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
What is she doing there?

498
00:28:30,680 --> 00:28:31,760
I kept asking her,

499
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,880
but she refused to tell me.

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,320
She said she would meet you in person

501
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,520
and report to the police.

502
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,960
Meet me in person?

503
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,520
Who?

504
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,400
She is a very fierce girl.

505
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,440
She is a good girl.

506
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,320
She knows how to fight and how to fight.

507
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:45,760
She is very powerful.

508
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,920
Greetings, General Pei.

509
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:51,880
Please excuse me.

510
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,280
My He Xiaowei asked me to meet you.

511
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,160
The Xia Luo of Li Huangsun

512
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,440
is a gift from our Cui's family

513
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,520
to General Pei.

514
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:04,880
It is to show the sincerity of our Cui's family.

515
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,160
It is said that

516
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:08,120
Li Huangsun and our He Xiaowei

517
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,560
are very close friends.

518
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:10,880
Before that,

519
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,040
our He Xiaowei saved Li Huangsun a few times.

520
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,240
This time,

521
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:15,800
he didn't want to see her die.

522
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,520
So our Cui's family

523
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,320
is willing to join hands with General Pei

524
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,920
and help Li Huangsun.

525
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,160
Really?

526
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,320
My He Xiaowei said that

527
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,720
if I say so,

528
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:32,120
General Pei will not believe it.

529
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,560
But you can ask someone

530
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,160
to go to Banzhou City to investigate.

531
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:36,960
You will know

532
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,720
whether we are telling the truth or not.

533
00:29:39,040 --> 00:29:40,040
General Pei.

534
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:40,960
Yes.

535
00:29:49,040 --> 00:29:50,640
Our He Xiaowei also said

536
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,480
that if I arrive at the right time,

537
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,800
then at this time,

538
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,440
Banzhou City, Hanli Residence

539
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,880
will also ask someone to come

540
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,120
to discuss something important

541
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,720
with General Pei.

542
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,960
I wonder

543
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:02,680
if Hanli is coming.

544
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:05,640
Why are you so evil?

545
00:30:07,480 --> 00:30:09,800
Hanli Residence really is asking someone to come?

546
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,160
Yes.

547
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:16,880
Look.

548
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:19,640
Our He Xiaowei is not suspicious.

549
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:26,680
Hot.

550
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,280
We meet again.

551
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:37,240
I bring many people to save you.

552
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:38,600
And Son Okui?

553
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:39,320
Li Haoka.

554
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:40,920
Go on.

555
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:47,800
Mrs. Yang.

556
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,200
I do not know what happened to me.

557
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:53,640
I feel unwell.

558
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:54,640
I'll go back now.

559
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,640
Go back now.

560
00:30:57,640 --> 00:30:58,640
Okay.

561
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,640
Xiao Wei,

562
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,640
do you really think

563
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:07,640
you can join hands?

564
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:11,640
I've seen

565
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,640
the smartest and most cunning

566
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:14,640
in the Yuan Shuai's etiquette.

567
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,640
Even if you lock him up

568
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,640
with a iron chain,

569
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:19,640
put him in the box,

570
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,640
tie him up,

571
00:31:20,640 --> 00:31:21,640
and then put him in the river.

572
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:23,640
With a single eye of skill,

573
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:25,640
he can take out the box

574
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,640
and then hang you up in the toilet.

575
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,640
Such a smart person

576
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:31,640
can certainly make a deal.

577
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,640
Then why do you bet

578
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,640
that Li Huangsun

579
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,640
will definitely persuade Han Li

580
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:38,640
to go to the park?

581
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:41,640
The best etiquette

582
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:42,640
is to escape from death.

583
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:44,640
I've already calculated it.

584
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,640
He will definitely persuade Han Li

585
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,640
to set up another trap for Han Li.

586
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,640
If that's the case,

587
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:50,640
why don't we

588
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:51,640
use his trick

589
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,640
to make our own army?

590
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,640
You really have some skills.

591
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:58,640
Peiyuan actually agreed

592
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,640
to join the army

593
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:01,640
of the Cui family

594
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
in front and back of our country.

595
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:04,640
However,

596
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
he has a condition.

597
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,640
Besides the Cui family's

598
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,640
provisions and provisions,

599
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:12,640
he also needs to

600
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
go to the south of Jianzhou.

601
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,640
To be honest,

602
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,640
if Peiyuan doesn't mention

603
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,640
any condition,

604
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,640
I don't want to believe

605
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,640
Han Gong's reaction.

606
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:24,640
Since Peiyuan mentioned the condition,

607
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:26,640
I think

608
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:28,640
there are eight possibilities.

609
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,640
Tell me.

610
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,640
Han Gong can fake the plan

611
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,640
and agree to join the army.

612
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,640
Jianzhou is a dangerous city.

613
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
The army in Han Gong's hands

614
00:32:40,640 --> 00:32:42,640
can take the city to the enemy.

615
00:32:43,640 --> 00:32:44,640
But the Xi army

616
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,640
entered the Xia Luo Valley.

617
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,640
Since we're in the same army,

618
00:32:51,640 --> 00:32:53,640
we can break into the Xi army.

619
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:55,640
We can break into the Xi army

620
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,640
in front of the Cui family

621
00:32:58,640 --> 00:32:59,640
and in the back.

622
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:01,640
I'm afraid it's the Sun Dado

623
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:02,640
who is far away in the capital.

624
00:33:03,640 --> 00:33:04,640
It's hard to get along with Han Gong.

625
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:11,640
Have you read the military books?

626
00:33:13,640 --> 00:33:14,640
I'm the classmate of Mr. Cui.

627
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:16,640
I'm good at writing,

628
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,640
and I'm good at planning.

629
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,640
I've learned it all.

630
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,640
Not bad.

631
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,640
You're a talent.

632
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:27,640
Han Gong passed away.

633
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:28,640
He's in a mess.

634
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,640
He only wants to live a peaceful life.

635
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,640
I want to

636
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:34,640
be like a horse for Han Gong.

637
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:38,640
I have to

638
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,640
take your position.

639
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I'll leave you to live in the prison.

640
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:46,640
I'll really

641
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,640
break into the Xi army.

642
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:50,640
I'll let you out right away.

643
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
I'll let you be my witness.

644
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Thank you, Han Gong.

645
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,640
Why do you feel weird

646
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,640
when you mention Li Huangsun?

647
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,640
Why?

648
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:05,640
You seem to hate him.

649
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:06,640
You're a bit arrogant.

650
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Isn't that so?

651
00:34:09,640 --> 00:34:10,640
Why would I save him

652
00:34:10,640 --> 00:34:11,640
if I did?

653
00:34:16,640 --> 00:34:17,640
Such an interesting person.

654
00:34:18,640 --> 00:34:19,640
It's a pity that he's dead.

655
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,640
I know.

656
00:34:25,640 --> 00:34:26,640
I've never heard

657
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:27,640
you say that.

658
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,640
I've never heard

659
00:34:29,640 --> 00:34:30,640
that you're the opponent.

660
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:32,640
Who's the opponent?

661
00:34:33,640 --> 00:34:34,640
Sir.

662
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:40,640
It's okay.

663
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,640
I'm chatting with Taozi.

664
00:34:42,640 --> 00:34:43,640
Aying.

665
00:34:43,640 --> 00:34:44,640
I have something for you.

666
00:34:44,640 --> 00:34:45,640
I want to give it to you.

667
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,640
The hairpin your mother left for you.

668
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:49,640
I know

669
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:51,640
it must be very sad.

670
00:34:52,640 --> 00:34:53,640
Look.

671
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,640
Doesn't it look like the original one?

672
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,640
It really does.

673
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,640
I made it myself.

674
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,640
Here.

675
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,640
I'll put it on for you.

676
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,640
Sir.

677
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,640
The original hairpin

678
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:12,640
has different meanings for me.

679
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:15,640
Even if it looks like it,

680
00:35:15,640 --> 00:35:16,640
I don't want to

681
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,640
replace it with other ones.

682
00:35:21,640 --> 00:35:22,640
Thank you for your kindness.

683
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
I'll take this one.

684
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:29,640
Okay.

685
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:36,640
Aying.

686
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:38,640
Don't think

687
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,640
I don't know

688
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,640
what you're doing.

689
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
After I leave,

690
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:45,640
I'll find you a new one.

691
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
Mr. Han told me to come to see you.

692
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:05,640
I'm afraid you'll be wronged here.

693
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,640
Thank you, Mr. Han.

694
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,640
Thank you, Mr. Lv.

695
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:09,640
It's okay.

696
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,640
I'm the wife of Cui Jiajun.

697
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,640
I'm grateful to Mr. Han

698
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:15,640
for keeping me alive.

699
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:16,640
He's willing to listen to me.

700
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,640
He's not too grateful.

701
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:19,640
He's not too happy.

702
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,640
Okay.

703
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:24,640
I know you're a generous person.

704
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,640
I've brought you a good wine today.

705
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:27,640
Let's drink.

706
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:37,640
It's so good.

707
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,640
Mr. Han's wife

708
00:36:39,640 --> 00:36:41,640
is so good.

709
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,640
It makes sense.

710
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,640
Let's drink.

711
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:06,640
Pass the order.

712
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,640
Attack the city.

713
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,640
What's the matter?

714
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:09,640
We're going out at night.

715
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:11,640
We're even more excited than last time.

716
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,640
San, have you ever been excited?

717
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:15,640
I'm excited.

718
00:37:15,640 --> 00:37:17,640
You're still playing with me.

719
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,640
Take the order.

720
00:37:19,640 --> 00:37:20,640
Attack.

721
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:33,640
I'll send someone to check.

722
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:34,640
Go.

723
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,640
Yes.

724
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:45,640
Let's drink this wine first.

725
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:47,640
We've offended you before.

726
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,640
Please teach us more.

727
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:50,640
Please.

728
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:57,640
Good wine.

729
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:01,640
I mean,

730
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,640
we've been together for days.

731
00:38:05,640 --> 00:38:08,640
But we're not sure about it.

732
00:38:09,640 --> 00:38:11,640
I'm just not sure.

733
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Who are you and who are you?

734
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:14,640
Why are you here?

735
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:16,640
What's the reason

736
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,640
for your marriage?

737
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:19,640
Come on.

738
00:38:19,640 --> 00:38:20,640
Listen.

739
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:22,640
Well,

740
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,640
it's a long story.

741
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:28,640
I have to wait for a while.

742
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
What's the matter?

743
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
I have to wait for a while.

744
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:42,640
What's the matter?

745
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,640
I can tell you now.

746
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,640
My name is Lin Yi.

747
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,640
I'm 17 years old.

748
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:21,640
I'm the son of the late emperor and the son of the king.

749
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,640
I'm the heir of the Western Army.

750
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:28,640
I'm the one who killed the emperor and the emperor.

751
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:30,640
Remember me.

752
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:12,640
I'm sorry.

753
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,640
I'm sorry.

754
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:12,640
I'm sorry.

755
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm sorry.
