00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,260
Shi Jie

00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:04,980
The Story of Wang linear

00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,740
Un kun

00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:19,960
Ann pozi

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:25,020
Go

6
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:34,020
I chase after waves, my night passes by, and the night falls into the river

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:44,020
I want to look at the mirror of the dark universe, the sky is long

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:54,020
When the encounter is parting, when the encounter is far away, I will never forget

9
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:03,020
Maidenuntained, mount the evening shadows, to the lands of the wind

10
00:01:03,020 --> 00:01:12,020
Bride- pies in the wind, the otter understandable,ees the full moon

11
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:21,020
The moment shows that you must arrive, and find out where you are

12
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,460
either speak or die.

13
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:42,120
The Soul of slaughter

14
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,140
Episode 21

15
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,620
Back then,BC péri the astronomical

16
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,620
Brother Huang,

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:53,300
Brother Chao, let's drink.

18
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,060
I didn't expect that.

19
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,700
Erduo,

20
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,180
are you hurt?

21
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,500
You should drink more.

22
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:11,980
Come on.

23
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:13,820
Let's toast to the old man.

24
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,860
Cheers to the old man.

25
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:20,700
I'm sorry.

26
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,380
Actually,

27
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:25,060
when His Highness hasn't woken up,

28
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,180
I saw Miss Cui's calmness.

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,980
She was very impressed.

30
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,180
And,

31
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:32,300
especially Miss Taozi.

32
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,180
If you weren't with His Highness,

33
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,100
and you were always with her,

34
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,540
His Highness wouldn't know

35
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:37,460
when she would wake up.

36
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,740
Actually,

37
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,860
it's thanks to the prescription they prescribed,

38
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:42,860
it's very correct.

39
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,260
But,

40
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,700
they're not very experienced

41
00:02:45,700 --> 00:02:46,780
in treatment.

42
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:49,300
Fortunately, the medicine in the palace

43
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:50,460
is very good.

44
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,620
Otherwise,

45
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,780
I'm afraid that His Highness won't wake up so soon.

46
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:56,340
Actually, this time,

47
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,460
I have something to ask Miss Taozi.

48
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:01,100
General Pei,

49
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,900
please say no.

50
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,900
I think Miss Taozi

51
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,740
should persuade Miss Cui

52
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,020
to persuade His Highness.

53
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:14,300
The court officials

54
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,020
think that His Highness is the Crown Prince.

55
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:19,940
But His Highness is not.

56
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,540
Prince Qin, Prince Qi,

57
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,100
is in the dark.

58
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,380
The court is in a fight.

59
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:25,780
The court officials are worried.

60
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:30,020
But I know her.

61
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:32,420
She wants to go back to the old place.

62
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,620
But if she doesn't become the Crown Prince now,

63
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm afraid that she will be in trouble.

64
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,660
It's hard to get her out of the world.

65
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,620
General Pei's hard work

66
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,180
is clear to me.

67
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,260
But,

68
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:53,580
Miss Cui has a special idea.

69
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,740
I can't tell her

70
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,420
what happened just now.

71
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:00,100
The most important thing is that

72
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,860
these are

73
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:04,300
the things that Prince Qin and Miss Cui

74
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:05,220
have to deal with.

75
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,180
What do you think?

76
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,420
General Pei,

77
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:12,660
actually, I've discussed with Taozi.

78
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:14,540
There are some things

79
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:16,620
between the 17th Prince and Miss Cui.

80
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,660
We won't talk about it again.

81
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,820
It seems that Taozi and I have some things.

82
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:27,300
We won't talk to them again.

83
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,860
I'm the one who's pregnant.

84
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,340
Drink.

85
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:48,740
Go.

86
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:50,060
Really?

87
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:51,700
Yes.

88
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,120
No,

89
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:54,160
I'm just refreshing my friends.

90
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,540
Мilky.

91
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,440
It's okay.

92
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,640
Why didn't you let me do it?

93
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,460
Should I bring Joseph?

94
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,900
Did you say you need to be serious?

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,020
It doesn't work.

96
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,440
Go to the arm's foot first.

97
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,560
I won't go in.

98
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:21,240
I haven't been to the Qingyun Temple.

99
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,880
I want to have a meal with you.

100
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:49,600
Greetings to you, myrobe man.

101
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,640
Your Royal Highness, please take a seat.

102
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,640
I thin

103
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,120
I was positive to

104
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,120
I think the real person has known it.

105
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,400
Prince of Xin and Prince of Qi

106
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,200
really didn't expect to be so heartless.

107
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:26,280
Fortunately, Your Majesty and His Highness

108
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,040
are safe and sound.

109
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,960
I promised the real person

110
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
to persuade my father to make the choice.

111
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,960
This is a matter of time.

112
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,600
I trust His Highness

113
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:47,240
to entrust you with the crown prince.

114
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:50,560
You are a humble person.

115
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,760
So you came to see me today.

116
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,200
Actually, you are already aware of it.

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,440
Your Highness

118
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,200
is afraid that

119
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,280
you will be the crown prince.

120
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,080
Now, the court is in a bad mood.

121
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,320
You are the son of the Crown Prince.

122
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,920
He has no power now.

123
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,760
So he is very stubborn.

124
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,080
I also understand that

125
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,560
you are in the mood

126
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,320
to be the crown prince.

127
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,920
Just like I didn't want to be the crown princess

128
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:36,040
that day.

129
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,920
But I wanted to be the crown prince

130
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:40,040
who was happy and happy.

131
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,320
Staying in this world

132
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,040
is the best thing

133
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,360
in my life.

134
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,800
Worth scorn quickly

135
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,440
when it comes face to face.

136
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,560
No.

137
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,960
Just do you not believe it?

138
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,520
There are lots of things in the world

139
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,760
that enclosed life

140
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,080
and are not sustainable in love.

141
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,440
I beg you,

142
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,720
will god like you

143
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
fall in love often?

144
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,280
I know you're poor.

145
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,120
You can't say it.

146
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,960
You can't even speak it out.

147
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,560
Dry lima.

148
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,860
Gain Shosa skill!

149
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:49,440
Don't play with出家,

150
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,040
and practice heartbreak.

151
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,840
Dièreshing!

152
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:54,240
Does that mean

153
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,060
you've become a charlo partner?

154
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,060
Put yourself in danger.

155
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,760
Xiaozi,

156
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:09,880
let us walk together,

157
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:14,040
Chen Xiao, are you okay?

158
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,040
I'm sorry for making you feel wronged.

159
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,040
I'm sorry for making you feel wronged, child.

160
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,040
I'm sorry.

161
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,040
I'm sorry.

162
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:30,040
I'm sorry.

163
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,040
I'm sorry.

164
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,040
I don't want to leave you.

165
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:39,040
I won't leave you.

166
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,040
I won't leave you.

167
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:45,040
Don't cry.

168
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,040
I won't.

169
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:51,040
I won't leave you.

170
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I won't leave you.

171
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,040
So, the magic of the Qingyun Temple looks like this.

172
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,040
Your Highness.

173
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,040
I'm so grateful for your help.

174
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:14,040
I'm here to escort you.

175
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,040
Your Highness, you're safe and sound.

176
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,040
You're welcome, General Han.

177
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,040
It's the ceremony.

178
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:24,040
I'm grateful for your kindness.

179
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,040
General Han,

180
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,040
you can really help me in the Qing family.

181
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,040
Yes.

182
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:49,040
I've been a great general

183
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
who only wanted to be a great general.

184
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,040
He's a great general who only wants to be a great general.

185
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,040
He can be heard by his enemies

186
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
outside the country.

187
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,040
He can be heard by his enemies outside the country.

188
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:04,040
I'm glad to hear that.

189
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,040
I'm glad to hear that.

190
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,040
Actually, I know

191
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,040
that Old Lan Guan can't go back.

192
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,040
I saw my brothers betraying their father.

193
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,040
Actually,

194
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:25,040
they're all under the ambition of power

195
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:28,040
and the ambition of being unable to control.

196
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,040
I've always wanted to go back to Old Lan Guan.

197
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
Now I understand.

198
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:42,040
I don't want to go back to Old Lan Guan.

199
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:47,040
I want to go back to the simple,

200
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:51,040
not-so-fun and happy days.

201
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:55,040
I know that

202
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,040
once I become the Crown Prince,

203
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,040
I'm afraid I'll have to do many things that are not appropriate.

204
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:04,040
A person with a clear mind

205
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,040
and a Crown Prince

206
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,040
will have to take different responsibilities.

207
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,040
I didn't know that

208
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,040
I knew it or not.

209
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,040
I just don't want to admit it.

210
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:23,040
My mother has been dead for a long time.

211
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:26,040
I don't want anything.

212
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,040
I just want to go back to the days

213
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,040
when my mother was still around.

214
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,040
Ying,

215
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,040
I actually understand.

216
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,040
You and I are both in the same boat.

217
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:43,040
We're all the same.

218
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:46,040
We all want peace in the world.

219
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,040
The people are no longer in the inn.

220
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,040
The civil servants are clear-minded.

221
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:55,040
The martial arts are not dead.

222
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,040
Everyone

223
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,040
can have a good life.

224
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
Everyone can have a good life.

225
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,040
It's a choice to make.

226
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,040
Yes.

227
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:10,040
It's impossible to be a loyal person.

228
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,040
If he goes out,

229
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:16,040
to the Qing Dynasty,

230
00:14:18,040 --> 00:14:20,040
there will be a long time.

231
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,040
In the years to come,

232
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,040
my father

233
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,040
can't take care of the world.

234
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,040
Since no one is in charge,

235
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,040
I'll take care of it myself.

236
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,040
Zhao Jia Village

237
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:47,040
They can't go back to the old house.

238
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
But the world needs to have a Zhao Jia Village.

239
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,040
There are thousands of thousands of girls.

240
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,040
There are thousands of thousands of people

241
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,040
who are in a war.

242
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:00,040
They are separated.

243
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,040
They are parents and children.

244
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,040
I'll go back.

245
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:13,040
I'll go back to save the old man.

246
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,040
But I have a chance now.

247
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,040
I have a chance to save more people.

248
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
I want to save more people.

249
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:53,040
I want to save more people.

250
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:02,040
I'll go back.

251
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,040
I'll go back.

252
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,040
I'll go back.

253
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,040
I'll go back.

254
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,040
I'll go back.

255
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
I'll go back.

256
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,560
and sell her safe and money to avenge the corrected execution,

257
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:23,100
and build the house himself products and arrival in heaven

258
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:27,600
due to what the Crown Princeipherate

259
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,080
intends to ask for.

260
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,680
Now he's here

261
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:35,020
to respects honor and笨 거�

262
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,520
to attack us and protect us!

263
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:39,140
But there's nothing he can do!

264
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,600
How do we treat him?

265
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,480
We are Jack and AXin.

266
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,440
Now,

267
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,760
you have to investigate it,

268
00:16:58,840 --> 00:17:01,160
and consider everyone,

269
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:10,200
such as the deceased

270
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,640
and the deceased,

271
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:16,960
Mr. Zhao of Zhangbu jungle息此,

272
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,320
take this letter.

273
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,240
Your Majesty, you seem to be having a hard time.

274
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:23,800
Today, the Crown Prince

275
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:26,040
went out with Cui Shi again.

276
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,640
Many people saw it.

277
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,440
Now they regard him as a playboy.

278
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:42,560
Your Majesty, you are wise.

279
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,640
Today,

280
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,600
you indeed don't have to choose Cui Shi

281
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,640
as the Crown Prince.

282
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:49,640
You choose Cui Shi as the Crown Princess.

283
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:52,000
Cui family is a big family.

284
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,200
If you choose to choose the Crown Princess,

285
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,800
it's meaningless for Crown Prince

286
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:57,920
and the court.

287
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,000
In the future,

288
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,440
Your Majesty will surely be weak

289
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,600
to withdraw from the Cui family.

290
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,920
If you choose to choose the Crown Princess,

291
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:06,520
it will definitely be a great love.

292
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,400
You are right.

293
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,640
You are right.

294
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,360
Then,

295
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,760
if Iacions are not approved by you,

296
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:28,320
you need to play a female

297
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,080
who is very ט sieht well-known as the Crown Princess.

298
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:34,760
The day we performed acc deeds,

299
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,320
I saw Palm's eyes.

300
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,560
I felt Gu mother's price

301
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,920
was no wonder.

302
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,220
This is my顾相's daughter.

303
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:45,880
She looks away

304
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:47,920
because of me.

305
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:49,920
Good.

306
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:51,560
She's great.

307
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
Miss Sect 1960.

308
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:03,800
What's wrong?

309
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,240
Her Ladies rotten the Garden

310
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,680
into a fire with a subsequently annoying speech.

311
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,400
edeoth 對事

312
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,280
the Prince of Qin

313
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,440
and Miss Cui

314
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,520
were in the same boat.

315
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:15,160
The people in the world

316
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,360
are going to marry her.

317
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:17,640
Sometimes,

318
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,520
Miss Cui is so powerful.

319
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,760
She can kiss and dance.

320
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,760
Don't think about

321
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:24,080
the position of the Crown Princess Consort.

322
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,200
Besides,

323
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,320
when Miss Cui becomes the Crown Princess Consort,

324
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,680
she will look at your smile.

325
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,760
What do you mean?

326
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,920
I always remember your instructions.

327
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,840
I didn't dare to say anything.

328
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,360
I just left immediately.

329
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,480
That's all.

330
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,040
I'm just a group of women

331
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:44,760
who are so filial to me.

332
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,960
When you have the right to do something, you don't have to do it.

333
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,080
When you fail to do something, you don't have to do it.

334
00:19:50,560 --> 00:19:52,280
That's how you do it.

335
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,440
Besides,

336
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,680
the same situation with the Prince of Qin

337
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,160
is the true nature of the marriage.

338
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,600
If Miss Cui becomes the Crown Princess Consort,

339
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:04,400
it's okay.

340
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:07,960
But if the other person becomes the Crown Princess Consort,

341
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,960
it won't be a big joke.

342
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,800
You're right.

343
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,400
I'll just keep an eye on her.

344
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:20,160
I'll see if she can become the Crown Princess Consort.

345
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:29,880
Your Majesty,

346
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,440
remember to appoint the Crown Princess Consort

347
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:35,320
as the Crown Prince of the Crown Prince.

348
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:38,520
The Crown Prince of the Crown Prince will be the Crown Prince of the Crown Prince.

349
00:20:39,840 --> 00:20:40,760
I think

350
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,640
we shouldn't have chosen Liangyuan at this time.

351
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:43,680
Please let us in.

352
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,200
You're right.

353
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:50,160
It's not appropriate for us to choose Liangyuan at this time.

354
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:54,360
Let's first appoint the Crown Princess Consort.

355
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,120
I think the sixth daughter of the Gu family

356
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,480
is indeed outstanding.

357
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,480
She can be the Crown Princess Consort.

358
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:06,640
Your Majesty,

359
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm a good girl.

360
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:10,680
How can I admire the Crown Prince?

361
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:12,640
Your Majesty,

362
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,600
the daughter of Cui Yi is Cui Shi.

363
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,360
His Majesty has already appointed her as the Crown Princess Consort.

364
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,240
Now,

365
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:22,440
it's not appropriate for her to be the Crown Princess Consort, right?

366
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:25,040
I'm not sure.

367
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,320
Cui Yi is a crazy man.

368
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,040
He's written a letter

369
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:30,680
saying that he will choose a son

370
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,440
in the Crown Prince.

371
00:21:33,640 --> 00:21:35,240
I've never promised

372
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,800
that I will not object to the court's decision.

373
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:40,760
Moreover,

374
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,080
at this time,

375
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:46,040
I'm not appropriate to be the Crown Princess Consort.

376
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:47,680
Your Majesty,

377
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:50,680
I've already appointed 100,000 soldiers of the Cui family

378
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,080
to be the Crown Princess Consort.

379
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,640
You must not

380
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,800
make Cui Shi a Crown Princess Consort.

381
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:56,640
Otherwise,

382
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,600
you will be in trouble.

383
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,600
I agree.

384
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:04,360
You must not be the Crown Princess Consort.

385
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:06,560
I agree.

386
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,480
I agree.

387
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,280
I agree.

388
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,000
I agree.

389
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,400
I agree.

390
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,120
Your Majesty.

391
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,200
I think that

392
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,560
when we talk about marriage,

393
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,720
I don't have the right to accept the title of Crown Princess Consort.

394
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,280
I have the right to be the Crown Princess Consort.

395
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,320
It's hard to have the title of Crown Princess Consort.

396
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:33,120
But what about the title of Crown Princess Consort?

397
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,040
Hiding having a son

398
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:35,760
and making anESE

399
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:36,680
in a spinnig,

400
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:40,200
how can I say that your retain the title of Crown Princess Consort?

401
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,320
Your Majesty.

402
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,160
Crown Princess Consort

403
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,600
has already appointed 100,000 soldiers of the Kuomintang Collection

404
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,800
to be the Crown Princess Consort.

405
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,960
In the name of their ancestral cultural heritage!

406
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,680
Your Majesty.

407
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:54,520
Your Highness,

408
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,480
Crown Princess Consort marrying your early Emperor Her Majesty

409
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,000
has already appointed 100,000 oor of stronghold to the Chinese 12th simplicity.

410
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:03,240
A great honor for future generations!

411
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,200
Shaoqing.

412
00:23:08,520 --> 00:23:09,200
Have a try.

413
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:21,800
Why are you here so hurriedly

414
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:25,560
to have a bowl of tea and drinks with me?

415
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,840
Senior Sima.

416
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,280
Your Majesty and the temple

417
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,560
may be watching you.

418
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:42,760
Cuiyi is a general who was ot a general named Wei Yang.

419
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,800
Although he denkened

420
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:45,960
Yue and Suozhou Myrwno varities

421
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,840
Cuiyi's army is well-disposed.

422
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:51,280
Cuiyi is the master of every army.

423
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:53,000
After world war,

424
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,520
the imperial奈hflr

425
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,000
will have taken the advantage of the emperor's good度 as soon as possible.

426
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:58,520
microscopic 就可光

427
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:01,120
If this Cui Yi really becomes an outsider,

428
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,560
it will be hard to control him.

429
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,480
He will be a stranger.

430
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,480
General Pei told you to tell me?

431
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,320
No.

432
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,000
Father means

433
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,680
he doesn't want you to be in trouble.

434
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:14,840
But I think

435
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
we need to tell you

436
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,440
that we have the right to return.

437
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,160
I will think of a way.

438
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,120
Actually, you have seen it today.

439
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,600
All the officials in the court

440
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,000
are sitting here and thinking about it.

441
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
Even you think I shouldn't go to Ying.

442
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,680
Shi Qi Lang.

443
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,080
Actually, I know you.

444
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,720
You have been very close to Miss Cui.

445
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:41,640
But Shi Qi Lang,

446
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:45,080
if you really want to be the crown prince's concubine,

447
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,320
the officials in the court

448
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,280
won't allow Cui Yi to be the crown prince.

449
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,000
It's not like before.

450
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:00,840
Now, the world is too peaceful.

451
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:02,920
The war is over.

452
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:04,960
It's inevitable.

453
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,960
Even the army of Zhen Xi

454
00:25:07,280 --> 00:25:08,840
and the army of Zhen Xi

455
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,680
are also fighting for the throne.

456
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,800
Actually, you know better than anyone else.

457
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:16,160
Cui Yi's army is not controlled by the court.

458
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,720
And there are many people.

459
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:19,480
If they fight for the throne now,

460
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,400
they can still be the crown prince.

461
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:24,160
If they can't be the crown prince in the future,

462
00:25:24,600 --> 00:25:27,000
and the soldiers will meet again,

463
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:30,680
that's the only way to save them.

464
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,920
There will be a way to save them.

465
00:25:40,560 --> 00:25:42,040
Shi Qi Lang, I think so.

466
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,880
Actually, Miss Cui is very sympathetic.

467
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,960
As long as you can be the crown prince,

468
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,880
and persuade her with your little heart,

469
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I think

470
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:53,960
you can't treat her like this.

471
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,720
In our curator healthy,

472
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,360
Americans can treat their children just somehow.

473
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,120
Yes.

474
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,400
Coming.

475
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:12,360
Miss, this fits great.

476
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,240
How can he even eat it without eating it?

477
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,640
He has a very mild rose mustnn't

478
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,280
and 성 caused.

479
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,560
Miss,

480
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,440
my children have just came back home.

481
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:22,600
And then,

482
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:24,360
we have to start a store like this thing.

483
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,320
Do sell something like this carefully.

484
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:27,120
It's a good idea.

485
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:28,280
When your shop opens,

486
00:26:28,280 --> 00:26:29,560
I'll have to close the shop first.

487
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,600
Then you have to buy more.

488
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,480
Of course, I'll buy a lot.

489
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,240
Buy me some

490
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:37,880
rose and cherry flowers later.

491
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:38,680
I'll send them to you.

492
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:40,440
Miss.

493
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:42,720
Are you sending them to His Highness?

494
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,240
I won't.

495
00:26:44,560 --> 00:26:45,680
If you don't,

496
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,200
who will I send them to?

497
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:48,800
The secret.

498
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,880
You always want to keep it.

499
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:55,320
Ma Bu.

500
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:56,960
Hold on.

501
00:26:58,720 --> 00:26:59,440
Pay attention.

502
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,000
Be careful.

503
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:02,280
Go.

504
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:07,200
Go.

505
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:11,880
Are you tired?

506
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:12,680
I'm not.

507
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:13,760
Again.

508
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:17,960
Good.

509
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,080
Again.

510
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:22,680
Harder.

511
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:27,640
Come.

512
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:28,040
Come.

513
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,320
Come.

514
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:28,640
Come.

515
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:29,040
Come.

516
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:29,440
Come.

517
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:29,800
Come.

518
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:30,200
Come.

519
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:30,760
Come.

520
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:31,240
Come.

521
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,040
Thanks to Miss Cui,

522
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,080
you still think of me as a foreigner.

523
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:47,000
You brought me such a beautiful dessert.

524
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,200
You think of your grandchild or child?

525
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:51,440
You must love this food.

526
00:27:51,680 --> 00:27:53,160
So you sent it here.

527
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,160
His Highness has been considered as a crown prince.

528
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,600
The choice is not too grand.

529
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,240
Miss Cui,

530
00:28:00,640 --> 00:28:02,720
don't make this name again.

531
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:04,480
Yes.

532
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,080
To be honest,

533
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,080
in the past ten years,

534
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,520
we haven't had a heart of gold.

535
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,560
Although this is a place outside,

536
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:15,880
it's not so luxurious.

537
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,240
But it's like a person with a long rule.

538
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,200
It's so thoughtful.

539
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:21,920
Yes.

540
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:23,960
Yes.

541
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,640
When I saw the real person

542
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:27,280
making the choice,

543
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:28,880
he was very filial.

544
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:32,000
I just think it's a great deal.

545
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,720
Miss Cui,

546
00:28:37,800 --> 00:28:39,840
it's time to be the crown princess.

547
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,520
I don't know.

548
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,360
The crown prince and Miss Cui are in love.

549
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,480
Miss Cui will definitely be the crown princess.

550
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:53,200
But...

551
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,080
To be honest,

552
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,280
I feel sorry for them.

553
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,320
The crown prince is the crown prince.

554
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,760
He is the crown prince.

555
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,400
The crown prince is the crown prince.

556
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,320
He is the crown prince.

557
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,040
He is the most important person

558
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:16,880
in the royal family.

559
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:19,920
But no one knows

560
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:23,840
how difficult it is to be the crown princess.

561
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,640
The real person just said

562
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:30,640
that in the past ten years,

563
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,440
we haven't had a heart of gold.

564
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,760
Yes.

565
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,400
When the world is in chaos,

566
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:45,160
I am so ashamed and heartbroken.

567
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,000
But when I was the crown princess,

568
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:52,160
I was always with you.

569
00:29:53,160 --> 00:29:54,880
If you really become the crown princess,

570
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,920
you will lose yourself.

571
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:02,240
Your joy and sorrow

572
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,120
are not important anymore.

573
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:08,960
Your destiny

574
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,160
and Chu's behavior

575
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:13,360
and the heartbreak of the royal court

576
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,000
are all together.

577
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:20,800
We can't fight for it anymore.

578
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,800
The crown princess's identity

579
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:27,360
is glory

580
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:29,800
and progress.

581
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,240
Did the real person

582
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,240
ever feel sad for the crown prince?

583
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:42,200
If I feel sad,

584
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,120
wouldn't it be hard

585
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,120
to get over this?

586
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,200
Many things

587
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,560
are the duty of the crown princess.

588
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,920
The real person is great.

589
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,680
It's indeed the crown princess.

590
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,480
Actually, what I asked for

591
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,200
was just the heartbreak.

592
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:13,560
The most difficult thing in life

593
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,920
is the heartbreak.

594
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,040
I and Miss Cui

595
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:21,680
just have a chat.

596
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:24,560
I've talked too much today.

597
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,320
The real person is here.

598
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:30,080
I've never met

599
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:32,520
a crown princess

600
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:35,000
and a new crown princess.

601
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,160
I'm so happy.

602
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,280
It's a fate.

603
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,320
She could be the first one.

604
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:09,520
Your highness.

605
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:13,200
Miss Gu, I'm here.

606
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:14,640
What's the matter?

607
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,600
Lady Sourire wanted you to come in.

608
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:20,080
I don't know why His Majestyès

609
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:21,600
left him with that note.

610
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,200
If His Highness PFY habitat

611
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:35,880
could ask

612
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,920
How could you delay your life

613
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:39,880
because of His Majesty's words?

614
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,240
People say that

615
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,840
there's no words.

616
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:46,160
I really don't want to

617
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:47,440
take your fault

618
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,960
and delay the marriage with Miss Cui.

619
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,360
Or I'm in a relationship with Miss Cui.

620
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,280
I really wish to go out of the house.

621
00:32:58,080 --> 00:32:59,040
It's nothing.

622
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,320
Don't worry.

623
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,360
Ying and I

624
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,000
will never be in a relationship

625
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
because of others.

626
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:06,720
I...

627
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:09,320
Yes.

628
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,960
Thank you for coming to visit us.

629
00:33:12,280 --> 00:33:14,320
You haven't been so happy for a long time.

630
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:16,040
Since now,

631
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,720
I don't need to say much.

632
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,560
Since I got back to...

633
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,280
I got back to the choice.

634
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:24,720
You look so happy.

635
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,720
Miss Cui came to visit him.

636
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,400
He has a talent in his eyes.

637
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,360
It's hard to say

638
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,520
what you want to say

639
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:34,400
to Miss Cui.

640
00:33:35,040 --> 00:33:36,400
I was embarrassed to

641
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,920
disturb you.

642
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,600
But I thought

643
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,800
it was a choice

644
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:42,200
and a child.

645
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,560
You've been in love with him for so many years.

646
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,040
It's hard to say.

647
00:33:47,760 --> 00:33:49,200
So I wanted to come here often

648
00:33:49,640 --> 00:33:51,120
and not to make trouble for myself.

649
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,080
Where?

650
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,400
Jinjiang has been looking forward to seeing you.

651
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:56,640
Although she doesn't say much,

652
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:59,600
she also looks forward to seeing you.

653
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:01,600
Ying.

654
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,720
My parents for four years have cheated on me,

655
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,240
but I've not said anything forward.

656
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,480
Appreciate the question.

657
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,880
TheCancer of Prince's Majesty chambers.

658
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:24,160
May I help you?

659
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,320
Yes.

660
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,480
So it's better that you don't mind.

661
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:28,760
Even if I suffer,

662
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,360
I will help you to tell me out of regret.

663
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,120
The PrincessGoodbye roll.

664
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,160
Looks great.

665
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,200
Don't let me see you, Han.

666
00:34:37,160 --> 00:34:37,940
Consort Xiao was nice.

667
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,000
Are you happy Chou doesn't pick the right decision?

668
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,340
She is good.

669
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,220
Why don't you check her out?

670
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:45,880
She had a clear feeling as a child.

671
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,600
So she was the very one who changed on hernie mere.

672
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,920
When I went there to see her,

673
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:52,300
I didn't want to care about her bedtightness.

674
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:53,800
No way.

675
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:55,800
General Han got her taught carefully.

676
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,880
Consort Xiao was able even take care of her wonderfully.

677
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,000
Is she more against on her climate?

678
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:02,240
Who's G- oczywiście?

679
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,060
But fear against

680
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,380
What's the point of doing that?

681
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:06,700
My lady,

682
00:35:06,980 --> 00:35:09,060
is that you and Miss Cui?

683
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:13,820
Wait.

684
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:16,300
How do I feel that

685
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,900
what we just said

686
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,220
is wrong?

687
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,300
You're a father and a mother.

688
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:23,540
How do I feel that I'm a mother?

689
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,900
You're a father and a mother.

690
00:35:25,300 --> 00:35:26,140
I'm always

691
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,660
trying to get rid of my child.

692
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,860
You're just a coward.

693
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,940
Who's a father and a mother?

694
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,860
You're so naughty.

695
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:35,300
You...

696
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:36,500
Run!

697
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:40,900
Go and get on.

698
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,660
Consort Cui from the selection,

699
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:04,580
It's been settled doing at Shaanxi.

700
00:36:05,860 --> 00:36:07,040
You did have the inclusions much higher than before.

701
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:20,940
You must have啦keed do

702
00:36:20,940 --> 00:36:27,220
I expecting them to be the SH pour

703
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:32,420
Prodeers sending a separateRY

704
00:36:32,420 --> 00:36:36,420
In this way, the burden of the people will be reduced.

705
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:40,420
There were many people who were good at fighting and fighting.

706
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:42,420
They were all kind people.

707
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:45,420
In order to survive, they were forced to be slaughtered.

708
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:49,420
There were also many people who were wandering around in different places.

709
00:36:49,420 --> 00:36:52,420
They would be in trouble sooner or later.

710
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,420
Yes.

711
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:57,420
I also think about this.

712
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Like the big brother,

713
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:01,420
you are also a kind person.

714
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,420
But because of the war and the war,

715
00:37:05,420 --> 00:37:07,420
they were forced to enter the forest.

716
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,420
I'll give you something.

717
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,420
This is so cute.

718
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,420
Is this me?

719
00:37:27,420 --> 00:37:29,420
How can my legs be so short?

720
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:34,420
I'll give you a little.

721
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:44,420
This is you.

722
00:37:44,420 --> 00:37:47,420
You look so round.

723
00:37:47,420 --> 00:37:49,420
I won't draw.

724
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,420
How can this be so big?

725
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:55,420
It's too thin. It's not too much.

726
00:37:55,420 --> 00:37:57,420
I can only draw big.

727
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:59,420
The painting you drew for me,

728
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:01,420
I'm doing fine now.

729
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:03,420
When will you give me another one?

730
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:05,420
Can't you draw it yourself?

731
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:08,420
I drew it like this, but you're not satisfied.

732
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:13,420
It looks so familiar.

733
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:15,420
It looks good.

734
00:38:29,420 --> 00:38:31,420
Look at this.

735
00:38:39,420 --> 00:38:41,420
Your eyes are so big.

736
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,420
They are also so round.

737
00:38:56,420 --> 00:38:58,420
I'll give you a little.

738
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,420
All the things we've experienced,

739
00:39:01,420 --> 00:39:03,420
are all drawn.

740
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:05,420
The back is also white.

741
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,420
Let's wait for the two of us to draw together.

742
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:09,420
Okay?

743
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:12,420
This doctor is still very long.

744
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:15,420
We will encounter many interesting things.

745
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:18,420
After the painting, we will draw the next one.

746
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:20,420
After the next one, we will draw the next one.

747
00:39:20,420 --> 00:39:22,420
When we get old,

748
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:24,420
we will look back at each other.

749
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,420
There's always one time.

750
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,420
One by one.

751
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:01,420
One by one.

752
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:19,420
Father.

753
00:40:21,420 --> 00:40:22,420
Father,

754
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:24,420
General Pei is here.

755
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:26,420
What did he say?

756
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,420
He said that His Majesty and the court officials

757
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,420
all opposed to you being the Crown Princess Consort.

758
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,420
I was against it.

759
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:37,420
He was so greedy.

760
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:40,420
He said that you and your father were in love.

761
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:43,420
Do you want to help him

762
00:40:43,420 --> 00:40:46,420
like his old man?

763
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:49,420
He advised me

764
00:40:49,420 --> 00:40:51,420
to be a emperor.

765
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:54,420
If the wealth is all in the Cui family,

766
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:57,420
the soldiers will be all over the place.

767
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:59,420
You might have the chance

768
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:02,420
to marry Li Ni as the Crown Princess Consort.

769
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:05,420
Father,

770
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:08,420
the world is in peace now.

771
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:11,420
The court must want to withdraw troops.

772
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:13,420
We don't need to talk about the Western Army.

773
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:17,420
The Cui family must be the first to be charged.

774
00:41:19,420 --> 00:41:22,420
If we don't take the White Water Pass,

775
00:41:23,420 --> 00:41:26,420
I think the court will withdraw all the troops

776
00:41:26,420 --> 00:41:28,420
as soon as possible.

777
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,420
Father,

778
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,420
the county government is closed.

779
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,420
Why don't you go back to Yingzhou?

780
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,420
You've been living in the capital for a long time.

781
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,420
You've been living with the Cui family and the court.

782
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:43,420
If the court really wants to withdraw the troops,

783
00:41:43,420 --> 00:41:45,420
I'm really worried

784
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:48,420
that someone will disobey your order.

785
00:41:49,420 --> 00:41:51,420
What about you?

786
00:41:51,420 --> 00:41:53,420
Why don't you go back with me?

787
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:55,420
If I go with you,

788
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,420
I'll have a plan.

789
00:41:57,420 --> 00:41:59,420
I'll stay in the capital.

790
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:01,420
It's not a big deal.

791
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,420
You're just a kid for Li Ni.

792
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,420
Father,

793
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:07,420
aren't you a fool?

794
00:42:07,420 --> 00:42:08,420
Since he's so stupid,

795
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,420
I'll stay and help him.

796
00:42:11,420 --> 00:42:13,420
You're a woman.

797
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:16,420
When did you meet your father?

798
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:19,420
I've been thinking about helping an outsider.

799
00:42:19,420 --> 00:42:20,420
I think

800
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:23,420
I really want to leave this place.

801
00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:24,420
Okay, father.

802
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:25,420
Don't be angry.

803
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:27,420
Come on, have some tea.

804
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:31,420
He's a crown prince now.

805
00:42:31,420 --> 00:42:33,420
If you want to take him away,

806
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:35,420
don't you want to leave the mountain?

807
00:42:47,420 --> 00:42:48,420
Young Master,

808
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,420
the water is cold.

809
00:42:50,420 --> 00:42:52,420
I'm not hungry.

810
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:54,420
Have some.

811
00:42:55,420 --> 00:42:57,420
I'm not hungry either.

812
00:43:01,420 --> 00:43:02,420
Young Master,

813
00:43:02,420 --> 00:43:04,420
you've taken the medicine you said.

814
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,420
If you don't take it,

815
00:43:07,420 --> 00:43:09,420
you'll suffer a lot.

816
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,420
I'm not hungry either.

817
00:43:15,420 --> 00:43:18,420
We still have to find a way to get back to the capital.

818
00:43:21,420 --> 00:43:23,420
The leader of the Wuluo City

819
00:43:23,420 --> 00:43:26,420
gave me the most trusted sword to him.

820
00:43:26,420 --> 00:43:29,420
But he's a total stranger.

821
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:34,420
Now Li Ni is the crown prince.

822
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:36,420
I won't let him be with Ying.

823
00:43:36,420 --> 00:43:38,420
It seems

824
00:43:38,420 --> 00:43:41,420
we should take the risk.

825
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:44,420
What you mean is

826
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:49,420
the person that Sun Jing left behind

827
00:43:49,420 --> 00:43:53,420
has to use it this time.

828
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:08,420
Father.

829
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:13,420
Your son is here.

830
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:22,420
Come and sit.

831
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:28,420
Father, are you tired?

832
00:44:29,420 --> 00:44:31,420
A friend of mine just came.

833
00:44:32,420 --> 00:44:33,420
He said something.

834
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,420
He said something.

835
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:39,420
He said something.

836
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,420
He said something.

837
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,420
He left in a flash.

838
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,420
Father, you're here.

839
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:48,420
Is there anything you want to say?

840
00:44:48,420 --> 00:44:49,420
Yes.

841
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:52,420
Now the court is in a hurry.

842
00:44:52,420 --> 00:44:55,420
It's hard to keep the Crown Princess Consort away.

843
00:44:55,420 --> 00:44:57,420
I think it's father's secret.

844
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:01,420
Our emperor is a soft-hearted man.

845
00:45:01,420 --> 00:45:03,420
He's a good man.

846
00:45:03,420 --> 00:45:06,420
He can be as good as we wish.

847
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:09,420
Now Cui's daughter

848
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:11,420
can't be tested by the wind.

849
00:45:11,420 --> 00:45:13,420
She's already a public official.

850
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,420
Even if the crown prince wants to be alone,

851
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,420
he can't stop His Majesty's order

852
00:45:19,420 --> 00:45:21,420
and the people's effort to oppose it.

853
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:24,420
But the crown prince and Cui

854
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:26,420
are not ordinary people.

855
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:28,420
If they are just a couple,

856
00:45:28,420 --> 00:45:30,420
I'm afraid they will make a mistake.

857
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:31,420
There are ways.

858
00:45:31,420 --> 00:45:33,420
So we have to think of a way

859
00:45:33,420 --> 00:45:35,420
to let the crown prince and Cui

860
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,420
be together.

861
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,420
We can't be so hard-hearted.

862
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,420
Father, you're right.

863
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,420
In the manor,

864
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:48,420
you're still a father.

865
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,420
You're a good man.

866
00:45:50,420 --> 00:45:52,420
What's the point of this?

867
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:54,420
The Crown Princess Consort is a prince.

868
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,420
She's a prince in the future.

869
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:58,420
Can't the prince

870
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:00,420
ruin your life?

871
00:46:00,420 --> 00:46:02,420
That's all.

872
00:46:06,420 --> 00:46:09,140

You

881
00:46:55,540 --> 00:46:56,820

You don't know that

884
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:02,740
Cui Bo Fu went to the court today

885
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:04,540
and made a mistake again.

886
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,860
He forced me to marry the Crown Princess.

887
00:47:07,100 --> 00:47:08,940
He forced me to marry you.

888
00:47:09,740 --> 00:47:10,860
I was so angry

889
00:47:11,700 --> 00:47:13,140
that I made a mistake.

890
00:47:13,540 --> 00:47:14,140
All right.

891
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,660
I was so angry

892
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:19,540
that my father scolded me again.

893
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:21,660
I was so upset.

894
00:47:23,020 --> 00:47:24,420
Who is Cui Bo Fu?

895
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:27,620
You're not, are you?

896
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:30,460
How could youada

897
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:31,740
that when Cui Bo Fu left this palace,

898
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:33,540
you wouldn't admit it?

Do you just want to go to the court side with me?

902
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:55,820
Why don't you possibly go back to Ying Zhou

903
00:47:55,820 --> 00:47:56,860
Who will be the crown prince?

904
00:47:57,740 --> 00:47:58,900
Then I'll find a head of oil

905
00:47:58,900 --> 00:47:59,860
and make a capital.

906
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:01,140
Let's make a toast.

907
00:48:01,740 --> 00:48:03,500
I'll give birth to a baby.

908
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:05,460
No need to give birth to a baby.

909
00:48:05,740 --> 00:48:06,620
When the third child is born,

910
00:48:06,620 --> 00:48:07,980
the ministers might not be able to stop him.

911
00:48:08,180 --> 00:48:09,380
You'll be the crown prince.

912
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:10,900
Do you know

913
00:48:10,900 --> 00:48:12,380
how long it takes

914
00:48:12,540 --> 00:48:13,820
to give birth to a baby?

915
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:15,220
I know.

916
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:17,340
It's been eight years since then.

917
00:48:18,620 --> 00:48:20,340
When the yellow flower dishes are ready,

918
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,820
what should I do?

919
00:48:22,740 --> 00:48:24,700
The court can't control the government.

920
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:26,100
If I leave,

921
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,820
my father

922
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:29,540
will be in trouble

923
00:48:29,540 --> 00:48:30,660
and he'll do something.

924
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,580
I'll have to clean up the mess.

925
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:37,340
How about this?

926
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:38,980
I'll go back to Yingzhou.

927
00:48:39,540 --> 00:48:40,460
Anyway,

928
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:42,220
I just want to be your wife

929
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:43,780
and not the crown prince.

930
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:44,900
You'll come to see me

931
00:48:45,340 --> 00:48:46,660
when you're there.

932
00:48:48,580 --> 00:48:50,340
You can say that.

933
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:52,220
I'm the crown prince now.

934
00:48:52,380 --> 00:48:53,700
But you're not the crown prince.

935
00:48:53,860 --> 00:48:54,620
Who will do that?

936
00:48:55,060 --> 00:48:57,140
You're so annoying.

937
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:02,540
Your Highness,

938
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:03,700
General Pei is here.

939
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:04,980
He said he has an important business.

940
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:11,700
Wait.

941
00:49:25,700 --> 00:49:26,180
Gentlemen.

942
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:29,860
On your knees!

943
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:33,980
Don't look at me!

944
00:49:36,540 --> 00:49:37,700
Bow to me!

945
00:49:39,500 --> 00:49:40,700
Bow to me!

946
00:49:50,140 --> 00:49:50,340
Your Highness,

947
00:49:50,340 --> 00:49:51,400
my majesty.

948
00:49:51,900 --> 00:49:52,020
So annoying.

949
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:52,700
Shut up!

950
00:49:52,700 --> 00:49:54,700
Who do you think you are?

951
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:56,700
Who do you think you are?

952
00:49:56,700 --> 00:49:58,700
Cui Yi.

953
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:19,700
If I forget the six-year-old cherry blossom,

954
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:25,700
when the memory is broken into pieces,

955
00:50:28,700 --> 00:50:32,700
if the half of what you have in your heart,

956
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:39,700
that car is my car.

957
00:50:41,700 --> 00:50:46,700
If I don't think of you,

958
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:52,700
I will miss the moment when I taste the most.

959
00:50:54,700 --> 00:50:58,700
The warmth of all the life,

960
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:03,700
I want to stay for you.

961
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,700
If we love each other,

962
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,700
we will become strangers.

963
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:15,700
From now on, I will live for you.

964
00:51:17,700 --> 00:51:29,700
I will wait for my love to be my promise.

965
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:33,700
If we love each other,

966
00:51:33,700 --> 00:51:36,700
we will become strangers.

967
00:51:37,700 --> 00:51:43,700
From now on, I will live for you.

968
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:49,700
I will wait for your love to be my promise.

969
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,700
If we love each other,

970
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,700
we will become strangers.

971
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:02,700
From now on, I will live for you.

972
00:52:03,700 --> 00:52:08,700
I will wait for your love to be my promise.

973
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,500
I will sing for you

974
00:52:12,500 --> 00:52:20,100
I will wait for you to come back to me
