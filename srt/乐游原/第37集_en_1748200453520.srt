1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,920
In the form of frost,Don't look back

2
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,140
See you at foreign countries soon.

3
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,160
Do you know what do you mean?

4
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,680
Make a date for tomorrow at foreign countries with a new record.

5
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,000
Something is wrong ing.

6
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:20,560
Not here at foreign countries.

7
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:21,720
No.

8
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,720
A'Ming,

9
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,720
I didn't expect to see you again.

10
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Is this a dream?

11
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,720
This is not a dream.

12
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:45,720
I finally see you.

13
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
Do you blame me?

14
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,720
You blame me for not coming to save you.

15
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,720
You don't blame me.

16
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,720
But I always blame myself.

17
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,720
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,720
I'm sorry.

19
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,720
I'm sorry.

20
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:27,720
I'm sorry.

21
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:30,720
I'm sorry.

22
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
I'm sorry.

23
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,720
I'm sorry.

24
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm sorry.

25
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,720
I'm sorry.

26
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,720
A'Ming.

27
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:00,720
A'Ming.

28
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,720
A'Ming.

29
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,720
A'Ming.

30
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,720
A'Ming.

31
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,720
Who are you?

32
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Why am I here?

33
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,720
Why do you let me see my wife?

34
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,720
You can come in.

35
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,720
A'Ming.

36
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,720
General.

37
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,720
Why are you here?

38
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Where is A'Ming?

39
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,720
General, your illness is cured.

40
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,720
Can you recognize us?

41
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:52,720
His Highness has been trying to cure you.

42
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,720
Father.

43
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:14,720
Father.

44
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:16,720
How are you?

45
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,720
A'Ying.

46
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
You're thin.

47
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,720
And you're chubby.

48
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,720
You've been worried about father for so many days.

49
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,720
Miss.

50
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:33,720
The doctor just came to see you.

51
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,720
He said he had a chest pain.

52
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,720
He was very clear.

53
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:38,720
He was fine.

54
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:39,720
I see.

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,720
I just think

56
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:46,720
you're almost lost.

57
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:50,720
But I'm scared to death.

58
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,720
I'm so worried about you.

59
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:58,720
A'Ming, you're fine.

60
00:06:58,720 --> 00:06:59,720
Really.

61
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,720
These days,

62
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,720
you're like a dream.

63
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,720
Now you finally understand.

64
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,720
But father,

65
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,720
your hair

66
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,720
is all white.

67
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
You're lying.

68
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,720
Father is old.

69
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,720
Your hair will be white.

70
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
Father is going to be A'Weng's man.

71
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,720
Why is your hair not white?

72
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,720
Father.

73
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,720
Are you feeling better?

74
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,720
Much better.

75
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:42,720
Drink it.

76
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,720
Why didn't you tell me?

77
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:56,720
The doctor said it would be risky.

78
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,720
I'm afraid it will be a bad idea.

79
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,720
I'm worried about it.

80
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,720
What if it's a bad idea?

81
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,720
I shouldn't face you.

82
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,720
But I think

83
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,720
General Cui is a brave man.

84
00:08:11,720 --> 00:08:12,720
If he knows,

85
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,720
he will be so angry.

86
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,720
So I asked Mu Qianhe

87
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:18,720
to make a trick.

88
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,720
He used his blood

89
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:22,720
to get the blood out.

90
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,720
He's so clear now.

91
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,720
It's a good time.

92
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,720
Thank you.

93
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,720
I've worked so hard.

94
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,720
Can you just say thank you?

95
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,720
How can I thank you?

96
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
I can't think of it now.

97
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,720
I might think about it

98
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,720
after a few more hours.

99
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:52,720
You said

100
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,720
you must thank me this time.

101
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,720
By the way,

102
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,720
I have something important to tell you.

103
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,720
I think Liu Chengfeng's death

104
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,720
is very strange.

105
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,720
After all, he didn't stop

106
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,720
when he was talking to Jie Shuo.

107
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:13,720
The leader of Jie Shuo

108
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,720
was the誤 at the top of the hall.

109
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,720
He was a businessman

110
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,720
and went to the Western Changjing.

111
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,720
I've sent someone to follow him for a while.

112
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,720
But the誤 is really cunning.

113
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,720
He lost it accidentally.

114
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,720
I think he must be

115
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,720
a bad guy.

116
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
He's not a good guy.

117
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,720
Jie Shuo is a bad guy.

118
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,720
He wants to get rid of

119
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:35,720
such a bold and bold person.

120
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:37,720
Maybe someone will be in the capital.

121
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,720
I'll ask Chang'an

122
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,720
to check the Wen Hall

123
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:41,720
for the two new regiments in two years.

124
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,720
See if we can clean up the snakes

125
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
and let them get out of the barge.

126
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,720
The first time I saw you,

127
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,720
I thought you were a good guy.

128
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,720
I thought you were a good guy.

129
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,720
I thought you were a good guy.

130
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,720
I thought you were a good guy.

131
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,720
I thought you were a good guy.

132
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:07,720
I thought you were a good guy.

133
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I thought you were a good guy.

134
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,720
I thought you were a good guy.

135
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:10,720
I thought you were a good guy.

136
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:11,720
I thought you were a good guy.

137
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:12,720
I thought you were a good guy.

138
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,720
I thought you were a good guy.

139
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,720
I thought you were a good guy.

140
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,720
I thought you were a good guy.

141
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,720
I thought you were a good guy.

142
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,720
I thought you were a good guy.

143
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,720
I thought you were a good guy.

144
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I thought you were a good guy.

145
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:20,720
I thought you were a good guy.

146
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,720
I thought you were a good guy.

147
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
I thought you were a good guy.

148
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,720
You invited someone here to take a look.

149
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,720
You said you didn't want to cross Liu Chengfeng's path

150
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:28,720
and go to the middle.

151
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:31,720
So you came to see me personally.

152
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
I did all Liu Chengfeng's things

153
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:37,720
before I promised you.

154
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,720
But Liu Chengfeng has a son.

155
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,720
If he gets his hands on you,

156
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,720
it will affect your big deal.

157
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
So I told Liu Chengfeng

158
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
to get your son back.

159
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,720
I told Liu Chengfeng

160
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,160
to help you.

161
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,120
So I came here

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,680
to make a promise.

163
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,640
As the official of Central Plain,

164
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,560
you're willing to see me personally.

165
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:05,480
Do you want us to do something for you?

166
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,240
It's just a small thing.

167
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,200
I hope you can help me.

168
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,360
If you can help me,

169
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,480
then the territory you want,

170
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:20,240
salt, iron, rice and grain,

171
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,160
I will do it for you secretly.

172
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,080
What is it?

173
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,520
Kill Crown Princess Cui Li.

174
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,520
She is Cui Yi's daughter.

175
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:43,520
I believe you will be very happy to know her.

176
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,600
You're the prime minister.

177
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,520
If you kill Crown Princess,

178
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,040
aren't you afraid of the consequences?

179
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,000
What?

180
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,760
ARRAM,

181
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,480
you won't go to fishing right?

182
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
I'm not a coward.

183
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
I'm just a woman.

184
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:16,560
There are two more

185
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,480
decisive candidates in my men's hands.

186
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:22,480
Although Cui Shi is the Crown Princess,

187
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
as long as I make my arrangement,

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,480
killing him is not a simple thing.

189
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,480
Good.

190
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,480
So from today,

191
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,480
you will be the Crown Princess.

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,480
I will be the Crown Princess.

193
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:41,480
I will be the Crown Princess.

194
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:43,480
So from today,

195
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
I will be the Crown Princess.

196
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,480
I will do my best

197
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:48,480
to make the arrangement.

198
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,480
But I also hope

199
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:52,480
that the arrangement will be done.

200
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,480
But I still don't understand

201
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,480
why you are like this.

202
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
In the eyes of the world,

203
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,480
the Manor is not as good as the human.

204
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,480
It's a good opportunity.

205
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,480
What about the former Manor?

206
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,480
After the war,

207
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,480
the two major matters were settled.

208
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:18,480
The war was over.

209
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,480
The war ended with a great defeat.

210
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
The Zicun family

211
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
took the chance to conquer the land.

212
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,480
The emperor is a confused emperor.

213
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,480
He is not capable of getting married.

214
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
Although I am a Prime Minister,

215
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
I am a landlady in the Eastern Palace.

216
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,480
I am the future emperor of the He family.

217
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,480
I can't

218
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,480
be so confused with the emperor.

219
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,480
Except for the Crown Princess,

220
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,480
what else do you want us to do?

221
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,480
Of course, I am in a relationship

222
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,480
with the court.

223
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,480
If something happens to the court,

224
00:14:01,480 --> 00:14:03,480
I will inform you secretly

225
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,480
to send troops to the border.

226
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,480
If the general sent by the court is my man,

227
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,480
you will be defeated.

228
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,480
He will be the first to take the lead.

229
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,480
If the court is in danger,

230
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,480
I will think of a way

231
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,480
to defeat him.

232
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,480
Good.

233
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
You are very good.

234
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
As long as the war is over,

235
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
the soldiers and the soldiers

236
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,480
will be your men.

237
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,480
I am a civil servant

238
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,480
who is not in the service of the army.

239
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,480
If the general sent me troops,

240
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I will think of another way.

241
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,480
You are not brave

242
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
and not ambitious.

243
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
But I like you.

244
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,480
Don't worry.

245
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
As long as you help us,

246
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,480
we will help you

247
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:53,480
with everything.

248
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:57,480
There is one more important thing.

249
00:14:57,480 --> 00:14:59,480
Liu Chengfeng is a man

250
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,480
who is very good at hunting.

251
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,480
When you kill the crown princess,

252
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,480
you must lower the position of Liu Chengfeng

253
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,480
and be the commander.

254
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,480
These days,

255
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
the situation is very serious.

256
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,480
When the enemy is close to the river,

257
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,480
it is hard to keep the position.

258
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Therefore, Liu Chengfeng

259
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
wants to kill the crown princess first.

260
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,480
He wants to kill the crown princess

261
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:24,480
and take the high position of the crown princess.

262
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,480
In this way,

263
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,480
you can kill Cui Lin

264
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
by killing him.

265
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,480
Since I returned to Central Plain,

266
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:41,480
I have never been so happy.

267
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:44,480
I can use the mule.

268
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
As long as I take Ying away,

269
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I can go far away from him.

270
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
In the future,

271
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,480
I will leave everything behind.

272
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,480
Mr. Xing,

273
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:55,480
as you wish.

274
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,480
As you wish.

275
00:15:57,480 --> 00:15:58,480
Shun Xing.

276
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:04,480
You can leave with me.

277
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
You were an orphan.

278
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,480
You were a nobody.

279
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:12,480
So I changed you to Shun Xing.

280
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
I am sorry.

281
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,480
I was too old to be your commander.

282
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,480
I was too old to be your commander.

283
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,480
I was too old to be your commander.

284
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,480
Actually,

285
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,480
I am the same.

286
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:32,480
I am an orphan without parents.

287
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,480
If you change my surname to Liu,

288
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:36,480
I will have a family.

289
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Mr. Xing, you are so nice.

290
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
Liu Shu.

291
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:53,480
I am so nice.

292
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:57,480
Here.

293
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
Eat.

294
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
Okay.

295
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Eat more.

296
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,480
I want to invite you to the Qingyun Temple.

297
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,480
It is quiet there.

298
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,480
There is a guard.

299
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,480
And the choice is also there.

300
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,480
If you come to the temple,

301
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,480
you can make a choice.

302
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,480
A child will be happy.

303
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
He will think about it.

304
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
He will be happy.

305
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,480
This idea is good.

306
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,480
I remember when I was a child,

307
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
when father taught me to dance,

308
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
I was so happy.

309
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:49,480
I was so happy.

310
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,480
I was so happy.

311
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
Okay.

312
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:53,480
Your Highness,

313
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,480
you can go to the court.

314
00:17:55,480 --> 00:17:57,480
I have an important matter to tell you.

315
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:59,480
What is it?

316
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,480
We...

317
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,480
The jade bucket in the back hall is too small.

318
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,480
Change it to bigger one.

319
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
Okay.

320
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,480
I should go to the court.

321
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,480
No.

322
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:29,480
Those people.

323
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:33,480
What is the matter with that jade bucket?

324
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:37,480
Why are you here to disturb Yingzhou again?

325
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,480
Didn't we agree before?

326
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,480
What is the matter with Sanghe?

327
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,480
Your Majesty.

328
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,480
Since the liberation of Cui's army,

329
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
maybe it's a good chance to accept it.

330
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:52,480
So, I came to visit Yingzhou again.

331
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
Then send the crown prince to go.

332
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,480
He likes to fight.

333
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
But this time,

334
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,480
we must beat them up.

335
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,480
Let them remember the lesson.

336
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
Your Majesty,

337
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,480
as the crown prince,

338
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,480
you don't want to lead the army to rebel.

339
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:11,480
You should lead the army to the west.

340
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
Okay.

341
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Then you go.

342
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,480
Yes.

343
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,480
Your Majesty,

344
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,480
I think General Pei has already had a spring and autumn.

345
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,480
Why not let Pei Yuan go with him?

346
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:26,480
There must be a Zhao Ying on the way.

347
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Prime Minister Gu is right.

348
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,480
As a father,

349
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:41,480
I don't need to be a son to Zhao Ying.

350
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,480
I can't say it.

351
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:52,480
Now all the bones in the body are painful.

352
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,480
The royal family under the rain

353
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,480
is going to catch the crown prince.

354
00:19:57,480 --> 00:19:59,480
Let's take care of it.

355
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
Yes.

356
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,480
You're back.

357
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,480
Why are you back so late?

358
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,480
You don't know that General Pei's going to war

359
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
with the general.

360
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
I don't know.

361
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I don't know.

362
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I don't know.

363
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:37,480
I don't know.

364
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:39,480
I don't know.

365
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:41,480
I don't know.

366
00:20:41,480 --> 00:20:43,480
I don't know.

367
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
I don't know.

368
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,480
General Pei is going to war.

369
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
He has a lot of things to do.

370
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
Besides,

371
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
isn't it because of the wedding that he didn't go to the court?

372
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,480
My father

373
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,480
was so worried about him.

374
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,480
Now all the six books in the three provinces

375
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,480
have been deleted.

376
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,480
I've been busy with the work

377
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,480
and I'm only dealing with the bull and bull.

378
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,480
Did you use the bowl?

379
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,480
I want to eat the meat

380
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
that I ate with the bull.

381
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Besides,

382
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,480
the bull

383
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,480
always has a good taste.

384
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,480
It's called bull ear.

385
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:24,480
You never call me bull.

386
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,480
You're so stubborn.

387
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,480
I'm going to prepare the kitchen now.

388
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
It's already three o'clock.

389
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:32,480
It's so late.

390
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
Let's go to bed.

391
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:36,480
No.

392
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:37,480
We should eat the meat first.

393
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:38,480
No.

394
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,480
Let's go to bed.

395
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,480
You're the general of the boat?

396
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,480
I've heard many stories about you.

397
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:50,480
The snow night is over.

398
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,480
The war is over.

399
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:55,480
Who told you that?

400
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,480
General Han.

401
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,480
Every night when I can't sleep,

402
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:01,480
he tells me stories.

403
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
General Xu.

404
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:04,480
Your knife skills are so good.

405
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:06,480
General Han taught me some sword skills.

406
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,480
Can I learn it from you?

407
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:09,480
Of course.

408
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:10,480
Come.

409
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:13,480
Look at it.

410
00:22:17,480 --> 00:22:18,480
Come.

411
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:21,480
Come.

412
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:24,480
Come.

413
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:26,480
Come.

414
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,480
Come.

415
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,480
Come.

416
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:33,480
Come.

417
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:36,480
Come.

418
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,480
Come.

419
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,480
Come.

420
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,480
I'm here.

421
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,480
I'm so happy to see you.

422
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,480
General Cui taught you well.

423
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,480
You taught Xuanze well.

424
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,480
So you've learned to play with this.

425
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,480
How could it be?

426
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,480
General Cui has Xuanze's true power.

427
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,480
Xuanze is so good at playing with General Cui.

428
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,480
He can learn a lot from him.

429
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,480
But he's not good at playing with two rings.

430
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,480
Yes.

431
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,480
You are right.

432
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,480
You can't always teach me.

433
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:10,480
You haven't taught me for a long time.

434
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,480
I just taught you yesterday.

435
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:13,480
It's not that.

436
00:23:13,480 --> 00:23:14,480
You lost.

437
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
My talent.

438
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,480
A Yan.

439
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:18,480
I'm thinking

440
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,480
if we want to have two dolls first.

441
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,480
One is called A Zhen.

442
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,480
One is called Dao.

443
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,480
He's left.

444
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,480
We'll play together.

445
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,480
Who said I'll play with you?

446
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,480
You said you wanted to have four.

447
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,480
You can't have less.

448
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,480
When did you promise me?

449
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:32,480
You're so annoying.

450
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:35,480
I'll tell you the truth.

451
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:36,480
You set your own rules.

452
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:37,480
I didn't say that.

453
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:40,480
I don't care.

454
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,480
Just four.

455
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:42,480
No.

456
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,480
I didn't promise you.

457
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:44,480
Then six.

458
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,480
Eight.

459
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:46,480
Ten.

460
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:55,480
The meat of Feng Yinrong is so delicious.

461
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
Yesterday, you sent me to the chef

462
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,480
and cooked a new dish called roast snake.

463
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,480
I felt so fresh.

464
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:03,480
But today, you're eating the meat.

465
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,480
I don't want to eat it.

466
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:10,480
Mr. Mu, you're very concerned about your father's illness.

467
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,480
We're toast to you.

468
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,480
You're welcome.

469
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,480
By the way,

470
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,480
I heard that there's a big fish in Yingzhou.

471
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:27,480
It's very cold.

472
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:30,480
And it's very delicious every spring and summer.

473
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,480
The fish is very delicious.

474
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:37,480
But I've never eaten it in so many years.

475
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:41,480
You're so crisp.

476
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
You should eat it for me.

477
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:46,480
I'll do my best.

478
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,480
Okay.

479
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:49,480
That's settled.

480
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,480
You help me cook the fish.

481
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,480
I'll send you two a magic trick.

482
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,480
Really?

483
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,480
That's great.

484
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:58,480
I've been asking my father

485
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,480
what kind of magic trick he saw on Mr. Mu.

486
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,480
He wouldn't tell me no matter what.

487
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:05,480
People say that Mr. Mu is a magic trick.

488
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,480
He's like a fairy.

489
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,480
Then today,

490
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,480
he can open his eyes.

491
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,480
Do you like fireflies?

492
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:16,480
How do you know?

493
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:23,480
I don't know.

494
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:54,480
Mr. Mu

495
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,480
Mr. Mu

496
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,480
I'll use this little magic trick

497
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,480
to congratulate you two on your wedding.

498
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

499
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,480
Ladies and gentlemen,

500
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,480
how was your meal today?

501
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:28,480
I'm very satisfied.

502
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,480
Thank you, my guest.

503
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
There's a good fish here in the south.

504
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,480
Do you want to bring it home to cook fish?

505
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Okay, I'll bring it.

506
00:27:37,480 --> 00:27:38,480
The customer paid a lot last time

507
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,480
to buy a fish.

508
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,480
He gave us a lot of money today.

509
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:42,480
My boss said

510
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,480
this fish was for the customer.

511
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:48,480
He said there's no garlic in the family.

512
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,480
My boss said

513
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
this garlic

514
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,480
was also for the customer.

515
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,480
Thank you.

516
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,480
My boss told me

517
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,480
he knows how to do business.

518
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:01,480
He's the first in the western capital.

519
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,480
He's destined to have a new business.

520
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,480
Thank you, my guest.

521
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,480
Here's your fish.

522
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:10,480
Thank you.

523
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,480
You're really good at garlic.

524
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,480
Our family really doesn't have garlic.

525
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,480
Besides,

526
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:20,480
they sent it here.

527
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,480
If they don't take it,

528
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,480
it's not a big deal.

529
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:24,480
What are you going to do

530
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,480
with this garlic?

531
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,480
Why do you ask me?

532
00:28:28,480 --> 00:28:29,480
Of course,

533
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:31,480
I'll be a non-sense.

534
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,480
Why are you a non-sense?

535
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:35,480
Of course I'm not a non-sense.

536
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:37,480
I'm afraid you're a non-sense.

537
00:28:37,480 --> 00:28:38,480
Are you that cruel?

538
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,480
This is garlic.

539
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:41,480
Someone said

540
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:42,480
his wife

541
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:43,480
would let him taste garlic.

542
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,480
And the name of the online celebrity

543
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:46,480
is not as good as

544
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,480
the name of the famous couple.

545
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:51,480
I'm just kidding.

546
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,480
Miss.

547
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:19,480
Taozi.

548
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,480
Miss.

549
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,480
I have something to tell you.

550
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:26,480
What is it?

551
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:27,480
Our Cui's army

552
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:29,480
has been taken over by the government.

553
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,480
They're just

554
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
leaving the money in Yingzhou.

555
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,480
It's just hundreds of people.

556
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:33,480
They're talking about the rebellion.

557
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,480
The court ordered General Pei

558
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:36,480
to take the people of the Zhengxi army

559
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,480
to Yingzhou

560
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,480
and make a strict order.

561
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,480
The number of soldiers of the Cui's army

562
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:41,480
is about to be taken down.

563
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,480
The Beizhou Water District.

564
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,480
It's said that

565
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,480
the Beizhou government is very strict.

566
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,480
It's very strict.

567
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,480
It's like a criminal

568
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,480
to treat our Cui's army.

569
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,480
Not only are they talking about the rebellion,

570
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:52,480
but also the movement.

571
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,480
They're also fighting for the country.

572
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,480
These people are really heartless.

573
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:57,480
So they're pushing your general.

574
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,480
From Beizhou,

575
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,480
they've been to the Western Changjing

576
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:02,480
to meet the general

577
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,480
or the lady.

578
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,480
Don't let father know about this.

579
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,480
Yes.

580
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:13,480
Where is the general now?

581
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
He escaped.

582
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,480
He has wounds on him.

583
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,480
After he arrived in Western Changjing,

584
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,480
he was always at our Cui's house

585
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:19,480
to comfort his father.

586
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:21,480
I would get something from him that day.

587
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,480
He recognized me.

588
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,480
He followed me for a long time.

589
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,480
He saw me with no one around him

590
00:30:26,480 --> 00:30:27,480
and he dared to talk to me

591
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:28,480
in front of me.

592
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:30,480
I recognized him

593
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,480
as the general of the left wing.

594
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:33,480
It's just compared to the past.

595
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,480
The sales have really gone up.

596
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,480
I think he must have had a lot of hardships

597
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,480
during this journey.

598
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,480
He didn't have any problems

599
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,480
and didn't dare to stay in the palace.

600
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,480
He said that these days,

601
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:44,480
he could only be in the temple

602
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:45,480
outside the city.

603
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,480
Miss,

604
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:51,480
shall we tell your highness

605
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:52,480
about this matter?

606
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:54,480
No.

607
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:56,480
This matter

608
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,480
is about Cui Xia Jun.

609
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,480
Don't tell your highness

610
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,480
so that he can't suffer.

611
00:31:03,480 --> 00:31:04,480
How about this?

612
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,480
You ask this Tan Fu Jiao

613
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:06,480
to go to Feng Ying House.

614
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,480
Then we two

615
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,480
pretend to go to eat and drink.

616
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:11,480
We'll meet him first.

617
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:12,480
Then we'll meet him first.

618
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,480
Then we'll ask him

619
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,480
what the situation is in Beizhou.

620
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,480
Okay.

621
00:31:23,480 --> 00:31:24,480
It's been so many days

622
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,480
since we ate the garlic meat.

623
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,480
Your highness,

624
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,480
I've said that you can eat it every day.

625
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:29,480
You said that it's too late

626
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,480
and you can't eat it.

627
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:32,480
It's too late indeed.

628
00:31:33,480 --> 00:31:34,480
I didn't eat garlic meat

629
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,480
for three and a half nights.

630
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,480
Today is a good day.

631
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:43,480
It's worth remembering.

632
00:31:43,480 --> 00:31:44,480
Where's the drawing book?

633
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,480
Take the drawing book out

634
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,480
and draw the picture of the garlic meat.

635
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,480
Draw the picture.

636
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:52,480
I'll draw it myself.

637
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,480
It's not here.

638
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,480
It should be that way.

639
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:06,480
Where should I put it?

640
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:10,480
I knew it.

641
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,480
Give it to me.

642
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:12,480
No.

643
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,480
No.

644
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,480
No wonder you don't want me to see it.

645
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:23,480
How can you draw it?

646
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
I didn't draw it for the garlic meat.

647
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,480
If you draw it like this,

648
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:28,480
our child will see it.

649
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,480
Then I won't be laughed at.

650
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:31,480
You don't have to draw it now.

651
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,480
It doesn't mean you won't be drawn.

652
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:35,480
I'm not good at drawing.

653
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:36,480
No.

654
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,480
I'm not good at drawing.

655
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,480
You're a blackboard.

656
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,480
No.

657
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:40,480
I'll have to tear it.

658
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:41,480
I can't.

659
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:42,480
I can't.

660
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:43,480
I'm so bad at drawing.

661
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,480
I'll tear it.

662
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:45,480
Give it to me.

663
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,480
I'll tear it.

664
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,480
Your Highness.

665
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,480
It's been three hours.

666
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,480
Did you sleep in the military?

667
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,480
Do you want to sleep in the sun?

668
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,480
Let me sleep for a while.

669
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:22,480
Get up.

670
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:24,480
Don't let the superiors wait.

671
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:26,480
Come on.

672
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,480
I'll go get you.

673
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:30,480
I'll go get you.

674
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,480
I'll go get you.

675
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,480
I'll go get you.

676
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:36,480
I'll go get you.

677
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:38,480
I'll go get you.

678
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,480
Wait here.

679
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,480
Come on.

680
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,480
I'll go get you.

681
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,480
I really think it's a long day.

682
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:51,480
It feels like a year.

683
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:53,480
What about you?

684
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,480
You can't see me.

685
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,480
Is it a year too?

686
00:33:57,480 --> 00:33:59,480
But you came back at night.

687
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:01,480
So it's not hard to see you in the daytime.

688
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,480
But it's hard to see you in the daytime.

689
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:06,480
All right.

690
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,480
Hurry up and finish those things.

691
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,480
You'll see me when you come back.

692
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,480
What are you going to do today?

693
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,480
I'm going to go to the seal restaurant with Taozi.

694
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,480
Don't go to the seal restaurant.

695
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:21,480
It's the best opportunity to send fish last time.

696
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:22,480
All right.

697
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:23,480
Get up and change.

698
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,480
When you catch up with those things,

699
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:29,480
you'll see me when you have a good time.

700
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:37,480
I'm sorry.

701
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Greetings, Miss.

702
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,480
Greetings, Prime Minister.

703
00:35:11,480 --> 00:35:14,480
I thought I'd never see you again.

704
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:16,480
Prime Minister,

705
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,480
how are you?

706
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,480
I'm fine.

707
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:24,480
I'm the leader of the army of the Yuan Cui family,

708
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,480
who is 400 yu-mings in Beizhou.

709
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,480
I came to ask for your help.

710
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,480
Prime Minister,

711
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
we're not in the same way.

712
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,480
Miss,

713
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:41,480
this is the serial blood of our 467 people.

714
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:43,480
Please take a look.

715
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:50,480
We're not afraid of being people

716
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,480
from the top and the bottom of Beizhou.

717
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:56,480
We're also people who can't bear to write this blood.

718
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,480
It's so tearful.

719
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
It's tearful.

720
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,480
Your Highness,

721
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:32,480
why are you so early today?

722
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:33,480
Are you going back to the palace?

723
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:35,480
Didn't you know that the Crown Princess and Taozi

724
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:36,480
went to Fengying House to eat?

725
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,480
I'm going to take the food and the storage

726
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,480
and take you to Fengying House.

727
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,480
Taozi is right.

728
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,480
He didn't tell me.

729
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,480
Let's go.

730
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,480
Let's give them a surprise.

731
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,480
All right.

732
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,480
I'm going to take the food and the storage

733
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,480
and take you to Fengying House.

734
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,480
Taozi is right.

735
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,480
He didn't tell me.

736
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,480
Let's go.

737
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,480
Let's give them a surprise.

738
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,480
All right.

739
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,480
Let's go.

740
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,480
Let's go.

741
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,480
Let's go.

742
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:43,480
Brother Yao,

743
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:45,480
how did you do this?

744
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,480
How did you deal with the younger brother and sister later?

745
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,480
Madam Sun really brought a female guest.

746
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:54,480
They met a guest today.

747
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,480
But they didn't order anything.

748
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,480
They sat in the room for a while

749
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,480
and then left.

750
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,480
They sat in the room for a while and then left?

751
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,480
Yes.

752
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,480
They didn't sit for long.

753
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,480
They probably stayed in the room for a while.

754
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,480
I went in and gave them a tea.

755
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:06,480
Then I found that they had left.

756
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,480
They even kept the money on the table.

757
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,480
Which room is that?

758
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,480
Take me to see it.

759
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,480
All right.

760
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,480
I'll take you upstairs.

761
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:21,480
Shiqing,

762
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,480
did the Crown Princess and Taozi

763
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:23,480
go back to the palace?

764
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,480
I'll go and see.

765
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:25,480
No.

766
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,480
Search this house.

767
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:28,480
Yes.

768
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:56,480
Shiqing.

769
00:38:58,480 --> 00:38:59,480
Wang więcej.

770
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,480
Goar.

771
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:22,040
Wang

772
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:23,040
I'll go.

773
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,120
This is Cui Lin.

774
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,320
Cui Yi's daughter.

775
00:39:45,520 --> 00:39:46,920
The crown princess consort of Linni.

776
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,120
Wu Yan.

777
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:50,240
We've already said it.

778
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:53,440
I used the talisman to lure Cui Lin out.

779
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:56,720
You'll help me bring Cui Lin here

780
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,160
to rest for now.

781
00:39:59,040 --> 00:39:59,840
Then,

782
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,200
I'll take Cui Lin away.

783
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:05,120
When Li Ni finds out that Cui Lin is missing,

784
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,320
she'll find out the truth.

785
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,880
Whether you can get what you want

786
00:40:11,120 --> 00:40:12,720
and kill Li Ni,

787
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,440
depends on your ability.

788
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:18,200
That's right. I promised you.

789
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:19,440
You promised me, too.

790
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,880
After the trial,

791
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,640
you'll give me the real talisman.

792
00:40:23,480 --> 00:40:24,760
After I take it,

793
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,000
even if I don't take it anymore,

794
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,000
I won't die in the bones.

795
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,280
That's right. I promised you, too.

796
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,080
Give me the talisman now.

797
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,680
I'll take Cui Lin away.

798
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:41,680
What about her?

799
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:46,960
Just let it go.
