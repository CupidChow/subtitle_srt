00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,580
Love in My��

2
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

3
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

4
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

6
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

7
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

8
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

9
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

10
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

11
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

12
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

14
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

15
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

18
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
The wind is blowing in the wind

19
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Wind Swomen

20
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:53,000
Episode 3

21
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:54,000
He Xiao Wei,

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,640
these are all mixed up by you.

23
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,200
Are you not willing to believe me?

24
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,320
I don't believe you!

25
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:11,520
Stop!

26
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,400
Gone!

27
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:36,240
Help!

28
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,760
Eagle arrive!

29
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,560
와!

30
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:51,880
Andrea!

31
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,440
Remember to look for the animals under the bridge!

32
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:55,200
No!

33
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,360
Work!

34
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,360
I know I won't believe anything.

35
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,360
But this time,

36
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
I really don't know what to do.

37
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,360
I didn't plan to kill you.

38
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:40,360
Take your Cui Jiajun and get out of here.

39
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,360
Next time, if you dare to show up in front of me,

40
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,360
I'll kill one.

41
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,360
I'll kill one.

42
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,360
I'll kill one.

43
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,360
I'll kill one.

44
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,360
I'll kill one.

45
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,360
I'll kill one.

46
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,360
Let go.

47
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,360
Thank you.

48
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,360
Thank you.

49
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,360
Since we got out of the prison,

50
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,360
I didn't expect that the big deal we signed

51
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,360
was because of this little guy who was killed by Cui.

52
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,360
Take our people.

53
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,360
Push Luoyao out of here.

54
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,360
I know.

55
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Xiao Wei,

56
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,360
time to eat.

57
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:43,360
The General Manager,

58
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:46,360
you must be a good model.

59
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,360
Yes, I am.

60
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,360
I'm a good model.

61
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,360
I've been asking for a long time.

62
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,360
The General Manager's mouth is very strict.

63
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,360
He only said that he paid for them.

64
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:00,360
He also said that he wanted them to be far away.

65
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,360
So that we can be away from each other.

66
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,360
I won't say anything else.

67
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,360
I just don't know anything about myself.

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,360
Xiao Wei, eat less.

69
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,360
After eating,

70
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,360
we'll make plans.

71
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,360
You're so polite.

72
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:24,360
You're so innocent.

73
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,360
You know nothing.

74
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,360
You're not only good at talking to me,

75
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,360
but you're also angry.

76
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,360
Cui's army

77
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,360
destroyed the whole army

78
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,360
and the whole army.

79
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,360
It's true.

80
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,360
If we can kill them,

81
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,360
if we can kill them,

82
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,360
I might not be able to calm down.

83
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
But I always thought

84
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,360
he would believe me.

85
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:07,360
All right.

86
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,360
Don't think too much.

87
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:11,360
He's so smart.

88
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,360
I think

89
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,360
he will understand.

90
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,360
Look at you.

91
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Shi Qi Lang,

92
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
why don't you trust me?

93
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,360
You've been keeping this for the whole night.

94
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm not sleepy.

95
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
I'm not sleepy.

96
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
You know,

97
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,360
no matter how much Xiao Wei

98
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,360
goes back to the hundredth century,

99
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,360
he's still a good talker.

100
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,360
Even if

101
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,360
he's a good talker,

102
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,360
he will still be a good talker.

103
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,360
He's a good talker.

104
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,360
But he's still a good talker.

105
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Even if he's lying to us,

106
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
he wouldn't dare to admit it.

107
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:41,360
Ying,

108
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,360
I've met you.

109
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:46,360
You sold the copper coffin.

110
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Ying,

111
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,360
Sun Jing promised

112
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,360
that as long as he and Li Ying

113
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,360
take the copper coffin,

114
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,360
after he's removed from the army,

115
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,360
he will immediately withdraw

116
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
his army to Yingzhou.

117
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,360
Of course,

118
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:00,360
the commander-in-chief will be dismissed.

119
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,360
How can you do that?

120
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,360
Why can't I do that?

121
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Do you want me to watch the commander-in-chief

122
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,360
be surrounded by the commander-in-chief?

123
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,360
Do you know

124
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,360
what we and the commander-in-chief are?

125
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
We have them.

126
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
It's just a dream.

127
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,360
You don't know

128
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Li Ni.

129
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,360
He's a rebel.

130
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,360
Who knows

131
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,360
if he takes down the Western capital in the future,

132
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,360
will he immediately withdraw from the army

133
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:21,360
and force our Cui's army

134
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
to withdraw?

135
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
How can you do that

136
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,360
without my help?

137
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,360
I did everything

138
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,360
to get Cui's army back.

139
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
These army

140
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,360
are just torturing some people.

141
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,360
They lost their copper coffin.

142
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,360
Li Ni is so powerful.

143
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
She can still fight back.

144
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,360
The Cui's army is not blood-sucking.

145
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,360
Shouldn't I just withdraw?

146
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,360
Of course, we should save her.

147
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,360
But Zhen Xi is a good fighter.

148
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:42,360
He's the one who made Cui's army fall down.

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:43,360
It's not your fault.

150
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,360
You're not worthy of being a traitor.

151
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,360
I did it

152
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,360
to save Ying Zhou.

153
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,360
Ying,

154
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,360
if you have family with Li Ni,

155
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,360
then the company won't be divided.

156
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,360
You're so selfish.

157
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,360
Do you think it's fair?

158
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:08,360
Sir,

159
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,360
let me catch him.

160
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,360
Tao Zi is with him.

161
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,360
He won't leave.

162
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,360
When he's gone,

163
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,360
he'll come back.

164
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
Xiao Wei,

165
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
why don't we go back first?

166
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,360
Actually,

167
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,360
you're doing this for Ying Zhou.

168
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:50,360
I'm not.

169
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,360
I'm just here to help you.

170
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,360
I'm here to help you.

171
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,360
I'm here to help you.

172
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
I'm here to help you.

173
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,360
I'm here to help you.

174
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,360
I'm here to help you.

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,360
I'm here to help you.

176
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,360
I know.

177
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,360
But he's doing this

178
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,360
for the sake of the company.

179
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,360
Don't be sad.

180
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,360
I'm not sad.

181
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,360
I'm just...

182
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,360
You're worried

183
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,360
that the Royal Descendant will never understand

184
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,360
and keep misunderstanding you?

185
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,360
I'm worried that the Royal Descendant will never understand

186
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,360
and keep misunderstanding you?

187
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,360
I'm worried that the Royal Descendant will never understand

188
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:38,360
and keep misunderstanding you?

189
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,360
Forget it.

190
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,360
Don't mention this person anymore.

191
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:45,360
Since he doesn't trust me,

192
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,360
then seeing him

193
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,360
is like meeting strangers.

194
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:57,360
When we meet again,

195
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,360
I'm afraid that we'll meet again.

196
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,360
We're not afraid of meeting again.

197
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,360
What's the difference between the Royal Descendant and me?

198
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
He'll definitely fight

199
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,360
against our general

200
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,360
when he's on the war.

201
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,360
To be honest,

202
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,360
when I was in Yingzhou,

203
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,360
I thought

204
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:23,360
that the world is full of ups and downs.

205
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
The Sun family

206
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,360
is so happy

207
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:30,360
that they're fighting for the hundred months.

208
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,360
They're just happy.

209
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,360
Only when they fight with the Sun family

210
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
to control the world,

211
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
can the people have a good life.

212
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,360
But I didn't expect

213
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:44,360
a person like Li Jiajuan

214
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
would be like this.

215
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,360
No matter how much you're disappointed,

216
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:53,360
how much you're proud,

217
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,360
how much you're happy,

218
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,360
it's all about the world.

219
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,360
It's about the people's good life.

220
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
Xiao Wei,

221
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,360
you've always thought that

222
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,360
except for yourself,

223
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,360
except for our Cui family,

224
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,360
no one can control the world.

225
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Yes.

226
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
But I didn't expect

227
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:27,360
a person like this to happen.

228
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
But...

229
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,360
Maybe it's the enemy in the future.

230
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Let's go back first.

231
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,360
You must be worried.

232
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Yuanxia,

233
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
I'm afraid that

234
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:57,360
Yuanxia

235
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:00,360
will only go back to Yingzhou.

236
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,360
Go back to see the general soon.

237
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,360
The general must be very happy.

238
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
Okay.

239
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,360
I'll get you some food.

240
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,880
Commentating on appen

241
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:25,360
Recently,

242
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,360
the Cui army has invaded

243
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,560
from thehelp of the sheet concealers.

244
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,360
and also the one who retreated from the輕 officers

245
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,360
But we're so일 ombrick that

246
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,360
we're afraid that Lord Lin Ziho will fall to right by now.

247
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,360
My brother

248
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,360
he baker and smart

249
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,480
Ame

250
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,360
was presentand I know

251
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:47,800
and not knowing what will happen to you.

252
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:48,800
Then

253
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,200
why must we retreat to Luo Yang?

254
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,560
Meltale

255
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,240
has just received these soldiers.

256
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,640
Prince Ling

257
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,360
is aware of the situation.

258
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
But, as long as you dad

259
00:14:59,480 --> 00:15:01,200
raising the invincible army

260
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:02,840
he wouldn't dare to waste the best.

261
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:04,960
Look.

262
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,840
He must have sent someone

263
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,680
to take this cold and short journey.

264
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:10,520
Qiolong.

265
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:11,720
Qiolong.

266
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:12,200
Speak.

267
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,960
Timerang heard we Aprilste пап

268
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,680
but he fell out from Luo Yang

269
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,200
and sent someone.

270
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,120
to ask for help.

271
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,280
Mr. Shiqi,

272
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:20,520
you're right.

273
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,640
Since that's the case,

274
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,840
we'll take it.

275
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:27,480
Pass the order.

276
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,000
We'll take the camp here

277
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,000
and take the whole day off.

278
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:31,160
We'll head to Luoyang.

279
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:32,520
Yes.

280
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:36,800
Brother.

281
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,400
Last time, you said you were tired of your defeat.

282
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,440
You wanted to send someone to send some food to the capital

283
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,400
and feed them.

284
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,680
I sent someone to send them.

285
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,960
But I didn't expect

286
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:47,680
he would take it all.

287
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:48,680
Brother.

288
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,200
This is the point of Li Ni's cunning.

289
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,200
He knew he would lose this time.

290
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:54,840
He must have taken

291
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,040
his and his army

292
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:58,040
and even took his brother's guilt.

293
00:15:58,760 --> 00:15:59,560
This is the reason

294
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,000
why he came here

295
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,160
to ask for your help.

296
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:04,280
I have to take this opportunity.

297
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,000
But the Xijun Army and tens of thousands of soldiers

298
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,240
were taken by Peixian.

299
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,840
They were all in the back.

300
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:11,520
What are you afraid of?

301
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,840
As long as Li Ni enters Luoyang,

302
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,800
you can discuss with the courtier

303
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,840
whether he will lose his army or not.

304
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:18,760
If so,

305
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,040
won't he be able to remove his military power

306
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:21,480
as soon as he takes it?

307
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,000
What if Peixian is not convinced?

308
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,000
Father has ascended the throne.

309
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:27,960
He is the emperor.

310
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:29,560
If he is not convinced,

311
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:31,040
he will be the emperor.

312
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:32,400
The emperor will be the emperor.

313
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:34,000
Everyone will be punished.

314
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,160
That's reasonable.

315
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,520
I will tell Li Ni right away.

316
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,720
Since he has lost his army,

317
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,480
I will take the army

318
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,840
and send them back to the court.

319
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:44,880
After that,

320
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,800
we will take the army.

321
00:16:46,760 --> 00:16:48,200
Why didn't you take this opportunity

322
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,280
to get rid of your father?

323
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,240
What you said is

324
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
the Cui family's army.

325
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,400
Exactly.

326
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:57,840
Didn't you borrow a pair of

327
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,120
strong-willed soldiers

328
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,400
to give them the Cui Li?

329
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,560
It's a pity that the Cui Li is so impulsive.

330
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:03,760
He asked Cui Li to run away.

331
00:17:04,120 --> 00:17:05,840
But he is against Li Ni's rescue.

332
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,000
I am also worried that

333
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,040
Cui Li is not sensible.

334
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,080
It's very painful

335
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,640
to expose this matter.

336
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,000
Brother.

337
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,040
This is the time

338
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,080
to let Cui Li

339
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:17,560
kill Cui Li.

340
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:18,320
Think about it.

341
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,920
Cui Li just sold his comrades.

342
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,760
Li Ni is against it.

343
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,080
She hates it.

344
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:24,600
And if Cui Li dies at this time,

345
00:17:24,960 --> 00:17:26,760
Cui Li will not suspect it.

346
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,080
He must think it's Li Ni's doing.

347
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,120
Cui Li means this.

348
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,720
If he is always a son,

349
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:33,960
he will definitely

350
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,160
live with Li Ni.

351
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,060
Xie Beig國 commander,

352
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,440
He belongs to

353
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,720
Cui Li.

354
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:54,160
It's something simple.

355
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:55,720
No way.

356
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,360
How can Zhell конечно

357
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:00,800
kill Cui Li?

358
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:03,720
No.

359
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,760
Nidhi is a eyesore

360
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,680
with lesspectancy.

361
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:11,500
On the막ivian Dam,

362
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:12,940
He's never happy when there's no one in town.

363
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:14,820
P WE will be filled with «M faint».

364
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,300
My father only sent a few days

365
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,460
to exchange my military horses.

366
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,820
The horses supply to Several Ultras.

367
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:34,700
We've to trade them

368
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:39,540
You sent someone to seizeäischen

369
00:18:39,540 --> 00:18:41,540
If he can take the promise

370
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:43,540
and ensure that he returns to Taicun,

371
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,540
he will ensure that he grows up and becomes a great man.

372
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
He will be promoted to the throne.

373
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,540
I will agree to return to the throne

374
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,540
to the crown prince.

375
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,540
Yes.

376
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:04,540
Father suddenly called my mother here.

377
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:05,540
I wonder what the key is.

378
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:08,540
I just got the news.

379
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:11,540
The army of Baiyue is defeated.

380
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:16,540
It's said that the capital is very crowded.

381
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:18,540
It's a secret news.

382
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,540
But this kind of thing,

383
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:21,540
the more the news is spread,

384
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:23,540
the faster the news is spread.

385
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,540
What do you think?

386
00:19:25,540 --> 00:19:28,540
In my opinion, if it's a real defeat,

387
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:30,540
the news will never spread so fast.

388
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,540
Father thinks this is a pure plan.

389
00:19:38,540 --> 00:19:39,540
Yes.

390
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:41,540
This is the moment when Sun Jing's shadow snake moves.

391
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,540
If at this time,

392
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:44,540
anyone dares to act rashly,

393
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:46,540
he will be shocked.

394
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,540
Ying.

395
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,540
Young Master.

396
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,540
Taozi.

397
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,540
I have something to tell Ying.

398
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,540
Yes.

399
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,540
Ying.

400
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,540
The military secretaries sent a message

401
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:27,540
that Sun Jing is defeated by the army of Baiyue.

402
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,540
He is defeated.

403
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:36,540
Ying.

404
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,540
Do you still have

405
00:20:38,540 --> 00:20:39,540
feelings for me?

406
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:43,540
Young Master, I even lied to you.

407
00:20:46,540 --> 00:20:47,540
It's just a heart attack.

408
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,540
It's because Sun Jing promised to

409
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:50,540
withdraw from Yingzhou

410
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:53,540
that I will exchange the same official.

411
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,540
Then why did you hide it from me?

412
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,540
Why did you lie to me?

413
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,540
Ying.

414
00:21:02,540 --> 00:21:04,540
We grew up together.

415
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,540
No matter what you think,

416
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:09,540
I regard you as my closest person.

417
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,540
I...

418
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,540
I never thought I would hide it from you.

419
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,540
I lied to you.

420
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,540
It's just because you went out with Li Ni.

421
00:21:19,540 --> 00:21:20,540
I don't want her to know.

422
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:25,540
Young Master, this is a good plan.

423
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:28,540
If I and Cui Jiajun are together,

424
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:30,540
Li Ni will follow me.

425
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,540
Then you will be in good shape.

426
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,540
I really want to know

427
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:37,540
what you are thinking about

428
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:40,540
for our Cui Jiajun's sake.

429
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:42,540
You are thinking about

430
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:43,540
what you are thinking about.

431
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:44,540
Is it because of Li Ni?

432
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
You want to forget the basics

433
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,540
and why we left Yingzhou?

434
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,540
Ying.

435
00:21:55,540 --> 00:21:56,540
You should go back and rest.

436
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:59,540
It's useless to talk more about it.

437
00:22:25,540 --> 00:22:26,540
If you think it's good,

438
00:22:27,540 --> 00:22:28,540
we can use the ten thousand soldiers

439
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,540
to attack the Western Wall.

440
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,540
You want ten thousand?

441
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,540
Didn't Sun Jing want to lure the snake out?

442
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,540
We will give her a chance to save herself.

443
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:38,540
She is a good person.

444
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,540
I will let her do the right thing.

445
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,540
Shi Xian.

446
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
I have something to tell you.

447
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,540
I have something to tell you.

448
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,540
I have something to tell you.

449
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
I have something to tell you.

450
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,540
I have something to tell you.

451
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,540
I have something to tell you.

452
00:22:53,540 --> 00:22:54,540
Shi Xian.

453
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:55,540
I have something to tell you.

454
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
What is it?

455
00:22:57,540 --> 00:22:58,540
Come here.

456
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,540
You can't talk in front of me.

457
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:02,540
Xiao Wei.

458
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
You have a fight with the Prince.

459
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,540
It's okay.

460
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,540
By the way,

461
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,540
the manager sent a message

462
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,540
saying that the army of 100 months has been defeated.

463
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,540
Sun Jing is currently in the lock-up.

464
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:19,540
If you say so,

465
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:22,540
there are not many soldiers around Sun Jing, right?

466
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,540
Xiao Wei.

467
00:23:24,540 --> 00:23:25,540
Shall we inform the general

468
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,540
to return to the capital with two forces?

469
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:29,540
No need.

470
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,540
I think it's a little bit of a threat.

471
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:35,540
Maybe it's not Sun Jing's plan.

472
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:37,540
What about the Royal Descendant?

473
00:23:39,540 --> 00:23:40,540
Who is it?

474
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:42,540
The one you don't want to mention.

475
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,540
Will he be in the trap?

476
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,540
Of course not.

477
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:48,540
He is bold and thoughtful.

478
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,540
He is rarely forced by the right wing.

479
00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:52,540
Sun Jing is a good person.

480
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,540
He must be able to make a mistake.

481
00:23:55,540 --> 00:23:57,540
And this matter is a chance

482
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,540
for him.

483
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:00,540
He won't let go of this chance.

484
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:02,540
Really?

485
00:24:03,540 --> 00:24:04,540
What will he do?

486
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:07,540
He will

487
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,540
save the world.

488
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,540
You mean,

489
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,540
Cui Li is still in the river to search for the ambush?

490
00:24:12,540 --> 00:24:13,540
That's right.

491
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,540
We have to meet the people

492
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:15,540
sent by General Pei

493
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:16,540
and set up the camp.

494
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,540
You know that

495
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:20,540
according to our military management,

496
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:21,540
before we choose the camp,

497
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:22,540
we must send a team

498
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:23,540
to search for the ambush.

499
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,540
My team is far away.

500
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:26,540
It's good to meet Cui Li

501
00:24:26,540 --> 00:24:27,540
and bring the new army with us.

502
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:29,540
It looks like

503
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,540
he is going to be in the camp overnight.

504
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,540
Since Cui Li is in the camp,

505
00:24:33,540 --> 00:24:34,540
of course he will send that Cui.

506
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:36,540
But

507
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:38,540
the He Xiao Wei is

508
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:40,540
with that Cui.

509
00:24:40,540 --> 00:24:42,540
Are we going to save or not?

510
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,540
No.

511
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,540
Really?

512
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,540
No.

513
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,540
Cui Li,

514
00:24:52,540 --> 00:24:53,540
let's go.

515
00:24:53,540 --> 00:24:54,540
Let's go.

516
00:24:55,540 --> 00:25:09,660
First Lady Qian's

517
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:13,540
Young Master,

518
00:25:13,540 --> 00:25:14,540
the V силian alien

519
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,540
went to meet him back at Yuzhu Mountain.

520
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:19,240
I order

521
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,540
the comrades

522
00:25:20,540 --> 00:25:50,540
The Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall

523
00:25:50,540 --> 00:26:20,540
of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of the Great Wall of

524
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:23,760
GreatUS, 3.500 staffs.

525
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:24,280
wheat

526
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,120
暗魔!

527
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:28,320
Don't make me take this

528
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:52,340
�

529
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:53,040
Tell us

530
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,000
What?

531
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,560
Zilang,

532
00:27:02,040 --> 00:27:03,440
we didn't get the last time.

533
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,920
We must succeed

534
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:06,640
in this trial.

535
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,760
If we can't kill Cui Lin this time,

536
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,960
we'll lose the wall of Prince Lingzi's Li Jun.

537
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:15,960
And once Cui Lin returns to the emperor,

538
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,000
he and Uncle won't let go.

539
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:19,920
No matter what,

540
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,920
Cui Lin must die.

541
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,080
Cui.

542
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:25,120
Do it.

543
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,520
Let it go.

544
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:25,040
I thought you were going to be a monk.

545
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,640
I think you're just a soft-hearted person.

546
00:30:23,300 --> 00:30:24,280
Go!

547
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:34,800
Master!

548
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:44,980
Why?

549
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,140
Why are you jointing with one another?

550
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:47,740
Mixed 겁니다.

551
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,960
This is the gatekeeper.

552
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:50,960
Master!

553
00:30:56,960 --> 00:30:57,960
Master!

554
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:04,960
Master!

555
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:08,960
Master!

556
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:17,960
Master!

557
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:21,960
Master!

558
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:50,960
Master!

559
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:14,960
Why did you kill Mr. Zai

560
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:15,960
even I didn't understand him?

561
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:18,960
You've been here for a long time.

562
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:20,960
You were here for this.

563
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:22,960
You did it on purpose!

564
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:25,960
Yes, I did.

565
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,960
I didn't expect you to succeed.

566
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,960
Your Highness,

567
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:56,960
this time, you killed Cui Lin

568
00:32:56,960 --> 00:32:58,960
and actually risked a lot.

569
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,960
But for your sake,

570
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
I know that.

571
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
You've worked hard.

572
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,960
I remember it all.

573
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:12,960
I won't let you down.

574
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:15,960
I'll do my best.

575
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,960
I won't let you down.

576
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:21,960
Your Highness,

577
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:22,960
please forgive me.

578
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,960
I'll kill you

579
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,960
in the future.

580
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,960
I'm the commander of Cui's army.

581
00:33:49,960 --> 00:33:51,960
General Cui of Pingliang.

582
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:53,960
Come up here.

583
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
There's a way out.

584
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,960
The capital is under my command.

585
00:33:58,960 --> 00:33:59,960
The Palace is surrounded by campers.

586
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
The enemy is fighting.

587
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
The enemy is fighting.

588
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,960
My whole family is under the command of the commander.

589
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:06,960
If I think about it,

590
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,960
my whole family will be in danger.

591
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:09,960
General Cui.

592
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,960
The enemy is under our command.

593
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:16,960
We're half dead.

594
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:17,960
Half of them escaped.

595
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:19,960
We'll follow them

596
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,960
and follow them to the western border.

597
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:25,960
General Cui.

598
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:27,960
General Cui.

599
00:34:27,960 --> 00:34:28,960
General Cui.

600
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:30,960
General Cui.

601
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:31,960
The army is attacking the campers.

602
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
They're surrounded.

603
00:34:32,960 --> 00:34:33,960
The enemy is in the water.

604
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:34,960
The enemy is in the water.

605
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,960
The enemy is under our command.

606
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:36,960
Where's the one with the army?

607
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:38,960
Where's He Xiaowei?

608
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:39,960
When the attack was over,

609
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:41,960
the army was in the left.

610
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,960
Some people were saved.

611
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,960
The commander of the army

612
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:44,960
was in the right.

613
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:45,960
He wrote a letter.

614
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:46,960
He sent someone to General Cui.

615
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:51,960
General Cui.

616
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:54,960
The army was in the left.

617
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:55,960
The enemy was surrounded.

618
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:56,960
The army was surrounded.

619
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:58,960
A Ying was saved by the army.

620
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,960
He was a great general.

621
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
A Ying was fine.

622
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:02,960
He was well-behaved.

623
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:03,960
He was well-behaved.

624
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:04,960
He was well-behaved.

625
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:05,960
He was well-behaved.

626
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:07,960
The army and I have been together.

627
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
The line of this shameless army

628
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
is番前之极.

629
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,960
How dare they shoot me?

630
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,320
in the future

631
00:35:38,260 --> 00:35:38,800
you can,

632
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,760
for insight

633
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:43,060
indeed

634
00:35:45,160 --> 00:35:46,020
I want

635
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,260
a few words

636
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:53,600
I never thought

637
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,100
it could be

638
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,380
so

639
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:01,920
maybe

640
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:02,760
Come.

641
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:09,920
Xiao Wei,

642
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:11,200
don't drink it.

643
00:36:18,240 --> 00:36:19,160
It's too hot.

644
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,720
I'll drink it later.

645
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,160
Don't be too sad.

646
00:36:26,240 --> 00:36:27,040
Young Master,

647
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,360
did you get saved by someone?

648
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,800
It's been so many days.

649
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,160
I don't have any news.

650
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,640
I'm afraid I'm too poor.

651
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,080
Maybe you got saved by someone.

652
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,000
But you were ill.

653
00:36:48,520 --> 00:36:50,160
So you couldn't come back.

654
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,680
All right, Tao Zi.

655
00:36:53,720 --> 00:36:54,840
Don't comfort me.

656
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,960
She was weak.

657
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:01,280
She got so badly injured.

658
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,720
She was in the river.

659
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,600
I'm afraid...

660
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,720
I'm afraid she'll never come back.

661
00:37:18,280 --> 00:37:20,280
She grew up with me.

662
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,160
In my heart,

663
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:29,080
she was like my brother.

664
00:37:30,080 --> 00:37:31,640
She was like my brother.

665
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,600
But I didn't expect...

666
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:43,480
I didn't expect her to die in the prison.

667
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:46,600
All right.

668
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:50,400
I know you must be sad now.

669
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:52,960
But you got injured.

670
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:54,400
You're injured, too.

671
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,480
You can't drink medicine.

672
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,760
We'll cure your wound.

673
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,200
We'll go back to Yingshou to see the general.

674
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,400
You're so mean.

675
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:13,320
Since you put us in the Taiqing Palace,

676
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,000
you won't let us out.

677
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:17,280
She's taking us as criminals.

678
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,640
Didn't I tell you?

679
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:21,880
Don't mention her in front of me.

680
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:24,320
I...

681
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:26,720
Go find some secret keys in the government.

682
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,320
It'll be better if you come back.

683
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,040
I can take it.

684
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:37,080
There's no secret key in the Taiqing Palace.

685
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:38,680
We can't go out to buy it.

686
00:38:40,480 --> 00:38:41,280
How about

687
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,160
I ask them to give me two boxes

688
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:44,440
and sell some teeth?

689
00:38:44,920 --> 00:38:46,480
I'll make you a toothful, okay?

690
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:49,040
I'll go right away.

691
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,780
Get...

692
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,600
Handsome.

693
00:38:59,660 --> 00:39:00,840
Take your car keys.

694
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:07,100
You're here.

695
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:15,440
I'm the criminal of the exodus army.

696
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:17,620
I won't die fast.

697
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:19,200
Is it more important to get you back?

698
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:20,920
I can't let you get angry.

699
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,240
I won't.

700
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:24,120
I don't need you to save me.

701
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,200
You don't need me.

702
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,520
You don't need me now.

703
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:29,080
Are you a group of people?

704
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,360
You must kill me and Taozi to avenge your death.

705
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:34,080
That's why you locked me and Taozi in the Taikin Palace

706
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:35,760
and use your own soldiers.

707
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:37,240
Aren't you afraid that your people

708
00:39:37,240 --> 00:39:39,000
will come out and kill us?

709
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,480
A'Ying.

710
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,840
I understand what's going on with Tong Guan.

711
00:39:41,840 --> 00:39:43,280
You don't know it.

712
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,000
You're a high-ranking person.

713
00:39:45,000 --> 00:39:46,720
You've always been a good-for-nothing.

714
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,880
You don't care about the other's tricks.

715
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,600
You don't care about the other's tricks.

716
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:51,920
It's not your fault.

717
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,520
If it's really your fault,

718
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:55,640
you'll be ashamed to admit it.

719
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:57,360
So, I'm wronged.

720
00:39:57,360 --> 00:39:59,840
You're not wronged.

721
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:01,040
It's me.

722
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:04,040
I killed your army's brother.

723
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,960
You killed me.

724
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,360
Why did you save me in the Taikin Palace?

725
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,800
I'm sorry.

726
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,640
I know I shouldn't have believed you.

727
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:13,800
But that day was sudden.

728
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,800
We've been dead for so many days.

729
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,360
I'll be able to understand you

730
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,360
and misunderstand you.

731
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:28,840
Get out. I don't want to see you.

732
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,720
All right.

733
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:08,760
Xiao Wei.

734
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:10,000
You told me it was a coincidence.

735
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,280
Actually,

736
00:41:11,840 --> 00:41:13,760
I'm engineer.

737
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:15,000
I'm carrying a patient for midnight,

738
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,600
so I always stay up all day for two days.

739
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,440
I didn't expect

740
00:41:18,680 --> 00:41:20,720
Luo Yang's order

741
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:22,360
to give Li Ni's order.

742
00:41:22,840 --> 00:41:23,880
I don't have to say

743
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,880
I took some first.

744
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,560
I tried it.

745
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:27,400
It's not poisonous.

746
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:28,600
It tastes good.

747
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:35,320
What should I do?

748
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
Nothing.

749
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:42,040
I just drank the medicine.

750
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:44,920
I just picked up an old mouse.

751
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,000
I prefere hunting with something at anytime.

752
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:48,560
It helps when old mouse is low.

753
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,120
It5s the centipede.

754
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:06,160
Come on.

755
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:10,920
Why not studied

756
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:12,160
the tav boys

757
00:42:12,440 --> 00:42:13,920
without my kid's order?

758
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:16,120
I bother our husbands

759
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,360
for spending a while

760
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:18,160
away from their Some.

761
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,080
I wasted my night away from our非.

762
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:24,840
Okay,

763
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,840
I'll make some medicine for you.

764
00:42:41,480 --> 00:42:42,560
The wielderai wound下來 will soon be Privy.

765
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:43,280
What's wrong?

766
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,000
Is there any news from Yingzhou?

767
00:42:46,840 --> 00:42:47,680
Cui Yi.

768
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,160
He's really a good man.

769
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:51,840
Sun Jing's army was crushed by him.

770
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,280
And Cui Yi was chased.

771
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,760
He was about to retreat.

772
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,040
What did Cui Yi say?

773
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,320
He was in a bad mood.

774
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,480
He agreed to our condition.

775
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,520
But this old fox

776
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:03,760
wants us to kill Cui Li.

777
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:06,760
I guess he wants to avenge his son.

778
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:09,480
Brother,

779
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,000
what's the responsibility?

780
00:43:11,080 --> 00:43:12,240
Cui Li is hiding in his place.

781
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,240
If he's fine,

782
00:43:14,680 --> 00:43:15,960
he'll definitely give Cui Li

783
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,440
some of the wind-sweeping grass.

784
00:43:18,760 --> 00:43:19,400
Yes.

785
00:43:20,040 --> 00:43:20,720
Shi Qing Lang.

786
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:22,760
The people in the Taiqing Palace

787
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,520
never had a plan to kill Cui Li.

788
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:25,640
And Cui Yi is the one

789
00:43:25,640 --> 00:43:26,920
who's going to keep the power.

790
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,120
I'll definitely

791
00:43:28,520 --> 00:43:30,440
explain to the army.

792
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:31,480
And

793
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:33,280
since Cui Yi agreed to

794
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:34,360
leave with us,

795
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,360
he's avenged by his brothers.

796
00:43:41,440 --> 00:43:42,480
But Shi Qing Lang,

797
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,920
you're going to be a coward in the Taiqing Palace.

798
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,760
The one who's going to be the heir

799
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,680
of the Hexiao Wei is the commander of the Zhengxi Army.

800
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,480
You two are trying to get me out of this.

801
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,400
It's not right.

802
00:43:55,080 --> 00:43:56,240
A'Yong, I've told you.

803
00:43:58,480 --> 00:43:59,560
I'm the one who's going to lose him.

804
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:01,240
But Shi Qing Lang, remember this.

805
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:03,240
His Majesty has already ascended the throne.

806
00:44:03,480 --> 00:44:04,760
You're the son of His Majesty.

807
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:05,960
You're the commander of the Zhengxi Army.

808
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,200
You can't marry the commander of the Zhengxi Army.

809
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:09,480
Even if you're a man of the past,

810
00:44:09,480 --> 00:44:13,120
you can't marry the commander of the Zhengxi Army.

811
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:15,240
You know you can't marry him.

812
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,040
Why don't you just break up with him?

813
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:25,400
Shi Qing Lang,

814
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:29,240
you know very well

815
00:44:29,520 --> 00:44:30,680
that the future marriage

816
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:32,760
will be the heir of His Majesty.

817
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,920
The one who's going to be the heir

818
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,000
will be the heir of the Qing Dynasty.

819
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:37,840
Even if you ask His Majesty,

820
00:44:38,080 --> 00:44:39,360
he'll find a man

821
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,800
who can be the heir of His Majesty.

822
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,960
Shi Qing Lang,

823
00:44:44,680 --> 00:44:46,240
you can't marry him.

824
00:44:49,040 --> 00:44:50,640
I'll leave now.
