I know what you want to say.

165
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,480
But this time,

But father can't persuade me.

00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,480
Because my father wants me to let go.

00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:28,480
If you can't hold me,

180
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,480
what should I do?

181
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,480
I can't let go.

182
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,480

But they are dead.

197
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,480
I regret it.

198
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,480
If I could run faster,

199
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:08,480
and more,

200
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
they wouldn't die.

201
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,480
They wouldn't die.

202
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
They wouldn't die.

203
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,480
They wouldn't die.

204
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
I don't want to do this.

205
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
I don't want to do this.

206
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Enough.

207
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:28,480
It's not your fault.

208
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,480
It's not your fault.

209
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:31,480
It's not your fault.

210
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:32,480
I want to do this.

211
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,480
You and Prince Qin

212
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,480
are really destined to save him.

213
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
It's not your fault.

214
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,480
It's true.

215
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
It's not your fault.

216
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
It's not your fault.

217
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Prince Qin.

218
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,480
Prince Qin.

219
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Prince Qin.

220
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,480
Prince Qin.

221
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,480
Prince Qin.

222
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Prince Qin.

223
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:14,480
Prince Qin.

224
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:19,480
Miss.

225
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,480
Miss.

226
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:23,480
Prince Qin is gone.

227
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:43,480
Prince Qin.

228
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,480
Prince Qin is gone.

229
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:00,980
Prince Qin.

230
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Our brothers

231
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:03,480
are not so capable.

232
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,480
They are all bananas,

233
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:06,480
but they still pass with others.

234
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,980
A lot

235
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:26,280
Throw shotgun

236
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,480
Brother

237
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:43,640
Share this.

238
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,480
Three whole legs.

239
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:50,660
Four whole legs.

240
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:17,080
Let Yun Celthus

241
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:18,640
give it

242
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:25,540
already

243
00:23:25,920 --> 00:23:27,080
we have discussed

244
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:28,140
waiting for the既 old

245
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,820
and do not政府

246
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:29,920
us

247
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,940
all back the thirdスト

248
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,120
if you're bored

249
00:23:33,140 --> 00:23:33,980
just come see us

250
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,240
come see us

251
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:37,560
good night

252
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,520
no matter what

253
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,240
thank you

254
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:46,080
When the sky is blue

255
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:52,720
When the moon is dark

256
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,520
When the sun is red

257
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,040
When the life is short

258
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:13,040
When the bitter time is not flowing

259
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:19,040
When the tears are a little bit dry

260
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:27,040
When the past has already disappeared

261
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:32,040
When the past is not behind

262
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:38,040
Do you still remember?

263
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:46,040
Do you still remember?

264
00:24:46,040 --> 00:24:51,040
Do you still remember?

265
00:24:53,040 --> 00:25:00,040
With the love thought, the bitter time has passed

266
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:11,480
May I still hold onto your father's words?

267
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,480
My love is expletive.

268
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,580
Calm down.

269
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:06,200
Be patient.

270
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,860
I'm not worried.

271
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,540
It'sınç!

272
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,780
Do you know

273
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,200
But those days,

274
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,800
when you were unconscious,

275
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:39,760
the doctor said

276
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,960
you were too badly injured

277
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,200
and you could never wake up again.

278
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:47,640
At that time,

279
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,320
I wanted to kneel down

280
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,520
to all the people in this world

281
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,440
and make a wish.

282
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,240
You once said

283
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:02,520
just add the Tomorrow reductions

284
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:05,960
when that night falls again.

285
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,280
When the will of god

286
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,960
wins the future,

287
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:20,040
Bodhisittvaken

288
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:23,360
advised himself

289
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:28,560
how to fix it yourself and fall off.

290
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:30,140
Yanming!

291
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,660
Dr. Hu,

292
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:33,020
where is she?

293
00:27:33,100 --> 00:27:34,020
What happened?

294
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:34,800
Music stands held still.

295
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,860
Weiwen,

296
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,480
you have an upper hand,

297
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:39,820
let alone your bum.

298
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,500
Empty with my cigarette.

299
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,360
I supposeлагienen

300
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:47,880
upstairs was an empty room in the bars.

301
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:50,420
Then Art ان

302
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:51,860
girl was often

303
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,300
buys a Mercedes.

304
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,060
drifting away

305
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,740
ナ

306
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:58,740
I know you feel sad.

307
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,740
But

308
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:05,740
we have to live well.

309
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:07,740
We have to live

310
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,740
to know why they died.

311
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,740
We have to live

312
00:28:14,740 --> 00:28:15,740
to have hope

313
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,740
to save more people.

314
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:23,740
I know

315
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:25,740
so...

316
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:55,740
I know

317
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,740
why they are all dead.

318
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,740
His Majesty is alive.

319
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:10,740
He is just a new emperor.

320
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:14,740
I know.

321
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:26,740
I feel so bad.

322
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,740
I feel so bad.

323
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,740
His Majesty

324
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:31,740
the imperial physician just asked for a safe delivery.

325
00:29:32,740 --> 00:29:33,740
He said he is fine.

326
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,740
But

327
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:36,740
I still feel

328
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,740
my whole body is very hurt.

329
00:29:40,740 --> 00:29:41,740
I just close my eyes

330
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:44,740
and feel like I'm being killed by a assassin.

331
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,740
I can't sleep

332
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,740
because I'm not sleeping.

333
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:52,740
I'm just waiting for you.

334
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:54,740
Your Majesty,

335
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:56,740
you are so surprised.

336
00:29:57,740 --> 00:29:58,740
If you were a commoner,

337
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,740
you would have been scared.

338
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,740
You are just a little bit of a stranger.

339
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,740
You are already a commoner

340
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,740
who has been in trouble.

341
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:09,740
You are right.

342
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:11,740
But

343
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:15,740
but I really feel so hurt.

344
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:17,740
You said

345
00:30:17,740 --> 00:30:19,740
you can only recover when you are well.

346
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:20,740
Your Majesty

347
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:22,740
since you are not well,

348
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:24,740
then you should appoint Prince Qin

349
00:30:24,740 --> 00:30:25,740
as the crown prince

350
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:27,740
and lead the crown prince to be the crown prince.

351
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:31,740
Prince Qin is also seriously injured.

352
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:34,740
He is still recovering.

353
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
Your Majesty,

354
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:38,740
Prince Qin is young.

355
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
He will recover

356
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,740
if he is seriously injured.

357
00:30:41,740 --> 00:30:42,740
Your Majesty,

358
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:43,740
the crown prince is very important.

359
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:45,740
If he doesn't recover well,

360
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:47,740
it will cause a big trouble.

361
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:53,740
Prince Qin and Prince Qi are so good.

362
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,740
I didn't expect

363
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:57,740
to be used by the接-sher.

364
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:00,740
I heard that the接-sher is good at taking medicine.

365
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:02,740
They must

366
00:31:03,740 --> 00:31:04,740
have given Prince Qin and Prince Qin

367
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:06,740
a magic drug.

368
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
So they will

369
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,740
change their lives.

370
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:11,740
Your Majesty,

371
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
Prince Qin and Prince Qi

372
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:14,740
are both in the same family.

373
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,740
They are innocent.

374
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,740
According to the law,

375
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:17,740
they should be executed

376
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,740
as soon as they are hungry.

377
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:20,740
But Your Majesty,

378
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,740
they are too generous.

379
00:31:21,740 --> 00:31:22,740
They should be executed

380
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,740
as soon as they are hungry.

381
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:26,740
And they should be executed.

382
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,740
Enough.

383
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,740
I know.

384
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,740
Your Majesty,

385
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:31,740
General Cui has already

386
00:31:31,740 --> 00:31:33,740
suppressed the接-sher's talisman.

387
00:31:33,740 --> 00:31:35,740
Why don't you appoint Prince Qin

388
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:36,740
as the crown prince

389
00:31:36,740 --> 00:31:37,740
and lead the crown prince to be the crown prince?

390
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,740
I just don't want to see

391
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:40,740
the接-sher.

392
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,740
When I think of them,

393
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:47,740
I think of my son.

394
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,740
Then,

395
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,740
I will give the order to Li Bu

396
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:57,740
to appoint the crown prince.

397
00:31:58,740 --> 00:31:59,740
Your Majesty,

398
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,740
there is one more thing

399
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:01,740
that I need to ask you to decide.

400
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
After the Bai Shui Pass was over,

401
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:05,740
General Cui retreated to Lingzhou.

402
00:32:05,740 --> 00:32:06,740
The military expenses

403
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:07,740
in the state were tens of thousands of dollars.

404
00:32:08,740 --> 00:32:09,740
Look at our military department.

405
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,740
It's really...

406
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:15,740
My head hurts.

407
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:17,740
This...

408
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,740
These...

409
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,740
These messy things,

410
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,740
I will go ask the crown prince.

411
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:23,740
But, Your Majesty,

412
00:32:23,740 --> 00:32:24,740
there is one more thing

413
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:25,740
that I need to ask you to decide.

414
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,740
The Cui Army

415
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:28,740
is using the old-fashioned palace.

416
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:30,740
How can we award it?

417
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,740
How can we award it?

418
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,740
Cui's daughter

419
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:36,740
will soon be the crown prince.

420
00:32:37,740 --> 00:32:38,740
And Cui Yi

421
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,740
has already become

422
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,740
the general of the double-deed.

423
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,740
How can we award her

424
00:32:43,740 --> 00:32:44,740
as the crown prince?

425
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,740
How can we award her?

426
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,740
Your Majesty,

427
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,740
I am about to say that

428
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:50,740
the king of Qin is the crown prince.

429
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,740
But Cui's daughter

430
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,740
will not be the crown princess.

431
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,740
Cui Yi

432
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:58,740
is going to

433
00:32:58,740 --> 00:32:59,740
transfer a maid

434
00:32:59,740 --> 00:33:00,740
from many princes?

435
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,740
Your Majesty,

436
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,740
this is a very different time.

437
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,740
Sun Jing just died.

438
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:07,740
The country is not stable.

439
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:08,740
His Majesty is still in power.

440
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:10,740
The Cui family is very powerful

441
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:11,740
and has occupied the capital.

442
00:33:11,740 --> 00:33:12,740
He can

443
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
visit Sun Jing anytime.

444
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:14,740
So,

445
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,740
he is afraid to go to the court.

446
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:16,740
He is afraid to go to the court.

447
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:18,740
He is asked to be the crown prince.

448
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,740
But His Majesty

449
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,740
has not agreed to it.

450
00:33:20,740 --> 00:33:21,740
It's just that

451
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Han Hu Qi Ci.

452
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:26,740
You are right.

453
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:28,740
I have never agreed to it.

454
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,740
He thought he would go to the memorial.

455
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,740
I have to go to the memorial.

456
00:33:35,740 --> 00:33:36,740
But, Your Majesty,

457
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,740
I am afraid

458
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,740
it's a bit different.

459
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:40,740
His Majesty is famous for his great power.

460
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:41,740
So,

461
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:42,740
Han Hu Qi Ci is different.

462
00:33:43,740 --> 00:34:03,380
If Qu Shi N

463
00:34:03,380 --> 00:34:06,740
can never be the crown princess.

464
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:07,740
But.

465
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:08,740
His Majesty

466
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:10,740
is very attentive

467
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,740
to his highness.

468
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,580
How could the Crown Prince...

469
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:14,380
Li Ni hasn't become the Crown Prince yet.

470
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:15,260
Besides,

471
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,860
even if he is the Crown Prince,

472
00:34:17,340 --> 00:34:18,740
he can't stand

473
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,300
the imperial father's disobeying?

474
00:34:22,420 --> 00:34:24,020
The marriage of the people

475
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,580
is all my parents' fate.

476
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,500
I'm not lying.

477
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:32,300
Since I'm the Crown Prince,

478
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,140
the Crown Prince will be chosen.

479
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:37,940
I should at least say it.

480
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:39,500
Come.

481
00:34:40,220 --> 00:34:41,380
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

482
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:45,300
General Pei is also a good person.

483
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:46,420
Actually, the Crown Prince

484
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,140
may not be willing to marry the daughter of the Cui family.

485
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:51,180
Your Majesty is right.

486
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:54,420
The Crown Prince should have the military power

487
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,540
to protect the country and the country.

488
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,780
The crown prince chosen by the emperor

489
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:02,940
is not that jealous?

490
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,260
You...

491
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:13,380
You're just a confidence person.

492
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,780
You...

493
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,580
You said let me marry you.

494
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,060
So now you know it's a time of画 bullets.

495
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:20,700
How do you know the answer?

496
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:23,740
Fine, I can give you the answer.

497
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:26,500
That's right.

498
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,260
Yuzhan,

499
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,340
what do you have for me?

500
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:33,620
Your Majesty.

501
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,420
No need.

502
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:36,220
Come.

503
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:37,100
Drink that.

504
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,500
I didn't expect General Pei to be here.

505
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,900
He just sent a servant to visit me.

506
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:43,500
He said he couldn't take it.

507
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,660
He said there was no one in the mansion.

508
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,220
I guess he didn't see anyone.

509
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,780
Prince Qin was seriously injured.

510
00:35:50,980 --> 00:35:52,100
He just woke up.

511
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:55,180
It's also a good thing to see an outsider.

512
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,380
How can I be an outsider?

513
00:35:57,740 --> 00:35:59,460
When my grandmother was still alive,

514
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,460
I often went to Prince Qin's Mansion with you.

515
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,580
I didn't see anyone who treated us as outsiders.

516
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,900
Besides,

517
00:36:05,340 --> 00:36:06,500
that Miss Cui

518
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:08,540
didn't come out of Prince Qin's Mansion.

519
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,540
She was with Prince Qin without permission.

520
00:36:11,020 --> 00:36:13,100
How can we be an outsider?

521
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:17,740
Your Highness is different from before.

522
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:20,260
Since we went to Prince Qin's Mansion,

523
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:21,980
Your Highness was reading

524
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,820
the love letter I sent for her.

525
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,380
Now that she's gone,

526
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:28,260
I can't see her anymore.

527
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,780
It's normal.

528
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,300
Why is Your Highness different from before?

529
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:36,420
Prince Qin was sick.

530
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,740
Prince Qin was seriously injured.

531
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
His Majesty has three sons.

532
00:36:43,180 --> 00:36:44,980
He's only one left.

533
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:46,740
Do you think

534
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:49,380
Prince Qin can be like the previous one?

535
00:36:49,460 --> 00:36:50,220
Your Highness,

536
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:52,420
you're going to be the Crown Princess now?

537
00:36:53,220 --> 00:36:54,020
Cui.

538
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:55,660
When you're in the position of the Crown Prince,

539
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:56,780
you can't be too reckless.

540
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:59,380
Just because you're so reckless,

541
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:01,460
you should punish your own father.

542
00:37:02,060 --> 00:37:03,060
Remember,

543
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,220
you can't be reckless anymore.

544
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:07,220
Yes.

545
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:35,300
It's getting cold.

546
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,380
I'll make you a dress.

547
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,180
There are so many dresses in this mansion.

548
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,660
You always said

549
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,780
I didn't do anything for you.

550
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:49,540
So,

551
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:52,340
I want to make you a dress.

552
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,220
Here.

553
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,500
Let me get you a drink.

554
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,580
thoughts

555
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:09,440
I'd rather have look around the alike design

556
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:15,540
Let me see.

557
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:36,140
Thank you for youresta

558
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,460
You've got Headam

559
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:40,340
now

560
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,220
You never did for me

561
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:45,820
How do you know about it?

562
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:54,180
I've kept you before

563
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,020
So I knew it

564
00:38:58,260 --> 00:38:59,820
I haven't kept you before

565
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,220
I keep you

566
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:07,900
and light shards of smoke on your sword.

567
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,120
It's not your spell.

568
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,180
Look.

569
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:38,700
Bring it Bean.

570
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:39,820
Bean.

571
00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:41,100
Bean.

572
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:42,300
Bean.

573
00:39:42,300 --> 00:39:43,220
Put all of the beans in.

574
00:39:44,900 --> 00:39:46,260
Divide it into one dan.

575
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,420
Look.

576
00:39:56,180 --> 00:39:57,540
More of that.

577
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,140
Look.

578
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:01,980
What?

579
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:03,900
No.

580
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Look at your left sleeve.

581
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,340
What's inside?

582
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,220
Nothing?

583
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,620
Then touch your sleeve.

584
00:40:25,140 --> 00:40:25,860
Your right.

585
00:40:26,540 --> 00:40:27,340
Mine?

586
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:32,140
Okay.

587
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,980
doesn't cover uselessness but your true colors.

588
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:05,940
You're a fool.

589
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,060
In my life,

590
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,720
you tried to volvularily

591
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:13,140
plug me in and hide in my Chanel.

592
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,620
Can't I

593
00:41:17,780 --> 00:41:18,780
realize

594
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:20,580
such a big Darwin Обdue?

595
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,980
Hmm?

596
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:35,140
You are the memory of my memory

597
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:38,140
I am heartless

598
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:42,140
You are the longing for a long time

599
00:41:42,140 --> 00:41:46,140
Time is different

600
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,140
I am willing to be with you

601
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:57,140
But the world is so cruel

602
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,140
The Water

603
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,140
Review 4 hommes

604
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:26,780
If you forget to speak message

605
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:32,780
Waiting for your memories being burned into ashes

606
00:42:34,780 --> 00:42:39,580
If I walked on the rock in your heart

607
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:46,780
That is so difficult

608
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:52,780
If the thoughts never come to mind

609
00:43:52,780 --> 00:43:54,780
I will wait for you to sing

610
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:59,780
I will wait for you to sing

611
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:05,780
I will remember the promise I made to you

612
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,780
I will not be afraid of you

613
00:44:08,780 --> 00:44:13,780
I will love you

614
00:44:13,780 --> 00:44:17,780
I will wait for you to sing

615
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:24,780
I will wait for you to sing
