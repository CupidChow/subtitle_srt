1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,780
The Founder

2
00:00:14,540 --> 00:00:16,900
We planet r?'

3
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,140
Your Heartсhy beat

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:23,840
Lines cloth

5
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,020
Threaten waves

6
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:33,020
My night has passed, and the night has become long

7
00:00:35,020 --> 00:00:40,020
I want to forget the scene of the dark night

8
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:43,020
The long and long journey

9
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,020
When the encounter is parting, when the encounter is far away

10
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:53,020
I will never forget

11
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:57,020
The light of the sword is shining

12
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:02,020
The sky is broken, how many lights are there?

13
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:06,020
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:11,020
The sky is full of clouds, the sky is full of clouds

15
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:14,020
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

16
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
The cold snow is cold, the cold wind is cold

17
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,020
The moon is singing, I will let you be by my side

18
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:24,020
I will never forget

19
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,020
The sky is full of clouds, the sky is full of clouds

20
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:31,020
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

21
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:38,020
I will never forget

22
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:47,720
rique

23
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,180
I want to know what they are going to say

24
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:12,220
at the visit to the lioness.

25
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,820
Mr. He.

26
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Come.

27
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:28,980
Smoothian.

28
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,180
Please.

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:31,180
Uncle.

30
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:33,980
Uncle.

31
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:38,980
Uncle.

32
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,980
Uncle.

33
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:46,380
Young Master.

34
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,580
Young Master, you're awake.

35
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:51,580
Young Master, you're finally awake.

36
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:55,980
Xiaowei.

37
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,380
Xiaowei, I'm fine.

38
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,980
I'm really fine.

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,020
I saw the army of Zhenxi

40
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,020
rush down from the mountain.

41
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,580
It saved him.

42
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:05,380
Young Master, please take care of yourself.

43
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:07,980
Why did you go back to see Xiaowei?

44
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,180
Here.

45
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,180
General.

46
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,180
General.

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,580
General.

48
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:01,980
It's good that you're back.

49
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,980
Prince Qi.

50
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:24,580
Prince Qi, I've sent someone to send you back to the camp.

51
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,380
As for your father,

52
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:28,180
since you're here,

53
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,380
you can take him away.

54
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,980
I'm so grateful to you

55
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,180
for your kindness.

56
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Since Prince Qi is here,

57
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,580
I'd better take a look.

58
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:50,380
Okay, I see.

59
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:53,380
We're finally back.

60
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,780
You finally see the general.

61
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:57,580
My father is thin.

62
00:04:58,580 --> 00:04:59,580
Don't worry.

63
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,380
I forgot that General is a spirit.

64
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,780
He's strong and strong.

65
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:05,380
Don't worry, Xiaowei.

66
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:09,980
Xiaowei, you're really not worried?

67
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:11,980
What?

68
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,180
This is the Cui family's camp.

69
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,180
Li Nian

70
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,780
wouldn't dare to do anything to my father.

71
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:18,580
I'm not talking about this.

72
00:05:18,980 --> 00:05:19,980
I'm talking about

73
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,580
if you're not worried,

74
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,580
how will the general be?

75
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:26,980
You said the general asked the general

76
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,780
if he'd take the bow.

77
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:29,980
As soon as he goes in,

78
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,180
he'll be defeated.

79
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,180
He'll be killed.

80
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
Don't worry.

81
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:34,780
I won't.

82
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:37,780
Xiaowei,

83
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:39,380
do you believe in Prince Qin

84
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:41,180
or the general?

85
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,780
You're so sure.

86
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:45,980
I don't believe

87
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,380
these two.

88
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,980
Why is this hairpin

89
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:54,180
on Prince Qin?

90
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,780
It's from Miss Cui.

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,980
Do you think

92
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:00,780
you can be free

93
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:01,980
from this?

94
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,580
General Cui, you're mistaken.

95
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,580
Miss Cui is here today.

96
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,380
She has something important to discuss with General Cui.

97
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:21,580
I'm afraid Prince Qin wants to borrow my military power.

98
00:06:22,580 --> 00:06:24,580
Let's take it back to the Western Changjing.

99
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:29,580
Prince Qin used to write a letter to break the law.

100
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:32,780
He sent Xiaoyu back today.

101
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,580
I think Prince Qin thinks

102
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:38,580
I don't dare to marry

103
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:40,580
the general of Prince Qin.

104
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,980
But

105
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:48,580
I'm afraid

106
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,580
I believe

107
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,380
these two.

108
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:55,380
What are you talking about?

109
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,580
I don't understand.

110
00:06:56,780 --> 00:06:58,180
What are you so anxious about?

111
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,780
I almost forgot.

112
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,180
Is it because of the Western Changjing?

113
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,180
So you're worried that

114
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,780
the general killed Prince Qin.

115
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:06,980
And the people of Prince Qin

116
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,180
killed him together.

117
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:09,380
Xiaowei,

118
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,580
I'm serious.

119
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,980
You'll beat me up.

120
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,580
General,

121
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,380
Father.

122
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:23,780
Time to eat.

123
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,980
Let me try the noodles I cooked for you.

124
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,380
It smells good.

125
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,180
Yang,

126
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,580
why don't you ask

127
00:07:34,980 --> 00:07:36,380
where Prince Qin went?

128
00:07:39,580 --> 00:07:41,180
Did Father

129
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,180
kill Prince Qin?

130
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,580
How dare he to bite my daughter

131
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180
and write a letter to break my law?

132
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:48,780
Shouldn't he have killed her?

133
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
Father

134
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,980
also deducted his brother

135
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:54,180
and his father.

136
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,980
So you think Prince Qin

137
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,980
can only send me back?

138
00:07:58,380 --> 00:07:59,380
It's a deal.

139
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
In this way,

140
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,980
my father will be in trouble.

141
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,580
I want to ask you.

142
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,180
Why did you give your mother

143
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,180
the hairpin

144
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,580
to Prince Qin?

145
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:10,980
He won.

146
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:12,380
I gave him the hairpin.

147
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:13,780
What bet?

148
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:14,780
It's worth you

149
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,780
giving your mother the hairpin

150
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:16,980
to make a hairpin.

151
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,580
It's like this, Father.

152
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:21,580
When he was in Bingzhou,

153
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,380
Han Li didn't recognize him.

154
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,580
Li Ni and I

155
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,180
were all worried about him.

156
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:28,380
So we bet.

157
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:29,980
If he wins,

158
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:30,980
the other person

159
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,180
will help him

160
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,380
escape successfully.

161
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:34,380
The loser

162
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,180
will stay in Bingzhou

163
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,980
to be the successor.

164
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:37,780
Li Ni lost.

165
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,380
So he helped me

166
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,380
escape first.

167
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:41,980
I gave my hairpin

168
00:08:42,180 --> 00:08:43,580
to him as a hairpin.

169
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,580
Nonsense.

170
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:46,180
You won.

171
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:47,980
Why did you give him the hairpin?

172
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:51,380
Did he

173
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:54,580
lose to you on purpose?

174
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,180
Father.

175
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,380
Ying.

176
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,780
Don't be fooled by him.

177
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,980
If he lost to you on purpose,

178
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,380
you would be in trouble.

179
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,980
How could you know?

180
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,180
Father.

181
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,380
Is your father so stupid?

182
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,780
That's not good.

183
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,780
He suddenly got confused.

184
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:17,980
Anyway,

185
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,580
he lied to my daughter.

186
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,380
He was afraid you would be in Taiqing Palace.

187
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:22,780
That's a pity.

188
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:24,780
Yes, it is.

189
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,380
Now Li Ni

190
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,180
is in my hands.

191
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:31,980
Kill him.

192
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:34,380
I can feel the evil spirit.

193
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:35,980
Now Dongdu is in my

194
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,580
Cui's army's control.

195
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,180
We can take over the Western capital.

196
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,180
The world will be peaceful.

197
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:43,780
You were in Yingzhou.

198
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:44,980
You hoped the people

199
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:46,580
would live a good life.

200
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:48,580
That's what you want.

201
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,580
Father.

202
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,180
If you kill Li Ni at this time,

203
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:55,380
the people

204
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,780
will have no good life.

205
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,780
You didn't say that

206
00:09:59,980 --> 00:10:00,980
when you were in Yingzhou.

207
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,780
You said the royal family was in a bad mood.

208
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:06,380
The world is full of people.

209
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:10,980
Didn't you know Li Ni at that time?

210
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,980
Father, let me tell you.

211
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,780
Li Ni

212
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:16,980
is a good fighter

213
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:18,380
who can fight for the title of the Great Lan State.

214
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,780
The most difficult thing is

215
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,380
he doesn't have the power.

216
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,780
He just wants to fight for the title of the Great Lan State.

217
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,380
Then he will fight for the title of the Great Lan State.

218
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,380
He is a man who can be a great man

219
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,380
but has a heart of a man with a humble and humble heart.

220
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:31,980
Such a man

221
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,580
is the best princess after the war.

222
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,580
Otherwise,

223
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,180
no matter who is the top,

224
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,980
the world will be in chaos.

225
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,380
You are so good at acting.

226
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,580
I didn't expect that Li Ni

227
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,780
would be so good at acting.

228
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,780
I have killed him.

229
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,780
Don't mention him anymore.

230
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:55,780
I don't believe that

231
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,380
Father won't kill him.

232
00:10:58,180 --> 00:10:58,980
Why?

233
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,380
Because I know you.

234
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,980
Even if Father hates him and hates him,

235
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,780
we have to wait for the Western Wall

236
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,780
to be taken over and killed.

237
00:11:11,580 --> 00:11:12,780
As you said,

238
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:15,780
there are still some useful things

239
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,380
left for the King of Qin.

240
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:19,780
Of course.

241
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:28,980
Father.

242
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:34,580
It's bitter.

243
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,780
My daughter said

244
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,180
if you are useful,

245
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,380
you can kill her.

246
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
You are right.

247
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,780
If Father doesn't win,

248
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:41,980
he won't run away.

249
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,580
It's very comfortable to

250
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,780
lock him up in a box like this.

251
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,580
Father won't win.

252
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,580
I can't win.

253
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,180
But I can't run away.

254
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,780
I still hope

255
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,180
General Cui

256
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,380
can help me

257
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,780
to conquer the Western Wall?

258
00:12:02,380 --> 00:12:03,980
Father promised to

259
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,980
conquer the Western Wall together.

260
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,180
Thank you, Father.

261
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:09,780
Don't worry.

262
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:11,580
Father won't use his food.

263
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,980
He doesn't care about the noodles.

264
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:14,380
He won't take them.

265
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:15,380
I'll be back soon.

266
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,380
I'll make another bowl.

267
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,580
I'll make another bowl.

268
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,580
Eat slowly.

269
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,580
Eat slowly.

270
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,580
Is it good?

271
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:49,180
Yes.

272
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,580
You were so tired just now.

273
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:56,980
It's okay.

274
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,980
I'll be fine in a few days.

275
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,780
You are so silly.

276
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,180
You are a small man.

277
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,180
You are a big man.

278
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:03,780
You are so big.

279
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:05,180
You are trapped in a cage.

280
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,580
How long have you been in the box?

281
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,380
Are you afraid of getting hurt?

282
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,180
Not long.

283
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,180
Before you came in,

284
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,380
General Cui told me

285
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:18,780
that he would conquer the Western Wall together.

286
00:13:18,980 --> 00:13:19,580
That's good.

287
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,380
But he had to tie me up

288
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:22,380
and lock me in the box.

289
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,780
He wanted to see what you mean.

290
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,980
If you want to kill me,

291
00:13:26,380 --> 00:13:27,580
then you don't need to wait for the conqueror.

292
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,580
He will cut my head off immediately.

293
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
But if you want to save my life,

294
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,980
he promised to conquer the Western Wall together.

295
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:37,780
You are so sure that

296
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:39,380
I don't want to see your head.

297
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
Maybe

298
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:42,180
I deliberately tricked you into

299
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,580
coming to the camp.

300
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,980
You are so cruel.

301
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:47,980
After all, you locked me in the Taichi Palace for so long.

302
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:49,980
Are you angry?

303
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:50,980
Of course I am.

304
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:52,980
You are really smart.

305
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:54,380
Of course I am.

306
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,580
Then you let your father

307
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:00,780
kill me.

308
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,180
You don't need to be cruel.

309
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:07,580
I have a way.

310
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:08,980
What way?

311
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:09,980
Look.

312
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:12,380
Life is so long.

313
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:14,180
If you don't help me from now on,

314
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,780
you will torture me every day

315
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,980
and make me happy.

316
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,780
If you are happy or not,

317
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:19,780
you can take my sister away.

318
00:14:20,980 --> 00:14:21,780
I think

319
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,980
this is more cruel.

320
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:23,980
What do you think?

321
00:14:25,180 --> 00:14:26,380
You are so beautiful.

322
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,180
Of course I am.

323
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:40,580
What?

324
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:51,180
What should I say?

325
00:15:07,180 --> 00:15:07,780
Monkey.

326
00:15:08,780 --> 00:15:09,380
Let's eat.

327
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,180
What's wrong with you?

328
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,780
You are like a horse on a hot pot.

329
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,580
You are walking around.

330
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:20,180
Don't worry.

331
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,580
I have been there.

332
00:15:21,980 --> 00:15:23,380
Prince Qin is safe and sound.

333
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,780
Now he is with Xiao Wei.

334
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:26,180
He is using food in his camp.

335
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,580
Actually,

336
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,380
it's not because of Prince Qin.

337
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,780
Not because of Prince Qin.

338
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:34,980
What's wrong with that?

339
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,380
I...

340
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,980
I am afraid...

341
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,980
I am afraid that I will never see you again.

342
00:15:56,180 --> 00:15:57,780
You want to see me every day?

343
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,180
But

344
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:05,180
we are going to be separated soon.

345
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,380
We still have a fight.

346
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,380
If I get hurt,

347
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:10,180
or...

348
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,980
No one will tell you anyway.

349
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:16,980
Maybe,

350
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,980
I will never see you again.

351
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:21,780
What are you talking about?

352
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:23,780
You won't get hurt.

353
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,780
Don't talk nonsense.

354
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:27,380
That's right.

355
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:29,980
I don't care if you give me the medicine.

356
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:32,780
You are blind.

357
00:16:33,780 --> 00:16:35,180
Eat. It's cold.

358
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:36,580
You are so weak.

359
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,780
You should be careful when fighting.

360
00:16:40,180 --> 00:16:41,580
Don't think about getting hurt.

361
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:46,980
It's so delicious.

362
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,780
Eat.

363
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,780
The doctor is so strict.

364
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,180
He won't let you suffer.

365
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,380
I don't know if Ying is safe.

366
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:02,380
How can I wait for him?

367
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,580
But your wound is still un-treated.

368
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:05,780
You are so stubborn.

369
00:17:06,180 --> 00:17:07,380
Why are you so cruel?

370
00:17:08,180 --> 00:17:09,780
Look at the mark left on the road.

371
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,780
The Cui family is nearby.

372
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:13,980
I must come back today.

373
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:16,180
I can rest in peace when I see Ying.

374
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:19,180
Sir.

375
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:20,980
The next person to save the world,

376
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:22,380
he will be fine.

377
00:17:26,580 --> 00:17:27,180
Sir.

378
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:29,180
Zhou.

379
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,180
Hurry.

380
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:35,380
Sir.

381
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,380
Sir.

382
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:37,580
Sir.

383
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:38,380
Sir.

384
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,180
Sir.

385
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:39,780
Sir.

386
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:40,780
Sir.

387
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,380
Sir.

388
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:41,980
Sir.

389
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:42,380
Sir.

390
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:42,780
Sir.

391
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,380
Sir.

392
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:43,980
Sir.

393
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,580
Sir.

394
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:44,980
Sir.

395
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,580
Sir.

396
00:17:45,580 --> 00:17:45,980
Sir.

397
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:46,580
Sir.

398
00:17:46,580 --> 00:17:47,180
Sir.

399
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:47,580
Sir.

400
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:47,980
Sir.

401
00:17:47,980 --> 00:17:48,380
Sir.

402
00:17:48,380 --> 00:17:48,980
Sir.

403
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:49,180
Sir.

404
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:49,980
Sir.

405
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,580
Ying.

406
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,180
I really can't bear to leave.

407
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,780
Do you want to stay?

408
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,580
I just want to

409
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:03,580
take you away with me.

410
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,780
I'm afraid your father will not agree to

411
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:06,980
your request.

412
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,180
You are so beautiful.

413
00:18:12,580 --> 00:18:13,380
I'll give you a gift.

414
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:33,180
Sir.

415
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:34,980
Ying is here.

416
00:18:43,380 --> 00:18:43,780
Then...

417
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:45,980
Isn't that the taste of the kueh?

418
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:50,780
If I'm not with you,

419
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,180
I'll let him be with you.

420
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:53,780
If you're not happy,

421
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:56,380
you can beat him and throw him away.

422
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:01,380
This little girl

423
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,380
does look like you.

424
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:04,940
Does she look like you?

425
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,940
If you like me,

426
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,780
I'll give you a little no next time.

427
00:19:14,780 --> 00:19:15,580
Well, you can

428
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:16,980
become one more girl.

429
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,340
Or she is the only person

430
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,140
that you shouldn't be with.

431
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,200
I won't fulfil my old responsibility.

432
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:42,920
Childe.

433
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,580
It's late.

434
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,180
Let's go.

435
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
Ying!

436
00:21:37,580 --> 00:21:38,580
Ying!

437
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,580
Wait till the world is peaceful.

438
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,580
I'll marry you as my wife.

439
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:48,580
Wait for me to come up.

440
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,580
I'll definitely come up.

441
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:00,580
I want to marry you.

442
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:02,580
I want to marry you.

443
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:04,580
I want to marry you.

444
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,580
Ying!

445
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:12,580
I want to marry you!

446
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:35,580
I want to marry you.

447
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
I want to marry you.

448
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,580
Let's go.

449
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:44,580
Let's go.

450
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:04,580
Your Majesty.

451
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,580
You should leave.

452
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:11,580
Ying.

453
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,580
Take care.

454
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,580
Wait for me.

455
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,580
Your Majesty.

456
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:22,580
Ying.

457
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:27,580
Ying.

458
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,580
Wait till the world is peaceful.

459
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:31,580
I'll marry you as my wife.

460
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,580
I want to marry you.

461
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,580
I want to marry you.

462
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:51,580
Your Highness.

463
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,580
How can I go back?

464
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:57,580
Where?

465
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,580
I'm not married.

466
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,580
But...

467
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,580
But if I don't go back to the Cui family,

468
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,580
how can I go with the Wuchu family?

469
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:14,580
Wuchu family.

470
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,580
No matter where I go,

471
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
I can go with them.

472
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,580
Who am I?

473
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
I'm not Cui Ling.

474
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:28,580
I'm not Cui Ling.

475
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,580
In this world,

476
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,580
I've always been so ungrateful.

477
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,580
I've been living

478
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,580
the Cui Ling's name for so many years.

479
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
I've forgotten who I am.

480
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,580
For her.

481
00:25:51,580 --> 00:25:52,580
For Ying.

482
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,580
For Ying.

483
00:25:56,580 --> 00:25:58,580
But she doesn't want me now.

484
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:02,580
I've already made her life.

485
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,580
But she doesn't need me now.

486
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,580
I don't know

487
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,580
what to do.

488
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:12,580
I'll live on.

489
00:26:13,580 --> 00:26:14,580
Hu Zi.

490
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:23,580
I'm not Cui Ling.

491
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,580
Uncle.

492
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:32,580
I've always thought

493
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:33,580
I'm not Cui Ling.

494
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,580
She's Cui Ling.

495
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,580
Even if she's a girl,

496
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,580
she's the real Cui Ling.

497
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Father.

498
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:51,580
And Ying.

499
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:54,580
She doesn't need me now.

500
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:58,580
A shadow abandoned by the master.

501
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,580
A shadow without a shadow.

502
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,580
Ying and I

503
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,580
will never be together.

504
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
Look at me.

505
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
Look at me.

506
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
I'm not good.

507
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I can't kill you.

508
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm not good.

509
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,580
It's all my fault.

510
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,580
Uncle.

511
00:27:29,580 --> 00:27:30,580
Please.

512
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,580
Please kill me.

513
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Kill me.

514
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,580
A shadow abandoned by the master.

515
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,580
I should die.

516
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,580
I should die.

517
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,580
I know the way to live.

518
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:49,580
I heard that

519
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:50,580
if you take the medicine,

520
00:27:51,580 --> 00:27:52,580
even if you're sick,

521
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:53,580
you can't resist it.

522
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,580
Childe.

523
00:27:55,580 --> 00:27:57,580
I'll go get the medicine.

524
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,580
No.

525
00:28:04,580 --> 00:28:06,580
I can't go.

526
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:10,580
Cui and Uncle

527
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,580
have a deep grudge.

528
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,580
Ying's mother

529
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,580
died in the hands of the接er.

530
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,580
I won't go to her.

531
00:28:27,580 --> 00:28:28,580
Childe.

532
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,580
Only I can go to see Xiao Wei.

533
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:34,580
Only I can wait for Xiao Wei's return.

534
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:38,580
If there's any medicine,

535
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,580
you can recover.

536
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,580
Maybe by then,

537
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:44,580
Xiao Wei will see your real face.

538
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,580
Xiao Wei will feel that

539
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:48,580
you've been sincere to her.

540
00:28:48,580 --> 00:28:50,580
She will be back to her senses.

541
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:52,580
She...

542
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:56,580
You're right.

543
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,580
I have to live.

544
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,580
I can only see A Ying.

545
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
I can only protect her.

546
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:11,580
If one day,

547
00:29:12,580 --> 00:29:14,580
I'm sick,

548
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:17,580
I can go to the real world.

549
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
She will like me too.

550
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:23,580
She won't like you anymore.

551
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:28,580
A Ying will like me.

552
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,580
A Ying will like me.

553
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,580
A Ying will like me.

554
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:36,580
A Ying.

555
00:29:36,580 --> 00:29:37,580
A Ying.

556
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:39,580
A Ying.

557
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:41,580
A Ying will like me.

558
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,580
A Ying.

559
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,580
A Ying.

560
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,580
A Ying.

561
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,580
A Ying.

562
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,580
A Ying.

563
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,580
A Ying.

564
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,580
A Ying.

565
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:53,580
A Ying.

566
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,580
A Ying.

567
00:29:54,580 --> 00:29:55,580
A Ying.

568
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:56,580
A Ying.

569
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,580
A Ying.

570
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
A Ying.

571
00:29:58,580 --> 00:29:59,580
A Ying.

572
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,580
A Ying.

573
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:01,580
A Ying.

574
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,580
It's still very cold at night.

575
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:06,580
I'd better go to rest.

576
00:30:13,580 --> 00:30:14,580
Back then,

577
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,580
I thought the world was a slave.

578
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:19,580
But now,

579
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:21,580
I have the right to accept the throne.

580
00:30:22,580 --> 00:30:24,580
Now, it seems that

581
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:26,580
I'm not good at it.

582
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:29,580
So, I'll be in the capital

583
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,580
with Li Ni.

584
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,580
If I kill the King of Liang,

585
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,580
I'll be in the capital

586
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,580
with Li Ni.

587
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,580
If they treat me with their hands,

588
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,580
we'll fight each other to death.

589
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,580
We'll kill each other.

590
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,580
I'm telling you.

591
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:56,580
The King of the Trust is in the hands of His Majesty.

592
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,580
He can't stand it.

593
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:00,580
Luckily, we're running fast.

594
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:02,580
Otherwise,

595
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:04,580
when Uncle comes to Luoyang City,

596
00:31:04,580 --> 00:31:06,580
it's hard to say.

597
00:31:06,580 --> 00:31:07,580
Uncle is dead now.

598
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:08,580
His own son.

599
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:10,580
He must be in a rage.

600
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,580
He can't take care of me for now.

601
00:31:13,580 --> 00:31:14,580
But in this way,

602
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,580
only Wu Huo

603
00:31:16,580 --> 00:31:18,580
can inherit the family's family.

604
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,580
After all, it's a good idea.

605
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,580
If General knows

606
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:25,580
that Mr. Cui's plan is...

607
00:31:25,580 --> 00:31:26,580
How is that possible?

608
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:29,580
He changed the plan.

609
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,580
Even if he finds out,

610
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:32,580
he can only find out

611
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,580
that it's Li Jun.

612
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,580
If not,

613
00:31:36,580 --> 00:31:37,580
how could he

614
00:31:37,580 --> 00:31:38,580
attack Luoyang City

615
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,580
with such anger?

616
00:31:39,580 --> 00:31:41,580
If General asks the King of the Trust,

617
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:42,580
he'll be afraid that...

618
00:31:42,580 --> 00:31:44,580
Even if he finds out,

619
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:46,580
even if he finds out Li Jun,

620
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:47,580
and the peace is out,

621
00:31:47,580 --> 00:31:49,580
it's a joke.

622
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:51,580
Think about it.

623
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:52,580
Li Jun

624
00:31:52,580 --> 00:31:53,580
is not only

625
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,580
the one who killed

626
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,580
his own son,

627
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,580
but also the one who

628
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:57,580
made us understand

629
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:58,580
Uncle's relationship.

630
00:31:58,580 --> 00:31:59,580
Can Uncle trust him?

631
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:03,580
You've been with Luoyang City for so long.

632
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,580
Can you be more mature?

633
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,580
Yes.

634
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,580
Let's find a place

635
00:32:08,580 --> 00:32:10,580
to hide and see the wind.

636
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:14,580
I can only do that.

637
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,580
San Lang,

638
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,580
come back.

639
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,580
No more.

640
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:20,580
Eat.

641
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:21,580
Eat.

642
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,580
You're annoying.

643
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,580
Xiao Wei.

644
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,580
The King of the Trust sent someone

645
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,580
to send in.

646
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,580
He made some delicious food.

647
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,580
Here you are.

648
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,580
The war is over.

649
00:32:39,580 --> 00:32:40,580
You're the one who's been

650
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:41,580
in love with this thing.

651
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:42,580
You're special to talk with your sister.

652
00:32:43,580 --> 00:32:44,580
Long-sword is like a broken dragon.

653
00:32:45,580 --> 00:32:46,580
You can't control your strength.

654
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:48,580
You're trying to suppress the enemy's power.

655
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:49,580
You can't control your strength.

656
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,580
You're trying to suppress the enemy's power.

657
00:32:50,580 --> 00:32:51,580
You can't control your strength.

658
00:32:52,580 --> 00:32:53,580
Now,

659
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:54,580
let's go to the temple

660
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,580
to gather the fruits and fruits of the country.

661
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,580
With the help of the King of the Trust,

662
00:32:58,580 --> 00:33:00,580
and the King of the Trust,

663
00:33:00,580 --> 00:33:02,580
I'll be the general of the Three Regions.

664
00:33:04,580 --> 00:33:05,580
Xiao Wei.

665
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,580
The King of the Trust

666
00:33:06,580 --> 00:33:07,580
wants to talk to you about something.

667
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,580
He wants to say that he's happy to see us.

668
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,580
He sent these

669
00:33:13,580 --> 00:33:15,580
to give us a good head of fruit.

670
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,580
Yes.

671
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:19,580
He especially asked me to take a trip.

672
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:20,580
He sent a good head of fruit

673
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:21,580
to give us a good fruit.

674
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:25,580
He sent the fruit.

675
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:27,580
What does it have to do with me?

676
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,580
He hasn't eaten a few fruits.

677
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:30,580
He's so stubborn.

678
00:33:31,580 --> 00:33:32,580
Xiao Wei.

679
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,580
Hurry and eat.

680
00:33:38,580 --> 00:33:39,580
Hurry and eat.

681
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:56,580
Brother Zhao.

682
00:33:56,580 --> 00:33:57,580
What's wrong with you?

683
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:01,580
I can't bear to live for a long time.

684
00:34:01,580 --> 00:34:02,580
We were sent to the same place by Cui's army.

685
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:04,580
We killed so many of our brothers in the Imperial Army.

686
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,540
How could we

687
00:34:05,540 --> 00:34:07,540
go to the battlefield with them?

688
00:34:07,540 --> 00:34:08,460
Exactly.

689
00:34:08,460 --> 00:34:09,980
If he turns around,

690
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:11,460
he'll be surrounded.

691
00:34:11,740 --> 00:34:12,660
I've seen Cui Yi.

692
00:34:13,180 --> 00:34:14,060
He's not like that.

693
00:34:14,500 --> 00:34:16,180
I'm not a father. I have a wife and son.

694
00:34:16,180 --> 00:34:17,140
His son is like that.

695
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,260
Why can't his father be like that?

696
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,260
If Cui Yi is like that,

697
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:22,060
he won't let me go out of Luoyang City.

698
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,340
He won't let me take my father back to Da Yikong.

699
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:27,180
Shi Qi Lang,

700
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,180
can we really trust Cui Jia Jun?

701
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,340
Zhen Xi Jun entrusted Cui Yi and Hou Yi

702
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:36,340
to us.

703
00:34:37,580 --> 00:34:39,860
Because Cui Jia Jun's military power is stronger,

704
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,780
so they entrusted Cui Yi and Hou Yi

705
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,780
to us.

706
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:46,180
Li Ni is indeed a great man.

707
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,740
He's not afraid that I'll take his back road

708
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:51,660
and kill him under the Western capital.

709
00:34:52,980 --> 00:34:54,100
Will father do that?

710
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:57,860
I believe so.

711
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,060
Then Shi Qi Lang,

712
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,260
I believe so.

713
00:35:02,540 --> 00:35:03,260
I also believe so.

714
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:05,980
I believe you, Shi Qi Lang.

715
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:08,780
Then I...

716
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,300
I also believe Shi Qi Lang.

717
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,420
Zhao Xiao Ge,

718
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,980
do you believe me?

719
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,620
Of course I believe you.

720
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:25,300
Thank you for believing me.

721
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,740
When we recover the Western capital,

722
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,180
I'll bring everyone to eat in Huangyang.

723
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:41,620
Then we'll have a drink.

724
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,700
Yes, we'll have a drink.

725
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:44,580
Come on.

726
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,540
Come on.

727
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:46,900
Come on.

728
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,340
If you didn't love him,

729
00:35:50,740 --> 00:35:52,220
you would have killed him long ago.

730
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:53,580
Father,

731
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:54,940
you won't do that.

732
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:57,900
But

733
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,260
even if we add Cui Jia Jun and Zhen Xi Jun,

734
00:36:02,140 --> 00:36:03,940
we have more soldiers than Sun Jing's soldiers.

735
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
But since ancient times,

736
00:36:07,060 --> 00:36:08,340
it's hard to be a good man.

737
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,820
Although Li Ni is a stupid,

738
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:13,100
he doesn't look like a busy man.

739
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,980
Is he still in the city?

740
00:36:18,420 --> 00:36:19,460
Is there any other arrangement?

741
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:21,260
Father, you've seen it?

742
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:22,660
Actually,

743
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,940
a few days ago,

744
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:25,220
Li Ni sent people to

745
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,140
take a walk in the city,

746
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,460
and take a walk with the people.

747
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:29,780
They went to steal food.

748
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:32,020
Now, the city is crowded.

749
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:33,100
Once the city is built,

750
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
the city will be in chaos.

751
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:37,260
And I guess

752
00:36:37,380 --> 00:36:38,780
Ba Cheng has arranged a fire

753
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:40,980
to steal food from the warehouse.

754
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,740
Once the city is in chaos,

755
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,940
the warehouse is in chaos,

756
00:36:44,180 --> 00:36:46,380
the soldiers in the city will be starving.

757
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,940
This way,

758
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,420
the city will be easy.

759
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,020
Really?

760
00:36:52,540 --> 00:36:53,140
Why?

761
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:54,620
Father thinks

762
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:56,540
this arrangement is inappropriate?

763
00:36:57,940 --> 00:36:59,740
Li Ni is still in the city

764
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,740
when she saw the old city.

765
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,500
And this arrangement must be a murder.

766
00:37:06,620 --> 00:37:08,060
It's just a burning fire,

767
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:09,860
and the city is in chaos.

768
00:37:11,420 --> 00:37:13,300
It seems that it's not a murder.

769
00:37:15,300 --> 00:37:16,460
Actually, I also guessed that

770
00:37:16,900 --> 00:37:18,340
there must be a murder.

771
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:21,580
But what is the arrangement?

772
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,580
I really can't guess it.

773
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,940
I understand a little.

774
00:37:28,140 --> 00:37:30,100
Why do you look at that guy?

775
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,540
Father,

776
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,420
have you just heard what he's going to say?

777
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:37,980
I collect ideas when he is old.

778
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,660
Although boss gave risks

779
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,920
and过ult拿了几十 claims in Yingzhou

780
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:59,340
in

781
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,500
Jiangshan the King.

782
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:03,260
Father is so praiseworthy.

783
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:04,260
I think

784
00:38:04,260 --> 00:38:06,180
he doesn't deserve my father's respect.

785
00:38:06,620 --> 00:38:09,020
Since he got my daughter's respect,

786
00:38:09,020 --> 00:38:11,220
he deserves my respect.

787
00:38:11,980 --> 00:38:12,940
Then father

788
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,460
can't be with him anymore?

789
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:16,820
I just said

790
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:18,740
it's okay to see him in the war.

791
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:20,340
He wants to marry my daughter.

792
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:22,300
Let's go.

793
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:23,500
You're so lazy.

794
00:38:32,540 --> 00:38:33,300
Your Highness,

795
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,780
it's time to attack the city.

796
00:38:35,860 --> 00:38:36,860
Didn't you say that

797
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,140
General Pingliang was in Cuiyi

798
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,340
and took the capital?

799
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,340
Yes.

800
00:38:40,340 --> 00:38:42,260
This is the past of Prince Qi.

801
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,060
He not only

802
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:45,540
gave the capital to Cuiyi

803
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,540
in a big way,

804
00:38:47,860 --> 00:38:49,060
but also convinced the Cui family

805
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:52,100
to join the attack on the Western Changjing with him.

806
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,740
Father,

807
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
do you think

808
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:57,140
the Qin army will succeed?

809
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,340
Obviously,

810
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:00,740
he wants to attack the Western Changjing with the Cui family.

811
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,700
But there must be another step

812
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:04,540
in the Western Changjing.

813
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,340
I don't know

814
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:09,740
how to respond to this step.

815
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:10,740
Your Highness.

816
00:39:12,420 --> 00:39:14,260
Something happened.

817
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:15,220
Prince Qi is attacking the city.

818
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:16,300
He went to the wrong place

819
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,500
and went to the capital.

820
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:19,660
He took the capital.

821
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:22,020
He couldn't stop the guards.

822
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:24,380
Then he was angry.

823
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:26,460
He was so angry and angry.

824
00:39:26,540 --> 00:39:28,940
I'm afraid he can't do anything now.

825
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:29,860
Okay, I know.

826
00:39:29,860 --> 00:39:30,620
You can leave.

827
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,220
Tell the guards to guard the city.

828
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:32,980
Yes.

829
00:39:35,020 --> 00:39:35,700
Mother.

830
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:37,460
Do you understand?

831
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:39,740
So it's not here.

832
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:40,940
Yes.

833
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:43,180
The news of the city's

834
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,020
mass destruction

835
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,460
caused the people to panic.

836
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,340
Then the people in the mountains

837
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,940
burned the capital.

838
00:39:48,940 --> 00:39:49,940
They robbed it.

839
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,740
It's really a mass destruction.

840
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:54,460
Even the guards in the capital

841
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,580
are starving.

842
00:39:55,900 --> 00:39:57,420
They must not be happy to be in the city.

843
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:58,260
Exactly.

844
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:01,020
Now Prince Liang has arrived in the city.

845
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:02,420
Sun Jing is coming to report.

846
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:04,060
It's so quiet in the city.

847
00:40:04,060 --> 00:40:05,380
The capital

848
00:40:05,740 --> 00:40:07,180
can't be guarded.

849
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:29,220
My Lady.

850
00:40:33,300 --> 00:40:34,580
My Lady.

851
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:37,980
My Lady.

852
00:40:40,460 --> 00:40:41,340
My Lady.

853
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,420
My Lady.

854
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,460
The people in the city are too cruel.

855
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,780
I'm afraid Li Ni will attack the city.

856
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:13,980
Jing,

857
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,180
I don't want you to go to the city again.

858
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:23,340
Let's go.

859
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,980
after we start this journey

860
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,660
Let's go a.

861
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:33,940
Now

862
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:35,220
How do you know

863
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:36,300
the emotion

864
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,260
of this

865
00:42:47,660 --> 00:42:48,900
I have been thinking

866
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:52,660
The time has passed.

867
00:42:54,980 --> 00:42:55,080
Maybe

868
00:42:55,220 --> 00:42:55,440
we two

869
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:56,380
go to the city with you.

870
00:42:58,260 --> 00:42:59,460
I'm sorry.

871
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,860
Shang Hua,

872
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:06,660
stay here.

873
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,060
When I get rid of Lin Mi,

874
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:11,860
I'll come back to drink with you.

875
00:43:12,460 --> 00:43:13,460
I'll wait for you.

876
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:19,460
Wait for me.

877
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:14,860
lt's time for you to kill.

878
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:16,660
For once.

879
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:18,660
OK, Have a rave

880
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,660
until l die behavioral every time you drink.

881
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:23,660
Then don't say this so really badly,

882
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,860
it'll affect you aimless.

883
00:44:33,860 --> 00:44:35,460
You wanna take him with you?

884
00:44:37,060 --> 00:44:38,860
Don't use your Aut���finish starter.

885
00:44:39,860 --> 00:44:41,060
Don't say such a dirty thing.

886
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:41,760
Jump.

887
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:43,500
Attack!

888
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:07,460
Here, follow me,

889
00:46:07,460 --> 00:46:08,480
and guard your guards.

890
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:10,020
Report!

891
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:10,820
Tang Dongdong.

892
00:46:10,820 --> 00:46:12,420
Zheng Xuzhun and the Back Army are too strong in history,

893
00:46:12,420 --> 00:46:13,740
their подготовist스가给囤梯

We can nematode with이라고

with Bismuth afraid of heights straight ahead.

900
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,300
So you should not retreat.

901
00:46:23,620 --> 00:46:25,540
Retreat for a moment!

902
00:46:25,540 --> 00:46:26,460
Depart!

903
00:47:10,820 --> 00:47:11,820
Go!

904
00:47:11,820 --> 00:47:12,820
Go!

905
00:47:12,820 --> 00:47:13,820
Go!

906
00:47:13,820 --> 00:47:14,820
Go!

907
00:47:14,820 --> 00:47:15,820
Go!

908
00:47:15,820 --> 00:47:16,820
Go!

909
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:17,820
Go!

910
00:47:17,820 --> 00:47:18,820
Go!

911
00:47:18,820 --> 00:47:19,820
Go!

912
00:47:19,820 --> 00:47:20,820
Go!

913
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:24,820
Dadao, those rebels are coming to the cave to attack.

914
00:47:24,820 --> 00:47:26,820
They have the fire-resistant fire.

915
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,820
Please, Dadao, try it.

916
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:34,820
There's no one in Changchong.

917
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,820
Kill them all.

918
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:37,820
Yes.

919
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:43,820
Dadao, the city is in chaos.

920
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:44,820
The situation is in danger.

921
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:45,820
Dadao, you'd better retreat.

922
00:47:45,820 --> 00:47:47,820
We'll be in the same place.

923
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:49,820
As long as we keep our guard,

924
00:47:49,820 --> 00:47:52,820
the army of Zhang Baoyu will come back.

925
00:47:52,820 --> 00:47:55,820
We'll take this situation and the Cui's army.

926
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,820
Dadao, there's a man in the mountains.

927
00:48:01,820 --> 00:48:02,820
Don't be afraid.

928
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:04,820
Kill all the soldiers.

929
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:19,820
Dadao.

930
00:48:30,820 --> 00:48:35,820
Dadao.

931
00:49:35,820 --> 00:49:37,320
Go to the temple,

932
00:49:41,320 --> 00:49:44,320
and find Him.

933
00:49:45,220 --> 00:49:50,120
Hishh.

934
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:54,500
Yubin,

935
00:49:58,240 --> 00:50:00,100
His Highness has arrived in the three Kingdoms!

936
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:01,860
His Highness is here!

937
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:05,400
Qinging,

938
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:07,380
If I already discussed with Di Ni

939
00:50:07,500 --> 00:50:09,820
on the matter of Li Ying Wei He,

940
00:50:10,380 --> 00:50:11,900
then we have to

941
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:13,460
be responsible for the murder.

942
00:50:13,580 --> 00:50:14,340
You should help me.

943
00:50:14,660 --> 00:50:15,140
I beg your pardon, Your Highness.

944
00:50:15,340 --> 00:50:16,260
You open the door.

945
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:17,780
Nobody here.

946
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,480
Where is the tunnel?

947
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:38,920
In the倍-c vài

948
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:42,700
Will you listen to me.

949
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:45,880
Do you want me to be your guide?

950
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,420
A long way to go.

951
00:50:58,340 --> 00:51:00,100
But I have to leave.

952
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,340
If you take me away,

953
00:51:03,340 --> 00:51:05,340
I will never forget you.

954
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:07,340
I will never forget you.

955
00:51:07,340 --> 00:51:09,340
I will never forget you.

956
00:51:09,340 --> 00:51:11,340
I will never forget you.

957
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:13,340
