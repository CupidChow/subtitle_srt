I have just wanted to let you pulled my tight myself

00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,060
When we meet, let's be apart

00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:49,480
When we meet, let's stay in love

10
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,420
I'd never given up

11
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,420
I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

I'm afraid I'll be able to do it.

00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:50,780
How is it, Miss Daozi?

29
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,900
I bought the right one.

30
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,780
The fake medicine that Xiao Wei asked me to give to Royal Descendant

31
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:57,460
is very complicated.

32
00:01:57,460 --> 00:01:59,180
If you can't find all the medicinal ingredients,

33
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,580
you can't find the medicine.

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,300
There are still a few medicinal ingredients left.

35
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,860
But I've already

36
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,180
searched for the medicinal ingredients in the market.

37
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,060
I really can't find the medicinal ingredients

38
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:12,540
you want.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,300
How about

40
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,540
I go to the mountain with you to pick the medicinal ingredients?

41
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:18,660
What?

42
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,940
I've prepared a poison medicine

43
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,300
for the day before yesterday.

44
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:24,140
As long as people stick to their body,

45
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,340
it will be healthy and safe.

46
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:27,580
I've already found the medicinal ingredients.

47
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,900
It's just that there's no one

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,500
to try the bitter fish for me.

49
00:02:30,740 --> 00:02:31,980
I don't know if there's any.

50
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,420
Then I'll try it.

51
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,300
It's very nutritious.

52
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:36,980
I'm not kidding.

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,860
If the medicinal ingredients I don't use

54
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,940
will last for at least three days and three nights.

55
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,820
It's okay, Miss Taozi.

56
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:43,620
I trust you.

57
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:45,020
Okay.

58
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:46,180
That's it.

59
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:48,020
Since you've tried the medicinal ingredients for me,

60
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,180
I'll make sure

61
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,460
to prepare the medicinal ingredients for you as soon as possible.

62
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:51,540
Okay.

63
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:57,660
I know you love sweet food.

64
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,340
Here.

65
00:02:58,580 --> 00:02:59,780
Try the sweet and sour vegetable soup.

66
00:03:01,460 --> 00:03:02,860
Which shop did you buy this from?

67
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,100
I didn't buy it.

68
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:05,260
Miss Gu just sent it to me.

69
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:09,380
Is it made by her?

70
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,900
Of course not.

71
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,620
They all have A Yuan's wife.

72
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:14,100
I remember that you love it

73
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,340
so I brought it to you.

74
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,180
Have a try.

75
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:17,900
Put it here.

76
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:18,820
I'll eat it later.

77
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:19,740
Okay.

78
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,180
By the way,

79
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,220
the people in the capital are in contact with you.

80
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,420
Now everything is in order.

81
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:26,380
It's just the east wind.

82
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,860
The medicinal ingredients are not ready yet.

83
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:30,540
I know.

84
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:32,420
I'll ask Chang'er to follow her every day.

85
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:33,580
What can I do for her?

86
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,660
You should ask Xie Chang'er to help Taozi.

87
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,380
I don't want to be in a mess.

88
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,660
It's okay to be in a mess.

89
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:40,380
I'm afraid that she'll be by your side.

90
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,380
I'm afraid that she'll give me the poisonous needle.

91
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:45,100
Why does she give you the poisonous needle?

92
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:47,700
No.

93
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:50,580
Because...

94
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,820
No matter what,

95
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,620
Jinshus��ار cordial in here is very unusual.

96
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:04,800
Even if someday you fight outside today,

97
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,060
you must move out.

98
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:09,380
Yes.

99
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,180
I suddenly remembered.

100
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,180
Our young master likes this dessert.

101
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:22,180
I'll give it to him now.

102
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:25,180
I specially brought you this dessert. How can you give it to someone else?

103
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,180
That's not for you.

104
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:30,180
You brought it for me.

105
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:52,500
Brother Xu

106
00:04:52,500 --> 00:05:06,940
effective

107
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,940
Cui Yi's son, Cui Lin,

108
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:10,940
saw his past actions

109
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:13,940
until he became a very mature person.

110
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:16,940
If I were in the battle,

111
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:18,940
I would definitely attack Luo Yang first.

112
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:20,940
Then I would save Ying Zhou.

113
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:23,940
But Luo Yang has been in the city for a long time.

114
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,940
Fu Yuan'er only needs to be in the hands of the enemy.

115
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,940
The Xi army and the Cui army are ten times more important.

116
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,940
They can't break through the city in a short time.

117
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,940
And Fu Yuan'er is a battlefield commander.

118
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,940
How could he be in the hands of two children?

119
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:41,940
I'm the one who made the mistake of using my self-defense skills.

120
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,940
This time, Luo Yang's master

121
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,940
gave me a lesson.

122
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,940
The enemy is just an external force.

123
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:55,940
The real one can break through the city.

124
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,940
It's a internal force.

125
00:05:57,940 --> 00:06:01,940
The Xi Chang's army seems to be weak.

126
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:03,940
I'm afraid they will attack.

127
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,940
I'll go to the capital to investigate the various families.

128
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:11,940
I'll guard the Qi and Ni army and secretly collude.

129
00:06:11,940 --> 00:06:14,940
The one who colludes secretly

130
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,940
is the one who is in the family.

131
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:21,940
Shi Qi Lang, Cui's army has been captured.

132
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:23,940
What?

133
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,940
Captured?

134
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,940
Yes.

135
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:27,940
Xiao Wei,

136
00:06:27,940 --> 00:06:29,940
the city is almost closed.

137
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:30,940
I'll go to the river to walk.

138
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,940
I'll go with you.

139
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:32,940
No need.

140
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:33,940
You go first.

141
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:34,940
Okay.

142
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:37,940
The things inside are faster.

143
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:38,940
Yes.

144
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,940
Why didn't you say anything?

145
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,940
You suddenly want to take a picture of the city.

146
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,940
You're so stupid.

147
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:51,940
You're so stupid.

148
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,940
You're so stupid.

149
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,940
You're so stupid.

150
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,940
You suddenly want to take a picture of the city.

151
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:00,940
How do we urge the army to act?

152
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,940
And report to the Royal Descendant?

153
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:06,940
No.

154
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:08,940
I just walk in a hurry.

155
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,940
I can't give you a ride.

156
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,940
I remember that you went back to Ying Zhou.

157
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:17,940
From here, you can go to the mountains and mountains.

158
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,940
I wonder when you can meet me.

159
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:25,940
I promise you.

160
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,940
Before I go back to Ying Zhou,

161
00:07:34,940 --> 00:07:36,940
I'll come to you.

162
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:39,940
You said it.

163
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,940
How did you get this?

164
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:51,940
There are many wolves in the old house.

165
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,940
Every time we meet wolves,

166
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,940
we'll pick up a stone to fight.

167
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:56,940
It's been a long time.

168
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,940
Everyone learned this skill.

169
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,940
Every time we think about it,

170
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:03,940
we'll change to the river bank next to the old house.

171
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,940
The first piece of lamb that wins

172
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:06,940
will be returned.

173
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,940
It sounds interesting.

174
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:11,940
Do you want to try it?

175
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:23,940
Not far.

176
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,940
I'll teach you.

177
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:27,940
I'll teach you.

178
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Take it.

179
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:52,940
It's done.

180
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,940
It's done.

181
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,940
It's like this.

182
00:09:21,940 --> 00:09:22,940
It's a dragon.

183
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,940
Shi Qi Lang.

184
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,940
Cui Li came to see me.

185
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,940
Cui Li?

186
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,940
He's a great scholar.

187
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:54,940
He's a small person.

188
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:56,940
He's not good at everything.

189
00:09:58,940 --> 00:09:59,940
What?

190
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:00,940
What's wrong with him?

191
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:02,940
He wants to join us

192
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,940
to kill Cui Li.

193
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:06,940
General Pei,

194
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:07,940
I'm interested in

195
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:09,940
joining you with the Zhengxi Army

196
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:10,940
to kill Cui Li.

197
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Aren't you afraid

198
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:15,940
I'll tie you up

199
00:10:15,940 --> 00:10:16,940
and send you to Mr. Cui?

200
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:18,940
I'm not sure.

201
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:19,940
In front of Mr. Cui Li?

202
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,940
I'm just trying to make a point.

203
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,940
In the case of killing Cui Li,

204
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,940
you and I

205
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,940
are in the same boat.

206
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,940
From Wanzhou to Luoyang,

207
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:36,940
I should have

208
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,940
put you in trouble.

209
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,940
If we didn't have him,

210
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:41,940
would you have the provisions?

211
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:42,940
You'd have been taken away

212
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,940
by Cheng Chi.

213
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:45,940
General Pei,

214
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,940
didn't you think

215
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,940
you'd be able to kill

216
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,940
the new general?

217
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:53,940
I can guarantee you that

218
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,940
after Cui Li is dead,

219
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,940
I'll be the one to take care of Cui's army.

220
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,940
By then,

221
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,940
I'll lead the royal family

222
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:02,940
to fight with the Zhengxi Army.

223
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:07,940
After the trial,

224
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:09,940
Luoyang will be the one to take care of it.

225
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:11,940
What do you say?

226
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,940
Zhang Kou will be Luoyang.

227
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,940
Why are you so small?

228
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,940
General Pei,

229
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,940
after Luoyang is dead,

230
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,940
the Zhengxi Army

231
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,940
can be the one to take care of it.

232
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:24,940
It's a basic Western capital.

233
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:25,940
In fact,

234
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,940
you can kill the traitor Sun Jing.

235
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:30,940
The whole world is like a royal grandson.

236
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,940
Naturally, you can take care of it.

237
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:34,940
By then,

238
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,940
will you be in the capital again?

239
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:39,940
Really?

240
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:42,940
If that's the case,

241
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,940
then I'll make a decision.

242
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:46,940
I'm bold.

243
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:49,940
I also want to ask General for a favor.

244
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,940
What favor?

245
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:54,940
Please forgive me.

246
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:55,940
I'll take care of it.

247
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:56,940
After the trial,

248
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,940
Luoyang will be the one to take care of it.

249
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,940
What do you say?

250
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:03,940
General Pei,

251
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,940
what's the meaning of this?

252
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:07,940
Cui,

253
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,940
if you want to kill Cui Li

254
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,940
by the royal grandson,

255
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:13,940
then you can kill Cui Li.

256
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:15,940
You didn't do anything.

257
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,940
You just want to do the surgery.

258
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,940
I'm afraid it's not appropriate.

259
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:21,940
No.

260
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,940
Yes.

261
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,940
General, you're right.

262
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:25,940
How about this?

263
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,940
I'll go and give Cui Li's men

264
00:12:28,940 --> 00:12:29,940
to the royal grandson

265
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:30,940
after the trial.

266
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:31,940
He'll be happy.

267
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,940
What do you say?

268
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:34,940
Let's talk about it later.

269
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,940
This little man

270
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:41,940
must tell Cui Li

271
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:42,940
to let him go.

272
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:43,940
Shi Qi Lang.

273
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:44,940
I know what you're talking about.

274
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:48,940
But I still want to be honest

275
00:12:49,940 --> 00:12:50,940
and be sure of it with him.

276
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:52,940
I don't want to see him

277
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:54,940
being killed by the little man.

278
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,940
Miss Tao.

279
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:07,940
Miss Tao.

280
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:08,940
This is Shi Qi Lang.

281
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:09,940
He Xiao Wei.

282
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,940
And this.

283
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:15,940
This is for you.

284
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,940
What's this?

285
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,940
It's a pig ear.

286
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,940
I bought a few of them

287
00:13:21,940 --> 00:13:22,940
before I came here.

288
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:25,940
I don't want it.

289
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,940
But didn't you say

290
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,940
you liked it last time?

291
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,940
I don't want it now.

292
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:36,940
Excuse me.

293
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,940
What's wrong?

294
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,940
I went to the city with Xiao Wei these days.

295
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,940
Do you feel uncomfortable?

296
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:47,940
No.

297
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:48,940
I'm fine with the medicine you gave me.

298
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,940
I'll just take it for two days.

299
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:57,940
Here you are.

300
00:13:58,940 --> 00:13:59,940
Three times a day.

301
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:01,940
This medicine is for you.

302
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,940
Thank you, Miss Tao Zi.

303
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,940
Here.

304
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,940
What's this?

305
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,940
It's a pig ear.

306
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,940
I suddenly want to eat it.

307
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:19,940
Here you are.

308
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,940
Miss Tao Zi is so weird.

309
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:33,940
Xiao Wei.

310
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:36,940
Your Highness, the letter from Royal Descendant.

311
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:37,940
Why are you so happy?

312
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,940
No.

313
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:41,940
Why would I be happy?

314
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,940
Is it because of the ear?

315
00:14:46,940 --> 00:14:47,940
What ear?

316
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,940
Isn't it a pig ear?

317
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,940
Xiao Wei.

318
00:14:51,940 --> 00:14:52,940
Xu Xiao Wei.

319
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,940
Xu Xiao Wei.

320
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,940
I won't give you any more.

321
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:56,940
Ying.

322
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,940
There's a traitor in the Wen De Cui's army.

323
00:14:58,940 --> 00:15:00,940
He's trying to kill you.

324
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,940
He's trying to kill you.

325
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,940
You should pay more attention to him.

326
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:05,940
And take care of yourself.

327
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:07,940
From now on,

328
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,940
I'll keep protecting you.

329
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,940
I'll keep the army safe.

330
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:13,940
I'll keep the good work safe.

331
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:14,940
Yes.

332
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
I'll do everything I can.

333
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:18,940
Ying.

334
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:20,940
Why do you suddenly remember to add my guard?

335
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:21,940
Sir.

336
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:22,940
The letter from Royal Descendant.

337
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:24,940
You're not good at hunting.

338
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,940
I'll take the army.

339
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,940
You're a good friend.

340
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,940
Ying, don't worry about me.

341
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:31,940
You've worked hard.

342
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:33,940
You've been thinking too much.

343
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:35,940
You should take good care of yourself.

344
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,940
It's my duty to take care of you.

345
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:42,940
Tao Zi.

346
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,940
Give me this letter to Xie Chang Er.

347
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,940
What's wrong?

348
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,940
You've been always joking.

349
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,940
I won't give you a letter.

350
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,940
You don't want to give me a letter?

351
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:56,940
Or you don't want to see Xie Chang Er?

352
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:58,940
I...

353
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,940
If you're a candidate,

354
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,940
I'll give you a letter.

355
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,940
Tell them to give me a letter.

356
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,940
I'll let the old man come.

357
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,940
So that we won't be happy.

358
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,940
Look at you.

359
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,940
They're all good friends.

360
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,940
They're all the same.

361
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:15,940
I'll do it.

362
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:16,940
Go back early.

363
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:18,940
Don't bully Er Luo.

364
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Who bullied her?

365
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,940
You're so stubborn.

366
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

367
00:16:34,940 --> 00:16:36,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

368
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

369
00:16:38,940 --> 00:16:40,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

370
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

371
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

372
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:46,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

373
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:48,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

374
00:16:48,940 --> 00:16:50,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

375
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

376
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

377
00:16:54,940 --> 00:16:56,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

378
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

379
00:16:58,940 --> 00:17:00,940
I'll go back to my hometown.

380
00:17:00,940 --> 00:17:03,940
Royal Descendant, are you asleep?

381
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:07,940
I'm afraid I'll fall asleep at night if I don't come here.

382
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:09,940
The land is full of trees.

383
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,940
Where can the 17th Lord be free?

384
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:16,940
It's because the wind and the dust are good at this moment.

385
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,940
You're asleep?

386
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,940
I'm asleep.

387
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:39,940
Why did you remind me?

388
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:42,940
So you're not good to our young master?

389
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
Because I reminded you.

390
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,940
I'm not good at it.

391
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:50,940
I'm not good at it.

392
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:52,940
I'm not good at it.

393
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,940
I'm not good at it.

394
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,940
I'm not good at it.

395
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:58,940
I'm not good at it.

396
00:17:58,940 --> 00:18:00,940
Because I reminded you.

397
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,940
You're going back to your hometown.

398
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:08,940
If I'm not good at it,

399
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,940
you won't meet me.

400
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,940
Then I'll let you meet me.

401
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
I'm going back to Yingzhou.

402
00:18:31,940 --> 00:18:32,940
I promised you

403
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:35,940
to say goodbye to you.

404
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,940
I'm sorry.

405
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:16,940
It's raining.

406
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:18,940
I'll take you to a place.

407
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,940
I didn't expect that

408
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
the Royal Descendant

409
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,940
would prepare such a house.

410
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:35,940
It's a big deal.

411
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,940
It's raining.

412
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
How about we go to the Tangji?

413
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,940
The Royal Descendant is in the Tangji.

414
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,940
I didn't see him.

415
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,940
What a coincidence.

416
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
The girl from the Tangji is here.

417
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,940
What a coincidence.

418
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,940
I've seen her in the Tangji.

419
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,940
The fragrance of the fragrance is strong.

420
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,940
It's not a foul smell.

421
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,940
Is this bamboo leaf tea?

422
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:28,940
Yes.

423
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:31,940
People often use bamboo leaf as a tea.

424
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,940
The Royal Descendant's identity is so precious.

425
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,940
He's so weak in life.

426
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
Life is a life.

427
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:41,940
What's his identity?

428
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,940
It's not worth mentioning.

429
00:20:43,940 --> 00:20:45,940
How about kneeling as a emperor?

430
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,940
It's not a dinner.

431
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:47,940
It's a tea.

432
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,940
I think it's more convenient

433
00:20:49,940 --> 00:20:51,940
to be a sweet-talker here.

434
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:52,940
It's not convenient.

435
00:20:52,940 --> 00:20:54,940
Have you ever thought about it?

436
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:56,940
If the emperor is a dancing god,

437
00:20:56,940 --> 00:20:59,940
the Royal Descendant's house is in the wrong place.

438
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:02,940
Even the tea is a dead end.

439
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,940
Why is it so convenient?

440
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,940
I don't know if there's a dinner here.

441
00:21:16,940 --> 00:21:18,940
We can fill our stomachs with sweet-talking.

442
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,940
It's all prepared.

443
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,940
This is good.

444
00:21:27,940 --> 00:21:28,940
No.

445
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,940
This is not good.

446
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:33,940
I'm not good at cooking.

447
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,940
If you don't mind,

448
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:36,940
I'll show you two dishes.

449
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,940
The Royal Descendant's wife cooks for me.

450
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:39,940
I'm not good at cooking.

451
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,940
But

452
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,940
I don't think I can do anything.

453
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
I should be the one who lives.

454
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:48,940
Okay.

455
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,940
That's settled.

456
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:52,940
Let me see.

457
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,940
I didn't expect the Royal Descendant

458
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,940
to prepare such a good dish.

459
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
I'm afraid you won't know.

460
00:22:06,940 --> 00:22:07,940
Guo,

461
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,940
you really don't know how to cook.

462
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,940
What's this?

463
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:13,940
We cook in the old house.

464
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,940
We wash, hunt, cook.

465
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:16,940
It's all our own cooking.

466
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:18,940
Did you bring a wet cloth

467
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,940
when you were in the old house?

468
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,940
If I bring a wet cloth,

469
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,940
what's the difference

470
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,940
between living in the capital and the royal house?

471
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,940
As the Royal Descendant,

472
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,940
I don't like the life of the royal family.

473
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:32,940
It's interesting.

474
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,940
I was born in the second month of the second month.

475
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:42,940
Since I was a child,

476
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,940
my father and I don't like it.

477
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,940
Such a royal family

478
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
doesn't matter.

479
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,240
Well.

480
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:59,340
Look.

481
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:08,940
Lower the light of the fan.

482
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:13,940
So let go of the heat.

483
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:14,940
The burned.

484
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,940
I can cook the best.

485
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:16,940
Sure.

486
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:21,820
It's a common thing.

487
00:23:22,420 --> 00:23:24,300
If you push it in slowly,

488
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:25,780
it will be pulled out.

489
00:23:25,780 --> 00:23:27,540
If you push it in slowly, it will be pulled out.

490
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:28,140
And...

491
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:28,820
Let me try.

492
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,260
The fire is very strong.

493
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,620
Don't be ridiculous.

494
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,060
It's not good to cook like this.

495
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,220
Don't worry.

496
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:36,060
Bye.

497
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,460
Bye.

498
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:52,340
It's Don!

499
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,140
Where's the hot water?

500
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,700
It's on the beginning.

501
00:23:54,980 --> 00:23:55,020
It is.

502
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,940
Here comes rice!

503
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:19,060
You are my childhood friend.

504
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,380
ThatTE

505
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:24,660
realize

506
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:25,780
another thing

507
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:29,140
around and forget everything.

508
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,140
Shi Qilao,

509
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,140
you really did

510
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:31,740
what were想

511
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:32,740
to kill

512
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,300
that mountain of cool food.

513
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,900
Here,

514
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:39,940
this dish!

515
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:45,260
What do you think?

516
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:46,580
It's delicious.

517
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:48,660
Then eat more.

518
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,420
Aren't you afraid that I'll poison you?

519
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:57,820
Of course.

520
00:24:58,700 --> 00:24:59,620
So just now,

521
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,060
when I was burning the fire,

522
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:02,940
I put a poison in it.

523
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:06,020
Sun,

524
00:25:06,900 --> 00:25:08,300
you've already been poisoned.

525
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,060
It's delicious.

526
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,460
I'll hold hands with this plant.

527
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,460
I'll give you more when we take this.

528
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:47,000
So nice, right?

529
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,320
Be careful.

530
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:02,440
Cover my face.

531
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,540
You all must not go against that belay!

532
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:10,520
Have the body has no resource to fight.

533
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:12,820
Trust me.

534
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,080
I can fight as well as you.

535
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,120
Have you ever thought why did she

536
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:15,720
Father!

537
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,680
You, the fox spirit,

538
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,920
have a great life and a great life.

539
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:23,320
If you hurt my brother, you'll be killed.

540
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,680
I'll kill you,

541
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,840
you, the fox spirit,

542
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:27,200
and my brother.

543
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:27,800
Let go of me.

544
00:26:28,760 --> 00:26:29,800
I'll kill you.

545
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:30,840
Let go of me.

546
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:31,640
Let go of me.

547
00:26:31,640 --> 00:26:32,320
Father.

548
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,120
I'll kill you all.

549
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:36,520
The big rabbit is here.

550
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:38,800
Let go of me.

551
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:45,680
Father.

552
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:56,120
Guards.

553
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,120
Lady Wei is ill.

554
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,360
You can't go down.

555
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,560
Hurry up and go to the doctor.

556
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:01,400
Yes.

557
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,240
Big rabbit.

558
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:03,720
Let go of me.

559
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:04,480
Big rabbit.

560
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,080
Big rabbit.

561
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:06,920
I'm going to leave.

562
00:27:07,280 --> 00:27:08,280
Big rabbit.

563
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,440
Ruo Kun.

564
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:12,960
Are you hurt?

565
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,840
I'm hurt.

566
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,520
I'm hurt.

567
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:24,240
I'm not hurt.

568
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,120
I knew it would be today.

569
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:30,600
How could I be hurt?

570
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,800
I've been thinking these days.

571
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:41,920
If I had taken you away,

572
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,440
what would it be?

573
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:46,640
I knew it would be today.

574
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:51,720
In the past,

575
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,240
I got to a physical position outside the city.

576
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,040
I waited for you a whole day.

577
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,080
Until the sunset,

578
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,480
I can see you.

579
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:07,280
I knew you wouldn't ever come again.

580
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:12,920
Although I was Transied

581
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,920
But as long as you're willing to take me away,

582
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:18,920
I can go far away from you.

583
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,920
I'm willing to keep my heart.

584
00:28:20,920 --> 00:28:23,920
Even if I'm a common couple,

585
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:26,920
I can still be a couple.

586
00:28:34,920 --> 00:28:36,920
I've let you down.

587
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:37,920
No.

588
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:41,920
I know that you're still a high-class mother.

589
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:44,920
You're a lowly and righteous mother.

590
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:47,920
If you really take me away,

591
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:51,920
that's the crime of being a total scum.

592
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:54,920
I'm deeply guilty now.

593
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:59,920
But as long as I think of the days I'm with you,

594
00:28:59,920 --> 00:29:01,920
even if I'm secretly coming,

595
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,920
as long as I can be with you,

596
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:06,920
whether you scold me or abandon me,

597
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:09,920
I'm so happy.

598
00:29:11,920 --> 00:29:14,920
I'm so happy.

599
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,920
General Han.

600
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,320
We're in the West

601
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,920
and the city is far, far away.

602
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,920
There must be thousands of miles.

603
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,920
It's a long and fast journey.

604
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:55,920
We must go through it.

605
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:00,920
Mother, what I'm saying is

606
00:30:00,920 --> 00:30:04,920
that Aze is a good-looking and good-looking man.

607
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,920
But General Han is a good-looking man.

608
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:09,920
He's not the eldest son of the Crown Prince.

609
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,920
But now,

610
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,920
I'm like a mouse every day.

611
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:17,920
I'm so happy.

612
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:28,920
I'm telling you the story of General Han.

613
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:31,920
I'm telling you the story of the King of Yue.

614
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,920
You're in danger now.

615
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,920
You're in the manor.

616
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:38,920
You can take over He Shan in the future.

617
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,920
You said that General Zheng Xijun was a good-looking man.

618
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:43,920
I was the eldest brother of the Crown Prince.

619
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,920
General Zheng Xijun has been killing the King of Wangzhou

620
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,920
since he was old.

621
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,920
General Zheng Xijun is quite good-looking.

622
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:53,920
I really want to fight him

623
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,920
and kill him with my face.

624
00:30:57,920 --> 00:31:01,920
The Crown Prince is really a good-looking man.

625
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,920
But General Zheng Xijun is a man of the Crown Prince.

626
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:09,920
The Crown Prince and I are not close.

627
00:31:09,920 --> 00:31:11,920
His Highness is now a noble man.

628
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:13,920
Even if he's a blood-sucking relative,

629
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,920
he can't trust me easily.

630
00:31:16,920 --> 00:31:18,920
For example, the King of Liang

631
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:21,920
is still a son of the Crown Prince in the Western City.

632
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,920
I'm afraid that Li Ning has some concerns.

633
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,920
She's thinking too much.

634
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,920
General Han,

635
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:31,920
when can we return to the Western City?

636
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:34,920
I'm sure that's him.

637
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:38,920
I'll definitely escort His Highness back to the Western City

638
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:42,920
and wait for him to come back.

639
00:31:45,920 --> 00:31:47,920
Since Sun Jing was born,

640
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,920
after I left Pingliang,

641
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,920
I've never had a afternoon like this.

642
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,920
I can be so satisfied.

643
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:57,920
Can you tell me

644
00:31:57,920 --> 00:32:00,920
what you think of the fairy in the fog?

645
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:04,920
I've been dreaming of returning to the Old Lan Temple

646
00:32:04,920 --> 00:32:06,920
a few days ago.

647
00:32:06,920 --> 00:32:09,920
I hit a very flying yellow rock.

648
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,920
I was just thinking about it.

649
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:13,920
I was just thinking about it.

650
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,920
I'm curious.

651
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,920
Is the Old Lan Temple really that good?

652
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,920
It's worth your consideration.

653
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,920
There's no way to go without a plan.

654
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:30,920
It's not fast enough.

655
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:34,920
I'll ask you to go to the Old Lan Temple with me.

656
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,920
Are you willing to?

657
00:32:42,920 --> 00:32:45,920
You clearly know that this is a dream.

658
00:32:46,920 --> 00:32:48,920
It's a tree-dried jade.

659
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,920
It's a wind-dried jade.

660
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,920
Shi Qilong,

661
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,920
you're also now

662
00:32:56,920 --> 00:32:58,920
able to leave everything

663
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:02,920
and go back to the old days?

664
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:25,920
Is there a good rain that's stuck between us?

665
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,920
After the rain stopped,

666
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,920
you covered up the whole school again.

667
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,920
Let's talk about something else.

668
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,920
Okay.

669
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,920
Then...

670
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:41,920
let's talk about you.

671
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,920
When you were little,

672
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,920
were you particularly naughty?

673
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,920
Not naughty, but a bit naughty.

674
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,920
My father hit my head and I didn't know how much it was.

675
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,920
It seems that Prince Liang is very hard-working.

676
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,920
But the smile is very good.

677
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
I'm not afraid of being beaten up.

678
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:03,920
I'm afraid of being missed.

679
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:07,920
My mother gave birth to me as a boy.

680
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,920
In the whole royal family,

681
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,920
only Consort Dong took care of me.

682
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:14,920
My father didn't like me.

683
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,920
My two brothers

684
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:18,920
all have the heart of their father.

685
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,920
They always make me feel proud.

686
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,920
After a long time,

687
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,920
my father hated me more.

688
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,920
Now we're sisters.

689
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:28,920
I really can't believe

690
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,920
you're still so angry.

691
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
My two brothers

692
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
were all born by Consort Dong.

693
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,920
My mother is the maid by Consort Dong's side.

694
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,920
I heard that she was not ugly before.

695
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:44,920
Fortunately, Consort Dong took care of my mother very well.

696
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,920
After my mother passed away,

697
00:34:47,920 --> 00:34:49,920
Consort Dong took care of me.

698
00:34:49,920 --> 00:34:54,920
I also don't want to be a brother to Consort Dong.

699
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,920
You're a kind person.

700
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,920
You're very kind to others.

701
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,920
You're very considerate.

702
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,920
Haolan,

703
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,920
Consort Dong is not lonely.

704
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,920
I've been living in the capital

705
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:19,920
without any worries at home.

706
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:22,920
I'd rather stay by your side.

707
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,920
So I decided to go to the Wolf King.

708
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:28,920
The day I left,

709
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,920
my father and brother-in-law were very happy.

710
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:36,920
Only my mother left me alone.

711
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:38,920
Where's my mother?

712
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,920
She's in the palace.

713
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,920
She's the eldest.

714
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,920
I left the palace

715
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,920
and sent her back to the Wolf King's Mansion.

716
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:48,920
I wanted to hear it.

717
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,920
I also had a good time.

718
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,920
But I was in a hurry.

719
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:56,920
I don't know if she's in a good condition.

720
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,920
There's no one who's weird.

721
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,920
I'm not sure.

722
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:11,920
There's no one who's weird.

723
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,920
I won't feel lonely.

724
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,920
My mother has passed away for a long time.

725
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,920
I've almost forgotten her.

726
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,920
But every time I think of her,

727
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:29,920
she's always with me.

728
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:33,920
I won't feel lonely either.

729
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,920
What kind of person are you?

730
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:38,920
I can't think of anything.

731
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,920
I guess you're a person who's small and strong.

732
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,920
You're a man who's greedy.

733
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,920
I was raised by boys when I was a kid.

734
00:36:50,920 --> 00:36:52,920
I've studied and practiced dance.

735
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,920
I've never seen any other boys.

736
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,920
I'd better learn

737
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,920
what boys learn.

738
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,920
You're the one who forced me.

739
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:08,920
I'm my own wish.

740
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm a girl.

741
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,920
I'm like a man.

742
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:17,920
I should have a better future.

743
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,920
Good!

744
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:36,920
Good!

745
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:37,920
Good!

746
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:38,920
Good!

747
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:40,920
It's all the three of you.

748
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
You're a 5th.

749
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:43,920
You have to save more blood than others.

750
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,920
You have to save more blood than others.

751
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,920
Sometimes you're too tired.

752
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:48,920
You're hurt.

753
00:37:48,920 --> 00:37:50,920
It's actually very hard.

754
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,920
You have to endure it.

755
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,920
You can't let anyone know.

756
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,920
You're a man who's greedy.

757
00:37:56,920 --> 00:37:58,920
You're a man who's greedy.

758
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
You're a man who's greedy.

759
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:02,920
You're a man who's greedy.

760
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:04,920
You're not like anyone else.

761
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:19,920
What are you thinking?

762
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,920
I'm thinking...

763
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,920
if we knew each other earlier...

764
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,120
No.

765
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:31,880
Why?

766
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,600
Like this, we can practice singing together

767
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:40,960
and be a good buddy

768
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,280
and have fun together.

769
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:43,520
After my job is done,

770
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,800
we can chat in this way.

771
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,920
If you should come to me, I will

772
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,160
still met you today.

773
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,800
Even though

774
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,520
I am a man

775
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:20,920
for myself,

776
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:25,740
I will always be by your side.

777
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:48,740
Mr. musique

778
00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:52,100
Going back ?

779
00:39:52,100 --> 00:39:54,880
Missing memories

780
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:59,100
slips into the air

781
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:05,180
I stuck to your heart

782
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,280
but that stones

783
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:12,460
It's myself

784
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:48,540
When I think of love, even I have to sacrifice my Barack

785
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,000
to endure this toughже

786
00:40:53,500 --> 00:41:00,360
we wait for our mistakes

787
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:06,540
your visit has indeed perished

788
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,640
you may go back

789
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,640
I can't win

790
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:14,640
I will love for you

791
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:19,640
I am willing to sing for you

792
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:25,640
I am waiting for you to come back to me

793
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,640
Aying, it's been twenty years

794
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:33,640
I've never been in the fifth class

795
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,640
I am happy

796
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Me too

797
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,640
Take me to the world

798
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:42,640
We will meet in the same place

799
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:44,640
I will

800
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:10,640
I will love for you

801
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,640
I am willing to sing for you

802
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:23,640
I am waiting for you to come back to me

803
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:41,640
I am waiting for you to come back to me

804
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:47,640
The fate is destined

805
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,640
But the so-called identity

806
00:42:51,640 --> 00:42:57,640
The silent silence wants to escape this struggle

807
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:04,640
The strangers have separated far away

808
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,640
The fate of the two of us

809
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:17,640
You are the first thing I'm looking forward to

810
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:20,640
My heart is cold

811
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:24,640
You are the most important answer

812
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:27,640
No regrets

813
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,640
The words I want to say will become a picture

814
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:38,640
A whole circle

815
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:45,640
You are the promise of love

816
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:48,640
My heart is long and I can't choose

817
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:52,640
You are the longing for a long time

818
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:55,640
I will never change

819
00:43:56,640 --> 00:44:02,640
I will give up this world for you

820
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:07,640
I am waiting for you to come back to me

821
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:13,640
The fate is destined

822
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:16,640
But the so-called identity

823
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:21,640
The silent silence wants to escape this struggle

824
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:26,640
The strangers have separated far away

825
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:30,640
The fate of the two of us

826
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:35,640
You are the first thing I'm looking forward to

827
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:41,640
My heart is cold

828
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:44,640
You are the promise of love

829
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:48,640
My heart is long and I can't choose

830
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:52,640
You are the longing for a long time

831
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,640
I will never change

832
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:03,640
I will give up this world for you
