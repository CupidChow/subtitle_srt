I heard that you continue to work in the Imperial ability for a long time,

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,080

I've heard about this person often.

27
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:36,120

31
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,920

32
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:15,720

00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:16,760
They're fighting.

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,360
Fight?

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,760
It's good to fight first.

36
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,200

37
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,400

00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,160

00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,280
Where are you going?

42
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,360
I'm a little hungry.

43
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,200
How about we have some snacks at Tang Min's?

44
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:38,400
I've heard that

45
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,480

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
It must be delicious.

47
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,360

OK.

51
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:09,800
Did you have any wounds on your arm?

52
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,760

54
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,360
the wounds in your arm.

55
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:28,760
Miss Jags,

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,840
it is not the color of you.

57
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
What are they?

58
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:45,700
��皇 exposed the hair of Zhen젉 would blow on her hair.

59
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:49,280
It is not your hair!

60
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,240
What have you done for me?

61
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,960
What have you done for me?

62
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,280
Did you do this on your own?

63
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:17,800
When we were in the same class,

64
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,560
I started doing it.

65
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,800
I always wanted to give you a chance.

66
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:24,600
But then I found out

67
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,720
you're a man who's desperate for love.

68
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,720
I burned it.

69
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,880
How can you burn it?

70
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,240
If you're not angry,

71
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,520
as long as you're not angry,

72
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:43,240
even if you scold me for a thousand words,

73
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:44,760
I'll keep it a secret.

74
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,560
Who would scold you?

75
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:54,920
I'll show you, okay?

76
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,560
I can't remember a finger.

77
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,520
Can you help me remember it?

78
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,120
It's not enough.

79
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,720
Look at me.

80
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,440
How about you just give it to me?

81
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,160
Let me see.

82
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:19,040
I Down Jump

83
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,240
Made by you and me

84
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,040
was rather useful.

85
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,600
Now that we've united,

86
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:42,920
this is a really

87
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:47,920
I'm afraid I'll die in the battlefield.

88
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,360
possessed by...

89
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,740
You failed.

90
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,140
Take care.

91
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,480
I learned from it 1000 years ago.

92
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:50,380
Please stop staring,

93
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,200
he doesn't even know you're here.

94
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,060
Where's Erdo?

95
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,680
He passed out.

96
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,800
He got sleepovers many times.

97
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,240
And I couldn't even wake him up within three days.

98
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:07,960
So good!

99
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,700
Thank you a lot.

100
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,880
the more we want.

101
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:30,940
Guards!

102
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:35,820
Could you please send us to the dock more quickly?

103
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,980
As soon as possible.

104
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:54,640
The beard- catalog bodyerv process is ten days long and Ter BigQuery is made of yolk blood.

105
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,360
Qichu.

106
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,960
Hey!

107
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,920
I'll do it.

108
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:13,920
or never comes back.

109
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,120
Never.

110
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,040
You.

111
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:17,520
Never.

112
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,080
Mao decision.

113
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,640
This is too much.

114
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:32,360
You stand against me?

115
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,320
That's my problem.

116
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,320
Remember the book of moral ideals?

117
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
You had theWalfal centigrade note.

118
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,680
That day, I knew

119
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,460
the elixir online 곡

120
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:43,780
So you knew it.

121
00:10:44,380 --> 00:10:45,620
You've been watching us.

122
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,300
I know you.

123
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,580
If I didn't ask you to try it,

124
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,700
how could you be so worried?

125
00:10:51,620 --> 00:10:52,300
All right.

126
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:55,140
I'll take you back to your place.

127
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,900
Let's go.

128
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:05,180
Dado.

129
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,340
The time you went to the Cui family's army

130
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:10,420
was taken by Cui Yi.

131
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,580
You're back.

132
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:15,620
You're so exhausted.

133
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,740
But have you changed?

134
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,780
As a military ex-руп,

135
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:24,420
you've been missing my son.

136
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:26,580
He's not young anymore.

137
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,040
The嫌 könnten

138
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:29,900
as you're too weak.

139
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,900
But your son and I

140
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:36,220
all owe him four points for your wishes.

141
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,020
Thank you.

142
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:41,540
Here.

143
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,180
to the Duhuo River from the Jiuqu River.

144
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,060
Do you want to think about

145
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:48,260
the river and water relationship there?

146
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,780
It's not hard to get a blessing.

147
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,940
No.

148
00:11:54,140 --> 00:11:56,020
He won't go to the Duhuo River from the Jiuqu River.

149
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,380
He might be the emperor.

150
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,780
Cuiyi's son

151
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:02,340
was killed by someone.

152
00:12:03,020 --> 00:12:04,100
I think

153
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:06,820
he might be sent to the Western Cemetery.

154
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:09,820
Put him in the Duhuo River.

155
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,620
If Cuiyi's army

156
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:12,420
is in the Duhuo River,

157
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:13,100
Yuling...

158
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:13,900
Put him in the Duhuo River.

159
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:16,540
If he dares to use his power

160
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,140
to attack the Western Cemetery,

161
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,820
I'll kill him.

162
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:24,860
If he goes to Luoyang,

163
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:27,140
I'll send troops

164
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,980
to get rid of Li Ni.

165
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,020
Be careful.

166
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:40,420
Here.

167
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,540
sprite.

168
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:48,220
How's your wellahahaha?

169
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,740
Do you want the medicine?

170
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,460
You just don't need

171
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:51,940
вечens

172
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,300
to take this medicine.

173
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:54,740
You know

174
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,300
you pay

175
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:57,740
our well wellbeing instead.

176
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,340
I won't forgive them.

177
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:02,740
I said the nonsense

178
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:03,820
should be where your well ушionment flows.

179
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,220
Now due to the conquest of the Duhuo River,

180
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,160
I've sent the army

181
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,960
He's been working hard to get the money.

182
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,880
He's not even half the money.

183
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,480
I've sent dozens of people

184
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,720
to fight for every exit.

185
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,760
If you still want to escape this time,

186
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,440
I'll do my best for you.

187
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,280
Your Highness.

188
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,200
I'm sure you've planned everything.

189
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,160
You're going to be in the capital city

190
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,000
and you'll be in a lot of trouble.

191
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,040
No matter how strict the plan is,

192
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,440
you'll have to make a lot of efforts

193
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,600
to get the money.

194
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,240
You'll have to make a lot of efforts.

195
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,160
Since you don't have the money,

196
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:45,920
why don't you do this?

197
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:47,880
I'll help you get the money

198
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:49,000
and kill Sun Jing.

199
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:50,440
Then you can leave me.

200
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,520
What do you think?

201
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,360
It's not a deal.

202
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,360
I won't agree.

203
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:03,640
Since you care so much about me,

204
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,360
you're a little girl.

205
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,440
Don't you think you're more important than Sun Zeyi?

206
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,920
So you're more important than Sun Zeyi

207
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,640
than a single woman?

208
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,760
So you knew

209
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,240
that we were General Xiao Wei's daughters.

210
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,840
So you knew it long ago.

211
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:34,320
No wonder you refused to let me go.

212
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:37,960
Miss Taozi,

213
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,160
go out for a while.

214
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,560
I have a few words

215
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:44,400
that I want to say to your family.

216
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,080
Well.

217
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,160
Just ask General Shen,

218
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:05,360
what did I say about Erowiang?

219
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:09,000
Em.

220
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,920
When I saved you,

221
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:19,680
I write a letter

222
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:20,160
to General Cui.

223
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
General Cui.

224
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:23,760
The Chief Stewardiu of Cui's Imperial Manch 맏

225
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:24,720
enter the eenown.

226
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,400
These are all something

227
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,720
you would always focus on.

228
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,200
I hope you can lead the army

229
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,000
and take the Western capital with the Xi army.

230
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,480
Kill the thief and judge the king.

231
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,040
I can let the emperor return to the court.

232
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,560
I will return to the imperial court.

233
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,400
You are not a good person.

234
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Please let me lead the army and take the Western capital with me.

235
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,280
Although you have my letter back,

236
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:48,280
Your Highness...

237
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,440
What do you want to say?

238
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,560
Why don't you just say it?

239
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,560
I also know that

240
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,200
the daughter of the commander-in-chief of the army

241
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,720
didn't want to be the wife of the Wulie in the capital.

242
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,400
So I asked her,

243
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,800
why do you think she is so lucky?

244
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,880
So you are a good person.

245
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:07,560
Why do you think she is so lucky?

246
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:11,800
I have been thinking about it these days.

247
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,840
What kind of marriage is the wife of the Wulie?

248
00:16:14,840 --> 00:16:17,960
What kind of person is General Cui?

249
00:16:17,960 --> 00:16:20,440
Only a woman like you can be born?

250
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,840
You are talking about it.

251
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,680
Yes.

252
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,120
I have no way to be sure of General Cui's wife.

253
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,040
So I can only ask her.

254
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,440
Maybe in a while,

255
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:37,400
you will know what kind of person Fu Shui is.

256
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:41,680
I have a bad feeling.

257
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:43,120
Why?

258
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,280
I always think that she is like you.

259
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:49,440
She is smart and a very good person.

260
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,160
I don't know how she will punish me

261
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,240
if I offend her like this.

262
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,960
Father, you are the only daughter of me.

263
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,640
You threaten her with me.

264
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:02,360
Fu Shui will react to it.

265
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,760
You don't have to say it.

266
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:07,800
If you fall into her hands,

267
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:11,800
she will pull you out of her hands.

268
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:18,080
Then I have to be careful.

269
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,280
Don't fall into her hands.

270
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,080
General,

271
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:36,280
the pretext is to send annesota exponential strike.

272
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,400
You can make it basic.

273
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:43,040
What Hook' eh?

274
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,160
Good thing we got the sfx.

275
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,160
Since you're hiding in Luoyang,

276
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:52,880
and dare to kill my son,

277
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,280
I, Cui's family, will definitely be replaced by Yanluo.

278
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:00,560
What?

279
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:02,160
Cui Yi has no son.

280
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,160
Only a daughter?

281
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:04,840
He Xiaowei is Cui Lin.

282
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:07,280
The one who died is a liar.

283
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,080
Impossible.

284
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,320
Absolutely impossible.

285
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,080
Shi Qilong,

286
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,480
you're trying to marry He Shi,

287
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,760
so you've made a fool of me, right?

288
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:18,680
Yes.

289
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,960
Think about it.

290
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,520
You've been Cui's attitude towards He Xiaowei.

291
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:28,280
If you think about it again,

292
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:29,600
I don't need to lie to you.

293
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,280
So that's the case.

294
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:36,440
So,

295
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,800
you kept him in the Taiqing Palace and didn't want to let him go.

296
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,680
Then you kept a secret from the soldiers here.

297
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,240
You wanted to use him to break Cui Yi's leg.

298
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:47,120
How can I say it's a break?

299
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:48,400
Of course, it's a request.

300
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,320
Pingliang, the general, Cui Yi,

301
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,440
looks like our Zheng Xi Jun

302
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
saved his love for you.

303
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,600
With me,

304
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,640
Prince Qin is a judge.

305
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,800
He's a good man.

306
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,280
You're drunk.

307
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:07,800
Come.

308
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:08,360
Come.

309
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:12,480
The flowers Prince Qin gave you today are pretty.

310
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,120
They've all turned into flowers.

311
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,920
How could you turns it into flowers with me?

312
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:22,760
Hey,

313
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,520
why do you look like

314
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,200
you've changed?

315
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,360
What's changed?

316
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,560
You've changed back

317
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,960
to the old lady.

318
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,200
I think

319
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:40,640
in a few days,

320
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,240
I might be able to go back

321
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,240
to my father.

322
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,760
If this disease can't be cured,

323
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,640
wouldn't it make him worried?

324
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,200
You've already thought of a way to get out of here.

325
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,440
I'm afraid that my father has fallen into the army

326
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,120
and is afraid that he'll be out of the city.

327
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,760
The situation has changed.

328
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,680
This divorce

329
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,880
won't last long.

330
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:04,960
That's great.

331
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm just thinking

332
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:14,680
that if you

333
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:17,880
could take the risk,

334
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,720
that would be great.

335
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:22,920
Why don't you

336
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,600
took the risk?

337
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,760
And

338
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,280
vice-president.

339
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,200
Tell him we're leaving

340
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,440
to ask for rest from your father.

341
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,080
Or

342
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:49,520
but she still wants his life.

343
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,180
She should live well.

344
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,600
This is the best comfort for the world.

345
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,640
After Mother expires her palace,

346
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,580
father Route told me.

347
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,640
But,

348
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,040
Mr. Shu.

349
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:18,000
Well,

350
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,240
He went back two ways.

351
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,200
He went to Luoyang all the way.

352
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:21,840
He came all the way to our camp.

353
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:24,000
You're right.

354
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,440
Sun Jing,

355
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,720
really used Luoyang City to attack.

356
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,400
He sent soldiers to attack the Western Army.

357
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,920
And sent a army to Luoyang City.

358
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,000
It seems he wants to cut the bottle.

359
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,000
Let's kill them here.

360
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
It's cold.

361
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,720
Why are there so many flowers?

362
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,960
Prince Qin ordered me to send flowers every day.

363
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:50,080
I took all the flowers and water.

364
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,680
I can take them all.

365
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,040
If I can't, I'll be in jail.

366
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,040
It's not a waste.

367
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:57,600
Taozi is really a trouble.

368
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,600
He stays here every day.

369
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,000
He's bored.

370
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,800
He has to do some things.

371
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,680
The clothes Prince Qin sent me

372
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,080
are really pretty.

373
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:17,920
Xiao Wei,

374
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:21,000
I think you'd better dress up like this.

375
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,840
You like to dress up

376
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,400
like a beautiful girl.

377
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,960
Xiao Wei is really

378
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:33,680
a good match in the army.

379
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:37,320
But you're not dressed like today.

380
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:40,040
I think you're the most beautiful one.

381
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,640
Why didn't Prince Qin come today?

382
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,080
I guess he must have been

383
00:23:49,080 --> 00:23:50,200
a burden to the leader.

384
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,920
Maybe

385
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,200
the commander is here.

386
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:57,080
Luoyang City is really a trouble.

387
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,680
It's a good time to try.

388
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:00,280
If Luoyang City is broken,

389
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,600
the people in the capital

390
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:03,240
will come to the city

391
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,200
and meet them to attack us.

392
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,520
Then,

393
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,400
it'll be a great disaster.

394
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:09,760
Old Si,

395
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,120
let's bet.

396
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:11,640
What?

397
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
We bet on Luoyang City.

398
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,800
How many cards can he get?

399
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,920
I don't know.

400
00:24:15,160 --> 00:24:15,960
Luoyang City

401
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,120
I guess we can't keep up half an hour.

402
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,060
From a code

403
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:20,520
to a man!

404
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:22,760
Now we can only hope

405
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:25,240
we would be able to謀噓靜一族.

406
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,420
I bet they'll spare a second to speak on these.

407
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,840
The war broke out.

408
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,080
I'm afraid that

409
00:24:52,420 --> 00:24:53,120
Yuzhel

410
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,240
will be attacked as well.

411
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:57,600
The army has been fighting outside

412
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,400
with the lord's name.

413
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,160
The commander-in-chief has been going to Yingzhou for a long time.

414
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,600
But he has been out of the army

415
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:03,240
and has been breaking into the army.

416
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,760
Li Ni is very secretive.

417
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:08,280
He can't even touch the commander-in-chief's position

418
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,040
and won't act recklessly.

419
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,640
What does Prince Qin want to do?

420
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,160
Does he want to fight with the general?

421
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,520
The general is a good soldier.

422
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,760
He is a good soldier.

423
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,040
Li Ni's top strategy

424
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,920
must be to pull the commander-in-chief

425
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,240
to the west of the river and conquer the west.

426
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,640
He will protect the country and the world.

427
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,600
Li Ni is quite a good man.

428
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,760
My lady, don't tell him anything.

429
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,680
The general is coming this time.

430
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,160
We must take him a good walk

431
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,240
and give him a breath.

432
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:42,760
Don't worry.

433
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,360
I won't tell him.

434
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,520
Besides,

435
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,560
he is a good man.

436
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:50,320
Why should I tell him?

437
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,640
They followed him Turbabil,

438
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,800
говоря forannie the Shortly Prince

439
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:00,880
Mr.ası is a good rubber man.

440
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:02,160
The guards can go quickly.

441
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,120
He will settle for a covered news.

442
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,160
And the soldiers

443
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,360
have brought them medical있a.

444
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,400
This battle

445
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,320
have been screwed over a lot of people.

446
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:18,840
Mr.ck,

447
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:21,560
Chui started the rank macro from Feng� records.

448
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,320
Prince Qing and喔 Wang

449
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:24,280
and his undergrounddie relationship

450
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,600
his royal share.

451
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,600
According to His Majesty and His Majesty's chief,

452
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:31,360
起, You and arrangement

453
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:34,040
of thecells and secular city of Tang except you.

454
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,400
Otherwise,

455
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,240
we'll see you during your trip.

456
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,340
There's no god, a father,

457
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,600
but there's wife and daughter.

458
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,000
I bear no blame for my own parents.

459
00:26:54,280 --> 00:26:55,040
aggericy.

460
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,400
Do I need to find it?

461
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:57,880
I promise.

462
00:26:58,800 --> 00:26:59,960
Hello, Your Highness.

463
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,760
Your Highness.

464
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:07,120
Please have some tea.

465
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,840
Thank you.

466
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,020
of the Sui Hope Manor's Double Manor.

467
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,480
Your Highness is very kind these days.

468
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,280
His Majesty is not thatannya.

469
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,640
If anyone wants to see another me,

470
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:39,480
I'll give it to her.

471
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,840
Move the crowd, Your Highness.

472
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,600
Since I'm here,

473
00:27:44,280 --> 00:27:46,320
he must be hoping that I'm not handsome

474
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,960
and will have any feelings for him.

475
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,960
I was curious about your father.

476
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,960
What kind of person is he?

477
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:54,960
I couldn't tell the truth.

478
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,960
He is different from you.

479
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,960
You don't need to be his daughter.

480
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,960
He doesn't need to be your father.

481
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,960
What do you mean?

482
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,960
Your father is no longer a coward.

483
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:12,960
My father and my brothers

484
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,960
were all taken by your father.

485
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,960
Both brothers were taken by your father.

486
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:24,960
You are so kind.

487
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:28,960
I think you are very suspicious.

488
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,960
You think you are so nice?

489
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,960
Do you think your father is more?

490
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,960
Or your mother is more?

491
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:38,960
Don't think that you are talking about sweet words.

492
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,960
I will forget that you put me under this position.

493
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,960
I will not spare your father's kindness.

494
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,960
But...

495
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,960
I just want to see you again.

496
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,960
I don't know when and where.

497
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:06,960
You plan to let me go?

498
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,960
General Cui wrote to me

499
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,960
that he hopes to see you tomorrow.

500
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,960
I dare not leave.

501
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,960
Tomorrow?

502
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,960
Tomorrow.

503
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,960
Tomorrow?

504
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,960
Tomorrow.

505
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,960
It's too soon.

506
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,960
Try it.

507
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:10,960
You really made it?

508
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,960
Can you hear it?

509
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:25,960
I will be right next to you

510
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,960
as long as you think about it.

511
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,960
I will be right next to you.

512
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,960
I am here.

513
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,960
What's wrong?

514
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:55,960
Don't you like it?

515
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,960
I like it too.

516
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,960
I just want to eat the pig's ear.

517
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:09,960
I will go buy it for you.

518
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,960
Don't be sad. I will be back soon.

519
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,960
What's wrong? What happened?

520
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,960
I am leaving tomorrow.

521
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,960
Are you really going to buy the pig's ear now?

522
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:27,960
I will go buy it.

523
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:31,960
Then,

524
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,960
didn't you say you want to eat it?

525
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,960
You...

526
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,960
You really don't want to take the medicine.

527
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:01,960
You...

528
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,960
How is it?

529
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,960
Shi Qi Lang.

530
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,960
Didn't you say there are heavy soldiers around here?

531
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:37,960
There are many people after the war?

532
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,960
Yes.

533
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:42,960
If we leave here and wander around,

534
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:46,960
will anyone find out?

535
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:50,960
Try it.

536
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,960
Come on.

537
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:03,960
Who will go first?

538
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:04,960
Ma Zhou.

539
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:06,960
Okay.

540
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:30,960
What's wrong?

541
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,960
Wait.

542
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:42,960
Wait.

543
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:55,960
I told you.

544
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:01,960
I will go.

545
00:34:05,960 --> 00:34:07,960
I don't know who will be the father.

546
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:10,960
Then,

547
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,960
compare it again.

548
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,960
See who will go first.

549
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,960
The sunset in the garden is beautiful.

550
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:32,960
I am so beautiful.

551
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:01,960
Actually,

552
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,960
I have been curious about

553
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,960
how you know my identity.

554
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:09,960
The poison of the Cui family's eldest lady

555
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,960
is not an ordinary person's ability.

556
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,960
My identity

557
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,960
and the relationship with the young master,

558
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,960
no one suspects it.

559
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:19,960
How can you see it?

560
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:22,960
You lied to me

561
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
that you are the master's concubine.

562
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,960
I am suspicious of your identity.

563
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,960
So I tried to seduce the young master.

564
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:30,960
But you are more serious.

565
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,960
Your identity is not simple.

566
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:36,960
You and your young master are famous and well-known.

567
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,960
He is more concerned about you.

568
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:39,960
Before we left Luoyang City,

569
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:40,960
I broke the promise

570
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:43,960
that you would be the first to go to the town for your young master.

571
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:45,960
I knew it.

572
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:46,960
You opened my mask

573
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,960
and didn't have to worry about me.

574
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,960
But I was just taking you to the town.

575
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,960
How could you be sure

576
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:54,960
that I am the daughter of the father?

577
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:55,960
Of course,

578
00:35:55,960 --> 00:35:56,960
you are in Tongguan,

579
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,960
and you don't care about the safety of the capital.

580
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:00,960
It may seem that the others are all innocent.

581
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,960
But after I thought about it,

582
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,960
I always felt something was wrong.

583
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:06,960
I finally guessed it.

584
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:09,960
So you knew it long ago.

585
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:15,960
Do you know that

586
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I often think

587
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:20,960
if you are not the daughter of the Cui family,

588
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,960
I am not the son of the master.

589
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,960
Will there be

590
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:27,960
so many harmonies and arguments between us?

591
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:30,960
Shiqielang,

592
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:33,960
you are the God of the heavens.

593
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,960
We are all inseparable.

594
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:39,960
Yes.

595
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:42,960
I thought that

596
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:43,960
no one could save

597
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:45,960
the chaos that was going on.

598
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:48,960
I didn't want to see the people of the world

599
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,960
suffer the chaos.

600
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:52,960
So I asked for a revenge

601
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:53,960
and asked my master

602
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,960
to take us to the south of the Cui family.

603
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:58,960
It was just to make the world peaceful.

604
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:01,960
But I didn't expect

605
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:02,960
you to be the only one

606
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:04,960
in the Li family.

607
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:09,960
Do you have any other choice

608
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,960
when you were in the jade?

609
00:37:12,960 --> 00:37:13,960
One for one.

610
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:22,960
Shiqielang,

611
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:24,960
Shiqielang,

612
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:26,960
have you ever thought

613
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:28,960
if one day

614
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:30,960
you can take over the Western capital,

615
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,960
after the chaos is settled,

616
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:35,960
what kind of princess

617
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,960
do you need in the world?

618
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:40,960
Your father is a

619
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:42,960
trustee,

620
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,960
a prince,

621
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:44,960
and a concubine.

622
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:47,960
And your grandchild.

623
00:37:47,960 --> 00:37:49,960
I want to find him.

624
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:50,960
But I want to say

625
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,960
that my father is his master.

626
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:56,960
He is a smart and good-natured man.

627
00:37:57,960 --> 00:37:58,960
In the future,

628
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:01,960
he will be a good princess.

629
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,960
If your grandchild doesn't come back,

630
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,960
and your father

631
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,960
doesn't want to be his master,

632
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:16,960
let's think about it.

633
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,960
After we take the world peace

634
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:20,960
and return to the Taicun,

635
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,960
we will leave the Western capital

636
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:24,960
and go to the Lan Temple together

637
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:26,960
to spend a free life.

638
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:28,960
Okay?

639
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:39,960
Although I know it's not true,

640
00:38:40,960 --> 00:38:41,960
but I'm happy

641
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:44,960
to hear you say it.

642
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:51,960
I think

643
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:54,960
I'll take the world peace

644
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,960
and return to the Taicun.

645
00:38:58,960 --> 00:38:59,960
I'm so happy.

646
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
It's great.

647
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
I'm happy.

648
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:05,960
I'm so happy.

649
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,960
I'm so happy.

650
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:09,960
I'm so happy.

651
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:11,960
I'm so happy.

652
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:13,960
I'm so happy.

653
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:15,960
I'm so happy.

654
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,960
I'm so happy.

655
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,960
I'm so happy.

656
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:21,960
I'm so happy.

657
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,960
I'm so happy.

658
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:25,960
I'm so happy.

659
00:39:25,960 --> 00:39:28,960
I'm so happy.

660
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:34,960
I'll be there the day.

661
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,960
We'll go to the Lan Temple

662
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:39,960
to stay in the paradise

663
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:41,960
and ride the horse to the city.

664
00:39:42,960 --> 00:39:43,960
Let's go to the mountains and rivers,

665
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:45,960
okay?

666
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,880
every nook and sill.

667
00:39:50,680 --> 00:39:54,680
Nothing is more apparent in hotels than shopping malls or diverse食べ and일impression.

668
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:59,800
Then when will Luksam also return to Happy Name Store meeting

669
00:40:00,360 --> 00:40:01,320
with D Hearts' girl?

670
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,520
On that time,

671
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:03,960
is it possible to

672
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,320
avoid this problem every day?

673
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:16,720
Know better if you

674
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,880
I don't know what happened.

675
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,920
I was in love with you that day.

676
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,400
Today,

677
00:40:24,080 --> 00:40:25,080
I'm done with the trick.

678
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:47,840
No.

679
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,280
Dad,

680
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:51,120
thank you.

681
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,480
I'll be more eventful.

682
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,960
I'll come back with water skills.

683
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:04,080
If you want to save my father,

684
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:05,880
you should have at least

685
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:07,680
killed me.

686
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,560
Eixin!

687
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:13,920
A'Ying,

688
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,160
you grew up with your young master.

689
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:21,240
I think you care about this matter.

690
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,040
Of course.

691
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,440
It's the first time I've met you.

692
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,840
You're so secretive.

693
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:26,040
I feel uncomfortable.

694
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,160
Then why do you still ask?

695
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,360
Young master,

696
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:35,200
he's no longer in the human world.

697
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:40,280
I just want to hear you tell me clearly.

698
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,280
I don't have any guess in my mind.

699
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,440
I promise I won't ask you anymore.

700
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,840
Young master's real name is Liu Chengfeng.

701
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,200
When he was young, he saved me.

702
00:41:54,040 --> 00:41:55,240
His parents died early.

703
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,800
So his father raised him as a son.

704
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:03,000
When my mother was young, she was injured and she was unwell.

705
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,840
So she had a 10-year-old baby with him.

706
00:42:06,640 --> 00:42:07,640
At that time,

707
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:09,720
he was a frontier general.

708
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,760
In the court, he was forced to be a father

709
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,920
and he was so unwell.

710
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,880
He had to give him a wife.

711
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,560
Then my mother was heartbroken.

712
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,320
She was sick and had to take medicine.

713
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,200
Finally, she had me.

714
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:24,680
But he couldn't handle the court.

715
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,160
His father became a liar.

716
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:27,560
He gave birth to a boy.

717
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,400
According to the ranking of the Cui family,

718
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:31,000
he was called Cui Lin.

719
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,720
He was a prisoner of the court.

720
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,600
So that's the case.

721
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,760
Later,

722
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,800
I accepted the challenge in Yingzhou.

723
00:42:41,800 --> 00:42:43,920
Mother fought in a battle.

724
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,280
She sent her governmentbringing her mother as Secretary of Cooperation

725
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,120
and the Joint and now I am their wife.

726
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:54,520
I thank my mother for yourぶelessness and filial piety.

727
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:58,840
Then I also regarded me as a manly boy.

728
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:00,800
But in my later years,

729
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:03,640
I didn't continue acting like one anymore.

730
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,240
Father asked Liu Chengfeng

731
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:06,840
to lead my Cui Lin

732
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,480
to walk in the army

733
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:10,880
so that I wouldn't be exposed by the female doctor.

734
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:13,760
Because of me,

735
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:15,280
Prince was in danger

736
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:16,640
since he was little.

737
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:19,280
Even his name

738
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,920
was not known by others.

739
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,640
So he lived

740
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,360
and became my shadow.

741
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,280
We grew up together.

742
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,080
I treated him as my brother.

743
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,840
Naturally, he would be closer to others.

744
00:43:32,840 --> 00:43:34,000
He was closer to others.

745
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,080
You treat him as your brother.

746
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:38,840
He doesn't like you.

747
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,120
He's not around anymore.

748
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:43,800
Do you still mind?

749
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:48,440
Why do you always say that?

750
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:49,440
What about you?

751
00:43:51,240 --> 00:43:52,000
What's wrong with me?

752
00:43:52,520 --> 00:43:53,880
The lady in the Gu family

753
00:43:54,040 --> 00:43:55,080
is very loyal to you.

754
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:56,640
When she was in the Western capital,

755
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:57,840
she didn't want to risk her life

756
00:43:58,040 --> 00:43:59,360
to report to you in the inn.

757
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:01,160
Don't you dare to change her love?

758
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:04,000
Miss Gu loves me and I love her.

759
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:05,800
But it's different.

760
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:07,720
She loves me very much.

761
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:09,080
I don't love her.

762
00:44:09,320 --> 00:44:10,600
I'm disappointed in her.

763
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:24,920
Treating you as your brother

764
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:27,080
is the best thing in life.

765
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:29,560
Never win hope, never give up.

766
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:44,880
17 Lang.

767
00:44:45,480 --> 00:44:46,680
Can you sing for me?

768
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,080
How can I sing?

769
00:44:49,480 --> 00:44:51,360
I just know a bit of music on my travels.

770
00:44:51,720 --> 00:44:53,080
Also, music.

771
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:54,240
I want to hear it.

772
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:55,240
Okay.

773
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:04,240
The first bowl of water is that

774
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,240
Yin Song Tan.

775
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:11,240
Yin Song Tan, you fly away from the rain.

776
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,240
The girl in the ice pool has opened her window.

777
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:19,240
The first bowl of water is that

778
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
You sing badly.

779
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,240
I'm a little bit out of tune.

780
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:27,240
You still let me sing.

781
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:28,240
But it's a good song.

782
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
Really?

783
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:32,240
Then let's sing it seriously.

784
00:45:32,240 --> 00:45:33,240
Okay.

785
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
Then I'm going to stand up and sing it seriously.

786
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:45,240
The first bowl of water is that

787
00:45:45,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Yin Song Tan, you fly away from the rain.

788
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:55,240
The girl in the ice pool has opened her window.

789
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:03,240
The first bowl of water is that

790
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,240
Yin Song Tan,

791
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
you sing badly.

792
00:46:25,240 --> 00:46:26,240
I'm a little bit out of tune.

793
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:27,240
I'm a little bit out of tune.

794
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:28,240
I'm a little bit out of tune.

795
00:46:29,240 --> 00:46:30,240
If you don't wake up again,

796
00:46:32,240 --> 00:46:33,240
I'll...

797
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:35,240
I'm going to wake up.

798
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
I'm really going to wake up.

799
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:42,960
I'll...

800
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,880
I'll kiss you.

801
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:51,480
I'll kiss you.

802
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:45,340
I want to protect our faith

803
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:47,640
and hold onto your hands

804
00:48:47,640 --> 00:48:51,640
the spirit of our world

805
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:55,120
with one hand and purple.

806
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,760
We've failed in our homework firms.

807
00:48:59,280 --> 00:49:01,760
But I've experienced world beauty.

808
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,200
No more mistakes.

809
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:10,680
There are no changes.

810
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:50,240
The world is so cold

811
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:58,240
You are the first hope, the light is up

812
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:05,240
You are the final answer, I will not be wrong

813
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:11,240
The words I want to say will become the fire fist

814
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:17,240
One by one

815
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:25,240
You are the only promise, my heart is not idle

816
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:33,240
You are the eternal faith, I will not lie

817
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:39,240
I will not be disloyal to you

818
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:45,240
I will not be wrong
