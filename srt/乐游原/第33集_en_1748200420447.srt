1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,760
Someone Phantasmagoria

2
00:00:04,260 --> 00:00:05,380
Heidi

3
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:08,120
Juliet

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:09,260
Hurry up

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,640
while you block

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:21,700
and create the illusion

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,120
that this situation

8
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:33,120
My night has passed, and the night has become long

9
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:39,120
I want to go to the end of the dark

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,120
The long journey

11
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:46,120
When the encounter is different

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,120
When the encounter is distant

13
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,120
I never forget

14
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,120
The ocher of light

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,120
The sky is bright, and the wind is strong

16
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,120
The wind blows in the broken wind

17
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:12,120
The sky is bright, and the wind is strong

18
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:14,120
The wind is strong, and the wind is strong

19
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:18,120
The cold snow in the snow is cold, and the wind is strong

20
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,120
I will wait for you by my side

21
00:01:51,940 --> 00:01:53,040
At ease.

22
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:55,660
Father.

23
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,560
Get up.

24
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,480
Take out the meal!

25
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:13,780
Theavat signed the memorial signs saying it wasn'tำaaa.

26
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:16,380
I see Your Majesty.

27
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,260
Long live Your Majesty.

28
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,280
All right.

29
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,280
Enough

30
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:25,240
say, who did you come out against to?

31
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:27,780
He's come out withkes

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:29,240
and come to monopoly the蛊

33
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,240
at our gate

34
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,600
If we assembly ackanting

35
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,860
the Iron Qi mustwest we

36
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,960
but he's vote to media

37
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,460
not only rises to kill us and the court

38
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:43,280
but also say the chiefs of our guys

39
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,320
are like vodka deputy

40
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:49,960
Your Majesty, this person is the leader of the Ministry of Health of Cuiyi.

41
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,000
He's a brave and brave man. He's a great man.

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,120
That's why he's doing this.

43
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,120
Nonsense!

44
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,120
We're the most straightforward people in the world.

45
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,120
We can't defeat the enemy.

46
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,120
We can't defeat the enemy.

47
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,920
Cuiyi promised to fight with us.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:06,520
But he killed all of my old and weak men.

49
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,920
How could I be convinced?

50
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:09,520
Cuiyi is a failure. Why did you do that?

51
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,920
I heard the sword.

52
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:15,320
I've never seen a prince like that.

53
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:17,720
I don't know how generous you are.

54
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,520
You've not only killed my life,

55
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,720
but also killed my doctor.

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,120
I'm the leader of the capital.

57
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,720
That's what I know.

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,320
Cuiyi did this

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,520
not because His Majesty ordered him to.

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,520
He did it on his own.

61
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:32,520
I said,

62
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:36,920
if you dare to do it, you'll get it.

63
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:38,720
Look.

64
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,920
This family is being forced to do it.

65
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,920
Your Majesty, Cuiyi is a great man.

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,520
His family is in the Silver City.

67
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,120
He's been fighting with them for years.

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,720
He's not using them to collude.

69
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,520
Your Majesty,

70
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,920
as a leader,

71
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,920
the five generals have always been helping the government.

72
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:59,720
Why can't he collude with them?

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:01,720
We know that.

74
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:04,120
Cuiyi killed all of his old and weak men.

75
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:07,120
This one is the one who's going to attack them.

76
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,920
Nonsense!

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:11,920
His family is in the hands of the people.

78
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,920
And Cuiyi's wife,

79
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,720
she died for the sake of the capital.

80
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,320
She's called Mrs. Wulie because of me.

81
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
She's fighting with them to kill them.

82
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,520
How could Cuiyi collude with them?

83
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,720
Your Majesty,

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
there must be a reason for the rebellion.

85
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,120
The White Water Temple is too coincidental.

86
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,120
Why is it so coincidental?

87
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,720
Cuiyi's son, Gang Quanxiang,

88
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,120
lost the White Water Temple.

89
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,720
And the army of Cuiyi is in the left.

90
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,520
They're waiting for the great justice.

91
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,120
I think we should investigate this matter.

92
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,720
I don't understand

93
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,320
why General Pei doesn't know that Cui's army

94
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:49,920
has been completely destroyed by Cuiyi.

95
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,320
Could it be that

96
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:53,720
there's a reason for the rebellion?

97
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,920
You're still trying to fool me?

98
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,120
If it wasn't for the new order,

99
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:57,920
why did General Pei

100
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,320
bite Cuiyi and collude with them at once?

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:03,920
This is a big crime.

102
00:05:03,920 --> 00:05:05,520
Could General Pei

103
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:06,920
have the life of the Shen family

104
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,320
to be able to protect Cuiyi?

105
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:10,920
Is it possible that

106
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,120
General Pei's life is in danger?

107
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,920
Shouldn't we investigate this matter?

108
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,720
You're lying!

109
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,920
Enough!

110
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,320
The alliance is not a court matter.

111
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Since you said that Cuiyi colluded with you,

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,320
how did you collude with them?

113
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,920
Who sent you to the secret alliance?

114
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,320
Since there's a secret alliance,

115
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,720
how did you know?

116
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,720
Since you knew,

117
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,120
why didn't Cuiyi kill you?

118
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,120
Cuiyi was the one who kept Liu Chengfeng

119
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,920
in the secret alliance with us.

120
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
I'm the nephew of the secret alliance.

121
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,320
So he told me about the secret alliance.

122
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,720
Cuiyi didn't kill me.

123
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,720
It's because he didn't know

124
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,720
that I knew that he had collusion with the secret alliance.

125
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,320
You're my servant.

126
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:08,120
His Majesty has forgiven you.

127
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,520
But you betrayed me,

128
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,520
and you're already in a state of emergency.

129
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,920
Also,

130
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,720
don't think that if you die,

131
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,920
you can heal and lose.

132
00:06:23,920 --> 00:06:26,120
I'll personally lead the troops

133
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:28,120
to defeat you all.

134
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
I'm telling the truth!

135
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,920
You're going to die on your own!

136
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,320
Just like how Cuiyi colluded with General Cuiyi.

137
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Cuiyi's son, Liu Chengfeng, has also started.

138
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,120
Why don't you ask him in?

139
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,120
He knows it better than I do.

140
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,920
All right.

141
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:44,720
Bring Liu Chengfeng up.

142
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,120
Yes.

143
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,720
Liu Chengfeng is here.

144
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:10,120
Liu Chengfeng, the guilty man,

145
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,720
greets His Majesty.

146
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,320
Long live His Majesty!

147
00:07:15,320 --> 00:07:17,120
Since you're in the hands of him,

148
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,120
then tell me.

149
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,120
What exactly is Cuiyi and General Cuiyi

150
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,120
doing?

151
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,720
Yes.

152
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,720
Cuiyi told me that

153
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,120
he didn't want to keep the power of the Cui family

154
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,120
and didn't want to fight with General Cui.

155
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,120
He said that he didn't want to fight with General Cuiyi.

156
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
He didn't want to fight with General Cuiyi.

157
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,720
He was worried that the court would

158
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,920
withdraw the Cui family's army

159
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:43,120
and want to make two full preparations.

160
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,120
So he sent me to have a secret talk with the Cui family

161
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,120
and I, Yang Zuo,

162
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
persuaded him to sell the White Water Pass.

163
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,320
In this way,

164
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,120
I can stay in the Cui family

165
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,120
and leave a way for the Cui family.

166
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:56,120
But actually,

167
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:59,120
Cuiyi had already talked to the Cui family.

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
With his commanding the White Water Pass,

169
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,920
he was able to defeat the Yang Zuo.

170
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,920
So Cuiyi made a great contribution.

171
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,920
The court would not withdraw the Cui family's army.

172
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,920
Cuiyi could withdraw the army as soon as possible.

173
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:12,920
Once the court has the will to withdraw,

174
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:14,920
it will lead to the capture of the border.

175
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,920
Cuiyi also promised

176
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,920
to attack the Cui family secretly.

177
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:21,920
He will capture the salt and iron equipment

178
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:23,920
that is only needed.

179
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,920
He will take the blame.

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,920
Why did you start today?

181
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,920
Cuiyi sold the White Water Pass

182
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:35,920
as a pawn to me.

183
00:08:35,920 --> 00:08:37,920
He even made me feel sorry for him.

184
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,920
I was afraid that I would face the Cui family

185
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,920
and the Cui family

186
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,920
with my own parents.

187
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:45,920
But Cuiyi was so shameless

188
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,920
and arrogant.

189
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,920
Everyone thought he was a good man.

190
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:51,920
He committed suicide and died in vain.

191
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,920
He was so arrogant.

192
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,920
He was so arrogant.

193
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,920
But he was a member of the imperial court.

194
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,920
He couldn't defeat the Mai State.

195
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,920
He was the most arrogant.

196
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,920
So

197
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,920
he was able to kill the Yi

198
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
and take the front.

199
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,920
Liu Chongfeng. Liu Chongfeng.

200
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,920
Cuiyi is so arrogant.

201
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:32,920
How could you kill him

202
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
just for a few days?

203
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:39,920
Your Highness, you are so protective of Cuiyi.

204
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:43,920
Is it because of the selfishness of Yi?

205
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Your Majesty.

206
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,920
Cuiyi used to come to the capital

207
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
to take care of the people.

208
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
He saved His Majesty's life in the chaos of the two kings.

209
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
If he wanted to defeat the Mai State,

210
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
why would he...

211
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,920
It's not because he and his sister colluded

212
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,920
that he would have been hurt by His Majesty in time.

213
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:06,920
Your Majesty.

214
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,920
Just like the eldest sister,

215
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:12,920
he colluded with his sister

216
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:14,920
to take care of the state of the palace.

217
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,920
Yes, you are right.

218
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,920
How could he be so arrogant

219
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,920
and make him feel sorry for him every time?

220
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:24,920
Your Majesty.

221
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,920
Only the General Cuiyi

222
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,920
can return to the court right now.

223
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,920
We will find out the details and we will know the details.

224
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:34,920
Is Cuiyi's life in the capital

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,920
a lie?

226
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,920
Your Majesty.

227
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,920
We can only take the front troops

228
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,920
and take Cuiyi back to the capital.

229
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,920
We should also prevent the chaos of the Cuiyi's army.

230
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,920
I will take care of it.

231
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
I will take care of it.

232
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:54,920
Your Majesty.

233
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,920
Your Majesty.

234
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:22,920
Miss.

235
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:24,920
Do you want to leave with me?

236
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,920
As long as we leave,

237
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,920
we will be able to pass the test.

238
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
But if we don't leave,

239
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:33,920
the General Cuiyi will only worry about you more.

240
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,920
This is a long-awaited plan.

241
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,920
The enemy came from the four sides.

242
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:41,920
Now we are confused.

243
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:42,920
The enemy is in the dark.

244
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:44,920
I don't know what kind of traps

245
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,920
will be waiting for us.

246
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,920
What should we do now?

247
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:51,920
I am thinking.

248
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,920
As long as father can return to the capital

249
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:54,920
and the Cuiyi's army,

250
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,920
the court will not be able to

251
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,920
do anything about it.

252
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:01,920
Let's think about it later.

253
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,920
His Highness hasn't left the palace yet.

254
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:06,920
How about you discuss it

255
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,920
after His Highness comes back?

256
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,920
No.

257
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,920
When Xianyi was in the palace,

258
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:13,920
he was the general.

259
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:15,920
He was involved in the chaos of the two kings.

260
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,920
He was a bit worried.

261
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
He didn't want to be involved.

262
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,920
He should have avoided Xianyi.

263
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,920
When did this happen?

264
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,920
Why are you still thinking so much?

265
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,920
He always thinks for me.

266
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,920
I should also think for him.

267
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:49,920
Mr. Shiqi.

268
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:51,920
I have been waiting for you since I left the palace.

269
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,920
I haven't seen you since the night of the wait.

270
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,920
What's wrong with your power?

271
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,920
I just came in and was in a good mood.

272
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,920
What if I have a assassin?

273
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:02,920
Because Mr. Shiqi is the best candidate,

274
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:04,920
that's why I was in a good mood.

275
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:05,920
If I were someone else,

276
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:07,920
I would have become a assassin.

277
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,920
Really?

278
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:09,920
I don't believe it.

279
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,920
Guards.

280
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:19,920
Go on.

281
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:26,920
Do you believe it now?

282
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,920
Yes.

283
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,920
I'm relieved now.

284
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,920
Your Highness came here at midnight.

285
00:13:32,920 --> 00:13:34,920
Is it to check my defense?

286
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,920
I'm worried about you and General Cui.

287
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,920
I don't know.

288
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:46,920
These evil tricks

289
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,920
are only dangerous.

290
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,920
Before they achieve the goal,

291
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,920
they won't suspect me and Father.

292
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,920
Ayang.

293
00:13:58,920 --> 00:13:59,920
Don't worry.

294
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:00,920
I won't be in trouble.

295
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:06,920
Ayang.

296
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,920
I'm sleeping.

297
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:08,920
I'm sleeping.

298
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:12,920
Where is it?

299
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:13,920
I suddenly fell asleep.

300
00:14:14,920 --> 00:14:15,920
It's the Dali Temple.

301
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
Let's go.

302
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,920
His Majesty is here.

303
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:36,920
Your Majesty,

304
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,920
please forgive me.

305
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:39,920
It's all in vain.

306
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,920
Someone even suits inside the Dali Temple.

307
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:44,920
I'm his Majesty.

308
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:48,920
I'd better sleep without working to make him feel better.

309
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,920
What's wrong with you?

310
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,920
A flames gráfic was flushed over

311
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,920
and it was black smoke entering the Tavern.

312
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:57,920
A 180-hal決 JON.

313
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,500
I heard the SO pity

314
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,640
caused themerceye even aggravated.

315
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:03,400
We should hurry before they arrive.

316
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:06,660
Theys and killer權, so robbers in Yuhua 1 are filled opinion.

317
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,900
The four of us will immediately be captured and taken to the capital.

318
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,060
We will be able to escape from the people.

319
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:13,140
We will use weapons, clothes, and supplies to carry out the investigation.

320
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:14,540
There will be no clues.

321
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,860
If you kill someone under my nose,

322
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,540
you will be able to escape.

323
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:21,140
The criminal is probably trying to

324
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,580
make all the evidence and people know the truth.

325
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:25,180
The army of the county is in a hurry to arrive.

326
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:27,100
They will rescue the injured Liu Chengfeng.

327
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,540
But he is seriously injured.

328
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,700
He can't even speak.

329
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,180
It's already so obvious.

330
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:34,660
The criminal is the one who sent Cui Yi.

331
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:37,380
The purpose is to kill someone.

332
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,460
Peixian.

333
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:40,620
I'm here.

334
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:42,500
You take a team of people to chase them.

335
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,220
If you can't,

336
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:45,820
you don't have to come back to see me.

337
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:47,100
Well...

338
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:49,140
Your Majesty.

339
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,900
General Pei's age is already high.

340
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:52,140
This is a special night.

341
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:53,220
Let Pei Yuan go.

342
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,340
Fine.

343
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:58,380
Go to陪 Fu's office immediately.

344
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,100
Let Pei Yuan take a elite soldier.

345
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:02,060
You must bring Cui Yi back.

346
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,100
Otherwise,

347
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,620
I will ask him for his crime.

348
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,060
Yes.

349
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,580
Your Majesty.

350
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,420
If this is really Cui Yi's doing,

351
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,260
I'm afraid that the daughter in the capital

352
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:15,460
is also the main person.

353
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,380
Why don't you tell the rumors?

354
00:16:17,380 --> 00:16:18,540
She's not.

355
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:24,140
How do you know she's not?

356
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:26,100
I'm in her room tonight.

357
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,220
She's not.

358
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,780
She wasn't aware of her innocence?

359
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:31,220
Your Majesty.

360
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:49,600
Not

361
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,140
The King of the Woods.

362
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:56,100
Cui is a tiger.

363
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:57,060
You...

364
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:09,020
I'll make it clear today.

365
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,180
I'll get Cui Lin as my wife.

366
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,820
No one will use her.

367
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,140
She's the only one I've recognized.

368
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,060
No matter what his不會 do to you,

369
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,460
the one I love the most

370
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,620
will always be your scholarship.

371
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:40,540
I do my justice to you,

372
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:41,660
but don't leave meivers ahead.

373
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:42,420
Then...

374
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,300
I... I finally understand.

375
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,740
As long as he's angry with me,

376
00:17:49,460 --> 00:17:51,340
he can be the emperor himself.

377
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:52,940
But...

378
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,900
What's the point of me?

379
00:17:58,100 --> 00:18:01,060
I'd rather die than be a emperor.

380
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:04,140
Your Highness,

381
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,180
please forgive me.

382
00:18:06,820 --> 00:18:09,100
Your Majesty has a pure heart.

383
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:10,860
I don't think you're a good person.

384
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,420
Even if I'm a person,

385
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,420
I won't do that.

386
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,300
Your Highness.

387
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,340
Your Highness.

388
00:18:20,260 --> 00:18:21,740
Your Highness.

389
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:33,780
Your Highness.

390
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:36,420
Why don't you go and catch General Cui?

391
00:18:37,060 --> 00:18:38,140
After that,

392
00:18:38,380 --> 00:18:39,460
the investigation has been done.

393
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:41,660
Everything is over.

394
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,220
Yes.

395
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:45,980
Don't lose your will.

396
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,060
Go there yourself.

397
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,020
As long as Cui is back,

398
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,860
I'll still recognize you as my son.

399
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,300
Or else,

400
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:58,540
I'll die in this pillar.

401
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,700
Your Majesty.

402
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,780
Your Majesty.

403
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,300
Your Majesty.

404
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,220
Your Majesty.

405
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,300
Your Highness.

406
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,060
Just listen to me.

407
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,460
Go and catch General Cui back.

408
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,660
His Majesty is wise.

409
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:13,060
He won't be wronged.

410
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:14,460
He's loyal.

411
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:17,060
If you don't catch Cui,

412
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,300
I'll kill Cui's daughter.

413
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,860
If you have the ability,

414
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:22,140
kill me

415
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,500
and be the emperor yourself.

416
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:27,820
Go now.

417
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:40,560
A world breaking news Churearks

418
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,300
will lazy the exponents,

419
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:54,440
and banish the revolt

420
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,420
My Lady.

421
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,780
We don't understand why

422
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,120
General Cui

423
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,940
ruined the mansion.

424
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:04,180
General Cui?

425
00:20:04,180 --> 00:20:04,900
Yes.

426
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:08,780
Didn't he say he'd come to see me?

427
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:09,740
No.

428
00:20:10,140 --> 00:20:11,500
He only asked me to tell you

429
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:13,020
that he brought the guards in

430
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,380
and asked the people in our mansion

431
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:15,540
not to come out for now.

432
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,500
It's almost dawn.

433
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,060
I don't know if

434
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,540
Father has passed the moon yet.

435
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:25,300
Shall we send someone

436
00:20:25,300 --> 00:20:26,420
to ask His Highness first?

437
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:28,500
No.

438
00:20:29,780 --> 00:20:30,780
I'm afraid

439
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:32,860
it's no longer the scene.

440
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,780
Let's write together.

441
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:37,540
Father,

442
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:38,420
I recommend you

443
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,380
protect the royal family first.

444
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,540
He just asked...

445
00:20:48,020 --> 00:20:49,180
An ordinary man

446
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,140
to sentence Juzibo.

447
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:53,900
Tell me,

448
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,980
but the Crown Prince

449
00:20:54,980 --> 00:20:56,420
asked Father to come here

450
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:59,100
to extended gratitude.

451
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:00,700
Father.

452
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,140
What is the state of認為ffffff's case?

453
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,460
and the army together.

454
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,060
Be at ease.

455
00:21:07,380 --> 00:21:07,900
Yes.

456
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:22,940
It's been seven or eight days.

457
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,980
Can Li Ni

458
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,460
bring Cui Yi back?

459
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,460
It's hard to say.

460
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:33,180
It's a big crime to kill a traitor.

461
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,780
If the crown prince can bring Cui Yi back,

462
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:38,460
His Majesty will investigate it.

463
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,940
You're right.

464
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:45,220
If Cui Yi kills a traitor,

465
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,900
he will be punished.

466
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:51,780
Crown prince is in love with Cui's daughter.

467
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,420
If the crown prince

468
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,620
has to marry her and be the crown princess,

469
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,060
then it's hard to cure Cui Yi.

470
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:02,300
Why don't we

471
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,500
stop in the Western capital

472
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,460
and get a crown princess married?

473
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,860
Then the life will be in vain.

474
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:13,980
If the crown prince is not here,

475
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,060
then the law

476
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:17,380
can't cure the crown princess.

477
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,900
What about Liang?

478
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:23,460
Liang doesn't need the crown prince to win.

479
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,860
And the most important thing is

480
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,220
that he can be the crown princess

481
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,300
if he's in a hurry.

482
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:30,140
Then let them cure him.

483
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:32,380
Your Majesty,

484
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:34,940
you're so thoughtful.

485
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:41,580
I know,

486
00:22:42,140 --> 00:22:44,220
you will understand me.

487
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,300
Your mother is a good girl.

488
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:50,380
I don't want to hurt her.

489
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,180
But now, she's in a hurry.

490
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,420
She can only make her a good girl first.

491
00:22:56,620 --> 00:22:58,100
When Li Yi comes back,

492
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,900
I promise to serve her as the crown princess.

493
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,340
Really?

494
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,140
No, no, no.

495
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,180
No, no.

496
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:07,620
No, no, Your Majesty.

497
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,620
How can my daughter

498
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:10,860
be the crown prince?

499
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,860
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

500
00:23:11,860 --> 00:23:13,140
Please take back your order.

501
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,860
No, no, Your Majesty.

502
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:16,980
Prime Minister Gu,

503
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:20,100
you are the best.

504
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:24,620
You are loyal to me and the late emperor.

505
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,460
I know

506
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:31,220
that you have wronged your son.

507
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,180
But now, he's in a hurry.

508
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,500
Besides you,

509
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,820
who else can I trust?

510
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,460
If Prime Minister Gu doesn't agree,

511
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,260
I...

512
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:45,740
Your Majesty, Your Majesty.

513
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,420
I didn't mean to.

514
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:50,060
If I tell anyone,

515
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:51,460
others will say that I

516
00:23:51,460 --> 00:23:53,060
will force my daughter

517
00:23:53,060 --> 00:23:55,180
into the Eastern Palace for Pan Long's sake.

518
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,780
In the future,

519
00:23:55,780 --> 00:23:59,140
you can ask me to see him.

520
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,300
Prime Minister Gu,

521
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,900
do you want me to beg you?

522
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:12,980
Your Majesty,

523
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:16,780
I can do anything for you.

524
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:19,620
Maybe I can be a traitor

525
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,260
and a traitor

526
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:24,700
for the country.

527
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,020
Good.

528
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,900
That's right.

529
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:38,220
General Pei sent it.

530
00:24:38,660 --> 00:24:41,180
And the vegetables and fruits.

531
00:24:41,420 --> 00:24:42,460
He even asked me

532
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,980
what we needed.

533
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,860
He's just his duty.

534
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:50,540
Why must he be angry with us?

535
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:52,940
But we are all so familiar with each other.

536
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
He's good.

537
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,020
He doesn't even greet us.

538
00:24:56,540 --> 00:24:57,580
He's just a soldier.

539
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,180
He's just a good man

540
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:00,460
to guard our country.

541
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:03,100
Why must he do that?

542
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:04,980
He's just a polite man.

543
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:06,220
He should do that.

544
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,940
That's even more hateful.

545
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,180
He went to catch General Pei himself.

546
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,860
He even sent Pei Yuan

547
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,260
to look at us.

548
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,780
How long has it been?

549
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,100
He can't even fly in.

550
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:21,580
Taozi,

551
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,380
have you ever thought about it?

552
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,820
We have few people in the capital.

553
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:28,140
It's better to let Pei Yuan do it.

554
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,500
It's safer

555
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:33,300
to do it than others.

556
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,540
I'm going to

557
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,460
send my order to the Eastern Palace tomorrow.

558
00:25:38,180 --> 00:25:39,740
Do you have anything else

559
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,980
to keep an eye on me?

560
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:42,300
Wanning,

561
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,100
come here.

562
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:49,940
Wang'er,

563
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:51,580
you know that

564
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:54,140
the Crown Prince is a smart man.

565
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:56,460
Child,

566
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,020
you're not different.

567
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,220
With your smart talent,

568
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,820
you can always

569
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:04,820
be the Crown Prince.

570
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,260
As long as you have a daughter,

571
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,940
it's a big deal.

572
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,940
You

573
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:12,420
will be the empress in the future.

574
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,220
Father,

575
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,380
don't worry.

576
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,460
There's a big house ahead.

577
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,620
It's a good place to learn.

578
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,220
Miss,

579
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:32,980
do you think

580
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,220
the General will come back with you?

581
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:45,980
I don't know.

582
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:49,460
If Cui Yi really comes back,

583
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,820
it's the old eagle in the cage

584
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,100
that took Zhao Ya's tiger.

585
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,900
In the court,

586
00:26:57,380 --> 00:26:58,460
in the capital,

587
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,340
there's always someone.

588
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,300
Cui Yi.

589
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,060
It's you.

590
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,780
General,

591
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,020
come with me.

592
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,260
Someone wants to take you to the foreign country

593
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,460
and take you to the capital.

594
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:41,060
I hope you can come with me

595
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,700
to solve the problem of the people.

596
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,060
So the Crown Prince

597
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,340
is here to kill me?

598
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,580
No.

599
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,300
My horse is faster than yours.

600
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,340
Besides, I have the order to go out of the city

601
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,460
and move all the soldiers in Zhou County.

602
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,580
If I have a big general,

603
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:58,100
I would have been in Xuan Zhou,

604
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,060
Qi Zhou, and Zizhou.

605
00:28:00,740 --> 00:28:01,820
Since I'm here,

606
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,620
I've been sincere.

607
00:28:06,100 --> 00:28:07,220
You chose the three places

608
00:28:07,700 --> 00:28:09,420
that suit you well.

609
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:12,060
Why don't you say so?

610
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,460
We'll be in trouble.

611
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,060
If we go back like this,

612
00:28:18,860 --> 00:28:19,780
the court will

613
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,460
make Cui's army

614
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,020
a big deal.

615
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:25,300
I'm afraid that the ring will lead me to the army.

616
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,420
I don't want to urge the general

617
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:28,500
to meet me.

618
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,620
If we fight,

619
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:32,660
the people will suffer.

620
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:34,500
If you come with me,

621
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,500
I'll do my best

622
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:38,660
to help the general get rid of the people.

623
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,620
emp straight.

624
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,340
Greetings, Mother.

625
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,660
Get up.

626
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,540
Get up.

627
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:11,500
These are the nail depetition embroidered by the late mother.

628
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,820
Make a quemop僔 for Her Highness.

629
00:29:18,580 --> 00:29:19,420
It is me.

630
00:29:19,420 --> 00:29:20,940
You can forget your accomplishments

631
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,180
after you have settled down.

632
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,780
I thank Your Majesty for letting me

633
00:29:23,780 --> 00:29:26,340
save the truth and composed the book one afterwards!

634
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,400
It's literally more than a Workshopik book!

635
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,020
It is more than a book.

636
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:43,980
Master.

637
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:44,780
Master.

638
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,620
Your Majesty.

639
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,820
Goodbye.

640
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:48,540
Cheers.

641
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:49,860
He even told me

642
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,820
that the Crown Prince

643
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,780
will be back in seven or eight days.

644
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,220
When he comes back,

645
00:29:58,540 --> 00:30:00,180
you will be married

646
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,540
and you won't have to come here every day.

647
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:05,020
You must be the Crown Prince.

648
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:09,820
Your Majesty.

649
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,100
Your Highness.

650
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,940
Your Majesty.

651
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:14,020
His Highness has already

652
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,660
entered the Chong family.

653
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:16,620
What?

654
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:18,740
The Crown Prince will be back so soon.

655
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,460
He really

656
00:30:20,620 --> 00:30:22,220
has brought Cui Yi back.

657
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,020
General.

658
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,500
Father.

659
00:30:47,060 --> 00:30:47,700
Father.

660
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,900
Why is Father really back?

661
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,060
He's back.

662
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:54,660
I'll go talk to him.

663
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,300
Your Highness.

664
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,260
Your Highness.

665
00:31:14,740 --> 00:31:15,460
Why are you here?

666
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:16,620
General Cui has returned.

667
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:17,620
He's been busy.

668
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm here.

669
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:21,060
I have something important to tell you.

670
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,300
What is it?

671
00:31:23,180 --> 00:31:24,580
His Highness hasn't been in the capital for a few days.

672
00:31:24,780 --> 00:31:26,340
His Majesty has given him a Liang Di.

673
00:31:27,860 --> 00:31:28,940
This is the daughter of my father.

674
00:31:29,180 --> 00:31:29,820
Gu Wan Yang.

675
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:30,900
What?

676
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,980
The Liang Di is in the Dong Palace.

677
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,580
The Liang Di is no longer the Crown Prince.

678
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:35,940
As long as you don't go back,

679
00:31:36,140 --> 00:31:37,260
you can send her to the Dong Palace.

680
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,300
Your Highness.

681
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:39,100
Your Highness.

682
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:39,780
Your Highness.

683
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:41,620
Your Highness.

684
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:42,820
Look at your face.

685
00:31:42,980 --> 00:31:44,580
It must have been General Cui's case.

686
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,980
He's already captured His Majesty.

687
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,500
If we go back to the palace,

688
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,820
because of Gu Liang Di's incident,

689
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:50,100
and His Majesty's rebellion,

690
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:51,700
there's no chance of a murder.

691
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:54,220
Now,

692
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:56,300
General Cui's original plan

693
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:58,220
to make Miss Cui the Crown Prince

694
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:00,220
is the most important thing.

695
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,520
All right.

696
00:32:16,420 --> 00:32:17,760
I will hear your words.

697
00:32:19,020 --> 00:32:20,180
Greetings, Your Highness.

698
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,700
Have dinner.

699
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,580
Why did father come back?

700
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:51,900
I thought that you were here alone.

701
00:32:52,900 --> 00:32:55,460
If the kid was bullied, I would come back.

702
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,100
What?

703
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,900
Did father come back late?

704
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,900
And you promised not to come back?

705
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:06,740
I know.

706
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:09,260
I came back because of you.

707
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:12,060
You are a kid.

708
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:13,700
They framed me.

709
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:15,740
I came back to see

710
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,460
what kind of a person

711
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,540
is so heartless.

712
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,460
What's wrong?

713
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:34,020
I'm just sad.

714
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,780
Father, you came back

715
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:37,340
without asking me to come back.

716
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:41,420
You know, if you don't come back,

717
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:43,740
I can't be a husband to Li Ni.

718
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,540
You came back just because of me.

719
00:33:47,140 --> 00:33:48,980
He didn't even call me if you want to.

720
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:51,100
But father doesn't want to be sad.

721
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:52,580
He wants to sell the country.

722
00:33:52,700 --> 00:33:54,020
He can't make you feel wronged.

723
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:00,060
All right.

724
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,380
Don't be sad.

725
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:03,220
Father is fine.

726
00:34:06,820 --> 00:34:07,740
Have a meal.

727
00:34:11,580 --> 00:34:12,420
Yes.

728
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,180
Your Highness, you are back.

729
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,100
Are you going to prepare the wood and jade?

730
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:42,020
Your Highness.

731
00:34:42,260 --> 00:34:43,420
Your Highness.

732
00:34:43,420 --> 00:34:44,260
Your Highness.

733
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:46,100
Please save our lady.

734
00:34:46,100 --> 00:34:46,660
No.

735
00:34:46,660 --> 00:34:48,060
Save our Liang Di.

736
00:34:48,180 --> 00:34:50,140
Liang Di heard that your Highness is back.

737
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:50,980
He pretended to break the jade.

738
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:52,100
I took the jade.

739
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:52,860
Then...

740
00:34:53,180 --> 00:34:55,020
Then he resigned.

741
00:34:58,100 --> 00:34:59,020
Your Highness.

742
00:34:59,780 --> 00:35:00,620
Your Highness.

743
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:02,460
Your Highness.

744
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,100
Your Highness is here.

745
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:06,500
Your Highness is here to see you.

746
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,580
Your Highness.

747
00:35:07,580 --> 00:35:08,980
Your Highness is here.

748
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:12,780
Father.

749
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,460
Don't get up.

750
00:35:27,860 --> 00:35:31,660
Your Highness is broken.

751
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:32,780
Lie down.

752
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:37,820
Your Majesty wants me to

753
00:35:38,420 --> 00:35:40,100
be Your socialist aide.

754
00:35:40,100 --> 00:35:43,220
I was portrids如此 strong

755
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:46,340
That I cheated out of yourırd

756
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,140
I set my own path

757
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:54,180
While His Highness came back

758
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,260
My mom even felt

759
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,180
that I could just have enough

760
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,260
I didn't expect to be coisaion

761
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:02,980
And fell into it

762
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:04,660
His Highness

763
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,380
I wish that

764
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,180
如果 I could marry him

765
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,020
Your Highness.

766
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,420
You can't even speak clearly.

767
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:12,940
Rest.

768
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,860
Have a good rest for two days.

769
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:16,740
Your Highness.

770
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:18,140
My mother

771
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:20,380
didn't want to make you

772
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,660
and Miss Cui's life a reality.

773
00:36:23,540 --> 00:36:26,060
This is a person who is a fool.

774
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,420
I'm willing

775
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,420
to die for you.

776
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:33,980
You're young.

777
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,540
How can you be so serious?

778
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,420
I've seen so many people die in front of me.

779
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,940
But I can't save them.

780
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,100
Do you know how many people in the world

781
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:45,820
only hope that this life

782
00:36:45,820 --> 00:36:47,500
can live safely and safely?

783
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,660
And you, a person who can live well,

784
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:52,420
will beg to die.

785
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,540
Your Highness.

786
00:36:56,460 --> 00:36:57,340
Take good care of yourself.

787
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:00,460
Your Highness.

788
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,460
Your Highness.

789
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:04,460
Your Highness.

790
00:37:05,260 --> 00:37:06,180
Your Highness.

791
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,660
You 하루,

792
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,740
it's very cold.

793
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,860
But my Climate Test

794
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:13,700
is warm.

795
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:17,940
I'm sorry.

796
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:19,180
Your Highness.

797
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,540
They are all dead.

798
00:37:26,020 --> 00:37:26,820
Also,

799
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,300
they allowed theirURF

800
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:34,860
from me on to the Ellis.

801
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,420
They brick and mortar

802
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,740
The next few days,

803
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:40,940
I want to be the best daughter of the crown prince.

804
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,960
Chaozhong has been away for several days already.

805
00:37:49,460 --> 00:37:50,380
The emperor today

806
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:51,820
shall really be sending official

807
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:53,580
Cuiyi to

808
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:56,020
be the rebellious and Celtic heirpeng candidate.

809
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:58,600
The crown prince went after the emperor for more than a day,

810
00:37:58,940 --> 00:37:59,700
and just left the rest in harem.

811
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,060
But at that moment,

812
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:02,840
although shed her behavior

813
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:03,580
to her family and finallyㅋㅋㅋㅋ

814
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,900
changed the family,

815
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,780
there is only one Liu Chengfeng left.

816
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:08,180
He wants to kill General Cui.

817
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,780
But now,

818
00:38:10,300 --> 00:38:11,700
he can't fight with the enemy.

819
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,060
He can't fight.

820
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,500
This situation

821
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:17,060
is very old.

822
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,900
It's only Cui Yi and his brother.

823
00:38:20,620 --> 00:38:21,300
But father,

824
00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:23,980
the crown prince is still in the palace.

825
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,860
He insists on saying that General Cui is innocent.

826
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,500
Look at the weather.

827
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:34,100
I'm afraid it's going to rain.

828
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,220
This is the epic cousin of General Cui.

829
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:39,420
Father,

830
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:41,540
Your highness,

831
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,540
can I give you años When will Prince Yushan go to the palace?

832
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:45,140
Your highness is slowly agitated

833
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:48,020
towards imperial 77th concubine Cui in ancient times.

834
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:49,340
And your highness

835
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:51,220
is not very close with your crown prince.

836
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:52,460
Plus,

837
00:38:53,540 --> 00:38:54,340
I think

838
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:55,680
someone is behind

839
00:38:55,860 --> 00:38:57,480
taming your highness.

840
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:58,300
I'm afraid

841
00:38:58,860 --> 00:38:59,620
your highness

842
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,120
won't know best

843
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,580
Who knows the law and whether this will end?

844
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:49,180
Your Majesty.

845
00:39:49,940 --> 00:39:50,740
Your Majesty.

846
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,020
She's for almost half of the day

847
00:39:53,540 --> 00:39:54,100
to kneel downVWS.

848
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,900
is so гдеto Shame thing isisser

849
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,540
Don't care about her.

850
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:01,420
The minimapy monumental court knew of push me,

851
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:04,380
You must say the supra города locates a clear stoat.

852
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,800
Have you got more-

853
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,340
?

854
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,140
So he came to Natalia Pestidog animosity with Noh Zhili

855
00:40:15,140 --> 00:40:16,620
?

856
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:17,620
No no no

857
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,540
Why doesn't he call you

858
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:21,520
?

859
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:23,400
Why doesn't he call me

860
00:40:23,620 --> 00:40:25,560
?

861
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,540
It's my fault

862
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,500
he came to Natalia Pestidog

863
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,000
I want to know

864
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:32,340
who he is

865
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,840
Which Qing Crown Prince is it?

866
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,780
Great

867
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,940
I'm angry.

868
00:40:37,060 --> 00:40:39,340
Crown Prince was seriously injured.

869
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:40,860
He was injured for a long time.

870
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,660
He went out to help His Majesty get back to Cuiyi.

871
00:40:44,340 --> 00:40:45,380
He was so busy.

872
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,820
He was so rude.

873
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:48,540
He didn't have any merit.

874
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,060
He was also in trouble.

875
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,540
It's raining heavily.

876
00:40:53,220 --> 00:40:54,500
Let him change his clothes

877
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,180
and let the Crown Prince get up first.

878
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:00,460
Let him kneel.

879
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,340
Isn't he Gu Tuoying?

880
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,780
He must kneel before he gets up.

881
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,340
Your Majesty.

882
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:13,060
You only have one son.

883
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:28,100
Your Highness.

884
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,380
I asked you to get up.

885
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:31,100
I'll let you change your clothes.

886
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:33,340
Your Highness.

887
00:41:36,980 --> 00:41:37,980
Go tell His Majesty

888
00:41:38,380 --> 00:41:39,900
that I'm not going to let Cuiyi get up.

889
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:43,260
I won't let her be the Crown Princess.

890
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,420
I won't get up.

891
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:46,540
Your Highness.

892
00:41:46,540 --> 00:41:46,980
You...

893
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:48,780
You're making me feel uncomfortable.

894
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:50,260
Tell him my words.

895
00:41:51,700 --> 00:41:53,020
I've been feeling so lonely

896
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,980
since the day I was born.

897
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:58,060
I can't let the world down.

898
00:41:58,860 --> 00:42:00,260
I want you to believe me.

899
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,980
Whether that kill Cuiyi

900
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,380
or be reasonable.

901
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,300
Get out.

902
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:12,260
Your Highness.

903
00:43:00,260 --> 00:43:04,260
Father, I'm going to take medicine.

904
00:43:06,260 --> 00:43:07,260
In this kind of rainy day,

905
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,260
the pain in your body is the most painful.

906
00:43:12,260 --> 00:43:13,260
Why are you still standing outside?

907
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:15,260
Indeed,

908
00:43:16,260 --> 00:43:19,260
this body is hurt and hurt.

909
00:43:21,260 --> 00:43:25,260
This rain is really painful.

910
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,260
Father,

911
00:43:49,260 --> 00:43:50,260
Your Highness!

912
00:43:54,260 --> 00:43:56,260
Your Highness, please get up.

913
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:58,260
I beg you, please.

914
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,260
Why do you have to beg for mercy?

915
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:01,260
Why are you begging for mercy?

916
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:02,260
You're really important to me, Your Highness.

917
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,260
I beg you.

918
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:05,260
Get up.

919
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:07,260
Guest?

920
00:44:08,260 --> 00:44:11,260
It's important to lead the city to the court.

921
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:14,260
How dare you to be a person?

922
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:16,260
Cui Dazhang.

923
00:44:17,260 --> 00:44:20,260
Is General Cui Dazhang the one who saved His Majesty?

924
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:23,260
Is this called mercy?

925
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:26,260
How could His Majesty do such a foolish thing?

926
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:28,260
How could he do such a foolish thing?

927
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,260
How could he do such a foolish thing?

928
00:44:33,260 --> 00:44:35,260
How could he do such a foolish thing?

929
00:44:56,260 --> 00:45:00,260
I forgot the six years of fire

930
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:06,260
When memories are gone

931
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:13,260
If the light in your heart

932
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:20,260
Is that car, it's me who can't leave

933
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:26,260
If the thought is gone

934
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:33,260
I'm still thinking about the taste of the time

935
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:38,260
I'm sure all the warmth I've had

936
00:45:38,260 --> 00:45:43,260
I want to stay for you

937
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:49,260
If we can live happily ever after

938
00:45:50,260 --> 00:45:55,260
I want to live for you

939
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:01,260
I want to stay for you

940
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:08,260
Waiting for my order

941
00:46:10,260 --> 00:46:16,260
If we can live happily ever after

942
00:46:17,260 --> 00:46:23,260
I'll love you forever

943
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:28,260
I'll wait for you all my life

944
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:33,260
I'll love you forever

945
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:39,260
If I can live happily ever after

946
00:46:40,260 --> 00:46:46,260
I'll love you forever

947
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:51,260
I'll wait for your order

948
00:46:52,260 --> 00:46:59,260
Waiting for your order

949
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:11,260
The End
