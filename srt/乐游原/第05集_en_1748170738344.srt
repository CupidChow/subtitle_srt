1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
The dream is empty

2
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,160
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

3
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,440
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

4
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,960
The wind is blowing in the broken wind

5
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,960
The cold snow is cold and cold

6
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,640
The moon is singing

7
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:21,200
I will let you be by my side

8
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,720
I will let you be by my side

9
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,120
The sky is cold and the sky is small

10
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:28,320
I will accompany you to the middle of the world

11
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,840
The sky is cold and the sky is small

12
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,600
I will accompany you to the middle of the world

13
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,000
The sky is cold and the sky is small

14
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
I will accompany you to the middle of the world

15
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:14,080
I want to see you.

16
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:21,340
It muss be safe to eat cactus.

17
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,800
How can I do this?

18
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,800
Okay, okay, don't cry.

19
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:26,800
How can I eat this?

20
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,800
Come here, come here, don't cry.

21
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,800
This is the child who just got born.

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,800
How can this be a married couple?

23
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,800
Hurry and give birth to a few red dots.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,800
It's not just a baby today.

25
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,800
The baby just got out of the hospital.

26
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,800
He's taking care of the baby.

27
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:40,800
Hurry up, come here, go get the doctor.

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,800
Don't cry.

29
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,800
Okay, okay.

30
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:45,800
Yes, I'm sorry.

31
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:46,800
Don't cry.

32
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,800
It's okay, don't cry.

33
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,800
Don't cry.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
You're too excited.

35
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:50,800
Don't cry.

36
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:55,800
Don't cry.

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,800
Don't cry.

38
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,800
Here comes the woman.

39
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,800
Don't cry.

40
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:02,800
Come and take a look.

41
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,800
It's really hot.

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:25,800
You're a big fool.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:27,800
How dare you

44
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
to take my son

45
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,800
while he's been in the palace for many years.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,800
You even left a note

47
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:34,800
to exchange with me for the tiger's clothing.

48
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:38,800
Please calm down,

49
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,800
the person who comes will handle it.

50
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,800
Changzhi,

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,800
what do you think

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,800
will be the person

53
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:49,800
who dares to take the throne?

54
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:51,800
What do you think

55
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:52,800
will be the person

56
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,800
who dares to take the throne?

57
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,800
The King of Zhenxi

58
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,800
just came from Wanzhou.

59
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:01,800
He's just too stubborn.

60
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,800
The son of the Cui family

61
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:04,800
of the Cui family

62
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
is leading the army to the left.

63
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,800
At this moment,

64
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,800
these two families

65
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,800
are still very worried about our country.

66
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:15,800
The King of Zhenxi

67
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:16,800
is a coward.

68
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,800
He's not a coward.

69
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,800
It's just

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:22,800
that Cui

71
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
is a coward.

72
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Now the other party

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
has taken away the little wolf king

74
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,800
and is making a loud noise.

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:31,800
He asked us to put the tiger's clothing

76
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,800
into the woods outside the city.

77
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:34,800
If not,

78
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,800
they will be against the little wolf king.

79
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:44,800
Send the tiger's clothing

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
to them.

81
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:49,800
Yes.

82
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:52,800
Yes.

83
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,800
You said that when we lived in Hanhao,

84
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
you were a pregnant woman.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,800
Otherwise,

86
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:24,800
a poor and crying baby

87
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
would be

88
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
suspicious.

89
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,800
No.

90
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,800
It should be that

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,800
you can't walk on the mountain road.

92
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:44,800
I told you to pretend to be pregnant.

93
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:46,800
Do you think

94
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,800
I'm very sharp-headed?

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,800
You're very sharp-headed.

96
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,800
Your Highness the Royal Descendant

97
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:51,800
is really a good man.

98
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,800
He's more sharp-headed than you.

99
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,800
Why are you crying again?

100
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,800
Your Highness the Royal Descendant,

101
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:02,800
you're going to change your clothes again?

102
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,800
Why are you crying again?

103
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Because you're a sharp-headed man.

104
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,800
I'm really afraid of you.

105
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:16,800
Come on, don't cry.

106
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:19,800
Don't cry.

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
Why are you crying so much?

108
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,800
Master.

109
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:28,800
How is it?

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,800
Master.

111
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:30,800
I ordered people to

112
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:31,800
guard the Yan family.

113
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,800
It's getting dark.

114
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,800
But no one is coming to get the tiger's clothing.

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,800
No one?

116
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,800
Yes.

117
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,800
I'm worried about you.

118
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:40,800
I'll come back to my life first.

119
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:42,800
Master.

120
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,800
If they can't get the tiger's clothing,

121
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,800
will they be disrespected by the Wolf King?

122
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:08,800
You have to grow up well.

123
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
That way, you won't ruin our Royal Descendant

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
and make so many wrongs for you.

125
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,800
Let's go.

126
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:18,800
Put the fire away.

127
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Be careful later.

128
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Don't burn this house.

129
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I know.

130
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:24,800
Let's go.

131
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,800
The water is gone.

132
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,800
The water is gone.

133
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
The water is gone.

134
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:32,800
The water is gone.

135
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:33,800
The water is gone.

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,800
The water is gone.

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,800
It's broken.

138
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,800
I'm afraid the enemy knows that the tiger's clothing is fake.

139
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:41,800
The Wolf King really has the tiger's clothing.

140
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:43,800
Send people to the south yard.

141
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,800
Seism.

142
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:45,800
Plan to shield the乐 settle continent.

143
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:16,120
I've already found out where the Tiger Manor is.

144
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,800
But I don't know how many slaves and traps

145
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,320
are left in the yard.

146
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,720
I can't take it.

147
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,200
I can't. I'll go find a way.

148
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,080
Let's go.

149
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,960
Master! Master!

150
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,760
I didn't expect that someone would let me go on purpose.

151
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:34,880
I didn't expect that someone would send the Wolf Lord back to the house.

152
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:38,920
Luckily, I was killed.

153
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,040
I was able to escape.

154
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,080
I was able to escape.

155
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,200
I was able to escape.

156
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:44,160
Luckily, I was able to escape.

157
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,000
The Wolf Lord is still a good man.

158
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:50,400
It's just that the two houses are in a hurry.

159
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,120
They're about to leave the mountain.

160
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,440
They just want to take the fire

161
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,840
and get rid of the tiger's skin.

162
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:03,800
If they really want to take the tiger's skin,

163
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:04,960
it's good.

164
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:08,160
The South Courtyard of the Tiger Manor is in a hurry.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,000
There are not 1,800 people.

166
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,440
No one can get in.

167
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:24,920
Although I know that the tiger's skin is still there,

168
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,520
it's hard to get rid of the skin

169
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,640
because of such a deep-seated body.

170
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,920
Since we can't secretly steal it,

171
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,440
let's make a decision.

172
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,880
How about

173
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,040
using me as the envoy of the West Army

174
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,960
to make a decision with Han Li?

175
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,000
What do you think?

176
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:48,320
No.

177
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,320
The West Army has just retreated from Wanzhou.

178
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,680
Han Li won't be suspicious of us.

179
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:05,440
Why don't we

180
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,320
make a decision with the Cui family

181
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:09,280
to go to Wanzhou?

182
00:10:09,560 --> 00:10:10,760
Han Li said

183
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,280
that if we want to borrow the sword,

184
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,640
we need to find a good place.

185
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,200
Han Li is greedy.

186
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:18,360
Cui family is in a hurry.

187
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,680
He will agree.

188
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:23,000
Royal Descendant, you're so sincere.

189
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,960
As long as Han Li sent people to take the tiger's skin

190
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,600
and the sword,

191
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,680
by that time,

192
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,720
we can get the tiger's skin

193
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,160
if we kill aunt or the fake.

194
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,800
If we succeed,

195
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,320
then the West Army and Cui family

196
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,240
will take a week.

197
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,960
I want to get sick.

198
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,200
Why don't we make a decision?

199
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,520
Who will catch Han Li first?

200
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:42,920
Or kill Han Li first?

201
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,640
Who will go back to Wanzhou?

202
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
Who will go back to Wanzhou

203
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,280
with the tiger's skin?

204
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,920
If I catch Han Li,

205
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,920
who will go back to Wanzhou?

206
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,240
The Cui family will be yours.

207
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,040
The West Army will have no second chance.

208
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,360
It's a deal.

209
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,200
Okay.

210
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:02,040
If the Cui family and the West Army

211
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:03,200
are all in the Cui family,

212
00:11:03,640 --> 00:11:05,760
the Cui family will be the East and North.

213
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,960
If the Cui family and the West Army

214
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,120
are all in the Cui family,

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:09,400
and the Cui family and the West Army

216
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,600
are all in the Cui family,

217
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:11,520
then the West Army will be the West.

218
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:12,920
It's a deal.

219
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,320
It's a deal.

220
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:19,240
Sir,

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,720
Chen Xingchuan is back.

222
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,000
He finally found the signal

223
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
of He Xiaowei

224
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,880
in the city of Banzhou.

225
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:25,800
Okay.

226
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,040
Good.

227
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:28,120
Taozi,

228
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,200
go to Banzhou and meet Chen Xingchuan

229
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:32,520
and meet Xiaowei together.

230
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,480
Banzhou

231
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,000
is Han Li's real brother.

232
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,920
He is a good man.

233
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,320
If I bring the army here,

234
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,120
I'm afraid he will be against Xiaowei.

235
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,160
Lin.

236
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,240
Brother,

237
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:53,640
why are you here?

238
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:55,680
Lin,

239
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:57,720
you are out of the country for months.

240
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:58,800
How can you

241
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,920
not be around?

242
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:00,800
Well,

243
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:03,080
uncle sent me to the West.

244
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:04,760
I thought

245
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:06,520
the West is so close to you.

246
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:07,680
I just believe

247
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,800
that I can lead my family

248
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,760
to you.

249
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,520
You and my brother

250
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,400
are close friends.

251
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,320
It's good that uncle knows

252
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:15,920
that his nephew

253
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,760
can also be a good man.

254
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:19,840
Brother,

255
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,880
you are against the army's order.

256
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,280
Lin, don't worry.

257
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,400
I've sent someone

258
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,840
to report to uncle on behalf of the Cui family.

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:31,600
I believe

260
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:32,920
uncle will definitely agree.

261
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,120
And think about it.

262
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:35,320
If I go back alone

263
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,320
with the horse,

264
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,240
what if

265
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,920
there is a flash on the way?

266
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
If the storm and the flood

267
00:12:45,560 --> 00:12:46,840
are over,

268
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,280
the army will be back here.

269
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
I wonder what you have in mind.

270
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,960
Brother,

271
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,080
since you are against the army's order,

272
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,280
you should make a deal with your own horse.

273
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:04,440
You can't talk about anything in the army.

274
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,080
Otherwise,

275
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:08,960
you will be punished

276
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,840
by the commander.

277
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,520
This sick man

278
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,440
dares to talk to me so rudely.

279
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,120
Cui Lin

280
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,680
is just a good woman.

281
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:26,600
If I were your son,

282
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,240
I would have

283
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,440
been the commander of the Cui family.

284
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,960
I am angry.

285
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,920
Cui Lin is sick and weak.

286
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,360
He has been taking medicine for a long time.

287
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,000
He is not good at life.

288
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,400
When the general is dead,

289
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,560
the Cui family

290
00:13:40,760 --> 00:13:41,960
will still be yours.

291
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,160
I have been a little man for so many years.

292
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,920
I can't wait

293
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,400
for the situation to change.

294
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:01,000
Is it because

295
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,720
of me

296
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,000
that your son

297
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,920
follow Cui Lin

298
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:09,560
to avoid it?

299
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:10,680
Only if she

300
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:11,440
follows Cui Lin

301
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,440
and He XiaMei

302
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,440
will beat her.

303
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,160
Do you two

304
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:27,520
mean that

305
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,280
you stand together

306
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,120
Jianzhou?

307
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:32,600
Yes.

308
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,400
Bring out the Governing Justifics of the Palace.

309
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,540
Alright.

310
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:40,120
Alright.

311
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:41,880
But...

312
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,880
You having so much trouble

313
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,240
when you brought my dumped валot installed in you

314
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,800
would be wronged

315
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:53,160
if I reached the Incremental mapa .

316
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:55,240
So, we foretold

317
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,880
if you came toкeいや the Incrementalesa CLP.

318
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,160
Okay.

319
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:02,680
The two states of Bingtian are in a hurry.

320
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:04,680
We, the Cui family,

321
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,280
are in Pingliang,

322
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
and we are selling the goods to the foreign trade.

323
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,280
As long as the harem is in the cloud,

324
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,880
we will not

325
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,880
collect the water of the two states of Bingtian.

326
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
It's just a tax.

327
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,080
I think

328
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:19,080
the harem will naturally understand

329
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:20,080
the benefits of it.

330
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,280
You two have come a long way.

331
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:27,880
It's late today.

332
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,880
Why don't you stay in my house

333
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,680
and have a cup of wine

334
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:32,880
and rest?

335
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,880
The young master is in the left room.

336
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,480
We can't stay here long.

337
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:37,880
We have to go back as soon as possible

338
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
and ask for your help.

339
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,480
Okay.

340
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,080
You two, sit down.

341
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:55,280
Wait for me to discuss.

342
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,880
Okay.

343
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:26,880
What are you doing?

344
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:28,480
Ergou,

345
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:30,880
why are you so weird in the Western Army?

346
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:32,480
It's almost dark.

347
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,080
Everyone is waiting for the security guard.

348
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:37,080
Brother Chang'er said

349
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:38,880
we don't want you to come here.

350
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,480
Now,

351
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,880
we all listen to Brother Chang'er.

352
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,880
But what are we doing here?

353
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
You said one of the officials

354
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,080
is the He Xiaowei of the Cui family.

355
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,280
That means,

356
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,880
it's the Cui's side

357
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:04,680
that the famous Jin Nang is in.

358
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,880
I have a Liang Guan

359
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,080
who is always with the Cui family.

360
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,280
I heard that

361
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,880
the Cui family sent the Shi people here

362
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,880
so I asked him to check it secretly

363
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:17,080
to confirm

364
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:21,480
that it's the Jin Nang.

365
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,680
No wonder.

366
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,880
I was wondering

367
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:28,480
why there is a woman

368
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:31,880
sent by the Cui family.

369
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,080
So,

370
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:38,280
it's the famous Jin Nang.

371
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,680
I also heard that

372
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,080
the woman

373
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,480
is the new man of the Cui family

374
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:47,880
who always makes plans for her.

375
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,080
Another Shi

376
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,680
is so angry.

377
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:55,880
I am so angry

378
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,680
at this age.

379
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,880
I am also worried.

380
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,080
How is Han Gong doing?

381
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:20,280
The Cui family is here

382
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:23,680
and I am so worried.

383
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,080
Since Han Gong has stolen your identity,

384
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:37,480
let's take it as a gift.

385
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,080
Han Gong has been using the sword for two weeks.

386
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,080
It's really a great honor.

387
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,880
No matter what,

388
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,080
the Cui family will come here in person.

389
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,480
We must discuss the solution.

390
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:51,680
We will discuss it.

391
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:54,480
Thank you, Han Gong.

392
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,080
Guards.

393
00:18:57,680 --> 00:18:58,080
Yes.

394
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
Hurry up and take the banquet.

395
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:02,480
I will drink three cups with Mr. Cui.

396
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,080
The first time I hit the sword,

397
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:13,880
it's so dangerous.

398
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,280
It's worse than the first time.

399
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,280
I have been hit by the sword many times.

400
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:15,880
Yes.

401
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,680
It's the first time.

402
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:18,880
It's fun to be a soldier.

403
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
Exactly.

404
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,080
Zhen Xi.

405
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:27,680
Zhen Xi.

406
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,080
I am back.

407
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:35,680
Brothers.

408
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,280
Brothers.

409
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:41,080
Give me a chance to go back to Wanzhou.

410
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:43,080
Go back to Wanzhou.

411
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:43,680
Go.

412

Two till two.

417
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:13,880
三.

418
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:14,980
Three.

419
00:20:14,980 --> 00:20:15,680
Two.

420
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,680
One.

421
00:20:16,680 --> 00:20:17,720
It's right.

422
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:23,640
What are you doing?

423
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,160
What are you doing?

424
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,340
I'm doing little for the sake of you.

425
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,080
Zichenhao's

426
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,800
being the charge detective has

427
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
to go to Han City

428
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,100
and claim the position of Vice-Chivepian pellet for real.

429
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,100
But you could still let him do what he wants

430
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:52,020
Mr. Cui, you are so touching.

431
00:21:12,060 --> 00:21:14,260
Mr. Cui, please sit.

432
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:17,740
There's something strange

433
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:21,220
after class.

434
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:23,580
Please go back now.

435
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:41,480

00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,940
sent here real treasure.

437
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:48,620
We've made it out of the smallest detail.

438
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,220
It looks terrible!

439
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,360
I never knew that apart from the marvelous事情,

440
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,660
Han

441
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:57,080
you're the friend with your steps.

442
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,260
You've attended me so seriously.

443
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:01,700
I came here because of my own feelings.

444
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:07,620
It's all due to your specialbstur오� Castle and dream.

445
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:08,980
and Han Gong passed away.

446
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,660
I wonder if there's a operation

447
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:13,660
of Duoduo

448
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:14,900
to kill him.

449
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,540
Of course there is.

450
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,940
Actually, Duoduo invited me here.

451
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,740
First,

452
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,060
he knew that I and Han Gong

453
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:23,060
were old friends.

454
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,700
He was just about to die.

455
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:26,820
Second,

456
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,660
Duoduo was worried

457
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,740
and was heartless at the battlefield.

458
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:33,700
He was worried about Han Gong's safety.

459
00:22:35,020 --> 00:22:36,100
That's why he ordered me

460
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,460
to bring the twelve of them

461
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:38,780
to Court of Judicial Review.

462
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,980
Do you know why

463
00:22:42,380 --> 00:22:43,900
you didn't have to

464
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,260
guard the Han Gong

465
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,620
day and night?

466
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,740
And you had to guard

467
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:49,540
the PRC特首?

468
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,140
Duoduo is so noticeably

469
00:22:54,700 --> 00:22:56,500
summoning this taskhack?

470
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,860
Besides,

471
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:59,220
I'm very grateful to you

472
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,580
for not having replied to my messages.

473
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,100
Except for

474
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,860
thatologists and launchers

475
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:05,060
who had the share of

476
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,500
Zhang Xi's soldiers

477
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,980
thank you for верing in his kindness.

478
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:14,060
The mixer

479
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:18,060
wants to резure anyowa

480
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,140
from the louder forces.

481
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:19,740
Or

482
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,780
wouldn't send

483
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,740
a man with 12 blazes

484
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:24,900
to protect the 합니다It is impossible

485
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:28,100
to charity a good helping figure.

486
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:34,580
The apple is export from this region

487
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,700
I killed the whole family of Li clan

488
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:41,460
and sent me a so-called prison.

489
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:44,020
At that time,

490
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,980
I just wanted to take care of her.

491
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,700
I didn't expect

492
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:50,740
to be a young man.

493
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:51,780
My Lord,

494
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,300
the Cui family is still in the Yanling Palace.

495
00:23:55,220 --> 00:23:56,260
This matter

496
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:00,300
can't be disobeyed by Sun Jing.

497
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,980
The Cui family

498
00:24:03,860 --> 00:24:06,060
can use it well.

499
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:10,300
Cui Yi has only one son.

500
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,900
I didn't expect

501
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:15,180
to be sent to the door.

502
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:18,140
Don't blame me

503
00:24:18,540 --> 00:24:19,780
for being so courteous.

504
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,140
My Lord.

505
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:43,540
My Lord,

506
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,060
you're drunk.

507
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:46,300
I'm not.

508
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:50,220
I'm not sober.

509
00:24:53,220 --> 00:24:53,820
My Lord,

510
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,780
I'll help you go back and rest.

511
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:02,300
My Lord, you're drunk.

512
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:04,060
I'll go to the room and rest.

513
00:25:21,060 --> 00:25:21,860
Wait.

514
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:25,300
My Lord,

515
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,180
you're here to take care of her.

516
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:30,100
Why are you so angry?

517
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,460
Why are you leaving?

518
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,340
You're too generous

519
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,380
to be sent to the door.

520
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:39,380
If I can't keep you here,

521
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:40,980
I can't give you a job.

522
00:25:41,500 --> 00:25:43,100
I just need to kill this monk

523
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:45,100
and tell the Lord.

524
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:50,980
Okay.

525
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,340
I can stay.

526
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,900
But you have to let him go.

527
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,700
Don't worry, my Lord.

528
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,540
A noble man like you

529
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:02,060
will stay in our Binhzhou.

530
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,500
I'm afraid the Lord of Cui will not rest assured.

531
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,860
Of course, you should let this monk

532
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:11,020
go back and tell him

533
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,540
to stay away from the misunderstanding.

534
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:15,900
My Lord, leave now.

535
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,100
Don't leave here without a word.

536
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:29,700
Wu wy.

537
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,260
Great.

538
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:36,220
Lord Cui, you're so loving and joyful.

539
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:53,860
You love

540
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Jingang is safe and sound.

541
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:59,060
It's not easy to get a chance to rebel.

542
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,380
The prison is called prison.

543
00:27:01,380 --> 00:27:02,580
It's so easy to talk about it.

544
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:06,580
What?

545
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,700
This Biandi Jinxiu

546
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:10,860
is not Qi Luoxiang?

547
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,620
Wait.

548
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:16,980
Bring more hot water.

549
00:27:17,500 --> 00:27:19,500
We are close to each other.

550
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,500
I want to serve you.

551
00:27:24,660 --> 00:27:25,460
Let's have a look.

552
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,660
Why don't we pray for them

553
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,660
who were killed wetly and burned to death?

554
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,780
With this,

555
00:27:31,340 --> 00:27:32,060
I can't help but find

556
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,100
the engine.

557
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,060
That's bean seed powder?

558
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:37,300
What else?

559
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:38,140
Okay.

560
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:43,500
I will

561
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,740
prepare some rest проектions

562
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:47,900
for our master's recent injury.

563
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,220
If he works in our home,

564
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:50,580
too bad for

565
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,460
you,

566
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,660
we'll have to yourselves.

567
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
I'm going to make a fire.

568
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
I'm going to make a fire.

569
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
I'm going to make a fire.

570
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860

I'm going to make a fire.

576
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
I'm going to make a fire.

Sir, we are in the prison.

587
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:17,860

Myулv training and training are not in Court in the Gala of Love

00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,640
No.127

590
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,000
I'mأm sure of it when I was alive

591
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:32,800
Do not panic

592
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,560
you know

593
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:38,240
what Edison frequency will make

594
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:45,760
It's a significant form of

595
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:49,520
It is probably the first time

596
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,860
Use water.

597
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,300
Dump water down.

598
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:54,060
That's great.

599
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,180
Then, why don't we all oder together?

600
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:50,360
Wait.

601
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:54,960
Wait.

602
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,000
Okay, we can talk now.

603
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,480
Why are you laughing?

604
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:10,240
I'm laughing.

605
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,480
It's our first time meeting.

606
00:31:13,320 --> 00:31:14,880
It seems like it's the same as now.

607
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,360
Yeah.

608
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:18,480
You don't know how long you've been there.

609
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,400
You should talk to me first.

610
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:21,480
Nonsense.

611
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Why did you hit me

612
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:23,320
without my help?

613
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,640
What help?

614
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,760
That bastard.

615
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,320
I would have thrown it away.

616
00:31:33,800 --> 00:31:34,400
What?

617
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,160
Is it

618
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:39,720
that Royal Descendant wants to do something

619
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,640
at this moment?

620
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,400
You're right.

621
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:52,680
What's your plan?

622
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,960
What plan?

623
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,040
Of course,

624
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,640
I'll think of a way to return to the Cui Xia Army

625
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,760
and then I'll pay you back.

626
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:05,200
Really?

627
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,720
After you return to the Cui Xia Army,

628
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,960
will you pay me back?

629
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,040
What are you doing? What are you looking at?

630
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,940
Are the Huang Cl Jennets

631
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,400
played by Royal Descendant?

632
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,520
Why won't he save you?

633
00:32:30,760 --> 00:32:31,720
You speak so well.

634
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:34,240
I like it so much.

635
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:37,200
I like it so much.

636
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:41,880
Grandpa Wang.

637
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,080
I didn't expect about that

638
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,880
He's someone from the west ofuchs.

639
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:50,840
Yes.

640
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,200
From a picture無LC's,

641
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,680
he can put out this kind of ceremony.

642
00:32:55,160 --> 00:32:57,200
I've ordered to keep an eye on him.

643
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
But that peaceful woman

644
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,640
always looks like a blinking woman.

645
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,040
She does his dirty moves

646
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,160
pTaepoh,

647
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:04,240
and uses the hind formidable

648
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,440
to block the place

649
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,240
where theуж the door American yoies put it.

650
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,880
He'll lead us

651
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,400
to do nothing of the useful.

652
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,400
No.

653
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,840
Drives himself upwards

654
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,960
without expecting.

655
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:19,760
with Song Tibetan musicietry.

656
00:33:20,520 --> 00:33:21,120
It is charges as if

657
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:22,840
he needed to show this to the world.

658
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,640
So게只有这样单仔

659
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:27,720
thanks to thiseday!

660
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,480
Interesting.

661
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,800
Interesting!

662
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,200
What are you doing?

663
00:33:50,800 --> 00:33:52,000
What are you doing?

664
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:54,680
I want to ask you something.

665
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:57,040
Why?

666
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,040
You haven't told me your name.

667
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,840
Didn't you know I'm a good drinker?

668
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,960
What do you usually call your husband?

669
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:12,000
What are you doing?

670
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:13,720
Of course, I'm afraid

671
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:15,200
I'll be in front of Han Li.

672
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,360
I can't call you a suitable woman.

673
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:18,920
If you don't want to say it,

674
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,240
I'll just give you one.

675
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,320
What good name can you give me?

676
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:26,960
With your virtue,

677
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,160
you must give me

678
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,280
a name like A-Mao A-Gou.

679
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:35,280
Don't say that.

680
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,000
You're like A-Mao.

681
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:42,600
You call me A-Jing.

682
00:34:44,120 --> 00:34:45,960
You want to take my name again to fool me?

683
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:47,760
I don't know.

684
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,240
Why don't I help you choose one?

685
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:52,240
A-Dao.

686
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,080
Or A-Zhen.

687
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:02,880
Why is it A-Dao?

688
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:04,160
Or A-Zhen?

689
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:05,480
I can guess it myself.

690
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,160
A-Dao?

691
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:10,120
A-Zhen?

692
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:16,000
Are you kidding me?

693
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,560
A-Dao is a pregnant woman.

694
00:35:18,760 --> 00:35:21,440
She's wearing a robe and a pillow in her belly.

695
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:22,560
How dare I?

696
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:25,680
I know all the names of my relatives.

697
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,440
I just don't want to know your name.

698
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:30,240
I'm worried that Han Li will kill me.

699
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,040
If I'm killed,

700
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,000
I won't know your name.

701
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,000
It's a pity.

702
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:42,960
So fierce.

703
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,000
My name is A-Ying.

704
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,920
It's my mother's name.

705
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:56,760
A-Ying.

706
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,240
A-Ying.

707
00:36:07,640 --> 00:36:08,960
Your name is so nice.

708
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:17,680
What do you do?

709
00:36:33,880 --> 00:36:34,480
Dad.

710
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:44,520
Wait a minute.

711
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,080
Please wait a moment.

712
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,080
Please wait a moment.

713
00:36:48,080 --> 00:36:48,880
Here's more.

714
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,680
Here.

715
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:55,800
Brother!

716
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:56,800
Look!

717
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Please take it.

718
00:36:58,520 --> 00:36:59,080
Brothers!

719
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,760
New weapon!

720
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,320
How is it?

721
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:01,240
Are you all right?

722
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,000
I'm fine.

723
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:02,840
Give it to him.

724
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:06,720
General Pei.

725
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:07,760
I have something to ask you.

726
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,320
Brother!

727
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,520
Can you please teach me?

728
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,520
You're so polite.

729
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,120
Say it.

730
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,400
Why are you so muddleheaded?

731
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,160
The West Army retreated from Wanzhou.

732
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,680
Why are you so muddleheaded?

733
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,360
I didn't follow General Pei

734
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,000
and retreated from Wanzhou with you.

735
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:22,320
This is

736
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,560
what Shi Qi Lang and I discussed.

737
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,640
If the enemy is a big man,

738
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,640
we can't kill Wanzhou.

739
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:30,120
Only the sheep's clothing retreats.

740
00:37:30,280 --> 00:37:32,240
Then we bury the sheep's clothing in Wanzhou.

741
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,800
Then we poison the sheep's clothing

742
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,320
in their provisions and silver water.

743
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,600
Then we spread the news

744
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,880
that the Dongyao Army is in a serious condition.

745
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:40,680
Finally, we take Wanzhou back

746
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,920
in Liying River.

747
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,920
So it's like this.

748
00:37:44,840 --> 00:37:46,120
It's not a war.

749
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:46,760
It makes sense.

750
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,520
Right, Chang'er?

751
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:49,080
Let's go.

752
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:49,680
Let's go in.

753
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,480
Okay.

754
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:51,920
Let's go.

755
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,480
Princess Yun,

756
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,700
General Pei's message has been Un errands.

757
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:36,620
He tells us it means read the news that

758
00:38:36,620 --> 00:38:37,700
How can I off her to Daddy?

759
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,180
Son of a bitch!

760
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,460
Help him his choice!

761
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:54,620
問題

762
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:00,580
today

763
00:39:01,540 --> 00:39:02,980
you can forget about how to call Lee

764
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,780
Consort Xiao

765
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,460
I'm worried about you.

766
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:08,940
Don't worry.

767
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,740
I'm just telling you

768
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:14,020
that I've thought of a way

769
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:15,980
to get you out of the palace

770
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:18,340
in a few days.

771
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,420
Your Highness, please don't be so hard on me.

772
00:39:22,780 --> 00:39:23,620
Get up.

773
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,100
Your father is pregnant

774
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,020
with the royal blood of the Crown Prince.

775
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:30,620
I'm going to think of a way

776
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,660
to keep you safe.

777
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:33,980
Your Highness,

778
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:35,300
you can't stay here for long.

779
00:39:37,620 --> 00:39:38,380
I'm leaving.

780
00:39:39,060 --> 00:39:39,940
Do you know

781
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,660
what you're looking for?

782
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:43,300
Yes.

783
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:56,140
Your Highness.

784
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:56,620
Your Highness.

785
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,500
Tao Zi is back.

786
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,620
Your Highness.

787
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
But there's news from Xiao Wei.

788
00:40:02,220 --> 00:40:02,620
Yes.

789
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,260
Chen Xing and I

790
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:04,020
found out the number of Xiao Wei's

791
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:04,940
first-ever account.

792
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,900
He entered Hanli's manor.

793
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,700
Hanli's manor?

794
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
Xiao Wei entered Hanli's manor

795
00:40:08,580 --> 00:40:09,420
must be a dream.

796
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:10,900
I've tried to enter one of them.

797
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,380
But I'm afraid

798
00:40:12,380 --> 00:40:13,260
I'll be kicked out

799
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:14,060
if I don't take the risk.

800
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,420
I'll report to the county

801
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:17,620
and wait for the news.

802
00:40:17,980 --> 00:40:18,900
In addition,

803
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,180
the time that Sun Jing came

804
00:40:20,180 --> 00:40:20,900
was also in the manor.

805
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,940
It's said that he was sent to Hanli's manor

806
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,260
with two big things.

807
00:40:24,580 --> 00:40:25,740
And 12 gold-fist guards.

808
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,420
Hanli is a cunning man.

809
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:31,540
He always tries to keep the seal.

810
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,060
He doesn't offend everyone.

811
00:40:35,980 --> 00:40:36,620
Tao Zi.

812
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,700
Take this letter and go to the city.

813
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,380
Give it to Chen Xing.

814
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:41,380
Let Chen Xing

815
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,860
use the name of the Cui's army

816
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,380
to see Hanli.

817
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:45,300
Remember.

818
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,740
You must see the execution.

819
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:47,900
It's better

820
00:40:48,460 --> 00:40:49,300
to use the letter

821
00:40:49,300 --> 00:40:50,660
sent by Sun Jing.

822
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,020
If Hanli

823
00:40:52,380 --> 00:40:53,580
dares to take the seal,

824
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:55,500
then ask him

825
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,020
if he agrees

826
00:40:57,460 --> 00:40:58,540
to take the seal or not.

827
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:07,980
A New Dishes

828
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,460
It's the newlygan един

829
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,740
to color her

830
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:24,100
to steal from the owner.

831
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:35,240
I designed the flower

832
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:37,520
You said when I rescued Qin then

833
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:39,320
you let her go.

834
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,320
But why didn't you take it seriously?

835
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:42,840
This

836
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,480
you shouldn't blame our main master.

837
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,440
Our master said

838
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:49,960
we were treated unfairly

839
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:52,000
works like the servants in the manor of the shEN JACK.

840
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,200
They are those怕res.

841
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,080
Control yourself.

842
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,360
Inodute theだけ atravess.

843
00:41:58,600 --> 00:42:00,920
You are close to Mr. He's daughter.

844
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,520
You're nice and kind.

845
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:03,920
If she were

846
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:09,280
Naturally

847
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:14,560
You and Chen Huishu can speak

848
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,360
Please

849
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,080
I'm not going to move.

850
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:39,880
You're not going to move?

851
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,080
You're quite a good boy.

852
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,080
You're trapped here anyway.

853
00:42:47,080 --> 00:42:48,400
You're free to do what you want.

854
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:50,360
How about a game with me?

855
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,200
Okay.

856
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:54,480
It's fun to have a rabbit.

857
00:42:54,760 --> 00:42:55,720
A rabbit?

858
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:57,760
How about this?

859
00:42:58,440 --> 00:42:59,480
If I win,

860
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:01,120
you'll give me the hairpin on your head

861
00:43:01,360 --> 00:43:02,480
and take it as my bracelet.

862
00:43:02,920 --> 00:43:04,240
What if you lose?

863
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:04,840
If you lose,

864
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:06,240
you'll give me half of the hairpin.

865
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,240
Who said I'd give you hairpin?
