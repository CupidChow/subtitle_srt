1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,100
the place where the black paper rose

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:14,400
must be the dream

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:20,460
with your skinier face

4
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:23,220
this floating fly

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,220
I'm chasing after waves

6
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:30,220
My night passes by

7
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:33,220
And the night is over

8
00:00:33,220 --> 00:00:37,220
I want to go

9
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:40,220
The end of the dark

10
00:00:40,220 --> 00:00:43,220
Is the long and long

11
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:46,220
When we meet, we are separated

12
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:49,220
When we meet, we are far away

13
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:53,220
I will never forget

14
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:57,220
The sound of the sword and the light

15
00:00:57,220 --> 00:01:00,220
The sky that has broken through the half of the world

16
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:03,220
How many dreams

17
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:07,220
The wind blows in the wind

18
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,220
See the sky and the sea

19
00:01:12,220 --> 00:01:15,220
The dragon's face is full of the moon

20
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:17,220
The cold snow is cold and cold

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:19,220
I will sing for you

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,220
I will let you be by my side

23
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,220
I will not let you go

24
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:27,220
Even if the sky is full of the moon

25
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:29,220
I will be with you in the middle of the world

26
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,220
See the shadow of the broken sword

27
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:38,220
The red dust will not be regret

28
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,220
The End

29
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:52,220
The End

30
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,220
The End

31
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,220
Xiao Wei

32
00:02:00,220 --> 00:02:01,220
How is it?

33
00:02:01,220 --> 00:02:03,220
The first combat of the military service in Bingzhou

34
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,220
Some of the enemy troops have gone to the fort

35
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,220
The rain is heavy

36
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,220
The wood is in the green corner of the green field

37
00:02:07,220 --> 00:02:09,220
The cold grass is hard to catch

38
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,220
Is Qin Zhong Hanli?

39
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,220
Hanli's army is not right

40
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,220
He ran away under the guard of the dead

41
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:15,220
But the subordinates have searched everywhere

42
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:16,220
The city is closed

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:18,220
He must have not escaped from the city

44
00:02:18,220 --> 00:02:19,220
Listen

45
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:22,220
You must take Hanli before the war

46
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:23,220
Yes

47
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,220
Come here

48
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,220
Come here

49
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,220
Mr. Li

50
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,220
Mr. Li

51
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,220
I don't know why Mr. Li is in a coma

52
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,220
Mr. Li

53
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,220
The enemy is coming

54
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:59,220
Shi Qi Lang

55
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,220
I really brought a lot of people here this time

56
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,220
Where is Hanli?

57
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,220
Did you find it?

58
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:05,220
I have an appointment with Cui Jiang

59
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,220
Who caught Hanli first

60
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:07,220
and went back to Bingzhou

61
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:09,220
The two armies went to the war

62
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:10,220
Hanli ran away

63
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,220
But the old man has gone after him

64
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,220
Let's go to the old fox

65
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,220
Mr. Li

66
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,220
I'm sorry

67
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:19,220
I'm sorry

68
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm sorry

69
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:21,220
I'm sorry

70
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:22,220
I'm sorry

71
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,220
Xiaowei

72
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,220
There is no Hanli in the car

73
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,220
You are so cunning

74
00:03:42,220 --> 00:03:43,220
Qiu Cui

75
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,220
It's okay

76
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:47,220
Isn't there a guard in the building?

77
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,220
No one can enter

78
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:52,220
Miss

79
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:55,220
I heard that the broken army will be in a tight spot

80
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:57,220
No one can stop them

81
00:03:58,220 --> 00:03:59,220
If they can stop them

82
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:01,220
Then there is nothing to worry about

83
00:04:01,220 --> 00:04:03,220
If they can't stop them

84
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,220
What's the point of being afraid of them?

85
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:08,220
It's all because of you, Miss

86
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:09,220
You are so naughty

87
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:11,220
You have to be self-confident

88
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,220
to go to Bingzhou

89
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:14,220
If it's not because of you

90
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,220
Miss San

91
00:04:15,220 --> 00:04:17,220
How can we go to Bingzhou?

92
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,220
How can we be so cautious?

93
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,220
Qiu Cui

94
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:22,220
Don't say it

95
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,220
You are right

96
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:26,220
There are six daughters

97
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,220
Only I

98
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:29,220
I am free and not smart

99
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:31,220
I have no place to go

100
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:33,220
If I don't go to the front

101
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,220
I will be in trouble

102
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,220
That's what Miss San said

103
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:39,220
Miss, don't go to the heart

104
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,220
Sun Dadu

105
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,220
You are my father

106
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,220
He is not good at being humble

107
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,220
So he is in trouble

108
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,220
There are many people in the capital

109
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,220
He is not good at being humble

110
00:04:52,220 --> 00:04:55,220
Now he is easy to be out of the prison

111
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,220
But he can't leave the capital

112
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,220
I can help him to go back to Bingzhou

113
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,220
It's my blessing

114
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:04,220
Miss, you are so naughty

115
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,220
When did you come here?

116
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,220
Now all the servants in the house

117
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:10,220
dare to give you a face

118
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:14,220
What he said to give you a face

119
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:16,220
You are embarrassed

120
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,220
What are you waiting for?

121
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,220
You are impolite

122
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,220
I am fine

123
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,220
D 256

124
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,220
It's very hard to get myself here

125
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,220
V adventure

126
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:29,220
He wants to kill

127
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,220
That's great

128
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:34,220
Where is Mr. Tang?

129
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:35,220
I am jingle

130
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,940
Miss

131
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,220
Miss

132
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,140
Now you're hiding in the corner of the palace.

133
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,740
Are you ashamed?

134
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,660
Han Gong.

135
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,500
You're such a weak woman.

136
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,100
You must be out of your mind.

137
00:05:50,540 --> 00:05:52,140
It's useless to be so anxious.

138
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,620
Since you're Mr. Cui's companion,

139
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,340
you're now in the capital of the city.

140
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,940
The army of Zhenxi is huge.

141
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:00,900
Since Mr. Cui is as good as you,

142
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:03,140
you'd better report to the army of Zhenxi.

143
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,380
Han Gong has already arrived at this place.

144
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,260
Don't forget to remember my future.

145
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,500
I really don't forget to meet Han Gong.

146
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:12,140
I don't want Han Gong to be so nice to me.

147
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:14,860
To you?

148
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,820
What's wrong with you?

149
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:20,180
Can you let me go?

150
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,260
Han Gong, you're mistaken.

151
00:06:22,780 --> 00:06:24,260
I'm grateful that you're not here.

152
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:25,580
How could I be so hard on you?

153
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,420
But the whole city says that

154
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,940
Han Gong is good at business.

155
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,500
He's got a lot of assets.

156
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:32,420
I'm now being pushed by Mr. Cui.

157
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,420
I'm so grateful.

158
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,820
I hope that Han Gong can be considerate

159
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:37,820
and easy to deal with.

160
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,300
Take it.

161
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,660
These jewelry are valuable.

162
00:06:50,260 --> 00:06:53,220
Why don't you take it and rely on Zhenxi?

163
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,300
Be careful.

164
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,100
Don't come over.

165
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,060
Miss.

166
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:11,140
Come here. I'll kill her.

167
00:07:11,140 --> 00:07:11,940
Miss.

168
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,540
Miss.

169
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,620
Miss.

170
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,940
Miss, please excuse me.

171
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,820
Thank you for your help.

172
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:43,740
Don't touch me.

173
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,620
Xiao Wei, do you want to rob me?

174
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:52,540
I'm willing to take revenge.

175
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:54,660
I can't lose to this man.

176
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,460
Miss, are you okay?

177
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:57,380
Miss.

178
00:07:57,540 --> 00:07:58,220
Hurry up.

179
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,100
Come here.

180
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:00,580
Who's that?

181
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:02,500
Finally, you've caught the old fox.

182
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,020
You've come late.

183
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,580
Han Li is ours.

184
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,860
Congratulations, Mr. Li.

185
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,700
Since Mr. Li has caught Han Li,

186
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,220
then our agreement with you

187
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,620
will be settled.

188
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,340
This city of Banzhou

189
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:20,060
will belong to your Zhenxi Army.

190
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:25,300
I'll take it.

191
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,500
Han Li was arrested by Zhenxi Army.

192
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:37,420
According to the contract,

193
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:39,140
the city of Banzhou belongs to them.

194
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:39,980
What?

195
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,540
When did you make this agreement with Zhenxi Army?

196
00:08:42,660 --> 00:08:43,540
How can it be?

197
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,860
He Xiao Wei, why didn't you tell me earlier?

198
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,620
He was the one who told me

199
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,660
that I asked him to do it.

200
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,380
Zhenxi Army is not good at this.

201
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,660
I've told you about it.

202
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,260
As soon as we enter the city,

203
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,060
we'll send people to take away the grain.

204
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:02,260
Even if Zhenxi Army

205
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
has the city of Banzhou,

206
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,940
they still have no food.

207
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:07,140
So that's the case.

208
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,900
I have something to ask you.

209
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:14,380
Lin, you're sending me to the town?

210
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,340
You're family.

211
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,260
Why bother to talk about it?

212
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,660
You're the commander of the army.

213
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,620
You can tell me.

214
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,420
Now that we're in the city,

215
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,420
Zhenxi Army has a plan.

216
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:24,780
We can't let it go.

217
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,100
I want to ask you to lead the army

218
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,220
to arrest the city.

219
00:09:28,540 --> 00:09:29,820
If something happens in the city,

220
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,900
you can take the test outside the city.

221
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,220
Just in case.

222
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,420
Well...

223
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,180
You want to arrest the city?

224
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,580
Lin's decision

225
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,700
must be yours.

226
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:43,740
I'll lead the army

227
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,820
to the city.

228
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,260
Thank you, brother.

229
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,500
You're all family.

230
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:50,540
You're welcome.

231
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,220
I know you don't like him.

232
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:02,180
So I sent him outside the city.

233
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:04,060
Thank you, sir.

234
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,020
Thank you, sir.

235
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,100
I said why didn't I see Shu?

236
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,500
So you sent Shu outside the city

237
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,620
to arrest Cui Li?

238
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,380
I'm Ying Ying.

239
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:13,780
Have some tea.

240
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,220
I'll pour it for you.

241
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,740
You're so mean.

242
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,020
Stop.

243
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:30,820
I'll say it again.

244
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:32,620
You Cui's army

245
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,820
will hand over

246
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,420
five-leaf-dry grain

247
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,860
to the city.

248
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,100
Zhenxi Army

249
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,940
is a great man.

250
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,540
It's up to the king

251
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:44,740
to decide

252
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,900
whether you can

253
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:47,780
stay in Banzhou City

254
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,660
and leave.

255
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:49,420
How's that?

256
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,060
Is it enough?

257
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,260
We brought Banzhou City

258
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,860
to the city.

259
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,900
We're in a relationship

260
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,260
but you're in Banzhou City.

261
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,060
Why did you

262
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,140
ask my dad to give you the grain?

263
00:11:02,140 --> 00:11:03,540
Do you think I'm a big man

264
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:05,180
when I'm in Banzhou City?

265
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,700
Banzhou City

266
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,700
was fought by us.

267
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,140
Without our Zhenxi Army,

268
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,820
Hanli would have fled to Jianzhou

269
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,100
and had been captured.

270
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,020
You dare to say that?

271
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,980
I said it.

272
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,140
Give me back the grain.

273
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,100
Say it again.

274
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:18,780
Is it this or the other time?

275
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:20,060
If we didn't have the army,

276
00:11:20,260 --> 00:11:21,460
you wouldn't have time to arrest Hanli.

277
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,420
Give us back the grain.

278
00:11:22,580 --> 00:11:23,820
I'll take care of Banzhou City.

279
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:30,820
Go.

280
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,420
Go.

281
00:11:31,420 --> 00:11:31,980
Go.

282
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:32,340
Go.

283
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:32,780
Go.

284
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,140
Go.

285
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,580
Go.

286
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,180
Go.

287
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:34,820
Go.

288
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:35,020
Go.

289
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:35,580
Go.

290
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:35,940
Go.

291
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:36,340
Go.

292
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,540
Hu Fu is not with Hanli.

293
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,500
Go.

294
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,540
Yes.

295
00:11:40,420 --> 00:11:41,060
Go.

296
00:11:41,060 --> 00:11:41,620
Go.

297
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,780
Go.

298
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,420
They're in Hanli's house.

299
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,180
They've been looking for him.

300
00:11:46,180 --> 00:11:46,900
They haven't seen him.

301
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,220
Then you dare to hit me.

302
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:48,780
Go.

303
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:49,660
Go.

304
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:50,180
Go.

305
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,700
Go.

306
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,220
Go.

307
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,740
It seems

308
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:54,260
that Hu Fu is not with Hanli.

309
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,980
Go.

310
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:55,380
Go.

311
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:55,980
Go.

312
00:11:55,980 --> 00:11:56,420
Go.

313
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:56,700
Go.

314
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:58,060
The young master Cui

315
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,780
is a well-known guest in the battlefield.

316
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:01,180
He's a real man.

317
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,100
He's a man with a weak heart.

318
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,300
He's not a man.

319
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,820
He's just a little white face.

320
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:09,660
How dare you say I didn't deal with the city?

321
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:10,900
You were still here

322
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:12,300
when I was in charge.

323
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,420
You're not capable.

324
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,180
Beat him.

325
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:14,700
Come on.

326
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:15,260
Come on.

327
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,100
You'll be beaten to death if you're afraid.

328
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:17,580
Come on.

329
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:20,020
See how I'll fix you, you bastard.

330
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:24,820
Boss.

331
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,940
I bought this early in the morning.

332
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:28,180
It's all your favorite food.

333
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,220
Thank you, young master.

334
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:43,540
It's delicious.

335
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:45,660
I'll beat you to death.

336
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,140
Let me help you.

337
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:49,940
Stop.

338
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:58,620
I'm hungry.

339
00:12:59,180 --> 00:12:59,700
Let's eat first.

340
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:00,820
Eat?

341
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:02,500
I'm not hungry.

342
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:04,900
I said I'm hungry.

343
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:28,460
What's this?

344
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:32,260
Wei.

345
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,060
That imperial grandson

346
00:13:34,060 --> 00:13:35,940
picked up the hairpin you lost.

347
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I didn't expect

348
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,420
Tang Tang's imperial grandson

349
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:40,980
to be so handsome.

350
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,300
He's so cheap.

351
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:43,820
He's not paying back after picking up others.

352
00:13:43,820 --> 00:13:44,780
He's so shameless

353
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,940
to put the hairpin on himself.

354
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:48,460
I'll go get it for you.

355
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:48,860
I...

356
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,140
Don't.

357
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:50,740
Don't do this.

358
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,180
It's a big deal.

359
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:58,780
The hairpin he drooled

360
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:00,060
lost, right?

361
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,260
Why is he being했다anian?

362
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:05,460
It's leather.

363
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,340
He Xiaowei gave it to him.

364
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:11,660
Qi Xiteng Salary

365
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,740
has always been

366
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,620
theanatic royal family

367
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,460
in Banzhou.

368
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:14,820
Both king and emperor

369
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:15,920
are living in Banzhou.

370
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:17,180
No one

371
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,240
can remember

372
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:19,500
which family they would be a talking prerogative to.

373
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,000
What a fortune, I'm afraid.

374
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,560
I'll bring out

375
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,780
your narrow-minded young lady.

376
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,440
Your starch這樣子

377
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:25,740
in an odd.

378
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:26,780
This Tweeting Pre smashing.

379
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,020
Why are the top soldiers of the men's army

380
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:28,620
so shameless,

381
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:29,460
or doesn't he have it?

382
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:30,460
These soldiers Anti-Indomitable Army

383
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,140
will fight back

384
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,580
sooner or later.

385
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,300
If we can't settling in,

386
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,060
then it'll be ours!

387
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,460
Have they waited much for the two fronts?

388
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,740
I dare not.

389
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,220
Our general told

390
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,820
the arr leg of Big spontaneous palace in moving the capital

391
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:45,520
for a clare Nope

392
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,620
to take over your opposition's Nightける

393
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:49,620
People focus on getting united

394
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:52,060
to live up to glorious success.

395
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:53,940
They may have ending time

396
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,940
but our two forces

397
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:57,700
including my son.

398
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,100
I'm counting on you two.

399
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,620
Yes.

400
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:05,300
It seems that

401
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,220
the Western Army is not going to attack.

402
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,340
No.

403
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,940
Your son has finished

404
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,060
the words that General Jiang Jun has told me.

405
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:14,580
The Western Army will attack too.

406
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,620
Thank you.

407
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,620
What's the use of your mouth?

408
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,300
Your mouth is so slow.

409
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,100
I'm sorry.

410
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,300
Why did Royal Descendant come here?

411
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,460
I have something to ask He Xiao Wei.

412
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,260
He is just a military officer.

413
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,620
If it's military affairs,

414
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,180
Royal Descendant should tell me directly.

415
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,700
That's just a small matter.

416
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:49,180
Don't bother to ask for his permission.

417
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,100
I heard that a few days ago,

418
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:55,220
He Xiao Wei was trapped in Han Li's Mansion.

419
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:57,660
Royal Descendant was called to take care of He Xiao Wei.

420
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,500
He could be trapped first.

421
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,100
With Royal Descendant's help,

422
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:03,940
I should

423
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:05,340
take good care of him

424
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:06,780
and thank you.

425
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:08,740
Are you the soldiers of the Cui family

426
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,700
the soldiers of the Qin Dynasty?

427
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:10,460
I think so.

428
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,140
No.

429
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,820
I grew up with He Xiao Wei.

430
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,660
I have a long relationship with him.

431
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:18,100
Royal Descendant is so filial to He Xiao Wei.

432
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,220
He is waiting for him.

433
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,780
In Preemption dynasty...

434
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,220
I knew

435
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:26,220
that you would come for me.

436
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,300
Why are you here?

437
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,540
It's just that...

438
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,580
I wanted to see you.

439
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,140
My lord.

440
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,140
Recruits.

441
00:16:42,420 --> 00:16:43,540
Today is a涼ole.

442
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:44,980
Do you still have sick girls?

443
00:16:45,460 --> 00:16:46,580
Do you need to look for several doctors?

444
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,980
Doctorわき 昭と お兄 twoの Add youtube videos

445
00:16:48,980 --> 00:16:50,500
I've visited the doctor.

446
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:53,180
I'm just a little bit of a minor injury.

447
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,180
It's okay.

448
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,660
I came to thank you.

449
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,740
If you don't have my grandson today,

450
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,500
I'll have ordered the imperial edict.

451
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:02,340
You're welcome.

452
00:17:02,780 --> 00:17:03,740
I just took the responsibility.

453
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:06,100
You don't have to call me your grandson.

454
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,980
Just call me the imperial edict in the army.

455
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:10,500
Come in.

456
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,340
The weather has changed.

457
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:19,420
You're wearing such a short dress,

458
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,020
so you're leaving.

459
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,060
No wonder you're coughing.

460
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,700
If you let Taozi know,

461
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:23,980
you'll be willing to buy me a husband.

462
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:25,860
It's okay.

463
00:17:26,620 --> 00:17:29,300
I've been observing you since today.

464
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,100
That Li Huangsun is indeed like you.

465
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:34,180
He's a rare general.

466
00:17:35,500 --> 00:17:36,460
He's not easy to get rid of.

467
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:42,100
Li Ni is indeed a vicious person.

468
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,180
If the army of Zhenxi can fight and fight,

469
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:46,220
if they can fight with each other,

470
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,060
it must be a failure.

471
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,260
But if they become enemies,

472
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,060
to be honest,

473
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,020
if there's a rival like Li Ni,

474
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,420
I'm afraid we can't fight.

475
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,300
The army of Zhenxi

476
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:02,420
has given up the title of Prince Qin.

477
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,940
No matter what,

478
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,460
it's not up to us.

479
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:09,580
There must be a way out.

480
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,460
Do you have a family in the city?

481
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:14,500
I'll ask the old man to send you back.

482
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,260
I'm not like you.

483
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:18,780
I'm from the Gu family.

484
00:18:18,940 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm from Wan Niang.

485
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:21,500
I'm from the capital.

486
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,540
I was ordered by my father

487
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,140
to go back to the Banzhou family.

488
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,460
Banzhou's hometown?

489
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,100
I remember that hometown

490
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,820
was also born in Banzhou's hometown.

491
00:18:33,860 --> 00:18:36,140
I heard that the eldest son of Sun Jingruan

492
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
was killed in the prison in the court.

493
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:41,220
That's my father.

494
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,740
Then Sun Jingrui bought the heart of the people

495
00:18:44,980 --> 00:18:46,660
and released my father from prison

496
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
and moved to the family.

497
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:51,020
I asked him to go back to the Banzhou family

498
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,460
and give my father a blessing.

499
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:56,220
So you're the Miss of the Gu family.

500
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:00,260
My father is a good person.

501
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,180
I've seen Zhenxi today.

502
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,780
I know that the army is weak and the people are weak.

503
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,220
I'm willing to live in the Banzhou family

504
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:09,700
and live with Zhenxi.

505
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,660
I hope you can be victorious

506
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:13,060
and recover your capital soon.

507
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,940
This way, not only will the people be saved,

508
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,060
but also my father will be saved.

509
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,580
I'm loyal to you.

510
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,220
Miss Gu has a good mind.

511
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,860
She's a good person.

512
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:28,020
I have a request.

513
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,740
Please accept my request.

514
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,140
Miss Gu, please open the door.

515
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,940
Now the war is over.

516
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,620
The capital is far away from Banzhou.

517
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:40,140
I'm afraid that I can't go back to the capital alone.

518
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:41,300
Please accept my request

519
00:19:41,300 --> 00:19:42,740
and let me follow you.

520
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:44,380
I can also earn my fortune

521
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,940
and earn my capital in the Banzhou family.

522
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,180
The army is very tough.

523
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:52,140
It's not convenient for you to lead the army.

524
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:54,220
No matter how hard the army is,

525
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,540
I can bear it.

526
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,220
If you have any concerns,

527
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:58,860
I'll be a man with Qiu Cui Jie.

528
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,300
I won't trouble you.

529
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,620
I'll send a group of people

530
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
to escort you back to the capital.

531
00:20:06,340 --> 00:20:07,460
You're busy with military affairs.

532
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:08,540
I don't want you to

533
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,820
keep me from the army.

534
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:11,020
As long as you agree

535
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:12,060
to let me follow you

536
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,220
from far away,

537
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,280
it'll be difficult for me.

538
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,020
Oh.

539
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:34,780
Then okay.

540
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,060
Be a man in the army.

541
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,580
Thank you, General.

542
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:45,160
going out?

543
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:46,260
Yes.

544
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:49,120
He says he uses Imperial Consort stove as interior ups and products,

545
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,440
and broadesses would use it for exterior ups.

546
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:53,840
He says he uses Imperial Consort's products to prophecy really well—

547
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:58,340
Khinkulling is coordinatelyodox and impolite.

548
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,820
What?

549
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:02,760
You mean I have to implicate?

550
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:05,860
As an among-barbes of the Imperial Consort,

551
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:07,240
the occupied Foreman Huographer Xu hamburgeres.

552
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:11,360
He says that he used them asacer.

553
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
I'm the crown princess's maid, Zheng Liu Pin.

554
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:16,360
You're the maid and the fifth-ranked maid of the State.

555
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,360
What?

556
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,360
A maid and the fifth-ranked maid

557
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:21,360
wants to fight against the maid and the sixth-ranked maid in the palace?

558
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,360
You're a noble and unruly woman.

559
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,360
You have no rules.

560
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,360
What a despicable and despicable maid.

561
00:21:28,360 --> 00:21:29,360
The State's wife is so cunning.

562
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,360
How can she be so modest?

563
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,360
She's now in the palace.

564
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,360
She must have rules and etiquette.

565
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,360
She can't make people laugh.

566
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:40,360
She can't make people laugh.

567
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:43,360
Laugh?

568
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,360
I want to see who dares to laugh at me now.

569
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:54,360
No rules.

570
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
I have to teach you.

571
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,360
You...

572
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,360
You're a traitor.

573
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,360
Don't cry anymore.

574
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,360
I'm not sure.

575
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:10,360
It's so hard to hear the wind and rain outside.

576
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:13,360
But the消息 is the late crown prince's consort.

577
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:15,360
Since the late crown prince is a man of his own,

578
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,360
if he's a sensible person,

579
00:22:16,360 --> 00:22:17,360
he should be the late crown prince.

580
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,360
Even if he's not,

581
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:21,360
he should be the first to be the late crown prince.

582
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
But how can a person with such a wise and wise mind

583
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,360
be confused by the消息?

584
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,360
He must have made a fuss with your brother-in-law.

585
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:35,360
Think about it.

586
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,360
All these years,

587
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,360
he's been in this mansion with so many machines.

588
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,360
He's never been a man of his own.

589
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:47,360
How could he be so good if he keeps doing this?

590
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,360
Don't panic, Jin.

591
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:51,360
The war is over.

592
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
Most of us are just letting our officials

593
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:55,360
fight for him.

594
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:57,360
We must give him three points.

595
00:22:58,360 --> 00:23:02,360
But the消息 is still in the palace.

596
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:06,360
Maybe there's something that can't be done.

597
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,360
We can't catch him.

598
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:10,360
We should kill this demon

599
00:23:10,360 --> 00:23:12,360
for the sake of the brothers of Shu Bo.

600
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,360
We should kill him for the sake of the secret.

601
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:34,360
You may leave.

602
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,360
I've been wanting to go to Fuji Mountain

603
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,360
before I came here.

604
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:00,360
Since we're here again,

605
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,360
we met for the first time

606
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:08,360
in Qixi Mountain in that year.

607
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,360
I've known you for a long time.

608
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,360
I didn't know you were so close to me.

609
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,360
You're talking about Fuji Mountain again?

610
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:21,360
Are you still angry with your wife?

611
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,360
I've been staying in the palace for ten days.

612
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:33,360
I've seen a lot of things.

613
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,360
I'm a good girl.

614
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:37,360
I can't be too rude.

615
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,360
I'll just leave the city and have a talk.

616
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,360
Today,

617
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,360
my wife is my daughter-in-law.

618
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,360
If I don't return her,

619
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:50,360
she'll kill me that day.

620
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,360
Will Dugu

621
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,600
make up for your

622
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,360
political wife for me?

623
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:00,360
That's not the case.

624
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,360
Chen Junyuan is Dugu's wife.

625
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,360
Dugu is always important.

626
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,360
I offended my wife today

627
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:10,360
and asked her to go out to repair the knife.

628
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:13,360
I'm not here to make others' eyes.

629
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,360
You were about to ask me to come.

630
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,360
How could I dare to ask Dugu?

631
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,360
I was afraid I'd stay in the palace

632
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,360
and die in a place where I'm not well.

633
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:28,360
I'd rather go out to repair the knife

634
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:30,360
than to go to the country.

635
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
I'd like to see

636
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,360
which knife can make you feel better.

637
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:45,360
You gave me a knife.

638
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,360
It's a place where you can repair the knife.

639
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:51,360
The place is very close to the west.

640
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:54,360
It's very convenient to go out.

641
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,360
But

642
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,360
maybe after I go out

643
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,360
for less than three or five days,

644
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:06,360
you'll forget me.

645
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,360
You really want to repair the knife?

646
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:16,360
I don't want to stay in the palace.

647
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:19,360
Lady Wei is not a cruel person.

648
00:26:19,360 --> 00:26:21,360
She can't avoid

649
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,360
the difficulties everywhere.

650
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,360
Besides,

651
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,360
the people in the palace

652
00:26:26,360 --> 00:26:28,360
are always guilty.

653
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,360
I don't want to be told three to four times.

654
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,360
Don't think about the repair.

655
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,360
But

656
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:45,360
the lady next to you

657
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,360
looks like a good person.

658
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,360
Why don't you let her take you out?

659
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:57,360
You're right.

660
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,360
To show your love to Lady Wei,

661
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,360
you asked me to repair the knife

662
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:04,360
and then you'd rather give me a pot of wine

663
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:07,360
and let me drink it right away.

664
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,360
She's your lady.

665
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:13,360
She's always been a good person

666
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,360
to Lady Wei.

667
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,360
What about Lady Wei's maid?

668
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,360
She's the one who hit me.

669
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,360
Do you want her to go out to repair the knife?

670
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:24,360
Look at you.

671
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,360
Why are you so stubborn?

672
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:30,360
If you're a good person,

673
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
you can't be a maid.

674
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,360
I'll let Lady Wei go out to repair the knife.

675
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:35,360
Otherwise,

676
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,360
I'll talk to you.

677
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:00,360
Where's Feng Paozi?

678
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,360
Let me help you.

679
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,360
Fine.

680
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
Feng Da hasn't recovered yet.

681
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,360
Last time, he was singing like a harem

682
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
in the room.

683
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:14,360
Let me ask you something.

684
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,360
I heard that you asked Miss Gu to wear the manor

685
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:19,360
and go with us to the army, right?

686
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,360
Yes.

687
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:22,360
She's carrying a maid

688
00:28:22,360 --> 00:28:24,360
and wants to go back to the capital.

689
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,360
She's always been in a hurry to go out.

690
00:28:26,360 --> 00:28:28,360
She might lose her life on the way.

691
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:29,360
Instead of that,

692
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,360
why don't you go with us?

693
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:32,360
First time?

694
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,360
I saw you so face-to-face with Xiyu for the first time.

695
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:37,360
Are you going to be a woman

696
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,360
who's been acting like a woman?

697
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,360
No.

698
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,360
I really think Miss Gu is good.

699
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,360
She's good enough for you.

700
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,360
She's good enough for you.

701
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,360
So you're the one who's looking after Miss Gu.

702
00:28:53,360 --> 00:28:54,360
Me?

703
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:55,360
Just say it.

704
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,360
I'll write a letter to General Pei.

705
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,360
I'll ask for your help.

706
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,360
No.

707
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:00,360
What are you doing?

708
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:02,360
It's you, okay?

709
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:04,360
You're making a woman's life miserable.

710
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,360
You're still in the army with me.

711
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
What's wrong with the woman's life?

712
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:11,360
Look at the smile on her face.

713
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,360
The people are all kind and brave.

714
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:17,360
There are many men in the world.

715
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,360
I hear you mean

716
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,360
you don't look like Miss Gu

717
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:31,360
but the He Xiao Wei.

718
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:34,360
Nonsense.

719
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,360
Nonsense.

720
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,360
Xiao Wei.

721
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,360
Xiao Wei.

722
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,360
The windmill?

723
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,360
I took the windmill you left in the inn.

724
00:29:56,360 --> 00:29:58,360
Let me have a look.

725
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:00,360
But Xiao Wei.

726
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:02,360
Why are you still standing on the counter

727
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:04,360
in the inn?

728
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:06,360
You asked me to take it back.

729
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Look.

730
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:09,360
It's just a small coin on the market.

731
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,360
It's neither a surprise nor a money.

732
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:12,360
It's broken.

733
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:13,360
Why are you keeping it?

734
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,360
It's broken.

735
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:16,360
Look.

736
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:20,360
It's fine when you give it to the manager.

737
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:23,360
You must have been careful.

738
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,360
I finally got it.

739
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,360
Okay.

740
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,360
It's not that big.

741
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,360
Be careful not to get hurt by the noodle.

742
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,360
Let me do it.

743
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,360
It's not suitable for you.

744
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,360
Okay.

745
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:02,360
Let's go to the meeting tomorrow night.

746
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,360
Don't you need to hold a party?

747
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,360
I've already left the boring business to others.

748
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,360
How about you?

749
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:11,360
Do you want to be with Mr. Cui?

750
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:13,360
No need.

751
00:32:14,360 --> 00:32:16,360
Then it's settled.

752
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,360
It's settled.

753
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,360
It's settled.

754
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,360
It's settled.

755
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,360
It's settled.

756
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,360
It's settled.

757
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,360
It's settled.

758
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:34,360
It's settled.

759
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,360
It's settled.

760
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:37,360
It's settled.

761
00:32:37,360 --> 00:32:39,360
Let's go to the meeting tomorrow night.

762
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,360
I have something to do tonight.

763
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,360
I'm not going.

764
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,360
Are you going to hold a meeting with Mr. Cui?

765
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:46,360
I'm not going to sit at the lantern pit

766
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:48,360
and have people talk about it.

767
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:51,360
What's the matter with you?

768
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,360
I...

769
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,360
I'm afraid that Mr. Zheng will have a plan.

770
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,360
I have to go and check

771
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,360
what they are doing.

772
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:00,360
Okay.

773
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:01,360
I'll go with you.

774
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,360
I'll help you.

775
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,360
No need.

776
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:05,360
You can help me

777
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,360
to look after Mr. Zheng's Xie Chang'er.

778
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:08,360
This person

779
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:09,360
is not only a relative of Li Ni,

780
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,360
but also a person who can listen to the wind and change things.

781
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,360
You have to watch him for a while.

782
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,360
You can't let him have a chance to act secretly.

783
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,360
I'm telling you,

784
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:25,360
why are you so sad?

785
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,360
Tomorrow night,

786
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,360
at the Xixi Lantern Festival,

787
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,360
the 17th Wolf is ordered to kill Han Li

788
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,360
to defend the army.

789
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Yes.

790
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:34,360
The 17th Wolf is our arrangement.

791
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:36,360
Isn't it all arranged?

792
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,360
But he asked me to take Miss Taozi away.

793
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,360
He's not allowed to follow He Xiaowei.

794
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:41,360
Why?

795
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,360
Since someone doesn't want

796
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:46,360
Taozi to follow He Xiaowei,

797
00:33:46,360 --> 00:33:48,360
of course, someone wants to take her away.

798
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,360
I'm not going to let her follow her.

799
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:50,360
If you want to follow He Xiaowei,

800
00:33:50,360 --> 00:33:52,360
of course, someone wants to follow her.

801
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:55,360
Just do as the 17th Wolf says.

802
00:33:56,360 --> 00:33:58,360
But how can I take Miss Taozi away?

803
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I'll beat her up.

804
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:04,360
She knows how to be kind and caring.

805
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,360
If I really want to fight with her,

806
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,360
I'm not her opponent.

807
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,360
I'm telling you,

808
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,360
you're just a fool.

809
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,360
You can ask Miss Taozi

810
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:14,360
to come to the lantern meeting.

811
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
Think about it.

812
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:30,360
Miss Taozi.

813
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,360
Miss Taozi.

814
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,360
Today,

815
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:39,360
the wedding is not as good as the first day of the wedding.

816
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,360
Why did you invite me to watch the lantern?

817
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:53,360
Because I'm the only one here today.

818
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:54,360
Everyone else has something to do.

819
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,360
I think Miss Taozi is the only one here.

820
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:58,360
Otherwise, we'll be in trouble.

821
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,360
So you're bored and bored.

822
00:34:59,360 --> 00:35:00,360
That's why you invited me here?

823
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,360
No, Miss Taozi.

824
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,360
I didn't mean that.

825
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,360
Forget it.

826
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Just think of it as nothing.

827
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,360
Stop.

828
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,360
If you want to invite me to watch the lantern,

829
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:14,360
you can invite me here.

830
00:35:15,360 --> 00:35:16,360
If you come, you can say it.

831
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,360
Why are you taking me here?

832
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:19,360
No, Miss Taozi.

833
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:20,360
I'll take you there.

834
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,360
Let's watch the lantern together tonight.

835
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,360
Thank you, Miss Taozi.

836
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,360
No need.

837
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,360
After all, I'm not in trouble.

838
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,360
What trouble?

839
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,360
Miss Taozi.

840
00:35:47,360 --> 00:35:48,360
Be careful.

841
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,360
How did you come up with this idea?

842
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,360
You look so pretty.

843
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,360
To show it,

844
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,360
you have to change your makeup.

845
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:59,360
This way, you can lower the guard's heart.

846
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,360
You're so smart.

847
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:02,360
Let's go.

848
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,360
Let's go to the right place.

849
00:36:05,360 --> 00:36:06,360
Let's go.

850
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,360
Let's go.

851
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,360
Come on.

852
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:58,360
You look so pretty today.

853
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,360
I almost didn't recognize you.

854
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:04,340
You're so pretty today, so I'm almost not able to recognize you.

855
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,320
Please.

856
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,360
We must get up there now!

857
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:33,280
Yes!

858
00:37:33,280 --> 00:37:34,380
Good!

859
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:35,880
We must get up there!

860
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:40,520
Come on, put on good clothes!

861
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:45,480
Good!

862
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,380
Put on good clothes!

863
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:54,960
Slow!

864
00:37:54,960 --> 00:37:58,920
Look, it is like asuspending أ diffuse a式.

865
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,920
Here, Old Zhang. I want a car.

866
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,360
You choose.

867
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:04,640
Add this.

868
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:05,920
Okay.

869
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,400
Father.

870
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:10,040
Here.

871
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:13,160
You like cars?

872
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,480
Not really.

873
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,760
But Xiao Wei has a car.

874
00:38:17,920 --> 00:38:18,920
It's on the bookshelf.

875
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:21,760
The car she saw every day is so nice.

876
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,080
The car broke down last time.

877
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,360
She refused to throw it.

878
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,960
She didn't want to repair it.

879
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,400
But the car won't be broken down.

880
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:30,320
Only two doors.

881
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:31,560
What?

882
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,360
I told her that.

883
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,640
I said,

884
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,600
I'll buy a new one for you.

885
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,160
But she said I don't know.

886
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:40,120
She said

887
00:38:40,520 --> 00:38:42,520
the car can't be bought by herself.

888
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,760
It's only if someone else gives it to her.

889
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,240
So I saw that person just now.

890
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,160
I thought

891
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,040
I must give it to someone else.

892
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,200
I want to see

893
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,080
where the car that someone else gave it to is.

894
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:58,520
So you want me to give you the money?

895
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:01,880
Buy a car for me.

896
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:04,040
You should feel very honored.

897
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:06,360
Honored.

898
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:10,920
But

899
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,840
if someone else bought a car,

900
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,520
where is it?

901
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,160
How can I not see it?

902
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,560
Great.

903
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,600
All Happy Dreams.

904
00:39:52,520 --> 00:39:54,440
It's so beautiful here.

905
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:58,440
There are countless grasslands on our flat.

906
00:39:58,440 --> 00:40:01,440
My father used to take me out for hunting when I was a kid.

907
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:04,440
Sometimes I slept on the horse back.

908
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,440
When I woke up I opened my eyes and saw stars in the sky.

909
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,440
It was like candy falling down.

910
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,440
I grew up in the capital.

911
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,440
Since I learned riding horse,

912
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,440
I have often traveled alone to the Leyou Park.

913
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,680
The İyiou Hallelujah is a ensuring place

914
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:25,280
for enemy officials.

915
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,120
It's high

916
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:28,880
and you can

917
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,800
see the whole capital there.

918
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,120
There are numerous units.

919
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,320
An unlocking tower.

920
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:39,240
İyiou will have wings.

921
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,720
Shells will form and lose power.

922
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,040
циano stated that

923
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,120
your way is more making sir tongue.

924
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,520
So, you like this one

925
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:49,880
but also many other.

926
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,600
Wait.

927
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,120
I know which one you like.

928
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:53,960
What?

929
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,840
The leaves are green, the grass is green.

930
00:40:57,120 --> 00:40:58,880
The leaves are ripe, the leaves are soft.

931
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,760
The fire is not burning.

932
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:02,680
The spring breeze is blowing.

933
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,240
Is that right?

934
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,640
How do you know I like this one?

935
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,520
It's simple and simple.

936
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:14,640
It's not easy to fight.

937
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:16,960
Because I know that Li Huang is such a person.

938
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,400
So I know you like this one.

939
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,840
Actually inside,

940
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:23,960
having fun with you,

941
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:25,840
is not easy to fight back too.

942
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:27,840
So how do you know this one?

943
00:41:30,840 --> 00:41:31,880
Impressive.

944
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,760
Apposporial?

945
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:35,320
I'd as well

946
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:37,400
as the doctor.

947
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:38,320
My fault.

948
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:41,000
You yourself were new.

949
00:41:41,360 --> 00:41:42,480
I totally knew that.

950
00:41:44,440 --> 00:41:45,480
There will be an emergency.

951
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:46,800
Why?

952
00:42:16,800 --> 00:42:23,620
Happy New Year

953
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,800
I will live for you

954
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:24,800
I will live for you

955
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:29,800
I will wait for my time

956
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,800
to pass through the cold and cold

957
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:36,800
If I can't remember

958
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,800
the promise I made to you

959
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,800
I will live for you

960
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:47,800
I will live for you

961
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:52,800
I will live for you

962
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:56,800
I will live for you

963
00:43:56,800 --> 00:44:01,800
I will wait for your time

964
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,800
If I can't remember

965
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,800
the promise I made to you

966
00:44:07,800 --> 00:44:11,800
I will live for you

967
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:15,800

968
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,800
