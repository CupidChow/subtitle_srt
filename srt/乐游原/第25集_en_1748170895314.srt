1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,100
What is this?

2
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:18,580
It vuosn receive a praise

3
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,460
But evil naivety begins the slutting

4
00:00:24,360 --> 00:00:25,860
Keep Truth

5
00:00:27,860 --> 00:00:28,680
Help me

6
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:34,680
The night is passing by, the night is falling

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:43,680
The mirror of the night is the heaven

8
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:49,680
When the encounter is parting, when the encounter is distant

9
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,680
I will never forget

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:02,680
The light of the sky is shining, the sky is shining

11
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:11,680
The wind is blowing in the wind, the sky is shining

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:14,680
The wind is blowing in the wind, the sky is shining

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:18,680
The cold snow is falling, the moon is singing

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:24,680
I will never let you be by my side, never let you be by my side

15
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,680
The sun is shining, the sky is shining, I will be with you till the end

16
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:35,680
I will never forget the moment when the fire of destiny is extinguished

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,680
The Night Is Coming To The End

18
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:43,680
Episode 19

19
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:45,960
People are wise.

20
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,440
Some people want to kiss the world.

21
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,960
But I just want to accept it.

22
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,720
Wait for the world to be peaceful.

23
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:01,600
And go to the Lan Temple with you to become a border.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,840
Of course I don't want to go to the Lan Temple with you.

25
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,180
Okay.

26
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,660
Okay.

27
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,740
I know I can't force you,

28
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,240
but I still hope

29
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:33,320
to be with you

30
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,900
because I'm willing to.

31
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:43,160
So you want me to come with you.

32
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:44,160
Yes.

33
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,640
Let's say all about me with remorse after the我說.

34
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,080
,

35
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,000
Yes.

36
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,560
Ah,

37
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,320
Go ahead.

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:01,160
Now that we can't reach our own conclusion,

39
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:07,240
We should remember

40
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,880
for a long time.

41
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,180
you've passed away.

42
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:22,180
If in your heart,

43
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,180
that day was not right.

44
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,180
I shouldn't have told you that.

45
00:03:30,680 --> 00:03:32,180
But I understand your thoughts.

46
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,180
You don't want to see me

47
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,680
exchange my life for someone else

48
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,680
if we were in love that day,

49
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,680
I think I would do the same.

50
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:59,180
What's the point of saying this now?

51
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:02,180
Go back now.

52
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,180
Don't delay the engagement.

53
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,180
Take care of yourself.

54
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,680
I'll wait for my order.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,680
If in love,

56
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,680
I can promise you,

57
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,680
I won't fall for you

58
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,680
even if I'm not happy.

59
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:37,680
I'm happy for you.

60
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,680
I'll wait for you to be with me.

61
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
If in love,

62
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,680
we have promised each other,

63
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,680
we will love each other

64
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:55,680
and we will be together.

65
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,680
I'm happy for you.

66
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,680
I'm happy for you.

67
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,680
If in love,

68
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:14,680
I can promise you,

69
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:18,680
I won't fall for you

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
even if I'm not happy.

71
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,680
I'm happy for you.

72
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,680
I'll wait for you to be with me.

73
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I'm happy for you.

74
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,680
I know you're going to come here.

75
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,680
So I brought you here with me.

76
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,680
How about it?

77
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:15,680
It's enough, right?

78
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,680
Unlike some people,

79
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,680
they're all pregnant.

80
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,680
Go back first.

81
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:23,680
Father has a wife.

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,680
I'll go back.

83
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,680
I'll go back.

84
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:29,680
I'll go back.

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
I'll go back.

86
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,680
I'll go back.

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,680
I'll go back.

88
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,680
Go back first.

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,680
Father has a wife.

90
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Okay.

91
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Go.

92
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:54,680
Go.

93
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Taozi.

94
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,680
Taozi.

95
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,680
I brought you your favorite dried fruit.

96
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,680
Here.

97
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,680
Here.

98
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:09,680
Here.

99
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,680
What's wrong?

100
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:14,680
You don't even want to eat dried fruit.

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,680
I don't want to eat dried fruit.

102
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
But tomorrow,

103
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,680
I'll leave with Xiao Wei.

104
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,680
Why?

105
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Why so fast?

106
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,680
Sir,

107
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
you know that

108
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,680
Xiao Wei had a serious illness.

109
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,680
He did not to be worried.

110
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
He must be here,

111
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,680
to inform you.

112
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,680
But he's a senior gentleman of ald أrz.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:46,680
He's perfectly ok.

114
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
We must take him away quickly.

115
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,680
I'll walk you out tomorrow.

116
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
Don't come here.

117
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,680
Xiao Wei is unhappy.

118
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,680
I don't want him to see the people in the army.

119
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:03,000
I'll go tell the commander now.

120
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
Tell him to accompany Xiao Wei.

121
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:06,680
Come back.

122
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240
I don't know anything.

123
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:10,400
Don't make trouble.

124
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:11,760
But...

125
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,840
But I don't want to be separated from you.

126
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:17,440
I...

127
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,800
Because I want you to stay open.

128
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,280
I can trust you both.

129
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,800
I just hope you can live a peaceful life.

130
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,480
Meng Zhiyu wasn'tzhu Principle.

131
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,160
Did not saves you hope?

132
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,320
What's in you?

133
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:48,840
I'll feel sad if I separate from you.

134
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:50,640
If I separate from you,

135
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,040
I'll be very happy.

136
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,840
I'll be very happy.

137
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,440
Why do you have to

138
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,440
even give me a ride?

139
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,640
You're standing here

140
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,240
looking at the sky and earth.

141
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,840
Who said I was looking at the sky and earth?

142
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,840
I'm looking at two mountains.

143
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,840
It doesn't matter now.

144
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,440
What's important is

145
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,640
that you'll be empty-handed

146
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:15,840
when you're in this mood.

147
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,440
You'll know the taste.

148
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,240
Come on.

149
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,640
Did you find anything

150
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:23,840
about the person who sent the order?

151
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,040
Well,

152
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,840
I have some traces in the book.

153
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,240
But I can't see anything.

154
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,840
Those people are very cautious.

155
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,840
By the way,

156
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,440
will you go to Miss Cui?

157
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,440
I heard that Miss Cui

158
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,640
hasn't recovered yet.

159
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,840
She was sitting in the carriage while walking.

160
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,240
You're not going to escort her?

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
It's not because of her.

162
00:10:45,640 --> 00:10:47,240
I came here because of her.

163
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
Moreover,

164
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,640
she was taken by the army.

165
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,840
Her father sent soldiers to pick her up.

166
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,640
She won't be in trouble.

167
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,640
I say you're just a dead duck.

168
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
If you don't go after her,

169
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,240
you'll regret it in the future.

170
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:07,240
I still put my thoughts in the right place.

171
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:08,640
The same rule is certain.

172
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,640
The army should be clear.

173
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,240
What are you looking at?

174
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,840
I'm looking at two lonely leaves.

175
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,840
They're always like a man and a woman.

176
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,840
They're so pitiful.

177
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,640
I don't know

178
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:28,840
if they can fly together.

179
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:45,840
Lord Qin pleaded with the court.

180
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,440
He's back to the capital today.

181
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,440
At first,

182
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,440
the Ministry of Rites still asked for the official transfer.

183
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:52,640
After Lord Qin got it,

184
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,040
he gave him a discount.

185
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,240
But today,

186
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,840
all the girls in Manjing

187
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,640
are all heading to the streets

188
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:01,840
to see Lord Qin lead the army to return.

189
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,240
After that,

190
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:04,640
they're going to the capital.

191
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:06,840
They're all going to the capital.

192
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,640
They're all going to the capital.

193
00:12:08,840 --> 00:12:09,840
They're going to the capital.

194
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,840
They're all going to the capital.

195
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:11,840
They're all going to the capital.

196
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,240
They're all going to the capital.

197
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:14,640
They're all going to the capital.

198
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,840
Lord Qin is really

199
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,440
a brave and ungrateful man.

200
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,240
If you want to say something,

201
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,240
just say it.

202
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,040
When are you going to see Lord Qin?

203
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,640
In three days.

204
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,240
Why in three days?

205
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,040
I'll wait for someone.

206
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:35,040
When that person is here,

207
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,640
I can see Lord Qin.

208
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,040
Lord Qin.

209
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:48,360
Your Majesty,

210
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,040
there are so many girls here in Manjing.

211
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,000
But it's hard to find a girl

212
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,120
here, so there's no one around.

213
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:57,440
Insane.

214
00:12:58,040 --> 00:12:59,240
No one around here.

215
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,640
No girl here either.

216
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,040
If we can get some girls.

217
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:07,240
Everyone around here

218
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:09,040
should go there,

219
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:10,240
right?

220
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,340
We're running out of time.

221
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,500
At first, he was just a pervert.

222
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,300
He was always bored.

223
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:16,860
He even put on a ugly face.

224
00:13:17,460 --> 00:13:18,140
What?

225
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,740
Did someone make you angry?

226
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,580
Or did someone

227
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:24,020
give Prince Qin a temper?

228
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,660
In this world,

229
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,340
there is nothing to think about.

230
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,540
Do you think Prince Qin,

231
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:29,700
who is a dangerous and ruthless enemy,

232
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,620
hasn't realized it?

233
00:13:32,220 --> 00:13:33,420
Don't talk nonsense.

234
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,100
Say it.

235
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:35,540
Don't listen to him.

236
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,780
I'm not talking nonsense.

237
00:13:37,940 --> 00:13:38,540
There must be someone who is

238
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,860
a pervert.

239
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,140
Don't think nonsense.

240
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:43,500
Mr. Shiqi,

241
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:44,780
Miss Gu wants to see you.

242
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,220
Your Highness.

243
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:55,500
Your Highness.

244
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,060
Miss Gu, you're welcome.

245
00:14:04,060 --> 00:14:04,700
Grandma.

246
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:06,540
Grandma.

247
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:07,060
Yes.

248
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,180
Shiqi.

249
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:15,140
You've grown up.

250
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:20,300
The little wolf king

251
00:14:21,220 --> 00:14:23,460
has become Prince Qin.

252
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,980
When I arrived in the capital,

253
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,300
I heard that

254
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:29,780
everyone in the city was praising Prince Qin.

255
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:32,380
They said that Prince Qin was so dangerous.

256
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,980
Every little girl

257
00:14:33,980 --> 00:14:35,780
wanted to marry Prince Qin.

258
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,500
Good.

259
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,900
Grandma.

260
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:39,340
Why are you here?

261
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:44,220
I've been living in the countryside for many years.

262
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:46,500
I'm not in good health.

263
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,140
No one sent me to the city.

264
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:50,740
This time,

265
00:14:51,020 --> 00:14:52,820
it's thanks to Miss Gu

266
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:55,380
that I was able to find me.

267
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,940
I'm curious to see if I can come to see you.

268
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,580
I'm happy.

269
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:07,940
I'm so happy

270
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:09,820
that I'm able to see you.

271
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:13,700
I'm so happy.

272
00:15:15,060 --> 00:15:17,060
I'm willing to.

273
00:15:17,060 --> 00:15:17,820
Grandma.

274
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,500
Don't say such a thing.

275
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,820
I'm happy.

276
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,020
I'm happy.

277
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:25,260
Grandma.

278
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:26,820
Since you're here,

279
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:27,940
stay here.

280
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,420
Prince Qin is very rich.

281
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:31,420
You can live here.

282
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,380
Okay.

283
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:34,060
Okay.

284
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,460
Grandma.

285
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,260
You've grown up.

286
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,660
You've grown up.

287
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:44,260
Your Highness.

288
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,420
The old man is used to the martial arts.

289
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,340
I've just served him.

290
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,700
Don't worry, Your Highness.

291
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,220
Thank you, Miss Gu.

292
00:15:52,940 --> 00:15:54,020
Maybe it's a small matter.

293
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,140
It's not a big deal.

294
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,100
Your Highness is very generous.

295
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:01,100
I've sent someone to let him go.

296
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,420
But it's always unfair.

297
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:05,500
I thought

298
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,420
I'd never see his old man again.

299
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:12,580
Your Highness' biological son is very unfilial.

300
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,300
I didn't give her any inspiration.

301
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,900
But Li Zheng raised to have her in charge of it.

302
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:20,420
And you've beenstepping away

303
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:20,500
from mom's will.

304
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:22,300
Thus, I've bought Creation Sky

305
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,060
with your name in it.

306
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:25,340
My name stands out on the map.

307
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,380
In this way,

308
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,020
it would be sufficient

309
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:30,180
to live in our old man's residence

310
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,620
if he doesn't like to live in our home.

311
00:16:31,620 --> 00:16:32,460
It's not enough.

312
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,660
Miss Gu,

313
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:38,140
you're a kind and kind person.

314
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:39,180
Thank you.

315
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:42,580
By the way,

316
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,580
I'll send the cold silver

317
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,700
to the manor later.

318
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:48,620
You're welcome.

319
00:16:50,340 --> 00:16:52,700
I'm stupid and honest.

320
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:55,300
I'm not loved by my parents.

321
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:57,140
So, if someone

322
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,180
treats me well,

323
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,660
I'll be very grateful.

324
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,180
Your Highness, you're my only savior.

325
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:03,580
I'm glad

326
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:05,140
that you're so kind.

327
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,020
I just want to do

328
00:17:07,220 --> 00:17:08,540
some good things

329
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:10,540
and wish you a long life.

330
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,820
I'm very happy.

331
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,180
Thank you.

332
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,740
The courtiers have advised me

333
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:23,300
to reward Cui Yi.

334
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,700
And I'm going to

335
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,340
make them feel better.

336
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:31,100
He's been in the Pingliang and Weiyang's mansion.

337
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,900
How can I reward him?

338
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,260
Besides,

339
00:17:34,460 --> 00:17:36,020
he doesn't have a son.

340
00:17:36,260 --> 00:17:38,660
What can I do?

341
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,340
I can make them feel better.

342
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,140
Father,

343
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,780
I have an idea.

344
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:50,460
Tell me.

345
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,900
I heard that Cui Yi

346
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,020
has only one daughter.

347
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,140
And she grew up in the army.

348
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,780
She's not a man.

349
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,340
I'm not married yet.

350
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,100
Why don't you marry me

351
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,180
Cui's daughter?

352
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:04,980
In that case,

353
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:05,860
Cui's daughter

354
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:07,620
will be the son-in-law of Father.

355
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:09,300
And Cui Yi will be

356
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,460
my father-in-law.

357
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:11,540
Even if he

358
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:12,780
leaves the capital,

359
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:13,860
it's possible.

360
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,220
Good.

361
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,300
That's a good idea.

362
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,340
Very good.

363
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,740
You have a little care.

364
00:18:28,700 --> 00:18:29,260
Father,

365
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:30,280
why didn't you confirm

366
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,020
it?

367
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,980
It's natural to think it's a菓 explanations.

368
00:18:36,100 --> 00:18:37,300
I thought so.

369
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:38,860
It's natural.

370
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:39,820
It's natural.

371
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,140
My son comes early every day.

372
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:41,740
He told me

373
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:42,200
he wanted to know

374
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:42,580
if there's anyone

375
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:44,980
who can help Cui's daughter.

376
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:46,780
Leave him in that care.

377
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:47,900
That'll be enough to

378
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:50,020
turn Cui's daughter down.

379
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,340
Father,

380
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,380
I don't think

381
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:55,180
Cui's daughter

382
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,180
Don't worry, father.

383
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:57,580
No matter how good or bad

384
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,580
the daughter of Cui is,

385
00:18:59,740 --> 00:19:01,140
I'm willing to marry her

386
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,380
and treat her well.

387
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,580
From now on,

388
00:19:03,580 --> 00:19:05,860
Cui's family will be loyal to you.

389
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,900
My son,

390
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:15,860
you're the most considerate of the whole court.

391
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:17,580
But don't worry.

392
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,100
After father's death,

393
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,700
you'll be a concubine

394
00:19:21,060 --> 00:19:22,180
and a concubine.

395
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,100
I won't let you be so vain.

396
00:19:24,340 --> 00:19:25,860
It's such a great grievance.

397
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,460
Don't worry.

398
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,100
Father, have some tea.

399
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,100
Okay.

400
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,780
You mean

401
00:19:37,100 --> 00:19:38,420
the court has invited people

402
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,460
to marry me?

403
00:19:41,780 --> 00:19:43,420
I'm here to eat the meat of heaven.

404
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,740
I want to marry my daughter

405
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,300
for what?

406
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,540
The emperor is really a traitor.

407
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
The two of them

408
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:51,620
are the same.

409
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:53,140
They don't know the emperor's power.

410
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:56,900
The emperor's power?

411
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,060
Okay.

412
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,780
Without discussion.

413
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,660
There won't be a rational marriage.

414
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:05,860
Father,

415
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,700
I'm just thinking

416
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:10,500
since we're someone like that in the court,

417
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:19,780
we'd rather

418
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,940
nominateล

419
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,260
I want to marry the prince.

420
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,140
Yes.

421
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,900
But I have to follow my will.

422
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,620
I have to marry the prince myself.

423
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,060
That Li Ni is so ungrateful.

424
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,500
Do you want to marry him?

425
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,260
I don't want to marry him.

426
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,940
But since the court has already

427
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,260
thought of our family,

428
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,540
why don't we talk about

429
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:42,300
the future?

430
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,820
You mean...

431
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:46,940
As long as I say

432
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,220
I will marry the prince

433
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,980
there will be a great joy.

434
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:53,860
I don't know

435
00:20:54,180 --> 00:20:55,100
what kind of things

436
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:56,180
Li Ni and his brothers will do.

437
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,140
I want to see

438
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:00,020
how they can be ignorant.

439
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,180
I also want to see

440
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:04,140
what kind of reaction Li Ni will have.

441
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,220
Ying,

442
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,220
this is your big deal.

443
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:08,820
Don't be angry.

444
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:10,140
Father,

445
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,700
I am not angry.

446
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,220
Now,

447
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,900
we have a strong army

448
00:21:15,060 --> 00:21:15,700
in the imperial court

449
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:18,220
with a good quality and good quality.

450
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,100
There has been a long time

451
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,660
that we are a piece of fat meat.

452
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,340
Everyone wants to take a bite.

453
00:21:24,380 --> 00:21:25,180
Since that's the case,

454
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:27,340
why don't we take a break

455
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,820
and let them

456
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,900
break their own blood?

457
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,820
You should think about it.

458
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,060
Once we put the memorial on the ground,

459
00:21:38,620 --> 00:21:39,820
your future husband

460
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:42,140
can only be chosen by three princes.

461
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,540
The palace has no way back.

462
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,540
What will be the final result?

463
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:49,340
It may not be as good as we wish.

464
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:53,060
Father,

465
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,300
I have thought

466
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,100
about the power and relationship.

467
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:59,340
The world is like a game.

468
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:01,140
The world

469
00:22:01,540 --> 00:22:02,860
is the biggest game.

470
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:05,300
I want to be the one who plays chess.

471
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:09,100
I have too many feelings for the king.

472
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,180
I have no intention of being the king.

473
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,780
I used to have a long talk with him.

474
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,460
But I have a lot of feelings for him.

475
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:18,700
Since he is a chess player,

476
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,300
even if I force him,

477
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,500
I will force him to be another person who plays chess.

478
00:22:24,660 --> 00:22:25,220
Father,

479
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,220
I want to bet on this.

480
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:31,380
Your Majesty,

481
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,100
so in the memorial,

482
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,940
it's your intention

483
00:22:36,180 --> 00:22:38,580
to give the daughter to the king of chess?

484
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:39,980
Is that true?

485
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:45,380
I did send someone to ask.

486
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,940
Your Majesty's intention is to win.

487
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:49,860
But he is a minister.

488
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,500
He is so insincere.

489
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:53,260
He wants to be the king of the royal family

490
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,740
and be the king of the royal family.

491
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:57,220
He is a court official.

492
00:22:57,820 --> 00:22:59,780
Please give him a good reason

493
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,220
to be the king of the royal family.

494
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,220
That's right.

495
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:04,980
This is really

496
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:07,220
a waste of time.

497
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:09,420
He thinks that the king is a talent.

498
00:23:09,740 --> 00:23:11,100
He can choose whatever he wants.

499
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:14,820
Your Majesty,

500
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:17,940
I have made Pingliang and Weiyang's house.

501
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:19,660
I have a lot of strategies.

502
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:20,780
I am worried about him

503
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:22,900
in the court.

504
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:24,580
No one is willing to do that.

505
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:26,180
Your Majesty,

506
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:29,300
you choose the daughter of the royal family.

507
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:32,900
Now, I just want to

508
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,740
be the king of the royal family.

509
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,660
Your Majesty, you are not like a Englishman.

510
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,460
If you don't want to be a soldier,

511
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,940
you can take the daughter of the royal family.

512
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,380
That's so wise.

513
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,580
I

514
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,060
think this is a good idea.

515
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:56,860
But his son wants to marry his daughter.

516
00:23:57,140 --> 00:24:00,100
That's the glory of the royal family.

517
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,020
How can he choose

518
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,660
the one who can be the king of the royal family?

519
00:24:04,420 --> 00:24:05,940
You are right.

520
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
I am not like that.

521
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,860
How can you be the queen of the royal family?

522
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,980
I am not like that.

523
00:24:10,980 --> 00:24:12,100
Your Majesty is a princess.

524
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,260
She is broad-minded.

525
00:24:13,260 --> 00:24:14,420
She is capable of the world.

526
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:15,540
I think

527
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,740
His Majesty can be a great emperor.

528
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,380
The late emperor and the late minister are the best.

529
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:24,660
If I choose the one who can be the king of the royal family,

530
00:24:24,660 --> 00:24:26,060
You are making a fool of yourself.

531
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:28,700
You are making a fool of yourself.

532
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,540
You are right.

533
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,820
You are right.

534
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,820
You are right.

535
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,820
You are right.

536
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:34,580
You are right.

537
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,700
You are right.

538
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,860
You are right.

539
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:42,220
Thank you, sister-in-law.

540
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,540
You are welcome.

541
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:45,140
You two can have a rest.

542
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,500
You are really a good sister-in-law.

543
00:24:54,660 --> 00:24:56,180
I am envious of you.

544
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,220
You are in my house now.

545
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:00,940
What's the point?

546
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,020
Brother, you must help me this time.

547
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:07,740
Cui Yi said you should be responsible for my and Li Ni's divorce.

548
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,620
Cui Yi said you should be responsible for the prince's divorce.

549
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,620
I think Brother has married the princess.

550
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:18,660
I think Miss Cui is unwilling to marry her and be a concubine.

551
00:25:18,660 --> 00:25:20,020
That's why I think

552
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,660
if Brother can help me,

553
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,540
if I can get the help of Cui's family,

554
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:27,820
I will help Brother to enter the Eastern Palace.

555
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,780
How is Brother?

556
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:38,540
Second brother is right.

557
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,580
Miss Cui

558
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:44,860
must marry Li Ni.

559
00:25:45,540 --> 00:25:47,380
Thank you, brother.

560
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:54,660
Miss Cui,

561
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,820
I am in charge of the house and the land.

562
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:57,900
I am in charge of the house and the land.

563
00:25:58,980 --> 00:25:59,980
Tell me.

564
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:02,860
His Majesty is marrying Miss Cui to the prince.

565
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:04,340
She is smart.

566
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,420
She is willing to marry him.

567
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:08,780
You should choose one of the prince.

568
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:10,260
Isn't that clear?

569
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:12,300
She is marrying our 17th prince.

570
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,700
That's right.

571
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,300
17th prince,

572
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,580
you should tell her.

573
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,660
You have to tell her.

574
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,860
Yes.

575
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,140
She just said she would choose one of the prince.

576
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,260
She didn't say it was me.

577
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:26,540
Don't be stubborn.

578
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:28,060
She is a girl.

579
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:30,580
She should be named Daoxin and say she will marry you.

580
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,460
If she doesn't want to marry you, who will she marry?

581
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:32,980
That's right.

582
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:34,420
If she doesn't want to marry you,

583
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:36,380
why would she go to the library?

584
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,380
That's right.

585
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,340
That's right.

586
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:39,460
She will marry Miss Cui.

587
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,780
She will be beautiful.

588
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,860
Right?

589
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,060
Although Miss Cui is a good girl,

590
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:45,540
she is a good girl.

591
00:26:45,540 --> 00:26:46,420
Right?

592
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:49,820
But she is Cui's only daughter.

593
00:26:49,820 --> 00:26:51,420
In the future,

594
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:53,620
she will be in charge of her husband and wife.

595
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:54,620
Let's say

596
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:58,020
she can let the prince marry her.

597
00:26:58,020 --> 00:26:58,980
She can't.

598
00:26:58,980 --> 00:26:59,580
Right.

599
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,420
She can't.

600
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,460
But, brothers,

601
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,340
what is the most important thing?

602
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,940
Miss Cui

603
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:10,500
is very affectionate to our 17th prince.

604
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,100
I think she speaks very well.

605
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,140
Xiaoduo,

606
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,140
are you happy now?

607
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,740
Miss Cui married our 17th prince.

608
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:20,780
Miss Taozi

609
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:23,020
will come to our mansion.

610
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:25,420
If you don't want to marry her,

611
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,020
you can't marry her.

612
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:28,420
You are so mean.

613
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:29,900
You are so mean.

614
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:31,620
You are so mean.

615
00:27:32,620 --> 00:27:33,620
Shiqilao.

616
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,220
Right.

617
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,740
Miss Cui is so pretentious.

618
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,220
She has to have 300 taels of taels.

619
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,020
No.

620
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:38,220
Right.

621
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:40,420
We can't have less taels.

622
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
Right.

623
00:27:44,420 --> 00:27:45,900
The rules in our village

624
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,620
have to have a group of banquet.

625
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,620
It's the groom's birthday party.

626
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,020
Otherwise,

627
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,900
brothers,

628
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:53,620
we will go to the banquet with you.

629
00:27:53,620 --> 00:27:54,420
Right.

630
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:56,220
If Shiqilao didn't have a birthday party,

631
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,420
the groom asked us to do it.

632
00:27:57,420 --> 00:27:58,020
Is that okay?

633
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,020
Of course not.

634
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
Didn't you say

635
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:02,220
that the groom will celebrate the birthday party?

636
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,420
Of course.

637
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,220
We are brothers of the 17th prince.

638
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,220
We are family.

639
00:28:06,220 --> 00:28:07,620
Why don't we count the family?

640
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,420
We can't.

641
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,220
We can.

642
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,020
We can't.

643
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:10,820
We can't.

644
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:11,420
We can't.

645
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,220
We can't.

646
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,220
We can't.

647
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:13,820
We can't.

648
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:14,820
Stop it.

649
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,420
Shiqilao.

650
00:28:16,420 --> 00:28:17,820
I said we can't.

651
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:18,420
Shiqilao.

652
00:28:18,420 --> 00:28:19,420
Shiqilao, don't go.

653
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,420
How about it?

654
00:28:20,420 --> 00:28:21,420
When will we go to the banquet?

655
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:23,020
We are ready to go to the banquet.

656
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,820
Master.

657
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,420
Master.

658
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,420
You said

659
00:28:39,020 --> 00:28:41,020
what does

660
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:46,020
Ying mean by this memorial?

661
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,820
Probably,

662
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,820
he doesn't want to marry Prince Qi.

663
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,820
So, he went to Wanyan.

664
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,620
Because he only wants to marry Li Ni.

665
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,020
Li Ni?

666
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,020
Li Ni?

667
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,020
Li Ni?

668
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:02,020
Why did Ying do this to me?

669
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,020
I am so heartless to him.

670
00:29:08,020 --> 00:29:10,020
He can't see me at all.

671
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,020
Master.

672
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,020
Xiao Wei is actually...

673
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,020
He must be the soldier I came in to say goodbye to.

674
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:19,020
That's why he hates me.

675
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,020
He hates you.

676
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:28,020
He hates you.

677
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:31,020
Anyway, as long as I am with him,

678
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,020
I will slowly persuade him.

679
00:29:35,020 --> 00:29:38,020
He will change his mind sooner or later.

680
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,020
I will go to the place

681
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:51,020
where I will go to the mountain.

682
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,020
Ying will definitely like it.

683
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,020
I will be there with him.

684
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,020
I will spend my life with him.

685
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
Have you prepared

686
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:09,020
the dessert that Ying likes?

687
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:16,020
If I go there with Ying,

688
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,020
no one will bother me

689
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:20,020
with Ying.

690
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,460
He knows Ying's behavior

691
00:30:29,020 --> 00:30:30,020
so he caused everything

692
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:31,020
and once he sees her,

693
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,020
lotless people will start having happy ending.

694
00:30:35,020 --> 00:30:36,120
Her см Clever smartphones

695
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,620
And Liao Jinlin

696
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:42,920
and other silhouetteners.

697
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,620
What do you want to buy?

698
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,020
Cold cookie?

699
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:54,420
It's not easy.

700
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:57,980
No matter how you two fought before,

701
00:30:58,380 --> 00:31:01,660
you must be good at this meeting.

702
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,380
Get her back home.

703
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,900
Shi Xi Lang, what's wrong?

704
00:31:13,540 --> 00:31:14,540
If she chooses me,

705
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:15,980
she won't force me.

706
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:18,140
Since she's wronged,

707
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,340
I'm afraid she's not.

708
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:23,980
I don't.

709
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,420
Youoyuan is still so beautiful.

710
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,260
Ying,

711
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,100
Your Majesty,

712
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,980
let us think about it.

713
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:56,820
He's injured with a stroke.

714
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,180
I thought

715
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:01,660
you didn't want to marry Prince Qi

716
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,620
to get the stroke.

717
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:07,140
Things are like they used to be.

718
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,620
No one can be more than one.

719
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,580
Only my daughter

720
00:32:14,620 --> 00:32:16,060
can make people suffer.

721
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,060
Are you willing to marry me?

722
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:23,460
I'm willing.

723
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,740
Could

724
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:26,740
your two brothers

725
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:28,300
beat Prince Qi?

726
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:31,660
I said

727
00:32:32,860 --> 00:32:34,340
I had no objection at the palace of Du' laws.

728
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,540
I would find his advice

729
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,060
and ask the crown皇檀

730
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:38,780
to go out.

731
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:40,260
They won't have any hopes for me.

732
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:42,460
You think your two brothers

733
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,260
were the same eon who only knew

734
00:32:44,660 --> 00:32:46,340
that you're concerned about Li訂閱?

735
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,260
Never!

736
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:49,300
Everthing yang I've heard

737
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,620
were concerned with Li study one.

738
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,660
will the two brothers

739
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,980
let the grand son be the crown prince?

740
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:55,180
If the grand son

741
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,340
enters the Eastern Palace,

742
00:32:56,900 --> 00:32:58,420
will he live for a year and a half?

743
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,340
If I'm there,

744
00:33:00,140 --> 00:33:00,900
I'll make sure

745
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:01,900
the grand son is safe in the Eastern Palace.

746
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:02,940
Even if you can

747
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:04,420
protect the grand son everywhere in the court,

748
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,580
can you keep it a secret

749
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:06,780
and have no doubt?

750
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,700
You're the King of Qin

751
00:33:08,700 --> 00:33:09,900
and you have the military power.

752
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:11,860
By then, your two brothers

753
00:33:11,860 --> 00:33:12,900
will thank you and the grand son

754
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:13,940
for colluding with the imperial court.

755
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,140
How can you change?

756
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,020
Are you going to be the military power

757
00:33:17,020 --> 00:33:18,220
just for the sake of the Qing Dynasty?

758
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,340
Then who will protect the grand son?

759
00:33:21,540 --> 00:33:23,740
Even if you can bring the grand son back to the prison,

760
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:25,380
your father who is confused

761
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,140
will be punished

762
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:28,060
by you

763
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,540
after he is locked up.

764
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,580
When you enter the capital,

765
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,420
how can you protect the grand son?

766
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:37,060
Shi Qilang,

767
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:38,380
I've already

768
00:33:38,380 --> 00:33:40,140
planned this place for you.

769
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:41,300
It's a dead end.

770
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:43,180
Only you can enter the Eastern Palace

771
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:44,940
and live a life.

772
00:33:51,460 --> 00:33:51,940
Fine.

773
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,540
I don't believe

774
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:55,460
this is my only choice.

775
00:33:59,380 --> 00:33:59,660
Can you not

776
00:33:59,660 --> 00:34:01,540
give up your will to they?

777
00:34:08,140 --> 00:34:09,300
After some time,

778
00:34:09,620 --> 00:34:10,420
Your Highness

779
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,460
might find out

780
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,740
our complicated and

781
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:16,340
dangerous spies.

782
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,660
This man..

783
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:23,100
You asked me to come today

784
00:34:23,580 --> 00:34:24,540
to tell me the truth

785
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,580
Not bad

786
00:34:28,740 --> 00:34:29,820
Do you love me

787
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,380
One day

788
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:45,620
I met someone

789
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:49,340
He's very capable and smart.

790
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,340
I've never met someone like him.

791
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:56,340
Although we met for the first time,

792
00:34:56,740 --> 00:34:57,940
we were very close.

793
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:00,140
When we met again,

794
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,340
I took him to the police.

795
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,140
But at that time,

796
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:07,140
I knew

797
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,340
I liked him.

798
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:14,940
Although

799
00:35:15,740 --> 00:35:17,740
I've never liked anyone.

800
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:22,140
I don't know what the meaning of liking someone.

801
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,340
But I'm sure

802
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,140
I like him.

803
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:30,940
Whether he's the Shi Qi Lang of Lengguan

804
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,140
or the Prince of Qin,

805
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:36,140
whether he's the rebel,

806
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:38,540
or the Crown Prince of Royal Descendant,

807
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:42,740
I just like him.

808
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:47,140
I like him too.

809
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,340
But why can't he marry me?

810
00:35:56,340 --> 00:35:57,140
Your Highness, go back.

811
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,340
Maybe you'll understand

812
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:01,740
after some time.

813
00:36:02,340 --> 00:36:04,940
If not because of the Shi Qi Lang of Lengguan,

814
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,940
then you can't be the Shi Qi Lang.

815
00:36:09,140 --> 00:36:10,340
You can't be the Shi Qi Lang.

816
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,340
You can't be the Shi Qi Lang.

817
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,740
You can go back to the Lengguan

818
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:17,940
and be the Shi Qi Lang.

819
00:36:18,740 --> 00:36:20,140
But Prince of Qin

820
00:36:20,740 --> 00:36:22,540
can't be the Crown Prince of the East Palace.

821
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:33,340
If I don't be the Crown Prince,

822
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,340
won't you marry me?

823
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:44,140
If I say yes,

824
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:49,740
will you feel better?

825
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:00,940
If the Shi Qi Lang marries Miss Cui,

826
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:02,740
she'll stay in the capital.

827
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:06,140
You should stay in the capital with her.

828
00:37:07,940 --> 00:37:09,540
That's not certain.

829
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,540
That's not certain.

830
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:13,340
Why not?

831
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:15,140
Miss Cui will stay in the capital.

832
00:37:15,340 --> 00:37:16,140
Where else can you go?

833
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:20,340
Maybe our General

834
00:37:20,340 --> 00:37:22,740
won't marry you.

835
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:24,140
That's impossible.

836
00:37:24,940 --> 00:37:26,740
You general have already made a move.

837
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:29,340
You can choose a prince.

838
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,740
It's obvious

839
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,340
that she'll choose Shi Qi Lang

840
00:37:32,540 --> 00:37:33,540
to be the husband and wife.

841
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:35,940
And they've made a promise to meet today.

842
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:37,740
It's to discuss the marriage.

843
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:41,140
That's weird.

844
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:43,140
Our Miss Cui and Prince of Qin

845
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,340
are discussing the marriage.

846
00:37:44,940 --> 00:37:46,740
What does it have to do with us?

847
00:37:52,540 --> 00:37:53,140
Tao Zi.

848
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:53,940
What?

849
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:54,740
I like you.

850
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,540
I want to be with you forever.

851
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:57,340
You...

852
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,140
Are you willing to?

853
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:05,340
My mom?

854
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,140
What's wrong?

855
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:09,940
Your Prince of Qin

856
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,140
suddenly left the horse.

857
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:12,940
Where's Miss Cui?

858
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,140
If I forget to leave the firefly,

859
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:46,540
I'll wait for the memories to die.

860
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:47,340
Miss Cui.

861
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,540
What did you just say to Prince of Qin?

862
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:51,340
Why did you suddenly leave the horse?

863
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:55,540
What do you mean?

864
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,540
He's looking for you to discuss the marriage.

865
00:38:57,940 --> 00:38:58,540
What's wrong?

866
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:00,740
Is he not willing to marry you?

867
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:04,340
He's just unwilling to be the crown prince.

868
00:39:04,940 --> 00:39:06,140
But he doesn't understand.

869
00:39:06,940 --> 00:39:08,340
If he doesn't be the crown prince,

870
00:39:08,740 --> 00:39:11,340
he might not even be able to keep his life.

871
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,540
How can he marry me?

872
00:39:14,340 --> 00:39:15,940
What's wrong with him?

873
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:17,340
He likes you so much.

874
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,140
He can't even kill himself.

875
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:20,340
Is...

876
00:39:20,540 --> 00:39:22,140
Can't he let him be the crown prince?

877
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:23,340
Is it harder to kill him?

878
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:35,940
Look.

879
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:38,340
It's raining at 4 o'clock.

880
00:39:39,340 --> 00:39:40,340
It's going to be dark.

881
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:42,340
It's raining again.

882
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,340
How simple

883
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:47,340
is the one who's going to walk?

884
00:39:50,340 --> 00:39:52,340
I'm going to walk with you.

885
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,340
I'm going to walk with you.

886
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,340
I'm going to walk with you.

887
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:03,340
I'm going to walk with you.

888
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:12,340
Waiting for my order.

889
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:20,340
If love is a promise I'll give you,

890
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:27,340
I'll give you a promise.

891
00:40:29,340 --> 00:40:31,340
Isn't that Prince Qin?

892
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,340
He's such a big sister-in-law.

893
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,340
How did he eat it from the outside?

894
00:40:39,340 --> 00:40:42,340
It looks like he's just lost his mind.

895
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:45,340
I wonder what happened.

896
00:40:54,340 --> 00:40:55,340
Your Highness.

897
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,340
Your Highness.

898
00:40:58,340 --> 00:40:59,340
Something happened to Prince Qin.

899
00:40:59,340 --> 00:41:00,340
What's wrong?

900
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,340
Prince Qin was out last night.

901
00:41:02,340 --> 00:41:04,340
He's gone.

902
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,340
What?

903
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,340
It's true.

904
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:10,340
The new emperor.

905
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:14,340
No wonder Prince Qin was out.

906
00:41:14,340 --> 00:41:16,340
I couldn't believe all the girls in the palace

907
00:41:16,340 --> 00:41:19,340
didn't run away and all of them were dead.

908
00:41:19,340 --> 00:41:21,340
Someone was trying to kill him.

909
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:23,340
We were in the palace.

910
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:25,340
We were out of the palace.

911
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,340
We thought it was strange.

912
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:28,340
We wasted a lot of time.

913
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,340
But we found out that

914
00:41:29,340 --> 00:41:32,340
the princess' yard was a bit wrong.

915
00:41:32,340 --> 00:41:34,340
The old man was lying there.

916
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:37,340
He must have been in the palace on purpose.

917
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:38,340
He didn't sleep outside.

918
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,340
But I don't know who did it.

919
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
I didn't expect that

920
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,340
the new emperor's house

921
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,340
was burned to ashes.

922
00:41:46,340 --> 00:41:48,340
The princess and the housekeeper

923
00:41:48,340 --> 00:41:50,340
were all alone.

924
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,340
It's not right.

925
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,340
What's wrong?

926
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,340
The housekeeper has rules.

927
00:41:56,340 --> 00:41:57,340
The new emperor's house

928
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,340
was built by the old man's housekeeper.

929
00:42:00,340 --> 00:42:02,340
The two houses were used by Jin Si Nan Mu.

930
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,340
The wood quality is very good.

931
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:08,340
Even Jin Si Nan Mu was burnt to ashes.

932
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,340
The brick next to the yard

933
00:42:10,340 --> 00:42:12,340
was not black at all.

934
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:16,340
It rained last night.

935
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,340
The new emperor's house was in a hurry.

936
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:21,340
It was all wrong.

937
00:42:21,340 --> 00:42:22,340
It was all wrong.

938
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,340
Shi Qi Lang.

939
00:42:25,340 --> 00:42:27,340
What do you mean?

940
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:29,340
It must be a fire.

941
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,340
Or it was a firecracker.

942
00:42:30,340 --> 00:42:32,340
Or it was a firecracker.

943
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:34,340
Otherwise, it wouldn't have been so long.

944
00:42:34,340 --> 00:42:35,340
Even Jin Si Nan Mu

945
00:42:35,340 --> 00:42:37,340
was burnt to ashes.

946
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:46,340
Since it was a firecracker,

947
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:49,340
the death of the sister-in-law

948
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:51,340
was a cause.

949
00:42:52,340 --> 00:42:55,340
It could be a fire in the back yard of the princess.

950
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:57,340
It could be a firecracker.

951
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,340
It was a coincidence.

952
00:42:58,340 --> 00:42:59,340
I asked the big brother

953
00:42:59,340 --> 00:43:02,340
to get me a wife to marry her.

954
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:04,340
Who else could it be?

955
00:43:06,340 --> 00:43:07,340
Your Highness said

956
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:10,340
it was the king's order.

957
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,340
My big brother

958
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,340
dared to burn his own wife to death.

959
00:43:14,340 --> 00:43:15,340
He was obviously

960
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,340
here to promote the imperial letter.

961
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:19,340
In that case,

962
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:20,340
he must have wanted to

963
00:43:20,340 --> 00:43:32,300
fight for the daughter of the

964
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:33,340
Cui family.

965
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:34,340
If father knew,

966
00:43:34,340 --> 00:43:35,340
he wouldn't have

967
00:43:35,340 --> 00:43:36,340
asked for the daughter of the Cui family.

968
00:43:36,340 --> 00:43:37,340
He would have been more generous.

969
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:38,340
Your Highness is wise.

970
00:43:44,340 --> 00:43:45,340
I believe that in two days,

971
00:43:45,340 --> 00:43:46,340
the three brothers

972
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:47,340
will also be suspicious of this.

973
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:50,340
I must help

974
00:43:50,340 --> 00:43:52,340
my brother.

975
00:43:52,340 --> 00:43:53,340
After all, he loves

976
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:54,340
his sister-in-law the most.

977
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,340
He loves her the most.

978
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,340
If he knew

979
00:43:57,340 --> 00:43:58,340
that his brother had hurt her,

980
00:43:58,340 --> 00:43:59,340
he would have killed her.

981
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:00,340
He would have investigated

982
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,340
the truth.

983
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,340
My brother

984
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:04,340
would have been killed.

985
00:44:05,340 --> 00:44:07,340
The king of the letter is so cruel.

986
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,340
Do you think

987
00:44:09,340 --> 00:44:10,340
it's the king's hand?

988
00:44:11,340 --> 00:44:13,340
Who else could it be?

989
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,340
I didn't expect

990
00:44:15,340 --> 00:44:18,340
he would kill his wife.

991
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,340
That's a good thing.

992
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:22,340
He is a man of wealth.

993
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:24,340
He is a man of wealth.

994
00:44:24,340 --> 00:44:26,340
Even if he kills his wife,

995
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:29,340
it's not a big deal.

996
00:44:32,340 --> 00:44:33,340
Father.

997
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,340
I want to go to the Western Changjing.

998
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:38,340
Why do you want to go there?

999
00:44:39,340 --> 00:44:41,340
The king of the letter

1000
00:44:41,340 --> 00:44:42,340
wants to marry me.

1001
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:44,340
I must see

1002
00:44:45,340 --> 00:44:46,340
how he will

1003
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:48,340
think about this prince.

1004
00:44:51,340 --> 00:44:52,340
You should see

1005
00:44:53,340 --> 00:44:55,340
what the king of the letter will do.

1006
00:45:00,340 --> 00:45:01,340
My lady.

1007
00:45:01,340 --> 00:45:02,340
We are going to

1008
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:03,340
the king's mansion

1009
00:45:03,340 --> 00:45:04,340
to see my mother again.

1010
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:05,340
So,

1011
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,340
I have to keep my daughter

1012
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:08,340
from the prince.

1013
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,340
This book

1014
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,340
is very ancient.

1015
00:45:12,340 --> 00:45:13,340
Where is the ancient book?

1016
00:45:15,340 --> 00:45:16,340
I have seen

1017
00:45:16,340 --> 00:45:18,340
the original copy of this book.

1018
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,340
If you want to marry

1019
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:21,340
the prince,

1020
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,340
it's another mistake.

1021
00:45:25,340 --> 00:45:26,340
You can also

1022
00:45:26,340 --> 00:45:27,340
do something secretly.

1023
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:29,340
But not secretly.

1024
00:45:30,340 --> 00:45:31,340
If you don't want to

1025
00:45:31,340 --> 00:45:33,340
marry the prince,

1026
00:45:35,340 --> 00:45:36,340
there might be

1027
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:38,340
another plan.

1028
00:45:39,340 --> 00:45:40,340
So,

1029
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,340
you are going to

1030
00:45:41,340 --> 00:45:42,340
the prince's mansion today.

1031
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:44,340
I saw the prince

1032
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,340
in the capital

1033
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,340
and it seems that

1034
00:45:46,340 --> 00:45:47,340
he has been in the dark.

1035
00:45:49,340 --> 00:45:50,340
He is a person

1036
00:45:50,340 --> 00:45:51,340
who is a person who is a person of the world.

1037
00:45:52,340 --> 00:45:53,340
He has never

1038
00:45:53,340 --> 00:45:54,340
ever had this kind of appearance.

1039
00:45:56,340 --> 00:45:57,340
I think

1040
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,340
he has encountered

1041
00:45:58,340 --> 00:45:59,340
a huge change.

1042
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:00,340
This change

1043
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:02,340
might be related to

1044
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:03,340
the book of the book of the Cui family.

1045
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:13,340
The book of the Cui family

1046
00:47:12,340 --> 00:47:14,340
I want to live for you.

1047
00:47:15,340 --> 00:47:17,340
I want to live for you.

1048
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,340
I want to live for you.

1049
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,340
I want to live for you.

1050
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:24,340
I want to live for you.

1051
00:47:25,340 --> 00:47:26,340
I want to live for you.

1052
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,340
I want to live for you.

1053
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:30,340
I want to live for you.

1054
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,340
I want to live for you.

1055
00:47:33,340 --> 00:47:34,340
I want to live for you.

1056
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,340
I want to live for you.

1057
00:47:37,340 --> 00:47:38,340
I want to live for you.

1058
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,340
I want to live for you.

1059
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:41,340
I want to live for you.

1060
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:12,340
Love

1061
00:48:13,340 --> 00:48:17,340
I am willing to sing for you.

1062
00:48:17,340 --> 00:48:24,340
I will always wait for you to remember me.
