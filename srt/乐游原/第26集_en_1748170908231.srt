Episode 4

2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The King of the West

3
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Episode 17

4
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,000
I found out that the new mansion is not so different from the old one.

5
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
Especially the dishes, oil, sesame oil, dried wood, charcoal, etc.

6
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
There is no difference between the previous use.

7
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,000
And I also checked the accounts of the new mansion,

8
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
the oil shop, and the charcoal shop in Li Nian Li Yu.

9
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
I also checked the accounts of the kitchen and the kitchen

10
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and the kitchen to see if there is any difference

11
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
between the old one and the new one.

12
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
And I also checked the accounts of the new mansion,

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
the oil shop, and the charcoal shop in Li Nian Li Yu.

14
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
There is no difference between the kitchen and the charcoal shop.

15
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The professor didn't have the master's stuff.

16
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
How could it be like that?

17
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
This is so weird.

18
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Yes.

19
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I also checked the accounts of the new mansion.

20
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I didn't find any clues to find out.

21
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Shi Qi Lang.

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
What did Wan Niang bring you?

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Grandma, why are you here?

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You come next time and ask someone to call me.

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I'll go there.

26
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
I can still walk these paths.

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Wan Niang went to the Xiangji Temple

28
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:39,000
to ask for a new gold for the master's hand.

29
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,000
It is said that before the rank of the former master,

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,000
the most important thing is to be able to make a profit and distribute it.

31
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I came here today to ask you to pay the money to the Empress.

32
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Thank you.

33
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Grandma, let me help you check.

34
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Be careful not to burn your hands.

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What's wrong?

36
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I didn't keep the spirit just now.

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I accidentally burned a cave.

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
What should I do?

39
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
This is really my fault.

40
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
It's okay.

41
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's just a small hole.

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Miss Gu, don't blame yourself.

43
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This is the incense of Lady Liu.

44
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
It's all my fault.

45
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
Miss, since you burned a small hole,

46
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
you can just make it up.

47
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
You are so considerate.

48
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
The white rice cake was burnt by me last time.

49
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You embroidered a butterfly on it.

50
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
It's so beautiful.

51
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't see it at all.

52
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Your Highness, let me ask the portrait to make a good cloth.

53
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Shi Qi Lang,

54
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,000
take it off quickly.

55
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Let Wan Niang make a cloth here.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Miss Gu, please.

57
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Where did you say that?

58
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Wan Niang is just a cloth maker.

59
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Your Highness.

60
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
General Han, drink some medicine.

61
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Thank you, Your Highness.

62
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Is General Han's wound better?

63
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Much better.

64
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Actually,

65
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
since I saved you,

66
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I've felt that these wounds

67
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
have been healed.

68
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I didn't expect to see you again.

69
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
When I was in the forest,

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I thought that death would be a miracle.

71
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
I couldn't lose my face.

72
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I didn't expect to be saved.

73
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
After saving the grand grandson,

74
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
we ran away.

75
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Now, the Qin people are looking for

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
and telling Consort Xiao Fei.

77
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your Highness, let's stay here for a while.

78
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
The situation in the capital is complicated.

79
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,000
The Cui family is full of soldiers.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I'm like the grandson of the past.

81
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Your Majesty,

82
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
you may be too kind,

83
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
but you have a little man by your side.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Prince of Xing, Prince of Qi,

85
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
are all the sons of the Qin people.

86
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How will they treat you?

87
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:26,000
They are all dead.

88
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I want to know

89
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,000
why you are here.

90
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,000
I hope you can see me here.

91
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to know why you are here.

92
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
This place is a well-deserved place.

93
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:13,000
There are many children who live here every day.

94
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
We can't hide here.

95
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
No one will notice.

96
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
It's good here.

97
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I heard the teacher's voice the other day.

98
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I feel very relieved.

99
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I heard that you are here now.

100
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
That's why I know you are here.

101
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Your Highness likes reading.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
It's a good thing.

103
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
I want to study more and learn more.

104
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,000
Then I will feel happy when I see you.

105
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I'm taller than before.

106
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
I want to learn more than before.

107
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,000
You are here.

108
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
I'm not here.

109
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Why?

110
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm here for the sake of the King of Qin.

111
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
I'll go.

112
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Prince of Xing,

113
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:03,000
please stop.

114
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I'm here for the sake of the King of Qin.

115
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I'm here for the sake of the King of Qin.

116
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I'm here.

117
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:14,000
I'm here for the sake of the King of Qin.

118
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's all my fault.

119
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,400
and take it out and re-purchase it.

120
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:19,840
No wonder you asked me to get this kind of gold thread.

121
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,960
I didn't expect that a small piece

122
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
would be so heavy.

123
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,480
The gold thread that Si Yi took out

124
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:27,080
is a good gold thread.

125
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:28,720
Of course it's a good amount.

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,560
Speaking of which,

127
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:32,600
a few years ago, the late emperor ordered

128
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,880
that the people of the world should wear the embroidery gold thread.

129
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,920
The people of the world wouldn't dare to wear it.

130
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:40,400
So they put the gold thread on the silk.

131
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,600
These are not embroidery gold thread,

132
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,760
but the silk thread.

133
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,080
They're not wearing the thread.

134
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:47,880
The gold thread is still popular these years.

135
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,240
Your Highness.

136
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,360
You just said

137
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,920
the silk thread is the most fashionable.

138
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:03,480
Yes.

139
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,040
If many silk threads are put together,

140
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:10,280
it's like a dress of clothes.

141
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,240
Of course.

142
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,280
I heard that the silk thread in the capital

143
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,480
is worn by the high wall

144
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,600
outside the warehouse.

145
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,800
It's made of steel.

146
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,080
If the left and right sides of the capital are watered,

147
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,600
it's really a good thing.

148
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,880
They can't even take it back.

149
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:30,720
Your Highness, what's wrong?

150
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,640
You just said

151
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,560
the silk thread is in the capital.

152
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,080
It's all on the silk thread.

153
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:40,240
Yes.

154
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:42,880
Although it's just a thin layer of gold thread,

155
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,040
it's very beautiful

156
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
when it's put on the silk thread.

157
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:50,600
When the silk thread is caught on fire,

158
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,160
it will become a thread.

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,840
The silk thread is also the same.

160
00:09:56,360 --> 00:09:58,560
Your Highness, what are you thinking?

161
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:00,840
Nothing.

162
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,640
Miss Gu,

163
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,560
I suddenly remembered a important matter.

164
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,040
I have to talk to Pei Yuan.

165
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:07,600
I'll take my leave.

166
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,520
分享

167
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,320
Otherwise,

168
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,560
will you come back?

169
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,960
Prince Shixi,

170
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,960
there's worse

171
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,720
if you talk wrong about it ever again.

172
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,720
Let's go over

173
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,800
if Prince Xin has a set of

174
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:38,860
lobsters

175
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,260
to make the same mistake.

176
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:41,740
Make the same mistake?

177
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:42,980
And

178
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:46,380
check all the relatives

179
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,860
of Prince Xin.

180
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:50,700
See if there's any mistake.

181
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:52,220
Okay.

182
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:06,460
Sir.

183
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,460
The secret detective is here.

184
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:10,140
Xiao Wei only brought a bunch of people.

185
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,020
He's here in the West Capital.

186
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,580
He wants to go to the Qing Dynasty?

187
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,060
It doesn't look like him.

188
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:17,140
He's very slow.

189
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,140
It looks like

190
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,140
he's waiting for something.

191
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,180
He's waiting for Li Ni.

192
00:11:26,180 --> 00:11:27,420
He's been heartbroken.

193
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:30,220
I'm afraid Li Ni is going to let go.

194
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,140
Li Ni is really a fool.

195
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,140
I'm afraid he's going to let go.

196
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:38,340
I don't dare to tell Ying about it.

197
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:40,100
I want to marry you.

198
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:43,700
Prince Xin, Prince Qi.

199
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,780
What the hell is this?

200
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:47,940
I dare to think of Ying.

201
00:11:49,940 --> 00:11:50,500
Sir.

202
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,940
Do you want to teach them a lesson?

203
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,140
Don't worry about it.

204
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:57,460
Yes.

205
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,780
Ying came out of Luoyang

206
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:02,540
is a good thing.

207
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,260
At least he's out of the Cui family.

208
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:06,940
Otherwise,

209
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,220
we can't start.

210
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,220
They've sent people to follow Xiao Wei.

211
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:16,180
Choose a good time

212
00:12:16,580 --> 00:12:18,100
to sneak under the mud.

213
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,220
Don't let Cui Yi

214
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,060
find out easily.

215
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:22,940
I understand.

216
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:26,300
I've found out everything.

217
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,580
It's Prince Xin who killed Princess Consort.

218
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,220
Prince Xin thought he was the one.

219
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:32,860
He ordered people to put a lot of money in the drawer

220
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,060
and sent it to Princess Consort's room to light the fire.

221
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,740
And on the day she left,

222
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,540
they set fire on purpose.

223
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:40,620
One of them said

224
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,780
they put the medicine in Princess Consort's

225
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:44,220
and the food she gave her.

226
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,900
So no one came up that night.

227
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,300
They were all killed and killed.

228
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,060
Li Jun.

229
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:53,020
Li Jun.

230
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:57,100
How could he be so cruel?

231
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,100
And for the past years,

232
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,580
he has done quite a lot.

233
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,180
Despite all把握她

234
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,540
and doing nothing that can't be known over time,

235
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:10,420
he...

236
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,300
Nonetheless,

237
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:13,020
even if people do have

238
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,580
a stick of a single line,

239
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:17,660
he was still not there.

240
00:13:19,340 --> 00:13:20,940
We can say Prince Xin Hansheng

241
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,820
has a practicable motive.

242
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:25,980
Heavenanha!

243
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:28,580
Is it enough to punish him in front of His Majesty?

244
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:31,820
When Princess Dong was gone,

245
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:36,780
only he cared about me and protected me.

246
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,500
He died so far away.

247
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:44,260
I must make a contribution

248
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,700
in front of His Majesty.

249
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:53,700
Long live His Majesty!

250
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,420
Rise.

251
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,140
Thank you, Your Majesty.

252
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,180
Where's Prince Qin?

253
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,940
Your Majesty, Prince Qin said that there's an important military affairs.

254
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,500
He left the city early this morning.

255
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:15,180
He's afraid that the court will let me sue you.

256
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:19,260
He's always been a military man.

257
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,980
It seems that he has something to do alone.

258
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,060
Your Majesty,

259
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:28,620
I'll ask my daughter

260
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:44,500
to marry

261
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:48,500
Prince Qin and Prince Qin.

262
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:50,100
Your Majesty,

263
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,540
since Prince Qin was newly clean,

264
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,060
Prince Qin can be free to marry someone else.

265
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,580
I...

266
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,460
I'm right.

267
00:14:58,800 --> 00:14:59,960
Your Majesty,

268
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:02,760
Prince Consort Jing just approved of they can't serve for 10 days,

269
00:15:03,280 --> 00:15:06,800
and I'm nothing we 2nd-person kowtow to!

270
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,180
Prince will need

271
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,420
someone real one to serve him.

272
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:21,120
Howur içunting

273
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,360
Jonas Ch soaked up the Golden Demons,

274
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,880
and spied on all the chaos?

275
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,040
Your Highness.

276
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,000
The Prince Pそれは

277
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
together with the Turban Princess

278
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,560
is just like the Ebony Princess,

279
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:42,240
so it arouses endless intrigues

280
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,360
andopus in the Prince Yeperins�� room

281
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,080
to trap the Princess Treasures

282
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,240
and damage the water abyss.

283
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,200
It burns Princess Treasures

284
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,440
and fills the yard with her Alms.

285
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,000
You...

286
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,280
You're a traitor!

287
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,680
Lin Yi,

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,400
what nonsense are you talking about?

289
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,240
Your Majesty,

290
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:57,200
the human witness is supposed to be refused.

291
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,600
I left the city early today

292
00:15:58,600 --> 00:15:59,880
to investigate this matter.

293
00:16:00,640 --> 00:16:02,000
I've already arrested

294
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:03,440
the person who sent the grudge to the house

295
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,640
and the trusted family of Xia Mi Yao.

296
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:06,440
The trusted family of the family

297
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
has already sent the witness

298
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,440
to the Dali Temple.

299
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,040
Your Majesty,

300
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:14,760
you're a traitor!

301
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:15,760
I didn't...

302
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,040
I really didn't do this!

303
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,280
Father, please help me!

304
00:16:21,120 --> 00:16:23,080
Those witnesses are all from your family.

305
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,920
Many of them are from the royal family

306
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,400
and have always followed you.

307
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,600
Jun.

308
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
Jun!

309
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:38,400
Father,

310
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,040
Father,

311
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:39,640
I...

312
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,840
Why did you do this?

313
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,040
Why did you do this?

314
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
I'm a traitor!

315
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,400
Father,

316
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,720
please help me!

317
00:16:48,260 --> 00:16:49,200
Xie Wo n techniques

318
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:51,920
are like babies.

319
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,880
They do harm nowadays.

320
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:54,800
Father,

321
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,160
if I leave them,

322
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,040
I'll...

323
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:58,200
If they expensive those parties andこんな伏的人

324
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,280
to court you,

325
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,520
not to worry

326
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,640
that many were on your side,

327
00:17:01,840 --> 00:17:03,720
would you think my father is simply stupid?

328
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,760
Your Majesty,

329
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,440
This justifies the contempt and the demerit

330
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:23,260
and 혈

331
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:29,660
The

332
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,320
This

333
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,640
Drag the hind off

334
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,220
the

335
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,040
You can not leave

336
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,920
Let him die every night

337
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:51,240
and pray for Consort Mao.

338
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,680
And eliminate his debt.

339
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:59,320
Father! Father!

340
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,200
I didn't do it!

341
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,480
Do you want me to do it? I didn't do it!

342
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,800
Father! Father!

343
00:18:05,800 --> 00:18:08,240
Father! Father!

344
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,840
I didn't do it!

345
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,000
I didn't do it!

346
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,920
I want to do it!

347
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:17,720
Father! I didn't do it!

348
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:30,520
I never thought that a couple would be like this.

349
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:33,240
How could you do that to your sister-in-law?

350
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:37,240
We fought together, brothers fought for money.

351
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:39,800
We never saw each other in our hometown.

352
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,920
Who knows that in the capital,

353
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,280
someone would kill his own wife

354
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,880
for the sake of the regime.

355
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:48,760
It's not right.

356
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,760
When my sister-in-law just got married,

357
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,200
I was the least able to take her to the palace.

358
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:56,840
She knew that I was free and she was very nice to me.

359
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:59,360
A kind person like her,

360
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,720
she could do anything.

361
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:05,240
Before she came to the capital,

362
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,880
she thought that the capital was hot.

363
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,320
We've seen each other for years.

364
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,640
It's better not to come

365
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:13,760
to see each other for so many things.

366
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:23,840
Now I regret that

367
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,320
I was always in the same team.

368
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,240
At that time, our brothers

369
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,600
were always working hard.

370
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:30,760
They didn't have much money.

371
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,800
Even the white-faced man in the restaurant

372
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,880
was trying to steal it.

373
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,240
But he was so happy.

374
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,040
Yes.

375
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,880
At that time,

376
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,840
he was so happy.

377
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:52,400
Shi Qi Lang,

378
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,440
this capital is a human-made strategy.

379
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:57,040
You said that

380
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:59,200
when are we going back to the prison

381
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,440
and when are we going back?

382
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,760
There's nothing left.

383
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:07,400
We'll go back after the medical treatment.

384
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,600
We don't need to

385
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,600
understand the plot of the capital anymore.

386
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,320
Let's go.

387
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,200
Maybe in a short time,

388
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,600
Your Highness will understand.

389
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,040
It's not that Prince Qin wants to go back to the prison

390
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:27,440
and be Shi Qi Lang.

391
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,840
But he's not going to go back to the prison.

392
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,240
If he goes back to the prison

393
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:33,240
and be Shi Qi Lang,

394
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,040
he can go back to the prison

395
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,840
and be Shi Qi Lang.

396
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:38,840
But Prince Qin

397
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,440
can't be the crown prince of the Eastern Palace.

398
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,160
Shi Qi Lang,

399
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,240
I've got a message.

400
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:56,440
Say that Miss Sui is waiting for you.

401
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:57,840
See you in the garden.

402
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,040
Miss Sui,

403
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,240
I'm sorry.

404
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:04,240
I'm sorry.

405
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,240
I'm sorry.

406
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,240
I'm sorry.

407
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,240
I'm sorry.

408
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:08,240
I'm sorry.

409
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:09,240
I'm sorry.

410
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,240
I'm sorry.

411
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,240
I'm sorry.

412
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,240
I'm sorry.

413
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,240
I'm sorry.

414
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,240
I'm sorry.

415
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,240
I'm sorry.

416
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,240
I'm sorry.

417
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:17,240
I'm sorry.

418
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,240
I'm sorry.

419
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:19,240
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,240
I'm sorry.

421
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,240
I'm sorry.

422
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,240
I'm sorry.

423
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,240
I'm sorry.

424
00:21:23,240 --> 00:21:24,240
I'm sorry.

425
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:25,240
I'm sorry.

426
00:21:25,240 --> 00:21:26,240
I'm sorry.

427
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:27,240
I'm sorry.

428
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,240
I'm sorry.

429
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:29,640
Let's go.

430
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,640
Ying.

431
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,840
Can you take the painting underneath my eyes?

432
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,240
Shui Qi Lang,

433
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:53,240
don't you understand?

434
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:54,640
I'm the one who stayed in the Eastern Palace,

435
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
either or you.

436
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,760
You can't believe me.

437
00:21:58,040 --> 00:21:59,680
Don't you have time for me?

438
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
Why do you have to trust yourself?

439
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,440
Then why did you come to see me?

440
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:04,640
Yes.

441
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,560
You've lost everything.

442
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,200
What else do you want?

443
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:11,280
I'm not here to see you laugh.

444
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,440
I know you must be very upset

445
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,920
about what you did to your family.

446
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,080
So I just want to see you.

447
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:22,040
Yes.

448
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,480
But he's a married woman.

449
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:27,600
He can do anything for her.

450
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,920
That's the position of the crown prince.

451
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:34,280
So the power will make people upset.

452
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:35,880
So I don't want that position.

453
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:39,240
I know that it's a cage since childhood.

454
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,600
Do you want our child

455
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,920
to be born in this cage?

456
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:45,520
Yes.

457
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,320
The power will make people upset.

458
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,320
You will say that.

459
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,400
That's the reason.

460
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,680
You want our child to be born.

461
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,280
You want to be killed

462
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,280
because of this position?

463
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,000
But you're the son of the emperor.

464
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:59,160
You're the king of Qin.

465
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,680
You're the commander of the imperial army.

466
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,000
Do you think you're not in the cage

467
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,200
at this moment?

468
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,680
I don't want to be your son.

469
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,920
Don't you see it clearly?

470
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:14,280
I don't want to fight with you anymore.

471
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:24,120
Your words really madden me.

472
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,640
I don't want to call youodes Π quiet.

473
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,160
It's a little grounds니 对不对.

474
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,800
Look.

475
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:50,640
It's nothing.

476
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:55,680
If I'm in your heart

477
00:23:56,680 --> 00:24:02,680
That car is my car

478
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:09,680
If I never lost my memory

479
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:15,680
I hope it will be the first time

480
00:24:16,680 --> 00:24:18,680
Do you still think you understand?

481
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,680
I'm in the position of the East Palace

482
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:21,680
Or you want it all

483
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:23,680
Otherwise you can't get it

484
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:27,680
You can't trust me

485
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:29,680
Don't you have time with me?

486
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:59,680
Here

487
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:02,680
Dear guests, some sugar cakes

488
00:25:03,680 --> 00:25:06,680
I want two of these

489
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:07,680
And two of these

490
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,680
Okay

491
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:13,680
Erduang

492
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:17,680
Why did you go to see Prince Qin alone?

493
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:18,680
Or I'll follow you?

494
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,680
Is he hiding something from me?

495
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,680
No

496
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:23,680
Your Xiao Wei is so good to you

497
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,680
He won't hide anything from you

498
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:26,680
That's not what I said

499
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,680
Miss is good to me

500
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,680
Why didn't he let me follow you?

501
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:34,680
Is it because

502
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,680
He just wants to see Shi Qilang alone?

503
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:39,680
Just like me

504
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,680
I just want to be with you alone

505
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,680
If your Xiao Wei and Shi Qilang are all here

506
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,680
Then we can talk

507
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,680
Isn't it very unselfish?

508
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,680
Maybe he thinks so too

509
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:56,680
When did you say something so sweet?

510
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,680
I didn't say anything sweet

511
00:25:57,680 --> 00:25:59,680
I just said the truth

512
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
Tao Zi

513
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:07,680
I have a question to ask you

514
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:08,680
Go ahead

515
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:11,680
Last time

516
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,680
I asked you about the question in the amusement park

517
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:16,680
You haven't answered me yet

518
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:19,680
Do you

519
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,680
Do you want to

520
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,680
Silly

521
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:29,680
If I don't want to

522
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:32,680
I can sit here and eat with you

523
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:36,680
Yes

524
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,680
Yes

525
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:41,680
Eat

526
00:26:41,680 --> 00:26:42,680
Yes

527
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:44,680
Yes

528
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,680
Yes

529
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Yes

530
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:12,680
Ying

531
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:15,680
You are awake

532
00:28:32,680 --> 00:28:33,680
Ying

533
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,680
You are awake

534
00:28:42,680 --> 00:28:44,680
It's you

535
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:49,680
I have already found someone

536
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,680
To change your clean clothes

537
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:53,680
Ying

538
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:56,680
I brought you here

539
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
Don't worry

540
00:28:59,680 --> 00:29:01,680
This place is clean and clean

541
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,680
Just like the outside of the city

542
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,680
We two live here together

543
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,680
Don't ask the truth

544
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:09,680
Xiao Yao is happy

545
00:29:09,680 --> 00:29:12,680
No one will bother us anymore

546
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
It's not a good thing

547
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,680
What did you do to me?

548
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:22,680
Ying

549
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:24,680
You can't get angry

550
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:27,680
This is not good for your health

551
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,680
You look like this now

552
00:29:31,680 --> 00:29:32,680
Very good

553
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:35,680
As long as you listen to me

554
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:38,680
I will not hurt you

555
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,680
Nor will I hurt your father

556
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,680
You are a dog thief who colluded with the world

557
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,680
You even hurt my father

558
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:53,680
I don't have enough money for you

559
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,680
Look at you

560
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Talk well

561
00:29:56,680 --> 00:29:58,680
Why are you angry again?

562
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:00,680
Ying

563
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,680
What do you want to eat?

564
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:06,680
I made someone better than you

565
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:10,680
We will eat together later

566
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,680
Okay?

567
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,680
Get out of here

568
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,680
Ying

569
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:26,680
I will go to the kitchen

570
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
Ying

571
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
From now on

572
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:34,680
We will eat together every day

573
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:37,680
I will be with you all the time

574
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,680
Okay?

575
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,680
You will promise me

576
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Right?

577
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
Right

578
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:56,680
Prince Qi, my lady is missing

579
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:58,680
After you said she went back

580
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,680
I was afraid to leave the village

581
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,680
I couldn't find her until I came back to Luoyang

582
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:03,680
General was anxious

583
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
He sent people to find her

584
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:07,680
I just wanted to see you

585
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:09,680
Where can she go now?

586
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:12,680
Hao Ze

587
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,680
How do you find my lady?

588
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,680
I have the same idea since I was a child

589
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,680
I can find her with special silver

590
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,680
But this time

591
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
I can't do anything about it

592
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
So

593
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,680
The person who took her away

594
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:27,680
must know these details

595
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:29,680
So she can be prepared

596
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
You can't find her

597
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:32,680
Then who is this person?

598
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:35,680
Liu Chengfeng

599
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,680
Between Luoyang and Luoyouyuan

600
00:31:40,680 --> 00:31:43,680
There are countless people in the underground control room

601
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,680
It's not a problem to hide

602
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:50,680
If Liu Chengfeng took her away

603
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:51,680
It would be a disaster

604
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,680
He wouldn't dare to stay in the eight cities

605
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:55,680
He should have taken her away

606
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:57,680
He won't be hidden too far

607
00:31:57,680 --> 00:31:58,680
Why?

608
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,680
Because Ying is too smart

609
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:03,680
If he is left alone

610
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:05,680
He will take her away

611
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:07,680
It's not easy to take her away

612
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Liu Chengfeng is very close to Ying

613
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:15,680
He must have been in Luoyang's room

614
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,680
with his new plan

615
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,680
He is not in the safe zone

616
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:20,680
But on the map

617
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
Luoyang is so big

618
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,680
I have to find him

619
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:25,680
How long does it take?

620
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,680
North side

621
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,680
Only north side

622
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:30,680
Liu Chengfeng is close to the underground control room

623
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,680
Then he will choose one

624
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:34,680
The place where the control room can be supported

625
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:36,680
Then only north side

626
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:38,680
The underground control room is closed

627
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:40,680
More importantly

628
00:32:40,680 --> 00:32:41,680
Everything is easy

629
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,680
It's the source of the control room

630
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,680
If it's just one place

631
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,680
It's easier to find him

632
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
It's a secret pool

633
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:50,680
We can set off now

634
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:52,680
We can't fall off without the military order

635
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,680
Chang'er

636
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,680
Lao Bao

637
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
Let's go to the bridge

638
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:56,680
Yes

639
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:57,680
Yuan

640
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:58,680
Take some people to the hunting ground

641
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,680
Then we meet up with them

642
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:01,680
If anyone asks

643
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,680
Please tell us to leave the city

644
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,680
I'll go now

645
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:11,680
What do you think?

646
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:21,680
How is it?

647
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:25,680
The two mountains are all searched

648
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,680
Nothing special

649
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,680
The mountains are in the military order

650
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,680
It's easy to find

651
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,680
Shiqing

652
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:31,680
Is there a way?

653
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,680
What?

654
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
It turns out that

655
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,680
When we were on the war

656
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:36,680
We were worried about the soldiers

657
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:37,680
to chase the troops

658
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,680
So we tried our best

659
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:40,680
But there is one thing

660
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,680
No matter what

661
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,680
We can't tell

662
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:43,680
That is, people live

663
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:45,680
They must eat salt

664
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:47,680
And the people who eat salt

665
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,680
How can they not go to the mountains?

666
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,680
Liu Chengfeng is going to eat the crispy lotus

667
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,680
There must be a lot of people

668
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:54,680
The chestnut skin

669
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:55,680
The nearby incense sticks

670
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:57,680
The salt sold is fixed

671
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,680
Ordinary villagers can't afford it

672
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:00,680
They only change salt every time

673
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:01,680
They don't talk much

674
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:03,680
We check the incense sticks around the neighborhood

675
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:04,680
See if there are any outsiders

676
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:06,680
to buy salt in the place of selling salt

677
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:07,680
And there are not many

678
00:34:07,680 --> 00:34:08,680
We can track them down

679
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:09,680
Come on

680
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:10,680
Xiyou

681
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:12,680
Come

682
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:14,680
Drink the medicine first

683
00:34:17,680 --> 00:34:18,680
Don't worry

684
00:34:19,680 --> 00:34:20,680
It's not poison

685
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:23,680
It's not poison

686
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:25,680
It makes me weak

687
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:26,680
It makes me weak, right?

688
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:27,680
Ying

689
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:29,680
I really did it for your good

690
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,680
Don't tell me this

691
00:34:31,680 --> 00:34:33,680
You only care about me

692
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:35,680
You won't collude with the接er

693
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,680
You won't want to harm dad

694
00:34:37,680 --> 00:34:39,680
I have to

695
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,680
If you marry me early

696
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:44,680
I won't collude with the接er

697
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:48,680
I will also be filial to dad

698
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,680
But it doesn't matter

699
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,680
As long as you are with me now

700
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,680
I'm satisfied

701
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,680
No matter how you hit me

702
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,680
or scold me

703
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,680
I'm willing to do anything

704
00:35:08,680 --> 00:35:10,680
If you don't want to drink

705
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:12,680
I'll feed you

706
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:19,680
Third Brother, you are so good at this

707
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:20,680
I didn't expect to be asked by the county

708
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:22,680
There are no outsiders to buy salt

709
00:35:22,680 --> 00:35:24,680
But there are many salt in the county

710
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,680
A few decades ago

711
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,680
Many salt were bought by people

712
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,680
So the salt in the county

713
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,680
was sold to the county

714
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,680
How can you praise me like that?

715
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:33,680
It's all luck

716
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:34,680
Look at the luck

717
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:35,680
The salt in the county

718
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,680
is bought by Liu Shenfeng

719
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,680
How can you say that you are lucky?

720
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:40,680
Didn't you just check it?

721
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:41,680
What if it's not?

722
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:42,680
It's not

723
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:43,680
No, it's not

724
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,680
Second Brother, it's not

725
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:46,680
It's a good thing

726
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,680
We are moving separately

727
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:49,680
Search every mountain

728
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
The direction is not too white

729
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
Let's take more people

730
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Dad, go to the Central Union

731
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,680
Okay

732
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:56,680
Let's go

733
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:57,680
Okay

734
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Second Brother,

735
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,680
there are strangers around

736
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,680
They are still outside

737
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,680
They saw the horse's nest

738
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,680
Li Ni is a killer

739
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,680
He is more polite than a dog

740
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:19,680
He is now sending his own

741
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,680
to the door

742
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,680
It's good

743
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:24,680
I'll take him

744
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,680
and his dog together

745
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,680
I'll take him

746
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
and his dog together

747
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,680
I'll take him

748
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:31,680
and his dog together

749
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,680
I'll take him and his dog together

750
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:34,680
I'll take him

751
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
and his dog together

752
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,680
and kill him in front of aunt

753
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:40,680
It's here

754
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,680
Shiqing, what should we do now?

755
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Don't move

756
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:45,680
Go find a way to get out

757
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Go

758
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:47,680
Go

759
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:48,680

780
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:09,680
Go and find a way

781
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:10,680
I'll go and find him

782
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:11,680
Okay

783
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Ying

784
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:42,680
What are you looking at?

785
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,680
You look so familiar

786
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,680
Take a look

787
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,680
What did I bring you?

788
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:04,680
I know

789
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,680
Last time in Changzhou

790
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,680
we were in a happy mood

791
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:10,680
I know you're sad too

792
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:12,680
So this time

793
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,680
I chose so many happy things

794
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:17,680
Choose one you like

795
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:19,680
Let's have a happy wedding

796
00:38:20,680 --> 00:38:21,680
and have a happy wedding

797
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Liu Chengfeng

798
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:26,680
Do you know what you're doing?

799
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,680
I'm preparing to have a happy wedding with you

800
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,680
You know it clearly

801
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,680
I will never marry you

802
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,680
We grew up together

803
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,680
I treat you as my brother

804
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,680
In my heart

805
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,680
You're my brother

806
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:47,680
Enough

807
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,680
Don't take this kind of nonsense

808
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,680
Your father never treated me as his own son

809
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:55,680
Wei is not your brother

810
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:57,680
It's all because of Li Ni

811
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,680
If Li Ni is not here

812
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,680
You married me long ago

813
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:04,680
You won't say such a cold and heartless thing

814
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,680
Li Ni, I won't like you

815
00:39:11,680 --> 00:39:13,680
My father once asked me

816
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:15,680
whether I want to marry you

817
00:39:16,680 --> 00:39:18,680
He thinks we grew up together

818
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:20,680
You take care of me

819
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,680
My father thinks

820
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:25,680
if one day

821
00:39:26,680 --> 00:39:28,680
he leaves this world

822
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:30,680
Will he be lonely

823
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,680
when he is alone?

824
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:34,680
If you take care of me

825
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,680
he may be relieved

826
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,680
But I tell my father

827
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:42,680
I won't marry you

828
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,680
Or at that time

829
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:48,680
I didn't intend to marry anyone

830
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:54,680
But you want the emperor to give you a letter

831
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:58,680
You want to choose a family from three princes

832
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:01,680
You lied to me

833
00:40:02,680 --> 00:40:04,680
You don't want to marry anyone

834
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,680
You don't want to marry me

835
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,680
I didn't lie to you

836
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,680
I really don't want to marry anyone

837
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:14,680
It's so hard for a woman to live

838
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,680
If there is no one who knows me

839
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:19,680
and knows why I have to marry someone

840
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:22,680
I'm living my life freely

841
00:40:22,680 --> 00:40:23,680
Isn't it good?

842
00:40:24,680 --> 00:40:25,680
Don't I know you?

843
00:40:26,680 --> 00:40:27,680
Don't you know me?

844
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:32,680
You respect me

845
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:34,680
and treat me well

846
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:37,680
But he doesn't know me

847
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,680
nor do you know me

848
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,680
Before I met Li Ni

849
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:45,680
I think

850
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,680
I'm a good person

851
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,680
But after I met Li Ni

852
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,680
I just want to be with him

853
00:40:58,680 --> 00:40:59,680
Ying

854
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,680
I like you and I like you

855
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,680
Why do you say these words hurt me?

856
00:41:08,680 --> 00:41:10,680
Is it because I'm close to the接er

857
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:12,680
So you're very angry

858
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:14,680
and hate me

859
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,680
I just want to live

860
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:18,680
If I die

861
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:21,680
you will remember me

862
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,680
You won't

863
00:41:24,680 --> 00:41:26,680
You will forget me right away

864
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:27,680
You will throw me out of my mind

865
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,680
You will marry Li Ni

866
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,680
and let me live a happy and happy life

867
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,680
You will forget me forever

868
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,680
You will forget me forever

869
00:41:36,680 --> 00:41:37,680
So I can't die

870
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:38,680
I can't die

871
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,680
I can't let you marry Li Ni

872
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:42,680
So I'm going to find the接er

873
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:46,680
Childe

874
00:41:49,680 --> 00:41:52,680
This may be the last time I've ever met you

875
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:56,680
Because the one who loved me

876
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,680
and the one who let me live

877
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:01,680
He's dead

878
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
He's dead

879
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,680
He's dead in the river

880
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,680
You have the right to live

881
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,680
But you can't go to the接er

882
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:16,680
for me

883
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:18,680
You can't go to him for me

884
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:23,680
Say it

885
00:42:27,680 --> 00:42:28,680
Now

886
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:32,680
Now

887
00:42:35,680 --> 00:42:37,680
I'm alone

888
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:41,680
Ying

889
00:42:44,680 --> 00:42:45,680
You're so cruel

890
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,680
I've done so much for you

891
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,680
Now I'm the one who's going to die

892
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,680
You have no one else but Li

893
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:03,680
But it's okay, Ying

894
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,680
No matter what you say

895
00:43:06,680 --> 00:43:11,680
You can't see Li Ni again in this life

896
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:15,680
I won't let him take you away from me

897
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,680
You will be my son

898
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,680
You dream

899
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:22,680
I will never marry you

900
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:24,680
I don't know Li Ni

901
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:26,680
And my father will come to save me

902
00:43:26,680 --> 00:43:28,680
You can't escape

903
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:31,680
Cui Xia Jun has many tricks

904
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,680
You've read it yourself

905
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,680
How did Cui Xia Jun's tricks come true

906
00:43:36,680 --> 00:43:39,680
My father will come here personally

907
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,680
He's your bones

908
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:47,680
Shi Qi Lang

909
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,680
I've prepared the firecrackers

910
00:43:49,680 --> 00:43:50,680
It's enough

911
00:43:50,680 --> 00:43:51,680
Prepare well

912
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:52,680
Yes

913
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:53,680
Yes

914
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,680
Sir

915
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:10,680
I have a news

916
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,680
There are many weapons in the field

917
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,680
General should have brought the weapons

918
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:17,680
If General brought the weapons

919
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
We'll be in the same place

920
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:21,680
with these steps

921
00:44:21,680 --> 00:44:23,680
And those heavy weapons are even in the Ma Du family

922
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:25,680
Our base is useless to them

923
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:27,680
They'll arrive at the most tomorrow noon

924
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:28,680
Sir

925
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:30,680
Take the people to the mountain road

926
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,680
and take them to the place where they will be captured

927
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:33,680
I'll stay here

928
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,680
Pretend to be the place where you and Xiao Wei are still in the hospital

929
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,680
I'll kill the general

930
00:45:21,680 --> 00:45:23,680
I'll kill the general

931
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:25,680
I'll love you forever

932
00:46:26,680 --> 00:46:30,680
I'll sacrifice my life for you

933
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:35,680
I'll wait for you to come back to me

934
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:41,680
I'll remember the promise I made for you

935
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:48,680
I'll love you forever

936
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:53,680
I'll sacrifice my life for you

937
00:46:53,680 --> 00:47:00,680
I'll wait for you to come back to me
