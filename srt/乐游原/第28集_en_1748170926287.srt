Episode 크�echita

6
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:46,880
The responsibility of courting and giving went wrong.

7
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,280
He said that you've done a great job,

8
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,760
and you will be rewarded.

9
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:55,860
It makes meية brought me here so harshly.

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:56,880
It's normal,

11
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,880
I got two old plum-dried plum-dried plum-dried plum.

12
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,240
Peiyuan sent me here

13
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:02,480
after we arrived in Bizhou.

14
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,640
Although it's not worth it,

15
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,720
it's worth it.

16
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,200
I'm a rough-minded person.

17
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
I don't know much about the flower-dried plum-dried plum.

18
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,560
But I heard that

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:11,560
the flower-dried plum is a great choice.

20
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,520
So,

21
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,120
the two old plum-dried plum-dried plum-dried plum-dried plum

22
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,800
is a pity to me.

23
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,280
I'll take them to the manor

24
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,200
when I get back.

25
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,680
I'm so grateful that you're here.

26
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:24,560
I'm not qualified.

27
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,600
By the way,

28
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:29,200
the daughter of the Cui family

29
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,640
and the daughter of the Cui family

30
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
are going to see His Majesty.

31
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,920
I haven't made a conclusion yet.

32
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,520
It's not just that I can't prove it.

33
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,640
Now,

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,760
the Ministry of War is also coming in.

35
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,120
The Ministry of War says

36
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:46,080
the Cui family is fighting against the enemy in the front.

37
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,000
The Cui family

38
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,040
can try to make the son of the general

39
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,440
to see His Majesty.

40
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,320
But the Ministry of War says

41
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,920
there's no such precedent.

42
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:55,600
And the Ministry of Revenue says

43
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,280
the provisions and military provisions of the Cui family

44
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,920
are not from the Ministry of Revenue.

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:10,820
Since the time of the

46
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,120
government of Pingliang, Weiyang, and Shuifu,

47
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,920
the money is not enough.

48
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,880
Actually,

49
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,280
the daughter of the Cui family is going to see His Majesty today.

50
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,480
The Ministry of Revenue

51
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,480
is just a military order.

52
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:23,880
Is there no precedent?

53
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,320
The mother of the Cui family is He's family.

54
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,360
She's the wife of the Cui family.

55
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,840
I remember during the Rui family,

56
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,160
the government gave birth to a daughter of the family

57
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,360
for the sake of the family.

58
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,080
They gave birth to a daughter

59
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:37,880
of the family in the Great Court

60
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,840
to the palace in person.

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,920
The emperor of the royal family

62
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,520
gave birth to the family in person.

63
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:47,200
You're really a good man.

64
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:49,080
You have the power.

65
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,840
Since that,

66
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:55,280
the daughter of the Cui family

67
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,760
can go to the palace to see His Majesty.

68
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:03,160
I just asked someone to check the scroll.

69
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:04,760
Indeed,

70
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,680
Prince Qin also checked the scroll a few days ago.

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:12,160
The daughter of the Royal Mother of the Royal Family

72
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,640
was more than 60 years ago.

73
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:17,120
Only the old man of the Ministry of Revenue

74
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,280
can find this scroll.

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,400
Prince Qin especially sought this old man

76
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,800
to prevent him from using the scroll

77
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,040
to the daughter of the Cui family.

78
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,720
For the daughter of the Cui family,

79
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:32,200
he spent hundreds of years to make her

80
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,400
want to get what she wants.

81
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,640
Wang'er,

82
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,840
you're a smart child.

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,880
If your opponent is the daughter of the Cui family,

84
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:50,640
I think you're a good man.

85
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,680
But if your opponent is not the daughter of the Cui family,

86
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,840
but the true love of the daughter of the Cui family,

87
00:04:57,320 --> 00:04:58,240
then you think

88
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,560
you have to make a lot of money.

89
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:06,400
If everything goes well,

90
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,520
you'll lose your life.

91
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,240
You don't deserve to be a daughter of your father.

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,640
Besides, it's hard to tell.

93
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,720
Prince Qin is kind to the daughter of the Cui family.

94
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,760
But if the daughter of the Cui family

95
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,400
defends the emperor and defends the country,

96
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,120
I don't think he's the son of afterward

97
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:26,120
who will lose his face.

98
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,720
So, the man

99
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,440
increase his lack of respect for father,

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:32,840
możli mak etpn

101
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:34,960
and say he defies the country?

102
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,600
I don't know.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:40,520
Father,

104
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:43,080
Ram��를

105
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:45,720
was cameras everywhere

106
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,800
and you took a lot of choices.

107
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,880
Even the Academy of even

108
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,680
is due to humiliation.

109
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:56,280
Then it's impossible to take one step back.

110
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:10,640
Miss.

111
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:12,760
Miss,

112
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:13,320
uh-huh.

113
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,720
The Ministry of passéons have just sent

114
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,040
a message

115
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:16,200
to allow one to go to see His Majesty,

116
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,240
here in the Pure Land of Great Qin in 35 days.

117
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,160
Really?

118
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:22,160
It seems that they finally made up a story.

119
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,160
Anyway, the Ministry of Rites said

120
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,160
it was a fairy of the Lady of the Manor.

121
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,160
I don't know what it means.

122
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:33,160
It means that the lady can go to see His Majesty.

123
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:35,160
It's faster than I thought.

124
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:37,160
But I heard that

125
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,160
the Prime Minister personally went to the Ministry of Rites.

126
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,160
He found the fairy more than 60 years ago.

127
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,160
That's why the Ministry of Rites agreed to go to see you.

128
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:48,160
More than 60 years ago?

129
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:51,160
It's hard for him to find it.

130
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,160
It seems that the Prime Minister has worked hard

131
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,160
to fight for the Imperial Court.

132
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:00,160
By the way, Miss, I heard from Erdu

133
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,160
that the Prince of Qin went to the Ministry of Rites a few days ago.

134
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:07,160
He said that he went to the Ministry of Rites

135
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,160
to investigate the scrolls for a few days.

136
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:13,160
You know that no one has ever touched the scrolls for many years.

137
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,160
They searched for a few days and got a face.

138
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,160
I think that the Prince of Qin is really interesting.

139
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,160
The Prime Minister knows that he only cares about his own business

140
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,160
for the sake of our Fairy.

141
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,160
He doesn't ask about you.

142
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,160
How did you dress like this today?

143
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,160
I went to the court.

144
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
How long have you not gone to the court?

145
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,160
I remember that you were on the court for three days,

146
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,160
and you were on the court for two days.

147
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:53,160
You were always lazy and didn't want to go.

148
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:55,160
Which wind blew you up today?

149
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,160
You suddenly wanted to go to the court.

150
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,160
It's a good day today.

151
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:00,160
So you went to the court?

152
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,160
It's a good day.

153
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,160
Don't forget to bring the bed and come back to the brothers.

154
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,160
Bring the tea and spring to the wine.

155
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,160
The General of Pingliang, General Wei Yang,

156
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:14,160
General of Shuozhou, General of Xingjun,

157
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,160
and General of Wei Wei,

158
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,160
the daughter of Cui Yi, Cui Lin,

159
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
go to heaven.

160
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,160
I, Cui Lin, greet Your Majesty.

161
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:48,160
No.

162
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

163
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,160
Since you said that you want to replace your father,

164
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,160
you must go to the court to see the truth.

165
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:00,160
Just say it if you have anything.

166
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,160
I don't want to hear anything.

167
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:04,160
I don't want to hear anything.

168
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:06,160
I don't want to hear anything.

169
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,160
I don't want to hear anything.

170
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,160
I don't want to hear anything.

171
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,160
Just say it.

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,160
Cui Lin's father, Jin Jian,

173
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,160
is a member of Dongdu Luoyang.

174
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
When he was in trouble with Sun Jing,

175
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:20,160
Cui's army was in charge of the position.

176
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,160
Now, the world is calm.

177
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:25,160
His Majesty is in a hurry to break the rules.

178
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:28,160
So Cui's army immediately retreated from Luoyang

179
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,160
and returned Dongdu Luoyang to the court.

180
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,160
You mean,

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,160
you want to return Dongdu Luoyang to me?

182
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,160
Yes.

183
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:41,160
Luoyang is the Dongdu of the state court.

184
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,160
Of course, it's also the Dongdu of His Majesty.

185
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,160
Cui's army is just a temporary control.

186
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,160
Now, it's a mess.

187
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,160
Cui's army should retreat from Luoyang

188
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,160
and return Dongdu Luoyang to the court.

189
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,160
Good.

190
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,160
Very good.

191
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:58,160
I'm sorry.

192
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,160
Good.

193
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,160
Very good.

194
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
So you're here to talk about this matter.

195
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,160
You should have said it earlier.

196
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:08,160
Good.

197
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:11,160
I like you so much.

198
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,160
I really want to tell the Empress

199
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,160
to let her have a good time.

200
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:17,160
And to treat you well.

201
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,160
Thank you, Your Majesty.

202
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,160
Your Majesty.

203
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,160
Today, Cui Lin

204
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:35,160
was wearing a armor and went to the palace.

205
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,160
I'm thinking

206
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,160
that Cui Yi is so rude.

207
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:41,160
His daughter

208
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,160
wouldn't have gone to the palace.

209
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,160
But I didn't expect

210
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,160
Cui Lin would say

211
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,160
to return Dongdu Luoyang to the court.

212
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

213
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Congratulations.

214
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:56,160
Congratulations.

215
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,160
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

216
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,160
You've returned Dongdu Luoyang

217
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:01,160
without any effort.

218
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:03,160
I've said it before.

219
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,160
I'm a real man.

220
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,160
I'm a real man.

221
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:10,160
Of course, I'm a man of fortune.

222
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,160
His Majesty said

223
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,160
he wanted to show off his skills.

224
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,160
I wonder

225
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,160
how he should do it.

226
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,160
He should do it more enthusiastically.

227
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,160
He should teach more of his skills.

228
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,160
Let Cui Lin

229
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,160
show off his skills

230
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,160
in the real battle in the capital.

231
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,160
He should show off his skills.

232
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:33,160
Yes.

233
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,160
The Cui family is now in the war in Shouzhou.

234
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:39,160
The court keeps guessing on him.

235
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,160
Cui Lin

236
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
will take the father to the court

237
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:43,160
and return Dongdu Luoyang to the court.

238
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,160
It's not easy to open and close the river

239
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,160
and make a mess.

240
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,160
Cui is really old.

241
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:51,160
He's a real man.

242
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,160
Considering what mother knows about Cui's daughter,

243
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,160
she might

244
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
have decided to

245
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,160
give her father to her

246
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,160
to make a decision today.

247
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Then Cui Lin

248
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:07,160
is the one who's going to protect me.

249
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:09,160
In your opinion,

250
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,160
is the court's guess

251
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,160
completely cancelled

252
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,160
or temporarily cancelled?

253
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,160
Of course, temporarily cancelled.

254
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
Cui is the general of Pingliang, Weiyang.

255
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,160
He's a general.

256
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,160
He's a serious person.

257
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,160
How could the court

258
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,160
not be proud of him?

259
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,160
Father Shui Cai mentioned

260
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:29,160
that the empress is going to invite Cui

261
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,160
to be the matchmaker in the capital.

262
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,160
Is mother

263
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,160
qualified to be the matchmaker?

264
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,160
Of course.

265
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,160
Then let mother

266
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,160
see it for yourself.

267
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,160
This is Cui, the one who's going to be the matchmaker.

268
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,160
Didn't you already

269
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:48,160
understand her?

270
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,160
This is a time-to-time experiment.

271
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:52,160
She was in the army.

272
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,160
Now she's in the temple hall.

273
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,160
Father.

274
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,160
I didn't expect

275
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,160
Cui to look good today.

276
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:09,160
Especially with a deep thought and a deep thought.

277
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,160
Don't be so crazy.

278
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,160
These days,

279
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,160
I've been thinking about it.

280
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,160
Although Cui

281
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:21,160
gave back the crown to me,

282
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:23,160
but I've been thinking about it for a long time,

283
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,160
it's hard to avoid her dying.

284
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:26,160
So,

285
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,160
I still have to be nice to her.

286
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,160
Cui only has one daughter.

287
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,160
If you marry her daughter,

288
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:37,160
wouldn't it be a serious matter

289
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,160
to bring Cui's military power to the court?

290
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:42,160
Father, you're wise.

291
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
It's possible.

292
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:44,160
These two empresses

293
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,160
are going to have a grand feast

294
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:47,160
in the palace.

295
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,160
I had the empress

296
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:51,160
teach a few of them to come back to the palace.

297
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
It would be a great deal if they were here.

298
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,160
But now,

299
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,160
you and the princesses

300
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,160
and Li Ni

301
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:00,160
will have a feast together.

302
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
They are all guests.

303
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,160
You.

304
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:07,160
You have to take a good look at Cui.

305
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,160
Take a look.

306
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,160
Do you want to marry her?

307
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,160
Don't make yourself feel wronged.

308
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,160
Thank you, father.

309
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:17,160
Thank you, father.

310
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,160
I'm Cui Ling.

311
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,160
Your Highness.

312
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:51,160
I'm sorry to see you.

313
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,160
Miss Cui was a fake maid

314
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,160
the other day.

315
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:57,160
She said she was so gentle

316
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:58,160
and didn't let me marry her.

317
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
I was thinking

318
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:03,160
I could meet a general today.

319
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,160
I didn't expect

320
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,160
Miss Cui

321
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,160
to be a maid

322
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,160
today.

323
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:10,160
I was thinking

324
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,160
she might be a maid

325
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:14,160
today.

326
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,160
Miss Cui

327
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,160
is a maid.

328
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,160
But she has

329
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
a very good attitude

330
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,160
and a good attitude.

331
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,160
Your Highness, you're too much.

332
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,160
You don't have to be so formal.

333
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:27,160
Please have a seat.

334
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

335
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,160
Today's feast

336
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,160
is

337
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:45,160
to congratulate Miss Cui

338
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:46,160
and

339
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,160
to welcome her home.

340
00:15:49,160 --> 00:15:51,160
Miss Cui is from Yingzhou,

341
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:53,160
and she's from the capital.

342
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,160
Today,

343
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,160
I'll let Prince Qi,

344
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,160
Prince Qin,

345
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,160
and these young kids

346
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,160
to take you to the capital.

347
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:05,160
Today,

348
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,160
I'll drink this cup

349
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,160
to welcome Miss Cui.

350
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:14,160
Thank you, Your Highness.

351
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,160
Thank you, Prince Qi.

352
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Mother,

353
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,160
the play of the dishes

354
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:24,160
is ready.

355
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,160
It's great.

356
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:27,160
Today's feast,

357
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:30,160
I'll make a new bowl of noodles.

358
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,160
Prince Qi

359
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,160
specially made a new bowl

360
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,160
from the south.

361
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,160
I'll let Miss Cui

362
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:39,160
and the guests

363
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:41,160
have a good time together.

364
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,160
Prince Qi,

365
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,160
you're so thoughtful.

366
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,160
The play of the dishes

367
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,160
is the most practical.

368
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,160
After the two sides

369
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,160
come up,

370
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:53,160
you can only take the bowl

371
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,160
as a weapon.

372
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:55,160
You can use

373
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,160
the way to

374
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,160
block the way

375
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:58,160
to block the opponent.

376
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,160
You can use the first

377
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:01,160
one to take the ball

378
00:17:01,160 --> 00:17:02,160
as a victory.

379
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:03,160
Prince Qi,

380
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:04,160
you're so thoughtful

381
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,160
to Miss Cui.

382
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:08,160
Can I be thoughtful?

383
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,160
After all,

384
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,160
her father

385
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,160
was a soldier.

386
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
She was a soldier.

387
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,160
She was a family member.

388
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,160
She could not be

389
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:15,160
the head of the Eastern Palace.

390
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:16,160
No wonder

391
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,160
she was a maid.

392
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
She even

393
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,160
wanted to

394
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,160
blame herself for being a son.

395
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
She was so thoughtful.

396
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,160
The two sides

397
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,160
are thinking about

398
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,160
how to

399
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,160
kick the opponent down.

400
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,160
While

401
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,160
thinking about

402
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,160
how to take the ball.

403
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,160
At the same time,

404
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,160
the enemy

405
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,160
is not allowed to kick the opponent down.

406
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,160
The play of the dishes

407
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,160
is really great.

408
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
It's interesting.

409
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,160
Let's just look at it like this.

410
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:40,160
It's not hot enough.

411
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,160
How about

412
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,160
playing with the ball

413
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:45,160
according to the classic Chinese style?

414
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,160
There are not many.

415
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,160
It's fun.

416
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,160
As you said,

417
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:50,160
it's great.

418
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,160
Miss Cui,

419
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,160
you're a guest.

420
00:17:55,160 --> 00:17:56,160
Please

421
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,160
play with the ball.

422
00:17:58,160 --> 00:17:59,160
Yes.

423
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,160
Miss Cui,

424
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,160
whichever team you like,

425
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,160
you can play with the ball.

426
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,160
The ball

427
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,160
is the top of the gold plate.

428
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,160
It's the ball.

429
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,160
You can play with the ball.

430
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,160
Miss Cui

431
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,160
will play the ball

432
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,160
on the table later.

433
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,160
It's the top of the gold plate.

434
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,160
Which team

435
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,160
do you like?

436
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,160
I think

437
00:18:21,160 --> 00:18:23,160
the red team is smart.

438
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:25,160
They can win.

439
00:18:25,160 --> 00:18:26,160
Then I'll play

440
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,160
the team you like.

441
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,160
I'll play the red team.

442
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,160
The gold plate is the top of the gold plate.

443
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,160
The ball is the top of the gold plate.

444
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,160
Your Highness,

445
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,160
do you want to play with the ball?

446
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:44,160
Your Highness,

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,160
I'll play the team

448
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,160
you like.

449
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:47,160
Which team do you want to play with?

450
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,160
I think

451
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,160
the blue team can win.

452
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,160
Fine.

453
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,160
I'll play the blue team

454
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,160
for Miss Cui.

455
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,160
The jade fish

456
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,160
is the top of the gold plate.

457
00:19:01,160 --> 00:19:03,160
The three of you are so great.

458
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,160
So great.

459
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,160
The two can play the jade fish.

460
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:13,160
You can play the big day.

461
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,160
What time is it?

462
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,160
What time is it?

463
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,160
It's two or three o'clock.

464
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,160
Miss Cui

465
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,160
watch out, please.

466
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,560
Whoserance

467
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,160
you are angry with.

468
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:34,800
Your Highness.

469
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:47,640
Good!

470
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:52,520
How lucky that Miss Cui's revving.

471
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,800
Well said.

472
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:57,760
Let's give all the others to Hang пойдar Zhong

473
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,600
on this.

474
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,160
Miss Cui,

475
00:20:01,680 --> 00:20:02,880
which should they do

476
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:03,600
from the next round?

477
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,880
I think we should still keep the red team.

478
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,200
I think the red team

479
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
will win the title.

480
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:11,440
Pass the order.

481
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,120
Let's do our best today.

482
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,600
No matter which team wins,

483
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:16,000
we'll all get 100 gold.

484
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,960
Wait.

485
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,320
I'll go to the court myself this time.

486
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:29,880
Brother,

487
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,600
don't you usually play the most?

488
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:32,880
Are you willing to play with me?

489
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:34,200
Let's do it.

490
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,600
Well...

491
00:20:36,680 --> 00:20:37,560
Your Highness,

492
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,040
I'm willing to play with you

493
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,400
and your brother.

494
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,440
If you help me,

495
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,560
I'll win the title.

496
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,560
But, Brother,

497
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:47,880
we're two people.

498
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:48,880
You're a different person.

499
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:50,280
It's not fair to you.

500
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:52,280
Why don't you

501
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,000
pick another person as your brother?

502
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,000
No need.

503
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,520
I'll go with the second one.

504
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:00,760
Your Highness.

505
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,120
I'll go.

506
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
Your Highness.

507
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,000
You must go.

508
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,200
Wait and see.

509
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:11,640
Okay.

510
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,280
Thank you for your kindness.

511
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:21,960
I'll come back after I save you.

512
00:21:22,360 --> 00:21:23,640
Thanks, Your Highness.

513
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:24,880
See you.

514
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:26,400
Thank you for seeing me.

515
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Your Highness,

516
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
it takes a while.

517
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,560
I'm still here,

518
00:21:30,560 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm so lucky.

519
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,920
From that day on,

520
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,520
I'll take the Dragon Phoenix Chai

521
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,520
and make a fortune for you.

522
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:40,480
I'll make a fortune for you myself.

523
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,560
Thank you, mother.

524
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,000
Tell me,

525
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,320
how about a shop like this

526
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,360
where we can open a shop?

527
00:21:50,840 --> 00:21:52,080
I've mentioned it.

528
00:21:52,360 --> 00:21:53,600
You really have a plan.

529
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,520
Of course.

530
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,800
I'll remember every word you said.

531
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:01,920
Actually,

532
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,120
opening a shop like this

533
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,760
is not a good idea.

534
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,080
And

535
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,440
I think the shops selling small bowls on the street

536
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:12,040
are very lively.

537
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:15,160
And those marigolds and water-based pots.

538
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,280
Many ladies like them.

539
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:18,000
Okay.

540
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,640
Let's start what you like.

541
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:21,240
Silly girl.

542
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,080
Silly girl.

543
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,680
The yellow lotus banquet today.

544
00:22:31,240 --> 00:22:32,080
What do you think

545
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,840
will happen to the banquet?

546
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,000
I wonder if the queen and the lady

547
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,400
have met each other.

548
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,480
They will.

549
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,560
Shiqilang likes Miss Cui so much.

550
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,840
She'll surely make sure to make Miss Cui happy.

551
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:48,120
I hope they can get along well.

552
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:49,240
Or

553
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,160
if we two are so good,

554
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,920
if they don't get along well,

555
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,840
I'll feel sorry for Miss Cui.

556
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,120
I will.

557
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:49,760
How could you do that?

558
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:07,360
You have forgotten, Your Highness.

559
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,360
Cui's secret plan is nothing like that.

560
00:25:14,680 --> 00:25:16,120
I know you will never do it,

561
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,380
but

562
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:19,380
Good!

563
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:21,380
Good!

564
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,380
Good!

565
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,380
Miss Cui, you are a hero!

566
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:31,380
Miss Cui, you really opened my eyes today.

567
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:35,380
Miss Cui, you are indeed a person who has been to the battlefield.

568
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:37,380
You are so talented.

569
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,380
You are very well-behaved.

570
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:42,380
Miss Cui, you are very talented.

571
00:25:46,380 --> 00:25:49,380
Miss Cui, you are very talented.

572
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:53,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

573
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:07,380
This pair of Long Feng Chai is indeed a great skill in the inner palace.

574
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,380
Your Highness, can I give this pair of Long Feng Chai to someone else?

575
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,380
Since it is your talent, I will definitely punish you.

576
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:19,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

577
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,380
I am very pleased to have you here.

578
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:32,380
Your Highness, this pair of long-haired chaps is very kind.

579
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,380
I will give it to you.

580
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,380
Thanks, Your Highness.

581
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:50,380
Black lotta this pair of long chaps.

582
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,380
My wife is embarrassed.

583
00:26:56,380 --> 00:26:58,380
The other ones are doctors exclusive to demek9pa.

584
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:04,380
Anyway, this pair of long chaps is appropriate for you.

585
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,380
Then this phoenix

586
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:11,180
will be given to Miss Gu

587
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
to serve you today.

588
00:27:17,180 --> 00:27:18,580
Thank you, Miss Cui.

589
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,380
It's all Your Highness's reward.

590
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:22,380
I'm just a blessing from the Flower-Caring-Food.

591
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:25,380
Your Highness,

592
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,980
please be my thanks to Miss Gu

593
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:28,980
for your kindness to Her Highness the Empress.

594
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,980
That's what I should do.

595
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,580
Thank you, Mother.

596
00:27:36,980 --> 00:27:38,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

597
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:39,980
You're welcome.

598
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,580
You may all sit down.

599
00:27:41,780 --> 00:27:42,780
Yes.

600
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:46,380
Good boy.

601
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,980
Come here.

602
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,780
Your Highness.

603
00:28:05,380 --> 00:28:07,380
You're so beautiful and handsome.

604
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,380
You're so handsome and beautiful.

605
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:11,380
You're so handsome and handsome.

606
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,380
The most difficult thing is

607
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,380
you're so generous.

608
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,380
I knew that

609
00:28:17,380 --> 00:28:19,380
Gu Wan Niang was hurt.

610
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,380
I wanted to give her a pair of pearl earrings

611
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,380
to comfort her.

612
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:26,380
But you've already thought of it for me.

613
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:29,380
It's good that you don't blame me for being a fool.

614
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,380
How could it be?

615
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,380
I saw you on the stage just now.

616
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:36,380
You were like a leaf.

617
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:38,380
You were so lucky.

618
00:28:39,380 --> 00:28:42,380
Prince Qin has a bright future ahead of him.

619
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,380
But you won today.

620
00:28:45,380 --> 00:28:47,380
It's so rare.

621
00:28:47,380 --> 00:28:50,380
You're even more ugly than him.

622
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,380
Your Highness, you're not feeling well.

623
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,380
Are you hungry?

624
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
Open the banquet.

625
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,380
Yes.

626
00:28:58,380 --> 00:29:00,380
Go back and rest.

627
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

628
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,380
Thank you, Your Highness.

629
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,380
Yes.

630
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,480
Ms. Gu,

631
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:33,400
Come, let me drink to you.

632
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,360
Prince visiting.

633
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,240
Make a далее过请.

634
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,240
The autumn is so bright.

635
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:05,240
If the moon is in the garden,

636
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,240
the moon is on the tree.

637
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,240
The moon is shining.

638
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,240
I think it's beautiful.

639
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
The spring and autumn are all so beautiful.

640
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,240
But in Miss Cui's eyes,

641
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:25,240
the beauty of the world is more than the beauty of the world.

642
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,240
You hate me in your heart.

643
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,240
Why do you hate me when you have the right person?

644
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,240
I think you're angry.

645
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,240
Since you lost,

646
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,240
you're not happy.

647
00:30:44,240 --> 00:30:47,240
I'm afraid you're not angry because you lost money,

648
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,240
but because you're angry because I kissed you.

649
00:30:49,240 --> 00:30:50,240
Yes.

650
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,240
How can you be so clear-minded?

651
00:30:53,240 --> 00:30:54,240
There are many people today.

652
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:56,240
If others see it, it's great.

653
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:02,240
Will you tell others?

654
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
It's not a gentleman's fault.

655
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,240
Of course I won't tell others.

656
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,240
Thank you.

657
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,240
I know it's you who went to Li Bu to investigate the scroll.

658
00:31:17,240 --> 00:31:21,240
I can go to the court to see His Majesty.

659
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,240
You don't have to thank me.

660
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:27,240
I should take care of General An and Wei Jun.

661
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,240
Prince Qin is so serious.

662
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:36,240
I'm so proud of him.

663
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:42,240
Li Lai, let's go.

664
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:48,240
Come here.

665
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,240
The thing is that I bought it from the imperial market.

666
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:54,240
Why didn't I see it?

667
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:03,240
Li Lai, don't bother.

668
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:23,240
Miss Cui.

669
00:32:24,240 --> 00:32:25,240
Prince Qin.

670
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,240
I'll go out after the betrothal ceremony.

671
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:29,400
I can send Miss Cui away.

672
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,200
Thank you, Your Highness.

673
00:32:34,680 --> 00:32:35,760
Miss Cui won

674
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,440
the real thing

675
00:32:36,440 --> 00:32:37,360
when she was stealing the treasure.

676
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:39,080
I was so surprised.

677
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:40,720
You're too much.

678
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:42,320
Those are just

679
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,640
fun tricks.

680
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
If Miss Cui wasn't here,

681
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,280
how could she win

682
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,280
the gold medal?

683
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,480
But you have good taste.

684
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:51,560
That's why you can win.

685
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:00,120
None of your business.

686
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,600
Didn't that determine Miss Cui?

687
00:33:11,800 --> 00:33:12,320
Your Highness.

688
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:20,760
Miss Gu,

689
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:22,120
are you alright?

690
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,360
I need smiley,

691
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:27,360
while mylaw uses magic so you may

692
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,320
What do you have for dinner tomorrow?

693
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,880
A rose-flavored cherry blossom.

694
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Grandma said it was delicious.

695
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:32,640
She asked me to eat it.

696
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:34,280
Since she likes it,

697
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:36,160
I'll ask her to make more for her.

698
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:37,440
It's a good idea to make a good meal

699
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
at the wedding ceremony

700
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,800
on the weekend.

701
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,120
I think tomorrow will be a good day.

702
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:43,920
Why don't I go to the wedding party

703
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,040
with Miss Cui tomorrow?

704
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,120
You're welcome.

705
00:33:47,560 --> 00:33:48,560
But...

706
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,160
I'll go to the temple tomorrow.

707
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,520
Then I'll go with you.

708
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,320
Your Highness.

709
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:56,400
Your Highness.

710
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,360
I hope Your Highness

711
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:00,600
will be able to tell me about you.

712
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:02,800
That's it.

713
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:04,080
I'll go to the temple with you tomorrow.

714
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,280
I'll go to see Father first.

715
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:10,520
It's settled.

716
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:12,480
I'll send someone to your mansion tomorrow morning.

717
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,800
Miss Cui is so great.

718
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,680
She even returned Luo Yang to the court.

719
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:34,480
Indeed.

720
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,960
Dong Du and Xichang Jin are in support.

721
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,160
Now this situation

722
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,480
is a disaster for her.

723
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,280
I'm afraid

724
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,080
it's meaningless to be a traitor.

725
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,280
Is that not the idea of General Cui?

726
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:54,760
I think

727
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:57,480
it's the leader of Cui Ling.

728
00:34:58,000 --> 00:34:59,240
He went to the temple

729
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:00,600
and returned to Dong Du.

730
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:01,880
So

731
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,160
he's afraid that

732
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,800
he can

733
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,720
do anything for the prince.

734
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,160
Then Miss Cui

735
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:15,440
wants to be the crown princess?

736
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:20,040
Crown princess?

737
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:21,800
I think

738
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,760
it's hard for the crown prince to be annoying.

739
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,680
However, who would have cared

740
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:29,560
what kind of trouble crown prince had?

741
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:33,080
One who's past the age can takeоды

742
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,320
and are busy edition

743
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,640
as a young lady.

744
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,920
Miss Cui is so��� Excellent.

745
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:47,080
He's aỏu opposite the superior one.

746
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:49,240
You might think

747
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:50,880
If a person who is so foolish

748
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:54,040
and really does what he says

749
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,080
it's a pity.

750
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:02,400
Your Highness.

751
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:10,080
Jin Niang.

752
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:15,240
I brought you into the palace from your home.

753
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:34,700
I've been a chairman of The

754
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:48,240
I will have a chance to be rich.

755
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,240
Your Highness, I know

756
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:00,240
how hard it is for you.

757
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,240
When I arrive at the underground,

758
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,240
I will tell the crown prince in person

759
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:12,240
that I have tried my best.

760
00:37:15,240 --> 00:37:17,240
I have seen a person who is responsible for the marriage

761
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,240
of the crown prince.

762
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:23,240
Even if I am cursed by the people in the capital,

763
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:26,240
I will not be able to guess.

764
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,240
But, Jinniang,

765
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,240
I don't even recognize myself.

766
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:45,240
It's a word

767
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:48,240
that is written on the history book.

768
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,240
Maybe it will be a curse.

769
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:55,240
But I have done so much.

770
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,240
I don't know who I am.

771
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,240
Your Highness,

772
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:08,240
please cry.

773
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:10,240
Please cry.

774
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,240
No.

775
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,240
Since I became the crown princess,

776
00:38:19,240 --> 00:38:20,240
I have told myself

777
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:23,240
that I can't be soft and tired anymore.

778
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:28,240
I can't forget

779
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:32,240
that I was the crown princess of the imperial court.

780
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,240
I will be the crown prince of the imperial court.

781
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:46,240
Last night,

782
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,240
I heard that

783
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,240
the 17 wolves were hunting in the yard.

784
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,240
I guess they didn't sleep for a long time.

785
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:53,240
They are blind.

786
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,240
It's their duty to sleep.

787
00:38:55,240 --> 00:38:56,240
But,

788
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,240
isn't Miss Cui in the theater?

789
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,240
Can't they be blind anymore?

790
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,240
They are blind no matter what.

791
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:03,240
You don't understand.

792
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,240
You do.

793
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:05,240
You touch the girl's hand.

794
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,240
Then you do.

795
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,240
You touch your girl's hand?

796
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:08,240
I do.

797
00:39:08,240 --> 00:39:09,240
I do.

798
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:10,240
Enough.

799
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,240
Drink it.

800
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,240
Senior sister,

801
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,240
Senior sister,

802
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:17,240
where are you going so early?

803
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,240
I am going to the theater.

804
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:21,240
Didn't you say

805
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,240
you were going to send Miss Cui a high school?

806
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,240
Who are you going to?

807
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:26,240
Are you going personally?

808
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:28,240
You go.

809
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,240
Fine.

810
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,240
I shouldn't ask.

811
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:32,240
Senior sister,

812
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,240
do you have anything

813
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:34,240
to send to Miss Cui?

814
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:36,240
No.

815
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:39,240
Come.

816
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:42,240
Why did she

817
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,240
send something to Miss Gu

818
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:44,240
but didn't send something to Miss Cui?

819
00:39:45,240 --> 00:39:46,240
You ask me.

820
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,240
Who am I going to ask?

821
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,240
You don't know.

822
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,240
Come and have some food.

823
00:40:08,240 --> 00:40:09,240
I have met Prince Qi.

824
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,240
Where is your Miss?

825
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,240
I made an appointment with her

826
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,240
for the Tongyou Cicada.

827
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,240
Our Miss

828
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,240
went out early in the morning.

829
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:23,240
She specially packed her bags last night

830
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,240
and said

831
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:27,240
she had to go out for three times.

832
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,240
She also said

833
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:29,240
she shouldn't take anyone there.

834
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,240
So she could show her sincerity.

835
00:40:31,240 --> 00:40:32,240
She didn't even let me

836
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,240
see her.

837
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,240
She said

838
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
she was going to the theater.

839
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,240
She didn't even let me

840
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:37,240
see her.

841
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:39,240
But she specially asked me

842
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,240
to wait for Prince Qi

843
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:41,240
in the house

844
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,240
and apologize to him.

845
00:40:43,240 --> 00:40:44,240
I am so sorry

846
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:45,240
that I let you run away.

847
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,240
It's okay.

848
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:52,240
I will go to the Cicada.

849
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:55,240
Take care, Your Highness.

850
00:41:06,240 --> 00:41:07,240
Your Highness.

851
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:15,240
It's easy to look at.

852
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:17,240
Why is it so hard to look at?

853
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,240
Okay.

854
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:34,240
Why are you here?

855
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:37,240
I was thinking

856
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:39,240
to come out and walk.

857
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:40,240
But I came here.

858
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:42,240
I think

859
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:43,240
she is not self-righteous.

860
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,240
I didn't expect

861
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
to meet you here.

862
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:53,240
I don't want to go to the Cicada.

863
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,240
I know.

864
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:02,240
Since you met her,

865
00:42:03,240 --> 00:42:04,240
Shi Qi Lang,

866
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:06,240
can you promise me

867
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,240
to be with me for a day?

868
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Just for a day.

869
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,240
You are not Prince Qin.

870
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:15,240
I am not Miss Cui either.

871
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:18,240
I have no worries.

872
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:20,240
I will be happy for a day.

873
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,240
Okay?

874
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Okay.

875
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:29,240
I promise you.

876
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,240
Do you remember

877
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:50,240
you promised me

878
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:52,240
that if one day

879
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:54,240
the world will be peaceful

880
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,240
and you will be with me

881
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,240
for a full day?

882
00:42:58,240 --> 00:42:59,240
Bai Ying.

883
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:01,240
Take her to the Cicada.

884
00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:03,240
We will be together

885
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,240
for a full day.

886
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:06,240
I will.

887
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,240
If you say so,

888
00:43:13,240 --> 00:43:14,240
I will be happy.

889
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,240
Maybe I can't say it.

890
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:21,240
But I hope

891
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,240
I can be with you for a day.

892
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:24,240
Even if it's only 12 o'clock,

893
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,240
we will not think about anything.

894
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,240
Be happy

895
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:31,240
and have no worries for a day.

896
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:34,240
Okay?

897
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:44,240
Okay.

898
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,240
I promise you.

899
00:43:47,240 --> 00:43:49,240
We will be together for a full day.

900
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,240
We will be together for a full day.

901
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:57,240
We will be together for a full day.

902
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,240
We will be together for a full night.

903
00:44:01,240 --> 00:44:02,240
We will be together for a full day.

904
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:06,240
You used to say

905
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,240
you would be happy

906
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:10,240
if you could meet me earlier.

907
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:11,240
I think so too.

908
00:44:12,240 --> 00:44:13,240
If I could meet you earlier,

909
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:15,240
I would take you to Yingzhou

910
00:44:15,240 --> 00:44:16,240
to see the flowers

911
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,240
and the little people.

912
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,240
Don't say that.

913
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,240
Let's start the ceremony today.

914
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:46,240
Okay?

915
00:45:14,240 --> 00:45:15,240
The spring breeze is so beautiful.

916
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:16,240
The autumn water is so beautiful.

917
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,240
It's so beautiful.

918
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:21,240
I remember that

919
00:45:21,240 --> 00:45:22,240
when I was in the old manor,

920
00:45:23,240 --> 00:45:24,240
every autumn day,

921
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,240
my wife would always hug me

922
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:26,240
and play with me.

923
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,240
And she would bake me lamb every day.

924
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:30,240
I'm so hungry.

925
00:45:34,240 --> 00:45:35,240
I'll get you some fish for the summer.

926
00:45:36,240 --> 00:45:37,240
I'll get you some fish for the summer.

927
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:39,240
I'll get you some fish for the summer.

928
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,240
I'll get you some fish for the summer.

929
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,240
I'll get you some fish for the summer.

930
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:45,240
Okay.

931
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,240
Mr. Shi,

932
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:48,240
there's a big fish over there.

933
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,240
Over there.

934
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:55,240
Mr. Shi.

935
00:45:59,240 --> 00:46:00,240
Two.

936
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,240
I didn't expect my mom would win.

937
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:03,240
She can do nothing but play with her eyes

938
00:46:03,240 --> 00:46:04,240
and get into the town.

939
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:06,240
She can't even handle a fish.

940
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:08,240
I didn't expect our Mr. Shi

941
00:46:08,240 --> 00:46:09,240
would catch a fish

942
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:10,240
after spending so much time

943
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,240
with me.

944
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:14,240
Come on.

945
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,240
There's a fish behind you.

946
00:46:15,240 --> 00:46:16,240
Behind you.

947
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,240
Mr. Shi.

948
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:23,240
Hurry up.

949
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:38,240
How is it?

950
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,240
Is it good?

951
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,240
Mr. Shi,

952
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:42,240
even the fish you baked is so good.

953
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:43,240
It's not a real dish.

954
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:46,240
I'm so excited

955
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,240
to see you compliment me.

956
00:46:47,240 --> 00:46:48,240
I've never thought about it.

957
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,240
I'm not complimenting you.

958
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:51,240
I'm complimenting myself.

959
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:53,240
Compliment yourself?

960
00:46:53,240 --> 00:46:54,240
Yes.

961
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:55,240
Look.

Am I?

966
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:02,240
You're the best

967
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:03,240

Of course.
