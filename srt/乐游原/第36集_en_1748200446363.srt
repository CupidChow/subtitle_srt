1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,180
We will wait until we are all trueEL

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,600
Okay, I will think about it

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,280
Thank you

4
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,120
Today,

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,480
we met on a馳唉

6
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:16,860
We are not that young

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,100
I feel like a earthworm

8
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:21,020
Start time

9
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:23,300
бы

10
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:25,860
It is tired

11
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:26,360
It Hoş

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:28,640
There are so many wafts

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,200
to get rid of the fishy smell.

14
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:31,680
Yes.

15
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,800
There's fire under the pot.

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:34,880
When you cook meat,

17
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,080
you must keep it in a cool place.

18
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:37,040
If so,

19
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,240
you won't be the master.

20
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,360
Miss,

21
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,120
you must eat more today.

22
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,800
The farmers haven't eaten well.

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,120
They are all thin.

24
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,040
You must eat more.

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,560
Come on.

26
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,600
The meat here is cooked.

27
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,200
Eat.

28
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,040
Shi Qi Lang,

29
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,120
the weather is too cold.

30
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,120
Why don't we go back?

31
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:14,320
I told him

32
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:16,360
I would stay in the cool place for the night.

33
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,000
He pretended to be a horse.

34
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,960
He doesn't care about the appearance.

35
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:20,960
Tell me.

36
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:23,080
Should I go back later?

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,400
Shi Qi Lang,

38
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:26,640
I didn't understand.

39
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,680
You said the crown princess doesn't care about it?

40
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,760
Why do you still go back here?

41
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:32,960
I'll go back later.

42
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,400
I really don't know why Tao Zi likes it.

43
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,400
He said he likes me

44
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,400
like this.

45
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:42,680
Yes, that's right.

46
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,520
There are many things to love.

47
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Silly.

48
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,560
Silly people are silly.

49
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,720
Tao Zi likes me.

50
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,440
But he is my husband.

51
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:52,760
Shi Qi Lang,

52
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:53,840
you really don't want to go back?

53
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,920
No.

54
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:56,920
If you don't want to go back,

55
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,160
I'll go back first.

56
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,440
Tao Zi told me

57
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:00,360
he made me

58
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,880
a new dish that I've never eaten.

59
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,080
He said I'd go back and eat it together.

60
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,240
Go, go, go.

61
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Wait.

62
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,640
They all know

63
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:12,520
you went to see the Gu Liang Emperor with me.

64
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,040
When you went back,

65
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:15,040
they found out

66
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,400
I left from Gu Liang Emperor.

67
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,320
Then I left.

68
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,480
Then I would stay here for the night.

69
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,440
Yes.

70
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,680
Shi Qi Lang,

71
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:24,640
you still think about him.

72
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Let's go.

73
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:41,560
Your Highness.

74
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:45,040
Have you ever taken a chopstick?

75
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,080
No.

76
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,680
Didn't you use dinner at Gu Liang Emperor?

77
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:52,840
What?

78
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,320
He didn't

79
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:55,400
eat well

80
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,600
without telling you?

81
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,280
That's not good.

82
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,080
Tao Zi,

83
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,040
go to the Gu Liang Emperor.

84
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,680
I want to ask him

85
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,960
how he was

86
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,000
the crown prince.

87
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,040
Yes.

88
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,800
You can't go.

89
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Tao Zi, go out.

90
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,720
I'll wait for you in the hotel.

91
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,400
Yes.

92
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,120
What's wrong with you?

93
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:31,000
Even if Gu Liang Emperor

94
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,080
didn't serve you well,

95
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,680
I still can't ask him?

96
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,120
I want to ask you

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,120
why you were angry.

98
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,920
Is it because I went to Gu Liang Emperor

99
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:38,960
to have dinner with him?

100
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:40,960
Or I came back late?

101
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,600
Angry?

102
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,480
Why do you think I'm angry?

103
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:46,720
If you're not angry,

104
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:47,240
why did you

105
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,160
ask Gu Liang Emperor

106
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,560
for trouble?

107
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,720
And you want to tell him to come and ask?

108
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:52,600
Have you forgotten?

109
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,360
I'm the crown princess.

110
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,000
In the Eastern Palace,

111
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,800
the Liang Emperor

112
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,000
didn't serve you well.

113
00:03:58,600 --> 00:03:59,800
Of course, I should ask

114
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:00,600
the crown princess.

115
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,480
As the saying goes,

116
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
you're a monk and you're in the middle of the day.

117
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,880
Since I'm the crown princess now,

118
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,920
I'll do it.

119
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,240
You didn't want to be the crown prince before,

120
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,560
but now you're doing well.

121
00:04:17,720 --> 00:04:18,720
As the crown prince,

122
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,480
you're trying to

123
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,040
disperse the imperial court.

124
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You're trying to turn my father

125
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,000
from a general

126
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:31,000
into an old man who's a puppet.

127
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,200
Isn't it just to

128
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,200
disperse the imperial court

129
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,720
and delay the rebellion?

130
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,280
Ying,

131
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,200
I can't help it.

132
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,120
You can go back.

133
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,240
I need to rest.

134
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,720
Where should I go?

135
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,320
This is Chengluan Hall.

136
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:52,680
Like you said,

137
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,720
you sit in the river and spend the day.

138
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,160
You're the crown princess now.

139
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,640
You should be in the middle of the day.

140
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,560
Your Highness has your own business.

141
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,720
You were just married.

142
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,560
You slept in my place

143
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:06,880
and did everything you could.

144
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,200
Why are you sick?

145
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
You can't sleep well.

146
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,720
I can't sleep well either.

147
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,280
You're trying to drive me away?

148
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,120
Yes.

149
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:19,000
I'm trying to drive you away.

150
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:21,440
I'm not.

151
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm not just trying to save you.

152
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,120
I need to sleep here.

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,360
Your Highness,

154
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,680
even if you don't want to leave,

155
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:36,800
I can't sleep well tonight.

156
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,000
Be reasonable.

157
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,560
I won't抵 lightly.

158
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,120
My stately voice represents

159
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:32,880
a delightful perfection.

160
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:35,980
My lijun and Xueick

161
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,620
have common origins,

162
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,680
but I have experienced

163
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,600
an extreme worthy name.

164
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,780
And I want to pay tribute to my highest status called

165
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,660
Rapunzel's任,"Theína From Chvine."

166
00:06:50,780 --> 00:06:54,880
She personally works forégén shortly after she was born.

167
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,400
Unwilling to admit and escape this iciing

168
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:08,000
I remember key hearts

169
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,960
Light appeal graced with ice

170
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,780
Are ourbelievableили

171
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:24,660
Our stars areó

172
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,820
What?

173
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,780
That's really...

174
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:30,280
Unbelievable.

175
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,000
Help...

176
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:47,800
Despite the Amulet is a six-pack tail

177
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,400
are at peace chosen.

178
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,620
Amulet is too heavy for you to rock.

179
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:52,900
How would you...

180
00:07:52,900 --> 00:08:05,160
The Carnation

181
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:09,320
Is it true.

182
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,460
Didn't you come along.

183
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,500
Yes.

184
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,160
Let's...

185
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:22,580
Your Majesty, don't you have to put your words on the board?

186
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,900
Maybe it's a small matter.

187
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,900
Small matter?

188
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
I'll tell you the truth.

189
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:37,900
Actually, you don't have to mind it.

190
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,900
Anyway, once I'm pregnant,

191
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,900
I'll kill you and let my son have a few.

192
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,900
In this way, I'll be the Empress Dowager.

193
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:56,900
What? You think you're being fooled again?

194
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,900
But you didn't lose anything.

195
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,900
Your Highness.

196
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,900
Your Highness.

197
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:33,900
You're here.

198
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,900
What's the matter with the morning sign?

199
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,900
How is Mu Xianhe?

200
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:42,900
He didn't cover up for himself.

201
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,900
He's just this person.

202
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,900
He lost.

203
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
He's just this person.

204
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,900
He's just this person.

205
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,900
He's just this person.

206
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,900
He lost.

207
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,900
He's just this person.

208
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:54,900
He lost.

209
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,900
He lost.

210
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,900
He lost.

211
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,900
He lost.

212
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:59,900
No matter what the official or the money,

213
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,900
he won't do anything.

214
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
It seems that Mu Xianhe

215
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,900
wants to touch him.

216
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,900
It's not a matter of consciousness.

217
00:10:10,900 --> 00:10:11,900
Your Highness.

218
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:14,900
Your Highness.

219
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:16,900
Your Highness.

220
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:18,900
Why are you dressed like this?

221
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:21,900
I thought you said

222
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
the matter about the接觸 is a little vague.

223
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,900
Then we can go and investigate it today.

224
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:26,900
Yes.

225
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,900
There's a接觸 person who's been pretending to be a Western Liang.

226
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,900
He's been in the Western Changjing recently.

227
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:36,900
It's said that he's the person who's the one who's holding the hand of the接觸.

228
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,900
But this news isn't sure if it's true or not.

229
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,900
It's better to see this person in person.

230
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,900
Really?

231
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:52,900
No wonder the Crown Prince Consort is so anxious today.

232
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:53,900
She's dressed up by herself.

233
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:57,900
I gave the Crown Prince Consort a tea and she looked so serious.

234
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:58,900
Although she's covered in paper,

235
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,900
she has several spots on her neck.

236
00:11:01,900 --> 00:11:05,900
I'm afraid the Western Liang will be mad at Liu Xiangdian.

237
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,900
She's a fairy.

238
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,900
No one knows that the Crown Prince

239
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,900
didn't even have a look on her face.

240
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,900
One is for the Crown Prince.

241
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:14,900
The other is for the person who loves the Crown Prince.

242
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:16,900
The person who loves the Crown Prince is different.

243
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:20,900
Then the maid said that the Western Liang was made by His Majesty.

244
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,900
The Crown Prince Consort is the person who's wearing the raincoat.

245
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,900
She was kneeling before the Royal Highness for a whole day.

246
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:31,900
She was blushing and she was crying.

247
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:36,900
The one who was given the Crown Prince a wet coat.

248
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,900
The one who was the person who loved the Crown Prince.

249
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,900
Can that be the same?

250
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:46,900
Your Highness.

251
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,900
Your Highness, please stop embroidering.

252
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,900
Even if you're done embroidering,

253
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:57,900
the Crown Prince Consort won't let you see His Highness.

254
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:59,900
She's such a bad person.

255
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,900
His Highness is so poor and she's been harming him.

256
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:03,900
Shut up!

257
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,900
Yes.

258
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,900
Your Highness.

259
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:08,900
Liang Ding.

260
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:13,900
It's just that Liang Ding should think of a way to do it.

261
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,900
Otherwise, His Highness the Crown Prince wouldn't come again.

262
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,900
I'll punish you to death!

263
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:24,900
I'm here to inform Liang Ding that I hope Liang Ding can recover soon.

264
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:33,900
Your Highness, this Mu Xianhe loves to eat the dishes at Fengyang Restaurant.

265
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,900
He comes here every day when he has money.

266
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,900
He comes here every day when he has no money.

267
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,900
But he'll give him a memorial on the cabinet.

268
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,900
When he has money, he'll come with him.

269
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:41,900
Let's go.

270
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,900
Let's go to the wedding hall.

271
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,900
Your Highness, please come inside.

272
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,900
The dishes upstairs are all ready for you.

273
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,900
Put the orange in the crab meat, crab yolk and crab cake.

274
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,900
Then, steam it on the stove.

275
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:53,900
Then, steam it on the stove.

276
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:56,900
The best crab today is at least seven taels.

277
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,900
It's full of meat.

278
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,900
What do you think?

279
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,900
Not bad.

280
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,900
The way you eat crab is so clever.

281
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:02,900
I've never cooked it before.

282
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,900
If it's not good, please forgive me.

283
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:07,900
As long as the fire is right, it's fine.

284
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:08,900
It's not bad.

285
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,900
Go.

286
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,900
Okay. Let's go and sit down.

287
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:15,900
Crab meat and orange.

288
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,900
How did you know the way to eat this strange food?

289
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,900
How did you know?

290
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:21,900
I don't understand.

291
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,900
Didn't you say that

292
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:24,900
Mu Xianhe is a person who loves to eat?

293
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,900
I remember.

294
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,900
The late Crown Prince is also a person who loves to eat.

295
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,900
So I asked the people in the kitchen.

296
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:32,900
They knew some foreign things and some unknown things.

297
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:40,900
Miss, the one who made the business

298
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,900
is here today.

299
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,900
Are you all right?

300
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:48,900
Come up here later.

301
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,900
Everyone, please come in.

302
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,900
No, the upstairs is a little bit too much.

303
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,900
Okay, please come upstairs.

304
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:12,900
Thank you, Niancheng.

305
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Mu Xianhe.

306
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:22,900
It smells so good.

307
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:29,900
Everyone, I'm here in Wenxiang.

308
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:32,900
May I have a bite?

309
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,900
Just a bite.

310
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,900
Mr. Mu.

311
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:40,900
This is a guest.

312
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:41,900
Please.

313
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,900
This is Mr. Mu, right?

314
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:44,900
The meeting is in the middle of the night.

315
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,900
Then this county of Xianyang will give you a share.

316
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,900
Then I won't be polite.

317
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,900
It's so delicious.

318
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:05,900
Who did you think this thing was?

319
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
You put the fresh crab meat in the soup

320
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:10,900
and then put it on the chicken.

321
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:13,900
It's so delicious.

322
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:20,900
You two should be called Pei.

323
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
No.

324
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,900
Li.

325
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
No.

326
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,900
You are called Gu.

327
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:32,900
Gu.

328
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:33,900
Gu.

329
00:15:34,900 --> 00:15:36,900
Why do you think so?

330
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,900
People who can think of such a method

331
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,900
can't be called a rich man.

332
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,900
So I guess you are called Pei.

333
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,900
But I think

334
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,900
the Pei family should know nothing about

335
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,900
the five different things.

336
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,900
So I guess you are called Li.

337
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,900
But I think about it again.

338
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,900
Li's family died in the same way.

339
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,900
And Xinhuang

340
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,900
didn't know how much she loves to eat.

341
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,900
So you are called Gu.

342
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:06,900
There is a secret to love in the family.

343
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:09,900
So there is such a method.

344
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,900
Then you must have

345
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,900
a good chef, right?

346
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,900
It's a pity that you died early.

347
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,900
The chef in the family

348
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,900
is so good at this.

349
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,900
It's a pity.

350
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
What about the rest?

351
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:35,900
How many are left?

352
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,900
Only three or four.

353
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,900
But there are three special chefs.

354
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,900
One is good at cooking fish.

355
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:44,900
The other is good at cooking fish soup.

356
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,900
The other is good at cooking meat.

357
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,900
If I can go to your house to cook,

358
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,900
I can cook it with my spirit.

359
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,900
Chajun Laternel

360
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:03,900
The same chajun

361
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:07,180
Mщima

362
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,900
Miss.

363
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,320
The

364
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,300
businesswoman were we소

365
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,820
relatives?

366
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:20,900
Yes.

367
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,900
She is called Wu Yan in Galantin.

368
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,900
She works for someone very carefully.

369
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,900
I saw her when I met

370
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:26,900
her in Yingzhou.

371
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:28,900
Others can't recognize her.

372
00:17:28,900 --> 00:17:29,460
Yes, madam.

373
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,060
Why do you want me to go into Xicheng?

374
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:38,380
It wouldn't be good.

375
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,020
It's delicious.

376
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,940
It's a good cooked dish.

377
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:47,760
Thanks for your kindness.

378
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,320
Farewell.

379
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:51,760
Come again.

380
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:00,100
He just let him go?

381
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,340
Don't worry.

382
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:03,420
He can't stand

383
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:05,740
and therefore gain no understanding.

384
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:19,400
His

385
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:20,500
spitting those words.

386
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:25,760
Dr. Chao,

387
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:30,300
What can I do for you?

388
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,820
The fish is good today.

389
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,100
I need to keep one alive.

390
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:33,940
I'll take it with me.

391
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,900
You don't need to go.

392
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,660
The guests are really good.

393
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,340
The fish from the south.

394
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,460
To be honest,

395
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,700
in the whole Western capital,

396
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,140
except Fengying Tower,

397
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,900
you only take as much money as you want.

398
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,620
I'm afraid you didn't find the money.

399
00:18:45,940 --> 00:18:46,940
I'll go now.

400
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,540
I remember

401
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,100
you don't like fish.

402
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,980
Some people like it.

403
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:57,500
I don't like some people.

404
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,540
I don't like others

405
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,180
when I eat it.

406
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,180
The meal is really good.

407
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,860
It's still good.

408
00:19:12,020 --> 00:19:12,860
Exactly.

409
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:16,860
Dear guests,

410
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:19,620
you said you wanted to take one of the fish

411
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,820
and go home to cook fish.

412
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:22,820
You don't need to go.

413
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,860
We'll go home ourselves.

414
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:24,460
Yes.

415
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:26,780
But there's only one fish left.

416
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:27,980
Another guest

417
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,100
really wants it.

418
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,620
Can you give him a price

419
00:19:30,780 --> 00:19:31,740
for a lifetime?

420
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,260
Please give him the fish.

421
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:34,020
No.

422
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,500
I'll take the fish.

423
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,460
I'll take it.

424
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:37,340
What?

425
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,700
Can't we pay the price?

426
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:40,500
The guest said he wants it.

427
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,780
He doesn't want to give it.

428
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:43,620
How about this?

429
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,580
Take me there.

430
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,500
I'll tell them.

431
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:46,500
Okay.

432
00:19:50,620 --> 00:19:51,700
Dear guests,

433
00:19:51,860 --> 00:19:53,340
the guest who wants to cook fish

434
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,660
is really sincere.

435
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,580
He wants to ask for it himself.

436
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:58,420
If we give him the fish,

437
00:19:58,580 --> 00:19:59,900
that's too dangerous.

438
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:04,340
Dear guests,

439
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:05,540
I know

440
00:20:05,700 --> 00:20:06,700
I shouldn't just mention it,

441
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:07,620
but both of you

442
00:20:07,780 --> 00:20:09,300
will grant me the fish.

443
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,220
I'd like to take the vouchers

444
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:13,460
and bring another crowd.

445
00:20:13,540 --> 00:20:15,500
And I would guard my debts at home,

446
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,980
so I can't take the fish here.

447
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,940
I'm worried that we may inflationarily go home.

448
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,180
Did you teach me to do that?

449
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:30,540
Isn't it that much?

450
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:32,740
Just billy sulky.

451
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,860
Is laity a part of your family's budget?

452
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:42,540
After покупate....

453
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,740
Ying Zhou helped Kw venally

454
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:46,180
to the fire broke out from the imperial army at Yixia,

455
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,440
and the armors,

456
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,140
avenged its powers in court,

457
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,980
that was a great opportunity

458
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,140
to assist Ying Zhou.

459
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:56,260
just to stop your tactic.

460
00:20:58,220 --> 00:20:59,500
Even the Immortal Sword Tribe

461
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:01,260
is handed over to him in the Western Super fats clinical agency.

462
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,300
Lee Ni

463
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:03,420
has Romanic script to

464
00:21:04,140 --> 00:21:06,140
ask my brothers whether it will make an impact

465
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:09,380
or build the device to take advantage of all intentions.

466
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,860
As soon as the imperial decree disarms

467
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:13,860
without Canad guilt,

468
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:16,180
I will taken the Minrits,

469
00:21:16,820 --> 00:21:18,140
killing Lee Ni at that time.

470
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,060
I sent Crown Prince

471
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,180
to force the Immortal Sword Team close.

472
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:24,180
You choose the one who likes I.

473
00:21:24,460 --> 00:21:26,300
Or do you think Chen all용

474
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,620
is a13 years old singer?

475
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:31,100
I hope no one's

476
00:21:31,420 --> 00:21:32,660
are mad at me.

477
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,260
I'll have you

478
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,140
be quiet.

479
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:38,140
Yeah.

480
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,100
Four people

481
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,060
everyday.

482
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:45,020
I can't find them?

483
00:21:47,060 --> 00:21:48,300
I promise you that

484
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,940
I'll find them too

485
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,300
because I want you

486
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:52,700
I beg you.

487
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:06,880
Yang Emmята,

488
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,160
to you,

489
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,060
Madam

490
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,220
is the mother ofύ

491
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:18,360
Vice Madam Ni is off to a fishing boat.

492
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,760
I don't think it'll return.

493
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,520
Don't worry.

494
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:28,800
This is over for you.

495
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,800
I'll keep it as a token.

496
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:32,360
Your Highness,

497
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:37,100
here it comes.

498
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,400
It was sent out by the Envoy of Fruitinya.

499
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,400
Your Highness is a very wise and thoughtful person.

500
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,400
If you do this,

501
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,400
you'll only make her look down on me.

502
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,400
Madam said that you don't have to be so modest.

503
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:55,400
The people in the family, including the Prime Minister,

504
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
all mean this.

505
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,400
They said that you can't stand up in the Eastern Palace

506
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:01,400
and that you've wasted so much effort.

507
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Can you let the future emperor be called a prince?

508
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,400
It's all up to you.

509
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:08,400
This is not a matter of self-reliance.

510
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,400
I said no, but you did.

511
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,400
Yes.

512
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
This is a very thoughtful person.

513
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,400
You said that you only know how to cook in the mansion.

514
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,400
I think this is too much.

515
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Is this mansion difficult?

516
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,400
It's difficult because of the five different styles.

517
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,400
This is a great talent.

518
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,400
It's hard to get the right reason in the world.

519
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,400
I'm a family member, and I don't know these things.

520
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Since Mr. Mu said it right,

521
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,400
then of course it's good.

522
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:03,400
You're not a family member.

523
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,400
You're a businessman.

524
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:09,400
And you're young and well-mannered.

525
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,040
What did Mr. Oliver have to do with that?

526
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:20,400
You're still a drinking- festival eater.

527
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,900
That's mean you are always old these days,

528
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:24,400
and can easily work with others.

529
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,400
Although you're such a big change,

530
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
you didn't deserve it.

531
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:29,400
But your cooking capital seem to be followed

532
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
according to your talent,

533
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
which can be a great projectee.

534
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
Then why did he say that

535
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,400
he's young and well-mannered?

536
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,400
What about those people?

537
00:24:37,920 --> 00:24:39,520
Although you avoid the identity,

538
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:41,120
the rapeseed and the garlic

539
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,520
had to come down

540
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,440
against it.

541
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:47,580
Just take it.

542
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,080
Although every time

543
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:49,600
she sat on your side,

544
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:52,040
you do not

545
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,720
show that she was a

546
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:55,960
IG even once.

547
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:56,840
But you makeática

548
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,300
even more Speak-in-a-l Requiem.

549
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,940
So were you not

550
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,080
flaps the table

551
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,840
as the ''BelIE''?

552
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:03,520
Enough.

553
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:05,280
salt

554
00:25:06,560 --> 00:25:07,480
It's cold.

555
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,260
Do you have

556
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:19,400
many delicious food around your house?

557
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:22,480
Or have you already heard of eating

558
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,760
as if you never saw it?

559
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,160
You know it's useful.

560
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,840
I knew everything would come to you.

561
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:34,160
and take her to the manor.

562
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,680
I'll do my best.

563
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:40,840
Fine.

564
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,480
Tell me.

565
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:43,800
What do you want me to do?

566
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,840
If I can't do it,

567
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:47,320
I won't leave.

568
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,240
I heard that you are good at making magic.

569
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,960
You are like a fairy.

570
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:54,960
You can draw thousands of images.

571
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,760
So I want you to make a magic.

572
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,760
I didn't expect you to be a man

573
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,120
who can make magic.

574
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:04,800
I'm not lying.

575
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,200
The world is in danger.

576
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:09,560
I am only wasting

577
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:11,080
my time to draw magic.

578
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
If you don't take advantage of the luck,

579
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:17,680
you can return to favor.

580
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,800
Fine.

581
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:23,800
I do whatever I want to do.

582
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,120
You are like annatедui.

583
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:27,240
There can be more than a hundred times.

584
00:26:30,280 --> 00:26:31,120
But like us...

585
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,120
It's for a new soldier.

586
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,120
That's why I want to ask Mr. Mu.

587
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:39,120
So who do you want me to show you?

588
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,120
A new soldier.

589
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,120
A male or a female?

590
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:42,120
A male.

591
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:43,120
What's your surname?

592
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,120
Cui.

593
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:48,120
What does Cui do?

594
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,120
He leads the army to fight the general.

595
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,120
Is it the general Cui of Pingliang?

596
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,120
Yes.

597
00:26:58,120 --> 00:27:00,120
If I don't want to be a general,

598
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,120
if I help you,

599
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,120
your chef...

600
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,120
Go to your manor immediately.

601
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:07,120
He'll be here every day.

602
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,120
Three years is enough.

603
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:10,120
Okay.

604
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:12,120
Then it's a deal.

605
00:27:14,120 --> 00:27:16,120
This time, I'll make a decision

606
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,120
to give him a new soldier.

607
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:19,120
I'm willing to do it.

608
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,120
But...

609
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,120
I have one last question.

610
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,120
Sir, please ask.

611
00:27:26,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Are you Li?

612
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:31,120
How is Li?

613
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
What about Li?

614
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:36,120
That's right.

615
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,120
Then I'll take you as your...

616
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,120
wild companion.

617
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
What's wrong?

618
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I always feel that

619
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:51,120
the 17th Prince is hiding something from me.

620
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,120
You forgot how you comforted me last time.

621
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,120
Didn't we agree?

622
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
We should not ask too much

623
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,120
about the things between them.

624
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,120
But he doesn't take me anywhere.

625
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:06,120
Sometimes he goes out with General Pei.

626
00:28:06,120 --> 00:28:07,120
He's busy.

627
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,120
Do you think that

628
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
the Prince doesn't take you out

629
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:12,120
and doesn't tell you

630
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,120
because he doesn't believe you?

631
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:16,120
No.

632
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,120
He won't believe me.

633
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Then it's fine.

634
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:20,120
That's true.

635
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,120
Anyway, I have something to hide from him.

636
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
What do you have to hide from him?

637
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:30,120
What's this?

638
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,120
This is a shop in Xi City.

639
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:37,120
I've been looking around for a long time.

640
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,120
I also ordered a duck to grow.

641
00:28:38,120 --> 00:28:39,120
Although it's not big,

642
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:40,120
it has a good location.

643
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
It's very suitable for business.

644
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:45,120
Didn't you say

645
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,120
you wanted to open a shop?

646
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,120
I bought it for you.

647
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,120
That's great.

648
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
No.

649
00:28:56,120 --> 00:28:57,120
Yes.

650
00:28:57,120 --> 00:29:00,120
Didn't you give me all the money you made?

651
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:02,120
Where did you get the money to buy this shop?

652
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
The wedding of the Shiqing Wolf

653
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,120
has sent us a lot of money.

654
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
I'll use it to buy this shop.

655
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,120
Why don't you think about it?

656
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,120
You brought such a big thing.

657
00:29:17,120 --> 00:29:18,120
Taozi.

658
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
Look.

659
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,120
The Crown Prince and Crown Princess

660
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,120
have already gotten married.

661
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:27,120
When will you marry me?

662
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Is this true?

663
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I have to think about it.

664
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,120
How long do you want to think about it?

665
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,120
I have to think about it

666
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,120
for how long.

667
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:45,120
Can't you give me a short time?

668
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Why are you in a hurry?

669
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,120
I've already said it.

670
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,120
I have to think about it.

671
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,120
Taozi.

672
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,120
Taozi.

673
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:53,120
How long do you want to think about it?

674
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,120
Taozi.

675
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,120
Can't you answer me now?

676
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,120
Of course not.

677
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:57,120
Taozi.

678
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
Your Highness, this cup of wine.

679
00:30:24,120 --> 00:30:25,120
It's too hot and hot.

680
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,120
Don't take the wine with you.

681
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Yes.

682
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,120
Try this mutton cake!

683
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,120
It is happy for my mother.

684
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:55,260
I hope you're that kind of person.

685
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,120
You're about to wiege,

686
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:02,420
I'm sorry for what I did today.

687
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:05,060
Are you all right?

688
00:31:05,060 --> 00:31:06,980
She's already passed away.

689
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,920
I'm not a matureizen,

690
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,720
I should blessings her now.

691
00:31:15,620 --> 00:31:18,820
She's such a cool person.

692
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:19,820
I have to think about it, too.

693
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,660
What are you laughing at?

694
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,060
I'm thinking about it.

695
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:27,460
I don't have to be so anxious to catch my head.

696
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,940
I don't have that either.

697
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,940
But he seems a little anxious these days.

698
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,620
He seems to want to ask me if I thought it through.

699
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:39,500
And he's not afraid to ask me.

700
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:41,700
Then tell me.

701
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:43,060
Such a big thing.

702
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,420
I think carefully.

703
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:45,860
I'm telling you, it's normal.

704
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,820
Yes, it's very normal.

705
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,740
You have to think about it carefully.

706
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,860
Don't be anxious.

707
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:54,500
Let him find the right time.

708
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:18,540
Your Highness.

709
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:19,940
One more glass of wine?

710
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,980
Your drink.

711
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:22,740
Please make.

712
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,660
Your Highness.

713
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:25,820
I don't have to give.

714
00:32:26,140 --> 00:32:26,820
Your Highness.

715
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,180
Your Highness.

716
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:29,000
What's wrong, Your Highness?

717
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:29,540
Your Highness.

718
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:29,940
Come out.

719
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
Your Highness.

720
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,420
Your Highness.

721
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:35,220
Your Highness.

722
00:32:39,380 --> 00:32:39,660
angry.

723
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:40,660
Was it fast?

724
00:32:40,780 --> 00:32:42,460
What did you do to me?

725
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,920
Why are you riding me.

726
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:47,620
What happened?

727
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:48,620
Both of you

728
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,980
were forced by my wife.

729
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,260
I told her that

730
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:53,940
she said she couldn't take the medicine.

731
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,780
But she said you were a little girl.

732
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,940
She told me to put the medicine

733
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:58,940
on the wine cup of the crown prince.

734
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,340
If I didn't listen,

735
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,380
she would help me to persuade my family.

736
00:33:03,860 --> 00:33:05,020
Yuchen.

737
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,540
Yuchen.

738
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:07,620
You.

739
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,340
You are scum.

740
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:11,820
You have made me

741
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:14,260
the only king.

742
00:33:16,020 --> 00:33:17,020
Now,

743
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:19,820
I am a hundred children.

744
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:23,180
A hundred children.

745
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:34,860
What are you doing?

746
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:39,740
What are you doing?

747
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,260
I want to send you off.

748
00:33:47,620 --> 00:33:49,820
What are you doing?

749
00:34:17,620 --> 00:34:18,820
God!

750
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:23,700
God!

751
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,420
What?

752
00:34:38,060 --> 00:34:39,460
How did this happen?

753
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:41,740
It just hadn't enough moment.

754
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:42,820
I lost it.

755
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:44,900
Hence

756
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:46,980
crown prince cannot be at my shooting range again.

757
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:48,860
help me.

758
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:51,580
Now,

759
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,160
I can't be a hostage anymore in the Palace.

760
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,100
Father,

761
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,940
is there anything you can states

762
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:00,440
today?

763
00:35:07,180 --> 00:35:08,380
When I was a palace savior,

764
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,380
the Fu Di Leonist was a greaters in the realm of Heaven.

765
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,900
Father meant

766
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,840
you are not women.

767
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:21,480
Unfortunately, the world is full of losses and losses.

768
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,800
If the weather is not good,

769
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:27,640
he will suddenly die.

770
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:30,760
Your Highness, you are still sad.

771
00:35:30,760 --> 00:35:32,880
You are not able to go back to heaven.

772
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,520
Very good.

773
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:41,720
As long as this matter is not related to our Gu family,

774
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:46,040
then hurry up and let the Crown Prince fly the weather.

775
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:21,640
forbid

776
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:23,400
See you later!

777
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:29,080
I feel very sad after I have been through,

778
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:41,280
but for this cases, I have died of�를

779
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,400
So long

780
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,260
