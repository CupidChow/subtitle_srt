כלi

00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:05,280
Episode 5

3
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,800
The dream I have in my mind

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,160
The wind blows in the broken wind

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,280
See the sky and sea together

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,840
The wind blows in the broken wind

7
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,960
The cold snow in the ice, the cold wind blows in the wind

8
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,480
The moon is singing for you

9
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,040
I will be with you forever

10
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,640
I will be with you forever

11
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,340
We are in theриp Lam

12
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,220
Imagine watching the corresponding性

13
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,260
So small

14
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:53,700
That big

15
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:10,660
2 of them were returnees

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:19,000
at city level

17
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,400
and the two of them are not compatible.

18
00:02:20,960 --> 00:02:21,560
I think

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,120
he is the biggest culprit in Luoyang City.

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,000
Shi Qi Lang,

21
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,560
Luoyang City has sent a secret mission.

22
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,400
I want to see you.

23
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,080
Please.

24
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,600
The Palace of Talisman is so lonely.

25
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
It's really brave.

26
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,280
You are too old-fashioned.

27
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:51,800
I am not a good son.

28
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,720
I am a big son.

29
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,680
You must be Peixian's son.

30
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,640
When I and your father

31
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,000
were fighting against the Yi Luo,

32
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,040
you were still eating milk.

33
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,520
About ten years ago,

34
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,760
when the war broke out,

35
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,080
the single-handed horse was forced to break into the war.

36
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,600
He took the first blow of the Yi Luo King.

37
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,240
Li Ni was young at the time.

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,680
It's just a story.

39
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,600
Now that I see the real man,

40
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,200
I know that the Palace of Talisman is brave.

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,520
It's as good as the story.

42
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,920
Old man,

43
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,520
don't mention the old man.

44
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:30,800
Shi Qi Lang is the young man's brother.

45
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,040
In front of you,

46
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:33,360
how can he be the brother of the brother?

47
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:34,400
Please.

48
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,360
When I heard about the matter of

49
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,280
the Xi Army and the Cui family,

50
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,920
even if Han Li was captured by the Royal Descendant,

51
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,760
why didn't the Jian State

52
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:54,200
get into the Nang State in one go?

53
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:57,120
It's a big deal for the Cui family.

54
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
Our Xi Army

55
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
is not as powerful as the Cui family.

56
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,320
So we can only change the Jian State to Liang State.

57
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,840
I have no choice.

58
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,720
Royal Descendant doesn't want to vent his anger

59
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:13,880
and take the Liang State of the Cui family's burden.

60
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,760
I'm afraid you forgot.

61
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:18,600
Why did I fall into the Liang State?

62
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,560
Royal Descendant

63
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,400
wants to fall into the Liang State.

64
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,920
I know that

65
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:33,680
the Xi Army is lacking in provisions.

66
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:36,480
It's hard to get into the Liang State.

67
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,880
But suddenly,

68
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,960
the Cui family's army is being suspicious.

69
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,440
It's a loss.

70
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,600
Royal Descendant hasn't made it.

71
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,640
Is it something wrong if wrench the Yaon Department

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:54,640
that you think Li Jian used?

73
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:56,560
Although it's Li Jian,

74
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,440
it's true love.

75
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:01,160
The Royal Descendant is in danger.

76
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,560
It's important for him to let go of the Song State

77
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:06,760
and take the power of the Yi King

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,280
and fund the new Feng's talentedッ

79
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:11,180
Could his Song State

80
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:15,320
Suite better than werde du do?

81
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:17,080
aver Intro

82
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:18,320
Can't just say

83
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:23,580
After Young

84
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:30,220
Poison

85
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,680
Have to correct Seattle

86
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,980
Never

87
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,200
But in three days

88
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:38,040
Obey the military

89
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:39,880
Mouse

90
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,160
Get him

91
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:58,680
You've been deceiving your

92
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:02,680
You'll eat•

93
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,300
Fine.

94
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,820
Master.

95
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:12,760
I'll leave first.

96
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:19,320
I've prepared 30 bamboobacks that I have to eat by myself and can take them up to tonight.

97
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,880
I'll stick with the way I wast my manners.

98
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,580
After you said that you have to dip them in cold Ilham grass,

99
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:28,220
you put them back on.

100
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,020
Such a happy A-raft!

101
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:32,640
Thirty adaptions

102
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:35,000
for battles you'd even pull on!

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,160
At ease!

104
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:49,280
Haoli, deep down,

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,640
couldn't believe you'd lost my day!

106
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:56,040
Salvation made him

107
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,480
to M你说,

108
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,680
to쿱萨

109
00:07:03,760 --> 00:07:05,600
who is not the same as the Salutation Army

110
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,480
and is unable to protect Hanli?

111
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,120
Now,

112
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,840
you're sure to fail.

113
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,640
So,

114
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,180
have you

115
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,440
had some clients or leisure talks with us?

116
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:18,900
Toakes,

117
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:20,720
it depends on theuchs.

118
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
percent of the liel

119
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:26,060
you should fight for the moon Tail- And come back

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,680
If I can claim the moon

121
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,600
Then Can the world win

122
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:33,840
Yes

123
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:35,620
But Now the battle is a threat

124
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,280
Prove it

125
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:38,840
but Fortress

126
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,000
more soldiers

127
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,020
Although you are strong

128
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,340
But that is figure

129
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,080
it's still

130
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,380
I also want to put her dead to ease

131
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:53,220
She is Xu Yu's grape Drink

132
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:54,060
You're talking too much.

133
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:55,860
Shi Qi Lang,

134
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,820
you're saying that

135
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,700
Fu Yuan'er is really a good man.

136
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,980
This sword is used to

137
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,140
make a great name for himself.

138
00:08:02,460 --> 00:08:04,220
We don't even have a place to turn.

139
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,140
Fu Yuan'er,

140
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,380
this kind of general

141
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,940
is brave and brave,

142
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:15,220
but only cares about Sun Jing.

143
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,300
What a pity.

144
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,580
Shi Qi Lang,

145
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:21,460
what he just said

146
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,780
is true.

147
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,820
How fake is that?

148
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:28,260
Mr. Lin,

149
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:31,780
I promised to give Fu Yuan'er a letter.

150
00:08:32,460 --> 00:08:33,060
What?

151
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,140
You promised him that you'd go to the Cui family army?

152
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:38,500
He also promised to give Cui family army a letter for me.

153
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:40,780
What are you doing?

154
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,140
Before we even started,

155
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:46,740
we took the advantage of the war

156
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,100
and the power of the capital.

157
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,420
Fu Guo,

158
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,900
you can't go there.

159
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:52,860
I'm Zheng Guo Guo.

160
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,500
Get out of here, you bastard.

161
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,180
Mr. Han,

162
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,540
I want to see Fu Yuan'er.

163
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:57,220
Mr. Fu.

164
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,420
You're a good man.

165
00:08:58,660 --> 00:09:00,300
No one in the tomb is ever in your sight.

166
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,780
I've been in Luoyang for half a month.

167
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,060
You've been sick and unwell.

168
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,020
What do you mean?

169
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:10,460
I've got a secret report.

170
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,260
A few days ago,

171
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,780
you went to the Cui army army

172
00:09:13,780 --> 00:09:16,060
and disbanded Li Ni alone.

173
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,100
Tell me,

174
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,300
are you having a fight

175
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,580
with Li Ni?

176
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:21,980
Yes.

177
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,860
Three days ago,

178
00:09:25,660 --> 00:09:28,380
I did go to the Cui army army

179
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,900
and disbanded Li Ni.

180
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:33,900
Good.

181
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,740
Since you've admitted it,

182
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
hand it over to me.

183
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:39,860
General Fu,

184
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:42,580
you're guarding the military power of Luoyang.

185
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:44,700
If there's any reason

186
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,300
for Li Ni to disband,

187
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:47,780
it's not good for the capital.

188
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:51,660
The capital is

189
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,860
the capital of the capital.

190
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,740
Unless the capital is occupied,

191
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,740
I won't hand it over to you.

192
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,580
You're so cunning!

193
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,380
I see Li Ni

194
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,740
trying to force her to go to the Cui army.

195
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,300
If the two armies

196
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:14,860
disband the army first,

197
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,820
if they join forces,

198
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:21,020
Luoyang will be in a terrible state.

199
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,940
The best way

200
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:28,860
is to let Li Ni

201
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,380
go to the Cui army.

202
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:40,820
If you say so,

203
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,420
you really have a way

204
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:43,340
to let Li Ni

205
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:44,580
defeat the Cui army.

206
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,420
What?

207
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:47,620
What a coincidence!

208
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,460
Li Ni just sent someone to send a letter

209
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,780
saying that the Wei army

210
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,340
will attack the Cui army.

211
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,180
Does the State of Zheng

212
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,540
have the heart to follow me

213
00:10:55,940 --> 00:10:57,700
and go to the city building

214
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,820
to have a look at the trouble?

215
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,460
The service is done.

216
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:04,380
The army is in a mess.

217
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:05,380
The Wei army

218
00:11:05,380 --> 00:11:06,700
will attack the Cui army.

219
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,500
You should be in the back of the army.

220
00:11:08,620 --> 00:11:10,180
Why should my commander be the first to go?

221
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,740
If I don't go there myself,

222
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:13,100
how will Fu Yuan'er believe me?

223
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,340
Moreover,

224
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:16,140
we should let the Cui army

225
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:18,060
take a look at the strength of the army.

226
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:36,940
Report!

227
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,460
The army is all in order.

228
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,540
Kill the Cui army.

229
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,220
Kill the Cui army.

230
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,100
Kill the Cui army.

231
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,780
What are you two fighting?

232
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,900
Didn't Shi Jian'er say that he's a fake?

233
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:30,180
Who are you fighting?

234
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:30,780
Nonsense!

235
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:31,660
Are you fighting yourself?

236
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,540
Who are you fighting against?

237
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,620
Fight them!

238
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:34,620
Go!

239
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,180
Go! Go! Go!

240
00:12:36,180 --> 00:12:36,860
Go!

241
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:38,820
Go!

242
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,060
Go!

243
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:41,780
Go!

244
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,060
Who are you fighting with, eh?

245
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,980
You're even fighting against your grandpa's hand?

246
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,020
Yunhao,

247
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,820
didn't you think

248
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,580
it was all fangirlia?

249
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:07,220
So you Plain andkeen

250
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:08,220
are all like this

251
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:08,940
faintly warming Peacock

252
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,640
yourえてourbage

253
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:12,680
you rascal

254
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,300
you're going to know it all

255
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:17,200
Kill, kill.

256
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:18,920
You...

257
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:39,600
It's you.

258
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:49,060
With this an apprentice sword umpire must be discarded well

259
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,680
No damage

260
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,920
Say it again

261
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,100
Why are you only weary and extremely tired today

262
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,740
But will you say nice things again?

263
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,740
Okay, I'll give you back.

264
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:40,740
Why did they kill you?

265
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:42,740
They are all people who are facing life.

266
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,740
They are trying to fight.

267
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,740
But I have a guess.

268
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,740
Chen Qing Lang!

269
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:48,740
Are you okay?

270
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,740
You got hurt?

271
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,740
You're blind.

272
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,740
Didn't you say you're a fake?

273
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,740
What's going on?

274
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,740
I think the traffic is almost there.

275
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
Search.

276
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,740
Report!

277
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:06,740
How is it?

278
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,740
The time has come.

279
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:09,740
These soldiers have the opportunity to rush to the army.

280
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:10,740
Cui Jia Jun, Cui Gong Zi, Fu Shao.

281
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,740
Cui Jia Jun, the rear-back of the army, is re-enact.

282
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:13,740
Although the Zhen Xi army is weak,

283
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,740
the damage is serious.

284
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:16,740
The enemy is not strong enough to defeat Li Ni.

285
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:17,740
You are taken back to the army.

286
00:15:18,740 --> 00:15:19,740
Good.

287
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,740
General Fu,

288
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,740
they all say Li Ni is a fake.

289
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,740
Cui Jia Jun is brave.

290
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,740
I don't think so.

291
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,740
Why don't we

292
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,740
take the troops to the enemy?

293
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:32,740
It seems like we're all in danger.

294
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,740
What?

295
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:37,740
I promised Li Ni.

296
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,740
As long as she worships Cui Jia Jun,

297
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,740
I'll send her to the Liang Cao.

298
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,740
She's allowed to go around the country.

299
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,740
What?

300
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,740
You let her go around the country?

301
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,740
You let her go around the country?

302
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,740
You're going to rebel?

303
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:53,740
What do you know?

304
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
The country is a capital city.

305
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,740
The land is a human heart.

306
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:01,740
It's not a common place.

307
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:04,740
Although the country is under the military power,

308
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,740
the Liang Cao is in the city.

309
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:08,740
But if Cui Jia Jun and Zhen Xi army

310
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,740
are in the same attack,

311
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:12,740
or the Liang Cao is in the same situation,

312
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,740
it's not only the capital city

313
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,740
but also the capital city

314
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,740
and the danger.

315
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:21,740
I think you're a war-hunting person.

316
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:22,740
You're so cunning.

317
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:30,740
I risked my life to see Cui Jia Jun and Zhen Xi.

318
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,740
Now they're both injured.

319
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:36,740
I'm afraid if there's a war here,

320
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,740
they'll have to take their medicine first.

321
00:16:38,740 --> 00:16:42,740
And then they'll have to separate

322
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:44,740
and separate them.

323
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,740
It hurts, right?

324
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:58,740
No.

325
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,740
It's just a wound.

326
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:00,740
A wound?

327
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:01,740
No.

328
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,740
It's just a wound.

329
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:05,740
Aying, how did you get hurt?

330
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,740
Sir.

331
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,740
Sir.

332
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,740
It's okay. I didn't get hurt.

333
00:17:09,740 --> 00:17:10,740
It's good that you didn't get hurt.

334
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:12,740
Sir.

335
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,740
Someone in Cui Jia Jun wants to kill me.

336
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:19,740
No.

337
00:17:19,740 --> 00:17:20,740
I was wearing a mask.

338
00:17:20,740 --> 00:17:21,740
They thought I was you.

339
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,740
Someone wanted to kill you.

340
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:29,740
Then who do you think it is?

341
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,740
The people in Cui Jia Jun

342
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,740
can always be against you and me

343
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:39,740
without hesitation.

344
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,740
Who else?

345
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,740
It seems that Cui Li has been fighting for years.

346
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,740
She's still a person.

347
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,740
Don't worry, sir.

348
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,740
Let her not go crazy.

349
00:17:56,740 --> 00:17:57,740
Shi Qi Lang.

350
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:00,740
Shi Qi Lang.

351
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:02,740
You asked me to come today.

352
00:18:02,740 --> 00:18:03,740
You don't drink anymore?

353
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,740
Do you want some tea?

354
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,740
I'll drink a few times with tea.

355
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:13,740
It's so good.

356
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,740
I'll drink a few more times.

357
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:16,740
No.

358
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:18,740
Why are you so happy today?

359
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:20,740
Is there something to be happy about?

360
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:27,740
You're talking about the point.

361
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,740
My friend

362
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:30,740
is the girl he likes.

363
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:32,740
It's not your little girl.

364
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,740
Shi Qi Lang.

365
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:36,740
You...

366
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:38,740
Your friend

367
00:18:39,740 --> 00:18:40,740
hasn't given up on this matter yet.

368
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,740
The big man can take it and give it up.

369
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,740
I thought they had already broken up.

370
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:47,740
You don't understand.

371
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:49,740
Fine. I don't understand.

372
00:18:49,740 --> 00:18:51,740
But the people in the audience have all seen it.

373
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:54,740
He Xiao Wei and Cui Gong Zi came to a secret place.

374
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:56,740
Even if it's not his wife,

375
00:18:57,740 --> 00:18:59,740
these two must have a personal relationship.

376
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:04,740
Shi Qi Lang.

377
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,740
Although we are the same age,

378
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:09,740
Cui's family will definitely have a heart.

379
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,740
It will become a fantasy in the future.

380
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,740
When did you know?

381
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,740
When did I know?

382
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:20,740
When did I know?

383
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,740
People in the audience can see it.

384
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,740
You like He Xiao Wei, right?

385
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:27,740
Is it that obvious?

386
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:29,740
I'll take care of it next time.

387
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:31,740
Where are you going?

388
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,740
Xiao Wei.

389
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:51,740
Time to eat.

390
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,740
Time to eat.

391
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:56,740
Tao Zi.

392
00:19:56,740 --> 00:19:58,740
Help me get the poisonous poison.

393
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:00,740
The one that's so deadly.

394
00:20:00,740 --> 00:20:01,740
What... what poison do you want?

395
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,740
Just get it.

396
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:05,740
Fine. I'll go get it.

397
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,740
Poison?

398
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:12,740
Poisonous poison?

399
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
What?

400
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:15,740
He Xiao Wei knows I'm here.

401
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,740
What?

402
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,740
He knows I'm here.

403
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,740
He wants to kill me.

404
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,740
Royal Descendant is injured.

405
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
He's not in the camp to rest.

406
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:24,740
Why are you here?

407
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:35,740
You used to be the one who killed the enemy for your son, right?

408
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,740
Of course not.

409
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,740
Today, he's not feeling well.

410
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:41,740
I'll help him.

411
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,740
I know.

412
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,740
What?

413
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:53,740
I know your identity.

414
00:20:58,740 --> 00:20:59,740
What identity?

415
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:02,740
I know your identity.

416
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:07,740
I know you're not the little girl of Prince Cui.

417
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,740
I'm not.

418
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:21,740
What do you think?

419
00:21:23,740 --> 00:21:25,740
You're a liar.

420
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:27,740
Let me tell you something.

421
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,740
If I catch the State of Zheng,

422
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,740
Luoyang will be mine.

423
00:21:30,740 --> 00:21:31,740
What do you think?

424
00:21:31,740 --> 00:21:32,740
No way.

425
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:34,740
Even if you catch the State of Zheng,

426
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:35,740
unless you, the Zhengxi Army

427
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:36,740
don't need our Cui's army to help,

428
00:21:36,740 --> 00:21:38,740
you can attack Luoyang.

429
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,740
Otherwise, Luoyang can't attack you.

430
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Xiao Wei.

431
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:44,740
I got the poison.

432
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,740
We're going to poison the Zhengxi Army.

433
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:50,740
I'll talk to you later.

434
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,740
Xiao Wei.

435
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
Why is Li Huangsun here?

436
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:05,740
What did he tell you?

437
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,740
Why are you still talking about it?

438
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,740
You didn't hide anything from me.

439
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:11,740
Now you don't tell me.

440
00:22:11,740 --> 00:22:13,740
Is the poison still in use?

441
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:15,740
No.

442
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:17,740
Is the poison still in use?

443
00:22:33,740 --> 00:22:34,740
The Cui's army is half-dead.

444
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:36,740
They retreated 30 miles.

445
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,740
They didn't let the Fu Palace down the battle yesterday.

446
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,740
This battle is beautiful.

447
00:22:42,740 --> 00:22:44,740
You're really a good son of your father.

448
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,740
The Fu Palace is over.

449
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,740
The Emperor's son was injured the day before yesterday.

450
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:50,740
He can't come today.

451
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:53,740
You can keep an eye on the provisions of the Fu Palace.

452
00:22:53,740 --> 00:22:56,740
I'll talk to him.

453
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,740
I promise to give him the provisions.

454
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,740
I'll give him the provisions.

455
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,740
Then thank the Fu Palace.

456
00:23:02,740 --> 00:23:04,740
I'll tell Li Nian.

457
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,740
Let him be the good man.

458
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:08,740
Yes.

459
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,740
Holiday Shitose

460
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,740
Qi.

461
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:29,740
Isn't this what the server agrees on?

462
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,740
Why are you fighting with the Fu?

463
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:34,740
I'll show you a West room for a bit later.

464
00:23:35,740 --> 00:23:36,740
What'sfer?

465
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Give you a staff chamber

466
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:41,740
from this Cold Palace.

467
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:44,960
brother

468
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:45,560
brother

469
00:23:45,960 --> 00:23:46,600
cleanang

470
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:47,640
cleanang

471
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,380
clean Wang

472
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:48,800
he

473
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:49,640
cleanang

474
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:50,560
Yes

475
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:51,880
We went out

476
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:02,680
Go out

477
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:03,640
Come out!

478
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:04,640
Hurry up!

479
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:05,640
Come out!

480
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:06,640
Come out!

481
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,640
Come out!

482
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:12,640
Move!

483
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,640
General Pei,

484
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,640
who is the one who built this?

485
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:22,640
It's a piece of cake.

486
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:23,640
We caught a big fish.

487
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:25,640
Luo Yang City is in trouble now.

488
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,640
What's the matter?

489
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:30,640
What's the matter?

490
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,640
What's the matter?

491
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,600
The King of the Sun.

492
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:35,600
This is the little uncle of Sun Jing.

493
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,600
Is he from the State of Zheng?

494
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,600
He doesn't look good.

495
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:40,600
Right.

496
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:41,600
Sun Jing's wife must be not good.

497
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,600
I've never seen a big official like this before.

498
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:46,600
This is a good one.

499
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,600
Good.

500
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
Such a big official is a good one.

501
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,600
He's so proud.

502
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,600
Luo Yang City's noble brother

503
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,600
is hiding in this car and trying to steal from us.

504
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,600
He's our 17th wolf, the legendary legend.

505
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,560
He's got them into a fight.

506
00:25:02,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Since we've caught the State of Zheng,

507
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,600
then this is

508
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:08,600
what Luo Yang City means to us.

509
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,600
Yes.

510
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:10,600
That's great.

511
00:25:10,600 --> 00:25:11,600
That's great.

512
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,600
General,

513
00:25:20,600 --> 00:25:21,600
these are the imperial gifts.

514
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:22,600
What do you want to do with them?

515
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:23,600
Take the State of Zheng

516
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:25,600
to the palace with you and come here with him.

517
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
Say that you want to use the State of Zheng

518
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:28,600
in return for the imperial gifts

519
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:29,600
to exchange for the title of the emperor.

520
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:31,600
What do you want to exchange?

521
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:33,600
The State of Zheng and the State of Guo

522
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,600
are not as good as Luo Yang City.

523
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,600
You can only get out

524
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,600
when you're so shameless.

525
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:42,600
Don't be so shameless.

526
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,600
Just use it.

527
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:45,600
Dare you bet with me?

528
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,600
I won't bet with you.

529
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,600
I've heard the word of happiness.

530
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:54,600
Our Royal Descendant

531
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:56,600
said that

532
00:25:56,600 --> 00:25:58,600
you have a chance.

533
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,600
As long as you open the gate of Luo Yang City,

534
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,600
we'll let the State of Zheng

535
00:26:03,600 --> 00:26:05,600
and these noble children

536
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,600
be sure

537
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:08,600
that we won't take the wealth

538
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,600
and the people who don't hurt the people.

539
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:12,600
How about this?

540
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,600
Do you want to buy it?

541
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,600
Do you want to spend it?

542
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,600
State of Zheng is the inner land of the Sun Jing.

543
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,600
If you don't save him,

544
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,600
the great uncle of the Sun Jing

545
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,600
will not let you down.

546
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:29,600
You still don't want to pay?

547
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,600
Put the sword down.

548
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:40,600
You'll die of the State of Zheng.

549
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:41,600
You'll be punished.

550
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:42,600
You'll be punished.

551
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,600
Fuya, are you crazy?

552
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,600
Fuya, Fuya.

553
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,600
Fuya, don't.

554
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,600
Are you crazy?

555
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,600
Don't, don't, don't.

556
00:26:58,600 --> 00:26:59,600
Fuya.

557
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,600
Fuya.

558
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,600
Fuya.

559
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,600
Wu Yuan, you bastard.

560
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:15,600
Wu Yuan,

561
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,600
you're helping me to die.

562
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,600
The thousands of people in the city

563
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,600
are watching you.

564
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:22,600
They won't let you down.

565
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,600
The sword is good.

566
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:28,600
If you make it more convenient,

567
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,600
and put the heart of State of Zheng,

568
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,600
it won't be useful.

569
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:36,600
I've sent someone to attack Yingzhou.

570
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:39,600
I can't let Cui Yi

571
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,600
be happy.

572
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
The great uncle is so good.

573
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,600
So Cui's army must give up Luo Yang

574
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,600
and save Yingzhou.

575
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,600
Only the Western Army left.

576
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:52,600
It's better to be alone and have a good life.

577
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:53,600
It's more and more exciting.

578
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,600
Tell Fu Yuan,

579
00:27:58,600 --> 00:28:00,600
State of Zheng's Tang State's Wu State

580
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,600
is not enough.

581
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,600
Tell him not to worry.

582
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:04,600
And save Luo Yang.

583
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:05,600
Yes.

584
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,600
But where's Madam Wei?

585
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Madam Guo,

586
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,600
I don't understand.

587
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,600
Your two brothers

588
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:21,600
are still in Jiangnan.

589
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:23,600
Li Jun and Li Lai

590
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:24,600
are in charge of the capital.

591
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,600
They are still in Jiangnan.

592
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:27,600
It's not enough.

593
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:31,600
Can't you leave?

594
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:34,600
What the great uncle means is

595
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,600
the three brothers are together.

596
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,600
They know who is Kun Peng

597
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,600
and who is the bird.

598
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,600
How can those two birds

599
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,600
watch their brothers

600
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,600
eat the fly?

601
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,600
Great uncle is wonderful.

602
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:53,600
Since ancient times,

603
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
he has never lacked a brother.

604
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,600
Li Ni

605
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,600
should try all kinds of flavors.

606
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:01,600
Come on.

607
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:03,600
Come on.

608
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,600
Sun Jing used the ice-cream

609
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:08,600
to send the army to attack Yingzhou.

610
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:10,600
But Cui's army is here.

611
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:11,600
I'm afraid that

612
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,600
he won't last long.

613
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,600
Sun Jing is trying to save Zhao

614
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,600
and forced us to leave Luo Yang.

615
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,600
I'd better go back to Yingzhou.

616
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:20,600
It's too late to go back now.

617
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,600
What should we do?

618
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,600
Yingzhou is far away.

619
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:28,600
If we can meet Wangzhou,

620
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:29,600
we can have some time

621
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:30,600
on the way.

622
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,600
If we can write the title of Yingzhou,

623
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,600
we can take Luo Yang.

624
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:36,600
Wangzhou is in Li Ni's hands.

625
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:39,600
I'm afraid that he won't meet her.

626
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:43,600
With our current strength,

627
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:45,600
there is still room

628
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:46,600
for discussion.

629
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:48,600
What? Yingzhou is in a hurry?

630
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,600
It's very reliable.

631
00:29:50,600 --> 00:29:52,600
Sun Jing's army is on the way.

632
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,600
It seems that

633
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,600
Cui's army will have some action.

634
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
But they might not be able to reach Yingzhou.

635
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,600
If we don't go back in time,

636
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,600
Cui's army

637
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,600
needs to be taken as Wangzhou.

638
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:05,600
What do you mean?

639
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:06,600
You want to take Wangzhou to them?

640
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:14,600
I'll wait for them to come back.

641
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:19,600
Wait for a moment.

642
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:20,600
Okay.

643
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:22,600
Don't worry.

644
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:26,600
Trotter,

645
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:29,600
go and find Euh Shui with Miss Taozi.

646
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,600
Yes.

647
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:34,600
Miss Taozi.

648
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,600
Dongdu is so small and large.

649
00:30:46,600 --> 00:30:47,600
Your miasty is perfect.

661
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:14,560

I'm always

Yi Yu.

664
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,560
When your grandson rose from the war,

665
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:24,680
he knew that

666
00:31:25,200 --> 00:31:27,480
even the sky was devoting his whole life

667
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,880
to fight with his own flesh,

668
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,360
you had seen that they were replied personally.

669
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,000
I only hope

670
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,420
for the good editors

671
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,180
to return their lives

672
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
to the people.

673
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,280
I hope so too.

674
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:49,040
Certainly.

675
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:07,720
That day, tell me,

676
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,980
do you wanted to save me

677
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,180
from Sword of Qu Brother Fermi?

678
00:32:14,680 --> 00:32:15,440
Honestly, I don't.

679
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:20,000
But you have to win me first.

680
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:24,040
You're so stingy.

681
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,680
What tricks do you want?

682
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:29,400
Does Royal Descendant want to

683
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,200
bet with me?

684
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,560
If Royal Descendant is cautious,

685
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,360
bet with me.

686
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,200
If I win,

687
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:43,160
you'll make me take revenge.

688
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:45,280
If you win,

689
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:48,400
I'll help you save the King of Liang.

690
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,320
I'll be fair to you.

691
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:52,520
How to bet?

692
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,280
How to bet?

693
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,080
It's simple.

694
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:00,760
Close your eyes.

695
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,720
I'll count to ten.

696
00:33:02,920 --> 00:33:04,400
If you can't bear to open your eyes

697
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,640
before counting to ten,

698
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:07,960
you'll lose.

699
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,120
You'll lose?

700
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,480
Don't you want to

701
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,800
let me go?

702
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:22,040
Don't worry.

703
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,520
I won't hurt you.

704
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:25,880
How?

705
00:33:34,360 --> 00:33:35,120
I'll bet.

706
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:36,440
But

707
00:33:36,800 --> 00:33:38,160
I'll count to ten.

708
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,560
I'll never

709
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,880
let you go even if you come back.

710
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,360
Okay.

711
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,520
Close your eyes.

712
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:45,600
Count to ten.

713
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,640
One.

714
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:57,880
Two.

715
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,560
Three.

716
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,280
Four.

717
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:38,640
You lost.

718
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:09,040

선배 and seon

723
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,140
Can this be mean?

724
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:33,840
Can this be mean?

725
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,440
Underneath yourга

726
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:41,340
are the two most literary books

727
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,880
A бably

728
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,920
which are inattentive

729
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:50,280
and kart for nothing

730
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,980
and don't look too far

731
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,980
I might have to leave

732
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:03,120
Director, I heard that

733
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,560
there is an Graduate Des Earned の

734
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,880
The book is a book.

735
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,360
Can you lend me one?

736
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,160
It's the rules in the ancestral master's place.

737
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:12,080
The books in the past are never outside.

738
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:14,200
Chief.

739
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,680
I'm willing to be the new official

740
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,960
to pick and clean it.

741
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:19,440
I only ask you to allow me to lend you one.

742
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:22,760
Pick and clean are all important.

743
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,200
You're a girl.

744
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:24,760

746
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm willing to help her pick and clean.

747
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:27,280

748
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,240
I'm willing to help her clean.

749
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Chief.

750
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:31,320
I'm willing to help too.

751
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,240
Please give me a hand.

752
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,400
Then please choose one.

753
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,120
You two can go and clean the gold.

754
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,000
Miss Ma, let me help you.

755
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,120
No.

756
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,000
You're here to help me.

757
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,360
You're not here to help me.

758
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,760
And why do you want to help me?

759
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,080
I don't know.

760
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,880
I just want to help you

761
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:04,800
when I see you.

762
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:07,880
Then...

763
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,440
You look like a person who has read books.

764
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,880
I want you to clean the books.

765
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:24,880
Yes.

766
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:25,680
Yes.

767
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:30,440
Have a rest.

768
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:31,480
Let me clean it.

769
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,520
Let the Royal Descendant do the work himself.

770
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,000
Isn't that appropriate?

771
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:36,840
Since I've read the books,

772
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:38,680
I'll make a new one for you.

773
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,440
Beulation I'm Taiwan Prince

774
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:36,800
Grand Listener

775
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:49,680
Such a subtle smile.

776
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:50,800
Your drawing looks really good.

777
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:52,600
This painting is a call

778
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:54,400
for the Royal Descendant's work.

779
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:55,720
What do you think?

780
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:56,760
Better for you?

781
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,400
I'll write it for you.

782
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,040
As for portfolio,

783
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,400
things look complicated.

784
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,660
I think

785
00:39:15,080 --> 00:39:15,960
you should give it to me.

786
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:20,880
I made it for you.

787
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,160
Why did you give it to me?

788
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,180
However, you give it up on me.

789
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:27,120
So I will pay it back.

790
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,920
The next move is the drill

791
00:39:33,600 --> 00:39:34,760
between Liu Directing and Gen Da Mei.

792
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:46,800
Why...

793
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:48,500
Why?

794
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:49,220
Nothing.

795
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,120
Why are you Why are you

796
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,240
Nothing.

797
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:52,640
You can't tell me.

798
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:54,640
You tell me now.

799
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,200
Why are you

800
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:55,600
Why are you

801
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,560
If I said it, you won't be angry.

802
00:39:57,740 --> 00:39:59,240
Tell me what you want, first.

803
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:00,400
You're so talkative.

804
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,800
Thank you, Qiangzi.

805
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:08,600
You're really

806
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,520
so fearless.

807
00:40:13,920 --> 00:40:15,680
Alright, let's talk about the truth.

808
00:40:16,560 --> 00:40:17,760
Since you've won the bet,

809
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,800
I'll let you borrow the knife to Wangzhou.

810
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:20,840
But

811
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,080
how can you promise me to save my father?

812
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,840
Then you'd better think about it

813
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,960
and help me to make a promise.

814
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:27,840
Good.

815
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,560
You're so sure

816
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,920
that you can make a promise?

817
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:37,400
First of all,

818
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:40,200
we've already got five points

819
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,080
under Chen Bing Luoyang.

820
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,560
Zhengguo Palace is set to win seven points.

821
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,240
Although Fu Yun'er is a traitor,

822
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:48,240
he doesn't know the rules in the court

823
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:50,240
and doesn't know the plans of the family.

824
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,640
Nine points.

825
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:54,200
They've already won nine points.

826
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:55,800
Isn't Luoyang City

827
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,360
in the middle of the war?

828
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:00,560
Well...

829
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,240
Royal Descendant is so good at making a promise for Lord Liang.

830
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:05,920
What's the name of Lord Liang?

831
00:41:09,720 --> 00:41:10,800
He's my father.

832
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,600
I'll save him.

833
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,240
He's in Sun Jing's hands.

834
00:41:17,360 --> 00:41:18,760
I'm afraid that we'll be attacked by Luoyang.

835
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,840
Sun Jing might not be able to kill him.

836
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:26,960
Why don't you...

837
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:31,800
know the rules of the world

838
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,920
and save the country?

839
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:37,520
Know the rules of the world?

840
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:41,000
Fu Yun'er is a big man.

841
00:41:41,000 --> 00:41:42,640
He won't save our family.

842
00:41:43,480 --> 00:41:45,240
I'm afraid that the master of the mansion

843
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:46,760
and Fu Yun'er won't save him.

844
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,240
What should we do?

845
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:48,920
What should we do?

846
00:41:48,920 --> 00:41:50,200
Fu Yun'er can't be late.

847
00:41:50,760 --> 00:41:52,640
We have to save the master by ourselves.

848
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,560
That's right.

849
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:01,200
General! General! Something happened!

850
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:02,320
Get in.

851
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:05,400
Duke Zheng's family led the soldiers

852
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:07,400
to guard the gate and open the gate.

853
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,080
They've taken the army and the army to the city.

854
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:09,720
What?

855
00:42:11,440 --> 00:42:12,240
They're late.

856
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,360
They're all late.

857
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,520
These scoundrels!

858
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:20,160
I didn't expect that

859
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:23,800
Luoyang City is in their hands.

860
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:26,000
I'm going to kill these scoundrels!

861
00:42:26,840 --> 00:42:28,440
I'll kill them all!

862
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,240
Go! Go!

863
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:33,800
Go to the cold river first.

864
00:42:33,800 --> 00:42:34,960
Go to the water!

865
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,840
Why did the army of the Cui family

866
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:38,160
attack Luoyang City?

867
00:42:38,360 --> 00:42:40,440
It's hard to attack them in the morning.

868
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,040
Li Ni is clever and brave.

869
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,280
He made the Duke Zheng's family open the gate.

870
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,840
The army of the Cui family

871
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,440
was able to enter Luoyang City.

872
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,080
Fu Yun'er was against it.

873
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,440
He led the army to guard the gate for two days and a night.

874
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,840
He's not going to be late.

875
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:00,560
I'll go to the cold river first.

876
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:01,840
I'll go to the cold river first.

877
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:03,040
I'll go to the cold river first.

878
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,200
I'll go to the cold river first.

879
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,400
I'll go to the cold river first.

880
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,600
I'll go to the cold river first.

881
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,840
I'll go to the cold river first.

882
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:09,120
I'll go to the cold river first.

883
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:10,360
I'll go to the cold river first.

884
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,560
I'll go to the cold river first.

885
00:43:11,560 --> 00:43:12,960
I'll go to the cold river first.

886
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:13,960
I'll go to the cold river first.

887
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:15,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

888
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:16,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

889
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

890
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

891
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

892
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

893
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

894
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

895
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

896
00:43:25,800 --> 00:43:27,040
I'll go to the cold river first.

897
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:28,840
I'll go to the cold river first.

898
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:29,920
I'll go to the cold river first.

899
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,200
I'll go to the warm river first.

900
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,280
I'll go to the cold river first.

901
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,320
I'll follow you until we meet again.

902
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,040
I'll go to the cold river first.

903
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:41,720
I'll go to the cold river first.

904
00:43:45,080 --> 00:43:46,320
I'll go to the cold river first.

905
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,160
I'll go to the cold river first.

906
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:49,960
Commander.

907
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:09,100
A blade discovered for poisonous man.

908
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,460
Similar to the Luo Yangобы.

909
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,580
Catching it.

910
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:18,220
Never thought that....

911
00:44:19,160 --> 00:44:21,160
If you want to live,

912
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,160
it seems that

913
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:28,160
I can really return this life

914
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,160
to Dugu.

915
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,160
Dugu.

916
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,160
Very good.

917
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:06,160
Very good.

918
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:10,160
The world in the future

919
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:15,160
is the one you should be waiting for.

920
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:23,160
Wait until you and him

921
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,160
fight for the world,

922
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,160
that will be a great moment.

923
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,160
Unfortunately,

924
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,160
I can't see it.

925
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:51,160
Dugu.

926
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:55,160
I miss the taste of the first moment.

927
00:46:56,160 --> 00:47:00,160
The warmth of all the colors

928
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,160
I want to keep for you.

929
00:47:06,160 --> 00:47:09,160
If love is a dream,

930
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:12,160
can we be silent?

931
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:15,160
From now on,

932
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:18,160
I will live for you.

933
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,160
I will watch the new world,

934
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:31,160
waiting for my story.

935
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:35,160
If love is a dream,

936
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:38,160
can we be silent?

937
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:41,160
From now on,

938
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,160
I will love for you.

939
00:47:46,160 --> 00:47:50,160
If love is a dream,

940
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:55,160
can we be silent?

941
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,160
From now on,

942
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,160
I will watch the new world,

943
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:05,160
waiting for my story.

944
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:08,160
If love is a dream,

945
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,160
can we be silent?

946
00:48:11,160 --> 00:48:14,160
From now on,

947
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:21,160
I will wait for you to come back to me.
