00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,320
The wind blows through the wind

3
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:07,320
The wind blows through the wind

4
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:12,520
The sky is full of clouds and the sky is full of clouds

5
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,000
The wind blows through the wind

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,880
The cold snow is cold and the wind is cold

7
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,680
The moon is singing

8
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,320
The moon is standing by your side

9
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,760
The wind is blowing through the wind

10
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,320
The sky is full of clouds and the sky is full of clouds

11
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,960
The wind blows through the wind

12
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:37,320
The wind is singing

13
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,760
The Wind and the Wind

Episode 11

15
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,760
Da Du Du.

16
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,200
I've sent them all.

17
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,120
When Madam Wei got in the carriage,

18
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:03,000
she cried very sadly.

19
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,040
She said she wanted to stay with Da Du Du.

20
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,880
I told her to take care of the young master.

21
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:12,000
When the war is over, I'll take them back.

22
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,320
We'll join forces with the Cui family.

23
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,760
We'll take care of them.

24
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:20,240
We'll take care of them.

25
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,280
We'll take care of them.

26
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,400
If we join forces with the Cui family,

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,000
this war will be a war of the dead.

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,280
It'll be a loss.

29
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,880
I'm afraid we won't be able to return here.

30
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,760
All right.

31
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,600
Chen'er.

32
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,280
One, two, three!

33
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,780
requested surrender

34
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:04,360
Traditional Black lair

35
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:09,400
Everywhere

36
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,620
C joy

37
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:21,760
js yine

38
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:23,760
The Cui family has come to attack the Xi army.

39
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:25,440
We'll escort you first.

40
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,880
We'll stay here.

41
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,480
We're not afraid of being caught.

42
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:31,680
Go.

43
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,240
Where else can we go?

44
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,240
We came from the Western Zhangjing.

45
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:38,920
We've lost our commander.

46
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,040
Now that we're losing commander,

47
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,320
where else can we go?

48
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,440
Dodo.

49
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,440
The Cui family and the Xi army are in the hands of the enemy.

50
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:47,960
The enemy is more than us.

51
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:50,040
If we're in the hands of the commander,

52
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,120
we can still defend ourselves.

53
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:53,840
But now, where can we get the Xi army?

54
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,400
How can we do that?

55
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,000
While the two armies are fighting for peace,

56
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,120
Dodo.

57
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:00,800
Let's go.

58
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:07,080
I remember that the war in Han was

59
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
ten times more than the Khan's.

60
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:12,080
I led the army to fight for the throne.

61
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,360
I was bleeding and running.

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,400
I almost lost my arm.

63
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,640
I was still a great man.

64
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,600
The army of Changdong is tens of thousands of soldiers.

65
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,840
They're still fighting against the enemy.

66
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,280
How can I let them go?

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,240
I'm not leaving.

68
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,640
Bring the Grand Sun here.

69
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,120
Yes.

70
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,400
GO.

71
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:54,160
Xun!

72
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,720
engoil.

73
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,080
Xun Xun?

74
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,640
Xun Xun!

75
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,320
Xun Xun!

76
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Go!

77
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,240
and an impite Army on us.

78
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:28,840

79
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:30,560

80
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
The era is over.

81
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,760
Let us go.

82
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,540
Let's go.

83
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:39,140
We're used to getting closer to each other.

84
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,600
We can't try to escape.

85
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:42,560
Come on.

86
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:48,360
We'll struggle for whatever goal we carry.

87
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,920
I'm the world's leader.

88
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,160
With your words,

89
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,960
I want to give you a grandson.

90
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,160
What do you think?

91
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,680
You and your soldiers

92
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,200
immediately retreat to the capital.

93
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,800
Tell the enemy of the city to write down the edict

94
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,160
and report to the world.

95
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,840
You're not in the position to prove it.

96
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:09,400
You'll ruin the grand future for the crown prince.

97
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,440
Now, the battle in the government

98
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
seems to be not as powerful as the one I've been discussing.

99
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:19,800
Here.

100
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,800
Ningning,

101
00:07:22,600 --> 00:07:24,280
this child is the only blood

102
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,720
left by the crown prince.

103
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:29,240
He's the enemy of the city in your family.

104
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,280
If you're killed today,

105
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,960
how should you explain it to the world?

106
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:35,880
Your father

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,160
will explain it to the world.

108
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:41,160
Don't blame me!

109
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
Kill the grand prince!

110
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,120
Give the crown prince back!

111
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,320
Kill him!

112
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,320
Sun Jing!

113
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,520
You're a coward!

114
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:51,520
Now, you're going to take a child and make a shield!

115
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,120
How can you be the laughing stock of the world?

116
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,880
You don't need to use the General's method.

117
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,400
If you don't retreat,

118
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,800
blame me for doing it.

119
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:01,440
Yes!

120
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:02,440
Stop!

121
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,640
I want to use my life

122
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:11,960
to change the crown prince's life.

123
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,200
Yes, Master!

124
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:13,800
Master!

125
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,360
Master, you can't do that.

126
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:17,640
Master!

127
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:18,040
Master!

128
00:08:18,040 --> 00:08:19,040
Don't blame me!

129
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:19,880
Don't blame me!

130
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:20,600
You're a coward!

131
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,720
Give the crown prince back!

132
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,120
Master!

133
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:35,120
Don't come back!

134
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:35,840
Master!

135
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,640
Master!

136
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,320
Master!

137
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:42,120
Good.

138
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,440
You're so angry.

139
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,400
I'll do as I say.

140
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,280
Prince Qin,

141
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,440
stop it.

142
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,760
You can't do that!

143
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,600
You can't do that!

144
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,360
Don't listen to him!

145
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,080
You can't do that!

146
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,080
Kill him!

147
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,360
You can't do that!

148
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,440
Don't!

149
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,440
Don't!

150
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,440
17!

151
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,440
Don't!

152
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,440
Don't kill the king!

153
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:45,680
Don't!

154
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:48,720
Queen!

155
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:50,080
No!

156
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:02,760
Prince Qin.

157
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:05,760
The one next to grandson Ging is master F dispatcher.

158
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,960
The one I brought,

159
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,080
is the real master F.

160
00:10:09,080 --> 00:10:09,920
What are you saying?

161
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:13,400
Zinian!

162
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,000
to kill the real crown prince.

163
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,000
Granduncle,

164
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:21,720
the child I brought is the fake crown prince.

165
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,280
How can you prove

166
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,760
that the real crown prince is the one you caught?

167
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:31,120
The crown prince has the seal of the late crown prince.

168
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:33,360
I'm a man with the seal

169
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
and I'm going to hide from Han Chang.

170
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,880
If you suspect me,

171
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,800
you don't need to argue.

172
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,120
I'll kill him first.

173
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,400
Stop it!

174
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:45,360
Stop it, Granduncle.

175
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,600
Granduncle never suspects

176
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,360
that the real crown prince

177
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,000
is Han Chang's late crown prince.

178
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,600
After you found the crown prince,

179
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,560
why didn't you follow him?

180
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,560
You're so anxious to save the crown prince.

181
00:10:57,880 --> 00:10:59,560
As for the seal of the late crown prince,

182
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:01,160
why did the real crown prince

183
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,440
put the seal on the child?

184
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:04,960
He doesn't know

185
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,440
that once you get the seal,

186
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,880
you can confirm the child's identity.

187
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,160
Yes.

188
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,400
What should we do?

189
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,800
spoonful of the seal for gloves,

190
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,080
dealers the gold,

191
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:18,200
kill them!

192
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,160
So quickly.

193
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,760
How much more to use?

194
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,160
Grand Sun!

195
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,160
Grand Sun!

196
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,160
Grand Sun!

197
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:59,160
General Han!

198
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,160
It's okay.

199
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:03,160
I'm here to save you.

200
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,160
Let's go.

201
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,160
Grand Sun!

202
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,160
Go!

203
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Grand Sun!

204
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,160
Grand Sun!

205
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:12,160
Grand Sun!

206
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,160
Grand Sun!

207
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,160
You are a soldier.

208
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:22,160
Have you ever thought that

209
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,160
you will have a great day?

210
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:28,160
Your Highness.

211
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,160
You can kill him

212
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,160
with this kind of a traitor.

213
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:48,160
I'm a hero.

214
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,160
If I didn't poison him,

215
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,160
no matter how many people you poison,

216
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,160
you're not my enemy.

217
00:14:58,160 --> 00:14:59,160
You want to kill me,

218
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,160
but you don't know that.

219
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:05,160
I won't let you get it.

220
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,280
Isn't that epic?

221
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,440
It's so rapid,

222
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,080
Like this.

223
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,600
哈哈哈,

224
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:07,520
Wow,

225
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:09,300
how bored you are,

226
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:10,100
Oh,

227
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:12,160
telling the country what the truth is.

228
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,260
Why don't I try

229
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:15,120
to judge it from Minister You?

230
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,980
Since the board of ministers

231
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,160
was first seem to drive討論 down and

232
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,060
as I heard hehood

233
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:26,560
to the steering wheel of achieving after

234
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,880
leaving Ming Dynasty Marquis 뭘

235
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,220
between superpower

236
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:34,200
including emperors

237
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,640
during the period

238
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,560
that we have tab рус

239
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:40,840
Brother-in-law, Brother-in-law,

240
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:44,100
you've changed no matter what.

241
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:50,540
Who wants to fight?

242
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Go.

243
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,800
Xiao Wei, what's wrong?

244
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,520
There was a fight earlier. Someone took over the Tai虚.

245
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,480
Hurry and take this place to pursue the Thats noite.

246
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,940
What do you think of that Prince of Qi?

247
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:07,700
I'll tell him.

248
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,500
Go.

249
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:09,060
Okay.

250
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:11,900
An Ying.

251
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,620
Thank you.

252
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,700
You were the one who found the real Grand Sun.

253
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,060
Sun Jing is dead.

254
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:18,780
We'll send him back to the court.

255
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:19,940
We'll report to the court.

256
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:21,980
17th Lang.

257
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,540
I have to confess something.

258
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,860
The Grand Sun I brought is fake.

259
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:29,900
The real Grand Sun

260
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,700
is indeed the child of Sun Jing.

261
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,380
I had already arranged it.

262
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:34,580
I sent people to find the chance

263
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,940
to save the real Grand Sun.

264
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,580
But I didn't expect

265
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,580
that someone took a step ahead.

266
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:39,980
We have to find a way

267
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,380
to get the real Grand Sun back.

268
00:18:46,820 --> 00:18:47,460
17th Lang.

269
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:02,540
17th Lang.

270
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:03,300
We can't catch him.

271
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:05,980
These people can save the Grand Sun

272
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:06,740
in a chaotic way.

273
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:07,780
They are so strong.

274
00:19:08,020 --> 00:19:09,620
General Han and his subordinates

275
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,220
are in the same boat.

276
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,060
How can they be sure

277
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,140
that Han Chang and his subordinates

278
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:15,300
are taken away by the illegal map?

279
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:17,580
You knew I promised Xiao Fei

280
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:18,540
to save the Grand Sun.

281
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,460
But you took a fake Grand Sun

282
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:21,340
and went to kill Sun Jing.

283
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,300
Have you thought about it?

284
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:23,620
Even if he believes it,

285
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,900
he might be against the real Grand Sun.

286
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,060
Of course I have.

287
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,540
You know there's such a big risk.

288
00:19:27,540 --> 00:19:28,300
What else do you want to do?

289
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,420
I've already thought about it.

290
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:32,820
I have the confidence of seven or eight cities.

291
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,420
I can let Sun Jing believe it

292
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:35,460
and save the Grand Sun.

293
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:36,580
Seven or eight cities?

294
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,500
What about the remaining two or three cities?

295
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:42,700
It's the best result

296
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:43,980
to save the Grand Sun.

297
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,220
If there's any difference in the middle,

298
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,860
it's because I'm not good at it.

299
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,980
It has nothing to do with you.

300
00:19:49,300 --> 00:19:50,820
What do you mean?

301
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,340
It's because you're not good at it.

302
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:53,220
It has nothing to do with me.

303
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,100
17th Lang.

304
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:59,500
Do I have to say something?

305
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,620
Don't you understand?

306
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,060
If you really want to bring the Grand Sun back to the capital,

307
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,700
won't the court

308
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,940
make a new wind and rain?

309
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,140
I know what you're thinking.

310
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:13,740
You want His Majesty to leave the capital.

311
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,220
Have you ever thought about

312
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:16,700
how the world will be

313
00:20:16,700 --> 00:20:17,620
and how people will be?

314
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:18,740
Can the court and the people

315
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,980
have a single idea?

316
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:21,260
Can the court and the palace

317
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,140
be able to get Xiao Qiang again?

318
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,340
You're so wise.

319
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,940
Why didn't you discuss it with me?

320
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:35,820
Because you know

321
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:38,060
I won't agree to it.

322
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:40,820
Yes.

323
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:42,740
Prince Qin has always been a man.

324
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,860
I shouldn't have done it earlier.

325
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,060
I should have let you

326
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,740
be punished by the people.

327
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,620
When I pass by,

328
00:20:49,820 --> 00:20:51,700
I'll definitely get the two-pillar incense.

329
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,180
Go!

330
00:21:22,180 --> 00:21:22,860
Xiao Wei.

331
00:21:23,260 --> 00:21:25,060
It's all my fault.

332
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,180
I didn't save the Grand Sun.

333
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,060
It has nothing to do with you.

334
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:33,660
Although I asked you to

335
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:35,020
save the Grand Sun,

336
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,860
I didn't expect

337
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,300
that someone would be involved.

338
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,180
Those people

339
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:44,100
are probably the subordinates of General Han.

340
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,500
You're not their opponent.

341
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:51,860
How is your wound?

342
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,500
I'm fine.

343
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,900
But I heard from Erdu

344
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:00,340
that Prince Qin was angry with you

345
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:01,500
and quarreled with you.

346
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,900
So I say

347
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,580
you can act it out.

348
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:09,180
Don't lie.

349
00:22:15,460 --> 00:22:15,740
The careless ingredients in the� UC

350
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,820
will be burned in any way possible.

351
00:22:19,780 --> 00:22:20,900
I didn't burn them all.

352
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:21,980
I haven't smirked

353
00:22:21,980 --> 00:22:23,500
those exact dishes

354
00:22:23,500 --> 00:22:25,300
on behalf of the people.

355
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,980
I'm so angry.

356
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:29,640
I think

357
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,020
the People of King's Camp

358
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:33,020
But these letters didn't fall into the trap.

359
00:22:33,340 --> 00:22:35,220
And the letter was used to make a case.

360
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,780
So we can't find this person for now.

361
00:22:38,740 --> 00:22:41,020
After Shiqu Lang returned to the Western Changjing,

362
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,860
we still need to be more careful.

363
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:45,740
Yes.

364
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,980
Li Ni gave the same official

365
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,580
and sent people to report back to the court.

366
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:52,820
He also brought back the lost master of Sun Jing.

367
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,420
These officials

368
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,620
pushed him into the court

369
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,860
and he made another mistake.

370
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:01,420
My brother is also a man of the word.

371
00:23:01,780 --> 00:23:03,420
I'm afraid that the position of the Eastern Palace

372
00:23:03,780 --> 00:23:05,980
needs to be taken into account.

373
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,220
There's a man

374
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:10,660
who always wants to see you.

375
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,860
He sent two people to meet you.

376
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,580
I was caught up in an accident

377
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:15,660
and saw him.

378
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:17,580
He said he has a good idea

379
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:19,660
and can help you.

380
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,540
This man is a good man.

381
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,260
He used to be Cui Yi's son.

382
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:26,900
I talked to him.

383
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:29,220
I found this man was very cautious.

384
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,060
He used to be like this.

385
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:33,060
This man and Cui Jia

386
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:34,140
must be dead.

387
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,580
It's useful.

388
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,060
Mr. Liu, you've been adopted.

389
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,500
Your Highness is smiling.

390
00:23:47,060 --> 00:23:48,220
Why do you want to be adopted?

391
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,900
I'm just a beautiful man now.

392
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,860
Since you're a beautiful man,

393
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:56,500
how can you do this for me?

394
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,060
Prince Qin has taken over the throne

395
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,460
and defeated Sun Jing.

396
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,700
He's done such a great merit.

397
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:04,260
Once he returns to the capital,

398
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:06,820
he will be sure to get the position of the Eastern Palace.

399
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,980
As his brother,

400
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,020
don't you think it's a good thing?

401
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:14,980
My brother is the leader.

402
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:18,020
He can't even be considered as a leader.

403
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,260
If Li Ni married Cui Yi's only daughter,

404
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,740
Cui Jia Jun and Zhen Xi Jun

405
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:24,900
will be like Li Ni's haunt.

406
00:24:25,660 --> 00:24:26,460
By then,

407
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,780
even if His Majesty can be the king,

408
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,900
don't say that His Highness wants to be the Eastern Palace.

409
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,700
Even if he wants to be a free king,

410
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,940
he has no place to be.

411
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,420
Li Ni will marry Cui's only daughter?

412
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:45,460
They have already had a private relationship.

413
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,100
Otherwise, His Highness would have been in trouble.

414
00:24:47,660 --> 00:24:49,860
Why would he let Prince Qin have a letter?

415
00:24:50,180 --> 00:24:52,500
Cui Jia Jun can be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one to be the one?

416
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,540
Why would Prince Qin give Cui Yi

417
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,060
the risk of being the general of Wei Yang?

418
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,060
Cui Yi would be willing to leave Chang Zhou.

419
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,060
Why would Zhen Xi Jun

420
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:02,820
be able to fight with Cui Jia Jun and get the position of the Eastern Palace?

421
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,100
So that's the case.

422
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,460
Your Highness, you've already thought about it.

423
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,460
Do you want to send some people

424
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:17,740
to kill Prince Qin on the way back to the capital?

425
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,300
But Your Highness,

426
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:22,460
in the guard of the Wan Army,

427
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,740
if you want to kill Prince Qin,

428
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:26,980
how much will you be able to defend him?

429
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
Is there any miracle in your plan?

430
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,540
Your Highness, why don't you start from the beginning

431
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,100
and start from the beginning?

432
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:41,300
You should be careful and considerate.

433
00:25:41,780 --> 00:25:43,260
Once he's in trouble,

434
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,420
he will surely go back to the capital.

435
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:46,900
By then,

436
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,060
Your Highness can take this opportunity

437
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,740
to kill Prince Qin.

438
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:56,140
It's a good plan.

439
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,140
But it's a little bit of a rush

440
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,700
to start from the beginning.

441
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:00,980
Don't worry, Your Highness.

442
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:03,100
I've already made this plan.

443
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,540
I will personally send someone to the capital

444
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,580
to punish you.

445
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,420
I wonder how I should thank you

446
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,540
after the trial.

447
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,140
I've made a promise

448
00:26:16,380 --> 00:26:18,100
for you.

449
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,660
I'm not begging you.

450
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:23,100
I just want you to send someone

451
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:24,740
to kill me.

452
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,020
It's been several days.

453
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:34,660
Prince Qin is in the palace.

454
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:36,620
We're staying outside.

455
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:40,420
It's not a big deal.

456
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,180
Prince Qin is so thoughtful.

457
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,980
He can do whatever he wants.

458
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,820
He doesn't need to send someone here.

459
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:55,820
Xiao Wei,

460
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:59,540
do you think Prince Qin is really angry?

461
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,820
Why are you so worried?

462
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,740
Prince Qin is not angry.

463
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,300
It has nothing to do with me.

464
00:27:08,780 --> 00:27:09,780
Look.

465
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:14,740
You were so close to Prince Qin before.

466
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:16,380
But this time,

467
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:18,660
it's because of Taishun

468
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:20,220
that you're so angry.

469
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,620
Taozi, what's wrong with you?

470
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,620
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

471
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,300
I'm just thinking

472
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,700
Prince Qin is not sick.

473
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,380
He's been in a good mood recently.

474
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,460
He's cold and hot.

475
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,180
I heard

476
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,500
that many people in the palace are sick.

477
00:27:38,300 --> 00:27:41,340
He even has a cold.

478
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,340
If you feel bad,

479
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,740
you can give him the medicine.

480
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,420
No.

481
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:48,060
I'm not going.

482
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,500
Xiao Wei, if you don't talk to Prince Qin all day,

483
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,620
I won't talk to that man.

484
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,780
I won't talk to him.

485
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,180
Erduo.

486
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,220
Fatty.

487
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:25,500
Fatty, you're finally here.

488
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:26,460
What did Xiao Wei say?

489
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,220
He's still the same.

490
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:30,980
I told him I was stupid.

491
00:28:31,340 --> 00:28:33,300
He doesn't even want to mention Prince Qin.

492
00:28:33,620 --> 00:28:34,660
What should we do?

493
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:35,780
When I came,

494
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,180
they were all in the same boat.

495
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:38,700
They said they'd ask you

496
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,180
to talk to Xiao Wei and Shi Qi Lang.

497
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,020
You don't know that

498
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,580
Shi Qi Lang is in a group now.

499
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,860
He gets up every day and trains with us.

500
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,100
He has to pull us together.

501
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,060
It's not a training, it's a gun.

502
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:48,780
If not,

503
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,660
it's a military camp to train.

504
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:51,820
We can't take it.

505
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,260
It's useless to tell me that.

506
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,740
I don't have any idea

507
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,860
about Miss.

508
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:03,860
How about you ask Prince Qin to get sick?

509
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,820
I can tell Miss

510
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,060
to let her go to visit Prince Qin.

511
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,820
If Prince Qin is willing to get sick,

512
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:12,060
he won't train with us every day.

513
00:29:15,300 --> 00:29:16,660
What should we do?

514
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,740
I don't know.

515
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,300
Bao.

516
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:23,740
Bao.

517
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:24,460
What?

518
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,660
How is it?

519
00:29:29,660 --> 00:29:30,820
How did Tao Zi say it?

520
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,980
Tao Zi gave me an idea.

521
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
But...

522
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:35,980
I don't think it's right.

523
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:38,540
If he doesn't want to get sick,

524
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:41,260
we can let him get sick.

525
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,780
Give him this.

526
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,140
He'll get sick after he eats it.

527
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,780
I'll tell Miss

528
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,660
that Prince Qin is sick.

529
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,780
Let him go to visit him.

530
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,260
It's not right.

531
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,820
What's wrong?

532
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:56,620
I think it's right.

533
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,340
Bao.

534
00:29:57,540 --> 00:29:58,460
I told you,

535
00:29:58,460 --> 00:29:59,500
you don't know.

536
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:00,780
17th Wolf pulled me

537
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:02,580
and looked for a job last night.

538
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:03,780
He called me again

539
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:05,060
at 3 o'clock in the morning.

540
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,700
He insisted on me training with him.

541
00:30:06,700 --> 00:30:07,620
I didn't want to

542
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:09,260
spend a day like this.

543
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,340
You don't go to the hospital.

544
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,180
I'll go to the hospital.

545
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:11,820
Bao.

546
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:12,700
This won't do.

547
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:12,940
What if...

548
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,980
What if?

549
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:15,620
He won't train with me for two days.

550
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,860
I'll go crazy.

551
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,540
He'll be sick for two days.

552
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:20,060
Or I'll go crazy.

553
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:21,540
Bao.

554
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:22,500
Bao.

555
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:38,780
This...

556
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,380
is a skill.

557
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:42,980
What you've pinched

558
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:43,660
is good.

559
00:30:43,660 --> 00:30:44,540
What you've never pinched

560
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:45,500
is bad.

561
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,620
What you've pinched

562
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,780
is bad.

563
00:30:49,460 --> 00:30:50,300
17th Wolf.

564
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:51,820
17th Wolf.

565
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,860
You're hungry after training?

566
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,780
I asked the kitchen to cook.

567
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:56,180
Come on.

568
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,100
Eat some.

569
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:00,580
How can the kitchen

570
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,540
do this kind of thing?

571
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,220
The chef of Sun Jin

572
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:04,300
is still alive.

573
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,260
I asked him to cook.

574
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,300
He's the master.

575
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:07,740
Look at his heart.

576
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:09,780
He's good at cooking.

577
00:31:09,780 --> 00:31:10,580
He's good at looking.

578
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,340
Try it.

579
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:15,300
Look.

580
00:31:17,580 --> 00:31:18,380
It's good.

581
00:31:24,300 --> 00:31:24,940
It's good.

582
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:27,980
It's good, right?

583
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,660
It's good.

584
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,380
It's good, right?

585
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:47,460
It's good.

586
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,460
What's wrong, Bao?

587
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:05,780
You're not feeling well?

588
00:32:13,820 --> 00:32:14,940
It smells good.

589
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:17,860
It's good, bro.

590
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,420
It Fund me up in order you wouldn't kiss me.

591
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,660
Dad.

592
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,500
Does it matter

593
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,820
to pray for independence?

594
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:28,380
You dare to

595
00:32:28,380 --> 00:32:30,140
fall in love with me.

596
00:32:30,780 --> 00:32:32,340
You've been dirting me every day

597
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:33,980
to chop three suicide-TORYs

598
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:36,140
when a sweet sport like aren't your removal.

599
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:37,020
You're suffering

600
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:38,500
because you want me to eat

601
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:40,140
this food foundation.

602
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,540
I want to doinnen Previously Rarden,

603
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:44,060
I want to punish you.

604
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:47,420
This red-coat is very valuable

605
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,620
to all to help him recover his youth

606
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:50,100
Your Highness

607
00:32:50,860 --> 00:33:12,320
may all his

608
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,920
I'll kill you after I lose.

609
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,680
If Ying doesn't show up,

610
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:20,760
Li Ni won't be in trouble.

611
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,040
If Li Ni is not,

612
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,840
she won't be able to kill Li Ni.

613
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,240
She won't be able to take Ying away.

614
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:29,920
Go.

615
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,760
Be careful.

616
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,560
Yes.

617
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,180
Let's go.

618
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:04,480
Dis

619
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,320
Miss?

620
00:34:05,360 --> 00:34:06,040
What is it?

621
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:08,600
Take a look.

622
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,360
She doesn't feel well.

623
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:15,320
So hot. It must be a fever.

624
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:19,320
So it's a fever.

625
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,320
It's a fever.

626
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,320
Why did you retreat so much?

627
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,320
I couldn't beat you before.

628
00:34:41,320 --> 00:34:43,320
Besides, I've been dragging my stomach for several days.

629
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,320
I've been suffocating.

630
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,320
You don't even know how to keep your mouth shut.

631
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:52,320
You... You're still here?

632
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,320
You...

633
00:34:53,320 --> 00:34:54,320
Shi Qi Lang.

634
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:55,320
Shi Qi Lang.

635
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:56,320
What's the matter?

636
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,320
Tao Zi is here.

637
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:58,320
She said she has urgent matters to attend to.

638
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,320
She's not here.

639
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:00,320
Shi Qi Lang.

640
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:01,320
She has urgent matters to attend to.

641
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:02,320
What urgent matters does she have?

642
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,320
If it's about the military,

643
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:05,320
she should have sent the document to our army.

644
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,320
Prince Qin is a friend of mine.

645
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,320
Can't I save her?

646
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:09,320
Let go of me!

647
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Prince Qin.

648
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,320
What's the matter?

649
00:35:15,320 --> 00:35:17,320
Our Xiao Wei is sick.

650
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,320
He's very ill.

651
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:20,320
Your Xiao Wei is sick.

652
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,320
Why did you ask me to do it?

653
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,320
I'll sell Xiao Wei for free.

654
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
Even his body.

655
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:27,320
This time, it's really weird.

656
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,320
The situation suddenly got worse.

657
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:31,320
I gave him a ten-pronged medicine.

658
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:33,320
It didn't work out.

659
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,320
Today...

660
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,320
Xiao Wei is already unconscious.

661
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:37,320
Your Highness.

662
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,320
Go and see him.

663
00:35:39,320 --> 00:35:40,320
I've never seen

664
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,320
such a weird patient.

665
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:43,320
If you can't see him,

666
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,320
you should ask for more treatment.

667
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,320
You!

668
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,320
Prince Qin is so considerate.

669
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,320
He's not like that.

670
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:50,320
Our Cui family army

671
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:52,320
is always a friend of this army.

672
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,320
Even if it's about the alliance,

673
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:55,320
you can't treat him like this.

674
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,320
You're so cruel.

675
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Shiqing.

676
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:00,320
Taozi.

677
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,320
Taozi.

678
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,320
I said you.

679
00:36:05,320 --> 00:36:07,320
Why are you so cruel?

680
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,320
Stop pretending to be so mean.

681
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:13,320
I don't know what tricks you're playing.

682
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:15,320
I was sick at first.

683
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,320
But you can't see him.

684
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:18,320
You just have to ask him to do something.

685
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:19,320
Right?

686
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,320
It really has nothing to do with me.

687
00:36:21,320 --> 00:36:22,320
I swear.

688
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:47,320
Let's go and see him.

689
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,320
What if he's really sick?

690
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,320
Miss.

691
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,320
Miss.

692
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:20,320
You must stop.

693
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,320
I've ordered people to hurry up

694
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,320
and keep General.

695
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:26,320
He will definitely change soon.

696
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,320
You must stop, Miss.

697
00:37:46,320 --> 00:37:47,320
Prince Qin.

698
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:49,320
It's me.

699
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,320
The moon is bright and the stars are bright.

700
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
Prince Qin.

701
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,320
Let's go and find the clouds.

702
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:06,320
You've been sleeping all day.

703
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:08,320
You're not able to find the clouds.

704
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:10,320
Why are you so focused today?

705
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,320
It's different tonight.

706
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:15,320
I'm going to go with you.

707
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:17,320
I'll go with you to the clouds

708
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:19,320
so you don't do anything else.

709
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,320
What do you mean?

710
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:25,320
If you don't do anything else,

711
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,320
then it's not good enough.

712
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:27,320
Let's go.

713
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,320
I'll accompany you tonight

714
00:38:31,320 --> 00:38:33,320
to the city of Maozhen.

715
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,320
Let's go.

716
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,320
Let's go.

717
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,320
Tonight,

718
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,320
we'll find every corner

719
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,320
and give it to him.

720
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,320
Miss.

721
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,320
Miss.

722
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,320
Tao Zi.

723
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,320
Tao Zi, the medicine is ready.

724
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,320
This is the medicine I ordered

725
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,320
to the nearby town of Daqizhen.

726
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,320
I'll go to Lu Zipian

727
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:57,320
and take care of it.

728
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,320
It's not a big deal.

729
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:01,320
Miss, the medicine is here.

730
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:03,320
Give it to me.

731
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,320
Miss, the medicine is here.

732
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:08,320
It's ready after drinking.

733
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
I'll go with you.

734
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,320
Okay.

735
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,320
Miss.

736
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,320
Miss, I beg you.

737
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,320
Open your mouth.

738
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,320
It's good that you're here after drinking.

739
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:31,320
Miss, I really can't drink the medicine.

740
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,320
Miss.

741
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,320
Miss.

742
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,320
Tao Zi, I'm going to call Shiqing.

743
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:50,320
I'll drag her down this time.

744
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:52,320
Don't go.

745
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,320
She's a person who's a good girl.

746
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,320
Why do you let her do it?

747
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,320
No.

748
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:00,320
She must not know that He Xiaowei is sick.

749
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,320
Shiqing is not like that.

750
00:40:11,320 --> 00:40:12,320
You're here to protect Miss.

751
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,320
I'm going to send three soldiers to guard the house.

752
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,320
She's sick now.

753
00:40:17,320 --> 00:40:19,320
She must not let others know that she has a chance.

754
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,320
Okay.

755
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:23,320
By the way,

756
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,320
you can leave first

757
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,320
when I come back.

758
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,320
In case the army gets busy.

759
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,320
No.

760
00:40:29,320 --> 00:40:30,320
I'll stay here with you.

761
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,320
You're a person who's a good soldier.

762
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,320
If General comes back

763
00:40:33,320 --> 00:40:34,320
and sees Miss like this,

764
00:40:35,320 --> 00:40:36,320
I'm afraid she'll kill you.

765
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,320
Miss.

766
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:45,320
What's wrong?

767
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:47,320
Miss.

768
00:40:49,320 --> 00:40:50,320
Miss.

769
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:52,320
Miss.

770
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:54,320
Miss.

771
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,320
Miss.

772
00:40:59,320 --> 00:41:00,320
Miss.

773
00:41:01,320 --> 00:41:02,320
Miss.

774
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:04,320
Miss.

775
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,320
Miss.

776
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,320
Miss.

777
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:10,320
He's been sick for three days.

778
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,320
If he doesn't take the antidote tonight,

779
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,320
he'll be fine

780
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:15,320
if he's recovered.

781
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,320
Wait a little longer.

782
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,320
Prince of Shiqing.

783
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,320
Don't leave.

784
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,320
It's just a four-legged dog.

785
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:37,320
Why are you going back so early?

786
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:38,320
I've searched all the places.

787
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,320
Why don't you stay here?

788
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,320
I'll search again.

789
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:41,320
Didn't I say it already?

790
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,320
I'll accompany you to Tianming.

791
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,320
I have something else to do.

792
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,320
What is it?

793
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:47,320
I haven't read the letter

794
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,320
sent by the manager.

795
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:51,320
I'll finish it tomorrow.

796
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,320
It's not urgent.

797
00:41:52,320 --> 00:41:53,320
I'll go to sleep.

798
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:55,320
How did you

799
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,320
teach me

800
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,320
the last few days?

801
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,320
I'm not sleepy.

802
00:41:59,320 --> 00:42:00,320
We're not sleepy.

803
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:03,320
You did it on purpose today, right?

804
00:42:04,320 --> 00:42:05,320
You're right.

805
00:42:05,320 --> 00:42:07,320
I did it on purpose.

806
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:08,320
Fine. Let's continue.

807
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,320
Continue?

808
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:10,320
Let's go.

809
00:42:10,320 --> 00:42:11,320
Let's go.

810
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:16,320
Can't you hold me?

811
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,320
Sir, it's almost dawn.

812
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:30,320
I didn't expect

813
00:42:31,320 --> 00:42:32,320
that

814
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,320
Ying was so smart

815
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:38,320
but she was so ungrateful.

816
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:40,320
Cui Jiajun has already

817
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:41,320
strengthened his skills.

818
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:43,320
If we wait until dawn,

819
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,320
we'll be in trouble.

820
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:46,320
Take the antidote.

821
00:42:46,320 --> 00:42:47,320
Go.

822
00:42:47,320 --> 00:42:48,320
Let Ying take the antidote first.

823
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:50,320
Yes.

824
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:02,320
Taozi.

825
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:09,320
What are you doing here?

826
00:43:10,320 --> 00:43:12,320
Is your school really sick?

827
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:13,320
Our school is very well-off.

828
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,320
Don't bother with it.

829
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:16,320
Is she really sick?

830
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,320
Of course not.

831
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,320
Your Highness, respect her.

832
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:21,320
This is Ying's secret

833
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:22,320
of Cui Jiajun.

834
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:23,320
If you do that,

835
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,320
I'll order her

836
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:25,320
to get rid of you.

837
00:43:27,320 --> 00:43:28,320
Taozi,

838
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,320
who are you talking to?

839
00:43:30,320 --> 00:43:31,320
My lady.

840
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,320
My lady.

841
00:43:33,320 --> 00:43:34,320
Be careful.

842
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,320
Come on.

843
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:39,320
Let me see.

844
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:42,320
I'm fine.

845
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:47,320
I've ruined you.

846
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:49,320
I'm really worried.

847
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,320
Ying.

848
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,320
Are you really sick?

849
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:00,320
Are you feeling better?

850
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,320
Are you feeling better?

851
00:44:05,320 --> 00:44:06,320
Prince Qi, please take care of yourself.

852
00:44:07,320 --> 00:44:08,320
It's just Xiaojie.

853
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,320
Don't trouble Prince Qi.

854
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,320
Taozi.

855
00:44:19,320 --> 00:44:20,320
Go out first.

856
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,320
There are some things

857
00:44:23,320 --> 00:44:24,320
I want to tell Prince Qi.

858
00:44:24,320 --> 00:44:25,320
My lady.

859
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:26,320
You just told me

860
00:44:26,320 --> 00:44:27,320
that you're sick.

861
00:44:28,320 --> 00:44:29,320
I'll stay here with you.

862
00:44:31,320 --> 00:44:32,320
It's okay. Don't worry.

863
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:35,320
Go.

864
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:53,320
Ying.

865
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,320
I'm sorry.

866
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:03,320
I've been thinking about

867
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:05,320
a lot these days.

868
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:09,320
Even if I regret it again,

869
00:45:11,320 --> 00:45:12,320
I'll still do it.

870
00:45:14,320 --> 00:45:16,320
I won't regret my own actions.

871
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,320
Because I think

872
00:45:20,320 --> 00:45:23,320
whether it's true or false,

873
00:45:23,320 --> 00:45:25,320
whether it's true or false,

874
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:30,320
it's not worth your life.

875
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:35,320
You're sick now.

876
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:36,320
Let's not talk about this.

877
00:45:41,320 --> 00:45:42,320
When I was in high spirits

878
00:45:42,320 --> 00:45:44,320
and in a coma,

879
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:48,320
I was so worried that you'd come to see me.

880
00:45:50,320 --> 00:45:52,320
When I was sick,

881
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:54,320
I was always very vulnerable.

882
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,320
I was free to be separated.

883
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:01,320
I didn't have many relatives by my side.

884
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:05,320
Now, apart from my father,

885
00:46:08,320 --> 00:46:10,320
you're the one who brought me to the hospital.

886
00:46:14,320 --> 00:46:15,320
I was thinking

887
00:46:16,320 --> 00:46:18,320
if you could come to see me,

888
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:20,320
that would prove

889
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:23,320
that I'm still more important

890
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:26,320
than many other things

891
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:29,320
and other people in your heart.

892
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:32,320
If you come,

893
00:46:32,320 --> 00:46:33,320
you'll be angry,

894
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,320
but I can tell you everything clearly.

895
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,320
Next time,

896
00:46:39,320 --> 00:46:40,320
you'll understand my feelings.

897
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:48,320
But you didn't come.

898
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:52,320
I know

899
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,320
that you still hate me.

900
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,320
I didn't hate you.

901
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,320
But in my heart,

902
00:47:02,320 --> 00:47:03,320
you're more important than anyone else.

903
00:47:07,320 --> 00:47:08,320
Don't say those words

904
00:47:08,320 --> 00:47:09,320
that are so heartless.

905
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:17,320
I'll tell you my heart.

906
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:22,320
I want to tell you

907
00:47:24,320 --> 00:47:25,320
what my past,

908
00:47:25,320 --> 00:47:26,320
what my life is.

909
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,320
I don't want to

910
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,320
just want to complete

911
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,320
the task of Xiao Fei's daughter,

912
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
and then go back to the old manor

913
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,320
with you

914
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:36,320
to see the world.

915
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,320
Shiqielang,

916
00:47:41,320 --> 00:47:43,320
but you can't go back.

917
00:47:44,320 --> 00:47:45,320
Your father

918
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:47,320
is the emperor of the modern world.

919
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,320
Sun Jingye died in the world.

920
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,320
The two brothers

921
00:47:51,320 --> 00:47:52,320
are like tigers and tigers.

922
00:47:53,320 --> 00:47:54,320
Don't worry about

923
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:56,320
handing the world to them.

924
00:47:56,320 --> 00:47:57,320
I said it.

925
00:47:58,320 --> 00:47:59,320
I'll go back to Taicun.

926
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:02,320
I'll make the emperor

927
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,320
leave Taicun.

928
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:05,320
How old is Taicun?

929
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,320
Taicun is young.

930
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,320
He's so intelligent.

931
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,320
He's so talented.

932
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,320
If he grows up,

933
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,320
he'll be a rich man.

934
00:48:11,320 --> 00:48:13,320
How can he know the world?

935
00:48:13,320 --> 00:48:15,320
Taicun is the world's true leader.

936
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:16,320
He's the emperor of the modern world.

937
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:19,320
Besides, he's a great emperor.

938
00:48:19,320 --> 00:48:21,320
He'll have many talents.

939
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,320
He'll help you

940
00:48:22,320 --> 00:48:24,320
to be a great emperor.

941
00:48:24,320 --> 00:48:26,320
Do you think your two brothers

942
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,320
will let Taicun live to the age of ten?

943
00:48:28,320 --> 00:48:29,320
To be honest,

944
00:48:30,320 --> 00:48:32,320
you think I should be the emperor?

945
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
That's right.

946
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:35,320
Because I think you're the one

947
00:48:35,320 --> 00:48:36,320
who's suitable to be

948
00:48:36,320 --> 00:48:38,320
the world's leader.

949
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:41,320
You're a generous man.

950
00:48:41,320 --> 00:48:42,320
You're a generous man.

951
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,320
You'll lead the people.

952
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:47,320
You're a good man.

953
00:48:47,320 --> 00:48:48,320
As for the leader,

954
00:48:48,320 --> 00:48:49,320
you're the one who's the one

955
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:50,320
who's the one who's the one who's the one.

956
00:48:50,320 --> 00:48:51,320
You're the one who's the one

957
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:52,320
who's the one who's the one.

958
00:48:52,320 --> 00:48:53,320
If you're the crown prince,

959
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:55,320
the court will not object to it.

960
00:48:56,320 --> 00:48:57,320
Without the court,

961
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,320
the people will live a good life.

962
00:49:01,320 --> 00:49:02,320
Shiqin,

963
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:03,320
you'll be a good emperor

964
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:05,320
who won't let anyone else be the emperor.

965
00:49:05,320 --> 00:49:07,320
If you're the emperor,

966
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,320
in the next decades,

967
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,320
you'll be the crown prince.

968
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,320
You're so intelligent.

969
00:49:14,320 --> 00:49:15,320
You're so intelligent.

970
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:19,320
Some people want to be the crown prince.

971
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,320
But I want to accept it.

972
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:27,320
When the crown prince is too sick,

973
00:49:28,320 --> 00:49:29,320
I'll go to the Lalan Pass

974
00:49:30,320 --> 00:49:32,320
with you to defend the border.

975
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,320
Tang Ruan,

976
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:34,320
I don't want to go back to Lalan Pass.

977
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:45,320
I'll go back to Lalan Pass.

978
00:50:14,320 --> 00:50:15,320
I'll go back to Lalan Pass.

979
00:50:44,320 --> 00:50:48,320
I want to stay for you

980
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:53,320
for the warmth of all the life.

981
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:56,320
If we love each other,

982
00:50:56,320 --> 00:50:59,320
we'll live a good life.

983
00:50:59,320 --> 00:51:02,320
I'll live for you

984
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:06,320
for the love I've always loved.

985
00:51:06,320 --> 00:51:11,320
I'll stay for the warmth of all the life.

986
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:19,320
Wait for my words.

987
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:23,320
If we love each other,

988
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:26,320
we'll live a good life.

989
00:51:26,320 --> 00:51:29,320
I'll live for you

990
00:51:29,320 --> 00:51:33,320
for the warmth of all the life.

991
00:51:34,320 --> 00:51:38,320
I'll live for you

992
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:43,320
for the warmth of all the life.

993
00:51:43,320 --> 00:51:46,320
If we love each other,

994
00:51:46,320 --> 00:51:49,320
we'll live a good life.

995
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:53,320
I'll live for you

996
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,320
for the warmth of all the life.

997
00:51:58,320 --> 00:52:01,320
I'll live for you

998
00:52:01,320 --> 00:52:07,320
for the warmth of all the life.

999
00:52:08,320 --> 00:52:11,320
I'll live for you

1000
00:52:11,320 --> 00:52:16,320
for the warmth of all the life.

1001
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:20,320
I'll live for you

1002
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:24,320
for the warmth of all the life.

1003
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:28,320
I'll live for you

1004
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:32,320
for the warmth of all the life.

1005
00:52:32,320 --> 00:52:35,320
I'll live for you
