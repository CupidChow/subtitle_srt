00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:36,260
Following the waves

6
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,980
I've jumped all night

7
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:43,600

When you and me

15
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,960
I never forget

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,560
The sound of the sword and the light

17
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,960
The sky that has broken through the window

18
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,720
The wind that has blown through the window

19
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,240
The wind that has broken through the window

20
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:15,360
The wind that has blown through the window

21
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,560
The wind that has broken through the window

22
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,560
The wind that has broken through the window

23
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,960
The wind that has broken through the window

00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,960
The wind that has broken through the window

25
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,760
The wind that has broken through the window

26
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,080
Will make you stand on your own

27
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,600
You never obey

28
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,000
The many chains you lay

29
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:36,440
Oil up your hands

30
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,280
Look at the load of hard work

31
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:45,300
The integrity will not be paid

00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,260
Come here.

35
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,520
What a girl!

36
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,540
He doesn't comfort me.

37
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,720
She is thisBack again.

Zhang I

39
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:58,380
I want to stay around the magic field

40
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,020
and stay here until the end of my life.

41
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,220
You should...

42
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:09,780
Brother, your kingdom

43
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,940
ends in a great fear of conquer.

44
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,580
Retreat now!

45
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,260
I wait for your return!

46
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,500
I will return!

47
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,300
Fighting, please.

48
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:28,120
one.

49
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:31,040
two.

50
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:34,920
three.

51
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:35,120
What's wrong, mom?

52
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,920
Can I make you one please?

53
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
Three, three, three.

54
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:06,660
Who should be the ballad singer?

55
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,940
Just a crayfish.

56
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:15,100
Get ready.

57
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:40,520
I love the promise I made for you

58
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:47,320
I will love you for the rest of my life

59
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,520
I love you for your life

60
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:57,320
I will be with you for the rest of my life

61
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:03,520
If we can be together for love

62
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:10,120
I will love you for the rest of my life

63
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:22,120
I will wait for the moment when the memory is gone

64
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:30,120
I will remember the promise I made for you

65
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,720
I will love you for the rest of my life

66
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,720
I will wait for you for the rest of my life

67
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,720
I will wait for the moment when the memory is gone

68
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,720
I will wait for the moment when the memory is gone

69
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,720
I will wait for the moment when the memory is gone

70
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:35,720
I will wait for the moment when the memory is gone

71
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,720
Taozi, wake up

72
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,120
I finally found you in Lanzang River

73
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,520
Although Miss Taozi hurt you, you are still in a bad mood

74
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:57,720
What?

75
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,120
Did Miss Taozi usually take any medicine?

76
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,520
Or did she take any medicine before she was hurt?

77
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,120
She has a lot of blood flow and is slower than normal people

78
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,320
Although she was hurt, she still has a lot of anger and fear

79
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,320
I beg you, I beg you, I beg you, please save her, I beg you

80
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,320
I can only try my best to save her

81
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,720
To be honest, it's not a good chance

82
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,920
She is badly injured, maybe she can't be saved

83
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:28,720
Medicine?

84
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,720
Yes, medicine, she has medicine

85
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,320
You see the medicine, can you save her?

86
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,320
Yes

87
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:44,920
Taozi

88
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,720
I bow to father and mother

89
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,720
Brother Wu Liang, what's wrong with you?

90
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,720
The crown prince is in a coma

91
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,720
But yesterday was a good night, the palace gate was closed

92
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:22,720
I was so worried

93
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,720
The crown prince is in a coma, what's wrong?

94
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,720
I don't know

95
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:31,720
But the crown prince personally held the crown prince

96
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,720
The doctors all saw it, they said the crown prince is in a coma

97
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,720
But the crown prince wouldn't believe anything

98
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:43,720
And he was shot by the car

99
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,720
He was shot by the car

100
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,720
He was shot by the car

101
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,720
And he was shot by the car

102
00:09:53,720 --> 00:09:55,720
And took the crown princess away

103
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:57,720
Nonsense

104
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
The crown prince is sad and depressed, he will be in a coma

105
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,720
Your Majesty, why don't you ask him?

106
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,720
I asked him yesterday

107
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:13,720
But he was so stubborn, he refused to come to the palace

108
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,720
Your highness, I'm afraid that you might be afraid

109
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,720
I'm afraid, I'm worried about you

110
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,720
Brother Wu Liang

111
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,720
Don't worry, the crown prince will be fine

112
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:36,720
Don't worry, after the funeral, I will ask the crown prince to serve you as the crown princess

113
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,720
All right, you can leave now

114
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,720
I'll take my leave

115
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:03,720
How dare you

116
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,720
How dare you, you've been hiding it all night

117
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,720
Don't come to me, I told you

118
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,720
So I'm going to search the city

119
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,720
I know you shouldn't come to me

120
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,720
But it's urgent, I'm here to tell you

121
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,720
Where is the letter from Liu Chengfeng?

122
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:30,720
My crown prince came to report that he's in the Eastern Palace

123
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,720
Oh no

124
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,720
If the crown prince knows about this

125
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,720
He will kill the crown princess

126
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,720
That's the crime of the super clan

127
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Don't worry about killing me

128
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:52,720
We're in the city now

129
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,720
It's not a big deal to kill me

130
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,720
How could I want to kill you?

131
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:05,720
Don't worry, I'm glad that you have a plan for the crown prince

132
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:06,720
I have a way

133
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:20,720
So Liu Chengfeng got the letter from the prime minister and Sun Jing

134
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:23,720
He threatened the prime minister

135
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,720
With the Prime Minister's arrangement

136
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,720
He and Liu Chengfeng left the house

137
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:31,720
He tried to kill Cuiyi to end the case

138
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:34,720
And then he broke the family rule

139
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,720
Yes

140
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,720
At the same time

141
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:47,720
I found the secret letter from Sun Jing and the prime minister

142
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,720
I couldn't find out who it was

143
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:53,720
Sun Jing left the house

144
00:12:53,720 --> 00:12:55,720
He burned the whole house

145
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:59,720
I took the people to search the city without the power of the fire

146
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:04,720
I didn't expect it to be Gu Xiao

147
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,720
I told you everything

148
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,720
Because you risked your life

149
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,720
I wanted to avenge you

150
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:18,720
I didn't want to kill you

151
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,720
You can prove it

152
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,720
I did it

153
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,720
I gave you the master's letter

154
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I will keep it safe

155
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,720
You can't say anything to him

156
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:40,720
I know

157
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:43,720
But he is your son

158
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:46,720
He is not a good man

159
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,720
Now that he is dead

160
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,720
I can only take care of his life

161
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
Master

162
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,720
You can take Liu Chengfeng's body away

163
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,720
Thank you, Your Highness

164
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,720
Your Highness

165
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
I heard that the crown princess is injured

166
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:24,720
Don't you know how she is?

167
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,720
What are you doing with this?

168
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:34,720
In the grassland

169
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,720
There is a lake

170
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:41,720
If the south lake is open and blue

171
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,720
It's like a deep blue sea

172
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,720
You and Xiao Fei live on the lake

173
00:14:49,720 --> 00:14:51,720
So you have to be careful

174
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,720
When spring comes

175
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,720
When I open the door

176
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,720
You will know

177
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,720
You are here to see me

178
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,720
I want to see you

179
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:17,720
I want to apologize

180
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,720
If you want to ask me

181
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:23,720
No

182
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:25,720
No

183
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,720
You don't have to tell the crown princess

184
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,720
Please don't mention the prince's death

185
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:33,720
Let the crown princess

186
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:36,720
Because you still live

187
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
You mean

188
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,720
The crown princess really wants to rebel?

189
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,720
Your Majesty

190
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,720
I went back last night and I was so worried

191
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:02,720
I thought the crown princess was suspicious

192
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,720
I was worried about the safety of the crown princess

193
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,720
I went to the palace this morning

194
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:09,720
I was afraid of the worst

195
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,720
I was afraid of the worst

196
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,720
I have only one son

197
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,720
I didn't expect him to be suspicious

198
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,720
I wanted to rebel

199
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,720
Your Majesty

200
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,720
The throne is still the first to take back the military power of Jin

201
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
As long as the military power is still in your hands

202
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
The crown prince is heartless

203
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,720
He dare not act rashly

204
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:35,720
But the Jin army is all from the Zhengxi army

205
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,720
They all listen to the crown prince

206
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,720
Your Majesty, you are ordered by the heaven

207
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,720
It's the order of the emperor

208
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:44,720
How can the Jin army have the courage to resist?

209
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,720
Do you understand?

210
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,720
The only thing I know is that the emperor sent people to find the crown prince

211
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,720
He ordered him to hand over the military power

212
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,720
After he got the military power

213
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:58,720
He sent people who trusted him

214
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:01,720
He ordered the emperor to take over the military power

215
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:04,720
This can't be done by the officials

216
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:06,720
It's better for someone to collude with the crown prince

217
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,720
That's not necessary

218
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,720
The emperor is not Guo Changlin

219
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,720
He is my second son

220
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:14,720
I dare to guarantee that he is loyal to the emperor

221
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:15,720
He is a useful person

222
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:20,720
What if the crown prince doesn't want to hand over the military power?

223
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:22,720
If the crown prince doesn't want to hand over the military power

224
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:24,720
Then it's not just a resistance

225
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,720
Then there is a rebellion

226
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:33,720
But what if the crown prince comes to the palace?

227
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,720
Your Majesty, you don't have to worry

228
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,720
There are some soldiers in the mansion

229
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,720
They are loyal to the emperor

230
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,720
Your Majesty can ensure their military power

231
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,720
In addition, the dishes of the six chiefs

232
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,720
Are the old people of the late emperor

233
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
They are reliable

234
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,720
They can be useful to the emperor as soon as possible

235
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,720
This is a way

236
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Your Majesty, since you have taken back the military power

237
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,720
You still have to take one more imperial decree

238
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
To abolish the crown prince

239
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:04,720
If the crown prince doesn't have a name

240
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:05,720
Even if he has a rebellion

241
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,720
Then the people who have him will be less and less

242
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:12,720
You are right

243
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:17,720
Prime minister

244
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,720
I will give you all the things I have

245
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,720
Yes, your Majesty

246
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,720
The original order came

247
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:30,720
It means you handed over the military power

248
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:31,720
to the emperor

249
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:32,720
Do you want to give it to me?

250
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:33,720
Very good

251
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,720
Your Majesty

252
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,720
Your Highness

253
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,720
You mean to give it to them?

254
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:44,720
I said

255
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,720
You just said that Taozi was not dead

256
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:50,720
If Ying knows

257
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,720
He will be happy

258
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,720
The doctor said

259
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,720
Although Taozi has a superior family

260
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:03,720
But

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,720
But he can save his life

262
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,720
He doesn't want to die

263
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:10,720
I am worried

264
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,720
I am worried that he may never be able to save his life

265
00:19:17,720 --> 00:19:19,720
The chaos of the two kings

266
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,720
I was severely injured

267
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,720
I am very dangerous

268
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,720
Your Majesty

269
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,720
Ying has never been a new god

270
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,720
She told me that

271
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,720
She can't bear to

272
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,720
To take all the gods in the world

273
00:19:45,720 --> 00:19:47,720
As long as I can be safe

274
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:50,720
You know

275
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,720
I never believe in gods

276
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:55,720
Never

277
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,720
But in those days

278
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,720
I want to worship all gods in the world

279
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
The blood of Qianzheng

280
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
I also want

281
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:14,720
I also want to worship all gods in the world

282
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,720
But

283
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,720
But I never have any hope

284
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:29,720
I want to worship all gods in the world

285
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
I even didn't see the last cloud in his life

286
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:40,720
He didn't see me

287
00:20:43,720 --> 00:20:44,720
before he died

288
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:50,720
I don't know

289
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,720
whether he is afraid or not

290
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:55,720
or not

291
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:10,720
So

292
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:14,720
Taozi still has a superior family

293
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,720
and now he still has a superior family

294
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
I still have hope

295
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,720
I won't save the Ice Manor

296
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,720
I want to replace Jin Juan

297
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,720
I want to hold on to His Majesty and take revenge

298
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,720
As long as I am still here

299
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,720
He can't get the throne

300
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,720
I want to be a king

301
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,720
I want to be a king

302
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,720
I want to be a king

303
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,720
I want to be a king

304
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,720
I want to be a king

305
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,720
I want to be a king

306
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,720
I want to be a king

307
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:42,720
I want to be a king

308
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:46,720
I want to be a king

309
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,720
I want to be a king

310
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,720
I want to be a king

311
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,720
I want to be a king

312
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,720
I want to be a king

313
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,720
I want to be a king

314
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,720
I want to be a king

315
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,720
I want to be a king

316
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
I want to be a king

317
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,720
I want to be a king

318
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
Ying

319
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,720
This is your companion

320
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:06,720
Liu Zhe

321
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,720
Xiaowen

322
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I will take you today

323
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:26,720
to be your last son

324
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:31,720
We are together

325
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:45,720
We are together

326
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,720
Brother Liang

327
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,720
Brother Liang

328
00:24:57,720 --> 00:24:58,720
Brother Liang

329
00:24:59,720 --> 00:25:01,720
His Highness is crazy

330
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Shut up

331
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:07,720
I think His Highness is not crazy

332
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:08,720
You are crazy

333
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:10,720
What's wrong?

334
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,720
Your Highness

335
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:15,720
Your Highness

336
00:25:15,720 --> 00:25:16,720
You want to carry the crown princess' coffin

337
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
to the palace to see His Majesty

338
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,720
What?

339
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,720
Go and persuade His Highness

340
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
Your Highness

341
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:27,720
It seems that you are confused

342
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:40,720
Your Highness

343
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,720
Move

344
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:08,720
I know that you are sad

345
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,720
But you are carrying the crown princess' coffin

346
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:11,720
What are you doing?

347
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
Are you going to interrogate the emperor?

348
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Or are you going to curse His Majesty?

349
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,720
His Highness is sick

350
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:17,720
and the emperor is in trouble

351
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:18,720
Even if you are sad

352
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,720
you shouldn't do this

353
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:21,720
The emperor is in trouble

354
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:23,720
Madam

355
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,720
You are still pretending to be innocent

356
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,720
Why did the crown princess die?

357
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,720
You don't know?

358
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,720
I...

359
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,720
I don't know

360
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:49,720
Your Highness

361
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,720
Your Highness, please don't do this

362
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:52,720
I am so sad

363
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,720
But I don't know

364
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,720
You...

365
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I know that you are looking forward to her death

366
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,720
Your father and you are looking forward to her death

367
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:11,720
But let me tell you

368
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:14,720
Even if the crown princess is dead

369
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:17,720
you shouldn't take her as your son

370
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:19,720
I have been with you for my whole life

371
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,720
I just want to recommend someone

372
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:23,720
She is alive

373
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:26,720
and she is my only son

374
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,720
She is dead

375
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:31,720
and she is my only son

376
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:33,720
No one can replace her

377
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:36,720
You can't

378
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,720
No one can be in this world

379
00:27:41,720 --> 00:27:42,720
Your Highness

380
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I never ask for her son's treatment

381
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:47,720
I just love you

382
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:48,720
Is it wrong in my mind?

383
00:27:49,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Get out

384
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,720
You are not the second emperor of the East

385
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,720
Don't show up in front of me

386
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,720
Or I will kill you

387
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,720
Your Highness

388
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:27,720
Your Majesty

389
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,720
Your Majesty, you don't need to worry

390
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,720
These soldiers and generals are my men

391
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,720
They can be used as a base

392
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,720
If the crown prince is really a rebel

393
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:39,720
even if I die

394
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,720
I will protect you

395
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:43,720
Moreover, there is also a recipe

396
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:45,720
to protect the emperor

397
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:50,720
Your Majesty

398
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,720
Your Majesty

399
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,720
The crown prince is in the palace

400
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:57,720
He is coming

401
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:01,720
What...

402
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:03,720
What are you doing?

403
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:05,720
Your Majesty

404
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,720
The crown prince is not willing to hand over the military uniform

405
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,720
He is obviously against you

406
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
You can take the next step

407
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,720
I will make a move

408
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,720
If the crown prince breaks into the palace

409
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:17,720
he will kill you

410
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,720
Your Majesty, you can't do that

411
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,720
Your Majesty, you can't do that

412
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,720
Your Majesty, you are only one son

413
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,720
Did the crown prince make a big mistake?

414
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,720
Your Majesty, you should come to the Zhao Baiguan to discuss it

415
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,720
Your Majesty

416
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:36,720
It's not that I really want to kill the crown prince

417
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,720
I just want to stand in the palace

418
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:41,720
and give the crown prince the order

419
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,720
If the crown prince

420
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,720
is willing to hand over the military uniform

421
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,720
and stop fighting

422
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:48,720
and go back to the city

423
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,720
it will be a big joy

424
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,720
If the crown prince is willing to give the military uniform

425
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,720
and break into the palace

426
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,720
it will be a great shame

427
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:58,720
and a great shame

428
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,720
The party will be against you

429
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,720
Please give me the order

430
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,720
Your Majesty, you can't do that

431
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,720
I will give you the order

432
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,720
Yes, Your Majesty

433
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,720
Pass the order

434
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:37,720
Your Majesty

435
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:40,720
his Majesty is draggingiver

436
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,720
So the Li Nhi You won't enter the palace

437
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:47,720
if the crown prince massa

438
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,720
He.*

439
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,720
Your Majesty

440
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,720
Your Majesty

441
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,720
Your Majesty

442
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,300
His Majesty allows

443
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,720
He allows Li Nhi You should not enter the palace

444
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,140
I'll send suction.

445
00:31:02,780 --> 00:31:03,860
Cut the jump.

446
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:16,660
Ag 대회.

447
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,200
Excuse me.

448
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,240
I need to help you.

449
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:25,340
Solo for the entirety, please.

450
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:26,260
The Kiran Mirror.

451
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,120
Harbing allies.

452
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:29,780
Only when Mrs Zhou gives our comrades the stone

453
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,940
Also

454
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:35,540
Stage 9

455
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:58,020
Pre Illustration

456
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,660
Aside

457
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:01,660
I'm afraid I'll be late.

458
00:32:01,660 --> 00:32:02,660
I'll be late.

459
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,660
I'll be late.

460
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:04,660
I'll be late.

461
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,660
I'll be late.

462
00:32:05,660 --> 00:32:06,660
I'll be late.

463
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,660
I'll be late.

464
00:32:07,660 --> 00:32:08,660
I'll be late.

465
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:09,660
I'll be late.

466
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:10,660
I'll be late.

467
00:32:10,660 --> 00:32:11,660
I'll be late.

468
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:12,660
I'll be late.

00:32:12,660 --> 00:32:13,660

00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:14,660
I'll be late.

00:32:14,660 --> 00:32:15,660
I'll be late.

472
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:16,660
I'll be late.

473
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,660
I'll be late.

474
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,660
I'll be late.

475
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,660
I'll be late.

476
00:32:19,660 --> 00:32:20,660
I'll be late.

477
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,660
I'll be late.

478
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:22,660
I'll be late.

479
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,660
I'll be late.

480
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,660
I'll be late.

481
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,660
I'll be late.

482
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,660
I'll be late.

483
00:32:26,660 --> 00:32:27,660
I'll be late.

484
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,660
I'll be late.

485
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,660
Your Highness.

486
00:32:30,660 --> 00:32:32,660
It's been a long time.

487
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:34,660
Are you going to rebel against the imperial army?

488
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:39,660
You're a commoner.

489
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,660
You're a evil person.

490
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,660
You've been a great leader in my family.

491
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,660
You thought you were a righteous person.

492
00:32:45,660 --> 00:32:47,660
But you've colluded with Sun Jing.

493
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:50,660
So you're the greatest spy in this court.

494
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,660
Nonsense.

495
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,660
You're going to rebel against the imperial army

496
00:32:55,660 --> 00:32:56,660
without any trap?

497
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,660
You're here without any trap?

498
00:32:58,660 --> 00:32:59,660
Your Majesty.

499
00:32:59,660 --> 00:33:01,660
Please give me the order.

500
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,660
Take the crown prince down.

501
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:10,660
Your Majesty.

502
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,660
Please give me the order.

503
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:16,660
You...

504
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,660
I'm telling you.

505
00:33:18,660 --> 00:33:20,660
Throw the sword out of your hand.

506
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,660
Stop the rescue.

507
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,660
I won't save you.

508
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,660
Your Majesty.

509
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:26,660
Are you still a fool?

510
00:33:27,660 --> 00:33:28,660
He...

511
00:33:28,660 --> 00:33:30,660
had colluded with Sun Jing.

512
00:33:30,660 --> 00:33:32,660
The so-called loyalty and the so-called greed

513
00:33:33,660 --> 00:33:35,660
are all the hardships he and Sun Jing have experienced.

514
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:36,660
Later,

515
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:38,660
he colluded with Jie Shuo

516
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
and killed General Cui.

517
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:43,660
He killed the imperial army in the court.

518
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,660
He killed the crown princess.

519
00:33:46,660 --> 00:33:47,660
Now,

520
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,660
you still don't understand?

521
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,660
Your Majesty, please give me the order.

522
00:33:52,660 --> 00:33:53,660
Take the crown prince down.

523
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,660
Your Majesty.

524
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:02,660
Take it down.

525
00:34:15,660 --> 00:34:16,660
Father.

526
00:34:20,660 --> 00:34:21,660
These are all the prisoners.

527
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:22,660
They're all the prisoners.

528
00:34:22,660 --> 00:34:23,660
They're all the prisoners.

529
00:34:23,660 --> 00:34:24,660
They're all the prisoners.

530
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:26,660
They're all the prisoners who brought them in on purpose.

531
00:34:26,660 --> 00:34:27,660
Look at the seal.

532
00:34:27,660 --> 00:34:28,660
Don't you understand?

533
00:34:35,660 --> 00:34:36,660
Stop it.

534
00:34:36,660 --> 00:34:37,660
Put the sword down.

535
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:38,660
Let go of His Majesty.

536
00:34:39,660 --> 00:34:40,660
Let go of His Majesty.

537
00:34:40,660 --> 00:34:41,660
Didn't you say

538
00:34:41,660 --> 00:34:42,660
there are many things to be sure of?

539
00:34:43,660 --> 00:34:44,660
What's going on?

540
00:34:47,660 --> 00:34:48,660
Put it down.

541
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,660
Who are these people?

542
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:53,660
They're all the prisoners.

543
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:56,660
Put the sword down.

544
00:34:57,660 --> 00:34:58,660
Prepare a horse.

545
00:34:58,660 --> 00:34:59,660
The order is to keep the line.

546
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:00,660
Don't stop.

547
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:01,660
Let's leave safely.

548
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,660
If you dare to touch my father and my son,

549
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:07,660
I'll kill you.

550
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,660
You.

551
00:35:09,660 --> 00:35:10,660
Don't blame me.

552
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:11,660
You dare to run away.

553
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,660
The death of the dead

554
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:14,660
is your words.

555
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:16,660
Don't force me to die.

556
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:18,660
This is your father's life.

557
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:20,660
You're going to kill me anyway.

558
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:22,660
Before you die,

559
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,660
pull the emperor's back.

560
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,660
You're late.

561
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:26,660
If you don't want to die,

562
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:28,660
let's leave.

563
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:29,660
Prepare a horse.

564
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:32,660
I'm going to leave with your father.

565
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:33,660
And the empress.

566
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,660
No.

567
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,660
Yuan Changshi,

568
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,660
send the order to prepare a horse.

00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:40,660
Yes.

570
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:44,660
It's a good thing.

571
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,660
I'll ask His Majesty

572
00:35:46,660 --> 00:35:48,660
to come to our base.

573
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:49,660
Let's go.

00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,660
Back.

00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:42,700
Silly.

626
00:43:44,980 --> 00:43:47,180
I don't allow you to do such a thing.

627
00:43:51,820 --> 00:43:53,020
You're scaring me.

628
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:58,380
I don't care.

629
00:43:58,820 --> 00:43:59,620
You have to accompany me.

630
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:01,900
You've been so loyal to me

631
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:02,820
and cried so many times.

632
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:05,580
Now the people in the court

633
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,100
know that I'm a bitter boy.

634
00:44:09,540 --> 00:44:10,340
Okay.

635
00:44:11,060 --> 00:44:12,340
How can I accompany you?

636
00:44:13,700 --> 00:44:14,620
I can't think of anything now.

637
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:16,700
Maybe

638
00:44:17,460 --> 00:44:19,180
I'll think of it after a few more hours.

639
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:28,620
Oh no.

640
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,340
What's the matter?

641
00:44:32,780 --> 00:44:33,860
I forgot something important.

642
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,780
I forgot to go to the court

643
00:44:35,900 --> 00:44:37,020
to find out the spy.

644
00:44:37,620 --> 00:44:38,940
I also forgot to inform the imperial guards

645
00:44:39,020 --> 00:44:40,580
where to keep an eye on the bad thing or not.

646
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,940
The head of asymmetry.

647
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:49,420
I forgot to change it to even greater.

648
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:55,420
