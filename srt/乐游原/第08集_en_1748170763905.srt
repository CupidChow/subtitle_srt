00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
What kind of ignorant fellow can be so baking?

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,240
Your silence

00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:23,160
This piece of sudden

tracing wolf

8
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,960
My night has passed, the night has become long

9
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:42,960
I want to forget the quiet capital city, the long and long

10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,960
When we meet, we are separated

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,960
When we meet, we are far away

12
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
I never forget

13
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,960
The light of the sky is shining

14
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,960
The sky is broken, how many dreams are there

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,960
The wind blows in the wind, the wind blows cold

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,960
The sky is full of clouds, the sky is full of clouds

17
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:13,960
The wind blows, the wind blows cold

18
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:15,960
The cold snow is cold, the cold is cold

19
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,960
The moon is far away, the moon is far away

20
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,960
I never forget

21
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,960
Full Sanction

Aança master

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,960
The appearance of the sky is not familiar

24
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,960
Knock-Docratic

25
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,960
In the evening

26
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,960
Look for all the созд enterprise

27
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:39,960
That everything embarrassed

Directed by Yueni Douglas

the

30
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,060
Good.

31
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,320
Good.

32
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:30,500
This is a good bet.

33
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,600
Good.

34
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:33,780
Great.

35
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:34,500
Digital General,

36
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:35,760
we'll have our truth written.

37
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:36,520
Write,

38
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:40,640
both are clear Rivers 멋,

39
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:42,020
bring them up.

40
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:51,400
Huh?

41
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:53,640
All of us are the top of the Jinxi Army.

42
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,040
We are the top of the Guangguan Army.

43
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
We can't even get this number.

44
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Feng Tiao and Yushuan.

45
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,000
Good.

46
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,400
Feng Tiao and Yushuan.

47
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,440
Good.

48
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:14,480
Good.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Good.

50
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:23,400
Good.

51
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:32,880
If I were in the old manor,

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,160
and I were born with a bunch of fire,

53
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,680
I would definitely have to bake a yellow lamb.

54
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,960
It's so juicy.

55
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,480
Don't be so arrogant.

56
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:40,680
When I was little,

57
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
my mother used to

58
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,200
bake some jade cakes for me in the fire.

59
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:48,920
I'll bake you the next time.

60
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,920
I'm a little hungry.

61
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,240
Let's go.

62
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:56,600
I'll take you to eat.

63
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,360
The wontons are really good.

64
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
Thank you, young lady.

65
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,920
This is my own stock.

66
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:13,240
So the taste is really good.

67
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,560
Mr. Li,

68
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,840
how's the business tonight?

69
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,240
There are not many people here.

70
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,800
Everyone is going to watch.

71
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:22,040
They are all fighting.

72
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,400
They are killing.

73
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:25,520
The original one is still killing.

74
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,040
The wind is blowing in the Han Palace in Binh Zhaocheng.

75
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:34,040
Kill them.

76
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,040
Kill them.

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,040
Kill them.

78
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:44,040
Kill them.

79
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,040
Kill them.

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
Young master,

81
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,280
we have arranged everything.

82
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,560
The time has come.

83
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,560
Kill Han Li.

84
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:02,560
Ji He Shen.

85
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,680
Master.

86
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,840
Master.

87
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,240
Let's go.

88
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,240
Two people.

89
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:38,640
Look at our Hu'er.

90
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,640
This is the good quality of the cow skin.

91
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,040
My wife is really good at sewing.

92
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,640
The three-layered leather is really firm.

93
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,240
Master, you are from the Xishuo.

94
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,840
You can't bring her here.

95
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,840
She is not going to send me.

96
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,040
Young lady,

97
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:55,040
I will buy one for your husband.

98
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:59,440
I have already fixed the windmill for you.

99
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:02,240
Shouldn't you send me the same thing?

100
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,240
He is not my husband.

101
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,840
Thank you.

102
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,040
You are very match.

103
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,440
Did I see it wrong?

104
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:16,040
Young lady, what is that young master asking?

105
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,240
Hu'er is asking but he is not buying.

106
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,240
I don't know what he is thinking.

107
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,440
It seems that the Royal Descendant has no plan.

108
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,240
He has arranged a big show.

109
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,840
He Xiao praised me for you.

110
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,240
I always think that my plan is not good enough.

111
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:47,040
The one who drinks water is the father.

112
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,240
The one who drinks wine is the father.

113
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:54,440
The father is the father.

114
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,440
Shi Qiang.

115
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,040
Bai Yong.

116
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,040
Shi Qiang.

117
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,640
Why are you like this?

118
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:01,240
It's okay.

119
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
Shi Qiang.

120
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,040
How is it?

121
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:04,640
The one who should be killed, the one who should be caught,

122
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,640
the one who should be caught is not spicy.

123
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Where is the center?

124
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,040
Old Huang, bring it out.

125
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,840
The nurse uniform?

126
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:10,840
But we found it.

127
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,240
It's right here.

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,440
It's right here.

129
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,840
They are so stupid.

130
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,840
They don't even know how to move.

131
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:18,840
They are not stupid.

132
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,840
Shi Qiang is too smart.

133
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,840
Too stupid.

134
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,840
Too smart.

135
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,840
Too smart.

136
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,840
They are not fighting.

137
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:26,040
Didn't you put it in your pocket?

138
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,240
You just said that you want to see the tiger and kill the bull.

139
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,240
Hurry and find it.

140
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:30,240
Where did you put it?

141
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,640
Old Huang, is it right here?

142
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,240
I hope you, Cui Jiajun,

143
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,240
will be able to capture the royal Descendant.

144
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,840
You can't just leave it here.

145
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:38,240
You can't just leave it here.

146
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,440
You can't just leave it here.

147
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
You can't just leave it here.

148
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:42,440
After the royal Descendant is here,

149
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,240
you don't have to hide it.

150
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,840
Chen Xing.

151
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,240
The tiger and the bull are fighting.

152
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,440
The tiger and the bull are fighting.

153
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,240
The tiger and the bull are fighting.

154
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,240
The tiger and the bull are fighting.

155
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,240
The tiger and the bull are fighting.

156
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,040
I also want to know,

157
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,440
aren't you the royal Descendant?

158
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,240
Aren't you going to fight with the Four-Tiger Gang?

159
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,440
You are Cui Jiajun's man,

160
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,040
but you are not in the dark.

161
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
How can you come here now

162
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,240
and help this little white face?

163
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,040
How dare you?

164
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,240
That's right.

165
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,640
What's going on?

166
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:12,040
Nonsense.

167
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,240
You are going to fight with the Four-Tiger Gang.

168
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,440
Don't you dare to be so bold?

169
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,440
Shut up.

170
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:18,840
Li Huan Sun,

171
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,240
what do you mean?

172
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,040
How can you say that my subordinate is your lover?

173
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,040
How can you do that?

174
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,040
Let them go and keep me from Cui Jiajun.

175
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,440
He said it himself.

176
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,440
He told us that

177
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:32,840
he is the lover of the royal Descendant

178
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
and that he will be the wife of the Four-Tiger Gang.

179
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,440
How could he help you?

180
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,440
Ying.

181
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:38,840
Young Master,

182
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:40,240
I pretended to be the royal Descendant

183
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,440
when I was in the Imperial Prison.

184
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:44,440
This person is not well-mannered.

185
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:46,440
That's why I misunderstood him.

186
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:50,640
Gu Xiao Wei,

187
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,840
thank you for your talk.

188
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,040
Let's go.

189
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:54,840
Don't talk to him.

190
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,040
Young Master,

191
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,040
I will be back soon.

192
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,640
How did you guess it?

193
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:05,640
Your men

194
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:07,040
almost turned the Han Mansion upside down.

195
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,040
I knew it.

196
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:09,640
Although you caught Han Li,

197
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,640
you didn't find Hu Fu.

198
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,440
So you didn't steal Hu Fu with Fei Li?

199
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,640
Han Li is a cunning man.

200
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,640
Since he didn't have any body,

201
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:21,440
he didn't find Han Fu's entire mansion.

202
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,840
He must have put him

203
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:25,440
on his most trusted family.

204
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:26,840
And you,

205
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:27,840
you,

206
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,840
you,

207
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:29,840
you,

208
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,040
and you,

209
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,240
you can't get out of the news.

210
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:34,240
Today, Jia Yi killed Han Li.

211
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,640
You came here to rescue Han Li.

212
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,840
You are so cunning.

213
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,440
You are indeed a good man.

214
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:41,840
And you,

215
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,640
you just need to watch over me.

216
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
You can make up for it.

217
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,440
But you are behind.

218
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
That's right.

219
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:52,840
Then I still have a problem.

220
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:54,240
You promised me

221
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,840
to be together with me.

222
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:58,040
You are here to reward me.

223
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,040
Or to watch me personally.

224
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:03,040
In case I find you have a plan.

225
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,440
What about you?

226
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,840
You asked me out of the house

227
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:11,040
to be with me.

228
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,840
Or you don't trust me?

229
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,640
You are afraid that I will find out

230
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,040
and ruin your life?

231
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:23,040
We are...

232
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:25,240
You admit it.

233
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,040
I am not serious.

234
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,240
I can't make it up to you.

235
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
How can I make it up to you?

236
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,240
Thank you.

237
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,240
I have an idea.

238
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,840
Let me go to the palace to fix it.

239
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,440
I will arrange you to stay with me

240
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,040
in the palace

241
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:48,440
where you have been fixed.

242
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Don't worry.

243
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,240
I should save these few days.

244
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,040
I can get out of here as soon as possible.

245
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:53,040
Yu'er is here.

246
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:54,040
I have to go.

247
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:55,640
Take care.

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,040
Oh, my.

249
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:07,880
Dodu has ordered

250
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,760
the girl next to Xiao Shi

251
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,440
to leave the palace as a substitute.

252
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:15,560
What?

253
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,880
She just wants the girl to leave the palace?

254
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,520
Where's Xiao Shi?

255
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,080
She's still angry with me in the palace.

256
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,200
Don't worry.

257
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,800
Since Dodu has lost her love,

258
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,720
we'll have to come step by step.

259
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:29,880
As the saying goes,

260
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,760
the heart can't eat hot tofu.

261
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,160
As long as we remove

262
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,480
the Yu Yi with Xiao Shi,

263
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,760
we won't be able to kill them.

264
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,080
He's the Crown Princess of the Crown Prince.

265
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,440
He colluded with the rebels.

266
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:48,520
Isn't that a simple thing?

267
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:49,800
Sister,

268
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,600
Xiao Shi is just a commoner.

269
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,120
He's only a few years old.

270
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,040
Since he's so stupid,

271
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,040
I'll kill him.

272
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,560
Don't worry, Sister.

273
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,560
I'll be back to Luoyang City soon.

274
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,600
As long as we continue to

275
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:06,240
attack the palace before the war,

276
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:09,320
I'll be in Dodu's heart

277
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,040
and be as weak as a cat.

278
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:18,840
Xiao Wei,

279
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,360
this is my new drug.

280
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,080
It's on the map.

281
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:23,840
Try it.

282
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:24,960
Let me see.

283
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:26,760
What?

284
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:41,640
My lady.

285
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,280
Back in the world,

286
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,600
I'm so upset

287
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:45,880
to save my original life

288
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,920
trying so hard to put away

289
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,200
my sister.

290
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,640
I really over B couId have a lesson.

291
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,640
Thank goodness for the yellow one.

292
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,560
Miss, do you think the yellow one will like this skin care case?

293
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,640
It will definitely like it.

294
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I just added a little bit of the drug.

295
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
I've seen He Xiao Wei.

296
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:18,440
Miss Gu, you're so polite.

297
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,440
He Xiao Wei is so handsome in this outfit.

298
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Miss, the yellow one will make us wear a man's outfit.

299
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:30,440
I think He Xiao Wei is really handsome in this outfit.

300
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Why don't you ask He Xiao Wei to look like this?

301
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:38,440
Shut up. He Xiao Wei is a strong woman in the army.

302
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:41,440
That's why he's so handsome.

303
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:45,440
If I wear this outfit, I'll be tired.

304
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:49,440
It's okay. My clothes are all made by Tao Zi.

305
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
You don't have a man's outfit.

306
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,440
I don't know if they actually made this place very big.

307
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,440
And there are also some tights.

308
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,440
They're also very big.

309
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,440
You need to change the man's outfit you bought from the market.

310
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,440
Tao Zi, take the pictures we made

311
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,440
and send them to Miss Gu's room.

312
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:07,440
Okay.

313
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,440
Thank you so much for He Xiao Wei.

314
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,440
Miss Gu, you're welcome.

315
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,440
Is this the outfit?

316
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,440
This is really expensive. It's hard to cut the money.

317
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,440
No. This is the clothes that the Royal Descendant borrowed from us.

318
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,440
Our lady washed her hands and came in. She wants to return it to her.

319
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,440
Qiu Cui, how dare you?

320
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,440
Actually, last time when Royal Descendant saved me,

321
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,440
he borrowed this coat and made me suffer.

322
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,440
He Xiao Wei misunderstood.

323
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:41,440
What? Miss Gu, why are you saying that?

324
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,440
So...

325
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,440
I won't delay Miss Gu.

326
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:57,440
Xiao Wei, how can they talk?

327
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,440
They always have a lot of trouble.

328
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,440
They're a total of 18-thousand.

329
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,440
They're the women in the cabinet.

330
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,440
They're in the form of a role model.

331
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,440
They're very good at acting.

332
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,440
Okay. Don't look at them.

333
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,440
But they always mention Royal Descendant.

334
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,440
But what does Royal Descendant have to do with us?

335
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,440
What does it have to do with them?

336
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:24,440
How do you know that Royal Descendant has nothing to do with them?

337
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,440
The gentleman is a good-looking man.

338
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:38,440
He's no match for her.

339
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,440
Not bad.

340
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,440
Miss, buy one for your husband.

341
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,440
I've fixed the windmill for you.

342
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,440
Shouldn't you be like me?

343
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:59,440
This auntie is just a little girl.

344
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,440
She's so pretty.

345
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:10,440
Xiao Wei.

346
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,440
I have something to tell you.

347
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,440
Some people are so soft-hearted.

348
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
I've been busy this morning.

349
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,440
I don't know what to do.

350
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,440
Really?

351
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,440
I said I won't send you off.

352
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,440
So I'll just do it.

353
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,440
It seems that the person who gave it to Royal Descendant

354
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,440
must be very important to Royal Descendant.

355
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,440
Of course.

356
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:46,440
I think I'm important to him.

357
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,440
But he...

358
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:50,440
But he's more important to me.

359
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,440
In that case,

360
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,440
I must congratulate Royal Descendant.

361
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,440
What do you think of the person who gave it to me?

362
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,440
Compared with my love?

363
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,440
Royal Descendant was so strict.

364
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
I was so strict

365
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:09,440
that I lied to the people.

366
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,440
But I didn't expect Royal Descendant to be so honest.

367
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:15,440
He even insulted me in front of my husband.

368
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,440
You care about your husband so much?

369
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:18,440
Of course.

370
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,440
Why?

371
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:25,440
I didn't want to be an outsider.

372
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,440
So I didn't tell you.

373
00:17:27,440 --> 00:17:30,440
Actually, I'm the wife of my husband.

374
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,440
So please, Royal Descendant,

375
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,440
don't insult me in front of my husband.

376
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:37,440
I'm innocent.

377
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,440
Let's go, Tao Zi.

378
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,440
Wei,

379
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,440
why did you tell Royal Descendant

380
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,440
that you're his concubine?

381
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:56,440
Today's negotiation is urgent.

382
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,440
If you want to mess up the new god of Li Royal Descendant,

383
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:01,440
you must have a good news.

384
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,440
If you mess up the new god of Li Royal Descendant,

385
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,440
you'll have a chance to break your daughter's reputation.

386
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,440
You're so innocent.

387
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,440
It's not his business to be a stranger.

388
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,440
You're an outsider.

389
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,440
Do you want to marry him?

390
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:19,440
Silly girl.

391
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,440
Men who can marry me in this world

392
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:22,440
don't say that.

393
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,440
No.

394
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,440
You always said

395
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,440
men who can marry you in this world

396
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,440
are afraid of being born.

397
00:18:30,440 --> 00:18:32,440
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

398
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,440
You finally found out

399
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,440
that you can marry your husband in this world.

400
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,440
Tell me who he is.

401
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:40,440
He is...

402
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:43,440
I won't tell you.

403
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,440
Go.

404
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:45,440
Go.

405
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:46,440
Tell me.

406
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,440
I want to know.

407
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,440
Since the County Governor doesn't recognize me,

408
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:56,440
since our Cui family is in the martial arts world,

409
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,440
the County Governor is still ours.

410
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:00,440
Then you're taking the tiger's clothing to the city.

411
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,440
Don't think I don't know.

412
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,440
Don't you want to be Han Li?

413
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:05,440
With the tiger's clothing,

414
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:07,440
we can use Han Li to help.

415
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:08,440
If we do that,

416
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:09,440
we'll be able to take the whole Cui City

417
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,440
and take the whole Cui City.

418
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,440
The Cui City is yours.

419
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:14,440
What's the use of taking Han Li?

420
00:19:14,440 --> 00:19:16,440
Then you'll give the royal army

421
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,440
back to us.

422
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,440
Today,

423
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:22,440
there should be a result.

424
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,440
I'm afraid that my grandson

425
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,440
doesn't speak so well.

426
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,440
Han Li.

427
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:32,440
I want to take the throne.

428
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,440
Sir.

429
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,440
Your hair is loose.

430
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
I'll help you comb it.

431
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:42,440
Okay.

432
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:00,440
Shi Qi Lang.

433
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,440
Actually, about the He Xiao Wei of Cui family,

434
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,440
I don't know if I should say something.

435
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,440
No.

436
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,440
Okay.

437
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:14,440
Our young master said that

438
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,440
we've talked for several days.

439
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,440
According to the Western Regions,

440
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,440
Han Li was obtained by the Zhengxi army.

441
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,440
Then the whole Cui City is all of Zhengxi army.

442
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:26,440
But the tiger's clothing is obtained by Cui family.

443
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,440
The Zhengzhou city is

444
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,440
the reason why we're Cui family.

445
00:20:30,440 --> 00:20:32,440
We found the tiger's clothing first.

446
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,440
You took the gold.

447
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:38,440
And the Zhengxi army is all of the Cui city.

448
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,440
You go to the city to steal the gold.

449
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,440
Take away the grain.

450
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,440
Give the grain back first.

451
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:44,440
And then talk about the construction.

452
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,440
That's enough.

453
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,440
Why don't you all discuss it

454
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,440
with each other?

455
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,440
You're better at singing than singing.

456
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
What do you mean?

457
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,440
You want to take advantage of the Zhengxi army.

458
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,440
That's the advantage of the Zhengxi army.

459
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,440
Can't you say that?

460
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,440
Since it's a business,

461
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,440
we can't let the Cui family

462
00:21:02,440 --> 00:21:05,440
take advantage of the Zhengxi army.

463
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,440
Okay.

464
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:08,440
Then tell me.

465
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:10,440
How are you going to take advantage of it?

466
00:21:11,440 --> 00:21:12,440
Royal Descendant,

467
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:14,440
you don't want to make a plan to

468
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,440
take the gold and take it back to Liangdu.

469
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,440
So the amount of the gold and the gold

470
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:20,440
you have now,

471
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,440
let alone take it back to Liangdu,

472
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,440
it's not even possible to touch the water.

473
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:26,440
If we continue to take the gold and the gold

474
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:27,440
in the Zhou Dynasty,

475
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,440
I'm afraid that the amount of the gold

476
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:30,440
will be more and more insufficient.

477
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:32,440
Now you and the two armies

478
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,440
have been fighting for the problem of the Jianzhou.

479
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,440
But according to the rules,

480
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,440
the tiger suit has been given to the Cui family.

481
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,440
Then the Jianzhou city

482
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:42,440
will take advantage of the Cui family.

483
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,440
It's just that we want to take advantage of the Hanli

484
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:46,440
and make it convenient.

485
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,440
So our young master just said

486
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,440
we were going to take some gold

487
00:21:50,440 --> 00:21:52,440
and give you 50 taels of grain.

488
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,440
So you can help you

489
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,440
to take the silver and gold to Luoyang sooner.

490
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,440
With the imperial army's courage,

491
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,440
are you afraid that you can't defeat Luoyang?

492
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,440
You said it.

493
00:22:00,440 --> 00:22:03,440
It feels like we have cut a big piece of paper.

494
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:05,440
50 taels of grain.

495
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:07,440
50 taels of grain in the area

496
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,440
only costs us 20 taels of silver a day.

497
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,440
We can't force it to the end of the road.

498
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,440
Since the Jianzhou and Luoyang are so close,

499
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,440
Royal Descendant

500
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,440
can't tell the truth, right?

501
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:23,440
Yes.

502
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,440
Then would Royal Descendant

503
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:25,440
want to use Hanli

504
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,440
to exchange 50 taels of grain?

505
00:22:30,440 --> 00:22:31,440
Yes.

506
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:32,440
Shi Qi Lang.

507
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,440
Shi Qi Lang.

508
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:34,440
Okay.

509
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,440
Royal Descendant

510
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,440
is a promise to the emperor.

511
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,440
As long as you give Hanli to the Cui family,

512
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,440
our young master

513
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:41,440
will never make a promise.

514
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:44,440
The grain will be delivered secretly.

515
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,440
Shi Qi Lang.

516
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,440
Shi Qi Lang.

517
00:22:46,440 --> 00:22:48,440
There are too few 50 taels.

518
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,440
Okay.

519
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,440
Let me have a look.

520
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,440
Tell me.

521
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:56,440
What's the plan?

522
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
What's the plan?

523
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,440
Didn't you deliberately

524
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
agree to the He Xiao Wei

525
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,440
to exchange 50 taels of grain for Hanli?

526
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,440
Are you planning to take it for three seconds?

527
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:10,440
While the Cui family is not prepared,

528
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,440
take the grain and Hanli together.

529
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,440
Take the less and the less.

530
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:15,440
Take the less.

531
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:18,440
Take the less and the less.

532
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,440
Take the less.

533
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,440
Is there a way?

534
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,440
You should be the one

535
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:24,440
who is so aggressive.

536
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,440
You should have planned it.

537
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,440
Otherwise,

538
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,440
why are you so easy

539
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,440
to deal with He Xiao Wei?

540
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,440
Such a harsh condition.

541
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,440
I have a friend.

542
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:36,440
I have someone.

543
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,440
She is in love with a girl.

544
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:40,440
When the Cui family

545
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,440
calls Hanli out,

546
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:42,440
let Zuo Ying

547
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,440
take Hanli and Hu Fu

548
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:44,440
to the Sword City

549
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,440
immediately.

550
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,440
I should go there myself.

551
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,440
No need.

552
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Now, Hanli and Hu Fu

553
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:52,440
are bound to be in the Sword City.

554
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,440
Now, Luo Yang

555
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:55,440
is the most important one.

556
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:57,440
I guess Li Ni

557
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,440
will be in the front

558
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
when she gets the grain.

559
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,440
We must take her side.

560
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,440
Are you

561
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,440
the one in the Cui family

562
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,440
or the one in your family?

563
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,440
No.

564
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:13,440
Why are you so stubborn?

565
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:14,440
Tell me.

566
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:17,440
This girl

567
00:24:18,440 --> 00:24:19,440
shouldn't like her.

568
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,440
Shouldn't like her?

569
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,440
Is she

570
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,440
the one in the Cui family?

571
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,440
It's okay.

572
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,440
As long as she is kind,

573
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:33,440
it's okay.

574
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:34,440
No.

575
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:35,440
What is it? Tell me.

576
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,440
She looks like

577
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,440
someone else.

578
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:41,440
But she is

579
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,440
the one in the Cui family.

580
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
No.

581
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:49,440
I lost her.

582
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,440
I finally understand.

583
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:53,440
You are so abnormal today.

584
00:24:54,440 --> 00:24:55,440
It's because of this.

585
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,440
What's abnormal?

586
00:25:00,440 --> 00:25:01,440
How am I abnormal?

587
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,440
I mean that friend.

588
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:04,440
Fine.

589
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:05,440
Let's talk about

590
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,440
your friend today.

591
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,440
Now, in the south,

592
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,440
she still loves little things.

593
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,440
She told you

594
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,440
that she is so happy

595
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,440
that she will still be in trouble.

596
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:17,440
She is not.

597
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,440
Fine.

598
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,440
She knew that

599
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:20,440
she had a husband

600
00:25:20,440 --> 00:25:21,440
and she secretly married him.

601
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:23,440
Shiqing Lang, I tell you.

602
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,440
She is a marriage proposal.

603
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,440
Actually,

604
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,440
You don't need to say it.

605
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,440
Shiqing Lang,

606
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:29,440
I suggest you

607
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,440
break up with your friend

608
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,440
as soon as possible.

609
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:33,440
Otherwise, you won't be afraid of the dark.

610
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,440
One day, you will like

611
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:36,440
the other's ringtone, right?

612
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,440
Shiqing Lang,

613
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,440
you are so selfish.

614
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,440
Today, Li Huangsun

615
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,440
is so blind and blind.

616
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,440
She agreed to us so easily.

617
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,440
I don't know what happened.

618
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,440
Who knows?

619
00:26:00,440 --> 00:26:01,440
I will let Chen Xing

620
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:02,440
arrange the provisions.

621
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
Wait.

622
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:08,440
I thought of another plan.

623
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,440
If they

624
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:11,440
come to Luoyang first,

625
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,440
we will meet again.

626
00:26:23,440 --> 00:26:25,440
I helped you to make the palace.

627
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:28,440
I am your servant.

628
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,440
I am just a servant

629
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:31,440
who served you since childhood.

630
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:35,440
From the mansion to the palace,

631
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:37,440
for so many years,

632
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
I couldn't bear to

633
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:41,440
take care of you

634
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:44,440
in the future.

635
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,440
It's a good thing to repair it.

636
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,440
You can take care of it

637
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,440
for me.

638
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,440
I have a mother.

639
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,440
Don't worry.

640
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,440
You

641
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,440
take care of yourself

642
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:12,440
and take care of the Jiang family for me.

643
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:16,440
Go.

644
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,440
Yes.

645
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:25,440
Don't worry, Your Highness.

646
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,440
I am leaving.

647
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,440
I am leaving.

648
00:28:14,440 --> 00:28:15,440
Dugu,

649
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:16,440
it's all done.

650
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:17,440
Okay.

651
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,440
Go tell the madam

652
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:20,440
that I have already

653
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,440
removed the seal for her.

654
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,440
But what if

655
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,440
Consort Xiao knows it?

656
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:27,440
She is a smart person.

657
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,440
She must think

658
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,440
it's the palace maid

659
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:31,440
who sent the people to kill

660
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,440
the people

661
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,440
and sent them to serve the country.

662
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,440
But if Consort Xiao doesn't want to open it,

663
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:37,440
she won't be able to

664
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:38,440
make a fuss about it.

665
00:28:38,440 --> 00:28:39,440
Isn't that

666
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,440
a bad thing for the palace maid?

667
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,440
It's just a few servants.

668
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:45,440
She will kill them.

669
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,440
I have said it before.

670
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:50,440
She is a smart person.

671
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,440
She won't be in a hurry

672
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,440
because of their big problem.

673
00:28:58,440 --> 00:28:59,440
Don't hate me.

674
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:19,440
Royal Uncle, you came at night.

675
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Do you want in business?

676
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:28,620
If I love you a lot,

677
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,360
I will make you Roberta Shilong.

678
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,300
If you return it to me,

679
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:34,520
that will leave me no more chance.

680
00:29:38,220 --> 00:29:39,480
What are you doing here?

681
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:43,600
I am here today

682
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,740
just to give you a break.

683
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,480
What does this mean?

684
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:56,820
That means

685
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,960
I meant to pay you back.

686
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,920
I don't have a sidecar.

687
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,520
You're 是很好 cooled.

688
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,280
There's no better sidecar.

689
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,960
You'll have a big ס.

690
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:09,440
Why do you have a contagion

691
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:10,600
in your head?

692
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,280
You just cannot dance

693
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:13,760
this song in the mirror.

694
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,320
You can't compete

695
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,160
in Gand Promised.

696
00:30:19,160 --> 00:30:20,000
Accessory.

697
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,440
Expl Berkeley Village

698
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,240
Herity's idea

699
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:24,920
is highly environmentally 소�拨.

700
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,840
Because of them,

701
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,800
Director, it's not like that.

702
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,600
Am I...

703
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,720
Am I looking good in the moon?

704
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,400
Is it suitable for me to look at the tiger's clothing?

705
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,680
You guessed it wrong this time.

706
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,160
The tiger's clothing is not in my place.

707
00:30:39,160 --> 00:30:39,960
I know.

708
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:42,280
Since you know,

709
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,040
why are you here?

710
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,520
I...

711
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:49,880
Am I...

712
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:58,960

713
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,000

00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,520
ар

715
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:18,520
Oh, I'll sleep too.

716
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:20,520
Okay, you go now.

717
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:22,520
Then go to sleep early, Xiao Wei.

718
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,520
I know.

719
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:48,520
Why are you staring at me?

720
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:52,520
You look so hot.

721
00:31:52,520 --> 00:31:54,520
It's too hot here.

722
00:31:54,520 --> 00:31:57,520
The night is cold and the road is cold.

723
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,520
Royal Descendant actually feels too hot.

724
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:03,520
Why did you help me with this?

725
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:06,520
You broke into the female bedroom at night.

726
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:08,520
Royal Descendant doesn't mind the rain.

727
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,520
I'm still in danger.

728
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,520
Let me tell you something.

729
00:32:11,520 --> 00:32:13,520
You used 50 carcasses to replace the Sword State today.

730
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:16,520
I know you're hiding your hands in the Sword State.

731
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,520
My father was imprisoned in the capital.

732
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:21,520
I want to save my father with your help.

733
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:25,520
Royal Descendant is so unreasonable.

734
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:27,520
If I didn't agree to it,

735
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:29,520
if you didn't agree,

736
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:33,520
I would have...

737
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,520
Ying, did you sleep?

738
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,520
I just slept.

739
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,520
I just slept.

740
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,520
I have something to discuss with you.

741
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,520
Okay, I'm coming.

742
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,520
What's that?

743
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,520
Young Master.

744
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:26,520
Young Master, where did you get the military report?

745
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,520
Actually, there's nothing important.

746
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,520
I just heard from Taozi that you're not using the night shift.

747
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,520
So I came to see you.

748
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,520
But I saw you were angry.

749
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,520
You were quite nice.

750
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,520
It seems that I was too green.

751
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,520
But I had more snacks this afternoon.

752
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
I didn't have any appetite at night.

753
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,520
Then go to bed early.

754
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,520
You should rest early.

755
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,520
To是我,

756
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:14,920
Xiao Luo Qing,

757
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,520
How long has it been?

758
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,520
During 3 days.

759
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:24,520
Apologize to Je girl...

760
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:26,520
How long?

761
00:34:26,520 --> 00:34:29,520
Let's just say 5ожу period.

762
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,520
Wait.

763
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:35,520
I've already set up a aquarium on the back of the house.

764
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,520
Let's go.

765
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:38,520
I was forced to

766
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:43,120
fall into a place where I missed Yang Hui.

767
00:34:45,880 --> 00:34:46,560
Your Highness,

768
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,240
just cry out if you want to.

769
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,160
I won't.

770
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:55,800
I must be strong

771
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,400
to save the Crown Princess Consort.

772
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,560
I can't cry anymore.

773
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:03,320
But I hate myself.

774
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:04,880
Why can't I?

775
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:07,600
I didn't protect the Crown Prince's blood

776
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:09,320
in the family of the Jiang family.

777
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:17,560
If one day I come to the underground,

778
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,400
the Crown Prince won't forgive me.

779
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:27,640
Your Highness,

780
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,440
the Crown Prince is still alive.

781
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,760
If it wasn't for you,

782
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:32,480
he wouldn't be alive now.

783
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:34,840
He's still waiting for you, Your Highness.

784
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,400
If he's still alive,

785
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,040
he won't forgive me.

786
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,960
I know

787
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:44,840
that I have to stay alive

788
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,920
just for the power of Xuanyi's power.

789
00:35:49,640 --> 00:35:50,360
I know

790
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:52,960
that you did what you want to do.

791
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,000
She knows well

792
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,680
that she told me

793
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:58,720
that she哆oned Your Highness

794
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,200
and would not have been sweating it out.

795
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:01,600
But I...

796
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:03,620
If you say that,

797
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:04,700
I will die.

798
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,760
Yes!

799
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:09,440
My lady.

800
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,740
It is very easy for me

801
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:15,920
to lose my parents and grandPrincess

802
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:29,140
of

803
00:36:29,240 --> 00:36:32,420
using�

804
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:33,500
all my life.

805
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:35,300
I have to live on.

806
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:38,820
I have to

807
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,180
stay with Sun Jing.

808
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:46,660
Maybe I can find a chance to protect my grandchild.

809
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:52,220
I can also find a chance to build a new life.

810
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:56,180
I wish the Great Yu Dynasty a happy and prosperous life.

811
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:01,820
I understand your pain.

812
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:06,380
Why?

813
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:29,140
Do you think

814
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:31,140
Can I have a good sleep?

815
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:48,140
Your Highness.

816
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:51,140
Have some water.

817
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,140
General Han.

818
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,140
Didn't we discuss about

819
00:37:57,140 --> 00:38:05,700
the schedule of the

820
00:38:06,140 --> 00:38:07,140
General's office?

821
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,140
General, you called me Azeb.

822
00:38:11,140 --> 00:38:12,140
The title of the title is different.

823
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,140
No one should be in charge of this.

824
00:38:16,140 --> 00:38:17,140
Should be.

825
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,140
Are you hungry?

826
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:22,140
No.

827
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,140
General Han,

828
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
did Mother come to inform you?

829
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,140
The Crown Princess is very kind and kind.

830
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,140
She is like a burden.

831
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:34,140
If she didn't arrange it,

832
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:36,140
I and Grandson

833
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:38,140
can't escape the search of the capital.

834
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:40,140
Now that the road is long,

835
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:43,140
the Crown Princess's news is short.

836
00:38:43,140 --> 00:38:44,140
It's also a long story.

837
00:38:51,140 --> 00:38:54,140
I hope Mother can be safe and sound.

838
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:56,140
I hope Mother can be safe and sound.

839
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,140
Greetings, Royal Descendant.

840
00:39:19,140 --> 00:39:22,140
I wonder what you want to do.

841
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:24,140
I'm sorry to bother you

842
00:39:24,140 --> 00:39:25,140
in the city of Dingzhou.

843
00:39:25,140 --> 00:39:26,140
I'm not as good as you.

844
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,140
I've prepared a bowl of wine today.

845
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:30,140
Please have a drink.

846
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,140
I don't drink wine.

847
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,140
I have something to ask.

848
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,140
Please serve the noodles.

849
00:39:42,140 --> 00:39:43,140
I'm sorry.

850
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,140
Just say it if you need anything.

851
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,140
I don't know

852
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,140
what He Xiao Wei's identity is.

853
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:58,140
If there is any, please forgive me.

854
00:39:59,140 --> 00:40:00,140
What identity?

855
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,140
What's his identity?

856
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:05,140
Young Master.

857
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,140
Why do you ask me this?

858
00:40:08,140 --> 00:40:09,140
He is just my son.

859
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,140
He is just my son.

860
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,140
What's his identity?

861
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:19,140
You don't have to ask.

862
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,140
I know everything.

863
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:23,140
As long as you agree to help me,

864
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,140
I will keep this secret.

865
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,140
I won't let others know.

866
00:40:36,140 --> 00:40:37,140
Don't worry, Young Master.

867
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:39,140
I will keep my word.

868
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,140
As long as you agree,

869
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:43,140
I will keep this secret.

870
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:53,140
You want to kill me?

871
00:40:54,140 --> 00:40:55,140
Young Master.

872
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:57,140
Although you are a big family,

873
00:40:58,140 --> 00:41:00,140
we are also in the capital.

874
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,140
Young Master, can you do it?

875
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Can you do it?

876
00:41:06,140 --> 00:41:07,140
Royal Descendant is joking.

877
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,140
We are all in the same family.

878
00:41:10,140 --> 00:41:11,140
Royal Descendant, tell me.

879
00:41:12,140 --> 00:41:13,140
What do you need?

880
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,140
You need my help.

881
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:17,140
But it's okay.

882
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:20,140
My father's son, Liang Wang,

883
00:41:21,140 --> 00:41:22,140
was detained in the capital by Sun Jing.

884
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,140
I know your family

885
00:41:25,140 --> 00:41:26,140
is in charge of the capital.

886
00:41:27,140 --> 00:41:28,140
As long as you help me,

887
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:31,140
I will save the King of the Manor.

888
00:41:33,140 --> 00:41:34,140
Young Master.

889
00:41:37,140 --> 00:41:38,140
Young Master.

890
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,140
Young Master, I just asked you

891
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:44,140
if you came to the Royal Descendant.

892
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:46,140
You should go back and take the medicine.

893
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,140
I said it's time to eat.

894
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,140
Didn't you say you would make a red-nose feast today?

895
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:09,140
What?

896
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:10,140
You finished it so soon?

897
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:14,140
What do you think

898
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:16,140
this young master Cui is like?

899
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,140
He looks like a young master

900
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:23,140
but not like a man who can fight with soldiers.

901
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
Yes.

902
00:42:24,140 --> 00:42:26,140
He is a weak man.

903
00:42:26,140 --> 00:42:28,140
Since he can fight so many cities

904
00:42:28,140 --> 00:42:30,140
from Yingzhou to here,

905
00:42:30,140 --> 00:42:32,140
I don't know if it's weird.

906
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,140
Cui Yi's son

907
00:42:35,140 --> 00:42:36,140
should be good.

908
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:39,140
Cui Yi is the general of the imperial court.

909
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,140
He was the general of Sun Jing and Pei Da

910
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:43,140
and became the third sister of the imperial court.

911
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:46,140
What do you think

912
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:47,140
He Xiao Wei is like?

913
00:42:50,140 --> 00:42:51,140
Well,

914
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:53,140
I can't see through it.

915
00:42:56,140 --> 00:42:57,140
You know

916
00:42:57,140 --> 00:42:59,140
I have been fighting with the Moparguan for more than ten years.

917
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:01,140
I have never seen anyone like him.

918
00:43:01,140 --> 00:43:03,140
But I have never seen anyone like him.

919
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:05,140
You think he is a woman, right?

920
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:08,140
He is very ruthless and bold.

921
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,140
I am so silent.

922
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:14,140
So I always think

923
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:16,140
He Xiao Wei is not simple.

924
00:43:17,140 --> 00:43:19,140
He said every word

925
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:21,140
and I don't know how many things he said.

926
00:43:22,140 --> 00:43:23,140
By the way,

927
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,140
the general has prepared the opening.

928
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:29,140
The department of our Banzhou is also ready to open.

929
00:43:29,140 --> 00:43:30,140
When will it be launched?

930
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,140
As soon as possible.

931
00:43:33,140 --> 00:43:34,140
Xiao Wei,

932
00:43:34,140 --> 00:43:35,140
I feel that

933
00:43:35,140 --> 00:43:36,140
you are so hard to see.

934
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:38,140
It's okay.

935
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:39,140
You have told me

936
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:41,140
what you said to Li Ni.

937
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:43,140
Li Ni is a killer.

938
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,140
He is so cunning and wants to kill him.

939
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,140
He wants to cheat me.

940
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:51,140
He wants to cheat you

941
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:52,140
and save the king.

942
00:43:53,140 --> 00:43:54,140
I didn't get it.

943
00:43:54,140 --> 00:43:55,140
But Li Ni

944
00:43:56,140 --> 00:43:58,140
has started to get suspicious.

945
00:43:58,140 --> 00:44:00,140
Luckily, you have told me to open the door early

946
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:01,140
and take the ice off.

947
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,140
I will pack the things here.

948
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,140
Xiao Wei,

949
00:44:09,140 --> 00:44:11,140
did we take the car?

950
00:44:13,140 --> 00:44:14,140
Throw it away.

951
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,140
Really?

952
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,140
Throw it away.

953
00:44:56,140 --> 00:45:00,140
I am the half-dryer in your heart.

954
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:07,140
That car is my hard-working car.

955
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:14,140
I have missed you for a long time.

956
00:45:15,140 --> 00:45:21,140
I miss the taste of the taste.

957
00:45:21,140 --> 00:45:25,140
I miss the warmth of all the oil.

958
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:30,140
I miss the way you stay.

959
00:45:30,140 --> 00:45:33,140
If we love each other,

960
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,140
we will be strangers.

961
00:45:37,140 --> 00:45:39,140
I will live for you

962
00:45:39,140 --> 00:45:43,140
from now on.

963
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:48,140
I will stay in the heart.

964
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:56,140
Waiting for my promise.

965
00:45:57,140 --> 00:46:00,140
If I love you,

966
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:03,140
I will give you my promise.

967
00:46:04,140 --> 00:46:06,140
I will love you

968
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:10,140
with my love for you.

969
00:46:11,140 --> 00:46:15,140
I will live for you.

970
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:20,140
Waiting for your response.

971
00:46:20,140 --> 00:46:23,140
If we love each other,

972
00:46:23,140 --> 00:46:26,140
we will be strangers.

973
00:46:27,140 --> 00:46:33,140
I will live for you.

974
00:46:35,140 --> 00:46:44,140
I will wait for your response.

975
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:48,140
I will wait for your response.
