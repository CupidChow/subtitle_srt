1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:17,720
Welcome to the

2
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:23,180
How to

3
00:00:23,180 --> 00:00:25,060
Singing

4
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:28,680
Why are you here?

5
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,680
This sudden

6
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:34,680
Chase after waves

7
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,680
My night passes by

8
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:40,680
The night is full of walls

9
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:44,680
I want to go

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,680
The end of the dark

11
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,680
The earth is long

12
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:53,680
When the encounter is different

13
00:00:54,680 --> 00:00:56,680
When the encounter is distant

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,680
I will never forget

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:04,680
The light of the sword and the eagle

16
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:07,680
The sky that breaks through the window

17
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:10,680
The dream that is so small

18
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,680
The wind blows in the wind

19
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,680
See the sky full of red and green

20
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,680
The sky is cold

21
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:22,680
The dust will not be gone

22
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
Episode 1

23
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:55,680
Are you okay?

24
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,680
It's so great.

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,680
You're okay.

26
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,680
It's really great.

27
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,680
We all thought you were the crown prince.

28
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,680
Anyway, the wolf is almost sad.

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,680
I don't know what's going on.

30
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:24,680
When I wake up slowly

31
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,680
I feel like I've made a long dream.

32
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,680
I can hear the sound and the sound of the music.

33
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,680
But I can't move my body.

34
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:36,680
After a while,

35
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,680
my body can move a little bit.

36
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:41,680
Although I'm in a hurry,

37
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,680
I can only wait until the air is clear.

38
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,680
When my body can move completely,

39
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:49,680
I can only get up in a month

40
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,680
and fly out of the coffin.

41
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,680
Xiaoqian,

42
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I heard your description.

43
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,680
It's like I took the medicine

44
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:02,680
I practiced before I was pregnant.

45
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,680
So it is.

46
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,680
Taozi,

47
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:16,680
the medicine you practiced before

48
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,680
has changed your mind?

49
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,680
At that time,

50
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,680
he was still a prince.

51
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,680
So I gave him all the medicine left.

52
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:24,680
Prince.

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,680
I've been on the road for the most time.

54
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:35,680
After a few more days,

55
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,680
we arrived.

56
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:41,680
Not even the crown princess.

57
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,680
But I would know that you're dead.

58
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,680
But whether he knows

59
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,680
or not,

60
00:04:56,680 --> 00:04:57,680
when you die,

61
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:03,680
I will definitely regret it.

62
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Your Majesty,

63
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:25,680
through this life,

64
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
you should also feel that

65
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,680
the crown prince is very filial to you.

66
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,680
The crown prince and the crown princess are husband and wife.

67
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:38,680
Then the crown princess

68
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,680
must also be a good child.

69
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,680
I'm not sure

70
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:45,680
if I can be a good child.

71
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:47,680
But I'm sure

72
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,680
the crown prince

73
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:51,680
is also a filial child.

74
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:54,680
Yes.

75
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Thanks to the crown prince and the crown princess,

76
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,680
I have this son.

77
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,680
I'm so lucky.

78
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,680
Your Majesty,

79
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,680
I plan to

80
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,680
give the throne to the crown prince.

81
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,680
The crown prince is a capable man.

82
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,680
He will be a good emperor.

83
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:31,680
Your Majesty,

84
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
after the throne is done,

85
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,680
we will go to Lishan Palace

86
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
to celebrate the happy and happy days.

87
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:40,680
Okay?

88
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:41,680
Okay.

89
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,680
As long as you're happy,

90
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,680
I'm willing to accompany you

91
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,680
to Lishan.

92
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,680
It's good to go anywhere.

93
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,680
General.

94
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
General.

95
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:23,680
General.

96
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:26,680
I'm here to see you, father.

97
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Nian, come here.

98
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,680
Come here.

99
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,680
Come here.

100
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,680
Yes.

101
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:38,680
Come and try it.

102
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,680
Hurry up.

103
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
Hurry up.

104
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,680
This is...

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,680
This is not what you use.

106
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,680
Come on.

107
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,680
Turn it over.

108
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
See?

109
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:55,680
It will bite

110
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,680
if you use this trick.

111
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,680
So,

112
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
there are many tricks and tricks.

113
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,680
You will play with me.

114
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,680
But you can't do anything positive.

115
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,680
Sh...

116
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,680
You learned it so quickly?

117
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,680
Listen.

118
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,680
You can use me

119
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,680
as a good emperor.

120
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:33,680
This...

121
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,680
Bite him.

122
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,680
Bite him.

123
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Are you trying to fool me?

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,680
Why?

125
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,680
This is called skill.

126
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,680
Just like you fight,

127
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,680
you need to practice the military law.

128
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:49,680
Come on.

129
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,680
Come on.

130
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,680
Nian.

131
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Seeing you smile,

132
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,680
I'm really happy.

133
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,680
Hey, hit the ball.

134
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,680
Catch the ball.

135
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
Up and down.

136
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,680
Bite him.

137
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,220
Bite him.

138
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:26,680
Bite you.

139
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,680
Bite his tail.

140
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:28,680
Bite his tail.

141
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,680
To bite.

142
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,680
Bite him.

143
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:34,680
Hit him.

144
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:35,680
Hit the girl.

145
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,680
Bite.

146
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:37,680
Bite.

147
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
I remember when you were two years old,

148
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,680
I took you and your two brothers

149
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,680
to the palace together to meet the late emperor.

150
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,680
The stage is too high here.

151
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:59,680
You were short and short.

152
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,680
Why couldn't you climb up?

153
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,680
I want to hug you.

154
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,680
But you were so short.

155
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,680
I remember I wanted to hit you hard.

156
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,680
I don't remember.

157
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:23,680
I only remember that you never hugged me since I was a kid.

158
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:33,680
At that time, I felt that your temperament was weird.

159
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,680
I always thought you didn't like me.

160
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,680
But now it seems that you don't like me.

161
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:52,680
This land, this world,

162
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,680
I will give it to you.

163
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:07,680
Father is not a good emperor.

164
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,680
Actually,

165
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:12,680
he is not a good father.

166
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,680
But at least I have a good son.

167
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,680
And I believe that in the future,

168
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,680
you will be a good emperor.

169
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
Don't worry, father.

170
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:39,680
I will try to be a good emperor.

171
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:48,680
Son, I want to remind you.

172
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,680
It's the same as the old capital.

173
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,680
I asked if you can be a good person in the future.

174
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:56,680
Don't be so serious.

175
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:58,680
I hope you can be a good emperor

176
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:02,680
and be happy every day.

177
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,680
If I don't want to be a good emperor,

178
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:15,680
it's okay if you are happy.

179
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,680
But I believe that you will find a reliable person

180
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,680
to be a good emperor.

181
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,680
Yes, I will find a reliable person

182
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,680
and entrust the world to him.

183
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,680
Just like today's father entrusted the world to me.

184
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,680
Look at you.

185
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,680
You are so wild again.

186
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,680
I said son, you just laugh.

187
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:43,680
Think about it.

188
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,680
You will be a emperor soon.

189
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,680
You have to face the courtiers every day

190
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,680
and pretend to be a mother.

191
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,680
You are not a emperor yet.

192
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,680
Hurry up and have fun.

193
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,680
Have fun.

194
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,680
It's so nice to laugh.

195
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,680
In the future,

196
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,680
if you are tired,

197
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
you will come to Lishan to find your father.

198
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
No, I mean the emperor.

199
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,680
I will help you solve the problem with you.

200
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,680
I will quit.

201
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:52,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

202
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:54,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

203
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

204
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:58,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

205
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:00,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

206
00:14:00,680 --> 00:14:02,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

207
00:14:02,680 --> 00:14:04,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

208
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

209
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:08,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

210
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,680

00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

213
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:16,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

214
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

215
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

216
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,680
I will go to Lishan to find my father.

217
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:41,680
In the second year of the heaven,

218
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,680
For His Highness the Emperor has changed his mind

219
00:14:44,680 --> 00:14:46,680
for the state.

220
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:58,280

are equal to the elder.

222
00:15:07,380 --> 00:15:08,620
At that time,

223
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,680

What are you doing?

235
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,560
Nothing.

236
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:19,120
You're drawing again?

237
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,520
Let me see

238
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,880
if you drew

239
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
the famous dance.

240
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,320
Look.

241
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,400
Did you draw

242
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:31,920
the same as the sky and the sky?

243
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,200
Give me the pen.

244
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:37,480
What do you want to do?

245
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:39,640
That day,

246
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,440
a person's pants were drawn in a big way.

247
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,520
I'm drawing you

248
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
with two more eyes.

249
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,840
That's not good.

250
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,320
If my daughter sees this in the future,

251
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,320
I'll ask her to see me.

252
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,080
I can't.

253
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,040
How about this?

254
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,840
Let's bet.

255
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,360
If you win,

256
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:58,840
I won't draw your eyes.

257
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,440
But if you lose,

258
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,800
you have to promise me

259
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,920
to draw you

260
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,200
with two more eyes.

261
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,240
Okay.

262
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:06,960
How do you want to bet?

263
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,200
Close your eyes.

264
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,400
Listen to me.

265
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,840
If you open your eyes after listening to me,

266
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:18,160
you'll lose.

267
00:17:19,320 --> 00:17:20,520
If you don't open your eyes

268
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,800
after listening to me,

269
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
I'll lose.

270
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,360
You're so mean.

271
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,280
No matter what happens,

272
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,520
I won't open my eyes.

273
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:31,640
Even if you kiss me,

274
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,120
I won't open my eyes.

275
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:34,480
Please.

276
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,360
You lost?

277
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,200
Yes.

278
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,680
I have a baby.

279
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:56,720
Really?

280
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Of course.

281
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,280
I want to be a father.

282
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,640
Have a letzten mind.

283
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,120
I'll be a loving butt.

284
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:25,640
Do you think

285
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:27,800
she is a boy or a girl?

286
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,400
You think so?

287
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:34,520
I like girls.

288
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,840
I've loved girls since I was a kid.

289
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,840
I'll let Huang Wei choose first.

290
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:41,840
Then I'll take my daughter

291
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:43,840
to the old manor to the wild.

292
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,840
If it's my son,

293
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,840
I might have to wait for two more years.

294
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:49,840
Why?

295
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:51,840
Why?

296
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:52,840
Think about it.

297
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,840
If I were a son,

298
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,840
I'd have to explain to the ministers.

299
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:00,840
Explain why I have a son,

300
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:01,840
but I have to choose first.

301
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,840
Then I'll meet some uneducated ministers.

302
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:07,840
You come to me to argue with me.

303
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,840
I'll take about two years to spend.

304
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:15,840
Shen Qi Lang.

305
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,840
You really

306
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,840
have planned everything.

307
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,840
Of course.

308
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,840
When we get married,

309
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:25,840
we'll live happily ever after.

310
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,840
Okay?

311
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
Let's go.

312
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:33,840
Let's go.

313
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,840
Is it good?

314
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:49,840
Yes.

315
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:52,840
Er Dong.

316
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:56,840
We're about to open a business.

317
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:59,840
It'll be great if we can be as good as them.

318
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,840
Business will be great if you have the knowledge.

319
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,840
We'll open many, many houses.

320
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:05,840
That's right.

321
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:08,840
I'm the crown prince.

322
00:20:08,840 --> 00:20:10,840
I'm the crown prince.

323
00:20:10,840 --> 00:20:12,840
I'm the crown prince.

324
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,840
I'm the crown prince.

325
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:15,840
I'm the crown prince.

326
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,840
I'm the crown prince.

327
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm the crown prince.

328
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,840
I'm the crown prince.

329
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:22,840
Yi Bai.

330
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:23,840
Er Dong.

331
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,840
Get off.

332
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:25,840
Get off.

333
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,840
She is the queen.

334
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,840
She is the queen.

335
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:29,840
I'm the crown prince.

336
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,840
I'm the crown prince.

337
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:33,840
I'm the crown prince.

338
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,840
I'm the crown prince.

339
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:36,840
I'm the crown lord.

340
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:51,840
I'm the crown prince.

341
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I'm the crown prince.

342
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,320
I'm your son!

343
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm your son!

344
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,640
I'm your son!

345
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:01,240
I'm your son!

346
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:02,760
I'm your son!

347
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:10,200
Since I went back to the Water River

348
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:11,640
to worship the Lord of Zhenxi,

349
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,080
I've tied myself up with my son.

350
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,040
I've been to the Western Changqing.

351
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,400
I'm willing to be a son

352
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,840
and support my father.

353
00:21:20,520 --> 00:21:21,200
Alright.

354
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,480
In the next ten years,

355
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,920
I'll be the son of Yan'nan.

356
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:31,600
Erduo.

357
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:38,920
Chang'er.

358
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,000
Your Majesty, what's the matter?

359
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:43,840
Why are you so upset?

360
00:21:46,280 --> 00:21:47,800
I was just thinking

361
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,080
how you were going to let the Empress marry you.

362
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:54,400
Well...

363
00:21:56,600 --> 00:21:57,440
Well...

364
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:01,520
That's not a good thing to say.

365
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:04,240
Anyway,

366
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:07,840
I've been talking to her for a long time.

367
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,080
I used my sincerity to make her move.

368
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,520
That's why she agreed to marry me.

369
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,400
Then I'll go talk to Taozi.

370
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,040
I can't help you.

371
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,040
I've said what I should say.

372
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,840
You know what sincerity means.

373
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:25,920
Sincerely.

374
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:31,800
I'm coming.

375
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:34,600
Be careful.

376
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,720
You're fine.

377
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,400
How is it?

378
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,880
Is the Empress's appetite better?

379
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,400
She's been better these days.

380
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:42,760
That's good.

381
00:22:50,920 --> 00:22:51,680
What's wrong?

382
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:54,600
It's nothing.

383
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,280
Taozi.

384
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:58,560
I have something to tell you.

385
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:00,560
Go ahead.

386
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:04,840
I asked the Empress

387
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,040
how she married the Empress.

388
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,760
She told me that she had enough sincerity.

389
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,880
But I'm not as smart as her.

390
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,360
I'm not as capable as her.

391
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
I've been thinking about it all the time.

392
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,280
I just want to tell you...

393
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,160
Taozi.

394
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:18,640
Marry me.

395
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I'll be nice to you.

396
00:23:24,280 --> 00:23:25,880
I know there's no sincerity.

397
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:30,440
But do you know that?

398
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:32,960
When you were seriously injured

399
00:23:33,560 --> 00:23:34,680
and died in the first line,

400
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,600
I was so scared.

401
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,640
I was scared that I wouldn't come back.

402
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:40,280
What should I do?

403
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,280
I was heartbroken at that time.

404
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,920
I was like a knife.

405
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:49,280
Then your injury was cured.

406
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,800
I put my heart in it.

407
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,920
So I was thinking

408
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,240
that in the future,

409
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,480
I can be by your side

410
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,480
and be with you.

411
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,080
Protect you.

412
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:05,280
Take care of you.

413
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,400
I hope that every day in the future,

414
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:10,040
we can be safe

415
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:11,840
and happy.

416
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,280
So I want to tell you that

417
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:20,720
Taozi.

418
00:24:22,440 --> 00:24:23,160
Marry me.

419
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:25,680
I'll be nice to you.

420
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:39,080
Good.

421
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:43,760
You mean it?

422
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:45,880
Yes.

423
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:47,880
You just said so much.

424
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,560
You said you had sincerity.

425
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,000
I'll admit it again.

426
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:54,080
Zhen irregular.

427
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,160
You added water right away.

428
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,320
It's soizations.

429
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:00,800
Frank,

430
00:25:01,800 --> 00:25:06,480
if you said something like that Bab медadd

431
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,280
don't you close your mouth again.

432
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:09,440
You can't even be watching.

433
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,320
You mean it?

434
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,120
That's not what I mean.

435
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,160
I am so happy.

436
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,720
I am just so happy.

437
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:28,840
Bao...

438
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:36,640
Bao Bai

439
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,560
It's okay, I'm here

440
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,680
I'll be fine

441
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:51,280
I'd like to ask you

442
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,120
Go.

443
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,400
How is it?

444
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:35,640
Did it fall?

445
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,040
Didn't you see it?

446
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:38,760
It didn't fall at all.

447
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:41,840
You said you wanted to fish.

448
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,600
We can fish in the Taiye pool.

449
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:44,960
We need to be careful

450
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,280
and run to the amusement park.

451
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,560
You don't understand.

452
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:48,760
The queen said

453
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,000
that the water quality of the Taiye pool

454
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:52,600
is different from the water quality of the lake.

455
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,840
It also has the smell of earthworms

456
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:54,920
from the fish that fell.

457
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,080
So we need to get rid of it here.

458
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:00,400
How about this?

459
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,480
I'll find a few people

460
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,080
and get you a net to catch fish.

461
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:04,600
When will you catch it?

462
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:05,240
No way.

463
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,200
The fish that fell from the net

464
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:06,920
and the fish that fell from the net

465
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:07,720
have different taste.

466
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:08,920
Can Aying get it out?

467
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:09,920
The fish that fell from the net

468
00:27:10,040 --> 00:27:11,080
and Aying get a bite of earthworms.

469
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:15,960
I didn't expect that there are so many robbers.

470
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:19,200
There they are.

471
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:19,680
Come on.

472
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:20,440
Hurry up.

473
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:21,120
Come on.

474
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,080
Yoshida, how can I help you?

475
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,160
Is your fish

476
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:36,280
also the fish that fell from the net?

477
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:43,920
Come, give me a light.

478
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:51,680
I'm not sure.

479
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,320
Aying,

480
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:56,560
our child

481
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,160
should be called Dao

482
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,120
or Zhen.

483
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Do you really want

484
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,240
to give the child a name?

485
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:04,560
Of course.

486
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,880
We agreed before.

487
00:28:05,880 --> 00:28:06,720
It's a good change.

488
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:08,840
That's fine.

489
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:10,840
If you have a boy,

490
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:11,880
it's called Dao.

491
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,440
If you have a girl,

492
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,880
it's Zhen.

493
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,280
No.

494
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:22,320
No.

495
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,800
Why not?

496
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,920
If it's my son,

497
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,120
it's fine.

498
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,080
The name is a bit rough.

499
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:32,640
If it's my daughter,

500
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,160
Aying,

501
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,760
will Zhen be in the audience?

502
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:39,160
Her name should be more polite.

503
00:28:39,280 --> 00:28:40,360
Otherwise, she'll blame me

504
00:28:40,360 --> 00:28:41,640
for her growing up.

505
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,320
You said it.

506
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,400
You can't change it.

507
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:45,600
It's a long story.

508
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,600
Your Majesty

509
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:49,240
is a good person.

510
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,400
You can't change it.

511
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,560
No, Aying.

512
00:28:51,800 --> 00:28:52,640
It's a bad story.

513
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,040
I'll think of another one.

514
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:54,760
I'll think about it.

515
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:55,720
Why not?

516
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:56,920
You didn't say

517
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:58,000
the name of the child.

518
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,000
I can't.

519
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,760
You said no.

520
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:01,960
I'll give you another one.

521
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:03,360
Another one.

522
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:04,480
Here.

523
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,240
What else did you say?

524
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:11,160
You eat first.

525
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:12,000
I'll read it to you.

526
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,000
General Cui

527
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,040
taught me to use the secret weapon to poison Zhen.

528
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:19,480
He also made a needle

529
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,960
and gave me a pair of shoes.

530
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,480
He helped General Han

531
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,600
to consider my martial arts skills.

532
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,400
I was a little bit weak.

533
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:26,880
I can't beat him now.

534
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,920
But when he was not used to poison Zhen,

535
00:29:30,920 --> 00:29:32,160
he was poisoned.

536
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,200
General Cui

537
00:29:35,200 --> 00:29:37,040
praised me for being good at acting.

538
00:29:37,040 --> 00:29:38,240
It's over.

539
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:41,800
How big is the choice?

540
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,360
You'll get it in the future.

541
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,320
What's the point of laughing at me?

542
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:46,320
Is it bad?

543
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,840
It's not bad.

544
00:29:48,520 --> 00:29:50,840
My aunt is the only one

545
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,240
who is not a good person.

546
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,240
I don't like people like you.

547
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,400
What if I'm like a girl

548
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:58,720
and I'm like me?

549
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,040
Of course you can.

550
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,840
I can be like you, too.

551
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,280
Because you're our child.

552
00:30:03,800 --> 00:30:05,880
You're so sweet and charming.

553
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,840
If I'm like you,

554
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:08,840
it's bad.

555
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,280
I'll be in trouble.

556
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,840
So you're saying

557
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:15,080
you're not like me.

558
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:19,560
Ying.

559
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:21,920
Ying.

560
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:23,040
It's a miracle.

561
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:26,520
My stomach hurts.

562
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:28,400
Guards.

563
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,400
Guards!

564
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:35,280
Your Majesty.

565
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,880
You'd better rest.

566
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:38,480
I'm not in a mood.

567
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:40,160
It's been a day.

568
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,600
How do I feel that

569
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
Ying's voice is getting weaker?

570
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,160
Will something happen to her?

571
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,640
No.

572
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,760
Her life is always at this point.

573
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:52,680
Taozi said

574
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:53,840
everything went smoothly.

575
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:55,400
Don't worry too much.

576
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,000
If it goes smoothly,

577
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,480
shouldn't it be born?

578
00:30:59,840 --> 00:31:00,520
Your Majesty.

579
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,840
The Empress will be fine

580
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,040
in the world.

581
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:08,600
I only need her safety.

582
00:31:09,960 --> 00:31:11,200
I only need her safety.

583
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,120
Your Majesty!

584
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:19,760
Your Majesty!

585
00:31:32,400 --> 00:31:33,280
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

586
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,040
Your tonight

587
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,440
gave birth to a prince.

588
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:36,480
Where's the Empress?

589
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:38,080
Her Highnessuela's health is fine.

590
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,200
Congratulations, Your Highness!

591
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,480
Your Majesty.

592
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:53,480
Won't it be better?

593
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,400
What are you trying to tell me?

594
00:31:56,440 --> 00:31:57,440
Just tell me it's fine.

595
00:31:58,280 --> 00:31:59,680
You've said that.

596
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:02,360
Draw a piece of paper on it and

597
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,960
we'll get lost.

598
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Thanks for your help.

599
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,760
It's time for the edict now.

600
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,640
Is it really the edict?

601
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,240
At Jiang joints, place the horse over the woods.

602
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:55,180
It's on the origin.

603
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,120
It must be

604
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,960
at the position of Gents.

605
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:06,800
Above the mountains,

606
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:09,600
you enter the labor Terrestrial Ocean.

607
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:10,840
At home,

608
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,800
the land generations of the silhouette

609
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,400
of the ecological environment

610
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,400
may disappear.

611
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,680
the land of the Song Dynasty,

612
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,400
and the Central Plains of the Bianjiang District.

613
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:23,520
I'm back.

614
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:24,280
Dad.

615
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,720
Dad is back.

616
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:26,680
Come.

617
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:27,720
Dad is back.

618
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:28,560
Dad is back.

619
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,880
Dad is back.

620
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,680
Dad has a yellow lamb today.

621
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:32,920
How about we grill the lamb?

622
00:33:32,920 --> 00:33:33,720
It's great.

623
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,840
It's great.

624
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:35,960
Grill the lamb.

625
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:36,400
Go.

626
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,520
We have grilled lamb.

627
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,600
We have grilled lamb.

628
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,480
Mom, we have grilled lamb.

629
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:41,840
We have grilled lamb.

630
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:42,800
Are you happy?

631
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,040
Yes.

632
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:44,840
Do you like it?

633
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:46,120
I like it.

634
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,440
I like it.

635
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:50,400
I like it.

636
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,680
I like it.

637
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,480
I like it.

638
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:15,720
Put it there.

639
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,960
Put it there.

640
00:34:28,640 --> 00:34:29,480
Here.

641
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,240
What's the matter?

642
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,240
The new emperor is young.

643
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:44,520
There's freedom now.

644
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,520
Now that the people are at peace,

645
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:48,520
we can have a good time in the border.

646
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:50,520
This is great.

647
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:08,520
Uncle Wei,

648
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:11,520
A Zhen and A Dou came to see you.

649
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,520
They invited you to have a drink.

650
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,520
Don't be polite.

651
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,520
There are still some.

652
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:21,520
I have a big bowl of cucumber.

653
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,520
Dad,

654
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,520
you said last time

655
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,520
the cucumber that Uncle Wei had in the past

656
00:35:34,520 --> 00:35:36,520
was the best in the world.

657
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:39,520
Is there really someone who is better than you?

658
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:43,520
Of course.

659
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,520
Dad's cucumber is one of Uncle Wei's best.

660
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,520
It's a pity that you can't eat it.

661
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,520
Is Dad's cucumber good?

662
00:35:52,520 --> 00:35:53,520
Yes.

663
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:16,520
Uncle Wei,

664
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:18,520
I'm sorry.

665
00:36:18,520 --> 00:36:20,520
I'm sorry.

666
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:22,520
I'm sorry.

667
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:24,520
I'm sorry.

668
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:26,520
I'm sorry.

669
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:28,520
I'm sorry.

670
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,520
I'm sorry.

671
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:32,520
I'm sorry.

672
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,520
I'm sorry.

673
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,520
I'm sorry.

674
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,520
I'm sorry.

675
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:40,520
I'm sorry.

676
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:42,520
I'm sorry.

677
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:44,520
Dad,

678
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,520
you are a good boy.

679
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:49,520
You are the most talented.

680
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,520
You are the best.

681
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,520
You are the best.

682
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:54,520
You are the best.

683
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:56,520
Dad,

684
00:36:56,520 --> 00:36:58,520
I'm sorry.

685
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,520
I'm sorry.

686
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:02,520
I'm sorry.

687
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,520
I'm sorry.

688
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,520
Dad,

689
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,520
I'm sorry.

690
00:37:07,520 --> 00:37:09,520
I'm sorry.

691
00:37:09,520 --> 00:37:11,000
It's fake.

692
00:37:11,000 --> 00:37:12,600
Dad won't cry.

693
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,320
I've never seen him cry.

694
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,200
Zhen, Dao.

695
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,800
What did you hide?

696
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:25,080
Who took it?

697
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,320
It's not my sister's.

698
00:37:27,320 --> 00:37:30,120
I took it from the box.

699
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:32,320
Did you really take it?

700
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:38,240
I took it.

701
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,360
Don't blame me, mom.

702
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:42,360
I saw the flower pattern on the flower.

703
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:43,760
It's so beautiful.

704
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:47,120
I couldn't help but to take it out and watch it with you.

705
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,600
How do you know that

706
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:50,320
your dad and mom are the ones who drew it?

707
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,160
Mom told me that

708
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,480
you lost the first time you fought with him.

709
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:59,040
I lied to you.

710
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:00,400
Your mom lied to you.

711
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:01,640
Your dad won't lose.

712
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:03,400
Your dad let your mom do it.

713
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:04,440
I know.

714
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,880
He's like my brother.

715
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:09,760
I know.

716
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,280
It's like you're my brother.

717
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,480
But in the future,

718
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,160
someone else will do it.

719
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:25,800
Mom, where is this?

720
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,480
It's so beautiful.

721
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:30,120
This place is called Le Youyuan.

722
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:32,280
It's a beautiful place.

723
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,160
When you grow up,

724
00:38:34,160 --> 00:38:36,760
dad and mom will take you to play here.

725
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:37,360
Okay?

726
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:37,880
Okay.

727
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,040
Okay.

728
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,240
In this flower pattern,

729
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:43,360
your dad and mom drew it.

730
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,520
But,

731
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,000
Zhen and Dao

732
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,200
will meet someone interesting in the future.

733
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,400
What's interesting is

734
00:38:51,400 --> 00:38:53,040
your story.

735
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,880
You need to use your life's happiness

736
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:57,240
to draw the flower pattern.

737
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:58,600
I'll try my best

738
00:38:58,600 --> 00:39:00,520
to get more wonderful flowers

739
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:03,000
than dad and mom.

740
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,920
Do you want to say that?

741
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,400
I'll be more wonderful than my brother.

742
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,680
I'll be more wonderful than you.

743
00:39:06,720 --> 00:39:08,200
I!

744
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:09,520
Slow down.

745
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,360
Be careful not to spill it.

746
00:39:11,720 --> 00:39:13,120
Only waves.

747
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:14,520
I...

748
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,720
When your rose oomps my eyes

749
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,220
Make face with the sun

750
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:22,080
LikeOpK

751
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,620
When the light shines

752
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,160
What a dream that can universe

753
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:33,080
break like the wind

754
00:39:33,080 --> 00:39:37,080
The wind blows in the wind, the wind blows in the wind

755
00:39:37,080 --> 00:39:42,080
Seeing the sky and the sky are scattered

756
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:45,080
The wind blows in the wind, the wind blows in the wind

757
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,080
The cold snow is cold, the cold wind blows in the wind

758
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,080
I'm willing to sing for you

759
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:54,080
I won't let the spring shine

760
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,080
Ying

761
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:58,080
I hope that everyone in the world

762
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:01,080
can find their own source of happiness

763
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,080
I will come

764
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,080
I miss the fire

765
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:39,080
When the memory is broken

766
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,080
If the half of what you have in your heart

767
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:54,080
That car is my car

768
00:40:55,080 --> 00:41:00,080
If the memory is not lost

769
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:07,080
I miss the taste of the most delicious food

770
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:12,080
The warmth of all the fruits

771
00:41:12,080 --> 00:41:17,080
I want to keep it for you

772
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:20,080
If we love each other

773
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:23,080
We have been through a lot

774
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,080
I will live for you

775
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:30,080
I want to live for you

776
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:34,080
The warmth of my eyes

777
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:42,080
Waiting for my promise

778
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:46,080
If we love each other

779
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:50,080
We have been through a lot

780
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:53,080
I will love you

781
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:57,080
I will love you

782
00:41:58,080 --> 00:42:02,080
I will live for you

783
00:42:02,080 --> 00:42:07,080
I will wait for your response

784
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:10,080
If we love each other

785
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:13,080
We have been through a lot

786
00:42:13,080 --> 00:42:17,080
I will love you

787
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,080
I will love you

788
00:42:21,080 --> 00:42:25,080
I'm willing to sing for you

789
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:32,080
I will wait for your response
