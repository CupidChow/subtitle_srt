00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,560
The dream that I have been through

4
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,040
The wind that is broken, the wind that is broken

5
00:01:07,440 --> 00:01:12,280
Look at the sky, the wind that is broken, the sky that is broken

6
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,880
The wind that is broken, the wind that is broken, the wind that is broken

Episode 13

10
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,720
I'll go.

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,920
Father, don't worry.

12
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,960
I've prepared a code.

13
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,000
If the war is not over,

14
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,240
I'll escort you to the south side.

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,160
If we enter the south side,

16
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,320
and there's a long river,

17
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,000
it'll be safe and sound.

18
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:06,800
Father,

19
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,920
if the war is not over,

20
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,040
I'll stay here

21
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,000
and lead the army to the south side.

22
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,080
Please

23
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
take my first step.

24
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,280
Second Brother, you...

25
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,520
You're really a loyal family.

26
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:21,640
You're the eldest son of my father.

27
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:22,600
In the future,

28
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:23,880
the world's grand master and father

29
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:26,040
will be the eldest brother.

30
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,040
If I can stay and fight against the enemy,

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,600
and get my father and eldest brother to die,

32
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
it's worth it.

33
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,640
Lei Er is such a filial son.

34
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,200
Second Brother.

35
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,240
Second Brother, you...

36
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
You can't.

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:44,440
Your Majesty.

38
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:45,160
Your Majesty.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,360
Your Majesty.

40
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,720
Your Majesty.

41
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,760
I've got news.

42
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:49,480
Tell me.

43
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,480
Prince Qin broke the Western Cuisine.

44
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,440
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,680
The Qin Dynasty's great evil son

46
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,880
has already led the army to the Western Cuisine.

47
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,600
What?

48
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,640
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

49
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,120
Father, you're the best in the world.

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,840
Only the Qin Dynasty can take the Western Cuisine.

51
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:06,720
Congratulations, Father.

52
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,760
Father, you're important to the Qin Dynasty.

53
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,200
Only the Qin Dynasty can take the Western Cuisine.

54
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,840
This is the best in the world.

55
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:12,480
Good.

56
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,520
Very good.

57
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,800
You're right, Grand Master Wu.

58
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:20,480
I'm the best in the world.

59
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:23,560
Only I can get the throne

60
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:27,040
and save the rest of the world.

61
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,560
Congratulations, Your Majesty.

62
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,600
My other father

63
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,800
joined the Hellbound 42 microfibre test.

64
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,680
It wasn't just me any task,

65
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,320
you even let me get punished

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,000
for getting courage.

67
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,080
My father had been this soaring

68
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:37,620
for six hundred years.

69
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,760
His time jumped

70
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,520
to the limit

71
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,920
I'm excited.

72
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:44,960
I don't want this information.

73
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,720
But someone has told me

74
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,980
to observe my 하지-out properly

75
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,960
so I won't tell ''ди Tang 키'' named '' Li '' from this land.

76
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,760
His Highness's Ahh Üst описании

77
00:04:57,380 --> 00:04:59,460
can send His Majesty of Heaven to your elders.

78
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:10,080
How's the person who is tracking my thunderbre強?

79
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:11,460
Great.

80
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,240
After several short-distance encounters,

81
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,200
we still couldn't stop them.

82
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:17,480
The family of Sun Jing's father-in-law is dead.

83
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:20,880
It seems that Sun Jing is still in a coma.

84
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,600
They have already pushed the battle to the same level.

85
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,360
General Cui.

86
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:29,160
After this break, General Cui was sent to the palace.

87
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:32,160
He was sent to Yunxiao Tower in front of the power plant.

88
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,080
He said that the Yixing Mountains are not like that.

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,160
He was sent to the palace and went out to the city to urge the army.

90
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,960
Not like that.

91
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,880
I also want to be like him and break into the sand.

92
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,080
In the end, I will just be like him and go back to the palace.

93
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:56,120
This is the real great power.

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,840
Your Highness.

95
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,560
You don't understand me.

96
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,280
But I am very envious of him.

97
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,240
Your Highness, you have been in the prison for a long time.

98
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,480
You have led the army to balance the world.

99
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:11,840
Now you have conquered the Western capital.

100
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,600
So from now on, you can't be the same as the people of the world.

101
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
You can't say that you are like others.

102
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Yes.

103
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,240
I have no choice.

104
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,600
Where is Ying?

105
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:31,120
She and General Cui went out to the city together.

106
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
Wow.

107
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:40,520
So this is the palace.

108
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,440
Xiao Wei, this place seems to be a little higher than the building.

109
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:47,880
The house is a little bigger. There is nothing different.

110
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,880
Look, the place we are staying now is called the Imperial Household House.

111
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:55,600
There is a power plant in front of it.

112
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,120
A front power plant. A scenic power plant.

113
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
Those are all the places where the Emperor of the Front was.

114
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,120
The one behind the wall is the Eastern Palace.

115
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:08,000
It is the harem with the Imperial Household House.

116
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,640
The one behind it is the harem.

117
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,480
Such a big house. How many people can live there?

118
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,480
The Emperor has ten sons.

119
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:21,040
He has a grandson and a lot of people.

120
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:22,080
He can't live in the palace.

121
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,920
He can wait until these pigs are married and then

122
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,280
they can live outside the palace.

123
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,640
It's a pity that Sun Jing is planning to rebel.

124
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,040
He has brought this position to the capital.

125
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,120
The King of Qin is here.

126
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:49,440
Ying, I want to ask you for a favor.

127
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,440
What is it?

128
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,640
The late Crown Prince has disappeared.

129
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,640
He is in the mansion to poison Sun Jing.

130
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,960
He is also poisoned.

131
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,840
Now that he is dead,

132
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,880
I want to ask Tao Zi to cure him.

133
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,280
He is a man and a woman. Please treat him as a guest.

134
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:11,480
So he poisoned Sun Jing.

135
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:20,480
Don't worry. I will not let you off.

136
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,960
It's just a mouthful.

137
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,760
Your Highness said that if he was poisoned in the secret room,

138
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:36,880
he would only be able to drink Sun Jing tea.

139
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,520
That's why he was poisoned in the mouthful.

140
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:43,880
Your Highness also said that the poison has a sweet scent.

141
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,680
Only the scent of the mouthful can change his taste.

142
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,680
And there is only one chance.

143
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:52,400
When he finally reaches the palace,

144
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,480
he will immediately pour the poison on his own lips.

145
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:57,440
The poison is completely not economics.

146
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,280
Then it would investors to poison his heart.

147
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,160
Your Highness,

148
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:06,480
the capture has lost all Imagination.

149
00:09:55,480 --> 00:09:57,480
I bow to you, father.

150
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:01,480
Thank you, father.

151
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,480
Prince Qin sent troops to the capital to welcome him.

152
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
As a prince,

153
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:11,480
I will pay a great price

154
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,480
to welcome the court of the officials in the Western capital.

155
00:10:17,480 --> 00:10:18,480
Father,

156
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,480
I have a few words.

157
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
I don't know what to say.

158
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,480
What do you mean?

159
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,480
Now Prince Qin has taken over the Western capital

160
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,480
and has made a huge contribution.

161
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,480
How are you going to reward Prince Qin?

162
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,480
He is my son.

163
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,480
Moreover,

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,480
Wei Jun and Fu Fengyu are his own.

165
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
What else can we reward him?

166
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:48,480
Father has already conferred the third emperor as Prince Qin.

167
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,480
Among the most important prince,

168
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:52,480
the title of Prince Qin is the most precious.

169
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
If he is to be conferred again,

170
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,480
he will only confer the third emperor as the crown prince.

171
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:02,480
You said to confer him as the crown prince?

172
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,480
He is the best of the best.

173
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:06,480
Why can't you confer him as the crown prince?

174
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,480
Tell me.

175
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,480
Why do you want to confer him as the crown prince?

176
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,480
If father is to confer the third emperor as the crown prince,

177
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,480
he will have a great contribution.

178
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,480
Without the conferring,

179
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,480
I'm afraid that the one with a heart will be able to pull the three troops.

180
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,480
If he wants to make any changes,

181
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,480
it's not right.

182
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
Change?

183
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,480
This...

184
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,480
Father.

185
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:33,480
After father returns to the palace,

186
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,480
he can open the palace's inner hall.

187
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,480
It is said that the thief left in the palace

188
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,480
and the precious things in the palace

189
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,480
were not taken away.

190
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,480
Inner hall?

191
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:43,480
Yes, father.

192
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:45,480
Father, you should open the palace's inner hall

193
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:48,480
and reward the soldiers who have received the Western capital.

194
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
The soldiers will thank you for your kindness.

195
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,480
Even if someone moves,

196
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
they won't be mad at you.

197
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:59,480
It's still a good idea to have a son and a son.

198
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,480
When I return to the Western capital,

199
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
I will open the palace's inner hall

200
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
and reward the three troops.

201
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Your Majesty, the emperor of the palace is a man of the world.

202
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,480
He is a man of the world.

203
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,480
Long live the emperor.

204
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Long live the emperor.

205
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,480
Your Highness.

206
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,480
Your Highness, you are awake.

207
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,480
Your Highness, you are awake.

208
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,480
It's good that you are awake.

209
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,480
It means that you have a fever.

210
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,480
I am sleepy.

211
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,480
What is that sound?

212
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,480
Your Highness, you have been asleep for many days.

213
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,480
The emperor of the palace said that the emperor of the Western capital

214
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,480
received the Western capital and that he would return to the palace.

215
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,480
Today, the emperor was told that the emperor of the palace

216
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:03,480
received the Western capital and that the sound outside

217
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
was the sound of the three armies' gratitude.

218
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,480
We...

219
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,480
We won.

220
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,480
We won.

221
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
We won.

222
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,480
We won.

223
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
Your Highness, don't worry.

224
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:24,480
We won.

225
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,480
We won.

226
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
We won.

227
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,480
These...

228
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:42,480
These two girls...

229
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,480
Your Highness, this is the He Xiao Wei from the Cui family.

230
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,480
The emperor sent him to take care of you.

231
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,480
He Xiao Wei brought Miss Tao Zi back to the He Xiao Wei.

232
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,480
He took the medicine every day

233
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:57,480
and finally took the poison from Her Highness.

234
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:09,480
Thank you, He Xiao Wei.

235
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Your Highness, you saved the world.

236
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,480
I should thank you for saving the world.

237
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:22,480
How can you be so kind to me?

238
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:30,480
I will definitely thank you for this.

239
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,480
This eun Eyed Chair is not bad.

240
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:45,480
This emblem is a little rigid.

241
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,480
The Chinese intigraphy set is a new invention.

242
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Yes, she is.

243
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,200
Your Majesty.

244
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,600
Greetings, Your Majesty.

245
00:14:58,600 --> 00:14:59,760
I'm flattered.

246
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,800
Prince Qin, you came just in time.

247
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,640
This time, you've received the Western Capital.

248
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,440
You've made a great contribution.

249
00:15:07,080 --> 00:15:07,800
Tell me,

250
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,080
do you want any rewards?

251
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:11,880
Is it gold or gold?

252
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,040
Your Majesty,

253
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,040
I don't want any rewards.

254
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,760
I want to ask for your permission.

255
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,160
I'll send someone to look for the Grandson.

256
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,560
Please allow me to welcome him.

257
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,280
Grandson?

258
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,760
When I was in a mess,

259
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,760
I killed the late emperor and the late crown prince.

260
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:29,760
I was lucky to get the general Han Chang

261
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,040
to protect the Grandson.

262
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:32,560
Your Majesty,

263
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,800
the Grandson is the blood of the late emperor.

264
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,360
Please allow me to welcome him

265
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:39,720
and send him to the capital.

266
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,520
I still have to consider

267
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,600
such a big matter.

268
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:46,560
Your Majesty,

269
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:49,280
the late emperor died and the late crown prince was sent to the country.

270
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:50,680
The late emperor died.

271
00:15:50,960 --> 00:15:52,440
It's a serious matter.

272
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:55,160
I've told you

273
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,000
to think about it.

274
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:03,320
You can go back now.

275
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:05,800
You're very busy now.

276
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,520
Go back and rest.

277
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:10,360
Don't go into the palace if you're busy.

278
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,120
Yes.

279
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,120
Your Highness,

280
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,720
use something.

281
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,000
Jinniang.

282
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,120
Is Sun Jin still alive?

283
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,120
Is Sun Jin still alive?

284
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,120
Yes.

285
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,120
As you said,

286
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,120
I should be worried.

287
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,120
Because of the big trouble,

288
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:11,120
I finally got out of the palace.

289
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:14,120
But I thought that

290
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,120
he would be in the palace

291
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,120
and hold my hand.

292
00:17:24,120 --> 00:17:25,120
What am I thinking about?

293
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,120
I am the late Crown Princess.

294
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,120
Your Highness.

295
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,120
I was in the Eastern Palace

296
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,120
and I was alive.

297
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:43,120
But it was just a moment.

298
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,120
When I was with him,

299
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,120
I felt that I was really alone.

300
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,120
But I am the late Crown Princess.

301
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,120
I shouldn't have fallen in love with him.

302
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:05,120
Your Highness.

303
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,120
I know

304
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,120
I won't say it again.

305
00:18:14,120 --> 00:18:15,120
No one will know

306
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,120
that I am the past between him and me.

307
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,120
No one will know

308
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:26,120
that I am still

309
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:31,120
the late Crown Princess.

310
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:41,120
Your Highness.

311
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,120
Your Highness.

312
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,120
I, Sun Jin,

313
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:59,120
need to be with me.

314
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,120
I will never

315
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:07,120
be alone

316
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,120
and die alone.

317
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,120
Your Highness.

318
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:17,120
You can't say that.

319
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,120
Don't worry.

320
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
I won't die now.

321
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:37,120
I need to keep the Crown Prince safe.

322
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,120
I need to see him

323
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:45,120
and let him be a man.

324
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,120
But

325
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,120
at that time,

326
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,120
I will be in danger.

327
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,120
I will

328
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,120
meet the late Crown Prince.

329
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,120
Your Highness.

330
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,120
Your Highness.

331
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,120
No.

332
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:39,120
You still have the nerve to come to see me.

333
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,120
I thought that Miss Cui

334
00:20:40,120 --> 00:20:42,120
would take me out of here.

335
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Why is Prince Qin so arrogant?

336
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,120
Prince Qin asked me to take care of Consort Xiao.

337
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,120
Consort Xiao's health is much better today.

338
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,120
She lost half a week.

339
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,120
She can't talk anymore.

340
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,120
I have the time to come to see you.

341
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:56,120
I came to see you when I came out

342
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,120
and didn't see my father.

343
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:59,120
You are still not in the mood.

344
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
I don't know

345
00:21:02,120 --> 00:21:03,120
what to do.

346
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:04,120
I didn't see my father.

347
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:05,120
You are still not in the mood.

348
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,120
I'm leaving.

349
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:09,120
I'm going to see my father when I come out of the city.

350
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:11,120
Are you kidding me?

351
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,120
Well,

352
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:14,120
you can stay with me for a while.

353
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,120
I'll go out with you

354
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,120
to visit General Cui in the city.

355
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Okay?

356
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:19,120
Aren't you afraid that my father

357
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,120
will put you in the box

358
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:21,120
and bury you?

359
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,120
Then you will save my father.

360
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:24,120
That's not certain.

361
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,120
What's wrong with you?

362
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,120
Is there something unhappy?

363
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,120
Why are you lying here alone?

364
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,120
No.

365
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:36,120
I read a book at the door.

366
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:38,120
I'm almost asleep.

367
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,120
I heard that His Majesty

368
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,120
opened the palace

369
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,120
and went to the front to reward the three armies.

370
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,120
According to the book,

371
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,120
you have made such a great contribution.

372
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,120
The Prince of Qi's Mansion

373
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,120
should be sleeping in the carriage.

374
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:52,120
Why are you so quiet?

375
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:55,120
I don't like those writers.

376
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,120
Moreover,

377
00:21:56,120 --> 00:21:57,120
I'm the Prince of Qin.

378
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,120
I lead the Zhengxi Army.

379
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:00,120
There are many inconveniences in the education and civil service.

380
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,120
The five generals of the education and civil service

381
00:22:02,120 --> 00:22:04,120
are more unreasonable.

382
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,120
So I want to

383
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,120
close the door and thank the guest.

384
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,120
These civil and civil affairs officials

385
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,120
know my character.

386
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:10,120
They dare not come to me.

387
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,120
It's okay to be a stranger.

388
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,120
Shouldn't we

389
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,120
go to visit the Prime Minister?

390
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:19,120
The Prime Minister was appointed

391
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:21,120
in the court the day before yesterday.

392
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:22,120
His Majesty

393
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,120
wanted to give him a position.

394
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,120
But the Prime Minister kneeled down.

395
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,120
He is really a crazy person.

396
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:29,120
He helped a lot

397
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:30,120
in the Western Changqing before.

398
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,120
So I went to the Prime Minister's Mansion

399
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,120
after the day was off.

400
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,120
I thanked the Prime Minister.

401
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,120
So you thanked the Prime Minister

402
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,120
after the day was off?

403
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,120
Then

404
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
he even didn't even

405
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,120
give His Majesty a reward.

406
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,120
What else can I do?

407
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,120
Since you went to the Gu Mansion,

408
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,120
didn't you see

409
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,120
Gu Wan Niang?

410
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,120
Why did I go to see Gu Wan Niang?

411
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,120
What can I do?

412
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,120
I can't

413
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,120
do anything about it.

414
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,120
Are you jealous?

415
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,120
I'm not.

416
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,120
You are jealous?

417
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,120
I'm not.

418
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,120
I'm going to the city.

419
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
I'm going to see my father.

420
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,120
I'm with you.

421
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,120
Don't worry.

422
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:25,120
No, no, no.

423
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,120
Don't be jealous.

424
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,120
I'm not jealous.

425
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,120
Gu Wan Niang.

426
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,120
Look.

427
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,120
What can I do for you?

428
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,120
Gu Wan Niang is a person

429
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,120
who is full of fragrance.

430
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,120
She is pure and pure.

431
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,120
I'm sure she will be satisfied.

432
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,120
Every one of them

433
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,120
is full of fragrance.

434
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,120
Gu Wan Niang,

435
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,120
please wait.

436
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,120
You said in your letter

437
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:47,120
that after you went to the capital,

438
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,120
you must come to this Gan Guo Hall together.

439
00:23:49,120 --> 00:23:50,120
Today

440
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,120
you are a good friend.

441
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,120
You bought so much this time.

442
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,120
You should eat something.

443
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,120
Why do you sound

444
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
a little unhappy?

445
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,120
I'm not unhappy.

446
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,120
I just remembered

447
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:05,120
that I can only see you

448
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,120
today.

449
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,120
I don't know when I can see you again.

450
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,120
When you were a kid,

451
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,120
you suddenly became a little girl.

452
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,120
You made people surprised.

453
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,120
I wanted to buy less.

454
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,120
As long as you eat

455
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,120
and finish it, you will think of me.

456
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,120
But I thought about

457
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,120
buying more.

458
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:23,120
As long as you eat,

459
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:24,120
you will think of me.

460
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,120
That's better.

461
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,120
Who will think of you

462
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,120
when you eat Gan Guo?

463
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:29,120
Me.

464
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:31,120
I will think of you when I eat.

465
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,120
After all,

466
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
I will like

467
00:24:34,120 --> 00:24:36,120
what you like.

468
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,120
Sir,

469
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,120
your Gan Guo is ready.

470
00:24:42,120 --> 00:24:43,120
Thank you.

471
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:45,120
Wait.

472
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,120
Let's go.

473
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,120
Your Highness.

474
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Your Highness, you look much better.

475
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:57,120
You have been walking for a long time.

476
00:24:58,120 --> 00:24:59,120
Miss Taozi said

477
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,120
that if you keep your health,

478
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,120
you will be fine.

479
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,120
The school is here.

480
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:14,120
Your Highness.

481
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,120
Do you feel better today?

482
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,120
Much better.

483
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:25,120
Come and sit down.

484
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:27,120
Thank you, Your Highness.

485
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,120
Your Highness, you look much better.

486
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:38,120
Taozi told me

487
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:40,120
that after you have cured your illness,

488
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:41,120
your health will be very weak.

489
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,120
You need to use some blood

490
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,120
to make up for it.

491
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,120
I told Prince Qin

492
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:48,120
to choose some good students.

493
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:49,120
He asked me to bring them to the palace

494
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:50,120
and give them to you.

495
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:54,120
Thank you, Prince Qin.

496
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,120
You're welcome.

497
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:05,120
A few days ago,

498
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:06,120
I heard from you

499
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:08,120
that you are from the Cui family.

500
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,120
Prince Qin asked me

501
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,120
to take care of me in the palace.

502
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,120
You've worked hard.

503
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:21,120
No.

504
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,120
Your Highness, you're welcome.

505
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,120
Zhao Ying is just a maid

506
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,120
and a maid.

507
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:27,120
I just came

508
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,120
to talk to you.

509
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:35,120
You must be

510
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,120
Prince Qin's lover.

511
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,120
I've never met Prince Qin,

512
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,120
but when I was in the most difficult situation,

513
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,120
I was close to him.

514
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:55,120
His guards knew

515
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,120
that he could be a maid

516
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,120
from all kinds of details.

517
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,120
I know he doesn't have a son-in-law.

518
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,120
You must be his lover.

519
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,120
He was relieved

520
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,120
to have me entrusted to you.

521
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,120
Your Highness, you're so wise.

522
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,120
I'm a person

523
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,120
who has no intention to marry a man.

524
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:24,120
I can only stop this life

525
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,120
if I die.

526
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:29,120
Prince Qin promised me

527
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,120
that he would help me

528
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:33,120
find my grandson.

529
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,120
I know Prince Qin

530
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:38,120
is also a person

531
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,120
who is loyal to his promise.

532
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,120
I'm the late Crown Princess.

533
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,120
Now I'm in the palace.

534
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,120
I'm in a very awkward situation.

535
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,120
I want to leave the palace

536
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,120
and find a quiet place

537
00:27:58,120 --> 00:27:59,120
in a quiet place.

538
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,120
I also want you to tell Prince Qin

539
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:05,120
that I'm a prince.

540
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
Don't worry, Your Highness.

541
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,120
Prince Qin will definitely agree to it.

542
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:18,120
Do you really agree?

543
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,120
You're also very talented.

544
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:56,120
Prince Qin came a few days ago.

545
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,120
I was going to

546
00:28:58,120 --> 00:28:59,120
ask you to go out with him

547
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:01,120
but I thought

548
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,120
I should forget it.

549
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:04,120
It's not a big deal.

550
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,120
There will be more opportunities in the future.

551
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,120
Yes.

552
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:13,120
Your Majesty,

553
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,120
you're the third emperor.

554
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:18,120
But I'm not

555
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:19,120
a reward to Prince Qin.

556
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,120
I think

557
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,120
there must be a small person

558
00:29:22,120 --> 00:29:23,120
around you.

559
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,120
Maybe

560
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,120
you're just a little bit suspicious.

561
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,120
The world is so different.

562
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,120
The emperor is a high-ranking official

563
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,120
and he's not rewarded.

564
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,120
I think

565
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,120
this is also the difficult part of your Majesty.

566
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,120
Indeed.

567
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,120
Prince Qin is already the most precious

568
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:44,120
to Prince Zhong.

569
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,120
But

570
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,120
Prince Qin has received two golds

571
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
and has just been paid for the royal court.

572
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,120
He has done such a great job.

573
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:52,120
He didn't even get a reward.

574
00:29:52,120 --> 00:29:54,120
I really can't say it.

575
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,120
Father, do you think...

576
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
His Majesty is in the top of the spring.

577
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:03,120
At this time,

578
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,120
he has no intention to appoint a crown prince.

579
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,120
Otherwise,

580
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,120
the royal court will definitely appoint Prince Qin.

581
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,120
But Prince Qin is the chief.

582
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,120
Prince Qin

583
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
has his own personal grudge.

584
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:19,120
Since His Majesty ascended the throne,

585
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,120
he hasn't been appointed as the empress.

586
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:23,120
The empress is the first one to be appointed.

587
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:26,120
I plan to

588
00:30:26,120 --> 00:30:27,120
go to the office tomorrow

589
00:30:28,120 --> 00:30:29,120
to ask His Majesty

590
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
to appoint Prince Qin as the birth mother.

591
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:33,120
Prince Qin has such a great power.

592
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:34,120
His birth mother

593
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:36,120
should be appointed as the empress.

594
00:30:38,120 --> 00:30:39,120
I heard

595
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,120
Prince Qin's birth mother is very humble.

596
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,120
Whether she is humble or not,

597
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
she should be the birth mother

598
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,120
of Prince Qin.

599
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Shouldn't her birth mother

600
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,120
be appointed as the empress?

601
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:58,120
I have decided.

602
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,120
Prince Qin's birth mother, Dong Shi,

603
00:31:02,120 --> 00:31:04,120
will be appointed as the empress.

604
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,120
Prince Qin's birth mother, Liu Shi,

605
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,120
will be appointed as Zhao Yi.

606
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:14,120
That's right.

607
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,120
That's right.

608
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,120
Your Majesty, I think it's inappropriate.

609
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:25,120
I,

610
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,120
am hereby conferred on you.

611
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,120
I am hereby conferring on you

612
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:30,120
the title of the empress.

613
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,120
I am hereby conferring on you

614
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,120
the title of the empress.

615
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,120
Since Prince Qin ascended the throne,

616
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,120
he has been appointed as the empress.

617
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:37,120
I have made such a great contribution.

618
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,120
If the birth mother is appointed as Zhao Yi,

619
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,120
it will be hard to show

620
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:41,120
the title of the empress

621
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,120
and the title of the empress.

622
00:31:44,120 --> 00:31:45,120
Your Majesty,

623
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,120
I think

624
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:48,120
Prince Qin of Liu Shi is appointed as the empress.

625
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,120
He should be appointed as the empress.

626
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,120
I am hereby conferring on you.

627
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,120
I am hereby conferring on you.

628
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
I am hereby conferring on you.

629
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
I am hereby conferring on you.

630
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,120
You are all

631
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:01,120
saying that Prince Qin has made great contributions

632
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,120
to the country and has taken over Liang and Dong.

633
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:07,120
Your Majesty, please calm down.

634
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,120
I am incompetent.

635
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,120
Shut up.

636
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,120
Liu Shi is born to be a concubine.

637
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,120
Is it because he is the birth mother of Prince Qin?

638
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,120
Does he have to be appointed as the empress?

639
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,120
Your Majesty,

640
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,120
since birth mother is born to be a concubine,

641
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:31,120
I am sorry to bother you.

642
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:33,120
I will go to the royal court

643
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,120
and go to the prison to see the concubines.

644
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:44,120
You...

645
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,120
You...

646
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:49,120
Your Majesty, please calm down.

647
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,120
Prince Qin is born to be a concubine.

648
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,120
Since birth mother is born to be a concubine,

649
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,120
he is the birth mother of a concubine.

650
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,120
Your Majesty, please forgive Prince Qin.

651
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,120
Get out.

652
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,120
Get out of here.

653
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:04,120
I don't want to see you again.

654
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,120
Get out.

655
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Get out.

656
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:27,120
The King of the Demon King.

657
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,120
The King of the Demon King.

658
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:48,320
Prince Qin Schule生エ

659
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,720
You should avoid going to court.

660
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:08,560
Your Lordship, the prince zag

661
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,220
Dark Jewellery

662
00:34:09,420 --> 00:34:10,400
Yourполition

663
00:34:10,720 --> 00:34:22,120
And the

664
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:30,480
day

665
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:36,780
The

666
00:34:36,780 --> 00:34:40,780
Grandma told me that if I have any wish,

667
00:34:40,780 --> 00:34:42,780
I will make a bamboo court.

668
00:34:44,780 --> 00:34:45,780
When she falls,

669
00:34:46,780 --> 00:34:48,780
my wish will come true.

670
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:51,780
At that time, I really wanted to see my mother.

671
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,780
Everyone has a mother, but I don't.

672
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,780
So I made many, many bamboo court.

673
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:00,780
I turned the wall and kept going down.

674
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:05,780
Until I found out when I finished all the things,

675
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:08,780
it turned out that grandma was the one who made the most.

676
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:13,780
No matter how many bamboo court I make,

677
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,780
I can't make it.

678
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:26,780
When the past is gone, you will still remember.

679
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,780
Let go of me.

680
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,780
Close your eyes.

681
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:33,780
You are the most dangerous maid.

682
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:35,780
You will kill her when you are born.

683
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:39,780
You will still remember.

684
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:45,780
I still want to see you.

685
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,780
Let go of me.

686
00:35:47,780 --> 00:35:48,780
It's okay.

687
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:55,780
Tell me.

688
00:35:55,780 --> 00:35:57,780
Why did you steal your brother's stuff?

689
00:35:58,780 --> 00:35:59,780
I didn't steal his stuff.

690
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,780
He stole my bamboo court.

691
00:36:01,780 --> 00:36:03,780
He even scolded me.

692
00:36:04,780 --> 00:36:05,780
What did he scold you for?

693
00:36:07,780 --> 00:36:09,780
You tell me.

694
00:36:10,780 --> 00:36:12,780
What did he scold you for?

695
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:14,780
You can't tell me, right?

696
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,780
You dare to lie to me?

697
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:17,780
You...

698
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:19,780
I didn't.

699
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,780
You still keep your mouth shut.

700
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:21,780
I didn't.

701
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:22,780
You are lying.

702
00:36:22,780 --> 00:36:23,780
I didn't.

703
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:24,780
You still keep your mouth shut.

704
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,780
I didn't lie to you.

705
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:27,780
I didn't.

706
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,780
You keep your mouth shut.

707
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,780
I didn't lie to you.

708
00:36:31,780 --> 00:36:32,780
You are lying.

709
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,780
I didn't.

710
00:36:34,780 --> 00:36:36,780
You are lying.

711
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,780
I didn't.

712
00:36:38,780 --> 00:36:40,780
You are lying.

713
00:36:40,780 --> 00:36:41,780
I didn't.

714
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,780
The End

715
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:11,780
Episode 19

716
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:15,780
When you were a kid,

717
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:17,780
you saved my life.

718
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:20,780
Then you came to the family.

719
00:37:22,780 --> 00:37:24,780
No matter what I did,

720
00:37:25,780 --> 00:37:26,780
you supported me silently.

721
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,780
But I made a mistake.

722
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,780
You helped me.

723
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:35,780
You used my name.

724
00:37:36,780 --> 00:37:38,780
I don't know how dangerous it is.

725
00:37:39,780 --> 00:37:40,780
In the end,

726
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,780
you died for saving me.

727
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,780
You have been my son for more than ten years.

728
00:38:08,780 --> 00:38:09,780
Until today,

729
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:12,780
you have been the one

730
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,780
who can make you

731
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:15,780
the true owner of this place.

732
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,780
But in my heart,

733
00:38:22,780 --> 00:38:24,780
you have always been like my own son.

734
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,780
Feng'er,

735
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:31,780
my father

736
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,780
will definitely take revenge for you.

737
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:39,780
From today on,

738
00:38:40,780 --> 00:38:41,780
you are just

739
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,780
not Cui Lin anymore.

740
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:46,780
You are Liu Chengfeng.

741
00:38:49,780 --> 00:38:50,780
But you are always my son.

742
00:38:52,780 --> 00:38:54,780
You are also my brother forever.

743
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:02,780
I will never forget you.

744
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,780
I will never forget you.

745
00:39:05,780 --> 00:39:06,780
I will never forget you.

746
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:08,780
I will never forget you.

747
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:10,780
I will never forget you.

748
00:39:11,780 --> 00:39:12,780
I will never forget you.

749
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:14,780
I will never forget you.

750
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:16,780
I will never forget you.

751
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,780
I will never forget you.

752
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:20,780
I will never forget you.

753
00:39:21,780 --> 00:39:22,780
I will never forget you.

754
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:24,780
I will never forget you.

755
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:26,780
I will never forget you.

756
00:39:27,780 --> 00:39:28,780
I will never forget you.

757
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:30,780
I will never forget you.

758
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:32,780
I will never forget you.

759
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:02,780
My son is going to be in the palace.

760
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:04,780
My son is going to be in the palace.

761
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:06,780
I will never forget you.

762
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:08,780
I will never forget you.

763
00:40:09,780 --> 00:40:10,780
I will never forget you.

764
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,780
I never thought

765
00:40:24,780 --> 00:40:25,780
that you and I

766
00:40:26,780 --> 00:40:27,780
could leave the palace alive and live well.

767
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:30,780
You see,

768
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:31,940
but bow before her.

769
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,220
Yourament challenges me too.

770
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:44,020
Let's go, go, go consideration Oh,

00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,700

772
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:59,000
The end of the long wait, a bag of gold

773
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:01,880
collected from the聲 on page

774
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,740
Come up and eat meat.

775
00:41:02,740 --> 00:41:04,000
Hurry up.

776
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,200
This river ...

777
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,520
In search of kindle komme,

778
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,880

779
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:08,420
Come on.

780
00:41:08,420 --> 00:41:08,820
Bring her wine!

781
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:09,440
In search of wine!

782
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:10,220
Old Yong Shan.

783
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:13,780
Here comes my哈 trainingancy.

784
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:18,080
The first class comes to manhunt my brothers.

785
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,680
Nanen Sect.

786
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:23,800
The first class comes to manhunt everyone.

787
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:29,500
The first classmodern será Grad tripes up,

788
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,000
What do you guys think,

789
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,480
Here, have some lamb.

790
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:33,440
Okay.

791
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,760
Let's have a taste of lamb.

792
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,520
Come on.

793
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,720
Give Xiaopai some meat.

794
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,000
Let's have a taste of lamb.

795
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,480
Have a taste.

796
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,160
Come on.

797
00:41:43,040 --> 00:41:44,000
Xiaopai, go ahead.

798
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:45,720
This is good.

799
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,000
Come on, let's drink.

800
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:49,720
Go in.

801
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:51,560
You're eating?

802
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:54,200
This is the situation now.

803
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:56,440
You still feel like having a drink,

804
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:58,000
barbecue and singing?

805
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,160
Come on.

806
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:01,760
Come on.

807
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:02,800
Do you know

808
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,680
the great emperor of Sun Jing's army?

809
00:42:04,680 --> 00:42:05,880
Have some meat.

810
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:07,560
Let's see how it goes.

811
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,520
Go, go, go.

812
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,040
There's a new king's ear.

813
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,720
I want to talk to him.

814
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,200
I've been waiting for this day.

815
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:22,960
Sun Jing

816
00:42:23,320 --> 00:42:25,000
may be poisoned by the poison,

817
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:26,480
but he'll wake up sooner or later.

818
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,400
The great emperor of Sun Jing's army

819
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,120
is on the way.

820
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:31,240
After the great emperor and Sun Jing

821
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:32,360
return to the same place,

822
00:42:32,360 --> 00:42:33,360
it'll be troublesome.

823
00:42:36,080 --> 00:42:37,120
Shi Qilong,

824
00:42:37,120 --> 00:42:38,400
do you mean

825
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:39,880
I've been dreaming these days?

826
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,840
The best way is

827
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,920
to ask General Pei

828
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,040
to send you to Changzhou.

829
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:48,640
This is Changzhou.

830
00:42:49,600 --> 00:42:50,800
This is Han Shui.

831
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:53,920
Yongnan, Zhifei.

832
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,040
This is the best place

833
00:42:56,040 --> 00:43:00,080
to kill the great emperor of Zheng Baiyuan.

834
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:01,120
Don't worry.

835
00:43:01,520 --> 00:43:02,880
Father and I

836
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:03,920
will take care of this.

837
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,360
There's one more thing.

838
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:11,240
I'll take care of your business.

839
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:13,320
No need.

840
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:15,440
You need to help me.

841
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,120
Don't worry.

842
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,320
Princess.

843
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,080
Lord Qin,

844
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,560
is there any message for you?

845
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,240
I should go now.

846
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:54,800
I don't want to see each other,

847
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,640
It turns out that General Pei

848
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:04,040
sent a letter for Prince Qin himself.

849
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:07,240
Please give this letter to He Xiao Wei.

850
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:08,120
No.

851
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:10,480
You know that it's Cui Xiao Qin now.

852
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,400
He's outside Luoyang

853
00:44:12,600 --> 00:44:13,600
in the Cui's camp.

854
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:16,840
Shi Qin Lang.

855
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,200
Are you going to talk to Cui about something important?

856
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,720
Or have you found a way to take back East Capital?

857
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,080
Not all.

858
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:25,240
It's private matter.

859
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,560
You said that a man in the Qin's Mansion

860
00:44:28,840 --> 00:44:31,640
used Lord Yulin to make a mistake.

861
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:32,840
But I don't believe it.

862
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,200
You can't find someone to send you a letter.

863
00:44:34,320 --> 00:44:34,880
What about Er Dong?

864
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:37,000
You're right.

865
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,360
Now Lord Yulin is in charge.

866
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:40,400
He's giving the man a job in the mansion every day.

867
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:41,920
No matter how good he is,

868
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,720
he can't come back in a day.

869
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,120
Shi Qin Lang.

870
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:48,560
I told you.

871
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:49,560
If anyone says that

872
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:50,240
Fu Tang is in trouble,

873
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:51,040
I won't give in.

874
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:52,640
It'll be over soon.

875
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:00,080
And the snacks I bought

876
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:01,280
from the army river.

877
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:02,120
Send them over.

878
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:02,920
He loves them.

879
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:04,400
Hurry up.

880
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:08,480
Shi Qin Lang is now in charge of the software.

881
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:11,160
But he only thinks about you.

882
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,160
Don't you want to see it?

883
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:18,800
Don't worry, General Pei.

884
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:22,120
Even if the bad guys in the world die,

885
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,400
Lord Qin will be fine.

886
00:45:25,560 --> 00:45:27,000
Your Highness is not at risk.

887
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:28,720
You saved your life many times.

888
00:45:28,720 --> 00:45:30,240
You didn't put it in your heart.

889
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:31,360
It seems that

890
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:33,720
you're really a good man.

891
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:38,320
Lord Qin is a great man.

892
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:41,040
If he's still in the court,

893
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:42,560
what can His Majesty reward him?

894
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,600
If His Majesty is not rewarded,

895
00:45:44,800 --> 00:45:46,240
then the two brothers of Lord Qin

896
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,800
and the officials in the court

897
00:45:48,680 --> 00:45:49,880
will be worried?

898
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,200
Lord Qin's father is being imprisoned.

899
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:53,360
He looks at the outside.

900
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,720
The military power is at risk.

901
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:56,200
But actually,

902
00:45:57,000 --> 00:45:58,760
did he really lose the army of the Xi Army?

903
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:01,960
General Pei is also a man who is in charge of the army.

904
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:03,560
When should he go out?

905
00:46:03,760 --> 00:46:05,320
When should he be in charge of the cultivation?

906
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:07,120
It's the same.

907
00:46:10,280 --> 00:46:11,000
It's late.

908
00:46:11,160 --> 00:46:12,200
General Pei

909
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,200
is not convenient to stay at my Cui's army.

910
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,400
I won't send you off.

911
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:18,840
Goodbye.

912
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:29,960
The person who sent the letter is not Erduo.

913
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:31,760
Someone is very disappointed now.

914
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:34,200
No.

915
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:35,680
No.

916
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:39,800
You must be hungry at night.

917
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:41,600
Eat the snacks you just sent.

918
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,600
Eat them.

919
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:44,800
You're the best.

920
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:46,000
I'm a little hungry today.

921
00:46:46,240 --> 00:46:47,000
Eat them.

922
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:53,920
Xiao Wei,

923
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,800
this snack is not sweet nor greasy.

924
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:56,960
It's really delicious.

925
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,760
You really don't read that letter?

926
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:07,760
How about you read it?

927
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:23,160
How can it be a white paper?

928
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,560
Xiao Wei,

929
00:47:27,760 --> 00:47:29,360
you've guessed it, right?

930
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:31,160
What does it mean?

931
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:35,160
Li Ni asked Pei Yuan to send the letter.

932
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:37,040
It means

933
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:38,760
although he is soft-hearted,

934
00:47:39,160 --> 00:47:40,560
he is still a useful person.

935
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,360
And the Xi Army

936
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:44,200
still listens to him.

937
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,960
Other things are not important.

938
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,760
Why do you have to be so silent?

939
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,440
You two smart people

940
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:55,240
always keep going like this.

941
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,000
Are you tired?

942
00:47:57,000 --> 00:47:58,040
Yes.

943
00:47:58,200 --> 00:47:59,640
Some people are tired.

944
00:47:59,640 --> 00:48:01,000
If you keep talking,

945
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:04,040
Erduo will run away.

946
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:29,160
If you forget the six-year camp,

947
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,960
when the memory

948
00:48:32,800 --> 00:48:35,560
is gone,

949
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:39,560
you can go back to your hometown.

950
00:48:40,360 --> 00:48:41,960
I will go back to my hometown.

951
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:43,560
I will go back to my hometown.

952
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:44,760
I will go back to my hometown.

953
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,960
I will go back to my hometown.

954
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:46,960
I will go back to my hometown.

955
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:47,960
I will go back to my hometown.

956
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:48,960
I will go back to my hometown.

957
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:49,960
I will go back to my hometown.

958
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:50,960
I will go back to my hometown.

959
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:51,960
I will go back to my hometown.

960
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:52,960
I will go back to my hometown.

961
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:53,960
I will go back to my hometown.

962
00:48:53,960 --> 00:48:54,960
I will go back to my hometown.

963
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,160
If I am so burdened inside your heart,

964
00:49:01,280 --> 00:49:07,160
I will never accept your protection.

965
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:13,920
Don't let your memories be lost,

966
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:17,240
always be a girl who smells good,

967
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,660
ginger,

968
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

969
00:49:23,660 --> 00:49:27,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

970
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:31,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

971
00:49:31,660 --> 00:49:35,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

972
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:39,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

973
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:43,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

974
00:49:43,660 --> 00:49:47,660
I'm afraid I'll be too tired to be with you

975
00:49:47,660 --> 00:49:55,660
Waiting is my promise

976
00:49:57,660 --> 00:50:03,660
If I love you, I'll tell you my promise

977
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:10,660
After the rain, I'll love you

978
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:16,660
I'm waiting for you to sing

979
00:50:16,660 --> 00:50:20,660
I'm waiting for you to sing

980
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:26,660
I remember the promise I made for you

981
00:50:26,660 --> 00:50:30,660
I won't be attracted to you

982
00:50:30,660 --> 00:50:33,660
I'll love you

983
00:50:34,660 --> 00:50:38,660
I'm waiting for you to sing

984
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:45,660
I'm waiting for you to sing
