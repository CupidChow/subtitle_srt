00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,480
Then we'll not gather in the dog theater anymore.

00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,760
Ke'ai Cobra

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:19,120

00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
The wind blows through the wind

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The wind blows through the wind

6
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The wind blows through the wind

7
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The wind blows through the wind

8
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
The wind blows through the wind

9
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,000
The wind blows through the wind

10
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
The wind blows through the wind

11
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,000
The wind blows through the wind

12
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
The wind blows through the wind

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The wind blows through the wind

14
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The wind blows through the wind

15
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The wind blows through the wind

16
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
The wind blows through the wind

17
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:28,000
The wind blows through the wind

18
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,100
The courage's迷失

00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,200
Shooting arrows and trying to登録 us

00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
Episode 24

21
00:01:46,760 --> 00:01:48,200
Anyone there?

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,040
Anyone there?

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,680
Anybody there?!

24
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
I've been waiting for three days.

25
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
Who are you?

26
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,000
Is there anyone around?

27
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,000
Xiao Chen, I'm thirsty.

28
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,000
Come and get me some water.

29
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Xiao Chen,

30
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
why are you here?

31
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
As long as you let me go,

32
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
my family has thousands of wealth.

33
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's all yours.

34
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
I'll guard the underground army,

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
and the underground army.

36
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,000
It's you.

37
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Cui Li.

38
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
You're not dead.

39
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm not Cui Li.

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
A Li,

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
you're so lucky to be alive.

42
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
A Li,

43
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
you're so lucky to be alive.

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I've told you

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
that I'm not Cui Li.

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I'm not Cui Li.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm not Cui Li.

48
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I'm not Cui Li.

49
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I'm not Cui Li.

50
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Yes, yes.

51
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
No, no, no.

52
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You're not Cui Li.

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
You're not Cui Li.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
I'm Liu Cheng Feng.

55
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:36,000
Remember me.

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Remember me.

57
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Remember me.

58
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Liu Cheng Feng,

59
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Liu Gongzi,

60
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Liu Shou Fang, Liu Gongzi.

61
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Liu Gongzi.

62
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm so proud of you.

63
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I really don't want to be Liu Gongzi.

64
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Liu Gongzi,

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
believe me.

66
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Just let me go.

67
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Liu Gongzi.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Liu Gongzi.

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
The prisoner.

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You're not Cui Li.

71
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
You're not Cui Li.

72
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Our Sui Jia Yu

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
has the blood and blood of the people in the world.

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Anyone who is unlucky

75
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
would never be able to catch the prisoner.

76
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Yes, I am Liu Chengfeng.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I am Cui Lin.

78
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Do you know what you just ate?

79
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a poison made by the Immortal of the Heart.

80
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
If you don't obediently listen to me,

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,000
you will die in a flash without taking the antidote.

82
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Liu, you are not worthy of being a Prime Minister.

83
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,000
You...

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,000
As long as you let me go,

85
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,000
I will do anything.

86
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Liu, I will do anything.

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I will do anything.

88
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
As long as you obediently listen to me,

89
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
according to my order,

90
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I will definitely give you the antidote.

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
I will definitely give you the antidote.

92
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
As long as you obediently listen to me,

93
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I will definitely give you the antidote.

94
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Lord Liu, Lord Liu.

95
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Lord Liu.

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Boss, I picked this up from the mountain.

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
It's really good.

98
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
I really like it.

99
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Oh, right. How is the Immortal of the Heart?

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,000
It's gone.

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,000
General, he released it from the prison.

102
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,000
I, Zhao Jun Gui, hit him 30 times first.

103
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What? 30 times?

104
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
If you don't say it,

105
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:51,000
your King of Qin is really a good kid.

106
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
He was beaten like that.

107
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,000
He didn't even ask General to forgive him.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
He is like this.

109
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
He won't be soft-hearted till death.

110
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Actually, our General is also soft-hearted.

111
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
But King of Qin said a few soft words to me.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
He didn't even know it was so cruel.

113
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It's all your hard work.

114
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
You should eat one.

115
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
It's okay.

116
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You can eat more if you like.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I'll eat this one.

118
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
Okay.

119
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
It turns out like this.

120
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
What turns out like this?

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
It turns out that you are all the same.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
You are all soft-hearted.

123
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm fierce.

124
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Okay, okay.

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You are fierce.

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Okay, okay.

127
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
You are fierce.

128
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
General,

129
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
the battlefield is clean.

130
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
The servants just brought back.

131
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
They are having tea.

132
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Ying,

133
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:25,000
shouldn't I do this?

134
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Father,

135
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
what's wrong with you?

136
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
You just got out of the city.

137
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I reported to the court

138
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
that you are a boy.

139
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,000
After growing up,

140
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Liu Chengfeng,

141
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
the name of the top-ranking Cui Lin,

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
became my son.

143
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
You are a girl.

144
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
You are always safe and sound.

145
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You follow me out to fight.

146
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
In the future,

147
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,000
I will really help you.

148
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
A man who is willing to be in jail

149
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,000
is more than that.

150
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Don't say that you and father

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
can't stand it.

152
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Father, what are you talking about?

153
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I like to fight.

154
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I like to live like this.

155
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There are so many men in the world.

156
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I can do

157
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
everything they can do.

158
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Why do I still have a family?

159
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
A girl

160
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
always wants to have a baby.

161
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
Actually,

162
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Feng'er is also good.

163
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I think she...

164
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
Father,

165
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
the world is so big.

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
It's so cool.

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
I haven't been to many places.

168
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I have been there.

169
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I want to see many things.

170
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If the family is a kind of

171
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
living and death,

172
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
there is no such thing as her.

173
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why?

174
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
She is just one of the thousands of people

175
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,000
in the world.

176
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Father will be old one day.

177
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
He will leave you.

178
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,000
By then,

179
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
you will be alone.

180
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
What do I have to face?

181
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
Go to see your mother.

182
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Father,

183
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I live happily ever after.

184
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
After a hundred years,

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
you will see my mother.

186
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Tell her that

187
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
this is my favorite way of life.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
I think she will be happy

189
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
when she knows it.

190
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
What else

191
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
can you do

192
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
to make your daughter happy

193
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,000
and happy?

194
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
It's more complete.

195
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
General,

196
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
the scout team

197
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
found a suspicious person.

198
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,000
They went down the hall

199
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
and found the chief of Cui Li.

200
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,000
Don't let He Xiao Wei know about this.

201
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Kill him.

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
I will go there myself.

203
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Yes, general.

204
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,000
Mr. Liu.

205
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Cui Yi is coming.

206
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
What should I say?

207
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Do you remember?

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I remember, Mr. Liu.

209
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
I remember.

210
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mr. Liu,

211
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
if I cooperate with you to play this game,

212
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
can you give me the antidote

213
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
and take me as your disciple?

214
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Mr. Liu, don't worry.

215
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
I will cooperate with you to play this game.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
I will cooperate.

217
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
I will cooperate.

218
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
I will cooperate.

219
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Report.

220
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
General,

221
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Cui Li has been in danger.

222
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
He is in the woods.

223
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Give me the antidote.

224
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Don't let him escape.

225
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
Yes.

226
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Don't come over.

227
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't come over.

228
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
Come here.

229
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
I will kill him.

230
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
Don't come over.

231
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Cooperate.

232
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Uncle.

233
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Don't move.

234
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Uncle.

235
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I was forced to do this.

236
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
I was forced to do this.

237
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,000
Let him go.

238
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,000
Uncle,

239
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,000
I am not qualified.

240
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Don't come over.

241
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Uncle,

242
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
don't come over.

243
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Let him go.

244
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You are my son.

245
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,000
Otherwise,

246
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
the Imperial Army will not let you die.

247
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,000
Uncle,

248
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
I have to do this.

249
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
I was forced to do this.

250
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
I didn't kill Li.

251
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
He wanted to kill me.

252
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,000
So I planned to

253
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:59,000
force Li into the river.

254
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,000
But when they leave,

255
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:03,000
I will save Li right away.

256
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,000
And I will save him.

257
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,000
Uncle.

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Uncle.

259
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Let him go.

260
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
I will help you.

261
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,000
Let him go.

262
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:36,000
Let him go.

263
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,000
Let him go.

264
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Let him go.

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,000
I won.

266
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:08,000
Uncle,

267
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,000
why do you always let me practice this?

268
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
Because you are my daughter.

269
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,000
You are so cruel.

270
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,000
If I have to take you with me,

271
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
I hope that

272
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
you can save me.

273
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Come here.

274
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
Did you let me practice?

275
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Of course.

276
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
You are my son.

277
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,000
As long as you want to practice,

278
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I will practice with you.

279
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Thank you, father.

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
Thank you, father.

281
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:42,000
Don't mention it.

282
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,000
I will teach you.

283
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,000
Let him go.

284
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Let him go.

285
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,000
Send the horse.

286
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Yes.

287
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
I said

288
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,000
to let him go.

289
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
With the military law of the family,

290
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,000
I can spare your life.

291
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:33,000
If you don't want to,

292
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
you can't punish me with the military law.

293
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Go.

294
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,000
What did you say?

295
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
This...

296
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
Your Highness,

297
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I will do it.

298
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,000
Go back to your work.

299
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Don't worry.

300
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
I won't let this soup

301
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
be spilled.

302
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
But his...

303
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,000
Taozi.

304
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,000
Come here.

305
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
No, I...

306
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,000
I...

307
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
No.

308
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Where is it?

309
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,000
Your wound is getting worse.

310
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Then you won't take the medicine for me.

311
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
I can't take it.

312
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,000
Of course I will take it.

313
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:35,000
Then I will teach you.

314
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Watch it.

315
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,000
Do you dare?

316
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,000
Watch it.

317
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
It's hard to say.

318
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
You are so stupid.

319
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
You want to avoid my father.

320
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,000
You will be angry if you watch it.

321
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:44,000
I will teach you.

322
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
I will teach you.

323
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I will teach you.

324
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
I will teach you.

325
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,000
I will teach you.

326
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,000
I will teach you.

327
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
I will teach you.

328
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,000
I will teach you.

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,000
I will teach you.

330
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,000
You will be angry if you watch it.

331
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Maybe

332
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,000
you will be beaten next time.

333
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
I will teach you next time.

334
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
I think

335
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,000
this soup is almost ready.

336
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
Have a try.

337
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Let me have a big bite.

338
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
A big bite.

339
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
And some dates.

340
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Okay, try it.

341
00:16:34,520 --> 00:16:36,520
How is it? Is it sweet?

342
00:16:39,520 --> 00:16:40,520
Not bad.

343
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Then do you want me to try it?

344
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,360
There are still so many.

345
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,360
You want it yourself?

346
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,920
If it's bitter, I'll try it for you.

347
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:50,320
If it's sweet,

348
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,920
can you let me try it?

349
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,120
Let me try it.

350
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
An Ying, come out of my room.

351
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Mr. Gu.

352
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Mr. Gu, wake up.

353
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,000
Am I dreaming?

354
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
I can still come back to see you alive.

355
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,000
Mr. Gu, you're back safely.

356
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
We're very happy.

357
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
That's great.

358
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
We can be together again.

359
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Tian.

360
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,000
Don't get up.

361
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,000
You have to rest.

362
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,000
Tian.

363
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Shu was also caught by Cui Li.

364
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I wonder where Cui Li is.

365
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,000
I know.

366
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
He was saved too.

367
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,000
Thank you, father.

368
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,000
You're father's son.

369
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Why are you so angry?

370
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,000
Maybe...

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
Maybe it's the end of the world.

372
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I'm a little confused.

373
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
I thought I was dreaming.

374
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,000
Dislike the dead extremely.

375
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Look.

376
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,000
I'mAH.

377
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,000
My body has been茂ry since I was a child.

378
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
Just now, the physician dignified your pulse

379
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:10,000
as if you were older.

380
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Maybe even before that,

381
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,000
this is good.

382
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
You're right.

383
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,060
Go to Scriptures Guinea reporting by internet

384
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:28,440
Shuig She

385
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,580
Prince, are you going to kill?

386
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:38,920
If you don't come back

387
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,820
I'm really going to be pickled

388
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,120
It's hard for me to stay alive

389
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,520
I couldn't save him

390
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:46,060
I can't just go see

391
00:19:46,560 --> 00:19:47,980
He is your brother

392
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,540
I'll just tell him

393
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,860
But he's not.

394
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,180
You even gave him a piece of chess

395
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,500
and he's already broken.

396
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,780
He's called his brother.

397
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:57,460
What?

398
00:19:57,620 --> 00:19:58,420
He doesn't have a name?

399
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:02,220
He's really called Liu Cheng Feng.

400
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,660
Although he doesn't believe in Cui,

401
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,100
he really is my brother.

402
00:20:08,660 --> 00:20:09,820
Anyway, I don't like him.

403
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,860
This man is heartless.

404
00:20:12,020 --> 00:20:13,060
He sold his copper coffin

405
00:20:13,180 --> 00:20:14,780
and killed so many brothers in the war.

406
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:16,500
Moreover,

407
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,900
because I couldn't save him in time,

408
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,340
he had a temper with me.

409
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:21,900
You never do that

410
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:22,780
because of others.

411
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,580
When he came back,

412
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:26,180
you went to see him and saw him for a long time.

413
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,340
Even if he's really a brother,

414
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,460
you're too much.

415
00:20:29,700 --> 00:20:30,940
So petty.

416
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,500
Then tonight,

417
00:20:32,740 --> 00:20:34,580
I'll let the kitchen cook you a meal.

418
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:35,740
I'll let you drink slowly.

419
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,620
You still owe me that time.

420
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,700
What?

421
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:44,260
Did I make a mistake?

422
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,140
Fine.

423
00:20:45,340 --> 00:20:46,780
Then I'll drink one for you.

424
00:20:46,940 --> 00:20:48,260
Let's drink together.

425
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:49,420
I'll take care of the medicine.

426
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:58,860
When Cui Dajiao comes,

427
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,060
there's no chance.

428
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,540
Prince,

429
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,500
you've come here in the right time.

430
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:29,040
Great

431
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,340
and besides.

432
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:34,500
Cui Dajiao obviously wanted to get rid of you.

433
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,660
He killed so many soldiers.

434
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:40,740
He also killed A Xing.

435
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,900
I've long been thinking of killing him.

436
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,500
Even now,

437
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:49,500
You're here to help me with Xiao Wei's poisoning.

438
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:54,500
But I didn't expect that General would let him take care of Xiao Wei.

439
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,500
Young Master, General,

440
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:04,500
are you going to agree to marry Xiao Wei to Lin Ni?

441
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,500
All the people who won't let me marry Ying

442
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
will have to die.

443
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,500
Since you're willing to lock the door,

444
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:19,500
let him die first.

445
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,500
Father, you're looking for me?

446
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,500
Feng, let's go.

447
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:36,500
Father, you suddenly called me like that.

448
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:38,500
I'm a little bit used to it.

449
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:40,500
Feng,

450
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,500
since you fell into the water,

451
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:45,500
I sent a lot of people to look for you for a long time.

452
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:47,500
Why couldn't you find me?

453
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:51,500
I thought you were already dead.

454
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,500
Later, I thought a lot about the money

455
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,500
you gave me with Ying.

456
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Before,

457
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,500
I was too selfish.

458
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,500
Although I asked you when I was little,

459
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,500
whether you were willing to be my son,

460
00:23:09,500 --> 00:23:11,500
but you still didn't understand.

461
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:13,500
Father,

462
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:20,500
I've thought it over.

463
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:23,500
I want you to change your name to Liu Cheng Feng.

464
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,500
But you're still my son.

465
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,500
I'll tell everyone that

466
00:23:29,500 --> 00:23:31,500
you're my son.

467
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:34,500
Father,

468
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,500
are you asking me to be your son?

469
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:40,500
I'm not.

470
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,500
Are you asking me to be your son?

471
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,500
Ying is now older.

472
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
She's a little bit more mature.

473
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
I don't need to take care of her.

474
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:55,500
You grew up in our family.

475
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,500
I really treat you as my son.

476
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,500
I want you to be my son.

477
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,500
Then,

478
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,500
I want everyone to look after you

479
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,500
and find a virtuous wife.

480
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:10,500
As long as you're in the family,

481
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,500
you're a good friend.

482
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,500
Father,

483
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:16,500
do you really don't want my son?

484
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:21,500
Although you changed your name to Liu Cheng Feng,

485
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,500
you're still my son.

486
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:33,500
Father,

487
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,500
thank you.

488
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:39,500
Father,

489
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:41,500
I should take the medicine.

490
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:45,500
Why did you take the medicine today?

491
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,500
To serve you.

492
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,500
I was born my son.

493
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,500
I should do it.

494
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:50,500
Since last time,

495
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,500
after I fell into the water and got a serious injury,

496
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:54,500
I've broken my heart.

497
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,500
Father also helped me

498
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,500
to recognize my ancestors.

499
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,500
I really feel very grateful.

500
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,500
Although I'm a famous doctor,

501
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:05,500
I'm still a good person.

502
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,500
I'm not afraid of anything.

503
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:09,500
I'm a son of the spirit.

504
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,500
But in my heart,

505
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:14,500
Father,

506
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,500
you're always my biological father.

507
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,500
So I should do all these things.

508
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:23,500
In the future,

509
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:25,500
I'll take good care of you.

510
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,500
You're sick and depressed.

511
00:25:28,500 --> 00:25:29,500
You have to take care of yourself

512
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,500
before you come back.

513
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,500
I'll ask Taozi to give you some more medicine

514
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,500
and some free prescription.

515
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:39,500
Thank you, Father.

516
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,500
Here,

517
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,500
take the medicine.

518
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:51,500
Be careful.

519
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:10,500
Li Ni,

520
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,500
Greetings, General.

521
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
Why are you looking for me?

522
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,500
Li Ni,

523
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,500
I want to discuss with you about Changzhou.

524
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:21,500
Changzhou is the Changzhou of my Cui family.

525
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:24,500
If you want to take back Changzhou,

526
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,500
why don't you fight with me?

527
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,500
You're right.

528
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:29,500
It's Li Ni's letter.

529
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:32,500
I'd like to ask Cui family to solve the problem of Changzhou.

530
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:34,500
Now that you're here,

531
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,500
Li Ni is here with the soldiers.

532
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,500
Li Ni is here with the soldiers.

533
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,500
But

534
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,500
I don't want to see you in the military.

535
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:48,500
Really?

536
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,500
General.

537
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,500
General.

538
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:04,500
General.

539
00:27:04,500 --> 00:27:05,500
General.

540
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,500
General.

541
00:27:22,500 --> 00:27:23,500
Don't let go of the thief.

542
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:25,500
He's the one who killed General.

543
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,500
Say it.

544
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,500
What on earth did you do

545
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,500
to kill our general?

546
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,500
I've said it.

547
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:31,500
I spoke to your general.

548
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,500
He suddenly burst into tears.

549
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
I rushed out to call someone.

550
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,500
I'm not in a hurry.

551
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Why do you still want to come out?

552
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,500
You know you can't escape.

553
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,500
That's why you didn't escape.

554
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,500
Come at me.

555
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,500
Don't let him escape.

556
00:27:55,500 --> 00:27:57,500
If father is in trouble,

557
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,500
then kill him.

558
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,500
General.

559
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,500
General.

560
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,500
How is he?

561
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,500
General.

562
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,500
General.

563
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,500
General.

564
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,500
General.

565
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:36,500
General.

566
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,500
Kill him.

567
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,500
I'll avenge my father.

568
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Go.

569
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,500
We haven't made it clear

570
00:28:58,500 --> 00:28:59,500
in this world.

571
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Are you a thief or someone else?

572
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,500
This person is not a murderer.

573
00:29:03,500 --> 00:29:05,500
Now you still want to protect him.

574
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:06,500
I'm not protecting him.

575
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,500
Father has been attacked.

576
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:10,500
You're just being confused.

577
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,500
The king of Qin won't harm general.

578
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,500
For Changzhou,

579
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,500
what's the point of this king?

580
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:18,500
This person is too stubborn.

581
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,500
If we don't kill him,

582
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,500
he will escape.

583
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,500
Shoot.

584
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,500
Stop.

585
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Let him go.

586
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,500
Let him go.

587
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,500
You're so right.

588
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:44,500
He Xiao Wei.

589
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,500
Are you going to rebel?

590
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:54,500
Let him go.

591
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,500
Let him go.

592
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:03,500
Let him go.

593
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:24,500
He's gone.

594
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
With his ability,

595
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:30,500
I might not be able to catch him.

596
00:30:33,500 --> 00:30:34,500
You still want to get the knife

597
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,500
and put it in my hand?

598
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,500
Guards.

599
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:52,500
Xiao Wei is being forced to be killed.

600
00:30:53,500 --> 00:30:54,500
He's going to be released.

601
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:56,500
Take him...

602
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,500
Take him to the water prison.

603
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,500
Master.

604
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,500
General is in danger.

605
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,500
If there's any punishment,

606
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,500
please remember it.

607
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,500
Let me take care of general first.

608
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,500
You know general is in danger.

609
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:13,500
Get down.

610
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,500
Take him away.

611
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,500
Master.

612
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:23,500
General is poisoned.

613
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:25,500
Xiao Wei.

614
00:31:25,500 --> 00:31:27,500
Xiao Wei is also a new level.

615
00:31:27,500 --> 00:31:28,500
Why don't you let him stay?

616
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:29,500
Shut up.

617
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,500
Master.

618
00:31:32,500 --> 00:31:33,500
Guards.

619
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Master.

620
00:31:35,500 --> 00:31:36,500
Take Tao Zi away and close it.

621
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:39,500
We'll find out later.

622
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:40,500
Master.

623
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,500
Master.

624
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,500
Master.

625
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:45,500
Master.

626
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,500
Where's Shi Qi Lang?

627
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:02,500
He's gone.

628
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,500
Where's he?

629
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
Xiao Wei is being forced to be killed.

630
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,500
He can't be saved.

631
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,500
Let's leave first.

632
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,500
Let's go.

633
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Master.

634
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:17,500
He Xiao Wei is here.

635
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,500
Yes.

636
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:20,500
Yes.

637
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:27,500
Ying.

638
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:29,500
You've suffered.

639
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,500
But today,

640
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:34,500
you're treating me like a man.

641
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:35,500
You're going to break my blood.

642
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,500
No matter what,

643
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:39,500
I must punish you.

644
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,500
You don't have to be so arrogant.

645
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:41,500
I'll punish you.

646
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,500
I'll punish you.

647
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,500
I'll punish you.

648
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,500
You don't have to be so arrogant.

649
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,500
You're just being jealous.

650
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:50,500
You just want to get rid of Li Ni.

651
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,500
Ying.

652
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Why do you trust Li Ni so much?

653
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,500
She's been trying to kill my father in Chang Zhou.

654
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:02,500
She's been trying to kill him.

655
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,500
Why don't you believe her?

656
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:05,500
What do you mean?

657
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:07,500
Why did you kill my father?

658
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,500
She's trying to get back Chang Zhou.

659
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,500
I've asked the people to investigate

660
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,500
the details of the camp.

661
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:17,500
But Li Ni's camp is the biggest.

662
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:18,500
You can't let her go

663
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
because of her.

664
00:33:28,500 --> 00:33:29,500
Ying.

665
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,500
Let's not talk about this, okay?

666
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
You haven't eaten yet.

667
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,500
Okay.

668
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,500
I ordered you to cook your favorite dish.

669
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,500
Eat some first.

670
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,500
I'm going to visit father.

671
00:33:48,500 --> 00:33:49,500
Ying.

672
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,500
I'll go with you

673
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:54,500
when you eat.

674
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,500
You're so considerate.

675
00:33:57,500 --> 00:33:59,500
You're always on time.

676
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:00,500
You're always on time.

677
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:03,500
If father knows,

678
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,500
he'll be worried, right?

679
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,500
Young Master.

680
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:20,500
You can leave now.

681
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Young Master.

682
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
He Xiao Wei is...

683
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,500
It's okay.

684
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:26,500
Xiao Wei is busy with his work.

685
00:34:27,500 --> 00:34:28,500
Now he's regretting

686
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:30,500
that he's wrong.

687
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:32,500
You can leave now.

688
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Yes.

689
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,500
Father.

690
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,500
No matter who caused you to be like this,

691
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:58,500
I'll find out the truth.

692
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:01,500
Take care.

693
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,500
Let me stay and take care of father.

694
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,500
No.

695
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,500
Ying.

696
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,500
Father came out of this.

697
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
We're all sad.

698
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,500
We're very alert.

699
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm afraid that there's someone who's against father.

700
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:31,500
That's why we decided to leave.

701
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,500
That's why we decided to leave.

702
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,500
Ying.

703
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
Go back to your room.

704
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:41,500
Sleep well.

705
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,500
Tomorrow morning,

706
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
I'll take you to visit father.

707
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,500
Are you going to talk?

708
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:51,500
Of course I'm going to.

709
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,580
F

710
00:36:14,500 --> 00:36:16,500
I think it's better we kill Chang Zhong in advance

711
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
and take General Cui Da out.

712
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:19,500
Then stop来了,

713
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:20,500
and tell those people

714
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:22,500
that you didn't get мет on General Cui Da.

715
00:36:22,500 --> 00:36:23,500
What nonsense is this?

716
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,500
If we really do like this,

717
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,500
we must settle down the Chang Zhou first.

718
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,500
Then if we do that,

719
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:29,500
we won't get words in the archery.

720
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:31,660
The army is definitely our enemy.

721
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,220
Shi Qi Lang.

722
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:35,860
Hao Zi.

723
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,020
Why are you here?

724
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:37,820
Where is your Xiao Wei?

725
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:38,500
How is he?

726
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,060
Xiao Wei is locked up.

727
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:41,500
The prince sent a heavy soldier to guard him.

728
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,140
He also wants to lock me up.

729
00:36:43,420 --> 00:36:44,020
I thought about it.

730
00:36:44,140 --> 00:36:44,820
I'll just get out of here

731
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:45,900
and come with Er Duo.

732
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,380
I thought I'd meet you first.

733
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:49,260
See if I can find out the truth.

734
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:51,060
Who did the General Cui harm?

735
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:53,620
Did he get hurt or poisoned?

736
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,420
He was poisoned by the poison.

737
00:36:55,860 --> 00:36:56,660
Poisoned what?

738
00:36:57,180 --> 00:36:58,060
He was busy.

739
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,340
He didn't know it.

740
00:36:59,500 --> 00:37:00,980
The prince sent someone to take me away.

741
00:37:09,820 --> 00:37:10,340
Ying.

742
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:12,660
Before father died,

743
00:37:13,420 --> 00:37:14,620
he asked me to talk to him.

744
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:17,140
He said he'd let me be a member of the tribe

745
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,420
and change the name Liu Cheng Feng.

746
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,260
He also said

747
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,300
I'm still his son.

748
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:25,860
Did father tell you about it?

749
00:37:29,860 --> 00:37:30,540
At first,

750
00:37:31,420 --> 00:37:32,740
father thought you were dead

751
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,820
and was sad.

752
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,820
But he told me

753
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:40,260
that he felt that

754
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,980
you've been calling Cui Lin's name

755
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:44,980
for so many years.

756
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:46,740
He also regretted it.

757
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,100
He didn't let you be his own son.

758
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:54,020
Father also mentioned it to me.

759
00:37:55,340 --> 00:37:56,300
He also said

760
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:59,380
that after I changed Liu Cheng Feng's identity,

761
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:02,460
I could beanks my mom and you.

762
00:38:05,740 --> 00:38:06,700
He also mentioned

763
00:38:07,860 --> 00:38:09,780
that if we could have a few children,

764
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:11,060
individuals

765
00:38:11,660 --> 00:38:14,780
and names were Liu Cheng Feng and others that would be Cui Lin.

766
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:17,020
Plus, more than two families

767
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,020
were in each other's family,

768
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:20,460
Ying.

769
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:23,380
Father also said this to us.

770
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:26,100
It's a pity

771
00:38:26,260 --> 00:38:27,820
that he hasn't considered all the Gandela plante

772
00:38:27,980 --> 00:38:29,460
and Lee Qian yet.

773
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,580
At Secondhandmışou Palace,

774
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:31,900
I couldn't find time for Guanyin.

775
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:35,060
Both her parents demanded...

776
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,460
Your Grace.

777
00:38:41,220 --> 00:38:43,060
Did Father really say so?

778
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:43,820
Of course.

779
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:55,020
Ying.

780
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:59,420
Let's both admit our FIRST relationship.

781
00:38:59,500 --> 00:39:03,500
No one in the army will dare to die.

782
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,500
And after we get married,

783
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,500
you can take care of father in a straightforward manner.

784
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,500
Father is not human now.

785
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:13,500
He won't worry about it anymore.

786
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:17,500
You want to marry me?

787
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:21,500
What if father gets better after he's happy?

788
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,500
Father is so arrangement.

789
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:27,500
Ying.

790
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:30,500
You don't want to?

791
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:31,500
I don't want to.

792
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,500
Father won't do such arrangement.

793
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:36,500
If you don't believe me,

794
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:39,500
you can ask him yourself

795
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,500
when father wakes up.

796
00:39:41,500 --> 00:39:42,500
I said it.

797
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,500
Father won't do such arrangement.

798
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,500
You've been worried about father's health lately.

799
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,500
You're so worried.

800
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:52,500
Don't worry.

801
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:55,500
I'll arrange our wedding.

802
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,500
You're the only one who needs to do it.

803
00:39:58,500 --> 00:40:00,500
You're waiting to be a bride.

804
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:15,500
Look at the position carefully.

805
00:40:15,500 --> 00:40:18,500
You can't let him step out of the door.

806
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,500
He's going to be a slave.

807
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,500
He's going to be a soldier.

808
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:27,500
I don't even want to see a warehouse.

809
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:28,500
Yes.

810
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,500
Yes.

811
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,500
Dear bride.

812
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,500
It's about time.

813
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:58,500
Let's get dressed.

814
00:40:58,500 --> 00:40:59,500
Where's Liu Chengfeng?

815
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,500
Ask him to come in.

816
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:02,500
Dear bride.

817
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:04,500
It's a big wedding.

818
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,500
You're going to marry Mr. Cui.

819
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,500
It's a blessing.

820
00:41:08,500 --> 00:41:10,500
Go and ask Mr. Cui.

821
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:11,500
I have something to ask him.

822
00:41:11,500 --> 00:41:12,500
Otherwise,

823
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:15,500
this marriage won't be successful.

824
00:41:15,500 --> 00:41:16,500
Dear bride.

825
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,500
Ask him to come in.

826
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,500
Yes.

827
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:26,500
Congratulations.

828
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:27,500
Congratulations.

829
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,500
Ying.

830
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:00,500
Why don't you dress up?

831
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:04,500
It's not good to be in a hurry.

832
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,500
It's you.

833
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:13,500
It's you, right?

834
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,500
What poison did you poison my father?

835
00:42:20,500 --> 00:42:21,500
I don't know.

836
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:23,500
I don't know.

837
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,500
What poison?

838
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,500
Look at you.

839
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,500
You're crazy.

840
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
How could you start talking nonsense?

841
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:38,500
I met you in Changzhou not long ago.

842
00:42:38,500 --> 00:42:40,500
Someone took you out to attract me.

843
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:41,500
But I just wanted to be a slave.

844
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:43,500
I didn't want to hurt my life.

845
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,500
I felt strange at that time.

846
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:48,500
You're the one who got hurt, right?

847
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:50,500
You're the one who killed me, right?

848
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:52,500
Ying.

849
00:42:52,500 --> 00:42:54,500
Don't talk nonsense.

850
00:42:56,500 --> 00:42:58,500
I've been waiting for this day

851
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,500
since I was a teenager.

852
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:05,500
Today is our wedding day.

853
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,500
You'll become my bride soon.

854
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:11,500
After we get married,

855
00:43:11,500 --> 00:43:13,500
I'll treat you well.

856
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,500
I'll kill Li Ni

857
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,500
and avenge my father.

858
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:21,500
I'll avenge my father.

859
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:23,500
Liu Chengfeng.

860
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,500
You can't fool me

861
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,500
because you can't fool anyone else.

862
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:36,500
You're the one who poisoned my father, right?

863
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,500
I've always treated you

864
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
as my own son.

865
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:43,500
I've always treated you

866
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:45,500
as my brother.

867
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:47,500
I've treated you as my brother.

868
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:50,500
How dare you

869
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
to do this to me?

870
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,500
Ying.

871
00:43:58,500 --> 00:43:59,500
Look.

872
00:44:00,500 --> 00:44:02,500
This is the hairpin I made for you.

873
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:05,500
I finally have a chance

874
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:08,500
to give it to you as a token of love.

875
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,500
Take it away.

876
00:44:11,500 --> 00:44:12,500
Ying.

877
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,500
Don't move.

878
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,500
I'm afraid I'll hurt you.

879
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:21,500
If you get hurt,

880
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:22,500
I'll know

881
00:44:26,500 --> 00:44:28,500
what he's doing.

882
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,500
How dare you threaten me?

883
00:44:32,500 --> 00:44:34,500
As long as you're nice to me,

884
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:36,500
I'll be happy.

885
00:44:37,500 --> 00:44:39,500
If I'm worried about you,

886
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,500
I'll be happy.

887
00:44:46,500 --> 00:44:47,500
If I'm worried about you,

888
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:52,500
I'll be happy.

889
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:55,500
If I'm worried about you,

890
00:44:59,500 --> 00:45:00,500
I'll be happy.

891
00:45:01,500 --> 00:45:02,500
Get lost!

892
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:07,500
When I come out,

893
00:45:08,500 --> 00:45:11,500
I'll witness our love.

894
00:45:17,500 --> 00:45:18,500
How dare you!

895
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,500
How dare you touch my father!

896
00:45:27,500 --> 00:45:28,500
Ying.

897
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:31,500
As long as you're nice to me,

898
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,500
I'll be happy.

899
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:37,500
Come.

900
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:41,500
I'm here.

901
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,500
Arrange the clothes for Xiao Wei.

902
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:47,500
When the time comes,

903
00:45:47,500 --> 00:45:49,500
take her to the washroom.

904
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:51,500
Yes.

905
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:08,500
Congratulations.

906
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:10,500
Today,

907
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:11,500
you'll be punished.

908
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:14,500
I'll take you to the washroom.

909
00:46:14,500 --> 00:46:16,500
Otherwise, you'll be locked up.

910
00:46:36,500 --> 00:46:37,500
Father.

911
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,500
Today is my wedding day with Ying.

912
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:46,500
Look at the guests in the yard.

913
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:48,500
They're here to congratulate us.

914
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:52,500
Father.

915
00:46:53,500 --> 00:46:54,500
Although you're still ill,

916
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,500
I still want you to get married.

917
00:46:58,500 --> 00:46:59,500
I'm not sure

918
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:02,500
if you'll be able to get married.

919
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:04,500
I'm not sure.

920
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:08,500
But I still want you to witness our marriage.

921
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:18,500
Father.

922
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:23,500
I've been your son for 20 years.

923
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:28,500
You've never promised me

924
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:30,500
to marry Ying.

925
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
So I can only

926
00:47:34,500 --> 00:47:36,500
rely on myself

927
00:47:37,500 --> 00:47:39,500
to make a wish.

928
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,500
Father.

929
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:46,500
I came out today

930
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,500
to let you see it yourself.

931
00:47:51,500 --> 00:47:52,500
Now,

932
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:55,500
Cui's family is mine.

933
00:47:57,500 --> 00:47:59,500
Your baby girl is mine too.

934
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:02,500
Father.

935
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:04,500
From now on,

936
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:07,500
I'll remember

937
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
your promise

938
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:12,500
and take care of your baby girl.

939
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,500
Uncle.

940
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:31,500
Father.

941
00:48:43,500 --> 00:48:44,500
Xiao Wei.

942
00:48:58,500 --> 00:48:59,500
Father.

943
00:49:00,500 --> 00:49:02,500
I'll celebrate this wine.

944
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:05,500
After this,

945
00:49:06,500 --> 00:49:08,500
I'll marry Ying.

946
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:10,500
I'll get married.

947
00:49:12,500 --> 00:49:13,500
Come.

948
00:49:31,500 --> 00:49:32,500
Go outside.

949
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:36,420
Father.

950
00:50:00,500 --> 00:50:02,500
I'm afraid I'll be late

951
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:04,500
I'm afraid I'll be late

952
00:50:04,500 --> 00:50:06,500
I'm afraid I'll be late
