Imagine,

28
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,160
I got chicken soup I went equipment and cream,

Well...

33
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,600
just an example for you.

34
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,080
Well,

35
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:55,400
I just saw the firecrackers

36
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,720
catch a single one.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,040
It's the same as stealing a bag.

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,600
It's the same as catching a single one.

39
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,320
The weapons are heavy.

40
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,120
You go and get it.

41
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,920
I'm taking the things from the 17-year-old.

42
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,200
The 17-year-old said

43
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,120
that the royal grandson is not the royal grandson.

44
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,560
Everyone has a father and a son.

45
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:11,800
There is a problem and a common cause.

46
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,800
What we eat,

47
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,960
he eats what?

48
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,680
Right?

49
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,920
Yes.

Still...

57
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,840
Don't be so calm.

58
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:17,840
Get down.

59
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,280
Get down.

60
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,160
Thanks, Bomb.

61
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,520
I sincerely send you behind bars!

62
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,680
Lord Xuan 351.

00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,080

00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,440
There must be a morgue festival

00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,320

66
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:50,440

68
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,080
was killed by the Sun Jing.

69
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,920
His Majesty has been killed.

70
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,920
These bandits attacked the imperial army.

71
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:03,520
They forced the princess to leave the city.

72
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,320
The Crown Prince has already died.

73
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,520
His Majesty's son, Royal Descendant of the Royal Descendant, Qian Yu Han,

74
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,920
was killed by the princess.

75
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:11,480
General Yichang, Han Chang,

76
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,720
protected the Crown Prince.

77
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,520
He killed a snowman and rushed out of the capital.

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,120
He was killed by the rebels outside the city.

79
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,480
Then, my father,

80
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:27,320
the King of Liang has been killed without an entrance.

81
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:31,920
He is now being suppressed by the rebels.

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,720
Your Highness, the King of Chu has left the country.

83
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,320
Now, he is only the crown prince of the King of Liang.

84
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,760
Chen Yu and Zhen Xi have already decided to

85
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,720
follow the King of Liang as the king.

86
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,320
They will worship you as the Crown Prince.

87
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:47,320
They have called the King of Qin to the world.

88
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,920
Please allow me to explain.

89
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,120
General Pei, I can't agree to your request.

90
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,520
Your Highness!

91
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:04,320
The Sun is not clear.

92
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Maybe he is still alive.

93
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,320
His Majesty is in a bad state.

94
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,320
He should have forced the Crown Prince to leave.

95
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,320
Even if the Crown Prince is alive now,

96
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,920
you are just a 78-year-old child.

97
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,720
He is just the crown prince's eldest son.

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,520
He didn't have any good intentions.

99
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:20,120
Now, the Wolf's Eye has been

100
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,920
exposed to the crown prince of the King of Chu.

101
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,520
How can he let a fool like him

102
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,920
lie to our Princess?

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,520
General Pei, the Crown Prince is smart.

104
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,320
He is a good man.

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:38,120
Kang Xuan, my father is in the hands of the Sun.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,320
If you let me see him,

107
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:43,920
would you be able to see my father?

108
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:47,520
Your Highness!

109
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
The 17th Royal Descendant of the Emperor,

110
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,320
led the West Army from the south of the Lan State

111
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:03,520
to the west of the capital,

112
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,320
to rescue the King of Liang.

113
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,320
He is a great man.

114
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,320
Meanwhile, General Ping Liang,

115
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,720
ordered to lead the troops alone.

116
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,920
He led the West Army from the west of the capital,

117
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:16,720
to rescue the King of Xi.

118
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,520
He killed the Sun and the world.

119
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,520
The two armies met on the way.

120
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,920
Let's see who can win the game.

121
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:27,120
Ping Ding, inside.

122
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,720
The King of Chu,

123
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,120
led the West Army from the south of the capital,

124
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,120
to rescue the King of Xi.

125
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,120
The King of Chu,

126
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,120
led the West Army from the west of the capital,

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,120
to rescue the King of Xi.

128
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,120
The King of Chu,

129
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,120
led the West Army from the west of the capital,

130
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:01,120
to rescue the King of Xi.

131
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
The King of Chu,

132
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,120
led the West Army from the west of the capital,

133
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,120
to rescue the King of Xi.

134
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,120
The King of Chu,

135
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,120
led the West Army from the west of the capital,

136
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,120
to rescue the King of Chu.

137
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,720
Your father Federation gives you a disruptive behavior.

138
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
Is it OK?

139
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,320
You are the best ram!

140
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:31,520
the most powerfulける.

141
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,920
17b deers!

142
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,360
Is it you,

143
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,120
Guardsman Besides?

144
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,320
Peiyuan,

145
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,720
you must have a lot of funniest jokes.

146
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,120
Since I went out to pin a birch,

147
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,520
it seemed like

148
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,840
I was caught by someone.

149
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:45,560
You're the general of the whole army now.

150
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,160
My father is afraid you'll be in danger.

151
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,960
Yes.

152
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,280
Now he wants to go back to the capital

153
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,760
and kill the traitor Sun Jing.

154
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,040
He'll go back to the King's palace and take back the imperial grandson.

155
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
He'll only take back the imperial dynasty.

156
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,760
Good.

157
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,240
What about then?

158
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:02,640
Then of course,

159
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,800
Xiao Yao went back to the Lan State.

160
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:05,760
She didn't have a war.

161
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:07,520
It's not good to fight the Yellow Lamb.

162
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:08,800
I knew it.

163
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,400
You want to go back to the Lan State.

164
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,280
The Lan State is so good.

165
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,280
Doesn't the Yellow Lamb smell like the old treasure?

166
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,920
Think about it.

167
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,080
You're hungry.

168
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:20,880
I'm hungry.

169
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:23,400
I'm really hungry.

170
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:24,680
Shi Qi Lang.

171
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,200
Now the whole army is hungry.

172
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,160
Our business is only going to be good.

173
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,480
If we don't have any food now,

174
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
let alone the capital,

175
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:37,200
our army will starve to death.

176
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,040
So no matter what,

177
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,520
we must catch the guy who killed the traitor Sun Jing.

178
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,600
We must catch him and kill him for Sun Jing.

179
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,240
Xiao Wei,

180
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,200
we're ready.

181
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,560
Let's go to the traitor Sun Jing.

182
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:03,880
Let's go.

183
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,280
Forever.

184
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
Nan Yu.

185
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:30,120
Crap.

186
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,160
Blood corpses are coming out.

187
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,040
I'll go to catch her.

188
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,520
Tell Pei Yu

189
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:35,760
to have them eye...,

190
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,600
harvest them with pebbles.

191
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,400
Good!

192
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:44,400
Good!

193
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,400
Good!

194
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,400
Good!

195
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:54,400
Miss Yue, your skin is so good.

196
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:56,400
Let go of me, Miss Yue.

197
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Let go of me.

198
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,400
Miss Yue, your hands are so bad.

199
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
Let go of me.

200
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
You're bad.

201
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I'll ask Miss Yue to drink.

202
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
I'll ask you to drink.

203
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
Gu Gui Ke.

204
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,400
Miss Yue, only talk about food.

205
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:07,400
Only talk about food? I'll talk about you.

206
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,400
Don't, don't.

207
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,400
Gu Gui Ke.

208
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,400
What's wrong, Miss Yue?

209
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
What's wrong?

210
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
Get up.

211
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:35,400
Why is Yue still not back?

212
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:44,400
This song should be sung by Heaven.

213
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:47,400
How many times can people get the lyrics?

214
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:52,400
Yue, I don't want to listen to you sing a song.

215
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,400
I want to sing it here.

216
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,400
I want to give this to Yue.

217
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,400
I'll give it to you.

218
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,400
You won't like it.

219
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:11,400
It makes sense.

220
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:16,400
Yue, you'll like it.

221
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Yue, Yue is here.

222
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Yue, what's wrong?

223
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,400
Are you mad?

224
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Yue, what's wrong?

225
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,400
What happened?

226
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,400
What's wrong?

227
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,400
Gui Ke, please stay.

228
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:04,400
The guests are listening to me.

229
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
If you need anything,

230
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,400
you can ask me directly.

231
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
What about the lyrics?

232
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
The lyrics...

233
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,400
They're all Gui Ke.

234
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,400
But you need to ask others.

235
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,400
I can't tell you.

236
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:23,400
We're General Guo Zhi's men.

237
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
No matter what,

238
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:26,400
we can do whatever we want.

239
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:31,400
What's Yue's faraway place?

240
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,400
This is the place I've been looking for you.

241
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,400
Look, it's beautiful.

242
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,400
It's a home.

243
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,400
This is okay.

244
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
It's been a long time.

245
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,400
I've been looking for you.

246
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:53,400
What did you do?

247
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:55,400
You let yourself in.

248
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:57,400
You won't answer your questions.

249
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,400
It's okay.

250
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:00,400
It's none of your business.

251
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
You're here all the time.

252
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:06,400
Don't be angry.

253
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Next time,

254
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,400
we'll be together.

255
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Okay?

256
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,400
I'm fine.

257
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,400
Yue, you're hiding in the house.

258
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:25,400
You're even hiding in the house?

259
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,400
Don't misunderstand.

260
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,400
We're here to get the chicken.

261
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
Please excuse us.

262
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,400
We're not late.

263
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,400
Get out of my house.

264
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,400
Yes.

265
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,400
The chicken is here.

266
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,400
It's a long way.

267
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:44,400
Yes.

268
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,400
I'm wrong.

269
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,400
Get up.

270
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
Get up.

271
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
Get up.

272
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
Don't follow me.

273
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:50,400
Get up.

274
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,400
How dare you run away?

275
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,400
Get up.

276
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,400
Yes.

277
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:55,400
Do you know who I am?

278
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:56,400
Let me go.

279
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,400
Let go of my hand.

280
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
OK.

281
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
Who are you?

282
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,340
come!

283
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,020
This is a whaty duck dance.

284
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:54,500
Why do you置p a woman?

285
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:56,740
Who say I'm a woman?

286
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,400
Add Discovering

287
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,560
Tell everyone

288
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,220
that there is your friend

289
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:12,220
that you love

290
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:13,920

291
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,620
on your command

292
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:18,960
Be my guest

293
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,820
If so, welcome

294
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,640
I will rule the world

295
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,840
Thanks

296
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,100
Say it

297
00:16:30,020 --> 00:16:30,660
What have you made of it?

298
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:33,900
Are you dead?

299
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:39,680
Really dead?

300
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,160
It's not true.

301
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:44,820
quandé you when their father asks you,

302
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:45,780
never lie to other brothers

303
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:46,740
you provoking,

304
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,780
you drugging people to say,

305
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,000

306
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:51,900
me or your daughter

307
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:55,220
curtain seventeenth

308
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:55,960
can obviously not be

309
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:56,680
reconciled

310
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,540
Here kidding

311
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,540
Han!

312
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,340
Xiao Guan?

313
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,760
Sister.

314
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,060
What do you think of it?

315
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,420
Sooner or later...

316
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:52,540
all the

317
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:58,080
Bi engages us right now.

318
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,300
Jing,

319
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,520
When you were in this world,

320
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:05,000
you were the one

321
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:09,480
who told me that

322
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,120
you were afraid when I'm in such a high school.

323
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:15,320
That's because

324
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,640
Qian Feng always

325
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:26,560
reached this total

326
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:31,440
Now he's slash you in the

327
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,620
weight gain?

328
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:36,200
Deadlock dudao even his sword skill

329
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,400
is realised as when개

330
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:53,040
make a newu

331
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,040
theuel

332
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,760
is the enemy of Pei's family.

333
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,360
cambagia

334
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,300
Sang.

335
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,380
Who is the enemy?

336
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,280
So smart.

337
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:28,480
Is it the smell of Sun Jing?

338
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:29,360
No.

339
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:30,920
It's not Sun Jing's smell.

340
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:32,400
It's not the soldier of Guo Zhi.

341
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:33,720
It's the Cui family.

342
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:34,880
The Cui family's people.

343
00:19:35,880 --> 00:19:36,880
The Cui family's people?

344
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,560
The Cui family is well-behaved.

345
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,440
How could they be here?

346
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,840
Sun Jing is up against the Demonic Army.

347
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:45,000
The Cui family

348
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,000
has left Yingzhou and became the King of Qin.

349
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,640
Now that the world is in chaos,

350
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,560
they will have another plan.

351
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:52,760
The Cui family

352
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,080
has been fighting for the King of Qin

353
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:55,400
for many years

354
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:56,440
and has been fighting for many years.

355
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,680
Now, except for the Demonic Army

356
00:19:58,840 --> 00:19:59,760
and Sun Jing's soldiers,

357
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,400
the Cui family

358
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,520
is the most powerful.

359
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:03,920
I didn't expect that

360
00:20:03,920 --> 00:20:05,520
the Cui family's people are so strong.

361
00:20:05,680 --> 00:20:06,920
They are going to the capital so soon.

362
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,120
Shi Qi Lang,

363
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,760
they are like us.

364
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:13,080
They are all in the front.

365
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:15,160
If not for the sake of...

366
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:15,680
No.

367
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,960
The Cui family's army's name is

368
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,240
the King of Qin, Feng Zhi.

369
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:21,440
Since it's the King of Qin,

370
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,400
we have to take the advantage of it.

371
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:24,840
Let's see

372
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,560
what Shen Fu can do.

373
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
The Heavens support him.

374
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,520
The adults are upset

375
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:36,880
but the 9997感謝 helps him

376
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,560
的話men warmly make a name�

377
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:41,000
and embrace this welcome.

378
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:46,640
Inlinessor,

379
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:47,760
prepare the meal.

380
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:50,920
Unfortunately,

381
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,840
I couldn't arrest that stare in Rui Ling.

382
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,400
Xiao Wei is indeed a good person.

383
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:00,400
I knew that the army of Zhenxi would be defeated by the Pisi Wolf.

384
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:04,400
But I didn't expect that the people of the army of Zhenxi would come so soon.

385
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:10,400
The general of the army of Zhenxi was defeated by a so-called royal grandson.

386
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,400
He ordered the soldiers to be the king of the horse.

387
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,400
I think the one who defeated the army of Pei was the prince who used the royal grandson to be the emperor.

388
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:20,400
He ordered the people to be the king of the horse.

389
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,400
The people of Pei County were the same age as the general of the army of Zhenxi.

390
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:26,400
He ran away. He was a coward.

391
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,400
There is no grain. No matter how well Pei County is equipped,

392
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,400
the army of Zhenxi is also a man of the village.

393
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,400
The Cui family is fighting with us now.

394
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,400
They have planned well and have been brought to the corner.

395
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,400
What should we do now?

396
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Right, Shi Qi Wolf, when we left,

397
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
the Pisi Wolf was taken away by the people of Guozhi.

398
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,400
The Pisi Wolf is not just thinking of going to the temple.

399
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
We can help him.

400
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,400
Tomorrow, we will show you a big show.

401
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Xiao Wei, what do we do next?

402
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:03,400
I think the person who knows the way is a good use.

403
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:26,400
Someone from the torture community comes.

404
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:41,400
Don't stand in the way.

405
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:43,400
If you're going to do something stupid,

406
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:46,400
you'll keep the rest on you wholeheartedly.

407
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,400
Xiao Wei,

408
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,800
Is there any news from the Grand Sun?

409
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,200
It's not that, Xiao Wei.

410
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,080
If it is,

411
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,240
you will be able to make another plan on the new wind.

412
00:22:56,160 --> 00:22:57,240
In the hands of the family,

413
00:22:57,240 --> 00:22:58,760
we must find the Grand Sun as soon as possible.

414
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,560
We must not let anyone else take the risk.

415
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,600
Only by finding the Grand Sun as soon as possible,

416
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,680
we, the Cui family,

417
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,640
can have the right to be the famous fan.

418
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,920
By then,

419
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,360
Pei County will be a joke

420
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,720
if we find that bastard, Royal Descendant, Li Ni.

421
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,000
Yes.

422
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,600
I said that when I was in Yingzhou,

423
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,040
Li clan was in a state of displeasure,

424
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,160
and the aura was already so strong.

425
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,760
Sooner or later, we will lose this country.

426
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,840
Li clan's Grand Sun

427
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:22,160
will only be a dog and a dog.

428
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,360
After being alone,

429
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,320
no one can be the main person.

430
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:28,240
That's why Xiao Wei decided to

431
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,480
let the general and the Prince

432
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,680
take the army to the camp.

433
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,920
They are really in this world.

434
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:36,360
We have no other choice.

435
00:23:36,800 --> 00:23:38,360
If we want to make peace in the world,

436
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,760
and make the people feel better,

437
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,360
we can only rely on the Cui family.

438
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,960
The map of the Wanzhou.

439
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,680
Where is the sea?

440
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,240
If we take down the city of Wanzhou,

441
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,440
half the problem of the cold grass can be solved.

442
00:23:58,040 --> 00:23:59,160
Don't be so reckless.

443
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,160
Get some rest.

444
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,000
I've already arranged the speed of the outside.

445
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:03,360
How about this?

446
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,360
I'll be the first to come to the house in the middle of the night.

447
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:07,360
I'll be the first to come to the house in the middle of the night.

448
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,600
Forget it.

449
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:09,960
Erdu, you're still injured.

450
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:10,960
I'll be the first to come.

451
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,360
Shi Qi Lang,

452
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,920
I'll sleep with you

453
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:15,560
if you don't come at night.

454
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:16,560
Forget it.

455
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:17,560
Your stinky foot

456
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,160
won't get washed.

457
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,160
I'll sleep with you.

458
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,160
I'll be the first to come.

459
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,960
You're the only one who's got the most.

460
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,360
You're still washing your feet.

461
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:25,560
Erdu, you're not done yet.

462
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,560
You're not done yet.

463
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
Come out.

464
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,560
Don't think I didn't see you.

465
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:18,560
Don't think I didn't see you.

466
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,560
You're the one again.

467
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,560
Give it back to me.

468
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:21,960
Give it back to me.

469
00:26:22,560 --> 00:26:23,560
What's that?

470
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,160
What do you think it is?

471
00:26:30,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Where's my bracelet?

472
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:32,560
Give it back to me.

473
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:42,560
You're such a woman.

474
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,560
You're so cruel.

475
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:49,560
Wait.

476
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:52,560
Qing Pei,

477
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,560
I know the whereabouts of Taicun.

478
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,560
How did you know?

479
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Are you Qing Cui?

480
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Why should I tell you?

481
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:24,560
Where's he?

482
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,560
Why haven't you come back

483
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
after washing your feet?

484
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:36,560
Shi Qi Lang.

485
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:39,560
Shi Qi Lang.

486
00:27:39,560 --> 00:27:40,560
Boss.

487
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:41,560
I'm here.

488
00:27:43,560 --> 00:27:44,560
Boss.

489
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:45,560
I'm here.

490
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:46,560
Why did you fall into the well?

491
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,560
I'll get you there right away.

492
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
Wait a minute.

493
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:00,560
Are you okay, Shi Qi Lang?

494
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:02,560
I said you should wash your feet.

495
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:04,560
How did you get into the well?

496
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,560
I just wanted to catch a cat.

497
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:10,560
But he got caught.

498
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,560
The doctor's team went in.

499
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,560
I'm sorry.

500
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:13,560
I'm sorry.

501
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
The doctor's team went in.

502
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,560
That wild man.

503
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,560
You're his only child.

504
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,560
Yes.

505
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,560
He's a wild man.

506
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
And he's a coward.

507
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
A coward?

508
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:26,560
I'll change my clothes.

509
00:28:26,560 --> 00:28:27,560
Okay.

510
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:39,560
A Yu.

511
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,560
I brought you something good.

512
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,560
A Yu.

513
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,560
The buns from Dehua House

514
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:47,560
are still hot.

515
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
I just went to buy them.

516
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,560
Are you sure?

517
00:28:52,560 --> 00:28:54,560
And the golden cinnamon.

518
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,560
It's good for your stomach.

519
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,560
It's good for your fruit tea.

520
00:28:56,560 --> 00:28:57,560
Fruit tea?

521
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,560
A Yu.

522
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,560
You don't know.

523
00:29:00,560 --> 00:29:02,560
I ran out of it so easily.

524
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:04,560
Just for this.

525
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,560
If you didn't buy

526
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
the little laugh by General Guo,

527
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:08,560
I wouldn't have...

528
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:09,560
You used the trick.

529
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,560
A Yu.

530
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,560
You asked me

531
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
if I used the trick.

532
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,560
A Yu.

533
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
You're caring about me.

534
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
Why don't we use it together?

535
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:22,560
Just make some fruit tea.

536
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:24,560
Okay.

537
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:40,560
What are you doing?

538
00:29:40,560 --> 00:29:41,560
Don't refuse.

539
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
Where's our Fourth Lord?

540
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:46,560
Where did you hide him?

541
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,560
Take him out.

542
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,560
Hurry up.

543
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:58,560
They all said that

544
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
the skin of the Third Mother Qu

545
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:00,560
is good.

546
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:01,560
But I heard

547
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
that it's not as good as your score.

548
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:04,560
You little...

549
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,560
It's not good.

550
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,560
There are a bunch of

551
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:07,560
evil men coming out.

552
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
They said that the skin was sent by the woman.

553
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
They said that the dead are looking for the dead skin.

554
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:14,560
The...

555
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:15,560
The Mother Qu

556
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
has sent people to come here.

557
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:21,560
Wait a minute.

558
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
It's not easy for you to be found out like this.

559
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
You can change your clothes

560
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
and do something else.

561
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:39,560
Who are you?

562
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:40,560
Who asked you to punish me?

563
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:41,560
Did the Mother Qu

564
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,560
send you here?

565
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Let go of me.

569
00:30:46,560 --> 00:30:47,560

Earth YouTube, Earth Channel.

00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,200
I have a match.

609
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,400
The national team has taught me to borrow two matches.

610
00:32:11,640 --> 00:32:13,200
I don't dare to bully Mrs. Wan.

611
00:32:13,400 --> 00:32:15,520
I'm really going to the court.

612
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Where's the match?

613
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,240
In the corner of the waist.

614
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,520
In the corner of the waist.

615
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,360
No.

616
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:27,600
No way.

617
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,000
No way.

618
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,640
It's in the corner.

619
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,560
No.

620
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:32,880
There's no match at all.

621
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:33,400
No.

622
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,400
Did you lie to me?

623
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:35,440
I did.

624
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:36,440
I didn't lie to you.

625
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,560
I really want it.

626
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,760
I don't know where the match is.

627
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:57,800
Master,

628
00:32:58,320 --> 00:32:59,240
are you happy?

629
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,080
I promised you

630
00:33:04,680 --> 00:33:05,840
to be angry with me.

631
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:09,760
That's what makes you a sure winner.

632
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:10,960
Master.

633
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,000
What's so funny about the match?

634
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,540
The mend's bossб

635
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:19,260
It seems that

636
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:20,920
we checked the match file.

637
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,160
It looks something wrong with the evidence board.

638
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,400
I didn't know what's wrong?

639
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,600
Spread some words.

640
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:29,280
I didn't expect

641
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,760
to destroy the bride

642
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,840
because of this.

643
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:32,480
It does not matter.

644
00:33:33,240 --> 00:33:34,880
Theogenous is in our hands now,

645
00:33:35,000 --> 00:33:35,920
and we have someone

646
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,080

What?

653
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,180
If I was per By force,

654
00:33:49,260 --> 00:33:50,380

659
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,460

What do we do now?

676
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,100
We can't let him

678
00:34:27,820 --> 00:34:28,980

Xiao Wei, what should we do?

742
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,760
The enemy is chasing us.

743
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:35,760
We have two soldiers.

744
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,880
They don't want us to lose our enemy.

745
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,080
We'll wait for them to open the gate.

746
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,800
Then we'll wait for them to open the gate.

747
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:45,560
Then we can talk to them.

748
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:48,600
Let's go.

749
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:02,520
Xiao Wei, it's time to make a decision.

750
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,360
Otherwise, Guo Ji will kill us.

751
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:18,760
Go.

752
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:32,640
Xiao Wei, the army is here.

It's our commander's army.

00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:39,280
It's Mr. Que.

755
00:38:39,600 --> 00:38:41,000
It's Mr. Que who's still chasing us.

756
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:42,880
Let's go.

757
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:47,000
If I can't remember the past

758
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:54,000
I'm still missing the moment when I was drunk

759
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,000
The warmth of all the past

760
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:04,000
I want to stay for you

761
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:10,000
If I can't remember the past

762
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:17,000
I want to live for you from now on

763
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:22,000
The warmth of all the past

764
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:30,000
Wait for my words

765
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:37,000
If I can't remember the past

766
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:41,000
I'll wait for the moment when I was drunk

767
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:45,000
I'll love you for you

768
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:49,000
I'll live for you from now on

769
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:54,000
I'll wait for your memories

770
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:00,000
If I can't remember the past

771
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:07,000
I'll wait for your memories

772
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:12,000
I'll wait for your memories

773
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:20,000
If I can't remember the past
