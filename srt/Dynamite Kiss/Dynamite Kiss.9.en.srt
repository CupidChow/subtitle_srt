EPISODE 9

3
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:54,929
Ma'am, you look so beautiful today.

4
00:00:56,222 --> 00:00:58,600
You must be delighted
about your son's engagement.

5
00:01:02,604 --> 00:01:03,521
Excuse me for a second.

6
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,404
It's what he wanted.

7
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,657
In exchange for marrying
into Chairman Yu's family, I divorce you.

8
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:18,328
When a parent falls apart,

9
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:21,414
the child's whole world crumbles.

10
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:25,001
We have to become braver

11
00:01:25,085 --> 00:01:26,836
and happier

12
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:28,963
for our children's sake.

CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT

17
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:10,839
Dad, what are you doing?
We should hurry up.

18
00:02:11,422 --> 00:02:12,382
Right. Let's go.

19
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:26,938
Where is she?

20
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:28,606
She'll be arriving shortly.

21
00:02:29,357 --> 00:02:31,192
She's just unbelievable.

22
00:02:34,612 --> 00:02:36,573
Hey, I'm almost there.

23
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:39,159
Oh, you're there? Okay.

24
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,076
See you.

25
00:02:49,711 --> 00:02:52,589
We'll be starting in five minutes.
You can make your way to the hall now.

26
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,024
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

27
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:13,484
-Jun, there you are!
-Auntie!

28
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:14,944
-Hey!
-There you are.

29
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:17,864
Auntie!

30
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,574
"Auntie"?

31
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,534
Be quiet. You scared me!

32
00:03:21,618 --> 00:03:24,078
-Should we check out that place later?
-Yes.

33
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,543
Go Da-rim, Kim Seon-u!

34
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,503
-Oh, hey.
-Hey.

35
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:34,714
-Hello.
-Hello.

36
00:03:34,797 --> 00:03:37,634
Jeez, you guys are still attached
at the hip.

37
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,344
-Are you still living in the same place?
-Yeah.

38
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:41,429
You might as well get married

39
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,056
and receive the government housing benefit
for newlyweds.

40
00:03:43,139 --> 00:03:46,017
Hey, we're like brother and sister.

41
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,310
Right, and you're the brother.

42
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,228
Why you little…

43
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:49,854
-Let's go.
-Okay.

44
00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:51,397
-My goodness.
-Jun, let's go.

45
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:53,358
Jun, did you say hi to him?

46
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:54,692
Have you been well, Jun?

47
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,277
-Or you'll get scolded.
-You're a big boy now.

48
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:58,321
Technically, I don't have a boyfriend.

49
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,365
I have a husband.

50
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:03,493
You'd know better than me
what moms would like.

51
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:05,453
Right, of course, I do know.

52
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:06,955
I do, but…

53
00:04:07,997 --> 00:04:09,832
It sounds like
you've never raised a child.

54
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:10,917
Da-rim.

55
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,877
You've never raised a kid, have you?

56
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:17,298
Ji-hyeok.

57
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:22,345
Mom.

58
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,725
Sorry, I'm a bit late.

59
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,394
Were you waiting for me?

60
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,146
Very much so.

61
00:04:33,273 --> 00:04:35,942
You're the most special person in my life.

62
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:38,152
Let's go inside.

63
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,620
Let's welcome the stars of today's event.

64
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:51,207
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok, the groom-to-be,
and Ms. Yu Ha-yeong, the bride-to-be.

65
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:54,043
Friends and family, please welcome them
with a warm round of applause.

66
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:09,726
Smile.

67
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:28,911
We'll now proceed with exchanging rings

68
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:32,248
to signify the couple's vow
for their future together,

69
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,583
followed by a photo montage

70
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,085
that tells the story
of how this couple came to be.

71
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,047
Please send them a warm round of applause.

72
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:56,314
ENGAGEMENT CEREMONY VIDEO

73
00:06:42,944 --> 00:06:43,820
Mr. Gong.

74
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:47,198
Mr. Gong?

75
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:52,954
It seems our groom-to-be is quite nervous.

76
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:55,832
Why don't we cheer him on
with another warm round of applause?

77
00:07:17,645 --> 00:07:18,604
Just wait and see.

78
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:21,774
I'm going to turn this place
upside down today.

79
00:07:24,986 --> 00:07:27,905
Everyone, I have something to say.

80
00:07:31,367 --> 00:07:33,327
The truth is, I…

81
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,127
Oh dear.

82
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:45,590
Ma'am!

83
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:46,841
Mom!

84
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:48,134
Mom!

85
00:07:48,217 --> 00:07:49,802
-Gyeong-min, bring the car around. Hurry.
-Right, okay.

86
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:52,054
Mom.

87
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:53,306
Mom!

88
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:56,350
Please wake up. Mom!

89
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:57,977
Mom.

90
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,813
Mom…

91
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:02,857
Mom.

92
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,650
Please wake up.

93
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:05,860
Please.

94
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,570
Gyeong-min, step on it.

95
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:08,654
Okay.

96
00:08:10,031 --> 00:08:11,449
You can slow down.

97
00:08:12,074 --> 00:08:13,868
You should drive safely.

98
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,590
Mom.

99
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,008
Are you okay?

100
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:30,885
I'm totally fine.

101
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,387
What are you talking about?
You just collapsed.

102
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:37,141
That was all an act

103
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:39,185
to stop the engagement ceremony.

104
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:46,400
Gosh, it seems like I got you good.

105
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,158
She's been nothing but trouble
my whole life.

106
00:08:54,242 --> 00:08:55,368
Why today, of all days?

107
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:56,869
Are you sure

108
00:08:57,662 --> 00:08:59,330
you don't want to head to the hospital?

109
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:01,040
This is nothing new.

110
00:09:01,707 --> 00:09:02,917
She'll recover if it's nothing serious.

111
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:06,546
We can reschedule the engagement ceremony

112
00:09:06,629 --> 00:09:07,964
based on her recovery.

113
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:09,507
No need.

114
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:12,009
-Let's just proceed with the wedding.
-What?

115
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:16,973
Wouldn't that be rushing it too much?

116
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,266
It'll be tight if we want it to coincide

117
00:09:18,349 --> 00:09:20,560
with our new product launch
and overseas expansion.

118
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:21,936
Save time where you can.

119
00:09:33,948 --> 00:09:34,907
Welcome.

120
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,438
Mom.

121
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,648
If you challenge that man,
he won't stop until he wins.

122
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,400
If I just get married--

123
00:10:09,483 --> 00:10:10,901
This isn't just for your sake.

124
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:12,737
It's also for mine.

125
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,697
It's a little late,

126
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,824
but I want to start living my life now.

127
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,329
For that to happen, shouldn't I reclaim
what's mine on my own first?

128
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:25,082
That's why I hired them.

129
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,835
They're quite renowned in their field.

CHEON JI-HUN LAW OFFICE
ATTORNEY CHEON JI-HUN

131
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,259
RETAINER FEE: 500 WON

132
00:10:36,052 --> 00:10:39,096
Normally, my retainer fee is 1,000 won,

133
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,933
but as you know,
this case is on a slightly grander scale,

134
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:44,852
so I decided to work with Ma-ri this time.

135
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,188
Hence, we're splitting
the retainer fee exactly in half.

136
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:50,191
Exactly 500 won each.
Not a single won more.

137
00:10:50,274 --> 00:10:51,192
Half?

138
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:52,109
-Yes.
-Yes.

139
00:10:53,361 --> 00:10:57,531
Due to Ms. Kim In-ae's recurrent
depressive and anxiety disorders,

140
00:10:57,615 --> 00:11:00,117
Mr. Gong Chang-ho has been managing
all of Ms. Kim's assets,

141
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,452
including her company shares.

142
00:11:01,535 --> 00:11:02,745
That's correct.

143
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,373
We intend to ensure
that she regains control of her assets

144
00:11:05,456 --> 00:11:08,042
and facilitate her return
to the company's management.

145
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:10,961
Natural BeBe is a company Ms. Kim
had a hand in building from the ground up.

146
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,381
She deserves to reclaim
what's rightfully hers, doesn't she?

147
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:14,840
Right, Trainee Baek?

148
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:16,384
I'm an attorney.

149
00:11:17,259 --> 00:11:18,427
-Attorney Cheon.
-Yeah?

150
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:22,348
Why do you keep calling me that
when I've been done training ages ago?

151
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,891
I'm sorry, Trainee--

152
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:25,726
I mean, Ms. Baek.

153
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,188
It's just that "Trainee Baek"
rolls off the tongue.

154
00:11:29,271 --> 00:11:31,732
Is there anything I can do to help?

155
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,403
Gathering evidence of the things
Ms. Kim has been subjected to thus far,

156
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:38,072
as well as the evidence required
to claim her management rights,

157
00:11:38,155 --> 00:11:39,698
will take some time.

158
00:11:39,782 --> 00:11:42,910
Until then, you should act
as if nothing is happening

159
00:11:42,993 --> 00:11:46,080
and maintain the current state of affairs.

160
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:50,209
That way, we can access
the company records without interference.

161
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:53,295
At the very least,
we can't let anyone suspect a thing

162
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,713
until we can prove

163
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,549
that I'm of sound mind.

164
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,717
If he catches on before then,

165
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:02,263
he'll throw me into a psych ward
just to stop me.

166
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:04,557
Yes, I also believe

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,309
Mr. Gong is more than capable
of doing such a thing.

168
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:09,520
However, such a thing will never happen.

169
00:12:09,603 --> 00:12:10,438
Why?

170
00:12:10,521 --> 00:12:11,439
Because

171
00:12:12,189 --> 00:12:13,983
I'm the attorney on the case.

172
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:17,153
No matter what happens,

173
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:19,572
we'll be sure to protect our clients.

174
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,504
Trainee Baek, shall we go strategize now?

175
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,381
Shall we?

176
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,924
Let's go.

177
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:41,051
Let's go do this thing.

178
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,435
Pottery?

179
00:12:49,518 --> 00:12:50,394
You think so?

180
00:12:50,895 --> 00:12:53,063
It's a bit too light to be pottery.

181
00:12:53,981 --> 00:12:55,858
-Glass!
-Glass?

182
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:56,859
Could it be glass?

183
00:12:57,902 --> 00:13:00,905
GONG JI-HYEOK & YU HA-YEONG
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR ENGAGEMENT

184
00:13:06,368 --> 00:13:07,661
Auntie!

185
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,787
Hurry up.

186
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,080
Yeah, I'm coming.

187
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,208
I'm coming.

188
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,667
Let's go, Jun.

189
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,087
Come on. Give me your hand.

190
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:18,756
Let's go.

191
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:25,346
Are you sure about this?

192
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:31,435
I'm just really afraid you'll get hurt

193
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,521
and go through a hard time again.

194
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:38,359
Don't worry.

195
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:39,777
I'm going to

196
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:41,695
make it happen.

197
00:13:42,947 --> 00:13:46,575
So don't worry about anything else.

198
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,870
Just focus on yourself

199
00:13:50,704 --> 00:13:52,623
and follow your heart.

200
00:13:54,124 --> 00:13:55,251
Got it?

201
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,729
Don't worry about anything else.

202
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,399
Just focus on yourself

203
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,277
and follow your heart.

204
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,361
Got it?

205
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,155
Follow my heart…

206
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:34,999
I've already found my luck.

207
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:37,668
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

208
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:41,297
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

209
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,840
-My goodness.
-Jun, there you are!

210
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,425
Auntie!

211
00:14:52,016 --> 00:14:53,017
Damn it.

212
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,151
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

213
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:19,043
The morning meeting
will start in ten minutes.

214
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:25,382
We'll officially start preparing
for the photography exhibition now.

215
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:26,967
-Ms. Jang.
-Yes?

216
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,302
-Ms. Bae.
-Yes?

217
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,387
You'll handle promoting the event on
online mom communities and social media.

218
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:32,973
I'll finalize the pamphlets
and send them to the printer.

219
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:35,601
Then I'll work on the invitations.

220
00:15:35,684 --> 00:15:37,853
We'll deliver the posters to supermarkets

221
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,730
and department store
culture centers tomorrow.

222
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,814
-All right.
-Got it.

223
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,692
It's been a while
since I've been to a culture center.

224
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,778
The one escape you have
when you're solo parenting.

225
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,489
It feels like you're on an outing
when you're there.

226
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,991
Bedtime became so much easier
after playing there all day,

227
00:15:51,075 --> 00:15:52,284
-so that's what I liked about it.
-Right.

228
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:54,954
-I know, right? They really love it.
-Yeah.

229
00:15:57,164 --> 00:15:58,415
Your kid liked it?

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,085
What did he like, exactly?

231
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,421
Well, you know…

232
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:07,549
He liked all the different classes--

233
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:08,884
Right, so what classes, exactly?

234
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,645
Well…

235
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:26,360
I guess you're finding interest
in these things

236
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:27,695
now that you're getting married.

237
00:16:27,778 --> 00:16:29,029
There are all sorts of classes.

238
00:16:29,113 --> 00:16:30,656
Flour dough classes,

239
00:16:30,739 --> 00:16:32,825
sensory play, tactile play,
and stuff like that.

240
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,868
-There are loads.
-Right, stuff like that.

241
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,163
Right.

242
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:39,707
I see.

243
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:41,125
Yes.

244
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:44,753
Let's end the meeting here.

245
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:51,719
He must be having a hard time
because his engagement has been postponed.

246
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:52,970
He's quite irritable.

247
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:54,013
Postponed?

248
00:16:54,096 --> 00:16:57,391
His mother collapsed
in the middle of the ceremony.

249
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,519
We should lie low today.

250
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:01,478
Yeah.

251
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,239
This is the draft
of the invitation wording.

252
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:18,495
May I ask

253
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:21,540
if your mother is doing all right?

254
00:17:23,584 --> 00:17:27,963
I heard that your engagement ceremony
has been postponed.

255
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,552
We're all concerned for you.

256
00:17:33,635 --> 00:17:36,096
Useless concern leads to such results.

257
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:38,557
Pardon? Is it not good?

258
00:17:39,767 --> 00:17:41,435
That's putting it mildly.

259
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:48,067
There isn't an ounce of sincerity
in these words.

260
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,320
Redo it.

261
00:17:54,573 --> 00:17:56,325
I thought it was fine.

262
00:17:58,744 --> 00:17:59,620
Darn it.

263
00:18:04,917 --> 00:18:06,335
Is this better?

264
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:07,252
Redo it.

265
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,599
Redo it.

266
00:18:25,687 --> 00:18:27,439
THE DAY WE PLANTED TREES,
OUR EYES WERE ON OUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE

267
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,365
Thank you.

268
00:18:37,324 --> 00:18:38,158
Come on.

269
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,284
Redo it.

270
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:41,787
Let's redo it.

271
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:44,706
GROWING WITH NATURE…

272
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:53,632
It's so cliché. Redo it!

273
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:09,273
Hello, Ms. Yu. How are you?

274
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,190
Not good.

275
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,608
Ji-hyeok is inside, right?

276
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,193
There he is. Excuse me.

277
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,653
Sure.

278
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:37,384
They look good together.

279
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:43,807
Before your mother collapsed yesterday,

280
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:46,143
-I was trying to say--
-"I love someone else."

281
00:19:46,768 --> 00:19:47,895
"I can't marry him"?

282
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:49,771
Don't get mad. I can explain.

283
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:50,731
Yu Ha-yeong.

284
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:56,361
How long have you known…

285
00:19:58,113 --> 00:20:00,616
that Kim Seon-u and Go Da-rim
aren't married?

286
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,618
You know?

287
00:20:02,701 --> 00:20:03,952
When? How?

288
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,746
Don't tell me Ms. Go told--

289
00:20:46,453 --> 00:20:47,412
Be quiet.

290
00:20:47,496 --> 00:20:49,331
Ms. Go doesn't know that I know yet.

291
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:51,667
What? Then how did you find out?

292
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:52,876
You don't need to know.

293
00:20:55,087 --> 00:20:56,672
Why have you kept this from me?

294
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:59,424
Because Mr. Kim asked me
to keep it a secret.

295
00:21:00,008 --> 00:21:01,718
Do you know how frustrating it was for me?

296
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:04,137
I was treated like some mistress
for no reason.

297
00:21:04,888 --> 00:21:05,764
All right.

298
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,058
We'll call off the wedding.

299
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,018
You mean it? You can't take it back.

300
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:11,436
I need to record this.

301
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,188
But do me a favor.

302
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,732
I need us to stay engaged

303
00:21:16,525 --> 00:21:17,359
for the time being.

304
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:18,402
What?

305
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,281
Ms. Gong, we have an emergency.

306
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,241
What now?

307
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:28,620
Ms. Yu headed to the TF team office
looking super upset.

308
00:21:28,704 --> 00:21:31,873
What if she and Mr. Gong
barge into the chairman's office

309
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,167
and set a date for their wedding?

310
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:36,545
Damn it.

311
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,757
I didn't know your mother
was going through that.

312
00:21:42,301 --> 00:21:46,388
I did think it was weird
that you suddenly joined the company

313
00:21:46,471 --> 00:21:47,889
and wanted to marry me.

314
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:49,016
I'm sorry.

315
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:51,643
It's fine.
It must've been tough for you as well.

316
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,856
So I just need to stay quiet
for the time being, right?

317
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:56,773
Yeah.

318
00:21:57,316 --> 00:21:58,275
Thanks.

319
00:21:58,358 --> 00:22:02,070
In exchange, you can't stop me
from pursuing Mr. Kim, okay?

320
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,364
Do you like him that much?

321
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,033
Why?

322
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:10,787
He's kind, sweet, thoughtful, and warm.

323
00:22:10,871 --> 00:22:12,622
He's just perfect.

324
00:22:13,498 --> 00:22:17,252
Well, except for the fact
that he likes Ms. Go and not me.

325
00:22:18,086 --> 00:22:19,046
But you still like him?

326
00:22:20,505 --> 00:22:23,300
Even when he likes someone else?

327
00:22:23,383 --> 00:22:25,344
What a silly thing to say.

328
00:22:26,094 --> 00:22:30,390
It's such a blessing to be able to
love someone wholeheartedly.

329
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,517
That doesn't happen often in life,
you know.

330
00:22:32,601 --> 00:22:35,604
So when it happens,
you can't let your pride stand in the way.

331
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:37,272
Then what?

332
00:22:37,355 --> 00:22:38,440
You should enjoy it.

333
00:22:39,024 --> 00:22:42,611
Enjoy yourself drowning in your feelings
for that person.

334
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:45,113
You know what?

335
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:47,824
Talking about him
is making me miss him so much.

336
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,868
I'm off to see Mr. Kim. Bye.

337
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:08,804
Ms. Go!

338
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:12,849
Did your conversation go well?

339
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,143
Yes, very well.

340
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:19,231
Speaking of which,

341
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:20,357
I know everything.

342
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:21,399
Sorry?

343
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:25,821
I know that you're single.

344
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,785
Single?

345
00:23:36,998 --> 00:23:38,875
Why would Ms. Go be single?

346
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:42,796
Ji-hye.

347
00:23:46,925 --> 00:23:47,801
Ms. Gong.

348
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,013
Single for me too.

349
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,020
Ha-yeong offered to treat us
to some ice cream.

350
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,522
Ms. Go

351
00:24:01,106 --> 00:24:03,441
asked for a single scoop as well, right?

352
00:24:04,526 --> 00:24:05,360
What?

353
00:24:06,570 --> 00:24:08,613
All right, then two single-scoop cones.

354
00:24:09,823 --> 00:24:10,949
Would you like one as well?

355
00:24:11,032 --> 00:24:12,325
No, I'm fine.

356
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:15,745
Are you here to see Ji-hyeok?

357
00:24:16,329 --> 00:24:19,040
Yes. I thought I'd stop by,
considering what happened yesterday.

358
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:19,958
I see.

359
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,336
Father wants to see us right now.

360
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:27,841
Oh, then I guess
we can't have ice cream together.

361
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,759
Ms. Go, we can have some next time.

362
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:31,386
Bye!

363
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:37,142
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

364
00:24:52,449 --> 00:24:54,242
Engagement or wedding ceremony,

365
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,953
it doesn't matter to me.

366
00:24:58,079 --> 00:25:00,040
I'd just like Mom there.

367
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:02,125
Please just wait

368
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:04,461
until she recovers.

369
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:06,880
-Who knows what trouble she'll cause?
-Father.

370
00:25:06,963 --> 00:25:09,424
I'm just worried Chairman Yu
will change his mind.

371
00:25:10,008 --> 00:25:12,260
Families are lining up
to claim Ha-yeong's hand.

372
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:15,013
You don't need to worry about that.

373
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,140
I'll be sure to accomplish enough
in the company

374
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,059
to gain Chairman Yu's approval.

375
00:25:19,643 --> 00:25:21,561
Working here isn't so bad after all, huh?

376
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:22,479
No, it isn't.

377
00:25:22,562 --> 00:25:24,105
I'm surprisingly enjoying myself.

378
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:27,442
I even started thinking

379
00:25:28,652 --> 00:25:29,486
about future plans.

380
00:25:32,405 --> 00:25:35,617
It looks like
he's finally come to his senses.

381
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,286
I'll find you a proper position soon,

382
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:39,704
so work hard.

383
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,842
I know everything.

384
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,844
I know that you're single.

385
00:26:10,652 --> 00:26:11,528
Ms. Go.

386
00:26:12,862 --> 00:26:14,239
Do you have anything to tell me?

387
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,199
Pardon?

388
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:25,417
I thought I told you it lacked sincerity.

389
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,877
I see no improvement.

390
00:26:27,961 --> 00:26:31,381
Well, I'm not much of a wordsmith,

391
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:34,592
but I believe there was sincerity
in what I wrote.

392
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:38,305
If you could specify
which part you find unsatisfactory--

393
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:40,557
Do you not know what sincere means?

394
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,186
A truthful and righteous heart.

395
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,646
Then again,

396
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,692
words only reflect the writer.

397
00:26:51,276 --> 00:26:55,155
Are you sure this is because
you don't like what I wrote?

398
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:58,992
I feel like you may be upset with me
and not my words.

399
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:04,581
May I ask you why you're upset with me?

400
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:15,800
You're right.

401
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:18,136
I am upset with you.

402
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:21,431
What is it?

403
00:27:22,682 --> 00:27:23,516
Pardon?

404
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,601
What could it be?

405
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:27,270
Why would I be upset?

406
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:30,940
I'm not sure.

407
00:27:31,024 --> 00:27:32,984
I believe you know.

408
00:27:33,068 --> 00:27:34,986
No, you must know.

409
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,157
How could you not know
about a lie you made up?

410
00:27:44,579 --> 00:27:45,455
Who are you…

411
00:27:47,374 --> 00:27:48,541
really?

412
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,711
Are you really…

413
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:55,882
Kim Seon-u's wife?

414
00:28:00,261 --> 00:28:01,429
Are you really…

415
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:04,140
Kim Jun's mom?

416
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:14,401
Welcome.

417
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,279
Surprise!

418
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:19,989
Did you miss me?

419
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:22,367
Ta-da.

420
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,369
What's this?

421
00:28:24,953 --> 00:28:25,787
I'm flirting.

422
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,333
Surely you've heard
about my engagement being postponed.

423
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:34,212
And it turns out Ji-hyeok already knew
that you two aren't married.

424
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,380
He knows?

425
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:36,840
Mr. Gong?

426
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:38,675
Yes.

427
00:28:38,758 --> 00:28:40,969
So we don't need to worry
about anything anymore.

428
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:42,846
Don't try to stop me.

429
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:46,975
What about Da-rim?
Does she know he knows? Is she okay?

430
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,102
It's always about that darn Go Da-rim.

431
00:28:50,103 --> 00:28:51,563
Why should I care?

432
00:28:53,231 --> 00:28:54,482
Where's the vase?

433
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,823
How could you do that?

434
00:29:01,906 --> 00:29:03,491
How could you pretend to be a mom
when you don't have a child?

435
00:29:03,575 --> 00:29:04,868
This is just unbelievable.

436
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:07,078
Give me back the hand cream I gave you.

437
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:08,163
Give it!

438
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:09,831
Come on, just move it along.

439
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:12,167
Pack your stuff
and get out of here already,

440
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,835
you damn con artist!

441
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,003
I'm disappointed.

442
00:29:15,086 --> 00:29:17,046
I trusted and relied on you.

443
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,048
How could you trust her?

444
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:21,259
She's serious trouble.

445
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:23,553
She's an expert at using people.

446
00:29:23,636 --> 00:29:26,806
She even tried to make something happen
with Mr. Gong.

447
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:29,809
She was trying to score big.

448
00:29:32,061 --> 00:29:33,313
Da-rim, it's time to go home.

449
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:34,355
Right.

450
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,565
-Hurry up.
-Finally!

451
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:37,233
-I'm heading out.
-It's time to go home.

452
00:29:37,317 --> 00:29:39,402
Let's go. Hurry up!

453
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,113
I'm so tired.

454
00:30:06,054 --> 00:30:06,930
Who are you…

455
00:30:08,807 --> 00:30:09,808
really?

456
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:18,650
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

457
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:26,324
Was it fun?

458
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:28,284
Toying with me?

459
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:30,578
No, not at all. I just--

460
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:31,955
You'll be fired immediately.

461
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,456
You may leave.

462
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,795
Mr. Gong, I'm really sorry.

463
00:30:38,878 --> 00:30:39,796
The truth is--

464
00:30:39,879 --> 00:30:42,257
You just missed your chance
to tell me the truth. Please leave.

465
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,946
Mom, I have something to tell--

466
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:07,574
I have good news.

467
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,033
What is it?

468
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:12,161
The doctor said I can be discharged soon.

469
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,455
We're going to set a date for next week.

470
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,457
-Really?
-Yeah.

471
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:20,795
I'll be able to sleep in my own bed soon.

472
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:21,713
I can't wait.

473
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,759
This is all thanks to you.

474
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:28,553
I didn't do anything.

475
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:32,557
All thanks to you landing a job
at that big company,

476
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:33,766
we can afford the hospital bills

477
00:31:34,350 --> 00:31:36,936
and at least cover the interest
on the loan Da-jeong took out

478
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,813
with the house as collateral.

479
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:41,024
That's the only reason why
I'm able to go back home.

480
00:31:41,107 --> 00:31:43,610
If it weren't for you,
we'd be out in the streets.

481
00:31:43,693 --> 00:31:45,570
Who knows if I'd still be alive right now?

482
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:48,656
Why would you even say that?

483
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,534
I'm just thankful for everything.

484
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:54,412
Thank you.

485
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:11,846
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

486
00:32:29,113 --> 00:32:30,365
MISSED CALL
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

487
00:32:32,283 --> 00:32:33,368
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

488
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:35,828
Mr. Gong, I'm in front of your place.

489
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:38,289
Could you hear me out for a second?

490
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,084
I just need a moment of your time.

491
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,516
MESSAGE UNREAD

492
00:34:02,665 --> 00:34:05,835
Thank you for making the time.

493
00:34:05,918 --> 00:34:07,712
Go on. Make your excuses.

494
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,214
I'll at least hear you out.

495
00:34:21,142 --> 00:34:22,769
I spent my twenties

496
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:26,230
repeatedly failing to find a job.

497
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:29,984
Then I ended up
going on my first trip to Jeju Island,

498
00:34:30,985 --> 00:34:34,197
when I got a call
that my mom had collapsed.

499
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,282
Jeju?

500
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,119
You mean that day?

501
00:34:41,037 --> 00:34:41,954
Yes.

502
00:34:43,081 --> 00:34:45,041
That's why I left

503
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,627
without even saying goodbye to you.

504
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:51,464
I didn't know what to do.

505
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,926
My younger sister left us with a huge debt
and disappeared.

506
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:58,137
My mom's hospital bills
were piling up fast.

507
00:35:00,556 --> 00:35:02,683
We were on the verge of losing our house,

508
00:35:04,352 --> 00:35:06,437
and I needed a full-time job

509
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,232
to even qualify for a loan
for office workers.

510
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:13,528
But who would hire someone over 30
with no experience?

511
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,158
That's when I saw

512
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:23,037
the job posting from Natural BeBe.

513
00:35:28,042 --> 00:35:30,086
I knew it was wrong.

514
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:37,009
But to me…

515
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,016
it felt like a lifeline from heaven.

516
00:35:45,184 --> 00:35:46,978
That's why I sucked it up

517
00:35:48,521 --> 00:35:49,522
and came up…

518
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,442
with such a lie.

519
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:56,696
I get that you're in a tough situation,

520
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,867
but not everyone
resorts to fraudulent employment.

521
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,160
Yes, I know.

522
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:07,665
I've also been losing sleep every night
because of the guilt.

523
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:11,043
I'm really sorry.

524
00:36:14,755 --> 00:36:17,341
I know this is incredibly shameless…

525
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:26,350
but could you give me a little more time?

526
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,271
At least just until I find another job.

527
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:32,565
Just…

528
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:35,359
a little bit more.

529
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,197
Just a bit more time.

530
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,200
That's all I ask.

531
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:52,543
Let me think about it.

532
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,421
I'll consider my options.

533
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:21,697
Da-rim.

534
00:37:29,497 --> 00:37:30,414
Seon-u.

535
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:34,794
It's all over for me now.

536
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:38,714
I heard.

537
00:37:40,675 --> 00:37:42,301
Mr. Gong knows everything.

538
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,387
I must be getting punished.

539
00:37:45,012 --> 00:37:47,014
You can find another job.

540
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,350
You're not the same person anymore.

541
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:51,811
You've changed a lot since this job.

542
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:54,063
You've grown stronger and more courageous.

543
00:37:55,856 --> 00:37:58,776
Do you think he's disappointed in me?

544
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:02,655
Don't worry too much.

545
00:38:04,198 --> 00:38:05,700
Just think of this
as a blessing in disguise.

546
00:38:06,867 --> 00:38:08,244
You've suffered enough.

547
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,917
Keeping secrets and lying…

548
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,547
is really stressful.

549
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,511
I'm sorry. I've only been
causing you trouble recently.

550
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:27,763
No.

551
00:38:28,347 --> 00:38:29,307
Not that.

552
00:38:31,767 --> 00:38:34,061
I was keeping something from you
and lying about it.

553
00:38:34,645 --> 00:38:35,521
From me?

554
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:37,231
About what?

555
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:42,445
My feelings.

556
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,282
I kept my feelings from you.

557
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,659
What?

558
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:52,788
I like you.

559
00:38:54,206 --> 00:38:55,916
Not as a friend or family

560
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:57,918
but as a woman.

561
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:04,800
What?

562
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:08,012
We've been friends
and more or less family for over 20 years,

563
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,182
and I feel bad that I have a child.

564
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:15,353
I thought about it a lot because
I was worried things would get awkward.

565
00:39:16,687 --> 00:39:17,563
But…

566
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:20,274
I don't think I can hide it anymore.

567
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,705
I think I'll really regret it
if I lose you.

568
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:39,835
Well…

569
00:39:39,919 --> 00:39:40,836
I…

570
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,422
-You see, I--
-Da-rim.

571
00:39:43,506 --> 00:39:44,799
Yeah?

572
00:39:44,882 --> 00:39:46,634
Don't give me an answer now.

573
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:48,928
You can tell me later.

574
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,098
I want you to take
as much time as you need…

575
00:39:56,769 --> 00:39:58,938
and think about it seriously.

576
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:21,836
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

577
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,049
I got a call that my mom had collapsed.

578
00:40:27,133 --> 00:40:29,218
That's why I left

579
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:31,804
without even saying goodbye to you.

580
00:40:32,555 --> 00:40:34,515
My mom's hospital bills
were piling up fast.

581
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,892
I knew it was wrong.

582
00:40:37,518 --> 00:40:40,146
But to me,
it felt like a lifeline from heaven.

583
00:40:41,313 --> 00:40:43,065
That's why I sucked it up

584
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:45,693
and came up…

585
00:40:48,529 --> 00:40:49,363
with such a lie.

586
00:40:53,951 --> 00:40:58,247
It's such a blessing to be able to
love someone wholeheartedly.

587
00:40:58,330 --> 00:40:59,957
That doesn't happen often in life,
you know.

588
00:41:02,501 --> 00:41:04,336
Don't worry about anything else.

589
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,506
Just focus on yourself

590
00:41:08,382 --> 00:41:10,426
and follow your heart.

591
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,866
MOTHER TF TEAM
GO DA-RIM

592
00:42:26,752 --> 00:42:28,379
-Are you okay?
-I can do it.

593
00:42:28,462 --> 00:42:29,380
Let me help you.

594
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:32,716
-Thank you.
-No problem.

595
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,238
Are you okay?

596
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,407
You should wait over there.

597
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:58,075
-Thank you.
-Sure.

598
00:42:58,158 --> 00:42:59,785
Sorry. It'll just be a second.

599
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,412
Grab that.

600
00:43:03,998 --> 00:43:05,416
Mischievous tangerines.

601
00:43:05,499 --> 00:43:06,959
-Yes, they are.
-Thank you so much.

602
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,627
-No worries.
-Thank you.

603
00:43:30,816 --> 00:43:31,775
Oh no.

604
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,158
Thank you.

605
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:38,592
Good morning.

606
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:40,427
Oh, you're up early.

607
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,137
I'll prepare breakfast for you.

608
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:43,138
Is that mail?

609
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:45,432
Yes, it's addressed to Mr. Yu,

610
00:44:45,516 --> 00:44:46,892
but there's no sender information.

611
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:49,353
Really?

612
00:44:49,853 --> 00:44:50,896
You can give it to me.

613
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:52,231
I'll bring it to him.

614
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:53,232
Okay.

615
00:44:57,486 --> 00:44:58,320
RECIPIENT: YU JIN-TAE

616
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:18,424
You must be quite desperate,
resorting to such methods.

617
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:19,341
What are you talking about?

618
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:20,926
That wasn't me.

619
00:45:21,009 --> 00:45:22,845
Who else wants to stop this wedding?

620
00:45:23,929 --> 00:45:25,722
You can be honest with me.

621
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:27,266
I'm the only one on your side right now.

622
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,644
Actually, you have one more.
Mr. Ma Jong-gu, was it?

623
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,313
Did he tell you that?

624
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:39,111
I tried feeling him out earlier,
and he couldn't stop rambling.

625
00:45:39,194 --> 00:45:40,904
He basically confessed to it.

626
00:45:43,282 --> 00:45:44,741
Even your subordinate is just like you.

627
00:45:45,409 --> 00:45:48,036
I could see right through him.

628
00:45:50,998 --> 00:45:53,292
You should be thankful that I intercepted.

629
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,586
Just imagine if my father saw this.

630
00:45:55,669 --> 00:45:58,088
He would've pushed up the wedding
to stop this from spreading.

631
00:45:59,882 --> 00:46:00,716
Push it up?

632
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:03,093
With so much at stake,
you think he'd call it off over this?

633
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,637
You're still so naive.

634
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:07,973
That's why

635
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:10,767
you need me.

636
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:15,355
Got it, baby?

637
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:18,901
You're so adorable.

638
00:46:22,529 --> 00:46:23,489
I'm off.

639
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,876
Ms. Lee and I will cover the Gangbuk area.

640
00:46:35,959 --> 00:46:37,669
Can you cover the Gangnam area, Ms. Go?

641
00:46:37,753 --> 00:46:40,172
-Sure thing.
-With Mr. Gong.

642
00:46:41,465 --> 00:46:42,966
I can go alone.

643
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:45,427
Come on now, it's too much for one person.

644
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:48,472
No, it's not too much at all.
Not even in the slightest.

645
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:53,310
I'm coming along to prevent you
from causing me any possible trouble.

646
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:56,313
Who knows what kind of trouble
you'll get into wandering around?

647
00:46:57,731 --> 00:46:59,399
Cleaning up after you
would be more of a hassle.

648
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,279
That damn mouth of his.

649
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:06,573
Let's go.

650
00:47:14,540 --> 00:47:15,415
POSTERS

651
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:26,718
You know how to drive, right?

652
00:47:27,302 --> 00:47:28,679
You want me to drive?

653
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:30,556
I'm a bit tired. Do you not want to?

654
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,016
No, it's just that I've barely driven
since getting my license.

655
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,230
Yes, sir.

656
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:41,191
Fine, whatever.

657
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,286
Go Da-rim?

658
00:48:18,270 --> 00:48:19,521
A bicycle just passed us.

659
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,608
Step on it a little, will you?

660
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:23,734
More?

661
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:25,193
Aren't we going fast enough?

662
00:48:27,821 --> 00:48:29,615
It's fine. Step on it.

663
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:30,574
What?

664
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,992
Step on it.

665
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:32,909
Okay.

666
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,664
Stop, stop, stop!

667
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:51,928
Have you lost your mind?

668
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:53,096
You call that driving?

669
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,642
It's been a while since I've driven,
and with you next to me,

670
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,060
I got so nervous.

671
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,811
I'm not chewing you up right now, am I?

672
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:03,065
Who knows when you'll tell me to quit?

673
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,566
I'm just anxious.

674
00:49:05,651 --> 00:49:08,820
You can relax. I won't let anyone
in the company know for the time being.

675
00:49:09,821 --> 00:49:10,864
Do you mean that?

676
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:13,241
We have the campaign and the exhibition.

677
00:49:13,325 --> 00:49:15,702
Do you know how much work you've started?

678
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,579
You need to see them through
before you leave.

679
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:19,873
We're short-staffed as it is.

680
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,626
Thank you, Mr. Gong.

681
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,795
So get your act together already!

682
00:49:25,337 --> 00:49:27,047
One slip, and you're fired.

683
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:29,966
Okay, I'll get my act together.

684
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:31,426
Go already.

685
00:49:32,052 --> 00:49:33,095
Okay.

686
00:49:33,178 --> 00:49:34,721
Slow down!

687
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:41,895
-The right side is higher.
-Oh, is it?

688
00:49:41,978 --> 00:49:42,938
Then…

689
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,524
Come on. The left side is higher now.

690
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:48,193
It's not leveled at all. Jeez.

691
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:50,195
Oh gosh.

692
00:49:51,613 --> 00:49:53,824
How is it so hard to get this right?

693
00:49:54,449 --> 00:49:55,367
Excuse me.

694
00:49:55,450 --> 00:49:57,035
Press down slowly.

695
00:49:58,161 --> 00:50:00,372
-And slowly press down here.
-Right.

696
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:05,210
Just stay here for a bit.

697
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,965
Mr. Gong, I don't think we should be--

698
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:10,882
Stay still.

699
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:13,760
I know I'm single,

700
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:16,513
and we did have
something along the lines of a fling,

701
00:50:16,596 --> 00:50:19,558
but we shouldn't hold hands like this
with you behind me…

702
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:20,600
-Just a second.
-Sure.

703
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:23,311
Press down on this.

704
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:25,647
And here as well.

705
00:50:30,986 --> 00:50:32,362
Is it still a bit crooked?

706
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,367
That should do.

707
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,081
What did you just say?

708
00:50:43,665 --> 00:50:45,584
Oh, nothing.

709
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,627
It was nothing.

710
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:50,213
You have an excellent sense of balance.

711
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:51,840
As expected of you, sir.

712
00:51:02,893 --> 00:51:03,769
A lawsuit?

713
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,270
My word.

714
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,939
You made a big decision.

715
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,107
It's all thanks to you.

716
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:12,611
I've reflected a lot.

717
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:14,321
I didn't do anything.

718
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:15,864
You told me when a mom falls apart,

719
00:51:15,947 --> 00:51:18,992
the child's whole world crumbles.

720
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:22,913
That's why I decided
I should become stronger now.

721
00:51:23,413 --> 00:51:26,208
I'm glad to see you with some spark.

722
00:51:27,501 --> 00:51:29,795
How am I ever going to
leave this frail lady behind

723
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,379
and go home by myself?

724
00:51:32,631 --> 00:51:33,632
You're being discharged?

725
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:35,383
Yes, in a few days.

726
00:51:35,467 --> 00:51:38,512
Your cast should be coming off
any day now, no?

727
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,138
Yes.

728
00:51:40,222 --> 00:51:41,681
It should be.

729
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:47,395
I'm not sure where I should go
after being discharged.

730
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,357
I have a lot to handle
without my husband knowing.

731
00:51:50,440 --> 00:51:52,943
If I go back to the psychiatric hospital,

732
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:55,403
I'll be surrounded by my husband's people.

733
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:58,865
If I stay at a hotel,
I'm bound to draw attention

734
00:51:59,491 --> 00:52:01,243
with the attorneys coming in and out.

735
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,623
What about my place?

736
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:08,625
Pardon?

737
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:10,335
My younger daughter's room is free.

738
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,713
Just tell your husband
you're going on a trip far away.

739
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,259
I appreciate it, but…

740
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:20,011
Are you sure?

741
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,680
I don't want to inconvenience you.

742
00:52:21,763 --> 00:52:25,892
I'd be home alone all day
after my daughter goes to work anyway.

743
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,811
It'd be nice to have a friend to talk to.

744
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:31,022
Don't worry about a thing,
and just think of it as your home.

745
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:33,775
It's going to be fun.

746
00:52:37,571 --> 00:52:38,446
Hello.

747
00:52:49,374 --> 00:52:51,167
I thought they were only interviewing
the photographer,

748
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:53,086
but here you are, Mr. Gong.

749
00:52:54,212 --> 00:52:55,338
I know, right?

750
00:52:55,422 --> 00:52:57,549
They asked for the team leader
who organized the exhibition

751
00:52:58,425 --> 00:53:00,343
or a representative
from the hosting organization.

752
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:02,762
And that happens to be me.

753
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:04,180
I see.

754
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,142
You're really studying that script.

755
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,185
You're a great actor already.

756
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,063
Oh, it's a compliment.

757
00:53:12,147 --> 00:53:14,149
You really have a knack for it.

758
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:16,192
I was totally fooled

759
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:18,653
and believed you were her husband.

760
00:53:23,909 --> 00:53:24,868
I'm sorry.

761
00:53:25,827 --> 00:53:28,121
I've actually been meaning
to apologize to you.

762
00:53:28,204 --> 00:53:30,498
Da-rim was in such a tough situation,

763
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,877
and I made the wrong choice
because I wanted to help in any way.

764
00:53:36,254 --> 00:53:38,965
I've been made aware
of her family situation,

765
00:53:40,008 --> 00:53:41,760
but the company won't care about that.

766
00:53:43,136 --> 00:53:44,679
She'll be fired soon.

767
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:46,556
Right.

768
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:49,976
Of course, she would be, but it's okay.

769
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,312
I'll be taking care of Da-rim…

770
00:53:53,897 --> 00:53:55,315
from now on.

771
00:54:03,740 --> 00:54:05,825
And who are you to do that?

772
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,288
The person who knows her the best…

773
00:54:13,124 --> 00:54:14,584
and worries about her the most.

774
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,677
We're ready for you now.

775
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,512
-Please follow me.
-Okay.

776
00:54:30,183 --> 00:54:33,144
The theme for this exhibition is "growth."

777
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:35,271
Is there a special meaning behind that?

778
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,439
Yes, there is.

779
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:40,402
Growth doesn't just mean
to grow physically,

780
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:44,572
but also to change and transform
for the better.

781
00:54:45,198 --> 00:54:47,200
So through this exhibition,

782
00:54:47,283 --> 00:54:49,035
I wanted to relay the message

783
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,707
of making a better world
for the family I love.

784
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:55,333
Oh my, that's lovely.

785
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:57,669
Thank you.

786
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,048
-Great.
-Oh gosh!

787
00:55:03,049 --> 00:55:04,884
Oh no, what a mess.

788
00:55:04,968 --> 00:55:06,094
My hand just slipped.

789
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,597
Sorry.

790
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:12,434
Right.

791
00:55:12,517 --> 00:55:14,269
I'm fine. Please continue.

792
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:18,481
Then shall we move on
to a question for Mr. Gong?

793
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,316
You took on this major campaign

794
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:24,112
with a team of entry-level employees
as soon as you joined the company.

795
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:26,781
Did you feel any pressure?

796
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,074
I'm not sure.

797
00:55:28,158 --> 00:55:30,285
Compared to the scale
of corporate M&As I used to handle,

798
00:55:30,368 --> 00:55:32,162
this is a very small-scale event,

799
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,872
so I didn't feel any pressure.

800
00:55:33,955 --> 00:55:37,000
I'm also very much enjoying
working with my team members.

801
00:55:38,626 --> 00:55:39,711
That woman over there

802
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,880
is the one who came up with the idea
for this campaign.

803
00:55:41,963 --> 00:55:43,840
We work great together,

804
00:55:44,466 --> 00:55:46,760
and she's someone
who faithfully follows my lead.

805
00:55:47,469 --> 00:55:49,554
Ms. Go Da-rim.

806
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,646
I'm sorry,
I was reaching for the rice cakes.

807
00:56:00,148 --> 00:56:01,024
Wow.

808
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,860
Something's in the air today.

809
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,361
I'm sorry.

810
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:06,780
It's fine.

811
00:56:07,989 --> 00:56:09,032
It was an accident.

812
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:10,408
Right, so…

813
00:56:10,492 --> 00:56:14,120
Then how about we have

814
00:56:14,204 --> 00:56:17,791
Ms. Go Da-rim join us for a chat?

815
00:56:23,129 --> 00:56:24,005
Me?

816
00:56:27,675 --> 00:56:30,720
Why do you believe
this campaign has garnered

817
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,222
such a positive public response?

818
00:56:35,391 --> 00:56:39,604
Environmental issues are something
everyone experiences firsthand.

819
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,731
And I believe

820
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:46,694
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok's
long-standing principle

821
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,406
of upholding
corporate social responsibility

822
00:56:50,490 --> 00:56:54,202
may have resonated well
with the consumers.

823
00:56:55,078 --> 00:56:56,746
My goodness.

824
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,748
I wasn't trying to make
my principles so obvious,

825
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:00,375
but I guess I failed.

826
00:57:02,961 --> 00:57:03,795
Oh dear.

827
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,300
I also believe Mr. Kim Seon-u's

828
00:57:09,384 --> 00:57:13,763
artistic and heartfelt photos

829
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:16,683
really resonated with a lot of people.

830
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,726
Even with principles,

831
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:21,438
how you present them is what matters.

832
00:57:22,063 --> 00:57:23,273
Simply talking about them

833
00:57:24,065 --> 00:57:25,233
won't get the message across.

834
00:57:29,737 --> 00:57:33,032
Yes, of course.
Thank you for your insight.

835
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,869
I think we can end the interview here.

836
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,830
We'll just take a few more shots
of you two to use as the main photo.

837
00:57:39,414 --> 00:57:40,248
Sure.

838
00:57:48,506 --> 00:57:49,841
You're too far apart.

839
00:57:49,924 --> 00:57:51,384
Can you come to the center?

840
00:57:58,641 --> 00:57:59,726
That's great.

841
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:01,644
Why don't we try a handshake?

842
00:58:30,131 --> 00:58:32,133
Yes, that's great. Please look this way.

843
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:33,760
Now, give us a smile.

844
00:58:33,843 --> 00:58:35,428
Smile.

845
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,072
Great job today. You must be tired.

846
00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:55,114
It was nothing.

847
00:58:55,198 --> 00:58:56,407
You're done, right?

848
00:58:56,491 --> 00:58:57,700
Let's have dinner together.

849
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,871
I actually have some work to catch up on.

850
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:05,041
I saw the others go home earlier.
You're working by yourself?

851
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:08,169
Yeah, well, the thing is…

852
00:59:09,003 --> 00:59:10,964
You also need to pick up Jun.

853
00:59:11,047 --> 00:59:12,840
He's away at camp.

854
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,804
Hang on.

855
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:19,430
Are you acting like this
because I said I liked you?

856
00:59:23,560 --> 00:59:25,144
Come on.

857
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:26,771
This is how you're reacting to it?

858
00:59:27,355 --> 00:59:28,898
Are you sure you're the Go Da-rim I know?

859
00:59:29,566 --> 00:59:31,526
Hey, you're the weird one.

860
00:59:31,609 --> 00:59:34,529
How could you be perfectly fine
after saying all that?

861
00:59:34,612 --> 00:59:36,614
I wouldn't say I'm perfectly fine.

862
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:39,117
I'm just used to the butterflies.

863
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:40,577
What?

864
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,540
I'll wait for you downstairs.
Come down when you're ready.

865
00:59:48,793 --> 00:59:49,919
Okay, I'll be there soon.

866
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:05,268
Ms. Go.

867
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:07,687
Can I see you in my office?

868
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:12,609
Sure.

869
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,531
Did we send out all the invitations
for the exhibition?

870
01:00:18,615 --> 01:00:20,033
We finished that earlier in the afternoon.

871
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,368
Then what about the social media event?

872
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:24,829
We compiled a list of the winners'
IDs and addresses

873
01:00:24,912 --> 01:00:26,497
and handed it over to the marketing team.

874
01:00:26,581 --> 01:00:27,665
-You did?
-Yes.

875
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:30,209
I see.

876
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,962
Are the pamphlets printed?

877
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:34,130
They need to be checked thoroughly.

878
01:00:34,213 --> 01:00:35,632
They should arrive tomorrow,

879
01:00:35,715 --> 01:00:37,842
so I'll be sure to check them thoroughly
when they do.

880
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,720
Okay.

881
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:42,347
What else is there?

882
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,017
Is that everything?
Let's see here. Hold on.

883
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,233
SEON-U

884
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,577
I'll be taking care of Da-rim…

885
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,538
from now on.

886
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:16,714
I'll get going then.

887
01:01:36,484 --> 01:01:37,568
Let's have a meal.

888
01:01:38,861 --> 01:01:39,737
You and me.

889
01:01:44,534 --> 01:01:46,661
I already have plans.

890
01:01:46,744 --> 01:01:47,870
Cancel them.

891
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,498
And stay with me.

892
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:54,585
Don't go.

893
01:01:58,548 --> 01:01:59,590
I don't want you to go.

894
01:02:15,982 --> 01:02:20,903
DYNAMITE KISS

895
01:02:51,017 --> 01:02:52,894
You can't do this.

896
01:02:53,478 --> 01:02:54,645
What about Ms. Yu?

897
01:02:54,729 --> 01:02:57,106
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

898
01:02:57,190 --> 01:02:58,649
I saw him being all lovey-dovey
with his fiancée.

899
01:02:58,733 --> 01:03:00,526
Why would he lie about that?

900
01:03:00,610 --> 01:03:02,737
Was I mistaken?

901
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,781
You care deeply for other people.

902
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:06,407
That's why I like you.

903
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:10,077
-You take action. That's why I like you.
-Is this a new form of bullying?

904
01:03:10,161 --> 01:03:12,663
You said I had no reason to like you.

905
01:03:12,747 --> 01:03:13,998
