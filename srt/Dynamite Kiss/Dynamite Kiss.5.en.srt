Who are you?

5
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,746
Just make a direct sale to me
if you're going to sell anyway.

Skip the cutting, harvesting,

7

and refrigerating.

I'm offering to save you the trouble
of going through all that nasty stuff.

Well…

If you do,

21

I'll buy all your organs too.

The end.

27
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:32,253
Dad, when will that pretty lady be back?

"Pretty lady"?

Can she be your girlfriend?

Why?

[chuckling] She's pretty.

Don't worry about me

I'm sorry.

[inhales sharply] Thank you
so much, Mr. Gong.

50

I'll figure out a way
to pay you back as soon as--

51
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,826

about everything for now

00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:17,502
What happened to your wrist?

Oh, this? It's nothing.

71
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,639
Did it happen at the office?

72
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,474
Is that why your team leader
drove you home?

73
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:34,143
You saw?

74
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:37,563
Well, you know the loan sharks?

75
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:39,690
They showed up at the office

76
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,651
and dragged me away.

77
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:43,653
And you're only telling me this now?

00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,363
[Da-rim chuckles]

79
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:46,447
Are you okay?

80
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:49,450
Mr. Gong followed us and saved me, and…

81
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:54,747
Da-rim?

82
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,834
-Hey, Go Da-rim.
-Right. Sorry.

83
00:06:57,917 --> 00:07:01,337
He saved me and paid off my debt.

84
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,256
He paid off…

85
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,925
your debt?

86
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:09,428
I think he paid it off
because it was an emergency.

87
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:11,180
I need to talk to him tomorrow.

88
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:17,103
[sighs] I'm just a nuisance
to all those around me.

89
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:18,688
[Seon-u] Sorry.

90
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,440
I should've been more attentive.

91
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,358
Why would you be sorry?

92
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:26,028
I'm the one who should be sorry
for making you worry about this.

93
00:07:26,654 --> 00:07:28,531
[inhales deeply] Anyway, thank you.

forever? It's making me anxious.

I hope Mr. Gong isn't being
severely told off because of us.

118

What if someone gets fired over this?

119
00:09:15,137 --> 00:09:16,264
I'll leave.

120
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,599
I was the one
who left during the broadcast.

121

Why would you leave?

122
00:09:20,518 --> 00:09:22,937
I'm the one responsible
for the actual accident.

00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,107
No, you were only there
to cover for me in the first place.

How'd it go?

Are we all fired?

130

[sighs] Why would you be fired?

131
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:47,628
Don't worry.

132
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,215
Mr. Gong took care of everything.

133
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:52,633

on our competitor's broadcast

"I'm very much at fault."

"Why would you apologize,
Ms. Gong?" [grunts]

"A mother shouldn't need to rehearse

"Not to mention,

00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:22,413
it was utterly unprofessional
for the other host to run out bawling!"

[dynamic music playing]

148
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:00,534
This shows the number of posts

149
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:03,996
on social media and online mom communities
that mention Natural BeBe

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,164
since the livestream.

151
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:08,626
The majority of them praise Ms. Lee Go-eun
for sharing her story

152
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,796
and Natural BeBe
for its single-mother support program.

We're also trending
across major search engines,

by more than ten times the usual.

158
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,142
As you can see,
Natural BeBe's boost in brand image

159
00:11:25,226 --> 00:11:28,437
directly led to increased sales.

160
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,439
The sales during the livestream
may have been low,

161
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:34,026

was far beyond expectations.

When did you do all that research?

You were here until late yesterday,
working on the incident report.

No wonder. I knew I could
put my faith in him from the start.

You know, jerks come in all kinds.

180
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:26,078
Mr. Gong isn't an ignorant jerk.

181
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,205
He's a learned man,
which makes him a competent jerk.

182
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:29,957
Yeah, I think I understand.

183
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:33,252
His every word pisses you right off,
but he's right on all counts.

184
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,336
Exactly.

185
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:42,720
You got lucky this time,
but it won't happen again.

186
00:12:42,803 --> 00:12:44,180
From now on,

187
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:45,848
you must get my confirmation
on everything first

188
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,350
and follow my orders at all times.

189
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,395
And don't be stubborn for no reason.

190
00:12:51,479 --> 00:12:52,813
If and when I say no,

191
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,065
it means no.

192
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,902
Do you understand?

193
00:12:57,985 --> 00:12:59,195
[all] Yes, sir.

194
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:00,362
Okay.

195
00:13:02,239 --> 00:13:03,240
[chuckles]

196
00:13:04,783 --> 00:13:06,368
How strange.

197
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,078
Why did you change your mind?

198
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:09,830
[Ji-hyeok] What do you mean?

199
00:13:09,914 --> 00:13:12,208
You're going to confirm
and sign off on every little thing?

200
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:14,126
What happened to never bothering you?

201
00:13:14,919 --> 00:13:16,128
You.

202
00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:18,464
-Gyeong-min, you…
-What about me?

203
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:20,132
You called me an innate leader.

204
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,967
I think that describes me perfectly.

205
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,554
No matter how much I try not to care
about my team members,

206
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,764
I can't help myself.

207
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:28,057
I've been losing sleep,

208
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:30,351
and my heart's been burning up
with passion.

209
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:33,896
It must be a side effect of my trying
to suppress that innate leadership.

210
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,024
So I came to the conclusion that I should
let my leadership run free while I'm here

211
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:38,317
if I don't want to fall ill.

212
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,694
[sighs]

213
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,696
It's tiring to be so perfect.

214
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:46,408
[grunts] Gyeong-min, I'm tired. [sighs]

215
00:13:47,743 --> 00:13:50,579
Does the blind squirrel really deserve
such praise for finding a nut?

216
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:51,789
Damn it.

217
00:13:52,456 --> 00:13:55,751
Mr. Gong is one lucky guy.

218
00:13:55,834 --> 00:13:58,587
It's as if those nuts
all lined up in front of him,

219
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,714
ready to be harvested. [exclaims]

220
00:14:00,798 --> 00:14:02,841
Can you not? [clicks tongue]

221
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,928
This won't do. We need to eliminate
any chance of them accomplishing anything.

222
00:14:06,011 --> 00:14:09,682
But we can't just let them idle
without giving them any work, can we?

223
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:10,975
No, we can't.

224
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,894
So we need to send them

225
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,605
where their efforts will go least noticed.

226
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:21,360
[Da-rim] It's a promissory note.

227
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:25,322
I'll be sure to pay you back 700,000 won
every month.

228
00:14:25,406 --> 00:14:26,782
Won't that be difficult?

229
00:14:27,908 --> 00:14:29,159
You have to pay
for your mother's hospital bills too.

230
00:14:29,243 --> 00:14:30,452
Not at all.

231
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,538
This is something I must do,
no matter what.

232
00:14:33,163 --> 00:14:36,792
Regarding the interest, would keeping it
at the bank interest rate--

233
00:14:36,876 --> 00:14:37,877
[Ji-hyeok] Forget the interest.

234
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:39,169
Just pay the principal.

235
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:42,214
Are you sure? [sighs]

236
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:44,550
How can I collect interest
from a team member?

237
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:46,594
[sighs] Mr. Gong.

238
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,803
Did you tell your husband?

239
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:48,888
Of course.

240
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:53,100
He wanted me to tell you
how grateful he is for your generosity.

241
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,812
Not about the money,
but the danger you were in.

242
00:14:58,022 --> 00:15:00,274
He could've at least
picked you up from work for a few days

243
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:02,568
if he knew loan sharks were after you.

244
00:15:02,651 --> 00:15:03,861
Is he always so indifferent?

245
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:07,197
No, of course not.
My husband isn't like that.

246
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,991
He's just been a bit busy recently.

247
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:11,243
He's normally very attentive.

248
00:15:11,327 --> 00:15:14,872
I would go so far as to say
that he's too good for me.

249
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:15,956
[Ji-hyeok hits table]

250
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:21,045
How can you say that
when you almost lost all your organs?

251
00:15:21,128 --> 00:15:22,713
You should know what to defend
and what not to.

252
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:23,881
What counts

253
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:27,217
is being there when you need them.

254

-[grunts]
-[sighs]

255
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,723
This whole situation!

256
00:15:32,806 --> 00:15:34,892
Who was the one who paid to resolve it?

257
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:36,393
Sorry?

258
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:37,978
Listen carefully.

259
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:40,230
Until you pay off this debt,

260
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:41,774
you're mine, Ms. Go Da-rim.

261
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:43,692
What does that even mean?

262
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,110
All mine!

263
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:48,072
Your eyes, brain, lungs, heart, liver,
kidneys, and everything else! All of it!

264
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:51,450
Are you claiming ownership
over my organs right now?

265
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,119
Speaking of which, your eyes right now.

266
00:15:54,703 --> 00:15:56,872
I don't like them, so look away.

267
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,208
I can't even look at what I want?

268
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,293
Of course not. Because they're mine.

269
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,504
I bought those eyes.

270
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:05,297
With my money!

271
00:16:11,095 --> 00:16:12,846
Seriously, what's wrong with him?

272
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,391
[sighs] He's so weird.

-[Ji-hyeok] Come on.
-[Da-rim exclaims]

275
00:16:20,145 --> 00:16:22,815
That's all grease.
It's terrible for your organs.

276
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:24,775
-That's my lunch.
-[Ji-hyeok] No.

277
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:26,777
I refuse to subject my organs to this.

278
00:16:27,361 --> 00:16:30,197
-A salad?
-Consumption is the quickest disposal.

279

[grunts, sighs]

280
00:16:33,534 --> 00:16:34,535
Okay.

281
00:16:34,618 --> 00:16:37,079
My precious sausage bread…

282
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,917
[Ji-hyeok] Change into these.

283
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:44,294
What? Those look really painful.

284
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,587
I'm okay.

285
00:16:45,671 --> 00:16:46,964
Don't be absurd.

286
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:48,757
They say your feet are your second heart.

287
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,677
They're a miniature version of your body,
connected to all your organs.

288
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:53,846
You must wear them

289
00:16:53,929 --> 00:16:56,724
for the sake of the health of my organs.

290
00:16:56,807 --> 00:16:59,518
I don't need to wear these.
My organs are already very healthy.

291
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,813
If you're going to do whatever you want,
then pay off your debt first.

292
00:17:06,233 --> 00:17:07,234
Wait…

-Oh. [pants]

to keep up with the trends.

00:17:38,557 --> 00:17:40,476
-Here. Let me carry it.
-No, I'm fine.

302
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,144
-It's fine. Give it to me.
-No, I'm really okay.

that Jun has never seen his mom before.

Yes.

358
00:20:58,507 --> 00:21:00,676
There's a playground for the kids
over there.

359
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:03,971
We also built a fountain plaza
and a nature learning center

360
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:05,973
to make it a fun and relaxing
family-friendly park.

361
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,559
-It's huge. This place is so nice.
-[chuckles]

362
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:11,937
I know, and even the admission is free.

363
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,231
-How did I not know about this place?
-[grunts]

364
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:15,899
But I don't see many visitors.

365
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:20,195
As of late,
corporate support has been minimal.

366
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:22,948
That's why promotion is limited
and the facilities are showing their age,

367
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:25,742
which has led to a steady decline
in visitors.

368
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:28,078
Then why did they build it
in the first place?

369
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:32,291
So, what are we here to do today?

370
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,335
[Nan-suk grunts]

371
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:37,212
[exclaims]

372
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:39,006
My back is killing me.

373
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,341
Are we being punished
for screwing up the livestream?

374
00:21:41,425 --> 00:21:43,218
It hasn't even been a month
since I got my laser treatment.

375
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:44,428
What if it all goes to waste?

376
00:21:45,554 --> 00:21:47,723
[Go-eun] We should be thankful
we still have our jobs.

377
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,766
This is nothing compared to giving birth.

378
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:51,643
Yeah, you're totally right about that.

379
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:54,187
I passed out
when I was giving birth to my oldest.

380
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,523
I was in labor for 12 hours,

381
00:21:56,606 --> 00:21:59,443
and my kid's head got stuck in my pelvis
because it was so big.

382
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:02,070
[gasps] They had no choice
but to use a vacuum extractor,

383
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:04,031
-and my kid's head is still dented.
-[gasps]

384
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:06,742
[Jin-hui] I cried so much
about my kid having a cone-head.

385
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:08,410
I don't even remember the pain.

386
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:10,829
What about you, Da-rim?
How was it for you?

387
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:12,414
What?

388
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:15,876
For me…

389
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:18,462
[Da-rim] What was it again?

390
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:21,423
What did Mom say
about my birth again? [gasps]

391
00:22:22,007 --> 00:22:24,301
I was in labor for a full day and a half,

392
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,762
but in the end,
they had to do a C-section--

393
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:28,972
-[exclaims]
-[exclaims]

394
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,349
-What's wrong?
-You poor thing.

395
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:33,977
Jun better be
the world's greatest son to you.

396
00:22:34,061 --> 00:22:36,104
-What?
-[Jin-hui] That's the greatest injustice.

397
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,523
You go through all that labor pain
just to have surgery.

398
00:22:38,607 --> 00:22:40,067
[Nan-suk] But isn't it just amazing?

399
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:43,695
As soon as you see your baby,
you forget all about the pain.

400
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,780
-I know, right?
-[laughs]

401
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,240
[sighs] You're so right.

402
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:51,203
He was so adorable with such fair skin.
I thought I gave birth to an angel.

403
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,996
Your newborn was adorable with fair skin?

404
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:55,373
They're all red and wrinkly.

405
00:22:56,625 --> 00:23:00,295
You know, it sometimes sounds like
you've never raised a child.

406
00:23:00,921 --> 00:23:02,089
-What?
-[Jin-hui] Da-rim.

407
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:04,382
There was also that diaper incident.

408
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
You've never raised a kid, have you?

409
00:23:11,098 --> 00:23:13,016
What are you talking about?

410
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,893
I fed and bathed him myself.

411
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,853
Don't lie to us. We can just tell.

412
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,522
Your hands look like
they've never done hard work.

413
00:23:18,605 --> 00:23:21,024
Just look at that soft and smooth skin.

414
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:27,030
[Da-rim gasps]

415
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,240
Oh no.

416
00:23:28,907 --> 00:23:30,450
Have I been exposed?

417
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,788
I bet her loving husband
changed every diaper

418
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:38,750
and made sure
she didn't even lift a finger.

419
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,043
[Jin-hui] And the baby

420
00:23:40,127 --> 00:23:43,338
probably takes after his handsome father.

421
00:23:43,421 --> 00:23:46,049
That's probably why she thought
he looked like an angel.

422
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,635
-You know how it goes.
-Loving husband, my ass.

423
00:23:48,718 --> 00:23:52,472
-I should get out of here.
-Of course, her husband is so handsome.

424
00:23:52,556 --> 00:23:54,599
-My back is killing me.
-I'd like to see his handsome face.

425
00:23:54,683 --> 00:23:55,684
I'm telling you, Nan-suk.

426
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,978
-He's ridiculously handsome.
-[Nan-suk] Really?

427
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:02,023
-Yeah, he is. [chuckles]
-[Nan-suk] Goodness gracious.

428
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:03,692
[Jin-hui] How can someone be so lucky?

429
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,528
[Nan-suk] And she gave birth to a son.
How perfect.

430
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:09,573
[sighs] That was a close call.

431
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,284
I should just shut up if I don't know.

432
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:14,369
[baby crying]

433
00:24:20,208 --> 00:24:22,502
Do you want some help?

434
00:24:22,586 --> 00:24:23,879
Really?

435
00:24:23,962 --> 00:24:25,172
-Thank you so much.
-Not at all.

436
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,134
You must've been uncomfortable.

437
00:24:29,718 --> 00:24:31,553
Just hold on a second.

438
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,347
Here we go. That's it.

439
00:24:34,431 --> 00:24:35,682
You're so cute.

440
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,393
-All done.
-[parent] Oh gosh.

441
00:24:39,728 --> 00:24:41,396
-Thank you.
-It was nothing.

442
00:24:41,479 --> 00:24:43,440
I actually hurt my hand.

443
00:24:43,523 --> 00:24:45,317
You're really good at this.

444
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:49,738
I practiced a lot while watching
videos. [chuckles, inhales sharply]

445
00:24:49,821 --> 00:24:52,449
But I noticed you were using
a foreign brand of diapers.

446
00:24:53,116 --> 00:24:56,494
A Korean brand called Natural BeBe
also sells excellent diapers.

447
00:24:56,995 --> 00:25:01,166
[sighs] I know, but this brand donates
part of its proceeds

448
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:02,792
to environmental protection.

449
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:06,004
The environment has become
my biggest concern after giving birth.

450
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:09,507
When you realize that this world is
where your child will grow up and live in,

451
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,885
your mind-set shifts.

452
00:25:12,385 --> 00:25:13,720
I see.

453
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:16,556
Seeing myself change like this

454
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:19,809
makes me realize that motherhood

455
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:22,020
is pretty amazing.

456
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:24,856
[sighs]

457
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,942
[tender music playing]

458
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:32,155
[baby cooing]

459
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:57,013
[Da-rim gasps]

460
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,976
It's just as cool as the Grandfather Tree
in my neighborhood.

461
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,061
-[inhales deeply]
-[music stops]

462
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,188
[sighs]

463
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,234
[cart beeps]

464
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:16,533
What's that?

465
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,286
"Gong Ji-hyeok"?

466
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,455
Wait. [chuckles]

467
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,583
[Ji-hyeok] What are you doing?

468
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:29,671
[gasps] Mr. Gong, your name is here.

469
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,006
"Gong Ji-hyeok Tree."

470
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:37,887
GONG JI-HYEOK TREE
APRIL 5, 2002

471
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,518
[sentimental music playing]

472
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:46,563
[birdsong]

473
00:26:48,982 --> 00:26:49,983
[parent] Here we go.

474
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,488
All done.

475
00:26:57,866 --> 00:27:00,827
GONG JI-HYEOK TREE
APRIL 5, 2002

476
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:01,995
Okay.

477
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,496
Look over here.

478
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,500
One, two, three.

479
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:09,127
[shutter clicks]

480
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:10,587
[Da-rim gasps]

481
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,589
So it's a tree you planted
with your mother.

482
00:27:13,631 --> 00:27:14,799
It must bring back memories.

483
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:17,510
I just planted it
and never took care of it,

484
00:27:17,594 --> 00:27:19,512
but it grew up strong all on its own.

485
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:22,640
You should
bring your mother here sometime.

486
00:27:25,352 --> 00:27:26,811
I'm not sure… [sighs]

487
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,063
…if that'll be possible.

488
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,733
She's at the same hospital as your mother.

489
00:27:32,734 --> 00:27:34,152
She's been unwell for a long time.

490
00:27:35,236 --> 00:27:36,279
[sighs]

491
00:27:36,363 --> 00:27:39,366
So that's why we ran into each other
at the hospital last time.

492
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,535
It must've been tough for you as well.

493
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,622
I hope she gets better soon.

494
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:52,796
[gasps] Oh, then how about
I take a picture of you with it

495
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,130
so you can show it to your mother?

496
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,840
I'm sure she'll love it.

497
00:27:55,924 --> 00:27:57,175
Stand there.

498
00:27:57,258 --> 00:27:58,426
I'll take the picture.

499
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,596
Stand right there.

500
00:28:02,180 --> 00:28:03,473
That looks good.

501
00:28:04,432 --> 00:28:06,518
[grunts] Maybe you should pose.

502
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,144
[grunts]

503
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:11,689
That's great,

504
00:28:11,773 --> 00:28:14,109
but how about we go for something cute?

505
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,069
-Cute?
-Yes, cute.

506
00:28:18,696 --> 00:28:21,116
[grunts] That's pretty cute,

507
00:28:21,699 --> 00:28:22,826
but maybe add a cheek heart?

508
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,994
Or an ear heart,

509
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,579
-a bear heart, or a cat heart.
-[chuckling]

510
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,206
Or maybe a giant one like this.

511
00:28:29,499 --> 00:28:31,501
Stop laughing and do it.

512
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,837
Your mom will love it. [grunts]

513
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,673
Here we go.

514
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:38,007
Get ready.

515
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:40,093
He really is very handsome.

516
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:41,344
Oh, right.

517
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,470
Are you ready?

518
00:28:42,554 --> 00:28:43,888
One, two, three.

519
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,515
-So cute.
-[shutter clicks]

520
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,350
Next. One, two, three.

521
00:28:47,434 --> 00:28:48,977
-[shutter clicks]
-[Da-rim] Great.

522
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:51,521
-One, two, three.
-[exclaims]

523
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,106
What? What's wrong?

524
00:28:53,189 --> 00:28:54,315
-What happened?
-Bee! A bee!

525
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,109
-There's a bee. A bee!
-A bee? Where?

526
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,235
Where?

527
00:28:58,445 --> 00:29:00,947
-[grunts]
-[exclaims]

528
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,616
It's not a bee. It's a ladybug.

529
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,244
What on earth is so terrifying
about this tiny little thing?

530
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,246
Well…

531
00:29:08,830 --> 00:29:10,915
I experienced
a traumatic hornet sting in the past.

532
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,876
-[grunts]
-[chuckles]

533
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:16,379
Don't laugh.

534
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,089
I said don't laugh.

535
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:22,635
[chuckling] You didn't even bat an eyelash
in front of organ harvesters.

536
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,763
Childhood scars last a long time.

537
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,307
That's a childhood scar?

538
00:29:27,390 --> 00:29:29,684
-Don't make fun of me.
-Right, I'm so sorry.

539
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,353
-Wait, there's a bee! [exclaims]
-Where?

540
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,856
[Da-rim laughing]

541
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:35,940
Don't laugh.

542
00:29:36,483 --> 00:29:38,485
[whimsical music playing]

543
00:29:38,568 --> 00:29:40,320
[Da-rim] Wait, Mr. Gong,
it's a real bee this time.

544
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,821
I'm not lying. Oh no.

545
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:44,824
You're going to get stung. [exclaiming]

546
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:46,117
[Ji-hyeok] Stop it!

547
00:29:46,201 --> 00:29:47,577
-[Da-rim] Let's go catch it!
-Stop it!

548
00:29:48,453 --> 00:29:49,662
I told you to stop.

549
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,253
It's been a while
since we came here together.

550
00:29:57,337 --> 00:29:59,214
[music fades]

551
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,757
How's your mother doing?

552
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:04,636
She has her ups and downs.

553
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,221
I hope she gets better soon.

554
00:30:06,930 --> 00:30:07,931
Recently,

555
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,434
I've been thinking a lot about the days
when she was the executive director.

556
00:30:11,518 --> 00:30:13,269
She built this park,

557
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,605
ran a tree-planting campaign,
and even raised funds

558
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,065
for environmental protection.

559
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:20,026
I took great pride in my work back then.

560
00:30:20,109 --> 00:30:23,530
It sounds like Mr. Gong's mother
did a lot of good.

561
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,325
[park keeper] But now,
they've all been discontinued,

562
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,953
and I heard they're planning to
sell this park as well.

563
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,120
Why?

564
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:34,374
Because a company's goal
is to maximize profit.

565
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,334
Without a clear guiding philosophy
at the helm,

566
00:30:36,417 --> 00:30:39,003
social responsibility activities
fall to the wayside.

567
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,713
[sighs] That's too bad.

568
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,633
It would've been nice
if they could've actively promoted

569
00:30:43,716 --> 00:30:46,553
the tree-planting campaign
and this park from the get-go.

570
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,971
Pardon?

571
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,848
If it's a similar-quality product,

572
00:30:49,931 --> 00:30:51,391
moms are bound to favor companies

573
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:55,979
that actively engage
in environmental protection efforts.

574
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:59,816
Since this is the world
their children will grow up and live in,

575
00:30:59,899 --> 00:31:01,526
they want to do their part.

576
00:31:03,653 --> 00:31:05,572
[Ji-hyeok] Why does it have
the same name as me?

577
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,990
GONG JI-HYEOK TREE

578
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,576
Because it was planted
for your sake. [chuckles]

579
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:14,622
I named it after you, wishing it'd grow
tall and strong alongside you,

580
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:16,416
while making the world a cleaner place.

581
00:31:16,958 --> 00:31:19,002
Because you're bound to be happier

582
00:31:19,085 --> 00:31:20,962
in a cleaner world.

583
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:24,340
Then we should plant a lot of trees.

584
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:26,426
So everyone can be happy.

585
00:31:31,681 --> 00:31:32,891
[Ji-hyeok] Ta-da.

586
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,225
Mom, do you remember?

587
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,352
That's the tree we planted.

588
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:38,146
This is how much it's grown.

589
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:39,731
You're right, it has. [chuckles]

590
00:31:39,814 --> 00:31:41,274
Right?

591
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:45,403
I used to live life
with such passion and energy.

592
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:47,196
[sighs]

593
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,615
It was all in vain.

594
00:31:49,115 --> 00:31:50,116
[sighs]

595
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,328
I don't even know
what's left of it anymore.

596
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,334
[Ji-hyeok] Yeah, you do.

597
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:01,377
You have me.

598
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,966
You have your son right here by your side.

599
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,344
[chuckles]

600
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:11,304
Speaking of which,

601
00:32:11,971 --> 00:32:13,556
I'm actually trying to turn that dream

602
00:32:14,515 --> 00:32:15,850
you worked so hard for

603
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,519
into reality.

604
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,522
-[sighs]
-So you need to get well quickly

605
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:23,816
and watch me do it.

606
00:32:24,525 --> 00:32:25,735
Okay?

607
00:32:27,153 --> 00:32:28,237
[chuckles]

608
00:32:30,448 --> 00:32:31,699
[inhales deeply]

609
00:32:34,661 --> 00:32:37,789
-[chuckles]
-[Ji-hyeok chuckles]

610
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:45,046
-[Da-rim] Stop moving.
-[parent chuckles]

611
00:32:45,129 --> 00:32:47,924
You're being exceptionally sweet today.

612
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:50,468
Well, you've been through a lot.

613
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:52,053
What do you mean?

614
00:32:53,096 --> 00:32:54,555
When you gave birth to me,

615
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:56,808
you must've felt so wronged

616
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,852
getting that surgery
after going through all that pain.

617
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,981
I'm apologizing for that now.

618
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:04,983
-Am I finally being rewarded for that now?
-[chuckles]

619
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:08,528
Wow, you really took your time
with that. [chuckles]

620
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,489
I heard the moms talking at work.

621
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:15,118
Just hearing about it
sounded so terrifying.

622
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,495
How did you endure all that pain?

623
00:33:19,789 --> 00:33:22,625
-When you endure all that pain…
-Yeah?

624
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:25,670
…you end up with a daughter like this.
So why wouldn't you?

625
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,005
-[exclaims]
-[chuckles]

626
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:29,507
I'd gladly give birth to you again
if I had to.

627
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:31,384
You're just too cute.

628
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:34,387
Go on.

629
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:35,972
[chuckles]

630
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,599
-Stay still, ma'am.
-Okay.

631
00:33:39,392 --> 00:33:41,436
-Careful.
-That tickles.

632
00:33:47,316 --> 00:33:49,068
-[sighs]
-[Seon-u] Just getting home?

633
00:33:49,777 --> 00:33:50,653
Yeah.

634
00:33:50,737 --> 00:33:51,779
You're late.

635
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,489
I went to see my mom.

636
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:54,407
What about dinner?

637
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:56,367
Hmm.

638
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,995
Hey, do you have ramyeon?

639
00:33:59,078 --> 00:34:01,247
That looks so good.

640
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:02,874
Bon appétit.

641
00:34:03,624 --> 00:34:04,625
[grunts]

642
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:08,171
[exclaiming]

643
00:34:08,254 --> 00:34:09,255
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

644
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,467
I guess Jun went to bed early.

645
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:14,594
Yeah, they apparently had a race
at day care today.

646
00:34:14,677 --> 00:34:15,845
He's knocked out.

647
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:17,472
He's such a cutie pie.

648
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:21,100
[exclaims] It's so spicy. Mmm.

649
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,311
[Seon-u grunts]

650
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:26,230
How's your mom doing?
I called her earlier.

651
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:28,149
The doctor said

652
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,110
she's recovering quickly
with little to no long-term complications.

653
00:34:31,194 --> 00:34:32,278
That's a relief.

654
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,405
[both sigh]

655
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,282
Hang in there.

656
00:34:36,949 --> 00:34:39,535
Seeing her get better
gives me all the energy I need.

657
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:40,995
Even work is fun.

658
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,206
Did your team leader say anything
about the money?

659
00:34:43,289 --> 00:34:44,624
He just wants the principal.

660
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:48,086
You know,

661
00:34:48,169 --> 00:34:50,505
when he was saving me
from the loan sharks,

662
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,591
he was super charismatic,
saying things like, "Do you take credit?"

663
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:56,469
But it turns out he's terrified of bugs.

664
00:34:56,552 --> 00:34:58,554
This tiny ladybug made him go frantic,
and he was all,

665
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:00,973
"Bee! There's a bee!"

666
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,226
He was freaking out. [chuckles]

667
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,728
Isn't that hilarious?

668
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,063
Was it that funny?

669
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,232
What? I thought it was.
You don't think so?

670
00:35:09,816 --> 00:35:11,609
I guess. Sure.

671
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:14,028
[Da-rim chuckling] So funny.

672
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:17,657
[Ji-hye] This quarter,

673
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:19,826
we plan to focus on
corporate image marketing.

674
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:23,746
We're planning a global marketing campaign
with international celebrities.

675
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,581
What do you think, Mr. Gong?

676
00:35:25,665 --> 00:35:26,624
[Ji-hyeok] I'm not sure.

677
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,212
Wouldn't environmental issues
be a better fit for a global campaign?

678
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:33,047
-Are you serious?
-[Chang-ho] Hold on.

679
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,425
Go on. What exactly do you propose?

680
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,804
We could revive
our discontinued tree-planting campaign

681
00:35:39,887 --> 00:35:42,473
to highlight and promote
Natural BeBe's long-standing commitment

682
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:46,352
to environmental protection
since its founding.

683
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:49,188
It's not a bad idea
for the domestic market.

684
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:53,484
But at the brink of global expansion,
we first need a solid corporate image--

685
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:56,154
That's what makes it
all the more compelling.

686
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:59,157
The global trend is pursuing
environmental protection,

687
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:01,409
social responsibility,
and transparent management

688
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,702
through ESG management.

689
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,997
Furthermore, ESG indexes
have recently started to be reflected

690
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:07,540
in the International Financial
Reporting Standards.

691
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,208
This indicates that companies

692
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,586
can now attract global investment
based on their contributions

693
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,381
to environmental protection
and social responsibility.

694
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,843
Is there anything more important
than securing funds when it comes to

695
00:36:20,303 --> 00:36:21,179
business expansion?

696
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,638
[upbeat music playing]

697
00:36:22,722 --> 00:36:23,806
[no audible dialogue]

698
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:26,684
[Chang-ho chuckles]

699
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,019
You make a good point.

700
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,938
I want to see a detailed proposal
from both of you by next week.

701
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,356
I'll decide after you present.

702
00:36:36,611 --> 00:36:38,154
-[music stops]
-[Da-rim] A competitive pitch?

703
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,531
Against the marketing team, at that?

704
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:41,657
Yes.

705
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,160
Shouldn't experts with real experience
handle that?

706
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,996
[Nan-suk] You scolded us
for being reckless,

707
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,623
but you're even more reckless than we are.

708
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:49,665
[Jin-hui] Tell me about it.

709
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:54,045
We're busy raising kids,
so we don't know anything about trends.

710
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,171
I believe this project

711
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:58,299
should be grounded
in the genuine sentiments of mothers,

712
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,259
not in fleeting trends.

713
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,594
That way,

714
00:37:01,677 --> 00:37:03,221
we'd be able to deliver a clearer

715
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,306
and more heartfelt message
from a parent's perspective.

716
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,435
Also, this idea came from our team,
so it's only right that we see it through.

717
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,312
From our team? Who?

718
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,524
Ms. Go Da-rim.

719
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:17,026
Smarter than appearances suggest.

720
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:19,570
[coworkers exclaim]

721
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:21,781
-Really?
-When did you think of that?

722
00:37:21,864 --> 00:37:22,740
I did?

723
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,742
Your talk with the CSR team leader.

724
00:37:24,825 --> 00:37:26,244
Oh, that?

725
00:37:26,327 --> 00:37:27,745
Brief the team on it

726
00:37:28,579 --> 00:37:29,997
and lead the brainstorming session.

727
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:31,791
Yes, sir. I will.

728
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:34,043
[sighs]

729
00:37:34,627 --> 00:37:35,544
Let's be sure to win…

730
00:37:39,548 --> 00:37:40,508
this presentation.

731
00:37:40,591 --> 00:37:41,592
Okay.

732
00:37:49,392 --> 00:37:51,644
Thank you for the praise earlier.

733
00:37:53,646 --> 00:37:56,565
It feels really good to hear
that I helped out the team.

734
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,401
I praised you?

735
00:37:58,484 --> 00:38:00,069
You, Ms. Go Da-rim? When?

736
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:01,946
You said I was smart.

737
00:38:02,029 --> 00:38:03,572
I was commenting on a smart brain.

738
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,700
I never said you were smart.

739
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,827
-[stammers]
-It seems you took it the wrong way.

740
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,370
[laughs]

741
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:11,455
What I praised

742
00:38:12,164 --> 00:38:13,833
was this brain here.

743
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:15,334
And who does it belong to?

744
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,502
Me.

745
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:18,629
[elevator chimes]

746
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:20,548
[Da-rim chuckles]

747
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:22,925
I guess it was self-praise.

748
00:38:25,511 --> 00:38:26,721
Of course.

749
00:38:26,804 --> 00:38:28,347
[sighs]

750
00:38:31,851 --> 00:38:33,102
-A photographer?
-[Ji-hyeok] Yeah.

751
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,520
I'm working on an ad concept,

752
00:38:34,603 --> 00:38:37,189
and I remembered you said you were
preparing for a photography exhibition.

753
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,150
I thought you might know someone talented.

754
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:41,777
It got canceled.
My dad doesn't want me to do it.

755
00:38:41,861 --> 00:38:43,571
Oh yeah? Well, that's too bad.

756
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:45,573
Wait.

757
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,199
I do know a photographer.

758
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:51,954
KIM SEON-U

759
00:38:58,586 --> 00:39:00,546
What do you think? Aren't they so nice?

760
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:01,505
Yeah.

761
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:03,966
It's natural and warm.

762
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,218
Right?

763
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,554
He's a warm person.

764
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,350
He's warm-hearted and speaks warmly too.

765
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:14,226
And his face… [chuckles]

766
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:15,978
…is just full of so much warmth.

767
00:39:16,062 --> 00:39:17,897
I think he'll fit the vibe
we're going for.

768
00:39:17,980 --> 00:39:19,231
Give me his number.

769
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:24,403
I worked my butt off
to uncover this photographer.

770
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:27,990
He was completely hidden
like some dinosaur fossil.

771
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,575
I guess you want something in return.

772
00:39:29,658 --> 00:39:31,369
Let me in on that project.

773
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:36,707
[coughs]

774
00:39:36,791 --> 00:39:39,460
-The pressure's giving me indigestion.
-Me too.

775
00:39:39,543 --> 00:39:42,380
I'd much rather be weeding.

776
00:39:42,463 --> 00:39:44,882
I think the big budget
makes it that much worse.

777
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,134
-So much pressure.
-Mmm.

778
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:50,262
[Ma] My goodness, look who it is.

779
00:39:50,971 --> 00:39:53,808
It's our rival team. [chuckles]

780
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:57,853
So? Is your presentation
coming along well?

781
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:00,523
It's our first ad, so it's a bit daunting.

782
00:40:00,606 --> 00:40:02,233
-But still--
-Of course, it's daunting.

783
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:03,734
Most certainly.

784
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:06,946
Advertisement planning is no joke.

785
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:09,532
If every Tom, Dick, and Harry could do it,

786
00:40:09,615 --> 00:40:11,534
then why would our marketing team exist?

787
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:13,077
Don't you agree?

788
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:14,036
-Yes.
-Of course.

789
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,162
[laughing]

790
00:40:15,246 --> 00:40:16,956
What's wrong? Are you insulted?

791
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:21,001
Your loser team
was just for show from the start!

792
00:40:22,378 --> 00:40:24,088
You should just focus on

793
00:40:24,171 --> 00:40:27,508
changing those diapers
and pulling out those weeds at the park.

794
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:31,345
How dare you covet
someone else's livelihood?

795
00:40:32,388 --> 00:40:34,348
"Loser team"?
"Every Tom, Dick, and Harry"?

796
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,392
-Have you lost your damn mind?
-Calm down, Nan-suk.

797
00:40:36,475 --> 00:40:38,060
What did you say? Why this lady…

798
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,813
Do you think we're in a market
where the loudest person wins?

799
00:40:40,896 --> 00:40:42,440
This is a workplace!

800
00:40:42,523 --> 00:40:43,899
You should be competing with your skills!

801
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:45,609
Yes!

802
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,153
That's correct!

803
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:51,824
[dramatic music plays]

804
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,828
That's why we're doing
a competitive pitch,

805
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:57,204
-are we not?
-What?

806
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,040
Forget your title in the hierarchy,
which team you're on,

807
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:02,835
and whose inner circle you belong to.

808
00:41:02,918 --> 00:41:04,712
Is there anything better

809
00:41:04,795 --> 00:41:07,423
than a competitive pitch
to truly assess skill?

810
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:08,924
Right? [laughs]

811
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,968
-But that's--
-She's right!

812
00:41:11,051 --> 00:41:13,345
We're trying to compete with our skills,
so what's the issue?

813
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:16,307
Maybe they're scared of losing
their livelihoods to the loser team.

814
00:41:16,390 --> 00:41:19,477
-What? Scared? [laughs]
-That must be it.

815
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:24,273
Why would I be scared of stay-at-home moms
whose only experience is changing diapers?

816
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,358
You should

817
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,027
be scared.

818
00:41:28,611 --> 00:41:30,279
Stay-at-home moms

819
00:41:30,362 --> 00:41:32,948
are the key demographic
the marketing team should be winning over.

820
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:35,868
Now, those very ladies
are getting involved directly.

821
00:41:35,951 --> 00:41:37,495
-Right?
-Right.

822
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:38,496
Right.

823
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:41,081
Enjoy the rest of your meal then.

824
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,042
-Shall we get going now?
-Yes.

825
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:45,419
-I'm done eating.
-Yes.

826
00:41:45,503 --> 00:41:47,463
-Let's go. [chuckles]
-My goodness.

827
00:41:52,301 --> 00:41:53,302
Why those…

828
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:56,805
I ought to just…

829
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,940
Is the pressure still too much?

830
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:07,816
Screw the pressure or whatever.

831
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,277
I can't contain this anger inside me.

832
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,905
Do you still want to go weeding
in the park?

833
00:42:12,988 --> 00:42:14,073
No.

834
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:17,243
Forget the weeds.
I want to pull Ma's hair out.

835
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,452
And you, Go-eun?

836
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,246
Do you find the big budget intimidating?

837
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,914
Screw it.

838
00:42:21,997 --> 00:42:23,707
Sink or swim, we need to go for it.

839
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:24,792
Mmm.

840
00:42:26,085 --> 00:42:29,046
You've all heard of
this saying before, right?

841
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,800
Those who seek death shall live,
and those who seek life shall die.

842
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,011
Let's go!

843
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:39,098
[uplifting music playing]

844
00:42:50,526 --> 00:42:53,153
-[Da-rim] You're right. I agree.
-[Go-eun] Something like this.

845
00:42:54,363 --> 00:42:57,366
[no audible dialogue]

846
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,077
Oh.

847
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:10,713
[music continues]

848
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:41,744
Here you go.

849
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:53,922
Okay.

850
00:43:55,799 --> 00:43:57,051
Found it!

851
00:43:57,134 --> 00:43:58,594
This is it.

852
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:02,431
Look at this. Right here.

853
00:44:02,514 --> 00:44:03,974
AN EYE-CATCHING AD COPY

854
00:44:04,058 --> 00:44:05,893
SHOW WHY PLANTING TREES
BENEFITS OUR KIDS!

855
00:44:11,523 --> 00:44:15,319
KEY WORDS: TREE, HEALTH, LOVE

856
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:21,283
-We're done!
-[music stops]

857
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:22,743
-Finally!
-It looks amazing!

858
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,244
-You haven't eaten yet, right?
-Oh, my gosh!

859
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:26,914
[team cheers]

860
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:34,296
[upbeat music playing]

861
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:40,260
A GREEN FUTURE WE DRAW TOGETHER

862
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:42,012
GROWING UP MEANS BECOMING STRONGER
WITHOUT ANYONE NOTICING

863
00:44:44,306 --> 00:44:45,683
[music stops]

864
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,941
-We brought tteokbokki and fried sides!
-[squealing]

865
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:56,026
-Let's eat.
-No, stop!

866
00:44:56,110 --> 00:44:57,361
-Not here.
-I'll take them over there.

867
00:44:57,444 --> 00:44:58,362
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

868
00:44:58,445 --> 00:45:00,447
-[laughing]
-[music continues]

869
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,994
[Gyeong-min] Where are the plates again?

870
00:45:06,078 --> 00:45:06,912
Over here.

871
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,378
Mmm.

872
00:45:15,629 --> 00:45:16,797
The concept looks good.

873
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:17,798
A GREEN FUTURE WE DRAW TOGETHER

874
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,174
The copies are also excellent.

875
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,759
The sample shoot
is all we have left now, right?

876
00:45:21,468 --> 00:45:22,594
Have you contacted the photographer?

877
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,054
Yes. He agreed to do it.

878
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,472
I set up a meeting as well.

879
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,641
Okay. Great.

880
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:30,477
What? Where are you going to work?

881
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:33,188
-Have you lost your mind?
-[groans]

882
00:45:33,272 --> 00:45:34,106
[sighs]

883
00:45:34,189 --> 00:45:37,943
I mean, the offer was too good
to turn down.

884
00:45:38,026 --> 00:45:40,404
A big corporate project
would also look good on my resume.

885
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:44,867
[groans] I mean,
who am I to tell you what to do?

886
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:46,910
I don't want to
stand in the way of your career.

887
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:48,662
But just thinking about it

888
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,914
is suffocating.

889
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:55,210
Maybe my being there
could help you ease up a bit.

890
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:58,172
If everyone knows I'm your husband,
it'll clear up all the doubts.

891
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,299
But that won't be the case, will it?

892
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,844
I feel like our awkward acting
will just give it all away.

893
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:05,637
"Awkward acting"?

894
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,807
Did you forget I played Romeo
in my high school drama club?

895
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:12,311
The competition
was a whopping 12 to 1 back then.

896
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:13,979
Don't worry about my acting skills.

897
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:17,399
Just look at yourself.
How could I not worry?

898
00:46:17,483 --> 00:46:19,276
You must've lost your mind!

899
00:46:19,359 --> 00:46:22,905
You'd better stay on your toes,
or we're both done for.

900
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:25,032
-You hear me?
-Don't worry about my acting skills!

901
00:46:25,616 --> 00:46:27,618
I seriously can't believe you!

903
00:46:32,164 --> 00:46:33,373
What?

[grunts]

905
00:46:34,541 --> 00:46:35,417
Hello.

908
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,384
Hey! [groans]

909
00:46:44,885 --> 00:46:45,886
Hold on.

910
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,304
What is it?

911
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,347
Let's just stay here for a bit.

912
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,353

[elevator chimes]

914
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:01,026
-The elevator's here. Let's go.
-Hey!

915
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,152
Please hold the door!

916
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,737
[music stops]

917
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:08,867
You could've just dropped her off
at the building entrance.

918
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,619
She's not a child, you know.

919
00:47:11,745 --> 00:47:12,663
[sighs]

920
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,540
I'm also on my way to work.

921
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,334
Here.

922
00:47:18,252 --> 00:47:20,837
I have a meeting with Mr. Kang Gyeong-min.

923
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,464
Why would you meet with Mr. Kang?

924
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:24,341
I look forward to working with you.

925
00:47:25,759 --> 00:47:27,052
I'm Kim Seon-u.

926
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:37,229
My wife told me what you did.

927
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:39,523
I don't know how to thank you.

928
00:47:40,566 --> 00:47:42,484
We'll pay you back as soon as we can.

929
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,152
Forget the money.

930
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,531
Were you aware
of just how much danger she was in?

931
00:47:49,825 --> 00:47:50,867
She was, wasn't she?

932
00:47:50,951 --> 00:47:53,287
My wife can be quite stubborn.

933
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:55,539
I told her repeatedly
that I'd come pick her up,

934
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:58,584
but she stopped me because she didn't know
when she'd be done with work.

935
00:47:58,667 --> 00:48:01,837
We actually had our first fight
as a married couple because of that.

936
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:06,300
-"First"?
-Yes, our first.

937
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:11,179
Oh, I see.

938
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:14,558
You've never fought before.

939
00:48:16,184 --> 00:48:18,228
My friend fought with his wife,

940
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,648
and his wife even ran away to Jeju
for a few days.

941
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,069
[scoffs] That would never happen with us.

942
00:48:26,153 --> 00:48:29,740
My Rim can't even sleep
without me by her side.

943
00:48:34,328 --> 00:48:35,329
[scoffs]

944
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:37,914
[Ha-yeong] Excuse me.

945
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:42,336
[mystical music plays]

946
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,763
Where's Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok's office?

947
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,183
He's in the middle of a meeting right now.

948
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,685
Do you have an appointment?

949
00:48:58,769 --> 00:48:59,978
It's fine.

950
00:49:00,062 --> 00:49:02,314
I don't need to make one to see him.

951
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:06,485
[knocks on door]

952
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:10,739
Mr. Gong, you have a guest.

953
00:49:11,406 --> 00:49:12,616
Thanks,

954
00:49:12,699 --> 00:49:13,867
honey.

955
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,536
"Honey"?

956
00:49:16,620 --> 00:49:18,372
[mischievous music playing]

957
00:49:23,752 --> 00:49:24,586
[Ji-hyeok] Hey, Ha-yeong.

958
00:49:25,462 --> 00:49:26,546
What brings you here?

959
00:49:28,423 --> 00:49:30,842
I came by because I heard
you were having your first meeting.

960
00:49:34,930 --> 00:49:36,139
[sighs]

961
00:49:36,223 --> 00:49:39,267
[grunts] Deputy Director Yu was the one
who introduced Mr. Kim to me.

962
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:40,394
Mmm.

963
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:41,853
And this is

964
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:46,024
a member of my team and Mr. Kim's wife,
Ms. Go Da-rim.

965
00:49:46,108 --> 00:49:48,777
It's nice to meet you. I'm Go Da-rim.

966
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,738
You're his wife?

967
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,448
-His wife?
-Ms. Yu?

968
00:49:56,326 --> 00:49:59,037
There's a work matter

969
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:00,372
I'd like to discuss with you.

970
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:03,834
We're going to step out for a quick chat.

971
00:50:04,418 --> 00:50:06,044
-Sure.
-Let's go.

972
00:50:06,128 --> 00:50:07,671
Come with me.

973
00:50:07,754 --> 00:50:08,755
Please excuse us.

974
00:50:08,839 --> 00:50:09,923
Let's go.

975
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:16,221
-[music stops]
-I mean, still,

976
00:50:16,304 --> 00:50:17,806
how could you pretend to be married?

977
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:18,807
[shushes]

978
00:50:18,890 --> 00:50:20,100
[whispering] Wait.

979
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,017
Just hold on.

980
00:50:21,977 --> 00:50:25,313
Her mother practically saved my life.

981
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:29,109
I knew it was wrong, but I had to help.

982
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,864
Could you keep this a secret?

983
00:50:33,947 --> 00:50:34,906
Please.

984
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:39,536
So you're saying
this is for her mother's sake

985
00:50:39,619 --> 00:50:41,163
and not for her sake, right?

986
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:44,291
Right.

987
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:48,503
Then that means you two are definitely,
certainly, positively, absolutely

988
00:50:49,045 --> 00:50:50,297
just friends, right?

989
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:53,008
Yes.

990
00:50:53,091 --> 00:50:55,552
[mischievous music playing]

991
00:50:57,846 --> 00:50:58,847
[sighs]

992
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:01,349
That's quite an unfortunate situation,

993
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,353
but my conscience will simply not allow me
to overlook a crime.

994
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:07,939
[sighs]

995
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:11,234
However, I could turn a blind eye
depending on how you do.

996
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,195
What do I need to do?

997
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:15,238
I'll do anything. Just say the word.

998
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,538
[music stops]

999
00:51:23,622 --> 00:51:25,499
If it makes you uncomfortable,

1000
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:27,834
I could tell my husband to quit.

1001
00:51:29,419 --> 00:51:30,253
I'm fine.

1002
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:33,381
If anyone is uncomfortable, it'd be you.

1003
00:51:34,257 --> 00:51:37,385
Unlike someone, I don't have a partner,
nor have I done anything wrong.

1004
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,554
I'm very relaxed.

1005
00:51:40,847 --> 00:51:43,934
You must be worried
I'll snitch to your husband.

1006
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:45,727
But don't worry.

1007
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,147
Meddling in my team members'
personal affairs,

1008
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:51,024
mm-mmm,

1009
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,651
is not my cup of tea.

1010
00:51:53,318 --> 00:51:56,613
I didn't mean it like that,

1011
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:58,448
but thank you anyway.

1012
00:51:58,532 --> 00:52:01,076
If I say I'll forget it, I forget it.

1013
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,745
A mistake.

1014
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:05,038
A sort of accident.

1015
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:08,208
A game of ping-pong with a stranger.

1016
00:52:09,584 --> 00:52:11,336
I don't even remember such things.

1017
00:52:11,419 --> 00:52:12,629
I see.

1018
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,675
He remembers every single thing.

1020
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,472
[Gyeong-min]
What a small world we live in.

1021
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,100
Who knew you'd be Ms. Go's husband?

1022
00:52:25,183 --> 00:52:27,102
[Nan-suk]
You two make such a great couple.

1023
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:30,021
-The perfect-looking couple.
-[Jin-hui] My thoughts exactly.

1024
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:32,524
And you two sort of resemble one another.

1025
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:35,902
We've been friends since we were kids.

1026
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,154
I guess we've grown
to resemble one another

1027
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:40,657
-after all those long years.
-Mm-hmm.

1028
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,076
[Jin-hui] How did you go
from being childhood friends

1029
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:46,329
to lovers, and then, partners?

1030
00:52:46,413 --> 00:52:49,791
Mmm… Well, you see, what happened was…

1031
00:52:49,875 --> 00:52:51,001
It was just--

1032
00:52:51,084 --> 00:52:54,087
I didn't know at first
because we were longtime friends,

1033
00:52:54,170 --> 00:52:57,007
but I eventually realized
that I had fallen for her.

1034
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:58,967
And I had fallen for her hard.

1035
00:52:59,885 --> 00:53:01,219
It was one-sided for a while,

1036
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:03,930
but when I saw her with someone else,
I couldn't stand it anymore.

1037
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,932
So I confessed.

1038
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,517
[coworkers exclaim]

1039
00:53:07,601 --> 00:53:09,436
[Nan-suk] Why am I getting butterflies?

1040
00:53:09,519 --> 00:53:12,522
Are you sure you've been married
for seven years? [exclaims]

1041
00:53:13,398 --> 00:53:14,733
[Gyeong-min] Sorry about that.

1042
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:16,484
-What was that for?
-You just flew.

1043
00:53:16,568 --> 00:53:17,611
That's enough chitchat.

1044
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,488
This is Deputy Director Yu Ha-yeong
from Taeyu Art Hall.

1045
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,157
She'll be organizing
a photography exhibition

1046
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:23,408
in association with this campaign.

1047
00:53:23,491 --> 00:53:24,784
Hello.

1048
00:53:24,868 --> 00:53:27,162
We've decided to take part
because we liked the campaign's objective.

1049
00:53:27,245 --> 00:53:31,166
We especially plan to support Mr. Kim
as much as we can,

1050
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,543
so please let me know
if you ever need anything.

1051
00:53:33,627 --> 00:53:35,795
[Gyeong-min]
Then could you provide support

1052
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,964
for the ad concept shoot
for the presentation?

1053
00:53:38,048 --> 00:53:41,927
We might need to go on a business trip
for some on-site shooting.

1054
00:53:42,010 --> 00:53:42,886
Of course.

1055
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:46,264
We'll cover all expenses,
wherever it may be.

1056
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:49,267
We'll even cover an overnight trip.

1057

00:53:57,233 --> 00:53:58,068
-Hey.
-Yeah?

1061
00:53:58,151 --> 00:54:00,111
-You're a pretty good actor.
-[scoffs]

1062
00:54:00,195 --> 00:54:01,738
I almost thought you really liked me.

1063
00:54:01,821 --> 00:54:03,031
-Did you?
-[chuckles]

1064
00:54:03,114 --> 00:54:05,825
How did you come up
with such a love story on the spot?

1065
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,453
Oh, Romeo!

1066
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,247
Do you feel more relaxed now?

1067
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:12,624
Yeah.

1068
00:54:12,707 --> 00:54:14,125
Thanks, my friend.

1069
00:54:14,209 --> 00:54:15,752
[chuckles]

1070
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:21,758
[gasps] Babe, I'll see you at home later.

1071
00:54:21,841 --> 00:54:23,134
-Okay.
-Ms. Go Da-rim.

1072
00:54:23,218 --> 00:54:24,678
-[elevator chimes]
-You don't have to do that in front--

1073
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,804
The elevator!

1074
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:30,016
It's here.

1075
00:54:32,644 --> 00:54:33,728
SHH, IT'S A SECRET!

1076
00:54:33,812 --> 00:54:36,147
-Why did you cut me off?
-Well…

1077
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:37,774
Ms. Yu.

1078
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,110
Since you said you'd keep it a secret,

1079
00:54:40,193 --> 00:54:43,113
can you just pretend you don't know
in front of Da-rim as well?

1080
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,782
Why? You don't need to act in front of me.

1081
00:54:45,865 --> 00:54:49,411
She may not look it,
but she's really soft-hearted and timid.

1082
00:54:50,495 --> 00:54:51,955
If she knows you know,

1083
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,165
it'll only make her nervous
and get her to mess up.

1084
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:59,546
So I'd appreciate it
if we could just keep it between us.

1085
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,798
How incredibly considerate of you.

1086
00:55:03,633 --> 00:55:04,759
[sighs]

1087
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,263
-Then make time for me today.
-Today?

1088
00:55:09,806 --> 00:55:11,933
I thought of something I want to do.

1089
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,394
Take my first birthday photos.

1090
00:55:16,021 --> 00:55:17,439
[Seon-u] Fill this out for me.

1091
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,065
What's this?

1092
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:22,777
You just have to write down things
that make you smile.

1093
00:55:22,861 --> 00:55:24,571
Things that make me smile?

1094
00:55:26,906 --> 00:55:28,742
[shutter clicking]

1095
00:55:29,325 --> 00:55:31,286
[heartwarming music playing]

1096

FIDE, BABIES, HORSEBACK RIDING,
ACOUSTIC GUITAR,

1097
00:55:33,371 --> 00:55:35,790
BEETHOVEN, QUOKKAS, A KIND AND WARM PERSON

1098
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:39,294
All right.

1099
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:41,755
[sighs]

1100
00:55:44,007 --> 00:55:46,092
Should we have a little chat?

1101
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:47,552
How's my pose?

1102
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:48,762
First time riding one?

1103
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:51,598
[scoffs] I've been riding horses
since I was six.

1104
00:55:51,681 --> 00:55:52,932
How did it feel

1105
00:55:53,933 --> 00:55:54,934
when you first rode one?

1106
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,770
Hmm, it was really fun.

1107
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:59,314
I was really good at connecting
with my horse.

1108
00:55:59,397 --> 00:56:02,358
My horse is so cute. I miss it.

1109
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:03,401
Where is it now?

1110
00:56:03,485 --> 00:56:05,028
In Jeju Island.

1111
00:56:05,820 --> 00:56:08,323
They're all so cute. I miss them so much.

1112
00:56:08,406 --> 00:56:10,909
-[music intensifies]
-[no audible dialogue]

1113
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,124
Why did you want
a first birthday photo shoot?

1114
00:56:59,207 --> 00:57:00,625
Don't you already have photos from then?

1115
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:04,003
-I don't. My parents were always busy.
-[music fades]

1116
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:06,589
When I was little,
I was almost always alone.

1117
00:57:06,673 --> 00:57:07,715
Well, the housekeeper was there.

1118
00:57:08,299 --> 00:57:10,552
That's why I thought
I should at least take them now.

1119
00:57:10,635 --> 00:57:13,471
They're all pretty similar.
I don't know what to choose.

1120
00:57:16,724 --> 00:57:17,559
[grunts]

1121
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:19,352
Can I see that for a second?

1122
00:57:21,146 --> 00:57:23,440
-[tender music playing]
-I think…

1123
00:57:24,315 --> 00:57:26,943
this one, this one,

1124
00:57:27,527 --> 00:57:29,529
and this one are the best.

1125
00:57:31,823 --> 00:57:33,283
Oh, really?

1126
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:34,826
You think so?

1127
00:57:35,493 --> 00:57:36,661
Yes, they're pretty.

1128
00:57:42,125 --> 00:57:43,418
Why?

1129
00:57:43,501 --> 00:57:45,962
Why are they pretty?

1130
00:57:46,713 --> 00:57:47,839
You're smiling.

1131
00:57:51,176 --> 00:57:52,802
You really look like a baby

1132
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:54,512
when you smile big like that.

1133
00:57:55,638 --> 00:57:58,183
Since this is
my first birthday photo shoot,

1134
00:57:58,266 --> 00:58:00,435
I'll go with the ones
where I look like a baby.

1135
00:58:00,518 --> 00:58:01,603
Okay.

1136
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:04,772
Then, this one, this one, and this one.

1137
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:07,108
I'll print those three for you.

1138
00:58:07,192 --> 00:58:09,694
[grunts] We're done, right?

1139
00:58:09,777 --> 00:58:11,154
No, not yet.

1140
00:58:11,237 --> 00:58:13,531
I want to make an album.

1141
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:14,616
The one that carries 22 photos.

1142
00:58:16,159 --> 00:58:17,160
Uh…

1143
00:58:18,203 --> 00:58:20,371
I have a reservation coming up.

1144
00:58:20,455 --> 00:58:21,706
I'm not taking them all today.

1145
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:24,834
I'll decide the time, location,
and concept.

1146
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:27,086
You just need to show up
and take the pictures.

1147
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:30,632
That means we have 19 more to go.

1148
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:33,635
-[Nan-suk] You already know, right?
-Guys, hold on.

1149
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,386
[Nan-suk] If you all have kids,
you already know.

1150
00:58:35,470 --> 00:58:36,763
-Of course.
-Big movements.

1151
00:58:36,846 --> 00:58:38,389
-Movements need to be big.
-Yes, that's right.

1152
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:40,350
We're going with an eco-friendly concept.

1153
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,185
-Yes, that's what we're going for.
-That's right.

1154
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,270

Come this way!

[cheering]

1159
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:54,864
Amazing! Keep going!

1160
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,282
That's it!

-[cheering]
-[playful music playing]

1162

Keep going!

1163
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:05,375
Who wants to follow these?

1164
00:59:05,458 --> 00:59:09,420
Who wants to follow me?
Who wants to catch them?

-[cheering]
-[children giggling]

1166
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:17,637
Let's take a short break.

1167
00:59:17,720 --> 00:59:19,097
-Okay.
-Let's take a break, kids.

1168
00:59:19,180 --> 00:59:21,516
Let's go and take a break.

1169

-[music stops]
-Kids.

1170

Kim Seon-u.

1171
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:30,066
-That's great.
-Don't take my picture.

1172
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:31,109
It's nice. Keep going.

1173

[both laughing]

1174
00:59:32,944 --> 00:59:33,778
Take a look.

1175
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:36,573
-What is that?
-It came out well.

1176
00:59:37,532 --> 00:59:40,076
You're pretty cool today. A total pro.

1177
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,079
That's nothing new.
You've seen me work before.

1178
00:59:43,162 --> 00:59:45,790
But still, it's definitely different
seeing you outside of the studio.

1179
00:59:45,873 --> 00:59:46,874
-Hold on.
-What?

1180
00:59:46,958 --> 00:59:50,503
-You have something here.
-Thanks.

1181
00:59:51,004 --> 00:59:53,590
-Then take a pretty shot of me.

-Try jumping.

1183

That's good.

1184
00:59:56,968 --> 00:59:58,511
Have some more fun.

1185

-You call that just being friends?
-[Seon-u] Hold on.

1188
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,978
Mr. Kim, let's eat before we continue.

[exclaims] The air is no good here.

1190
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:12,442

-[Gyeong-min] That's refreshing.
-My goodness, that's good.

It's been forever
since I've had such a feast.

1197
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:25,997
It feels like it's my birthday.

1198
01:00:26,080 --> 01:00:27,081
It'll be my treat today,

1199
01:00:27,165 --> 01:00:29,250
-so please enjoy to your heart's content.
-Will do.

1200
01:00:29,334 --> 01:00:30,752
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1201
01:00:30,835 --> 01:00:32,795
[Nan-suk] It's been years
since I've eaten out

1202
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:34,005
without having to look after the kids.

1203
01:00:34,088 --> 01:00:37,216
What do you say
to just one business trip every week?

1204
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,802
-Should we? [laughs]
-[coworkers laugh]

1205
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,138
-[Seon-u] Da-rim, there's no meat there.
-Yeah?

1206
01:00:42,221 --> 01:00:44,641
-[Jin-hui] Nan-suk, this is so tasty.
-Is it? [chuckles]

1207
01:00:45,433 --> 01:00:47,101
-[Jin-hui] Abalones.
-[Nan-suk] Thank you.

1208
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,437
[in English] Thank you.

1209
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,360
[in Korean] Mr. Kim, you should eat too.

1210
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:58,237
You worked the hardest today,
but you're only taking care of your wife.

1211
01:00:58,321 --> 01:00:59,947
Sorry, it's just become a habit.

1212
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,700
Eat up, honey.

1213
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:04,952
Honey…

1214
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:12,794
You too, honey.

1215
01:01:14,003 --> 01:01:16,047
[Nan-suk] They're just
overflowing with love.

1216
01:01:16,130 --> 01:01:17,340
I saw it earlier during the shoot too.

1217
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:19,467
Where can you even find
a husband like that?

1218
01:01:19,550 --> 01:01:21,719
When a husband treats his wife
as well as he does,

1219
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:23,971
it's for one of two reasons.

1220
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,599
Number one, he's not human. He's an angel.

1221
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:30,353
Or number two, he has a huge secret
he's hiding from his wife.

1222
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:37,402
[mischievous music plays]

1223
01:01:37,485 --> 01:01:40,279
What could he be hiding?
It's not like he's cheating on her.

1224
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,489
Of course.

1225
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,409
He's totally an angel. That's it.

1226
01:01:44,492 --> 01:01:47,328
-I'm an angel?
-Of course.

1227
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:48,621
[Seon-u chuckles]

1228
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:50,289
That's not true.

1229
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:52,041
The real angel

1230
01:01:52,792 --> 01:01:56,045
-is right here.
-[chuckles]

1231
01:01:56,129 --> 01:01:58,840
-[Nan-suk] Forget it. Let's just drink.
-Drink up.

1232
01:01:58,923 --> 01:02:01,134
-What did I just see? Geez.
-Unbelievable.

1233
01:02:01,217 --> 01:02:02,760
Drink up, Nan-suk.

1234
01:02:03,761 --> 01:02:04,679
[Nan-suk] Geez.

1235
01:02:14,897 --> 01:02:15,898
[Seon-u] How pretty.

1236
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,109
[clears throat]

1237
01:02:18,192 --> 01:02:20,862
This is the perfect weather
for a first birthday photo shoot.

1238
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,530
Ms. Yu?

1239
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:26,117
I thought this floral background
would be perfect.

1240
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:27,493
Right now?

1241
01:02:27,577 --> 01:02:30,288
Yes, I decide the time,
location, and concept.

1242
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:33,082
And you take the pictures, no matter what.
That was our agreement, no?

1243
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:34,834
That's right.

1244
01:02:38,796 --> 01:02:40,798
[sighs]

1245
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,011
[gentle music playing]

1246
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:50,641
[groans]

1247
01:02:51,267 --> 01:02:52,477
I'm getting tipsy.

1248
01:02:54,103 --> 01:02:55,646
I need some fresh air.

1249
01:02:56,522 --> 01:02:58,775
[Nan-suk] Da-rim, where are you going?

1250
01:02:58,858 --> 01:03:00,067
I just need some fresh air.

1251
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:01,736
Have a drink with me when you come back.

1252
01:03:01,819 --> 01:03:04,447
-Okay.
-[Jin-hui] You drank too much, huh?

1253
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:06,824
Is Da-rim a lightweight?

1254
01:03:06,908 --> 01:03:08,409
[Gyeong-min] I don't think so.

1255
01:03:08,493 --> 01:03:10,870
[Nan-suk laughs] Look at her pretending!

1256
01:03:10,953 --> 01:03:12,371
[coworkers laughing]

1257
01:03:15,374 --> 01:03:17,794
-Goodness, Mr. Gong!
-[music stops]

1258
01:03:17,877 --> 01:03:20,129
-I must pour you a drink.
-[mischievous music playing]

1259
01:03:20,213 --> 01:03:22,006
I need to have a heart-to-heart with you.

1260
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:24,842
Bottoms up.

1261
01:03:24,926 --> 01:03:27,011
-What a man.
-[exclaims]

1262
01:03:27,094 --> 01:03:29,514
You need to pour me one too, Mr. Gong.

1263
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,973
Thank you.

1264
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,850
-Gosh, it looks so tasty.
-Me too!

1265
01:03:32,934 --> 01:03:34,519
-Me too.
-Me too.

1266
01:03:34,602 --> 01:03:36,020
I really need to use the bathroom.

1267
01:03:38,105 --> 01:03:40,149
-Good. That's good.
-[music fades]

1268
01:03:42,735 --> 01:03:45,071
-How are they?
-Just a moment.

1269
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:49,158
They're coming out a bit dark.

1270
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,868
Let's do it next time
with better lighting.

1271
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:53,371
Okay.

1272
01:03:53,454 --> 01:03:54,580
Let's go.

1273
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:58,167
You'll need to share a room
with Ms. Go tonight.

1274
01:03:58,251 --> 01:03:59,210
Will you be okay?

1275
01:03:59,293 --> 01:04:02,213
Yes, I'll be fine.
We've been friends for over 20 years.

1276
01:04:02,922 --> 01:04:04,340
That's why it's unsafe…

1277
01:04:04,423 --> 01:04:06,634
I mean, more uncomfortable.

1278
01:04:07,885 --> 01:04:10,179
How about you come out later?

1279
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:11,472
I'll get you another room.

1280
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,891
-You don't have to do--
-I don't like it.

1281
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:17,728
[poignant music playing]

1282
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:22,650
Where is she?

1283
01:04:23,901 --> 01:04:24,735
Geez.

1284
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:29,532
What's going on? Are they fighting?

1285
01:04:30,616 --> 01:04:32,702
[sighs]

1286
01:04:47,216 --> 01:04:49,385
[Da-rim] Here you are, Mr. Gong.

1287
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,609
Oh, you must've also needed some fresh--

1288
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:15,536
[music fades]

1289
01:05:17,788 --> 01:05:19,790
[romantic music playing]

1290
01:05:41,604 --> 01:05:46,525
DYNAMITE KISS

1291
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,058
What's with you? You look like someone
who desperately needs the bathroom.

1292
01:06:19,141 --> 01:06:20,851
[Ji-hyeok] Did you two come together?

1293
01:06:20,935 --> 01:06:22,895
[gasps] You sure about this?

1294
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,355
-It makes it thrilling.
-Naughty boy.

1295
01:06:24,438 --> 01:06:26,232
[Ji-hyeok]
They both must've lost their minds.

1296
01:06:26,315 --> 01:06:28,693
[Seon-u] What do you think of me as a man?

1297
01:06:28,776 --> 01:06:30,695
[Ha-yeong] Ji-hyeok,
I have a crush on someone.

1298
01:06:30,778 --> 01:06:32,738
[Ji-hyeok] I saw you
and Kim Seon-u kissing.

1299
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,657
[gasps] This is driving me crazy.

1300
01:06:34,740 --> 01:06:37,702
[Ji-hyeok] Ms. Go is just
an ordinary woman and mother.

1301
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:39,495
Why are you even worried about her?

1302
01:06:40,496 --> 01:06:41,706
Because she's my team member.

1303
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,918
