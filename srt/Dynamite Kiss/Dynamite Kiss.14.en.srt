1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,635
FINALE

3
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,262
You haven't texted me all day.

4
00:00:55,180 --> 00:00:57,015
Here you are
just recording yourself again.

5
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,893
Are you

6
00:01:00,602 --> 00:01:01,728
leaving already, babe?

7
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:03,772
I'll miss you so much through the night.

8
00:01:04,564 --> 00:01:06,274
We can go home together.

9
00:01:06,858 --> 00:01:08,610
I really want to go with you,

10
00:01:08,693 --> 00:01:10,570
but I still have a lot of work to do.

11
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:11,821
You should go home.

12
00:01:12,739 --> 00:01:13,698
Go first, okay?

13
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:14,657
See you tomorrow!

14
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:27,670
I'm going home first.

15
00:01:29,172 --> 00:01:30,131
I'm really leaving.

16
00:01:34,427 --> 00:01:35,762
I just want to

17
00:01:36,805 --> 00:01:38,181
chat and laugh with you every day.

18
00:01:39,599 --> 00:01:41,059
As soon as my mom's stuff gets sorted out…

19
00:01:41,142 --> 00:01:42,018
Did I really say that?

20
00:01:42,101 --> 00:01:43,603
…I'm going to propose to you.

21
00:01:45,188 --> 00:01:46,189
I love you, Go Da-rim.

22
00:02:58,511 --> 00:02:59,554
The next item on the agenda

23
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:01,639
is the motion to appoint
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

24
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
as vice president.

25
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:06,144
We assume you've reviewed
the materials provided outlining

26
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:10,356
his qualifications and the rationale
for his appointment as vice president.

27
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,734
We will now proceed to the vote.

28
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,736
Just a moment.

29
00:03:20,491 --> 00:03:23,703
Before proceeding,
I'd like to present a new agenda item.

30
00:03:30,919 --> 00:03:32,587
ITEM NO. 1: MOTHER TF TEAM LEADER GONG'S
APPOINTMENT TO VICE PRESIDENT

31
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:36,299
A major incident occurred
at Natural BeBe recently.

32
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:37,800
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

33
00:03:37,884 --> 00:03:40,511
had been romantically involved
with his subordinate,

34
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:43,514
and he overlooked the fact that
she lied to secure her position.

35
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,601
That subordinate turned out
to be a corporate spy,

36
00:03:46,684 --> 00:03:50,271
and she leaked details of our new product
to a competitor.

37
00:03:57,612 --> 00:03:59,322
Even with that knowledge,
Chairman Gong Chang-ho

38
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,241
covered up the incident

39
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,409
to protect his son.

40
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:07,497
To the shareholders watching online,

41
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,916
this is the true nature of these two men.

42
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:12,794
That's not all.

43
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:16,256
Chairman Gong misappropriated
funds for personal use,

44
00:04:16,339 --> 00:04:19,050
committing serious embezzlement
and breaching his fiduciary duty.

45
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,844
Furthermore, he has a history
of abusing his wife, Kim In-ae,

46
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:25,139
who's also one of the company founders
and former executive director,

47
00:04:25,682 --> 00:04:28,101
going so far as to confine her
in a psychiatric hospital.

48
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:33,273
On the screen, you'll see the evidence
supporting these statements.

49
00:04:33,356 --> 00:04:35,566
PATIENT NAME: KIM IN-AE
GUARDIAN NAME: GONG CHANG-HO

50
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:00,842
She prepared it so thoroughly.

51
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,097
Therefore, I'd like to propose
a special vote regarding the dismissal

52
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,767
of Chairman Gong Chang-ho
and Mother TF Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

53
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,103
Please cast your votes now.

54
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:37,920
IN FAVOR: 91%

55
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,505
VOTE RESULTS

56
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:44,594
That satisfies the two-thirds
vote requirement

57
00:05:44,677 --> 00:05:46,137
of the attending shareholders.

58
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:55,229
Now, let's get in there.

59
00:05:57,607 --> 00:05:58,983
Careful.

60
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:03,529
Now, the rest of the shareholders
will cast their--

61
00:06:07,492 --> 00:06:08,618
-What's this noise?
-Jeez.

62
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,496
Ms. Gong.

63
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,123
I emailed the files to MomsJoy

64
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,667
from Go Da-rim's account.

65
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,883
It's Team Leader Gong.

66
00:06:51,369 --> 00:06:52,995
Everyone's gone for the day.

67
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:03,339
SUBJECT: BABY CARRIER PROJECT
SENDER: GO DA-RIM

68
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:05,633
MAIL SENT

69
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,926
Ms. Gong.

70
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,970
I emailed the files to MomsJoy

71
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,514
from Go Da-rim's account.

72
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:20,273
The voice you've just heard belongs
to Ma Jong-gu, the marketing team leader.

73
00:07:20,857 --> 00:07:21,816
Damn it.

74
00:07:21,899 --> 00:07:23,401
And he was reporting

75
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:25,403
to Director Gong Ji-hye.

76
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,997
To slander my name,

77
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,291
Ms. Gong intentionally leaked
company secrets to a competitor.

78
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:41,169
This is a blatant obstruction
of business operations

79
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,503
and a breach of fiduciary duty.

80
00:07:43,337 --> 00:07:45,465
I filed a formal complaint
against Ms. Gong

81
00:07:46,048 --> 00:07:47,175
with the police yesterday.

82
00:07:49,218 --> 00:07:53,264
Furthermore, Ms. Gong also has ties
to the fire that broke out

83
00:07:53,347 --> 00:07:55,766
at the photography exhibition
held alongside Natural BeBe's campaign.

84
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:56,851
I'd also like to let you know

85
00:07:57,435 --> 00:07:59,562
that the police are currently
investigating the allegations

86
00:07:59,645 --> 00:08:02,899
suggesting that Yu Tae-yeong,
Taeyu C&T's eldest son,

87
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:06,486
may have been the mastermind
behind both these incidents.

88
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,446
I only did what I was told to do

89
00:08:09,071 --> 00:08:10,198
at the Taeyu Art Hall exhibition incident.

90
00:08:11,824 --> 00:08:13,034
I was going to be paid.

91
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,871
I got the blueprints for the art hall
from Yu Tae-yeong.

92
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,788
What's going on here?

93
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:26,506
So?

94
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:27,423
What now?

95
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:30,009
That doesn't change the fact that
you were seduced by a woman

96
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,469
and covered for her fraudulent employment,

97
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,056
and that your father
committed embezzlement

98
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,849
and breach of fiduciary duty.

99
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,895
Neither you nor Chairman Gong
is qualified to run this company.

100
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:41,854
Got that?

101
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:44,774
By shares or by any measure,
this company belongs to--

102
00:08:44,857 --> 00:08:45,816
Yes, that's right.

103
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,779
There's someone else more qualified

104
00:08:50,947 --> 00:08:51,864
to run this company.

105
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,075
It's…

106
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:56,077
her.

107
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,204
Hello, shareholders.

108
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:44,250
It's been a long while
since I've stood before you.

109
00:09:46,335 --> 00:09:47,878
I'm the founding director of Natural BeBe,

110
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:49,880
Kim In-ae.

111
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:58,055
As Director Gong Ji-hye mentioned earlier,

112
00:09:58,681 --> 00:10:02,518
I've been the victim
of Chairman Gong Chang-ho's abuse

113
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:04,103
for over ten years.

114
00:10:04,979 --> 00:10:06,022
And now,

115
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,275
I've filed for a divorce.

116
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:13,404
Furthermore, Chairman Gong
has been using my health as an excuse

117
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,531
to act as my guardian

118
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,743
and manage the company shares
that are in my name.

119
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,369
I have also

120
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:24,665
filed a petition to terminate
the adult guardianship.

121
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,004
This is a provisional injunction order

122
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:33,633
that states the suspension
of Chairman Gong's duties as my guardian

123
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:36,010
until the court makes its final decision.

124
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:39,263
In other words,
until the court makes its final decision,

125
00:10:39,347 --> 00:10:41,223
Chairman Gong
cannot exercise the voting rights

126
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:42,808
on the shares under Ms. Kim's name.

127
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:45,436
That is to say,

128
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,772
due to insufficient voting rights
for a quorum,

129
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:48,689
today's special vote…

130
00:10:50,066 --> 00:10:51,734
is null and void.

131
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,194
What? It's null and void?

132
00:11:05,873 --> 00:11:10,002
We apologize
for the confusion caused today.

133
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:14,674
I will greet you again
as one of the major shareholders

134
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:18,177
and an executive of Natural BeBe.

135
00:11:49,417 --> 00:11:51,627
Father, please allow me to explain.

136
00:11:56,632 --> 00:11:57,716
You idiot.

137
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,927
This is why

138
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,179
you'll always fall short of Ji-hyeok.

139
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,031
-Tae-yeong.
-He's right.

140
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:23,826
It's all because of that bastard,
Gong Ji-hyeok.

141
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,460
-Where are you going?
-I'll be off first.

142
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:40,968
Okay.

143
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
Welcome.

144
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:55,608
I'll take that one.

145
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:57,943
You chose the prettiest one.

146
00:12:58,027 --> 00:12:59,361
The person I'm giving this to
is even prettier.

147
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,488
My goodness, really?

148
00:13:03,699 --> 00:13:04,992
DA-RIM

149
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:07,203
Hey, Da-rim.

150
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,330
Ji-hyeok, did it go well?

151
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,956
I'm on my way to you.

152
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:13,042
Everything's okay, right?

153
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,084
Yes.

154
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:17,254
Everything worked out, thanks to you.

155
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:19,507
Thank goodness.

156
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:45,282
Ji-hyeok?

157
00:13:45,366 --> 00:13:46,534
DA-RIM

158
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:47,868
Ji-hyeok?

159
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,411
Hello?

160
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:51,497
Hello?

161
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:54,208
Ji-hyeok?

162
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,376
Ji-hyeok!

163
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,468
Damn it!

164
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:19,024
Ji-hyeok!

165
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,943
Please say something!

166
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:22,152
Ji-hyeok!

167
00:14:22,236 --> 00:14:23,320
Ji-hyeok!

168
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,722
WITNESS STATEMENT

169
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:35,059
So you're saying

170
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,393
Mr. Yu Tae-yeong

171
00:15:37,144 --> 00:15:40,105
intentionally drove his car
into Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

172
00:15:40,189 --> 00:15:41,106
Yes.

173
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,817
And you witnessed it yourself?

174
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,653
How many times do I have to tell you?

175
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,988
You're not exactly in a position
to have this attitude.

176
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:54,161
A lot of complaints
have been made against you.

177
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:56,830
For obstruction of business operations,
breach of fiduciary duty…

178
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,749
You can talk about that later…

179
00:16:01,961 --> 00:16:03,045
with my lawyer.

180
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,590
INTERROGATION ROOM

181
00:16:22,022 --> 00:16:24,858
Come on. Damn it.

182
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,695
Ji-hye.

183
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:32,658
Let's go.

184
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:33,575
Hey.

185
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:34,994
Hey!

186
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:37,037
What's that look on your face? Hey!

187
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:38,831
What did you tell them?

188
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:40,874
Hey, Gong Ji-hye!

189
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:41,875
Go inside.

190
00:16:41,959 --> 00:16:43,877
-Get inside already!
-What the hell is going on?

191
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:53,220
The police are investigating
Director Gong Ji-hye,

192
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:54,930
and it doesn't seem like
it'll blow over easily.

193
00:16:55,014 --> 00:16:59,059
Because Ms. Gong provided
a tremendous amount of evidence,

194
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,853
it appears you'll also

195
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,772
have to be investigated for embezzlement.

196
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:11,864
Why would I be investigated?

197
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:23,083
It's a divorce agreement.

198
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:25,586
On the condition that you relinquish
your guardianship over me

199
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,130
and resign from the chairman position,

200
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:32,801
I'll drop all the lawsuits
I've filed against you.

201
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,179
You want to kick me out?

202
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,806
After I kept a roof over your head
all these years?

203
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,349
How dare you, you lunatic!

204
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,689
Even when your son
is on the verge of death,

205
00:17:46,607 --> 00:17:49,276
the only things you care about
are your assets

206
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,820
and reputation.

207
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,532
This is what's left of your life

208
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:57,451
and the price you have to pay.

209
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:40,244
-Da-rim.
-We're here.

210
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,124
-Jin-hui.
-I can't believe this.

211
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:53,340
Thanks.

212
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:56,510
"I even had a whole wheat croissant."

213
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,679
"With organic vegetables…"

214
00:19:10,274 --> 00:19:11,525
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

215
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:15,696
You've been in bed for a month.

216
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:19,032
Aren't you bored yet?

217
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:23,704
You should wake up
so we can have some fun.

218
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:33,881
Hey, Sang-sik!

219
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,259
I'm doing well. How about you?

220
00:19:38,343 --> 00:19:40,304
You want to have a meal? Just you and me?

221
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:41,930
Should we do that then?

222
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,826
Where are you?

223
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,496
You're almost here, right?

224
00:20:08,248 --> 00:20:10,292
I promise to shave your beard

225
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,045
and wash your hair
for the rest of my life.

226
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:17,341
So please just wake up.

227
00:20:26,975 --> 00:20:27,809
Ji-hyeok.

228
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:29,728
Ji-hyeok.

229
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,313
You just moved, right?

230
00:20:32,356 --> 00:20:33,273
Ji-hyeok.

231
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:37,778
Doctor!

232
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:41,782
Mr. Gong.

233
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,701
Mr. Gong.

234
00:20:48,038 --> 00:20:49,331
Do you know where we are?

235
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:52,876
Why am I in a hospital?

236
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:54,461
Did I

237
00:20:54,544 --> 00:20:57,172
get into an accident
on my way to Jeju Island?

238
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,385
I don't have time to waste.

239
00:21:01,468 --> 00:21:03,804
Ji-hyeok, what do you mean by Jeju?

240
00:21:03,887 --> 00:21:05,305
What are you talking about?

241
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:08,225
I have to meet someone important
for my business.

242
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,686
His name is Kim Jeong-gwon.

243
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:13,605
Kim Jeong-gwon?

244
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,731
By the way,

245
00:21:16,358 --> 00:21:17,317
who are you?

246
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,950
It's a form of post-traumatic memory loss.

247
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:32,666
The brain's ability to process
recent information was disrupted,

248
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:35,711
leaving memories
close to the time of the accident

249
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:37,045
damaged or inaccessible.

250
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:38,547
Yes. Take a look.

251
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,174
Right here.

252
00:21:42,259 --> 00:21:46,638
Then, when will he recover
those lost memories?

253
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:50,350
He will regain them at some point, right?

254
00:21:50,434 --> 00:21:53,812
You have to be patient and give him time.

255
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:59,359
Take a look at this.

256
00:21:59,443 --> 00:22:02,029
I promise we're dating.

257
00:22:02,571 --> 00:22:04,406
See? We're linking arms and everything.

258
00:22:05,657 --> 00:22:06,825
Look, a cheek heart.

259
00:22:06,908 --> 00:22:08,785
This was a date at home,
and you're sending me hearts.

260
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,245
That's impossible.

261
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:13,623
You're not my type at all.

262
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:16,626
I'm totally your type.

263
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,129
You said I was cute when I smiled.

264
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,592
Hey, lady. Are you trying to scam me?

265
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:26,428
Did my father put you up to it?

266
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,057
He's trying to get me
to move back home, huh?

267
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,767
That must be it. I'm sure of it.

268
00:22:32,517 --> 00:22:33,769
Unbelievable.

269
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,020
Get out of here!

270
00:22:35,562 --> 00:22:36,813
That's what he said to me.

271
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,899
My goodness, how frustrating.

272
00:22:38,982 --> 00:22:42,277
Why does he only remember things
from just before he met us?

273
00:22:42,903 --> 00:22:45,238
Is there some way
we can help him regain his memories?

274
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:49,785
Da-rim, are there any impactful memories
the two of you shared?

275
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,453
-Impactful?
-Yeah.

276
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:55,290
If we recreate the situation,
conversation, and mood of that memory,

277
00:22:55,373 --> 00:22:56,875
he might be able to remember.

278
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,377
They do that in movies.

279
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,470
He's coming. Get ready.

280
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:10,847
Three, two, one. Go.

281
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:19,564
-Oh no!
-Oh dear!

282
00:23:19,648 --> 00:23:21,274
-Gosh, what are we going to do?
-Oh no.

283
00:23:21,358 --> 00:23:23,443
The pregnant woman
dropped all her tangerines.

284
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:26,029
I think she needs help.

285
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:27,030
My back's aching.

286
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,366
-Goodness me.
-What are we going to do?

287
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:31,785
Oh my, look at all those tangerines
on the floor.

288
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:33,203
Should we pick them up together?

289
00:23:33,286 --> 00:23:35,413
My goodness. Look at this young lady.

290
00:23:35,997 --> 00:23:37,207
What a kind person she is.

291
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,543
-She's so kind.
-She's unbelievably sweet.

292
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:45,465
-Thank you.
-Please take one.

293
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:47,008
-Thank you.
-I appreciate it.

294
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,885
What a kind soul.

295
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:49,803
Right?

296
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:05,443
I don't like tangerines.

297
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:18,832
This is nice.

298
00:24:21,459 --> 00:24:23,837
-Ji-hyeok! Run!
-Damn it!

299
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,213
Hey!

300
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:26,756
Get him!

301
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,425
-Hey!
-Hey, you in a patient gown!

302
00:24:28,508 --> 00:24:30,051
-Hey!
-What's going on?

303
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,011
You!

304
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,846
-Hey!
-Get him!

305
00:24:32,929 --> 00:24:34,848
-We need to get out of here now.
-What's wrong?

306
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:37,350
Stop! Where do you think you're going?

307
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:38,518
Stop right there!

308
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:39,644
Get them!

309
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,313
Wait for me!

310
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,814
Behind you!

311
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:43,815
In front of you!

312
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:47,944
Just stay here for a second.

313
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:39,537
Ji-hyeok, do you remember anything?

314
00:25:40,538 --> 00:25:41,373
Yeah.

315
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,335
I understand now.

316
00:25:45,418 --> 00:25:46,795
You do?

317
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,421
Yeah.

318
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,547
Ji-hyeok.

319
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:52,968
You're in cahoots with them.

320
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:55,512
What do you mean?

321
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:58,181
You're trying to con me
with these scammers here.

322
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,684
No, that's not…

323
00:26:06,731 --> 00:26:07,691
What are you doing?

324
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,237
Are you crazy?

325
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,371
Take that thing out of your mouth
before you speak.

326
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:24,958
Well…

327
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,761
I understand.

328
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:41,057
It feels like

329
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,852
I owe you a really big apology right now.

330
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,147
But I honestly don't remember,

331
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,233
so I don't know
what I should be apologizing for.

332
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,236
And it's not like

333
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,447
I can date a stranger.

334
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,784
I wasn't suggesting we go back
to the way things were immediately.

335
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:01,119
I'm just asking you

336
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:04,789
to let me stay by your side
until your memories come back.

337
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,707
No.

338
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,751
Truth be told,
based on what you've told me,

339
00:27:09,502 --> 00:27:12,213
I think things worked out for the better.

340
00:27:13,131 --> 00:27:15,300
-What?
-In your stories,

341
00:27:16,217 --> 00:27:17,844
I sound like I was suffering
from temporary insanity.

342
00:27:19,429 --> 00:27:20,638
It's as if

343
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,058
I've finally come to my senses.

344
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:25,143
What do you mean?

345
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,145
Humans are independent creatures.

346
00:27:28,063 --> 00:27:29,647
They're at peak perfection
when they live alone.

347
00:27:30,231 --> 00:27:32,192
I'm sure we wouldn't have lasted.

348
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:33,985
What dies faster

349
00:27:34,736 --> 00:27:36,279
than the head on a beer

350
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:38,615
is love.

351
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:43,953
So let's just end this here,

352
00:27:44,037 --> 00:27:46,373
and I hope you'll allow me to return…

353
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:51,086
to my old life.

354
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:42,345
Why did you do it?

355
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:45,807
I trusted you.

356
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:47,684
I loved you.

357
00:28:48,643 --> 00:28:51,730
I felt terrible
about your mother's passing,

358
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,107
so I tried to do right by you.

359
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:56,317
But how could you do this to me?

360
00:28:57,819 --> 00:28:59,571
Why did you do all this?

361
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,656
That's why I did it.

362
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:08,580
Because you treated me well
only after my mom passed.

363
00:29:09,706 --> 00:29:10,790
What?

364
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,838
If you truly loved my mom,

365
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,674
if you loved me…

366
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:26,973
you should've come to us
when she was still alive.

367
00:29:28,141 --> 00:29:29,142
No.

368
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:31,102
You should've never abandoned us
in the first place.

369
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,732
You treated me well
because you felt bad for me?

370
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:40,528
That's not love.

371
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,238
That's self-pity.

372
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,409
You pitied yourself after you lost love.

373
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:50,747
And you just needed me around
for you to play the role of a tragic hero!

374
00:29:51,539 --> 00:29:52,582
You know why?

375
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,588
Because you're selfish to the very core.

376
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,134
Look around.

377
00:30:04,969 --> 00:30:07,388
Look around and see
who you have left by your side.

378
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:26,741
Chairman Gong Chang-ho of Natural BeBe,

379
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,744
who's under suspicion of embezzlement
and breach of fiduciary duty,

380
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:32,205
has appeared at the police station
for questioning.

381
00:30:32,288 --> 00:30:35,375
Chairman Gong is suspected of embezzling
billions of won from the company

382
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,544
to create a personal slush fund.

383
00:30:37,627 --> 00:30:39,087
The police are carrying out

384
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:42,131
a search and seizure at his home
and office at Natural BeBe.

385
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:43,800
Previously, Chairman Gong…

386
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,927
He left this
before he left for the police.

387
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:46,886
He signed

388
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:48,596
the agreement.

389
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:52,559
Thank you.

390
00:30:52,642 --> 00:30:56,104
And he told me
to pass on an apology as well.

391
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:57,355
…was confirmed.

392
00:30:57,856 --> 00:31:01,192
It was further escalated when his son,
Gong Ji-hyeok, personally revealed

393
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:02,819
this shocking truth.

394
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:05,864
It was even revealed
that he had his wife, Kim In-ae,

395
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:09,200
confined to a psychiatric hospital
for many years,

396
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:11,202
adding to the growing controversy.

397
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:12,120
The police…

398
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:13,830
What's my afternoon schedule?

399
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:16,624
-I'll go over it with you as we walk.
-All right.

400
00:31:21,629 --> 00:31:22,547
Hey.

401
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,299
Where's the guard?

402
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:27,552
-Hey, guard!
-Goddamn it!

403
00:31:27,635 --> 00:31:29,846
-Guard!
-Why is he so damn noisy?

404
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:31,055
Guard!

405
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,183
Just sleep
if you have nothing better to do.

406
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:36,811
Do you know who I am?

407
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,564
Mind your own damn business
and sleep all you want.

408
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,108
How dare you talk that way to our boss?

409
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,152
Finally, a guard.

410
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,779
Did you get in touch with my father?

411
00:31:46,863 --> 00:31:48,197
Hey, don't just walk away.

412
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:49,198
What's your name?

413
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,576
I'm going to have my father
fire you first, you punk.

414
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,619
Get over here.

415
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,287
Guard!

416
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,956
I don't know what kind of rich family
you come from,

417
00:31:57,040 --> 00:32:01,586
but it clearly seems you've been cut off.

418
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:02,795
What should we do about him?

419
00:32:03,421 --> 00:32:05,048
What do you think?

420
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:06,549
We'll take our time

421
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,259
and do our best

422
00:32:09,302 --> 00:32:10,303
to crush him.

423
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,521
Why you little…

424
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:22,690
Go ahead and call your dad! Go on!

425
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:36,746
Mom.

426
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,499
I'm leaving now.

427
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:41,376
I'm sorry.

428
00:32:42,418 --> 00:32:44,295
I can't even see you off at the airport.

429
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,755
Don't be silly.

430
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,174
I'm the one who's sorry.

431
00:32:48,883 --> 00:32:49,842
Not at all.

432
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,096
There's enough going on here,
so it's better that you leave.

433
00:32:53,179 --> 00:32:56,474
You'll only get caught up in the mess
if you stay.

434
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,686
Make sure to eat your meals, okay?

435
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:02,063
You too.

436
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:04,107
Did you tell Mr. Kim?

437
00:33:06,401 --> 00:33:07,402
Why would I?

438
00:33:08,528 --> 00:33:09,529
I'm off.

439
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,613
No need to see me out.

440
00:33:22,917 --> 00:33:24,377
SEON-U

441
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:31,175
-Hello, Mr. Kim.
-Ms. Yu.

442
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,552
I'm really sorry, but where are you?

443
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:34,387
I'm driving right now.

444
00:33:34,470 --> 00:33:35,555
Jun disappeared.

445
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,890
What? Where was he last seen?

446
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,142
I'm out of town for work,

447
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,810
so it'll take some time
for me to get back.

448
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,311
Can you help me if you're still in Seoul?

449
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,984
Jun! Kim Jun!

450
00:33:48,067 --> 00:33:48,985
Jun!

451
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,028
JUN BABY STUDIO

452
00:33:50,111 --> 00:33:52,113
Jun!

453
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,906
Jun!

454
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:55,575
Kim Jun!

455
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:56,993
Kim Jun!

456
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:00,413
Hey, kids.

457
00:34:00,997 --> 00:34:02,832
Have you seen him anywhere?

458
00:34:02,915 --> 00:34:04,500
-No.
-No.

459
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:05,960
Have you seen him anywhere?

460
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,670
-No, I haven't.
-Me neither.

461
00:34:07,754 --> 00:34:08,671
Jun!

462
00:34:09,464 --> 00:34:11,049
Kim Jun!

463
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:12,050
Where is he?

464
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:12,967
Jun!

465
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,265
Jun!

466
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,476
My goodness.

467
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:22,560
Jun.

468
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:25,730
Pretty lady.

469
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:30,526
Are you okay?

470
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,197
Did you fall asleep here?

471
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,824
Yes, I was playing hide-and-seek.

472
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,161
You scared me.

473
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:46,250
I was so scared
because I thought you had disappeared.

474
00:34:50,922 --> 00:34:52,465
No, it's okay.

475
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:53,466
Don't cry.

476
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:54,675
No, don't cry.

477
00:35:34,340 --> 00:35:35,299
You're up.

478
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,262
He just fell asleep.

479
00:35:45,810 --> 00:35:47,186
Thank you.

480
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:19,969
Ji-hyeok.

481
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,471
I've completed the discharge procedure.

482
00:36:22,555 --> 00:36:23,890
You're good to go now.

483
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,516
Okay, thanks for everything.

484
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:26,934
You went through so much.

485
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,394
Thanks for acknowledging.

486
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
By the way, Ji-hyeok…

487
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,317
about Ms. Go Da-rim…

488
00:36:35,401 --> 00:36:36,736
What about her?

489
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:39,655
I know there's nothing you can do
about your memories not coming back,

490
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:42,408
but she's still the one
who nursed you day and night.

491
00:36:43,075 --> 00:36:44,660
You were in bed for a whole month.

492
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:47,288
You were only able to stay neat and clean

493
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,165
because of her.

494
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,376
So if you ever get the chance,

495
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,294
be sure

496
00:36:53,794 --> 00:36:54,962
to thank her.

497
00:36:58,007 --> 00:36:58,925
Okay.

498
00:37:02,511 --> 00:37:03,846
Let's go.

499
00:38:16,794 --> 00:38:17,795
Why did you come back?

500
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,756
It was so hard to let you go.

501
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:23,551
Are you going to tell me to leave again?

502
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:25,845
You should've asked me to stay.

503
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:30,224
I know I shouldn't have.

504
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,854
But I guess you came back
because I was waiting.

505
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:55,916
Believe me. You're so lucky.

506
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,545
The buyer loves the house so much

507
00:38:59,628 --> 00:39:01,922
that they're willing to pay
above market value.

508
00:39:02,882 --> 00:39:04,133
Yes, I'm glad it worked out.

509
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,052
Oh, there they are.

510
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:07,553
Hello.

511
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:13,476
In-ae.

512
00:39:18,647 --> 00:39:21,359
You should've told us.

513
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,778
I was so shocked.

514
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:25,196
I was afraid you'd turn me down

515
00:39:25,821 --> 00:39:27,031
if I told you in advance.

516
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,451
I really wanted to pay you back

517
00:39:31,243 --> 00:39:34,705
for what you did for me
when I was struggling.

518
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,166
What was there to pay back?

519
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,793
Thank you.

520
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,379
Thank you so much.

521
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:46,050
I have more good news.

522
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:50,179
We won the baby carrier lawsuit.

523
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:53,724
That's such good news. I'm so glad.

524
00:39:53,808 --> 00:39:57,228
MomsJoy is recalling all of its products,

525
00:39:57,311 --> 00:40:00,189
and our product
will officially be launched soon.

526
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:05,403
The company has high hopes
for this new product launch.

527
00:40:06,278 --> 00:40:08,572
You know this is all thanks to you, right?

528
00:40:09,407 --> 00:40:10,783
I didn't do anything.

529
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:12,701
Would you

530
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:15,871
consider rejoining the company?

531
00:40:19,875 --> 00:40:22,169
No, I don't think that'd be right.

532
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,089
But I really appreciate your offer.

533
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:26,465
In that case,

534
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:29,844
how about starting a company of your own?

535
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,096
Pardon?

536
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:33,347
My own company?

537
00:40:33,431 --> 00:40:36,434
Mr. Kang and the other TF team members

538
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:40,521
all told me how passionate
and talented you are.

539
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:44,191
I can't lose such a talent
to another company, can I?

540
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,903
If we can't be owner and employee,

541
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:52,283
I thought investor and startup CEO
would be nice too.

542
00:40:56,704 --> 00:40:58,664
For the first investment,

543
00:41:00,166 --> 00:41:01,542
we'll start with this.

544
00:41:03,335 --> 00:41:05,045
You need a place to live

545
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,506
to start working again.

546
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:09,633
REAL ESTATE SALES CONTRACT

547
00:41:11,886 --> 00:41:13,179
Hold on a second.

548
00:41:13,262 --> 00:41:15,431
How can we accept this?

549
00:41:15,514 --> 00:41:17,683
How will we ever repay this kindness?

550
00:41:17,766 --> 00:41:19,393
There's nothing to repay.

551
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,021
If Da-rim works hard,

552
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,397
that's more than enough.

553
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:34,825
All right. I'm sure Da-rim will work hard

554
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,369
to show how much we appreciate this.

555
00:41:37,453 --> 00:41:38,329
Yes.

556
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:42,166
I'm sure Da-rim will do well.

557
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:47,296
Then I'll promise to give it my best shot.

558
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:49,298
Thank you so much.

559
00:42:07,566 --> 00:42:08,526
Dad.

560
00:42:09,151 --> 00:42:10,361
We're back.

561
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:12,613
Aren't you relieved?

562
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:15,574
Do you think…

563
00:42:17,284 --> 00:42:18,827
I can do this?

564
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,466
CEO KIM JAE-HYEON (PAPA FABRICS)

565
00:42:32,550 --> 00:42:34,009
Hello, sir.

566
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:36,303
Yes, it's supposed to have two zippers.

567
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,806
It's designed to open
from both the top and bottom.

568
00:42:38,889 --> 00:42:41,642
And remember that premium fabric
I mentioned last time?

569
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:44,853
-Let's proceed with that.
-Hey, I got some gizzard shad!

570
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:46,355
-Okay, then I'll leave it to you.
-Let's eat!

571
00:42:46,438 --> 00:42:47,273
Bye.

572
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,315
Let's hang this one.

573
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,359
This one? Okay.

574
00:42:50,442 --> 00:42:51,777
Should we hang it here?

575
00:42:52,653 --> 00:42:53,529
Over here.

576
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:54,947
-Here? You got it.
-Yes.

577
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,909
Ta-da.

578
00:42:58,993 --> 00:43:00,035
All done.

579
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:02,830
Jun, give me a high five!

580
00:43:03,622 --> 00:43:06,292
-Merry Christmas!
-Merry Christmas!

581
00:43:06,375 --> 00:43:09,295
-Jun!
-Thank you.

582
00:43:09,378 --> 00:43:10,879
Let's open this later.

583
00:43:10,963 --> 00:43:13,257
-Should we blow out the candles?
-Good idea.

584
00:43:13,340 --> 00:43:15,593
-Let's blow them out.
-Sit here.

585
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:17,136
There you go.

586
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,555
-All right. One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

587
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,687
Hello.

588
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:10,105
1 YEAR LATER

589
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,149
-Hello.
-Hello.

590
00:44:12,232 --> 00:44:14,068
Oh, hello.

591
00:44:14,735 --> 00:44:16,236
Bye. Oh dear.

592
00:44:16,737 --> 00:44:19,239
Okay. Let's see here.

593
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:20,908
SANG-HUI

594
00:44:22,201 --> 00:44:23,327
Hey, Sang-hui.

595
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,245
Hey, Da-rim. I'm in Jeju right now.

596
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:27,206
Oh, you arrived.

597
00:44:27,289 --> 00:44:29,375
How's the weather?
Did you eat a lot of tasty food?

598
00:44:29,458 --> 00:44:31,502
Listen, I just sent you a picture.

599
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:32,586
Can you take a look at it?

600
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:35,589
The girl in the background
is your younger sister, right?

601
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:38,425
What? Let me check right now.

602
00:44:38,509 --> 00:44:39,968
Thanks. Bye.

603
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:25,681
Hey.

604
00:45:25,764 --> 00:45:27,099
Are you all packed?

605
00:45:28,725 --> 00:45:29,726
Yeah.

606
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,311
You had a dress like that?

607
00:45:31,395 --> 00:45:32,688
Oh, this?

608
00:45:33,397 --> 00:45:36,942
Someone gave it to me as a gift
the last time I was in Jeju.

609
00:45:37,025 --> 00:45:38,026
I see.

610
00:45:38,819 --> 00:45:39,820
Why are you taking that?

611
00:45:39,903 --> 00:45:42,906
Are you going to wear that
while looking for Da-jeong?

612
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,741
No, I'm going to go back to the store
and get a refund,

613
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:46,493
even if it's half the price.

614
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,996
It could pay off my plane ticket.

615
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:50,122
As expected.

616
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:52,833
You're so incredibly resourceful.

617
00:45:53,625 --> 00:45:57,629
I did a fine job
raising two amazing daughters.

618
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:58,547
Two?

619
00:45:58,630 --> 00:46:00,257
Why are you including Da-jeong?

620
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:02,342
She's hiding in Jeju
after all the trouble she caused.

621
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:04,094
She's doing what she can to survive.

622
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:05,429
What?

623
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,806
She's still putting up a fight
without giving up.

624
00:46:08,348 --> 00:46:09,266
That's good enough.

625
00:46:10,267 --> 00:46:12,769
She's making an effort to survive,
so I'm not worried.

626
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,772
What did I always tell you?

627
00:46:16,857 --> 00:46:17,774
What do you do if you fall?

628
00:46:18,358 --> 00:46:19,985
You just need to get back up.

629
00:46:20,068 --> 00:46:21,236
There you go.

630
00:46:22,196 --> 00:46:23,113
In life,

631
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:25,365
that's all you need.

632
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:28,827
Yeah.

633
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,892
LEISURELY STROLL TOUR

634
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:53,560
LEISURELY STROLL TOUR

635
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:56,897
We'll meet back here in 30 minutes.

636
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,273
Please don't be late.

637
00:46:58,357 --> 00:46:59,441
-Okay.
-Okay.

638
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:02,945
Go Da-jeong, you…

639
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:06,657
-Who are you?
-I'm sorry.

640
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,371
Da-jeong?

641
00:47:12,454 --> 00:47:14,039
-Who are you?
-Sorry.

642
00:47:14,122 --> 00:47:15,707
-Go Da…
-Sorry?

643
00:47:16,875 --> 00:47:18,335
Sorry.

644
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:27,678
Excuse me.

645
00:47:30,430 --> 00:47:32,724
By any chance,
are you looking for Ms. Go Da-jeong?

646
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,977
You know my sister?

647
00:47:35,060 --> 00:47:36,687
Yes, she's a colleague.

648
00:47:36,770 --> 00:47:39,106
She's not working today. It's her day off.

649
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:42,693
Then can I get her address?

650
00:47:42,776 --> 00:47:44,194
I don't know where she lives.

651
00:47:44,736 --> 00:47:47,197
You should try going to Golden Bay Hotel
later this evening.

652
00:47:47,281 --> 00:47:50,117
She works part-time there
as a server on her days off.

653
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,160
I see.

654
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:53,245
Thank you.

655
00:47:53,328 --> 00:47:54,371
Thank you.

656
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:58,727
You can't enter without an invitation.

657
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:00,270
Sir.

658
00:49:00,354 --> 00:49:03,690
I just need to go in for a second

659
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,984
to check if my sister is there or not.

660
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,819
I'll be very quick and quiet.

661
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:11,573
I'll sneak in just for a second.
No one will even know I'm there.

662
00:49:19,831 --> 00:49:21,708
I guess I have no other choice.

663
00:49:22,709 --> 00:49:24,169
What will I tell

664
00:49:24,670 --> 00:49:26,338
my elderly mother?

665
00:49:26,421 --> 00:49:27,464
She just had heart surgery,

666
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:30,842
and she's been waiting day and night
for my sister to come home.

667
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:33,762
It must've been so hard for you.

668
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:36,556
I know.

669
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,811
I thought after all that suffering,

670
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,439
I was finally
getting to see my sister again.

671
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,441
But of course,
I don't have an invitation to the party.

672
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:48,402
But it's all right. It's fine.

673
00:49:48,485 --> 00:49:49,736
I'm really fine.

674
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:51,113
Listen.

675
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,157
I can overlook the fact that
you don't have the invitation.

676
00:49:54,908 --> 00:49:56,576
-But…
-But?

677
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:59,246
Your outfit right now is a bit…

678
00:50:03,583 --> 00:50:06,461
You're saying I just need to wear
a dress like that, right?

679
00:50:07,379 --> 00:50:08,296
That's right.

680
00:50:24,187 --> 00:50:25,731
Where is she?

681
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:27,899
Pardon me.

682
00:50:41,788 --> 00:50:42,831
Seriously.

683
00:50:52,924 --> 00:50:53,800
Ms. Go Da-rim?

684
00:50:55,302 --> 00:50:56,970
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

685
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,054
What are you doing here?

686
00:51:00,056 --> 00:51:01,391
Did you follow me here?

687
00:51:01,975 --> 00:51:02,809
What?

688
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:04,853
No, I didn't.

689
00:51:05,479 --> 00:51:06,480
Then why are you here?

690
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:09,024
What do you think? I'm here…

691
00:51:09,858 --> 00:51:12,652
I'm here to celebrate
the founding of the company.

692
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:15,906
Name the CEO of this company then.

693
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,074
Well, it's…

694
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:21,995
I knew it.

695
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:24,498
You did follow me.

696
00:51:24,956 --> 00:51:26,583
I clearly warned you last time.

697
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,710
I told you I'd call the police
if this ever happened…

698
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:31,213
And you should set up
a dinner for us in Seoul with Su-jin.

699
00:51:34,633 --> 00:51:36,009
I'm sorry.

700
00:51:36,092 --> 00:51:38,345
Jeong-gwon was walking toward us.

701
00:51:40,388 --> 00:51:42,265
Should we do that again?

702
00:51:45,101 --> 00:51:46,353
Are you okay?

703
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:49,731
Seeing you is making my head hurt again.

704
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:51,566
What? I didn't do anything.

705
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,695
Anyway, I swear I'm not here for you,

706
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:57,072
so don't worry.

707
00:51:57,864 --> 00:52:01,159
Let's each mind our own business.

708
00:53:05,891 --> 00:53:08,143
I didn't do that on purpose.

709
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,603
It was an accident.

710
00:53:29,289 --> 00:53:30,123
Should we…

711
00:53:31,625 --> 00:53:32,834
do that again?

712
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:35,962
What?

713
00:53:36,713 --> 00:53:37,756
Let's…

714
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:41,843
do that again.

715
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:02,984
Seriously?

716
00:56:03,568 --> 00:56:04,569
I'm sorry.

717
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:33,389
Will you…

718
00:56:35,725 --> 00:56:36,559
marry me?

KIM SEON-U PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

720
00:57:27,068 --> 00:57:29,612
A FEW YEARS LATER

721
00:58:48,942 --> 00:58:55,406
KIM SEON-U PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

722
00:58:55,490 --> 00:59:00,161
My goodness. That's one handsome boy.
I wonder who he takes after.

723
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:01,287
He takes after me.

724
00:59:01,371 --> 00:59:03,331
Look at that sharp little nose.

725
00:59:03,414 --> 00:59:04,874
He must take after his dad.

726
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,334
He takes after me.

727
00:59:06,417 --> 00:59:09,170
-Look at him moving around.
-I think he looks like his dad.

728
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:10,755
-He's wriggling.
-Hello.

729
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:13,132
You're finally back.

730
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,092
How'd it go?

731
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:22,433
Well, things don't always work out.

732
00:59:22,517 --> 00:59:25,228
Yeah, we'll try again next time
and get the deal then.

733
00:59:25,311 --> 00:59:26,604
Of course.

734
00:59:26,688 --> 00:59:28,856
Even monkeys fall from trees sometimes.

735
00:59:30,608 --> 00:59:31,442
What are you talking about?

736
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:35,113
We secured
the South American export contract.

737
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:36,322
-What?
-No way.

738
00:59:36,406 --> 00:59:37,365
What was with the acting?

739
00:59:37,448 --> 00:59:40,076
-Let me see.
-You two can't mess with us like that!

740
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:41,160
It's all in English.

741
00:59:42,453 --> 00:59:44,789
This is really happening, right?
I'm not dreaming, am I?

742
00:59:44,872 --> 00:59:47,667
Yes, it's really happening. We did it!

743
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:50,878
Congratulations, Ms. Go.

744
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:53,965
Well done, everyone.

745
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:56,551
Our team

746
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:57,719
-really is the best!
-The best!

747
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,555
I know it's been a while,
but should we do that?

748
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,015
-Should we?
-Let's do it.

749
01:00:02,098 --> 01:00:03,766
-Bring it in.
-Bring it in!

750
01:00:03,850 --> 01:00:05,143
-Okay. Bring it in.
-Here we go.

751
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:06,894
One, two, three.

752
01:00:06,978 --> 01:00:08,771
-Dream & BeBe!
-Dream & BeBe!

753
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:22,619
CEO GO DA-RIM

754
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:31,919
Oh my. Look at them go.

755
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:32,962
Oh my goodness.

756
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:36,341
Who on earth do they take after
to be like that?

757
01:00:36,424 --> 01:00:37,634
Who do you think?

758
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:39,969
What?

759
01:00:40,845 --> 01:00:41,679
Of course, it's me.

760
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:47,977
-I'm so good.
-But babe,

761
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,855
instead of reading to them last night,

762
01:00:50,938 --> 01:00:52,523
you secretly played a game
on your phone, didn't you?

763
01:00:52,607 --> 01:00:53,941
No, I didn't.

764
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:55,234
Don't lie to me.

765
01:00:56,069 --> 01:00:57,403
Honey.

766
01:00:57,487 --> 01:01:00,156
Don't you know they're at a really
important age right now?

767
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:01,658
All right. I'm sorry.

768
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:05,203
Kids, let's go eat.

769
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:07,580
I'm serious here.

770
01:01:07,664 --> 01:01:11,250
The parents need to set a good example
for the kids to naturally learn from them.

771
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,127
How many times have I told you that?

772
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,671
You're so right.

773
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:16,255
I'll be sure

774
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:18,549
to never forget those words.

775
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,134
All right?

776
01:01:20,968 --> 01:01:22,762
I'll be watching you, okay?

777
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,431
Kids.

778
01:01:27,308 --> 01:01:29,352
This is all because of that darn kiss.

779
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:30,687
My goodness.

780
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:31,604
What?

781
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:33,398
What's this about a kiss now?

782
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:35,024
What?

783
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:36,526
It's nothing.

784
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:40,947
I think I just heard you say,
"This is all because of that darn kiss."

785
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:44,409
You're right.

786
01:01:45,493 --> 01:01:47,120
It's all because of that darn kiss…

787
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:51,666
that I couldn't be happier.

788
01:01:54,419 --> 01:01:55,253
I knew it.

789
01:01:55,878 --> 01:01:57,839
You just need to kiss first
and think later.

790
01:02:18,901 --> 01:02:19,944
There they go again.
