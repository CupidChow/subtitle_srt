1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,681
SEON-U

3
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:05,690
I'll get going then.

4
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:15,450
Let's have a meal.

5
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,619
You and me.

6
00:01:22,248 --> 00:01:24,417
I already have plans.

7
00:01:24,501 --> 00:01:25,585
Cancel them.

8
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:28,505
And stay with me.

9
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:31,925
What?

10
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:33,676
Don't go.

11
00:01:35,637 --> 00:01:36,805
I don't want you to go.

12
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:11,589
Just because you think I'm easy

13
00:02:11,673 --> 00:02:13,049
doesn't mean you can do this.

14
00:02:14,425 --> 00:02:16,136
Who said you were easy?

15
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,930
I'm so disappointed in you.

16
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:24,561
Disappointed?

17
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:30,441
Da-rim.

18
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:33,069
Hold on. Da-rim, wait.

19
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:41,494
I like you.

20
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:44,414
I really like you.

21
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,583
I have

22
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,626
ever since I met you.

23
00:02:51,504 --> 00:02:53,423
What are you talking about?

24
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,383
You can't do this.

25
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:56,843
What about Ms. Yu?

26
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,511
You'll be marrying her soon.

27
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:02,557
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

28
00:03:03,224 --> 00:03:05,351
We have absolutely no attraction
to each other.

29
00:03:08,688 --> 00:03:10,023
The person I like

30
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,025
is you.

31
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,202
Why would you like me?

32
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:26,706
-Sorry?
-You have no reason to.

33
00:03:30,209 --> 00:03:31,294
You think I'm easy, huh?

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:34,088
Are you trying to get back at me
for playing with you?

35
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:35,048
Is that it?

36
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:36,257
No, it's not.

37
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,553
I really mean it.

38
00:03:44,724 --> 00:03:46,184
I'm going to pretend

39
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,937
that nothing happened tonight.

40
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,731
I'll find a new job as soon as possible.

41
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:53,858
Wait.

42
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,785
Da-rim.

43
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:06,579
Hey, Seon-u.

44
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,497
Let's go eat.

45
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:13,002
I'm sorry,
but I'm just going to head home.

46
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,546
Did something happen?

47
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:18,508
No, nothing happened.

48
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,510
I just want to go home.

49
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,427
Wait, Da…

50
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:52,709
EPISODE 10

51
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:56,879
I saw him being all lovey-dovey
with his fiancée.

52
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,631
Why would he lie about that?

53
00:04:58,715 --> 00:04:59,841
Damn it.

54
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:03,052
Then again,

55
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,887
I lied first.

56
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,931
I don't have a leg to stand on.

57
00:05:47,722 --> 00:05:49,974
This is terrible.

58
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:55,354
You've experienced
that firsthand as well, right?

59
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:00,109
Don't tell me you've also…

60
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:02,945
I've experienced it as well.

61
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:04,363
You too, Go-eun?

62
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,157
Of course.

63
00:06:09,535 --> 00:06:12,246
Look, he just won't stop.

64
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:16,125
He's a repeat offender…

65
00:06:20,004 --> 00:06:20,880
Look at it yourself.

66
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:25,927
The graph doesn't reflect
the text data at all, does it?

67
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,012
My eyesight has been a bit fuzzy.

68
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,472
-My age must be catching up to me.
-Look at…

69
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:30,932
Look at this.

70
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:33,267
Look at this here.

71
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:34,519
Does that look right to you?

72
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,771
How many times
do I need to teach you the basics?

73
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,815
How are you still not getting it?

74
00:06:44,195 --> 00:06:45,446
You may leave.

75
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,365
Yes, sir.

76
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:01,504
Our families
are just pushing us to be together.

77
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,881
We have absolutely no attraction
to each other.

78
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,343
Was I mistaken?

79
00:07:08,386 --> 00:07:09,762
Then…

80
00:07:09,846 --> 00:07:11,055
I like you.

81
00:07:11,139 --> 00:07:12,431
I really like you.

82
00:07:13,015 --> 00:07:14,100
I have

83
00:07:15,268 --> 00:07:16,394
ever since I met you.

84
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:18,938
He was telling the truth?

85
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:23,734
Even so, how would that make any sense?

86
00:07:24,444 --> 00:07:25,778
He's a son of a chaebol family

87
00:07:25,862 --> 00:07:28,281
who's also successful and handsome.

88
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,491
He's basically perfect.

89
00:07:31,576 --> 00:07:33,286
Meanwhile, I have nothing at all,

90
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,455
with no talents to speak of,

91
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,333
and just a history of habitual lying.

92
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,420
There's no way he'd like me.

93
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,388
It happens to me every day.
Didn't you see me get an earful last time?

94
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:55,975
Mr. Gong can be so harsh
once he gets wound up.

95
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:58,769
Yeah. Don't let it get to you, Nan-suk.

96
00:07:59,353 --> 00:08:01,522
I'm clearly at fault.

97
00:08:01,606 --> 00:08:04,150
I still can't even put together
a simple document.

98
00:08:04,233 --> 00:08:06,360
Only if I could be more like you, Da-rim.

99
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:08,279
Can you teach me later?

100
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:11,115
Sure.

101
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,658
I'd be happy to.

102
00:08:13,242 --> 00:08:14,911
I'm such a nuisance.

103
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:20,208
Why would you say that?

104
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:23,211
We all rely on you so much.

105
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:24,921
Yeah, we do.

106
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,923
-Me?
-Yeah.

107
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,549
You've got great initiative.

108
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,343
Think about the live commerce.

109
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,428
Mr. Gong opposed it
because we lacked experience,

110
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,680
but we ended up doing it
because you pushed for it.

111
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,725
After that broadcast,
daily sales increased by ten times.

112
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:41,062
There were a few twists and turns,
but ultimately, that's how it turned out.

113
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,357
Everyone has their strengths
and weaknesses. Nobody's perfect.

114
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,527
-I dare you to prove me wrong.
-She's right.

115
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:48,903
-You think so?
-Of course.

116
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:51,739
Mr. Gong can be a jerk sometimes,

117
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,157
but we need to hang in there.

118
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,242
Well said.

119
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:57,745
Every company has a Mr. Gong.
Don't you agree?

120
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:58,829
Oh my.

121
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,087
Where am I, exactly?

122
00:09:06,170 --> 00:09:07,630
Well, you see…

123
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:13,094
We were talking about how every company
needs someone like you.

124
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:15,721
-All recharged? Let's get back to work.
-We'll get back to work.

125
00:09:16,973 --> 00:09:18,057
Ms. Go Da-rim.

126
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,686
You'll come with me to pick out
gift bags during the exhibition.

127
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:31,445
You care deeply for other people.

128
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:34,073
Sorry?

129
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,032
That was random.

130
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:38,452
I heard you encouraging
your team members just now.

131
00:09:39,495 --> 00:09:42,039
You're able to say such things
because you take an interest

132
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:44,417
and have affection for your colleagues.

133
00:09:46,043 --> 00:09:47,169
I'm sure

134
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:50,256
you'll become a far greater leader
than I could ever be.

135
00:09:52,174 --> 00:09:53,467
Thank you.

136
00:09:55,636 --> 00:09:57,013
That's why I like you.

137
00:09:57,972 --> 00:09:58,806
What?

138
00:10:11,485 --> 00:10:12,361
Aren't you getting in?

139
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,405
We have work to do.

140
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,365
Right.

141
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,951
We do.

142
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,670
How about a hand wash and hand cream set?

143
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,131
I think it'll be a safe choice
regardless of age.

144
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,090
That sounds good.

145
00:10:34,925 --> 00:10:37,720
I wonder how it smells. Let's test it.

146
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:44,769
Hold on.

147
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:10,252
Oh, that smells great,
and it goes on really nicely.

148
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,546
You're proactive

149
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,340
and always curious.

150
00:11:14,423 --> 00:11:17,343
Your willingness to check things
for yourself when you're curious

151
00:11:17,927 --> 00:11:19,178
is very admirable.

152
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:23,474
Are you administering some sort of
aptitude and personality test today?

153
00:11:23,557 --> 00:11:25,851
Or a performance assessment?

154
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:27,061
No.

155
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,896
I'm just telling you why I like you.

156
00:11:31,816 --> 00:11:34,235
We should check if there's enough
inventory in the warehouse.

157
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:38,989
Where was it again?

158
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,451
You take action.

159
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:45,287
You always take a proactive approach
to problem-solving.

160
00:11:46,330 --> 00:11:48,082
That's why I like you.

161
00:11:48,165 --> 00:11:49,417
Mr. Gong.

162
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,086
You've been acting strange
this whole time.

163
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:53,671
Is this a new form of bullying?

164
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:55,339
Drowning me in praise?

165
00:11:55,423 --> 00:11:57,383
You said I had no reason to like you.

166
00:11:58,092 --> 00:11:59,260
That's why I'm stating them.

167
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,594
My reasons.

168
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:11,439
TAEYU ART HALL
EXHIBITION PREPARATION IN PROGRESS

169
00:12:11,522 --> 00:12:14,108
I think we should add more leaves
at the top.

170
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,025
Noted.

171
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:17,528
Okay.

172
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,738
In a little bit,

173
00:12:19,822 --> 00:12:21,991
let's try switching out

174
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:24,326
the placement of the third photo

175
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,495
and those photos on the left side.

176
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,705
-Got it.
-Thank you.

177
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,332
Mr. Kim.

178
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,752
Why don't we take a short break?

179
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,629
Sure.

180
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,024
Are you waiting to hear from Ms. Go?

181
00:12:59,570 --> 00:13:02,239
Are you just going to keep being anxious?

182
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,658
I'm not anxious.

183
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,119
I told her how I felt.

184
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:08,496
No way. Really?

185
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:10,581
Good for you!

186
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:11,499
Just you wait.

187
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,459
You'll hear good news soon.

188
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:16,837
Good news?

189
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,880
Yes.

190
00:13:17,963 --> 00:13:19,048
Rejection.

191
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:24,261
Is that considered good news?

192
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,346
Of course.

193
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,431
Just look at the state you're in now.

194
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:30,976
You're suffering all alone,
unable to do anything.

195
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:34,355
This handsome face
is growing older by the day.

196
00:13:34,438 --> 00:13:36,649
It's much better
to just confess your feelings,

197
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:38,859
be flat-out rejected,
and give your mind a reset,

198
00:13:38,943 --> 00:13:40,152
so you can come to me.

199
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:42,029
Just get shot down if it's inevitable

200
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,822
and claim your new path in life.

201
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:45,491
Well,

202
00:13:46,575 --> 00:13:47,576
there's a chance

203
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:49,995
she might not reject me.

204
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:51,580
Come on now.

205
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:54,458
I thought she was your friend.
Don't you know her better than that?

206
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:57,044
She didn't strike me
as the intellectual type.

207
00:13:57,127 --> 00:13:58,837
Da-rim's smart.

208
00:13:58,921 --> 00:14:03,300
Yeah? Well, if she were so smart
and had such a discerning eye for men,

209
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:05,177
would she just have
overlooked you all this time?

210
00:14:06,095 --> 00:14:08,180
Only someone like me
would immediately recognize your worth.

211
00:14:14,478 --> 00:14:15,729
Excuse me, Ms. Lee.

212
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:17,523
Are you done with the scissors?

213
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:21,193
Thank you.

214
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,035
There's something
I've wanted to ask you for a long time.

215
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,788
What do the tattoos on your arm mean?

216
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:37,543
My dad is the boss
of the Yongho Gang in Bulgye-dong.

217
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,962
It's the gang's symbol,
so I got them done in middle school.

218
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,797
He's the boss?

219
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,758
I see.

220
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:48,262
Ma'am.

221
00:14:48,345 --> 00:14:49,597
I mean, Ms. Lee.

222
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:53,642
Please let me apologize in advance
if I ever made you uncomfortable

223
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,019
during your time here.

224
00:14:56,145 --> 00:14:57,771
-I was kidding.
-What?

225
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,482
I burned myself while making
instant noodles a long time ago.

226
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:02,943
I thought they'd scare Ji-yu,
so I covered them with tattoos.

227
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,570
Oh, that's what they are?

228
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,615
Ji-yu loves dragons and tigers.

229
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:09,742
I even do puppet shows with them.

230
00:15:10,242 --> 00:15:13,037
"I won't eat you
if you give me a rice cake."

231
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,917
-I guess your son is--
-Daughter.

232
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,668
I guess your daughter takes after you.

233
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,339
I appreciate you asking.

234
00:15:24,381 --> 00:15:25,215
Pardon?

235
00:15:25,299 --> 00:15:26,467
You're the first person

236
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,344
to ask about them.

237
00:15:28,969 --> 00:15:30,888
Everyone notices them but pretends not to.

238
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:35,726
All they see is a young mom with tattoos,

239
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,772
so they never seem interested
in getting to know me.

240
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,691
Don't be silly.

241
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,903
I only asked
because I thought it was a bit strange

242
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:48,530
to see someone cute like you
with such tattoos.

243
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:52,701
So I thought there must be
some sort of meaningful story behind them.

244
00:15:53,327 --> 00:15:54,161
I'm cute?

245
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:55,829
Of course.

246
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:58,457
That's not all.

247
00:16:00,084 --> 00:16:02,002
You're cool and smart.

248
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:04,004
And so much more.

249
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:10,636
I should finish this.

250
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,182
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

251
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:20,521
Why stay at a friend's place
instead of mine?

252
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:23,399
You haven't even known her that long.

253
00:16:24,566 --> 00:16:26,568
She's someone I can trust.

254
00:16:27,569 --> 00:16:30,364
I wouldn't be going through
with this divorce if it wasn't for her.

255
00:16:31,115 --> 00:16:32,408
How about you stay at a hotel?

256
00:16:32,491 --> 00:16:33,826
I'll book you the best one.

257
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,912
I'll only be anxious in a hotel
or at your place.

258
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,415
People will recognize me in no time.

259
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:43,210
Just tell your father
that I'm traveling abroad.

260
00:16:43,293 --> 00:16:45,337
But it'll still be uncomfortable.

261
00:16:45,963 --> 00:16:50,217
Someone as sensitive as you
will only get hurt. This won't do.

262
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,804
Mom, I'll just book you a hotel…

263
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:56,557
Mom!

264
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:00,144
Are you sure you told her
to meet you here?

265
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:01,395
What's taking her so long?

266
00:17:01,478 --> 00:17:02,855
This is the spot.

267
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:07,026
I'm sorry.

268
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,986
We're a bit late, aren't we?

269
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,030
No worries. We also just got here.

270
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:13,490
Mom!

271
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,492
Wait, Mom.

272
00:17:31,341 --> 00:17:32,509
Hold on a second.

273
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:34,136
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

274
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:36,096
Isn't he your team leader?

275
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:38,640
Yeah, he is.

276
00:17:38,724 --> 00:17:39,725
Mom.

277
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:43,103
Is this the friend you're staying with?

278
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:45,397
Yeah, she is.

279
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,567
My goodness.

280
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:50,861
Yes!

281
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:54,073
I can't believe this.

282
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,078
What are the chances?
It's nice to see you again.

283
00:17:59,161 --> 00:18:01,622
I'm glad to see
that you've recovered so quickly, Mother.

284
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,749
"Mother"?

285
00:18:03,832 --> 00:18:07,377
Oh, does your daughter
work for our company?

286
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:08,754
Yes.

287
00:18:08,837 --> 00:18:09,797
My goodness.

288
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:13,383
I had no idea
she was working at your company.

289
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,094
What a coincidence.

290
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,638
-This is Da-rim?
-Yes.

291
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,933
I've heard so much about you.

292
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:24,144
Are you sure you won't feel uncomfortable
with me staying over?

293
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,271
I'm worried our place might be too shabby.

294
00:18:26,355 --> 00:18:29,066
I just hope
you won't be too uncomfortable.

295
00:18:29,650 --> 00:18:31,610
There's no way she'd be.

296
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:34,404
My mother isn't that sensitive a person.

297
00:18:34,988 --> 00:18:38,450
She'll find it much more comfortable
to stay with a friend

298
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:39,451
than in a hotel alone.

299
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,373
All right, shall we go?

300
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,420
Welcome back.

301
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:52,631
Hey.

302
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,551
My baby, look at how much you've grown.

303
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:56,927
Say hello.

304
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,470
Hello.

305
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:00,264
How adorable. Is he your grandson?

306
00:19:00,347 --> 00:19:01,265
That's his son.

307
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:03,350
He's Da-rim's friend.

308
00:19:03,433 --> 00:19:04,643
He lives upstairs.

309
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:06,812
It's nice to meet you. I'm Kim Seon-u.

310
00:19:07,437 --> 00:19:09,148
Nice to meet you.

311
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,566
There they are.

312
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:12,734
-You're back.
-Hey, Seon-u.

313
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,736
Please excuse me.

314
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:16,989
Mr. Gong?

315
00:19:17,906 --> 00:19:19,700
What are you doing here?

316
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:23,287
It seems my mother and Da-rim's mother

317
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:25,330
have become inseparable best friends.

318
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:27,583
So here I am.

319
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,334
Right.

320
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:30,961
I see.

321
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:41,305
My goodness.

322
00:19:41,388 --> 00:19:43,432
Seon-u, you made all this by yourself?

323
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:46,101
No, Jun helped me.

324
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,394
-Right?
-Yes.

325
00:19:48,228 --> 00:19:49,897
Enjoy, Grandma.

326
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,732
Thank you so much.

327
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,483
I'll be sure to enjoy it.

328
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,569
My goodness. Let's dig in.

329
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:57,571
I don't even know where to start.

330
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:01,450
I wonder what this is.

331
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:07,998
Ma'am, have some meat.

332
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,294
Thank you. That looks delicious.

333
00:20:13,337 --> 00:20:14,671
You're the best.

334
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
Let's taste it.

335
00:20:19,343 --> 00:20:20,302
Mom.

336
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,059
Have some meat.

337
00:20:28,727 --> 00:20:31,855
Be sure to have
some Pyogo mushrooms and anchovies too.

338
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,190
They're good for healing bones.

339
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:36,276
Thank you.

340
00:20:42,407 --> 00:20:43,242
It's delicious.

341
00:20:43,951 --> 00:20:45,410
The stir-fried glass noodles
are seasoned perfectly.

342
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,663
I'm glad you like it.

343
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,917
You're so polite, and you're a great cook.

344
00:20:52,542 --> 00:20:54,044
You don't see
a lot of young men like him nowadays.

345
00:20:54,127 --> 00:20:55,587
Absolutely.

346
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:59,216
He's the perfect husband material.

347
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,343
He's such a good father too.

348
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,594
I'd love to have him as my son-in-law.

349
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,520
Here, have some fruit.

350
00:21:13,689 --> 00:21:14,564
Why is it so hot?

351
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,109
Slowly.

352
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,655
Be careful.

353
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:24,825
Should I do it?

354
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:28,704
That looks good.

355
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,372
My goodness.

356
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:32,708
You even removed the seeds from the kiwi.

357
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:34,418
There's one more.

358
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,718
Hold on.

359
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:44,344
Where are you going?

360
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,638
You said you'd do it by yourself.

361
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,515
But can't you keep me company?

362
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:49,975
I'm bored.

363
00:21:50,058 --> 00:21:52,352
Come on. How can you be bored
when you're doing the dishes?

364
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:55,063
Then can you brush my hair aside for me?
They keep poking my eyes.

365
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,066
Right here. Right above my eyes.

366
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,943
Okay, one second.

367
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:17,586
Da-rim.

368
00:22:18,545 --> 00:22:20,172
Do you know how pretty you are?

369
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:21,673
What?

370
00:22:23,008 --> 00:22:24,593
What's with you again?

371
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,053
That's another reason I like you.

372
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,221
You're pretty.

373
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:34,561
I just thought you should know.

374
00:22:36,813 --> 00:22:38,607
How can you say things like that out loud?

375
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:40,567
What if someone hears you?

376
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,693
Who cares?

377
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:43,904
How can you not care?
They could get the wrong idea.

378
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:45,072
There's no one around.

379
00:22:46,573 --> 00:22:47,532
Sorry.

380
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:49,326
Move aside.

381
00:22:49,409 --> 00:22:52,579
Lower your voice. What's wrong with you?

382
00:22:52,662 --> 00:22:55,540
-You're just really pretty.
-Be quiet, seriously!

383
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:58,502
-There's no one around.
-Yes, there is!

384
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:04,758
Why isn't he leaving?

385
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,967
It's so late.

386
00:23:06,968 --> 00:23:08,303
I can throw them out.

387
00:23:08,386 --> 00:23:09,763
Just let me take one.

388
00:23:09,846 --> 00:23:12,015
-Don't worry. I'm strong.
-Wait. Just let me.

389
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:13,725
-Wait.
-Why those two…

390
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:16,144
-I told you I'd do it.
-Stop. Hold on.

391
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,771
You don't have to do all this.

392
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:19,189
It's my duty as a son.

393
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,234
You're doing my mother a favor.
This is the least I could do.

394
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:32,702
It's getting late. You should head home.

395
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,995
I can take care of this.

396
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,997
Give it. I'll do it.

397
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,207
Wait…

398
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,250
No.

399
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,543
I'll do it.

400
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:40,919
I'll do it.

401
00:23:41,002 --> 00:23:42,337
-I'll do it.
-Hold on.

402
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,421
Wait. Stop.

403
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:44,589
I'll do it…

404
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,730
-What are we going to do now?
-Hold on.

405
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,860
I guess they were separated.
These are all cans.

406
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,737
Someone just had to rip the bag.

407
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,699
Oh, right. Light bulb.

408
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:13,118
-What?
-Do you have an extra at your place?

409
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,245
I don't think
I have any spare light bulbs.

410
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:16,663
I can just go buy one now.

411
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:18,874
I'll get you the brightest one
while I'm at it.

412
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,875
It's too dark in there.

413
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:22,460
-I'll go buy it.
-What?

414
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,880
I'll get you the brightest one.

415
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:26,756
-Okay!
-Wait, Mr. Gong!

416
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,425
-You don't…
-I was going to get it.

417
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,355
All done.

418
00:24:45,025 --> 00:24:47,986
The lights are all set.

419
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:50,739
Nice and bright, right?

420
00:24:53,241 --> 00:24:56,369
Who hangs something like that
in a bathroom?

421
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:58,330
I know, right?

422
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,207
It's like a department store.

423
00:25:01,458 --> 00:25:04,628
That's going to use up more electricity
than the fridge.

424
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,594
-Go. Hurry.
-Hold on a second.

425
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,055
It's not that I don't want to leave.

426
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:17,641
My mother's staying here,
and I have a duty as a son to--

427
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,434
There's no room for you to sleep in.

428
00:25:19,517 --> 00:25:21,228
Go home and sleep comfortably.

429
00:25:21,895 --> 00:25:22,938
-Mom!
-Wait.

430
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,940
Should I leave?

431
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,484
She says no.

432
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:29,194
Pick up your phone.

433
00:25:32,739 --> 00:25:33,615
What is it?

434
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:37,535
What a witty illustration.

435
00:25:43,291 --> 00:25:44,960
-So cute.
-Hey.

436
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:46,294
-So adorable.
-Hey!

437
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,421
You're here.

438
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:50,257
What has you so distracted?

439
00:25:51,007 --> 00:25:53,093
Who calls for advice at this hour?

440
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:54,844
I was in the middle
of something important.

441
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:55,762
Ji-hyeok.

442
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,014
You know that woman you met in Jeju?

443
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,808
Yeah, what about her?

444
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:01,226
Are you going to pursue her?

445
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:02,227
What, you're strongly against it?

446
00:26:03,979 --> 00:26:05,814
Do what your heart tells you.

447
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,649
When it comes to love,

448
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,777
your head will come up
with dozens of reasons to object,

449
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,154
but once the heartstrings are pulled,

450
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:15,031
you're helpless.

451
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,199
Like these guys.

452
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:19,911
Once you press the start button,
you can't stop in the middle.

453
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:22,497
Not until they go through the cycles

454
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,457
and stop on their own.

455
00:26:24,541 --> 00:26:25,750
Do you have a crush on someone?

456
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:27,043
I think so.

457
00:26:27,127 --> 00:26:28,503
Why is your head telling you no?

458
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:30,797
Well,

459
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:33,758
she works at our company.

460
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:38,221
I know you're against office romances.

461
00:26:38,847 --> 00:26:40,348
What's wrong with an office romance?

462
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:42,142
I think it's great.

463
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:43,560
You do?

464
00:26:43,643 --> 00:26:44,853
Of course.

465
00:26:44,936 --> 00:26:48,106
Hey, when you work closely with someone,

466
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:51,818
it's only natural for friendship to form
and feelings to develop.

467
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:53,737
That's not something that can be stopped.

468
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:56,281
No, it certainly can't be stopped.

469
00:26:56,906 --> 00:27:00,118
I just don't know what to do,
seeing the most adorable and pretty woman

470
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:01,661
in front of me all the time.

471
00:27:01,745 --> 00:27:02,912
Hold on. Stop.

472
00:27:05,081 --> 00:27:07,792
"The most adorable and pretty woman"?

473
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:09,586
-Yes.
-By any chance…

474
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,670
Yes.

475
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,840
-Go…
-Go?

476
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,342
-Go.
-Go?

477
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,218
-Go.
-Go?

478
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:18,470
Go--

479
00:27:21,514 --> 00:27:23,183
No, absolutely not.

480
00:27:24,225 --> 00:27:25,352
You can't go for her!

481
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:26,728
Why not?

482
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,897
You just said it was okay.

483
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:31,107
Is it because Go-eun is on our team?

484
00:27:36,446 --> 00:27:37,697
You were talking about Go-eun?

485
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,574
Yeah.

486
00:27:39,657 --> 00:27:40,867
So it was Go-eun.

487
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:44,162
She's great. You'd make a cute couple.

488
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:45,121
Your laundry is done.

489
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:46,122
Take it out.

490
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:51,252
What's wrong with him?

491
00:27:51,336 --> 00:27:52,420
MARKET AND COMPETITION ANALYSIS REPORT

492
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:55,715
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

493
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,718
I didn't mean to tell him.

494
00:27:58,802 --> 00:28:01,971
He made it sound like
he had already talked it over with you.

495
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:02,889
So you're saying

496
00:28:02,972 --> 00:28:05,683
he poked you once
and you just gave it all away

497
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,645
without a second thought, right?

498
00:28:12,732 --> 00:28:13,566
Mr. Ma.

499
00:28:14,234 --> 00:28:16,903
I gave you that job because you were
perceptive despite being incompetent,

500
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:18,905
but if you keep disappointing me
like this,

501
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:21,324
-you leave me no choice but to--
-Ma'am, please forgive me.

502
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,576
I swear this will never happen again.

503
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,286
I swear on my and my family's honor

504
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:28,081
that something like this
will never happen again.

505
00:28:28,164 --> 00:28:29,499
I'll make sure of it.

506
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:33,795
Who cares about family?

507
00:28:35,588 --> 00:28:38,299
You don't need to be on your knees.
Just sit down.

508
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:39,884
Yes, ma'am.

509
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:47,100
I realized this time
how cunning and sly that Yu Tae-yeong is.

510
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:49,310
You should stop associating with him.

511
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,187
Let's stick together and…

512
00:28:54,733 --> 00:28:56,776
It's as if he knows
we're talking about him.

513
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,987
Look at him calling.

514
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,448
You may leave.

515
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,330
YU TAE-YEONG

516
00:29:15,670 --> 00:29:16,921
They were so playful.

517
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:19,924
They had so much fun together.

518
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,301
Look at Da-rim.

519
00:29:23,094 --> 00:29:26,431
This is when Da-rim
went to Jirisan in elementary school.

520
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:28,141
She was whining about her legs hurting,

521
00:29:28,224 --> 00:29:29,726
so her dad carried her
all the way to the top.

522
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:31,019
To the top of the mountain?

523
00:29:31,102 --> 00:29:32,395
My goodness.

524
00:29:32,479 --> 00:29:33,605
Look at this.

525
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:37,066
Every birthday, our house used to be
covered in whipped cream.

526
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:40,361
Your family looks so happy.

527
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:42,989
My husband was a taxi driver.

528
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:45,408
They didn't get
the most affluent upbringing,

529
00:29:45,492 --> 00:29:49,120
but he took them on countless road trips
across the country for sightseeing

530
00:29:49,204 --> 00:29:50,747
on his days off.

531
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,627
Our family got along really well.

532
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:58,046
This is Da-rim again.

533
00:29:58,129 --> 00:29:59,923
What are you all looking at?

534
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:01,466
Mom!

535
00:30:01,549 --> 00:30:03,593
Why would you show them this?

536
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,679
I was showing them
because In-ae was curious.

537
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:11,476
This is basically a collection
of my most embarrassing moments.

538
00:30:11,559 --> 00:30:14,103
No, it's not. You were adorable.

539
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:18,441
I should've taken Ji-hyeok
on outings and trips

540
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:21,319
when he was a kid.

541
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:24,322
But I couldn't
because I was always in the hospital.

542
00:30:24,906 --> 00:30:26,658
Why would you say that?

543
00:30:34,541 --> 00:30:38,086
Why don't we go on an outing now?

544
00:30:38,169 --> 00:30:39,045
The weather's so nice.

545
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,255
Now?

546
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:41,381
Yes.

547
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,716
We just need to pack some food
and a picnic blanket.

548
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:46,886
How does that sound? What do you say?

549
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,137
-I'm in.
-You're in.

550
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,681
-Let's go.
-All right.

551
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:51,724
-Great.
-This is going to be so fun.

552
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:53,268
Let's do it.

553
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,607
What a pretty park.

554
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,860
Did you really build it?

555
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:05,280
It wasn't me. Our company did.

556
00:31:06,698 --> 00:31:09,367
If it wasn't for you,
they would've never built it,

557
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:10,827
so it's only right that you take credit.

558
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,289
I'm going to start coming here often.

559
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,040
-Then, I'll--
-I will!

560
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,002
I'll bring you here often.

561
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:23,131
They say walking in nature like this
is excellent for your health.

562
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:27,594
As expected, you're the only one
who truly cares about me, Seon-u.

563
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:32,473
Hey.

564
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:35,435
Doesn't Jun need to go to academies?

565
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:37,770
I heard kids are really busy nowadays.

566
00:31:39,105 --> 00:31:40,940
Even daycares are closed on Sundays.

567
00:31:46,362 --> 00:31:47,572
Everyone.

568
00:31:47,655 --> 00:31:48,823
You must all be thirsty.

569
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:50,700
-I'll--
-I'll go get some drinks!

570
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,288
You can go ahead
and relax under that tree over there.

571
00:31:55,371 --> 00:31:56,956
I'll be back with some drinks soon.

572
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:58,291
Where? That tree?

573
00:31:58,374 --> 00:31:59,792
Yes, under that tree right there.

574
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,544
No, hold on.

575
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:03,379
I'll get the drinks.

576
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:05,590
I'll get them.

577
00:32:05,673 --> 00:32:07,634
It's our park,
so it's only right that I buy them.

578
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:08,801
Do you even know
what Da-rim's mother likes?

579
00:32:10,011 --> 00:32:11,387
The one who knows should get them.

580
00:32:15,892 --> 00:32:17,143
Don't fight.

581
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,854
Why don't you play a game for it?

582
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:21,564
The winner gets to go.

583
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,256
Two to two.

584
00:32:47,924 --> 00:32:49,676
Kim Seon-u's serve.

585
00:33:05,858 --> 00:33:06,859
What's gotten into them?

586
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:09,529
Are they training for the Olympics?

587
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,738
Tell me about it.

588
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:37,223
Excuse me.

589
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
It's my serve.

590
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,602
-Hand it over.
-It was out. It's my serve.

591
00:33:41,686 --> 00:33:43,938
It was in. It was inside the line.

592
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,940
It was out. Don't play dirty.

593
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:47,066
It was in. It's my serve!

594
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,401
It was out. It's my serve!

595
00:33:48,484 --> 00:33:49,444
-In!
-Out!

596
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,120
Ta-da!

597
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,706
Cinnamon punch and rice punch
for the mothers.

598
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:04,250
And banana milk for Jun.

599
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:06,878
Herbal tea for you, right?

600
00:34:06,961 --> 00:34:08,212
-Yeah. Thank you.
-No problem.

601
00:34:08,296 --> 00:34:09,172
Ji-hyeok.

602
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:10,798
Don't you want a drink?

603
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,719
I'm not thirsty.

604
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,806
Are you sure? Your lips look very dry.

605
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:26,105
Oh, you know,

606
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:30,151
Ji-hyeok is really good at sports too.

607
00:34:30,902 --> 00:34:33,446
He even won a taekwondo competition
when he was a kid.

608
00:34:34,614 --> 00:34:36,657
Wow, he did?

609
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:37,700
That reminds me.

610
00:34:37,784 --> 00:34:40,161
Seon-u competed in
all sorts of competitions as well.

611
00:34:40,244 --> 00:34:43,247
He was on the badminton team
in middle school.

612
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:45,792
I believe he placed third in nationals.

613
00:34:46,751 --> 00:34:47,668
Second.

614
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:49,670
-Yeah, you placed second.
-Oh, right.

615
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,506
Seriously?

616
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:53,466
You were a former athlete?

617
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:58,638
How could a former athlete
go all out against an amateur?

618
00:34:59,222 --> 00:35:00,389
You don't have any manners, do you?

619
00:35:00,473 --> 00:35:02,517
How unbelievable.

620
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,645
I would've totally won
if we had done taekwondo.

621
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:08,314
Of course.

622
00:35:15,279 --> 00:35:16,948
Your wife went on a trip?

623
00:35:18,574 --> 00:35:20,910
I thought she was still recovering.

624
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:25,248
That's why she went to Switzerland
to recuperate.

625
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:29,669
Does she not want her son to get married?

626
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:32,797
I mean, we're in no rush.

627
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,924
I sincerely apologize for everything.

628
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,844
We'll set a date
as soon as my wife returns.

629
00:35:39,095 --> 00:35:40,930
This is making me rather anxious.

630
00:35:41,013 --> 00:35:43,808
What are you going to do
about Ji-hyeok's position?

631
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:47,979
Surely you won't let him get married
with just a team leader title.

632
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:49,188
Of course not.

633
00:35:49,272 --> 00:35:52,233
He'll be promoted to vice president soon.
Don't worry.

634
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:54,485
Father.

635
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:55,653
Vice president?

636
00:35:57,321 --> 00:36:00,825
The board members will strongly oppose
such a sudden promotion.

637
00:36:00,908 --> 00:36:03,286
Who would dare oppose me
when I'm trying to properly train my son?

638
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,372
He's going to do great things,
so his title should reflect that.

639
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:10,293
Your father's right.

640
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:12,295
Yes.

641
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,307
You said you'd help me stop
Ji-hyeok and Ha-yeong's wedding.

642
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:27,143
First, I need to know why.

643
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:30,104
How could you go straight into work talk
without any small talk first?

644
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,399
I even ordered single malt, your favorite.

645
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,860
Neat, right?

646
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,371
Gutsy.

647
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:50,917
So tell me.

648
00:36:51,918 --> 00:36:52,877
What are you thinking?

649
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:55,713
Money.

650
00:36:55,796 --> 00:36:57,715
I'm just trying to make some money.
What else?

651
00:36:57,798 --> 00:36:59,008
I'm a single-minded guy.

652
00:36:59,091 --> 00:37:01,177
Breaking off the marriage
is just a side thing.

653
00:37:01,969 --> 00:37:02,887
Natural BeBe.

654
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,473
I'll make sure it becomes yours.

655
00:37:06,557 --> 00:37:07,600
How?

656
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:12,271
Gong Chang-ho. Gong Ji-hyeok.

657
00:37:13,272 --> 00:37:14,398
We just have to push both of them out.

658
00:37:17,026 --> 00:37:18,236
So how, exactly?

659
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:22,031
I'm actually one of Natural BeBe's
major shareholders.

660
00:37:22,114 --> 00:37:23,449
What? You are?

661
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,076
Recently, your company carried out

662
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,495
a paid-in capital increase
to secure funds for overseas expansion.

663
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,871
I bought all of it.

664
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,916
If we pool our shares,

665
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,210
it should be about the same
as Chairman Gong's.

666
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,878
No.

667
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:37,964
That won't be enough.

668
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,675
A motion to dismiss the chairman could be
brought to the shareholders' meeting,

669
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,093
but to make it pass,

670
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,971
we'd also need votes
from the minority shareholders.

671
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:46,597
But why would they go out of their way

672
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:48,307
to change leadership?

673
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:53,646
That's why your role is important.

674
00:37:54,272 --> 00:37:57,316
For ten years, you've been the successor
who handled the actual operations

675
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:58,859
and the one who knows…

676
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:03,030
all about Chairman Gong's weaknesses.

677
00:38:03,114 --> 00:38:04,991
Are you telling me
to go against my father?

678
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:06,701
Publicly, at that?

679
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:08,703
Then I'll…

680
00:38:08,786 --> 00:38:13,541
No. We, the investors,
will appoint you the new CEO,

681
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:15,418
and in exchange,

682
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:18,504
all you need to do
is provide our fund a generous dividend.

683
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:21,632
What about your father?

684
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:25,136
Do you think
he'll just sit back and watch?

685
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:31,434
My father's even more single-minded
than I am.

686
00:38:31,517 --> 00:38:34,145
Nothing else matters
as long as he makes money.

687
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:37,315
He can marry off Ha-yeong
to another family.

688
00:38:38,149 --> 00:38:39,900
This will probably make him happier.

689
00:38:42,987 --> 00:38:44,238
That does make sense.

690
00:38:48,951 --> 00:38:51,162
But how can I trust you?

691
00:38:52,246 --> 00:38:54,332
Why? Do you think I'm messing with you?

692
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,792
Then,

693
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,669
I guess

694
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:00,671
I have to show you I'm serious.

695
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,425
Soon.

696
00:39:18,606 --> 00:39:19,690
Wow, this looks so good.

697
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,650
He ordered so much.

698
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:23,611
You're the best, mister!

699
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:24,945
Eat up.

700
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:27,365
But Jun, you should just call me Ji-hyeok.

701
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:28,783
Okay.

702
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:30,618
Having him call you by your name
is a bit of a stretch, no?

703
00:39:30,701 --> 00:39:32,787
Jun, just call him Uncle Ji-hyeok.

704
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,038
Why?

705
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,581
You can call handsome guys
by their names, okay?

706
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:39,460
I don't think you're handsome enough
to call yourself that.

707
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,045
So you do find me handsome.

708
00:39:41,128 --> 00:39:42,838
No, that's not exactly what I meant.

709
00:39:42,922 --> 00:39:44,256
-Ma'am.
-Yeah?

710
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,674
Can you pour me a drink?

711
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:49,136
Of course, we need to have a drink
on a day like this.

712
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:51,680
We can't,
so you should drink on our behalf.

713
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:53,099
Just leave it to me.

714
00:39:58,854 --> 00:40:00,356
You should drink slowly.

715
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,565
I'm fine.

716
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:02,483
Are you sure?

717
00:40:03,109 --> 00:40:04,610
-Are you?
-It's nice and sweet.

718
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:07,029
Just watching him drink
is lifting my spirits.

719
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:09,782
-Can you pour me one as well?
-Wait.

720
00:40:13,452 --> 00:40:15,037
-In that glass?
-Yes.

721
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:16,497
I'll drink on your behalf.

722
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,004
How exciting.

723
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,800
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS
NAME: KIM IN-AE

724
00:40:27,883 --> 00:40:31,303
CERTIFICATE OF FAMILY RELATIONS
NAME: KIM IN-AE

725
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:38,936
Come in.

726
00:40:46,902 --> 00:40:48,821
I could've gotten it myself.

727
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,824
Thank you.

728
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:56,454
That's a lot of medicine.

729
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:02,209
There are sleeping pills

730
00:41:02,751 --> 00:41:05,463
and some psychiatric medication as well.

731
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,380
I see.

732
00:41:07,047 --> 00:41:10,259
Could you keep me company for a bit?

733
00:41:12,386 --> 00:41:16,182
That's why I stopped that marriage.

734
00:41:17,266 --> 00:41:18,559
I wanted Ji-hyeok

735
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:21,020
to live a happy life

736
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:23,898
with the person he loves.

737
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,108
I had no idea

738
00:41:27,568 --> 00:41:30,279
that Mr. Gong had such a past.

739
00:41:31,238 --> 00:41:34,867
It's been such a long time
since I've seen Ji-hyeok

740
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:36,660
whining and showing off like a kid.

741
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:40,998
He had no choice
but to grow up quickly because of me.

742
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,667
He's always been mature

743
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,337
and swallowed all his feelings.

744
00:41:47,129 --> 00:41:49,507
He's mature?

745
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,133
Why?

746
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,512
I guess he acts quite differently
when he's around you.

747
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,013
No, it's just that

748
00:41:56,096 --> 00:42:00,184
I can easily see
what he's feeling in the moment.

749
00:42:00,267 --> 00:42:03,145
Sometimes, he actually seems to
display his feelings on purpose.

750
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:08,567
It must be because he's attracted
to your bright energy.

751
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:10,778
I'm not bright at all.

752
00:42:10,861 --> 00:42:12,821
I can't even see two steps ahead.

753
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,039
The bright energy

754
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,834
of someone who grew up
with a loving family like yours

755
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,921
emanates from within.

756
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:32,591
You might not see it,

757
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,635
but it's crystal clear

758
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,596
to someone like me or Ji-hyeok

759
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,099
who has been hurt by love.

760
00:42:41,475 --> 00:42:44,728
The strong and warm energy.

761
00:42:46,939 --> 00:42:50,901
That's why whenever we come across it,
we can't help but admire it

762
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:52,945
and be drawn to it.

763
00:42:57,700 --> 00:42:59,702
I hope you'll continue

764
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:03,414
to get along well with Ji-hyeok.

765
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:19,888
Gosh, here you are working your tail off,
while I'm living in the lap of luxury.

766
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,974
Oh, is In-ae sleeping?

767
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:23,684
Not yet.

768
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:25,644
She was looking at some documents.

769
00:43:26,395 --> 00:43:29,106
She's been through a lot as well.

770
00:43:29,648 --> 00:43:31,734
I don't know how she survived
all those years.

771
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:36,405
But you know,
she did such a good job raising her son.

772
00:43:36,488 --> 00:43:37,781
He's so handsome.

773
00:43:39,074 --> 00:43:41,827
He's just like your dad when he was young.

774
00:43:44,997 --> 00:43:45,831
Mom.

775
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:47,916
What did Dad say to you

776
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,170
when he told you that he liked you?

777
00:43:51,837 --> 00:43:53,547
Why? Did someone say they like you?

778
00:43:53,631 --> 00:43:55,132
No, it's just a thought that popped up

779
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,301
when we were looking
at the photo album earlier.

780
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,428
When someone tells you that they like you,

781
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:02,765
is there a way to tell

782
00:44:02,848 --> 00:44:04,767
whether they're being genuine or not?

783
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,061
What a silly thing to wonder.

784
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:12,107
Your dad never confessed
his feelings for me.

785
00:44:12,191 --> 00:44:13,150
Really?

786
00:44:13,651 --> 00:44:15,152
Then how did you start dating?

787
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,279
He just kept showing up.

788
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:21,450
He never once asked me out,

789
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:24,244
but whenever I found myself in trouble,

790
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,331
he would just show up out of nowhere
and help me out.

791
00:44:28,040 --> 00:44:31,251
As that kept happening,

792
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,087
I just came to realize it.

793
00:44:33,170 --> 00:44:36,173
"He likes me."

794
00:44:38,425 --> 00:44:39,510
I see.

795
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,889
To figure someone out, watch how they act,

796
00:44:44,390 --> 00:44:46,016
not what they say.

797
00:44:46,100 --> 00:44:47,643
Then you'll know

798
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,728
whether they're being genuine or not.

799
00:45:12,042 --> 00:45:13,252
It's warm.

800
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,134
Watch how they act?

801
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:22,219
Go Da-rim!

802
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,262
Come out!

803
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:32,521
Thank goodness.

804
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:46,160
Liver, pancreas, lungs.

805
00:45:46,743 --> 00:45:48,036
Which should we sell first?

806
00:45:50,747 --> 00:45:51,665
Let me buy them off you.

807
00:45:52,249 --> 00:45:53,208
Do you take credit?

808
00:45:55,461 --> 00:45:56,295
LOVE PORRIDGE

809
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:57,796
What's this?

810
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,506
I'm allergic to abalones,

811
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:01,717
but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.

812
00:46:01,800 --> 00:46:03,510
They were half price
at the shop out front.

813
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:05,179
Just the ginger tea.

814
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,638
You said you had gastritis.

815
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,641
I need to have a drink on a day like this.

816
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:11,143
Then you should
at least eat something first.

817
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:15,314
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

818
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,024
Can't you get your act together?

819
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,151
Are you feeling sick?

820
00:46:22,779 --> 00:46:23,822
Ms. Go Da-rim?

821
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:25,699
Da-rim. Ms. Go.

822
00:46:25,782 --> 00:46:26,658
Da-rim.

823
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,452
Da-rim.

824
00:46:32,247 --> 00:46:35,000
To figure someone out, watch how they act,

825
00:46:35,584 --> 00:46:37,169
not what they say.

826
00:46:49,306 --> 00:46:52,267
That's why I like you.

827
00:47:21,255 --> 00:47:23,966
A GREEN FUTURE WE DRAW TOGETHER
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION

828
00:47:31,431 --> 00:47:32,808
In this section,

829
00:47:32,891 --> 00:47:35,477
we combined purple
and light blue butterflies

830
00:47:35,561 --> 00:47:37,980
to portray the harmony of nature.

831
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:41,817
We focused on how their expressions
changed depending on the environment.

832
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:43,986
You can use this to take them.

833
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:46,154
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

834
00:47:46,655 --> 00:47:48,031
-You can use this.
-Thanks.

835
00:47:48,115 --> 00:47:49,157
Enjoy.

836
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,076
Thank you for coming.

837
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,828
Enjoy.

838
00:47:53,412 --> 00:47:54,746
Hello, please take this with you.

839
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,206
Please take one.

840
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:57,416
Thank you for coming.

841
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:58,458
-Here you go.
-I enjoyed the exhibition.

842
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,543
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

843
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,502
Here you go.

844
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:03,130
Enjoy the exhibition. Thank you.

845
00:48:03,213 --> 00:48:04,172
Here you go.

846
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:06,842
Enjoy the exhibition. Thank you.

847
00:48:06,925 --> 00:48:09,428
It's so nice to see you
working on such a big project together

848
00:48:09,511 --> 00:48:11,221
before you walk down the aisle.

849
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,725
Ji-hyeok has been such a huge help.

850
00:48:14,808 --> 00:48:16,018
Thank you for your kind words.

851
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,562
I was worried because I didn't recognize
the photographer's name,

852
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,938
but his pieces are great.

853
00:48:20,022 --> 00:48:21,940
Aren't they? His name is Kim Seon-u.

854
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:23,275
-He's a hidden gem I discovered.
-Hello.

855
00:48:23,358 --> 00:48:25,277
-I'll set up a meeting later.
-Thank you.

856
00:48:26,278 --> 00:48:27,487
Let's go.

857
00:48:31,366 --> 00:48:33,702
You're putting your heart and soul
into promoting Kim Seon-u.

858
00:48:33,785 --> 00:48:35,037
Of course.

859
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:36,622
A great example
of being a supportive partner.

860
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,248
How nice.

861
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:41,376
Yes.

862
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,552
Da-rim, come here.

863
00:48:50,636 --> 00:48:52,095
-Okay. Coming.
-Hurry.

864
00:48:52,179 --> 00:48:53,263
Just a moment.

865
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,234
We thought you'd be better than us.

866
00:49:06,902 --> 00:49:09,321
I mean, I learned English at school, but…

867
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,467
Location?

868
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:35,806
Oh, the place where we took the photos.

869
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:39,017
Well… Gangwon-do?

870
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:40,977
-Gangwon-do.
-Right.

871
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,941
Sokcho is… Delicious food.

872
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:48,276
-Korean traditional delicious food.
-My goodness.

873
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,862
Look at those ignorant stay-at-home moms.

874
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,364
Should I just get rid of them?

875
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:53,990
Why would you?

876
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:55,701
They're doing so well.

877
00:49:55,784 --> 00:49:57,661
The more ignorant they are, the better.

878
00:49:58,203 --> 00:49:59,579
The chairman could hear about it.

879
00:50:02,457 --> 00:50:04,292
What are we going to do about this?

880
00:50:21,518 --> 00:50:22,894
How is he even good at English?

881
00:50:28,817 --> 00:50:30,152
I just want to clarify

882
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:33,447
that my going around with Ha-yeong today
is strictly all for business.

883
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:35,782
Why would you tell me that?

884
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,534
So you don't get the wrong idea
like last time.

885
00:50:38,994 --> 00:50:40,954
It's awkward for me too, okay?
I'm just trying to get through it.

886
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,080
Jeez.

887
00:50:42,914 --> 00:50:44,875
-Give it to me.
-No, I can do it.

888
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:45,792
I'll do it.

889
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,420
-Are you okay?
-I'm sorry.

890
00:50:48,503 --> 00:50:49,796
Please sit. I'll take care of it.

891
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,597
You didn't seem awkward at all.

892
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:00,682
Even your outfits are matching,

893
00:51:00,766 --> 00:51:02,225
you were linking arms
all tightly and whatnot,

894
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,728
and it seemed like
you couldn't take your eyes off of her.

895
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:06,396
That's because I'm a good actor.

896
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,689
I don't think that's what it is.

897
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:09,983
It just looked like you two
were very close and being very sweet.

898
00:51:10,066 --> 00:51:11,318
But I mean, sure, I understand.

899
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,986
Of course. You're acting.

900
00:51:13,069 --> 00:51:14,196
Ji-hyeok.

901
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:20,243
You should go take care of your business.

902
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,703
I'm also busy with my business.

903
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,163
Yeah, I'm coming.

904
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,295
Hello, everyone.

905
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:32,464
I'm Kim Seon-u, the photographer
of the photography exhibition,

906
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:33,632
A Green Future We Draw Together.

907
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,766
Stop it!

908
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:51,858
First, I'd like to thank you all
for making time to come today.

909
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,653
-Now, let me walk you through
-Stop it!

910
00:51:54,736 --> 00:51:56,196
-each piece in the exhibition.
-Stop it!

911
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,073
-Stop it!
-Stop it!

912
00:51:58,156 --> 00:52:00,283
-Behind me, you'll see--
-Stop it!

913
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,452
I told you to stop it!

914
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:04,871
-Seo-yeon.
-Stop it!

915
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:06,039
You stop!

916
00:52:06,122 --> 00:52:07,958
Stop it!

917
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,003
Stop it!

918
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,922
-Pardon me for a moment.
-You stop.

919
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:18,176
It seems the kids got bored.

920
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:20,053
I'm sorry.

921
00:52:20,136 --> 00:52:23,139
They don't want to play the game either,
so we'll just leave.

922
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:24,975
If you don't mind,

923
00:52:25,058 --> 00:52:28,854
we can look after them
while you go on the docent tour.

924
00:52:28,937 --> 00:52:29,855
Are you sure?

925
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:30,981
-Of course.
-Sure.

926
00:52:31,731 --> 00:52:33,817
-Let's go play outside.
-Come on.

927
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:36,319
-It's all right.
-Follow us.

928
00:52:36,403 --> 00:52:39,239
-Let's have some fun outside.
-Thank you for your understanding.

929
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:44,619
All right, I'll start walking you
through the pieces in the exhibition.

930
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:49,708
Hello!

931
00:52:49,791 --> 00:52:51,877
We're the dinosaur family.

932
00:52:51,960 --> 00:52:54,212
Do you want to guess what I am?

933
00:52:55,338 --> 00:52:56,464
Do you know what I am?

934
00:52:56,548 --> 00:52:57,716
-Brachiosaurus.
-Brachiosaurus.

935
00:52:57,799 --> 00:53:00,760
You're so smart. Then what about this one?

936
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,971
-Tyrannosaurus.
-Correct!

937
00:53:04,306 --> 00:53:05,557
Thank you so much.

938
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,392
I got to enjoy the exhibition
thanks to you.

939
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,103
I went back to work three months
after my kids were born,

940
00:53:10,186 --> 00:53:11,730
so I can barely play with them.

941
00:53:13,189 --> 00:53:14,149
You're so amazing.

942
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,775
Not at all.

943
00:53:15,859 --> 00:53:16,985
After raising three kids,

944
00:53:17,068 --> 00:53:19,237
it just comes naturally
without even trying.

945
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:21,489
-Thank you.
-Mommy!

946
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:23,366
-Yeah, Seo-yeon?
-Oh no.

947
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,285
Seo-yeon, you should've been careful.

948
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,662
-I'm sorry.
-Oh gosh.

949
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,123
No worries, it's okay.

950
00:53:30,206 --> 00:53:31,333
Don't worry about it.

951
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:33,251
Stuff happens.

952
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,962
-Let me pay for dry--
-No, that won't be necessary.

953
00:53:37,631 --> 00:53:38,506
Are you sure?

954
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:40,508
I'll go wash this off.

955
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:41,635
Okay.

956
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,428
Bye. High five!

957
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:44,971
Yeah!

958
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,182
We've only been causing trouble.

959
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,436
He's a very kind man.

960
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,505
You came.

961
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:22,592
Let's get out of here.

962
00:54:23,468 --> 00:54:24,719
Already?

963
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:25,720
You just got here.

964
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,472
What's there to see here?

965
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,516
I'll show you something more entertaining.

966
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,342
DEPUTY DIRECTOR YU HA-YEONG

967
00:55:10,306 --> 00:55:11,141
Who are you?

968
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:43,506
Who the hell are you?

969
00:56:40,563 --> 00:56:43,149
What about this one? It's a turtle.

970
00:56:50,698 --> 00:56:51,533
What's that sound?

971
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:05,588
Everyone!

972
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:08,716
We need to evacuate everyone quickly.

973
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:10,260
Hurry!

974
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,055
Let's get out of here.

975
00:57:17,851 --> 00:57:18,726
Hurry!

976
00:57:52,927 --> 00:57:54,345
Stop!

977
00:58:01,144 --> 00:58:02,228
Everyone,

978
00:58:02,312 --> 00:58:05,982
if we move in an orderly fashion,
we can all get out of here safely.

979
00:58:06,065 --> 00:58:09,444
Stand behind the person in front of you
and calmly make your way to the exit.

980
00:58:09,527 --> 00:58:11,321
Please follow these flashing lights.

981
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,990
-Please come this way!
-Remain calm!

982
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:15,867
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

983
00:58:15,950 --> 00:58:17,827
-Please follow the lights!
-Remain calm!

984
00:58:17,911 --> 00:58:18,828
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

985
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,747
-Don't run! Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

986
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:21,956
-Don't run!
-Keep moving!

987
00:58:22,040 --> 00:58:24,167
-Slowly!
-Keep moving!

988
00:58:24,250 --> 00:58:25,752
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

989
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,712
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

990
00:58:27,795 --> 00:58:29,255
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

991
00:58:29,339 --> 00:58:31,758
-Don't run!
-Remain calm!

992
00:58:31,841 --> 00:58:32,926
-Remain calm!
-Remain calm!

993
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:36,262
Can we get the names
of the people in this group?

994
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:37,764
-Okay, thank you.
-Can I get your name?

995
00:58:37,847 --> 00:58:40,475
-It's Lee Min-cheol.
-Mr. Lee Min-cheol. Confirmed.

996
00:58:40,558 --> 00:58:42,227
Ma'am, what's your child's name?

997
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,895
-Here's some water.
-Ha-eun?

998
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:46,231
Yes, Ha-eun. What about your name, ma'am?

999
00:58:46,814 --> 00:58:47,857
Is there anyone missing?

1000
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:50,235
-I think my group made it out.
-Mine too.

1001
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:52,153
-Mine too. I think that's everyone.
-Okay.

1002
00:58:52,237 --> 00:58:53,112
-Thank goodness.
-Wait…

1003
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,657
What about Mr. Gong?

1004
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:57,825
-Mr. Gong?
-I haven't seen him for a while.

1005
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,994
-I didn't see him.
-Didn't he come out with us?

1006
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:01,871
I'll go wash this off.

1007
00:59:01,955 --> 00:59:04,457
Wait, it's been a while
since I've seen him.

1008
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:06,584
-Wait, Da-rim!
-Ms. Go!

1009
00:59:06,668 --> 00:59:07,502
-Where are you going?
-Stop!

1010
00:59:07,585 --> 00:59:09,254
-Ms. Go!
-Da-rim!

1011
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,296
It's too dangerous!

1012
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,006
Stop! Oh no, what do we do?

1013
00:59:14,801 --> 00:59:15,802
Mr. Gong!

1014
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:18,513
Mr…

1015
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,474
Mr. Gong!

1016
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:28,439
Mr. Gong!

1017
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,192
Mr. Gong!

1018
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:37,657
Mr. Gong!

1019
00:59:37,740 --> 00:59:39,617
You need to wake up!

1020
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,119
Oh no!

1021
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:42,537
Mr. Gong!

1022
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:56,217
Mr. Gong.

1023
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:58,344
You need to wake up, Mr. Gong.

1024
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:00,013
Oh no.

1025
01:00:01,723 --> 01:00:03,182
Mr. Gong.

1026
01:00:31,836 --> 01:00:33,046
Mr. Gong.

1027
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:34,756
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

1028
01:00:34,839 --> 01:00:36,257
Wake up!

1029
01:00:37,592 --> 01:00:39,636
Oh no…

1030
01:00:39,719 --> 01:00:40,928
Mr. Gong!

1031
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:41,846
Mr. Gong…

1032
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:43,514
Mr. Gong?

1033
01:00:45,224 --> 01:00:46,267
Try sitting up.

1034
01:00:47,477 --> 01:00:48,936
Are you okay?

1035
01:00:50,897 --> 01:00:51,814
Oh no.

1036
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,567
Can you hear me?

1037
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:56,694
Thank goodness.

1038
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,072
Do you know how scared I was

1039
01:00:59,697 --> 01:01:01,199
that something might've happened to you?

1040
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,522
I need to…

1041
01:01:34,357 --> 01:01:35,650
tell you something.

1042
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:41,406
There are no particular reasons

1043
01:01:42,657 --> 01:01:43,991
as to why I like you.

1044
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:48,413
I just like you for who you are.

1045
01:01:51,457 --> 01:01:52,959
You're Go Da-rim.

1046
01:01:58,840 --> 01:02:00,091
That's why I like you.

1047
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:05,096
I love you.

1048
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:33,875
DYNAMITE KISS

1049
01:03:03,988 --> 01:03:05,406
I think office romances are great.

1050
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:07,366
We need to be careful at work.

1051
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:09,243
Do you know how anxious I am?

1052
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:10,578
But what can I do?
I like you so much, it's killing me.

1053
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,998
How about sending the Mother TF Team
to support the CS team?

1054
01:03:14,081 --> 01:03:16,459
I'm going to get rid of the whole team.

1055
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,211
Please don't do this.

1056
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:19,504
There's been a misunderstanding.

1057
01:03:19,587 --> 01:03:20,588
What misunderstanding?

1058
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:22,298
Are you that crazy bitch?

1059
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,591
Yeah, that's her voice!

1060
01:03:23,674 --> 01:03:26,093
An affair with the troublemaker
who's tarnishing the company's image.

1061
01:03:26,177 --> 01:03:27,887
That should be enough
to get rid of Gong Ji-hyeok.

1062
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,139
You're okay. You're not alone anymore.

1063
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:31,849
I'll always be by your side.

1064
01:03:31,933 --> 01:03:33,142
From now on until forever.

1065
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:43,736
