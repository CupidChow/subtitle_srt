2
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:01,936
Hello, Ms. Go. Good morning.

3
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:03,354
-Good morning, Ms. Go.
-Ms. Go.

4
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:04,898
Here is this week's schedule.

5
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,191
-Thanks.
-Ma'am…

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:07,525
-Yes, that's right.
-Could you approve this?

7
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,985
I'll review it all upstairs.

8
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:17,368
CEO GO DA-RIM

9
00:01:17,452 --> 00:01:19,204
Mondays, as always, are so challenging.

10
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:20,955
Okay.

11
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:49,150
Okay.

12
00:01:54,197 --> 00:01:55,949
And what is this?

13
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:07,252
Okay. I accept this proposal.

14
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:26,604
Hold on. What did you say
your name was again, Newbie?

15
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:28,314
My name is…

16
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,483
My name is…

17
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,694
Noryangjin.

18
00:02:33,444 --> 00:02:35,446
It is Noryangjin.

19
00:02:39,367 --> 00:02:41,452
-Noryangjin.
-This stop is Noryangjin Station.

20
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:53,673
This stop is Noryangjin Station.

21
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,760
Sorry. Please hold the door.

22
00:02:58,803 --> 00:03:03,725
DYNAMITE KISS

23
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:05,768
EPISODE 1

24
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:33,087
Careful. You're okay here. Take your time.

25
00:03:37,258 --> 00:03:38,968
There you go.

26
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,599
Excuse me.

27
00:03:44,682 --> 00:03:45,683
NORYANGJIN VICTORY ACADEMY

28
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:48,937
"Number two describes
decision-making in a highly cohesive,

29
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,314
yet chaotic organization."

30
00:03:51,397 --> 00:03:52,982
Incorrect. "Problematic preferences arise

31
00:03:53,066 --> 00:03:56,277
because the causal links
between goals and means remain unclear."

32
00:03:57,111 --> 00:03:59,572
Seriously?
Are you all really dozing off right now?

33
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:01,950
Just look at Ms. Go Da-rim here.

34
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,409
Me?

35
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:08,039
I have never once seen Ms. Go Da-rim
fall asleep in my lecture.

36
00:04:09,707 --> 00:04:12,168
Even when you pour
your heart into studying for it,

37
00:04:12,252 --> 00:04:15,129
this exam could still squander away
five years of your life.

38
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,131
"Squander away" sounds a bit…

39
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:18,716
"Veteran examinee" is sugarcoating it.

40
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,761
You're in your thirties now.
You're basically a Noryangjin zombie now.

41
00:04:22,345 --> 00:04:24,472
Do you want to grow old like this zombie?

42
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:25,390
-No.
-No.

43
00:04:25,473 --> 00:04:26,975
-You don't, right?
-Right.

44
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:28,226
Now, let's resume.

45
00:04:28,309 --> 00:04:30,520
It did come off a bit harsh, but…

46
00:04:30,603 --> 00:04:31,437
That will be covered in tomorrow's class.

47
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,106
-See you then.
-Okay.

48
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:35,108
-All right.
-Excuse me, sir?

49
00:04:35,191 --> 00:04:36,567
If it isn't our model student.

50
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,945
I feel like you crossed a line
with me earlier.

51
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:41,114
-What do you mean?
-"Noryangjin Zombie"?

52
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:45,034
You belittled my 30-year existence
and my 5 years of exam prep.

53
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:46,452
It was all in good fun.

54
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:49,414
You may have made a joke for fun,
but the poor target may feel--

55
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:51,332
All right, I hear you.

56
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,710
Let me give you this, then. Here.

57
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:56,713
This is just unbelievable.

58
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:57,672
What?

59
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,716
Did you think this would make me go…

60
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,760
Thank you so much.
My sincerest thanks, sir.

61
00:05:04,095 --> 00:05:05,638
-Are we good now?
-Of course.

62
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,725
Zombie, goblin, vampire.
Call me whatever you wish.

63
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,601
-See you tomorrow.
-Take care.

64
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,561
All right, bye.

65
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,397
Oh, hey.

66
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,442
How can you be so unfazed
after hearing all that?

67
00:05:17,525 --> 00:05:20,486
Who cares? Being called a zombie
got me a free month of lectures.

68
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:21,821
Do you even know

69
00:05:21,904 --> 00:05:24,240
how many days I have to work here
to earn the equivalent?

70
00:05:24,324 --> 00:05:27,160
Is this what my thirties will be like?

71
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:29,245
That's more reason for you
to pass that test as soon as possible.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,040
If you continue living like this
well over your thirties,

73
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,042
your very existence
becomes a nuisance to others.

74
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,043
Just dead weight.

75
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:37,837
But at least you do well
on the written exams.

76
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,255
You just need to do well
on the interviews…

77
00:05:40,757 --> 00:05:42,133
Da-rim.

78
00:05:42,216 --> 00:05:43,718
You're usually so well-spoken,

79
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,470
so why do you keep failing interviews?

80
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,265
I know, right?

81
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,705
Five years ago,

82
00:06:13,831 --> 00:06:15,875
I was defeated in the war for employment

83
00:06:16,876 --> 00:06:18,503
and fled to Noryangjin.

84
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:22,006
I decided to flee from the biting remarks

85
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:25,009
and the judgmental gaze of others

86
00:06:25,968 --> 00:06:28,429
to hide behind
the "civil-service examinee" identity.

87
00:06:29,013 --> 00:06:29,847
However,

88
00:06:30,848 --> 00:06:33,226
after repeatedly failing
the civil service exam,

89
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:36,395
I have nowhere to hide anymore.

90
00:06:37,105 --> 00:06:39,273
How much longer can I keep this up?

91
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:44,487
Until when will I live like a zombie,
neither alive nor dead?

92
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,323
How much longer can I go on?

93
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,968
Mom, Da-jeong.

94
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,678
Can you take a look at my new clothes?

95
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,720
Clothes?

96
00:07:10,596 --> 00:07:12,306
You bought clothes?

97
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:16,811
It's not like I can wear sweats
to her wedding.

98
00:07:17,979 --> 00:07:18,896
Take a look.

99
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,275
-Hold on, Da-rim.
-What?

100
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:28,197
-This is for you.
-What's this?

101
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,493
A ticket to Jeju Island?

102
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:34,162
And a hotel voucher?

103
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:37,248
Go Da-jeong.

104
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:39,417
I guess you felt bad about getting married

105
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,169
before your older sister.

106
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:44,797
Let's see here.

107
00:07:44,881 --> 00:07:49,135
I see. I'll be gone for 4 days
from the 6th to the 9th.

108
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,224
Wait, but your wedding is on the 8th.

109
00:07:55,308 --> 00:07:56,767
The thing is…

110
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:59,770
My in-laws believe

111
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:02,732
that you're working in the US.

112
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:04,901
Who knows who will show up that day

113
00:08:04,984 --> 00:08:08,571
and ask you random questions
that might expose that lie?

114
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,406
It just sort of happened, you know.

115
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:13,034
Yeah, I wonder why I did that.

116
00:08:16,287 --> 00:08:17,413
I'm sorry.

117
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,540
Yeah, why did you even lie?

118
00:08:19,624 --> 00:08:21,417
She's your one and only sister.

119
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:25,046
How can you possibly tell her
not to come to your wedding?

120
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:26,047
Look up there.

121
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:28,090
Don't you see
our family motto hanging proudly?

122
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,801
Your dad must be
turning in his grave right now.

123
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,678
What am I supposed to do then?

124
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,806
My fiancé graduated from a top-tier school
and works at a major corporation,

125
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,225
while I went to a regional university
and work at a small company.

126
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:38,935
My mother-in-law doesn't approve of me.

127
00:08:41,437 --> 00:08:43,814
I'm drowning as it is,
and you want me to add on?

128
00:08:43,898 --> 00:08:47,276
"Mother, you see,
my older sister is actually unemployed."

129
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,488
How could I say that?

130
00:08:51,572 --> 00:08:55,284
I'm just telling you
how upset I am about the situation.

131
00:08:58,162 --> 00:08:59,372
Amazing.

132
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:01,415
Daiabeach Hotel.

133
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:03,960
Don't they throw pool parties
at night and stuff?

134
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,963
Thank you, dear sister.

135
00:09:07,046 --> 00:09:08,923
I get to experience such luxury
thanks to you.

136
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,216
You're going?

137
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,177
Let's be real. It's a celebration for her,
but just torture for me.

138
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,846
See? She likes the idea too.

139
00:09:15,930 --> 00:09:19,308
But don't tell me
this is all you're going to cover.

140
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,686
Food, transportation,
and travel expenses. Deal?

141
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:23,229
-Deal.
-Excellent.

142
00:09:23,312 --> 00:09:24,897
See you later.

143
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,148
Awesome!

144
00:09:29,527 --> 00:09:30,528
Seriously?

145
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:34,699
Let us go

146
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,534
Just the two of us

147
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:41,497
And leave all of it behind

148
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:46,210
For the blue night of Jeju Island

149
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,422
Underneath the stars

150
00:09:49,505 --> 00:09:51,132
Don't you even feel bad for her?

151
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:54,302
She didn't even buy me a fridge
or a measly rice cooker for my wedding.

152
00:09:54,385 --> 00:09:57,513
This is the only way
she can actually help me right now.

153
00:09:57,597 --> 00:10:00,266
This all just upsets me.

154
00:10:00,349 --> 00:10:02,560
The only family we have is each other.

155
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,479
If you

156
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:10,568
Find yourself being lonely…

157
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:49,023
That's right. And one more thing.

158
00:10:49,106 --> 00:10:51,651
Ji-hyeok, I would like to buy you as well.

159
00:10:51,734 --> 00:10:52,568
How much?

160
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:53,736
Please leave me out of it.

161
00:10:54,528 --> 00:10:59,909
There are still plenty of startups here
with potential that require my attention.

162
00:11:28,145 --> 00:11:29,230
Five times!

163
00:11:34,902 --> 00:11:35,903
Thank you, ma'am.

164
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:41,492
That should be enough to expand
the production facilities immediately.

165
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:42,993
Thank you.

166
00:11:44,703 --> 00:11:45,830
Ten times.

167
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:48,749
No way.

168
00:11:55,339 --> 00:11:56,257
What…

169
00:11:58,676 --> 00:12:01,470
Could you repeat that, Mr. Hassan?

170
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:02,888
Ten times.

171
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:16,110
It's unbelievable how smoothly you pushed
this project through in just six months.

172
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,446
I'm quite impressed, Mr. Gong.

173
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:20,739
Will you allow me to set
one more condition?

174
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,159
Of course.

175
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,870
I'd appreciate you
recruiting Kim Jeong-gwon,

176
00:12:25,953 --> 00:12:28,706
who has proven to be
the most competent developer in Korea.

177
00:12:30,124 --> 00:12:31,333
Kim Jeong-gwon, huh?

178
00:12:33,294 --> 00:12:34,795
Most certainly.

179
00:12:34,879 --> 00:12:35,880
Thank you.

180
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:37,465
I appreciate it.

181
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,477
Ten times!

182
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:52,354
Ten times the asking price!

183
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,482
That's my bro!

184
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:57,568
I mean… Well done, Mr. Gong.

185
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:58,569
Thanks, Gyeong-min.

186
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:01,614
Good job.

187
00:13:03,449 --> 00:13:06,494
We'd better secure Kim Jeong-gwon
before Hassan changes his mind.

188
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,621
Wait, stop right there.

189
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,998
This calls for a celebratory drink,
don't you think?

190
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:27,014
-Want to hang?
-No.

191
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,057
Okay!

192
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:29,850
Want to hang?

193
00:13:29,934 --> 00:13:31,352
-No.
-Okay!

194
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,776
Want to hang?

195
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,778
-No, thanks.
-Okay!

196
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:45,449
Hello again.

197
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:48,118
Listen. Do you see that dude over there?

198
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,037
The tall man in the gray suit.

199
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,040
We came together. I'm not alone.

200
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,750
You two are just so beautiful.

201
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,460
If you're free,

202
00:13:56,544 --> 00:13:58,796
how about having a drink
with the two of…

203
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,466
Excuse me for a sec.

204
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,425
Hey!

205
00:14:04,051 --> 00:14:06,095
Must you act like this?

206
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,222
Why can't we have some fun
and drink together?

207
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:11,141
And who knows?
That could lead to dating and more.

208
00:14:11,225 --> 00:14:12,851
I can't be bothered. It's too tedious.

209
00:14:12,935 --> 00:14:14,728
I can't believe you.

210
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,522
How can you find love tedious?

211
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:22,570
Do you know what dies faster
than the head of your beer?

212
00:14:23,737 --> 00:14:25,865
Love. Got that?

213
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:30,202
That's because
you never go beyond the superficial.

214
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,996
It has to come from deep within.

215
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:35,791
You need to take your time
to give and take.

216
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,043
Vibe together, you know?

217
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:39,086
What vibe?

218
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:42,381
A fateful encounter
followed by instinctive attraction.

219
00:14:42,464 --> 00:14:44,091
Two souls become one,

220
00:14:44,174 --> 00:14:46,343
and they become entangled and explode.

221
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,179
I guess you can call it
a chemical reaction.

222
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,390
Chemistry, my ass.

223
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,808
Humans aren't like H2O.

224
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:56,145
Do you think we're like atoms dependent
on each other to create water?

225
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:00,316
Humans are independent life forms.

226
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,611
They're at peak perfection
when they live alone.

227
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,785
Be honest.

228
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:14,163
You've never experienced a kiss
that blew your mind, have you?

229
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:16,624
No, I haven't.

230
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,417
Then have you ever met someone
you couldn't bear to leave?

231
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:19,835
Someone you want to hold,

232
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:22,129
or who makes you go crazy
when you can't see them?

233
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:23,172
Not really.

234
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:25,090
See? I knew it.

235
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:28,177
You're like this
because you haven't met the one yet.

236
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,471
That's a crucial life experience.

237
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,556
You need to ditch this fantasy

238
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,017
of fateful encounters
and instinctive attraction.

239
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,644
You're way too old for that.

240
00:15:36,727 --> 00:15:38,270
-Let's drink.
-I didn't bring mine.

241
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:41,857
Okay!

242
00:15:58,207 --> 00:16:01,335
You come from a chaebol family,
yet you always show up empty-handed.

243
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:03,337
You also come from a chaebol family,

244
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,464
yet you don't offer your guest
a glass of water.

245
00:16:05,547 --> 00:16:07,967
Your hands work fine.
Go and get it yourself.

246
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:08,884
I didn't come empty-handed.

247
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:13,639
I have good news and even better news.

248
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:14,765
Which one do you want to hear first?

249
00:16:14,848 --> 00:16:15,891
Whichever.

250
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,309
Let's start with the good news.

251
00:16:18,268 --> 00:16:19,269
We're getting married.

252
00:16:21,897 --> 00:16:22,731
What?

253
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:26,026
I heard your father proposed it first.

254
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:27,778
They're working out the terms now.

255
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:34,410
You'd better make this clear
to Chairman Yu.

256
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:37,621
I have no desire to get married.

257
00:16:37,705 --> 00:16:39,957
But I do.

258
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,627
Ha-yeong, do you think marriage
is some sort of mating retreat?

259
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:45,087
You think you just pair up
when someone tells you to?

260
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,964
-At the very least…
-"At the very least"?

261
00:16:50,134 --> 00:16:51,802
We should be vibing at the very least.

262
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:54,430
How are you so sure we won't?

263
00:16:54,513 --> 00:16:55,973
Don't we need to

264
00:16:56,056 --> 00:16:58,183
at least kiss to know for sure?

265
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,436
I've always wanted to,

266
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,562
you know?

267
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:17,202
I've been wanting to say this

268
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:20,289
ever since you came in.

269
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,625
This shade of lipstick

270
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,793
doesn't suit you at all.

271
00:17:25,961 --> 00:17:28,380
Maybe try something lighter,
like a coral shade.

272
00:17:28,464 --> 00:17:32,551
As an art school grad, shouldn't you
at least know which colors complement you?

273
00:17:34,678 --> 00:17:37,014
We can confirm that next time.
Here's the even better news--

274
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,640
Stop that. You're scaring me.

275
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,894
I don't believe in
abstinence before marriage.

276
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:44,855
-Just letting you know.
-Leave. Go home. Get out of here now.

277
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:57,868
Hey.

278
00:17:57,951 --> 00:17:58,869
Hi.

279
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:01,205
-Are those side dishes?
-Yeah.

280
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:03,165
-For whom?
-Jun.

281
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:04,958
Come on up.

282
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,753
Really?

283
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:12,257
Da-jeong can't do that to you.
You were always there for her.

284
00:18:12,341 --> 00:18:13,884
That rotten brat.

285
00:18:13,967 --> 00:18:15,844
Who hasn't been to Jeju?

286
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,472
You've never been.

287
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:19,807
That's true.

288
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:20,933
Seriously?

289
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,268
But is Jeju nice?

290
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,062
I mean, yeah, it is.

291
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:27,314
Really? Have you been? When?

292
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:29,399
For my honeymoon.

293
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:32,903
-Sorry.
-It's fine. It was forever ago.

294
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:36,323
-Hey, son.
-Good morning.

295
00:18:36,406 --> 00:18:38,617
Jun, did you sleep well?

296
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,785
Come here. It's time for probiotics.

297
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:44,873
Jun! How are you so handsome
in the morning?

298
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:46,917
You're like an adorable little chick!

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,210
You smell like an old man.

300
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,753
Where are you going?

301
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,968
I used to be popular in my youth.

302
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,220
When? When you used to date
Kim Jeong-gwon?

303
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,973
The next time you mention that name again,

304
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,975
it'll be your funeral and mine.

305
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,477
Sorry.

306
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,980
You made the right call
breaking up with him.

307
00:19:08,063 --> 00:19:10,691
-He was so obnoxious.
-Of course it was.

308
00:19:11,817 --> 00:19:12,901
But…

309
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:17,197
what if he's the last guy
I kissed before I die?

310
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,824
What do I do then?

311
00:19:18,907 --> 00:19:22,035
How can you already be worried
about "lasts" at your age?

312
00:19:23,579 --> 00:19:27,541
Maybe you should pick up
a new boyfriend while you're in Jeju.

313
00:19:27,624 --> 00:19:29,293
Forget it.

314
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:31,420
No man would want an exiled woman.

315
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,256
I'm off. Thanks for this.

316
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,341
-Okay. Bye.
-I'll return this later.

317
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,384
Sure.

318
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,903
A guest lecture with Kim Jeong-gwon,
the best AI programmer in Korea.

319
00:20:02,242 --> 00:20:03,493
Kim Jeong-gwon?

320
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,204
A GUEST LECTURE WITH KIM JEONG-GWON,
THE BEST AI PROGRAMMER IN KOREA!

321
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:15,005
Babe, you know our first anniversary
is coming up, right?

322
00:20:15,088 --> 00:20:17,966
So I saved my wages and bought something.
Don't be too shocked.

323
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:21,053
Ta-da!

324
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:22,429
Tickets to Jeju Island.

325
00:20:22,512 --> 00:20:23,597
-Go Da-rim.
-Yeah?

326
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,307
Do you think you can afford
to celebrate anniversaries right now?

327
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:26,391
What?

328
00:20:26,475 --> 00:20:28,602
You quit the job hunt and failed the exam.

329
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:31,605
You're doing nothing but killing time.

330
00:20:32,147 --> 00:20:32,981
Jeong-gwon.

331
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,524
It's pitiful and frustrating.

332
00:20:34,608 --> 00:20:37,736
Being subtle didn't work,
so I'll just come out and say it.

333
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,946
Let's break up.

334
00:20:42,658 --> 00:20:43,909
Come on, don't do this.

335
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,079
You said you liked me.
No, you said you loved me.

336
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,581
Yeah, I did like you.

337
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,208
I liked how bright and cute you were.

338
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:54,253
But it turns out
I mistook hopeless as bright

339
00:20:54,336 --> 00:20:57,089
and immature as cute.

340
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,092
Just look at yourself right now.

341
00:21:00,175 --> 00:21:04,096
You look like
a limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

342
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:07,766
No man in this world wants to date
an over-blanched piece of spinach.

343
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,060
Jeong-gwon…

344
00:21:19,945 --> 00:21:21,780
Over-blanched piece of spinach? As if…

345
00:21:21,863 --> 00:21:23,240
Wait.

346
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,952
The fifth annual
Jeju AI Conference will be held.

347
00:21:27,035 --> 00:21:28,912
Why is he so successful anyway?

348
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,706
I prayed for 100 days straight
for him to fail.

349
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,671
Okay, Kim Jeong-gwon.

350
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:39,881
Sit tight.

351
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:42,050
I'm coming for you.

352
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,348
Where is he staying?

353
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:50,392
Daiabeach Hotel.

354
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:51,810
I booked a room for you there.

355
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:53,228
Okay. Good job.

356
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,273
I hear he's notorious
for being picky and guarded

357
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:58,400
and won't engage with anyone
he doesn't know.

358
00:21:58,483 --> 00:21:59,318
Really?

359
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:02,946
You said he graduated
from Haemun High, right?

360
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:05,449
I want a list of his teachers,

361
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:08,660
along with the school anthem, uniform,
and even the cafeteria bestsellers.

362
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,787
So you're going the alum route, huh?

363
00:22:11,455 --> 00:22:12,289
Okay.

364
00:22:12,372 --> 00:22:14,207
It'll be in your inbox by the evening.

365
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:17,294
You should enjoy Jeju until then.
I'm sure it's been a while.

366
00:22:17,377 --> 00:22:19,379
Okay. Keep up the good work.

367
00:22:19,463 --> 00:22:20,797
-Will do.
-Bye.

368
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,599
At least the weather is nice.

369
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:32,392
Damn it.

370
00:22:32,476 --> 00:22:35,353
I'll make sure I have an absolute blast,
if only out of spite.

371
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,590
How much is it?

372
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:04,925
It's 5,000 won.

373
00:23:05,592 --> 00:23:06,718
Thank you.

374
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,063
This way!

375
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:31,451
Enjoy.

376
00:23:31,535 --> 00:23:32,702
-Thank you.
-My goodness.

377
00:23:32,786 --> 00:23:33,954
-This looks so good.
-Dig in.

378
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,084
GIANT GRILLED HAIRTAIL SET
125,000 WON

379
00:23:39,167 --> 00:23:40,544
TWO-SERVING MINIMUM

380
00:23:48,301 --> 00:23:49,302
I'm starving.

381
00:23:49,845 --> 00:23:51,555
They say this will give me a son.

382
00:23:51,638 --> 00:23:53,390
She's going to wear that thing out.

383
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:57,978
Go Da-rim?

384
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,021
It is, isn't it?

385
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:02,566
The Psycho of Yeongpung Girls' High!

386
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,025
It's me, Lee Su-jin!

387
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,862
Lee Su-jin as in
the Yapper of Grade 12 Class 2?

388
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,655
-I can't believe it!
-Oh my gosh!

389
00:24:08,738 --> 00:24:10,740
It's been forever!

390
00:24:10,824 --> 00:24:13,451
It's already been over ten years.
This is unbelievable.

391
00:24:13,535 --> 00:24:16,454
Hey, you haven't changed one bit.

392
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,039
Are you here on vacation?

393
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,791
Yeah, I tagged along
on my boyfriend's work trip.

394
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,127
There you are.

395
00:24:22,210 --> 00:24:24,546
Come and say hi
to my high school friend, Go Da-rim.

396
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:26,965
Hello, it's nice…

397
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:39,019
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Kim Jeong-gwon.

398
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:42,439
You look like
a limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

399
00:24:47,736 --> 00:24:48,987
Right.

400
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:50,614
Hello.

401
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:52,449
Of course, you're shocked.

402
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,910
-Isn't he so dreamy?
-Oh, please.

403
00:24:54,993 --> 00:24:56,453
Yeah.

404
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:57,662
Are you here with your boyfriend too?

405
00:24:58,997 --> 00:24:59,915
Oh, did you come alone?

406
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:09,758
Don't be silly.
Of course, I'm here with my boyfriend.

407
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:13,553
I'm just alone today
because he's really busy.

408
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:15,055
That's great.

409
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,348
We were just about to eat.

410
00:25:16,431 --> 00:25:17,557
Join us.

411
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,809
-You're okay with that, right?
-Of course.

412
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,478
Join us.

413
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,151
I really want to, but unfortunately,
I have other plans.

414
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,903
Sorry. My boyfriend is calling.

415
00:25:29,986 --> 00:25:31,404
See you around. Enjoy your trip.

416
00:25:31,988 --> 00:25:34,866
Hey, babe. Of course, I'm having fun.

417
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:36,117
Yeah.

418
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,953
Okay, sure.

419
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,335
-That was delicious. Thank you.
-Thank you.

420
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:49,297
I should've never come to Jeju.

421
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:51,925
Why did I have to run into him,
of all people?

422
00:25:55,136 --> 00:25:56,638
MOM

423
00:25:58,473 --> 00:25:59,724
Hey, Mom.

424
00:25:59,808 --> 00:26:00,809
Did you eat?

425
00:26:00,892 --> 00:26:04,562
I was actually just enjoying
some grilled hairtail and mackerel.

426
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:07,565
The meat is just so succulent

427
00:26:07,649 --> 00:26:09,276
and incredibly rich and savory.

428
00:26:09,359 --> 00:26:11,152
It's unbelievably delicious.

429
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,070
Eat up.

430
00:26:12,654 --> 00:26:16,866
By the way, I got Da-jeong a rice cooker,
but told her that it was from you.

431
00:26:16,950 --> 00:26:18,118
Why did you do that?

432
00:26:18,201 --> 00:26:20,245
Hey, we're in the middle of a rush.

433
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:21,246
I'm hanging up now.

434
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:23,164
Just be aware of that.

435
00:26:23,248 --> 00:26:24,749
I have to go now.

436
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:25,834
Wait, Mom.

437
00:26:56,906 --> 00:26:57,824
This is a real school?

438
00:26:57,907 --> 00:27:00,618
-I've never heard of it.
-Me neither.

439
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:03,621
But still, I received a scholarship
for all four years.

440
00:27:03,705 --> 00:27:05,749
A crappy school only churns out
more crappy results.

441
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,751
Right.

442
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:09,669
We called you in
because you looked pretty in your photo,

443
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,212
but you could use some upkeep.

444
00:27:12,172 --> 00:27:13,089
No father around.

445
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:15,800
Kids like her
who grow up in unstable homes

446
00:27:15,884 --> 00:27:17,469
always end up getting into trouble.

447
00:27:18,428 --> 00:27:20,555
You could use some upkeep.

448
00:27:21,056 --> 00:27:23,099
Unstable homes…

449
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:26,186
Crappy results…

450
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,437
Right?

451
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,439
GONGJEONG BANK OF KOREA
INTERVIEW FOR NEW HIRES

452
00:27:44,704 --> 00:27:45,663
Dad.

453
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,541
Dad!

454
00:27:49,417 --> 00:27:50,668
Dad…

455
00:28:04,849 --> 00:28:05,809
Life is simple.

456
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,478
You just have to go for it.

457
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,897
Just go for it.

458
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,818
Let's go!

459
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:17,070
Let's go.

460
00:28:18,613 --> 00:28:19,906
No…

461
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:23,868
Let's go!

462
00:28:26,287 --> 00:28:28,373
Yes! Gong Ji-hyeok, hell yeah!

463
00:28:32,377 --> 00:28:33,586
No, you can't!

464
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,797
Life may be tough,
but this isn't the answer.

465
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,799
What the heck? Who are you?

466
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:38,800
Let go of me!

467
00:28:38,883 --> 00:28:40,885
I know all too well how you feel.

468
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,763
The rest of us aren't sticking around
because life is always sunny.

469
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,141
You just have to hang in there
when it comes to life.

470
00:28:46,224 --> 00:28:48,935
You have to hang in there.
Just hang in there!

471
00:28:49,018 --> 00:28:50,478
Hang in where? Are you drunk?

472
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,856
You've clearly lost your mind. Damn it!

473
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,737
Yeah, I lost my mind.

474
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,822
That's not all.

475
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,992
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad!

476
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:05,243
So what?

477
00:29:05,326 --> 00:29:08,705
Even someone like me is hanging in there.
So why would you try to die? Why?

478
00:29:08,788 --> 00:29:10,957
Why would you die? Why?

479
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,000
You can't die!

480
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:13,168
Who's trying to die here?

481
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:14,169
Let go of me already!

482
00:29:50,914 --> 00:29:52,749
That's going to take
about a week or two to heal.

483
00:29:52,832 --> 00:29:55,627
You must disinfect the wound
every two days.

484
00:29:58,713 --> 00:29:59,714
What a hassle.

485
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,719
And as for Ms. Go Da-rim,

486
00:30:04,803 --> 00:30:08,097
we ran some tests on her
and didn't find anything,

487
00:30:08,181 --> 00:30:09,182
so you don't need to worry.

488
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:11,643
But why isn't she waking up?

489
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:13,686
We have a lot to discuss.

490
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:17,273
It appears she's sleeping off
some alcohol.

491
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,401
She's sleeping it off?

492
00:30:24,948 --> 00:30:27,200
She's definitely insane.

493
00:30:27,283 --> 00:30:29,285
What's wrong with you?

494
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:33,164
Someone so handsome can't die!

495
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:37,335
That would be a detrimental loss
for the nation…

496
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:40,588
Do you get that?

497
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:42,090
I'm going to head out.

498
00:30:42,674 --> 00:30:43,842
She'll take care of the bill.

499
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,066
I mean, I am quite handsome.

500
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:04,612
Her mind is damaged,
but I guess her vision is fine.

501
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:09,325
-Hey, got updates?
-Yes.

502
00:31:09,409 --> 00:31:11,619
I confirmed that Kim Jeong-gwon
checked in.

503
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,537
Okay.

504
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:15,373
Then I'll discreetly try approaching him
at breakfast tomorrow.

505
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,291
Also,

506
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:19,752
I've sent you the school anthem as well,
so make sure to take a look.

507
00:31:19,836 --> 00:31:22,213
-Great. Thank you, Gyeong-min.
-Okay.

508
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,423
Okay.

509
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:32,307
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye's blue vigor

510
00:31:33,474 --> 00:31:36,811
The proud Haemun grads

511
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:40,148
Spread across the world

512
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,441
Okay, let's go!

513
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:43,234
Did you say 270,000 won?

514
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:45,069
That's for both of you.

515
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:49,741
That includes the tests and treatment
received by the man you came with.

516
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:51,576
Why would I pay for his treatment?

517
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:52,952
Were you two not together?

518
00:31:53,036 --> 00:31:56,247
He said you would take care of both bills.

519
00:31:56,331 --> 00:31:58,374
How does this make any sense?

520
00:31:58,458 --> 00:31:59,834
This is so unfair.

521
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:01,461
I was the one who saved his life.

522
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,712
Will it be credit?

523
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,714
Sorry. Just a moment.

524
00:32:05,298 --> 00:32:06,591
This is insane.

525
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:07,884
Hold on.

526
00:32:09,719 --> 00:32:11,179
Ten, twenty…

527
00:32:18,353 --> 00:32:19,479
But…

528
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:29,614
How can I survive
two more days on 10,000 won?

529
00:32:34,410 --> 00:32:35,912
OUTPATIENT MEDICAL BILL AND RECEIPT
PATIENT NAME: GONG JI-HYEOK

530
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:41,459
I saved a man's life,

531
00:32:41,542 --> 00:32:44,003
but he robbed me blind.

532
00:32:44,754 --> 00:32:45,880
A highway robbery.

533
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:51,970
I was saving every penny
to buy gifts for Da-jeong and Mom.

534
00:32:55,223 --> 00:32:57,934
It's going to take me forever
to walk to the hotel.

535
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:00,770
-Oh gosh.
-Do you need a ride?

536
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,021
Where are you headed?

537
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:06,567
By chance, can you just drive me
3,000 won's worth?

538
00:33:06,651 --> 00:33:08,569
You must be bonkers.

539
00:33:13,157 --> 00:33:15,743
Yeah. I must be bonkers.

540
00:33:27,380 --> 00:33:28,506
I'm here.

541
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,716
I'm finally here.

542
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,012
That damn highway robber.
You're dead meat if I ever catch you.

543
00:33:34,595 --> 00:33:36,389
I'll…

544
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,850
I'll teach you a lesson
you'll never forget.

545
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:59,078
Breakfast. It's hotel breakfast time.

546
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,111
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye's blue vigor…

547
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,281
Hotel breakfast…

548
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,455
-You got this.
-Let's go.

549
00:34:45,458 --> 00:34:46,542
This looks so good.

550
00:34:47,543 --> 00:34:49,462
Right by the garden

551
00:34:49,545 --> 00:34:51,214
with an amazing ocean view.

552
00:34:51,923 --> 00:34:53,466
I have to send this to Mom later.

553
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,599
The spirit of Mt. Cheonggye…

554
00:35:07,897 --> 00:35:08,815
-Hey.
-Ji-hyeok!

555
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:10,066
You haven't met Kim Jeong-gwon yet, right?

556
00:35:10,149 --> 00:35:11,484
No. Still waiting for him.

557
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:12,610
Thank goodness.

558
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,988
It seems the Haemun High tactic
is out of the question.

559
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:17,740
I looked into it some more,

560
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:19,742
and it looks like he was bullied
during high school.

561
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,577
He apparently despises talking about it.

562
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,412
Really? Glad you found that out.

563
00:35:23,496 --> 00:35:24,497
What do we do now?

564
00:35:25,373 --> 00:35:26,666
Let's try college years.

565
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:29,627
See what his rep was back then,
and let me know as soon as possible.

566
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,212
-You got it.
-Okay.

567
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,679
Stop eating already.

568
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:40,847
Here, honey.

569
00:35:40,930 --> 00:35:41,973
Have you lost your mind?

570
00:35:46,769 --> 00:35:47,979
Unbelievable.

571
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:52,775
Come on, honey!

572
00:36:15,798 --> 00:36:18,593
You know, there's not much to life.

573
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,179
Even when you feel like
you're going to die,

574
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,972
you grow hungry around mealtime.

575
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:27,351
And seeing a lavish hotel spread
cheers you right up. Don't you agree?

576
00:36:27,935 --> 00:36:28,853
Ms. Go Da-rim?

577
00:36:30,229 --> 00:36:32,231
What are you even doing here?

578
00:36:32,315 --> 00:36:34,108
Isn't it obvious? I'm a guest here.

579
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,068
Hold on.

580
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:37,862
How do you know my name?

581
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,531
I checked your ID
for the hospital paperwork yesterday.

582
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:46,621
So you searched through my bag
and saw the envelope of cash.

583
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,249
But still, there are lines
that one shouldn't cross.

584
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:53,502
If not for me, you wouldn't have even seen
today's breakfast menu!

585
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,183
I'm sorry,

586
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:09,560
but I'm a little busy right now,
so let's finish this later.

587
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,899
-Says who?
-Wait.

588
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:19,153
Anyway, I'm sure you had your reasons
for resorting to such drastic measures.

589
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:21,239
So just give me back my money,
and I won't report you.

590
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,157
You see, I have quite a warm heart.

591
00:37:23,241 --> 00:37:25,576
I'm a bit busy right now.
Let's finish this later, okay?

592
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,411
Are you kidding me right now?

593
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,414
My heart may be warm,
but my temper is fiery.

594
00:37:30,498 --> 00:37:31,958
Do you want to see it?

595
00:37:32,041 --> 00:37:33,042
Da-rim!

596
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,678
I can't believe it!

597
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,888
You're staying here too?

598
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,770
Is he your boyfriend?

599
00:37:56,899 --> 00:37:58,985
Yeah. Let me introduce him.

600
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:01,070
This is my boyfriend.

601
00:38:02,738 --> 00:38:05,741
Hello, I'm Da-rim's friend
from high school.

602
00:38:05,825 --> 00:38:07,535
My goodness, you're very handsome.

603
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:11,831
If you haven't eaten yet,
how about we eat together?

604
00:38:11,914 --> 00:38:12,999
Are you okay with that?

605
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:14,917
Sure. Why not?

606
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,340
I can't believe this just fell in my lap.

607
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,468
We'd absolutely love to,

608
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:26,637
but we actually just ate.

609
00:38:26,721 --> 00:38:28,848
Come on, babe.
I'm nowhere near done eating.

610
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,766
Let's just eat a little bit more.

611
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:33,227
I'm still hungry!

612
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:35,313
Okay?

613
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,662
I'm Da-rim's friend, Lee Su-jin.

614
00:38:51,746 --> 00:38:54,290
And this is my boyfriend, Kim Jeong-gwon.

615
00:38:54,999 --> 00:38:56,625
We both work in IT.

616
00:38:56,709 --> 00:38:58,169
It's nice to meet you.

617
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:01,797
Da-rim, you should introduce
your boyfriend to us as well.

618
00:39:01,881 --> 00:39:03,632
Right, well…

619
00:39:04,216 --> 00:39:06,510
His name is…

620
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:12,892
Gong Ji-hyeok.

621
00:39:14,477 --> 00:39:16,103
I work in management consulting.

622
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,023
I discover startups with potential

623
00:39:19,106 --> 00:39:20,900
and connect them with investors.

624
00:39:20,983 --> 00:39:22,818
So, like a broker?

625
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,864
More like a fairy godfather.

626
00:39:27,656 --> 00:39:29,533
A fairy godfather who dolls up
a dusty Cinderella

627
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:32,828
to set her up with Prince Charming.

628
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:34,538
"Fairy godfather"?

629
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:36,540
But you know,

630
00:39:37,124 --> 00:39:39,168
I discovered fairies do really exist.

631
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,504
Right here!

632
00:39:44,298 --> 00:39:46,425
You're such a romantic, Ji-hyeok.

633
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,387
But how did you hurt your hand?

634
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,430
Oh, this?

635
00:39:52,848 --> 00:39:55,393
My Da-rim kept pouncing on me yesterday.

636
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,646
She just grabbed me from the back,

637
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:01,023
and we ended up
rolling around on the ground…

638
00:40:05,194 --> 00:40:06,821
That's how I ended up like this.

639
00:40:08,531 --> 00:40:10,616
Look at you. You're still so aggressive.

640
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:12,034
Gosh.

641
00:40:12,618 --> 00:40:15,579
Even when she was younger,
she used to be crazy about boys.

642
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,416
Hey, you should eat. This is delicious.

643
00:40:24,713 --> 00:40:26,006
If you're free tonight,

644
00:40:26,966 --> 00:40:28,676
I'd love to invite you to a party.

645
00:40:30,136 --> 00:40:33,055
I happen to have two extra invites.

646
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:34,181
"Party"?

647
00:40:35,349 --> 00:40:36,350
Yeah.

648
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:38,686
We agreed to go earlier.

649
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,023
That sounds great.

650
00:40:43,107 --> 00:40:44,316
Good thing I packed a dress.

651
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,526
We should go.

652
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,027
Sure. Why not?

653
00:40:47,111 --> 00:40:48,320
-Yes!
-Thank you for the invite.

654
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:54,410
-Eat up.
-Okay.

655
00:41:01,792 --> 00:41:03,127
Are you in separate rooms?

656
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:05,087
Oh, right. What now?

657
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,714
Babe.

658
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:08,674
The fifth floor

659
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:10,885
is my apartment floor.

660
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:12,720
Don't be so obvious.

661
00:41:12,803 --> 00:41:14,597
Oh, right.

662
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,891
What floor are you guys on?

663
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,476
Seventh as well.

664
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,060
Who knew we were on the same floor?

665
00:41:20,769 --> 00:41:23,022
Damn it.
Why did it have to be the same floor?

666
00:41:34,950 --> 00:41:35,993
Go inside.

667
00:41:36,535 --> 00:41:37,870
Please go inside first.

668
00:41:40,706 --> 00:41:41,874
Go.

669
00:41:41,957 --> 00:41:43,459
Please go inside first.

670
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:48,631
This is our room. Please excuse us.

671
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,178
We'll see you at the party later.

672
00:41:54,803 --> 00:41:56,013
Sure.

673
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,014
See you later, Da-rim.

674
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:58,098
See you.

675
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:00,142
Let's go.

676
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:12,071
What do you think you're doing?

677
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:13,197
Are you nuts?

678
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,323
You started it.

679
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:17,826
"Oh, he's my boyfriend."

680
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,414
I'm sorry about that. It was an emergency.

681
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:24,875
Emergency?

682
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:28,546
Kim Jeong-gwon is your ex, isn't he?

683
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:29,505
How did you know that?

684
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,218
He is.

685
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,220
And it was a nasty breakup.

686
00:42:36,303 --> 00:42:38,222
So forget about this party.

687
00:42:38,305 --> 00:42:40,766
I refuse to go,
so take care of the mess you made.

688
00:42:51,402 --> 00:42:52,736
What are you doing?

689
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:54,280
Step back.

690
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:05,082
I got injured because of you.

691
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:06,917
And it hurt a lot.

692
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:11,422
How did a crybaby like you
ever consider suicide--

693
00:43:11,505 --> 00:43:13,465
To start, I never had
any suicidal intentions.

694
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:16,677
You were drunk
and decided to knock me over on your own.

695
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,636
If it weren't for me…

696
00:43:19,763 --> 00:43:21,765
your head would've ended up like this.
Got that?

697
00:43:22,391 --> 00:43:23,767
That can't be true.

698
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:27,021
I definitely saw you ready to jump.

699
00:43:27,104 --> 00:43:30,190
Would a suicidal man jump through
these hoops to scout Kim Jeong-gwon?

700
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:33,819
You're trying to scout him?

701
00:43:35,529 --> 00:43:37,364
I need him for my business.

702
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:42,161
That's why I followed him to Jeju.

703
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,247
KIM JEONG-GWON'S CONNECTIONS

704
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:47,666
Tonight's party is a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity for me.

705
00:43:47,750 --> 00:43:48,709
So,

706
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,629
just be my girlfriend for the day.

707
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:55,257
Don't forget you used me earlier too.

708
00:44:01,555 --> 00:44:02,931
The money you asked for earlier…

709
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:05,225
I'll triple it.

710
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,603
Excuse me?

711
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:11,357
Forget it. I'm not doing it.

712
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:12,650
Ten times.

713
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:13,651
Ten times?

714
00:44:17,071 --> 00:44:20,574
She didn't even buy me a fridge
or a measly rice cooker for my wedding.

715
00:44:23,869 --> 00:44:25,371
In full cash, right?

716
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,914
Half up front. Deal?

717
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,208
Deal.

718
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:30,834
Okay.

719
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,416
DESERT ROSE
7,500,000 WON

720
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:13,627
This dress is part of
the recent SS collection,

721
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:16,046
and it features a ball gown silhouette.

722
00:45:17,631 --> 00:45:18,966
What in the world…

723
00:45:20,217 --> 00:45:22,261
-Let's keep this one.
-Yes, sir.

724
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,394
Let's get out of here.
This place isn't it.

725
00:45:30,477 --> 00:45:31,979
Why? Not your style?

726
00:45:32,062 --> 00:45:33,063
Well…

727
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:35,149
Let's just go.

728
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,900
Thank you for your time.

729
00:45:36,984 --> 00:45:38,318
Thank you. We'll be back later.

730
00:45:38,402 --> 00:45:40,737
-Why? It's a nice brand.
-Come on, go.

731
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,448
-Hold on. Wait.
-Quiet. Just go.

732
00:45:42,531 --> 00:45:43,740
Thank you.

733
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:45,451
What's wrong?

734
00:45:46,493 --> 00:45:47,453
Huh?

735
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,913
That place was way too expensive.

736
00:45:49,997 --> 00:45:52,332
Why spend so much
on a dress for just one night?

737
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,834
It's so wasteful.

738
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:55,210
No, it's an investment.

739
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:57,880
Should my girlfriend
show up to such a party…

740
00:45:59,673 --> 00:46:00,549
What?

741
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:04,261
In such dingy clothes?

742
00:46:06,388 --> 00:46:07,598
What did you just say?

743
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,558
"Dingy"?

744
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:13,645
A limp piece of over-blanched spinach.

745
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,189
Did you call me dingy?

746
00:46:16,523 --> 00:46:18,317
You need to watch what you say.

747
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:20,027
How could you say that to someone?

748
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:22,196
That's nothing to be this angry about.

749
00:46:22,279 --> 00:46:23,822
It certainly is!

750
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:24,907
Apologize.

751
00:46:25,574 --> 00:46:26,783
Or I refuse to work with you.

752
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:34,708
My goodness!

753
00:46:38,378 --> 00:46:39,671
Oh no!

754
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:41,215
Are you okay?

755
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:43,133
It's dangerous.
You should wait over there.

756
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,302
Sorry. It'll just be a second.

757
00:46:46,011 --> 00:46:48,096
Sorry. It won't take long.

758
00:46:48,180 --> 00:46:49,348
Just a second.

759
00:46:49,431 --> 00:46:50,682
Come on!

760
00:46:51,433 --> 00:46:52,476
Hurry!

761
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,438
Sorry.

762
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:59,608
Listen, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

763
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,860
Even in an employer-employee relationship,

764
00:47:01,944 --> 00:47:05,614
you must observe
basic human decency and etiquette.

765
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:07,574
My thoughts exactly.

766
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,825
That's exactly what I want.

767
00:47:08,909 --> 00:47:11,703
Appropriate attire for the occasion
would be basic etiquette.

768
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,622
Then you should've worded it as such.

769
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:16,250
Instead, you insulted me,
calling me dingy and whatnot.

770
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,418
Why resort to demeaning comments?

771
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,419
Grab that.

772
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:22,756
I'm just saying, we should showcase you
in the light of success and refinement.

773
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,716
-Grab that as well.
-Okay.

774
00:47:26,552 --> 00:47:29,012
That would enhance
the credibility of my proposal, no?

775
00:47:29,096 --> 00:47:29,930
Take these.

776
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:32,099
-Is that it?
-That's all of them.

777
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:33,392
Stay here.

778
00:47:35,269 --> 00:47:36,228
What just happened?

779
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,271
Are you okay?

780
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:39,022
You must've been so surprised.

781
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,233
Mischievous tangerines.

782
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:42,859
-Yes, they are.
-Thank you so much.

783
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:44,486
-No worries.
-Thank you.

784
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,029
-Take these.
-Thank you.

785
00:47:46,113 --> 00:47:47,155
Thank you so much.

786
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:48,782
-No worries. Thank you.
-Thank you.

787
00:47:48,865 --> 00:47:50,450
Thank you.

788
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:52,327
-Be careful. Bye.
-Bye.

789
00:47:52,411 --> 00:47:53,412
High five!

790
00:48:08,635 --> 00:48:11,972
So, are you going to apologize or not?

791
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:13,890
What?

792
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,685
Right.

793
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:19,646
I'll apologize.

794
00:48:23,066 --> 00:48:24,526
I don't want the person I love

795
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:28,196
to feel even slightly pitiful
in front of her ex.

796
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:31,491
Tonight,

797
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:35,037
I want you to be the most beautiful.

798
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,749
It seems that my greed

799
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:41,043
led me to make such a rude comment.

800
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:43,837
I'm sorry.

801
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:48,884
Then, let's go.

802
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,053
We can invest or whatever.

803
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:11,073
Thank you, sir.

804
00:49:12,949 --> 00:49:15,702
Are we not even going to try it on first?

805
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:18,413
It'll suit you. I have a discerning eye.

806
00:49:18,497 --> 00:49:20,582
But we should still see if it fits.

807
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:22,084
It'll fit.

808
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,341
Thanks to rolling around yesterday,
I figured out your size.

809
00:49:42,270 --> 00:49:44,022
Mr. Gong! We need to--

810
00:49:44,106 --> 00:49:45,315
Please look forward.

811
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:48,151
How about this? It's the latest trend.

812
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:50,529
-I think this will suit her better.
-We need to talk.

813
00:49:50,612 --> 00:49:52,155
What are you two talking about?

814
00:49:52,239 --> 00:49:53,365
Curls…

815
00:49:54,574 --> 00:49:56,159
Let's go with these bangs.

816
00:49:56,243 --> 00:49:58,954
Mr. Gong, so what am I doing here?

817
00:50:02,165 --> 00:50:02,999
Okay.

818
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,087
Where are you going?

819
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:08,672
At least tell me what's going on.

820
00:50:08,755 --> 00:50:10,132
Wait. What?

821
00:50:10,215 --> 00:50:12,801
-We'll get started now.
-Start what?

822
00:50:12,884 --> 00:50:14,344
Hold on. Wait.

823
00:50:14,928 --> 00:50:16,304
Hang on.

824
00:50:16,388 --> 00:50:17,848
Wait, miss.

825
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:19,599
No, you can't do that.

826
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:21,453
I look awkward, don't I?

827
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:24,581
A real-life fairy masterpiece.

828
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,460
A fairy? I mean… You think so?

829
00:51:28,543 --> 00:51:30,003
Not you. Me.

830
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,005
-What?
-I'm the fairy godfather.

831
00:51:32,088 --> 00:51:33,215
What?

832
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:37,844
A result like this would give
Cinderella a run for her money, no?

833
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,889
-Bibbidi-Bobbidi…
-Boo?

834
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:42,641
Okay.

835
00:51:42,724 --> 00:51:44,017
Jeez.

836
00:51:46,978 --> 00:51:48,855
Kim Jeong-gwon will be filled with regret.

837
00:51:49,481 --> 00:51:51,525
Would that help your cause?

838
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:56,446
Envy or whatever may come,
if it makes him take an interest in me…

839
00:51:58,990 --> 00:51:59,825
it'll be helpful.

840
00:52:01,576 --> 00:52:02,869
Give me your hand.

841
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:07,058
"Gong Ji-hyeok, born in 1994.
30 years old."

842
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,853
"CEO of JH Consulting."

843
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,607
"Met at a friend's wedding
on September 14, 2024."

844
00:53:13,690 --> 00:53:15,984
"Love at first sight.
Dating for six months."

845
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:20,238
"Date nights are usually spent
watching movies at home."

846
00:53:20,322 --> 00:53:21,531
"The most recent film was…"

847
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:57,859
Are you ready?

848
00:53:58,777 --> 00:54:00,320
Hold on.

849
00:54:06,618 --> 00:54:07,994
I think I am.

850
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:38,066
We've been dating for six months.

851
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:40,485
Fell in love at first sight
at a friend's wedding.

852
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:43,029
Date nights are usually spent
watching movies at home.

853
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:44,155
The most recent film was…

854
00:54:44,948 --> 00:54:46,074
-Notting Hill.
-Notting Hill.

855
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:49,703
-And planning to get married next spring.
-Right.

856
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,423
-Who was that?
-No clue.

857
00:55:08,179 --> 00:55:09,389
Da-rim, over here.

858
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:19,232
Da-rim, you look so pretty.

859
00:55:21,151 --> 00:55:22,193
Look at that ring.

860
00:55:22,277 --> 00:55:23,611
Did he propose?

861
00:55:23,695 --> 00:55:25,989
Oh, this?

862
00:55:27,073 --> 00:55:29,200
We're thinking next spring.

863
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:33,455
I wanted to get married sooner,

864
00:55:33,538 --> 00:55:34,664
but my Da-rim

865
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,250
wanted a spring wedding.

866
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,127
Congratulations.

867
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,129
Jeong-gwon, isn't my friend so pretty?

868
00:55:41,713 --> 00:55:44,257
Yeah. You look beautiful.

869
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:45,675
"Beautiful"? Oh, please.

870
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:48,470
I'd say I'm a piece of
over-blanched spinach at best.

871
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:51,264
"Over-blanched spinach"?
What kind of lunatic said that to you?

872
00:55:51,347 --> 00:55:52,432
I know, right?

873
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,392
But someone did.

874
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:55,894
A real lunatic.

875
00:55:56,936 --> 00:55:58,646
He failed to see intrinsic value.

876
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:02,108
Thanks to people like him,
value investors like me

877
00:56:03,193 --> 00:56:04,110
get to reap the profits.

878
00:56:04,694 --> 00:56:06,529
Da-rim was a diamond in the rough.

879
00:56:06,613 --> 00:56:08,656
It's just that she doesn't care
about getting dressed up.

880
00:56:10,867 --> 00:56:12,494
But just a little attention…

881
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:17,040
allows her to shine like this.

882
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,881
Are you enjoying the party?

883
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:26,216
It's all right.

884
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:29,135
It seems more business-oriented.

885
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:32,055
That's why the guest list is so exclusive.

886
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,264
So, what about you?

887
00:56:34,015 --> 00:56:36,226
Are you happy with your current company?

888
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,604
I've been consulting
with this IT company recently,

889
00:56:40,188 --> 00:56:42,398
and their planning
and sales capabilities are top-notch,

890
00:56:42,482 --> 00:56:44,776
but their development capabilities
fall a bit short.

891
00:56:44,859 --> 00:56:46,903
-Is that so?
-Yes.

892
00:56:46,986 --> 00:56:49,072
We're going to grab a bite to eat.

893
00:56:53,910 --> 00:56:56,538
Babe, about that company,

894
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,249
what was its enterprise value again?

895
00:57:03,753 --> 00:57:05,088
It's not much now.

896
00:57:06,506 --> 00:57:08,174
Around two or three hundred billion won?

897
00:57:09,175 --> 00:57:11,928
If I could get a developer
like Jeong-gwon on board,

898
00:57:12,011 --> 00:57:13,596
I could turn it into a unicorn
in six months.

899
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:15,390
-Such a shame, huh?
-Yeah.

900
00:57:16,891 --> 00:57:19,102
Unicorn? As in one trillion won?

901
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:22,063
A company's EV could rise that much
just because of one developer?

902
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:25,066
Excuse me.

903
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:26,818
Thank you.

904
00:57:29,863 --> 00:57:31,322
Nitric acid and sulfuric acid

905
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:34,200
are dangerous substances in themselves,

906
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:35,785
but when they're combined…

907
00:57:38,204 --> 00:57:39,998
they become a potent explosive.

908
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,041
Nitroglycerin.

909
00:57:42,584 --> 00:57:43,543
Also known as…

910
00:57:44,752 --> 00:57:46,045
dynamite.

911
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:49,257
A chemical reaction.

912
00:57:52,385 --> 00:57:55,388
There's an art to combining people
and companies as well.

913
00:57:56,014 --> 00:57:57,182
And when it comes to

914
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,517
discovering such combinations,

915
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:01,936
I'm a pro.

916
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:04,189
What do you think?

917
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,607
Dynamite.

918
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:07,150
Would you be interested?

919
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,671
No.

920
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,011
You're doing fine. Yeah.

921
00:58:35,094 --> 00:58:36,137
Don't get scared.

922
00:58:36,930 --> 00:58:37,931
You got this!

923
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,649
Are you serious right now?

924
00:58:50,693 --> 00:58:51,569
What do you mean?

925
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,323
There's been a surge

926
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:59,911
of punks approaching me lately, using
my schooling, hometown, and relatives.

927
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:04,123
But this is the first time
one has used an ex-girlfriend.

928
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:06,084
I must admit it's innovative.

929
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:11,464
I guess a taste of success
has left you blinded by your inflated ego.

930
00:59:11,548 --> 00:59:13,883
You believe the world
is at your feet, don't you?

931
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,553
You really need to pull yourself together.

932
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:20,139
Ji-hyeok and I
are in a committed relationship.

933
00:59:21,182 --> 00:59:22,976
As if I don't know you.

934
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,479
There's no love in your eyes
when you look at him.

935
00:59:27,730 --> 00:59:29,774
You didn't look at me like that.

936
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:38,032
Gosh, what a relief.

937
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:41,119
I guess it's because I'm being loved.

938
00:59:41,869 --> 00:59:43,830
I'm not pathetically clinging

939
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:45,999
and begging for love,
like I did back then.

940
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:49,460
I guess even my eyes have also regained
a sense of self-esteem.

941
00:59:49,544 --> 00:59:51,296
Use your common sense and hear me out.

942
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:54,549
Let's say you two are really dating
and are here on a trip.

943
00:59:54,632 --> 00:59:57,176
Are you saying you two
just happened to run into me

944
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:59,846
with a job proposal, of all times?

945
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:02,890
You expect me to believe that?

946
01:00:04,183 --> 01:00:05,476
How much did he offer you?

947
01:00:06,144 --> 01:00:08,187
I'll pay you instead,
so just drop the act.

948
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,107
Whether you accept his offer or not,

949
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:13,401
that's your choice to make.

950
01:00:13,985 --> 01:00:15,945
But don't speak ill of him.

951
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:18,031
He's the man I love.

952
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,284
Have you lost your damn mind?

953
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:35,340
Tell me, Ji-hyeok.

954
01:00:35,423 --> 01:00:37,550
What made you fall for Da-rim?

955
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,011
Well,

956
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:43,097
I'm not sure if I should answer
that question right now.

957
01:00:44,515 --> 01:00:46,768
Once I start talking about her charms,

958
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,187
we'd be here all night.

959
01:00:49,270 --> 01:00:50,104
Would you be okay with that?

960
01:00:54,859 --> 01:00:57,987
What about you?
What made you fall in love with me?

961
01:00:59,364 --> 01:01:03,284
Well, I like that you take
good care of your business.

962
01:01:03,368 --> 01:01:06,412
It shows you have passion
and a sense of responsibility.

963
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:11,125
Gosh, you're silly. Who isn't like that?

964
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:13,252
There are plenty of people like that.

965
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:17,340
People who waste time,
refusing to study or work properly.

966
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:18,758
A waste of space.

967
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:20,093
There's a surprising number of them.

968
01:01:20,176 --> 01:01:21,552
Right?

969
01:01:22,387 --> 01:01:23,429
I'm not sure.

970
01:01:24,305 --> 01:01:26,432
There's no way of knowing for sure

971
01:01:27,558 --> 01:01:30,561
if it's a lack of opportunity or effort
that's the issue for those people.

972
01:01:31,688 --> 01:01:35,483
I'm not about judging people
just based on their achievements.

973
01:01:35,566 --> 01:01:38,236
I find it a bit too superficial
and snobby.

974
01:01:38,319 --> 01:01:41,280
You said you're planning
to get married next spring, right?

975
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,493
-That's right.
-Then, you must've met her parents.

976
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:47,537
Of course, I met both of them.

977
01:01:48,454 --> 01:01:49,831
I see.

978
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:52,709
You met both of them.

979
01:01:55,586 --> 01:01:57,880
I was only able to meet her father
through a picture.

980
01:01:58,881 --> 01:02:01,843
It would've been nice
if we had met while he was still alive.

981
01:02:04,262 --> 01:02:06,931
I'd like to believe

982
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,935
that he's looking down on us
and cheering us on.

983
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:15,940
Yeah, I lost my mind.

984
01:02:16,023 --> 01:02:17,150
That's not all.

985
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:21,154
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad! So what?

986
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:33,249
Then, what about her siblings?

987
01:02:33,332 --> 01:02:36,002
Babe, I'm feeling really sick
all of a sudden.

988
01:02:36,085 --> 01:02:37,587
-What?
-I feel a bit feverish too.

989
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:39,088
Let's go grab some medicine.

990
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:41,924
Please excuse us for a moment.
My stomach hurts so much.

991
01:02:42,008 --> 01:02:44,343
-Okay, let's go.
-My goodness.

992
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,137
-Excuse us.
-What…

993
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:53,186
What are we going to do?

994
01:02:58,649 --> 01:03:00,610
I think he's figured us out.

995
01:03:01,194 --> 01:03:03,196
He's just going to keep digging.
What should we do?

996
01:03:03,279 --> 01:03:06,157
I'm shaking in my boots here.
I don't think I can continue.

997
01:03:06,240 --> 01:03:08,659
From what I see, he's green with envy.

998
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:12,497
Well, it was also what I was going for.

999
01:03:12,580 --> 01:03:14,373
You just don't know.

1000
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,209
He can be quite perceptive.

1001
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:18,377
He was outright interrogating me earlier,

1002
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,254
asking about my cut for scouting him.

1003
01:03:20,338 --> 01:03:22,298
-Really?
-Yes.

1004
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:27,720
Then, let's do this.

1005
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,224
Let's stop here for today
and try to buy some time.

1006
01:03:31,307 --> 01:03:32,934
Please make your way to the Sky Garden…

1007
01:03:33,017 --> 01:03:36,938
And we'll set something up
after we're fully briefed on each other.

1008
01:03:37,021 --> 01:03:39,899
That will also give you a chance
to tell me more about him.

1009
01:03:41,317 --> 01:03:44,403
And you should set up
a dinner for us in Seoul with Su-jin.

1010
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:46,489
The firework display will begin shortly.

1011
01:03:46,572 --> 01:03:48,324
-Ji-hyeok.
-What?

1012
01:03:48,407 --> 01:03:51,536
-What?
-Please make your way…

1013
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:52,495
Okay.

1014
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:54,622
I'm not asking you to do it for free.

1015
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:56,582
I'll be sure to compensate--

1016
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:43,671
That was close.

1017
01:04:45,673 --> 01:04:46,507
I'm sorry.

1018
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:49,552
Jeong-gwon was walking toward us.

1019
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:53,180
I kept sending you signals,

1020
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,600
but you weren't picking up on any of them.

1021
01:04:57,143 --> 01:05:00,646
It's better than getting caught, right?

1022
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:03,232
Are you mad?

1023
01:05:08,195 --> 01:05:10,197
I'm going to head out first.

1024
01:05:10,823 --> 01:05:11,991
I must be out of my mind.

1025
01:05:20,666 --> 01:05:21,667
Should we…

1026
01:05:23,461 --> 01:05:24,670
do that again?

1027
01:05:26,339 --> 01:05:27,214
Sorry?

1028
01:05:27,298 --> 01:05:29,133
Let's do that again.

1029
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:46,877
That night,

1030
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,839
we were nitric acid and sulfuric acid.

1031
01:06:51,090 --> 01:06:52,091
And our kiss…

1032
01:06:55,386 --> 01:06:56,595
was dynamite.

1033
01:07:12,278 --> 01:07:17,199
DYNAMITE KISS

1034
01:07:37,303 --> 01:07:40,222
So, maybe we should remain
a couple for one more day.

1035
01:07:40,306 --> 01:07:41,515
Let's go on a date.

1036
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,560
I can't believe he asked me out.
This is insane!

1037
01:07:44,643 --> 01:07:45,519
Hey, Seon-u. What's up?

1038
01:07:45,603 --> 01:07:47,897
You need to come back right now.
Your mom has collapsed.

1039
01:07:47,980 --> 01:07:50,024
I didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

1040
01:07:50,107 --> 01:07:52,026
He must think I'm a weirdo.

1041
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:53,778
What's so special about her anyway?

1042
01:07:53,861 --> 01:07:55,321
She blew my mind.

1043
01:07:55,404 --> 01:07:56,530
Then you have to find her, no matter what!

1044
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,657
-Welcome to the company.
-A TF team?

1045
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:01,202
We're planning to put together
a team of moms.

1046
01:08:01,285 --> 01:08:02,787
I know this is wrong.

1047
01:08:02,870 --> 01:08:05,539
I honestly don't think
I have any other choice left.

1048
01:08:06,123 --> 01:08:09,126
Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

1049
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:14,006
