1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:01:44,646 --> 00:01:46,523
EPISODE 2

3
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,443
This is insane.

4
00:01:51,528 --> 00:01:52,904
Just insane.

5
00:01:54,239 --> 00:01:55,406
What should I do now?

6
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,952
Right. Should I just run away?

7
00:02:01,371 --> 00:02:03,123
Seriously, what have I done?

8
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,043
Why did I do that?

9
00:02:07,752 --> 00:02:08,962
But it was nice…

10
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,297
No. Pull yourself together.

11
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,049
Stop it.

12
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,977
Oh my.

13
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,687
Looks like someone needs
a little pick-me-up.

14
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,023
You must've given it your all, huh?

15
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:33,153
What?

16
00:02:33,778 --> 00:02:35,321
Hey, Da-rim!

17
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:36,948
You're back.

18
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:42,203
Well, don't you look completely drained.

19
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,080
What are you talking about?

20
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:46,875
You've had one too many drinks.
Drink some water.

21
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,127
Darn it.

22
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,012
It's dance time!

23
00:03:04,309 --> 00:03:05,602
Jeong-gwon, let's get out there.

24
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:07,729
You can't even stand straight right now.

25
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,730
Come on!

26
00:03:09,397 --> 00:03:12,567
Do you really not feel anything
after seeing this hot and heavy couple?

27
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:19,949
All right.

28
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,452
Shall we go and dance then?

29
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:27,332
You should join us.

30
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,214
Sure.

31
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:39,802
Let's go.

32
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,633
You were right.

33
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:20,969
I can tell that Kim Jeong-gwon

34
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:22,720
is suspicious of us.

35
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:26,933
Don't look.

36
00:04:27,433 --> 00:04:29,894
I guess we're visibly awkward
around each other.

37
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:31,938
Just follow my lead.

38
00:04:43,741 --> 00:04:46,369
Excuse me for a moment.

39
00:06:51,994 --> 00:06:52,954
Don't bother.

40
00:06:53,037 --> 00:06:54,747
Your mouth gets dry when you're nervous.

41
00:07:00,211 --> 00:07:01,337
Let go of me.

42
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,631
Wearing a dress that doesn't suit you,
and even dancing.

43
00:07:03,714 --> 00:07:05,383
You're really putting in the effort.

44
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:06,717
Do you want to let all that go to waste?

45
00:07:07,301 --> 00:07:10,638
-What?
-Well, it wasn't entirely ineffective.

46
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:13,808
Seeing you go so far as to kiss
another man to get my attention

47
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,060
sure got me fired up.

48
00:07:19,313 --> 00:07:20,189
Meet me later tonight.

49
00:07:20,273 --> 00:07:21,357
What?

50
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,527
I'm giving you a chance
for old times' sake.

51
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,362
I'll get us a room and text you.

52
00:07:29,532 --> 00:07:31,868
It looks like you've become

53
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:35,580
a complete asshole since I last saw you.

54
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:38,791
I'm done associating with you.

55
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:42,295
I've become part of the elite,

56
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:45,131
important enough
for that boyfriend of yours

57
00:07:45,214 --> 00:07:46,674
to jump through hoops
in hopes of scouting me.

58
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,760
The more cooperative you are
with my proposal,

59
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:52,555
the more I'll be open

60
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,308
to that scouting proposal of his.

61
00:07:55,892 --> 00:07:57,435
So let's strive for mutual aid.

62
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,520
You'll make some money yourself too.

63
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:02,315
You asshole.

64
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,485
That's enough playing hard to get.
Admit it. You like it too.

65
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,819
You're insane.

66
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:08,029
Let go. Let go of me!

67
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:14,619
Damn it. What the hell?

68
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:17,538
Do you even know how much
this mistake is going to cost you?

69
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:18,498
I don't.

70
00:08:23,044 --> 00:08:24,545
Hey, I thought you said one trillion.

71
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:26,172
Is a trillion a joke to you, asshole?

72
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,218
Even if it were for 100 trillion,

73
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,638
I wouldn't work with scum like you.

74
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:38,184
Leave.

75
00:08:54,325 --> 00:08:55,660
Goddamn it!

76
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:04,794
All done.

77
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,798
Thanks.

78
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:12,301
-Is your wrist okay?
-I'm fine.

79
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,721
But I'm worried
that your wound might get worse.

80
00:09:17,515 --> 00:09:18,558
It's just been treated.

81
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:23,729
I'm sorry.

82
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,857
I wasn't of much help, was I?

83
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,654
You were.

84
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:33,990
Working with people like him

85
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,075
only leads to bigger problems.

86
00:09:41,747 --> 00:09:44,083
But he's still someone I once loved.

87
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:46,669
It's a bit disheartening.

88
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,380
You were mistaken.

89
00:09:50,506 --> 00:09:51,716
You mistook it for love.

90
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,344
Does real love even exist to begin with?

91
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:57,263
Come on. That's taking it too far.

92
00:09:57,930 --> 00:09:59,515
Of course, real love exists.

93
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,101
It definitely exists.

94
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,270
It's just that

95
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:09,275
there are people who fail to protect it
until the end.

96
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,667
What is that?

97
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:34,592
It's so pretty.

98
00:10:35,968 --> 00:10:37,428
The water is glowing.

99
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,432
It's so pretty.

100
00:10:41,515 --> 00:10:42,850
It's bioluminescent plankton.

101
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,852
When they are stimulated by waves
or external factors,

102
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:47,647
they get startled and emit a blue light.

103
00:10:47,730 --> 00:10:50,191
I see. That's so cool.

104
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:54,612
It's like an aurora.

105
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:57,740
It's so pretty.

106
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:42,368
I got too excited, didn't I?

107
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:44,662
I didn't even do enough
to earn this dress,

108
00:11:44,745 --> 00:11:45,746
and I got all excited for nothing.

109
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,790
So, maybe we should

110
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,793
remain a couple for one more day.

111
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,796
Oh, is there someone else
you're looking to scout?

112
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,925
But I'm sure you already noticed
that I'm terrible at acting.

113
00:11:58,592 --> 00:11:59,677
That's not true.

114
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,848
You were excellent.
It was as if we were a real couple.

115
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:05,391
You kissed me, and…

116
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:08,394
I did that because I was pushed into it
out of urgency.

117
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,187
It was an emergency.

118
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,730
An extension of our deal, if you will.

119
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:15,609
Plus, you did it to me too.

120
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,156
I didn't do it for our deal.

121
00:12:21,699 --> 00:12:22,575
What?

122
00:12:23,492 --> 00:12:24,910
I did it for personal reasons.

123
00:12:26,829 --> 00:12:28,706
I'd like to spend the day
with you tomorrow.

124
00:12:29,623 --> 00:12:30,708
Not professionally,

125
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,669
but very much personally.

126
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:44,013
Well…

127
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,432
Then…

128
00:12:47,057 --> 00:12:48,142
Are you--

129
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,560
Let's go on a date.

130
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:10,873
I can't believe he asked me out.

131
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,541
This is insane!

132
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,756
"I didn't do it for our deal."

133
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,174
"I did it for personal reasons."

134
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,801
He did it for personal reasons!

135
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:24,637
Oh my gosh!

136
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:27,932
Hold on.

137
00:13:28,015 --> 00:13:29,183
What should I wear tomorrow?

138
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,452
HOW TO KISS WELL

139
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,169
GYEONG-MIN

140
00:14:00,214 --> 00:14:02,341
Hey, Ji-hyeok. How did it go?

141
00:14:02,925 --> 00:14:05,177
What do you think the perfect kiss is?

142
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,471
What? What was that?

143
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:09,098
A kiss…

144
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:12,142
is when two souls intertwine

145
00:14:12,851 --> 00:14:14,520
to become one.

146
00:14:15,646 --> 00:14:17,565
Just like when nitric acid
and sulfuric acid combine,

147
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:19,483
like dynamite.

148
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:21,944
Boom.

149
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,321
Did you kiss Kim Jeong-gwon?

150
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,076
Do you seriously want a beating?

151
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,954
That punk is a total scum.

152
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:33,038
He's out.

153
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:35,249
So you didn't get him.

154
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:37,835
Get back here now.
We need to do damage control.

155
00:14:38,794 --> 00:14:41,714
I'll take care of Hassan, so don't worry.

156
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,220
I should be pursuing
someone else right now.

157
00:14:48,304 --> 00:14:49,972
What? Who?

158
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:51,974
Someone.

159
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,603
Anyhow, I won't be back tomorrow.

160
00:14:55,686 --> 00:14:56,687
Bye.

161
00:15:04,028 --> 00:15:05,905
Why is the sun taking forever to rise?

162
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,431
-Ta-da!
-Look over here!

163
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:33,349
DADDY LOVES YOU

164
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:34,350
MOMMY LOVES YOU

165
00:15:37,102 --> 00:15:39,229
Can you look over here?

166
00:15:39,313 --> 00:15:40,230
Look at that.

167
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:44,902
That's great. Just one more.
Look over here.

168
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,028
Great.

169
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:47,738
Look over here.

170
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,575
-One more time.
-Look over there.

171
00:15:51,659 --> 00:15:52,785
Look over here.

172
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,412
Smile!

173
00:15:57,790 --> 00:15:58,791
Good job today.

174
00:16:03,587 --> 00:16:06,048
A chairman is expected to do
all sorts of things nowadays.

175
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,176
But still, it's bound
to be a great exposure.

176
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:11,553
The video of you
changing a baby's diaper went viral,

177
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,013
and it led to 10,000 more followers.

178
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,015
Interview requests
are flooding in as well.

179
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:16,058
That's true.

180
00:16:17,309 --> 00:16:18,143
Anyway, what's that?

181
00:16:18,227 --> 00:16:20,688
A five-year strategy plan
for overseas expansion.

182
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:22,982
CHAIRMAN GONG CHANG-HO

183
00:16:23,065 --> 00:16:25,401
Wow, this is so thorough.

184
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,652
We just talked about it.

185
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,988
I'm your daughter, after all.

186
00:16:37,162 --> 00:16:38,372
It's time for Natural BeBe

187
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:41,583
to become the number one in baby products,
not just in Asia but in the world.

188
00:16:42,084 --> 00:16:44,628
In Europe, South America, and even Africa.

189
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:50,467
I think it'll be more than possible
with the right distribution network.

190
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,428
That's the issue in the end.

191
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:56,765
How about working with Chairman Yu
of Taeyu C&T?

192
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,770
They're already partnered up
with another company.

193
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,189
Do you think
they'd even consider working with us?

194
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:07,443
That's why I decided to marry off Ji-hyeok
to Chairman Yu's daughter.

195
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:08,652
What? Marry…

196
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:11,196
Marriage?

197
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:40,726
Hello, Ms. Yu.

198
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:46,065
Our pieces are so luxurious, aren't they?

199
00:17:46,148 --> 00:17:47,399
Of course, they are.

200
00:17:47,483 --> 00:17:49,693
The director has quite the gorgeous,
discerning eye for art.

201
00:17:51,278 --> 00:17:52,362
That's the issue.

202
00:17:52,446 --> 00:17:53,489
Gorgeous.

203
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:56,033
This is all so my mom's taste.

204
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,785
What's the issue with that?

205
00:17:57,868 --> 00:17:58,911
It's intimidating.

206
00:17:58,994 --> 00:18:00,913
When you look at these works,

207
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:04,166
you feel like you have to be better,
make more money,

208
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:06,376
and wear expensive clothes.

209
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,921
That sense of luxury
is our art hall's mission.

210
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,465
That's why our audience demographic
remains limited.

211
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,594
Can't we be a bit not luxurious
and not gorgeous?

212
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:20,349
I'd love to hold an exhibition
that brings peace to its viewers.

213
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:22,434
Perhaps one reminiscent

214
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,936
of a mom's homemade

215
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,688
kimchi stew?

216
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,451
-Wait.
-Wait.

217
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,286
-Good job. Here you go.
-Oh no.

218
00:19:57,362 --> 00:19:58,530
Excuse me.

219
00:19:58,614 --> 00:20:00,324
Do you mind stepping aside a bit?

220
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,075
Sure.

221
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:03,952
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

222
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:15,047
The air is so crisp.

223
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:17,257
It feels like
a weight's been lifted off my chest.

224
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,343
Was there a lot bottled up?

225
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,553
Yes, a lot.

226
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:25,557
If I'm being honest,
I've been a hermit for the last few years.

227
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:28,185
It's been a long time since I traveled.

228
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:30,687
For years? Why?

229
00:20:30,771 --> 00:20:32,231
The exam I've been…

230
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:36,693
No, what I meant was,

231
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,613
I'm dealing with some family issues.

232
00:20:40,697 --> 00:20:44,826
Those issues basically pushed me
into taking this trip as well.

233
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:46,078
What sort of family issues?

234
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,207
That tree looks so amazing.

235
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,213
It's just as amazing as the
Grandfather Tree in my neighborhood.

236
00:20:58,507 --> 00:20:59,841
"Grandfather Tree"?

237
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,759
Yes.

238
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:02,261
It's a local landmark.

239
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:04,680
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

240
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,809
There's a small store next to it,

241
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:12,312
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

242
00:21:12,896 --> 00:21:15,148
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

243
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:20,946
I'm envious.

244
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,573
I don't have a place like that.

245
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:27,828
A patch of clover.

246
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:29,413
Oh my.

247
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,540
Let's see.

248
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,045
Let's see now.

249
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:43,719
I found one.

250
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,388
Look, I found one!

251
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:48,765
A four-leaf clover.

252
00:21:54,521 --> 00:21:55,397
Here.

253
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,775
-What?
-Take it.

254
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:03,613
You're giving it to me?

255
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:05,782
-Yes.
-Why don't you keep it?

256
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:07,659
You worked hard to find it.

257
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,746
I've already found my luck.

258
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:13,081
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

259
00:22:22,507 --> 00:22:23,675
Kim Jeong-gwon

260
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:27,012
has long been a thorn in my side.

261
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,598
Thanks to you, I got my sweet revenge.

262
00:22:30,098 --> 00:22:31,850
I couldn't wish for better luck.

263
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:35,479
So you should be the one to take this.

264
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:48,492
Do you have a wish?

265
00:22:48,575 --> 00:22:50,118
One that requires luck?

266
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:57,542
A wish…

267
00:22:58,668 --> 00:22:59,586
Not right now.

268
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,546
But…

269
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:03,173
I might have one soon.

270
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:08,762
Wait for me!

271
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:11,556
Are you sure

272
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,225
you can just hang out like this?

273
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,268
We failed our mission yesterday.

274
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:17,854
I hope your company doesn't reprimand you.

275
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,439
Who would reprimand me?

276
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:21,817
I'm the boss.

277
00:23:22,776 --> 00:23:24,986
Oh, you are?

278
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:26,905
No wonder.

279
00:23:26,988 --> 00:23:28,573
You just swiped your card with ease

280
00:23:28,657 --> 00:23:31,326
at the shop yesterday
with the utmost charisma.

281
00:23:31,409 --> 00:23:32,619
That was nothing.

282
00:23:34,579 --> 00:23:35,705
That's amazing.

283
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,126
We're around the same age,
and you already own a business.

284
00:23:39,209 --> 00:23:42,087
I think I'd be too scared
to start one myself.

285
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,296
It isn't easy.

286
00:23:43,839 --> 00:23:44,673
But…

287
00:23:50,428 --> 00:23:52,055
Take a look. Here.

288
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,354
It's very toned.

289
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,607
You must work out a lot.

290
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:06,319
That's right. I pushed through the pain
and worked out every day.

291
00:24:06,403 --> 00:24:09,531
You need to tear your muscles
to make them grow.

292
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,783
I believe work is the same too.

293
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,619
If you just push through and charge ahead,

294
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,037
one day…

295
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,417
you become strong.

296
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:22,669
You're definitely

297
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:24,087
nothing like me.

298
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,812
Dolphins!

299
00:24:41,938 --> 00:24:43,273
They're so cute!

300
00:24:43,773 --> 00:24:44,858
Da-rim.

301
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:46,693
You get a better view here.

302
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:48,069
-Oh, you're right.
-Come over here.

303
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:52,532
They're so cute.

304
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:57,329
Take my hand.

305
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:33,073
-Da-rim!
-I can't swim…

306
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,200
Help…

307
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,409
I can't swim…

308
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,295
Are you okay?

309
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:32,859
Wait.

310
00:27:34,569 --> 00:27:35,403
What?

311
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,989
I just remembered

312
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,909
that we haven't showered.

313
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:42,577
Right.

314
00:27:43,787 --> 00:27:46,081
Can't we count that dip in the sea as one?

315
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:47,999
No.

316
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:53,797
Okay. Hold on.

317
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,964
-Okay.
-Hold on.

318
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:01,638
Stay right here.

319
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:02,555
Okay.

320
00:28:09,979 --> 00:28:14,818
The wedding ceremony of Mr. Kang Min-guk
and Ms. Go Da-jeong will begin shortly.

321
00:28:14,901 --> 00:28:18,196
-All guests should make their way
-It's starting.

322
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,740
-into the hall and take their seats.
-Okay, please go ahead first.

323
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,785
-I repeat.
-My goodness.

324
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,954
-Where in the world did Min-guk go?
-The wedding ceremony of Mr. Kang Min-guk

325
00:28:26,037 --> 00:28:29,249
-and Ms. Go Da-jeong will begin shortly.
-How strange.

326
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:32,168
All guests should make their way
into the hall and take their seats.

327
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:35,380
Please wish them well
through a warm round of applause.

328
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:47,100
BLUEBIRD COIN

329
00:28:47,183 --> 00:28:51,229
Jeez. Where the hell
is that bastard Kang Min-guk hiding?

330
00:28:51,813 --> 00:28:52,897
Do you think he ran off?

331
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:54,816
He wouldn't abandon his own wedding.

332
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:56,151
He'll show up for the ceremony.

333
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,902
But what if he really ran off?

334
00:28:57,986 --> 00:28:59,779
Should we at least collect
the congratulatory money?

335
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,157
Are you being serious right now?

336
00:29:02,741 --> 00:29:03,867
If we catch him,

337
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,828
his kidneys, heart,

338
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:11,291
and even his eyes will be sold off
to collect his debt if need be.

339
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:13,042
Right, we'll do whatever it takes.

340
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,421
Min-guk!

341
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:18,590
Da-jeong!

342
00:29:18,673 --> 00:29:20,467
-What's gotten into you?
-Damn it.

343
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,594
Have you actually lost your mind?

344
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:24,179
The ceremony is in five minutes.

345
00:29:24,262 --> 00:29:25,638
Yeah. Let's get out of here now.

346
00:29:25,722 --> 00:29:27,640
If we don't,
this wedding will become a funeral.

347
00:29:27,724 --> 00:29:28,892
-What?
-Hurry up.

348
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:29,976
-What are you talking about?
-Hurry.

349
00:29:30,059 --> 00:29:30,935
Wait.

350
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,353
Hurry up!

351
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,396
Min-guk!

352
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,400
What on earth?

353
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,819
Where did she go?

354
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:45,325
She's not here either.

355
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:48,286
What's going on? Where did they all go?

356
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,079
Excuse me.

357
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,499
Who are you and what are you doing here?

358
00:29:53,958 --> 00:29:55,335
My goodness!

359
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:58,713
Hey, lady,
where did you hide your daughter?

360
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,758
Where the hell did you hide the crooks?

361
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,053
Oh my goodness.
Who are you calling crooks?

362
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:06,262
Let go of me.

363
00:30:06,346 --> 00:30:07,472
Let go!

364
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:08,723
Damn it.

365
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,142
This bastard really fled.

366
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,394
He took us for fools.

367
00:30:13,478 --> 00:30:14,771
Don't just stand there.

368
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,147
Tear this place apart!

369
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,065
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

370
00:30:19,651 --> 00:30:21,361
What in the world is going on?

371
00:30:21,945 --> 00:30:22,946
Hold on.

372
00:30:23,863 --> 00:30:24,823
Careful.

373
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,492
I'll get you some water.

374
00:30:29,244 --> 00:30:31,162
What on earth is happening?

375
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:34,541
Mom.

376
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:37,043
Min-guk said he'd pay me right back,

377
00:30:37,126 --> 00:30:39,587
so I gave him your savings,
the home equity loan,

378
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:41,589
and I even got a loan from a loan shark.

379
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:44,008
But he lost everything in crypto.

380
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,637
Seon-u…

381
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,305
Ma'am?

382
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,682
How…

383
00:30:50,765 --> 00:30:52,308
Ma'am?

384
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:55,353
Ma'am!

385
00:30:55,937 --> 00:30:58,147
Don't get ahead of yourself.

386
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:11,911
SEON-U

387
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,124
Hey, Seon-u. What's up?

388
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:18,668
You need to come back right now.
Your mom has collapsed.

389
00:31:20,128 --> 00:31:20,962
What?

390
00:31:21,796 --> 00:31:25,258
Both Da-jeong and her fiancé disappeared,
and the wedding got canceled.

391
00:31:25,341 --> 00:31:27,302
Your mom collapsed from the shock.

392
00:31:27,802 --> 00:31:29,637
I took her to a hospital right away,

393
00:31:30,305 --> 00:31:31,806
and they said she had a heart attack.

394
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:33,558
She's in surgery now.

395
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:39,898
Da-rim?

396
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,483
Da-rim?

397
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:53,995
Da-rim, are you in there?

398
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:56,831
Da-rim?

399
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:01,169
You're okay, right?

400
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:03,588
Da-rim?

401
00:33:47,817 --> 00:33:49,152
How is she?

402
00:33:50,445 --> 00:33:52,280
They said we didn't miss the golden hour.

403
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:54,866
We just need to wait for now.

404
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:55,950
Seon-u.

405
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,830
I can't let my mom go like this.

406
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,835
How could I when I never even
properly treated her to anything?

407
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:07,795
Right?

408
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,978
It'll be okay.

409
00:34:26,522 --> 00:34:28,274
She's a strong person.

410
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:31,235
She'll get through this.

411
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:35,073
You're right.

412
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,115
She'll be fine.

413
00:34:47,043 --> 00:34:49,045
Where in the world are you?

414
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:51,422
I've landed in Seoul.

415
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,174
I'm on my way.

416
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:55,134
How'd it go with Hassan?

417
00:34:55,218 --> 00:34:56,803
I took care of it.

418
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:59,889
It seems that he also did
a background check on Kim Jeong-gwon.

419
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,891
He actually thanked me
for weeding him out.

420
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:03,518
That's a relief.

421
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,895
I'll compile a list of developers
who can replace him.

422
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:07,897
All right.

423
00:35:08,731 --> 00:35:11,025
By the way,
what were you saying yesterday?

424
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,653
Something about a kiss and souls.

425
00:35:13,736 --> 00:35:15,238
It sounded like a woman was involved.

426
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,614
Forget it.

427
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:18,407
Just let it go.

428
00:35:18,491 --> 00:35:20,159
Oh, come on. Why?

429
00:35:20,243 --> 00:35:22,161
You said it felt like an explosion.

430
00:35:22,245 --> 00:35:24,497
My rage exploded! Satisfied? Hang up.

431
00:35:28,751 --> 00:35:30,962
Love and intertwined souls?
What a load of crap.

432
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:00,908
It's just as amazing as the
Grandfather Tree in my neighborhood.

433
00:36:01,701 --> 00:36:02,535
"Grandfather Tree"?

434
00:36:02,618 --> 00:36:05,371
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

435
00:36:06,038 --> 00:36:08,583
There's a small store next to it,

436
00:36:08,666 --> 00:36:11,919
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

437
00:36:12,003 --> 00:36:14,380
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

438
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,680
What am I even doing right now?

439
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:29,061
NAME: JEONG MYEONG-SUN

440
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,330
Hey.

441
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:49,749
I'll stay with her.

442
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:51,500
You should go home, shower,
and take a nap.

443
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,585
You haven't slept at all.

444
00:36:52,668 --> 00:36:55,129
No, I'm fine.

445
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:56,380
Just do as I say.

446
00:36:56,964 --> 00:36:59,342
Her surgery went well,
so don't worry too much.

447
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,306
Okay.

448
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:14,565
AMOUNT DUE: 10,100,067 WON

449
00:37:16,984 --> 00:37:19,028
Is it normal for hospital bills

450
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,530
to be this high?

451
00:37:21,614 --> 00:37:22,782
That's just for her surgery.

452
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:24,700
You'll be charged more
for the duration of the hospitalization.

453
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,870
We'll give you another bill for that
when she gets discharged.

454
00:37:27,954 --> 00:37:31,499
For now, you just need to settle
her surgery bill.

455
00:37:32,124 --> 00:37:35,044
You can pay by card,
cash, or wire transfer.

456
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,254
How would you like to pay?

457
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:51,602
Da-rim.

458
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,113
Da-rim.

459
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:04,824
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

460
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:08,035
You saw them bullying Da-jeong
and taught them a lesson?

461
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:09,662
Yeah, I did.

462
00:38:09,745 --> 00:38:11,497
I even made them apologize to Da-jeong.

463
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:14,542
My goodness, look at you
being such a reliable big sister.

464
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,294
I'm going to become even stronger

465
00:38:16,377 --> 00:38:18,296
and protect you and Mom too.

466
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:22,091
Sounds good. I feel so reassured,
thanks to my daughter.

467
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:23,801
I can feel the power!

468
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,469
-You're the best, Da-rim!
-The best!

469
00:38:27,722 --> 00:38:28,806
Da-rim is the best!

470
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,914
Can I help you?

471
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:56,834
Ms. Go Da-jeong lives here, right?

472
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:59,253
Yes, she's my younger sister.

473
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,464
I'm from First Class Bank.

474
00:39:01,547 --> 00:39:03,674
Ms. Go took out
a home equity loan on this property,

475
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:05,176
and her payment is overdue.

476
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,762
At this rate,
foreclosure will be inevitable.

477
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:10,097
GO DA-JEONG

478
00:39:11,599 --> 00:39:13,809
The phone you are trying to reach
is turned off.

479
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,853
You will be redirected to voicemail,

480
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,105
and charges will apply after the beep.

481
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,071
Have you lost your mind?

482
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:27,198
You must have.

483
00:39:28,282 --> 00:39:30,451
How could you put our house in jeopardy?

484
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,328
If we lose the house,

485
00:39:32,411 --> 00:39:34,372
are Mom and I supposed to be
out on the streets?

486
00:39:35,331 --> 00:39:36,165
Hey.

487
00:39:38,876 --> 00:39:41,087
Mom collapsed!

488
00:39:42,046 --> 00:39:44,673
What am I supposed to do?

489
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,593
What in the world am I supposed to do?

490
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,668
UTILITY BILL, INSURANCE, TRANSPORTATION

491
00:40:20,751 --> 00:40:22,753
PHONE BILL, HOUSEHOLD SUPPLIES FEES

492
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:26,424
TOTAL INCOME, TOTAL EXPENSES, SAVINGS

493
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,969
SPARE MONEY: 18,900 WON

494
00:40:59,999 --> 00:41:01,375
Come to think of it,

495
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:04,545
I didn't even have a chance
to say goodbye.

496
00:41:06,922 --> 00:41:08,841
He must think I'm a weirdo.

497
00:41:13,929 --> 00:41:15,264
COUNTER 3, LOANS

498
00:41:16,807 --> 00:41:19,768
With your unemployment status
and low credit score,

499
00:41:19,852 --> 00:41:21,896
you'd be eligible
for up to two million won.

500
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:23,731
Would you like to proceed?

501
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:33,449
APARTMENT-BACKED LOAN

502
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,117
SAME-DAY LOANS FOR OFFICE WORKERS

503
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:43,876
Welcome.

504
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,090
Where are the nail clippers?

505
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:51,800
I'll get it for you.

506
00:42:09,568 --> 00:42:10,569
Sorry!

507
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:11,529
Oh no!

508
00:42:17,368 --> 00:42:18,702
It's okay.

509
00:42:34,635 --> 00:42:35,594
Can we get more iced water?

510
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:37,596
Sure. Coming!

511
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,518
HOSPITALIZATION FEE: 5,475,320 WON

512
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,619
Excuse me. Oh no.

513
00:43:11,463 --> 00:43:14,008
Da-jeong, I hope this reaches you.

514
00:43:14,967 --> 00:43:16,468
You must've been so scared.

515
00:43:17,136 --> 00:43:18,554
I hope you're feeling better now.

516
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,557
But you know,

517
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,602
I think it was a big shock to Mom too.

518
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:27,104
She collapsed.

519
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,231
She suffered a heart attack.

520
00:43:33,277 --> 00:43:35,487
They said her surgery went well,

521
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:37,448
so she should wake up soon.

522
00:43:39,199 --> 00:43:41,452
For now, don't worry about us.

523
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:43,287
Just make sure you're safe.

524
00:43:44,246 --> 00:43:46,540
I'll find the money somehow,

525
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:47,916
so don't worry.

526
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:51,503
Wherever you are, make sure you eat well.

527
00:43:52,129 --> 00:43:55,215
You need to take care of yourself
and stay healthy, okay?

528
00:43:56,300 --> 00:43:57,343
That again?

529
00:43:57,843 --> 00:43:59,887
How many times
are you going to listen to--

530
00:44:00,596 --> 00:44:01,430
How can you eat right now?

531
00:44:02,348 --> 00:44:06,393
How the hell can you eat
at a time like this?

532
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:17,946
It appears the portfolio submissions
we receive remain limited.

533
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:22,159
If you're okay with photography,
do you want to take a look?

534
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,286
They may not be famous,

535
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:27,206
but I have a collection
of personal favorites.

536
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:32,336
DEPUTY DIRECTOR YU HA-YEONG

537
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,140
His work has a nice vibe, doesn't it?

538
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:46,850
It does.

539
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,686
Is it because the model's pretty?

540
00:44:49,603 --> 00:44:50,813
It's because she's loved.

541
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:55,567
Look. Only people who are loved
can have that look in their eyes.

542
00:44:57,403 --> 00:44:58,695
Who's the photographer?

543
00:44:59,279 --> 00:45:00,697
His name is Kim Seon-u.

544
00:45:00,781 --> 00:45:02,991
It was an award-winning piece
a long time ago.

545
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:04,451
He hasn't been active since then.

546
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:06,453
Did he quit photography?

547
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:10,666
For now, get me his contact info
and find out what he's been up to.

548
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:11,583
Yes, ma'am.

549
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:39,945
I visit it whenever I feel stressed.

550
00:45:40,821 --> 00:45:42,865
There's a small store next to it,

551
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:47,161
so I get myself a chocolate ice cream
and eat it underneath the tree.

552
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,830
It somehow helps soothe my troubles.

553
00:45:54,209 --> 00:45:55,377
Found it.

554
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:25,574
HACKBERRY TREE, ZELKOVA TREE, GINKGO TREE

555
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,129
Yeah.

556
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,133
Then what happened?

557
00:46:57,439 --> 00:46:59,107
Another day of aimless searching?

558
00:47:01,026 --> 00:47:03,695
Jeez, you're one persistent man.

559
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:05,280
It's been days already.

560
00:47:07,699 --> 00:47:09,409
What's so special about her anyway?

561
00:47:14,248 --> 00:47:16,124
She blew my mind.

562
00:47:16,959 --> 00:47:19,127
You said it yourself. Chemical reaction.

563
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,339
You finally found the one!

564
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:24,258
Then you have to find her, no matter what!

565
00:47:24,841 --> 00:47:25,676
I'll help you.

566
00:47:29,221 --> 00:47:32,808
Almond-shaped, monolid eyes.

567
00:47:33,350 --> 00:47:35,519
And a high nose.

568
00:47:35,602 --> 00:47:37,104
What else did you say?

569
00:47:37,688 --> 00:47:38,564
She's cute.

570
00:47:39,982 --> 00:47:41,567
She's really cute when she smiles.

571
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,237
Almond-shaped eyes and a cute smile.

572
00:47:45,320 --> 00:47:46,738
That's a bit tricky.

573
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:48,949
Anyway…

574
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:49,908
The fried chicken's here.

575
00:47:51,577 --> 00:47:52,661
Hello.

576
00:47:52,744 --> 00:47:53,829
You're early.

577
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:55,706
Here.

578
00:47:56,415 --> 00:47:57,958
-Gyeong-min.
-Yes?

579
00:48:04,256 --> 00:48:05,966
-Do you want beer?
-Sounds good!

580
00:48:06,049 --> 00:48:07,092
Okay!

581
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:08,510
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

582
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:10,679
-Have a good night.
-You too.

583
00:48:23,108 --> 00:48:24,985
Ma'am, we're here to escort you.

584
00:48:46,548 --> 00:48:50,761
JUMYEONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL

585
00:48:51,637 --> 00:48:52,888
What does she look like?

586
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:53,930
Well…

587
00:48:55,349 --> 00:48:56,683
She has fair skin.

588
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,643
Okay.

589
00:48:57,726 --> 00:48:59,978
And she has a baby face.

590
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,652
-Her eyes are big and bright like this.
-Okay.

591
00:49:06,735 --> 00:49:09,112
But when she smiles,
they turn into cute crescent moons.

592
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:12,866
Oh, I know her.

593
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:15,243
You do? Really?

594
00:49:15,327 --> 00:49:16,870
That's me.

595
00:49:16,953 --> 00:49:19,206
This is exactly what I looked like
when I was young.

596
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,249
All the men used to line up
around the block.

597
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:25,295
Don't be ridiculous.

598
00:49:26,171 --> 00:49:28,548
So, what's her name?

599
00:49:31,051 --> 00:49:33,011
JUMYEONG PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL HEAD NURSE

600
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:34,596
Excuse me for a moment.

601
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:38,016
Hello?

602
00:49:39,893 --> 00:49:41,019
Right now?

603
00:49:41,937 --> 00:49:42,979
Okay.

604
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:46,191
Congratulations on being
the leading baby product brand

605
00:49:46,274 --> 00:49:47,401
for 20 consecutive years.

606
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,861
What's the secret
behind your lasting popularity?

607
00:49:49,945 --> 00:49:51,822
There's no secret.

608
00:49:52,989 --> 00:49:53,824
I always…

609
00:49:55,492 --> 00:49:59,996
make our products with the mindset
that my wife and kids will be using them.

610
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,084
I'm just grateful our consumers
have come to recognize our sincerity.

611
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:06,503
We all expected it, but it appears
your family was the motivation.

612
00:50:06,586 --> 00:50:08,046
It's our first time meeting,
Director Gong,

613
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,798
and I must say, you're beautiful.

614
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,259
You look just like your mother.

615
00:50:12,843 --> 00:50:13,677
Ma'am.

616
00:50:13,760 --> 00:50:16,263
What sort of daughter
is Director Gong at home?

617
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:35,449
Mom.

618
00:50:41,121 --> 00:50:44,541
I'm sorry to say,
but I think we'll wrap it up here.

619
00:50:44,624 --> 00:50:46,960
My wife's not feeling well.

620
00:50:47,461 --> 00:50:49,004
-Sure.
-Thank you.

621
00:50:53,967 --> 00:50:54,926
Mom.

622
00:50:56,261 --> 00:50:57,220
Are you okay?

623
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:05,687
Thank you.

624
00:51:15,363 --> 00:51:17,240
Rest for a bit before you come down.

625
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,534
I'll take you back to the hospital.

626
00:51:30,212 --> 00:51:31,630
Go take care of it.

627
00:51:31,713 --> 00:51:34,257
-Make sure that reporter keeps quiet.
-Yes, sir.

628
00:51:36,968 --> 00:51:38,470
Goodness gracious.

629
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:41,765
Have you lost your mind?

630
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,726
She's suffering as it is
from the side effects of her medication.

631
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:47,103
Did you have to bring her here
to play house?

632
00:51:47,187 --> 00:51:49,064
All she had to do was sit there quietly.

633
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:50,649
It's the least a deadbeat wife can do!

634
00:51:50,732 --> 00:51:51,942
It's because of you.

635
00:51:52,025 --> 00:51:53,151
What?

636
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:54,945
Why do you think
she can't do anything anymore?

637
00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:57,072
You made her like that!

638
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,281
Why you little…

639
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,040
Let her go now.

640
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:09,960
Just get a divorce already.

641
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:11,044
Divorce?

642
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:13,672
Did you forget what our company sells?

643
00:52:13,755 --> 00:52:15,674
Baby products
packaged with love and happiness.

644
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,969
And you refuse to let her go
to sell that public image.

645
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:22,556
Is that more important
than a person's life?

646
00:52:22,639 --> 00:52:23,807
What if she tries to…

647
00:52:33,859 --> 00:52:34,985
If you divorce her,

648
00:52:36,111 --> 00:52:37,362
I'll do whatever you want.

649
00:52:38,363 --> 00:52:39,739
All right, fine.

650
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,575
In that case,

651
00:52:42,701 --> 00:52:45,120
stop what you're doing now
and come work for the company.

652
00:52:45,203 --> 00:52:46,079
And

653
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:48,206
marry Chairman Yu's daughter.

654
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,083
If I do that,

655
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,460
will you let Mother go?

656
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,880
Did I ever fail to keep my word
when it came to the company?

657
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,424
Fine.

658
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,885
I'll write up the notarized document
regarding the agreement

659
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:02,304
and send it to you.

660
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:12,939
Notarized document?

661
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,485
He's my son, all right. How thorough.

662
00:53:18,153 --> 00:53:18,987
Did you hear that?

663
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,281
Make a position for Ji-hyeok
in the company.

664
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:22,324
Okay.

665
00:53:23,658 --> 00:53:26,411
But are you sure about this?

666
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:28,830
You're risking divorce.

667
00:53:28,914 --> 00:53:31,374
If it's a profitable deal,
there's no reason not to.

668
00:53:41,259 --> 00:53:42,093
Mom.

669
00:53:43,219 --> 00:53:44,846
I should've prevented it in advance.

670
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,098
I'm sorry.

671
00:53:47,182 --> 00:53:49,225
What do you have to be sorry about?

672
00:53:55,941 --> 00:53:56,775
Mom?

673
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:01,529
Mom.

674
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:04,240
Mom!

675
00:54:10,372 --> 00:54:11,206
Mom.

676
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,708
Just hang in there.

677
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,544
I promise you'll be free soon.

678
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:22,634
Ma'am, you can't do this here.

679
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,428
Then tell me why I was rejected.

680
00:54:26,012 --> 00:54:27,931
You have no experience at all.

681
00:54:28,014 --> 00:54:29,182
What do you mean?

682
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:31,184
What's wrong with you? Jeez.

683
00:54:31,267 --> 00:54:33,395
I wrote everything down in great detail.

684
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:35,939
-See?
-Let me take a look.

685
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:38,316
Hello, ma'am.

686
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:45,699
You left your first company
after three months.

687
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,910
I got pregnant as soon as I got married,
and I had terrible morning sickness.

688
00:54:49,494 --> 00:54:50,537
I see.

689
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:53,248
You left your second company

690
00:54:53,873 --> 00:54:55,041
after two months.

691
00:54:55,125 --> 00:54:57,836
My second child had trouble
adjusting to daycare.

692
00:54:59,045 --> 00:55:01,089
And you left your third company
after a month.

693
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:05,093
My youngest came down with pneumonia,
and I had to be there to--

694
00:55:05,176 --> 00:55:06,052
Exactly.

695
00:55:06,136 --> 00:55:09,472
You should go home
and look after your children.

696
00:55:09,556 --> 00:55:11,725
We don't hire people
who quit at the drop of a hat.

697
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,644
It'll only make the company a hot mess.
A hot, sweaty mess!

698
00:55:15,603 --> 00:55:16,938
He's my son, all right.

699
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,524
Make a position for Ji-hyeok
in the company.

700
00:55:20,108 --> 00:55:21,901
What did you just say?

701
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,570
How is motherhood not counted

702
00:55:23,653 --> 00:55:25,613
as the most significant
professional experience

703
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:28,033
by a baby product company?

704
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:30,577
That's true. You're right about that.

705
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:31,745
Pardon?

706
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:33,663
No, you can't, Ms. Gong.

707
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:35,999
She's not going to get any work done.

708
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:37,792
She'll whine and complain all day

709
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:40,462
before she just quits whenever she wants.

710
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,589
That sounds great.

711
00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:46,676
Let's hire a few more ladies
exactly like her

712
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:47,719
to make a team.

713
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:48,845
A team?

714
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,014
Applicants with the most
unimpressive resumes,

715
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:52,474
impossible personalities,

716
00:55:52,557 --> 00:55:54,559
and erratic behavior.

717
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:57,812
Any mom with a kid under 6 years old
is welcome.

718
00:55:57,896 --> 00:56:00,356
Why would we hire people like that?

719
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:03,943
My younger brother is joining the company.

720
00:56:04,027 --> 00:56:05,070
As his older sister,

721
00:56:05,153 --> 00:56:07,947
shouldn't I create
a suitable position for him?

722
00:56:18,958 --> 00:56:19,793
Mom.

723
00:56:21,461 --> 00:56:22,295
Mom…

724
00:56:24,339 --> 00:56:25,673
You're going to be okay.

725
00:56:26,466 --> 00:56:28,885
The surgery went really well.

726
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:32,597
And I'm right here.

727
00:56:34,933 --> 00:56:36,726
Why are you crying?

728
00:56:36,810 --> 00:56:38,436
You're already unwell enough as it is.

729
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:46,820
Sorry…

730
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:50,031
Why would you be sorry?

731
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,075
Mom.

732
00:56:53,618 --> 00:56:55,328
Don't worry about a thing now.

733
00:56:56,496 --> 00:56:58,373
I'm going to take care of everything.

734
00:56:59,958 --> 00:57:01,751
Just trust me.

735
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:03,336
Okay?

736
00:57:04,420 --> 00:57:05,296
Okay?

737
00:57:07,966 --> 00:57:09,467
Thank goodness.

738
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:14,889
Why do you keep crying?

739
00:57:20,311 --> 00:57:21,479
What's wrong?

740
00:57:21,563 --> 00:57:22,981
Stop crying.

741
00:57:24,649 --> 00:57:25,859
Thank you, Seon-u.

742
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:29,028
My mom's alive, thanks to you.

743
00:57:30,321 --> 00:57:31,322
Don't be silly.

744
00:57:36,619 --> 00:57:38,705
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

745
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:41,916
I thought about it,

746
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:44,127
and if I close down the studio,

747
00:57:44,210 --> 00:57:46,880
the deposit should be enough
to cover her medical bills.

748
00:57:46,963 --> 00:57:48,465
-So--
-Hey.

749
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,633
What are you talking about?

750
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:52,677
Why would you touch that money?

751
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,305
She was the one who looked after Jun

752
00:57:55,388 --> 00:57:57,390
when I was completely out of it
after my divorce.

753
00:57:59,934 --> 00:58:02,103
She's more or less a mother to me.

754
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:03,605
That's why you can't.

755
00:58:04,397 --> 00:58:05,732
Mom wouldn't want you to either.

756
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,526
You still have to raise Jun as well.

757
00:58:08,610 --> 00:58:10,778
No way. Don't be ridiculous.

758
00:58:11,362 --> 00:58:12,489
Then what?

759
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:14,449
Forget part-time.

760
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:18,036
I'll find a job
that pays me a proper salary.

761
00:58:19,454 --> 00:58:22,207
Once I start working,
I'll be able to get a loan as well.

762
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,085
Look how tough you've become, Go Da-rim.

763
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:33,968
I heard your muscles

764
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,223
need to be torn up
for them to grow stronger.

765
00:58:39,891 --> 00:58:41,267
No matter how hard it is,

766
00:58:42,060 --> 00:58:43,645
I need to grow new, stronger muscles.

767
00:58:44,812 --> 00:58:46,523
I'm the breadwinner now.

768
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:48,983
Who told you that?

769
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:53,738
Just someone I know.

770
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,997
If I qualify by age,
I fall short on experience.

771
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,085
And there's no company
that would accept me as an entry-level.

772
00:59:08,461 --> 00:59:09,712
This isn't looking good.

773
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:16,135
"No age, experience,
or education requirements"?

774
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,139
"Qualification requirements."

775
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:22,934
"A mother raising a child
under the age of 6."

776
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:24,727
That's it?

777
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:27,689
It is.

778
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:30,775
All I need is a kid?

779
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,737
So what?

780
00:59:35,530 --> 00:59:37,740
It's not like I can suddenly have a kid.

781
00:59:39,909 --> 00:59:42,579
Kim Jun, I told you to stop running.

782
00:59:42,662 --> 00:59:45,206
You're not sleeping either.
I'm going to play some more.

783
00:59:45,290 --> 00:59:46,791
Come here! Right now!

784
00:59:49,919 --> 00:59:51,212
You'll be in big trouble if I catch you!

785
00:59:54,215 --> 00:59:55,758
I mean,

786
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,635
there is a kid in our house.

787
00:59:57,719 --> 00:59:59,554
-Come here.
-No!

788
01:00:00,471 --> 01:00:03,808
Look at me and my nonsense.

789
01:00:03,891 --> 01:00:05,143
But then again,

790
01:00:05,810 --> 01:00:08,479
I'm pretty close to Jun.

791
01:00:08,563 --> 01:00:11,232
-Here you are!
-I could be a mother figure to him.

792
01:00:12,734 --> 01:00:13,568
Got you!

793
01:00:15,486 --> 01:00:16,446
DOWNLOAD APPLICATION

794
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,573
No, I can't.

795
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:20,950
I would be outright lying.

796
01:00:21,034 --> 01:00:22,869
Only scammers would do that.

797
01:00:23,828 --> 01:00:25,121
Jeez.

798
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:43,931
Da-rim.

799
01:01:09,582 --> 01:01:10,625
Dad.

800
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:13,002
I know this is wrong.

801
01:01:14,212 --> 01:01:16,673
But I have Mom's medical bills to pay,

802
01:01:16,756 --> 01:01:18,216
and if I can't make the interest payments,

803
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:20,385
we'll be out on the street,
so what can I do?

804
01:01:21,260 --> 01:01:24,180
I honestly don't think
I have any other choice left.

805
01:01:24,263 --> 01:01:25,723
So please…

806
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:31,354
Please just let it slide this one time,
so I can protect our family.

807
01:01:31,437 --> 01:01:32,313
Okay?

808
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:35,149
Forgive me.

809
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:40,780
Just look away.

810
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,787

813
01:01:56,754 --> 01:02:00,883
At 30, the only experience she has
is being born and giving birth.

814
01:02:02,844 --> 01:02:03,720
She's perfect.

815
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:08,224
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

816
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:11,811
You wanted to see me?

817
01:02:13,604 --> 01:02:15,106
Welcome to the company.

818
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,774
It feels so reassuring to have you here.

819
01:02:16,858 --> 01:02:17,942
You shouldn't.

820
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,446
I have neither interest
nor knowledge of baby products.

821
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,532
Is there anything you want to do?
Any specific team you want to join?

822
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:27,827
No, just put me on the most lax team
with the least amount of responsibilities.

823
01:02:27,910 --> 01:02:29,454
I can't do that.

824
01:02:29,537 --> 01:02:30,705
I can't waste such talent.

825
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:35,752
Actually, there's this task force team
we've been working on for a while now.

826
01:02:35,835 --> 01:02:37,378
-A TF team?
-Yeah.

827
01:02:37,462 --> 01:02:39,797
We're planning to put together
a team of moms.

828
01:02:39,881 --> 01:02:42,091
They'll be involved in everything,
including marketing, customer service,

829
01:02:42,175 --> 01:02:44,260
and even product development,
with input based on

830
01:02:44,343 --> 01:02:45,303
their real-life experiences.

831
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:46,804
An ombudsman team, if you will.

832
01:02:49,807 --> 01:02:50,808
Why should I lead that team?

833
01:02:50,892 --> 01:02:51,976
Well,

834
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:53,770
the government is also promoting

835
01:02:53,853 --> 01:02:55,938
employment support programs
for women with career breaks.

836
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,025
It'll receive attention
both internally and externally.

837
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,611
Do you want to take a look at the resumes?

838
01:03:03,362 --> 01:03:04,697
It's the list of final candidates.

840
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:35,102
Forget it.

841
01:03:35,186 --> 01:03:37,313
You can hire whoever you want.

842
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:38,231
I'm off.

843
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:41,275
What are you talking about?
You'll be leading this team.

844
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:43,611
Make sure to be at the interview tomorrow.

NEW MOTHER TF TEAM RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

846
01:03:49,867 --> 01:03:52,119
Hello, I'm here to interview
for the Mother TF Team.

847
01:03:52,203 --> 01:03:54,664
I'm a mother of two sons and one daughter.

848
01:03:54,747 --> 01:03:58,042
The first part-time job I had
when I turned 20 years old

849
01:03:58,125 --> 01:04:00,628
was at a children's playroom
called Playground.

850
01:04:00,711 --> 01:04:03,464
I believe there's nothing more important
than experience.

851
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:06,759
With my experience
using countless baby products,

852
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:10,054
I hope to create a product
that will also benefit Natural BeBe.

853
01:04:10,137 --> 01:04:13,015
Natural products for all mothers,
Natural BeBe.

854
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:14,308
I look forward to working with you.

855
01:04:14,392 --> 01:04:15,643
-Thank you.
-I look forward to working with you.

856
01:04:15,726 --> 01:04:16,853
I look forward to working with you.

857

Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

864
01:05:43,356 --> 01:05:48,277
DYNAMITE KISS

865
01:06:08,381 --> 01:06:10,508
Why is that man here?

866
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:13,344
Why did you tell me
you didn't have a boyfriend?

867
01:06:13,427 --> 01:06:14,595
I don't have a boyfriend.

868
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,555
I have a husband.

869
01:06:16,639 --> 01:06:19,016
I'm done with your nonsense. Get lost.

870
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:20,685
I refuse to get lost!

871
01:06:20,768 --> 01:06:22,353
-You refuse?
-I won't get lost.

872
01:06:22,436 --> 01:06:23,479
Have you lost your mind?

873
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:25,314
Just pretend to be my husband
for six months.

874
01:06:25,398 --> 01:06:28,818
Eat, hang out, relax, kill time,
or whatever for the next six months.

875
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:32,113
However, just make sure not to bother me.

876
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,781
You think I'll quit over this?

877
01:06:33,864 --> 01:06:36,701
Let's see who wins.

878
01:06:36,784 --> 01:06:38,494
There's nothing more to discuss.
Hand in your resignation.

879
01:06:38,577 --> 01:06:39,996
You can leave.

880
01:06:40,079 --> 01:06:41,789
I'm not some brat
born into cushy privilege

881
01:06:41,872 --> 01:06:43,582
who never worries about making ends meet.

882
01:06:44,083 --> 01:06:45,626
Is that so? Then I'll leave.
