00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:53,344
EPISODE 3

3
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:56,431
2025 NATURAL BEBE
NEW MOTHER TF TEAM RECRUITMENT INTERVIEW

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,102
RESUME

5
00:01:01,186 --> 00:01:03,146
While raising my child, I felt…

6
00:01:05,356 --> 00:01:07,150
-I'm Park Seul-gi, a young mom.
-My family…

7
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,780
GOOD LUCK, MOM

8
00:01:13,990 --> 00:01:18,411
I think I will excel
in new product development…

9
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,539
Applicant 50, Ms. Kang Hui-ja,
we're ready for you.

10
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,471
A crappy school only churns out
more crappy results.

11
00:01:36,554 --> 00:01:38,681
It seems you gained a bit of weight.
You could use some upkeep.

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,434
Kids like her
who grow up in unstable homes

13
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:43,019
always end up getting into trouble.

14
00:02:04,666 --> 00:02:05,834
Da-rim.

15
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,962
Sorry.

16
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,677
I believe work is like that too.

17
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:18,972
If you just push through
and charge ahead, one day,

18
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:20,306
you become strong.

19
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:23,643
Right. It took me so much to get here.

20
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,980
Go Da-rim, it's time for you to be strong.

21
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:29,190
Applicant 51, Ms. Go Da-rim.

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:31,401
We're ready for you.

23
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,904
Yes, I'm coming.

24
00:02:44,372 --> 00:02:47,375
Hello. My name is Go Da-rim.

25
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,886
INTERVIEWER

26
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,470
Mr. Gong went to the restroom.

27
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,555
Should I go get him?

28
00:03:03,474 --> 00:03:04,809
We can proceed without him.

29
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:07,729
-Ms. Go Da-rim?
-Yes?

30
00:03:07,812 --> 00:03:08,730
Please take a seat.

31
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:09,814
Yes, ma'am.

32
00:03:11,065 --> 00:03:12,609
Ji-hyeok!

33
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,821
The interviews aren't done yet.
You can't leave already.

34
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:18,948
Just let them hire whoever.

35
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:20,450
They're all pathetic and hopeless.

36
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:22,619
Picking one's poison is no easy feat.

37
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:25,830
That's more reason for you to screen
to find the best candidates.

38
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,416
The chairman's got his eye
on the Mother TF Team.

39
00:03:28,499 --> 00:03:29,709
That's no TF team.

40
00:03:30,293 --> 00:03:32,754
It's just a fancy title
for intern training.

41
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:35,798
It'll be gone in six months anyway.

42
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,508
We'll also make our exit around then,

43
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,927
so no need to fuss over it.

44
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:40,511
Take it easy.

45
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,263
I'm off.

46
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:49,437
Nice to meet you.

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:50,688
Hello.

48
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:52,982
Does this university really exist?

49
00:03:54,692 --> 00:03:55,652
Don't be intimidated.

50
00:03:55,735 --> 00:03:57,278
You can't lose your footing
from the start.

51
00:03:58,488 --> 00:03:59,447
I know, right?

52
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,367
I also discovered it while looking
for schools based on my scores,

53
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,410
but I still studied hard while attending,

54
00:04:04,494 --> 00:04:06,496
received a scholarship for all four years,

55
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,622
and was a department rep.

56
00:04:07,705 --> 00:04:09,499
Better be the head of a dog

57
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:11,042
than the tail of a lion, huh?

58
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,418
Right? The head of a dog?

59
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:14,587
Pull yourself together.

60
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:15,838
Remain positive.

61
00:04:15,922 --> 00:04:17,257
That's right. The head of a dog.

62
00:04:23,846 --> 00:04:25,098
I see.

63
00:04:25,181 --> 00:04:28,184
But you don't have
any other experiences after university.

64
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:29,769
Basically, a blank piece of paper.

65
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:35,024
That's exactly the reason
why you should hire me.

66
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:37,402
You're right. I'm a blank piece of paper.

67
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:38,987
Without any prior work experience,

68
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,823
I bring no biases and no skill set.

69
00:04:41,906 --> 00:04:43,241
If you hire me,

70
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,910
I, Go Da-rim, will become the empty canvas

71
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:50,790
on which Natural BeBe
can draw whatever they wish.

72
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:52,125
Everyone,

73
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:55,003
feel free to draw on me
to your heart's content.

74
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:00,883
We have a complete freak on our hands.

75
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,302
Thank you for your time.

76
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:03,886
Thank you.

77
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:07,932
Overzealous with nothing to back it up.

78
00:05:08,599 --> 00:05:09,475
Perfect.

79
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:11,436
INTERVIEWER: GONG JI-HYE
RESULT: PASS

80
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:32,415
Easy, easy. Calm down.

81
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:35,626
-What do you want?
-Not you. Your muscles.

82
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,795
They're so worked up

83
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:40,173
that all the women here
are only staring at you.

84
00:05:40,256 --> 00:05:41,841
I'm not in the mood to joke around.

85
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,134
I wasn't joking around.

86
00:05:43,217 --> 00:05:45,011
I don't like other women
staring at my man.

87
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:48,765
I heard you settled it with your father.

88
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,434
How could you not reach out to me?

89
00:05:51,517 --> 00:05:53,686
These chaebol children
and their lack of manners.

90
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:55,063
It's such an issue.

91
00:05:55,897 --> 00:05:58,441
Let's talk.

92
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,323
Sure, we'll get married.

93
00:06:05,406 --> 00:06:07,867
But there's something
you need to know before we do.

94
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,497
Including me, everyone pushing
for this marriage has their own goal,

95
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,123
but none of those goals

96
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:16,209
include love.

97
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,836
It won't be the married life
you've been dreaming about.

98
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,797
I'm sorry, but for me,

99
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,633
this is just going to be a mating retreat.

100
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,052
You shouldn't dismiss mating retreats.

101
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,097
During a middle school class trip,

102
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,973
I ended up dating the one
I was paired with.

103
00:06:31,057 --> 00:06:34,727
Sometimes, physical proximity
leads to emotional connection.

104
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,146
You've never experienced it?

105
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:39,690
What?

106
00:06:44,362 --> 00:06:46,489
Should we do that again?

107
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,615
Sorry?

108
00:06:47,698 --> 00:06:49,492
Let's do that again.

109
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:04,465
Not to mention, I'm being paired up
with the man I already called dibs on.

110
00:07:04,549 --> 00:07:05,508
I'll gladly accept.

111
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:07,885
You say that like it's nothing.

112
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:10,429
Do you even know me that well?

113
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:14,142
I've dated my fair share of guys from
the most prestigious families in Korea.

114
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,521
Right off the bat, it's a barrage of brags
about money, stocks, and connections.

115
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:19,939
They're all so boring.

116
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,108
But Gong Ji-hyeok is a bit different.

117
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:25,153
His eyes light up
when he pursues his path.

118
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,697
So sexy.

119
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,741
That…

120
00:07:32,243 --> 00:07:33,369
Never mind. Forget it.

121
00:07:44,672 --> 00:07:45,673
What are you doing here?

122
00:07:46,215 --> 00:07:47,175
Hey.

123
00:07:47,758 --> 00:07:48,801
The announcement is today.

124
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:50,928
Seeing that they haven't called me yet,

125
00:07:51,596 --> 00:07:52,722
I probably didn't get it, right?

126
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:55,433
You don't know that.
Just have some patience.

127
00:07:57,226 --> 00:07:59,645
I bombed that interview.

128
00:07:59,729 --> 00:08:01,647
I think I went overboard
and overcompensated.

129
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:07,653
Hey, Da-rim.

130
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:08,779
Yeah?

131
00:08:09,447 --> 00:08:10,323
Do you remember?

132
00:08:11,616 --> 00:08:12,450
Remember what?

133
00:08:13,367 --> 00:08:16,996
When the big guys at our school
would tease me about not having a mom,

134
00:08:17,538 --> 00:08:19,665
you'd fight them on my behalf
and console me.

135
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:21,834
What about it?

136
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:24,003
Back then, I couldn't even think
about fighting back

137
00:08:24,086 --> 00:08:26,422
because I was terrified
about how big they were,

138
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:28,716
but you never gave in.

139
00:08:28,799 --> 00:08:30,092
You fought them until the end.

140
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:34,013
Did I?

141
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:34,931
You did.

142
00:08:35,014 --> 00:08:36,641
To me…

143
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,061
you're awesome.

144
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,234
Well, I know you might have
your moments of being a loser,

145
00:08:46,734 --> 00:08:49,904
but I also know you'll go back
to being awesome in no time.

146
00:08:53,324 --> 00:08:54,450
What's wrong with you?

147
00:08:55,076 --> 00:08:55,910
All right.

148
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:58,871
Let's go now.
I'll make you something tasty.

149
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:02,667
Thanks.

150
00:09:05,795 --> 00:09:06,712
Hello?

151
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,758
Yes, I'm Go Da-rim.

152
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,763
Yes, I understand.

153
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:17,390
Thank you so much.

154
00:09:17,473 --> 00:09:18,432
Thank you!

155
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,561
-What happened?
-Seon-u!

156
00:09:21,644 --> 00:09:23,688
I got the job!

157
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:28,317
This is unbelievable!

158
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:02,852
You scared me.

159
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:04,270
Sorry.

160
00:10:05,104 --> 00:10:06,689
What are you doing here?

161
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,482
Didn't you say
today was your first day at work?

162
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,945
You told me it was your dream to see me
get a job and go to work in the morning.

163
00:10:13,029 --> 00:10:14,196
That's why I'm here.

164
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,823
Here. Take it all in.

165
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:21,245
Hello. I'm Go Da-rim, the new hire.

166
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,457
Don't fool around.

167
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,501
Be sure to listen
to your senior colleagues.

168
00:10:27,585 --> 00:10:29,629
Do everything with integrity.

169
00:10:30,463 --> 00:10:31,380
Got it?

170
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,383
With integrity…

171
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:37,053
Of course, I will.

172
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,889
You probably skipped breakfast.

173
00:10:40,431 --> 00:10:41,515
Hold on.

174
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,729
At least have some of this on your way.

175
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,981
You need a full stomach to work.

176
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,404
Mom.

177
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:59,825
I'll do whatever I must
to get through this six-month internship

178
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,244
and secure a full-time position.

179
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,080
Just wait and see. Okay?

180
00:11:04,163 --> 00:11:05,539
You're going to do great.

181
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,586
Wait, what time does work start?

182
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,921
Oh, right.

183
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,673
-Don't forget this.
-Okay. I need to get going.

184
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,092
-Chew thoroughly when you eat.
-Okay.

185
00:11:16,175 --> 00:11:18,719
-All right, Mom. I'll call you.
-Okay. Go.

186
00:11:18,803 --> 00:11:20,054
-Go.
-I'm going.

187
00:11:23,474 --> 00:11:24,350
Go Da-rim.

188
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:27,770
Starting today, you're a married woman.

189
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:31,273
You have a husband and a 6-year-old kid.

190
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,734
You must never forget that

191
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:35,277
under any circumstances.

192
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,663
You can do this.

193
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:51,836
I'm not just saying this
because he's my son,

194
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,296
but he's exceptionally bright,
so I'm sure he'll be an asset.

195
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:56,715
Please help him out.

196
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:57,633
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

197
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,769
You all skipped breakfast, right?
Here, have some.

198
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,521
Ta-da!

199
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,150
I steamed glutinous rice cakes
and sweet potatoes.

200
00:12:14,692 --> 00:12:15,526
Here.

201
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:17,862
Thank you.

202
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:18,946
You're welcome.

203
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,700
What's that smell?

204
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:23,742
Oh no, my radish water kimchi.

205
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:26,412
I told that damn man to screw it on tight.

206
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:27,455
-He's so useless.
-Here, take this.

207
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,789
I'm so sick of him.

208
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:31,917
I'm talking about the man I live with.

209
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:34,670
But are we allowed to eat
stuff like this in the office?

210
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,131
Why not? Everyone eats and poops.

211
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,009
I guess you're right.

212
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:41,010
Oh my.

213
00:12:42,011 --> 00:12:43,220
What is that?

214
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:48,017
This is unbelievable.

215
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:50,436
I absolutely love sweet potatoes.

216
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,605
My goodness. Did you bring these?

217
00:12:52,688 --> 00:12:54,231
Try some. They're out of this world.

218
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,942
Oh my, golden sweet potatoes!

219
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:00,154
You have to try some.

220
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:03,282
You two must be friends.

221
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,366
-No, we've just met.
-No, we've just met.

222
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:05,367
What?

223
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:07,912
Who cares?

224
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,163
But you're my type of girl.

225
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:10,331
-So are you.
-Listen up.

226
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,335
Everyone, the director
and the new team leader…

227
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,420
What's that smell?

228
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:18,422
Did someone make kimchi in the office?

229
00:13:18,506 --> 00:13:20,508
There's no kimchi, but we have something
that goes perfectly with it.

230
00:13:20,591 --> 00:13:23,511
Golden sweet potatoes.

231
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:35,481
Here they come.

232
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:37,358
Say hello.

233
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:39,485
-Hello.
-Hello.

234
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:19,692
Now,

235
00:14:19,775 --> 00:14:22,403
let me introduce
the leader of the Mother TF Team.

236
00:14:22,486 --> 00:14:24,029
Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

237
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:25,823
Team leader?

238
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:29,952
This is a TF team comprised of mothers
with children under 6 years old.

239
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:30,953
"Mothers"?

240
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:41,005
The Mother TF Team was created
under special orders from the chairman

241
00:14:41,088 --> 00:14:42,172
with high expectations.

242
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:43,883
After six months,

243
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:46,051
we're looking to offer permanent positions
based on achievement.

244
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,970
So please, give it your all.

245
00:14:48,053 --> 00:14:50,139
-Of course!
-I look forward to working with you.

246
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,307
I'll do my very best.

247
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:54,810
Mr. Gong,
would you like to say a few words?

248
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:03,360
Mr. Gong, please say a few words
to the team.

249
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,278
Right.

250
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:11,869
So, are you saying
everyone here is married

251
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:14,496
with a kid at home?

252
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:17,666
Every single one of you?

253
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,543
Yes, that was a job requirement.

254
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:23,589
I'm sure at first glance,
we may all look like single young ladies.

255
00:15:23,672 --> 00:15:27,134
But surprisingly enough,
we are indeed all mothers with children.

256
00:15:27,885 --> 00:15:29,511
I actually have three kids.

257
00:15:30,846 --> 00:15:31,764
You there.

258
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:33,557
What about you?

259
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,059
Me?

260
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:37,102
I…

261
00:15:48,697 --> 00:15:50,074
Of course, I do.

262
00:15:50,157 --> 00:15:52,826
I have a child.

263
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,372
I see.

264
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:13,514
It appears Mr. Gong
is in quite a jovial mood today.

265
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,228
Mr. Ma, I believe we have
welcome gifts for the new hires.

266
00:16:19,311 --> 00:16:20,562
-Grab them from the general affairs team.
-Yes, ma'am.

267
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:21,730
No!

268
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:24,191
I can go and get them.

269
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,448
What's going on?

270
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:33,993
Why is that man here?

271
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,954
He said he was a consultant
with his own business!

272
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,748
This is just driving me crazy!

273
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:57,057
Your husband is the same age as you,

274
00:16:58,851 --> 00:17:00,019
and your son is 6.

275
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,397
You wrote on your application
in great detail

276
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:06,567
that you wish to utilize
your motherhood know-how

277
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:09,111
to realize your once forgotten potential.

278
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:10,070
Is that correct?

279
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:12,698
-I'm sorry.
-"Sorry"?

280
00:17:14,742 --> 00:17:15,826
You're sorry?

281
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,333
I'm beyond speechless.

282
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,715
Tell me.

283
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,385
Why did you tell me
you didn't have a boyfriend?

284
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,512
What? When did I…

285
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,597
Yeah, I lost my mind.

286
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:37,848
That's not all.

287
00:17:37,931 --> 00:17:40,601
I also have no money,
no boyfriend, and no dad.

288
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:41,602
So what?

289
00:17:42,603 --> 00:17:45,647
Technically, I don't have a boyfriend.

290
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,483
I have a husband.

291
00:17:47,566 --> 00:17:48,567
You can't be serious.

292
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:54,990
What's your deal?

293
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,326
You have a kid and a husband,
and you kissed…

294
00:18:00,204 --> 00:18:01,371
Okay.

295
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:02,456
Okay!

296
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:03,874
Putting that aside,

297
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,210
why did you agree to our date?

298
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,379
That day, we almost…

299
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:11,590
We almost…

300
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:15,594
What were you even thinking?

301
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,055
You see, the thing is…

302
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,974
After a fight with my husband,

303
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:22,684
I went to Jeju in a fit of rage.

304
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:25,145
It had been a while
since I'd gone on a trip without my kid,

305
00:18:25,229 --> 00:18:26,146
so I got excited.

306
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:27,314
And before I knew it,

307
00:18:27,397 --> 00:18:31,068
I had been swept up
by the thrill of the moment, and…

308
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,572
If I'm being honest,
I've been a hermit for the last few years.

309
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,408
Family issues basically pushed me
into taking this trip as well.

310
00:18:39,118 --> 00:18:40,744
So, the "family issues" you mentioned

311
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,664
were marital quarrels?

312
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,500
And you were a "hermit"

313
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:48,168
because of child rearing?

314
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,086
Yes, that's right.

315
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:52,798
I must've suffered
some sort of temporary insanity in Jeju.

316
00:18:52,881 --> 00:18:54,424
I see.

317
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,386
So that's why you ran away.

318
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:00,305
I guess the bed felt too real, huh?

319
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,183
Was that it? Was it?

320
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:06,395
Who are you people?

321
00:19:06,478 --> 00:19:08,063
You can't just come up here.

322
00:19:08,147 --> 00:19:08,981
Go downstairs now.

323
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:10,607
Okay. Sorry!

324
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:13,026
He's telling us to go down.

325
00:19:19,366 --> 00:19:20,742
Are you sure about these?

326
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,495
Has my discerning eye ever led you astray?

327
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:26,915
Just wait a year.
They'll be worth ten times as much.

328
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,001
Hello, Father.

329
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,544
Why are you so busy?

330
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,545
I apologize.

331
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,463
I was at a meeting
for my upcoming photography exhibit--

332
00:19:33,547 --> 00:19:35,174
Will that make any money?

333
00:19:37,176 --> 00:19:39,219
It'll be a warm invitation
to the general public--

334
00:19:39,303 --> 00:19:41,180
Why invite them in?

335
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:44,474
Is this some neighborhood corner shop
open to anyone and everyone?

336
00:19:45,475 --> 00:19:48,187
Just behave yourself and get married.

337
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:08,123
So far, Kim Seon-u's work
seems to have the most mass appeal.

338
00:20:08,207 --> 00:20:09,291
Is he still unreachable?

339
00:20:09,374 --> 00:20:11,752
We actually managed to reach him
this morning.

340
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,212
What did he say?

341
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,088
He turned us down without hesitation.

342
00:20:15,672 --> 00:20:18,592
He's busy running his baby studio
and isn't interested in creative work.

343
00:20:25,515 --> 00:20:26,808
Send me his address.

344
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:28,310
Sure.

345
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:33,065
There.

346
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:35,192
Oh my.

347
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:38,445
Now it really feels like I'm working here.

348
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,155
Oh no. Jin-hui, are you crying?

349
00:20:40,239 --> 00:20:43,909
After just being referred to
as "Eun-sang's mom" for so long,

350
00:20:43,992 --> 00:20:46,912
seeing my name "Jang Jin-hui"
just makes me…

351
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,831
I'm getting emotional
seeing it printed like this.

352
00:20:49,915 --> 00:20:51,333
Right, Da-rim?

353
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:54,211
See? This just proves my point.

354
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:56,630
She has completely forgotten her own name.

355
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,674
-Ms. Go Da-rim.
-Yes?

356
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,841
What did you say?

357
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:01,843
We were talking about
how our IDs make us feel.

358
00:21:01,927 --> 00:21:02,803
Right.

359
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,390
I'm happy, very happy.

360
00:21:07,891 --> 00:21:10,352
I can't even describe
how desperately I wanted this.

361
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:14,273
Should we take a picture to commemorate
the reclaiming of our names?

362
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:15,274
That's a great idea.

363
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:16,900
-I'll take it for you.
-Yes, please.

364
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:19,152
Thank you very much, Mr. Kang.

365
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,321
One, two, three.

366
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:23,615
One more.

367
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,826
Mr. Gong!

368
00:21:26,410 --> 00:21:28,120
Goodness, Mr. Gong!

369
00:21:28,203 --> 00:21:30,914
We're taking pictures. You should join us.

370
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:32,416
-Come on, let's take one together.
-Please?

371
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:33,959
Come on. Please.

372
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,260
Forget pictures.

373
00:21:44,678 --> 00:21:46,179
Let me say this as the team leader.

374
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,391
I conducted a complete assessment

375
00:21:49,474 --> 00:21:52,477
of your abilities
through your resumes and interviews.

376
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,854
That's to say,

377
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:58,025
I don't expect a single thing
from any of you.

378
00:22:00,902 --> 00:22:04,114
Eat, hang out, relax, kill time,
or whatever for the next six months.

379
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:05,991
However,

380
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,617
just make sure

381
00:22:09,244 --> 00:22:10,579
not to

382
00:22:11,913 --> 00:22:12,748
bother me.

383
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:14,791
That's all.

384
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:19,504
Excuse me.

385
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,135
What's wrong with him?
Is he having a bad day?

386
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,386
Why complain?

387
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:28,096
We can do anything we want.

388
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,057
Isn't this great news for us?

389
00:22:30,140 --> 00:22:31,141
No.

390
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,267
What's gotten into him?

391
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,105
JUN BABY STUDIO

392
00:22:41,693 --> 00:22:42,569
Is this it?

393
00:22:42,652 --> 00:22:45,697
All right, look over here.

394
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,365
That's it.

395
00:22:48,366 --> 00:22:49,826
That's nice.

396
00:22:50,744 --> 00:22:52,704
Look over here.

397
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,415
You're doing great.

398
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,668
My goodness, you look like a prince.

399
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,253
Over here, Jae-hui.

400
00:23:03,757 --> 00:23:05,133
All right, Jae-hui.

401
00:23:05,217 --> 00:23:07,135
Should we play with the dinosaur now?

402
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,179
Roar for me like this. Can you do that?

403
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:11,598
Okay, here comes the dinosaur.

404
00:23:11,681 --> 00:23:13,767
Here it comes.

405
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:17,938
Maybe something like this?

406
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:18,855
Or…

407
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:20,565
Like this?

408
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,343
Can I help you?

409
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:50,345
I'm Deputy Director Yu Ha-yeong
of Taeyu Art Hall.

410
00:23:52,764 --> 00:23:53,974
Why don't we talk inside?

411
00:23:54,558 --> 00:23:56,017
No, please sit.

412
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:57,102
The weather's nice.

413
00:23:58,645 --> 00:23:59,729
You must've waited long.

414
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:01,606
Well, I showed up unannounced.

415
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:04,317
And I wasn't bored at all.

416
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:06,236
I was busy watching you.

417
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,946
-Pardon?
-Earlier, you were like…

418
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,034
-What brings you here today?
-Oh, right.

419
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,537
Well…

420
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,833
I'm here because of this piece.

421
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:22,335
She looks so happy.

422
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:24,087
I grew envious of her,

423
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:27,299
and I grew really curious
about the photographer behind the camera.

424
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:30,552
But I figured it out as soon as I saw you.

425
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:32,846
This is your girlfriend, right?

426
00:24:33,847 --> 00:24:37,767
You can tell by her eyes
that she's obviously very loved.

427
00:24:37,851 --> 00:24:40,854
I'd like to feature this as the main piece
of our upcoming exhibition.

428
00:24:40,937 --> 00:24:43,148
-I'm not interested.
-Why not?

429
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:45,233
Did you two break up?

430
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,236
Don't worry about that.

431
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:49,696
We'll take care of everything.

432
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:52,157
We'll reach out to your ex
and get her permission.

433
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,950
-If you just give me her number--
-No.

434
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:57,204
You can't get her permission,
and I don't know her number either.

435
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,914
It sounds like it was a bad breakup.

436
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,582
Why? What was it?

437
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:03,376
Tell me. What happened?

438
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:08,757
All right.

439
00:25:09,466 --> 00:25:12,427
Then, do you have any other pieces
besides this one?

440
00:25:12,510 --> 00:25:13,345
I don't.

441
00:25:14,304 --> 00:25:17,098
As you can see, I'm busy making a living.

442
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:19,184
I'm sorry to say this
when you came all this way.

443
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:24,481
I'm certain this will be
a great opportunity for you--

444
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:25,565
I have somewhere to be.

445
00:25:27,525 --> 00:25:28,443
Okay.

446
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:31,488
Wait, hold on.

447
00:25:32,989 --> 00:25:35,659
If, by any chance,
you change your mind, call me.

448
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:40,372
The one thing I can guarantee
is that we'll treat you

449
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,041
with the utmost respect and courtesy
as an artist.

450
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:48,755
Oh my.

451
00:25:48,838 --> 00:25:51,132
Tapping this is pretty fun.

452
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,467
Do you smell the air of freedom?

453
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,094
Clocking out for the day feels nice,
doesn't it?

454
00:25:54,177 --> 00:25:57,180
What's there to be happy about?
We clock out here and clock in at home.

455
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:58,723
I'm already tired.

456
00:25:58,807 --> 00:25:59,766
Don't you agree?

457
00:26:00,308 --> 00:26:01,268
Pardon?

458
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,478
Are you okay?

459
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:08,191
Just thinking about cleaning
and making dinner has her out of it.

460
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,359
You're totally right!

461
00:26:10,193 --> 00:26:11,278
Pull yourself together.

462
00:26:11,903 --> 00:26:13,613
Right. You're so right.

463
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,116
I have to go this way.

464
00:26:16,199 --> 00:26:17,993
-I'll say goodbye here. See you tomorrow.
-All right.

465
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,036
-Okay. Good work today.
-Bye.

466
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:20,954
See you tomorrow.

467
00:26:21,037 --> 00:26:22,414
What are you making for dinner?

468
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,250
Whatever we have in the house.

469
00:26:39,681 --> 00:26:41,224
I sincerely apologize.

470
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:43,601
You can curse me out, and I won't refute.

471
00:26:45,186 --> 00:26:46,771
Listen.

472
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,316
I know this sounds shameless,

473
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,568
but could you possibly keep

474
00:26:52,235 --> 00:26:54,988
what happened in Jeju a secret?

475
00:26:55,071 --> 00:26:56,740
That's a given.

476
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:58,908
That's a relief.

477
00:26:58,992 --> 00:27:00,118
Thank you so much.

478
00:27:00,201 --> 00:27:02,287
I was terrified the whole day
for no reason, and--

479
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:04,456
Because you'll quit tomorrow.

480
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,416
Sorry?

481
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:07,417
Do you expect me

482
00:27:08,043 --> 00:27:11,046
to work with someone
who has deceived and manipulated me?

483
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:15,300
You must take responsibility
for your actions.

484
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,431
There's nothing more to discuss.
Hand in your resignation.

485
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:23,558
By tomorrow morning.

486
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:28,813
Mr. Gong!

487
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,190
Hold on, Mr. Gong.

488
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:32,275
Wait. Just a second.

489
00:27:32,942 --> 00:27:35,403
Sorry about that.

490
00:27:36,696 --> 00:27:39,366
I completely understand that you're mad,

491
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:41,117
but I can't resign.

492
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:45,288
I'm in a situation
where I need to make money.

493
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,752
You do whatever you want…

494
00:27:52,837 --> 00:27:54,089
and ask for my understanding?

495
00:27:55,298 --> 00:27:56,132
Does that make sense?

496
00:27:58,009 --> 00:27:59,386
Do you know how worried I was?

497
00:28:05,058 --> 00:28:06,684
I didn't know if you were being chased

498
00:28:07,352 --> 00:28:08,686
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

499
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,273
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

500
00:28:14,275 --> 00:28:15,860
You searched?

501
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:17,237
For me?

502
00:28:23,118 --> 00:28:25,787
Forget all that.
Just hand in your resignation by tomorrow.

503
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:54,983
This is a TF team comprised of mothers
with children under 6 years old.

504
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:57,485
So, are you saying
everyone here is married

505
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,696
with a kid at home?

506
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,031
Of course, I do. I have a child.

507
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,669
Jeez, you're sighing
like the world is ending.

508
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:18,339
Who drinks alone
to celebrate their first day of work?

509
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
How did you know to come here?

510
00:29:20,884 --> 00:29:24,471
I just had a feeling you'd be here.

511
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,347
-Here you go.
-Hello.

512
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,975
You seemed down all day at work.

513
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:30,769
Did something happen?

514
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:34,189
Look at you.

515
00:29:34,773 --> 00:29:36,357
I guess something did happen.

516
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:39,235
You know,

517
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:41,404
the woman from Jeju Island?

518
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,031
Oh, your dynamite kiss?

519
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:44,616
Did you find her?

520
00:29:45,283 --> 00:29:46,659
It turns out she's married.

521
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,994
What?

522
00:29:49,370 --> 00:29:50,497
She's married?

523
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,916
She also has a son.

524
00:29:53,666 --> 00:29:55,084
A son?

525
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,669
That's insane.

526
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,921
What kind of woman does that?

527
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:05,804
Ji-hyeok, just drink this
and forget about the whole thing.

528
00:30:10,517 --> 00:30:11,392
I should.

529
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:19,400
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

530
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:23,029
Do you know how worried I was?

531
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:24,823
I didn't know if you were being chased

532
00:30:25,698 --> 00:30:27,033
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

533
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,912
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

534
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:36,751
I was the one who messed up
in the first place.

535
00:30:38,586 --> 00:30:40,004
I just got punished, that's all.

536
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:52,809
At least have some of this on your way.

537
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,271
You need a full stomach to work.

538
00:30:58,606 --> 00:30:59,732
Mom…

539
00:31:05,572 --> 00:31:06,406
Yeah.

540
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,783
I need to think about my mom first.

541
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,786
Embarrassment? Awkwardness?

542
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,204
Who cares about any of that?

543
00:31:14,664 --> 00:31:15,957
I can endure it all.

544
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,805
My goodness! You're here, Mr. Gong!

545
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:32,891
-Good morning, Mr. Gong.
-Hello.

546
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,064
He's saying hi to just one person.

547
00:31:40,148 --> 00:31:41,649
Let's get back to work.

548
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:45,737
Ms. Go Da-rim.

549
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,197
Bring what we discussed yesterday
to my office.

550
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:56,539
For your morning coffee,

551
00:31:56,623 --> 00:31:58,833
I prepared an iced Americano.

552
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:01,294
I don't believe this is what I asked for.

553
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:03,379
Plan A.

554
00:32:04,714 --> 00:32:07,342
Mr. Gong, I beg you.

555
00:32:07,842 --> 00:32:10,803
Please allow me to work here.

556
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,513
I have nowhere else to go,

557
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,098
and I worked hard to get in here.

558
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:17,936
Could you possibly
just let it all slide this one time?

559
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,021
Are you kidding me right now?

560
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,814
What I mean is…

561
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:25,777
We should separate
our professional and personal lives.

562
00:32:28,112 --> 00:32:29,322
Let's be honest.

563
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,783
We weren't anything serious anyway.

564
00:32:31,866 --> 00:32:35,119
Anyone could make such a mistake
as they make their way through life.

565
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,207
Let's just consider it a sort of accident,

566
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:41,250
shake it off, and forget about it.

567
00:32:41,334 --> 00:32:42,293
What do you say?

568
00:32:44,087 --> 00:32:45,254
"A mistake."

569
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,673
"A sort of accident."

570
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:47,840
Yes.

571
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,385
"Just shake it off and forget it"?

572
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:56,933
I guess things in life
are always that easy for you.

573
00:32:58,935 --> 00:33:00,186
How commendable.

574
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:04,315
It's not working.

575
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,151
All right, Plan B.

576
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:10,363
Oh my. Then, by any chance,

577
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:13,449
are you doing this
because our kiss was so unforgettable?

578
00:33:16,786 --> 00:33:17,620
What did you say?

579
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:19,664
You are. I'm right. That's it.

580
00:33:19,747 --> 00:33:22,875
I totally understand.
It's completely understandable.

581
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:25,962
You see, I have a bit of expertise
when it comes to kissing.

582
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,589
I unintentionally encounter
such predicaments on occasion.

583
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,591
Have you lost your mind?

584
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,552
Are you on something?

585
00:33:33,553 --> 00:33:34,554
Is that it?

586
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,389
If it's not that…

587
00:33:38,224 --> 00:33:40,059
I know it's difficult,
but please let it go.

588
00:33:40,935 --> 00:33:43,187
In turn, I'll work really hard.

589
00:33:43,271 --> 00:33:46,024
I'll do whatever you say
as long as it's not a resignation.

590
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:46,941
I swear.

591
00:33:48,317 --> 00:33:50,069
-I…
-Yes?

592
00:33:51,654 --> 00:33:53,698
-I…
-Yes?

593
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,703
I find your very existence uncomfortable.

594
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:04,459
I'm done with your nonsense.

595
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,296
Get lost.

596
00:34:13,801 --> 00:34:15,219
I refuse to get lost!

597
00:34:17,221 --> 00:34:19,265
-You refuse?
-No! I won't get lost.

598
00:34:19,348 --> 00:34:21,934
Just go ahead and fire me if you want.
But on what grounds?

599
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:24,645
"I had a mind-blowing kiss
with this woman in Jeju."

600
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:25,688
Will you cite that?

601
00:34:51,047 --> 00:34:54,717
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

602
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:12,652
This is how you're going to play it, huh?

603
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:16,948
Team Leader Kim Seung-gyu.

604
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:21,035
This is Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok
of the Mother TF Team.

605
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:21,994
Nice to meet you.

606
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:26,332
These are the new products
we thoroughly prepared for this season.

607
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:27,500
Before they're released,

608
00:35:27,583 --> 00:35:30,419
we were hoping for the Mother TF Team
to review them for us.

609
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:32,088
The products feature--

610
00:35:32,171 --> 00:35:33,506
That won't be necessary.

611
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:36,259
They'll know once they try them.

612
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,553
Pack them up. Let's go.

613
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:41,139
Mr. Gong.

614
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,056
What?

615
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:44,392
Use your words. What?

616
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:48,104
He just has a funny way with words.

617
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:50,273
Sir, the lab just reached out regarding
the bottle boiling sterilization test.

618
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:54,193
-They can't do it this week.
-Ji-hyeok, we're just getting started.

619
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:55,903
Then we'll need to find an external lab.

620
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,363
It'll require five all-nighters.

621
00:35:57,446 --> 00:35:59,490
Who would agree to that
on such short notice?

622
00:36:00,283 --> 00:36:01,117
Five all-nighters?

623
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,536
I'll do whatever you say
as long as it's not a resignation.

624
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:04,453
I swear.

625
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:09,959
Us!

626
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,131
My goodness.

627
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:17,550
We'll do it.

628
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:18,593
Pardon?

629
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:21,762
Just trust us and leave it to us.

630
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:24,390
We can do an incredible job.

631
00:36:26,475 --> 00:36:30,062
Man, Mr. Gong is quite an ambitious one.

632
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,648
The development team was in trouble,

633
00:36:32,732 --> 00:36:34,650
and he stepped forward
and said, "We'll do it!"

634
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,863
I guess he's trying to make a big impact
by doing something major.

635
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,827
Mr. Ma.

636
00:36:47,121 --> 00:36:48,414
You'll be working late tonight.

637
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,137
So you're saying

638
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,306
I need to dip baby bottles
in boiling water

639
00:37:05,389 --> 00:37:07,975
for five whole days straight?

640
00:37:08,059 --> 00:37:10,645
That's right. We're testing
to see if the bottles shrink

641
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,271
when sterilized in boiling water.

642
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:15,399
For 30 seconds, every 30 minutes.
180 times in total.

643
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:16,692
Be sure to promptly record

644
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:20,154
any changes in height,
weight, and circumference.

645
00:37:21,572 --> 00:37:24,617
But why do we need to do that out here?

646
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,494
There's no lab available at the moment.

647
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,746
And we can't just do it in any room.

648
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,582
It's a fire hazard.

649
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:33,334
Then, what about at night?

650
00:37:33,417 --> 00:37:35,670
I won't have to do it alone, right?

651
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,923
Why? You can't do it?

652
00:37:39,757 --> 00:37:43,636
Didn't you say you'd do anything
as long as it wasn't a resignation?

653
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:45,596
Right.

654
00:37:46,973 --> 00:37:49,433
That could've been a lie as well.

655
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:51,060
No, I meant that.

656
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,979
But this is a bit…

657
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,940
It's just one lie after another with you.

658
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:03,406
If you can't do it,
then just hand in your resignation

659
00:38:03,489 --> 00:38:04,782
and leave.

660
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:09,370
No, wait. I'll do it.

661
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:19,130
All this over a measly kiss.

662
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:23,718
What was that?

663
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:26,971
I mean, it's true.

664
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,725
How could a measly kiss
warrant such retaliation?

665
00:38:30,808 --> 00:38:33,936
Just think of it as having played
a few games of ping-pong with a stranger.

666
00:38:35,021 --> 00:38:36,564
-Ping-pong?
-Yeah.

667
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,899
Oh, I see.

668
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,652
If it's no big deal at all,

669
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,612
then how about
another game of ping-pong here?

670
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:45,364
Well?

671
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:46,449
Should I serve first?

672
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:48,159
That's not what I meant.

673
00:38:48,242 --> 00:38:50,202
What's the matter? It's no big deal.

674
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,330
Ping-pong.

675
00:38:52,413 --> 00:38:53,998
Ping-pong.

676
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:02,631
Does it look like I'm doing all this
because of a kiss?

677
00:39:03,632 --> 00:39:05,134
You need to get a grip,

678
00:39:05,718 --> 00:39:06,802
Jun's mom.

679
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:17,521
Please get back safely.

680
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,044
What? Ping-pong?

681
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,254
Ping-pong?

682
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:44,090
Ping-pong, my ass.

683
00:39:47,343 --> 00:39:49,970
How could she compare that to ping-pong?

684
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,654
Come on.

685
00:40:06,737 --> 00:40:08,030
You expected as much.

686
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:10,032
I should be thankful
that he's letting me stay.

687
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,701
Beggars can't be choosers.

688
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,965
24 HOURS LATER

689
00:41:18,684 --> 00:41:21,312
It's been hours. How is she still awake?

690
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:28,068
You think I'll quit over this?

691
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,405
Let's see who wins.

692
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:47,379
36 HOURS LATER

693
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,465
This is just pure torture.

694
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,134
Why the hell did I have to kiss him?

695
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:58,098
Maybe just a short nap.

696
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:16,033
TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

697
00:42:16,116 --> 00:42:19,036
COMPLETED THE 22ND CYCLE AT 0100 HOURS,
MR. GONG!

698
00:42:23,624 --> 00:42:25,334
I bet she's dozing off right now.

699
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:27,002
Go Da-rim.

700
00:42:28,128 --> 00:42:30,381
You're fired for neglect of duty.

701
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:58,784
Go Da-rim!

702
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:00,452
Come out!

703
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:08,919
Come out now!

704
00:43:42,953 --> 00:43:44,538
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

705
00:43:48,083 --> 00:43:49,293
What happened--

706
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:13,859
Thank goodness.

707
00:44:16,528 --> 00:44:19,657
Were you worried about me?

708
00:44:26,330 --> 00:44:27,748
I thought something terrible had happened!

709
00:44:29,333 --> 00:44:30,334
This…

710
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,962
It's such a hassle to deal with
a workers' compensation claim.

711
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:38,384
Right, workers' compensation claim.

712
00:44:38,467 --> 00:44:40,511
Where did you go after starting a fire?

713
00:44:40,594 --> 00:44:43,097
I stepped away for a moment
to go to the bathroom.

714
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:46,016
I didn't know either.
When did all this happen?

715
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:51,188
I can't have someone
who's so careless and reckless

716
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:54,066
on my team.

717
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:58,153
Take responsibility and leave.

718
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:05,369
That's nonsense.

719
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:08,872
Listen.

720
00:45:11,667 --> 00:45:13,919
I didn't sleep a wink
and checked for thermal shrinkage

721
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,587
every hour on the dot.

722
00:45:16,171 --> 00:45:18,590
I only went to the bathroom
because I couldn't hold it in any longer.

723
00:45:25,681 --> 00:45:27,266
You agreed to take on this task.

724
00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,519
Are you trying to brag
about carrying it out?

725
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:31,728
I am.

726
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:32,938
I did say I'd do it.

727
00:45:33,730 --> 00:45:34,773
But you know,

728
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:37,401
is it normal to assign
a task that requires

729
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,069
five all-nighters to just one person?

730
00:45:39,153 --> 00:45:41,822
Not to mention,
what was I supposed to do to prevent

731
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:43,490
the wind from blowing sparks?

732
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:45,909
I refuse to leave.

733
00:45:45,993 --> 00:45:47,953
You can leave.

734
00:45:52,708 --> 00:45:53,750
Is that so?

735
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:56,545
Then I'll leave.

736
00:46:01,008 --> 00:46:02,843
Wait, take your…

737
00:46:10,476 --> 00:46:12,352
I've already found my luck.

738
00:46:13,562 --> 00:46:14,730
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

739
00:47:34,184 --> 00:47:36,228
She was one tenacious cookie.

740
00:47:36,311 --> 00:47:37,980
She just stayed
right in front of that fire

741
00:47:38,063 --> 00:47:39,273
and carried on.

742
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:43,318
If I just had one person like that
on my marketing team, we would…

743
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,074
Did I ask you to go and assess
his team member's performance?

744
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:50,576
My apologies.

745
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,743
What about what I asked?

746
00:47:51,827 --> 00:47:52,911
Oh, about that…

747
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,670
I need to keep going.

748
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:10,304
If I put out the fire, it's over.

749
00:48:16,018 --> 00:48:18,061
Who the hell is that at this hour?

750
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:28,280
Mr. Gong just had to show up

751
00:48:28,363 --> 00:48:30,616
at that very moment.

752
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:32,909
My apologies.

753
00:48:34,536 --> 00:48:35,954
We at least confirmed one thing.

754
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:37,039
Pardon?

755
00:48:37,122 --> 00:48:38,999
He went to check on the progress
at that hour?

756
00:48:39,583 --> 00:48:40,792
Pretty ambitious, Gong Ji-hyeok.

757
00:48:43,503 --> 00:48:45,380
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

758
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:55,015
Mr. Kang, can I see you for a moment?

759
00:48:57,643 --> 00:49:00,937
Is Mr. Gong not coming in today?

760
00:49:01,021 --> 00:49:02,648
No, he said he won't be in.

761
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:03,940
Is he sick?

762
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:05,484
I'm not sure.

763
00:49:06,109 --> 00:49:07,361
He didn't tell me why.

764
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,242
How could he actually not show up?

765
00:49:14,326 --> 00:49:15,577
What if he gets fired?

766
00:49:19,414 --> 00:49:20,248
He won't get fired.

767
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:23,001
-Sorry?
-He can't get fired.

768
00:49:23,085 --> 00:49:26,046
That's why he just skips work
whenever he feels like it.

769
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,089
Do you know why?

770
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:29,216
Why?

771
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,761
Mr. Gong is the son

772
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:35,472
-of the chairman of our company.
-Really?

773
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:38,016
I became besties with the cleaning ladies,

774
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:40,185
and they said
he really is the chairman's son.

775
00:49:58,078 --> 00:49:59,079
Ji-hyeok.

776
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:01,373
You scared me.

777
00:50:02,290 --> 00:50:03,333
You were there?

778
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:05,085
I thought the flowers were talking.

779
00:50:10,674 --> 00:50:12,217
What are you doing here?

780
00:50:12,759 --> 00:50:15,178
Shouldn't you be at the office right now?

781
00:50:16,012 --> 00:50:16,972
I played hooky.

782
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,227
I wanted to hang out with you.

783
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:23,979
It's way too soon for that.

784
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,774
You should learn all you can now

785
00:50:27,858 --> 00:50:29,901
if you're going to take over
the business later.

786
00:50:31,069 --> 00:50:33,822
You're smart
because you take after your dad.

787
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,073
I'm sure you'll do well.

788
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,077
Why would I take after that man?

789
00:50:47,210 --> 00:50:49,004
I'm only going to take after you.

790
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:51,173
Okay?

791
00:50:51,840 --> 00:50:52,841
I…

792
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:59,014
I don't want you to take after me.

793
00:51:02,142 --> 00:51:04,436
You should live differently from me.

794
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,104
Happily.

795
00:51:13,153 --> 00:51:16,573
So the team leader who's been
ragging on you is the chairman's son?

796
00:51:16,656 --> 00:51:19,159
Yeah. It's just one hurdle after another.

797
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:21,119
I don't think so.

798
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,454
What do you mean?

799
00:51:22,537 --> 00:51:23,580
Business owners

800
00:51:23,663 --> 00:51:27,375
can forgive even the most annoying,
pain-in-the-ass employee

801
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:28,543
if they're good at their jobs.

802
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:32,172
They can never fire an employee
who makes them a lot of money.

803
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,759
Therefore, you just need to
be good at your job.

804
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:38,553
-Problem solved.
-Really?

805
00:51:38,637 --> 00:51:40,806
All can be forgiven
if I'm just good at my job?

806
00:51:40,889 --> 00:51:43,266
Yeah. That's a principle of capitalism.

807
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:47,187
But why is he already ragging on you
when you've only just started?

808
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:53,235
I don't like that.

809
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,282
-Stop. Hold on.
-What's wrong with you?

810
00:51:59,366 --> 00:52:00,700
-Hold on.
-Move!

811
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:02,410
-No!
-Hey!

812
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,455
What's wrong with you?

813
00:52:10,043 --> 00:52:10,919
Da-rim?

814
00:52:11,753 --> 00:52:13,255
-Oh my!
-Da-rim!

815
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:15,382
Oh my gosh!
Do you live in this neighborhood?

816
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,384
-My gosh, hi!
-No way!

817
00:52:17,467 --> 00:52:21,304
-Does that make us neighborhood buddies?
-Totally!

818
00:52:23,306 --> 00:52:26,142
And is this handsome gentleman
your dear husband?

819
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,311
-Oh, I'm not--
-Yes!

820
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:30,105
He's my husband.

821
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:33,525
Babe, say hello.

822
00:52:33,608 --> 00:52:36,820
This is Jang Jin-hui,
my colleague from the same intake.

823
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,159
Have you lost your mind?

824
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,912
I'm sorry. I really am.

825
00:52:45,996 --> 00:52:48,498
Just help me out for six months
until I become a full-time employee.

826
00:52:49,082 --> 00:52:51,084
After six months,
I'll tell them I got a divorce.

827
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:52,377
Isn't this fraud?

828
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,837
I know, yeah.

829
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,339
You've got to be kidding me.

830
00:52:56,423 --> 00:52:58,550
I promise I won't cause you any trouble.

831
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,428
I mean, it's not like you'll ever
see someone from my office.

832
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:02,846
I just…

833
00:53:03,388 --> 00:53:04,890
I just did.

834
00:53:06,975 --> 00:53:08,435
This is insane.

835
00:53:09,311 --> 00:53:10,145
My dear friend.

836
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,274
Just pretend to be my husband
for six months.

837
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,577
Good morning…

838
00:53:31,708 --> 00:53:34,461
Why do you all look so down?

839
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:37,923
What's the point of working
if the team will disappear soon?

840
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:39,382
Pardon? What do you mean?

841
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:42,344
According to the rumors,
our team was created just for show

842
00:53:42,427 --> 00:53:46,514
so the chairman's son
would have a position in the company.

843
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:48,892
That's why it doesn't matter
if Mr. Gong shows up or not.

844
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:51,186
Our team could disappear
or mess up royally.

845
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,979
None of it matters.

846
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:55,649
I did think it was weird
that the one job requirement

847
00:53:55,732 --> 00:53:56,858
was having a kid.

848
00:53:57,484 --> 00:54:00,111
What good will sighing do?
We should start looking for another job.

849
00:54:04,157 --> 00:54:06,910
Guys, those are just still rumors
at the end of the day.

850
00:54:07,577 --> 00:54:09,955
I mean, even if they are true,

851
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,874
we still have six whole months.

852
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,668
What does that change?

853
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:18,672
Are you just going to let people
look down on you?

854
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:20,090
Without even putting up a fight?

855
00:54:20,757 --> 00:54:23,635
If we can show them how capable we are,

856
00:54:23,718 --> 00:54:25,387
would they still fire us?

857
00:54:26,846 --> 00:54:28,306
I don't think so.

858
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:30,266
No business owner

859
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,769
will fire a hard-working employee
who makes them money.

860
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:37,190
We'll show them through results.

861
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:39,901
We'll make them want to keep us.

862
00:54:39,985 --> 00:54:41,903
Got it?

863
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,203
You know what? Screw it.

864
00:54:50,286 --> 00:54:53,123
Before I'm forced out,
I'll show them a piece of what I got.

865
00:54:54,499 --> 00:54:57,043
I, too, can't quit like this
because I'll die of embarrassment

866
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:59,045
-from my husband and in-laws.
-Exactly.

867
00:55:00,296 --> 00:55:01,464
Let's see it through.

868
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:02,924
-Yeah.
-Okay.

869
00:55:03,008 --> 00:55:05,510
In the spirit of that,
should we do a cheer?

870
00:55:05,593 --> 00:55:07,429
-Okay, bring it in.
-Bring it in.

871
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:08,471
-Bring it in.
-Bring it in.

872
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,515
I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?

873
00:55:10,598 --> 00:55:11,975
-Yes!
-Okay!

874
00:55:12,058 --> 00:55:13,184
Mother.

875
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:14,477
-TF!
-TF!

876
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:29,826
-Oh, 25.
-25.

877
00:55:29,909 --> 00:55:31,411
A, yes.

878
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,912
-One…
-Great.

879
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:33,955
Two…

880
00:55:34,748 --> 00:55:35,623
Three.

881
00:55:59,147 --> 00:55:59,981
I'm clocking out.

882
00:56:00,065 --> 00:56:01,858
I'm heading out first, okay?

883
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:04,194
STABLE FLOW RATE AND VELOCITY…

884
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:17,248
-Late-night snack delivery.
-Oh my.

885
00:57:06,047 --> 00:57:08,967
NATURAL BEBE
NEW BABY BOTTLE PRODUCT MONITORING REPORT

886
00:57:11,052 --> 00:57:12,512
We did it!

887
00:57:13,429 --> 00:57:15,140
-We're done!
-Well done, seriously.

888
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,766
I was so moved.

889
00:57:16,850 --> 00:57:18,852
You all worked so hard.

890
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:21,563
I almost really died.
No more all-nighters for me, ever.

891
00:57:21,646 --> 00:57:24,816
I filled out the empty spaces and all,

892
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:26,526
but I don't know if any of it is right.

893
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,612
We all did our very best.

894
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:33,116
Mr. Gong has to approve it first anyway.
He'll tell us if something is wrong.

895
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,033
Oh, right.

896
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:37,162
But he never shows up for work.
What are we going to do?

897
00:57:37,245 --> 00:57:38,204
Don't worry.

898
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,498
I'll run over
and get him to sign off on it.

899
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:41,749
You have to hand-deliver it?

900
00:57:42,333 --> 00:57:45,420
That's how chairmen's sons are.
I just hope he does it on time.

901
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,046
Excuse me for a second.

902
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,382
Yes, ma'am?

903
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,468
Right now?

904
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:53,636
I'll be right up. Okay.

905
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:55,638
What should we do?

906
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,307
The director is asking to see me.

907
00:57:57,807 --> 00:57:58,892
What about our report?

908
00:58:01,436 --> 00:58:04,105
I'll go and get him to sign off on it.

909
00:58:04,189 --> 00:58:05,148
You should go.

910
00:58:05,231 --> 00:58:06,191
Would you do that for me?

911
00:58:06,274 --> 00:58:07,442
Sure.

912
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:09,777
Where is he right now?

913
00:58:29,172 --> 00:58:31,090
I've already found my luck.

914
00:58:31,716 --> 00:58:33,176
You, Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

915
00:58:35,011 --> 00:58:36,221
Could you possibly keep

916
00:58:36,888 --> 00:58:39,599
what happened in Jeju a secret?

917
00:58:40,308 --> 00:58:42,185
We weren't anything serious anyway.

918
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:45,647
Anyone could make such a mistake
as they make their way through life.

919
00:58:51,486 --> 00:58:54,906
Just consider it a sort of accident,
shake it off, and forget about it.

920
00:59:40,827 --> 00:59:42,579
So you're going to shamelessly
just stick it out, huh?

921
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:44,789
Then again,

922
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,500
that was always your forte.

923
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,336
If you need something,

924
00:59:50,420 --> 00:59:52,964
you're willing to link arms
with a strange man,

925
00:59:53,047 --> 00:59:54,257
kiss him,

926
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,258
go on a date with him,

927
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:57,552
and even go to bed with him
without batting an eye

928
00:59:57,635 --> 00:59:58,761
or an inkling of shame.

929
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:02,932
I see work is no different for you.

930
01:00:03,016 --> 01:00:05,685
You know how to make good use
of your talents in many ways.

931
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:13,109
Yes, I did make good use of them.

932
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:15,987
And I plan on making
even more use of them from now on.

933
01:00:16,654 --> 01:00:18,197
Unlike someone who's the chairman's son,

934
01:00:18,906 --> 01:00:21,909
I don't have the luxury
to skip work and slack off.

935
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:24,871
I'm not some brat
born into cushy privilege

936
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,748
who never worries about making ends meet.

937
01:00:30,043 --> 01:00:30,877
What?

938
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,342
What do you know about me?
How dare you talk--

939
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:38,426
I know a thing or two.

940
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,512
At the very least,

941
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:45,099
I know you'd abandon your team
and skip work if you just feel like it.

942
01:00:45,183 --> 01:00:47,435
I'm well aware
that you're an irresponsible team leader.

943
01:00:48,519 --> 01:00:50,688
Then you must also know why I skip work.

944
01:00:52,565 --> 01:00:54,484
If you're that worried
about your team members…

945
01:00:56,486 --> 01:00:58,112
you should resign and leave.

946
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:02,116
That way, I can also return
to where I belong.

947
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:04,911
It's quite simple.

948
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,834
Will this…

949
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,087
be enough?

950
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:26,432
I'll gladly accept

951
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,935
all the rage you feel toward me.

952
01:01:30,311 --> 01:01:32,480
But the others on the team
have done nothing wrong.

953
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,691
This report

954
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,902
is the result of us running around
and putting our heads together.

955
01:01:38,486 --> 01:01:41,864
For them, this job and this report

956
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:44,575
are their livelihoods and lifelines.

957
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,912
So please, just take a look.

958
01:01:48,955 --> 01:01:50,123
Please.

959
01:02:06,764 --> 01:02:07,682
Is that so?

960
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:14,188
Then why don't you prove to me
that this is indeed…

961
01:02:17,233 --> 01:02:18,192
your lifeline?

962
01:02:48,598 --> 01:02:50,016
No, no.

963
01:04:08,135 --> 01:04:13,057
DYNAMITE KISS

964
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:44,338
Who the hell are you?

965
01:04:44,422 --> 01:04:46,048
I'm her boss. And who the hell are you?

966
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,050
-I'm her husband.
-Don't tell me you're jealous.

967
01:04:48,134 --> 01:04:50,261
Seeing your perfectly fine husband
just pissed me off even more.

968
01:04:50,344 --> 01:04:52,305
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

969
01:04:52,388 --> 01:04:53,681
I wanted it to look sexy.

970
01:04:56,142 --> 01:04:58,978
This won't do.
We'll have to put them in the spotlight.

971
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:01,063
A live commerce? Today?

972
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,358
What's wrong?

973
01:05:06,652 --> 01:05:08,779
Ms. Go! Are you really a mom?

974
01:05:08,863 --> 01:05:11,198
Look at the mess you made
because you couldn't change a mere diaper!

975
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:12,575
Ms. Go is a member of my team.

976
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,827
If anyone is going to scold her
and take responsibility for her,

977
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,203
it'll be me.

978
01:05:16,287 --> 01:05:20,833
