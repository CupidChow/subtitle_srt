You'll need to share
a room with Ms. Go tonight.

00:00:55,513 --> 00:00:56,514
Will you be okay?

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,685
Yes, I'll be fine.
We've been friends for over 20 years.

00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:02,145
That's why it's unsafe.

7
00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:04,397
I mean, more uncomfortable.

8
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,317
How about you come out later?

9
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,985
I'll get you another room.

If somebody sees me leave,
they could get suspicious.

15
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:30,256
I have to go with it
even if it's uncomfortable.

Plus, Da-rim is already anxious
about getting caught as it is.

Are you always such a perfectionist?

18
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:40,016
It's something I decided to see through.

19
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,352
So I'm going to try my best.

20
00:01:43,478 --> 00:01:44,479

In that case,

I also want to try my best.

24
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,538

-Well, I--
-You like someone else?

You've been looking at her all day
with such obvious eyes.

52
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:53,900
Ms. Go Da-rim is the weird one
for not noticing.

53
00:03:55,276 --> 00:03:59,530
But if you've been friends for that long
and still haven't asked her out yet.

54
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,242
Doesn't that mean that's the extent
of your feelings for her?

00:04:04,202 --> 00:04:05,703
It's that much harder

56
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:08,081

for so long.

I don't want to lose the person closest
and most precious to me.

You can't ask her out
because you're afraid she'll reject you.

Are you sure that's real love?

60
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:21,344
I don't think so.
There's nothing simpler than love.

It definitely exists.

It's just that

That way, if love ends,

you can just think of it
as coming to your senses.

If you believe you failed
to protect your love until the end…

It's stress-induced gastritis, apparently.

00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,930
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

182
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:08,602
What do you think of me

183
00:12:09,770 --> 00:12:10,938
as a man and not as a husband?

184
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,273
Hmm?

185
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:17,820
What do you think of me

186
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,072
as a man?

187
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,743
[uplifting music plays]

188
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:38,757
No way.

189
00:12:38,841 --> 00:12:41,260
You have a crush on someone, don't you?
Who is it? Tell me right now.

190
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:42,928
Don't tell me it's Ms. Yu!

191
00:12:44,722 --> 00:12:46,557
[sighs] No, it's not like that.

192
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,641
Why not?

193
00:12:47,725 --> 00:12:49,810
I can totally see
how you'd be attracted to her.

194
00:12:49,894 --> 00:12:52,730
-You should go for it!
-I said it's not like that.

195
00:12:53,772 --> 00:12:55,774
What? Then why did you ask that?

196
00:12:55,858 --> 00:12:58,027
Forget it. Go to sleep.

197
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:02,531
Good night. [grunts]

198
00:13:33,229 --> 00:13:34,230
[sighs]

199
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,447
[groans]

200
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:35,457
[sighs]

201
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:40,588
[Ha-yeong] But if you've been
friends for that long

202
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,464
and still haven't asked her out yet,

203
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,009
doesn't that mean that's the extent
of your feelings for her?

204
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:50,055
Asking her out…

205
00:15:18,042 --> 00:15:19,960
-[Da-rim] Are you tired?
-[Nan-suk] Yeah, I am.

206
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,128
[laughing]

207
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:22,671
[sighs]

208
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,302
[gasps]

209
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,220
[gasps]

210
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,264
[sighs]

211
00:15:32,348 --> 00:15:33,349
This is just crazy.

212
00:15:33,933 --> 00:15:36,769
They both must've lost their minds.

213
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,687
He was on a business trip with his wife.

214
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,233
This is insane.

215
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:46,278
Should I tell her or not?

216
00:15:46,362 --> 00:15:48,238
-[knocks]
-[sighs] Come in.

217
00:15:49,406 --> 00:15:51,033
-[sighs, gasps]
-[gasps]

218
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:54,328
What is it?

219
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,705
I brought the expense report
for the business trip.

220
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:59,208
-You can leave it there.
-Okay.

221
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:02,753
Wait, Ms. Go.

222
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,755
Yes?

223
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:08,676
Does it look like I have something to say?

224
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:12,638
-Pardon?
-I mean, do I have

225
00:16:13,764 --> 00:16:14,974
something to tell you?

226
00:16:15,891 --> 00:16:18,018
What are you trying to say?

227
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:20,104
How about lunch together?

228
00:16:20,771 --> 00:16:22,606
Oh, that's what you're talking about.

229
00:16:23,107 --> 00:16:24,817
Did you know about it too?

230
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,777
Then again, how could you not?

231
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,445
News like that tends to spread quickly.

232
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:29,947
You knew about it?

233
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:31,156
Mm-hmm.

234
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:34,034
Are you okay?

235
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:36,286
[chuckles] I just heard about it.

236
00:16:38,122 --> 00:16:39,915
The cafeteria is serving samgyetang
for lunch today.

237
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,377
Should we head on over together?

238
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,672
Huh?

239
00:16:48,799 --> 00:16:52,177
[Nan-suk] My gosh, the chicken
is so tender. They cooked it so well.

240
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:56,265
-Mmm! The soup is so rich.
-[groans]

241
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:57,891
Do you not have any appetite, Jin-hui?

242
00:16:57,975 --> 00:17:00,477
Looking at this chicken

243
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:03,772
reminds me of the samgyetang place
I went to a few days ago.

244
00:17:03,856 --> 00:17:06,108
You see, I went to this samgyetang place
a while ago, and…

245
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:09,069
[sighs]

246
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,031
[whispers] Come here.

247
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:16,243
You see, I went to this samgyetang place
a few days ago,

248
00:17:16,326 --> 00:17:20,164
and I saw my best friend's husband

249
00:17:20,247 --> 00:17:26,045
pick the meat off the bone
to feed some ditzy young brat.

250
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:28,088
-So it's an affair.
-[Jin-hui] Yeah!

251
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:31,091
They were all over each other,
kissing each other and stuff.

252
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,010
It was a total mess.

253
00:17:33,093 --> 00:17:35,554
Then what about your friend?

254
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:38,390
[Jin-hui] Exactly.
She's completely clueless.

255
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:41,602
She was going on about how he started
wearing cologne and nice clothes,

256
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:43,937
and how it felt like
they were newlyweds again.

257
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,939
-But they were all signs of cheating.
-Oh, no.

258
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,608
-Right.
-Totally.

259
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,651
-[gasps]
-[Ji-hyeok] So?

260
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:51,487
Did you tell your friend?

261
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,072
Sorry?

262
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,200
No, not yet.

263
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,827
It's been weighing on my mind.

264
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,455
I don't know if I should tell her
or just keep it to myself.

265
00:18:01,538 --> 00:18:03,540
Right. It's a concern.

266
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,418
-It's a legit concern.
-Right.

267
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:07,503
Of course, you have to tell her.

268
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:09,088
Do you want your friend
to stay in the dark?

269
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,214
Right.

270
00:18:10,297 --> 00:18:13,842
From my experience,
that's not always the way to go.

271
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,011
It could just be a fling.
A moment of weakness, if you will.

272
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:17,971
But if your friend finds out,

273
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:20,682
-then there's no turning back.
-[Jin-hui exclaims]

274
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,018
Yeah, it'll leave a scar on her forever.

275
00:18:23,102 --> 00:18:24,603
Just look the other way.

276
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:26,605
-Maybe you're right.
-[Nan-suk] Yeah.

277
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:29,149
[sucks teeth, tuts]

278
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:41,286
[door opens]

279
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,082
-Are you going somewhere?
-[chuckles]

280
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,168
I want to go on a walk for some fresh air.

281
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,503
Then let me accompany you.

282
00:18:49,586 --> 00:18:50,587
[sighs]

283
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:51,880
You don't need to worry.

284
00:18:52,589 --> 00:18:55,092
I won't leave the hospital building.

285
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:58,387
[grunting]

286
00:19:05,769 --> 00:19:09,106
[panting]

287
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:13,443
[groans]

288
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:17,573
-[husband] Look at you go. Are you tired?
-[patient groaning]

289
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,324
Let's sit and take a break.

290
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,534
Careful.

291
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,452
Oh. Oh! There you go.

292
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:25,747
You didn't need to come.

293
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:28,667
How could I not?
I'd be worried sick if I didn't.

294
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:31,628
I'll gladly follow you
to the ends of the earth.

295
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:33,255
[chuckles]

296
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:35,841
-Thank you.
-Of course.

297
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,886
Once you get better,
let's go travel abroad.

298
00:19:38,969 --> 00:19:40,679
[Myeong-sun] Oh, no.
What are they going to do?

299
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:43,140
-They're going to get caught.
-[patient] Oh, no.

300
00:19:43,682 --> 00:19:44,892
[patient] They're going to fall.

301
00:19:44,975 --> 00:19:46,393
-Oh, gosh.
-What are they going to do?

302
00:19:47,394 --> 00:19:49,313
They get me every time.

303
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,190
Have some while you watch.

304
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,816
-It's good.
-[Myeong-sun] My daughter brought them.

305
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,902
[patient] I wish I had a daughter too.

306
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:56,695
-Have some.
-It's good.

307
00:20:00,282 --> 00:20:01,658
They'll get into big trouble if they fall.

308
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:03,076
[Myeong-sun] Would you like one?

309
00:20:05,454 --> 00:20:08,874
[chuckles] No, thank you. I'm okay.

310
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:11,752
SANDWICH BISCUIT

311
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,463
I didn't eat any of it.

312
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:18,800
My daughter ripped the packaging for me
because I was too weak after surgery.

313
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:22,012
Try it. It's soft and delicious.

314
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:25,557
-[chuckles] I said I'm okay.
-It's fine, take it.

315
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:27,142
-No, really. I'm fine.
-Just eat…

316
00:20:33,106 --> 00:20:34,107
I'm sorry.

317
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,736
I was being too forceful.

318
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,114
It's fine.

319
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:44,368
Everyone

320
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,454
has their ups and downs in life.

321
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:51,124
After my husband passed,

322
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,045
there were many times
when I just wanted to end my life.

323
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:58,548
But I couldn't go through with it
when I thought about my kids.

324
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:00,968
As a mom,

325
00:21:01,718 --> 00:21:04,763
how could I hurt my kids like that?

326
00:21:04,846 --> 00:21:09,017
When I forced myself to keep going,
I found myself getting by somehow.

327
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:11,979
What's your story?

328
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:14,356
-[groans]
-Oh, gosh.

329
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:19,069
I'm sorry,
I think I may have spoken out of line.

330
00:21:21,321 --> 00:21:24,116
Yes. You really did.

331
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:27,995
I never said I wanted to hear your story.

332
00:21:29,579 --> 00:21:31,039
Oh, dear.

333
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:32,958
I just meant…

334
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:36,837
What's wrong with me?

335
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:52,936
[door opens]

336
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:56,481
-[Da-rim] I'm home.
-[door closes]

337
00:21:56,565 --> 00:21:58,442
Oh, hey. You're here.

338
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,568
What are you up to?

339
00:21:59,651 --> 00:22:02,571
I'm just choosing photos
for the ad concept.

340
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,073
-How are they?
-Not bad. Take a look.

341
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:06,158
Mmm.

342
00:22:06,241 --> 00:22:08,452
[gasps] They look nice.

343
00:22:08,535 --> 00:22:09,786
-You think so?
-Yeah.

344
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:12,331
What's that?

345
00:22:12,956 --> 00:22:14,333
Oh, this?

346
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,418
It's our reformulated baby lotion.

347
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:18,420
Can you test it
and tell me what you think?

348
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:20,297
It was a favor
from the product development team.

349
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:22,466
If Jun's sleeping right now,
try it tomorrow morning.

350
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,550
Let me try it now.

351
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:27,304
I share Jun's lotion,
so I'll be able to tell.

352
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:29,931
Mmm.

353
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:32,934
It goes on smoothly and feels hydrating.

354
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:35,270
Hold on. Let me see the ingredients.

355
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,856
It's the best one out of
all the ones I've used recently.

356
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:39,900
Really? Okay.

357
00:22:39,983 --> 00:22:42,527
But why do you use Jun's lotion?
Don't you have your own?

358
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,614
That's just what happens
when you're raising a kid.

359
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,366
You use whatever is left on your hand
after applying it on them.

360
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,827
You have to hug them,
hold them, and play with them.

361
00:22:50,911 --> 00:22:53,413
If I use the wrong adult lotion,
it could irritate their skin.

362
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:54,581
I see.

363
00:22:55,415 --> 00:22:57,000
Then what about the scent?

364
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,877
Is it okay for adults to use?

365
00:22:58,960 --> 00:22:59,961
The scent?

366
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,755
[sniffs]

367
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:04,007
It just smells like baby powder.

368
00:23:07,886 --> 00:23:09,971
[romantic music plays]

369
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:12,057
[sniffs]

370
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:29,366
Hmm. The powdery note is strong.

371
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,912
But as you said, if parents use
the same lotion as their kids,

372
00:23:33,995 --> 00:23:36,623
a scent that's too baby-like
might not be the best, no?

373
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,542
-What?
-Right?

374
00:23:39,876 --> 00:23:41,503
Oh, right.

375
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,880
Imagine if they were
regular office workers.

376
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,841
[chuckles] Yeah, you're right.

377
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,467
I guess it could feel a bit out of place

378
00:23:47,551 --> 00:23:49,636
to smell like baby powder
at a business meeting.

379
00:23:49,719 --> 00:23:54,057
Yeah. For now, I should suggest
they make this unscented.

380
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,350
That was really helpful.

381
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:57,477
Thanks, friend. I'm off.

382
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,938
Okay, sure.

383
00:24:00,021 --> 00:24:01,815
-Bye.
-Bye. [in English] Thank you.

384
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:04,151
[sighs]

385
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,028
[door closes]

386
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,488
[in Korean] Kim Seon-u?

387
00:24:09,364 --> 00:24:10,907
That no-name photographer?

388
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,285
I already told you he's a no!

389
00:24:13,368 --> 00:24:15,412
Come on, have some standards.

390
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:19,583
Why did you even appoint someone
who couldn't secure a diploma in the US

391
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,251
as the deputy director in the first place?

392
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,544
You take care of this.

393
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,256
I wonder if David Kim
is done with his exhibition in New York.

394
00:24:27,757 --> 00:24:30,177
Ji-hyeok chose him, not me.

395
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:33,180
What? Ji-hyeok did?

396
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,682
[groans]

397
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:38,602
-Then just proceed as is for now.
-Honey!

398
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:40,020
[father] I'll put my trust
in Gong Ji-hyeok.

399
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:43,857
Even Tae-yeong acknowledged that Ji-hyeok
had an undeniably discerning eye.

400
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:47,068
Whenever he found a promising start-up
worth investing in,

401
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:50,447
Ji-hyeok had more often than not
already signed them.

402
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:54,367
It means he has good instincts
and works fast.

403
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,954
If our Tae-yeong approves of him,
then I suppose I'll trust him.

404
00:24:58,038 --> 00:24:59,831
When he returns next week,

405
00:24:59,915 --> 00:25:02,459
we should have a meal
with Chairman Gong's family.

406
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,586
[father] We should. [clears throat]

407
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:09,883
Mr. Kang, can you confirm you received
the pictures I sent for the ad concept?

408
00:25:09,966 --> 00:25:12,469
Yes. Okay,
I'll see you at the office later.

409
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,471
[line disconnects]

410
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,310
[contemplative music plays]

411
00:25:23,396 --> 00:25:24,814
[sighs]

412
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,531
If parents use the same lotion
as their kids,

413
00:25:33,615 --> 00:25:35,825
a scent that's too baby-like
might not be the best, no?

414
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,015
[footsteps approaching]

415
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,771
[gasps] Mr. Kim!

416
00:26:05,981 --> 00:26:07,399
[clears throat]

417
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,026
Hello.

418
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,989
Why are you all dressed up?
You're making my heart flutter.

419
00:26:14,781 --> 00:26:15,824
[grunts]

420
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,701
[exclaims] You smell good too.

421
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:19,786
My makeup also looks good today.

422
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,956
And I'm wearing a cute outfit. [chuckles]

423
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,501
Should we take some first birthday photos
after the meeting?

424
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,003
Might as well take some
since I look pretty.

425
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:30,422
Well… [inhales sharply]

426
00:26:30,505 --> 00:26:33,717
-Today might be a bit--
-Forget it then.

427
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,885
I'll just spill the beans.

428
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,515
[sighs]

429
00:26:40,598 --> 00:26:41,641
All right.

430
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:44,144
Let's do it.

431
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,979
-Let's take some.
-Okay!

432
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,858
[elevator dings]

433
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:54,195
Mr. Gong.

434
00:26:54,988 --> 00:26:55,989
Did you two…

435
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:58,825
come together?

436
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:01,077
No, we met on the first floor.

437
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,955
See you later. We should head inside.

438
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:09,002
[sniffing]

439
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:15,300
She was going on about how he started
wearing cologne and nice clothes,

440
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,719
and how it felt like
they were newlyweds again.

441
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:20,180
-But they were all signs of cheating.
-[Da-rim] Oh, no.

442
00:27:26,269 --> 00:27:27,604
[gasps, sighs]

443
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,110
You sure about this?

444
00:27:34,194 --> 00:27:35,779
Your wife works here.

445
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,532
That's what makes it more fun.

446
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:41,993
It makes it thrilling.

447
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:43,078
[giggles]

448
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,039
[in English] Naughty boy.

449
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,343
[gasps]

450
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,596
[exhales sharply]

451
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:04,724
[door opens]

452
00:28:06,017 --> 00:28:07,018
[door closes]

453
00:28:07,102 --> 00:28:08,895
[footsteps approach]

454
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:16,069
[in Korean] What's wrong with you?

455
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,487
This is where I always sit.

456
00:28:18,321 --> 00:28:19,572
Find another seat.

457
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:29,040
[sniffs]

458
00:28:29,124 --> 00:28:31,042
-Thank you.
-Here's the proposal.

459
00:28:32,001 --> 00:28:33,169
-Hold on.
-What?

460
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:36,840
Look.

461
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:39,300
Oh, my. Nan-suk, look.

462
00:28:39,384 --> 00:28:43,722
-He's so sweet.
-They're always so lovey-dovey.

463
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:46,307
-Thank you.
-[Go-eun] He's just naturally sweet.

464
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,936
Goodness gracious. [chuckles]

465
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,523
-Trash.
-Mr. Gong.

466
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,234
[Gyeong-min, knocking table] Mr. Gong?

467
00:28:56,317 --> 00:28:57,360
What?

468
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,780
Could you tell us which concept
you prefer between the final two?

469
00:29:00,864 --> 00:29:02,407
Well, let's see.

470
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,452
Let's ask the others first.

471
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:08,246
Personally,

472
00:29:08,329 --> 00:29:10,290
I think the one on the right
would be better.

473
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,084
If we want our consumers
to emotionally connect

474
00:29:13,168 --> 00:29:14,961
with the feeling of parental care,

475
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:18,757
I think it'd be better for the focus
to be on people rather than trees.

476
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,967
[Go-eun] But wouldn't that
obscure the message

477
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,969
behind our environmental campaign launch?

478
00:29:23,052 --> 00:29:24,763
[Nan-suk] You have a point.
To make sure it doesn't,

479
00:29:24,846 --> 00:29:27,182
we should show more of the trees.

480
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:29,392
[Jin-hui] If we do go with option two,

481
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:32,562
I think it'd be nice to have
a more front-facing shot of the kids.

482
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,646
[Ji-hyeok] Why these two…

483
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,565
Hey, have you seriously lost your mind?

484
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,735
-Yes.
-Maybe we should just make both posters.

485
00:29:38,818 --> 00:29:40,028
[TF members exclaiming]

486
00:29:40,111 --> 00:29:42,405
[Gyeong-min] One focusing on trees,
and another on people.

487
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:43,490
[Go-eun] Okay.

488
00:29:43,573 --> 00:29:45,617
[Gyeong-min] And the copy
can also be different.

489
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:47,619
You think so?
We don't need to make them the same?

490
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:50,580
The format can be similar,
but I think the content can be different.

491
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,415
I think that would be good.

492
00:29:53,333 --> 00:29:54,667
And…

493
00:29:56,002 --> 00:29:57,128
Thank you.

494
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:59,339
The poster with the focus on people
can be worked on by Ms. Jang and--

495
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:00,423
-I'd like to do it.
-Okay.

496
00:30:00,507 --> 00:30:02,342
[in English] Yeah, yeah!

497
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:04,260
[Gyeong-min, in Korean]
Then Ms. Bae and Ms. Lee

498
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:06,888
can work on the one
that focuses on the trees.

499
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,182
That concludes our meeting.
Let's go have lunch.

500
00:30:09,265 --> 00:30:12,185
Mr. Kim and Ms. Yu, why don't you join us?

501
00:30:12,268 --> 00:30:16,022
-Uh… Should I?
-[Da-rim] Yeah, you should.

502
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:17,899
I'm skipping because of my gastritis.

503
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:20,401
-[Seon-u] Are you still feeling sick?
-Yeah.

504
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:22,070
Then why don't we go out
and have some porridge?

505
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,863
[Ha-yeong clears throat]

506
00:30:27,826 --> 00:30:30,870
Oh, right. I forgot I had something to do.

507
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:31,955
Sorry.

508
00:30:32,038 --> 00:30:33,915
It's fine. Work is more important.

509
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,251
-Don't worry about me.
-[Ji-hyeok] Are they being serious?

510
00:30:36,334 --> 00:30:39,045
-Let's head out together, Mr. Kim.
-Sure.

511
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:41,422
Ms. Yu, why don't you join me for lunch?

512
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,675
I have something to discuss with you
regarding work.

513
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,885
I'm sorry,
but I also have a prior engagement.

514
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,053
-Let's go, Mr. Kim.
-I'm off.

515
00:30:47,136 --> 00:30:49,305
Okay, bye. Bye, Ms. Yu.

516
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:01,067
[groans]

517
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:03,736
[breathes shakily]

518
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:05,989
[groans]

519
00:31:07,031 --> 00:31:08,074
[sighs]

520
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,954
[Da-rim] Food that's good for the stomach.

521
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:17,166
"Porridge or ginger tea."

522
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,835
[sighs]

523
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,462
LOVE PORRIDGE

524
00:31:22,297 --> 00:31:23,715
What's this?

525
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:26,843
Abalone porridge.

526
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,220
I ordered beef porridge,
but they got my order wrong.

527
00:31:29,304 --> 00:31:31,306
I'm allergic to abalones,

528
00:31:32,015 --> 00:31:35,560
-but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.
-Oh, I see.

529
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,729
Then why don't you ask them
to make a new one?

530
00:31:37,812 --> 00:31:39,856
It's fine. You eat it.

531
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:51,242
[door opens, closes]

532
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:53,620
[Jin-hui] How about we make it round?

533
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:54,871
I'll leave a note.

534
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,039
-Great.
-It could be bigger.

535
00:31:56,122 --> 00:31:57,582
-Have a drink, everyone.
-Yeah, I agree.

536
00:31:57,665 --> 00:31:59,626
-Oh, coffee.
-Coffee!

537
00:31:59,709 --> 00:32:01,836
Coffee after lunch!

538
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:02,921
Ginger tea?

539
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:05,256
Why did you get ginger tea?

540
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:07,550
They were half price
at the shop out front.

541
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:09,427
Just the ginger tea.

542
00:32:28,529 --> 00:32:30,031
[sighs]

543
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,702
[determined music plays]

544
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:53,471
I saw you earlier today.
What brings you here?

545
00:32:54,681 --> 00:32:56,349
You seem to be in a great mood.

546
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:59,978
Where did you go after the meeting?

547
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:04,065
Ji-hyeok,

548
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,566
I have a crush on someone.

549
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:09,070
I haven't had a chance
to tell my parents yet,

550
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:11,322
-but our marriage--
-No.

551
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:12,490
You can't.

552
00:33:13,074 --> 00:33:14,200
What?

553
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:16,369
He's a married…

554
00:33:16,452 --> 00:33:17,578
[breathes shakily]

555
00:33:17,662 --> 00:33:20,665
He's a married man.
He has a wife and a kid.

556
00:33:21,249 --> 00:33:22,625
What?

557
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,793
I saw you and Kim Seon-u…

558
00:33:25,545 --> 00:33:27,505
-kissing.
-[gasps]

559
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:30,091
I passed off your selfish
and immature behavior up until now

560
00:33:30,174 --> 00:33:31,634
as being cute.

561
00:33:31,718 --> 00:33:33,052
But this is just wrong.

562
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:35,013
You've crossed way over the line.

563
00:33:35,096 --> 00:33:36,806
Are you saying you want to go through
with this marriage?

564
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:39,600
You're the one who said
there would be no love between us.

565
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:40,685
So?

566
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:43,730
Is this your way of protesting?
To prevent this marriage?

567
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,189
Stop playing with fire.

568
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,400
And stop trying to use people.

569
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,985
I'm not playing with fire.

570
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,653
And I'm definitely not using him.

571
00:33:51,237 --> 00:33:53,239
Then what is it?

572
00:33:53,322 --> 00:33:54,699
The truth is, he's…

573
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:58,745
Could you keep this a secret?

574
00:33:58,828 --> 00:33:59,996
Please.

575
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:03,499
[sighs]

576
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,418
I'm going through with this marriage,
no matter what.

577
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,295
And once we're married,

578
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:08,880
I won't tolerate infidelity.

579
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,632
You should show respect
even if it's a loveless marriage.

580
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,134
I mean, why?

581
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:15,636
Why do you want to get married
all of a sudden?

582
00:34:16,512 --> 00:34:18,389
You only care about your own feelings,
don't you?

583
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:20,641
Don't you realize
you're destroying a family?

584
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:22,894
-[scoffs]
-Ms. Go

585
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,272
is just an ordinary woman and mother.

586
00:34:26,355 --> 00:34:27,356
If she finds out…

587
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:31,569
[breathes shakily]

588
00:34:31,652 --> 00:34:32,653
…her world will crumble.

589
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:35,948
No, it won't. [groans]
This is driving me crazy.

590
00:34:38,743 --> 00:34:41,871
Why are you even worried about her?

591
00:34:46,042 --> 00:34:47,251
Because she's my team member.

592
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,129
I trust you understand.

593
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,131
I'm off.

594
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,721
-[sighs]
-[door closes]

595
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:01,724
[sighs]

596
00:35:14,695 --> 00:35:17,073
-[Da-rim] What's this?
-Abalone porridge.

597
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:18,449
-Have a drink, everyone.
-Yeah, I agree.

598
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:19,909
-Oh, coffee.
-Coffee!

599
00:35:19,992 --> 00:35:21,077
Ginger tea?

600
00:35:22,036 --> 00:35:24,122
[Ji-hyeok] They were half price
at the shop out front.

601
00:35:24,205 --> 00:35:25,206
Just the ginger tea.

602
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,458
[sighs]

603
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,197
[sighs]

604
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,207
-[knocks]
-[Ji-hyeok] Come in.

605
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:19,468
There's something I want to give you
before the presentation.

606
00:36:23,389 --> 00:36:24,599
Here.

607
00:36:30,730 --> 00:36:31,731
This is…

608
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:33,941
It's the clover from last time.

609
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:42,950
You picked it up and kept it?

610
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,077
It would've been a waste.
I worked hard to find it.

611
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:48,164
Turns out, this is pretty effective.

612
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:50,041
It brought this wonderful person
into my life

613
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,919
who paid off my debt,

614
00:36:53,002 --> 00:36:55,630
bought me porridge, and more.

615
00:36:55,713 --> 00:36:57,131
[chuckles]

616
00:36:57,215 --> 00:37:00,426
I'm sure it'll bring you good luck
for your presentation as well.

617
00:37:00,509 --> 00:37:02,511
So take it with you and see what it does.

618
00:37:03,971 --> 00:37:05,723
I have to say I do feel a bit guilty

619
00:37:06,515 --> 00:37:07,850
for receiving so much support.

620
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:10,853
I pursued this campaign

621
00:37:12,396 --> 00:37:14,398
with a bit of a personal motive.

622
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:21,739
You want to carry on
your mother's work, right?

623
00:37:23,324 --> 00:37:25,284
"I want to protect my child."

624
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,329
"I want him to live in a better world."

625
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:34,669
I hope your mother's sentiment
is received well.

626
00:37:36,003 --> 00:37:38,547
Because that's a sentiment
shared by all parents.

627
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:49,016
I just rambled on and on,
didn't I? [chuckles]

628
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,852
I'll leave you to get ready.

629
00:37:52,895 --> 00:37:53,896
Ah…

630
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:55,523
You got this.

631
00:37:58,567 --> 00:37:59,735
[door closes]

632
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:02,863
[sighs]

633
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:07,952
[exhales shakily]

634
00:38:09,704 --> 00:38:11,080
[chuckles]

635
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:12,957
Hey, TF!

636
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,917
Wait. Where are your shovels?

637
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:17,378
You should've brought them with you.

638
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,881
[chuckles] I heard you were just shoveling
nonsense to prepare for this campaign.

639
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,300
Anyhow,

640
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:25,136
I look forward to your brilliant nonsense.

641
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,762
[laughing]

642
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:32,852
Do we actually have a shovel?
I'd love to bury him alive.

643
00:38:33,644 --> 00:38:36,605
He just needs to wait and see
who laughs in the end.

644
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,858
Okay, let's go win this thing.

645
00:38:38,941 --> 00:38:40,651
[exclaiming]

646
00:38:46,032 --> 00:38:47,533
[in English] "Ten Pocket Kids."

647
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,160
[in Korean] It means for one child,

648
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:51,203
as many as ten wallets open,
from parents and relatives

649
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,497
to even family friends.

650
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:56,000
In other words, fewer kids
mean a more privileged upbringing.

651
00:38:56,584 --> 00:38:58,419
We incorporated this sentiment

652
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,380
into our marketing strategy
to elevate Natural BeBe

653
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:03,174
into a global luxury brand.

654
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:06,135
This is the "Born to Be Luxury" campaign.

655
00:39:06,927 --> 00:39:10,681
As you're aware, this is Jessica,
a Hollywood star and a global influencer

656
00:39:11,307 --> 00:39:13,392
with over 300 million followers worldwide.

657
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:14,769
We proposed the idea

658
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,521
of showcasing her parenting moments
on social media while using our products,

659
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:19,899
and we've made significant headway.

660
00:39:19,982 --> 00:39:21,484
How far along are you?

661
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:23,527
We can sign the contract
and bring her on board

662
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:25,446
the second you approve the campaign.

663
00:39:25,529 --> 00:39:26,614
[chuckles]

664
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,207
MOTHER TF

665
00:39:39,043 --> 00:39:40,920
Luxury? It's nice.

666
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,924
But is Natural BeBe
a company that sells luxury goods?

667
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,133
[scoffs]

668
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,510
No.

669
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,761
Natural BeBe…

670
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,265
is a company
that makes essential products.

671
00:39:54,392 --> 00:39:57,103
Products accessible
to anyone raising children.

672
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,813
The essentials.

673
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:03,442
Director Choi, how did it feel
when you first held your child?

674
00:40:03,526 --> 00:40:06,278
Did you wish for them
to make more money than others?

675
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:09,573
Or did you wish for them
to become a prodigy,

676
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:11,117
skilled in sports or studies?

677
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,160
No parent would wish for such things.

678
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:16,789
You just wish for your child
to grow up healthy.

679
00:40:17,456 --> 00:40:18,624
Don't you agree, sir?

680
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:21,168
-Yeah.
-[Ji-hyeok] That's right.

681
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:24,713
For the simple wish
that their child grows up safe and sound,

682
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:28,134
parents bear the heaviest burden
in the world,

683
00:40:28,717 --> 00:40:30,511
and they do so willingly.

684
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:33,514
Natural BeBe shouldn't encourage parents

685
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:36,434
to compare their children
and raise them to outshine others.

686
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,686
Shouldn't we become their partners

687
00:40:40,062 --> 00:40:42,231
who will share that heavy burden instead?

688
00:40:43,232 --> 00:40:45,734
Inspired by a desire
to stand by every parent out there,

689
00:40:46,694 --> 00:40:47,695
we make this proposal.

690
00:40:48,362 --> 00:40:49,363
This is

691
00:40:50,322 --> 00:40:52,408
the tree-planting CSR campaign,

692
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:55,411
"A Green Future We Draw Together."

693
00:40:56,412 --> 00:40:59,331
How exactly does tree-planting fit in?

694
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,586
[Ji-hyeok] On the left,
you'll see the sapling

695
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,797
that was planted 20 years ago
as part of Natural BeBe's CSR initiative.

696
00:41:06,881 --> 00:41:10,176
And on the right,
you'll see it in its current state.

697
00:41:10,843 --> 00:41:12,052
While I grew up,

698
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:17,808
so did this tree to provide fresh,
clean air to this day.

699
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:21,312
And it'll continue to do so
as I bring a child into this world

700
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,730
to grow up alongside it.

701
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,524
Planting a tree

702
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:29,028
means fostering healthy growth.

703
00:41:29,987 --> 00:41:31,280
And isn't that…

704
00:41:33,032 --> 00:41:34,867
what we do best?

705
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:51,217
"In ten years, who will be taller?
You or the tree?"

yellow or red,

711
00:42:03,771 --> 00:42:05,231
I like trees for being trees,

712
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:06,690
and I like you

713
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:07,983

how precious a shade can be."

for a four-leaf clover

718

Good work.

725
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,321
You too.

What are you doing?

729
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:57,343
Mr. Gong!

731
00:43:59,595 --> 00:44:01,513

-We did it!

732
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,939
Good job, everyone!

-Good job, everyone!
-Good job, everyone!

734
00:44:13,692 --> 00:44:14,902
Good job.

735
00:44:16,987 --> 00:44:18,280
You said you had gastritis.

736
00:44:18,781 --> 00:44:20,991
I need to have a drink on a day like this.

737
00:44:21,075 --> 00:44:23,452
I coated my stomach with medicine earlier.

738
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,287
Then you should
at least eat something first.

739
00:44:31,627 --> 00:44:32,628
Okay.

740
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:35,422
Mr. Gong.

741
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:38,842
I totally fell for you today.

742
00:44:38,926 --> 00:44:40,552
You're such an excellent presenter.

743
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,429
You were so eloquent.

744
00:44:42,513 --> 00:44:46,100
You know, if he tried to sell me
electric jade mats,

745
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,643
I would have one in every room
in my house.

746
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:48,727
-Me too.
-[laughing]

747
00:44:48,811 --> 00:44:50,312
-I'd buy them all.
-I agree. You were amazing.

748
00:44:50,396 --> 00:44:54,608
That's why I've stayed by his side
for all these years.

749
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:56,610
It's all thanks to your hard work.

750
00:44:57,194 --> 00:44:59,113
You should feel proud
of the fact that you beat

751
00:44:59,696 --> 00:45:01,782
our company's marketing team
with your skills alone.

752

Let's clink our glasses.

-[Nan-suk] I'm about to tear up.
-Me too.

754
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:08,372
Come on now, everyone.

755
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:09,998
Okay, what should we order next?

756
00:45:10,082 --> 00:45:12,042
Lobster? Pasta?

757
00:45:12,126 --> 00:45:13,794
Order anything and as much as you'd like.

758
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,796
It'll be Mr. Gong's treat tonight.

759
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,381
-Oh, my. Really?
-For real?

760
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,049
Can I order enough for my breakfast?

762
00:45:21,176 --> 00:45:24,304
[Go-eun] Excuse me,
what's the most expensive dish here?

763
00:45:24,388 --> 00:45:25,848
[Gyeong-min] I'm curious too.

764
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:29,435
-Amazing. They sell abalones here.
-Oh, my.

765
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:30,936
-Abalones?
-We have to order this.

766
00:45:31,019 --> 00:45:32,438
-One per table.
-Good call.

767
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,106
[Gyeong-min] That sounds so good.

768
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:42,781
[Jin-hui] Hold on.

769
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:46,577
We should've invited Mr. Kim and Ms. Yu.

770
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,078
We all worked on it together.

771
00:45:48,162 --> 00:45:49,204
[Gyeong-min] They're both busy.

772
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:51,165
They said they'd drop by
if they finish early.

773
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,583
I wonder if they'll make it.

774

[exclaiming]

775
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,296
[Jin-hui] We should wait all night
if we have to. We must.

776
00:46:00,591 --> 00:46:02,134
Mr. Kim! Over here.

777

[giggles]

778
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,512
-Come over here.
-Sorry?

779
00:46:05,596 --> 00:46:06,638
Oh, gosh.

780
00:46:09,057 --> 00:46:10,058
Ta-da!

781
00:46:10,142 --> 00:46:11,935
What's all this?

782
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:14,146
-It's a party table for my first birthday.
-What?

783
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:19,818
I'm ready.

784
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,945
Here we go.

785
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:24,740
Can you smile a little?

786
00:46:24,823 --> 00:46:25,866
-[chuckles]
-Great.

787
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,326
Can you take a bite of the food?

788
00:46:27,993 --> 00:46:30,245
Great. That looks good.

789
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,539
Uh…

790
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:35,000
Pardon me for a second.

791
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,799

-Isn't it so good?

[laughing]

797
00:47:07,783 --> 00:47:09,785
What? Who finished this?

[sighs]

799
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:12,454
This is amazing.

800
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,542
Who drinks wine like it's water?

801
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:17,751
You see,

802
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:20,170
I'm in such a good mood.

803
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:22,089
I'm so happy right now.

804
00:47:22,965 --> 00:47:25,884
-Here's the abalone risotto and lasagna.
-Oh, my!

805
00:47:25,968 --> 00:47:28,428
-That looks so good.
-Oh, my goodness!

806
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:30,055
-Thank you.
-I can't believe it.

807
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:31,139
[Nan-suk] Mr. Gong.

808
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,393
Please have the first bite!

809
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:36,144
[Ji-hyeok] Why, thank you.

810
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:38,230
-[Jin-hui] Give me some too.
-[Nan-suk] Okay.

811
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:46,196
Mmm. Their abalone is really good.

812
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:47,364
[chuckles]

813
00:47:48,156 --> 00:47:49,950
I'm allergic to abalones,

814
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:52,286
but I couldn't waste perfectly good food.

815
00:47:54,288 --> 00:47:55,455
[sighs]

816
00:47:56,582 --> 00:47:57,583
[Nan-suk] Oh, right.

817
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,334
Jin-hui, what's the update on your friend?

818
00:47:59,418 --> 00:48:02,504
Did you tell her
about her husband cheating?

819
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:04,006
I didn't even get a chance to.

820
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,257
That bastard…

821
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:06,508
[clears throat]

822
00:48:06,592 --> 00:48:08,385
I mean, her husband confessed.

823
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,803
-[Nan-suk] Oh, my.
-What?

824
00:48:09,886 --> 00:48:11,013
He came clean?

825
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:14,391
That bastard told her,
"I think I found the love of my life."

826
00:48:14,474 --> 00:48:17,019
He talked some bullshit
and told her he doesn't need

827
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,812
money or custody, just a divorce.

828
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:20,105
Does that even make sense, Nan-suk?

829
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,898
That's a load of bull.
She can't divorce him.

830
00:48:21,982 --> 00:48:23,942
-Of course not.
-Right, it'll only benefit him.

831
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,445
I think I'd let him go.

832
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:27,529
[Jin-hui] What?

833
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:28,905
It's one thing if I didn't know,

834
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:32,034
but I already know
that he doesn't love me anymore.

835
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,244
How could we live under the same roof?

836
00:48:35,287 --> 00:48:37,706
I think that would make me more pitiful.

837
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,293
[gentle melodic music playing]

838
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:50,802
-SHOULD I COME PICK YOU UP?
-IT'S OKAY!

839
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:52,387
ARE YOU STILL OUT?

840
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,895
I think we took plenty.

841
00:48:59,978 --> 00:49:02,189
I'll edit the best cuts
and send them to you.

842
00:49:02,272 --> 00:49:03,273
Uh…

843
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,441
Where are you going?

844
00:49:04,524 --> 00:49:06,860
I rented out the whole place
for the shoot.

845
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:08,737
What about the first birthday ceremony?

846
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,781
I'm sorry. Something urgent came up.

847
00:49:16,370 --> 00:49:17,371
[door closes]

848
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,916
-I'll see you at work.
-[laughing]

849
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,000
Thank you for the meal.

850
00:49:22,084 --> 00:49:23,418
-You'd better get home safe.
-Oh, goodness.

851
00:49:23,502 --> 00:49:25,629
-Get home safely.
-All right. Wait.

852
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,589
My goodness! [laughs]

853
00:49:27,673 --> 00:49:29,216
[Go-eun] I'll get going too.

854
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:30,717
Thank you for dinner.

855
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:31,843
Wait, Ms. Lee!

856
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:33,679
-Let's share. We're going the same way.
-Oh, okay.

857
00:49:33,762 --> 00:49:34,888
We're off.

858
00:49:40,936 --> 00:49:42,604
[humming]

859
00:49:43,814 --> 00:49:47,234
What? Wait. Where did everyone go?

860
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,527
They all went home.

861
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:49,820
Oh, no.

862
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,698
They have to eat this.

863
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:54,324
Why did you buy so much ice cream?

864
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:58,995
You're drunk. You were drinking
like there was no tomorrow.

865
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,707
No, I'm not drunk at all.

866
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,250
I can even go for round two.

867
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:06,712
See? I'm not the slightest bit
drunk right now,

868
00:50:06,795 --> 00:50:08,255
and I can prove it.

869
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,427
[in English] One, two. Cha, cha, cha.

870
00:50:14,720 --> 00:50:18,140
One, two. Cha, cha, cha.

871
00:50:18,807 --> 00:50:20,976
One, two… [laughs]

872
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:23,311
[in Korean]
You're the drunk one, Mr. Gong.

873
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:25,272
We didn't even drink that much.

874
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:27,274
You're such a lightweight.

875
00:50:27,357 --> 00:50:28,900
-Oh, geez.
-Careful.

876
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:30,318
Careful.

877
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:31,653
[laughs]

878
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:34,156
I'll call Mr. Kim for you.

879
00:50:35,741 --> 00:50:37,033
[gasps]

880
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:38,326
The clover.

881
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:47,961
I told you. It was effective, right?

882
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,839
Holding on to it

883
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:53,675
helped you win.

884
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:54,926
[giggles]

885
00:50:57,137 --> 00:50:58,221
Yeah, if you say so.

886
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,561
I think

887
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,731
you're a really great person.

888
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:12,569
You even lied for my sake.

889
00:51:12,652 --> 00:51:14,613
When did I do that?

890
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:16,198
I know everything.

891
00:51:20,368 --> 00:51:23,747
-Don't tell me--
-How could I not notice? I'm not an idiot.

892
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,207
Come on.

893
00:51:28,335 --> 00:51:29,544
You know everything?

894
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,755
All of it?

895
00:51:31,838 --> 00:51:34,132
-Then do you know your husband is--
-Of course.

896
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,884
I know everything.

897
00:51:37,469 --> 00:51:39,137
-[sighs]
-Abalone porridge.

898
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:41,139
Ginger tea.

899
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,100
You got all that for me.

900
00:51:45,185 --> 00:51:48,104
You even lied about
being allergic to abalone.

901
00:51:48,605 --> 00:51:49,648
[chuckles]

902
00:51:49,731 --> 00:51:50,816
[sighs]

903
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:54,903
Even earlier, you made sure to put
all the good food in front of me.

904
00:51:54,986 --> 00:51:57,322
You were worried I'd hurt my head
and covered the table corner.

905
00:51:57,405 --> 00:52:00,075
-But you pretended like it was nothing.
-Hold on.

906
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,451
Seriously!

907
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,037
[Ji-hyeok] That was because I…

908
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,539
[Da-rim] I know.

909
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,749
You're nice to me

910
00:52:09,417 --> 00:52:13,004
only because I'm a member of your team.

911
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,257
But still…

912
00:52:19,594 --> 00:52:20,637
[sucks teeth]

913
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:25,016
I find myself being swayed.

914
00:52:28,395 --> 00:52:29,729
You know…

915
00:52:31,898 --> 00:52:33,692
the nicer you are to me,

916
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:37,904
the happier I am, but it's also hard.

917
00:52:37,988 --> 00:52:39,739
[inhales deeply]

918
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:41,366
[sighs]

919
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:44,160
Because I know I don't deserve it.

920
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:48,331
So…

921
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,839
don't be nice to me.

922
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,344
I'll also promise…

923
00:53:04,431 --> 00:53:06,391
not to be swayed after today.

924
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,989
[sighs, groans]

925
00:53:47,682 --> 00:53:48,975
[groans]

926
00:53:56,816 --> 00:53:57,817
[mutters]

927
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,966
Chew your food thoroughly.

928
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,050
Good.

929
00:54:22,717 --> 00:54:25,261
Sorry. I saw all the missed calls
from you last night.

930
00:54:25,345 --> 00:54:27,138
I was too drunk to check my phone.

931
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:28,640
It's fine.

932
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,227
Here you go.

933
00:54:32,811 --> 00:54:34,104
[Da-rim gasps]

934
00:54:34,187 --> 00:54:36,564
Wow, dried pollack soup.

935
00:54:38,566 --> 00:54:40,276
[Seon-u] Have some kimchi too, son.

936
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,030
Man, that hits the spot.

937
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:46,491
Who brought you home last night?

938
00:54:48,034 --> 00:54:49,077
Last night?

939
00:54:50,078 --> 00:54:51,788
I took a taxi home.

940
00:54:51,871 --> 00:54:54,040
I probably did.

941
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:55,917
Yeah, I did.

942
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:59,212
From now on, just call me
if you think you're going to drink a lot.

943
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:00,463
[in English] Okay.

944
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:02,757
[sighs]

945
00:55:07,387 --> 00:55:08,888
-Jin-hui.
-Oh, thank you.

946
00:55:08,972 --> 00:55:10,473
[in Korean] This is the problem with wine.

947
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:12,350
It feels like my head is swaying nonstop.

948
00:55:12,434 --> 00:55:14,519
Even my intestines are swaying.
I feel like I'm dying.

949
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,104
Are you okay, Da-rim?

950
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:18,815
[groans] It also feels like I'm swaying…

951
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,568
I find myself being swayed.

952
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,486
Don't be nice to me.

953
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,698
What was that?

954
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:31,494
Ms. Jang, you'll be in charge of
recruiting people for the tree-planting.

955
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:33,913
-Okay.
-Ms. Bae and Ms. Lee,

956
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:36,958
you'll secure the event venue and request
cooperation from public institutions.

957
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,919
Ms. Go, you can prepare the press release.

958
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,422
-Got it.
-By the way, where's Mr. Gong?

959
00:55:42,505 --> 00:55:44,257
He's in a meeting
with the CSR team leader.

960
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,094
Considering the scale of the project,
we'll need to collaborate with them.

961
00:55:48,178 --> 00:55:49,596
After always supporting other teams,

962
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,890
we're finally at the receiving end
of support.

963
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,267
That's the power
of being in a lead department.

964
00:55:54,350 --> 00:55:55,351
Oh… [chuckles]

965
00:55:55,435 --> 00:55:57,937
I guess winning that pitch
wasn't all good.

966
00:55:58,021 --> 00:56:00,648
In the end, we need to do everything
we said we'd do.

967
00:56:00,732 --> 00:56:02,650
[sighs] I know, right?

968
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,402
I'm happy, but this is hard…

969
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,863
The nicer you are to me,

970
00:56:06,946 --> 00:56:08,698
the happier I am, but it's also hard.

971
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,950
I'll also promise
not to be swayed after today.

972
00:56:13,953 --> 00:56:15,413
[gasps, screams]

973
00:56:15,497 --> 00:56:16,873
-What? What's wrong?
-What is it?

974
00:56:16,956 --> 00:56:17,999
-What?
-Is it a cockroach?

975
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:19,209
-What?
-Where is it?

976
00:56:21,086 --> 00:56:22,754
Please excuse me.
I need to use the bathroom.

977
00:56:23,546 --> 00:56:24,547
[Gyeong-min] Go ahead.

978
00:56:27,300 --> 00:56:28,676
Could it have been a dream?

979
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,515
Wait. Did I mess up? [gasps]

980
00:56:39,854 --> 00:56:41,523
Excuse me, Mr. Gong.

981
00:56:43,441 --> 00:56:44,442
Yes?

982
00:56:44,526 --> 00:56:46,653
So…

983
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:50,281
About last night…

984
00:56:51,741 --> 00:56:52,826
Did I…

985
00:56:53,493 --> 00:56:55,995
Did we…

986
00:56:57,831 --> 00:57:00,333
Should I ask this or not?

987
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:06,172
Did you pay for my taxi fare?

988
00:57:06,756 --> 00:57:08,091
The taxi fare?

989
00:57:08,174 --> 00:57:11,845
Yes, I blacked out last night,
so I don't remember a thing.

990
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,265
I was wondering if you paid for it.

991
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:17,559
You don't remember?

992
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:21,813
-None of it?
-No, I don't remember a single thing.

993
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,315
I see.

994
00:57:25,108 --> 00:57:27,193
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

995
00:57:28,319 --> 00:57:29,696
I don't remember either.

996
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:32,157
I also blacked out.

997
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:35,577
You don't remember either?
Not a single thing?

998
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:37,787
Nothing.

999
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:39,956
[sighs]

1000
00:57:40,039 --> 00:57:42,917
I guess you're a lightweight too.

1001
00:57:43,001 --> 00:57:45,420
You should cut down on drinking.

1002
00:57:45,503 --> 00:57:47,464
All right, well, have a nice day.

1003
00:57:54,471 --> 00:57:55,555
Don't be nice to me.

1004
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:59,851
I'll also promise
not to be swayed after today.

1005
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:07,233
[sighs]

1006
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,321
[sighs]

1007
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,156
[phone buzzes]

1008
00:58:13,239 --> 00:58:16,910
YU TAE-YEONG

1009
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:21,706
-[tsks]
-[door opens]

1010
00:58:22,373 --> 00:58:23,917
-[door closes]
-[Jong-gu] Ms. Gong!

1011
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,835
Ms. Gong. [pants]

1012
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:30,507
I've acquired a hidden card
that will completely overturn

1013
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:31,841
the results of the presentation.

1014
00:58:31,925 --> 00:58:33,176
What hidden card?

1015
00:58:33,259 --> 00:58:35,011
Please take a look.

1016
00:58:35,637 --> 00:58:37,722
I'm busy enough as it is.

1017
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,560
What about it? Who is that?

1018
00:58:42,644 --> 00:58:44,103
Take a closer look.

1019
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,523
This is Go Da-rim from the Mother TF Team,

1020
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:48,149
and that's Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

1021
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,944
A scandalous affair
between a married woman

1022
00:58:51,027 --> 00:58:52,695
and the chairman's son.

1023
00:58:52,779 --> 00:58:55,949
[exclaims] This should be more than enough

1024
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:57,992
to get rid of the Mother TF Team

1025
00:58:58,076 --> 00:59:01,246
and even call off the marriage
with Taeyu C&T!

1026
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,206
Wait, but look at this.

1027
00:59:03,289 --> 00:59:06,960
You can't really see their faces.
Are you sure it's them?

1028
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,127
Hold on.

1029
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:11,297
It has to be Go Da-rim.

1030
00:59:11,381 --> 00:59:14,050
That's Go Da-rim and Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok.

1031
00:59:14,133 --> 00:59:18,471
Anyhow, my team's youngest saw them
with their own eyes.

1032
00:59:19,514 --> 00:59:20,848
So?

1033
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,100
Should I release it?

1034
00:59:24,978 --> 00:59:27,480
If we're going to release it,
we should do it properly.

1035
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:32,610
Keep an eye on these two
and collect more evidence,

1036
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,446
so they can't talk their way out of it.

1037
00:59:36,447 --> 00:59:37,448
Concrete evidence.

1038
00:59:38,032 --> 00:59:39,158
Understood.

1039
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,082
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

1040
00:59:51,879 --> 00:59:53,006
[sighs]

1041
00:59:57,885 --> 00:59:59,262
[Ji-hyeok] What are you up to?

1042
00:59:59,345 --> 01:00:01,889
Oh. I'm writing up the draft
for the press release.

1043
01:00:01,973 --> 01:00:03,850
I just want to work on it a bit more.

1044
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,518
Have a good night.

1045
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,562
How can it take so long to do this?

1046
01:00:08,896 --> 01:00:10,148
Hmm…

1047
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:15,153
This reads more like a list of slogans
than a press release.

1048
01:00:16,988 --> 01:00:18,281
Does it?

1049
01:00:18,364 --> 01:00:19,866
Excuse me.

1050
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,077
Take a look at this online article.

1051
01:00:23,161 --> 01:00:26,289
You can see the headline, lead, and body.

1052
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:28,625
Right?

1053
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,168
-The content includes…
-Yes.

1054
01:00:30,251 --> 01:00:33,880
-…the who, what, and how.
-The who…

1055
01:00:33,963 --> 01:00:34,964
The how.

1056
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:38,301
-And second…
-Yes.

1057
01:00:38,384 --> 01:00:40,928
-…try combining two or three key terms…
-Okay.

1058
01:00:41,012 --> 01:00:43,431
…from the lead
with some creative expressions.

1059
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,058
-Got it.
-Yes.

1060
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,395
There should be a file
of past press releases.

1061
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:51,731
Hold on.

1062
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,107
Hmm? Okay.

1063
01:01:06,913 --> 01:01:08,039
[chuckles]

1064
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,165
[groans]

1065
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,000
-[door closes]
-[groans]

1066
01:01:14,712 --> 01:01:16,923
[Ji-hyeok] Da-rim, are you feeling sick?

1067
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:18,049
No.

1068
01:01:18,132 --> 01:01:19,926
-Look at me.
-[groans]

1069
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,430
-Let's get you to a hospital.
-No, I'm really fine.

1070
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:26,265
Don't worry about me.

1071
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:27,892
I just need some medicine.

1072
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:29,018
Just listen to me!

1073
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,187
Why are you being stubborn
when you're in pain?

1074
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,941
I don't want to trouble you.

1075
01:01:36,025 --> 01:01:38,361
I don't think I should do that anymore.

1076
01:01:39,278 --> 01:01:40,279
Did you forget?

1077
01:01:42,281 --> 01:01:43,825
All your organs are mine.

1078
01:01:44,617 --> 01:01:45,827
I'm going to do

1079
01:01:46,411 --> 01:01:47,662
whatever I want with them.

1080
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,164
So just do as I say.

1081
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:54,752
[romantic music plays]

1082
01:02:14,063 --> 01:02:18,276
EMERGENCY ROOM

1083
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,993
[doctor] It's stress-induced
stomach cramps.

1084
01:02:27,076 --> 01:02:29,412
It appears she's been
under a lot of stress recently.

1085
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:30,955
She should be fine soon,

1086
01:02:31,038 --> 01:02:32,957
and she can be discharged
when she wakes up.

1087
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,793
We'll see how she does on the prescription
and bring her in for a follow-up.

1088
01:02:58,816 --> 01:02:59,817
Yeah.

1089
01:03:02,069 --> 01:03:03,237
You're right.

1090
01:03:05,823 --> 01:03:07,158
It's because you're my team member.

1091
01:03:11,037 --> 01:03:12,497
There's no other reason.

1092
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,460
So don't let this sway you…

1093
01:03:21,297 --> 01:03:22,381
or trouble you.

1094
01:03:27,762 --> 01:03:31,140
[phone buzzing]

1095
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:43,569
[music pauses]

1096
01:03:45,905 --> 01:03:49,283
SEON-U

1097
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,454
But right now,

1098
01:03:55,122 --> 01:03:56,707
I want to be the only one…

1099
01:03:58,626 --> 01:04:00,127
to protect you.

1100
01:04:02,255 --> 01:04:03,422
I want to be…

1101
01:04:05,383 --> 01:04:06,717
the only one by your side.

1102
01:04:11,931 --> 01:04:13,224
[button clicks]

1103
01:04:13,307 --> 01:04:14,767
[buzzing stops]

1104
01:04:14,851 --> 01:04:16,018
I think…

1105
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,062
I've lost my mind.

1106
01:04:18,563 --> 01:04:20,147
[music resumes]

1107
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:45,798
DYNAMITE KISS

1108
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:20,082
[Da-rim] You didn't go home
and stayed by my side?

1109
01:05:20,166 --> 01:05:21,709
[Ji-hyeok] You're being looked out for.

1110
01:05:21,792 --> 01:05:22,919
And despite the distance,
the worry remains.

1111
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,629
[Seon-u]
It looks to me like you and Mr. Gong

1112
01:05:24,712 --> 01:05:27,381
are more than just a team leader
and a team member.

1113
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,091
Go Da-rim!

1114
01:05:30,509 --> 01:05:32,511
What do you think you're doing?

1115
01:05:35,181 --> 01:05:37,558
[Da-rim] Can I get Mr. Gong's address?

1116
01:05:37,642 --> 01:05:39,852
Does your husband know you're here?

1117
01:05:39,936 --> 01:05:43,022
[Da-rim] I just thought it could maybe
provide some comfort and strength.

1118
01:05:43,105 --> 01:05:44,774
[Ji-hyeok] And people call that an affair.

1119
01:05:44,857 --> 01:05:47,109
I'm not a good person.

1120
01:05:47,693 --> 01:05:50,071
I'm also swayed.

1121
01:05:51,197 --> 01:05:55,868
