1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:55,305
Gosh, I don't like the sight of that.
Put that thing down already.

3
00:00:55,388 --> 00:00:57,891
I can't. I'm testing the prototype.

4
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:00,685
But you're taking it too far.

5
00:01:00,769 --> 00:01:04,272
Earlier, the supermarket lady whispered
to me and asked if you had a baby.

6
00:01:04,898 --> 00:01:07,108
How nice would it be
if it really were your grandchild?

7
00:01:07,192 --> 00:01:08,526
Maybe in a million years.

8
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,361
Even marriage is shooting for the stars.

9
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:12,030
Not at all, we--

10
00:01:12,113 --> 00:01:14,324
-What's wrong with you?
-What?

11
00:01:15,533 --> 00:01:16,993
-Yes?
-What was that for?

12
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:22,165
I have something to tell you.

13
00:01:24,125 --> 00:01:25,126
You see,

14
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,045
I love Da-rim very much.

15
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:28,588
Oh my.

16
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:35,678
I'd like to marry her.

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,057
I want to become your son-in-law.

18
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:41,726
My son-in-law?

19
00:01:45,522 --> 00:01:47,899
What wonderful news!

20
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,777
I couldn't have asked
for a better moving-away present.

21
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,489
Don't they make such a good couple?

22
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:56,574
Right.

23
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:58,660
Well, they do, but…

24
00:01:59,285 --> 00:02:01,746
Let's all eat this first.

25
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,165
You can relax.

26
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:10,130
I think your mother

27
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,632
might not be too fond of me.

28
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:13,633
Come on.

29
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:15,844
She was just caught off guard.

30
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,429
It looked like she was
completely charmed by you.

31
00:02:19,597 --> 00:02:20,932
-Really?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,311
My mom likes handsome guys too.

33
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:35,864
Having it all out in the open

34
00:02:36,906 --> 00:02:37,866
feels nice.

35
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,284
Yeah.

36
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:41,828
Once the baby carrier is released,

37
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:44,455
everything will come to a nice close.

38
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:06,728
DYNAMITE KISS

39
00:03:07,353 --> 00:03:09,355
It's finally here.

40
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,317
Natural BeBe's first baby carrier.

41
00:03:13,568 --> 00:03:16,112
That's right,
it's the baby carrier we created.

42
00:03:16,195 --> 00:03:19,282
This is exactly how I felt
when I gave birth to my first son.

43
00:03:19,365 --> 00:03:20,199
My goodness.

44
00:03:22,118 --> 00:03:23,536
You know the feeling, right?

45
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:25,914
This will be out on the market
next week, right?

46
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,040
I'm not dreaming, am I?

47
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:30,752
Now, now.

48
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,420
You all worked really hard.

49
00:03:32,503 --> 00:03:34,631
I'm sure we'll see positive results.

50
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:36,591
Mr. Gong!

51
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,802
Mr. Gong! You all need to look at this.

52
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:41,721
This came out so nicely.

53
00:03:42,263 --> 00:03:43,348
Look at it.

54
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,061
This is the same as our prototype.

55
00:03:48,144 --> 00:03:50,521
We never placed an order for this color.

56
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:54,150
This is a new product
that MomsJoy released this morning.

57
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:55,985
What?

58
00:03:57,987 --> 00:04:00,740
Who's Go Da-rim?

59
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,326
I'm Go Da-rim.

60
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,537
You're Go Da-rim?

61
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,166
Oh my!

62
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,303
What do you think you're doing?

63
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,431
You dare set foot in my company?

64
00:04:25,515 --> 00:04:26,432
Get her out of here.

65
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:30,353
Oh my goodness.

66
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:33,940
You fool. Do you still not get it?

67
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,608
Who do you think leaked that?

68
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,110
Go Da-rim is a spy!

69
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,835
There's a record of this email
being sent to MomsJoy from your computer.

70
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,128
Will you still deny it?

71
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:57,672
This must be an error.

72
00:04:58,298 --> 00:04:59,173
Either that

73
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:02,135
or someone secretly used my computer.

74
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:08,016
I can confidently say

75
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:12,020
that I put my heart and soul
into developing this new product.

76
00:05:12,103 --> 00:05:14,314
So why would I just give that away?

77
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,316
Then can you explain this?

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:24,824
You even had a resignation letter
prepared in advance.

79
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:28,161
You got this job as a corporate spy
in the first place, didn't you?

80
00:05:29,329 --> 00:05:31,539
Were you looking to score big and bail?

81
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,751
That's not what happened.
What do you take me for?

82
00:05:37,378 --> 00:05:39,672
You were the one
who lied about being married

83
00:05:39,756 --> 00:05:41,924
and committed fraud to get the job.

84
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,804
So you knew she lied to get hired
and let it slide?

85
00:05:46,888 --> 00:05:47,722
Yes.

86
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:51,100
So I'll take responsibility for that.

87
00:05:53,102 --> 00:05:53,936
But

88
00:05:54,771 --> 00:05:57,065
framing her for being a spy
when she didn't do anything?

89
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,566
That's absolutely unacceptable.

90
00:05:58,649 --> 00:06:00,818
Do you know how much we lost
from this new product leak?

91
00:06:01,486 --> 00:06:03,863
This isn't the time for coddling.
What are you thinking?

92
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,781
Father.

93
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,492
I doubt Ji-hyeok

94
00:06:08,367 --> 00:06:09,952
can think rationally right now.

95
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:14,874
I've received these photos
from an anonymous sender.

96
00:06:22,048 --> 00:06:22,965
It appears

97
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:26,219
Ms. Go didn't just steal
our trade secrets,

98
00:06:26,302 --> 00:06:28,262
but also Ji-hyeok's heart.

99
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,726
You idiot.

100
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,523
Fire Go Da-rim, and cover this up.

101
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,275
That seems to be the only way out.

102
00:06:41,359 --> 00:06:42,193
No.

103
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:44,195
I can't let you do that.

104
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:47,698
I love that woman.

105
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,367
Love?

106
00:06:52,161 --> 00:06:53,037
Ji-hyeok.

107
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:55,581
This is

108
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,501
a crucial moment in your life.

109
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,253
You're just going to give up

110
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:02,797
on being promoted to vice president
and our joint venture with Taeyu C&T?

111
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,382
All because of a woman like her?

112
00:07:05,925 --> 00:07:07,760
Emotions like that are fleeting.

113
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,721
Money, power, and companies
are what last to be passed down.

114
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,348
Think wisely!

115
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,561
I'll handle the investigation.

116
00:07:26,487 --> 00:07:27,864
-Is that her?
-Yeah.

117
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,073
-It is her, right?
-That's her?

118
00:07:29,157 --> 00:07:30,283
Yes, that's her.

119
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,410
She lied to get her position
on the Mother TF Team.

120
00:07:32,493 --> 00:07:34,537
-What a fraud.
-How shameless.

121
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,205
I heard she's even spying on us.

122
00:07:36,289 --> 00:07:37,957
-How shameless.
-The absolute nerve.

123
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:40,084
-She seduced the team leader.
-Look. It's her.

124
00:07:40,710 --> 00:07:41,919
Why does she live like that?

125
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,342
You shouldn't be doing this.

126
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:31,511
People are staring.

127
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:33,471
I don't care.

128
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,231
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:44,482 --> 00:08:46,859
Why would you be sorry?

130
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,945
What did the auditor say?

131
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,782
You must've been scared all alone.

132
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:56,827
I felt so wronged,

133
00:08:57,745 --> 00:08:59,372
but there was nothing I could say.

134
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,959
If I were him, I'd think I was guilty too.

135
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:06,712
They said I should stop working

136
00:09:07,588 --> 00:09:08,798
and go home for now.

137
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:14,804
Don't worry too much.

138
00:09:16,097 --> 00:09:17,265
I'll do whatever it takes

139
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,975
and take care of it all.

140
00:09:37,368 --> 00:09:39,245
Well, I was right, wasn't I?

141
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,162
Yeah.

142
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,165
It totally played out the way we expected.

143
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,835
This is so thrilling!

144
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,088
Don't get too excited.

145
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:50,715
The climax has yet to come.

146
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:52,967
The climax?

147
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:01,517
You worked hard.

148
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,936
Go Da-rim

149
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:06,731
and then, Gong Ji-hyeok.

150
00:10:20,244 --> 00:10:21,412
Ms. Go.

151
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:26,208
Can we

152
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,586
talk for a moment?

153
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:38,012
I think we should prioritize
restoring the art hall's image

154
00:10:38,095 --> 00:10:39,180
that was damaged by the fire.

155
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,181
Sure, go ahead.

156
00:10:40,264 --> 00:10:42,850
We're thinking of "a new beginning"
as the theme for the next exhibition--

157
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:44,143
Sure, go ahead.

158
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,187
Ms. Yu.

159
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,023
-Ms. Yu?
-Go ahead.

160
00:10:52,693 --> 00:10:53,527
Yes?

161
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:55,529
You seem very tired.

162
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:59,033
I'm fine. Please continue.

163
00:10:59,116 --> 00:10:59,950
Well…

164
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,662
How would you like us to proceed?

165
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,418
-Did you have fun today?
-Yes.

166
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,420
-What'd you do?
-We drew pictures.

167
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,340
But…

168
00:11:16,133 --> 00:11:18,010
Did he already go home? Jeez.

169
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:19,470
Ms. Han?

170
00:11:19,553 --> 00:11:21,222
She looks like the pretty lady.

171
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:22,640
That's her mother.

172
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,933
Really?

173
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:25,476
Wait, Jun!

174
00:11:26,435 --> 00:11:27,853
Hello.

175
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,522
My name is Kim Jun.

176
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:37,488
Oh, I see.

177
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:38,406
Hello.

178
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:40,574
I hear you're the pretty lady's mom.

179
00:11:40,658 --> 00:11:41,659
"Pretty lady"?

180
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,661
I'm best friends with her.

181
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:45,955
Is that so?

182
00:11:48,874 --> 00:11:50,459
What are you doing?

183
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:51,877
What…

184
00:11:52,586 --> 00:11:53,754
Can you give this to her?

185
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,214
This?

186
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,719
This too.

187
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:02,972
MILK

188
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,432
This too?

189
00:12:04,515 --> 00:12:07,101
And make sure to tell her it's from Jun.

190
00:12:07,184 --> 00:12:08,060
I'm sorry.

191
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,980
Kim Jun, I told you to stop doing this.

192
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,481
She isn't coming back.

193
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,358
Okay.

194
00:12:14,859 --> 00:12:16,569
Why are you scolding the child?

195
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:20,739
He says he's best friends with Ha-yeong,
so why can't he give her a gift?

196
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,704
What am I even doing here?

197
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:27,746
My goodness.

198
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:29,790
Goodness gracious.

199
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:32,001
But what brings you here?

200
00:12:33,210 --> 00:12:34,545
Well…

201
00:12:35,754 --> 00:12:37,006
I came to see some land.

202
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,508
It's just a hobby.

203
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:42,553
Since we ran into each other,
how about a cup of tea?

204
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:43,929
I'm hungry.

205
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,014
You are?

206
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:47,183
What do you want to eat?

207
00:12:47,266 --> 00:12:49,059
All right, let's eat.

208
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:53,772
The adult should have a bite first.

209
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:54,732
Here you go.

210
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,073
All right.

211
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:06,243
Thanks.

212
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,703
Good job.

213
00:13:08,579 --> 00:13:10,331
Please feel free to have some
if you haven't eaten yet.

214
00:13:10,998 --> 00:13:13,125
Go on and eat.

215
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,545
What's wrong?

216
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,588
There's bread left.

217
00:13:20,341 --> 00:13:21,342
Have some of this too.

218
00:13:22,218 --> 00:13:23,761
-Chew thoroughly and eat slowly.
-Okay.

219
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:27,431
There are sausages, tomatoes,
and quail eggs.

220
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:39,693
Mr. Kim.

221
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:43,030
Are you aware
that Ha-yeong has feelings for you?

222
00:13:43,697 --> 00:13:44,865
You don't need to worry.

223
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,911
I can assure you
that Ms. Yu and I will never date.

224
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:54,875
Well, life is full of surprises.

225
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,252
No.

226
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:59,630
I made sure to make that clear to Ms. Yu,
so you don't need to worry.

227
00:14:00,548 --> 00:14:02,216
So that's why she's such a mess right now.

228
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:04,343
Hold on.

229
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:06,971
You keep telling me not to worry.

230
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,973
Who's worried here?

231
00:14:09,056 --> 00:14:10,724
You think I'm worried?

232
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,310
I didn't want to
make you worry needlessly.

233
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:14,228
Well, you're right about that.

234
00:14:14,812 --> 00:14:16,105
I am worried.

235
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,315
Mr. Kim,

236
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:20,067
you can't be so narrow-minded

237
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:22,111
if you want to survive
in this cruel world.

238
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,864
You need to be open-minded.
Ever heard of it?

239
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:28,158
-Pardon?
-You're still young.

240
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:32,162
You need to open your heart up
and date all sorts of people.

241
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,415
Why don't you like Ha-yeong?

242
00:14:35,249 --> 00:14:38,711
Well, I didn't mean
that I particularly disliked her…

243
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:41,505
By any chance,

244
00:14:42,631 --> 00:14:43,883
do you dislike chaebol families?

245
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:45,050
Do you not like money?

246
00:14:45,134 --> 00:14:47,845
Are you repulsed by the idea of a woman
buying you a house and a car,

247
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:49,930
and paying for trips abroad every season?

248
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:54,018
Does the idea of living in a great house
while never worrying about money

249
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,812
just make your skin crawl?

250
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,274
-Ms. Han.
-Yes?

251
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,317
I know Ha-yeong

252
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,903
has a pure heart with a kind soul.

253
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:05,946
That's why.

254
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:06,989
I mean…

255
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,658
That's more reason

256
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:14,914
for her to find someone who can
truly love her more than I ever can.

257
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:20,044
I'm not ready
to let someone into my life just yet.

258
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:25,883
I'm sorry.

259
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,906
Ji-hyeok.

260
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,075
I checked with security,

261
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:53,118
and the day the email was sent
from Da-rim's computer--

262
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:54,495
The security cameras were down, huh?

263
00:15:55,037 --> 00:15:56,413
How'd you know?

264
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:57,873
What about the recipient's email account?

265
00:15:58,958 --> 00:15:59,959
Here.

266
00:16:02,044 --> 00:16:02,920
But the thing is,

267
00:16:03,504 --> 00:16:05,589
the account has already been deleted.

268
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,387
Okay. First, have the investigation agency

269
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:14,098
search for social media accounts
with similar usernames

270
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:15,849
that belong to Koreans aged 30 or older,

271
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:18,978
who have been photographed
near MomsJoy's registered address.

272
00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,437
Got it. Koreans aged 30 or older.

273
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:23,107
Have them gather all posts tagged
"MomsJoy" and cross-check them

274
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:24,650
with the compiled list of usernames.

275
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:28,570
Also, have them check
all the accounts that commented

276
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:29,738
on MomsJoy's official accounts.

277
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,323
I'll have them start immediately.

278
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,292
GONG JI-HYE, YU TAE-YEONG

279
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,715
Just wait and see.

280
00:16:49,967 --> 00:16:51,969
I'll expose you all,

281
00:16:53,846 --> 00:16:55,305
even if I have to go
to the ends of the earth.

282
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:02,438
How much longer are you going to hold out?

283
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:04,273
Ms. Go Da-rim!

284
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,028
That's enough.

285
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:13,532
We're investigating internally
to uncover the truth.

286
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,577
Let's postpone the interview
for a few days.

287
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,871
You're looking to uncover the truth?

288
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,956
She was employed through fake credentials

289
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:24,126
and even secretly dated
her immediate supervisor.

290
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:26,795
Are there more truths
that need to be uncovered?

291
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:28,464
Ms. Go Da-rim.

292
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,801
Just confess to it now,
and stop making everyone's life hard.

293
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,970
That has nothing to do with the leak.

294
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:36,472
You can't accuse her like this
based on one email--

295
00:17:36,555 --> 00:17:38,474
He's right.

296
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,810
I did it.

297
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:49,860
I was the one who leaked the new product

298
00:17:50,903 --> 00:17:51,820
to a competitor.

299
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,865
-Da-rim.
-I did it alone.

300
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,451
Mr. Gong and the team members
knew nothing about it.

301
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:59,203
What are you saying right now?

302
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,788
Can we have a moment to talk alone?

303
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:01,914
No.

304
00:18:01,997 --> 00:18:03,165
I'd rather speak to you alone

305
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,709
without Mr. Gong present.

306
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,046
She wants to speak to me alone.

307
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,298
Follow me.

308
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:34,655
Of course, I believe you.

309
00:18:36,031 --> 00:18:39,326
I know how hard you've worked until now.

310
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,162
Ji-hyeok also told me
about how you had no choice

311
00:18:42,246 --> 00:18:43,622
but to lie about your identity.

312
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:45,833
It must've been so tough.

313
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:47,918
I appreciate it.

314
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:49,169
But what can we do?

315
00:18:49,753 --> 00:18:52,422
All the evidence just happens
to point to you as the culprit.

316
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:56,218
I know very well
what kind of person you are,

317
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,594
but the shareholders don't.

318
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,222
The shareholders?

319
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,392
There will be
a shareholders' meeting soon.

320
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:05,310
The original plan

321
00:19:05,394 --> 00:19:07,896
was to have Ji-hyeok be promoted
to vice president then.

322
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:10,732
It's basically a successor announcement.

323
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,654
It's unfortunate that something like this
had to happen

324
00:19:16,446 --> 00:19:17,531
at such a crucial moment.

325
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:20,492
Could Mr. Gong
be negatively affected by this?

326
00:19:20,576 --> 00:19:21,952
Very much so.

327
00:19:22,035 --> 00:19:25,789
As the successor, he must be
the most impartial and level-headed.

328
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,543
But he knowingly overlooked
a team member's fraudulent hiring.

329
00:19:29,626 --> 00:19:32,546
He covered for a corporate spy
out of personal feelings.

330
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:33,839
Or…

331
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,467
did the two of them conspire
to leak company secrets?

332
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:40,429
Forget vice president.

333
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,931
He'd be immediately dismissed
from his current position.

334
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,100
I'm really sorry,

335
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:47,603
but you're the only one who can stop this.

336
00:19:48,645 --> 00:19:49,813
How can I stop it?

337
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:50,731
You just need to

338
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,151
take the fall for everything.

339
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:57,988
Are you suggesting

340
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,408
I make a false confession?

341
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,161
-Even so, that seems a bit--
-Think about it.

342
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,454
If the investigation drags on,

343
00:20:05,537 --> 00:20:08,582
Ji-hyeok would escalate things
just to protect you.

344
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:13,337
His reputation in the industry
will plummet the more he keeps doing that.

345
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:15,672
Even if he goes back to consulting,

346
00:20:16,381 --> 00:20:19,009
who would hire someone
fired by his own father's company

347
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,677
for corruption?

348
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,473
Not to mention,

349
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,352
if you deny it until the end,

350
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,854
knowing the chairman's personality,

351
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,983
he'll tear apart the Mother TF Team.

352
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,152
Even if there's no evidence,

353
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:39,446
suspicion alone is enough for him
to fire the whole team.

354
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:41,531
They're just interns
at the end of the day.

355
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,201
Why would he go after the team?

356
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,871
They all worked really hard
in hopes of becoming full-time.

357
00:20:48,622 --> 00:20:49,581
Exactly.

358
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:52,125
You're leaving soon anyway.

359
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:55,712
For the sake of Ji-hyeok
and the rest of the team members,

360
00:20:57,422 --> 00:20:58,340
could you

361
00:20:59,633 --> 00:21:01,009
help them out a little?

362
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,984
Ms. Go.

363
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:18,485
You just need to review this

364
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,321
and sign at the bottom.

365
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:25,742
We wrote down exactly what you said.

366
00:21:25,826 --> 00:21:29,246
2. FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES
3. ADMISSION AND REFLECTION

367
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,211
STATEMENT BY: GO DA-RIM

368
00:21:38,588 --> 00:21:39,798
You made the right choice.

369
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,602
Is Da-rim still being questioned?

370
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:54,896
I hope she'll be okay.

371
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,857
Of course, she'll be fine.

372
00:21:57,441 --> 00:22:00,944
She did make a mistake,
but to call her a spy…

373
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:02,654
That's nonsense.

374
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:04,114
Damn it.

375
00:22:04,197 --> 00:22:06,533
The chairman just slapped her
out of nowhere.

376
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:09,995
As soon as her innocence is proven,

377
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,621
I'll go to that chairman or whatever

378
00:22:11,705 --> 00:22:13,790
and give him a piece of my mind.

379
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:16,793
Seriously, what are we going to do

380
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,879
with our stay-at-home moms?

381
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:22,090
She was clearly a spy.

382
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:26,219
You coddled her
without knowing who she really was.

383
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,305
Serves you right.

384
00:22:28,388 --> 00:22:31,183
Who are you calling a spy?
Da-rim would never do such a thing!

385
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:35,854
Goodness me, that's why
you were stabbed in the back.

386
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:39,274
Anyway, just know that the company
took a major blow because of her.

387
00:22:39,357 --> 00:22:41,359
You all need to take responsibility
for this too!

388
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:46,656
Responsibility?

389
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,783
We'll take responsibility.

390
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:49,284
But what if she's innocent?

391
00:22:49,367 --> 00:22:51,578
If she is, will you take responsibility?

392
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:53,080
What did you say?

393
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,373
Sure, I'll take responsibility.

394
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:58,919
How dare an intern
glare at a team leader like that?

395
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:00,253
Glaring?

396
00:23:00,337 --> 00:23:02,005
My eyes are just naturally like this.

397
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,758
-Yes, her eyes are always like that.
-That's right.

398
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,927
-You're insulting her appearance.
-What?

399
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,012
-Yeah.
-That's sexual harassment!

400
00:23:09,096 --> 00:23:10,722
-Yeah!
-Sexual harassment!

401
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,182
-Fine.
-Unbelievable.

402
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:13,850
-Let's end this today!
-What's wrong with you?

403
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,020
-You should watch what you say!
-No way.

404
00:23:17,104 --> 00:23:18,355
Go Da-rim confessed.

405
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:19,815
What was that?

406
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,739
Mom.

407
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,116
Hey, Ha-yeong.

408
00:23:31,493 --> 00:23:32,744
What are you up to?

409
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,287
I was just sitting here. Why?

410
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,205
Listen.

411
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:37,833
I want to go to the US.

412
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:40,752
Sure. A trip might do you some good.

413
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,212
No.

414
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:44,631
I want to study abroad.

415
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,591
I want to get that degree I never got.

416
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,010
I'll get married later.

417
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:51,263
Then what about Mr. Kim?

418
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,681
You're giving up?

419
00:23:54,641 --> 00:23:57,144
He seemed like a good guy
when I talked to him.

420
00:23:58,061 --> 00:23:59,396
You met with him?

421
00:23:59,479 --> 00:24:02,274
What now?
How did you harass him this time?

422
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:05,110
I didn't harass him.

423
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:07,195
You were sulking around all day,

424
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,490
so I just went to see him to find out
if something had happened between you two.

425
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,950
Why would you do that?

426
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:16,413
Forget it.

427
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:20,750
Pursuing him when he doesn't like me
will only make his life harder.

428
00:24:22,335 --> 00:24:23,170
I'm leaving

429
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,755
to forget about Mr. Kim.

430
00:24:26,631 --> 00:24:28,800
I'll get ready to go back to school.

431
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:35,849
But…

432
00:24:39,603 --> 00:24:40,645
you should take this with you.

433
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,480
He wanted you to have it.

434
00:24:45,859 --> 00:24:46,860
This too.

435
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:47,903
MILK

436
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,212
Jun.

437
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,130
Did you know?

438
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,759
I had more fun

439
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,845
at your talent show
than I've ever had at any party.

440
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:34,366
I've never liked Gong Ji-hyeok
from the start.

441
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,618
He just came out of nowhere

442
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:38,578
with that useless CSR initiative
and tree planting nonsense.

443
00:25:39,663 --> 00:25:40,997
You're right.

444
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:46,127
It was a project
Executive Director Kim In-ae used to lead.

445
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:49,965
So if Mr. Gong becomes the successor,

446
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:51,007
he's bound to

447
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,095
bring back her people, no?

448
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:58,265
Then what does that mean for us?

449
00:25:58,348 --> 00:26:00,225
Ji-hyeok's biggest supporter

450
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:02,602
is none other than Chairman Gong.

451
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,437
As long as he's in power,

452
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:07,065
Ji-hyeok will do
what he must to get rid of me

453
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:10,402
and all of you as well.

454
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,364
What? He's going to clean house?

455
00:26:14,864 --> 00:26:16,992
Who does he think grew this company
to what it is now?

456
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:18,201
Absolutely.

457
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,204
This is just pure nonsense.

458
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:25,625
Then should we strike first
before he gets a chance to attack us?

459
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,127
After all,

460
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:30,463
the shareholders' meeting
is right around the corner.

461
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:31,673
How about we bring forth

462
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:35,510
a motion to dismiss the chairman then?

463
00:26:35,593 --> 00:26:38,263
-A motion to dismiss him?
-Dismissal? Is that even possible?

464
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,807
-That might be pushing it.
-Right?

465
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,018
For such a motion to pass,

466
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:45,437
you'd need the approval
of at least two-thirds

467
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,063
of the shareholders present at the meeting

468
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:49,190
and at least one-third
of the total issued shares.

469
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,736
You have more than enough here to pass
the attending shareholder vote,

470
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:55,739
but securing one-third
of the total shares will be a challenge.

471
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,365
The recent paid-in capital increase

472
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,535
led to more foreign investors
and minor shareholders.

473
00:27:00,618 --> 00:27:02,829
Getting them on board won't be easy.

474
00:27:05,749 --> 00:27:06,750
My goodness.

475
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:08,376
Hello.

476
00:27:15,258 --> 00:27:16,801
You all seem rather concerned.

477
00:27:23,475 --> 00:27:25,185
Please allow me to explain that to you.

478
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,738
You will be redirected to voicemail,
and charges will apply after the beep.

479
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:37,781
She's not picking up, is she?

480
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,493
Her phone's turned off.

481
00:27:41,576 --> 00:27:46,956
I mean, she should loop us in
so we can protect her or fight for her.

482
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,917
She must have her reasons.

483
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,502
Should we just go to her place?

484
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,712
Her address should be
in her personnel file.

485
00:27:52,796 --> 00:27:53,630
I'll go with you.

486
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,007
-Me too.
-No, just give her some space.

487
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,844
If a visit were to solve all this,
she would've already told us everything.

488
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,262
She just needs time.

489
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:16,152
Da-rim.

490
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,239
Mr. Gong… I mean, Ji-hyeok's here.

491
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:21,199
Don't let him in.

492
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,040
That's right.

493
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,542
I did it.

494
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:34,212
I had to quit after this project,

495
00:28:34,963 --> 00:28:37,298
but I didn't get a single callback
from any company.

496
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,926
And their terms weren't bad.

497
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:43,638
They offered a lot of money and a job.

498
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:45,432
You're lying.

499
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:46,808
I'm not lying.

500
00:28:47,392 --> 00:28:48,393
I really did it.

501
00:28:48,476 --> 00:28:50,979
You'd never do such a thing.

502
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:52,605
Did you forget who I was?

503
00:28:52,689 --> 00:28:54,733
I didn't hesitate to lie about being a mom

504
00:28:55,275 --> 00:28:57,652
just to get a job and make money.

505
00:28:57,736 --> 00:28:58,570
No.

506
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:01,114
The Da-rim I know…

507
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:05,034
would stop arguing on the street

508
00:29:06,286 --> 00:29:08,872
to help a stranger pick up tangerines
off the ground

509
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:12,083
and gladly throw herself to save the child

510
00:29:13,126 --> 00:29:14,294
of someone who harassed her.

511
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,256
She'd jump into a pool

512
00:29:18,339 --> 00:29:20,633
to save her teammates' jobs
when she can't even swim.

513
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,803
She even jumped into a fire to save me.

514
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,475
So how am I supposed to believe that?

515
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,272
If you're doing this for my sake,

516
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,399
you don't need to.

517
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,027
As long as I have you--

518
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,195
Let's…

519
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:42,572
break up.

520
00:29:50,538 --> 00:29:51,498
Don't do this.

521
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:54,626
You have me.

522
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:59,088
Why do you insist on suffering alone?

523
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:00,381
Just trust me and--

524
00:30:00,465 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm suffering because of you.

525
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,844
Do you not get it?

526
00:30:04,928 --> 00:30:05,762
Listen.

527
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:08,264
If it weren't for you,

528
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,683
I would've lived a quiet, uneventful life.

529
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:13,478
But because I got involved with you,

530
00:30:13,561 --> 00:30:15,063
I was constantly anxious
and had to walk on eggshells,

531
00:30:15,647 --> 00:30:18,107
and now, everyone knows
I lied to get that job.

532
00:30:19,526 --> 00:30:20,735
I know.

533
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:22,111
I brought this on myself.

534
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,241
I'm getting punished for acting out
without knowing my place.

535
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,328
But having to show myself in this state

536
00:30:30,995 --> 00:30:32,789
to you and the rest of the team

537
00:30:33,456 --> 00:30:35,583
is so degrading and humiliating.

538
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,294
That's what I find even more unbearable.

539
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:41,589
So…

540
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:45,009
let's just end things here.

541
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,263
Let's each go back to where we belong.

542
00:30:50,306 --> 00:30:51,391
Da-rim.

543
00:30:54,227 --> 00:30:55,144
This is me…

544
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:57,981
at rock bottom.

545
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,322
Da-rim.

546
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,284
Wake up, Da-rim.

547
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,205
What are you doing?
You should be getting ready for work.

548
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,042
Wake up, my little princess.

549
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:06,841
Mom.

550
00:32:11,846 --> 00:32:13,348
What were you thinking?

551
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:14,599
How could you do that?

552
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:18,978
I didn't have any other option.

553
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,899
The bank said they'd take the house
if I didn't pay back the loan.

554
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:26,486
I had to pay the hospital bills
and Da-jeong's private loan.

555
00:32:27,278 --> 00:32:29,864
Part-time jobs wouldn't have covered them.

556
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:32,408
I know it was wrong…

557
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,537
but I had no other choice.

558
00:32:36,621 --> 00:32:38,414
Even so.

559
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:44,253
How could you lie
about something like that for a job?

560
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,845
What did Mr. Gong say?

561
00:32:54,555 --> 00:32:56,057
I told him we should break up.

562
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:58,768
He knew I lied

563
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:01,771
and still covered for me,

564
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,773
and now he's in a tight spot.

565
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,364
Mom.

566
00:33:11,447 --> 00:33:12,949
You don't need to worry.

567
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,118
I'll pull myself together

568
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,078
and find a job.

569
00:33:17,578 --> 00:33:20,790
You just focus on staying healthy, okay?

570
00:33:21,582 --> 00:33:22,667
Let's sell the house.

571
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,006
Sell this house and pay off the debt.

572
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,008
Mom.

573
00:33:31,467 --> 00:33:33,428
What are you talking about?

574
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,931
Even if we sell this house,

575
00:33:37,015 --> 00:33:39,726
we'll have nothing left
after we pay back Seon-u's deposit.

576
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,603
And this house

577
00:33:42,687 --> 00:33:44,856
isn't something we can just sell off.

578
00:33:46,024 --> 00:33:49,318
It's filled with the memories Dad left us.

579
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:51,279
Who cares about any of that?

580
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,364
I didn't even know

581
00:33:54,073 --> 00:33:55,700
you were living through that hell.

582
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:02,665
You must have suffered so much,
having to carry all that burden alone.

583
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,171
I'm…

584
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:11,215
really sorry.

585
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,971
I'm sure your dad
would want us to do the same.

586
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:20,850
Mom.

587
00:34:23,019 --> 00:34:23,936
It's settled.

588
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:26,898
Let's take care of everything

589
00:34:27,607 --> 00:34:29,358
and head to your aunt's place
in the countryside.

590
00:34:30,068 --> 00:34:31,611
You need to recharge as well.

591
00:34:33,029 --> 00:34:33,905
You can't…

592
00:34:35,615 --> 00:34:37,241
keep going like this.

593
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:20,785
Let's…

594
00:35:21,994 --> 00:35:23,162
break up.

595
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:25,248
I'm suffering because of you.

596
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,999
This is me…

597
00:35:28,626 --> 00:35:29,961
at rock bottom.

598
00:35:53,985 --> 00:35:55,069
Nice and bright, right?

599
00:36:14,672 --> 00:36:16,465
Based on the parameters you provided,

600
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,593
they managed to narrow it down

601
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:20,386
to this guy.

602
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:23,222
Nam Su-yong, the manager
of the strategy team at MomsJoy.

603
00:36:25,266 --> 00:36:27,101
They tailed him for three days,

604
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:29,353
and they caught him
in a suspicious interaction.

605
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:31,397
This one.

606
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,200
Found you.

607
00:36:47,705 --> 00:36:48,539
Da-rim!

608
00:36:49,832 --> 00:36:50,750
Da-rim!

609
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:55,838
DA-RIM

610
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,343
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

611
00:37:00,426 --> 00:37:02,803
You will be redirected to voicemail
after the beep.

612
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:09,352
Please, Mr. Kim.

613
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:12,605
You must know where Da-rim is right now.

614
00:37:13,189 --> 00:37:14,398
I do,

615
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:15,358
of course.

616
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:18,945
We can clear her name.

617
00:37:19,028 --> 00:37:20,321
We have evidence.

618
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:21,989
If I can just explain it to her--

619
00:37:22,073 --> 00:37:23,741
How can I trust you?

620
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,162
I heard you two broke up.

621
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,165
I have nothing more to say,
so please leave.

622
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:36,754
I didn't agree to breaking up.

623
00:37:36,837 --> 00:37:37,797
Listen, Mr. Gong.

624
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:41,050
-Your father was the one--
-Exactly.

625
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:45,388
That's why I'm here to protect her.

626
00:37:47,807 --> 00:37:49,308
So that no one can ever
lay a finger on her again.

627
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:53,312
I'm going to protect her.

628
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,063
Snack time!

629
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:38,190
Come eat!

630
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:39,608
All right!

631
00:38:40,109 --> 00:38:41,068
Coming.

632
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:43,779
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

633
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:47,700
They sell radish water kimchi to go?

634
00:38:47,783 --> 00:38:48,826
Yeah.

635
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:51,245
It's really popular in this town.

636
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:53,164
It goes so well with sweet potatoes.

637
00:38:53,247 --> 00:38:54,790
-Try it.
-They're cooked well.

638
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,335
So how's working at the orchard?

639
00:38:57,418 --> 00:38:58,336
It's hard, isn't it?

640
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:00,046
Not at all.

641
00:39:00,129 --> 00:39:02,340
I think I picked more than you, Uncle.

642
00:39:02,923 --> 00:39:04,967
You're so lucky
to have a daughter like her.

643
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,927
She's so quick and witty.

644
00:39:07,011 --> 00:39:08,763
Gyu-cheol is also dependable.

645
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,849
Are you talking
about that unhelpful son of ours?

646
00:39:12,433 --> 00:39:15,311
I'd ask for nothing more if only he could
be the tiniest bit like Sang-sik.

647
00:39:15,394 --> 00:39:16,270
Sang-sik?

648
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:19,106
-The village head's son?
-Yes.

649
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,527
Sang-sik was the one
who came up with this.

650
00:39:23,611 --> 00:39:27,114
He's the best our village has to offer.

651
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:28,324
He'll be here tomorrow.

652
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:30,159
You should say hi.

653
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:31,869
He's still single, you know.

654
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:34,789
You're single too, right?

655
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,208
Well,

656
00:39:37,291 --> 00:39:38,376
I guess I am.

657
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,693
MR. GONG

658
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:27,550
To account for sweating in the summer,

659
00:40:27,633 --> 00:40:29,760
we can use some sort of mesh fabric.

660
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:33,931
How about making it with mesh fabric
and detachable?

661
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,434
Two options for summer and winter.

662
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:37,726
That could work.

663
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:39,854
I can talk
to the development team tomorrow.

664
00:40:40,938 --> 00:40:41,939
I'm going home first.

665
00:40:43,357 --> 00:40:44,275
I'm really leaving.

666
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:48,779
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

667
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,408
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

668
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:56,704
I'm going home first.

669
00:40:58,706 --> 00:40:59,540
I'm really leaving.

670
00:41:01,750 --> 00:41:04,086
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

671
00:41:06,547 --> 00:41:07,673
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

672
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:11,177
I just want to

673
00:41:12,261 --> 00:41:13,596
chat and laugh with you every day.

674
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:17,016
Can you wait for me?

675
00:41:19,226 --> 00:41:20,811
As soon as my mom's stuff gets sorted out…

676
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:24,982
I'm going to propose to you.

677
00:41:29,445 --> 00:41:30,362
I love you, Go Da-rim.

678
00:42:04,688 --> 00:42:05,856
Am I at the right place?

679
00:42:14,198 --> 00:42:15,199
BOK-SIL

680
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:30,923
Who are you?

681
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:31,882
-Wait.
-Tell me.

682
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:34,802
How dare you sneak in here, you thief!

683
00:42:34,885 --> 00:42:36,345
Wait!

684
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:38,847
-Please calm down and hear me out.
-What?

685
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,683
Why would I listen to a thief?

686
00:42:40,766 --> 00:42:42,309
You damn thief!

687
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:43,644
You're dead meat today.

688
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,937
You're so dead.

689
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:45,854
Come here.

690
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:52,736
-What's going on?
-Are you okay?

691
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,488
-Who's that?
-You're dead meat.

692
00:42:54,572 --> 00:42:55,906
I'm going to end you.

693
00:43:00,536 --> 00:43:01,704
Ji-hyeok?

694
00:43:01,787 --> 00:43:02,746
Da-rim.

695
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,751
What the…

696
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:09,670
You know him?

697
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,089
What are you doing here?

698
00:43:13,007 --> 00:43:14,133
Gi-chan.

699
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,134
You can stop now.

700
00:43:15,217 --> 00:43:16,927
He's not a thief.

701
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,346
He's Da-rim's boss.

702
00:43:21,890 --> 00:43:25,019
What brings you here
in the middle of the night?

703
00:43:26,770 --> 00:43:28,439
Allow me to introduce myself.

704
00:43:28,522 --> 00:43:29,481
I'm Gong Ji-hyeok.

705
00:43:29,565 --> 00:43:30,482
Hello.

706
00:43:30,566 --> 00:43:32,276
I knew it was rude to come without notice,

707
00:43:32,359 --> 00:43:34,862
but I had something to discuss
with Da-rim.

708
00:43:34,945 --> 00:43:36,697
-Please forgive me.
-No, it's fine.

709
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,407
If you know it was rude to do,

710
00:43:39,116 --> 00:43:40,409
you should leave.

711
00:43:41,035 --> 00:43:44,246
I'm sorry for disturbing you two.

712
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,247
But still,

713
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,541
he came all this way.

714
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,460
No, I have nothing to say to him.

715
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,253
You should head back now.

716
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,338
I just need a second.

717
00:43:54,506 --> 00:43:55,674
I rushed over here.

718
00:43:57,259 --> 00:44:00,804
I didn't even have time to eat!

719
00:44:00,888 --> 00:44:01,930
What?

720
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:06,435
You didn't eat yet?

721
00:44:08,729 --> 00:44:09,563
That's right.

722
00:44:09,647 --> 00:44:11,190
Oh dear.

723
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,488
My goodness, I feel terrible.

724
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,239
I didn't have time to prepare,

725
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,368
so I was only able to put together
a few side dishes.

726
00:44:23,369 --> 00:44:24,787
This is a feast.

727
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,373
Thank you so much.

728
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,044
Take your time and eat up.

729
00:44:32,127 --> 00:44:33,045
I will.

730
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:56,193
Go on.

731
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,086
He's going to get indigestion.

732
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,171
You should go to your rooms
so he can eat and leave.

733
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,881
Right, of course.

734
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:19,967
We should let him eat in peace. Let's go.

735
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:22,469
-Should we?
-Yeah, let's go.

736
00:45:23,345 --> 00:45:25,514
No, you don't need to.

737
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:28,642
I actually love it
when people watch me eat.

738
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:32,354
It makes the food tastier
and helps with digestion.

739
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:33,730
Please continue watching me.

740
00:45:34,356 --> 00:45:35,357
Don't go anywhere.

741
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:39,278
Sit down.

742
00:45:41,363 --> 00:45:42,281
Watch him eat.

743
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:48,287
This is so good.

744
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,332
It's nice to see you enjoy it.

745
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:58,088
Anyway, what brings you all the way here
this late at night?

746
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:01,175
By any chance, are you and Da-rim

747
00:46:02,426 --> 00:46:03,552
together or something?

748
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,220
-Yes, we are--
-No.

749
00:46:05,804 --> 00:46:07,097
We're not anymore.

750
00:46:07,681 --> 00:46:09,766
What? So he's a former boyfriend?

751
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,852
Ex-boyfriend?

752
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:15,230
All right then. We're all good.

753
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:17,065
What do you mean?

754
00:46:17,149 --> 00:46:18,025
Well,

755
00:46:18,650 --> 00:46:21,612
Sang-sik asked if you had a boyfriend,

756
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,322
so I told him you didn't.

757
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:27,784
This could've turned out very badly.

758
00:46:29,495 --> 00:46:30,537
Sang-sik?

759
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:31,997
Kim Sang-sik.

760
00:46:32,080 --> 00:46:34,416
He has always taken
such great care of my niece

761
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:36,418
ever since they were little kids.

762
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,212
When Da-rim wanted persimmons,

763
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:41,840
he climbed up the tree,
but he ended up falling.

764
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:44,927
He even cracked his head open.

765
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:46,428
That's why Da-rim promised him

766
00:46:46,512 --> 00:46:49,765
that she'd take care of him forever,
remember?

767
00:46:49,848 --> 00:46:51,141
You remember, right, Myeong-sun?

768
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:54,019
-Take care forever?
-We were just kids back then.

769
00:46:54,102 --> 00:46:54,978
Come on now.

770
00:46:55,062 --> 00:46:57,105
We laughed it off back then,

771
00:46:57,189 --> 00:46:59,608
but I think they'd make a cute couple.

772
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:01,235
-Of course!
-Yeah!

773
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,028
I doubt that.

774
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:07,324
Do you know Sang-sik?

775
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,868
Well, no, I don't.

776
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:13,830
I'm…

777
00:47:15,499 --> 00:47:16,542
not her ex-boyfriend.

778
00:47:17,334 --> 00:47:18,252
I'm her current boyfriend.

779
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:20,379
-What?
-What?

780
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,090
I came to take Da-rim back to Seoul.

781
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,050
Hold on.

782
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:26,927
You're going back?

783
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,345
No, no.

784
00:47:28,428 --> 00:47:30,055
Don't go back.

785
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,892
-Just marry Sang-sik and settle down here.
-Stop it.

786
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,102
He's the youth association chairman,

787
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,521
he has a lot of land
and his family farm to inherit.

788
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:39,314
He has a bright future ahead.

789
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,192
He's also a former UDT soldier.

790
00:47:42,693 --> 00:47:43,569
I, too,

791
00:47:43,652 --> 00:47:46,613
served in the Republic of Korea Army
and was discharged as a sergeant.

792
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:53,954
-You did?
-Yes.

793
00:47:54,037 --> 00:47:55,831
Good for you.

794
00:47:55,914 --> 00:47:57,374
Finish the rest of your meal.

795
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:58,542
Pardon?

796
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,543
Eat up.

797
00:48:01,753 --> 00:48:02,588
Okay.

798
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:06,925
Take your time.

799
00:48:19,605 --> 00:48:21,481
-You should go back--
-Take a look at this.

800
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:25,402
Okay.

801
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:35,329
The man I saw at the exhibition fire

802
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,706
was seen meeting
with a representative from MomsJoy.

803
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:39,249
It means

804
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:41,877
both incidents were deliberately planned
by the same person.

805
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,004
Who would do that?
Why would they take it this far?

806
00:48:44,087 --> 00:48:46,715
They framed you to get rid of me.

807
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,219
They knew you were my weakness.

808
00:48:53,764 --> 00:48:55,724
I'm sorry. I had no idea.

809
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:58,810
I thought this would be the best option.

810
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,605
You were just caught in the crossfire
because of me.

811
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,442
I should be sorry.

812
00:49:07,486 --> 00:49:09,237
Once this man is caught,

813
00:49:09,321 --> 00:49:10,530
your name

814
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:12,574
will be cleared.

815
00:49:15,077 --> 00:49:16,328
So take it back.

816
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:18,246
What do you mean?

817
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,498
The breakup.

818
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,333
Take it back now.

819
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,795
You just said I was your weakness.

820
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:26,254
If I stay by your side,

821
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,048
I'll only make you weaker
as your weakness.

822
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,675
Do you still not get it?

823
00:49:29,758 --> 00:49:31,843
I grow weaker when we're apart.

824
00:49:31,927 --> 00:49:35,305
I'm on the verge of collapsing right now,
so take it back.

825
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,473
Take it back…

826
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,478
and say you'll come back to Seoul with me.

827
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:43,230
I won't leave until you do.

828
00:49:44,147 --> 00:49:44,981
Whatever.

829
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:46,525
-Hold on. My mom is here too.
-I'm not leaving.

830
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,652
-Housing would still be an issue.
-Whatever.

831
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,904
Why are you taking your socks off?

832
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,826
Are you still talking?

833
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:57,536
No, we're done.

834
00:50:03,375 --> 00:50:05,210
We have to get up early for farmwork.

835
00:50:05,752 --> 00:50:07,129
Let's get to bed.

836
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:08,672
-Let me.
-It's fine. I'll do it.

837
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,174
Da-rim, you can sleep here.

838
00:50:11,258 --> 00:50:13,760
Mr. Gong, you can sleep with me
in the living room.

839
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,928
It'll be nice and cozy.

840
00:50:15,011 --> 00:50:17,472
Wait, sir, we're sleeping together?

841
00:50:17,556 --> 00:50:19,975
What, are you going to sleep with Bok-sil
in the yard?

842
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:22,477
-Bok-sil's house is small.
-Good night.

843
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,562
Good night.

844
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:24,813
Go and sleep.

845
00:50:24,896 --> 00:50:27,065
-Hurry up, let's go to sleep.
-Yes, sir. Coming.

846
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,275
Good night.

847
00:50:40,996 --> 00:50:42,122
Mr. Gong.

848
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,124
Hello?

849
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,419
You slept enough. You should get up now.

850
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:49,880
We have so much work to do today.

851
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:51,673
Hello?

852
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:52,674
Mr. Gong.

853
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,428
Fine. Keep sleeping.

854
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,346
Sleep the day away.

855
00:50:59,681 --> 00:51:03,769
I wanted to see if you were strong enough
to be a good fit for my niece,

856
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:04,978
but I guess not.

857
00:51:05,854 --> 00:51:07,355
I knew Sang-sik was the one.

858
00:51:12,694 --> 00:51:13,820
It's already morning?

859
00:51:14,571 --> 00:51:15,781
Where should I start?

860
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,365
Just tell me what to do.

861
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:50,482
Gosh, he ate the most at breakfast,
but he's as weak as can be.

862
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,192
Move it already!

863
00:51:53,610 --> 00:51:55,028
Sorry, sir.

864
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:57,739
-It's my first time farming.
-Oh gosh.

865
00:51:57,823 --> 00:51:59,241
Oh no.

866
00:51:59,324 --> 00:52:01,701
He picked all the unripe ones.

867
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,495
-Sorry?
-Jeez.

868
00:52:03,578 --> 00:52:05,789
But the sir here said
these were ripe enough to be picked.

869
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:07,457
There you go again.

870
00:52:07,541 --> 00:52:10,085
Why do you keep calling me "sir"
like I'm some old man?

871
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,129
I'm not even 60 yet, okay?

872
00:52:14,589 --> 00:52:16,550
Look carefully. Look.

873
00:52:17,133 --> 00:52:18,510
Gi-chan!

874
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:21,054
What in the world is that?

875
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:33,525
SANG-SIK'S MUSIC

876
00:52:52,544 --> 00:52:54,838
My goodness, the weather's spectacular.

877
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,300
Hey, Gi-chan. Have you been well?

878
00:52:58,383 --> 00:52:59,259
Yeah.

879
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:00,886
Did you hear that?

880
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,263
My gosh. Welcome, Sang-sik.

881
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,142
Did your training go well?

882
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:09,769
Yes, all thanks to you.

883
00:53:09,853 --> 00:53:13,773
Goodness me. You've become even prettier
over a few days, Myeong-ja.

884
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:14,858
Is it that obvious?

885
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:18,612
Did you already start harvesting?

886
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,864
Jeez, I told you to wait for me.

887
00:53:20,947 --> 00:53:22,824
What's the point of lounging around?

888
00:53:23,408 --> 00:53:25,410
We have my sister-in-law

889
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:26,828
and Da-rim visiting from Seoul.

890
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:28,371
They were helping out.

891
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,789
Sang-sik.

892
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:32,208
It's been forever.

893
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:35,503
My aunt and uncle told me
how successful you've become.

894
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:37,756
Gosh, I'm flattered.

895
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,341
Have you been well?

896
00:53:39,424 --> 00:53:41,092
Why haven't you come to visit
all this time?

897
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,510
I missed you so much.

898
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,054
I was too busy making a living.

899
00:53:45,096 --> 00:53:47,182
It's so nice to see you.

900
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:51,478
Since you're here,
you should stay a while.

901
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,855
We can hang out like we used to
when we were kids.

902
00:53:53,939 --> 00:53:56,066
Sounds good.

903
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:57,108
Excuse me.

904
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:01,363
Da-rim is going back to Seoul with me.

905
00:54:02,197 --> 00:54:03,114
Who are you?

906
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:07,035
-I'm…
-Her former boyfriend.

907
00:54:07,118 --> 00:54:09,162
The ex-boyfriend.

908
00:54:09,996 --> 00:54:12,666
It seems like Da-rim's over him,

909
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:15,627
but I don't know
why he came all this way to be clingy.

910
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,173
I mean, it makes sense.

911
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:21,174
I understand.

912
00:54:21,883 --> 00:54:24,386
You won't find a better woman
than my Da-rim.

913
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:26,054
That's why

914
00:54:26,596 --> 00:54:28,139
I still can't forget about her.

915
00:54:29,349 --> 00:54:32,143
Gosh, why would you joke around like that?

916
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:38,400
"My" Da-rim?

917
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:41,277
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

918
00:54:41,361 --> 00:54:43,780
I'll buy you lots of delicious food.

919
00:54:43,863 --> 00:54:46,783
I've made a lot of money.

920
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:47,701
You know?

921
00:54:49,536 --> 00:54:51,496
Come on. Stop that already.

922
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,417
What's with him?

923
00:54:58,962 --> 00:55:02,132
Ji-hyeok, you shouldn't cut the branches.

924
00:55:02,215 --> 00:55:04,050
You need to cut it closer to the stem.

925
00:55:04,134 --> 00:55:05,427
Yes, a bit lower.

926
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,214
That's amazing.

927
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:03,568
Are you okay?

928
00:56:03,651 --> 00:56:05,445
Jeez. Hurry it up already.

929
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,783
Let me.

930
00:56:09,866 --> 00:56:10,742
I'm fine.

931
00:56:10,825 --> 00:56:11,701
Go on.

932
00:56:22,545 --> 00:56:23,505
Okay.

933
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:54,744
There we go.

934
00:56:55,954 --> 00:56:58,748
We don't want to damage
that fine skin of yours.

935
00:56:59,874 --> 00:57:00,959
Thanks.

936
00:57:04,129 --> 00:57:07,090
You just relax and enjoy this ice cream.

937
00:57:07,173 --> 00:57:08,967
I'll take care of everything else.

938
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:20,395
Come on, it's going to melt.

939
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,986
Ji-hyeok, are you okay?

940
00:57:29,779 --> 00:57:31,239
Are you okay? Oh no.

941
00:57:33,324 --> 00:57:34,409
Are you okay?

942
00:57:35,326 --> 00:57:36,244
Are you?

943
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,204
That's a relief.

944
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,375
You must be tired.

945
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,045
Here we go.

946
00:57:49,174 --> 00:57:53,136
So why would you even think
you stood a chance against him

947
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:55,513
when you've never even been on a farm?

948
00:57:57,348 --> 00:57:58,600
That's the wrong spot.

949
00:57:58,683 --> 00:57:59,642
What? Really?

950
00:57:59,726 --> 00:58:00,768
A bit further up.

951
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,353
Okay, hold. Further up.

952
00:58:02,437 --> 00:58:04,230
-No, further up.
-Here?

953
00:58:04,314 --> 00:58:05,648
No, further up.

954
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,275
-Where?
-A bit more.

955
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:08,485
No, further up.

956
00:58:08,568 --> 00:58:10,153
-I don't think--
-More.

957
00:58:12,155 --> 00:58:13,740
How can you be joking around right now?

958
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:18,495
I didn't like the way he looked at you,

959
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:20,663
and everyone was praising him.

960
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:23,124
I wanted to look cool too,
but nothing was going my way.

961
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:26,836
I rushed because I felt anxious.

962
00:58:27,420 --> 00:58:28,922
Even so,

963
00:58:29,005 --> 00:58:32,926
did you think I'd call you manly
for being good at farmwork?

964
00:58:33,718 --> 00:58:35,303
Did you think I'd be impressed

965
00:58:35,386 --> 00:58:38,598
if I saw you push yourself
to the point of injury?

966
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,725
You're unbelievable.

967
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,727
Why are you smiling?

968
00:58:43,436 --> 00:58:44,270
I like it.

969
00:58:44,354 --> 00:58:45,355
What?

970
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,899
Thank you for nagging me.

971
00:58:50,443 --> 00:58:52,028
It means you're worried about me.

972
00:58:52,904 --> 00:58:55,198
As if. When did I worry about you?

973
00:58:56,199 --> 00:58:57,075
I'm here

974
00:58:58,535 --> 00:59:01,412
because I want to hear you nag
for the rest of my life.

975
00:59:13,299 --> 00:59:14,717
I missed you so much.

976
00:59:17,011 --> 00:59:17,887
I love you.

977
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,979
-Unbelievable.
-I missed you.

978
00:59:26,062 --> 00:59:26,896
Seriously.

979
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,815
Are you okay?

980
00:59:29,607 --> 00:59:30,483
It hurts.

981
00:59:34,153 --> 00:59:35,947
Drive safely.

982
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,074
Just wait for a little longer.

983
00:59:38,157 --> 00:59:40,702
I'll be sure to prove your innocence

984
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:42,453
and come back for you.

985
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:45,790
Oh, right.

986
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:48,459
This is a copy

987
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,629
of the voice notes I recorded
while working on the new product.

988
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,507
There are a lot of ideas on there
that were never used.

989
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:56,175
I thought

990
00:59:56,259 --> 00:59:58,177
they might come in handy later on.

991
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,762
All right.

992
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,140
Are you leaving?

993
01:00:02,223 --> 01:00:03,725
Yes, I'll be heading back now.

994
01:00:04,475 --> 01:00:07,604
I'm sorry for causing you distress.

995
01:00:07,687 --> 01:00:09,480
Not at all.

996
01:00:09,564 --> 01:00:11,983
You must've had a hard time
because of Da-rim.

997
01:00:12,066 --> 01:00:13,568
I'm the one who's sorry.

998
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,824
This is steamed corn and rice punch.

999
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:21,576
They're snacks for the road.

1000
01:00:23,328 --> 01:00:24,329
They're my favorites.

1001
01:00:28,124 --> 01:00:29,208
They're still warm.

1002
01:00:29,292 --> 01:00:32,545
I figured you'd like them,
so I just steamed them.

1003
01:00:33,129 --> 01:00:35,131
Thank you. I'll be sure to enjoy them.

1004
01:00:35,214 --> 01:00:36,758
All right. Drive safely.

1005
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:37,675
Get back safely.

1006
01:00:57,403 --> 01:01:00,907
My vote is for Ji-hyeok, not Sang-sik.

1007
01:01:03,576 --> 01:01:06,371
What? Why do you get to choose?

1008
01:01:06,996 --> 01:01:09,666
Then again, I'm on the same page.

1009
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:18,257
Hey, Da-rim.

1010
01:01:20,468 --> 01:01:21,511
I'll wrap things up and be on my way.

1011
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:23,179
Bye.

1012
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:36,567
A major incident occurred
at Natural BeBe recently.

1013
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:37,777
MOTHER TF EMPLOYEE GO DA-RIM
MARRIAGE STATUS: UNMARRIED

1014
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:38,695
Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok

1015
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:41,698
had been romantically involved
with his subordinate,

1016
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:44,409
and he overlooked the fact that
she lied to secure her position.

1017
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:49,205
Therefore, I'd like to request
a special vote concerning the dismissal

1018
01:01:49,288 --> 01:01:51,082
of Mother TF Team Leader Gong Ji-hyeok.

1019
01:01:52,458 --> 01:01:54,419
Please cast your votes now.

1020
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:04,637
It's Team Leader Gong.

1021
01:02:49,640 --> 01:02:54,562
DYNAMITE KISS

1022
01:03:24,675 --> 01:03:27,345
Now, let's get in there.

1023
01:03:27,428 --> 01:03:29,680
That is to say, today's special vote
is null and void.

1024
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:33,351
Neither you nor Chairman Gong
is qualified to run this company.

1025
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:34,435
Yes, that's right.

1026
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:36,979
There's someone else more qualified
to run this company.

1027
01:03:37,063 --> 01:03:38,147
It's her.

1028
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:39,357
Did it go well?

1029
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,775
I'm on my way to you.

1030
01:03:41,776 --> 01:03:43,444
It's all because of that bastard,
Gong Ji-hyeok.

1031
01:03:43,528 --> 01:03:45,196
You're almost here, right?

1032
01:03:45,279 --> 01:03:47,281
Hello? Ji-hyeok? Ji-hyeok!

1033
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:48,991
Ji-hyeok!

1034
01:03:51,744 --> 01:03:56,749
