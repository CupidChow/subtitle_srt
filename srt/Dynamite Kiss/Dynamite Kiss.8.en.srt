1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:52,385 --> 00:00:53,595
Are you sure you'll be okay?

3
00:00:53,678 --> 00:00:55,096
You don't have to be there.

4
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,057
Don't be silly.

5
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,101
It's a meeting
with my son's future in-laws.

6
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,353
Of course, I should be by your side.

7
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,272
Tell me if you ever feel uncomfortable.

8
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:06,066
I'll get you out of there.

9
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:09,319
I know I haven't been

10
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,489
much of a mom to you.

11
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,365
What's gotten into you?

12
00:01:14,949 --> 00:01:17,494
Now that your son's about to get married,
is it making you all sentimental?

13
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,955
It seems I've only been

14
00:01:21,831 --> 00:01:23,458
thinking about myself for far too long.

15
00:01:24,834 --> 00:01:27,504
You could've used a dependable mom.

16
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:30,632
I'm sorry.

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,259
Why are you suddenly saying such things?

18
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:36,012
You know what?

19
00:01:36,095 --> 00:01:38,807
I feel very reassured to have you join me

20
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:41,684
on a day like this.

21
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:47,440
By the way,
when did you start dating Ha-yeong?

22
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:49,442
I never knew.

23
00:01:49,526 --> 00:01:50,360
What?

24
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,780
There's no exact date.

25
00:01:54,656 --> 00:01:57,700
You know we've been friends
since we were kids.

26
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:58,868
But still,

27
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,996
I didn't realize marriage
was on the table.

28
00:02:03,456 --> 00:02:04,707
We know each other well enough,

29
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,626
so we won't have reasons to fight.

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,878
It all works out.

31
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:16,970
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

32
00:02:17,554 --> 00:02:21,349
I hear the campaign led by Ji-hyeok

33
00:02:21,432 --> 00:02:22,725
is being received well.

34
00:02:23,393 --> 00:02:24,227
Beyond expectations.

35
00:02:24,811 --> 00:02:25,770
I only carried on

36
00:02:26,938 --> 00:02:28,022
what my mother started.

37
00:02:28,106 --> 00:02:29,899
Oh, is that so?

38
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:32,193
You've raised your son well.

39
00:02:33,528 --> 00:02:36,239
-Thank you.
-Gosh, you're too kind.

40
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:40,743
I hear Tae-yeong's achieving great results
with companies all over the world.

41
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,788
Yes, I'm doing even better now,
thanks to you.

42
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:45,373
Because of me?

43
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:48,418
You brought Ji-hyeok into your company.

44
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:52,005
With my biggest competitor gone,
work has been a breeze.

45
00:02:52,088 --> 00:02:52,922
Thank you, sir.

46
00:02:53,798 --> 00:02:55,008
Ji-hyeok.

47
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:56,634
Thank you.

48
00:02:58,052 --> 00:03:03,308
Do you plan on keeping Ji-hyeok
on that rookie team of interns?

49
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:04,684
No, of course not.

50
00:03:04,767 --> 00:03:07,896
It's meant to be temporary
until he gets the hang of things.

51
00:03:07,979 --> 00:03:09,772
He'll soon be where he belongs.

52
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:12,984
I can't have my daughter-in-law lose face.

53
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:14,360
Don't you agree, Ha-yeong?

54
00:03:15,278 --> 00:03:16,863
-Well--
-Speaking of which,

55
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,698
since we're all gathered here today,

56
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,950
I was hoping we could discuss
the kids' future.

57
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:24,037
Excuse me for interrupting,
but there's something I'd like to tell--

58
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,330
I'll tell them.

59
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:29,417
Ha-yeong and I

60
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,336
would like to get married right away.

61
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,922
Ji-hyeok.

62
00:03:34,005 --> 00:03:35,840
What are you talking about?

63
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,342
I want to get married.

64
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:40,261
We'll skip the engagement ceremony

65
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:42,305
and get married as soon as possible.

66
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,908
You should still adhere
to the formalities.

67
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,827
Rushing will only lead to baseless rumors.

68
00:04:05,745 --> 00:04:08,498
It seems he's head over heels
for Ha-yeong.

69
00:04:09,457 --> 00:04:12,669
I understand, but such a decision
isn't one for you two to make alone.

70
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:14,295
We're going to get married anyway,

71
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:16,673
so why delay it?

72
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:25,556
In that case, how about we move up
the engagement ceremony, ma'am?

73
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:33,815
-Sure.
-No, I don't want to do that.

74
00:04:33,898 --> 00:04:36,150
Oh my. You want to skip
the engagement ceremony too?

75
00:04:36,234 --> 00:04:37,860
-No, that's not what I--
-Understood.

76
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:41,781
We'll proceed with the engagement ceremony
right away then.

77
00:04:43,992 --> 00:04:45,243
We can do it as early as next week.

78
00:04:50,707 --> 00:04:51,791
Are you crazy?

79
00:04:51,874 --> 00:04:53,126
What's gotten into you?

80
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,711
What were you building up to?

81
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,754
Is this because of Go Da-rim?

82
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:02,302
Am I wrong? It's not like you could've
suddenly fallen in love with me.

83
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:04,804
You're doing this
because you don't want her to get hurt.

84
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:06,306
I'd like to steer clear

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:09,017
of unpleasant issues within my team.

86
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,601
It could also hurt my future standing

87
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,145
with the company.

88
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,107
Your standing?

89
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:18,359
Since when did you care so much
about the company?

90
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:19,902
I made a deal with my father.

91
00:05:20,695 --> 00:05:23,448
If I establish myself in the company
and marry you,

92
00:05:23,531 --> 00:05:25,074
he'll give me what I want.

93
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,828
After talking all that smack about him,
you're no better than your father.

94
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,165
I'm sorry, but I won't be marrying you.

95
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,583
I came to tell them that today.

96
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,210
Don't try to stop me.

97
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:38,880
Sure, tell them.

98
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,632
That makes it easier for me.

99
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:43,968
You'll just get locked up in your house…

100
00:05:46,429 --> 00:05:47,972
until the day of the engagement ceremony.

101
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,906
Couldn't you have been more affable
in front of the in-laws?

102
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,117
You could've been more conversational
with Chairman Yu's wife.

103
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,661
You looked like
you were being dragged to your death.

104
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:12,789
I didn't come to appease you.

105
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,209
-I endured it for Ji-hyeok's sake.
-That's exactly my point.

106
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,628
Your son is bending over backward for you,

107
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,296
and you couldn't even meet him halfway?

108
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:23,591
What do you mean by that?

109
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,761
What do you mean
he's bending over backward for me?

110
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:32,350
What have you done to Ji-hyeok?

111
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,896
It's what he wanted.

112
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,066
In exchange for marrying
into Chairman Yu's family, I divorce you.

113
00:06:40,733 --> 00:06:43,861
It's not a bad deal for me, so I agreed.

114
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,113
So,

115
00:06:45,822 --> 00:06:47,281
behave yourself accordingly.

116
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,357
Let's speed it up.

117
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:22,775
Faster.

118
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,288
That's good.

119
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:37,290
You can go.

120
00:07:39,292 --> 00:07:41,210
Is it because I've already been married?

121
00:07:41,294 --> 00:07:43,129
Why does it have to be them?

122
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,091
I think we'd be a better match.

123
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,303
I'm going to leave
if you're going to talk nonsense.

124
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:52,388
Relax. I'm kidding.

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:54,724
But it didn't seem like

126
00:07:55,725 --> 00:07:58,186
they particularly liked each other.

127
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,104
Do they have to like each other
to get married?

128
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,064
It's just work, after all.

129
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:03,316
I'd expect no less

130
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:05,735
from Natural BeBe's chairman's
eldest daughter.

131
00:08:08,488 --> 00:08:10,490
I can't forget you for good reason.

132
00:08:10,573 --> 00:08:11,949
Take that hand off me.

133
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:17,872
Stop glaring at me.

134
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,374
I called you out here to help you.

135
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,713
I wonder how you could possibly help me.

136
00:08:25,796 --> 00:08:26,881
You want to split them up,

137
00:08:28,007 --> 00:08:28,841
don't you?

138
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:32,929
Fine, I'll help you.

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,390
Do you want to die
as Chairman Gong's handmaid?

140
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:39,602
Are you just going to sit back and watch
Ji-hyeok take over Natural BeBe?

141
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,313
Do your charity work at that dog shelter.

142
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:44,524
Don't serve the company to him
on a silver platter.

143
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:46,817
You're way off.

144
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,736
Ji-hyeok has no interest in the company.

145
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,034
If you want to judge
someone's true character,

146
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:57,245
you can't trust what they say.

147
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,412
You need to see how they act.

148
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,749
Do you think

149
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:04,919
he would've led and pushed this campaign
so aggressively

150
00:09:05,002 --> 00:09:06,546
if he had no interest
in the company at all?

151
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,508
Not to mention,
it's unlikely Chairman Gong

152
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:12,176
will pass on the company

153
00:09:13,052 --> 00:09:16,347
to his mistress's daughter
when he has a legitimate son.

154
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,515
He's old-fashioned like that.

155
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,275
That damn mouth of yours.

156
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,484
Watch what comes out of it.

157
00:09:28,985 --> 00:09:31,070
I'll let it slide this once
for old times' sake.

158
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,739
Move.

159
00:09:57,305 --> 00:09:58,347
Does your husband

160
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,600
know you're here?

161
00:10:13,404 --> 00:10:15,573
A man lives here alone.

162
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,951
What would people say
if they saw you here?

163
00:10:28,919 --> 00:10:30,421
Don't cross the line.

164
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,971
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

165
00:10:39,055 --> 00:10:42,433
Mr. Gong and Ms. Yu are getting engaged?

166
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:43,517
-My goodness.
-Unbelievable.

167
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,645
It's a bit sad to find out about it
through the press.

168
00:10:45,728 --> 00:10:47,772
-You knew, Mr. Kang, didn't you?
-I'm sorry.

169
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:49,482
It was top secret.

170
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,026
Good morning.

171
00:10:52,526 --> 00:10:54,570
-What was top secret?
-Da-rim, look at this.

172
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,494
CONGLOMERATE MARRIAGE BUSINESS?

173
00:11:01,577 --> 00:11:03,245
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

174
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,045
Where's Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok's office?

175
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:14,465
He's in the middle of a meeting right now.

176
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,967
Do you have an appointment?

177
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:18,302
It's fine.

178
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,596
I don't need to make one to see him.

179
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,599
-I still can't believe it.
-You didn't know either, right?

180
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:25,101
Shocking, right? We're shocked too.

181
00:11:25,184 --> 00:11:26,769
-There he is.
-Good morning.

182
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,365
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

183
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:08,436
So they were engaged.

184
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:12,022
That's why he got so upset

185
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,400
when I showed up at his place.

186
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:21,949
What am I going to do?

187
00:12:27,371 --> 00:12:29,165
What a wasted opportunity.

188
00:12:29,790 --> 00:12:32,334
If Mr. Gong Ji-hyeok had come to our team,

189
00:12:32,418 --> 00:12:34,003
I would've made a move on him.

190
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,214
That wouldn't have made a difference.

191
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:40,092
It's obvious. It's a marriage agreement
with Taeyu C&T.

192
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,181
Wait, then is he guaranteed
to become the successor to Natural BeBe?

193
00:12:46,348 --> 00:12:47,349
Probably.

194
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:50,936
Director Gong Ji-hye will just become
the dog that chased her own tail.

195
00:12:56,775 --> 00:12:58,027
These people…

196
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:08,954
My apologies.
I'll find which team they're in

197
00:13:09,038 --> 00:13:11,540
-and teach them a lesson.
-Forget it.

198
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:13,959
-Did you bring it?
-Yes, ma'am.

199
00:13:25,763 --> 00:13:26,805
What the heck?

200
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:28,974
This is it? This is nothing.

201
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,310
With so many people around,

202
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,646
I just couldn't get the shot.

203
00:13:33,729 --> 00:13:35,272
If that was the case,

204
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:37,733
you should've made it happen.

205
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,361
How am I supposed to do that?

206
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,612
Do whatever it takes!

207
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:43,864
Make it happen and bring me evidence!

208
00:13:45,407 --> 00:13:46,742
Yes, ma'am.

209
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:51,747
What's there to even think about?

210
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:53,499
You're here to make money,
not play around.

211
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:57,169
I just need to work as a team member
with him as the team leader. That's it.

212
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,505
Why? Because I'm a pro!

213
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:02,091
I'm a pro, so I'll act like one.

214
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,676
Yeah, a pro!

215
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,276
Mr. Gong.

216
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,821
First, I sincerely congratulate you
on your engagement.

217
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:26,824
I once again sincerely apologize
for showing up at your place.

218
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:29,034
I swear that I had no other intentions.

219
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,745
However, I can see how Ms. Yu
could've misunderstood,

220
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:33,914
so I'm indeed at fault.

221
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:35,541
As long as you're aware.

222
00:14:37,042 --> 00:14:38,043
Is that why you're here?

223
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,673
These are the reviews
from the participants

224
00:14:42,756 --> 00:14:44,133
of the tree-planting event.

225
00:14:44,216 --> 00:14:46,802
The communications team
wanted three of them for a feature,

226
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,971
so I've compiled a shortlist.

227
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:56,937
I don't see any photos.

228
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:58,397
I've included photos

229
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,025
on the very last page.

230
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,534
I see.

231
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:12,369
Good work.

232
00:15:12,453 --> 00:15:13,454
Not at all.

233
00:15:13,537 --> 00:15:15,581
I simply fulfilled my duties

234
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,416
because I'm a pro.

235
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,628
Do you have any other questions
or assignments for me?

236
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,629
I don't.

237
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:23,464
You may leave.

238
00:15:23,547 --> 00:15:25,382
Okay, then I'll get going.

239
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:46,904
Mr. Gong.

240
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:49,031
Are you here to make a copy?

241
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,908
Allow me to help you.

242
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:58,248
How many copies would you like?

243
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:02,378
Thank you, but I can manage.

244
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,380
Yes, sir. I understand.

245
00:16:04,463 --> 00:16:07,341
Then I shall get out of your way.

246
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,496
I…

247
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:40,624
I hope there are no misunderstandings.

248
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,960
The only reason I did this for you

249
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,629
is because
I'm on break room duty this week.

250
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,344
All right then.

251
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,266
Oh, that's hot!

252
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,665
Thank you.

253
00:17:21,749 --> 00:17:23,459
Why do you make me worry?

254
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:25,627
Sorry?

255
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,255
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

256
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:31,717
Can't you get your act together?

257
00:17:34,178 --> 00:17:35,804
You're such a handful.

258
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,187
I'm sorry.

259
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:53,113
I don't need a treatment.
I don't want one.

260
00:17:53,197 --> 00:17:55,199
Your engagement ceremony
is right around the corner.

261
00:17:55,282 --> 00:17:57,367
You need proper care
for your makeup to look good.

262
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,535
I said I don't need it.

263
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,578
I'm…

264
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:01,288
not getting engaged.

265
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:03,624
What's wrong with you?

266
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,085
You were crazy about Ji-hyeok
and even packed his lunch the other day.

267
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,212
It wasn't for him.

268
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,339
The truth is…

269
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,551
I like someone else.

270
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,552
What?

271
00:18:15,636 --> 00:18:16,470
Sorry, Mom.

272
00:18:16,553 --> 00:18:18,764
I should've told you sooner,

273
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,849
but I had my reasons.

274
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,850
What reasons?

275
00:18:22,392 --> 00:18:23,227
Who is it?

276
00:18:23,894 --> 00:18:25,187
I can't tell you just yet.

277
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:30,776
If you can't tell me now,
just keep it to yourself forever.

278
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,113
I'll pretend
we never had this conversation.

279
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,744
-Ma'am, may we get started?
-Go ahead.

280
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:43,956
Give her the bridal special,
and I'll get my usual treatment.

281
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:48,961
CONGLOMERATE MARRIAGE BUSINESS?

282
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:50,963
GONG JI-HYEOK AND YU HA-YEONG
ANNOUNCE THEIR ENGAGEMENT

283
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:01,723
Engagement?

284
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:17,698
Excuse me, Mr. Gong. Do you have a moment?

285
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,784
This is the article about the quadruplets
who were born on Geobuk Island,

286
00:19:20,868 --> 00:19:22,619
published today.

287
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:25,747
We've long been gifting
baby products to parents

288
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:27,916
who give birth
to triplets and quadruplets.

289
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,793
But this time,

290
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:32,671
we're looking to write an article
about visiting them in person

291
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,758
and helping out with childcare
so the parents can have a day off.

292
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:38,969
How many do you need from my team?

293
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,430
Two people from the marketing team
will be going,

294
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:43,932
so we just need one from your team.

295
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,851
I'll discuss with the team
and let you know.

296
00:19:47,102 --> 00:19:48,228
Well, you see,

297
00:19:48,312 --> 00:19:50,105
the higher-ups were going on about

298
00:19:50,189 --> 00:19:54,651
how the team leaders
should lead by example.

299
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,447
It looks like you'll need to
be there this time, Mr. Gong.

300
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,115
And of course, I'll be there too.

301
00:20:01,700 --> 00:20:03,243
All right then.

302
00:20:06,163 --> 00:20:07,706
Okay.

303
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,224
Oh, that's our ad.

304
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,226
WATCHING YOU SEARCH
FOR A FOUR-LEAF CLOVER

305
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,685
IS ALREADY MY GREATEST FORTUNE

306
00:20:59,049 --> 00:20:59,967
Wait, the bus…

307
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,815
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

308
00:21:16,566 --> 00:21:17,943
Can't you get your act together?

309
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:22,030
You're such a handful.

310
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:13,749
Wow, look at the sea!

311
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:43,361
Mr. Gong!

312
00:22:50,035 --> 00:22:51,661
Hello, Mr. Gong.

313
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,840
What are you doing here, Ms. Go?

314
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,302
Well, you see,

315
00:23:07,385 --> 00:23:10,138
my team member who was supposed to come

316
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,723
got sick all of a sudden.

317
00:23:12,349 --> 00:23:14,184
She was a last-minute replacement.

318
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:15,644
Why didn't you tell me that sooner?

319
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,480
Don't worry.

320
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,440
I'll work hard to make sure I don't mess…

321
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:24,736
Wow, just look at the sea.

322
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:26,363
Just look at it.

323
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:29,407
Man, that's nice.

324
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,751
What a great view.

325
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,738
ANGEL HUG BOX

326
00:24:09,322 --> 00:24:10,323
It's okay.

327
00:24:10,407 --> 00:24:11,491
It's my job.

328
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:13,368
You can go first.

329
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,771
That's nice. Here we go.

330
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:43,607
That's great.

331
00:24:43,690 --> 00:24:44,608
Let's take one more.

332
00:24:44,691 --> 00:24:46,693
One, two, three!

333
00:24:49,738 --> 00:24:51,031
That came out nice.

334
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:52,949
One, two, three.

335
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:54,910
That's great.

336
00:25:04,336 --> 00:25:07,130
Just leave the babies to us,

337
00:25:07,214 --> 00:25:11,176
and you two can enjoy a relaxing date.

338
00:25:11,259 --> 00:25:13,053
Are you sure?

339
00:25:13,136 --> 00:25:15,305
Looking after four babies won't be easy.

340
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,932
Don't worry about a thing.

341
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,852
That woman over there from our company
is a childcare veteran.

342
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:24,397
Yes, just leave it to me.

343
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:26,149
Please take good care of them.

344
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:27,400
Don't worry.

345
00:25:27,484 --> 00:25:28,735
Good luck.

346
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:30,195
Let's go.

347
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:31,988
-Mr. Ma.
-Yes?

348
00:25:32,072 --> 00:25:33,365
Where are you going?

349
00:25:33,448 --> 00:25:35,742
Well, I need to go with them
and take pictures.

350
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:37,994
Come on now.

351
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:39,746
I can take those pictures.

352
00:25:39,829 --> 00:25:41,957
Wait. What's wrong, Mr. Gong?

353
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,876
I need to take some pictures
and interview them.

354
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:48,046
I have a lot to do
as the marketing team leader.

355
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:49,005
So…

356
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:51,508
Good luck.

357
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,095
-Wait, I--
-No, I'll do it.

358
00:25:55,178 --> 00:25:56,346
-Wait--
-Go, run.

359
00:26:02,018 --> 00:26:04,896
Oh no. What's the matter? It's okay.

360
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,565
You're okay.

361
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:09,901
-It's all right.
-So what should I do first?

362
00:26:15,448 --> 00:26:16,408
It's good, isn't it?

363
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:20,161
Look at you eat.

364
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,964
Thank you.

365
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,596
One second, Mr. Gong.

366
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:41,975
There we go.

367
00:26:42,058 --> 00:26:43,351
Let's burp now.

368
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:48,648
-Oh, there's the burp.
-I heard it too.

369
00:26:48,732 --> 00:26:49,941
Look at you.

370
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,693
-Good job.
-Well done.

371
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:01,077
You're so cute.

372
00:27:22,057 --> 00:27:23,933
NATURAL BEBE SENDS THE WARMEST WISHES
TO YOUR QUADRUPLET FAMILY

373
00:27:26,144 --> 00:27:28,063
Thank you, Natural BeBe.

374
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:31,149
Today was like a dream.

375
00:27:31,232 --> 00:27:33,109
Thank you, Natural BeBe.

376
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:36,446
Okay!

377
00:27:36,529 --> 00:27:38,865
That was great.

378
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:39,824
Well done.

379
00:27:39,908 --> 00:27:40,867
-Thank you.
-You too.

380
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:42,994
Goodness.

381
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:45,497
Thank you so much.
We had a really great day thanks to you.

382
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:48,792
How about we go to the cafe out front

383
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,420
and leisurely enjoy a cup of coffee?

384
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:53,922
No, that's all right.

385
00:27:54,005 --> 00:27:56,383
Your colleagues must be exhausted
looking after our kids.

386
00:27:56,466 --> 00:27:57,550
We should get back now.

387
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:59,844
You don't need to worry about them at all.

388
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,971
One of them is a childcare expert.

389
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:03,807
But still, the last boat will depart soon.

390
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,725
If they miss that,
they'll be stuck here all night.

391
00:28:06,393 --> 00:28:07,394
Exactly.

392
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:12,190
The boat is leaving.

393
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,364
Hello?

394
00:28:19,447 --> 00:28:21,366
Mr. Ma, where are you right now?

395
00:28:21,866 --> 00:28:23,701
Oh, I'm on the boat right now.

396
00:28:23,785 --> 00:28:25,328
Did you not get on?

397
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,622
This is the last boat.

398
00:28:27,705 --> 00:28:30,792
You shouldn't have
sent the parents back so late.

399
00:28:30,875 --> 00:28:32,252
You should've watched the time!

400
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:33,753
I apologize.

401
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,588
I was so focused on making it myself.

402
00:28:35,672 --> 00:28:38,258
I didn't realize how late they'd return.

403
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:39,300
Turn the boat around.

404
00:28:39,884 --> 00:28:41,594
I'll pay the captain
however much they want,

405
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:43,012
so just tell them to turn the boat around!

406
00:28:43,096 --> 00:28:44,639
Hello? Mr. Gong?

407
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:47,934
Oh, is it because I'm out at sea?
I can barely hear you.

408
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:49,144
Anyway, see you tomorrow.

409
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,471
Nice shot.

410
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,313
It's me.

411
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:36,024
They should be arriving soon.

412
00:29:36,524 --> 00:29:39,944
Please do as I asked earlier.

413
00:29:40,779 --> 00:29:41,780
Oh no.

414
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,990
We only have one room left.

415
00:29:44,866 --> 00:29:47,285
One? You only have one left?

416
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:52,332
Yeah. We have two rooms,
but we already have a guest in that one.

417
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:56,044
Then, where else
might we find lodging on the island?

418
00:29:56,127 --> 00:29:59,214
Nowhere.
This is the only one on the island.

419
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:00,381
Oh, is that so?

420
00:30:01,257 --> 00:30:03,927
But the thing is,
we can't really share a room.

421
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:07,889
I'm sorry,

422
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:11,184
but could I possibly
sleep with you, ma'am?

423
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:12,560
Then what about my husband?

424
00:30:12,644 --> 00:30:15,104
Goodness, that won't do.

425
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:17,982
Then, could you lend us a tent
or a sleeping bag?

426
00:30:18,066 --> 00:30:22,529
Goodness, just drop the act
and go inside already.

427
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:25,949
I've been doing this for a long time.

428
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:26,866
Did you eat?

429
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,495
Food is not the issue right now.

430
00:30:36,209 --> 00:30:38,545
Just give me a minute.
I'll prepare some food for you.

431
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,171
Go inside.

432
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:41,589
I'll make you something tasty.

433
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:30,805
What should we do

434
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:32,765
about this situation?

435
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,853
Well, we have no other choice.

436
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,189
You should tell your husband--

437
00:31:40,273 --> 00:31:42,442
Don't worry,
I'll make sure he understands.

438
00:31:45,153 --> 00:31:47,447
But what about Ms. Yu?

439
00:31:48,156 --> 00:31:50,783
I'd rather not bring up anything
that might cause a misunderstanding.

440
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:53,953
Right, of course.

441
00:31:55,121 --> 00:31:55,955
Yeah.

442
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:04,172
Dinner's here.

443
00:32:05,048 --> 00:32:05,882
-Yes.
-Coming.

444
00:32:05,965 --> 00:32:07,759
It's not much,

445
00:32:08,551 --> 00:32:09,844
but eat up.

446
00:32:11,012 --> 00:32:13,348
There's more rice in the kitchen,

447
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,975
so help yourself if you need more, okay?

448
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:17,936
-Don't leave any leftovers.
-Okay.

449
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:18,853
There'll be a fine.

450
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,980
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

451
00:32:23,983 --> 00:32:26,736
Oh my, I've never seen
anything like this before.

452
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,237
I must try this.

453
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,656
It looks so good.

454
00:32:29,739 --> 00:32:31,616
I heard this area
is known for its seafood.

455
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,992
It's so plump.

456
00:32:50,593 --> 00:32:52,011
Slow down.

457
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:00,538
You can use this.

458
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:02,665
Thank you.

459
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:09,630
What? What's wrong?

460
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,842
-Over there.
-What is it?

461
00:34:14,343 --> 00:34:15,845
-A spider.
-What?

462
00:34:15,928 --> 00:34:16,763
A spider.

463
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:19,098
-What? A spider? Where?
-A spider.

464
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,102
Over there.

465
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,229
Can't you see it? Over there.

466
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:27,565
Just stay here.

467
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:28,983
Hold on.

468
00:34:30,818 --> 00:34:32,195
A bit lower.

469
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:33,863
-Lower?
-Just a bit lower.

470
00:34:33,946 --> 00:34:35,907
-Here?
-Yeah, that's it.

471
00:34:35,990 --> 00:34:38,159
-All right. Hold on.
-Hurry. Do it.

472
00:34:38,701 --> 00:34:39,535
Okay.

473
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,289
-I can't stay still!
-Just hold on!

474
00:34:43,372 --> 00:34:45,249
I can't do it if you rush me!

475
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:46,918
Seriously.

476
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:50,671
Could they be more indecent?

477
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:51,798
-Just give it to me.
-Hold on.

478
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,257
-Hold on. That's it!
-Hold on.

479
00:34:53,341 --> 00:34:54,425
Oh no!

480
00:35:05,228 --> 00:35:06,145
It's under there.

481
00:35:06,229 --> 00:35:07,105
Hurry.

482
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:09,232
Mr. Gong?

483
00:35:26,999 --> 00:35:28,751
I wasn't afraid or anything,

484
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:30,878
but spiders can be venomous.

485
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,839
Spiders that size can't be venomous.

486
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,507
You never know.

487
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:37,844
You're not going to kill it?

488
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,428
You should never kill spiders.

489
00:35:39,512 --> 00:35:40,847
Or they'll appear in your dreams.

490
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:46,352
I sent it off on its way,
so let's close the window now.

491
00:36:08,332 --> 00:36:10,334
Today was tough,

492
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,505
but the babies were really cute,
weren't they?

493
00:36:16,757 --> 00:36:17,592
Yes.

494
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:22,430
You were better at taking care of babies
than I thought.

495
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,934
It's all thanks to you.

496
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:29,854
You should sleep now.

497
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,690
We'll take the first boat out.

498
00:36:33,274 --> 00:36:34,192
Right, okay.

499
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:36,777
Good night.

500
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:02,345
GEOBUK INN

501
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,195
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

502
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:29,408
How'd you find out?

503
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,576
That's not important.

504
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,537
Call off

505
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:35,539
the engagement.

506
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:40,378
-Mom.
-Why would you go to hell on my behalf?

507
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:43,756
I'll take care of my own life.

508
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:45,883
So you just

509
00:39:46,384 --> 00:39:47,510
live your life.

510
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:49,887
It won't be hell.

511
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,098
I'm fine with it.

512
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,891
Don't worry too much.

513
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:55,559
Do you love Ha-yeong?

514
00:39:58,354 --> 00:39:59,563
Do you love her?

515
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,110
I need to get my suit fitted.

516
00:40:05,027 --> 00:40:06,070
I should get going.

517
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:11,534
Reconsider it.

518
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:14,912
I want you

519
00:40:15,996 --> 00:40:20,000
to get married to someone you truly love.

520
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:30,052
That dress is from
Hera Wang's new collection, right?

521
00:40:30,553 --> 00:40:31,887
Of course, ma'am.

522
00:40:31,971 --> 00:40:35,474
We prepared the shoes and accessories
from the same collection as well.

523
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,392
Great.

524
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:46,193
I heard Ha-yeong
spouted some nonsense to you.

525
00:40:46,861 --> 00:40:49,655
She only said what she did
because she's getting cold feet.

526
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:51,907
Women are like that, you know.

527
00:40:51,991 --> 00:40:54,118
I even asked my assistant
to run away with me

528
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:55,828
when my date was set.

529
00:40:57,663 --> 00:40:59,290
I was so dramatic.

530
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:03,002
I don't think you need to worry.

531
00:41:03,586 --> 00:41:05,963
All right. I'm glad to hear that.

532
00:41:06,046 --> 00:41:08,424
Help her get on the right path.

533
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:12,553
She might be a little immature,
but she's still the complete package.

534
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:14,889
She's pretty, has a nice body,
and a good personality.

535
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:15,973
I guess

536
00:41:16,474 --> 00:41:18,642
she really does take a lot after me.

537
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:21,353
Here comes the bride.

538
00:42:12,154 --> 00:42:12,988
Ji-hyeok.

539
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,074
Ji-hyeok!

540
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,622
My goodness, look at you.
You're completely swept away.

541
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:24,667
Go and stand next to her.
Let's see the complete picture.

542
00:42:25,251 --> 00:42:27,378
Don't bother. I'll just go with this one.

543
00:42:27,461 --> 00:42:28,379
Why you…

544
00:42:30,506 --> 00:42:31,465
Give me a second.

545
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:41,267
You were pouting and sulking
the whole fitting.

546
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:45,104
I was so embarrassed
I couldn't look Ji-hyeok in the eyes.

547
00:42:45,187 --> 00:42:47,481
I told you I really don't want to do this.

548
00:42:49,191 --> 00:42:50,568
Don't you dare say that again.

549
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:58,450
We can deliver the dress you saw today

550
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,995
on the day of the engagement ceremony.

551
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,329
Would you like that?

552
00:43:02,871 --> 00:43:03,831
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

553
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:05,833
All right.

554
00:43:06,458 --> 00:43:08,752
Mom, Ji-hyeok wants to have dinner
with me.

555
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:13,173
Look at him making such an effort.

556
00:43:14,174 --> 00:43:15,509
-Go on.
-Okay.

557
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:17,469
Wait, stop right there.

558
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:20,431
Make sure that mouth of yours
doesn't run wild.

559
00:43:21,265 --> 00:43:22,224
Goodness.

560
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:36,030
Hello?

561
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,865
Hey, Ji-hyeok.

562
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,992
You're with Ha-yeong, right?

563
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,118
Can I speak to her?

564
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:44,413
Oh, she went to the bathroom.

565
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,081
Did she?

566
00:43:46,165 --> 00:43:47,124
All right.

567
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:49,084
Enjoy your date

568
00:43:49,168 --> 00:43:51,170
and have a nice dinner.

569
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:52,838
Thank you.

570
00:44:10,564 --> 00:44:12,316
JUN BABY STUDIO

571
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,031
Ms. Yu?

572
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,201
Take responsibility for what you did!

573
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,495
Take responsibility for kissing me!

574
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,915
-But you kissed me.
-Whatever.

575
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,585
Who cares who initiated?
That's not the problem right now.

576
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:34,171
Ji-hyeok saw it.

577
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:37,758
-What?
-He saw us kissing.

578
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:41,220
He called me a mistress
and a home-wrecker.

579
00:44:41,303 --> 00:44:43,013
He doesn't want Ms. Go to get hurt,

580
00:44:43,097 --> 00:44:46,850
so he's rushing the engagement ceremony
and the wedding.

581
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:03,784
I kept my promise.

582
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:05,202
But look at me now.

583
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:06,787
All because of that stupid promise,

584
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:08,872
I'm being called a mistress when I'm not.

585
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:12,126
I couldn't even tell him
that Ms. Go is the liar!

586
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:14,461
Seriously!
What are you going to do about this?

587
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,213
Take responsibility!

588
00:45:16,296 --> 00:45:18,382
You take responsibility for everything!

589
00:45:30,227 --> 00:45:32,312
Console me. Pat-pat.

590
00:45:46,118 --> 00:45:48,120
Do you really not want to marry Mr. Gong

591
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,164
that badly?

592
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:56,128
I mean, he's good at his job,
and he seems like a decent guy.

593
00:45:57,045 --> 00:45:58,422
And you two are close friends.

594
00:45:58,505 --> 00:46:00,424
You don't marry someone
just because you're close to them.

595
00:46:00,507 --> 00:46:02,009
You marry the person you love.

596
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:06,263
I like you.
How many times do I have to tell you?

597
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,350
What I meant was

598
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,437
you should take your time
and think about it.

599
00:46:15,939 --> 00:46:17,232
I did.

600
00:46:17,316 --> 00:46:19,359
I thought about what I really wanted

601
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,445
and how I could find happiness.

602
00:46:23,071 --> 00:46:24,865
That's why I'm here right now.

603
00:46:30,370 --> 00:46:32,331
Can't you consider me?

604
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:39,254
Hey, Yu Ha-yeong.

605
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,340
Ji-hyeok.

606
00:46:43,842 --> 00:46:45,177
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

607
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:47,888
You're the one who's lost your mind.

608
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:48,805
Leave.

609
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:54,645
You don't know anything.
This is just a big misunderstanding.

610
00:46:54,728 --> 00:46:55,729
A misunderstanding?

611
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:58,023
Then tell me. What do I not know?

612
00:46:58,732 --> 00:47:01,026
The truth is, Mr. Kim and Go Da-rim--

613
00:47:01,109 --> 00:47:02,319
Ms. Yu!

614
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:19,336
I'd like to talk to Mr. Gong alone.

615
00:47:21,838 --> 00:47:22,839
Can you please leave us?

616
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:36,311
I'm sorry.

617
00:47:38,021 --> 00:47:39,565
It's all my fault.

618
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:42,025
I got drunk that day and made a mistake.

619
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,277
If that day was a mistake,

620
00:47:43,360 --> 00:47:44,695
what was today?

621
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:46,989
What did I just see?

622
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,157
I was trying to persuade Ms. Yu.

623
00:47:51,368 --> 00:47:52,828
You're a coward until the end.

624
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,080
You have no feelings,

625
00:47:55,789 --> 00:47:57,291
but Ha-yeong is clinging onto you?

626
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:02,045
-That's not what I meant.
-Do you not even care about Ms. Go?

627
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,466
Without knowing what sort of man
her husband is,

628
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:09,136
she looks after her child
and even works full-time.

629
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:13,307
Do you not even think about your wife,
who works tirelessly every day?

630
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:15,434
You know,

631
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:18,270
Ms. Go shows up to work
even on the weekends without complaint

632
00:48:18,895 --> 00:48:21,023
and throws herself
into every difficult task.

633
00:48:22,149 --> 00:48:23,150
If it's a demanding task,

634
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,360
she'll work through the night
to complete it perfectly.

635
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,781
-All for her family.
-Mr. Gong.

636
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,534
I know better than anyone

637
00:48:34,286 --> 00:48:36,163
how much Da-rim loves her family

638
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,874
and how responsible she is.

639
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:41,168
And I also…

640
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,296
love Da-rim.

641
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:49,760
I'll protect her until the end.

642
00:48:58,769 --> 00:49:00,145
This won't ever happen again.

643
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,063
What if it does?

644
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:02,064
It won't.

645
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:05,317
Ever.

646
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,402
If something like this ever happens again,

647
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:09,655
I'll kill you…

648
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,449
with my own hands.

649
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:21,041
Let me ask you.

650
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,544
Are you sure you're doing this

651
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:27,005
purely because of Ms. Yu?

652
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,678
Could there be another reason?

653
00:50:08,296 --> 00:50:09,172
You're late.

654
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:12,467
Yeah.

655
00:50:12,551 --> 00:50:14,177
Jun is sleeping at my place.

656
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:17,889
Hold on.

657
00:50:18,515 --> 00:50:20,142
Hey. What the heck?

658
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:21,893
What happened to your lips?

659
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,610
That stings.

660
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,320
Just stay still.

661
00:50:32,404 --> 00:50:33,655
You need to suck it up. Come here.

662
00:50:39,828 --> 00:50:40,662
There.

663
00:50:45,751 --> 00:50:47,794
I saw the article about the engagement.

664
00:50:49,129 --> 00:50:51,423
I'm sorry for doubting you
and Mr. Gong last time.

665
00:50:52,591 --> 00:50:53,633
I overreacted.

666
00:50:54,426 --> 00:50:56,845
I told you there was nothing between us.

667
00:50:58,388 --> 00:50:59,389
It's…

668
00:51:01,308 --> 00:51:02,434
all over now.

669
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,147
What is?

670
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,484
I'm done applying the ointment.

671
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:14,821
Right. Thank you.

672
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:18,033
Did you really walk into a pole?

673
00:51:18,617 --> 00:51:20,035
You sure you didn't fight someone?

674
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:24,956
Listen.

675
00:51:26,541 --> 00:51:28,210
-Da-rim.
-Yeah?

676
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:31,379
The thing is,

677
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:33,840
I have

678
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:35,759
something to tell you.

679
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:37,135
What is it?

680
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:39,429
Well…

681
00:51:41,097 --> 00:51:44,184
I really thought about it a lot.

682
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:47,854
I think…

683
00:51:57,614 --> 00:51:58,490
I…

684
00:52:02,452 --> 00:52:05,288
-So, I--
-I'm really sorry, but can you hurry up?

685
00:52:05,372 --> 00:52:06,706
I really need to use the bathroom.

686
00:52:10,877 --> 00:52:13,046
You should go. It's nothing important.

687
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:16,842
-You sure? Then tell me later, okay?
-All right.

688
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,385
Take Jun with you.

689
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:20,679
Get some rest.

690
00:52:20,762 --> 00:52:21,596
Will do.

691
00:52:39,239 --> 00:52:40,657
Anything more concrete?

692
00:52:40,740 --> 00:52:43,451
These two were committing
all sorts of indecent acts

693
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:45,287
behind closed doors,

694
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,581
but they never even held hands outside.

695
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:50,750
They're very good at hiding things
in public.

696
00:52:50,834 --> 00:52:52,252
Indecent acts?

697
00:52:53,879 --> 00:52:55,088
You sure they even did such things?

698
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,006
Yes!

699
00:52:56,089 --> 00:52:57,674
They were in the room, and they were…

700
00:52:59,843 --> 00:53:01,845
My goodness, how do I put this?
It's so embarrassing.

701
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:02,929
The two of them were…

702
00:53:03,638 --> 00:53:05,390
Just forget it. You can go now.

703
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:07,183
Yes, ma'am.

704
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,281
Like father, like son, huh?

705
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,578
TEAM LEADER GONG JI-HYEOK

706
00:53:26,661 --> 00:53:30,040
THE QUADRUPLET FAMILY: WE FEEL REASSURED
WITH NATURAL BEBE BY OUR SIDE

707
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,296
Can you take a look at this?

708
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:42,886
You should go home early
if there's nothing urgent to take care of.

709
00:53:42,969 --> 00:53:44,179
Your engagement ceremony's tomorrow.

710
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:46,014
I'm fine.

711
00:53:46,598 --> 00:53:49,392
You're clearly not. You look rough.

712
00:53:50,185 --> 00:53:51,102
Go home and rest.

713
00:53:51,186 --> 00:53:52,228
All right.

714
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:08,536
Are you sure you're doing this

715
00:54:09,120 --> 00:54:11,039
purely because of Ms. Yu?

716
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,084
Could there be another reason?

717
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:56,167
Reconsider it.

718
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:57,877
I want you

719
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,674
to get married to someone you truly love.

720
00:55:28,116 --> 00:55:29,284
Da-rim.

721
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:30,326
Hey, Seon-u.

722
00:55:30,827 --> 00:55:31,786
Jun!

723
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,122
Where are you coming from?

724
00:55:34,205 --> 00:55:35,832
-Did you buy something?
-What?

725
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,250
Oh, it's a suit for Jun.

726
00:55:37,333 --> 00:55:39,919
It's for Jae-dong's son's
first birthday party tomorrow.

727
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,673
Jun, you're going to look so handsome.

728
00:55:43,757 --> 00:55:45,675
You must be so excited,
you little cutie pie.

729
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,053
This is for you.

730
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,138
-What?
-Shoes.

731
00:55:50,722 --> 00:55:51,973
Why would you buy me shoes?

732
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,767
The ones you have looked pretty worn out.

733
00:55:53,850 --> 00:55:56,603
Seriously? Thank you.

734
00:55:56,686 --> 00:55:58,021
Wear them tomorrow.

735
00:55:58,104 --> 00:55:59,564
I heard they're going all out
at a fancy hotel.

736
00:55:59,647 --> 00:56:01,107
-Let's go.
-Oh my gosh, what a surprise.

737
00:56:01,191 --> 00:56:02,025
Jun, give me your hand.

738
00:56:02,984 --> 00:56:05,361
Jun, we should thank your dad.

739
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:07,405
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

740
00:56:07,489 --> 00:56:08,490
One more time.

741
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,575
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

742
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:11,868
Thank you.

743
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:13,328
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

744
00:56:15,997 --> 00:56:17,499
-That was fun, wasn't it? One more time?
-One more time?

745
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,833
-Yes.
-Let's do it.

746
00:56:18,917 --> 00:56:20,418
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

747
00:56:23,588 --> 00:56:24,422
I'm so tired.

748
00:56:24,506 --> 00:56:26,382
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

749
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,092
Buy me a drink too.

750
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:12,887
What the…

751
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,264
How did you know I was here?

752
00:57:14,347 --> 00:57:15,473
Do you even have to ask?

753
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:17,225
You always go to the same places.

754
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:21,271
You can't have a bachelor party
by yourself.

755
00:57:22,730 --> 00:57:23,773
We should party together.

756
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:28,153
You little punk.

757
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:37,745
Are you okay?

758
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:39,789
What do you mean?

759
00:57:39,873 --> 00:57:41,207
It's a business wedding.

760
00:57:41,791 --> 00:57:43,251
I don't know
if I should congratulate you or not.

761
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,714
Then again,

762
00:57:48,715 --> 00:57:49,924
seeing my older sisters

763
00:57:50,675 --> 00:57:53,052
made me realize that marriage
isn't something to be celebrated.

764
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,430
My oldest sister dated her husband
for ten years, but they got divorced

765
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:56,973
after a year of being married.

766
00:57:57,974 --> 00:57:59,684
My second oldest sister has three kids,

767
00:58:00,685 --> 00:58:03,605
but her husband cheated on her,
so they're fighting on the daily.

768
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,901
You might actually be better off.

769
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:11,154
You don't expect anything
from each other to begin with.

770
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,198
There's no chance
for disappointment either.

771
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:17,869
That's true.

772
00:58:18,369 --> 00:58:19,454
Yeah.

773
00:58:22,540 --> 00:58:24,292
-Okay!
-Okay!

774
00:58:26,544 --> 00:58:27,754
Slow down. Hold on.

775
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:31,341
-Let's go for round two!
-You're so heavy.

776
00:58:31,424 --> 00:58:32,759
-Round two!
-Watch my neck. Hang on.

777
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:33,718
Karaoke!

778
00:58:34,761 --> 00:58:36,387
Let's go to karaoke!

779
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:37,847
Jump!

780
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:47,482
I'm no longer that guy

781
00:58:47,565 --> 00:58:51,152
Who used to tear up
Whenever I saw your face

782
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:54,197
Don't look at me like that

783
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:58,034
Your cruelty only fills me with regret

784
00:58:58,117 --> 00:58:59,494
Let's go!

785
00:59:00,078 --> 00:59:01,996
But it's definitely over

786
00:59:02,080 --> 00:59:06,626
It only helped you forget me

787
00:59:06,709 --> 00:59:10,129
You would've been relieved

788
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:13,341
That breaking up was the right call

789
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:16,177
All right, start!

790
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:23,977
As the sun sets, my footsteps take me away

791
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:26,521
When I opened my eyes

792
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,232
I found myself in a place

793
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:31,901
That I thought I had forgotten

794
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:36,197
Perhaps, I still have

795
00:59:36,281 --> 00:59:41,286
Some ill will towards you

796
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:43,162
But now

797
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:46,249
I want to be free

798
00:59:46,332 --> 00:59:52,130
Time will solve everything

799
00:59:52,213 --> 00:59:55,258
That's what I believed

800
00:59:55,341 --> 01:00:00,680
Maybe that was foolish of me

801
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:02,181
Now

802
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:05,268
I just want to let it all go…

803
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:17,799
Jun, you're going to look so handsome.
You must be so excited.

804
01:01:17,882 --> 01:01:19,509
-One, two, three.
-One, two, three.

805
01:02:25,491 --> 01:02:28,369
We'll be starting in five minutes.
You can make your way to the hall now.

806
01:02:41,007 --> 01:02:42,633
This place is so nice.

807
01:02:57,023 --> 01:02:59,233
Auntie! Auntie Da-rim!

808
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:01,068
Jun, there you are!

809
01:03:01,152 --> 01:03:02,028
Auntie!

810
01:03:09,660 --> 01:03:10,620
"Auntie"?

811
01:03:11,621 --> 01:03:12,955
Auntie Da-rim!

812
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:14,582
-Oh my goodness.
-Jun, you're here!

813
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:17,502
-Auntie!
-What?

814
01:03:18,336 --> 01:03:20,087
You scared me!

815
01:03:20,171 --> 01:03:22,381
Jun, should we check out that place later?

816
01:03:57,708 --> 01:04:02,630
DYNAMITE KISS

817
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,412
Mom!

818
01:04:34,495 --> 01:04:38,791
Just focus on yourself
and follow your heart.

819
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:40,710
And it turns out Ji-hyeok already knew

820
01:04:40,793 --> 01:04:42,169
that you two aren't married.

821
01:04:42,253 --> 01:04:44,547
What about Da-rim?
Does she know he knows? Is she okay?

822
01:04:44,630 --> 01:04:45,882
It's all over for me now.

823
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,633
Who are you, really?

824
01:04:47,717 --> 01:04:49,218
Are you really Kim Seon-u's wife?

825
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:52,930
I'll be taking care of Da-rim from now on.

826
01:04:53,014 --> 01:04:55,474
Mr. Gong, I'm in front of your place.

827
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,602
Could you hear me out for a second?

828
01:05:01,939 --> 01:05:06,819
