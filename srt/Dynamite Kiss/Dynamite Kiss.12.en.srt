00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:52,677
EPISODE 12

3
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,013
Look at it. I'm fine.

4
00:00:55,096 --> 00:00:56,848
-What are we going to do about your wrist?
-Excuse me.

5
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,271
I'm sorry.

6
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:05,982
It's okay. No one got hurt.

7
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,275
Why are you crying?

8
00:01:07,358 --> 00:01:08,693
I'm sorry.

9
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:10,361
I'm sorry.

10
00:01:10,445 --> 00:01:11,362
My goodness.

11
00:01:13,656 --> 00:01:17,243
After the divorce, my ex-husband
stopped paying for child support.

12
00:01:17,327 --> 00:01:19,537
I needed a proper job,

13
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,123
so I applied to Natural BeBe.

14
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,627
Was it to the Mother TF Team?

15
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:27,128
Yes.

16
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:30,924
I was an assistant manager
at another baby product company,

17
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:32,759
so I had high hopes,

18
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,345
but my application didn't pass.

19
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,555
I was devastated.

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:42,268
I felt utterly useless.

21
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:46,064
That's not true.

22
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:49,818
I think I took out my anger about my life
on Natural BeBe.

23
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,945
I posted malicious comments
on online mom communities

24
00:01:52,445 --> 00:01:54,280
and called customer service

25
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,491
to curse out the representatives
and make issues out of nothing.

26
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:00,870
I'll gladly accept
any punishment you see fit.

27
00:02:01,996 --> 00:02:03,373
I'll also post on the online communities

28
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,960
and come clean about what I did
and explain that it was all fabricated.

29
00:02:07,043 --> 00:02:08,545
I'm really sorry.

30
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:13,258
Gosh, I'm hungry.

31
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:15,009
What should we eat for dinner?

32
00:02:16,010 --> 00:02:16,886
Sushi?

33
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:18,513
Or pasta?

34
00:02:18,596 --> 00:02:19,472
Fried chicken?

35
00:02:20,348 --> 00:02:22,767
I'm fine. I'm not really hungry.

36
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:27,856
You don't seem to be in a good mood.

37
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:34,696
Da-rim.

38
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,198
Everything worked out.

39
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:38,825
It's done.

40
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,119
Okay?

41
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:45,331
Okay?

42
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:50,086
I probably took
Ms. Lee So-yeong's spot, right?

43
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:56,843
If I didn't lie to get hired,

44
00:02:57,886 --> 00:03:00,638
she would've been on the team.

45
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:02,557
You're reading too much into it.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,350
Even if it wasn't her,

47
00:03:05,226 --> 00:03:06,185
I'm sure

48
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,398
someone more qualified
would've gotten my spot.

49
00:03:11,733 --> 00:03:12,609
And that someone

50
00:03:13,234 --> 00:03:16,988
could've been in a more urgent
and desperate situation than me.

51
00:03:18,907 --> 00:03:21,492
It makes me question
the choices I've made.

52
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:40,220
Well done, everyone.

53
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,348
-Good job, everyone!
-We're done.

54
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,475
-It's over now, Da-rim.
-Team dinner tonight?

55
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,726
How about a refreshing beer?

56
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,144
-That sounds so nice.
-Excellent idea.

57
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:49,562
-Right, Mr. Kang?
-What should we eat?

58
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,564
-Grilled intestines.
-Ms. Go Da-rim.

59
00:03:52,482 --> 00:03:53,983
How's your injury?

60
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:56,569
It's healing.

61
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:58,238
Is that so?

62
00:04:02,033 --> 00:04:02,992
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

63
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,494

64
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:13,878
Is this real?

65
00:04:14,629 --> 00:04:15,463
Yeah.

66
00:04:16,047 --> 00:04:16,881
That woman

67
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,926
-was never married.
-What?

68
00:04:20,009 --> 00:04:21,552

70
00:04:23,638 --> 00:04:26,432
Are you saying she lied to get a job?

71
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,685
You shouldn't be angry at her.

72
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:30,186
You should actually be thankful.

73
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:31,104
Why would I?

74
00:04:31,187 --> 00:04:32,355
She created an opportunity.

75
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:36,734
An opportunity
to completely crush Gong Ji-hyeok.

76
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:41,948
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

77
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:49,706
You must've been so upset.

78
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:52,500
The company should've taken
better preventive measures.

79
00:04:53,668 --> 00:04:54,544
It's okay, ma'am.

80
00:04:54,627 --> 00:04:56,754
The company is wholly at fault for this.

81
00:04:57,338 --> 00:04:59,799
Speaking of which,
let me formally request that we establish

82
00:04:59,882 --> 00:05:01,592
clear guidelines for protecting CS staff

83
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,137
and implement mental-health support.

84
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:05,805
That's a good idea.

85
00:05:05,888 --> 00:05:07,098
We'll work on that.

86
00:05:07,765 --> 00:05:10,268
-Oh my. Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

87
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:16,399
Also,

88
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,068
we'd like for you
to do a press interview, Ms. Go.

89
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,028
Is that okay with you?

90
00:05:20,653 --> 00:05:22,322
-Pardon?
-You need to clear your name.

91
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:26,326
I think it'd be even better

92
00:05:26,409 --> 00:05:28,077
if you do it with Mr. Kim Seon-u
as a couple.

93
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,621
You could even talk about
working together.

94
00:05:32,540 --> 00:05:35,084
A press interview?
Does it mean she's going to be on TV?

95
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,712
You'll be famous nationwide.

96
00:05:37,795 --> 00:05:38,880
You have to do it, no matter what.

97
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:42,508
Then I'll schedule one
as soon as possible.

98
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:44,135
That might be difficult.

99
00:05:46,137 --> 00:05:49,140
Ms. Lee So-yeong will inevitably come up
during the interview.

100
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:50,975
If the issue is highlighted again,

101
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:53,061
she'll come under fire.

102
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:57,356
She already confessed and apologized.

103
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,318
Do we have any reason
to push her to the brink?

104
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,405
I agree with him.
I think it'd be best not to do it.

105
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:06,991
Is that so?

106
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:13,664
All right then.

107
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:16,584
But let us at least post an announcement
on the company bulletin board.

108
00:06:16,667 --> 00:06:18,628
To highlight your exceptional service.

109
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,755
You'd be okay with that much, right?

110
00:06:20,838 --> 00:06:22,131
Yes.

111
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:29,972
You were right.

112
00:06:31,224 --> 00:06:32,809
Ji-hyeok knows Go Da-rim

113
00:06:33,726 --> 00:06:34,811
is single.

114
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:37,522
Well done.

115
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,732
Just keep praising him
and stroking his ego.

116
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,277
The higher he rises…

117
00:06:45,696 --> 00:06:48,074
the more painful it'll be when he falls.

118
00:06:57,416 --> 00:06:59,377
Ms. Go, we saw the announcement
on the company bulletin board.

119
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,546
Congratulations on being
Employee of the Month.

120
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:02,839
Did you get that injury
while saving the baby?

121
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,257
You're so cool.

122
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:06,926
Gosh, I'm flattered.
I didn't do anything special.

123
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:08,970
Ms. Go, our Employee of the Month,

124
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:12,765
always had a strong moral compass
and acted with sincerity.

125
00:07:12,849 --> 00:07:15,309
Of course.
Ms. Go, our Employee of the Month,

126
00:07:15,393 --> 00:07:17,061
is known for her unwavering
sense of responsibility.

127
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:18,271
That's right.

128
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:19,439
Enjoy your lunch.

129
00:07:19,522 --> 00:07:21,899
-Thank you. You too.
-You too.

130
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,822
You're the Employee of the Month's
team leader.

131
00:07:27,905 --> 00:07:28,865
How does it feel?

132
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:30,783
Well…

133
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:34,454
It feels nice.

134
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:37,498
I see.

135
00:07:37,582 --> 00:07:40,209
You know, Da-rim loves beef.

136
00:07:40,293 --> 00:07:41,919
Come on now, Go-eun.

137
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:43,754
You don't need to say that out loud.

138
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:47,842
There's no way Mr. Gong would just ignore
such a momentous occasion.

139
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:50,803
After all, Ms. Go,
our Employee of the Month,

140
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:53,139
brought such prestige to our team.

141
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:56,517
Of course. If he's at all grateful,
he can't just ignore it.

142
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:57,935
-For sure.
-For sure.

143
00:07:58,019 --> 00:08:00,229
You all should know better now.

144
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,606
Mr. Gong would never.

145
00:08:01,689 --> 00:08:05,026
-There's no way.
-There's no way.

146
00:08:05,109 --> 00:08:06,777
It's time for a proper team dinner.

147
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,362
Beef.

148
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,199
It'll be my treat.

149
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,872
-Gong Ji-hyeok!
-Gong Ji-hyeok!

150
00:08:17,955 --> 00:08:19,790
I'll search for a restaurant immediately.

151
00:08:19,874 --> 00:08:20,791
Korean beef.

152
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:22,418
-Korean beef?
-Yes, please.

153
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,920
Might as well go all out.

154
00:08:24,003 --> 00:08:27,381
-That sounds so nice.
-We might as well if we can.

155
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:29,926
Let's step out for coffee.

156
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,136
-It'll be my treat.
-Oh my gosh.

157
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:34,722
That's the Employee of the Month's
assistant manager for you.

158
00:08:34,805 --> 00:08:36,766
You can tell you're a learned man.

159
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,767
Come on, Da-rim.

160
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,312
Sorry, I think I'll pass.
I don't feel too great.

161
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,814
You guys go ahead.

162
00:08:48,945 --> 00:08:50,696
She barely ate her food.

163
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,075
What's going on?
She's turning down free coffee?

164
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:59,330
This is totally your style, right?

165
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,541
But you always wear stuff like this.

166
00:09:03,751 --> 00:09:05,086
What a pretty color.

167
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:12,426
You said you had a kid
who goes to daycare, right?

168
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,720
-Yes.
-Great.

169
00:09:14,804 --> 00:09:16,389
Can you suggest an outfit for me?

170
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,224
Something suitable

171
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,936
for a talent show at a daycare.

172
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,187
Pardon? Where?

173
00:09:25,606 --> 00:09:27,608
Gosh, that's so pretty.

174
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:28,943
-You think so?
-Yeah.

175
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:32,905
A talent show.

176
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,365
Show?

177
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:35,908
You're going to a show?

178
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:36,826
What?

179
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:39,662
Yeah, I'm going to a friend's show.

180
00:09:40,997 --> 00:09:43,416
I mean, a friend's party.

181
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:45,501
Right, so what sort of party?

182
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:46,586
What's the theme?

183
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:51,340
The theme is

184
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:53,301
just a gathering of friends.

185
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:56,596
We'll be singing and dancing.
I guess you can call that the theme.

186
00:09:57,805 --> 00:10:00,433
Okay. You should've asked me.
That's my specialty.

187
00:10:01,142 --> 00:10:03,436
Let's see here.

188
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,353
Oh my.

189
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:07,064
This one's great.

190
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,651
Well, you see, the guests at the party

191
00:10:10,735 --> 00:10:12,236
will be on the young side.

192
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,779
That might be a bit too much.

193
00:10:13,863 --> 00:10:14,822
They're young?

194
00:10:14,905 --> 00:10:15,740
How young?

195
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,033
Well…

196
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,369
They're a lot younger than I am.

197
00:10:21,954 --> 00:10:22,788
Listen.

198
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:25,374
Don't be intimidated.

199
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:30,171
You need to go all out
when you're with a younger crowd.

200
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,050
Can you show us
a few more party dresses like this?

201
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,092
Yes, ma'am.

202
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:43,309
-Goodbye, Jun.
-Bye, Jun!

203
00:10:43,392 --> 00:10:45,061
Bye.

204
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,188
Jun, your dad should be here soon.

205
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,190
We'll wait with you.

206
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,025
Jun!

207
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,736
Hello.

208
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,613
-Hello.
-Hello.

209
00:10:55,696 --> 00:10:57,948
My goodness, did you wait long?

210
00:10:58,032 --> 00:10:59,116
I'm sorry.

211
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,202
I had to pick up the guitar from a friend.

212
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:03,412
It's fine.

213
00:11:03,496 --> 00:11:04,664
Let's go home.

214
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:06,999
Give me your bag.

215
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:13,964
Why the long face?

216
00:11:14,965 --> 00:11:15,800
What happened?

217
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:19,095
Did seeing your friends rehearse
make you nervous?

218
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,930
-No.
-Don't worry about a thing.

219
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:23,516
I'm an excellent guitarist.

220
00:11:25,893 --> 00:11:28,854
I'm sure all your friends
will end up becoming jealous of you.

221
00:11:32,108 --> 00:11:33,317
Let's go and practice.

222
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,568
-Should we?
-Yeah.

223
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,070
Let's go!

224
00:11:36,153 --> 00:11:39,532
NEW SPRING WOODS KINDERGARTEN

225
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:40,783
Be careful.

226
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:42,993
All right, all right.

227
00:11:43,661 --> 00:11:45,830
I'll come visit
when Da-rim has some free time.

228
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:48,290
Don't even get me started.

229
00:11:48,374 --> 00:11:52,253
That company can't run without Da-rim.

230
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:53,921
She's so busy.

231
00:11:54,004 --> 00:11:55,506
All right, take care.

232
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,049
Bye.

233
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:00,177
I'm home.

234
00:12:00,261 --> 00:12:01,178
Da-rim.

235
00:12:02,012 --> 00:12:03,013
Come here.

236
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,516
I was just on the phone
with your aunt Myeong-ja,

237
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,601
and she insists we come by to visit.

238
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:10,354
You know,
for the fresh country air and stuff.

239
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:12,481
That sounds nice.

240
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,986
It's been a while since I last saw her.

241
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,530
We saw her often when Dad was alive.

242
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:22,116
We used to have
marsh snail-catching contests.

243
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:23,242
That's right.

244
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,994
You and your dad always won.

245
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:27,872
You wouldn't stop
even in the freezing cold.

246
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:28,831
Who could beat that?

247
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,291
Did I?

248
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:35,296
You really take after your dad.

249
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:39,675
He'd be so proud of you.

250
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:42,887
You're hardworking, tenacious,

251
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:45,389
and honest, just like him.

252
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,603
Oh, it's time for dinner.

253
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:01,614
LIVE WITH HONESTY

254
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,366
Dad.

255
00:13:07,161 --> 00:13:08,037
Sorry.

256
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:12,875
LIVE WITH HONESTY

257
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:25,888
MOTHER TF TEAM CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT

258
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,478
2025 MOTHER TF TEAM CANDIDATE ASSESSMENT

259
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:46,992
YANG HUI-SUK, LEE GO-EUN, GO DA-RIM

260
00:13:48,202 --> 00:13:50,246
EVALUATOR: MA JONG-GU
RESULT: PASS

261
00:13:50,329 --> 00:13:53,582
FAIL

262

MOTHER TF TEAM
GO DA-RIM

263
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:20,961
I HEREBY SUBMIT MY RESIGNATION AS OF
MAY 21, 2025 DUE TO PERSONAL REASONS

264
00:15:21,045 --> 00:15:23,881
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

265
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,891
I'm on board too.

266
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:38,979
I think we can trust him
with the development of the new product.

267
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,440
There won't be much
internal pushback either.

268
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,692
He handled the recent
mom-community incident well,

269
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,944
so our public opinion is good too.

270
00:15:46,487 --> 00:15:48,197
Look at how she's backing you up.

271
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:50,032
I expect you to show proper results.

272
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:53,494
Enough to silence any board opposition
about you becoming vice president.

273
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,624
Then I'd like to make a request.

274
00:15:59,124 --> 00:15:59,959
What is it?

275
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,335
If this project is a success,

276
00:16:03,003 --> 00:16:04,171
please renew the contracts

277
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:08,300
of all my team members
as full-time employees.

278
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:11,637
Why do you keep insisting on
helping those women?

279
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,682
We still have some time
before their internships end, right?

280
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,725
Yes, we do.

281
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:20,729
But having his team members
become full-time employees

282
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:21,814
when he gets promoted

283
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,858
might be better overall.

284
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:26,318
Right.

285
00:16:26,902 --> 00:16:28,404
To complement
the inauguration ceremony, huh?

286
00:16:28,946 --> 00:16:30,489
All right, go ahead.

287
00:16:30,572 --> 00:16:31,407
Yes, sir.

288
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:40,332
Ji-hyeok.

289
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,920
You can do this, right?

290
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:46,296
Of course, I can.

291
00:16:47,172 --> 00:16:49,925
I trust my team members
more than I trust myself.

292
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,178
That's why I'm so grateful for you.

293
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:55,556
-What?
-You hired them yourself.

294
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:59,560
They're all so talented in their own ways.

295
00:17:00,561 --> 00:17:02,021
You really have a good eye for people.

296
00:17:04,898 --> 00:17:06,525
-Don't mention it.
-Keep it up.

297
00:17:17,202 --> 00:17:22,124
Developing new products
is a core business of our company.

298
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:24,626
Can we take on such an important task?

299
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,961
Why not?

300
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:29,006
We've done pretty well for ourselves.

301
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:29,923
He's right.

302
00:17:30,007 --> 00:17:32,051
There were always
a few obstacles in the way,

303
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:33,719
but we've always produced good results.

304
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:35,888
I believe we can do this.

305
00:17:37,347 --> 00:17:38,390
Right, Da-rim?

306
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,811
I'm not sure

307
00:17:42,895 --> 00:17:46,106
if this is the right time
for me to say this,

308
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:49,985
but I have to tell you--

309
00:17:50,069 --> 00:17:50,986
Before that,

310
00:17:51,070 --> 00:17:52,780
there's one more important announcement.

311
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,115
-An important announcement?
-What is it?

312
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,200
What's more important than this?

313
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:57,993
If this project succeeds,

314
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,912
I've gotten the approval

315
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:03,582
to make all of you full-time employees.

316
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:05,667
-Really?
-Full-time employees?

317
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:08,921
-Oh my. I can't believe this.
-Full-time employees!

318
00:18:09,505 --> 00:18:12,091
We have Go Da-rim,
the Employee of the Month,

319
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,675
so of course we'll succeed.

320
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:14,968
Let's do our best, Da-rim.

321
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,514
Everyone, let's all become
full-time employees!

322
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:19,681
Let's do it!

323
00:18:21,391 --> 00:18:22,518
I can't believe this!

324
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:26,188
-I'm going to work really hard.
-Where do we begin?

325
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:30,442
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

326
00:18:30,526 --> 00:18:31,360
Mr. Gong.

327
00:18:32,277 --> 00:18:34,363
I don't think I can continue working here.

328
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:36,115
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:38,325 --> 00:18:39,159
I won't take this.

330
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,162
I appreciate the concern,

331
00:18:43,247 --> 00:18:44,790
but I've made up my mind.

332
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:47,126
With my mom out of the hospital,

333
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:48,502
a couple of part-time jobs

334
00:18:49,294 --> 00:18:52,381
should be enough to make
the interest payments and what I owe you.

335
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,382
It's not about money.

336
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,430
All applicants with notable
academic backgrounds,

337
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:02,015
experience, and qualifications

338
00:19:02,099 --> 00:19:03,892
were cut
during the application screening stage.

339
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,356
They even chose the ones
with the lowest interview scores.

340
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,357
Me included.

341
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:12,484
Why did they do that?

342
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,402
From the start,

343
00:19:14,236 --> 00:19:16,363
they weren't looking
to make a proper team.

344
00:19:19,658 --> 00:19:21,410
So everyone was right.

345
00:19:22,578 --> 00:19:25,080
A loser team just for show.

346
00:19:25,164 --> 00:19:26,331
That was true at first.

347
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:28,458
If I'm being honest,

348
00:19:30,085 --> 00:19:31,545
that's what I thought as well.

349
00:19:32,963 --> 00:19:34,256
Right.

350
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,425
When everyone had given up on this team,

351
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,094
there was one person

352
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,347
who didn't.

353
00:19:44,183 --> 00:19:45,058
Do you know who that is?

354
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:49,229
It's you, Da-rim.

355
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,442
Are you just going to let people
look down on you?

356
00:19:53,525 --> 00:19:54,985
Without even putting up a fight?

357
00:19:55,068 --> 00:19:55,944
This report

358
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,781
is the result of us running around
and putting our heads together.

359
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,452
For them, this job and this report

360
00:20:04,161 --> 00:20:06,163
are their livelihoods and lifelines.

361
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:13,128
JANG JIN-HUI, LEE GO-EUN,
GO DA-RIM, BAE NAN-SUK

362
00:20:26,850 --> 00:20:27,935
Da-rim,

363
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,187
you basically made our team.

364
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:32,773
You didn't steal

365
00:20:33,357 --> 00:20:35,192
someone else's spot.

366
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:40,405
You led this team to where it is now

367
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:43,742
and saved it from fading away.

368
00:20:49,748 --> 00:20:50,791
Ms. Bae Nan-suk.

369
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:52,834
Ms. Jang Jin-hui.

370
00:20:53,710 --> 00:20:54,544
Ms. Lee Go-eun.

371
00:20:56,338 --> 00:20:57,881
Help them become

372
00:20:58,590 --> 00:20:59,591
full-time employees here.

373
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:02,261
You can resign after that.

374
00:21:03,845 --> 00:21:04,763
All right?

375
00:21:08,225 --> 00:21:09,059
Okay.

376
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:12,104
Until then,

377
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,107
I'll do my absolute best.

378
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:43,552
What did I just see?
What's wrong with my eyes?

379
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,970
Am I overworked?

380
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:51,977
What's wrong with them?
Why are they hugging?

381
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,479
No, this can't be true.

382
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:55,689
Oh my goodness.

383
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,441
This can't be happening.

384
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:59,609
Why are they hugging? Why?

385
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:01,486
I'm serious!

386
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,904
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

387
00:22:02,988 --> 00:22:05,782
I'm not. I saw it with my own two eyes.

388
00:22:05,866 --> 00:22:06,908
With Mr. Gong?

389
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,744
-There's no way.
-I know what I saw.

390
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:11,038
-They were hugging.
-Then what about Mr. Kim?

391
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:12,873
-How could she bring him here?
-Spread out!

392
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,628
Do you have a cold?

393
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:20,714
Do you want something warm to drink?

394
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,842
No, it's fine.
We were just talking about work.

395
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,803
Oh, right.

396
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:28,597
Mr. Gong suggested

397
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,849
we all attend the baby fair
to brainstorm ideas

398
00:22:30,932 --> 00:22:32,559
for the new product.

399
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:35,020
Oh, I see. It sounds like

400
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:37,439
Mr. Gong made sure to only tell you that.

401
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,069
You two seem to have
a lot of conversations.

402
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:43,403
What?

403
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:47,032
It just seems like you and Mr. Gong

404
00:22:47,115 --> 00:22:49,785
have become exceptionally close recently.

405
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:53,455
Does it? I haven't noticed any changes.

406
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:54,498
Oh, I almost forgot.

407
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,418
Mr. Gong asked if we'd all be down
to go for a team dinner tonight.

408
00:22:59,586 --> 00:23:01,713
Will Mr. Kim be there as well?

409
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:04,758
No, it's going to be just us.

410
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:07,052
That's so cold.

411
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:09,137
Mr. Kim didn't even hesitate
to participate in the campaign

412
00:23:09,221 --> 00:23:11,098
for you and our team.

413
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:12,766
How could you not invite him?

414
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:15,060
Forget it.

415
00:23:15,936 --> 00:23:17,187
I won't be joining.

416
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:20,607
I can't either. I have plans.

417
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,610
I'm going to spend some quality time
with my husband.

418
00:23:33,870 --> 00:23:37,707
Next up is a performance
by the Moon Class,

419
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,668
"Heart, Heart, Mwah."

420
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:45,423
-Please give us a round of applause!
-Please give us a round of applause!

421
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:51,346
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah

422
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:54,850
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy

423
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,853
-I really love you, I really love you
-I really love you, I really love you

424
00:23:57,936 --> 00:24:00,188
-I don't know why I love you so
-I don't know why I love you so

425
00:24:01,356 --> 00:24:03,567
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah
-Heart, heart, mwah, mwah

426
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,195
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy
-I love you so much, Mommy and Daddy

427
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,822
Even when I see you over and over

428
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,157
And every day

429
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,242
Heart, mwah

430
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,745
Even when I see you over and over

431
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:16,830
Hey, Jun!

432
00:24:16,913 --> 00:24:18,039
Jun!

433
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:20,041
You're so cute. Oh my gosh!

434
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,043
Good job, Jun!

435
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,629
You're the best! You're adorable!

436
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,423
-Let's look over here.
-There, there.

437
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,925
-Let's look over here.
-Just one.

438
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,052
Ji-ho.

439
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:35,182
Ji-ho, can you look this way?

440
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:37,851
-Over here. Let's look here.
-There, there.

441
00:24:38,977 --> 00:24:44,316
Next, we'll welcome Kim Jun and his father
to the stage for their performance

442
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:45,775
of "Island Baby."

443
00:24:53,158 --> 00:24:56,244
Can we please have Jun's father
come to the stage?

444
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,010
Mr. Kim?

445
00:25:13,887 --> 00:25:15,555
I guess he's not here yet.

446
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:18,516
-The next performers are ready, right?
-Yes.

447
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:22,395
Jun, let's have the next team go first,

448
00:25:22,479 --> 00:25:24,522
and then you can go after that, okay?

449
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:26,191
Wait!

450
00:25:26,983 --> 00:25:29,527
I can do it. That's okay, right?

451
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:31,404
Who are you?

452
00:25:32,113 --> 00:25:33,031
I'm…

453
00:25:34,324 --> 00:25:35,242
Jun's best friend.

454
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,165
You got this.

455
00:25:42,249 --> 00:25:43,083
Let's do it.

456
00:26:00,392 --> 00:26:05,230
When Mom goes to the shade of the island

457
00:26:06,856 --> 00:26:11,778
To pick oysters

458
00:26:13,446 --> 00:26:18,410
The baby stays behind alone

459
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:25,458
And keeps watch over the house

460
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,677
-The sea sings
-The sea sings

461
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:41,725
-A lullaby
-A lullaby

462
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:46,980
-The baby rests their head on their arm
-The baby rests their head on their arm

463
00:26:48,857 --> 00:26:52,986
-And falls asleep
-And falls asleep

464
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:59,701
-And falls asleep
-And falls asleep

465
00:27:14,841 --> 00:27:16,009
Hello.

466
00:27:16,092 --> 00:27:17,927
-Jun.
-Dad!

467
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,181
My goodness.
Be careful, you're going to hurt yourself.

468
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:27,562
Dad, why were you late today?

469
00:27:27,645 --> 00:27:28,605
Sorry.

470
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:31,399
I'm really sorry about today.

471
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,069
But still, I saw you sing up there.

472
00:27:34,152 --> 00:27:36,071
You were incredible.

473
00:27:37,155 --> 00:27:39,949
I would've been in big trouble
if it weren't for the pretty lady.

474
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:45,080
Thank you.

475
00:27:45,705 --> 00:27:47,665
How did you know about this?

476
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,251
Jun invited me.

477
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,253
Jun and I decided to become best friends.

478
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:54,422
Bang!

479
00:28:19,823 --> 00:28:22,283
THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME, DAD

480
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:37,715
It's hot.

481
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:39,634
Thank you.

482
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:46,057
You have such a lovely home.

483
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:50,395
Thank you

484
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,772
for standing in for me today
at Jun's performance.

485
00:28:53,815 --> 00:28:55,900
I think Jun had a lot of fun,
thanks to you.

486
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:59,112
Right? Jun and I were in perfect sync.

487
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:00,113
But…

488
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,033
please don't do this again.

489
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:05,994
Sorry?

490
00:29:06,578 --> 00:29:07,662
You and I

491
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,707
will have no reason
to see each other after this exhibition.

492
00:29:11,583 --> 00:29:13,126
But Jun is still a kid.

493
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:16,671
He won't understand
why he can't see you anymore,

494
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:19,215
and he could get hurt.

495
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,885
Then we can just continue
to see each other.

496
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:24,095
I already told you.

497
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,848
I like you and Jun.

498
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:32,812
I have no interest in you as a woman.

499
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,356
So,

500
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,609
please don't give false hope to Jun.

501
00:29:41,029 --> 00:29:42,071
Please.

502
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:58,505
My apologies.

503
00:29:59,088 --> 00:29:59,923
Seriously?

504
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:02,884
Wait.

505
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,928
Sorry, Tae-yeong.

506
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,346
I have an urgent meeting.

507
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,891
You haven't changed a bit.
Your apologies are never sincere.

508
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:15,146
You were always like that
when you snatched up the companies

509
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:16,272
I was in talks with first.

510
00:30:16,856 --> 00:30:18,316
You knew how much I had invested

511
00:30:18,399 --> 00:30:20,568
in those deals valued at billions,
trillions even.

512
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,028
But you just acted and apologized

513
00:30:23,196 --> 00:30:25,281
like you bumped into me on the streets
or something.

514
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:27,992
"Sorry, Tae-yeong."

515
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,872
I'm glad that came across well.

516
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,541
You're right.

517
00:30:34,624 --> 00:30:35,917
I wasn't really sorry.

518
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:37,752
Even if it weren't for me,

519
00:30:39,087 --> 00:30:40,713
you could never have closed those deals.

520
00:30:41,714 --> 00:30:42,757
Yeah?

521
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:45,593
People can instinctively tell

522
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,720
the difference between someone
who will help them grow

523
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,181
or devour them.

524
00:30:50,265 --> 00:30:51,182
And you see,

525
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:53,309
you make it too obvious.

526
00:30:53,393 --> 00:30:55,103
You have the look of a beast

527
00:30:56,354 --> 00:30:57,689
standing over its prey.

528
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,359
Yeah, that's it.

529
00:31:06,739 --> 00:31:07,574
Watch it.

530
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,659
Just one more thing before I do.

531
00:31:09,742 --> 00:31:10,869
When it comes to elevators,

532
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,453
it's exit first

533
00:31:13,329 --> 00:31:14,622
and enter after.

534
00:31:15,456 --> 00:31:16,791
That's basic etiquette.

535
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:20,670
You should at least have basic manners.

536
00:31:21,921 --> 00:31:22,755
Okay.

537
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:24,591
See you.

538
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,059
Hi.

539
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,479
What are you doing here again?

540
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:39,939
Back to interrogate me?

541
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:43,234
Why so cold? We're on the same team now.

542
00:31:43,318 --> 00:31:44,903
What? Same team?

543
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:48,072
What's with the face?

544
00:31:48,823 --> 00:31:49,657
It's nothing.

545
00:31:51,159 --> 00:31:51,993
How's it going?

546
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,287
Well, I did as you said

547
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,123
and let Ji-hyeok handle
the new product development.

548
00:31:58,082 --> 00:32:00,668
But what if it's successful?

549
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:02,754
Wouldn't that be bad for us?

550
00:32:02,837 --> 00:32:06,090
Wait, was that Mr. Yu's idea?

551
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:09,886
We need to make sure that doesn't happen.

552
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,388
I thought you said we're on the same team.
Why did you tell her to do such a thing?

553
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,015
Stay out of his way and support him.

554
00:32:14,098 --> 00:32:15,183
-Pardon?
-What?

555
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:16,100
This is our chance.

556
00:32:16,184 --> 00:32:18,561
Our chance to use
that Go Da-rim card properly.

557
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,146
And don't worry.

558
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,981
Even if they produce something amazing,

559
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:25,318
it'll never see the light of day.

560
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,036
Instead of overthinking it
and obsessing over newness,

561
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:38,665
I thought we could find an older product
and give it an update.

562
00:32:38,748 --> 00:32:39,999
We could each take one--

563
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,168
Who cares about our opinions?

564
00:32:42,251 --> 00:32:44,128
We'll follow your lead on everything.

565
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:45,713
What?

566
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:47,548
You're the fountain of ideas on our team.

567
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:49,300
-That's right.
-You are.

568
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,385
Absolutely.

569
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:53,680
What are you talking about?
We always did everything together.

570
00:32:54,430 --> 00:32:57,892
-First, we should divide the categories--
-You should tell her.

571
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:00,186
-But you're the oldest.
-Be quiet.

572
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,689
-You saw it.
-You saw it, so you speak up.

573
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:06,234
-No, you tell her.
-I don't even know if that's true.

574
00:33:07,735 --> 00:33:08,569
Listen.

575
00:33:10,029 --> 00:33:11,531
There's something…

576
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:15,994
I want to tell you.

577
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:22,333
I had a second to reflect
after my mom got discharged.

578
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,045
That's when I finally realized

579
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:30,091
that I did something unforgivable.

580
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:35,096
I'm deceiving those who trust me.

581
00:33:36,806 --> 00:33:37,765
I'm sorry.

582
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,517
I'm really sorry.

583
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,062
Stop that. It's fine. It's totally fine.

584
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:44,939
Sit down.

585
00:33:45,773 --> 00:33:49,235
You should've told us sooner
if you were going through all that.

586
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,612
It's not like we wouldn't have understood.

587
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,073
I misunderstood you for no reason.

588
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:57,785
See? I told you
Da-rim wouldn't do something like that.

589
00:33:58,369 --> 00:34:00,997
When the world has you standing
at the edge of a cliff,

590
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,500
you have to do whatever you can
to survive.

591
00:34:04,584 --> 00:34:06,085
How could we not understand that?

592
00:34:06,169 --> 00:34:07,336
That's right.

593
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,421
If it weren't for you,

594
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,507
we would've been cast aside like leftovers
before getting kicked out.

595
00:34:12,508 --> 00:34:14,427
So don't cry.

596
00:34:15,511 --> 00:34:16,846
You're all crying.

597
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:20,016
I'm only crying because you are.

598
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,021
But still, it doesn't change
the fact that I lied to get this job.

599
00:34:25,688 --> 00:34:28,608
I'm going to leave after this project.

600
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,611
I already handed in my resignation.

601
00:34:33,613 --> 00:34:35,114
Oh no.

602
00:34:36,282 --> 00:34:37,158
I want to see

603
00:34:37,742 --> 00:34:39,202
my Jin-hui,

604
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,662
Nan-suk,

605
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:44,332
and Go-eun

606
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:48,294
become full-time employees.

607
00:34:49,921 --> 00:34:53,466
I'll consider this my last chance
to repay your kindness

608
00:34:53,549 --> 00:34:56,969
and do my absolute best.

609
00:34:57,053 --> 00:34:58,096
So…

610
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:02,683
let's do our best
until the very end, okay?

611
00:35:03,351 --> 00:35:06,104
-Da-rim.
-I can't believe you.

612
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:10,066
I'm sorry.

613
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,742
Mr. Gong, we need to talk.

614
00:35:19,826 --> 00:35:21,786
-About what?
-You'll see when we get there.

615
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,247
-Where are we going? Hold on.
-A restaurant.

616
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:27,416
I made a reservation at the most
expensive place near the office.

617
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,417
Let's go.

618
00:35:28,501 --> 00:35:29,460
-Great.
-Let's go.

619
00:35:29,544 --> 00:35:30,378
Let go of me.

620
00:35:30,461 --> 00:35:33,381
Wait. Let me go. Let go!

621
00:35:34,382 --> 00:35:35,675
Please let me go.

622
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:37,844
I said let go!

623
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,356
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

624
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,987
I was so shocked

625
00:35:56,070 --> 00:35:58,239
when I saw you two hugging each other.

626
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:02,410
I was really torn
about what to do about you two.

627
00:36:05,705 --> 00:36:07,456
Mr. Kang, you're drinking more than usual.

628
00:36:07,540 --> 00:36:09,417
How could I not?

629
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:10,751
Ji-hyeok betrayed me.

630
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,087
Hey, I didn't betray you.

631
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:14,547
I'm so disappointed in you.

632
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,716
You should've at least told me.

633
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,511
So you're saying
you had that banging dynamite kiss

634
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,014
with Ms. Go, right?

635
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,350
-"A banging dynamite kiss"?
-"A banging dynamite kiss"?

636
00:36:30,396 --> 00:36:31,522
Mr. Kang.

637
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:32,815
Are you drunk?

638
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,400
Hold on a second.

639
00:36:34,483 --> 00:36:37,403
Didn't you tell us you two met
for the first time in Jeju?

640
00:36:37,486 --> 00:36:40,072
And you shared an explosive,
dynamite kiss from the start?

641
00:36:40,865 --> 00:36:42,283
Can you elaborate?

642
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,868
What exactly is a dynamite kiss?

643
00:36:43,951 --> 00:36:45,453
How is it different from a regular kiss?

644
00:36:46,078 --> 00:36:47,413
No, that's not…

645
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:49,207
-Well…
-Yes?

646
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,006
You explain it. I can't.

647
00:36:58,424 --> 00:36:59,884
-So you see…
-Oh my goodness.

648
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,677
-It's like…
-Yeah?

649
00:37:06,057 --> 00:37:07,600
I don't know what to say.

650
00:37:08,476 --> 00:37:10,186
She can't say. She doesn't know.

651
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:12,605
Seriously? You two are so annoying.

652
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:14,398
I don't care
if it's an office affair or romance.

653
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,025
Let's just get rid of both of them.

654
00:37:16,108 --> 00:37:17,485
I feel so empty inside, Nan-suk.

655
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,195
Eat as much as you want tonight.

656
00:37:19,278 --> 00:37:20,321
It's on me.

657
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,198
Can we get more meat here?

658
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:23,741
A large, please!

659
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:26,661
Let's go hard tonight!

660
00:37:26,744 --> 00:37:27,828
Congratulations.

661
00:37:28,412 --> 00:37:30,122
Here's to your relationship.

662
00:37:30,206 --> 00:37:31,624
-How nice.
-Is it good?

663
00:37:33,918 --> 00:37:34,752
That must've been

664
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,129
really tough for you to do.

665
00:37:39,590 --> 00:37:42,468
It was really brave of you to tell them.

666
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,220
I mean it.

667
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,264
I was really worried,

668
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,016
but they were all so understanding.

669
00:37:50,810 --> 00:37:52,228
I feel bad about it…

670
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,817
and thankful at the same time.

671
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,915
Stop crying.

672
00:38:14,208 --> 00:38:15,293
Okay?

673
00:38:26,137 --> 00:38:27,388
It's okay.

674
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:29,140
I'm proud of you.

675
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,372
It's hot.

676
00:39:34,455 --> 00:39:36,082
Be careful.

677
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,333
Thank you.

678
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:06,904
I should apologize to you as well.

679
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,824
Why?

680
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,993
For everything from when we met

681
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:15,579
until now.

682
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:18,833
You went through a lot emotionally

683
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,918
and suffered because of me.

684
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,213
That's true.

685
00:40:25,256 --> 00:40:26,132
You're right about that.

686
00:40:27,508 --> 00:40:29,051
It makes me very angry.

687
00:40:29,844 --> 00:40:31,220
It does,

688
00:40:32,346 --> 00:40:33,305
but all of it

689
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:36,892
is forgivable by the fact that…

690
00:40:40,521 --> 00:40:41,564
you're single.

691
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:51,782
I think you're a really lucky person.

692
00:40:57,538 --> 00:40:58,372
Thank you.

693
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,134
What's wrong with me?

694
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,147
Stop running away now.

695
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:26,609
I won't ever let you go.

696
00:43:42,703 --> 00:43:44,121
So handsome.

697
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,252
I know.

698
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:52,880
What?

699
00:43:53,839 --> 00:43:55,841
Why are you pretending to be asleep?

700
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,637
Because I'm happy.

701
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,610
Are we not going to get up?

702
00:44:15,527 --> 00:44:16,862
We need to eat breakfast.

703
00:44:18,155 --> 00:44:19,406
No thanks.

704
00:44:19,907 --> 00:44:22,284
We need to wash our faces
and brush our teeth.

705
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:24,078
I don't want to.

706
00:44:27,873 --> 00:44:30,376
Okay then. Let's just not do it.

707
00:44:35,172 --> 00:44:37,132
You want to spend the whole day in bed?

708
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,384
Yeah.

709
00:44:39,968 --> 00:44:40,928
And do what?

710
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:44,932
You know, just this and that.

711
00:44:45,015 --> 00:44:46,266
This and that?

712
00:44:47,059 --> 00:44:48,185
Yeah.

713
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:51,397
This and that…

714
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:53,816
Yeah.

715
00:44:53,899 --> 00:44:54,817
Okay.

716
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,612
Hold on. Wait.

717
00:45:02,866 --> 00:45:05,828
I guess Da-rim is sleeping in
because it's the weekend.

718
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,079
No.

719
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:08,163
She didn't come home last night.

720
00:45:08,789 --> 00:45:11,041
She was drinking with a friend.

721
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:13,919
Maybe…

722
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:16,880
she has a boyfriend.

723
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,174
I wish.

724
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,677
She needs to start dating,

725
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:23,137
but she's not interested

726
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,264
because she's so ambitious
about her career.

727
00:45:25,889 --> 00:45:29,518
Ji-hyeok is also so dedicated to his work.

728
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,688
It's always work and home for him.

729
00:45:33,313 --> 00:45:35,274
I don't think
he's ever held a woman's hand before.

730
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,193
It's concerning, to say the least.

731
00:45:38,277 --> 00:45:40,654
They say kids nowadays just don't date.

732
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:44,533
We should all be concerned.

733
00:45:44,616 --> 00:45:46,034
By the way,

734
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:50,747
what kind of man does Da-rim like?

735
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,711
I wonder what she'd think of
someone like Ji-hyeok.

736
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,463
No, that can't happen.

737
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,298
Why not?

738
00:45:59,381 --> 00:46:00,716
He's too handsome.

739
00:46:01,675 --> 00:46:03,552
He's not handsome at all.

740
00:46:03,635 --> 00:46:05,554
He's so average-looking.

741
00:46:05,637 --> 00:46:07,681
Just walk through any street
and look around.

742
00:46:07,764 --> 00:46:10,225
All guys look like him.

743
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:13,520
-Can you tell me where that street is?
-What?

744
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:14,563
I want to go and see.

745
00:46:15,856 --> 00:46:18,192
Anyhow, it won't work.
They come from different worlds.

746
00:46:18,275 --> 00:46:20,319
It's best to marry someone
with a similar background.

747
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,696
Eat up. The soup's getting cold.

748
00:46:23,405 --> 00:46:24,865
This is delicious.

749
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,242
Sure.

750
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:36,335
She sure can drink like a fish.

751
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:38,587
I guess she gets that from me too.

752
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:41,507
Wake up. We're shopping
for your newlywed home today.

753
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:43,675
I don't care. I'm not going anywhere.

754
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:44,676
You go.

755
00:46:44,760 --> 00:46:46,720
Why would I go alone?

756
00:46:49,264 --> 00:46:53,393
-The sea sings
-The sea sings

757
00:46:53,894 --> 00:46:54,811
What's this?

758
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:58,023
So tell me.

759
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:01,109
Why were you at Mr. Kim's kid's

760
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:02,778
talent show?

761
00:47:03,445 --> 00:47:05,697
Why did you go and sing?

762
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,283
Why else? I like him. That's why.

763
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,701
I told you I liked someone.

764
00:47:12,579 --> 00:47:14,331
You crazy brat!

765
00:47:14,414 --> 00:47:16,291
How could you be so immature?

766
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,627
Why him, out of all people?

767
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:21,838
-Have you lost your mind?
-What's wrong with him?

768
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,633
Pull yourself together!

769
00:47:25,133 --> 00:47:28,011
Do you think marrying someone like Dad
is being mature?

770
00:47:28,762 --> 00:47:29,930
Then I'm just going to be immature.

771
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:31,640
I refuse to live like you!

772
00:47:44,444 --> 00:47:47,155
JUN BABY STUDIO

773
00:47:47,239 --> 00:47:50,284
He's just some nameless photographer
and a single dad.

774
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,411
How dare he covet my daughter?

775
00:47:54,371 --> 00:47:56,373
I let him hold an exhibition
in my art hall,

776
00:47:56,456 --> 00:47:57,666
and this is how he repays me?

777
00:47:57,749 --> 00:47:58,667
That ungrateful…

778
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,338
Damn it.

779
00:48:04,756 --> 00:48:06,133
I'll get straight to the point.

780
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,342
Ha-yeong…

781
00:48:09,970 --> 00:48:11,054
Are you okay?

782
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,684
That damn brat.

783
00:48:17,603 --> 00:48:19,187
-Mr. Kim Seon-u.
-Just a second.

784
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:28,780
Can I see your wrist for a moment?

785
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:30,240
Excuse me.

786
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:35,078
Let's see.

787
00:48:37,331 --> 00:48:38,332
It's a little cold.

788
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,419
Oh, you don't have to.

789
00:48:43,003 --> 00:48:45,714
I also hurt my wrists a lot
because I spend all day

790
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:47,049
playing with children.

791
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:49,259
These pain relief patches are the best.

792
00:48:50,385 --> 00:48:51,595
I'll put on one more.

793
00:48:57,976 --> 00:49:00,354
It doesn't hurt, does it?

794
00:49:18,288 --> 00:49:19,498
It should heal in no time.

795
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:33,762
Didn't you have something to say?

796
00:49:35,722 --> 00:49:36,682
And this?

797
00:49:36,765 --> 00:49:39,351
I didn't know what to get you.

798
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,521
I couldn't show up empty-handed, could I?

799
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,690
Thank you for this.

800
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:49,528
Grapefruits.

801
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,740
-Good.
-Okay, we'll get this.

802
00:49:57,911 --> 00:49:59,830
What's your favorite pasta?

803
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:00,872
I'll make whatever you want.

804
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:04,251
You know how to cook pasta, Mr. Gong?

805
00:50:04,334 --> 00:50:06,294
Of course, I do.

806
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:09,923
Wait.

807
00:50:10,006 --> 00:50:12,134
We're on a date.
Can you stop calling me Mr. Gong?

808
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:15,095
Sorry, Mr. Gong.

809
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:18,682
Then what should I call you?

810
00:50:19,516 --> 00:50:21,268
Ji-hyeok.

811
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:24,730
That's fine too, but…

812
00:50:26,231 --> 00:50:27,065
Ba…

813
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:30,110
Baby? Like "baby boy"?

814
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:31,611
No, not that.

815
00:50:32,237 --> 00:50:33,071
Babe.

816
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,615
Whatever, just forget it.

817
00:50:36,408 --> 00:50:37,743
Babe, let's go!

818
00:50:50,922 --> 00:50:52,174
Let's go, babe!

819
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,843
Come on, babe!

820
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:50,690
Ta-da!

821
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,317
This looks amazing!

822
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,235
Me?

823
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,274
Two.

824
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:42,826
Hold on.

825
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:44,160
You have something here.

826
00:52:45,745 --> 00:52:46,746
No, not there.

827
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,296
Do you think marrying someone like Dad
is being mature?

828
00:53:36,379 --> 00:53:37,339
Then I'm just going to be immature.

829
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:38,798
I refuse to live like you!

830
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,136
Water.

831
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:44,679
What?

832
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:47,390
What are you doing? Pour me some water.

833
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:56,566
Are you serious?

834
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:58,902
You can't even pour a cup of water?

835
00:53:58,985 --> 00:54:00,612
I hurt my wrist.

836
00:54:00,695 --> 00:54:01,571
You have another one!

837
00:54:02,781 --> 00:54:03,657
That's true.

838
00:54:04,366 --> 00:54:05,450
I forgot I had two arms.

839
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,121
Goddamn it.

840
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:14,960
This is the shortlist of products
we're looking to update.

841
00:54:15,043 --> 00:54:17,462
Is the development team
working on any of them already?

842
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,839
We have nothing planned for them.

843
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,592
But the fact that we don't

844
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,428
means that those products already have
high customer satisfaction ratings.

845
00:54:26,137 --> 00:54:30,517
An unnecessary update
could end up backfiring.

846
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,477
That's right. I know it's a challenge,

847
00:54:32,560 --> 00:54:34,145
but I suggest you try
to come up with something

848
00:54:34,229 --> 00:54:36,022
that's not already in our product line.

849
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:39,818
Then you'd also be pioneering
a new market for us.

850
00:54:41,027 --> 00:54:42,654
That's true.

851
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:43,863
If I could offer a tip,

852
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,907
I'd say start recording everything
on your phone.

853
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,117
Record everything?

854
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,536
You don't know when an idea will strike.

855
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:52,497
Recording it the second you think of it
will be helpful.

856
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,374
Trial and error will be inevitable,

857
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,792
so if you record every step,

858
00:54:55,875 --> 00:54:57,877
you'll be able to review
where it went wrong.

859
00:54:57,961 --> 00:55:00,130
Oh, that makes sense.

860
00:55:00,213 --> 00:55:01,381
Thank you.

861
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:02,632
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

862
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:13,852
It looks uncomfortable.

863
00:55:13,935 --> 00:55:14,769
So I think…

864
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,648
So I think it needs to be updated.

865
00:55:21,443 --> 00:55:22,652
That's a must.

866
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:42,380
The size…

867
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:45,592
-I think diaper bags might be good.
-Diaper bags…

868
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:46,634
Look at this fabric.

869
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,594
Diapers?

870
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:48,720
That would be…

871
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,513
-Take a look at this one.
-This one too.

872
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,931
This one too.

873
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:53,391
This one's…

874
00:56:30,804 --> 00:56:32,847
I'm not sure how it should be tied.

875
00:56:32,931 --> 00:56:33,765
The way you tie it?

876
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,700
Let me do it.

877
00:56:52,784 --> 00:56:54,369
This one? Or this one?

878
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:56,746
I think that one.

879
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:04,504
KNOT IS COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT TO USE
UNCOMFORTABLE FOR BABY

880
00:57:04,587 --> 00:57:06,089
NO POCKETS OR NOT ENOUGH FOR WIPES
HIP SEAT ADDS WEIGHT AND CAUSES STRAIN

881
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:07,423
THE WAY IT'S TIED
DETERMINES DIFFICULTY OF USE

882
00:57:22,188 --> 00:57:24,107
Look. Next.

883
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,151
-Ta-da!
-That color is so nice.

884
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:27,360
-Yeah.
-It is.

885
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:28,736
This is nice.

886
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:30,196
-It's so pretty.
-It's good for a tone-on-tone look.

887
00:57:30,280 --> 00:57:33,032
But I still think
the fabric is most important.

888
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:44,002
This isn't right.

889
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,503
How can I…

890
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,048
What's that?

891
00:57:55,221 --> 00:57:56,181
Mr. Gong!

892
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:58,099
Seriously.

893
00:57:58,683 --> 00:57:59,809
WITH BABY

894
00:58:01,311 --> 00:58:03,229
-Ta-da!
-Ta-da!

895
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,522
Okay!

896
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:09,360
-This is excellent!
-We did it!

897
00:58:09,444 --> 00:58:11,029
-We did it!
-Baby carrier.

898
00:58:11,613 --> 00:58:14,491
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

899
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,493
-We did it.
-Baby carrier.

900
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,702
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

901
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:20,538
-Baby carrier.
-Baby carrier.

902
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,956
Baby carrier.

903
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,335
To account for sweating in the summer,

904
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,504
we can use some sort of mesh fabric.

905
00:58:28,379 --> 00:58:30,673
How about making it with mesh fabric

906
00:58:30,757 --> 00:58:32,050
and detachable?

907
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:34,260
Two options for summer and winter.

908
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:36,304
You haven't texted me all day.

909
00:58:37,263 --> 00:58:38,932
Here you are
just recording yourself again.

910
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,143
Are you going home, Mr. Gong?

911
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:45,480
No one's around.

912
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:56,574
Are you leaving already, babe?

913
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,827
I'll miss you so much through the night.

914
00:59:04,707 --> 00:59:06,417
We can go home together.

915
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,294
To my place.

916
00:59:12,757 --> 00:59:13,591
I can wait for you.

917
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,553
I really want to go with you,

918
00:59:16,636 --> 00:59:18,263
but I still have a lot of work to do.

919
00:59:18,972 --> 00:59:20,557
The prototype is coming out soon,

920
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,850
and we need to make final edits if needed.

921
00:59:22,934 --> 00:59:24,352
You should go home.

922
00:59:24,435 --> 00:59:25,520
I can't concentrate.

923
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:27,772
Hold on.

924
00:59:27,855 --> 00:59:29,857
I left files in the meeting room.

925
00:59:30,567 --> 00:59:31,693
Go first, okay?

926
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:32,902
See you tomorrow!

927
00:59:52,380 --> 00:59:53,381
I'm going home first.

928
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:57,594
I'm really leaving.

929
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:03,850
I don't know why hearing you
tell me to go home makes me so sad.

930
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,353
Can't you stop me and make me stay?

931
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,107
I just want to

932
01:00:12,108 --> 01:00:13,610
chat and laugh with you every day.

933
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,949
It's finally here.

934
01:00:21,701 --> 01:00:22,869
-Hurry up and open it!
-I can't look at it.

935
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,912
-I'll open it for you.
-I can't.

936
01:00:25,747 --> 01:00:27,123
-Oh my gosh, it's so pretty.
-It's so pretty.

937
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,667
-My goodness. I can't believe this.
-It looks so luxurious.

938
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:30,835
Oh my.

939
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:32,837
It's finally here.

940
01:00:33,546 --> 01:00:36,090
Natural BeBe's first baby carrier.

941
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:40,011
That's right,
it's the baby carrier we created.

942
01:00:40,094 --> 01:00:43,056
This is exactly how I felt
when I gave birth to my first son.

943
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:43,973
My goodness.

944
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:46,809
You know the feeling, right?

945
01:00:46,893 --> 01:00:49,687
This will be out on the market
next week, right?

946
01:00:49,771 --> 01:00:50,813
I'm not dreaming, am I?

947
01:00:53,066 --> 01:00:54,233
Now, now.

948
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,235
You all worked really hard.

949
01:00:56,319 --> 01:00:58,404
I'm sure we'll see positive results.

950
01:00:59,405 --> 01:01:00,365
Mr. Gong!

951
01:01:01,282 --> 01:01:03,409
Mr. Gong! You all need to look at this.

952
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,703
This came out so nicely.

953
01:01:05,787 --> 01:01:06,663
Look at it.

954
01:01:10,458 --> 01:01:12,669
This is the same as our prototype.

955
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,129
We never placed an order for this color.

956
01:01:15,213 --> 01:01:18,758
This is a new product
that MomsJoy released this morning.

957
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,343
What?

958
01:01:20,426 --> 01:01:24,138
That can't be. Why would our product
be released by another company?

959
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:26,015
Yeah, there must be some sort of mistake.

960
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,559
-Mr. Kang, you must be mistaken.
-No.

961
01:01:28,643 --> 01:01:30,603
-Wait, hold on.
-What?

962
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:33,523
"MomsJoy is releasing a new baby carrier."

963
01:01:33,606 --> 01:01:35,024
"It utilizes a body-hugging design

964
01:01:35,108 --> 01:01:37,110
that notably reduces shoulder
and lower-back strain."

965
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:39,987
"It's made with cutting-edge materials
to make it lighter than a towel…"

966
01:01:40,947 --> 01:01:43,491
It's the exact same materials
and features.

967
01:01:43,574 --> 01:01:45,660
-That can't be.
-Are you being serious?

968
01:01:45,743 --> 01:01:47,745
-Let me see.
-Are you serious?

969
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,039
They're so similar.

970
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,169
Who's Go Da-rim?

971
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,591
Chairman Gong.

972
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,761
I'm Go Da-rim.

973
01:02:05,930 --> 01:02:07,265
You're Go Da-rim?

974
01:02:09,809 --> 01:02:10,727
Oh my!

975
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:50,183
DYNAMITE KISS

976
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,465
So you knew she lied to get hired
and let it slide?

977
01:03:22,548 --> 01:03:23,549
Yes.

978
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:26,427
But framing her for being a spy
when she didn't do anything?

979
01:03:26,511 --> 01:03:27,428
That's enough.

980
01:03:27,512 --> 01:03:30,556
He knew I lied and still covered for me,

981
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,266
and now he's in a tight spot.

982
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,309
You're just going to give up

983
01:03:33,392 --> 01:03:35,853
on being promoted to vice president
and our joint venture with Taeyu C&T?

984
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,814
All because of a woman like her?

985
01:03:37,897 --> 01:03:39,482
Think wisely!

986
01:03:39,982 --> 01:03:43,778
I was the one who leaked the new product
to a competitor.

987
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:45,738
Why do you insist on suffering alone?

988
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:49,116
-Just trust me and--
-I'm suffering because of you.

989
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,869
Let's break up.

990
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:53,788
Let's each go back to where we belong.

991
01:03:53,871 --> 01:03:56,290
This is me at rock bottom.

992
01:03:56,791 --> 01:04:01,754
