1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:53,511 --> 00:00:55,805
Then why don't you prove to me
that this is indeed

3
00:00:57,307 --> 00:00:58,391
your lifeline?

4
00:02:21,307 --> 00:02:24,352
Is this stupid piece of paper
that important?

5
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:26,855
You almost died just now.

6
00:02:27,897 --> 00:02:28,773
You know that?

7
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,693
I'm trying to live.

8
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:35,321
I want to live.

9
00:02:36,281 --> 00:02:37,407
I already told you.

10
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:39,868
These are not just pieces of paper.

11
00:02:40,535 --> 00:02:42,871
These are our livelihoods and lifelines.

12
00:02:44,205 --> 00:02:46,958
So don't just toss them
like they're nothing,

13
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:49,502
and please read them over.

14
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,092
Please.

15
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,308
EPISODE 4

16
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:13,526
Checkmate.

17
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,527
What?

18
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,531
I surrender.

19
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,702
You really need to practice, Dad.
It's not fun winning all the time.

20
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:24,454
I win a lot of things too, you know.

21
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,663
For example?

22
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,499
In tickling wars!

23
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,460
-Tickle, tickle!
-Stop!

24
00:03:32,128 --> 00:03:33,212
You silly boy.

25
00:03:35,965 --> 00:03:37,967
Jun, what do you want for dinner?

26
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,552
Dumplings!

27
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:40,553
Dumplings.

28
00:03:40,637 --> 00:03:42,180
Okay. Order received.

29
00:04:03,451 --> 00:04:04,285
Get in.

30
00:04:04,994 --> 00:04:07,121
No, I'm fine.
The bus stop is right over there.

31
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,797
You can't ride a bus in that state.

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,048
Hurry up and get in.

33
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:18,925
I'm really okay.

34
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:35,650
I'm fine.

35
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:38,027
Your coat will get wet.

36
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:41,447
I don't want you to get sick or whatever
and ask me to pay for your hospital bills.

37
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,877
We'll arrive at your place in 15 minutes.

38
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,380
Use it to present your report.

39
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,135
Wait, you want me to present
26 pages in 15 minutes?

40
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,553
Time is ticking.

41
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,557
Right, okay. Where should I start?

42
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:12,645
First, we focused
on monitoring the changes

43
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:14,188
in the bottle materials and grip,

44
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,525
the texture and shape of the nipple,
and the air vent function.

45
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,862
Based on our research, we've concluded
that there are several metrics

46
00:05:20,945 --> 00:05:25,241
in which our product excels
compared to other products in the market.

47
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,409
Those include…

48
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,779
The content isn't bad.

49
00:06:03,362 --> 00:06:04,697
But you said
the report is 26 pages, right?

50
00:06:04,781 --> 00:06:05,656
Yes.

51
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:07,950
Let's cut it down to five.

52
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:09,619
Why? That'd be a waste.

53
00:06:09,702 --> 00:06:11,996
A long report doesn't prove
you're good at your job.

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,665
A good report seduces you.
It makes you want to learn more about it,

55
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,667
see the product, and touch it.

56
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,253
Even documents need to be sexy.

57
00:06:19,337 --> 00:06:21,631
Even documents need to be sexy…

58
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,800
How do you do that?

59
00:06:27,220 --> 00:06:28,054
Hold on.

60
00:06:35,103 --> 00:06:36,270
It was here somewhere.

61
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:38,147
Here it is.

62
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,153
This is an old report I worked on.

63
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,738
Use it as a reference.

64
00:06:46,405 --> 00:06:47,281
I see.

65
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:57,708
Create a table for the comparison analysis
with the other companies' products

66
00:06:57,792 --> 00:06:58,709
you mentioned earlier.

67
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:00,294
Hang on. Okay.

68
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:01,671
Create a table.

69
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,672
For the reviews,

70
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:05,049
quantify them and create a graph
showing the satisfaction level

71
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:06,425
for each category.

72
00:07:06,926 --> 00:07:09,011
You want to be able to visualize the data
as much as possible

73
00:07:09,095 --> 00:07:11,472
so it can be easily understood
at a glance.

74
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:13,724
"Easily," "visualize."

75
00:07:15,852 --> 00:07:18,229
You really are a pro.

76
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:19,605
That's nothing.

77
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:24,485
I'll make the revisions
as soon as possible for your review.

78
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:28,156
Thank you so much
for driving me home today.

79
00:07:29,198 --> 00:07:30,324
I really hope

80
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,995
to see you at the office tomorrow.

81
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:53,306
Hey, young lady.

82
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,935
Are you Go Da-jeong's older sister?

83
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:04,650
That would make you

84
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,280
Go Da-rim, right?

85
00:08:31,385 --> 00:08:33,471
YOU CAN DO IT
KEEP GOING!

86
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:38,059
You really are a handful.

87
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,685
This has got to be a joke.

88
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,773
My goodness.

89
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,858
That Ms. Go Da-rim you're looking for

90
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,818
lives with the owner downstairs.

91
00:08:47,902 --> 00:08:51,531
I'm just the tenant who lives above her.

92
00:08:51,614 --> 00:08:52,615
You're not her?

93
00:08:52,698 --> 00:08:53,866
No, I'm not.

94
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,160
It's not her. What's going on?

95
00:08:56,661 --> 00:08:59,288
It's not her!
She says it's not her! You little…

96
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:05,670
-Then let me ask you something.
-Sure, go ahead.

97
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:09,173
Has the landlord's family
been coming home recently?

98
00:09:14,929 --> 00:09:16,264
Oh, I almost forgot.

99
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:18,849
Ms. Go Da-rim said

100
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:22,812
she was going on a trip
far away to someplace overseas.

101
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:24,730
-Overseas?
-Yeah.

102
00:09:24,814 --> 00:09:25,940
She really set her mind to it.

103
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:28,442
She fled overseas, you punk!

104
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:29,944
-Hey, what have you been doing?
-Wait…

105
00:09:30,027 --> 00:09:32,655
-I'll get going now.
-Boss! Wait…

106
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:35,032
-Apologies for disturbing you.
-No problem.

107
00:09:35,116 --> 00:09:36,534
Goodbye, ma'am.

108
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,452
She fled overseas.
What have you two been doing?

109
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,829
How are we going to catch her now?

110
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,038
Ms. Go Da-rim!

111
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:43,666
Ms. Go Da-rim!

112
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,127
-You left your phone.
-Go Da-rim…

113
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:47,837
-Ms. Go Da-rim.
-He said, "Go Da-rim."

114
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,171
Who forgets their phone?

115
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:52,008
-Go…
-You're such a handful.

116
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,135
-She's Go Da-rim.
-Go Da-rim?

117
00:09:54,927 --> 00:09:56,596
-Her.
-You…

118
00:09:57,722 --> 00:09:58,556
Go Da-rim, you…

119
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,142
You! Hey!

120
00:10:01,726 --> 00:10:02,810
-What? What's up?
-Run!

121
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:04,061
-What's wrong?
-Run! Go!

122
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:05,187
Go Da-rim!

123
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:07,273
-Go Da-rim, you…
-Run!

124
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,239
Hey, Go Da-rim!

125
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:17,658
How dare you lie to me!

126
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,118
You're dead meat!

127
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,293
This way!

128
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:28,419
-Isn't that Da-rim?
-Go Da-rim!

129
00:10:29,253 --> 00:10:30,171
Get her!

130
00:10:30,254 --> 00:10:32,089
-Get her!
-Stop right there, Go Da-rim!

131
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:33,591
-What the hell?
-Go Da-rim!

132
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,723
Hey, Go Da-rim! You…

133
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,391
Just wait until I catch you!

134
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:44,393
Hey, Go Da-rim! You little…

135
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,145
Move!

136
00:10:49,565 --> 00:10:51,317
Go catch her! Go!

137
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,694
Come here, Go Da-rim!

138
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,621
Hold on, Da-rim. Oh jeez.

139
00:11:05,498 --> 00:11:06,332
Da-rim…

140
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,417
Why are we running?

141
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:11,796
Just run for now.

142
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:12,755
What's going on?

143
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,508
Da-rim.

144
00:11:19,178 --> 00:11:20,721
Hey, Go Da-rim!

145
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,103
Hey! Go Da-rim!

146
00:11:29,688 --> 00:11:31,065
Where the hell did she go?

147
00:11:31,148 --> 00:11:33,067
Hey, you go over there.

148
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,735
-You go over there!
-Yes, sir.

149
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,695
Just wait until I catch you. Damn it.

150
00:11:42,159 --> 00:11:43,285
I think we're going to get caught.

151
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,247
Da-rim! Where are you going?

152
00:12:31,625 --> 00:12:33,544
Damn it, Go Da-rim!

153
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:40,110
Come here.

154
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:46,909
Who the hell are you?

155
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,412
I'm her boss.

156
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:51,914
And who the hell are you?

157
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:52,957
Me?

158
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,167
I'm her husband.

159
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:10,975
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

160
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,186
-Let's go.
-Okay.

161
00:14:19,108 --> 00:14:20,276
How did you…

162
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,702
I'm sorry.

163
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:32,246
I misunderstood the situation.

164
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:35,457
It's all right.

165
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,001
I also made a mistake.

166
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:51,348
I was worried
because this is my wife's first job.

167
00:14:51,432 --> 00:14:53,642
I'm glad that she found herself
such a good boss.

168
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:59,940
I hope you continue
looking out for my Rim.

169
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:08,782
Yes, sure.

170
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,788
Mr. Gong, we'll get going now then.

171
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,957
Thank you so much for today.

172
00:15:20,294 --> 00:15:21,378
-Let's go.
-Okay.

173
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,182
-Were they loan sharks?
-Yeah.

174
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,808
We need to be careful.

175
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:36,685
What's wrong?

176
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,563
-Are you okay?
-It's still hurting where I sprained it.

177
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:40,481
Hold on.

178
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:42,524
Hop on.

179
00:15:43,025 --> 00:15:45,527
No, I'm fine.

180
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:46,445
Hurry up.

181
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:47,863
I'm fine though.

182
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,281
Hurry up.

183
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,534
-Come on.
-Okay.

184
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:15,349
LOAN AGREEMENT
NAME: GO DA-JEONG

185
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,476
Da-rim, drink this and warm yourself up.

186
00:16:18,143 --> 00:16:19,269
Be careful, it's hot.

187
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:20,312
Thanks.

188
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,026
Where am I going to find 30 million won?

189
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:28,404
It's illegal to demand repayment
from the family.

190
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,822
Let's report this to the police.

191
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:34,994
What if reporting it
leads to further retaliation?

192
00:16:35,077 --> 00:16:38,122
Maybe I should just ask them nicely
if I can pay them back

193
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,707
in small installments.

194
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:42,126
Da-rim, I guarantee
this won't end with 30 million.

195
00:16:43,335 --> 00:16:44,211
Look.

196
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,171
With such a high interest rate,

197
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,966
your debt will grow faster
than your payments.

198
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:50,426
Report it tomorrow morning,
no matter what.

199
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,346
Okay.

200
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,644
You haven't eaten yet, right?

201
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:03,063
Let's eat. I'll make you something.

202
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,273
I have a lot of work.

203
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,983
You still need to eat something.

204
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:09,028
I don't have much of an appetite today.

205
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:12,531
Hey, Jun must be waiting for you.
You should go upstairs.

206
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,741
Thanks for today.

207
00:17:16,618 --> 00:17:18,370
Okay. Get some rest.

208
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,288
Thanks.

209
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:23,959
Unbelievable.

210
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,586
"My Rim"?

211
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:27,087
"My Rim"?

212
00:17:27,171 --> 00:17:29,256
If they love each other so much,
why did they even fight?

213
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:32,384
He didn't even come after her
when she ran away to Jeju.

214
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,640
Are you talking about that woman again?

215
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,102
You scared me!

216
00:17:43,771 --> 00:17:46,231
-What are you doing here?
-I guess I just dozed off.

217
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:49,735
I came because you were ignoring my calls.

218
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,195
Did you receive the report?

219
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:52,738
Yeah.

220
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,281
Why did you send

221
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:57,451
Ms. Go to do your job?

222
00:17:57,534 --> 00:18:00,037
I was summoned
and interrogated by Director Gong

223
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:01,955
about why you weren't coming to work.

224
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,416
-So?
-I told her you were on sick leave.

225
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:07,753
I've run out of excuses,
so come to work starting tomorrow.

226
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:10,172
I'm too embarrassed
to face the team members.

227
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:12,216
They call you Mr. Freeloader

228
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:14,593
because it looks like
you get paid to slack off.

229
00:18:15,552 --> 00:18:17,930
Anyway, that woman you met in Jeju…

230
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:20,349
I mean, the mom. Did you see her again?

231
00:18:20,432 --> 00:18:22,559
Yeah. She was with her husband.

232
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:24,019
Man.

233
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:27,481
She was nowhere to be found
when you were desperately looking for her.

234
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,399
And now, it seems like
you run into her everywhere.

235
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,944
Does she live near here?
Or near the office?

236
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:33,487
Why would I even care?

237
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:35,572
Why are you so angry?

238
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,826
Wait, don't tell me you're jealous.

239
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:42,913
Did seeing her husband
tie your stomach in knots?

240
00:18:42,996 --> 00:18:45,290
What? Jealous?

241
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:46,792
-Yeah.
-Who?

242
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,461
-Me?
-Yes.

243
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,005
How does that make any sense?

244
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:56,927
Having feelings for someone
never makes any sense.

245
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,762
Even Shakespeare said,

246
00:18:58,846 --> 00:19:02,015
"Love is merely a madness."

247
00:19:03,767 --> 00:19:06,311
And it's a love
that can never come true, no less.

248
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,522
How maddening it must be.

249
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:10,566
Now,

250
00:19:10,649 --> 00:19:14,695
at times like these,
we must focus on work.

251
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,739
You'll forget all about it
when you show up to work tomorrow

252
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,325
and see the faces of your team members.

253
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:21,243
Okay?

254
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:23,871
I'm off.

255
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,836
Seeing her face will help me forget her?

256
00:19:32,296 --> 00:19:33,672
It's only making me crazier.

257
00:19:40,053 --> 00:19:42,973
Even documents need to be sexy.

258
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,727
It must make you want to see the product,
learn more about it,

259
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,021
and touch…

260
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:01,909
No, this isn't right.

261
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,244
There's no time to be distracted
by stuff like that.

262
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:06,121
Okay, even documents need to be sexy…

263
00:20:06,205 --> 00:20:07,080
No.

264
00:20:10,292 --> 00:20:11,835
Right, a graph.

265
00:20:24,473 --> 00:20:26,558
GYEONG-MIN

266
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:29,186
You're up, right?

267
00:20:29,269 --> 00:20:30,646
Get ready for work.

268
00:20:31,688 --> 00:20:32,898
My whole body is aching.

269
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:34,983
I think I overdid it yesterday.

270
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,486
Did you pull a muscle
relaxing in your hotel room all day?

271
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:40,864
If you don't show up today, I'm going to
bring the chairman and storm in there.

272
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,288
I'll make the revisions
as soon as possible for your review.

273
00:20:48,372 --> 00:20:49,581
I really hope

274
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:52,000
to see you at the office tomorrow.

275
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,469
NATURAL BEBE
NEW BABY BOTTLE PRODUCT MONITORING REPORT

276
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:03,428
PRODUCT INTRODUCTION

277
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,641
Do you find it sexy?

278
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:14,773
I didn't sleep a wink last night.

279
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:16,733
I wanted it to look sexy.

280
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:21,488
Listen, Jun's mom.

281
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:23,907
That's no way for a mom to act.

282
00:21:25,158 --> 00:21:26,535
Do I look that easy to you?

283
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:29,037
No, I just wanted to seduce you--

284
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,832
Right, so why do you want to seduce me?

285
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,625
No, that's not what I meant.

286
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:35,877
Not me. I wanted the report to seduce you.

287
00:21:37,754 --> 00:21:39,464
Remember what you told me last night?

288
00:21:39,548 --> 00:21:41,633
"A good report seduces you.
It makes you want to learn more about it,

289
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,218
see the product, and touch it."

290
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,220
"Even documents need to be sexy."

291
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:48,056
I stayed up all night editing it.

292
00:21:55,814 --> 00:21:58,734
You should be clearer in your delivery.

293
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,152
Are you trying to confuse me or what?

294
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,404
I'm sorry.

295
00:22:09,911 --> 00:22:10,996
It's good enough.

296
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:13,123
Thank goodness.

297
00:22:16,626 --> 00:22:19,254
You must've been quite shocked yesterday.

298
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:21,673
I would've been in big trouble
if it hadn't been for you.

299
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:23,008
Thank you so much.

300
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:26,011
I promise I'll work really hard.

301
00:22:26,636 --> 00:22:29,056
-Don't get the wrong idea.
-Pardon?

302
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:31,892
I only helped you yesterday
out of human decency.

303
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,395
How I feel about you hasn't changed.

304
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,815
Where's your resignation letter?

305
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,234
I thought that issue was settled.

306
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,611
Of course, it isn't.

307
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:45,489
Seeing your perfectly fine husband
just pissed me off even more.

308
00:22:46,490 --> 00:22:47,908
Hand in your resignation immediately.

309
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:49,701
Got it?

310
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,924
Where am I going to find 30 million won?

311
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:18,021
If, by any chance,
you change your mind, call me.

312
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,149
The one thing I can guarantee
is that we will treat you

313
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,652
with the utmost respect and courtesy
as an artist.

314
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:30,617
It's surprisingly thorough
and well-organized.

315
00:23:31,785 --> 00:23:34,287
It also covers some points
we hadn't considered.

316
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,288
In particular,

317
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:39,000
the bottle's marking color
and grip suggestions

318
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:40,252
can be implemented
and applied immediately.

319
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:44,840
I guess these are the kind of
innovative tips and ideas

320
00:23:44,923 --> 00:23:47,008
that only our Mother TF Team
can come up with.

321
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,261
Everyone loved it.

322
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:51,012
Well done.

323
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:55,183
Especially Ms. Go's boiling
sterilization test and report revisions.

324
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:56,476
Your all-nighters really paid off.

325
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,772
With Da-rim's touch, the report
became really polished overnight.

326
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:02,190
-I agree.
-It became super refined.

327
00:24:02,274 --> 00:24:04,234
I could never do that.

328
00:24:04,317 --> 00:24:06,987
Not at all. We all worked on it together.

329
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:09,781
Thank you for your hard work as well,
Mr. Kang.

330
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:11,575
Come on, I didn't do anything.

331
00:24:11,658 --> 00:24:12,576
You certainly did.

332
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:15,120
You got us all those baby bottles
from our competitors,

333
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:16,538
got us late-night snacks,

334
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,081
and even stayed up with us.

335
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:19,040
You're the best.

336
00:24:19,124 --> 00:24:22,586
I'd say you did much more
than someone who was never around

337
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,296
and only showed up to submit it.

338
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:26,423
Yeah, there are people like that.

339
00:24:26,506 --> 00:24:28,675
People who freeload and take credit
for their team members' hard work.

340
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:31,720
Is that why
his nickname is "Mr. Freeloader"?

341
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,806
I thought it was because
he was stingy or something.

342
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,518
Not at all.
We owe all this success to Mr. Gong.

343
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:40,645
He was the one who taught me the trick

344
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:43,940
to summarize our 20-plus pages
into a 5-page report.

345
00:24:44,441 --> 00:24:46,234
-He did?
-Yes.

346
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,321
Then I guess he did pull some weight.

347
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:50,530
Of course.

348
00:24:51,406 --> 00:24:53,658
Mr. Gong may sound
a bit abrasive at times,

349
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:56,620
but he's actually a very warm person.

350
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:58,830
Innate leadership!

351
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,373
Deep affection for his employees.

352
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,626
You witnessed it for yourself.

353
00:25:03,877 --> 00:25:05,128
Abrasive on the outside,
warm on the inside.

354
00:25:05,212 --> 00:25:06,296
I guess I agree.

355
00:25:06,379 --> 00:25:07,631
She agrees!

356
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,925
We all agree!

357
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:20,685
The report was in such a dismal state

358
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,271
that I had no choice but to intervene.

359
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:25,607
However, this will be the last time.

360
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:28,068
Please take care of your business,

361
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,570
so I don't have to be disturbed.

362
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,907
Don't bother me.

363
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:48,505
Oh my gosh!

364
00:25:58,765 --> 00:25:59,599
Are you okay?

365
00:26:03,353 --> 00:26:04,562
Are you hurt?

366
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:29,379
I thought about the exhibition
you mentioned last time.

367
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,216
I put together a proposal
for the photography exhibition.

368
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:34,217
To start,

369
00:26:34,718 --> 00:26:36,803
I did some research on a possible concept,

370
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:39,931
mission statement, and exhibition design.

371
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:43,435
Regarding exhibition design,
there could be three…

372
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,020
Those gentle, doe eyes.

373
00:26:45,103 --> 00:26:46,688
That sharp nose.

374
00:26:47,272 --> 00:26:49,232
Those plump lips.

375
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,485
All of that…

376
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:00,785
Ms. Yu?

377
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:03,288
Yes? Oh, right.

378
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:04,748
Are you okay?

379
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:07,417
What's wrong with me?

380
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,794
Why are you so handsome today?

381
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,217
I came because I had a few questions
before making up my mind.

382
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,304
First, regarding profit distribution--

383
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:20,388
Ha-yeong.

384
00:27:20,472 --> 00:27:22,515
Chanal has new arrivals.
Let's go have a look.

385
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,642
You're with a guest.

386
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:28,521
This is Mr. Kim Seon-u, who will be
participating in our upcoming exhibition.

387
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:31,566
And this is Ms. Han Mi-ok,
the director of the art hall.

388
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:34,652
Nice to meet you. I'm Kim Seon-u.

389
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,655
What a shame.
The exhibition has been canceled.

390
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,741
What? Why?

391
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,785
Excuse us for a moment.

392
00:27:43,078 --> 00:27:43,912
What?

393
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:48,208
What are you talking about?
You said you'd persuade Dad.

394
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:50,085
I did because you said you'd do your best.

395
00:27:50,168 --> 00:27:52,420
But is this what you call doing your best?

396
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,758
At the very least, you should bring
an artist with a name to the table.

397
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,259
This is just insulting.

398
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,969
You brought someone so insignificant.

399
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:02,597
Mom, how could you say that?

400
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,598
2025 TAEYU ART HALL
PHOTOGRAPHY EXHIBITION PROPOSAL

401
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,642
I don't want third-rate artists.

402
00:28:06,935 --> 00:28:09,187
Wrap it up. I'm off to Chanal by myself.

403
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:22,617
It appears coming here was a mistake.

404
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,910
No, that's not--

405
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:26,246
It looks like you're in trouble
because of me.

406
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,331
I'm sorry.

407
00:28:29,874 --> 00:28:30,792
I'll be off then.

408
00:28:36,714 --> 00:28:40,093
I heard the report from Ji-hyeok's team
was quite useful.

409
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:44,681
He may be snappy with his words,
but I guess he's still working hard.

410
00:28:46,015 --> 00:28:47,100
Well…

411
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,394
Never mind.

412
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,147
What is it? You can tell me anything.

413
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,276
The truth is,

414
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:59,779
Ji-hyeok had been skipping work
without notice until yesterday.

415
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,240
He even missed the submission deadline
for his report.

416
00:29:02,323 --> 00:29:03,950
He's having trouble with team management,

417
00:29:04,033 --> 00:29:06,077
so I've been paying
more attention to them.

418
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,205
I can't tell if he's just a poor fit
or if he's struggling to adjust.

419
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,458
As his older sister,

420
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:13,334
I can't help but be concerned.

421
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,461
Is that so?

422
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,713
That's what that punk did?

423
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,886
Did you call for me?

424
00:29:25,221 --> 00:29:28,767
You've only just started working,
and you're skipping work already?

425
00:29:29,434 --> 00:29:31,019
Do you think this is a joke?

426
00:29:31,936 --> 00:29:32,937
I completed

427
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:35,857
the assigned task without any issues,
so what's the problem?

428
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,692
Don't take your job
or this company lightly.

429
00:29:38,359 --> 00:29:41,321
Running a business isn't like consulting,

430
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:43,615
where you can just
make it look good enough to pass.

431
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:47,035
You must lead the organization responsibly
to achieve respectable results.

432
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,537
Isn't securing the partnership
with Taeyu C&T,

433
00:29:51,790 --> 00:29:55,960
under the guise of an arranged marriage,
the result I'm expected to achieve?

434
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,546
I don't recall any of this grandiose talk

435
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:01,216
about the organization or its management
in the agreement.

436
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,093
So what? You're just going to
keep this behavior up?

437
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,804
You don't need to worry about that.

438
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,722
I'll carry on the corporate employee act

439
00:30:08,598 --> 00:30:11,518
just enough to avoid Chairman Yu
hearing anything negative.

440
00:30:12,101 --> 00:30:14,187
I'm a man of my word.

441
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:16,981
Unlike someone.

442
00:30:21,528 --> 00:30:22,403
You…

443
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,114
Why that punk…

444
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:27,784
Unbelievable.

445
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,673
MY MOM

446
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,008
Hey, Mom.

447
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:47,470
Who is this?

448
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:52,600
Mom.

449
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:54,602
What happened?

450
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,855
It's nothing.

451
00:30:56,938 --> 00:30:58,773
You broke your leg. How is this nothing?

452
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:04,195
I just fell down the stairs.
It was an accident.

453
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:05,947
It was an accident, right?

454
00:31:07,532 --> 00:31:08,700
It really was an accident, right?

455
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,328
It was.

456
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,080
Don't worry.

457
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,375
Are you hurt anywhere else?

458
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,544
What about your arm? Is your arm okay?

459
00:31:19,627 --> 00:31:22,422
They said I was fine.
They ran all the tests.

460
00:31:26,885 --> 00:31:27,719
Mom.

461
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:31,264
Do you know how scared I was?

462
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,484
How?

463
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,696
How could you do this?

464
00:31:46,779 --> 00:31:49,616
I didn't know she had the child.
I didn't even know she got pregnant.

465
00:31:50,241 --> 00:31:51,659
I only found out after she died.

466
00:31:53,328 --> 00:31:54,245
Is that an excuse?

467
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,581
I truly loved you.

468
00:31:56,664 --> 00:31:58,499
It might've been an arranged marriage,

469
00:31:58,583 --> 00:32:02,670
but I respected and trusted you
as my husband and Ji-hyeok's father.

470
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,714
So how could you bring that child here?

471
00:32:04,797 --> 00:32:06,007
Do you not care about Ji-hyeok?

472
00:32:06,090 --> 00:32:07,508
Then what was I supposed to do?

473
00:32:09,928 --> 00:32:11,012
Do you remember?

474
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,806
You told me that if I took care
of your father's bankruptcy,

475
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:15,433
you'd repay me somehow.

476
00:32:15,516 --> 00:32:17,143
I'll pay off that debt.

477
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,978
So you repay me with this.

478
00:32:20,229 --> 00:32:21,439
You can't be serious.

479
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,318
That was the first day

480
00:32:25,944 --> 00:32:28,071
I heard my mom cry.

481
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,532
That's when I realized
she could actually cry,

482
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:34,077
louder

483
00:32:34,744 --> 00:32:36,120
and more sorrowfully than me.

484
00:32:38,289 --> 00:32:41,250
It was the sound of the ground
beneath my feet crumbling away.

485
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,212
After my sister arrived,

486
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,965
my mom lost her smile.

487
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,927
So it made me want to do everything well.

488
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:55,473
I was willing to do anything
if it could make her smile.

489
00:32:55,556 --> 00:32:57,850
Mom, I got a medal in taekwondo.

490
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,693
Mom?

491
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:13,700
Mom!

492
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,414
Mom!

493
00:33:42,395 --> 00:33:43,479
Really?

494
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,106
Yeah.

495
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:48,985
What did that team leader
who's been giving you a hard time say?

496
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,903
When I brought my A-game,

497
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:52,905
he was just stunned.

498
00:33:53,448 --> 00:33:56,409
I knew you were going to do well.

499
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,703
Ever since you were a kid,

500
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,205
you've always worked hard at everything,

501
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,458
and you've always taken good care
of those around you.

502
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:08,212
You were loved by all, wherever you went.

503
00:34:08,755 --> 00:34:11,299
-Was I?
-Yeah.

504
00:34:11,382 --> 00:34:12,467
You just wait and see.

505
00:34:12,550 --> 00:34:15,344
Even that team leader or whatever

506
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:18,056
will come to adore you.

507
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,348
I knew it.

508
00:34:19,432 --> 00:34:22,518
My mom is the only one in this world
who truly sees me for who I am.

509
00:34:31,694 --> 00:34:33,279
You must feel so refreshed.

510
00:34:34,697 --> 00:34:36,491
What? Mr. Gong?

511
00:34:41,954 --> 00:34:42,872
Ms. Go Da-rim?

512
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:44,207
What are you doing here?

513
00:34:45,374 --> 00:34:48,586
Is he your team leader?

514
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:49,670
Yeah.

515
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:53,591
Hello.

516
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,636
I'm Go Da-rim's mother.

517
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,847
-Wait, let me…
-Mom, you can't stand up.

518
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:02,475
He's your boss.
I have to greet him properly.

519
00:35:02,558 --> 00:35:04,060
-No, please sit.
-Mom.

520
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:05,812
No, wait.

521
00:35:05,895 --> 00:35:08,022
The floor must be cold.

522
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,524
Is that better?

523
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,151
Don't strain yourself.

524
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:15,029
Thank you, sir.

525
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,282
Thank you for hiring my Da-rim.

526
00:35:18,866 --> 00:35:21,786
Things were rough for her for a long time.

527
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:24,789
But now that she's working,
her eyes are sparkling and full of life.

528
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:32,880
I believe it's all thanks to working
with a great man like you.

529
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:38,052
Please continue to take good care
of my Da-rim.

530
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:38,970
Sure thing.

531
00:35:39,762 --> 00:35:42,640
Please be kind to her.

532
00:35:53,693 --> 00:35:56,404
Is your mother very unwell?

533
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,408
The men who chased me yesterday…

534
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,995
are loan sharks.

535
00:36:04,871 --> 00:36:07,790
The truth is, my younger sister
borrowed money from everywhere

536
00:36:08,916 --> 00:36:10,459
before going into hiding.

537
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:13,421
The shock led my mother to collapse,

538
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:17,133
and she even ended up
having heart surgery.

539
00:36:18,384 --> 00:36:19,468
I see.

540
00:36:20,595 --> 00:36:21,429
And now?

541
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:23,472
She's a lot better.

542
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:25,391
That's good to hear.

543
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:31,647
I was so scared
when I first found out what happened.

544
00:36:33,149 --> 00:36:36,277
I felt nauseous

545
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,904
and dizzy.

546
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:41,240
I don't even know how to describe it.

547
00:36:43,826 --> 00:36:44,744
Like the ground…

548
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:48,623
was crumbling beneath you?

549
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,041
That's it.

550
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,336
It felt like the ground
beneath my feet crumbled away,

551
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:56,923
and I was free-falling
with no end in sight.

552
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:03,930
I was such a fool.

553
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:07,642
My mom is only human.

554
00:37:09,769 --> 00:37:13,773
How did I never once think
that she could collapse?

555
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:17,985
Because she's your mom.

556
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:21,280
Because she was always there for you,

557
00:37:23,783 --> 00:37:25,326
keeping you safe.

558
00:37:31,707 --> 00:37:35,544
Every time the hospital staff calls out
"Ms. Jeong Myeong-sun's guardian,"

559
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:37,505
I have this awakening

560
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:40,466
and realize that I'm my mom's guardian.

561
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:42,677
Now,

562
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:46,097
it's my turn to protect her.

563
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,975
It was only then that I realized

564
00:37:49,892 --> 00:37:51,227
how heavy a burden my mom

565
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:56,357
had been carrying as my guardian
for all these years.

566
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,110
And how…

567
00:38:01,445 --> 00:38:03,197
peacefully and comfortably
I had been living

568
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:06,575
in a sanctuary under her protection.

569
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:20,798
Speaking of which, Mr. Gong,

570
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:23,175
could you please

571
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,553
give me and our team members

572
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:29,807
another chance?

573
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,270
As mothers and guardians,

574
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,315
they all live
with desperate determination.

575
00:38:39,358 --> 00:38:41,819
Please give them the chance
to give it their all without any regret.

576
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,488
Can you just help us out…

577
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,616
for six months?

578
00:38:48,826 --> 00:38:50,661
Please.

579
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,748
I'm trying to live.

580
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,127
These are not just pieces of paper.

581
00:38:58,794 --> 00:39:01,297
These are our livelihoods and lifelines.

582
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,215
-Hello.
-Hello.

583
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:05,259
I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?

584
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,218
-Yes!
-Okay.

585
00:39:06,302 --> 00:39:07,136
Mother.

586
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,137
-TF!
-TF!

587
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:09,972
Everyone loved it.

588
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:11,766
Really?

589
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:20,483
As if you all would stop
just because I say so.

590
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,278
Everyone's so stubborn
with such strong personalities.

591
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,281
All right, fine.

592
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:29,533
Knock yourselves out.

593
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:30,701
Really?

594
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:32,286
Do you mean it?

595
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:35,122
You can't bring up our kiss again

596
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:37,249
and threaten to fire me and all, okay?

597
00:39:37,333 --> 00:39:38,626
Lower your voice!

598
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:40,378
That's nothing to brag about.

599
00:39:40,461 --> 00:39:42,588
I mean, you just keep bringing it up.

600
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,678
I'm going to forget about it,

601
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,098
so don't ever mention it again.

602
00:39:53,766 --> 00:39:54,809
It was nothing.

603
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:01,065
Right.

604
00:40:01,649 --> 00:40:03,692
It was nothing.

605
00:40:16,539 --> 00:40:18,207
Forget about it?

606
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:21,710
What a relief.

607
00:40:24,338 --> 00:40:25,381
Such a relief.

608
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:41,564
I'm on my way now.

609
00:40:41,647 --> 00:40:42,898
Okay.

610
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:44,567
All right.

611
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,405
Do you have a minute?

612
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:52,158
I wanted to apologize for yesterday.

613
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,200
Not right now.

614
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:54,368
Right.

615
00:40:54,452 --> 00:40:55,911
I need to go pick up my son.

616
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:00,708
You have a child?

617
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:01,750
Why?

618
00:41:01,834 --> 00:41:04,170
What do you mean why?
He was born. That's why.

619
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,505
So you're married.

620
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:10,259
-Hello.
-Oh.

621
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:12,261
We have a reservation under Kim So-yeong.

622
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:21,020
Hello, this is Jun's dad.

623
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:24,315
I was wondering if it'd be possible
for Jun to stay for the nighttime care.

624
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,945
There's no one
who can pick him up right now.

625
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:32,948
I can go.

626
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,284
I'll pick him up.

627
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,870
Just a moment.

628
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:40,498
Will you really?

629
00:41:40,581 --> 00:41:41,540
Yes.

630
00:41:43,542 --> 00:41:45,211
Hello?

631
00:41:45,294 --> 00:41:47,796
I'm going to have an acquaintance
pick him up.

632
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:50,049
Okay, thank you. Bye.

633
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:53,385
My mom made these cookies.

634
00:41:54,178 --> 00:41:55,137
-Really?
-Awesome.

635
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,598
What do you think? Don't they look tasty?

636
00:41:57,681 --> 00:41:59,183
Yeah. She's the best.

637
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,061
My mom's really good at cooking too.

638
00:42:02,144 --> 00:42:04,772
My mom cooks well and is really pretty.

639
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,857
No, my mom's prettier.

640
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:08,359
-You're wrong.
-My mom's prettier.

641
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,818
No, my mom's prettier.

642
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,737
-No, you're wrong!
-Who's Jun?

643
00:42:19,995 --> 00:42:22,081
-She's so pretty.
-She is.

644
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:32,049
Wow, she's so pretty.

645
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:34,343
Me.

646
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:36,428
Okay.

647
00:42:37,346 --> 00:42:38,472
Let's go.

648
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,391
Who are you?

649
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:42,685
Your dad's friend.

650
00:42:44,436 --> 00:42:46,272
She said she's friends with his dad.

651
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,983
I'm here on behalf of Mr. Kim Seon-u.

652
00:42:49,775 --> 00:42:50,985
Let's go.

653
00:42:51,068 --> 00:42:51,986
Bye, Jun.

654
00:42:52,069 --> 00:42:55,823
-Jun, you're so cool!
-I'm so jealous!

655
00:42:55,906 --> 00:42:58,284
-I'm so jealous of him.
-He's so lucky.

656
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:08,210
-You think I'm pretty too, right?
-Yes.

657
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:13,591
I guess you can't fool
the pure, innocent eyes of a child.

658
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,218
You're pretty handsome too.

659
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:18,679
Do you take after your mom or dad?

660
00:43:19,972 --> 00:43:21,390
Probably my dad.

661
00:43:21,473 --> 00:43:22,891
Why probably?

662
00:43:22,975 --> 00:43:25,352
I don't know what my mom looks like.

663
00:43:25,436 --> 00:43:26,854
I've never met her.

664
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:30,274
Really?

665
00:43:32,109 --> 00:43:35,487
Are you just my dad's friend
or his girlfriend?

666
00:43:36,113 --> 00:43:37,281
Just a friend.

667
00:43:38,073 --> 00:43:38,991
I see.

668
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:40,618
Why?

669
00:43:40,701 --> 00:43:42,536
Do you want me to be
your dad's girlfriend?

670
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,496
Yes.

671
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:47,916
Let's go.

672
00:43:51,920 --> 00:43:54,256
How did the TF team produce such a report?

673
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,758
Oh, that?

674
00:43:55,841 --> 00:43:56,884
I reviewed it as well,

675
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,803
and it was very informative
and well-organized.

676
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,056
It had excellent readability.

677
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:03,641
Exactly.

678
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,311
I'm asking how a bunch of
loser stay-at-home moms pulled this off.

679
00:44:07,394 --> 00:44:09,855
The loser stay-at-home moms

680
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:11,065
couldn't have written that.

681
00:44:11,148 --> 00:44:15,402
I bet it was written
by Mr. Gong or Mr. Kang.

682
00:44:16,445 --> 00:44:17,529
This won't do.

683
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,616
We'll have to put them in the spotlight.

684
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:22,660
A live commerce?

685
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:24,578
Today?

686
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:26,789
Yes, it's an emergency.

687
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:29,833
Our competitor is about to livestream
a huge flash sale on diapers.

688
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:32,586
If we don't actively counter it
with one of our own,

689
00:44:32,670 --> 00:44:34,171
we'll suffer a major blow.

690
00:44:34,254 --> 00:44:37,049
But out of all days,
the entire broadcast team

691
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,634
just had to be on a business trip.

692
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:40,469
This sounds like it's outside our purview.

693
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,431
No one here has experience with that.

694
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,225
What are you talking about?

695
00:44:46,308 --> 00:44:48,727
We've changed hundreds,
thousands of diapers.

696
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:50,896
It's a piece of cake.

697
00:44:50,979 --> 00:44:53,732
You've changed diapers,
but you've never done a broadcast before.

698
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:56,777
That might actually be better.

699
00:44:56,860 --> 00:45:02,116
They may lack experience in hosting,
but we could work the real mom angle.

700
00:45:02,199 --> 00:45:03,617
Appeal to consumers with authenticity!

701
00:45:04,535 --> 00:45:09,039
That's the kind of strategy
that works in today's market!

702
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:13,293
I was a member
of the broadcasting club in high school.

703
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:17,131
My friends used to rave about my voice.

704
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:20,217
If the sales are strong, it could help
our performance reviews later too.

705
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:21,802
It sounds like a good opportunity.

706
00:45:21,885 --> 00:45:23,595
I mean, that's true, but…

707
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:24,763
Forget it.

708
00:45:26,682 --> 00:45:28,100
Look for another team.

709
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,018
What if something goes wrong
during the live?

710
00:45:30,727 --> 00:45:33,647
Mr. Gong,
can't you trust us just this once?

711
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:36,692
-We're confident we can do it.
-Yeah!

712
00:45:36,775 --> 00:45:38,527
-Right?
-Yeah.

713
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,202
All right, then.

714
00:45:47,286 --> 00:45:51,457
-I'll take that as a yes.
-Yes.

715
00:45:51,540 --> 00:45:52,749
Make sure you prepare well.

716
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:54,877
-I can't believe it.
-I know we can do this.

717
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,545
-We need to start prepping now.
-Right.

718
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:58,964
-We need to come up with a plan.
-Right.

719
00:45:59,047 --> 00:45:59,965
-Of course.
-Right.

720
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,300
I'll write the script.

721
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,718
-That's great.
-Sounds good.

722
00:46:10,517 --> 00:46:12,686
Ms. Bae and Ms. Jang will be our hosts.

723
00:46:12,769 --> 00:46:13,687
-Okay.
-Okay.

724
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:16,482
-Ms. Lee and I will do the prep.
-Okay.

725
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,233
The purchasing of props
and the giveaway prize

726
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:19,568
will be done by Ms. Go and…

727
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:21,987
Mr. Gong.

728
00:46:24,948 --> 00:46:26,200
I have to participate?

729
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:27,534
Were you planning on freeloading?

730
00:46:28,744 --> 00:46:30,078
Fine, I'll do it.

731
00:46:30,871 --> 00:46:32,831
For the giveaway prize,

732
00:46:32,915 --> 00:46:35,292
how about BeBeZza,
our company's baby formula maker?

733
00:46:35,375 --> 00:46:37,002
I looked into that as well,

734
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:39,004
but the new model sold out
as soon as it launched,

735
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:40,756
so even HQ can't secure inventory.

736
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:43,800
They said the next restock
will happen next week.

737
00:46:43,884 --> 00:46:46,303
Why don't we
think of something else for today?

738
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:47,971
That's too bad.

739
00:46:48,055 --> 00:46:49,890
We'd sell out with a BeBeZza giveaway.

740
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:54,102
Nan-suk and I'll be heading to the salon.

741
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:57,397
It'd be rude not to at least
do our hair for a broadcast.

742
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,608
-We probably should.
-Yes.

743
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:02,152
Great. But first, bring it in.

744
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:03,070
-Bring it in.
-Come on.

745
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:05,864
You all remember, right?

746
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,158
-I say, "Mother." You say, "TF." Okay?
-Okay.

747
00:47:08,242 --> 00:47:09,993
-Mother.
-TF!

748
00:47:12,538 --> 00:47:14,540
We got this! Let's go!

749
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:15,541
Nan-suk.

750
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,882
Thank you for giving us a chance,
Mr. Gong.

751
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,842
A chance. That's it.

752
00:47:26,468 --> 00:47:27,469
You figure out the rest.

753
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,098
I'm also just giving you a ride.
That's it.

754
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:34,268
Don't even think about
asking me for support.

755
00:47:34,351 --> 00:47:35,686
I won't. Don't worry.

756
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,369
These are so cute.

757
00:47:52,452 --> 00:47:54,746
Don't you think these would be adorable
as props in the background?

758
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,623
Not really.

759
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:58,375
Which one do you think is better?

760
00:48:02,087 --> 00:48:03,088
That one.

761
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,799
My gosh, I knew it.

762
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,677
Your husband has a discerning eye.

763
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,805
This is our recent bestseller.

764
00:48:11,888 --> 00:48:13,056
"Husband"?

765
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,058
Who are you calling her husband?

766
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:16,643
Pardon?

767
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,895
We're just work colleagues.

768
00:48:18,979 --> 00:48:19,813
Team leader.

769
00:48:19,896 --> 00:48:20,981
Team member.

770
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:24,318
I told you I didn't want to shop.

771
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:26,862
-I'm sorry.
-No worries.

772
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:39,082
-Let's go if you have everything.
-Not yet.

773
00:48:39,166 --> 00:48:41,251
I still have to get the giveaway prize.
That's what matters most.

774
00:48:41,335 --> 00:48:43,128
It needs to be impactful.

775
00:48:43,211 --> 00:48:44,546
What should we get?

776
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:45,922
You'd know better than me

777
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,884
what moms would like.

778
00:48:48,967 --> 00:48:50,677
Now, for the winning couple
of today's game…

779
00:48:50,761 --> 00:48:52,763
-Right, of course, I do know.
-Ta-da!

780
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:54,723
-I do, but…
-This is sold out everywhere.

781
00:48:54,806 --> 00:48:57,267
It's the newest baby formula maker
from Natural BeBe.

782
00:48:57,351 --> 00:49:00,354
BeBeZza!

783
00:49:01,897 --> 00:49:02,898
BeBeZza?

784
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,566
-Are you excited about this?
-BeBeZza?

785
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:05,859
-Make some noise!
-Mr. Gong, it's BeBeZza!

786
00:49:05,942 --> 00:49:07,402
-It's BeBeZza!
-What are you doing?

787
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,199
I say, "BeBe." You say, "Zza."

788
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:14,117
-BeBeZza!
-Do you see how the moms are going wild?

789
00:49:14,201 --> 00:49:16,953
We need to win that
and give that away on our livestream.

790
00:49:17,037 --> 00:49:18,747
-We must.
-Let's just buy something else.

791
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:20,082
We have to sign up for the game now.

792
00:49:20,165 --> 00:49:21,375
Wait, hold on.

793
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:22,292
You can do it alone.

794
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:23,293
Good luck!

795
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:25,212
How can I?

796
00:49:25,295 --> 00:49:27,172
Only married couples can participate.

797
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,465
Just once.

798
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:29,633
-BeBeZza!
-BeBeZza!

799
00:49:29,716 --> 00:49:30,592
Please.

800
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:49,778
I'm really about to lose it.

801
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,156
The first round is called
"Newspaper of Love."

802
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:56,493
If even one of the couples
steps on the ground outside the newspaper,

803
00:49:56,576 --> 00:49:58,620
that couple will be out.

804
00:49:58,704 --> 00:50:01,623
Couples that survive five seconds
will move on to the next round.

805
00:50:01,707 --> 00:50:03,166
Get ready!

806
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,292
PANGPANG, BULLDOZER

807
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,419
LOVEY, DOVEY

808
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,503
ENTJ

809
00:50:07,003 --> 00:50:08,046
SKY, ROCKET

810
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:15,470
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

811
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:17,931
Let the second round begin!

812
00:50:21,351 --> 00:50:26,648
-Five, four, three, two, one!
-Five, four, three, two, one!

813
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,525
Let the third round begin!

814
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,754
-Five, four, three…
-Five, four, three…

815
00:50:48,837 --> 00:50:50,338
This is getting intense.

816
00:50:50,422 --> 00:50:52,299
-Two, one!
-Two, one!

817
00:50:52,883 --> 00:50:54,801
Pass!

818
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:55,844
It's time for the fourth round.

819
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,138
The difficulty level
is getting much higher.

820
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,765
Here we go!

821
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,476
Oh no, my handsome husband.

822
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,102
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

823
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,562
Are you okay?

824
00:51:05,645 --> 00:51:07,773
Yes, I'm okay.

825
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:11,193
Wait, hold on. Watch my hair.

826
00:51:11,818 --> 00:51:13,028
Hang on.

827
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:23,580
Damn it, this is brutal.

828
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,637
Now, the final round
for the last two teams will be

829
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:39,805
"From Mouth to Mouth."

830
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,140
Ready? Start!

831
00:52:23,473 --> 00:52:24,683
The winning team is…

832
00:52:24,766 --> 00:52:27,060
Congratulations, Team One!

833
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:52,335
Seriously!

834
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:54,129
Why did you make me participate?

835
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,172
I'm sorry.

836
00:52:56,756 --> 00:52:57,924
Get in.

837
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,217
It just made us run late.

838
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,261
Hold on.

839
00:53:05,098 --> 00:53:05,974
Got it.

840
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:11,605
My BeBeZza…

841
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:13,273
Hey.

842
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:15,859
I need to use the bathroom.

843
00:53:15,942 --> 00:53:16,985
Okay.

844
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,740
Excuse me?

845
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,701
You want to make a trade?

846
00:53:25,535 --> 00:53:26,369
Yes.

847
00:53:26,953 --> 00:53:28,330
Babe.

848
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,247
Why would we?

849
00:53:29,331 --> 00:53:32,500
We worked our butts off to win this,
and this is worth way more than that.

850
00:53:32,584 --> 00:53:35,253
-Right, babe?
-Yeah. What a weirdo.

851
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,138
How much do you want?

852
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,266
It's a black card.

853
00:53:51,895 --> 00:53:53,980
They just agreed to trade it?

854
00:53:54,564 --> 00:53:55,398
Yes.

855
00:53:55,482 --> 00:53:57,859
They said their baby started eating
solid food or something,

856
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:00,570
and they just entered the contest for fun.

857
00:54:00,654 --> 00:54:02,155
Really?

858
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:04,532
But they were playing
like their lives depended on it.

859
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,994
Anyway, they're such nice people.

860
00:54:08,078 --> 00:54:10,080
I'm sure they could've sold it
for a lot of money.

861
00:54:10,163 --> 00:54:11,164
How nice of them.

862
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,999
-It was pretty expensive.
-Sorry?

863
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:15,460
-What?
-What?

864
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:17,087
Nothing.

865
00:54:25,303 --> 00:54:27,639
What sort of game did you play
for them to give you that?

866
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:30,058
Well…

867
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,311
You know, just a normal game.

868
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,564
What about Ms. Bae and Ms. Jang?

869
00:54:36,648 --> 00:54:38,900
They said they were getting changed.

870
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:41,486
Oh, there they…

871
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,490
Nan-suk!

872
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:47,534
What's wrong?

873
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:48,827
What? It's nothing.

874
00:54:49,411 --> 00:54:50,954
Something is clearly going on.

875
00:54:51,037 --> 00:54:52,706
Your face is a mess.

876
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:53,748
I'm fine.

877
00:54:53,832 --> 00:54:56,251
Should I get ready over there?

878
00:54:56,334 --> 00:54:57,836
What happened? Tell me.

879
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,920
No, don't worry about it.

880
00:54:59,004 --> 00:55:01,464
Did something happen to your child?

881
00:55:04,634 --> 00:55:05,844
Well, I…

882
00:55:06,428 --> 00:55:08,680
My youngest has always been weak.

883
00:55:08,763 --> 00:55:12,225
He's running a fever of 40°C,
and he's at the ER right now.

884
00:55:12,308 --> 00:55:14,853
I'm just so worried about him.

885
00:55:14,936 --> 00:55:15,812
Go to him.

886
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,733
No, Mr. Gong, it's fine.
I need to finish work first.

887
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,817
It's an order.

888
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,319
Go.

889
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,447
Yes, you should.

890
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,865
Your child is sick.

891
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:28,283
What could be more important?

892
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,994
We'll take care of the broadcast,
so hurry and go.

893
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:34,414
Are you sure?

894
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,292
Okay. Thank you.

895
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:40,795
-Thank you.
-Okay.

896
00:55:41,379 --> 00:55:42,672
Get there safely.

897
00:55:46,009 --> 00:55:47,052
Then…

898
00:55:47,802 --> 00:55:49,137
Who will host?

899
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:50,388
Ms. Jang has to do it alone.

900
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,723
Where is she?

901
00:55:52,807 --> 00:55:54,934
I'm right here.

902
00:55:58,063 --> 00:55:59,064
Jin-hui.

903
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,191
What's wrong with you?

904
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:04,277
Well, you see…

905
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,280
Oh my goodness.

906
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,700
I look like a news anchor.

907
00:56:10,784 --> 00:56:13,453
This definitely calls for a selfie.

908
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:15,205
My goodness.

909
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,085
Come on, lighting.

910
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:22,003
You need to help me out here.

911
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:25,173
Don't worry, I can fix you.

912
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:45,860
-I can do it while wearing my sun--
-Are you being serious right now?

913
00:56:47,153 --> 00:56:49,197
You should also go to the hospital. Go.

914
00:56:50,406 --> 00:56:51,282
Wait, hold on.

915
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,534
Ji-hyeok.

916
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,619
-I'm sorry.
-You should go.

917
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,538
-I think I hurt my back too.
-Oh gosh.

918
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:58,665
-What am I going to do?
-You'll be okay.

919
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:03,044
Should we just cancel it?

920
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:04,003
No, we can't.

921
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:05,130
Of course not.

922
00:57:05,213 --> 00:57:06,381
Then what do we do?

923
00:57:09,134 --> 00:57:10,593
Five seconds to air!

924
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,888
Three, two, one.

925
00:57:16,141 --> 00:57:20,145
STARTING NOW

926
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,021
What the…

927
00:57:25,942 --> 00:57:27,152
Say hello.

928
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,283
Hello.

929
00:57:33,366 --> 00:57:36,244
I'm Lee Go-eun
from Natural BeBe's Mother TF Team.

930
00:57:36,828 --> 00:57:39,497
I'm Go Da-rim.

931
00:57:40,081 --> 00:57:44,878
Today, we'll be holding a mega sale event
for Angel Hug diapers.

932
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,421
For the giveaway prize,

933
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:50,842
we've prepared your favorite, BeBeZza,

934
00:57:50,925 --> 00:57:52,886
so please stay tuned.

935
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:54,137
BEBEZZA AS A GIVEAWAY PRIZE?

936
00:57:54,220 --> 00:57:57,640
First, can you tell us
what features Angel Hug offers?

937
00:57:58,391 --> 00:58:01,019
Well…

938
00:58:08,151 --> 00:58:10,695
There's a reason why our Angel Hug

939
00:58:10,778 --> 00:58:12,780
is the most loved diaper
by moms and babies.

940
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,324
You know what it is, right?

941
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:15,867
That's correct.

942
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:19,662
Cozy and comfortable
as a hug from an angel.

943
00:58:19,746 --> 00:58:22,665
People praise it
for living up to its name.

944
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:23,708
And…

945
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:28,796
it's all thanks to its ice-cooling system.

946
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:31,424
Thirty thousand double air holes

947
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:34,010
-quickly absorb the babies' pee and poop…
-Okay.

948
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,720
Let's take a few questions.

949
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:37,013
Questions…

950
00:58:37,096 --> 00:58:38,932
LET'S ANSWER SOME QUESTIONS.
"HOW DO WE CHOOSE THE RIGHT SIZE?"

951
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:45,146
Wow, look at all those comments.

952
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,857
We'll now answer a few questions.

953
00:58:47,941 --> 00:58:51,110
"How do we choose the right size?"

954
00:58:51,194 --> 00:58:54,280
That's a question from BonnieNewbieMom.

955
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,533
Yes, our Angel Hug…

956
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:59,035
We'll now take one last question.

957
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:02,914
"Is there something that sets
Angel Hug apart from other products?"

958
00:59:02,997 --> 00:59:05,291
Go-eun, what do you think?

959
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,753
I'm not sure.

960
00:59:09,337 --> 00:59:10,380
Pardon?

961
00:59:10,964 --> 00:59:13,132
I've only ever used Angel Hug,

962
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:14,884
so I can't make a comparison.

963
00:59:15,593 --> 00:59:19,681
I believe she's saying that's
how much trust she has in Angel Hug.

964
00:59:19,764 --> 00:59:22,308
It is the number one diaper brand
in the market, after all.

965
00:59:22,392 --> 00:59:23,601
No.

966
00:59:23,685 --> 00:59:26,813
I didn't have any other choice
but Angel Hug.

967
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,651
I gave birth to my daughter
right after I graduated from high school.

968
00:59:33,111 --> 00:59:36,197
My husband worked as a deliveryman
to earn money for diapers,

969
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:39,951
but he passed away in a car accident.

970
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,204
I had a baby to raise, but no money.

971
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:45,748
I was completely lost.

972
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,752
That's when I received

973
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:52,088
a year's supply of Angel Hug diapers,
donated by Natural BeBe.

974
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:57,176
I remember crying all night
while holding onto that box.

975
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,390
As a result,

976
01:00:02,473 --> 01:00:04,851
I was able to raise my daughter well
without a single diaper rash.

977
01:00:05,393 --> 01:00:08,104
I think that's all I have to share
at this moment.

978
01:00:11,524 --> 01:00:13,234
I shouldn't have shared that.

979
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,612
I'm sorry.

980
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,488
No, Go-eun.

981
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:19,073
Don't apologize for that.

982
01:00:19,991 --> 01:00:22,410
You should be proud and commended for it.

983
01:00:24,412 --> 01:00:25,371
Look.

984
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:27,832
Everyone is cheering you on
in the comments.

985
01:00:29,167 --> 01:00:32,670
"It must've been so tough for you
at such a young age."

986
01:00:32,754 --> 01:00:34,631
"You're an amazing mother."

987
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,798
"Keep going."

988
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,052
"I'll pray for your baby
to grow up healthy."

989
01:00:41,971 --> 01:00:43,014
Thank you.

990
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:45,058
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-Okay.

991
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,103
Hey.

992
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:53,983
Okay.

993
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,527
Okay what?

994
01:00:56,611 --> 01:00:59,697
It seems Go-eun has been moved
by your comments.

995
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:02,158
Thank you so much
for your kind words of support.

996
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:06,537
While we wait for her…

997
01:01:08,122 --> 01:01:09,499
DIAPER DEMONSTRATION

998
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:14,170
Go-eun was supposed to do
the diaper demonstration.

999
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:16,422
If you could just wait for a moment…

1000
01:01:17,131 --> 01:01:18,341
Oh no, what do I do now?

1001
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,385
I've never changed a diaper before.

1002
01:01:24,555 --> 01:01:25,556
Okay.

1003
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:28,393
I'll now proceed
with the diaper demonstration.

1004
01:01:31,813 --> 01:01:33,147
Stay calm.

1005
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,775
I've already memorized the product manual.

1006
01:01:35,858 --> 01:01:39,737
Waste absorbency is the key feature
of this season's Angel Hug.

1007
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:42,073
Now, should we test it out?

1008
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,452
I'm going to pour this whole thing.

1009
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,287
Here we go.

1010
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,039
My goodness.

1011
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:51,958
There we go.

1012
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:55,586
Is this right?

1013
01:01:55,670 --> 01:01:56,796
This should be right.

1014
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,799
There we go. I did it!

1015
01:01:59,882 --> 01:02:01,008
Take a look.

1016
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:03,094
No matter how active your baby may be,

1017
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,929
it will never leak…

1018
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:13,020
THAT'S A BIT SHOCKING
ON-AIR ACCIDENT LOL

1019
01:02:13,104 --> 01:02:15,106
WHY IS IT LEAKING?
MAYBE YOU PUT IT ON WRONG?

1020
01:02:15,189 --> 01:02:16,023
Oh no.

1021
01:02:17,191 --> 01:02:18,901
Oh no!

1022
01:02:19,485 --> 01:02:21,821
What do we do?

1023
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,159
Are you satisfied?

1024
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,417
You've got to be kidding me.

1025
01:02:34,959 --> 01:02:37,086
Ms. Go! Are you really a mom?

1026
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,047
Look at the mess you made
because you couldn't change a mere diaper!

1027
01:02:40,131 --> 01:02:41,424
I'm sorry.

1028
01:02:41,507 --> 01:02:43,926
I got nervous in front of the camera.

1029
01:02:44,010 --> 01:02:47,847
Our company's credibility
has hit rock bottom because of you!

1030
01:02:47,930 --> 01:02:50,683
What are you going to do now?
How will you take responsibility?

1031
01:02:51,893 --> 01:02:53,478
That's enough, Mr. Ma.

1032
01:02:53,561 --> 01:02:54,395
What?

1033
01:03:01,277 --> 01:03:03,988
It was her first broadcast,
so she got nervous and made a mistake.

1034
01:03:04,572 --> 01:03:07,200
Weren't you the one
who forced us to take on this broadcast

1035
01:03:07,283 --> 01:03:08,993
in the first place anyway?

1036
01:03:09,076 --> 01:03:10,119
Also,

1037
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,164
Ms. Go is a member of my team.

1038
01:03:14,540 --> 01:03:16,334
If anyone is going to scold her
and take responsibility for her,

1039
01:03:17,543 --> 01:03:19,670
it'll be me.

1040
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:24,926
Then are you planning
to write up an incident report as well?

1041
01:03:25,009 --> 01:03:26,511
The director is asking for one.

1042
01:03:26,594 --> 01:03:27,929
All right.

1043
01:03:28,012 --> 01:03:28,888
I'll write it.

1044
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:30,640
Sure, go ahead then.

1045
01:03:39,357 --> 01:03:41,192
I thought I studied enough,

1046
01:03:41,692 --> 01:03:43,152
but reality is sure different.

1047
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,781
I'll just have to keep practicing.

1048
01:03:49,742 --> 01:03:50,618
Hey, Da-rim.

1049
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:52,870
You should maintain a work-life balance.

1050
01:03:52,954 --> 01:03:55,998
You shouldn't work this late
and make people wait.

1051
01:03:57,625 --> 01:04:00,086
Let go of me, or I'll report you!

1052
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:02,505
Damn it. You already did.

1053
01:04:02,588 --> 01:04:04,090
And it put me in a real tight spot.

1054
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,759
-You're coming with us.
-Because it was unlawful debt collection!

1055
01:04:06,843 --> 01:04:08,344
Just obey the law!

1056
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:15,601
Get her in the car.

1057
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:17,186
Help!

1058
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,147
Jeez, why are you so strong?

1059
01:04:21,190 --> 01:04:23,025
You're the one who scammed us.
Hey, get her in.

1060
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,027
Help! No!

1061
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:28,573
-Help me!
-Hey!

1062
01:04:28,656 --> 01:04:30,658
Lift her legs!

1063
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,869
Lift her legs!

1064
01:04:32,952 --> 01:04:34,787
The men who chased me yesterday

1065
01:04:34,871 --> 01:04:36,664
are loan sharks.

1066
01:04:36,747 --> 01:04:39,792
The truth is, my younger sister
borrowed money from everywhere

1067
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,420
before going into hiding.

1068
01:04:45,631 --> 01:04:46,841
Let's get going.

1069
01:04:48,050 --> 01:04:49,385
Goddamn it!

1070
01:04:50,261 --> 01:04:53,347
Just stay still!

1071
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:56,893
Why are you so damn strong?

1072
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,019
Hey!

1073
01:04:58,102 --> 01:04:59,145
What are you doing?

1074
01:04:59,228 --> 01:05:00,605
-No!
-Hey!

1075
01:05:00,688 --> 01:05:02,690
Do you want me to
toss you out of a moving car?

1076
01:06:09,382 --> 01:06:10,508
I'll pay you back.

1077
01:06:10,591 --> 01:06:12,134
I can just pay you back.

1078
01:06:12,218 --> 01:06:13,552
One million won per month.

1079
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:15,638
I'll be able to pay it off in 30 months.

1080
01:06:15,721 --> 01:06:17,139
Come on now.

1081
01:06:17,223 --> 01:06:19,600
-That doesn't add up.
-What do you mean?

1082
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,519
You forgot the interest.

1083
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:23,479
We're loan sharks.

1084
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:24,438
Let me see that.

1085
01:06:24,522 --> 01:06:25,356
Yes, sir.

1086
01:06:27,149 --> 01:06:30,945
See? 30 months is 270 million won
in interest alone.

1087
01:06:32,238 --> 01:06:33,322
Can you pay that?

1088
01:06:33,406 --> 01:06:35,825
How does 30 million won
become 300 million won?

1089
01:06:36,409 --> 01:06:37,493
That's why

1090
01:06:38,327 --> 01:06:41,956
we should settle this quickly and simply

1091
01:06:42,039 --> 01:06:43,833
before you accrue more interest.

1092
01:06:43,916 --> 01:06:45,835
I honestly don't have anything.

1093
01:06:46,919 --> 01:06:48,796
Don't be silly.

1094
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,715
Think carefully.

1095
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,845
You have a lot to offer in your body.

1096
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,474
Those eyes,

1097
01:07:00,558 --> 01:07:01,851
heart,

1098
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:03,394
liver, pancreas,

1099
01:07:03,477 --> 01:07:05,146
lungs, bone marrow,

1100
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:08,107
and more.

1101
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:09,275
No…

1102
01:07:10,901 --> 01:07:12,528
Which should we sell first?

1103
01:07:56,572 --> 01:07:57,531
Let me buy them off you.

1104
01:07:58,532 --> 01:07:59,533
How much do you want?

1105
01:08:12,046 --> 01:08:13,047
Do you take credit?

1106
01:08:34,777 --> 01:08:39,698
DYNAMITE KISS

1107
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:11,939
Did you tell your husband?
Is he always so indifferent?

1108
01:09:12,022 --> 01:09:14,066
My husband isn't like that.

1109
01:09:14,150 --> 01:09:15,568
You should know what to defend
and what not to.

1110
01:09:15,651 --> 01:09:18,404
Until you pay off this debt,
you're mine, Ms. Go Da-rim.

1111
01:09:18,487 --> 01:09:20,739
You're going to confirm
and sign off on every little thing?

1112
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:21,949
A competitive pitch?

1113
01:09:22,032 --> 01:09:23,826
-Against the marketing team, at that?
-Good luck.

1114
01:09:23,909 --> 01:09:25,953
You've never raised a kid, have you?

1115
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:27,788
Oh no. Have I been exposed?

1116
01:09:27,872 --> 01:09:29,582
What? Where are you going to work?

1117
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,876
If everyone knows I'm your husband,
it'll clear up all the doubts.

1118
01:09:31,959 --> 01:09:33,043
If it makes you uncomfortable…

1119
01:09:33,127 --> 01:09:35,254
If anyone is uncomfortable, it'd be you.

1120
01:09:35,337 --> 01:09:37,590
I look forward to working with you.
I'm Kim Seon-u.
