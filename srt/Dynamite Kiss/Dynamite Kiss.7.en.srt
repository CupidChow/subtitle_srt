1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:57,098
EMERGENCY ROOM

3
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:02,729
EPISODE 7

4
00:01:02,812 --> 00:01:05,231
Your son-in-law is so sweet
like a daughter.

5
00:01:06,232 --> 00:01:08,443
He's so well-mannered and handsome.

6
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:10,320
I'm so jealous.

7
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:11,404
-Thank you.
-My daughter

8
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:13,073
isn't even thinking about getting married.

9
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,450
I know, right?

10
00:01:16,201 --> 00:01:17,577
I wish he were my son-in-law.

11
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:20,413
He's actually my daughter's friend.

12
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:23,166
He's such a great kid

13
00:01:23,249 --> 00:01:26,294
that I wouldn't dare ask him
to take my immature daughter.

14
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:28,296
I'd feel too bad.

15
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:32,133
By the way,

16
00:01:32,842 --> 00:01:34,177
is Da-rim still at work?

17
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:36,137
I'll call her and ask.

18
00:01:36,221 --> 00:01:37,514
-Just a second.
-Okay.

19
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:39,724
That feels so good.

20
00:01:47,023 --> 00:01:49,692
The caller you are trying to reach
is unavailable.

21
00:01:49,776 --> 00:01:51,402
Please try again later.

22
00:01:54,155 --> 00:01:56,032
What's she up to?

23
00:02:14,843 --> 00:02:16,970
SEON-U

24
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,655
KANGKUK UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL

25
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:57,093
Are you awake?

26
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:01,347
Are we at a hospital?

27
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:02,849
Yes.

28
00:03:03,892 --> 00:03:05,476
You had stress-induced stomach cramps.

29
00:03:07,186 --> 00:03:08,438
How do you feel now?

30
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:11,190
I feel so much better.

31
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,944
That's a relief.

32
00:03:15,445 --> 00:03:18,531
It looks like I stole your time again.

33
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,116
I'm sorry.

34
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,997
The IV drip is almost done,
so I can go home, right?

35
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:29,542
Wait.

36
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:31,794
-Excuse me.
-Hold on.

37
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:34,088
You can't go home today.

38
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,346
I'm going to head out.
I guess Da-rim is busy today.

39
00:03:42,013 --> 00:03:42,931
I guess so.

40
00:03:43,014 --> 00:03:45,266
All right. Get home safe.

41
00:03:46,267 --> 00:03:47,894
And make sure Jun eats well.

42
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,772
-Don't worry about that.
-All right.

43
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,857
-I'll see you soon.
-All right.

44
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,859
-I'm off.
-Bye.

45
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,195
-See you.
-See you soon.

46
00:03:57,278 --> 00:03:59,656
I told you I'm really fine.

47
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,908
-I'm just going to go.
-Just do as I say.

48
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,535
The doctor said
you should stay here overnight.

49
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,205
Do you even know
how much a night in here will cost?

50
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:08,998
Why can't I stay in a shared room?

51
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,334
What can we do?
This is the only room available.

52
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,962
Since you fell sick on the clock,

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:15,546
I'll cover the hospital bills,

54
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,965
so don't worry about that.

55
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:19,676
Don't even try to
lift your head off that pillow.

56
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,386
I'll consider it insubordination

57
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,179
and dock your performance score heavily.

58
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,139
Okay, fine.

59
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:32,689
Water. I just want some water.

60
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:33,940
All right. Hold on.

61
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:35,316
Just tell me. I'll do everything.

62
00:04:36,317 --> 00:04:37,527
I'm sorry.

63
00:04:49,372 --> 00:04:50,665
Thank you.

64
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:56,587
Wow, that's so cool.

65
00:05:16,482 --> 00:05:17,900
Ms. Go Da-rim?

66
00:05:18,985 --> 00:05:21,029
-I'm here to check your blood pressure.
-Sure.

67
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:32,582
Oh, that's strange.

68
00:05:32,665 --> 00:05:34,250
Why is it so high?

69
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:39,422
Did the ER mention
any blood pressure issues?

70
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:41,424
No, I don't believe so.

71
00:05:41,507 --> 00:05:42,759
By any chance,

72
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:46,763
do you feel short of breath
or hot in the face?

73
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:49,932
No, I feel very fine.

74
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:52,602
Could it be the machine?

75
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:54,645
Yes, I think so.

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,564
-Just a moment.
-Sure.

77
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:59,067
-I'll get the manual monitor and recheck.
-Okay.

78
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:09,202
-I'm…
-Yes?

79
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:12,121
I'm going to go buy some drinks.

80
00:06:12,705 --> 00:06:16,709
Okay, then I'll stay right here.

81
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,086
Okay.

82
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
Seriously?

83
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:53,788
That feels better.

84
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:47,842
Mom…

85
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:52,305
Don't be sick.

86
00:07:55,224 --> 00:07:57,143
I'll do better.

87
00:09:18,808 --> 00:09:20,518
You didn't go home…

88
00:09:25,481 --> 00:09:27,567
and stayed by my side?

89
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,727
Hello, sir.

90
00:10:47,063 --> 00:10:49,523
You must've waited long.
Sorry, my flight was delayed.

91
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:51,359
You must be tired.
Let me take your suitcase.

92
00:10:51,442 --> 00:10:53,486
No, it's light. Let's just go.

93
00:10:53,569 --> 00:10:55,029
But still, I should…

94
00:10:55,112 --> 00:10:58,032
It's okay, I can take it. Let's go.

95
00:10:58,115 --> 00:10:58,949
All right.

96
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:01,369
Sir, here you go.

97
00:11:01,952 --> 00:11:02,953
Please take me there.

98
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,707
A dog shelter?

99
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,335
It's in the opposite direction
from your house.

100
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:12,254
I know. I want to meet a friend first.

101
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:14,590
Your mother is preparing a meal.

102
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,550
Wouldn't it be best to go straight home?

103
00:11:16,634 --> 00:11:18,177
It's fine. Let's stop by there first.

104
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:20,846
The truth is,

105
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,683
she specifically told me
that even if you ask to stop by somewhere,

106
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:27,103
I should ignore it
and bring you straight home.

107
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,604
I see.

108
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,898
All right, then.

109
00:11:31,482 --> 00:11:32,900
-Let's go home.
-Yes, sir.

110
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,707
Oh no.

111
00:11:48,791 --> 00:11:49,959
I only have US dollars on me.

112
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:52,044
I'll leave you to exchange it.

113
00:11:54,755 --> 00:11:56,215
What's this, sir?

114
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,467
What else could it be?
It's your severance pay.

115
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,677
-Pardon?
-Oh.

116
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,679
You don't need to come in
starting tomorrow.

117
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:03,389
I don't understand.

118
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:06,600
You're just not getting it, are you?

119
00:12:07,518 --> 00:12:09,603
I really hate repeating things.

120
00:12:09,687 --> 00:12:10,563
Get lost.

121
00:12:13,816 --> 00:12:14,692
Take care.

122
00:12:30,332 --> 00:12:31,500
Mother.

123
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:33,294
Oh, Tae-yeong!

124
00:12:33,377 --> 00:12:34,962
Come here and sit.

125
00:12:35,045 --> 00:12:37,047
These are the options
for our party invitations.

126
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:39,300
Take a look
and choose your favorite design.

127
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:41,802
This just shows how much you love me.

128
00:12:41,886 --> 00:12:44,096
You prepared
such a wide selection of invitations.

129
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:45,681
This is what I narrowed down.

130
00:12:45,764 --> 00:12:46,724
He's a busy man.

131
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:48,934
He's not here for a vacation.

132
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:51,812
Don't drag him around for show.

133
00:12:51,896 --> 00:12:53,939
I'm gathering the most prominent families
in the business and political circles

134
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:56,233
to see if any of their daughters
would be suitable for him.

135
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:58,402
Come on, his divorce was just finalized.

136
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:00,362
It's been 374 days.

137
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,780
Is Ha-yeong not home?

138
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,783
How could she not show her face
when her brother has come all this way?

139
00:13:05,367 --> 00:13:06,202
Who knows?

140
00:13:06,952 --> 00:13:09,121
So, how's the funding business going?

141
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,790
We've been focusing on venture capital
for a while,

142
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,501
but now that the size
of our operation funds has grown,

143
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:18,506
we're considering shifting our focus
to mid-sized or listed companies.

144
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:20,299
Looking to swallow up
bigger companies, huh?

145
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:22,551
That won't be easy.

146
00:13:23,469 --> 00:13:25,721
Securing management rights
and restructuring

147
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,431
will be met with a lot of resistance.

148
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:28,599
That's true.

149
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:32,436
But there's more to eat with a bigger fish
as long as you debone it properly.

150
00:13:36,357 --> 00:13:38,943
Ta-da!

151
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:45,032
Aren't you here today
for a meeting about the exhibition?

152
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:46,116
I am,

153
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,619
but do you really think I came
all the way here just for a meeting?

154
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,579
I made all this.

155
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,499
You'll like me even more
once you've tasted it.

156
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:55,501
Listen, Ms. Yu, I--

157
00:13:55,584 --> 00:13:57,795
Okay, I get it, but just try it first.

158
00:14:02,591 --> 00:14:03,759
How is it?

159
00:14:03,842 --> 00:14:04,802
Sure, it's…

160
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:06,762
It's good.

161
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,889
Right? You like me.

162
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:10,641
No, that's not what I meant.

163
00:14:11,392 --> 00:14:13,185
How can a young, capable,
and pretty daughter of a rich family

164
00:14:13,269 --> 00:14:14,728
also be a good cook?

165
00:14:15,854 --> 00:14:19,108
You not falling for me
is a serious problem in itself.

166
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,317
You need to see a doctor.

167
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,489
Anyway, I thought about it.

168
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,741
What if the works in the exhibition

169
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:30,828
reflect more of the children's
daily lives?

170
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:34,832
Ordinary daily life
meets the great outdoors?

171
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,458
That sounds nice.

172
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,793
It reminds you
that protecting the environment

173
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:41,005
isn't some grand undertaking
but a part of everyday life.

174
00:14:42,047 --> 00:14:45,092
Then how about we hire
more relatable models?

175
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:46,844
Could you elaborate?

176
00:14:46,927 --> 00:14:49,930
Instead of using professional models,
you could capture a real family.

177
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:51,724
A real family…

178
00:14:52,433 --> 00:14:54,143
It's the pretty lady!

179
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,270
Jun!

180
00:14:56,812 --> 00:14:58,647
I thought you were
going to the playground.

181
00:14:58,731 --> 00:14:59,899
I hurt myself.

182
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,443
You're all scratched up.

183
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,321
Stay here. I'll go get some ointment.

184
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:11,285
Jun, did you miss me? I missed you.

185
00:15:11,368 --> 00:15:12,745
I missed you.

186
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:15,581
Right? I knew it. Come here.

187
00:15:15,664 --> 00:15:17,583
Try some. I made it.

188
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:21,253
It's so tasty!

189
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:23,130
Don't you like me even more now?

190
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:25,049
I do. A lot more.

191
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,926
You're so much better than your dad.

192
00:15:27,009 --> 00:15:28,302
-Is it good?
-Yes.

193
00:15:28,385 --> 00:15:30,220
All right. Open up.

194
00:15:30,304 --> 00:15:31,597
Look at you eat.

195
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,599
You eat so well. Good boy.

196
00:15:41,649 --> 00:15:43,275
NATURAL BEBE
A GREEN FUTURE WE DREW TOGETHER

197
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:47,112
We'd like to sincerely welcome
all the newlywed couples joining us

198
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:50,699
for Natural BeBe's campaign,
A Green Future We Drew Together.

199
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,002
Twenty years ago,
Natural BeBe built this family park

200
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,548
and planted a lot of trees
as part of our CSR initiative.

201
00:16:07,091 --> 00:16:09,093
The saplings we planted back then

202
00:16:09,176 --> 00:16:12,012
have grown to be trees
that are taller than my children

203
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,764
to create this green forest.

204
00:16:13,847 --> 00:16:15,933
The trees we plant today

205
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,477
will grow big and strong
alongside our children

206
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,396
-to provide fresh air
-The day has finally come.

207
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,106
-for them to breathe.
-I can't believe we really did it.

208
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:25,943
-We, Natural BeBe, will always be with you
-I feel so overwhelmed.

209
00:16:26,026 --> 00:16:27,653
-Da-rim, me too.
-and do our best

210
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,864
-Me too.
-to make that happen.

211
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:31,824
Thank you.

212
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,285
-Are you okay? Oh dear.
-Kang Dae-seong!

213
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:38,122
I told you not to fool around
at Mommy's workplace.

214
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,707
You need to stay right by my side.

215
00:16:40,749 --> 00:16:42,710
Sorry, my husband
is at his weekend part-time job,

216
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,378
so I had no one to watch my youngest.

217
00:16:44,962 --> 00:16:46,296
I'm glad you brought him.

218
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:47,756
Dae-seong.

219
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:49,258
You can play all you want,

220
00:16:49,341 --> 00:16:52,219
but do so where we can see you, okay?

221
00:16:52,302 --> 00:16:53,178
Okay.

222
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:54,888
Excellent. One more!

223
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:56,056
-You're so cute.
-Yes!

224
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,518
-You're just too cute.
-So cute!

225
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:01,186
Thank you.

226
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:06,442
Now, we'll proceed
with the ribbon-cutting ceremony.

227
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:19,830
Here you go.

228
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,832
-You can pick whatever you like.
-Thank you.

229
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:22,958
Please head over there.

230
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,460
-Can we take this?
-Yes, of course.

231
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,712
You can take this
and grab a sapling from over there.

232
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:27,963
Thank you.

233
00:17:29,465 --> 00:17:30,507
Ms. Lee.

234
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,967
SAPLING BAG

235
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,601
My, you're all working so hard.

236
00:17:40,684 --> 00:17:42,644
-Hey!
-Oh my.

237
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,900
The TF team is doing an excellent job.

238
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,777
I look forward to
seeing more from you all.

239
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:52,488
We'll do our very best
to meet your expectations, sir.

240
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:55,741
We solemnly vow to loyally
put our hearts and souls into it.

241
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:56,992
-I vow too.
-I do as well.

242
00:17:57,534 --> 00:17:58,368
That's right.

243
00:17:59,828 --> 00:18:02,790
I know it's hard work,
but please keep it up.

244
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:05,209
Gosh, it's not hard at all.

245
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:08,462
If it's for the company,
we can do more than plant trees.

246
00:18:08,545 --> 00:18:10,714
We can even move that mountain.

247
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,800
-We got this!
-We got this!

248
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,312
All right, keep up the good work.
You got this!

249
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:27,648
-Yes, sir. Thank you, sir!
-Thank you, sir!

250
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,286
What about the manual?

251
00:18:43,872 --> 00:18:45,040
-Why are you following us?
-Pardon?

252
00:18:46,291 --> 00:18:47,543
-I need to get back.
-Where?

253
00:18:47,626 --> 00:18:48,544
Am I planting trees too?

254
00:18:48,627 --> 00:18:50,587
Do I look like
I care about trees right now?

255
00:19:01,598 --> 00:19:02,683
I can carry that for you.

256
00:19:02,766 --> 00:19:03,934
-We're done shoveling.
-No, I'm fine.

257
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,477
It's fine. Let me.

258
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,771
Look at that. They're all doing so well.

259
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,314
I really don't mind.

260
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:10,858
-Let's see.
-Carrying things is my forte.

261
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,651
Yours will be named "Dae-seong Tree."

262
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:14,820
-Right? It's named after you!
-Yeah, that's right.

263
00:19:14,903 --> 00:19:18,240
Once you plant this tree,
it'll grow as big as…

264
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,373
Thank you.

265
00:19:32,546 --> 00:19:33,422
One, two.

266
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:34,339
A bit ahead.

267
00:19:35,257 --> 00:19:37,426
Oh my. Thank you, Mr. Gong.

268
00:19:51,023 --> 00:19:52,274
Damn it.

269
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:08,123
Go on, put it in.

270
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:10,751
Oh, right. Yes.

271
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:17,341
Dae-seong, are you throwing this away?

272
00:20:17,424 --> 00:20:20,469
No. I heard if you plant it in the ground,
it'll grow big and strong.

273
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:22,221
I see.

274
00:20:22,804 --> 00:20:26,975
You want this robot to grow big
so you can ride it around, huh?

275
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:31,146
I got bad news for you, Dae-seong.

276
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,814
I've already claimed this spot

277
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:34,900
because I also want to grow taller.

278
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:39,321
We should ask the doctor
to modify it and make it bigger.

279
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:40,447
What do you think?

280
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:43,700
-Okay!
-All right. Good.

281
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,285
Bye, robot.

282
00:20:47,287 --> 00:20:48,664
What are you doing?

283
00:20:49,414 --> 00:20:52,042
You said you wanted to grow taller.
I was just planting you.

284
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:54,753
I won't be the only one to grow.

285
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,713
You should grow too.

286
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:58,632
-Give me your feet.
-I'm all grown up.

287
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,259
I'm perfectly happy
with my height right now.

288
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:02,469
Come on now. The taller, the better.

289
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:04,012
What are you doing?

290
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,389
Stop it.

291
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:07,933
Let's go for two meters, Mr. Gong!

292
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:11,103
Would you like me to plant you
so you can grow nice and tall?

293
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,105
No, thanks.

294
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:14,606
Okay.

295
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,034
Where did they go?

296
00:21:27,786 --> 00:21:29,037
Darn it.

297
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:43,427
This is so exhausting.

298
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,013
Do you like that? Does that feel good?

299
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,222
Oh, look at you.

300
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,349
You love it, don't you?

301
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:52,311
Ji-hye.

302
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,618
You still haven't quit?

303
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:18,545
I thought you did.

304
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:25,093
I did.

305
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:28,430
But someone made me start again.

306
00:22:29,139 --> 00:22:30,140
I'm to blame?

307
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,186
How did I end up
at your wedding reception?

308
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:36,605
Last Christmas…

309
00:22:39,066 --> 00:22:41,610
we were staying in a suite
at this very hotel.

310
00:22:43,278 --> 00:22:45,614
Your father is to blame for that.

311
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:48,116
He probably ordered you to attend today.

312
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,079
And you're a sweet daughter
who listens to her father's every word.

313
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,709
It's a compliment.

314
00:22:58,585 --> 00:23:00,670
I've always liked that about you.

315
00:23:00,754 --> 00:23:02,839
You work so hard to be
an obedient daughter.

316
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,883
And you know your place.

317
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:08,512
Being his dead lover's secret child…

318
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:12,182
doesn't seem to hinder you one bit.

319
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,605
So that was it?

320
00:23:22,609 --> 00:23:24,277
That's why you kept our relationship
a secret the whole time.

321
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:27,447
Why?

322
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:31,785
Were you worried
I might hinder your future?

323
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:37,207
I'm sorry.

324
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,210
I'm too ambitious to risk
being weighed down by you.

325
00:23:40,877 --> 00:23:42,087
But don't worry.

326
00:23:42,671 --> 00:23:44,256
Your secret is safe with me.

327
00:23:45,048 --> 00:23:47,676
We might not become family,

328
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:50,679
but I hope we can still be friends
who cheer each other on.

329
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,235
I thought you were in the US.

330
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:07,487
I'm here for a short business trip.

331
00:24:08,238 --> 00:24:09,239
And to see you.

332
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,704
I'm sure you heard about my divorce.

333
00:24:18,957 --> 00:24:19,958
I missed you.

334
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:23,753
What do you want?

335
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:25,297
I came to treat you to a meal.

336
00:24:26,715 --> 00:24:28,049
I hear you're a director now.

337
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,177
I'm so proud of you.

338
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:32,012
There's no need to be.

339
00:24:32,888 --> 00:24:34,264
It's all thanks to you.

340
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,475
I learned the hard way
that the only way to stop people

341
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,478
from looking down on me
as the illegitimate child

342
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,480
was to prove my worth
through my abilities.

343
00:24:44,149 --> 00:24:45,650
Do you know why I left you?

344
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,029
You had

345
00:24:49,779 --> 00:24:51,489
an uncanny resemblance to them.

346
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:53,742
Your eyes, to be precise.

347
00:24:57,370 --> 00:24:59,122
On the surface,
you acted like you weren't,

348
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:01,374
but you were always anxious

349
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:03,960
and craved affection.

350
00:25:06,922 --> 00:25:09,925
But I see you've changed a lot
since I last saw you.

351
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:11,801
I can now see

352
00:25:13,261 --> 00:25:14,304
greed in your eyes.

353
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,225
Now that you know, you can leave.

354
00:25:19,392 --> 00:25:21,311
I have no interest in mind games anymore.

355
00:25:33,323 --> 00:25:35,242
GO YEONG-SIK
APRIL 27, 2025

356
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:41,331
There we go.

357
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:48,630
"Go Yeong-sik"?

358
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:52,050
It's my late father's name.

359
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,721
"Yeong" as in "outstanding,"
and "sik" as in "to plant."

360
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:00,141
The perfect name for a tree, right?

361
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:06,231
I hope you grow strong like my father.

362
00:26:08,566 --> 00:26:11,111
All right, let's head back down now!

363
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,362
Thank you for your hard work!

364
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,572
-Could you take a picture of me? Thanks.
-All right.

365
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,783
I guess that's a wrap. Shall we head down?

366
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:18,785
-Shall we?
-Yes.

367
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:22,664
-That came out nice.
-Yeah? Thank you very much.

368
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:23,707
Do you two want one too?

369
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:26,710
Mr. Gong, we should take a group photo.

370
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:29,337
Wait, where did Ms. Bae go?

371
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,047
Nan-suk? She was here just a minute ago.

372
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:33,883
Da-rim, have you seen Dae-seong anywhere?

373
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,844
Didn't you two head down together?

374
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,137
I haven't seen him in a while.

375
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,264
He just disappeared all of a sudden.

376
00:26:39,347 --> 00:26:41,224
Where in the world did he go?

377
00:26:41,308 --> 00:26:42,642
He was just with you.

378
00:26:42,726 --> 00:26:45,228
-Let's split up and look for him.
-Okay.

379
00:26:46,646 --> 00:26:48,189
Dae-seong!

380
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:50,108
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

381
00:26:50,191 --> 00:26:51,609
I'll go this way.

382
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,863
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

383
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,406
-Dae-seong!
-Dae-seong!

384
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:57,615
Dae-seong!

385
00:26:57,699 --> 00:26:58,658
Dae-seong!

386
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:01,328
Dae-seong!

387
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:03,288
Dae-seong!

388
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:05,749
Kang Dae-seong!

389
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,751
-Where did he go?
-Wait for me, Nan-suk.

390
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,461
Dae-seong!

391
00:27:09,544 --> 00:27:11,254
Dae-seong!

392
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:12,172
Dae-seong…

393
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,426
DO NOT ENTER

394
00:27:17,635 --> 00:27:18,845
Dae-seong.

395
00:27:19,637 --> 00:27:20,472
Dae-seong!

396
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:22,474
Dae-seong!

397
00:27:23,266 --> 00:27:24,434
Dae-seong!

398
00:27:26,811 --> 00:27:28,021
Dae-seong!

399
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:29,105
Dae-seong!

400
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:32,400
Dae-seong!

401
00:27:33,777 --> 00:27:36,154
Dae-seong!

402
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:37,405
Dae-seong!

403
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,365
Dae…

404
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:44,788
Dae-seong!

405
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,207
Kang Dae-seong!

406
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,366
A squirrel? Seriously?

407
00:28:21,449 --> 00:28:23,576
Who said you could chase after a squirrel?

408
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,370
I told you to stay close to Mommy!

409
00:28:25,453 --> 00:28:27,539
Do you know how much trouble
you caused everyone here?

410
00:28:27,622 --> 00:28:28,832
I can't believe you!

411
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,500
-Nan-suk, that's enough.
-My goodness.

412
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:31,876
He was scared too.

413
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,628
-We found him. That's what matters.
-I can't believe you.

414
00:28:33,711 --> 00:28:35,797
-Don't worry. It's okay, Dae-seong.
-Why are you crying?

415
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:36,881
MOTHER TF TEAM MEMBER GO DA-RIM

416
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:39,843
Mr. Kang, where's Da-rim and Mr. Gong?

417
00:28:39,926 --> 00:28:42,637
I got in touch with Mr. Gong,
but Ms. Go isn't answering.

418
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,180
It's okay. Your mom was just scared.

419
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:46,266
She was just scared. It's okay.

420
00:28:46,349 --> 00:28:47,183
It's raining.

421
00:28:48,435 --> 00:28:49,477
-Oh no.
-Are you serious?

422
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:51,187
-Oh no. Nan-suk, it's raining.
-Oh no.

423
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,231
-We should head down with Dae-seong first.
-Oh gosh.

424
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:59,487
DO NOT ENTER

425
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:05,994
Hey, I'm on my way.

426
00:29:12,041 --> 00:29:12,876
What?

427
00:29:21,926 --> 00:29:22,927
Da-rim!

428
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:24,846
Da-rim!

429
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:26,556
Da-rim!

430
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:29,768
Da-rim!

431
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:32,729
Da-rim!

432
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:33,813
Da-rim!

433
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:45,283
Da-rim.

434
00:29:51,247 --> 00:29:52,624
Da-rim.

435
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:54,751
Da-rim.

436
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,003
Da-rim.

437
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:01,800
Hold on.

438
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:06,888
-Mr. Gong?
-Are you okay?

439
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,056
Yes.

440
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,186
What about Dae-seong? Did they find him?

441
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,271
He's with Ms. Bae right now.

442
00:30:15,355 --> 00:30:16,481
Thank goodness.

443
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,281
Let's go in there for now.

444
00:30:40,713 --> 00:30:42,090
NATURAL BEBE ASSISTANT MANAGER

445
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,843
Hello, Mr. Kang. How did the event--

446
00:30:46,469 --> 00:30:47,387
What?

447
00:30:49,222 --> 00:30:50,515
Okay, I'll be on my way.

448
00:30:50,598 --> 00:30:51,683
What's wrong?

449
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,434
Da-rim disappeared in the mountains.

450
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,603
Can you watch Jun for a bit?

451
00:30:57,105 --> 00:30:58,773
All right. You should hurry.

452
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,358
Thank you so much.

453
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,279
Drive safely. Don't rush.

454
00:31:08,157 --> 00:31:09,450
Hey, I found her.

455
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:10,493
You did?

456
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:12,078
That's a relief.

457
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,497
-Are you on your way down?
-No.

458
00:31:14,581 --> 00:31:17,333
We're at the bottom of a slope.
We can't really climb up right now.

459
00:31:17,417 --> 00:31:19,168
We managed to find a cave nearby.

460
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:20,169
A cave?

461
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,422
-It's located…
-Ji-hyeok, you're breaking up.

462
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,381
Can you repeat…

463
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:25,091
Hello?

464
00:31:25,174 --> 00:31:26,009
Hel--

465
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,011
Mr. Kang, what did he say?

466
00:31:28,094 --> 00:31:29,888
The call dropped.

467
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:41,900
OUT OF SERVICE AREA

468
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:50,909
They'll be heading over
as soon as the rain stops.

469
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:52,118
Okay.

470
00:31:58,166 --> 00:31:59,167
Hold on.

471
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:06,841
Here.

472
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:08,217
Thank you.

473
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:41,834
You know,

474
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,712
you're just like my dad in some ways.

475
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:47,048
What do you mean?

476
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:48,716
My dad

477
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:52,178
used to be a taxi driver.

478
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,597
Whenever I found myself in trouble,

479
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,016
he appeared out of nowhere.

480
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:59,227
On rainy days,

481
00:33:00,269 --> 00:33:02,689
he'd just suddenly pop out of nowhere
with an umbrella.

482
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,941
If I ever got hurt,

483
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:09,153
I'd suddenly find myself on his back
as he ran to get me help.

484
00:33:09,821 --> 00:33:11,990
It was as if we had telepathy
or something.

485
00:33:14,534 --> 00:33:16,869
And you're like that too.

486
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,207
Even now, you're by my side.

487
00:33:23,418 --> 00:33:25,086
It's really amazing.

488
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,840
You're being looked out for.

489
00:33:29,382 --> 00:33:30,216
Sorry?

490
00:33:34,178 --> 00:33:35,221
As your father,

491
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,182
he must've been looking out for you.

492
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,894
And despite the distance,
the worry remains.

493
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:51,696
Right.

494
00:33:52,697 --> 00:33:54,115
I was so lost

495
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,743
after my dad passed away.

496
00:33:57,785 --> 00:33:59,620
I didn't let it show in front of my mom…

497
00:34:01,622 --> 00:34:04,083
but his absence felt so big to me.

498
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:17,138
Is that why you married young?

499
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:20,516
Because you wanted to

500
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,978
fill the void your dad left?

501
00:34:29,108 --> 00:34:30,234
I'm not sure.

502
00:34:31,527 --> 00:34:33,905
But I guess that's a possibility.

503
00:34:38,493 --> 00:34:39,702
You could've taken it a little slower.

504
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:42,538
What was the rush?

505
00:34:43,873 --> 00:34:44,749
Pardon?

506
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:48,169
It's nothing.

507
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,549
I wonder when this rain will stop.

508
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,888
When can we get back up there?

509
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,848
We'll see if we can in an hour.

510
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:03,142
-What happened?
-Hey, Mr. Kim.

511
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:04,811
Luckily, Mr. Gong found her.

512
00:35:04,894 --> 00:35:06,521
They've taken shelter in a cave.

513
00:35:06,604 --> 00:35:09,816
Once the rain stops, I'm going to head up
with the rescue team.

514
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:13,069
Entry's difficult right now.
We should be able to enter in an hour.

515
00:35:15,196 --> 00:35:16,739
-Mr. Kim!
-Oh no! Mr. Kim!

516
00:35:16,823 --> 00:35:18,533
-Mr. Kim!
-Oh gosh.

517
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:20,368
Oh no. What should we do?

518
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:21,369
Mr. Kim!

519
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:23,204
Da-rim!

520
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:25,832
Go Da-rim!

521
00:35:27,917 --> 00:35:29,043
Da-rim!

522
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:05,329
You must be cold too.

523
00:36:07,123 --> 00:36:08,166
I'm fine.

524
00:36:10,376 --> 00:36:11,627
I'm sorry.

525
00:36:44,535 --> 00:36:46,579
Let's just stay like this
for a little while

526
00:36:47,496 --> 00:36:48,831
and not think about anything.

527
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:42,885
Yes!

528
00:37:47,139 --> 00:37:47,974
Checkmate.

529
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,726
Yes! Come on, baby!

530
00:37:53,145 --> 00:37:54,897
Some challenges are best avoided.

531
00:37:54,981 --> 00:37:57,149
I was a chess prodigy in Hannam-dong
when I was a kid.

532
00:37:57,233 --> 00:37:58,901
How do you become one of those?

533
00:37:59,485 --> 00:38:00,987
-Do you want to know?
-Yes.

534
00:38:01,070 --> 00:38:01,988
It's simple.

535
00:38:02,989 --> 00:38:05,074
Don't study. Just play chess.

536
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,492
I see.

537
00:38:08,995 --> 00:38:10,204
Let's play one more game.

538
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:12,540
No, we've already played too many.

539
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:13,874
You need to sleep now.

540
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,752
Playing with my dad is no fun
because he's so bad.

541
00:38:16,836 --> 00:38:20,047
I'll play one more game
if you tell me something.

542
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,465
What is it?

543
00:38:22,091 --> 00:38:25,177
What does your dad like? Besides you.

544
00:38:25,845 --> 00:38:27,930
-Fried chicken, Americano, and--
-Hold on.

545
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:31,475
Fried chicken, Americano, and?

546
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:32,393
BLACKPINK.

547
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:38,524
Then what does he dislike?

548
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:41,277
When people break promises.

549
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,611
Promises?

550
00:38:42,695 --> 00:38:45,114
If I promise to brush my teeth
after eating snacks and I don't,

551
00:38:45,197 --> 00:38:47,658
or if I promise to clean up my toys
and I don't,

552
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:48,743
he gets really mad.

553
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:51,787
I see.

554
00:38:52,663 --> 00:38:53,581
Breaking promises?

555
00:38:58,169 --> 00:38:59,587
Go Da-rim!

556
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:02,256
Where are you, Da-rim?

557
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,550
Da-rim!

558
00:39:05,301 --> 00:39:06,969
Go Da-rim!

559
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,096
Can you hear me?

560
00:39:12,016 --> 00:39:13,601
Where are you, Da-rim?

561
00:39:25,654 --> 00:39:26,655
Mr. Gong.

562
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:29,408
I think I'm fine…

563
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:33,996
Are you okay?

564
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,665
He's burning up.

565
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,712
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

566
00:39:42,296 --> 00:39:43,881
Oh no. This is all my fault.

567
00:39:43,964 --> 00:39:45,716
You're so hot.

568
00:39:46,258 --> 00:39:47,093
Are you okay?

569
00:39:47,676 --> 00:39:49,762
You need to stay with me.

570
00:39:51,305 --> 00:39:53,015
Are you okay?

571
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:58,604
Can you hear me?

572
00:40:01,232 --> 00:40:02,942
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

573
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:14,578
I'm…

574
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,916
not a good person.

575
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,043
Sorry?

576
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,586
I'm also…

577
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:26,006
swayed.

578
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,385
I think

579
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:32,638
you're a really great person.

580
00:40:34,014 --> 00:40:36,934
You're nice to me
only because I'm a member of your team.

581
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,145
But still…

582
00:40:45,818 --> 00:40:49,071
I find myself being swayed.

583
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,440
Da-rim!

584
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:27,151
Da-rim!

585
00:41:27,234 --> 00:41:28,110
Da…

586
00:41:29,695 --> 00:41:30,821
Da-rim?

587
00:41:30,905 --> 00:41:32,323
Da-rim!

588
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,533
Da-rim! Are you okay?

589
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,660
Are you hurt?

590
00:41:36,744 --> 00:41:38,162
Are you hurt anywhere?

591
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:39,163
No, I'm okay.

592
00:41:45,419 --> 00:41:47,546
I'm fine, but Mr. Gong is…

593
00:41:52,801 --> 00:41:54,762
Let's go. Come on.

594
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:57,014
Okay, let's go.

595
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:57,932
Easy, easy.

596
00:41:58,015 --> 00:41:59,099
Be careful.

597
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:01,852
-Take my hand.
-Okay.

598
00:42:33,175 --> 00:42:34,802
What do you think you're doing?

599
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,235
Ji-hyeok!

600
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,320
They're over here!

601
00:43:09,211 --> 00:43:10,921
-Let's go.
-Okay.

602
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,215
Slowly. Watch your step.

603
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:15,301
Careful.

604
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:19,638
Slowly.

605
00:43:20,764 --> 00:43:21,765
Slowly.

606
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:25,269
Ji-hyeok!

607
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:26,812
Ji-hyeok!

608
00:43:27,354 --> 00:43:28,856
Hey, Ji-hyeok!

609
00:43:28,939 --> 00:43:30,357
They're over here!

610
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:32,985
Are you okay, Ms. Go?

611
00:43:33,694 --> 00:43:35,195
Ji-hyeok!

612
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,196
Ji-hyeok!

613
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:37,906
Are you okay?

614
00:43:40,034 --> 00:43:41,243
Do you know how worried I was?

615
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:42,995
Can I get a towel?

616
00:43:43,704 --> 00:43:44,788
I can't believe this.

617
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,500
Can I get something to cover him up with?

618
00:44:00,512 --> 00:44:01,472
Here.

619
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:06,226
Mr. Kang picked it up.
He found it near where you fell.

620
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,561
Right.

621
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,896
I should thank him.

622
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:12,900
Da-rim.

623
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,443
Yeah?

624
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,696
Why did Mr. Gong do that earlier?

625
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:19,531
Even with me there,
he refused to let go of your hand.

626
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:24,203
Maybe you should quit your job.

627
00:44:25,788 --> 00:44:27,873
Where did that come from?

628
00:44:27,956 --> 00:44:30,959
I'll take care of the hospital bills
and loan interest somehow.

629
00:44:31,043 --> 00:44:32,670
I can ask for an advance
on the photography exhibition.

630
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,421
Why would you do that?

631
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:37,591
What?

632
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,551
Why would you go that far?

633
00:44:40,177 --> 00:44:41,679
I appreciate the thought,

634
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:44,640
but I don't want to lose a friend
because I relied on them for money.

635
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,062
And you're fine with relying on Mr. Gong?

636
00:44:55,984 --> 00:44:56,819
What?

637
00:44:56,902 --> 00:44:59,947
Think about how he paid off your debt
and what he did today.

638
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,907
It looks to me like you and Mr. Gong

639
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,410
are more than just a team leader
and a team member.

640
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:07,246
I definitely think
he has feelings for you.

641
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:08,455
It's nothing like that.

642
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,916
He was delirious because he was sick.

643
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,209
That's why he acted like that.

644
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:13,752
That's why.

645
00:45:14,711 --> 00:45:15,546
Yeah.

646
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:34,064
We should stop by the ER.

647
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:36,692
Your face is so pale right now.

648
00:45:39,361 --> 00:45:40,696
I took medicine for the fever.

649
00:45:41,488 --> 00:45:42,364
I'm fine.

650
00:45:42,448 --> 00:45:43,907
I know, but still.

651
00:45:45,826 --> 00:45:47,327
I just want to go home.

652
00:45:49,121 --> 00:45:50,122
I want to rest.

653
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,124
You're such a family man, Mr. Gong.

654
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,210
You even come to look after your wife.

655
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:39,004
Please, I'm just doing what's right.

656
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:41,715
I wonder if this is even worth
writing an article about.

657
00:46:45,511 --> 00:46:47,095
This is it.

658
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:48,430
Please come in.

659
00:46:50,140 --> 00:46:50,974
Honey.

660
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,152
Did she go out for a walk?

661
00:47:02,736 --> 00:47:04,696
Go and look for her.
The reporter is waiting.

662
00:47:04,780 --> 00:47:06,156
Yes, sir.

663
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,041
Does he have to take it today?

664
00:47:16,124 --> 00:47:17,501
He wants to release the photo of him
caring for his wife

665
00:47:17,584 --> 00:47:19,169
at the same time
as the new product launch.

666
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,130
Jeez, did she really have to hide
and make our lives harder?

667
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,677
-There she is. Over there.
-What?

668
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:35,185
Go that way. Check the stairs.

669
00:47:42,442 --> 00:47:44,778
I'm Chairman Gong's secretary.
His wife is missing from the VIP room.

670
00:47:44,861 --> 00:47:46,280
Did she come this way by any chance?

671
00:47:46,363 --> 00:47:49,116
She was just in her room.
I'm not sure where she is.

672
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,034
We need to find her right now.

673
00:47:51,118 --> 00:47:53,912
Please make an announcement
and contact security.

674
00:47:53,996 --> 00:47:55,372
Okay.

675
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:06,925
Oh my gosh!

676
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:08,552
-I'm sorry.
-Seriously?

677
00:48:09,261 --> 00:48:10,887
-Unbelievable.
-Ma'am, by any chance,

678
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,015
did a woman with crutches come in here?

679
00:48:13,098 --> 00:48:14,600
-She did.
-Where is she?

680
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,351
Right there and there.

681
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,520
I'm the only one here without crutches.

682
00:48:18,604 --> 00:48:19,980
No, not those people.

683
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,857
I wouldn't know about the patients
in the other rooms.

684
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:23,108
I'm sorry.

685
00:48:23,191 --> 00:48:24,526
My goodness.

686
00:48:24,610 --> 00:48:26,361
He scared me half to death.

687
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:30,866
He's gone.

688
00:48:30,949 --> 00:48:31,783
You can come out now.

689
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:33,702
Thank you.

690
00:48:43,253 --> 00:48:45,380
Here. Drink this.

691
00:48:55,641 --> 00:48:57,267
Why were you hiding from him?

692
00:48:59,519 --> 00:49:00,604
Is he a loan shark?

693
00:49:02,689 --> 00:49:03,732
I'm being nosy again.

694
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:05,192
I'm sorry.

695
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,363
Thank you.

696
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:16,203
It's fine.

697
00:49:16,995 --> 00:49:18,413
You're okay now.

698
00:49:19,122 --> 00:49:20,332
You're okay.

699
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,641
Da-rim, how are you feeling?

700
00:49:38,183 --> 00:49:39,893
It's cold medicine.

701
00:49:39,976 --> 00:49:41,603
Dae-seong put you through
so much yesterday.

702
00:49:41,687 --> 00:49:43,313
I feel so terrible.

703
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,816
It's all right. I'm fine.

704
00:49:45,899 --> 00:49:47,609
If I weren't, I wouldn't be at work.

705
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:51,196
You should've taken the day off.
No one would've said anything.

706
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,865
Take the medicine. You might have a cold.

707
00:49:53,949 --> 00:49:57,327
But still, you shouldn't skip payday.

708
00:49:57,411 --> 00:50:00,455
Our paychecks are in!

709
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,832
-Oh my.
-Hurry up and check.

710
00:50:01,915 --> 00:50:04,292
-Really?
-Hurry.

711
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:05,335
This is amazing.

712
00:50:06,044 --> 00:50:07,754
MS. GO DA-RIM'S SALARY ACCOUNT
2,270,000 WON

713
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,426
Da-rim, are you crying?

714
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:14,720
No, I'm not. Why would I be?

715
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:16,638
I'm tearing up.

716
00:50:16,722 --> 00:50:18,306
I'm so touched.

717
00:50:19,391 --> 00:50:21,017
I mean, it'll all be gone later

718
00:50:21,101 --> 00:50:23,437
when I pay the overdue credit card bills
and loan payments,

719
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:26,064
but I'm going to take it all in now
while I still can.

720
00:50:26,148 --> 00:50:26,982
You should.

721
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,442
I'm going to buy myself something.

722
00:50:28,525 --> 00:50:30,318
I worked so hard this past month,

723
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,279
so I deserve a nice treat.

724
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,530
You mean multiple treats.

725
00:50:33,613 --> 00:50:35,073
Just look at all those packages.

726
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:38,368
This time, I'm going to buy this.
Nan-suk, look.

727
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,787
Is that seriously
meant to cover your body?

728
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:43,957
Da-rim, look at this.
It'd look great on you. Buy it.

729
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:45,167
I can't.

730
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,544
I also have a lot of debt to pay off.

731
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,087
You have loans too, huh?

732
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,673
Then again, who doesn't?

733
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,636
They gave us so much.

734
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:18,158
It's the first payment, after all.

735
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,952
Just giving him the money
doesn't feel right.

736
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:42,891
Do you need something?

737
00:51:42,974 --> 00:51:46,061
Oh, it's nothing.

738
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:48,939
Is Mr. Gong not in?

739
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:50,065
He took a sick day.

740
00:51:50,148 --> 00:51:51,274
I think he has a bad cold.

741
00:51:52,275 --> 00:51:53,235
Oh, really?

742
00:51:53,985 --> 00:51:56,238
Is he feeling better now?

743
00:51:56,321 --> 00:51:59,491
He sounded pretty sick
when I called him earlier.

744
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,663
Why do you ask?
Do you need something approved by him?

745
00:52:04,746 --> 00:52:06,665
No, I was just wondering.

746
00:52:20,554 --> 00:52:21,972
So that's what happened.

747
00:52:23,932 --> 00:52:24,891
Goodness me.

748
00:52:25,559 --> 00:52:28,103
How did you manage to endure
all those years?

749
00:52:29,229 --> 00:52:31,189
I didn't endure them.

750
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:34,192
I just gave up.

751
00:52:36,194 --> 00:52:38,280
I was half out of my mind.

752
00:52:38,864 --> 00:52:40,574
I know it's not my place to say this,

753
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:43,910
but you should've left with your son
and divorced your husband.

754
00:52:44,911 --> 00:52:45,954
My parents…

755
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,208
were also relying on my husband.

756
00:52:52,252 --> 00:52:54,588
And the thought of living on my own…

757
00:52:56,882 --> 00:52:58,466
also scared me.

758
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,218
I thought…

759
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:03,305
if I just put up with it,

760
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:06,433
everyone

761
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:08,602
would be happy.

762
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,355
"Happy"?

763
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,859
Do you think

764
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:21,156
your son was truly happy
watching you live like that?

765
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:24,159
Pardon?

766
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,621
They say that parents
are the whole world to their kids.

767
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,789
When a parent falls apart,

768
00:53:30,624 --> 00:53:33,710
the child's whole world crumbles.

769
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,255
He must've been so scared.

770
00:53:38,006 --> 00:53:40,800
We have to become braver

771
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:43,511
and happier

772
00:53:44,304 --> 00:53:45,972
for our children's sake.

773
00:53:47,265 --> 00:53:48,767
That's what I think.

774
00:54:53,623 --> 00:54:55,709
Do you still resent me?

775
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:10,390
It's been over 20 years.

776
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,684
It's time for you to grow up already.

777
00:55:14,644 --> 00:55:15,812
Just because time has passed…

778
00:55:17,689 --> 00:55:19,315
doesn't mean it undoes what you've done.

779
00:55:20,358 --> 00:55:21,860
Are you blind to it all?

780
00:55:21,943 --> 00:55:23,570
My mom has lost her will to live.

781
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:25,655
Your son doesn't believe in love.

782
00:55:26,489 --> 00:55:28,616
Don't you see the family you've destroyed?

783
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,079
It was true love.

784
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:35,206
I was just being true to my feelings.

785
00:55:38,043 --> 00:55:39,919
And people call that an affair.

786
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,255
You know what disgusts me even more?

787
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:44,674
Even after all that,
you hold your head high.

788
00:55:48,261 --> 00:55:50,513
You're talking
as if you're quite different from me.

789
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,308
Then are you saying we're the same?

790
00:55:54,142 --> 00:55:55,685
Are you? How are we the same?

791
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,863
Hey.

792
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:13,078
You want that woman, don't you?

793
00:56:13,161 --> 00:56:14,579
You're dying to have her.

794
00:56:15,580 --> 00:56:18,416
You didn't even try to hide your feelings
in front of her husband.

795
00:56:20,001 --> 00:56:21,002
And you think…

796
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:24,839
you have the right to criticize me?

797
00:56:29,177 --> 00:56:30,678
You and I are the same.

798
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:32,972
Don't you see that?

799
00:57:27,485 --> 00:57:29,446
SEON-U

800
00:58:07,525 --> 00:58:08,943
I'm going to buy some meat on my way home.

801
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:10,278
-Are you?
-What are you having for dinner?

802
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,530
I want to spend some quality time
with my family.

803
00:58:12,614 --> 00:58:13,823
I should ask my kids.

804
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,241
-All right.
-Bye, everyone.

805
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:16,493
-Have a good night.
-Good night.

806
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:17,577
-Get home safely.
-Have a nice evening.

807
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,078
-Good job today.
-See you tomorrow.

808
00:58:22,290 --> 00:58:23,917
Excuse me, Mr. Kang.

809
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:25,001
Yes, Ms. Go?

810
00:58:25,084 --> 00:58:28,087
Can I get Mr. Gong's address?

811
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:29,714
What for?

812
00:58:30,298 --> 00:58:33,092
I can't help but think he got sick
because of me,

813
00:58:33,176 --> 00:58:35,512
so I thought I'd get him some porridge
on my way home.

814
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:40,683
You're so thoughtful.

815
00:58:42,393 --> 00:58:43,353
One second.

816
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:22,850
Did he go out somewhere?

817
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,001
What are you doing here?

818
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:52,797
I heard you were sick,
so I thought I'd bring you this.

819
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,840
It's porridge.

820
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:58,344
If you already had dinner,
you can heat it up and have it later.

821
00:59:58,428 --> 01:00:01,014
-If you put it in the fridge--
-How did you know where I live?

822
01:00:01,598 --> 01:00:04,267
It's incredibly rude
to show up unannounced.

823
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:07,645
I'm sorry.

824
01:00:09,647 --> 01:00:11,816
I didn't call
because I didn't want to disturb you,

825
01:00:11,899 --> 01:00:13,318
but I did send you a text.

826
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,409
I just thought…

827
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:24,912
having someone check in on you
when you're sick

828
01:00:26,456 --> 01:00:30,084
could maybe provide some comfort
and strength.

829
01:00:33,921 --> 01:00:35,089
Does your husband…

830
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:39,052
know you're here?

831
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:45,058
Pardon?

832
01:00:45,141 --> 01:00:47,352
A man lives here alone.

833
01:00:48,853 --> 01:00:51,105
What would people say
if they saw you here?

834
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,609
Don't cross the line.

835
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:00,615
Wait.

836
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:04,077
If you don't want the porridge,
there's also medicine…

837
01:01:05,370 --> 01:01:07,330
and this month's payment in here.

838
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,040
Today was payday.

839
01:01:09,832 --> 01:01:11,292
That's also why

840
01:01:12,043 --> 01:01:15,421
I wanted to see you in person
and thank you.

841
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:17,215
I had no other intentions.

842
01:01:19,801 --> 01:01:20,677
I'm sorry.

843
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,308
I'll get going now.

844
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:52,250
I'm…

845
01:01:52,834 --> 01:01:54,085
not a good person.

846
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,503
Sorry?

847
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:58,548
I'm also swayed.

848
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:05,471
A man lives here alone.

849
01:02:07,014 --> 01:02:08,808
What would people say
if they saw you here?

850
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,268
Don't cross the line.

851
01:03:21,214 --> 01:03:22,131
Ji-hyeok.

852
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:23,758
What are you talking about?

853
01:03:26,552 --> 01:03:27,804
I want to get married

854
01:03:29,305 --> 01:03:30,431
as soon as possible.

855
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:02,922
DYNAMITE KISS

856
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:34,829
What are you doing?
Have you lost your mind?

857
01:04:34,912 --> 01:04:35,913
Is this because of Go Da-rim?

858
01:04:35,997 --> 01:04:36,998
You're the one who's lost your mind.

859
01:04:37,081 --> 01:04:38,541
Why do you make me worry?

860
01:04:38,624 --> 01:04:40,835
You always mess up,
get hurt, and fall ill.

861
01:04:40,918 --> 01:04:42,003
Can't you get your act together?

862
01:04:42,086 --> 01:04:44,797
I told you there was nothing between us.

863
01:04:44,881 --> 01:04:48,259
I just need to work as a team member
with him as the team leader. That's it.

864
01:04:48,342 --> 01:04:50,052
I'm a pro!

865
01:04:50,636 --> 01:04:51,637
It's okay.

866
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,763
It's my job.

867
01:04:52,847 --> 01:04:54,599
You're here to make money,
not to play around.

868
01:04:55,141 --> 01:04:57,226
If something like this ever happens again,

869
01:04:57,310 --> 01:04:59,645
I'll kill you with my own hands.

870
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,023
You don't know anything.
This is just a misunderstanding.

871
01:05:02,106 --> 01:05:03,107
A misunderstanding?

872
01:05:03,190 --> 01:05:05,902
Then tell me. What do I not know?

873
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:10,823
