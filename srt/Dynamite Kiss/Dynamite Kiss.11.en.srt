1
00:00:46,546 --> 00:00:50,967
DYNAMITE KISS

2
00:00:52,177 --> 00:00:53,052
Mr. Gong.

3
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:54,721
Mr. Gong, are you okay?

4
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:56,598
Wake up!

5
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,517
Oh no…

6
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,394
Mr. Gong!

7
00:01:01,478 --> 00:01:02,479
Mr. Gong…

8
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:04,397
Mr. Gong?

9
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:08,151
Are you okay?

10
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:11,237
Can you hear me?

11
00:01:11,988 --> 00:01:12,822
Thank goodness.

12
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:15,241
Do you know how scared I was

13
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,410
that something might've happened to you?

14
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,101
I need to…

15
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,230
tell you something.

16
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,859
There are no particular reasons

17
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,445
as to why I like you.

18
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:56,074
I just like you for who you are.

19
00:01:57,242 --> 00:01:58,701
You're Go Da-rim.

20
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:04,332
That's why I like you.

21
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,797
I love you.

22
00:02:50,962 --> 00:02:53,006
I like you too.

23
00:02:55,466 --> 00:02:57,302
After leaving you in Jeju like that,

24
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,555
I've always missed you

25
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:03,391
and thought about you.

26
00:03:05,435 --> 00:03:06,561
Do you mean it?

27
00:03:09,188 --> 00:03:11,691
It was so hard seeing your face every day

28
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:13,651
while feeling like that.

29
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:19,115
I'm sorry for taking so long
to tell you how I feel.

30
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,868
I…

31
00:03:24,829 --> 00:03:26,080
love you too.

32
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:42,931
Ji-hyeok!

33
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:45,016
Ji-hyeok!

34
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,852
Ji-hyeok, let me see you!

35
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:50,605
Eyes, nose, mouth. They're all there.

36
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:52,523
You're safe now!

37
00:03:52,607 --> 00:03:53,942
I'm fine.

38
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:54,943
Let go of me.

39
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:57,362
- Excuse me, can you check him out?
- Sure.

40
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,405
I told you I'm fine. Jeez.

41
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,157
Please hurry!

42
00:04:02,283 --> 00:04:04,327
- How's your breathing?
- It's fine.

43
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,703
Ji-hyeok, breathe.

44
00:04:08,539 --> 00:04:10,625
Is there anything for him to drink?

45
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:11,751
Do you want some water?

46
00:04:13,711 --> 00:04:15,546
EPISODE 11

47
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,678
I've decided to believe
that you're serious

48
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:24,430
about wanting to help.

49
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,809
Remain calm!

50
00:04:27,892 --> 00:04:29,936
- Don't rush!
- Remain calm!

51
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,437
Don't rush!

52
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,858
- Remain calm!
- Remain calm!

53
00:04:38,861 --> 00:04:39,904
Don't rush.

54
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:43,074
But why are you taking it this far?

55
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:44,534
Is it really just for money?

56
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,037
I detest Ji-hyeok just as much.

57
00:04:49,872 --> 00:04:50,707
Why?

58
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:53,668
Because you lost all the companies
you were trying to acquire

59
00:04:54,252 --> 00:04:55,920
to Ji-hyeok?

60
00:04:58,381 --> 00:04:59,841
So it's just an inferiority complex, huh?

61
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:03,469
No, I respect those who are competent.

62
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,595
But that punk

63
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,598
has such an arrogant look in his eyes.

64
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,558
His eyes?

65
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,435
"I succeeded without my father's help."

66
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,312
"I fought fair and square."

67
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,856
"I'm nothing like you."

68
00:05:15,565 --> 00:05:17,608
There's something oddly dismissive
about his gaze,

69
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:19,319
and it really gets on my nerves.

70
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:23,197
I think I'll only feel better
after I properly crush him.

71
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,450
Acting all lofty

72
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,745
as if he were being guided
by some noble principle.

73
00:05:31,205 --> 00:05:32,373
It <i>is </i>obnoxious.

74
00:05:35,626 --> 00:05:37,086
It's been a while
since we were on the same page.

75
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,635
We're a team now, right?

76
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,981
They found an ID badge

77
00:05:57,065 --> 00:05:59,692
that belonged to a Taeyu C&T
labor union member near the office.

78
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:04,655
I suspect he was one of the workers
who were laid off recently.

79
00:06:04,739 --> 00:06:07,325
Taeyu C&T is infamous
for its labor-management conflicts.

80
00:06:08,618 --> 00:06:11,996
We somehow ended up in the line of fire.

81
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,082
I almost forgot.

82
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:15,958
Ji-hyeok.

83
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,502
About Ms. Go Da-rim…

84
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,505
What are you going to do now?

85
00:06:20,588 --> 00:06:21,589
Make it clear now.

86
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:22,673
What?

87
00:06:27,929 --> 00:06:29,639
Don't tell me you saw it.

88
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:31,641
- I did.
- All of it?

89
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,184
Yes, I saw everything.

90
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:34,727
Well, that was…

91
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,897
Gyeong-min, I think you may have
gotten the wrong idea.

92
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:40,608
- I--
- Wrong idea, my foot.

93
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:43,361
We all saw Ms. Go
run in there to save you.

94
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,655
Who would risk their life

95
00:06:45,738 --> 00:06:49,575
to save their boss from a burning building
in this day and age?

96
00:06:49,659 --> 00:06:51,661
You should know how blessed you are.

97
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:55,581
So stop acting like a jerk
and snapping at her

98
00:06:55,665 --> 00:06:57,375
just because you're the team leader,

99
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:58,543
and be nice to her.

100
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:00,419
She's not just an employee.

101
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:01,879
She's your savior.

102
00:07:01,963 --> 00:07:03,464
- Okay?
- Okay.

103
00:07:04,674 --> 00:07:06,008
Eat your porridge.

104
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:07,927
Thank you for the porridge.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:09,762
- Wow, what is all this?
- Eat up.

106
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,654
No, you can't!

107
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:29,365
Life may be tough,
but this isn't the answer.

108
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:31,200
What the heck? Who are you?

109
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,618
Let go of me!

110
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,383
Let's do that again.

111
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:52,680
Do you know how worried I was?

112
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:54,891
I didn't know if you were being chased

113
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:56,350
or had gotten into some sort of accident.

114
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,436
Do you know how hard I searched for you?

115
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:00,021
I know.

116
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,231
You're nice to me

117
00:08:04,066 --> 00:08:07,153
only because I'm a member of your team.

118
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,030
But still,

119
00:08:10,448 --> 00:08:11,908
I find myself

120
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,910
being swayed.

121
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:15,411
I'm…

122
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,205
not a good person.

123
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:18,623
Sorry?

124
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:20,124
I'm also…

125
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:23,586
swayed.

126
00:08:25,254 --> 00:08:26,339
<i>Stay with me.</i>

127
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:27,840
Don't go.

128
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:29,967
I don't want you to go.

129
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,846
There are no particular reasons

130
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,474
as to why I like you.

131
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:39,852
I just like you for who you are.

132
00:08:40,478 --> 00:08:41,979
You're Go Da-rim.

133
00:08:46,359 --> 00:08:47,610
That's why I like you.

134
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,196
I love you.

135
00:09:01,165 --> 00:09:02,250
This is insane.

136
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,825
Let's see.

137
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:21,495
It doesn't suit me.

138
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,289
Yeah.

139
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:27,877
This doesn't suit me either.

140
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,794
Yes?

141
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:33,591
I'm screwed.

142
00:10:33,674 --> 00:10:35,593
I'm so screwed.

143
00:10:38,888 --> 00:10:41,223
Today must be an important day.

144
00:10:41,307 --> 00:10:44,769
I just thought it was a shame
that all these clothes

145
00:10:44,852 --> 00:10:47,521
in my sister's wardrobe
were just gathering dust.

146
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,856
I see.

147
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:52,026
Would you like me to pick something out?

148
00:10:52,109 --> 00:10:52,943
Sure.

149
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,036
Not this.

150
00:11:07,583 --> 00:11:08,626
How about this?

151
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:10,127
I think that looks nice.

152
00:11:10,211 --> 00:11:11,045
You think so?

153
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:12,713
Don't you think it's a bit too short?

154
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:14,965
I thought something simple
would be better.

155
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:16,759
You think so?

156
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:21,055
I suppose this is something
Ji-hyeok would like.

157
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:26,268
Goodness, what do I know?

158
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:28,771
I should just trust your judgment.

159
00:12:02,596 --> 00:12:04,598
- Good morning, Mr. Gong.
- There he is.

160
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,350
- Mr. Gong.
- Good morning, Mr. Gong.

161
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:08,060
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

162
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:15,484
NATURAL BEBE

163
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:17,570
Isn't Mr. Gong so handsome?

164
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,531
I wish I could join the TF team.

165
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,575
I'd get to see that face every day.

166
00:12:22,658 --> 00:12:24,368
He really is a feast for the eyes.

167
00:12:24,452 --> 00:12:25,744
I'm so jealous.

168
00:12:26,787 --> 00:12:28,747
I want to join the TF team too.

169
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:02,072
Hold on.

170
00:13:05,576 --> 00:13:07,286
You caught me off guard.

171
00:13:07,369 --> 00:13:09,163
We need to be careful at work.

172
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:10,581
Be careful?

173
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:11,957
About what?

174
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,293
There were so many people in the elevator.

175
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,378
You can't just hold my hand like that.

176
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:17,338
Your hand?

177
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,507
I don't know what you're talking about.

178
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:34,355
I couldn't help myself

179
00:13:35,648 --> 00:13:37,274
because you're so pretty.

180
00:13:56,293 --> 00:13:58,295
Oh my goodness!

181
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:01,131
- My gosh, they're so pretty!
- They are!

182
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:04,051
- They're beautiful.
- I can't believe it.

183
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,636
Seriously, this is incredible.

184
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,222
- My goodness.
- Just look at that note.

185
00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,724
"To my precious four-leaf clover."

186
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:13,811
"Thank you.
I promise to only make you happier."

187
00:14:14,436 --> 00:14:16,230
He's so cool.

188
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:19,900
Mr. Kim Seon-u is such a romantic.

189
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,736
Someone might think
you two just started dating.

190
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:26,824
He must've sent it to cheer you up,
considering how the exhibition wrapped up.

191
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,536
I'd be happy if my husband
did a quarter of what he does.

192
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,787
In your dreams.

193
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:34,665
A husband like Mr. Kim
is rarer than winning the lottery.

194
00:14:34,748 --> 00:14:37,793
He's handsome, talented, and doting.

195
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:42,006
Only someone as lucky and blessed
as Da-rim could land a guy like him.

196
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:43,924
Now, now.

197
00:14:44,008 --> 00:14:45,092
You're still on the clock.

198
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,678
Let's get back to work.

199
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:48,888
Please.

200
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,389
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

201
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:52,725
He's such a killjoy.

202
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:53,976
Gosh, they're so pretty.

203
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:58,981
Come in.

204
00:15:01,191 --> 00:15:02,067
Thank you

205
00:15:02,985 --> 00:15:03,986
for the flowers.

206
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:06,947
You didn't have to send me flowers.

207
00:15:07,698 --> 00:15:09,825
Thank goodness no one else caught on.

208
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:10,993
Gosh.

209
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:13,829
Even if no one else caught on,

210
00:15:14,788 --> 00:15:17,166
I sent them so you can take note.

211
00:15:17,249 --> 00:15:18,167
Of what?

212
00:15:21,503 --> 00:15:22,796
That today is day one of our relationship.

213
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:30,638
Gosh, you're too much.

214
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,892
I think they all left to buy something.

215
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:42,733
I need to head out soon.

216
00:15:43,317 --> 00:15:45,653
I don't think I'll see you
for the rest of the day.

217
00:15:45,736 --> 00:15:47,655
Well, it can't be helped.

218
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,537
You can't do it here.

219
00:15:58,916 --> 00:15:59,792
Not here…

220
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,836
We have so much to do.

221
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:03,796
I know.

222
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,089
Oh no. They're back. What should we do?

223
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:06,757
Hold on. Maybe I should…

224
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,716
Did you reach out?

225
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,093
- Ms. Go Da-rim!
- Oh my.

226
00:16:10,177 --> 00:16:11,303
Do you call this work?

227
00:16:12,262 --> 00:16:13,180
I'm sorry.

228
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:15,349
- I'm really sorry, sir.
- Poor Da-rim.

229
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,768
What set him off this time?
He's such a jerk.

230
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:19,520
Oh no.

231
00:16:19,603 --> 00:16:20,604
Are you free this weekend?

232
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,399
Yes, I am. Why do you ask?

233
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,400
Let's go on a date.

234
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:27,027
Is there anything you want to eat?

235
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,237
We can go get something to eat.

236
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,446
A movie sounds good too.

237
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,406
Or maybe even a trip.

238
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:34,368
It's not like Da-rim started the fire.
We're also upset about it.

239
00:16:34,451 --> 00:16:35,619
He's just taking it too far.

240
00:16:35,703 --> 00:16:37,454
I've had enough of it.
I need to get in there.

241
00:16:38,497 --> 00:16:40,207
You'll only make things worse now.

242
00:16:40,290 --> 00:16:42,292
I'll go and talk to him in a bit.

243
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,295
Come here. Quickly.

244
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,965
- Should I go now?
- What's he doing?

245
00:16:48,048 --> 00:16:50,009
What is it? What's he doing?

246
00:16:50,092 --> 00:16:51,301
Overnight is even better.

247
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,511
Overnight?

248
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,471
Isn't that a bit too soon?

249
00:16:55,556 --> 00:16:56,640
Don't you remember what happened in Jeju?

250
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:57,766
We were totally--

251
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,810
All right, okay. I hear you.

252
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:01,645
I'll think about it.

253
00:17:01,729 --> 00:17:02,813
Just trust me and follow my lead!

254
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:04,440
- Oh my goodness.
- Oh dear.

255
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:06,233
- Get in there and stop him.
- Go stop him.

256
00:17:06,316 --> 00:17:07,568
Should I get in there now?

257
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:09,111
Something serious is about to happen.

258
00:17:11,739 --> 00:17:15,701
Unfortunately,
the fire is the issue in the spotlight

259
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,578
instead of the exhibition.

260
00:17:18,245 --> 00:17:22,249
"How could an environmental campaign
ignore fire safety?"

261
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,501
"You might as well just drop everything."

262
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,670
Such snide reactions have been prevalent.

263
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:28,547
How could you handle the situation
so unprofessionally?

264
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:29,840
Sir.

265
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,676
Mr. Gong was also in danger that day.

266
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:34,803
For now,

267
00:17:34,887 --> 00:17:37,306
Taeyu C&T has agreed
to announce that the culprit

268
00:17:37,389 --> 00:17:39,892
was one of its former labor union members,
not any mismanagement on our part--

269
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,227
A little late for that, don't you think?

270
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,605
Has that person been apprehended?

271
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:46,398
Well, not yet.

272
00:17:46,482 --> 00:17:48,650
Then a laborer being the culprit
is still only speculation.

273
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,027
Nothing has been confirmed.

274
00:17:50,819 --> 00:17:52,237
A further investigation has to be--

275
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:54,031
No, just leave it be.

276
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,657
They agreed to take the fall.

277
00:17:56,241 --> 00:17:58,494
Let's conclude today's meeting here.

278
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,333
How are you feeling?

279
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:07,127
- Better?
- Yeah.

280
00:18:07,836 --> 00:18:08,879
Thanks for your concern.

281
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,380
I didn't do anything.

282
00:18:11,757 --> 00:18:13,467
You should be thanking Ms. Go.

283
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:15,469
I heard she risked her life to save you.

284
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,014
You two must be close.

285
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,891
Just like any team leader and member.

286
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:22,601
I'm envious.

287
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,896
It must be nice to have
a team member like that.

288
00:18:30,067 --> 00:18:30,901
All right then.

289
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:33,320
Take care of yourself.

290
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,465
Hey.

291
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,342
Hey. Do you have what I asked for?

292
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:56,343
Yeah.

293
00:18:56,426 --> 00:18:57,719
These are all the CCTV footage

294
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,638
from inside and outside
the art hall for the past week.

295
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,308
Thanks.

296
00:19:03,392 --> 00:19:05,519
You're right. It's a bit suspicious.

297
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:09,857
If he managed to reach the office
without being caught on the CCTVs,

298
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,442
that means he knew the layout
of the art hall well.

299
00:19:12,526 --> 00:19:14,319
I'm sure
he scoped the place out beforehand.

300
00:19:15,988 --> 00:19:17,322
Then he must be in here somewhere.

301
00:19:19,491 --> 00:19:21,034
Are you going to watch
a whole week's worth of footage?

302
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,328
There's going to be
a ton of people on there.

303
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,413
Will you even recognize him?

304
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:35,883
I definitely remember his eyes.

305
00:19:48,729 --> 00:19:51,857
You must be upset about the exhibition
ending in such a way.

306
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,610
It's fine.
I'm just thankful no one got hurt.

307
00:19:56,445 --> 00:19:57,487
How's Mr. Gong?

308
00:19:58,363 --> 00:19:59,198
Is he all right?

309
00:19:59,948 --> 00:20:02,451
Yeah, he says he's fine.

310
00:20:24,598 --> 00:20:26,725
Listen, Seon-u.

311
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:29,645
About what you told me last time--

312
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,148
I just remembered
I have an urgent project to finish up.

313
00:20:33,815 --> 00:20:35,817
I need to send it over
by tomorrow morning.

314
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,362
Sorry, Da-rim. Let's talk later.

315
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:39,404
Right, okay.

316
00:20:39,488 --> 00:20:41,073
Of course, work comes first.

317
00:20:41,156 --> 00:20:42,491
I can clean this up later.

318
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,953
All right then.

319
00:20:46,036 --> 00:20:47,496
I'll get going.

320
00:20:47,579 --> 00:20:48,997
- Bye.
- Bye.

321
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,959
This looks delicious.

322
00:21:41,466 --> 00:21:42,467
It's so good.

323
00:21:43,719 --> 00:21:45,178
The egg is so soft.

324
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:47,764
Hold on.

325
00:21:48,515 --> 00:21:49,641
Who's softer?

326
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,643
The egg or me?

327
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:53,645
Are you serious?

328
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:56,106
Answer me.

329
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,024
The egg or me?

330
00:21:57,774 --> 00:21:58,859
Of course…

331
00:21:59,484 --> 00:22:00,402
it's the egg.

332
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,488
I wouldn't call you the soft type.

333
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,615
Then what am I?

334
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,785
You're…

335
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:13,040
a bit more

336
00:22:13,832 --> 00:22:14,708
of the sexy type.

337
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,294
I guess.

338
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,921
So that's what I am.

339
00:22:21,131 --> 00:22:22,924
Okay. Eat up.

340
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,428
You know,

341
00:22:27,179 --> 00:22:29,181
it's so nice to be able to
go on lunch dates like this.

342
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,224
I think office romances are great.

343
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,560
- Are you enjoying it?
- Yeah.

344
00:22:33,643 --> 00:22:35,020
When I start my own company,

345
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,315
I'm going to make office romances
a requirement for all employees.

346
00:22:38,398 --> 00:22:39,232
What?

347
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,986
When I woke up this morning,

348
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:46,364
I was so excited to go to work.

349
00:22:50,535 --> 00:22:54,039
If every employee were as eager
to get to work as I am,

350
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:56,458
just imagine how productive they'd be.

351
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:59,544
Do that at your own company.

352
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:02,297
What if someone from the office sees us?

353
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,758
Do you know how anxious I am?

354
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,842
That's why

355
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:09,221
I chose a place far away from the office.
So smart, right?

356
00:23:11,014 --> 00:23:11,890
Yes.

357
00:23:15,102 --> 00:23:16,603
Thank you for lunch.

358
00:23:16,686 --> 00:23:18,480
I'll be sure to treat you next time.

359
00:23:20,065 --> 00:23:21,399
Should we take a walk before heading back?

360
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:22,859
Sure, why not?

361
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,911
Come on.

362
00:23:32,994 --> 00:23:35,330
What if someone sees us?

363
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:37,207
But what can I do?
I like you so much, it's killing me.

364
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,211
- I mean, I guess we can't let you die.
- Come on. It'll be fine.

365
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:43,505
I made sure no one we know is around.

366
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,263
Such nice weather today.

367
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,473
- No, Nan-suk.
- No.

368
00:23:53,557 --> 00:23:55,183
Did we have to come this far for lunch?

369
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,227
Trust me. It's a really good place.

370
00:24:01,064 --> 00:24:03,275
- Most sandwiches are so small.
- What's going on?

371
00:24:03,358 --> 00:24:05,360
I hate thin sandwiches.
Sandwiches need to be thick.

372
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,528
- They do?
- Damn it.

373
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,780
- Really?
- That won't be filling.

374
00:24:08,864 --> 00:24:09,823
Isn't that Ms. Go?

375
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:12,450
Hello, everyone!

376
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,788
Didn't you say you were meeting a friend?

377
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:20,584
Oh, they had something urgent come up.

378
00:24:21,209 --> 00:24:22,169
Something urgent?

379
00:24:28,133 --> 00:24:29,885
Just a second. Please.

380
00:24:29,968 --> 00:24:31,469
You were stood up.

381
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:33,847
Oh no, that's too bad.

382
00:24:36,391 --> 00:24:38,476
Did you have lunch already?

383
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:41,438
There's this new sandwich place nearby.

384
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,064
- That's where we're headed.
- Really?

385
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,109
You have to go this way to get there.

386
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,485
- What?
- I think it's this way.

387
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:49,362
There's a sinkhole over there.

388
00:25:21,102 --> 00:25:21,937
Come in.

389
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,735
Mr. Gong.

390
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,489
Would you like to have dinner
at my place tonight?

391
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:35,867
Our mothers made dumplings,
and they wanted you to come over.

392
00:25:36,743 --> 00:25:38,620
I don't think I can today.

393
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:40,080
Why not?

394
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,873
I'm on a treasure hunt.

395
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,420
I never knew there was a place like this
in the company.

396
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,674
I only know about it
because the CSR team leader told me.

397
00:25:53,176 --> 00:25:55,637
By the way, you don't need to help me.

398
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,722
You can't go through all this by yourself.

399
00:25:57,806 --> 00:25:59,849
Not to mention, you have to find it
without getting caught.

400
00:26:00,475 --> 00:26:02,102
So of course, I'm going to help you.

401
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,147
Who's there?

402
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:23,123
Oh, there's no one.

403
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,925
- He hasn't left yet.
- Really?

404
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,262
What are you doing?

405
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,847
Hold on, he's still there. Be quiet.

406
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:39,848
Okay.

407
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:45,729
Oh, come on. What are you doing?

408
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:54,821
The more I learn about your mother,
the more amazing she is.

409
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,448
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR KIM IN-AE
LEADS THE TREE-PLANTING CAMPAIGN

410
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,699
I'm sure

411
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:01,077
prioritizing the company's
social responsibilities

412
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,663
couldn't have been easy back then.

413
00:27:04,372 --> 00:27:05,373
My mom

414
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,418
wasn't looking to just sell baby products.

415
00:27:10,253 --> 00:27:12,922
She wanted to create a world
that ensured children's happiness.

416
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,678
It looks like that led to
a lot of conflict with the board members.

417
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:21,222
She's a total warrior.

418
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:24,059
It looks that way.

419
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:28,438
MANAGEMENT MEETING MINUTES

420
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,279
I always thought of my mom

421
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,616
as someone weak I needed to protect.

422
00:27:43,578 --> 00:27:45,455
She's incredibly strong.

423
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,291
She's even fighting now.

424
00:27:50,668 --> 00:27:51,586
So,

425
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:57,300
I hope you don't try to shoulder
all of this on your own anymore.

426
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,766
Your mother told me

427
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:08,269
about your childhood.

428
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,109
Why did she waste your time like that?

429
00:28:14,192 --> 00:28:15,985
It wasn't a waste of time.

430
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:18,780
Thanks to her, all my questions about you

431
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:20,782
were answered.

432
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:22,951
What questions did you have?

433
00:28:24,786 --> 00:28:25,995
You could've asked me.

434
00:28:31,876 --> 00:28:33,711
I wondered why someone

435
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:36,673
who has everything and more

436
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,176
sometimes had a wounded look in his eyes.

437
00:28:40,969 --> 00:28:43,763
I wondered why someone who's more mature
and reliable than anyone

438
00:28:45,056 --> 00:28:46,349
sometimes…

439
00:28:48,351 --> 00:28:50,979
looked like a lost child.

440
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,648
I thought about…

441
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:58,737
how scared and tough
it must've been for that child.

442
00:29:06,619 --> 00:29:07,787
You must've been…

443
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,417
really lonely.

444
00:29:14,502 --> 00:29:15,378
It's okay.

445
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,047
You're okay.

446
00:29:20,467 --> 00:29:21,926
You're not alone anymore.

447
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,182
I'll always be by your side.

448
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:30,643
From now on until forever.

449
00:29:44,491 --> 00:29:46,284
I'll be here to hold you,

450
00:29:46,826 --> 00:29:48,369
adore you,

451
00:29:49,704 --> 00:29:51,039
and protect you.

452
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,418
And…

453
00:29:57,086 --> 00:29:58,588
we're going to tackle all of it together.

454
00:30:00,089 --> 00:30:00,924
The hard stuff,

455
00:30:01,966 --> 00:30:03,009
the scary stuff,

456
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:04,844
and the loneliness.

457
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:06,679
All of it.

458
00:30:14,729 --> 00:30:15,688
Thank you.

459
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:35,083
Goodness.

460
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,310
Mr. Kim?

461
00:30:54,394 --> 00:30:56,396
- Oh, hello.
- Hello.

462
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:59,148
Did you go grocery shopping
on your way home?

463
00:30:59,732 --> 00:31:01,234
- Yes.
- Where's Da-rim?

464
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,027
She should be at home.

465
00:31:03,695 --> 00:31:04,529
By any chance,

466
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:08,199
did you and Da-rim
receive some good news recently?

467
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:10,159
Are you two expecting again?

468
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,078
Not at all.

469
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:16,124
No? Then why did you send
that giant flower basket to the office?

470
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,167
"To my precious four-leaf clover."

471
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,295
"I promise to only make you happier."
My gosh!

472
00:31:21,087 --> 00:31:23,131
It made everyone in the office go crazy!

473
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:24,340
I almost fainted.

474
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:26,509
Da-rim was ecstatic too.

475
00:31:27,343 --> 00:31:29,971
I'm glad she liked it.

476
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:37,061
Seon-u.

477
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,569
Hey.

478
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,462
Did you pick up groceries?

479
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:04,297
Yeah.

480
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,674
Jun wanted bulgogi for dinner.

481
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:08,384
I see.

482
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:20,355
Seon-u.

483
00:32:22,941 --> 00:32:25,652
I have something to tell you.

484
00:32:25,735 --> 00:32:27,654
- Da-rim.
- Yeah?

485
00:32:27,737 --> 00:32:29,238
Let me speak first.

486
00:32:30,031 --> 00:32:30,865
Okay.

487
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:37,580
Remember when I told you that I liked you?

488
00:32:40,124 --> 00:32:40,959
Yeah?

489
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:49,467
Messing with you is not fun at all.

490
00:32:50,885 --> 00:32:51,719
What do you mean?

491
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,889
It felt like I was the only one losing out
from this whole married couple charade.

492
00:32:54,973 --> 00:32:58,226
I thought it was unfair, so I wanted to
mess with you by saying I liked you,

493
00:32:58,309 --> 00:32:59,352
but I can't do this anymore.

494
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:01,771
It's making my skin crawl.

495
00:33:02,355 --> 00:33:03,731
You were messing with me

496
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:06,025
when you said you had feelings for me?

497
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:08,486
Yeah, I was.

498
00:33:09,570 --> 00:33:10,488
What?

499
00:33:11,239 --> 00:33:12,407
Wait.

500
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,326
That stroked your ego, didn't it?

501
00:33:17,328 --> 00:33:19,122
I can't just stand by and let that happen.

502
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:22,417
I mean, even if it's just a joke,

503
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:25,586
some lines shouldn't be crossed.

504
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:27,213
Are you kidding me?

505
00:33:27,296 --> 00:33:28,172
Hey.

506
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:30,508
That hurts.

507
00:33:30,591 --> 00:33:31,426
Hey,

508
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:35,763
do you know how worried I was
about hurting your feelings?

509
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:37,640
You're my only friend.

510
00:33:37,724 --> 00:33:41,269
Do you even know
how terrified I was of losing you?

511
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:46,315
Why would you be scared?

512
00:33:47,483 --> 00:33:48,985
You're stronger than me.

513
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,987
Come here. You're dead meat.

514
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:53,531
- Wait. Stop.
- Do you know what you put me through?

515
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:56,075
- Hold on a second.
- I should beat you up right now!

516
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:58,661
- You'd better stop right there!
- Come on, it was just a joke.

517
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:02,957
<i>No, you're looking down too much.</i>

518
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,459
Look up.

519
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:05,418
Too much.

520
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:06,627
Just a bit. There you go.

521
00:34:06,711 --> 00:34:08,713
You have no energy right now.

522
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:10,089
You need to be more upbeat.

523
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,215
Lift that spirit.

524
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,884
The expression is crucial.

525
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,511
You want to look poised, chic, and lovely.

526
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:17,680
There you go.

527
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,516
No. Your head is tilted. Straighten it.

528
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,477
Maintain posture. Up.

529
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,270
Did Father leave already?

530
00:34:24,353 --> 00:34:25,646
Yeah.

531
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:30,318
He has a lot to deal with
after the fire reignited union issues.

532
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:32,403
I can't face our in-laws.

533
00:34:33,362 --> 00:34:34,363
Did Ji-hyeok say anything?

534
00:34:34,447 --> 00:34:37,909
He just wants to find the culprit
as soon as possible.

535
00:34:37,992 --> 00:34:40,661
It's not even a big deal.
We should just move on.

536
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:42,038
What do you mean it's not a big deal?

537
00:34:42,121 --> 00:34:43,748
I worked really hard on that exhibition.

538
00:34:44,749 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm sure this was a malicious attack
meant to sabotage me.

539
00:34:50,546 --> 00:34:52,340
Hey, snap out of it.

540
00:34:52,423 --> 00:34:53,800
Who'd start a fire to sabotage you?

541
00:34:53,883 --> 00:34:56,511
Don't say that.
She's made substantial progress.

542
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:58,262
The visitors in the morning

543
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:01,307
and the VIPs who received the pamphlets
are very interested in purchasing.

544
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:03,643
Really? Is that true?

545
00:35:03,726 --> 00:35:05,436
He's quite good
for a no-name photographer.

546
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:08,981
You have a good eye for things,
just like me.

547
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:11,901
Prepare for a second showing
after the restoration.

548
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,946
Thanks, Mom! I promise to do my best.

549
00:35:15,029 --> 00:35:16,823
Great, let's keep up that lively spirit.
Head up!

550
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,748
What's with the long face?

551
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:27,208
This is good news.

552
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:29,043
Aren't you excited?

553
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,044
Sure.

554
00:35:31,003 --> 00:35:31,879
I'm glad to hear it.

555
00:35:34,549 --> 00:35:37,343
I hurriedly came here to tell you
before telling Ji-hyeok.

556
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:44,725
Come here.

557
00:35:47,603 --> 00:35:48,521
What are you doing?

558
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:50,022
Consoling you.

559
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,859
What's with the random consolation?

560
00:35:53,568 --> 00:35:54,861
Just be quiet.

561
00:35:54,944 --> 00:35:58,364
It's obvious
you're in desperate need of some.

562
00:36:02,201 --> 00:36:03,578
Ms. Go rejected you, didn't she?

563
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:07,290
How did you know?

564
00:36:09,292 --> 00:36:11,252
It's only going to get harder from now on.

565
00:36:11,335 --> 00:36:13,921
You have to pretend like you're fine,
as if nothing happened.

566
00:36:15,214 --> 00:36:18,301
It's heartbreaking
when you put on a brave face,

567
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,303
but it goes unrecognized.

568
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,433
But you should be thankful.

569
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:26,726
You have a woman of my stature

570
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:29,020
patiently waiting for you.

571
00:36:30,521 --> 00:36:32,106
This is just too unfair for me.

572
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:35,109
Go and get me some coffee or something.

573
00:36:35,193 --> 00:36:36,736
I refuse to leave with nothing today.

574
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:39,030
Go on.

575
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:47,538
<i>The Green Forest Campaign</i>

576
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:49,790
can be taken off your hands now, Ji-hyeok.

577
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:52,168
- The marketing team will take over.
- Pardon?

578
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:53,920
As in my team, sir?

579
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:56,380
This campaign is a long-term project.

580
00:36:56,464 --> 00:36:59,592
To maintain strategic direction
and established partnerships,

581
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:02,011
it'd be best for my team to continue--

582
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:04,388
That's exactly why he wants
another team to take over.

583
00:37:04,972 --> 00:37:07,016
The Mother TF Team
is made up of fixed-term interns.

584
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,019
Even if some become full-time,
it'll be difficult to keep the team.

585
00:37:10,770 --> 00:37:12,230
To keep the campaign going,

586
00:37:12,313 --> 00:37:14,440
shouldn't we have
a permanent team dedicated to it?

587
00:37:14,523 --> 00:37:16,108
You don't need to worry about that.

588
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,820
If you entrust it to me,
I promise to give it my all.

589
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:22,657
Then how about

590
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:25,034
sending the Mother TF Team
to support the CS team?

591
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:27,328
- The CS team?
- Yes.

592
00:37:27,411 --> 00:37:29,914
They can listen to customers' needs
and requests firsthand

593
00:37:29,997 --> 00:37:31,374
and utilize that knowledge

594
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:34,001
in product development.

595
00:37:34,835 --> 00:37:38,422
I believe that'll benefit
Mr. Gong in the end as well.

596
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:39,674
Sure. Sounds good.

597
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:48,224
How did you ever think of that?

598
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:51,394
The CS team has the highest turnover rate
in the company.

599
00:37:51,477 --> 00:37:54,105
I wonder if those stay-at-home moms
will even survive ten days there.

600
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,857
Have the CS team transfer over

601
00:37:57,775 --> 00:38:00,569
the most problematic
blacklisted customer cases

602
00:38:01,237 --> 00:38:02,989
to the Mother TF Team.

603
00:38:04,949 --> 00:38:07,201
I'm going to get rid of the whole team.

604
00:38:09,036 --> 00:38:12,331
PROVIDING WORDS OF EMPATHY
THAT RESONATE WITH CUSTOMERS!

605
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,333
HEARING OUT THE CUSTOMERS
TO RESPOND WITH EMPATHY!

606
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,924
What a fun way to put it.

607
00:38:22,591 --> 00:38:24,593
What can I help you with today?

608
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,804
SERVICE LEVEL: 91%
RESPONSE RATE: 97%

609
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:27,847
CALLS IN PROGRESS: 45

610
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:28,764
Dry cleaning?

611
00:38:29,348 --> 00:38:31,183
Yes, I can submit the request, but…

612
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:33,227
I understand you're an influencer,

613
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,980
but a refund request
for ten times the original amount…

614
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,356
I'm sorry.

615
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,484
Ma'am, I actually own
that same luxury bag.

616
00:38:40,568 --> 00:38:41,777
It's not that expensive--

617
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,709
Are we sure we're still in Korea?

618
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,962
I'm speaking Korean,
but they don't understand me.

619
00:39:00,046 --> 00:39:04,216
Damn that influencer,
influenza, or whatever.

620
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,344
I mean, I can curse too.

621
00:39:06,427 --> 00:39:08,012
Unbelievable.

622
00:39:08,095 --> 00:39:09,096
I need a drink.

623
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:10,639
What are you doing?

624
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,016
Relieving stress.

625
00:39:12,099 --> 00:39:14,352
I'm going to buy everything in my cart.

626
00:39:14,435 --> 00:39:15,353
Are you nuts?

627
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,521
Are you going to blow a month's pay
after working half a day?

628
00:39:17,605 --> 00:39:21,275
Doing this is the only thing
keeping me from a breakdown.

629
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,320
Wait, where did Go-eun go?

630
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:27,990
One of the customers earlier

631
00:39:28,574 --> 00:39:30,785
said that there was no way
I could be a decent mom.

632
00:39:30,868 --> 00:39:32,661
Who the hell said that?

633
00:39:32,745 --> 00:39:34,705
Don't listen to people like that.

634
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,540
Why would you cry

635
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:39,418
over someone like that?

636
00:39:40,544 --> 00:39:41,545
I know I shouldn't.

637
00:39:43,798 --> 00:39:45,925
I do, but it was still so upsetting.

638
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,009
Look at me.

639
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:49,053
Ms. Lee,

640
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:51,347
you're a great mother.

641
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,100
I can guarantee you that.

642
00:39:54,183 --> 00:39:55,518
Thank you.

643
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,113
The chairman is here.
Please prepare some tea.

644
00:40:07,196 --> 00:40:08,114
Okay.

645
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:18,749
I'd love to see my daughter-in-law
more frequently.

646
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:20,126
I'll visit more often, Father.

647
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:23,421
And I'm sorry for causing you distress
for what happened last time.

648
00:40:23,504 --> 00:40:25,798
Don't be silly. Things like that happen
when running a business.

649
00:40:26,382 --> 00:40:29,051
Let Chairman Yu know
not to worry about us as well.

650
00:40:29,135 --> 00:40:30,553
I will.

651
00:40:30,636 --> 00:40:32,847
I can see that Ji-hyeok
is generous and understanding

652
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:34,223
because he takes after you.

653
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:46,318
Did they have to
take their acting that far?

654
00:40:46,402 --> 00:40:48,654
Are they trying to win an Oscar or what?

655
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:49,989
Damn it.

656
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:50,948
Right?

657
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,951
I should find a dress for the red carpet.

658
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,744
Did you hear all that?

659
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:58,747
Don't worry. It's all just an act
at the end of the day.

660
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,709
And I actually like someone else.

661
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,296
Someone much more handsome
and cool than Gong Ji-hyeok.

662
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:07,673
Does a man like that exist?

663
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:09,049
Mr. Kim.

664
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:10,843
What, Seon-u?

665
00:41:15,723 --> 00:41:19,101
Wait, then you knew about it too?

666
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:21,854
That Seon-u and I…

667
00:41:21,937 --> 00:41:23,856
Since we're on the subject,

668
00:41:24,523 --> 00:41:26,317
how about a drink tonight?

669
00:41:27,067 --> 00:41:28,027
Fake wife.

670
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,069
Fake girlfriend.

671
00:41:30,196 --> 00:41:32,031
I think we'd have a lot to talk about.

672
00:41:33,866 --> 00:41:35,284
Cheers.

673
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,334
So you guys just went for it
on the very first day you met?

674
00:41:44,376 --> 00:41:45,294
Yes.

675
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,840
So much for being so indifferent.
Who knew there was such a side to him?

676
00:41:50,466 --> 00:41:53,302
- This is why you can't trust men.
- Oh, let me.

677
00:41:54,053 --> 00:41:56,847
Why do you like Seon-u?

678
00:41:56,931 --> 00:41:57,806
Is he nice to you?

679
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,684
No. He treats me terribly.

680
00:42:00,768 --> 00:42:03,521
He always plays hard to get
and pushes me away.

681
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:05,606
- It's so tiring.
- Then why do you like him?

682
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:10,027
I'm jealous of this woman in a photo.

683
00:42:10,736 --> 00:42:11,570
Pardon?

684
00:42:15,908 --> 00:42:16,992
You see,

685
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:20,287
I've always lived the life
my dad chose for me.

686
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:22,915
If I fell a little short
of his expectations,

687
00:42:22,998 --> 00:42:24,625
I was dismissed, ignored,

688
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,461
and compared to my older brother.

689
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:30,214
When my father told me
he didn't expect anything from me anymore

690
00:42:30,756 --> 00:42:34,426
and that my duty would be fulfilled
if I just married Ji-hyeok,

691
00:42:34,510 --> 00:42:35,803
I was honestly so happy.

692
00:42:36,387 --> 00:42:37,513
I thought I could finally be free.

693
00:42:37,596 --> 00:42:40,266
I could sense the freedom
I'd been wanting.

694
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:46,313
But…

695
00:42:47,815 --> 00:42:51,527
<i>I realized something</i>
<i>when I saw how Mr. Kim looked at children.</i>

696
00:42:53,571 --> 00:42:56,240
<i>What I really wanted wasn't freedom.</i>

697
00:42:57,241 --> 00:43:00,286
<i>It was for someone to look at me</i>
<i>with warm, loving eyes.</i>

698
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:08,127
I thought if I were with a man like him,

699
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:13,382
I could also smile brightly
like the woman in the photo one day.

700
00:43:13,465 --> 00:43:16,010
When you say the woman in the photo…

701
00:43:16,927 --> 00:43:19,597
So you liked him
even though you knew from the start?

702
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,348
It made me like him even more.

703
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,184
Because he was still capable
of being so warm

704
00:43:24,268 --> 00:43:26,395
despite failing at love
and being hurt by it.

705
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,148
That's true.

706
00:43:29,732 --> 00:43:32,109
I've known him for over 20 years,

707
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:34,069
and he's always been like that.

708
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:35,237
It's pretty amazing.

709
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,114
That's why I decided

710
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:40,659
to become his windbreaker
in this cold, cruel world

711
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:42,995
and guard that warmth
for the rest of my life.

712
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,456
For both him and Jun, of course.

713
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:51,170
I'm relieved.

714
00:43:51,754 --> 00:43:52,588
What?

715
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,173
To be honest,

716
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:58,677
I was worried
that it might've been a situation

717
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,431
where the daughter of a chaebol family

718
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:07,394
found out about Seon-u's predicament
and grew curious out of pity.

719
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,438
But I was wrong.

720
00:44:10,773 --> 00:44:11,690
Thank you

721
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:15,569
for seeing him for who he is.

722
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,908
You probably recognized that in him
because you're just as warmhearted.

723
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:25,120
But it's not easy to win him over.

724
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:26,830
He's so odd.

725
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:29,708
Maybe he doesn't like pretty women.

726
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:31,251
That could be a possibility.

727
00:44:31,335 --> 00:44:32,670
Totally.

728
00:44:32,753 --> 00:44:35,464
Should we brainstorm
what you can do from now on?

729
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,466
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

730
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:47,267
Let's link our arms and drink!

731
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:48,227
Let's link…

732
00:44:52,064 --> 00:44:53,107
Ha-yeong!

733
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:56,360
You should just be my younger sister.

734
00:44:56,443 --> 00:44:58,237
Really? I'd love that!

735
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,948
I've always wanted an older sister.

736
00:45:01,031 --> 00:45:04,284
- My younger sister!
- My older sister!

737
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:09,623
Hold on, giving allowances
to my younger sister is my thing.

738
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:11,041
Let's see here.

739
00:45:12,626 --> 00:45:16,839
One, two, three, four…

740
00:45:16,922 --> 00:45:19,883
You don't need to.
I know about your financial struggles.

741
00:45:19,967 --> 00:45:22,970
What are you talking about?
Take it. It's fine.

742
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,764
- I won't take no for an answer.
- You're the best!

743
00:45:25,848 --> 00:45:28,142
You're so cute!

744
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:30,477
Starting today,

745
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:34,314
- I'll be Go Ha-yeong.
- No, I'll be Yu Da-rim.

746
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:37,109
- Those two are okay, right?
- Yu Da-rim!

747
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:38,777
I hope so.

748
00:45:40,487 --> 00:45:41,738
I didn't expect Ms. Yu to be like this.

749
00:45:41,822 --> 00:45:44,575
Look at you so worried about me.

750
00:45:44,658 --> 00:45:46,201
- No, Ms. Yu, I…
- Why did you drink so much?

751
00:45:46,285 --> 00:45:51,665
- I'm in such a good mood today.
- Yes, Mr. Kim!

752
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,084
I know you should be in bed. I'm sorry.

753
00:45:54,626 --> 00:45:56,628
I'm sorry.

754
00:46:03,552 --> 00:46:05,637
This is what boyfriends are for.

755
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:09,808
<i>Ha-yeong!</i>

756
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:13,687
- Hey, I was going to say earlier…
- Da-rim, the second round is on me.

757
00:46:13,770 --> 00:46:15,439
I'm rich.

758
00:46:15,522 --> 00:46:17,483
What in the world is going on?
They reek of alcohol.

759
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,151
- Mom!
- Please.

760
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:20,444
Oh my goodness, Ha-yeong too.

761
00:46:21,236 --> 00:46:22,321
What's going on?

762
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:24,281
- Mom!
- Da-rim.

763
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:27,701
My sister.

764
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:29,745
My little sister.

765
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:32,122
- Da-rim.
- You're okay.

766
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:37,503
You're okay…

767
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:39,171
Let's go.

768
00:46:39,254 --> 00:46:40,088
All right.

769
00:46:40,756 --> 00:46:41,840
Mr. Gong.

770
00:46:46,345 --> 00:46:47,763
Da-rim told me

771
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,766
that you two are dating.

772
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:53,810
That's right.

773
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,732
I hope you don't take this the wrong way,

774
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:00,859
but you still

775
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,446
have no idea how truly great
a person Da-rim is.

776
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:08,992
She'll do anything and everything
for the people she cares about

777
00:47:09,576 --> 00:47:10,827
and trusts them until the end.

778
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:12,913
That's the reason she's been hurt a lot

779
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,414
and holds onto a lot of pain.

780
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,835
But she doesn't show it like a fool.

781
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:25,676
I won't just stand by if you make her cry.

782
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,806
She's my family.

783
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:34,351
Please be good to her.

784
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:36,812
Please.

785
00:47:40,774 --> 00:47:42,442
I hear you,

786
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:43,944
but I want you to know

787
00:47:45,737 --> 00:47:47,155
that I like Da-rim

788
00:47:48,824 --> 00:47:50,659
more than you think I do.

789
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,454
I'll never make her cry

790
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,082
or betray her.

791
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:00,460
So don't worry.

792
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,318
It's the pretty lady!

793
00:48:27,738 --> 00:48:28,739
Did you sleep well?

794
00:48:30,032 --> 00:48:32,117
How are you feeling?

795
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,619
I'm fine, thanks to you.

796
00:48:33,702 --> 00:48:34,911
Hold on.

797
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,083
Da-rim's inside, right?

798
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:41,877
Let's go.

799
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:44,171
She's passed out.
Do you need her for something?

800
00:48:44,254 --> 00:48:45,672
I have a morning appointment,

801
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:47,132
so I wanted to ask her
to take him to daycare.

802
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,133
I can do it.

803
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,928
Da-rim's going to need
at least three more days to sober up.

804
00:48:52,012 --> 00:48:52,929
Let's go, Jun.

805
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,728
Why are you smiling?

806
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:01,855
Because I'm going to daycare
with the pretty lady.

807
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,068
You're so smart, unlike your dad.

808
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,111
Which kindergarten did you go to?

809
00:49:08,195 --> 00:49:11,281
I never went to kindergarten or daycare.

810
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,574
My teachers came to my house.

811
00:49:13,158 --> 00:49:14,868
Then when did you play with your friends?

812
00:49:14,951 --> 00:49:17,412
I don't have friends.
I don't know how to make them either.

813
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:21,166
I guess this is why
early education is essential.

814
00:49:21,249 --> 00:49:22,793
Then should I become your friend?

815
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,295
When someone asks you
who your best friend is,

816
00:49:26,505 --> 00:49:27,881
tell them it's me.

817
00:49:32,719 --> 00:49:33,595
Really?

818
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,514
Thank you, Jun.

819
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,684
Maybe I should join you at daycare.

820
00:49:38,767 --> 00:49:39,685
Is it fun?

821
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:44,231
Preparing for the talent show
is fun and all, but…

822
00:49:44,314 --> 00:49:45,148
But?

823
00:49:45,732 --> 00:49:47,776
All the other kids
will have their moms there,

824
00:49:47,859 --> 00:49:49,486
but I won't, and it doesn't feel good.

825
00:49:50,153 --> 00:49:51,571
When's the talent show?

826
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,080
<i>Good morning.</i>

827
00:50:00,664 --> 00:50:02,624
Hey there.

828
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:03,917
Nan-suk.

829
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,504
Why is your face so puffy?
Did someone hit you?

830
00:50:07,587 --> 00:50:10,340
I had some instant noodles
and soju last night.

831
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:13,593
Customer service is no joke.

832
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:14,886
I'm burning up inside. Look at yourself.

833
00:50:14,970 --> 00:50:17,514
It looks like you had a couple of bottles.

834
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:20,976
Oh, I also had a drink or two.

835
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,358
Hey, Go-eun.

836
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:31,194
She's completely out of it.

837
00:50:31,278 --> 00:50:32,279
Are you okay?

838
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:33,613
I'm fine.

839
00:50:34,906 --> 00:50:36,366
It is what it is.

840
00:50:36,450 --> 00:50:38,368
What can we do?

841
00:50:41,329 --> 00:50:42,622
Everybody, good morning.

842
00:50:46,668 --> 00:50:48,462
You're chipper this morning.

843
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:50,672
I know, right? Was your husband
extra nice to you or something?

844
00:50:50,756 --> 00:50:52,048
No, as if.

845
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,675
I was professionally treated.

846
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:56,136
You went to see a doctor?

847
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:57,471
No, retail therapy.

848
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:01,308
Shopping is the best cure for stress.
Look at this.

849
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,225
This is expensive.

850
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,518
Doesn't it look luxurious?

851
00:51:04,561 --> 00:51:06,021
- Good for you.
- Well done.

852
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,230
KINDNESS, DEDICATION

853
00:51:07,314 --> 00:51:09,900
I see. Yes, of course.

854
00:51:09,983 --> 00:51:11,651
So you're saying

855
00:51:11,735 --> 00:51:13,945
you discovered a foreign substance
inside the diaper, correct?

856
00:51:14,446 --> 00:51:15,363
I see.

857
00:51:16,156 --> 00:51:18,658
All right. I submitted the complaint.

858
00:51:18,742 --> 00:51:20,869
<i>It wasn't just "a foreign substance."</i>
<i>It was a chicken bone.</i>

859
00:51:20,952 --> 00:51:22,204
Don't you hear me?

860
00:51:22,287 --> 00:51:23,747
Did you not look at the photo?

861
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:26,958
I did look at it,

862
00:51:28,126 --> 00:51:33,089
but something that big
would've caused our machinery to stop.

863
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:35,217
I'd say it's close to impossible

864
00:51:35,300 --> 00:51:37,719
for something like that
to be missed during production.

865
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,805
Are you saying I'm lying right now?

866
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:41,723
No, ma'am. Not at all.

867
00:51:41,807 --> 00:51:43,975
There could've been some sort of mishap.

868
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,477
- So how about--
- Forget it!

869
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,020
I want 100 million won in compensation.

870
00:51:47,813 --> 00:51:50,690
The baby woke up again because of you!
It took forever for me to put it to sleep!

871
00:51:50,774 --> 00:51:52,776
<i>Take responsibility!</i>

872
00:51:52,859 --> 00:51:54,402
Yes, ma'am.

873
00:51:54,486 --> 00:51:58,281
We'll first have someone visit you
and check the product in question.

874
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,741
<i>Enough with the checking!</i>

875
00:52:00,325 --> 00:52:02,327
Are you looking down on me
because I'm a mom?

876
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,245
<i>Just wait and see.</i>

877
00:52:03,328 --> 00:52:04,746
I won't let this slide!

878
00:52:04,830 --> 00:52:05,997
No, I--

879
00:52:06,081 --> 00:52:07,374
Hello?

880
00:52:16,758 --> 00:52:17,676
<i>Ms. Gong!</i>

881
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,553
Ms. Gong, there's an emergency.

882
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,429
Please take a look at this.

883
00:52:22,222 --> 00:52:23,348
What now?

884
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,976
A CHICKEN BONE IN A DIAPER
IGNORED BY NB CS "BECAUSE I'M A MOM"

885
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,018
What is this?

886
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:28,228
Chicken bone?

887
00:52:28,311 --> 00:52:29,729
Chicken bone is one thing,

888
00:52:29,813 --> 00:52:31,982
but this is the bigger issue.

889
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:37,863
<i>You should at least send someone to check.</i>

890
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:42,826
<i>Our policy wouldn't permit compensation</i>
<i>because it was a mishap on your end.</i>

891
00:52:42,909 --> 00:52:45,287
<i>Are you saying I'm lying?</i>

892
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:48,290
<i>Yes, that's exactly what I'm saying.</i>

893
00:52:48,874 --> 00:52:51,960
<i>Are you looking down on me</i>
<i>because I'm a mom?</i>

894
00:52:52,043 --> 00:52:53,587
<i>Probably.</i>

895
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:55,797
What the hell? Who is this?

896
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:57,007
Well,

897
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,967
it sounds like Go Da-rim,

898
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:01,386
so I checked
the original recording of the call.

899
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:02,929
This audio is fake.

900
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:05,640
I think she manipulated it
with a deepfake or whatever.

901
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:06,558
Manipulated?

902
00:53:06,641 --> 00:53:09,394
Yes. I'll have it removed immediately
for spreading false information

903
00:53:09,477 --> 00:53:11,354
and issue a statement.

904
00:53:11,438 --> 00:53:12,314
Go ahead.

905
00:53:14,774 --> 00:53:15,609
Wait.

906
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:18,403
Did you say that was Go Da-rim's voice?

907
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:19,613
Yes.

908
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,948
- Delete the original recording.
- Pardon?

909
00:53:22,574 --> 00:53:24,200
Delete the file.

910
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:28,496
Hello, Producer.

911
00:53:29,080 --> 00:53:30,290
Have you been well?

912
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,919
- Boycott it!
- Chicken bone diaper!

913
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:38,214
The CS representative's remarks have
sparked public outrage among consumers,

914
00:53:38,298 --> 00:53:39,591
and mom communities are now spreading

915
00:53:39,674 --> 00:53:42,510
- a boycott movement against Natural BeBe.
- A foreign substance was discovered.

916
00:53:42,594 --> 00:53:44,554
- Unapologetic corporate bully!
- It was none other than a chicken bone.

917
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:47,057
- Boycott it!
- The CS representative must be insane.

918
00:53:47,140 --> 00:53:48,725
Apologize for that unacceptable service!

919
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:49,935
- Apologize!
- Guys!

920
00:53:50,018 --> 00:53:52,437
- Excuse me.
- A diaper from a major company…

921
00:53:52,520 --> 00:53:56,149
Please don't do this.
There's been a misunderstanding.

922
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:57,651
What misunderstanding?

923
00:53:57,734 --> 00:54:00,403
The chicken bone or that insane employee?

924
00:54:00,987 --> 00:54:02,530
The chicken bone hasn't been confirmed,

925
00:54:02,614 --> 00:54:04,491
and I never said any of those things.

926
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:05,533
Hold on.

927
00:54:06,117 --> 00:54:07,786
Are you that crazy bitch?

928
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:09,162
Yeah, that's her voice!

929
00:54:09,245 --> 00:54:11,498
- Everyone, that's her.
- She has the face of a snake.

930
00:54:11,581 --> 00:54:13,208
What misunderstanding?
We heard the recording.

931
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,334
No, that's not--

932
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,835
You still haven't come to your senses!

933
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:20,382
Get a grip!

934
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:21,633
Get a grip!

935
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:23,677
<i>Don't try to feed us that nonsense.</i>

936
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,012
<i>Are you serious right now?</i>

937
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:27,806
<i>Take this!</i>

938
00:54:27,889 --> 00:54:31,017
<i>- How dare you?</i>
<i>- You piece of trash!</i>

939
00:54:38,066 --> 00:54:39,317
<i>A chicken bone in a diaper?</i>

940
00:54:39,401 --> 00:54:42,153
<i>I'm so pissed off right now.</i>

941
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,990
<i>Are we going to let them get away with it?</i>

942
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,241
<i>Come on out!</i>

943
00:54:46,324 --> 00:54:49,244
<i>We need to tear this place down!</i>

944
00:55:08,596 --> 00:55:09,597
Are you okay?

945
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:11,516
Let's go.

946
00:55:12,392 --> 00:55:13,393
Please move.

947
00:55:13,476 --> 00:55:14,310
Make way.

948
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:15,937
Move.

949
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:34,914
My goodness. Is that your doing?

950
00:55:36,541 --> 00:55:38,043
I thought I'd escalate it a bit.

951
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,837
An affair with the troublemaker
who's tarnishing the company's image.

952
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,173
That should be enough

953
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,675
to get rid of Gong Ji-hyeok.

954
00:55:46,259 --> 00:55:47,135
Yeah.

955
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,012
I confirmed that they're dating.

956
00:55:51,056 --> 00:55:52,390
Like father, like son.

957
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:54,517
Even affairs run in the family.

958
00:55:54,601 --> 00:55:55,727
This should be enough

959
00:55:56,227 --> 00:55:58,063
to get rid of him once and for all.

960
00:55:58,146 --> 00:55:58,980
Before that,

961
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:01,024
take a look at this.

962
00:56:01,858 --> 00:56:02,776
What's this?

963
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,404
My goodness.

964
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,574
Look at you.

965
00:56:09,657 --> 00:56:11,493
I'm sorry. It's all my fault.

966
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,787
You just bought that coat.

967
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:16,498
Forget it. Who cares about that?

968
00:56:16,581 --> 00:56:20,335
Why are they causing such a ruckus
when they don't even know the whole story?

969
00:56:20,418 --> 00:56:21,336
I know.

970
00:56:21,419 --> 00:56:23,088
We live in a scary world.

971
00:56:23,171 --> 00:56:25,840
I submitted requests for the post to be
taken down, but it keeps getting reposted.

972
00:56:26,341 --> 00:56:28,510
It feels like someone's
deliberately spreading it.

973
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:31,471
I can't believe this.

974
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,391
You're here.

975
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,291
I…

976
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,139
Are you hurt?

977
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,517
Everyone guarded me, so I'm fine.

978
00:57:23,064 --> 00:57:25,275
- We'll take immediate legal action.
- No.

979
00:57:25,358 --> 00:57:26,651
I want to go

980
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:29,863
and talk to her in person.

981
00:57:29,946 --> 00:57:31,197
Who knows what she'll do to you?

982
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:32,740
Don't do anything.

983
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:34,284
I'll handle it.

984
00:57:34,868 --> 00:57:36,161
She's my customer.

985
00:57:37,620 --> 00:57:39,706
As a member of the Mother TF Team,

986
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:42,083
I have to solve my own problems.

987
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:45,920
That's taking responsibility.

988
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:51,384
Then I'll come with you.

989
00:57:52,802 --> 00:57:53,678
Okay.

990
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:57,599
This is it.

991
00:58:08,234 --> 00:58:09,319
Can I help you?

992
00:58:11,070 --> 00:58:13,615
Are you Ms. Lee So-yeong?

993
00:58:13,698 --> 00:58:15,450
Yes. Who are you?

994
00:58:15,533 --> 00:58:19,537
Oh, hello. I'm Go Da-rim,
an employee of Natural BeBe.

995
00:58:20,163 --> 00:58:21,289
We just came by

996
00:58:21,372 --> 00:58:25,168
because we wanted to ask you
about the complaint you made.

997
00:58:25,251 --> 00:58:26,669
How did you know where I live?

998
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,421
Did you leak my personal information?

999
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,175
It'd be a leak if we provided it
to a third party without your permission.

1000
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:36,721
We lawfully used your personal information
for business purposes.

1001
00:58:36,804 --> 00:58:37,972
That doesn't matter!

1002
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:40,391
You showed up unannounced.

1003
00:58:41,351 --> 00:58:44,812
- You kept ignoring our calls--
- Leave right now.

1004
00:58:45,438 --> 00:58:47,106
Or I'll report you for stalking.

1005
00:58:49,317 --> 00:58:51,569
Ma'am, just a moment.

1006
00:58:53,571 --> 00:58:54,697
Ma'am, wait.

1007
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,366
Please talk to us.

1008
00:58:56,449 --> 00:58:58,618
Avoiding us and the issue
isn't going to solve anything.

1009
00:59:00,411 --> 00:59:01,579
What issue?

1010
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,122
What do you want?

1011
00:59:03,206 --> 00:59:05,250
Do you know how much trouble
you've caused us?

1012
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:06,292
Do I need to know?

1013
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:10,046
That company has never once listened
to my troubles!

1014
00:59:11,589 --> 00:59:13,049
Please calm down.

1015
00:59:13,132 --> 00:59:14,551
Why don't we talk inside?

1016
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:27,438
Oh no! Ye-eun!

1017
00:59:28,439 --> 00:59:29,524
Ye-eun!

1018
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:53,548
The baby.

1019
00:59:54,173 --> 00:59:55,550
Ye-eun!

1020
00:59:56,050 --> 00:59:57,594
Oh no!

1021
00:59:58,803 --> 00:59:59,721
Is she okay?

1022
00:59:59,804 --> 01:00:01,014
I'm so sorry.

1023
01:00:02,557 --> 01:00:04,767
Mommy's so sorry.

1024
01:00:09,188 --> 01:00:10,356
I'm so sorry.

1025
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,366
Let's just get you admitted.

1026
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,202
They said it was just a scratch.

1027
01:00:23,286 --> 01:00:24,704
It's nothing serious.

1028
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:27,373
Do you know how many times
my heart dropped today?

1029
01:00:27,457 --> 01:00:29,334
Look at it. I'm fine.

1030
01:00:29,417 --> 01:00:30,793
What are we going to do about your wrist?

1031
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:33,171
What do you mean? It's fine.

1032
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:34,172
Excuse me.

1033
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:38,343
Are you okay?

1034
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:40,428
Yes, I'm fine.

1035
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:42,096
Is Ye-eun okay?

1036
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:44,891
Yes, they said she was fine.

1037
01:00:44,974 --> 01:00:46,142
Thank goodness.

1038
01:00:48,353 --> 01:00:49,562
I'm sorry.

1039
01:00:50,813 --> 01:00:52,815
It's okay. No one got hurt.

1040
01:00:52,899 --> 01:00:54,067
Why are you crying?

1041
01:00:54,150 --> 01:00:55,318
I'm sorry.

1042
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:56,569
My goodness.

1043
01:00:57,945 --> 01:00:58,988
I'm sorry.

1044
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,910
I MANIPULATED THE NATURAL BEBE CONTROVERSY

1045
01:01:03,993 --> 01:01:06,162
<i>I'm the person who posted</i>
<i>about the chicken bone incident</i>

1046
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:07,705
<i>in Natural BeBe's diaper.</i>

1047
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,958
<i>I'd like to confess</i>
<i>that I made all of it up</i>

1048
01:01:11,042 --> 01:01:12,543
<i>and offer my sincerest apologies.</i>

1049
01:01:13,419 --> 01:01:15,880
<i>I've been dealing</i>
<i>with some personal issues recently,</i>

1050
01:01:15,963 --> 01:01:19,550
<i>and I ended up taking it out</i>
<i>on an innocent employee at Natural BeBe.</i>

1051
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:22,136
<i>Despite all that,</i>

1052
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,931
<i>the CS representative</i>
<i>threw herself to save my baby</i>

1053
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,766
<i>and was injured in the process.</i>

1054
01:01:27,934 --> 01:01:31,270
<i>I don't have the words to describe</i>
<i>how sorry and thankful I am.</i>

1055
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,524
<i>To prove her innocence,</i>

1056
01:01:34,607 --> 01:01:36,984
<i>I've attached</i>
<i>the original recording of the call.</i>

1057
01:01:54,669 --> 01:01:55,753
All right.

1058
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,548
The media outlets
have agreed to issue corrections.

1059
01:01:58,631 --> 01:01:59,757
What about the rest?

1060
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,593
We've uploaded an announcement
along with the original call recording.

1061
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:06,180
We've released our official statement
on social media and online communities.

1062
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:08,307
I've contacted
all the online mom communities as well,

1063
01:02:08,391 --> 01:02:10,560
and they've agreed to take down
all defamatory posts.

1064
01:02:10,643 --> 01:02:11,853
Yeah!

1065
01:02:11,936 --> 01:02:12,854
Well done, everyone.

1066
01:02:13,688 --> 01:02:15,314
- Good job, everyone!
- We're done.

1067
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:17,358
- It's over now, Da-rim.
- Team dinner tonight?

1068
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:19,277
How about a refreshing beer?

1069
01:02:19,360 --> 01:02:21,154
- That sounds so nice.
- Well done.

1070
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,238
What should we eat?

1071
01:02:22,780 --> 01:02:23,990
- Grilled intestines.
- I don't know.

1072
01:02:24,073 --> 01:02:25,158
Ms. Go Da-rim.

1073
01:02:27,034 --> 01:02:29,162
How's your injury?

1074
01:02:29,787 --> 01:02:31,372
It's healing.

1075
01:02:32,165 --> 01:02:33,040
Is that so?

1076
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,603
CERTIFICATE OF MARRIAGE STATUS

1077
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,356
