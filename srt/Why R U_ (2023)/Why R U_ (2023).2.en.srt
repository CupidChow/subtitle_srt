1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:01,430
As classmates...

2
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:04,950
let's get along well with each other.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,110
No.

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:08,119
I swear to God.

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:09,000
If I'm lying,

6
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,310
this novel will become reality from now on.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:15,390
Yijin's imagination is becoming reality?

8
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,040
You jerk!

9
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:18,790
You guys kissed.

10
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:21,400
I'm not Sunhoo. I'm Sunwoo.

11
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:23,110
But that's the last piece of paper left. What should I do?

12
00:00:23,110 --> 00:00:24,640
It's fine. Thank you.

13
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:26,490
How is that fine?

14
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:27,740
Who got the note with the word Juliet?

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,830
(Lee Jungmin as Jung Yiwon)

16
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,860
(Lee Yehwan as Kim Ji-oh)

17
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:43,060
(Lee Sangmin as Woo Sunwoo)

18
00:00:43,830 --> 00:00:46,310
(Park Changhoon as Go Yugyeom)

19
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,720
(WHY R U?)

20
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:55,800
(Episode 2: The Law of Attraction)

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,580
What is it?

22
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,810
Brother...

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:05,410
What's going on?

24
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:06,800
Why are you being sweet and calling me Brother?

25
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,890
Are you at school? You're at school, right?

26
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:12,660
Did you forget something again?

27
00:01:13,289 --> 00:01:14,950
I knew it.

28
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,470
I didn't forget anything.

29
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:18,789
I was writing my novel in the editing room...

30
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,120
Why did you have to write that novel at school?

31
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,670
Did you change the protagonists' names?

32
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:30,840
How could I have suddenly changed their names?

33
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:34,240
Do I have to write a scene
where the characters go to court together to legally change their names?

34
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,800
Write it. Why not?

35
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:37,400
My novel's not the problem here.

36
00:01:38,380 --> 00:01:40,830
If you don't want to get caught, stop making it so obvious.

37
00:01:42,340 --> 00:01:44,310
Even the campus cat knows about you two dating.

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:46,729
I told you we're not dating.

39
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,180
If you're not, it's even more problematic.

40
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:53,400
You were hugging and rolling on the floor, and even taking off your clothes.

41
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:55,060
I thought you were filming a movie.

42
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:57,940
Darn it.

43
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,330
Did you write this?

44
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:08,610
Do you think I would write that?

45
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,380
Our names are in the novel.

46
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:11,760
It's all your fault.

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,570
Because you keep following me around and pestering me,

48
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,940
Jung Yijin is writing a ridiculous novel.

49
00:02:17,650 --> 00:02:19,660
And I'm even cursed because of that.

50
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:22,090
Even the campus cat thinks we're dating.

51
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,160
Are you saying... we're dating?

52
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,760
You don't want to be involved with me either, do you?

53
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:32,180
So either quit the course

54
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:33,850
or change your partner.

55
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,920
I don't care about anyone else.

56
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:37,480
But if Yuri gets the wrong idea,

57
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:39,380
I won't forgive you.

58
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,420
This is already the only class I have with her.

59
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:47,800
Please, let's not get involved in each others' lives anymore.

60
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,740
I'm leaving.

61
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:05,250
Are you Juliet?

62
00:03:05,250 --> 00:03:06,240
No, I'm this.

63
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,670
Are you Juliet?

64
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,600
No, I'm this.

65
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,290
Are you Juliet?

66
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:10,190
No, I'm this.

67
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,510
Are you Juliet?

68
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:12,620
No.

69
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:16,620
Who got the note with the word Juliet?

70
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,310
Hi, Romeo.

71
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:36,480
No.

72
00:03:38,150 --> 00:03:38,980
No.

73
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:43,390
It's right. I'm Juliet.

74
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,180
(Kim Ji-oh, Juliet
Jung Yiwon, Romeo)

75
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:05,520
You don't have to take this class.

76
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,910
Why waste your time? It's not like you.

77
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:14,770
People are born with a lot of questions.

78
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:20,190
Why? Why? Why?

79
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,470
Why do you hate Jung Yiwon so much?

80
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:25,720
I just hate him for no reason.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:27,530
So there's no reason.

82
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:28,710
And now you're fixated on him.

83
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:34,100
No matter what the reason is, the so-called reason is always specific at first,

84
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:36,150
so it makes people blind and persistent.

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:39,350
But that specific reason will change someday.

86
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:43,350
Yuri always asks me to eat with her after class.

87
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:46,130
Could this be a sign that she has feelings for me?

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:49,170
Maybe she just doesn't want to eat alone.

89
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,620
Darn it.

90
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:53,570
You two must be totally flirting with each other. Are you satisfied?

91
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,330
Yuri is totally my ideal type.

92
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,920
Should I confess to her next week?

93
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:01,180
Or tomorrow?

94
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,960
Is that too soon? How about the day after tomorrow?

95
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:05,080
But...

96
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:08,680
when there's no reason, nothing can change.

97
00:05:09,330 --> 00:05:12,760
Throughout the duration when all reasons appear and then disappear,

98
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,250
having no reason always still means the same thing.

99
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:22,360
It's not just about the matter of why I hate Jung Yiwon.

100
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:25,020
Most of my feelings have no reason.

101
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:27,420
(Yiwon's Instagram)

102
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,790
Because I like that they don't change.

103
00:05:28,790 --> 00:05:29,880
(Yiwon's Instagram)

104
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,690
That means my feelings for Jung Yiwon will never change.

105
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:44,420
(WHY R U?)

106
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:47,140
Professor.

107
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,680
Can you change my partner, please?

108
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,400
Why?

109
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,060
Are you worried that Ji-oh can't act well because he's a directing major?

110
00:05:58,350 --> 00:05:59,900
That's just your luck, Yiwon.

111
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,740
A true actor doesn't nitpick about their acting partner.

112
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,370
Also, the directing majors are good at acting.

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,090
They're much better than you lot.

114
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,480
Professor, wait.

115
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:13,000
To be honest,

116
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:16,350
it's awkward for us to be face to face.

117
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,480
Is it really impossible to change partners?

118
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,560
An awkward relationship? Why?

119
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,110
Since our freshman year...

120
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,940
She won't agree if I say we just don't like each other.

121
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,510
What should I do?

122
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,390
Should I say that it's a relationship that can't be realized?

123
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,700
We were born...

124
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,560
Yes.

125
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,690
Anyway, I know it's hard for you to understand and empathize with me,

126
00:06:43,090 --> 00:06:45,010
but it's a huge problem for me.

127
00:06:45,790 --> 00:06:48,440
I've been so stressed out since I met him.

128
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,890
Even when I just look at him,

129
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:55,390
a part of my heart aches.

130
00:06:58,090 --> 00:07:00,880
Can I please change my partner?

131
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,170
Hello.

132
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,200
Hello.

133
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,140
Yiwon, let's go in.

134
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:14,300
You know I take this class because of you, right?

135
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:24,650
Don't try to escape while I'm still being civil with you.

136
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,990
Didn't you say you had no clue that the CIA is eavesdropping?

137
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:42,510
-Wow.
-Wow.

138
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:46,310
Okay, next up...

139
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,960
Jung Yiwon and Kim Ji-oh.

140
00:07:56,820 --> 00:07:58,440
-Good luck.
-Good luck.

141
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:04,770
Hear me out again.

142
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,780
I really have nothing to do with her.

143
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:11,870
She's just a senior I know, and I just ran into her...

144
00:08:15,570 --> 00:08:16,430
You're...

145
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:19,350
really...

146
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,940
the worst.

147
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:24,340
What?

148
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,650
What about our baby?

149
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,080
You're really shameless!

150
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,130
What is shame?

151
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,520
At this rate, you'll get a bad grade too.

152
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,280
I really need to get a good grade this time.

153
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,480
Then just act well.

154
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:45,730
Aren't your bad grades because of your poor acting?

155
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:46,950
Gosh.

156
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,830
You're shameless and heartless.

157
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,130
How do you expect me to

158
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,430
respond well to your ridiculous acting?

159
00:08:54,430 --> 00:08:55,690
I didn't know you have a baby.

160
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,320
Hey. I'm sorry.

161
00:09:11,590 --> 00:09:12,500
Is he really crying?

162
00:09:13,290 --> 00:09:15,020
He's really crying.

163
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,540
Don't be affected by me.

164
00:09:18,110 --> 00:09:18,940
Jung Yiwon.

165
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:20,700
Just act at your own pace.

166
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,030
Hey!

167
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:25,190
Isn't that Ji-oh and Yiwon?

168
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,820
They must be fighting.

169
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,670
They're fighting?

170
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,250
Kim Ji-oh.

171
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:34,990
I'll let you go just once more.

172
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,120
You know you'll fall if I let go, right?

173
00:09:51,890 --> 00:09:52,920
Should I let you go just this once?

174
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,570
You wacko. Don't you dare.

175
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:58,040
Gosh.

176
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,630
What does that look like to you?

177
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,800
Goodness, my button!

178
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,570
Gosh.

179
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:22,890
Gosh.

180
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,890
Darn it.

181
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:37,950
Let's close the window. We shouldn't be watching.

182
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,330
I'm not prejudiced against such things.

183
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:43,960
But it's my first time seeing it with my own eyes.

184
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:47,390
I'll get going.

185
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,130
Didn't you ask us to have dinner together?

186
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,620
I have to write when inspiration strikes.

187
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,210
Lie down.

188
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:59,360
Goodness.

189
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,050
Gosh.

190
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:12,530
(WHY R U?)

191
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,460
Don't you know? Sun-woo is the NPC of Hanguk University.

192
00:12:11,690 --> 00:12:14,720
When does he sleep if he has so many part-time jobs?

193
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,780
Why would a NPC need sleep?

194
00:12:17,410 --> 00:12:20,300
Don't you think Sunwoo is really hardworking?

195
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,280
He's really kind too.

196
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:25,880
I've never seen him reject anyone asking for his help.

197
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,540
He's always agreeable and smiling.

198
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,770
How does he stay smiling all the time?

199
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:33,410
Thank you. Enjoy.

200
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,060
What's going on? Why doesn't he smile at me?

201
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,860
Of course he doesn't smile at you.

202
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:45,540
Why?

203
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,300
Sunwoo used to like Doyeon.

204
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,190
No, they're just close friends.

205
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:57,950
I don't think they have such a relationship.

206
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:05,900
What's wrong with you? Do you like Sunwoo?

207
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,630
No wonder you kept praising him.

208
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:11,950
N-No.

209
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
It's true.

210
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,260
Don't put words in my mouth.

211
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,360
Why are you blushing?

212
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:28,030
I still don't think he's good enough for Doyeon.

213
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:35,340
Sunwoo, can you be my team's sound director?

214
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:37,540
Sunwoo is going to be the gaffer on my film set.

215
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,090
Can you also be my team's scriptwriter?

216
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:42,030
You can be the slate too, right?

217
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,900
I'll do it as long as it doesn't conflict with my film's schedule.

218
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,080
Yay!

219
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,770
Yugyeom.

220
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,080
Have you found a cinematographer yet?

221
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:02,590
Not yet. I'm going to start asking around now.

222
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,600
Not yet?

223
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,400
Why don't you contact Go Yugyeom?

224
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,490
I'll give you his contact.

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,020
I heard he studied abroad, is good at shooting,

226
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,350
and has all the equipment.

227
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,150
Hey, what was that camera we saw the last time called?

228
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:16,790
Many directors are dying to work with him...

229
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,130
Goodness.

230
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:29,520
Go Yugyeom and Doyeon are dating, right?

231
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,020
Gosh, sorry for my careless words.

232
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,490
What about it? I don't like Doyeon.

233
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,110
I think you misunderstood because we hang out all the time.

234
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,110
Doyeon and I are just friends.

235
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:45,980
Right?

236
00:14:46,570 --> 00:14:47,560
Let's go.

237
00:14:47,740 --> 00:14:49,620
Okay, let's go.

238
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:58,570
One iced Americano, please.

239
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:00,130
Okay, how would like to pay?

240
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,710
Okay, I've confirmed your order.

241
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,150
Okay, I've confirmed your order.

242
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,310
(Cheesecake)

243
00:15:38,930 --> 00:15:40,340
Why are you venting your anger on someone else's face?

244
00:15:46,630 --> 00:15:47,640
I'm so annoyed.

245
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,290
Is it because of Yugyeom?

246
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,860
I feel like I'm being used by him.

247
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,310
Darn it, Sunwoo.

248
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,830
Do I have to be so frustrated over him?

249
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,470
Is it wrong to like someone?

250
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,930
If it's tough,

251
00:16:05,310 --> 00:16:06,600
you can just break up.

252
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,910
You have such a gentle-looking face,

253
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,850
but you're quite extreme.

254
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,380
If everyone gives up upon a little obstacle,

255
00:16:15,890 --> 00:16:17,550
there'd be no couples left in the world.

256
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:24,810
Oh, right. You'll be coming to my birthday party tomorrow, right?

257
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:27,230
Don't tell me you have part-time work again.

258
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:30,160
I'll be there. What gift do you want?

259
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,430
Just show up.

260
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:46,700
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

261
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:51,670
Hey, Sunwoo!

262
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,770
Where did you get a cake at this hour?

263
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,860
I bought it at the shop where I work.

264
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:01,630
It's just right. We didn't have a cake.

265
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:02,970
Woo Sunwoo.

266
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,800
You're finally here after working hard.

267
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,710
Why did you drink so much?

268
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:07,910
I don't know.

269
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:09,940
Hey, Sunwoo bought a cake.

270
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:11,450
-Really?
-Yes.

271
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:12,859
Hurry and open it.

272
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:14,569
You like whipped cream cakes, right?

273
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,760
You're the best.

274
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:22,430
Happy birthday, dear Doyeon. Happy birthday.

275
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,020
Blow out the candles.

276
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,510
The candles are melting. Blow them out quickly.

277
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,550
Happy birthday.

278
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:45,450
Thank you.

279
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:46,970
But why isn't Yugyeom here yet?

280
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:48,950
Maybe he's busy. I don't know.

281
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:52,150
Cheers. Happy birthday.

282
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:53,940
Happy birthday.

283
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,930
(Spam advertisement)

284
00:18:16,330 --> 00:18:18,530
It's a spam text. Darn it.

285
00:18:23,610 --> 00:18:26,200
Oh, right. That jerk, Go Yugyeom.

286
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:28,220
Go Yugyeom.

287
00:18:34,360 --> 00:18:35,340
Hello.

288
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:37,740
Jerk, how late are you going to be?

289
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,040
The girls are making a fuss and asking when you're arriving.

290
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,070
Get here now.

291
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,120
I'm going now.

292
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,150
This is the last time.

293
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:45,980
Don't you dare include me in a group blind date again.

294
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,820
Fine. Just get here now...

295
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,870
Are you kidding me...

296
00:18:59,450 --> 00:19:01,860
(Woo Sunwoo
2day's Doyeon's bday. Why r u not here?)

297
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,070
I'm really not drunk.

298
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,260
What are you talking about? I'm not drunk.

299
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,000
Cheers.

300
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,790
Because you're a NPC, you're even sleeping on the street.

301
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,130
You even know how to respond.

302
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,070
Hey, Sunwoo. Wake up. You should go home.

303
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,270
Senior. Can you break up with her?

304
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,430
What?

305
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:03,350
Let's go.

306
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:07,060
Gosh.

307
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:10,280
Just break up with her, you jerk.

308
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:13,030
You're a playboy

309
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:15,550
who's even flirting with other girls.

310
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:18,240
Who do you think you are?

311
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,550
Hey, how dare you talk to your senior like that?

312
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,320
I'm cold.

313
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:28,710
What?

314
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,580
I'm cold.

315
00:20:31,990 --> 00:20:33,210
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

316
00:20:38,670 --> 00:20:39,600
Here's a pillow.

317
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:07,120
Give me some water.

318
00:21:15,130 --> 00:21:16,150
What now?

319
00:21:16,150 --> 00:21:17,960
Give me some water.

320
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:19,590
What?

321
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,330
Water. I want water.

322
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:30,720
How is he living on such food?

323
00:21:33,570 --> 00:21:35,110
Sunwoo, drink some water.

324
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:43,050
Here's some water.

325
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:51,310
(In the next episode)

326
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:52,930
W-W-Why are you at my house?
(In the next episode)

327
00:22:52,930 --> 00:22:53,630
W-W-Why are you at my house?

328
00:22:53,630 --> 00:22:55,060
You don't seem to remember anything.

329
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,000
-Yiwon.
-What?

330
00:22:58,490 --> 00:22:59,700
Are you not curious about me anymore?

331
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:01,600
When we fight like this, it really feels like Jung Yijin's novel.

332
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,530
There are scenes like that in there too.

333
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,240
It's so interesting.

334
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,660
So he does hate me because he likes her.

335
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:09,960
Because you like her?

336
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,460
It's infuriating how much

337
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:17,580
that jerk Kim Ji-oh enjoys it when I'm annoyed.

338
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:19,740
Then do the same. Annoy Kim Ji-oh.

339
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:21,990
Please forgive me just this once.

340
00:23:23,950 --> 00:23:24,980
Okay?

341
00:23:25,240 --> 00:23:28,860
No. 3 and No. 7. Kiss!

342
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,600
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

343
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,820
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

344
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,400
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

345
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,500
You were upset, right?

346
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:37,840
No.

347
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,310
Then...

348
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,090
Are you awake?

349
00:23:56,060 --> 00:24:00,320
(WHY R U?)

350
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:03,100
Have you made your presentation materials?

351
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,690
Of course. You haven't made yours yet, right?

352
00:24:04,690 --> 00:24:06,880
When did you do it? Don't you work every day?

353
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,010
I always do my homework in advance.

354
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,170
Fine...

355
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:13,280
What is this?

356
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:15,590
Drinks for you.

357
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:19,130
The law of attraction.

358
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,830
Whether it's out of my own will or not,

359
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:26,380
I'm so attracted to it that I can't stop thinking about it.

360
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:31,440
Even if I try to ignore it, I'll eventually have to admit to it.

361
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:34,590
It wasn't magic that made me drawn to it,

362
00:24:37,040 --> 00:24:38,980
but my unconscious will.
