(Ji-oh: You have to finish it.)
(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)
(Yiwon: What?)
(Ji-oh: I don't need ice cream. I'm not a kid.)
(Yiwon: Then what am I?)
(Ji-oh: Jung Yiwon.)
(Yiwon: (confused) Huh?)
(Ji-oh: It'll be enough that you're here for me.)
(Yiwon: (staring at Ji-oh) How is that enough?)
(Ji-oh: Because I like you.)
((Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon))

(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)

00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:05,060
Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon?

00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:11,280
One second goes by in a blink of an eye.

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:12,720
In such a short time

6
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,790
where it seems impossible for something important to happen,

7
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:18,850
many important things happen to us.

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:26,290
Yijin's imagination is becoming reality?

9
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,740
So let's... just end here.

10
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:36,570
Psychologists say that love at first sight is not just something that happens in movies,

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:38,520
but a scientifically-based phenomenon.

12
00:00:41,560 --> 00:00:46,160
Your feelings towards someone is decided within a second.

13
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:57,110
Whether it's falling in love... or how annoying you find someone.

14
00:00:57,110 --> 00:00:58,440
Action.

(WHY R U?)
(Episode 1: Polar Opposites)

20
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,650
It's fascinating.

21
00:01:30,310 --> 00:01:31,520
What is?

22
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:36,590
Is life still enjoyable even with your bad grades?

23
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:37,560
Yes.

24
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,550
How dare you say you want to be an actor when you got a F grade for your acting course?

25
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,810
How dare you talk to your brother like that?

26
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:44,150
If you don't want to be serious about acting,

27
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,789
you should look into something else

28
00:01:45,789 --> 00:01:47,400
or change your major.

29
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,740
You can also pursue directing like your friend Sunwoo, or production.

30
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:55,509
Hey, Jung Yijin. I have my reasons.

31
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:57,910
What do you know?

32
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:00,930
Why can't you act like that for your acting courses?

33
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:03,470
If you get another F grade, Mom will really kick you out.

34
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,510
Seriously.

35
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:08,460
I was going to work hard starting this semester anyway.

36
00:02:11,990 --> 00:02:13,880
What have you been up to lately? Why are you always going to bed so late?

37
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:18,210
Why are you so surprised? What is it?

38
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,020
It's better that you don't know.

39
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:26,150

No.

63
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:52,690
You major in directing, so it's not a mandatory course for you.

64
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:54,750
Yes, I don't have to take it.

65
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:57,270
Then why won't you switch courses with me?

66
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,630
Because I don't like how you're asking me for help.

67
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:02,920
Please.

68
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,550
Oh, right. I don't like the person who's asking me for help too.

Are you insulting me?

I was actually going to switch with you, but I guess not now.

Do you think it's right to use that tone with me?

102
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:56,060
I should've just saved a seat for Sunwoo.

103
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:58,070
Why? Is Sunwoo not coming today too?

104
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:59,350
Because of his part-time job?

105
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,420
No. He's just going to be a little late.

106
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,960
It might offend some people, but it's better than not coming.

107
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,710
That's good.

108
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:06,250
One shouldn't be absent for an event like this,

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,220
Nice!

160
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,360
-Drop it!
-Good job!

161
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,150
60 seconds is up. Those that have to receive punishment, step forward.

162
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:02,530
Step forward now.

163
00:09:02,530 --> 00:09:04,090
Gosh.

164
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:06,220
They're asking you to step forward.

165
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:07,460
-Cute.
-Cute.

166
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,800
Sunwoo is most suitable for things like this.

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:11,280
It's cute only because it's Sunwoo.

168
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,640
He seems like he'd be a dupe.

169
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,730
What happened to your face?

170
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,220
Goodness.

171
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,960
Sorry.

172
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,770
Where's your name tag?

173
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:32,820
You were late, so you didn't know how to get one, right?

174
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:36,760
Tell that handsome Senior over there

175
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,200
and he'll write one for you.

176
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,620
Go get one now.

177
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:46,110
Hello. I'm Woo Sunwoo, a directing major.

178
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:52,510
(Woo Sunhoo)

179
00:09:56,960 --> 00:10:00,430
I'm not Sunhoo. I'm Sunwoo.

180
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:01,920
Oh.

181
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:04,690
But that's the last piece of paper left. What should I do?

182
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,220
It's fine. Thank you.

183
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:13,320
How is that fine?

184
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,890
(WHY R U?)

185
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,420
Is this the trend these days?

186
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:58,300
You mean this? What about it?

187
00:11:25,070 --> 00:11:26,400
Hey.

188
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,170
Aren't we in a relationship?

189
00:11:28,170 --> 00:11:29,610
Who is he?

190
00:11:29,610 --> 00:11:30,860
Yiwon.

191
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,470
Kim Ji-oh, you again?

192
00:11:34,470 --> 00:11:40,110
Yiwon. I don't think we're in a relationship yet.

193
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,450
If you two aren't in a relationship, why were you kissing?

194
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,460
No, I was referring to you and me.

195
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,950
-We're not in a relationship.
-What?

196
00:11:46,950 --> 00:11:50,550
I like Ji-oh, and I like you too.

197
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:52,170
I like both of you equally.

198
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,410
Hello, Mom.

199
00:11:56,410 --> 00:11:57,740
I'll get going.

200
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:59,610
Don't fight and just talk it out.

201
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,140
What are you trying to do?

202
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,850
You're going against me on purpose, aren't you?

203
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,870
See.

204
00:12:11,870 --> 00:12:14,490
You'd usually annoy me when you see me.

205
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,550
But now you're so guilty that you can't even say a word.

206
00:12:16,550 --> 00:12:18,600
Why do you follow me wherever I go

207
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:21,890
and keep picking fights with me?

208
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:24,700
Why do you keep hanging around me?

209
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:28,170
Please.

210
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,070
Let's go our separate ways.

211
00:12:42,740 --> 00:12:45,120
I didn't realize you're so short.

212
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,110
Now that I have a closer look, you're quite unappealing.

213
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:48,030
(That jerk's not even that tall!)

214
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:52,400
That jerk's not even that tall!
(That jerk's not even that tall!)

215
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,770
-That jerk!
-Yiwon.

216
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,170
You're an adult now. Stop crying.

217
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,680
Stop making fun of him.

218
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,760
I can't bear to abandon Jung Yiwon here

219
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,060
because he's so short that he might be trampled to death!

220
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:03,290
Let go of me!

221
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,660
Gosh.

222
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:04,710
(This belongs to Kim Ji-oh. Please don't take it.)
Gosh.

223
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:06,480
(This belongs to Kim Ji-oh. Please don't take it.)

224
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:08,970
What's this?

225
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,090
Is this Kim Ji-oh that Kim Ji-oh?

226
00:13:12,090 --> 00:13:13,210
Don't you know about this?

227
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:14,890
In the second semester, Kim Ji-oh invested a lot of money on getting that doll.

228
00:13:14,890 --> 00:13:17,140
But he hasn't been successful.

229
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:21,380
He's so obsessive. He has to get it himself.

230
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,710
With all that money, he'd be able to buy 100 of that doll.

231
00:13:25,370 --> 00:13:26,930
-Hey!
-Hey!

232
00:13:26,930 --> 00:13:28,300
Gosh.

233
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,520
Hey!

234
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:30,480
Are you crazy?

235
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:32,120
Are you really going to get it?

236
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,520
I don't think it's a good idea.

237
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,930
The doll even looks like Kim Ji-oh.

238
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,800
(This belongs to Kim Ji-oh. Please don't take it.)

239
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,080
Hey, Jung Yiwon.

240
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,180
What's up?

241
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:54,410
Hello.

242
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:02,140
What am I going to do about the acting course?

243
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:02,380
(The present day)
What am I going to do about the acting course?

244
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,540
(The present day)

245
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,440
What does he have against me?
(The present day)

246
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,080
I told you not to get the doll. You're so short-sighted.

247
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:11,930
Kim Ji-oh!

248
00:14:11,930 --> 00:14:14,240
Gosh, you startled me.

249
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,400
Yiwon, this is a precious jacket that I'm wearing for the first time.

250
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:25,820
I'm sorry.

251
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,780
I'm going to the restroom anyway. I'll wash it for you.

252
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:33,020
It's fine. That's such a hassle. I'll just wear it like that.

253
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,240
It's not a hassle.

254
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:40,950
He's not even a little kid.

255
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:42,190
What's the big deal about a doll?

256
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,030
You should've just given it to him.

257
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:46,560
He said he doesn't want it because he didn't get it himself.

258
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,990
What a weirdo. He's so stubborn.

259
00:14:52,090 --> 00:14:54,990
By the way, why aren't you in a relationship with Sunwoo?

260
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,100
Yiwon. As a friend, you shouldn't be saying that.

261
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,290
Why? Sunwoo's a good catch.

262
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:04,250
He's kind and handsome. He has a nice body

263
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,730
and pretty dimples when he smiles.

264
00:15:05,730 --> 00:15:09,280
And he's the best at making movies out of all the directing majors.

265
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,790
If you like him that much, you can go out with him.

266
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:12,440
Gosh.

267
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:14,420
Sunwoo is a nice guy,

268
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:16,810
but he's not my type.

269
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,490
It's a big event. How can I not be there?

270
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,060
Oh? Sunwoo!

271
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,590
Hello.

272
00:15:32,590 --> 00:15:34,310
We still have Sunwoo.

273
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:35,980
Sunwoo, you need money, right?

274
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:38,230
Take over my part-time job's midnight shift today, okay?

275
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:39,440
Oh...

276
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:43,090
Okay, I'll do it.

277
00:15:43,090 --> 00:15:45,460
Don't you want to go to the back-to-school party?

278
00:15:45,460 --> 00:15:47,140
No, it's fine.

279
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:47,920
That's right.

280
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,250
Our kind Sunwoo should be making money instead.

281
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:51,180
I'll contact you later.

282
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,980
Okay. Bye.

283
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,790
Let's go.

284
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,100
What a pushover.

285
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,510
What are you waiting for? Let's go.

286
00:16:01,510 --> 00:16:02,990
I'm coming.

287
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:07,160
It's not easy for everyone to be gathered together,

288
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,960
so make a speech.

289
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:11,450
-Should I?
-Yes.

290
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:15,170
(You've been successfully enrolled
into the acting practical course.
-Office of Academic Affairs-)

291
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:20,600
Senior, have I told you that I love you?

292
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:25,370
Hey, it's now your 24th time telling me that.

293
00:16:26,510 --> 00:16:29,090
I specially switched it for you,

294
00:16:29,090 --> 00:16:30,810
so you owe me a favor.

295
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:32,780
I'm at your disposal.

296
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:33,940
Senior, I love you!

297
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,950
Okay.

298
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,510
I love you!

299
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:37,320
Do you love me that much?

300
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,990
Why do you keep looking at Ji-oh?

301
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:44,800
You've been making glances at him nonstop.

302
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,250
Why? Are you interested in him?

303
00:16:47,250 --> 00:16:50,900
Senior, you should go home if you're drunk.

304
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:01,730
(Doyeon)
(Jung Yiwon finally enrolled in his course)
(But he's making such a big deal about it that Ji-oh might beat him up soon)

305
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
-Hello.
-Hello.

306
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:18,520
Senior, you work here?

307
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:19,290
Yes.

308
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:22,230
I don't usually work this shift. I'm just covering for someone.

309
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,819
That's why you didn't show up.

310
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:27,280
You're always absent from the major's events. You must show up next time.

311
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,590
Okay.

312
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:30,300
It was really fun today.

313
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,400
Let's go.

314
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,870
-Thank you, Senior.
-Thank you, Senior.

315
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,940
Charge it together.

316
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:43,660
Okay.

317
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:45,510
Do you need a bag?

318
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,540
No.

319
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,780
Oh, right. Come for drinks after work.

320
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:56,750
It's on me, so don't feel burdened.

321
00:17:58,060 --> 00:17:59,680
Thank you. Goodbye.

322
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,590
Wait, Senior!

323
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,370
(The more I drink it
the more I fall for
Your Eyes)

324
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:09,090
Did he forget it?
(The more I drink it
the more I fall for
Your Eyes)

325
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,770
Did he forget it?

326
00:18:09,770 --> 00:18:12,590
Sigh. My dear sister.

327
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:14,530
She didn't even attend the back-to-school party to make money.

328
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:14,770
(Ji-oh: You have to finish it.)
(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)
(Yiwon: What?)
(Ji-oh: I don't need ice cream. I'm not a kid.)
(Yiwon: Then what am I?)
(Ji-oh: Jung Yiwon.)
(Yiwon: (confused) Huh?)
(Ji-oh: It'll be enough that you're here for me.)
(Yiwon: (staring at Ji-oh) How is that enough?)
(Ji-oh: Because I like you.)
((Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon))
She didn't even attend the back-to-school party to make money.

329
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:17,080
She was writing her online novel all night again.
(Ji-oh: You have to finish it.)
(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)
(Yiwon: What?)
(Ji-oh: I don't need ice cream. I'm not a kid.)
(Yiwon: Then what am I?)
(Ji-oh: Jung Yiwon.)
(Yiwon: (confused) Huh?)
(Ji-oh: It'll be enough that you're here for me.)
(Yiwon: (staring at Ji-oh) How is that enough?)
(Ji-oh: Because I like you.)
((Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon))

330
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,970
(Ji-oh: You have to finish it.)
(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)
(Yiwon: What?)
(Ji-oh: I don't need ice cream. I'm not a kid.)
(Yiwon: Then what am I?)
(Ji-oh: Jung Yiwon.)
(Yiwon: (confused) Huh?)
(Ji-oh: It'll be enough that you're here for me.)
(Yiwon: (staring at Ji-oh) How is that enough?)
(Ji-oh: Because I like you.)
((Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon))

331
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:19,140
Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon?
(Ji-oh: You have to finish it.)
(Yiwon: Why?)
(Ji-oh: Don't waste it.)
(Yiwon: Then if I have to console you in the future, do I just give you ice cream?)
(Ji-oh: No.)
(Yiwon: What?)
(Ji-oh: I don't need ice cream. I'm not a kid.)
(Yiwon: Then what am I?)
(Ji-oh: Jung Yiwon.)
(Yiwon: (confused) Huh?)
(Ji-oh: It'll be enough that you're here for me.)
(Yiwon: (staring at Ji-oh) How is that enough?)
(Ji-oh: Because I like you.)
((Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon))

332
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:24,130
Ji-oh looks down at Yiwon?

333
00:18:24,130 --> 00:18:28,030
Hey! Did you read it?

334
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,990
What is this?

335
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,630
In life,

336
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:40,360
some people write BL novels from time to time.

337
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:43,330
-No...
-No?

338
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:47,200
Shouldn't you be one to understand that?

339
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,660
Me? Understand that?

340
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:52,290
Why? How?

341
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,030
I didn't expect that you'd be prejudiced against certain genres.

342
00:18:57,030 --> 00:18:59,710
No, that's not it.

343
00:18:59,710 --> 00:19:02,250
It has nothing to do with the genre of your novel.

344
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,220
But this is not right.

345
00:19:03,220 --> 00:19:05,470
Why does my name and that jerk Kim Ji Oh's name appear together?

346
00:19:05,470 --> 00:19:06,410
Are you crazy?

347
00:19:06,410 --> 00:19:07,730
Delete it right now.

348
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:12,780
Don't touch it. Do you think the world revolves around you?

349
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,920
Do you think you're the only one with the name Jung Yiwon in this world?

350
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:18,980
The name's just a coincidence.

351
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,070
A coincidence?

352
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,630
There's a probability of 99% that

353
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,850
I'm the only Jung Yiwon who's in the Department of Theater and Media.

354
00:19:26,850 --> 00:19:29,370
On top of that, even my friends' names

355
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:31,470
Woo Sunwoo and Kim Doyeon appear here.

356
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,510
Is that also a coincidence?

357
00:19:32,510 --> 00:19:35,060
Is it a coincidence that I'm even involved with Kim Ji-oh?

358
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:42,790
Is it because you're worried that your relationship with Kim Ji-oh will be exposed?

359
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,380
I'm sorry about that. I failed to consider that.

360
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:51,820
I have to submit it as soon as possible

361
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:54,170
but I was out of ideas.

362
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm really sorry.

363
00:19:58,820 --> 00:20:01,660
What relationship do I have with him?

364
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,990
Aren't you two dating?

365
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,850
I saw everything...

366
00:20:08,910 --> 00:20:11,110
when you two kissed.

367
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:12,170
Me?

368
00:20:13,490 --> 00:20:16,070
Why would Kim Ji-oh and I kiss?

369
00:20:20,790 --> 00:20:22,320
I didn't realize you're so short.

370
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,590
Now that I have a closer look, you're quite unappealing.

371
00:20:27,610 --> 00:20:30,640
Kim Ji-oh, I'm sick of having to engage with you.

372
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:35,320
Please stay away from me and her.

373
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:37,060
Okay?

374
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:40,700
But she's the one who's following me around because she likes me.

375
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:44,400
You're really shameless. Why are you lying?

376
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,400
Why would she follow you around? We're in a relationship...

377
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,190
We were almost in a relationship. Why would she do that?

378
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:54,880
Yijin, isn't that your brother?

379
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:55,810
Is that Ji-oh?

380
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:56,690
Why?

381
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:58,300
Do you really not know why?

382
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,960
Isn't it obvious?

383
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:04,600
If you were in her shoes,

384
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,340
you'd think I'm a better catch too.

385
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,470
You jerk!

386
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,940
You two kissed.

387
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:18,390
Actually, it was hard for me to accept it.

388
00:21:19,730 --> 00:21:21,320
We didn't kiss.

389
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:24,780
I saw it with my own eyes.

390
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,310
I told you we didn't.

391
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:27,880
You did.

392
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:31,510
No matter what, we didn't kiss.

393
00:21:31,510 --> 00:21:32,530
You kissed.

394
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:33,500
No.

395
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,200
You did.

396
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:34,910
No.

397
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:35,540
You did.

398
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,230
No!

399
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:37,010
You did!

400
00:21:37,010 --> 00:21:38,130
Goodness.

401
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:42,000
How could you call that a kiss?

402
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,010
I just punched him on his lips.

403
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:49,720
Don't they say a strong denial is an affirmation?

404
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:55,600
I swear to God.

405
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,440
If I'm lying,

406
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:01,100
this novel will become reality from now on.

407
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:04,050
That's actually more probable.

408
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:06,540
When I crashed into Kim Ji-oh,

409
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:08,640
if there was even a second that felt like a kiss to me,

410
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,000
please let this novel become reality. You heard me?

411
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,180
Are you crazy?

412
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:13,950
Why did you swear on my novel?

413
00:22:13,950 --> 00:22:15,890
Do you even know what I've been writing?

414
00:22:15,890 --> 00:22:16,920
Take back what you just said now!

415
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:19,470
I'm confident.

416
00:22:31,210 --> 00:22:32,580
I'm sorry I'm late.

417
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,890
It's okay. Your hair's messy...

418
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,050
W-What's going on?

419
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,720
I guess it got messy because I ran over in a hurry.

420
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,510
Shall we go and eat?

421
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,470
Okay.

422
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,210
No way.

423
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,890
No way.

424
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,290
Yiwon.

425
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,450
Yiwon.

426
00:23:36,630 --> 00:23:38,210
Huh?

427
00:23:38,210 --> 00:23:40,390
Isn't this yours?

428
00:23:40,390 --> 00:23:41,700
Thank you.

429
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,450
Yijin's imagination is becoming reality?

430
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:09,450
What does this mean?

431
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,940
I have one class left.

432
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:17,630
When will you finish?

433
00:24:17,630 --> 00:24:18,620
5:30 p.m.

434
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:20,510
Yugyeom.

435
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:21,710
You're here.

436
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:28,450
I have something to tell you. Do you want to say it?

437
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:34,100
We're officially in a relationship.

438
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,470
What's wrong with him?

439
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:46,160
Did you just say you're in a relationship?

440
00:24:54,350 --> 00:24:57,050
Don't think too much.

441
00:24:57,050 --> 00:24:59,890
Happy and positive thoughts only.

442
00:24:59,890 --> 00:25:01,130
Hello, everyone.

443
00:25:01,130 --> 00:25:02,860
Hello.

444
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:04,940
Okay.

445
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:06,450
The partner you pick today

446
00:25:06,450 --> 00:25:08,510
will be the one who will work together and take the exams with you.

447
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:10,610
You'll be together throughout the semester.

448
00:25:10,610 --> 00:25:12,480
So be careful when you pick.

449
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:15,610
Don't be silly and pick your ex. Understand?

450
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:16,880
-Yes.
-Yes.

451
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,380
Okay, let's pick one by one.

452
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,690
Oh, it's Romeo.

453
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:50,200
Looks like I've to look for Juliet.

454
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,960
(Juliet)

455
00:25:53,540 --> 00:25:54,420
Are you Juliet?

456
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,020
No, I'm this.

457
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:56,920
Are you Juliet?

458
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,740
No, I'm this.

459
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,320
Are you Juliet?

460
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,940
No, I'm this.

461
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:00,500
Are you Juliet?

462
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,660
No.

463
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:06,550
Who got the note with the word Juliet?

464
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:20,750
Hi, Romeo.

465
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:28,190
(In the next episode)

466
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,650
Why do you hate Jung Yiwon so much?

467
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:31,700
I just hate him for no reason.

468
00:26:32,950 --> 00:26:34,630
You know I'm taking this class because of you, right?

469
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:37,340
Jung Yiwon. Just act at your own pace.

470
00:26:37,340 --> 00:26:39,210
You're shameless and heartless.

471
00:26:39,210 --> 00:26:41,380
Isn't that Ji-oh and Yiwon?

472
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,240
They must be fighting.

473
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:47,020
You didn't know?

474
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:50,650
Sunwoo is the NPC of Hanguk University.

475
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,460
I'm cold.

476
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:54,190
What?

477
00:26:54,190 --> 00:26:56,660
I'm cold.

478
00:27:01,030 --> 00:27:04,900
(WHY R U?)

479
00:27:05,070 --> 00:27:07,700
(A year ago
Freshman Orientation)

480
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:21,890
What did you want to drink?

481
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:23,990
Oh.

482
00:27:25,290 --> 00:27:26,610
(The more I drink it
the more I fall for
Your Eyes)

483
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,780
I'm fine.

484
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:41,800
Senior, the professor is looking for you. Come here now.

485
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,250
Okay, I'll be right there.

486
00:27:43,250 --> 00:27:47,260
Senior, here's your change.

487
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:51,940
Keep it. You can buy me a drink next time.

488
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:53,100
Bye.
