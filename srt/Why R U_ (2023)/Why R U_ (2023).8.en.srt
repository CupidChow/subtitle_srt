(Previously)

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,620
He's not even a key chain. Why does he keep him around all the time?

3
00:00:03,620 --> 00:00:05,170
Why are you straining yourself?

4
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:06,440
If I compromise like this,

5
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:08,500
I'll be making shabby movies for the rest of my life.

6
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,260
Instead of toying with other people's feelings,

7
00:00:10,510 --> 00:00:12,490
you should reflect on yourself.

8
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,190
Isn't this what you like?

9
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:17,230
I've always been loyal. I only like you now.

10
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,590
Then should we... date?

11
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:22,210
Why are you mad at me?

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
If you don't want to get kissed, avoid it.

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:31,990
I saw it in a drama,

14
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:34,750
that when two people look at each other for 10 seconds,

15
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:37,360
they can confirm their feelings for each other.

16
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,680
Ten.

17
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:43,670
Nine.

18
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,810
You have no reason to like me.

19
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:56,800
There's nothing to gain

20
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:01,370
from liking me.

21
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:08,120
Have you ever thought about what others might think of you?

22
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,940
Why should I care about that?

23
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,289
Sunwoo.

24
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,470
Don't you like me too?

25
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:21,110
So what?

26
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:26,090
You're my best friend's boyfriend anyway.

27
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:30,289
I like you,

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,550
but not to the extent of hurting Doyeon.

29
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:42,180
I have nothing to offer you.

30
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:45,770
That's why I don't want to receive anything from you.

31
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,900
You're really calculative.

32
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:56,650
No one will think like you.

33
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,860
I know.

34
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,480
But that's who I am. So...

35
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:09,240
So find someone who suits you.

36
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,310
Who I date is up to me.

37
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,890
You're a good person, so you should find a good...

38
00:02:16,100 --> 00:02:18,100
Before you think for others,

39
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,150
figure out how you really feel.

40
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:27,520
Why did you confess to me?

41
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:30,340
If you're going to be like that, why did you confess to me?

42
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,010
I'm sorry...

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:44,290
that I confessed that I like you.

44
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:04,340
You know that everything you've said were just excuses, right?

45
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:11,800
I wanted to refute you,

46
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,420
but I held it in because of my pride.

47
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,420
You like me, but you don't want to sacrifice other things for me, right?

48
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:32,050
That means that it's not that you're not offering anything because you have nothing to offer,

49
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,980
but that to you, I'm just...

50
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,640
not worth it.

51
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,329
Do you really want us...

52
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,910
to have a relationship

53
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:09,310
where we're indifferent to each other?

54
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:25,300
Let's do that then.

(Episode 8: Ready, Action!)

61
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,980
Oh? Your boyfriend is over there.

62
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,840
What are you doing?

63
00:05:59,630 --> 00:06:00,630
Has he left?

64
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:04,500
My life would be so boring without you.

65
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,710
You're blushing.

66
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:13,650
I'm not.

67
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:14,720
You're obviously blushing.

68
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,630
I'm not.

69
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:24,040
You're shameless until the end.

70
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,110
You were the one who suggested the breakup first.

71
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,960
We signed a contract agreeing

72
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,120
that whoever suggests the breakup has to pay the other a million won.

73
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,140
Give it to me.

74
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,370
If you didn't do anything wrong, we wouldn't have to break up.

75
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:46,540
Is this all you have to say to me... in this final moment?

76
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:49,340
We're going to break up anyway. What more is there to say?

77
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:51,830
It's over anyway.

78
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,600
Then let's pretend I've slapped you...

79
00:07:11,770 --> 00:07:14,800
Restroom! I'm going to the restroom.

80
00:07:20,440 --> 00:07:22,130
Let's break up now.

81
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,380
Have you done your military service?

82
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:55,710
Not yet.

83
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,270
How old are you?

84
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,909
I'm almost 25. I'm screwed.

85
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:03,630
It's not easy.

86
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:21,400
(Jung Yiwon:
Let's practice on our own until the exam.)

(Jung Yiwon:

89
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:29,800
Why won't you let me see you?

90
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:32,210
You wouldn't even see me after this semester's over.

Doyeon.

96
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,410
Didn't your test screening go well? What's with that face?

97
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,030
I like Yugyeom.

98
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,610
What?

99
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:40,620
Go Yugyeom? Since when?

100
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:43,360
I don't know. I'm sorry.

101
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:44,730
Why are you sorry?

102
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,680
Aren't you two dating?

103
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,390
Wait.

104
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:20,740
During the back-to-school party, I confessed to the student council president and got rejected.

105
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:25,960
I wanted to make him regret missing out on someone like me and went back in angrily,

106
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:30,360
but then I saw Yugyeom kissing you secretly,

107
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,000
and you were completely drunk and asleep.

108
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:34,060
What?

109
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,350
So I asked Yugyeom

110
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,520
to pretend to be my boyfriend in front of the student council president just for one semester.

111
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,270
Why didn't you tell me?

112
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,320
It's a secret. How could I've told you?

113
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:53,350
Are you sorry because you think I'm still dating Yugyeom?

114
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:57,370
Woo Sunwoo, you're really kind.

115
00:10:58,110 --> 00:10:59,910
You like Yugyeom,

116
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:02,620
and I think he likes you too.

117
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,250
Now that we've broken up and have nothing to do with each other,

118
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,660
isn't everything settled?

119
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,800
Is there anything you want to watch?

120
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:20,600
Hey.

121
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,320
I have a question.

122
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:28,730
The people who appeared in your novel...

123
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,530
I've already apologized.

124
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,800
I won't use your name ever again.

125
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,430
I'm really sorry.

126
00:11:35,530 --> 00:11:37,510
No, that's not what I meant.

127
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:42,040
How did they start dating?

128
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:45,610
When?

129
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:46,920
Where? What were they doing?

130
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,440
How exactly did they start dating?

131
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:54,890
How? I don't remember clearly.

132
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:01,760
I think you got pregnant...

133
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:02,560
What?

134
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:06,020
Ji-oh found out somehow,

135
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:08,630
so you got married.

136
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,000
You have a son and a daughter.

137
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:14,570
You also went on a trip to Hawaii together, and whatnot.

138
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,080
Yiwon!

139
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:17,140
Yuri.

140
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:18,860
Did you practice well?

141
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:29,220
I don't know. I have to get a good grade this time.

142
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,980
You can do it.

143
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:34,980
Have you memorized all your lines?

144
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,300
Don't be too nervous.

145
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,420
When I say my first line "Let's break up",

146
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:44,720
you should say your line right after without hesitation.

147
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,440
"I was wondering when you'd say it."

148
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,230
Say it right away.

149
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,140
What are you thinking?

150
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,200
Hello everyone.

151
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,260
-Hello.
-Hello.

152
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:58,650
Okay.

153
00:12:58,650 --> 00:12:59,430
Are you ready?

154
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:01,420
-No.
-Yes.

155
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,460
Okay.

156
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:07,500
Okay, then...

158
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,170
Let's see how well they've prepared for their breakup scene throughout this semester.

159
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,340
-Okay.
-Okay.

160
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:24,770
Just do as you practiced.

161
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:33,700
-Let's break...
-I don't want to break up with you!

162
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,920
-Let's break...
-I don't want to break up with you!

163
00:13:39,570 --> 00:13:40,270
What?

164
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,890
You're going to break up with me, right?

165
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,900
I don't want to break up with you.

166
00:13:48,490 --> 00:13:50,620
You're really a wacko.

167
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,570
Fine, just scold me.

168
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:56,140
Don't break up with me.

169
00:13:58,640 --> 00:14:01,590
We agreed to break up.

170
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:03,960
Those are our roles, you wacko!

171
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:07,070
I never said I'd play that role.

172
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,050
I like you.

173
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:16,230
You may hate me now,

174
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,140
but can't you get to know me better?

175
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,930
Don't say things like how we should not acknowledge each other in school

176
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,630
or how we should not get involved with each other after this semester.

177
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:28,590
I'm not asking you to like me right now.

178
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:31,360
So let's just keep seeing each other for a while more, okay?

179
00:14:36,190 --> 00:14:37,790
Please.

180
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,480
Kim Ji-oh.

181
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:47,300
Are you so dense?

182
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:52,570
Let's break up first, for now.

183
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:56,320
We agreed to break up, so we should break up.

184
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,670
Ji-oh. Darn it.

185
00:15:00,460 --> 00:15:02,810
I came to break up with you. How can you be so clueless?

186
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:11,610
I was wondering when you'd say it.

187
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,730
At this point...

188
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:21,250
Darn it. I don't know either.

189
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:28,410
Wow.

190
00:15:29,330 --> 00:15:30,430
Wow.

191
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:42,960
(WHY R U?)

192
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,810
Why are we kissing?

193
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:04,700
I'm trying to get to know you better.

194
00:16:24,990 --> 00:16:28,080
What if you don't get good grades because I ruined the final exam?

195
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,480
Then I'll just repeat the course with you again.

196
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,570
Hey, Sunwoo.

197
00:16:50,590 --> 00:16:51,890
You're so easy.

198
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:54,740
It's a pity he's the only one who doesn't know.

199
00:16:57,560 --> 00:16:58,860
I'm hungry.

200
00:16:59,390 --> 00:17:00,740
What are you treating me to?

201
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,170
If you treat me to something expensive,

202
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,329
I'll make an exception and give you dating advice.

203
00:17:08,730 --> 00:17:09,839
Of course,

204
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,180
it was thanks to your help that things went according to how I wanted,

205
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:15,780
but I made this grand plan myself.

206
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,270
So?

207
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:21,060
If you buy me sushi, I'll tell you

208
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,400
how to make a grand plan.

209
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:24,200
Sushi?

210
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,100
I can't think of anything more expensive right now.

211
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:30,950
Okay, let's go.

212
00:17:50,410 --> 00:17:52,770
Okay, I'll tell you now.

213
00:17:54,350 --> 00:17:55,860
Tell him that you love him.

214
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:58,010
What?

215
00:17:58,470 --> 00:17:59,850
Confess to him.

216
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:01,570
Have you officially confessed to him?

217
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,240
I knew it.

218
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,880
If you don't say anything, how can he know how you feel?

219
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,000
You have to let him know properly.

220
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,060
Do you expect Sunwoo to go into your brain

221
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:13,070
and confirm your feelings?

222
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,600
It doesn't have to be that way.

223
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:21,490
How should I confess?

224
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,720
Sunwoo, I love you.

225
00:18:24,910 --> 00:18:26,910
Although I don't know how I feel,

226
00:18:26,910 --> 00:18:27,810
I like you.

227
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:31,580
People who ask to date

228
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,630
without expressing their feelings are the worst.

229
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,810
Go Yugyeom, it's not that hard.

230
00:18:41,810 --> 00:18:45,270
That's why you've been single all your life.

231
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,300
So what if you're popular?

232
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:48,300
You're impotent.

233
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,170
Hey.

234
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,290
No, I meant...

235
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,380
I meant in terms of dating.

236
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:58,190
Why are there so many people

237
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,430
who can't do something this simple?

238
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,550
Senior.

239
00:19:28,340 --> 00:19:29,090
Yes?

240
00:19:32,850 --> 00:19:33,880
What is it?

241
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:40,850
I have... something to tell you.

242
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:44,370
Okay.

243
00:19:49,340 --> 00:19:50,170
Come in.

244
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,620
What is it... that you want to say?

245
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,090
Senior.

246
00:20:26,110 --> 00:20:27,590
Why did you kiss me?

247
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:29,610
Sunwoo.

248
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:30,400
No.

249
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:54,390
Sunwoo.

250
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,220
I love you.

251
00:21:56,070 --> 00:22:01,880
(I don't want to miss even a second of you.
I want to record a story that will never fade.
When I look back in the future,
all our moments together will be a movie.
Our story is never-ending.
END.)

252
00:22:04,330 --> 00:22:06,340
It's finished!

253
00:22:11,870 --> 00:22:14,380
I like when the end credits roll.

254
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:17,920
Because that's the final piece of the puzzle.

255
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:22,160
(Shiwon and Jiho)

256
00:22:22,160 --> 00:22:22,770
Of course, I like that my name's on it too.
(Shiwon and Jiho)

257
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:25,050
Of course, I like that my name's on it too.

258
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:28,260
Can you write a novel using my name for a character?

259
00:22:30,800 --> 00:22:32,100
You scared me.

260
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:33,930
Write one for me.

261
00:22:37,930 --> 00:22:38,790
(They meet coincidentally and fall in love.)

262
00:22:38,790 --> 00:22:41,060
There is no such thing as a coincidence.
(They meet coincidentally and fall in love.)

263
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:41,730
(They meet coincidentally and fall in love.)

264
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:43,880
All opportunities are ready.
(They meet coincidentally and fall in love.)

265
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:46,480
They're just waiting for you to take action.

266
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:51,590
Prepare for the first scene of our destiny that will start at any time.

267
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,910
If you miss the other person's signal,

268
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:10,260
just rewind it and try to find it slowly.

269
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,840
So don't worry too much.

270
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:15,030
Because you will find your destined one eventually.

271
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,420
How did I fall in love with you?

272
00:23:29,370 --> 00:23:31,800
Did the novel really become reality?

273
00:23:32,830 --> 00:23:34,600
Is it a MacGuffin

274
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:36,520
or was it magic?

275
00:23:37,410 --> 00:23:40,040
Anyway, we can't know yet.

276
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,690
The story is still ongoing.

277
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:51,190
What we can do now

278
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:56,660
is to not miss even a single moment of each other.

279
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:01,560
What if someone sees us?

280
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,570
I want to record a story that will never fade.

281
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:08,520
When I look back in the future,

282
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:11,590
all our moments together will be a movie.

283
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:17,110
Our story is never-ending.

284
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:25,790
Gosh, you're so lovey-dovey. Even on the shooting day...

285
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,160
Let's start the shoot.

286
00:24:36,870 --> 00:24:37,680
Ready.

287
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:39,870
Speed.

288
00:24:40,790 --> 00:24:41,620
Roll.

289
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,120
Roll 1, Scene 1, Take 1.

290
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:44,360
(WHY R U
Director: Kim Ji-oh)
Roll 1, Scene 1, Take 1.

291
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:44,820
(WHY R U
Director: Kim Ji-oh)

292
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:45,910
Action.

293
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:52,690
(WHY R U?)

294
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,120
Did you write this?

295
00:25:21,350 --> 00:25:22,020
No.

296
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:26,950
But your name, my name, and Sunwoo's name are in it.

297
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:31,470
Sunwoo!
