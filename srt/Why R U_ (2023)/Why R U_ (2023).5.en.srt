00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:07,260
Please write a horrendous break up

7
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:10,950
such that they'd never ever meet again.

8
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:12,430
It's infuriating how much

9
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:14,880
that jerk Kim Ji-oh enjoys it when I'm annoyed.

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:15,800
How should I take revenge?

11
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,790
Then do the same. Annoy Kim Ji-oh.

12
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,740
Does Sunwoo hate me?

13
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:31,020
I guess he must dislike you then.

Senior.

15
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,440
Why are you staring at me like that?

16
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,950
You don't even know what I like

17
00:00:39,590 --> 00:00:41,210
or why I'm repeating the course.

18
00:00:42,820 --> 00:00:44,620
Words from people who don't know me well

19
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:46,840
don't hurt me at all.

No one is chasing me, but I just want to run.
It's like I'm running away from you, but it's also like I'm running to you.
Whatever it is, it means we're running on the same track from now on.)

27
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:32,740
I like you.

What?

29
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:38,950
What about you?

30
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,539
Did you just say you like me?

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,750
Did I do something that made you misunderstand?

Yiwon.

Why didn't you accept my Instagram follow request?

49
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,830
Darn it.

00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,700

I don't understand why it's so hard to understand the theme.

54
00:05:07,430 --> 00:05:09,060

55
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,200
No.

00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,620
What's wrong? Did you fight with Yugyeom?

58
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,920
No, it's just bothersome.

59
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,940
Is Yugyeom bothering you?

60
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:30,280
No. There's no reason.

61
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,870
I can't believe that that's possible for you.

62
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:40,710
Why? There are times when I do things for no reason too.

63
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,740
You never say "no reason".

64
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:48,180
It doesn't suit you.

65
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,260

66
00:05:51,670 --> 00:05:53,320
Yes. Cheer up.

67
00:05:55,810 --> 00:05:57,900
By the way, what were you trying to figure out just now?

68
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:00,160
Forget it.

69
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:01,700
Okay.

70
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:10,880
You know that next week's midterm exam
is going to be replaced with an assignment, right?

71
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,060
-Yes.
-Yes.

72
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:15,240
The final practical acting exam is more important than the midterms.

73
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,120
Make sure you start preparing with your partner in advance.

74
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:18,160
Yes.

75
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,080
I'll put up the topics for the final exam here,

76
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,220
so check them out after class.

77
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,450

(Jung Yiwon) (Kim Ji-oh) (A break up)

79
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,170
A break up? That's great.

80
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,970
The greater the emotional range, the easier it'll be to get a higher score.

81
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:50,280
What's so good about that?

82
00:06:51,330 --> 00:06:53,810
Why are you mad? Are you not confident?

83
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:56,780
Others got topics like first love,

84
00:06:57,030 --> 00:06:58,920
confession, flirting phase and whatnot.

85
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,510
Why is ours a break up?

86
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,330
You have to ask the professor about that.

87
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,740
I'm leaving.

88
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,710
Why are you following me?

89
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,110
I'm asking you a question. Why are you following me?

90
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,540
Can't I follow you?

91
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,620
Why must you say it so harshly?

92
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:48,930
What?

93
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,370
When I was eating with Hyunji,

94
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,410
she said there's a gay couple in her acting course who were method acting.

95
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,480
She was angry because she said it's impossible to act better than

96
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:07,870
a real couple.

97
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,340
Who's the gay couple?

98
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,370
Did you go to prison? How do you still not know who they are?

99
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:18,420
It's Yiwon.

100
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:27,690
He's not even a key chain. Why does he keep him around all the time?

101
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,100
What's wrong with that?

102
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,850
I'm no longer surprised anymore.

103
00:08:51,990 --> 00:08:58,040
(The two rush home
(Kissing at the doorstep...?))

104
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,340
The date is set, but when are you going to conduct a location recce?

105
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,060
Um... Why don't we go tomorrow?

106
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:07,460
I'm fine with anything.

107
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:08,240
(Woo Sunwoo)
(Sunwoo, did you get home safely?)
(Good night!)
(Why aren't you replying?)

111
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:11,330
Did he block me?

112
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:17,930
But for the location recce of the school retreat,

113
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:19,210
wouldn't it be better if you two go together instead?

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,380
Well, Yugyeom is a better driver than I am,

115
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,540
and you two are dating, so wouldn't it be more convenient?

116
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:28,020
You're the student council president.
Are you trying to make Yugyeom do all your work?

117
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,540
No, that's not what I meant.

118
00:09:30,030 --> 00:09:31,520
Stop talking nonsense.

119
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:33,270
Let's go together while I'm being civil with you.

120
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:34,910
Okay.

121
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:36,660
Yes.

122
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,870
It would be better for those who are familiar with the student council affairs
to conduct the location recce.

123
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:44,960
You two should go.

124
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:50,530
When should we go?

125
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,490
How about 4 p.m. tomorrow?

126
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,310
Okay.

127
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:58,490
4 p.m. tomorrow.

128
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:17,850
Teacher.

129
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,060
Your phone keeps ringing.

130
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:23,680
Sorry to distract you.

131
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,830
Hurry up and do your work.

132
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,890
I'll wait for you.

133
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,580
Teacher, teach me how to do this question.

134
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:52,980
Oh, okay. This one?

135
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,970
Yes.

136
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,920
I said I'll treat you to something nice outside.

137
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,290
Why are you buying me dinner?

138
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:18,320
Can't I buy you to dinner?

139
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:20,560
You haven't even eaten because of your tutoring.

140
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,880
Why aren't you responding to my calls and texts?

141
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,830
I was in the midst of a tutoring session.

142
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,140
I didn't know you tutored 24 hours a day.

143
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,700
I also have other part-time jobs, so I've been busy.

144
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,410
You work so hard on other things

145
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,600
but you must have forgotten that you've to be my model, right?

146
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,880
I contacted you because of that, but you didn't respond at all.

147
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:45,090
I didn't forget.

148
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,970
I have my camera with me right now. Are you free today?

149
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,150
Yes.

150
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:03,240
(WHY R U?)

151
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:08,670
Sigh.

152
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:14,360
What kind of new torture method is this?

153
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:18,200
You're really something, Ji-oh.

154
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:22,590
I'm not trying to bother you.

155
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,320
Then what is it? Are you following me because you like me?

156
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:31,340
Darn it. Why are you so surprised? It feels ominous.

157
00:12:32,810 --> 00:12:33,740
Don't follow me.

158
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:39,420
Yiwon.

159
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,330
Did he always call me that?

160
00:12:52,060 --> 00:12:53,530
We have to write our midterm report

161
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:55,660
and prepare for our finals.

162
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,640
Let's do it together from now on.

163
00:13:04,810 --> 00:13:07,020
Didn't you hear the professor telling us to start preparing in advance?

164
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,360
Fine.

165
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:15,930
It has to be done anyway.

166
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,830
Let's finish it quickly while we're at it.

167
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:22,590
After this course is over,

168
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:24,360
may we never get entangled with each other ever again.

169
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,470
No, not "we".

170
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:29,490
I meant "you" and "I". Okay?

171
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:00,710
Don't stare at me.

172
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:08,760
What a jerk. I'll never look at you again.

173
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:12,350
-Kim Ji-oh.
-What?

174
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,750
Get that for me.

175
00:14:21,890 --> 00:14:22,660
This one?

176
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,710
Yes, and the one next to it.

177
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,770
This one?

178
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,670
No, the one next to it.

179
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:45,190
Is it this one? This one?

180
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:51,740
Are you teasing me because I can't reach it?

181
00:14:54,190 --> 00:14:55,230
Darn it.

182
00:14:55,710 --> 00:14:57,170
And here I was wondering why you aren't picking a fight with me
and just helping me out.

183
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,560
Get lost.

184
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:21,610
(Stop staring at me, you wacko.
I know it's hard not to look at my handsome face.)

185
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,960
I really won't look this time.

186
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,280
Jung Yiwon, you jerk.

187
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,800
It's not like you'll lose a piece of your flesh from me looking at you.

188
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:37,560
I won't look at you until you call me.

189
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,360
I'll wait for him to plead for my attention

190
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:42,430
before I look at him.

191
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:49,710
Can't I just... take a glance?

192
00:15:51,210 --> 00:15:52,360
It's not a big deal anyway.

193
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:00,190
But what if he asks me why I'm looking at him?

194
00:16:03,010 --> 00:16:03,860
Hey, Jung Yiwon.

195
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:05,940
I'm not looking at you. I'm just looking out the window.

196
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:09,480
Isn't this answer good enough?

197
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:31,340
How could he have fallen asleep?

198
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:09,180
Yiwon, are you asleep?

199
00:17:20,460 --> 00:17:23,030
Sunwoo, can you pose?

200
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:36,700
Are you sure you're shooting?

201
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,740
Of course. You look great on camera.

202
00:17:39,540 --> 00:17:41,200
You've fixed the camera right in front of me.

203
00:17:42,540 --> 00:17:43,790
What exactly are you shooting?

204
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:45,170
Well...

205
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,340
Oh, right.

206
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:50,550
Should I film a documentary next semester?

207
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,060
I have to take this.

208
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,460
Hello.

209
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:07,990
Oh... By how much?

210
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,180
If you suddenly raise the price by this much out of the blue...

211
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,070
No, I'll pay for it.

212
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:17,940
Okay.

213
00:18:21,490 --> 00:18:23,480
Okay. Got it.

214
00:18:28,630 --> 00:18:29,490
Sorry.

215
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,960
What was the call about?

216
00:18:33,970 --> 00:18:35,780
It was the owner of the location that we rented.

217
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:38,010
He wanted to raise the price.

218
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,220
So you agreed to pay?

219
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,650
Yes.

220
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:45,950
Do you have any money left?

221
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,540
No.

222
00:18:48,550 --> 00:18:50,150
If I try my best to reduce my living expenses,

223
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,990
go out lesser,

224
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,530
and reduce my meal expenses,

225
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:57,670
I think I'll be able to make it.

226
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:02,380
Why are you straining yourself?

227
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,420
You can just change the location.

228
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:07,500
There should be a lot of cheap places that fit your budget.

229
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:15,310
If I compromise like this,

230
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,900
I'll be making shabby movies for the rest of my life.

231
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:24,120
I'm poor, but my movie isn't shabby.

232
00:19:50,890 --> 00:19:51,700
Yiwon.

233
00:19:54,890 --> 00:19:55,980
Teach me how to act.

234
00:19:56,810 --> 00:19:57,860
You want me to teach you how to act?

235
00:19:58,330 --> 00:19:59,320
Yes.

236
00:19:59,670 --> 00:20:00,800
Why have you been acting weird lately?

237
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:04,230
Could it be...

238
00:20:04,970 --> 00:20:07,450
If there was even a second

239
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:09,490
that felt like a kiss to me,

240
00:20:09,490 --> 00:20:11,960
please let this novel become reality. You heard me?

241
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,620
What? You didn't bring the script?

242
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:34,230
No.

243
00:20:38,950 --> 00:20:39,890
Let's begin then.

244
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,210
Okay.

245
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,890
I don't want to be a burden to you anymore.

246
00:20:48,310 --> 00:20:51,340
So let's just end our relationship here.

247
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:57,580
Are you serious?

248
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,810
Yes, I'm serious.

249
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:06,380
It's late. I'll get going.

250
00:21:12,810 --> 00:21:14,140
We have to kiss after this.

251
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,330
I heard that actors just regard kissing as a part of their acting

252
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,300
and are unfazed by kissing scenes.

253
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:44,680
T-That'll do, right?

254
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:13,400
What's going on? Why won't it open?

255
00:22:15,410 --> 00:22:17,490
Hey. Can I leave this here?

256
00:22:17,490 --> 00:22:18,390
Yes.

257
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:26,830
Oh, right. Yiwon got a new lover.

258
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:29,670
Gosh, that traitor.

259
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:31,360
Who is it?

260
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:35,770
Do you know the directing major Kim Ji-oh?

261
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:37,130
What?

262
00:22:37,690 --> 00:22:40,530
Oh. The rumors started because they're acting partners.

263
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,380
That's just a rite of passage that all same-sex pairings

264
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,710
go through in Professor Kim's class.

265
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,930
What? I thought it was true.

266
00:22:49,740 --> 00:22:52,530
Then why do so many people believe it?

267
00:22:53,690 --> 00:22:54,660
Because it's fun.

268
00:22:57,770 --> 00:22:59,080
They won't open the curtains, will they?

269
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,480
Didn't you read the BL novel?

270
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,410
If this is really Jung Yijin's novel,

271
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:06,780
we wouldn't be caught.

272
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,700
Instead, we'll be...

273
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:23,030
Why are you two behind the curtains?

274
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,130
Look at how red his face is.

275
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:30,200
What, it's not like you were kissing in there.

276
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:48,270
(WHY R U?)

277
00:23:50,190 --> 00:23:54,620
Sigh. Why are you following me all day?

278
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,400
If you have something to say, just say it.

279
00:24:00,090 --> 00:24:00,940
Yiwon.

280
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:06,920
What should I do?

281
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,470
I like you.

282
00:24:11,830 --> 00:24:14,590
What? Didn't you use to hate me?

283
00:24:15,640 --> 00:24:17,370
Now that you've spent some time with me, have you finally realized my charm?

284
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,290
I understand that, but what can we do about it?

285
00:24:23,070 --> 00:24:24,620
You weren't paying attention to me so you weren't aware,

286
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:28,060
but I've always been a decent person.

287
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:32,970
I understand how much you want to be friends with me.

288
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,270
I have a good temper,

289
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:40,800
so I'll make an exception and be your friend, okay?

290
00:24:42,970 --> 00:24:43,950
Yiwon.

291
00:24:47,410 --> 00:24:50,900
My feelings for you aren't that simple.

292
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:51,930
Wait.

293
00:24:53,710 --> 00:24:54,990
D-Don't say anything.

294
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:59,170
I like you in an impure sense.

295
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:04,290
I want to kiss you and go even further...

296
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,700
You're coming later, right?

297
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,390
Yes.

298
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:21,120
We've to have a drink together.

299
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,930
Okay.

300
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:22,760
See you later.

301
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:25,130
Sunwoo.

302
00:25:25,130 --> 00:25:27,500
The directing department is having a gathering today.

303
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:29,340
You can't make it, right?

304
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:32,990
Are all the seniors coming?

305
00:25:33,370 --> 00:25:34,200
I think so.

306
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,590
Since Yugyeom is coming, everyone will likely attend.

307
00:25:37,370 --> 00:25:40,170
Oh... Yugyeom?

308
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:43,550
Yes, he pays for the drinks whenever he shows up,

309
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,290
so everyone attends for the free drinks.

310
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,250
Is that so?

311
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,480
I have a part-time job to get to, so I don't think I can make it.

312
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,730
Really?

313
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,400
There's no choice then. Got it.

314
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:08,560
Let's drink!

315
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:09,890
Cheers.

316
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,700
Why? Is Doyeon coming today?

317
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:21,120
Why do you keep looking around?

318
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:22,630
You're making it so obvious.

319
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,100
I guess your love for her is getting deeper.

320
00:26:32,990 --> 00:26:35,350
Excuse me. Is Sunwoo not coming today?

321
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,530
Oh, yes.

322
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,570
Sunwoo said he couldn't come because he has to go for his part-time job today.

323
00:26:39,730 --> 00:26:41,780
Okay. Have fun.

324
00:26:42,470 --> 00:26:44,320
Thank you, Senior.

325
00:26:44,760 --> 00:26:45,730
Thank you, Senior.

326
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,810
Hello?

327
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:01,070
Woo Sunwoo. Why is it so hard to contact you lately?

328
00:27:02,810 --> 00:27:04,220
I've been busy working.

329
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,190
Is something wrong?

330
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,240
No.

331
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,440
I have something to tell you.

332
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,750
Can we meet?

333
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:22,380
Really? Where are you?

334
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:25,020
I'm in front of the university's main building.

335
00:27:41,490 --> 00:27:42,310
Doyeon.

336
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,990
You said you have something to tell me.

337
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:47,910
What is it?

338
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
Hey, Woo Sunwoo.

339
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,590
Yes?

340
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:58,830
N-Nothing.

341
00:28:06,860 --> 00:28:07,800
Am I not good enough?

342
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:14,060
What a friendship.

343
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,880
No one is good enough for you.

344
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:28,570
You have the tendency to see me in a positive light.

345
00:28:29,510 --> 00:28:32,230
You've already lost your sense of objectivity a long time ago.
It's pointless asking you.

346
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:37,210
Do you... like him a lot?

347
00:28:40,410 --> 00:28:41,470
Yugyeom?

348
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,810
He's definitely someone I need right now.

349
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,050
Why?

350
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:56,150
Are you jealous because I'm closer to him than you these days?

351
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:58,560
No matter what, I'm still the closest to you.

352
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:00,620
My kind Sunwoo.

353
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,220
Don't tell Jung Yiwon about this.

354
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:09,900
You must not tell him.

355
00:29:10,530 --> 00:29:11,320
Okay.

356
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,940
If he gets mad again, he'll make a scene.

357
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:29,090
(In the next episode)

358
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,590
Instead of toying with other people's feelings,
(In the next episode)

359
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,460
you should reflect on yourself.

360
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,280
Isn't this what you like?

361
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:38,350
I've always been loyal. Right now, I only like you.

362
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,670
Ji-oh... unbuttons his shirt one button at a time?

363
00:29:45,270 --> 00:29:47,990
Why is he unbuttoning his shirt during a videocall?

364
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,290
Yiwon.

365
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,500
What the heck is this?

366
00:29:51,870 --> 00:29:53,100
Did someone ask for your number?

367
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,660
I don't think this is your first time.

368
00:29:56,740 --> 00:29:58,730
Isn't someone like Yiwon decent?

369
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:00,110
What's so great about him?

370
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:02,470
There are so many actors like him.

371
00:30:02,950 --> 00:30:05,950
Then should we... date?

372
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:07,920
No.

373
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:12,770
(WHY R U?)

374
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:19,470
(Move to the recycling bin)
