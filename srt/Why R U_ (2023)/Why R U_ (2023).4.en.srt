(Woo Sunhoo)

2
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:03,460
Why did he keep this?

3
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:07,250
W-Why are you at my house?

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:09,160
You don't seem to remember anything from last night.

5
00:00:09,770 --> 00:00:11,670
You were the one who whispered to me about how you felt like vomiting.

6
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:14,800
You attend school just to annoy me, right?

7
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,200
Now that we're fighting, it's really like Jung Yijin's novel.

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,060
There are scenes like this in it too.

9
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:21,920
I guess he does like her.

10
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:23,680
Is that why he hates me?

11
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,480
What will happen to them? They break up, right?

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:27,900
Please write a horrendous break up

13
00:00:28,210 --> 00:00:31,920
such that they'd never ever meet again.

14
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:34,730
Okay, I got it. Go back to your room.

15
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:35,740
It's infuriating how much

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:37,820
that jerk Kim Ji-oh enjoys it when I'm annoyed.

17
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,460
How should I take revenge?

18
00:00:39,460 --> 00:00:40,350
Honey.

19
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:42,290
Do you want to go and eat your favorite cream pasta?

20
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:46,580
Let's go eat. I'll be good to you.

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:48,620
Is there a kissing scene in what you're filming this time?

22
00:00:49,130 --> 00:00:49,820
Yes.

23
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:52,340
Sunwoo said it's hard for him to direct the kissing scene
because he's never kissed before.

24
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,480
What should we do?

25
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,540
No. 3 and No. 7. Kiss!

26
00:00:56,150 --> 00:00:57,520
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

27
00:00:57,740 --> 00:00:58,960
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

28
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:04,310
Sorry. You must be upset, right?

29
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,080
No.

30
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,140
Then?

31
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,270
Sunwoo.

32
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:13,690
Sunwoo, wake up.

33
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:17,700
Hey, you didn't drink, did you?

34
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:19,660
Since you brought him here,

35
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:21,490
you have the responsibility to send him back.

36
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:24,600
He can't go back alone in this state.

37
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:25,910
I'm leaving.

38
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:36,870
Sunwoo.

39
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:47,520
Woo Sunwoo.

40
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:54,780
Let's go.

41
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,130
Have you sobered up?

42
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:36,240
Is this... how it feels?

43
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:21,329
How it feels?

(Episode 4 Danger Signal)

50
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,270
Can you stop?

51
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,710
Honestly they're all just excuses and there's no reason.

52
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:02,170
What did I do to you that's so wrong?

53
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:05,910
Please...

54
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,130
Get out of my life.

55
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:15,190
You were the one who came into my life first.

56
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,290
You took away the doll I wanted,

57
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,060
showed up when I was kissing,

58
00:04:20,690 --> 00:04:22,690
and begged me to switch courses with you

59
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:24,100
when I enrolled for my course legitimately!

60
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:27,280
Haven't you thought about how you might be the one who's tormenting me?

61
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,520
Jung Yiwon. Admit it.

62
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:36,540
You like me, don't you?

63
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,290
How did you...

64
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,390
When did you find out?

65
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,670
Wow, that was great.

66
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,520
Well done.

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,659
He's my friend. My friend.

68
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,890
Wow.

69
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:25,800
(Hangover recovery drink)

70
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,710
When did he put this in my bag?

71
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,840
A lack of depth will show eventually.

72
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:41,650
Don't just think of first-hand experiences as your assets.

73
00:05:41,970 --> 00:05:44,080
Read more books, keep up with the news

74
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,640
and observe your surroundings more.

75
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:48,870
Then, you'll gain vicarious experience.

76
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:50,720
Think about why I'm nagging.

77
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:55,830
Guys, please read some books, okay?

78
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,180
Keep up with the news too.

79
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,190
How will just staring at your smartphones and viewing social media content help?

80
00:06:01,330 --> 00:06:05,210
I know you're in your youth, but still.
How are all your screenplays similar?

81
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,440
Do you think it's about framing the shot beautifully,
shooting at good angles, and connecting them together?

82
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:10,210
Do you think that's what a movie is?

83
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,000
Why aren't you guys answering?

84
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,410
No.

85
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,240
You're good at shooting beautiful shots.

86
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:19,970
But that's a vlog, not a movie.

87
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,050
That's not a movie.

88
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:24,130
Even if it's just a scene, it has to embody your intention.

89
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:25,890
Then what's the most important thing?

90
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,760
Hey, what is it?

91
00:06:28,190 --> 00:06:30,450
Gosh. It's to convey what you want to say.

92
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:34,170
You need to understand what you're yearning to express in every scene.

93
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:35,060
Understand?

94
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:35,960
Yes.

95
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,290
That's all. Answer the questions.

96
00:06:42,450 --> 00:06:44,500
Wow. What kind of pen is this? It's nice.

97
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,020
Do you want it?

98
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,680
Really? Then I'll take it.

99
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:51,020
It looks expensive.

100
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,040
Have it. I have another.

101
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:54,330
That's just like you, Go Yugyeom.

102
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:56,780
There are many times while studying movies where I had to reflect on myself.

(I want to become the best director and attend film festivals...)

106
00:07:03,650 --> 00:07:06,560
But every time I was shocked,
(I want to become the best director and attend film festivals...)

107
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:08,890
because I don't seem to know myself well.

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,740
I also need to ruminate on myself in order to understand myself.

109

Is there anything I yearn for?

113
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,710
Do I have no desires or no passion?

114
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:29,280
I've never really yearned desperately

115
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,750
for anything in particular before.

116
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:37,280
Hello.

117
00:07:37,570 --> 00:07:38,540
Hello.

118
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:46,930
Dawon.

119
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:47,900
Yes?

120
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,010
Do you want to eat with me?

121
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,470
It's my treat.

122
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:56,860
Okay. Can I bring Soyoung too?

123
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,920
Sure.

124
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:03,100
It might be a feeling that I'll never understand in this lifetime.

125
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,940
If you want something, can't you just get it?

126
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:14,920
Senior. Thank you for the meal.

127
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,230
-Thank you.
-Okay.

128
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,100
Does Doyeon not have class today?

129
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,090
She's busy.

130
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:24,840
She must be looking for locations right now.

131
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,320
No wonder.

132
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:28,100
We're just his girlfriend's replacement.

133
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,220
Yes.

134
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:30,840
Eat more in her stead.

135
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,590
Okay.

136
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,850
You dyed your hair, right?

137
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:37,159
No.

138
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,539
Sorry.

139
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:40,950
Why aren't there grilled beef patties today?

140
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,260
I know right?

141
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,210
I thought there would be grilled beef patties.

142
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,940
This is nice.

143
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:51,050
It must've cost a lot to get such a big place.

144
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:52,990
It wasn't that expensive.

145
00:08:53,530 --> 00:08:55,220
The owner gave me a student discount.

146
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:59,520
Well done.

147
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,720
Then the location is settled.

148
00:09:04,030 --> 00:09:05,820
You're going to ask Yugyeom to be the cinematographer, right?

149
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:08,910
Yes, I think so.

150
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,350
Set a time yourselves to discuss the storyboard.

151
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,040
I'm so busy having to deal with the student council's affairs simultaneously.

152
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:20,430
Lately, I think you've been seeing Yugyeom more than I have.

153
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:25,310
Are you waiting for Doyeon?

154
00:09:28,190 --> 00:09:30,290
Yes, among other things. What about you?

155
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,290
I'm going to read the script with Sunwoo.

156
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,160
I'm going to be in Sunwoo's movie.

157
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:42,720
When did you become friends with Sunwoo?

158
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:45,690
Why do you want to know?

159
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:49,960
Sunwoo, Doyeon and I took the college entrance exam together.

160
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,560
We've been friends since high school.

161
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:54,860
Then you must know each other very well.

162
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,770
Does Sunwoo dislike me?

163
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,100
He pulls a long face only when he sees me.

164
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:08,250
I guess he must dislike you then.

165
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,320
Why does he dislike me? I want to be friends with him.

166
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:14,240
Why?

167
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,130
Even without Sunwoo, you still have many friends.

168
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,370
It'd be good to also be friends with Sunwoo.

169
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:23,400
It's only good for you.

170
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,740
Isn't it greedy to want to be friends with everyone?

171
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,070
Senior.

172
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,420
You act like you have no desires, but you secretly want to have everything.

173
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,220
What's going on?

174
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,890
What do you want to tell me?

175
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:00,850
Be my model.

176
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,460
What?

177
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:06,370
I have to shoot a video for an assignment

178
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:07,500
and I need a model.

179
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,570
I want to do it with you.

180
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,010
I'll pay you well for it.

181
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:13,950
No.

182
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:15,900
Wait.

183
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:19,110
You agree to everyone's requests.

184
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,330
Why won't you help me out?

185
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:25,710
It's not even a difficult task, I'll be paying you well,

186
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,960
and it's not hard work.

187
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,490
Is this a difficult request?

188
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,060
Why me?

189
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:38,070
I've never been a model before, so I'd probably be bad at it.

190
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:41,220
Why are you asking me when you know that?

191
00:11:42,930 --> 00:11:46,210
Why? Why are you being nice to me?

192
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:51,030
Can't I be nice to you?

193
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,760
You can just be nice to me in return too.

194
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:58,150
What do you think? That works, right?

195
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,430
Okay.

196
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:14,680
(Hangover recovery drink)
(Woo Sunhoo)

197
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:17,770
Sunwoo.

198
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,880
How about I be your cinematographer?

199
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,200
Why?

200
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:23,720
Because I like it.

201
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,880
Stop thinking about him.

(Yes! See you tomorrow, Sunwoo
Good night~)

208
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,260
Yes! See you tomorrow, Sunwoo. Good night.
(Senior Go Yugyeom)
(Yes! See you tomorrow, Sunwoo
Good night~)

209
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,410
(WHY R U?)

210
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:19,240
I've lost a lot of confidence in myself these days.

211
00:13:21,850 --> 00:13:22,800
I doubt it.

212
00:13:23,960 --> 00:13:24,860
I'm going to an audition soon,

213
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,320
so just give me any compliment.

214
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,940
Goodness.

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,800
Jung Yiwon. You're an acting genius.

216
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:35,880
Amen.

217
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:37,200
You're also handsome...

218
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,320
Well, you're good at everything.

219
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,460
I trust you.

220
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:50,100
If you're bad at acting, I wouldn't even have asked you be in my movie.

221
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:52,250
So don't waste your time on the audition and just focus on my movie.

222
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:53,740
Continue.

223
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,850
What else? I have nothing else to say.

224
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,580
(Senior Go Yugyeom)
(Where are you?)

225

(Where are you?)

226

(Senior Go Yugyeom)
(Where are you?)

227
00:14:03,140 --> 00:14:03,970
I'll get going.

228
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,240
What? Where are you going?

229
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:17,550
(Short film)
(Yesterday's World)
(Audition Waiting Room)

230
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:21,920
Thank you.

231
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,040
What are you doing here?

232
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:34,540
I'm here for an audition. What are you doing here?

233
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,950
Can't you tell? I'm here for an audition.

234
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,570
Regardless of the result, challenging yourself is a good attitude to have.

235
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,380
Actor Jung Yiwon?

236
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:06,500
I'm here.

237
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:18,820
Hello, I'm Jung Yiwon.

238
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:20,620
I'm 21 years old.

239
00:15:21,110 --> 00:15:23,960
I'm currently an acting major of the Department of Theater and Media at Hanguk University.

240
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,310
Okay, let's begin.

241
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:30,090
I've been living alone since I was in middle school.

242
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,590
Of course, I was poorer then than I am now.

243
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:37,170
I really wanted a burger.

244
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:40,100
Then, I only had exactly 5,000 won in my pocket...

245
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,690
He doesn't look like he can act

246
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:43,640
but he's actually surprisingly good.

247
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,930
Hey, you didn't know that Yiwon's good at acting, right?

248
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,600
He becomes a different person when he's in front of the camera.

249
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:55,340
There used to be a hamburger sold for 1,000 won at McDonald's.

250
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:57,910
So what? He won't be chosen anyway.

251
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,830
I bought five...

252
00:16:00,410 --> 00:16:01,370
Why?

253
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:03,370
The writer only hires actors from the University of Arts.

254
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:05,510
She will never hire someone from our school.

255
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,170
I don't know if he knew this before he came.

256
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:14,020
I feel bad for him because he's trying his best.

257
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,670
That's why I cried.

258
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:21,180
Why are they holding auditions when they won't hire anyone here?

259
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:23,840
What a bunch of scumbags.

260
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:32,300
Your drawing is so cute.

261
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,210
Is that Yiwon?

262
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:48,610
Make it a low angle shot here...

263
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,240
Let me do it.

264
00:17:20,470 --> 00:17:21,369
Senior.

265
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,660
Why are you staring at me like that?

266
00:17:27,349 --> 00:17:31,560
Oh. Well...

267
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
Give me a second.

268
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,370
Hello?

269
00:17:46,270 --> 00:17:47,360
Do you want a drink?

270
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:55,130
(WHY R U?)

271
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,190
Yugyeom, do you have money?

272
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:58,590
Do you want to die?

273
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,520
I brought my wallet, but I can't find it.

274
00:18:01,970 --> 00:18:03,590
It was with me before I left home.

275
00:18:04,970 --> 00:18:06,100
You don't bring your wallet with you on purpose, right?

276
00:18:06,610 --> 00:18:07,330
Is it obvious?

277
00:18:07,330 --> 00:18:08,150
I'm sure that isn't so.

278
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,680
What would you like to drink?

279
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,460
Thank you.

280
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:15,360
You're perfect.

281
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:17,790
I'm jealous of you. That's why I'm making you buy me drinks.

282
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,500
Kwangsoo was friend-zoned yesterday,

283
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:22,630
so he's not in a good mood.

284
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:25,520
You're a perfect senior with a girlfriend.

285
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:26,590
Please pardon him.

286
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,790
Okay.

287
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,170
Hey. Can you kiss someone you have no feelings for?

288
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:33,530
She said she has zero feelings for me.

289
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,660
She did drink that day.

290
00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:38,000
But I thought it was because she likes me

291
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,840
that she kissed me and was physically affectionate with me

292
00:18:40,390 --> 00:18:41,330
and about everything...

293
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,340
Hey. Hello?

294
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:45,740
Yes?

295
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:46,520
Are you listening?

296
00:18:46,770 --> 00:18:47,620
Yes.

297
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:49,600
If she has no feelings for you,

298
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,250
she must have done it in a drunken stupor

299
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,470
or out of curiosity.

300
00:19:03,370 --> 00:19:04,280
I'll get going.

301
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,510
Bye, Senior.

302
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,070
Thank you.

303
00:19:07,070 --> 00:19:08,810
Thank you for the drink.

304
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:16,790
I could've done better.

305
00:19:18,590 --> 00:19:19,470
Jung Yiwon.

306
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,550
I'm afraid you'll have to practice more.

307
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,460
But there's also a limit to improving through practice.

308
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:30,090
Right, you should still try anything you can.

309
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,710
Don't tell me you got a F grade for the acting course

310
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,030
because you wanted to keep practicing?

311
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,590
I didn't even know that

312
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,640
and was so clueless that I refused to switch courses with you.

313
00:19:45,830 --> 00:19:47,950
If you're not talented, you should at least try harder...

314
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,040
Here.

315
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:16,350
You like this, right?

316
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,780
(The more I drink it
the more I fall for
Your Eyes)

317
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,030
I like it.
(The more I drink it
the more I fall for
Your Eyes)

318
00:20:21,030 --> 00:20:21,790
I like it.

319
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:32,820
I like you.

320
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:35,120
What?

321
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,000
What about you?

322
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:45,630
Did you just say you like me?

323
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,730
Did I do something that made you misunderstand?

324
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:06,580
I'm sorry. I won't do that again.

325
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,290
Don't apologize.

326
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:17,790
You don't care about my feelings anyway.

327
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,960
Words from people who don't know me well

328
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:28,580
don't hurt me at all.

329
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,880
By the way,

330
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,950
one day, I'm sure you'll regret not recognizing my talents.

331
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,170
By then, even if you beg me to act in your work,

332
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,600
I will never do it.

333
00:21:52,590 --> 00:21:54,890
If I knew beforehand, would I have been able to prepare for it?

334
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,890
What I can do now

335
00:21:59,890 --> 00:22:04,120
is to either run away or confront it.

336
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,650
It's not an accident if you can prepare for it.

337
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:25,480
Falling in love is an accident.

338
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:39,860
(Jung Yiwon) (Kim Ji-oh) (A break up)

339
00:22:39,860 --> 00:22:42,130
A break up? That's great.
(Jung Yiwon) (Kim Ji-oh) (A break up)

340
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,480
What's so good about that?

341
00:22:44,810 --> 00:22:45,770
Why are you annoyed?

342
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:49,820
Others got topics like first love, confession, flirting phase and whatnot.

343
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:51,400
Why is ours a break up?

344
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,740
Who's the gay couple?

345
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,600
Did you go to prison?

346
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,370
It's Yiwon.

347
00:23:00,370 --> 00:23:03,190
He's not even a key chain. Why does he keep him around all the time?

348
00:23:04,770 --> 00:23:04,820
Did he block me?

349
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:06,530
(Woo Sunwoo)
(Sunwoo, did you get home safely?)
(Good night!)
(Why aren't you replying?)
(Is your phone broken?)
Did he block me?

350
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:16,440
Why didn't you reply me?

351
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,950
I was tutoring someone.

352
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:20,830
I didn't know you tutored 24 hours a day.

353
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:24,220
You work so hard on other things
but you must have forgotten that you've to be my model, right?

354
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:26,330
Kim Ji-oh, get that for me.

355
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,350
This one?

356
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,450
This one?

357
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:32,650
This one?

358
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,730
How could you fall asleep?

359
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,940
Yiwon, are you asleep?

360
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:44,780
Teach me how to act.

361
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,640
We have to kiss after this.

362
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,740
(WHY R U?)

363
00:23:56,740 --> 00:23:58,320
(In the next episode)

364
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,920
This is driving me crazy.

365
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,440
(Hanguk University, Kim Youngshik)

366
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:18,870
Hello. Kim Ji-oh?

367
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:21,530
Are you sure you meant to call me?

368
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:24,020
Do you know why Jung Yiwon is repeating the acting course?

369
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:25,180
Yiwon?

370
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,950
You don't know?

371
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,830
Last year, the professor went on sabbatical

372
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,770
so the school got an external substitute lecturer.

373
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:33,240
But the lecturer kept touching the students while teaching,

374
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,120
so Yiwon took one for the team and stood up for the class.

375
00:24:35,630 --> 00:24:38,290
After that, the lecturer always picked on him

376
00:24:38,720 --> 00:24:40,040
and even gave him a bad grade.

377
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:42,410
What a jerk.
