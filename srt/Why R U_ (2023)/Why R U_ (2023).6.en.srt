1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:00,810
As classmates... let's get along well with each other.

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:02,350
(Previously)
As classmates... let's get along well with each other.

3
00:00:02,350 --> 00:00:02,960
(Previously)

4
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:04,500
If there was even a second
(Previously)

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:06,470
that felt like a kiss to me,

6
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:08,410
please let this novel become reality.

7
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:10,620
Because you keep following me around and pestering me,

8
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:12,770
even the campus cat thinks we're dating.

9
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:13,890
We're dating?

10
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:15,640
Don't you know?

11
00:00:16,540 --> 00:00:19,370
Sunwoo is the NPC of Hanguk University.

12
00:00:19,510 --> 00:00:22,530
When does he sleep if he has so many part-time jobs?

13
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:25,190
Senior. Can you break up with her?

14
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,750
You attend school just to annoy me, right?

15
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:29,590
Now that we're fighting, it's really like Jung Yijin's novel.

16
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:31,960
Sunwoo. How about I be your cinematographer?

17
00:00:32,720 --> 00:00:33,510
Why?

18
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:34,890
Because I like it.

19
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:38,110
Don't you think the novel is becoming reality?

20
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,090
It's infuriating how much that jerk Kim Ji-oh enjoys it when I'm annoyed.

21
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:44,210
I like you. What about you?

22
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:48,580
He's not even a key chain. Why does he keep him around all the time?

23
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:50,400
I'll wait for you.

24
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:52,340
Why do you work so hard?

25
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:53,610
If I compromise like this,

26
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,950
I'll be making shabby movies for the rest of my life.

27
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,170
Yiwon, teach me how to act.

28
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,390
You want me to teach you how to act?

29
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:05,000
Doyeon.

30
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:07,650
You said you had something to tell me.

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:10,550
What is it?

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:13,980
Hey, Woo Sunwoo.

33
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,270
Yes?

34
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:21,490
N-Nothing.

35
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,390
Am I not good enough?

36
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,630
What a friendship.

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,500
No one is good enough for you.

38
00:01:48,289 --> 00:01:51,680
You have the tendency to see me in a positive light.

39
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,810
You've already lost your sense of objectivity a long time ago.
It's pointless asking you.

40
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:59,890
Do you... like him a lot?

41
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,250
Yugyeom?

42
00:02:09,350 --> 00:02:11,290
He's definitely someone I need right now.

43
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,640
Why?

44
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,829
Are you jealous because I'm closer to him than you these days?

45
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,160
No matter what, I'm still the closest to you.

46
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,200
My kind Sunwoo.

47
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,840
Don't tell Jung Yiwon about this.

48
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,410
You must not tell him.

49
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,010
Okay.

50
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:35,630
If he gets mad again, he'll make a scene.

51
00:02:41,090 --> 00:02:43,570
(Lee Jungmin as Jung Yiwon)

52
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:46,400
(Lee Yehwan as Kim Ji-oh)

53
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:49,760
(Lee Sangmin as Woo Sunwoo)

54
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:53,020
(Park Changhoon as Go Yugyeom)

55
00:02:57,110 --> 00:02:58,650
(WHY R U?)

56
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:02,490
(Episode 6 The Failed Confession)

57
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:06,470
Sunwoo.

58
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,170
I want to get along with you again.

59
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,480
What do you want exactly?

60
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:21,810
Why are you so selfish?

61
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,310
I told you I like you.

62
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,810
It...

63
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,360
It wasn't easy for me to do that.

64
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,750
I can't go back to how we used to be.

65
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,930
To be honest, I don't know how I feel.

66
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:02,480
But... I don't want you to be out of my life.

67
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,080
Instead of toying with other people's feelings,

68
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:14,150
you should reflect on yourself.

69
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,580
I think that at this initial part where I ask to break up with you,

70
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,010
you should say your line right after without hesitation.

71
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:40,700
"I was wondering when you'd say it."

72
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,240
Say it right away.

73
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,250
Are you listening?

74
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,190
Yiwon.

75
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:48,330
If it's something unnecessary,

76
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,900
don't say it. Just look at the script.

77
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,180
For the climax,

78
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,380
how about we give each other a slap?

79
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:04,600
Yiwon.

80
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:09,640
Let's make a movie together next semester.

81
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:12,790
I'll make the movie however you like.

82
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,110
Why are you already talking about the next semester?

83
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:17,010
How do you know what will happen?

84
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:19,400
Didn't you say I'm bad at acting?

85
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,150
I'm the first person to recognize your talents.

86
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:24,220
No.

87
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,010
Sunwoo was first.

88
00:05:31,610 --> 00:05:32,470
Yiwon.

89
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,770
Can you please stop calling me?

90
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,110
Do you want to come and hang out at my house?

91
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:51,590
Why should I hang out at your house?

92
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,210
I have the DVD of the film that you want to watch at my house.

93
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,390
We have to do our final assignment together anyway.

94
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,210
You said you wanted to watch it on your Instagram post.

95
00:06:09,030 --> 00:06:10,070
I have it at my house.

96
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,610
Wow, the food here is so good.

97
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,440
Eat this too.

98
00:06:39,990 --> 00:06:42,620
This isn't a date, is it?

99
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:54,780
Let's go.

100
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,770
Why are you paying?

101
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,940
Because I suggested it.

102
00:06:58,630 --> 00:06:59,620
Is there anything else you want to eat?

103
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,040
Why is he doing things that he usually doesn't?

104
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:05,210
He's confusing me.

105
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,400
What's so confusing?

106
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,060
I didn't say it out loud. How did you hear it?

107
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:13,440
You look confused.

108
00:07:14,470 --> 00:07:15,540
I thought you were acting.

109
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:19,310
You looked like the main character of a novel just now.

110
00:07:23,180 --> 00:07:24,140
Send me your bank account number.

111
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,640
I said it's my treat.

112
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,080
Why?

113
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,700
I must get it for you.

114
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:01,400
Sigh.

115
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:04,660
Sigh.

116
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:20,880
Yay!

117
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:33,190
Here. It's for my meal that you paid for.

118
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,169
Thank you.

119
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,220
Isn't this what you like?

120
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,030
Why are you so interested in me?

121
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,700
You were the one that made it obvious.

122
00:08:58,700 --> 00:08:59,940
Soon, even the whole school will know about it.

123
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,130
I tried so hard to get it for you. Why did you hang it on my bag?

124
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,280
I've always been loyal.

125
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,140
I only like you now.

126
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:14,940
It's done.

127
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:20,640
If it isn't the novel becoming reality,

128
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,910
we wouldn't have gotten close so quickly.

129
00:09:30,950 --> 00:09:31,940
Do you want something to drink?

130
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:34,130
It should be your coffee time now.

131
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,890
How did you know?

132
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,320
I saw it on your Instagram.

133
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,470
I guess I should unfollow you...

134
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,790
What?

135
00:09:43,350 --> 00:09:44,210
Nothing.

136
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:55,630
Why did he stick it here like it's a family motto?

137
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:56,220
(Stop staring at me, you wacko.
I know it's hard not to look at my handsome face.)
Why did he stick it here like it's a family motto?

138
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,750
(Stop staring at me, you wacko.
I know it's hard not to look at my handsome face.)

139
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,260
If you damaged it, I'd have called the police.

140
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,050
That's just a scribble. I wrote it anyway.

141
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,820
You'll be famous in the future,

142
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,170
(Stop staring at me, you wacko.
I know it's hard not to look at my handsome face.)

143
00:10:20,450 --> 00:10:21,300
so I want to preserve it well.

144
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,060
Then when there are museums dedicated to you,

145
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:25,820
I'll donate it then.

146
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,200
The phone is ringing loudly.

147
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:03,230
Yiwon knew instinctively,

148
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,660
that Ji-oh was the only one who'd make a videocall at this hour.

149
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,740
When he answered the call,

150
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,920
as expected,

151
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:17,780
Ji-oh is... unbuttoning his shirt one button at a time?

152
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:25,000
Why is he unbuttoning his shirt during a videocall?

153
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:29,650
What are you looking at, you wacko?

154
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,850
Why is he taking off his shirt?

155
00:11:35,330 --> 00:11:37,110
He probably took it off because it was bothering him.

156
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:41,530
Seriously... why are you doing this to me?

157
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,650
Why are you doing this?

158
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,970
Why? Why did you write that?

159
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:50,810
Stop with your dirty thoughts!

160
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:03,190
(Kim Ji-oh:
What are you doing?)

161
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:03,930

What are you doing?)

173
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,990
Ah!

174
00:12:37,830 --> 00:12:38,540
Yiwon.

175
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,250
What the heck is this?

176
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:04,380
(WHY R U?)

177
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:13,610
Why are you always spacing out recently?

178
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,110
Am I?

179
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:18,880
See? You're doing it now too.

180
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:22,720
I guess it's because the shoot isn't far away.

181
00:13:24,330 --> 00:13:25,380
It must be really hectic.

182
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:30,830
Don't you want to date?

183
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,850
Wow. I'm so touched.

184
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,920
You're even asking me questions like this now?

185
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:40,800
What do you mean?

186
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:43,220
You've never asked me about my personal life before.

187
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:45,810
Then, am I considered your best friend now?

188
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,220
I'm the first one, right?

189
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,920
Yay. I'm going to brag to Kwangsoo and Jongho.

190
00:13:58,760 --> 00:14:02,350
Excuse me. Can you give me your number?

191
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,410
Oh, my number?

192
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:12,990
Thank you.

193
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,520
What would you like?

194
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,530
What are your plans after this?

195
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,820
One iced Americano.

196
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:55,040
Did someone ask for your number?

197
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,120
It's 4,000 won.

198
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,930
I don't think this is the first time someone asked for your number.

199
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,260
Here you go.

200
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,100
Doyeon...

201
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:15,740
What's wrong with Doyeon?

202
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,210
It's nothing.

203
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:55,590
Why are you here?

204
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:57,980
I'm here to cheer you on.

205
00:16:00,040 --> 00:16:01,160
Oh. Thank you.

206
00:16:02,310 --> 00:16:04,440
Let's go for drinks after we're done today.

207
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,760
-Shall we?
-Yes.

208
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,900
-Where shall we go?
-Next door...

209
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,060
Why are you doing something out of character?

210
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:17,440
I can't believe I'm witnessing Ji-oh buying beverages for the staff of someone else's set.

211
00:16:18,290 --> 00:16:19,320
Shut up and just drink it.

212
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,640
Of course, one's boyfriend is more important than one's classmates.

213
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:26,380
But he's a classmate and a boyfriend. How precious.

214
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,440
Hey, Yiwon's a good actor.

215
00:16:30,050 --> 00:16:31,280
It's my first time seeing him act today

216
00:16:32,570 --> 00:16:33,490
and he's decent.

217
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:36,890
I've always told you that Yiwon's a talent.

218
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:38,370
It's just that no one really paid attention to him.

219
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,570
He's young, handsome, and even good at acting.

220
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,120
That's rare among actors.

221
00:16:42,570 --> 00:16:44,270
Even if there are actors like that, they don't want to film short films.

222
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:46,640
They're all practicing dancing in basement studios.

223
00:16:48,270 --> 00:16:50,410
I must work with him before graduation.

224
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:52,540
Should I ask him to be in my film next semester?

225
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:54,550
No, it's my turn next semester.

226
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,740
I have something I'm filming that requires a handsome actor too.

227
00:16:58,370 --> 00:17:00,830
Hey, give me Yiwon's number.

228
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,170
I must bait him with a text now to compliment his acting.

229
00:17:06,550 --> 00:17:07,790
What's so great about him?

230
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:13,359
There are so many actors like him.

231
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,730
Isn't someone like Yiwon decent?

232
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm saying this for your sake.

233
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:22,730
Just get another actor.

234
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:26,470
Because of your dating rumors, I thought you two were getting along.

235
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:29,780
A leopard never changes its spots.

236
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,370
His standards are just too high.

237
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,430
By the way,

238
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,190
the film you made last year is showing at a lot of film festivals.

239
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:39,380
If you're that successful, don't just buy us beverages. Treat us to drinks.

240
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:40,840
You're so stingy.

241
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:42,930
How about today?

242
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:44,550
-Yeah?
-Yeah?

243
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,050
Do you want something else?

244
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:09,910
Why are you here?

245
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,270
Because you have a shoot.

246
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:14,900
My shoot?

247
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,070
That's none of your business.

248
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:24,530
What's wrong?

249
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,500
Wow. You're really good at acting.

250
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:35,310
Just be an actor instead of a director.

251
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:48,710
Yiwon, what's wrong?

252
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:52,720
What do you mean?

253
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:55,310
This is how our relationship has always been like.

254
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:57,610
I told you I like you.

255
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,120
Why are you doing this to me?

256
00:19:08,370 --> 00:19:09,790
How do you want me to react?

257
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:13,420
Do you want to see me swear at you and get angry?

258
00:19:14,790 --> 00:19:16,950
I hate you. I really hate you.

259
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:19,900
Are you satisfied now?

260
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,680
Why do you hate me?

261
00:19:26,200 --> 00:19:27,150
No reason.

262
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,630
Don't be perfunctory.

263
00:19:33,770 --> 00:19:36,140
Tell me the reason and I'll correct my faults.

264
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,330
There's no reason.

265
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:48,030
Sunwoo, what should we do?

266
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:49,920
What's wrong?

267
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,580
The guys who went to design the location set called to say

268
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,160
that the owner didn't want to rent us the place.

269
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,220
What?

270
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,090
We've already borrowed the equipment

271
00:19:58,310 --> 00:19:59,820
and fixed the schedule for all our staff.

272
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:00,960
We can't change the date now.

273
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,110
You can't do this out of the blue.

274
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,950
Where are we going to find a venue now?

275
00:20:08,550 --> 00:20:11,900
Can you reconsider it again?

276
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:15,310
Hello?

277
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,080
Hello? Sir?

278
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,250
(Kim Doyeon)

279
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,650
Hello?

280
00:20:39,970 --> 00:20:40,770
Where are you?

281
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,040
I need some time to think on my own.

282
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:47,140
This is driving me crazy.

283
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:51,680
I'll pay for the equipment rental,

284
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,110
so why don't we postpone our schedule for a few days?

285
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:55,220
I'll talk to the staff too.

286
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,810
Let me think about it.

287
00:21:12,170 --> 00:21:14,190
(Sundo Bank balance: 66,820 won)

288
00:21:14,190 --> 00:21:14,280
Sunwoo.
(Sundo Bank balance: 66,820 won)

289
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,080
Sunwoo.

290
00:21:17,870 --> 00:21:19,150
Let's just shoot it at my place.

291
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:26,020
I'm fine with it as long as you are.

292
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:28,500
Sunwoo.

293
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:31,290
Okay?

294
00:21:34,970 --> 00:21:36,090
Then we'll shoot it here.

295
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,750
See you tomorrow.

296
00:21:40,280 --> 00:21:41,110
Please take care of him.

297
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,360
Okay, take care.

298
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:44,900
I'm leaving.

299
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:26,240
Sunwoo.

300
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,270
Do you still like me?

301
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,330
Then should we...

302
00:22:54,630 --> 00:22:55,740
date?

303
00:22:59,040 --> 00:22:59,860
No.

304
00:23:14,330 --> 00:23:14,760
(In the next episode)

305
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:15,930
I'll wait for you to get off work.
(In the next episode)

306
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,090
Let's go to the celebration party together.

307
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:24,800
Is there anyone you like here?

308
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,670
Wow.

309
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,700
Why does he hate me?

310
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:35,230
I don't really know...

311
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:38,070
Where do you live? You should know where you live.

312
00:23:38,670 --> 00:23:39,580
That, I know.

313
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:42,690
But why do you ask?

314
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,000
Kim Ji-oh didn't come to class today.

315
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:45,130
Why?

316
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:46,320
I don't know. He said he's sick.

317
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,990
I think it's a cold.

318
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:50,000
Wait. Just five minutes.

319
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,410
Why are you mad at me?

320
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,750
If you don't like it, avoid it.

321
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,900
I saw it in a drama,

322
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,420
that when two people look at each other for 10 seconds,

323
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,210
they can confirm their feelings for each other.

324
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,190
10.

325
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:19,150
Please don't be nice to me.

326
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,490
What did I give you?

327
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:23,650
That's just what it is.

328
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:33,740
(WHY R U?)

329
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:36,780
(Jung Yiwon)
Are you done with your shoot?
Did you go home?
I'm sorry...
Can you tell me why you're angry?
What am I going to do if you get angry and just leave like that?
How could I know what's going on if you won't say anything?
Please answer my calls...
Do you not want to talk to me?
Did something happen during the shoot?
If I did something wrong, I'm sorry.
Yiwon.)

330
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:40,360
How do you want me to react?

331
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:43,510
I hate you. I really hate you.

332
00:24:46,710 --> 00:24:47,770
How can he just hate me for no reason?

333
00:24:48,420 --> 00:24:50,230
That's not possible! Darn it.
