00:00:00,140 --> 00:00:01,330
How was your course enrollment?

2
00:00:02,090 --> 00:00:03,010
Course...

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:04,300
enrollment?

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:08,150
You major in directing, so it's not a mandatory course for you.

5
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,300
Yes, I don't have to take it.

6
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,130
Because I don't like how you're asking me for help.

7
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:13,980
I don't like the person who's asking me for help too.

8
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,360
I swear to God.

9
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:17,000
If I'm lying,

10
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:21,300
this novel will become reality from now on.

11
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,620
I have something to tell you. Do you want to say it?

12
00:00:23,950 --> 00:00:24,980
We're officially in a relationship.

13
00:00:27,020 --> 00:00:28,220
Did you just say you're in a relationship?

14
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,990
Who got the note with the word Juliet?

15
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:35,090
Hi, Romeo.

16
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:36,030
Yiwon, let's go in.

17
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,410
You know I take this class because of you, right?

18
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,950
What's going on? Why doesn't he smile at me?

19
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,360
Sunwoo used to like Doyeon.

20
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,770
Because you're a NPC, you're even sleeping on the street.

21
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,800
Sunwoo, wake up. You should go home.

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:53,550
Can you break up with her?

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:57,820
I feel like I'm going to throw up.

00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,100

(Episode 3: A Fleeting Moment)

30
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,010
Woo Sunwoo, let's go eat.

31
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:31,370
Oh... I have something to do today.

32
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:34,479
Why are you always busy?

33
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:36,450
Can't you take a hint?

34
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,410
He's making excuses because he doesn't want to eat with you.

35
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,130
That's why I hate people who are good at picking up on things.

36
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:43,590
No matter what happens today,

37
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:45,840
I'm going to eat with Jung Yiwon!

38
00:01:46,210 --> 00:01:47,280
Give it back!

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,240
I'm leaving. See you.

40
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:49,759
See you.

41
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,590
-Let's go eat.
-Okay.

42
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,890
To know your place.

43
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:59,590
Ever since I decided I wanted to make movies, I've never forgotten that.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,230
(Sundo Bank
Mr. Woo Sunwoo's loan interest payment date is April 30.)

45

Sunwoo.

46
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:13,470
Are you free this weekend?

47
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,160
Can you help my team and be our cinematographer?

48
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,730
In most relationships,

49
00:02:19,730 --> 00:02:22,960
in order to receive, you have to give first.

50
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,900
Oh... Okay. I'll do it.

51
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,380
I figured out my own survival strategy.

52
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:34,500
I won't refuse when someone needs my help.

53
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,520
And... try not to receive anything in return.

54
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:42,370
(WHY R U?)

55
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,110
Here's a pillow.

56
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:15,260
I want some water.

57
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,680
What now?

58
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,860
I want some water.

59
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,340
What?

60
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:32,240
Water. Please get me some water.

61
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:38,780
How is he living on such food?

62
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,480
Sunwoo, drink some water.

63
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,310
Sunwoo, drink some water.

64
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,840
(Woo Sunhoo)

65
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,490
Why did he keep this?

66
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,870
You don't seem to remember anything from last night.

67
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:54,510
W-Why are you at my house?

68
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:58,580
You were the one who whispered to me about how you felt like vomiting.

69
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,840
Me?

70
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:27,180
But... why didn't you leave?

71
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,370
I drank too last night.

72
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,250
I was going to go home after I brought you back,
but I couldn't get a designated driver.

73
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,290
I'll pay you back for the designated driver.

74
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,820
Why are you giving that to me?

75
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,680
You came all the way here just to send me back.

76
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:44,780
Then should I pay for the accommodation too?

77
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,620
What's happened, happened.

78
00:07:54,190 --> 00:07:55,180
Aren't you getting in my car?

79
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,850
You've to get to school too anyway.

80
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:02,680
I'll not receive anything from him from now on.

81
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,370
It's fine.

82
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:09,010
Okay. Have a safe trip.

Yuri?

89

What topic did we get?

90
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:01,790
Are you really going continue with this class?

(A scene where you let go of someone who no longer has feelings for you)

92
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:21,970
Right. I'm sure he'll act atrociously again.

93
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,540
Yiwon.

94
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:29,920
What?

95
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,570
Should we not meet tomorrow?

96
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:34,360
O-Okay.

97
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:38,080
Jung Yiwon. Are you not going to take it seriously?

98
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,770
Darn it, you punk.

99
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:49,630
Wow, Jung Yiwon. You're such a go-getter.

100
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,300
You attend school just to annoy me, right?

101
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:56,130
What's wrong this time?

102
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:57,650
Didn't you say you want a good grade?

103
00:09:58,270 --> 00:09:59,880
I'm also doing my best just like you.

104
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:01,130
What are you mad at?

105
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,240
That's because just now, you...

106
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:07,410
What did I do?

107
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,210
Forget it.

108
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,230
Now that we're fighting, it's really like Jung Yijin's novel.

109
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,570
There are scenes like this in it too.

110
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:25,450
What is he trying to do?

111
00:10:26,430 --> 00:10:27,980
How does that hurt you?

112
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,010
Wow. Kim Ji-oh is even good at acting.

113
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,680
I know, right?

114
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,470
What kind of conclusion is that?

115
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:38,450
Yiwon, this is bad.

116
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:41,990
No matter how I think about it,
it seems like an outburst from your inferiority complex.

117
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,770
With Kim Ji-oh's handsome face,

118
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:47,070
he's already stealing the girls you like from you.

119
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,450
Now that you've seen that he's good at acting, you're enraged. Isn't that so?

120
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:51,010
What are you talking about?

121
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,920
I'm way better at acting than him. I'm also...

122
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,780
way more handsome than him.

123
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,440
Even if you think his acting is good,

124
00:11:06,050 --> 00:11:09,210
objectively, I'm more handsome than him.

125
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,070
It's pathetic when you brag about yourself.

126
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,770
You're handsome, Yiwon.

127
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:19,960
If it's not your inferiority complex, then why do you hate his acting so much?

128
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,100
I just hate him.

129
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:23,110
Didn't you say that Ji-oh is taking the class seriously now?

130
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,170
Wait. Don't tell me...

131
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:30,510
you're angry because you're worried you might fall for him in the process?

132
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,150
What are you talking about?

133
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:33,850
I'm really curious,

134
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,670
but how did your dating rumors start?

135
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,190
How?

136
00:11:43,490 --> 00:11:44,790
He's leaving because he's sulky again.

137
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:45,860
Why do you keep making fun of him?

138
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,340
Don't you think you went overboard?

139
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,530
It's so interesting.

140
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,770
There's only a few days left until the shoot. Pick one.

141
00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:55,680
I guess he does like her.

142
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:00,990
Is that why he hates me?

143
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,560
Is there nothing you like?

144
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,150
I'll look around too.

145
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:10,780
By the way, who's your cinematographer?

146
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,430
I haven't decided that too.

147
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,760
Should I ask Yugyeom for help?

148
00:12:19,830 --> 00:12:23,300
What? No. Don't.

149
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,510
Why?

150
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:26,700
What?

151
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:30,190
Nothing.

152
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,300
There's a senior I know that I have in mind.

153
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,260
Really?

154
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:40,260
Then ask him and tell me as soon as possible.

155
00:12:40,760 --> 00:12:42,560
Huh? Okay.

156
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:44,530
Sunwoo.

157
00:12:49,370 --> 00:12:50,560
How about I be your cinematographer?

158
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:52,640
Why?

159
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,250
Because I like it.

160
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:03,800
I like your work too, and your screenplay this time is good.

161
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:12,300
Are you not satisfied with me?

162
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,090
I'll think about it.

163
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:28,680
Sunwoo, do you want to eat with me?

164
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,200
Do you have to think about that too?

165
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:47,080
Yiwon.

166
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,460
Are you asleep?

167
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,840
If this is not a curse, what else could it be?

168
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:11,560
The way Kim Ji-oh looks at me now is obviously different from usual.

169
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:14,560
Why is he suddenly doing things he usually doesn't?

170
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:19,200
Don't you think the novel is becoming reality?

171
00:14:19,810 --> 00:14:22,610
I'm writing the novel based on reality.

172
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:25,130
Gosh.

173
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,330
Delete it!

174
00:14:26,330 --> 00:14:27,000
Hey!

175
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,800
You were sleeping happily in your room just now.
Why are you making a fuss in my room now?

176
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,360
Go away!

177
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,430
Then... tell me one thing.

178
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:37,250
What is it?

179
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,420
What will happen to them? They break up, right?

180
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
Please write a horrendous break up

181
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:46,990
such that they'd never ever meet again.

182
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:52,690
Okay, I got it. Go back to your room.

183
00:14:53,610 --> 00:14:58,420
I have my privacy too.

184
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,650
Yijin's BL novel is becoming reality?

185
00:15:15,710 --> 00:15:16,610
Is that what you're trying to say?

186
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,190
Otherwise,

187
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:20,500
it doesn't make sense why we're this entangled with each other.

188
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:24,700
He's just taking a class with you.

189
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,280
Aren't you overreacting?

190
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:28,850
I even dreamed of him.

191
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,900
Kim Ji-oh's attitude is also getting weirder.

192
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,340
What else could it be but the novel's curse?

193
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,260
It's not a curse. You're just too conscious of him.

194
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:41,800
I read in a book

195
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,620
that if you think about someone too much,

196
00:15:45,810 --> 00:15:47,780
because of the law of attraction, the imagination will come true.

197
00:15:48,790 --> 00:15:50,830
Don't scare me.

198
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:55,050
It's infuriating how much

199
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,870
that jerk Kim Ji-oh enjoys it when I'm annoyed.

200
00:15:57,550 --> 00:15:58,560
How should I take revenge?

201
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,730
Then do the same. Annoy Kim Ji-oh.

202
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:08,890
By the way, you're in Yijin's novel too.

203
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:11,600
Me too?

204
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:15,580
In the novel, Go Yugyeom and you kiss.

205
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,980
Be careful, Sunwoo.

206
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,930
Nonsense.

207
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:31,600
(Scene Acting
Pacify your angry lover)

208
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:33,570
Then do the same. Annoy Kim Ji-oh.
(Scene Acting
Pacify your angry lover)

209
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,400
(Scene Acting
Pacify your angry lover)

210
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:35,650
Honey.

211
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:43,610
Are you mad? Did I keep you waiting?

212
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:48,790
I'm sorry. I was inconsiderate.

213
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,890
Please forgive me this once, okay?

214
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,490
Do you want to go and eat your favorite cream pasta?

215
00:16:58,490 --> 00:17:01,540
Let's go eat. I'll be good to you.

216
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:05,460
Honey, don't be angry anymore.

217
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,680
Shall we go now?

218
00:17:11,650 --> 00:17:12,630
What is this?

219
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,319
I always carry a copy of it with me.

220
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,220
Really?

221
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,450
Let's go.

222
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,349
You're so diligent.

223
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,430
By the way, Yiwon, you acted so well just now.

224
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:24,180
Really?

225
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:25,190
Yes.

226
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,390
Your shoelaces are untied.

227
00:17:28,390 --> 00:17:29,230
Okay.

228
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,590
I'm sorry.

229
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,090
I didn't see you because you're so tiny.

230
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,930
I've used up all my energy for acting so I can't fight now.

231
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:45,200
Get lost.

232
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:47,250
See you next time, honey.

233
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,370
Seriously, what's wrong with you? Why do you keep bothering him?

234
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,390
Because it's fun.

235
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:10,070
(WHY R U?)

236
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:13,280
Drink up! Drink up!

237
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:17,030
Finish it! All the way!

238
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:19,200
Again.

239
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:21,970
Come on.

240
00:18:21,970 --> 00:18:24,240
Will I be the king?

241
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:25,930
I am the king.

242
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:29,570
Doyeon, I said I got it. I understood what you're saying.

243
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:31,990
Let's talk tomorrow. Keep in touch.

244
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,940
You're the last one to draw.

245
00:18:37,680 --> 00:18:40,820
Sunwoo said it's hard for him to direct the kissing scene
because he's never kissed before.

246
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:43,490
What should we do? Should I help you?

247
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:45,650
Senior.

248
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:48,060
I never said that.

249
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:50,310
What? There's a kissing scene in what you're filming this time?

250
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,340
Yes.

251
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,350
He's never dated before but he's always writing about romance.

252
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,220
Sunwoo, it's okay. You can do it.

253
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,100
Why are you talking about this at someone else's party?

254
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:06,410
Oh, it's me! I'm finally the king!

255
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:12,450
Well... No. 3 and No. 7. Kiss!

256
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,660
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

257
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,180
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

258
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,940
That's boring. Your command is always kissing.

259
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,180
Do you really want to see it?

260
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,580
How boring.

261
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,640
Darn it.

262
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:23,100
-Darn it.
-Darn it.

263
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:27,600
Wait, Sunwoo is No. 3.

264
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,010
It's suddenly getting interesting.

265
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,150
Hey, who's No. 7?

266
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,340
Go Yugyeom, isn't that you?

267
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,450
Is it me?

268
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:39,730
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

269
00:19:40,190 --> 00:19:41,320
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

270
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:43,220
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

271
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,230
Sunwoo. You're finally experiencing your first kiss!

272
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:47,330
Such good timing. This must be a blessing

273
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,310
from the directing god.

274
00:19:48,310 --> 00:19:49,720
Enough with that. Just kiss!

275
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:51,360
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

276
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:52,750
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

277
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:53,930
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

278
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,040
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

279
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:56,220
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

280
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:57,750
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

281
00:19:58,190 --> 00:19:59,120
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

282
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,520
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

283
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:01,900
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

284
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:02,860
Darn it.

285
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:05,270
Hey, you can't just do the bare minimum.

286
00:20:05,430 --> 00:20:06,700
I won't leave until you two really kiss.

287
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:08,330
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

288
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:09,580
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

289
00:20:09,790 --> 00:20:11,900
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

290
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,470
-Kiss!
-Kiss!

291
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,800
Are you satisfied?

292
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,930
Hey, Go Yugyeom.

293
00:20:21,930 --> 00:20:24,360
You just pretended to kiss, right? Darn it.

294
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,140
Gosh.

295
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,100
Do you have proof?

296
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:26,980
Come on. Let's do it again.

297
00:20:26,980 --> 00:20:29,890
Put them back. Let's draw again.

298
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,610
Again.

299
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,870
Sorry. You must be upset, right?

300
00:20:41,390 --> 00:20:42,170
No.

301
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:45,450
Then?

302
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,230
Sunwoo.

303
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:52,650
Sunwoo, wake up.

304
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:56,470
Hey, you didn't drink, did you?

305
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:58,650
Since you brought him here,

306
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,320
you have the responsibility to send him back.

307
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:03,410
He can't go back alone in this state.

308
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:04,810
I'm leaving.

309
00:21:14,910 --> 00:21:15,690
Sunwoo.

310
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,490
Woo Sunwoo.

311
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:33,670
Let's go.

312
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:41,110
Have you sobered up?

313
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,310
Is this... how it feels?

314
00:22:58,640 --> 00:22:59,700
How it feels?

315
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,650
(In the next episode)

316
00:23:22,130 --> 00:23:23,050
Does Sunwoo hate me?

317
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:24,340
I guess he must dislike you then.

318
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,560
Be my model.

319
00:23:25,810 --> 00:23:26,570
No.

320
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:29,450
You agree to everyone's requests.

321
00:23:29,770 --> 00:23:31,090
Why won't you help me out?

322
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:33,590
The writer only hires actors from the University of Arts.

323
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:35,350
She will never hire someone from our school.

324
00:23:36,030 --> 00:23:37,870
Why are they holding auditions when they won't hire anyone here?

325
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:44,600
Senior! Senior! Why are you staring at me like that?

326
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:50,170
Well...

327
00:23:50,710 --> 00:23:52,850
If you're not talented, you should at least try harder...

328
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:57,500
I'm sorry.

329
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:59,270
Words from people who don't know me well

330
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:00,980
don't hurt me at all.

331
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:07,510
(WHY R U?)

332
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:27,600
I'll work really hard. I'll do my best.
