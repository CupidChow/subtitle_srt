00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:00,570
Does Sunwoo hate me?

(Previously)
Does Sunwoo hate me?

3
00:00:01,610 --> 00:00:01,850
(Previously)

4
00:00:01,850 --> 00:00:02,940
I guess he must dislike you then.
(Previously)

5
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:03,880
Be my model.

6
00:00:04,070 --> 00:00:04,840
No.

7
00:00:05,490 --> 00:00:06,760
If she has no feelings for you,

8
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:09,170
she must have kissed you in a drunken stupor

9
00:00:09,170 --> 00:00:10,610
or out of curiosity.

10
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:12,610
I like you.

11
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,140
What?

12
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:14,910
What about you?

13
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,800
Did I do something that made you misunderstand?

14
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,130
I'm sorry.

15
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:23,870
Don't apologize.

16
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:26,860
He's not even a key chain. Why does he keep him around all the time?

17
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,000
Do you have any money left for the production?

18
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:28,930
No.

19
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:29,990
Why are you straining yourself?

20
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,540
If I compromise like this,

21
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,540
I'll be making shabby movies for the rest of my life.

22
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:35,700
Yiwon, teach me how to act.

23
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,770
You want me to teach you how to act?

24
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:41,040
Instead of toying with other people's feelings,

25
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,100
you should reflect on yourself.

26
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:44,800
Isn't this what you like?

27
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:47,960
I've always been loyal. I only like you now.

28
00:00:48,370 --> 00:00:50,150
Isn't someone like Yiwon decent?

29
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:51,580
What's so great about him?

30
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,070
There are so many actors like him.

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:32,229
Sunwoo.

32
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,850
Do you still... like me?

33
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:53,960
Then should we...

34
00:02:01,240 --> 00:02:02,190
date?

35
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:06,500
No.

36
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:17,730
(Lee Jungmin as Jung Yiwon)

37
00:02:18,530 --> 00:02:20,650
(Lee Yehwan as Kim Ji-oh)

38
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,880
(Lee Sangmin as Woo Sunwoo)

39
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,120
(Park Changhoon as Go Yugyeom)

40
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:32,660
(WHY R U?)

41
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:36,590
(Episode 7: Between Rationality and Instinct)

42
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:59,720
(Episode 7)
Right now, I should focus on knowing myself.
Because I'm completely different from the person I used to think I was.
I hate the person who's always stirring up my emotions and changing me.
To be honest, I wish he'd disappear.)

43
00:03:02,540 --> 00:03:03,370
Where's Kim Ji-oh?

44
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,340
Why are you asking me?

45
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:13,270
They must have had a fight.

46
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,280
They must have.

47
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:15,180
Yes.

48
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:31,740
Hey, are you crying?

49
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,510
Pull yourself together!

50
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,200
Hey, eat up. Eat this too.

51
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:39,590
Eat this too.

52
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:42,520
-Eat.
-Eat.

53
00:03:51,990 --> 00:03:54,040
I don't understand why nothing's going my way.

54
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,460
At the very least, I should be able to control my feelings and desires.

55
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,630
-Yes.
-My feelings are up to me.

56
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,060
How can I not even be able to control them?

57
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:07,100
It's already embarrassing enough.

58
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:11,200
Why has it come to this?

59
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,020
I told you I don't know.

60
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,029
I shouldn't like him.

61
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,850
But I'm falling for him more and more.

62
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:27,090
After all, you've liked him for a long time.

63
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,700
There's no reason to hate him either.

64
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,100
So it's only natural for you to like him more and more.

65
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,500
But I can't like him.

66
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:37,130
Why not?

67
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:38,980
Can't you just keep liking him?

68
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,530
It's not like you're going to do anything to him.

69
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,420
You just have feelings for him.

70
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,530
Thank you. Please come and get your order when the coaster pager buzzes.

71
00:04:57,080 --> 00:04:58,930
I'm also a customer, but you don't smile at me.

72
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:04,420
Wow. If I'm not ordering, you wouldn't even talk to me.

73
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:06,340
Stop bothering me and leave.

74
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:08,820
I can stay if I order.

75
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,620
I'll wait for you to get off work.

76
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,690
Let's go to the celebration party together.

77
00:05:26,770 --> 00:05:30,630
Great job, everyone.

78
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:39,810
Did you invite him?

79
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:42,870
He bought us drinks to cheer you on during the filming.

80
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:44,470
You must lack a conscience if you don't invite him.

81
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,820
Who said that?

82
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,130
Who else?

83
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:48,440
Okay, next game!

84
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,150
Let's play Spin the Bottle next! Let's go.

85
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,290
It's Sunwoo! Ask him a question.

86
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:05,640
Is there anyone you like here?

87
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:13,900
Why are you asking about that?

88
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,800
I know, right?

89
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,120
Forget that. I'll answer another question for him.
Ask about something else.

90
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,520
That's right.

91
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,520
Okay, okay.

92
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:24,500
Here's my question.

93
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:31,510
Is there anyone you like here?

94
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,060
Answer quickly. Is there anyone you like here?

95
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,120
Why are you asking about that?

96
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,400
You jerk. What's your intention for asking about that?

97
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,159
Why can't I ask about that?

98
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,130
Everyone who got the bottle pointed at them got the question.

99
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,080
Shouldn't you protect his privacy?

100
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,450
Hey, stop it.

101
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:04,260
Take it easy.

102
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:06,260
Protect what and who?

103
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:14,090
(WHY R U?)

104
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:15,740
Yiwon.

105
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,300
Can you watch me practice...

106
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,170
Yuri.

107
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:21,900
Can you look at the script with me?

108
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:25,180
It'll be better to be more restrained with your emotions in this part.

109
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,990
This part's hard.

110
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:52,970
(Ji-oh inadvertently came to the realization that not all love come to fruition.)

111
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:54,460
Are you crazy?

112
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:56,420
Why should we break up?

113

-This is insane.
-A soul destroyer.

126

It's just a temporary breakup.
Do you have to insult me to this extent?

133
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,870
Can't you have a little patience?

134
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,890
They'll get back together anyway.

135
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,450
Who on earth is this person?

136
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:11,050
What is it that you want to say?

137
00:09:14,770 --> 00:09:18,500
Are... you close to Yiwon?

138
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:22,090
No.

139
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,780
It seems like you are of no help to me.

140
00:09:30,770 --> 00:09:31,720
Why does he hate me?

141
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:35,920
I don't know.

142
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,350
Why is he avoiding me?

143
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,100
I have no idea...

144
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:46,900
Hey.

145
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,250
Are you calling me?

146
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:54,440
Where do you live?

147
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,410
You should know where you live.

148
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:03,950
I do know, but why do you ask?

149
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:15,020
(Kim Ji-oh)
(I'm in front of your house right now.
Just once, can you hear me out?)

150
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,680
It's not even the rainy season. Why is it raining so heavily?

151
00:10:36,590 --> 00:10:37,670
He must have left by now, right?

152
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,150
He must have left.

153
00:10:45,840 --> 00:10:47,670
Why did he pretend to be friendly with me?

154
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:51,320
When I found out that he was badmouthing me to the other directing majors,

155
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,150
can you imagine how shocked I was?

156
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:56,580
I see.

157
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,490
Come on, listen to me.

158
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:04,790
Was he being nice to me to annoy me?

159
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:06,570
So that it would hurt twice as much in the future?

160
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,220
A twofold blow is intense indeed.

161
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,490
If you keep being so perfunctory,

162
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:15,740
I'll hate you more than Kim Ji-oh.

163
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,820
Wow, he's such a jerk.

164
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,330
I told you not to get involved with a wacko like Kim Ji-oh.

165
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,190
Look at his eyes. Do they look normal?

166
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:28,160
He always puts on a rude face.

167
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:29,870
Every time he speaks, he always gets on my nerves.

168
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:33,910
He's not that bad.

169
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:37,550
He just looks cold. That's why people misunderstand.

170
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,610
He looks kind when he smiles.

171
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:41,380
And if he said something annoying,

172
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:42,660
it must be because someone annoyed him.

173
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:46,700
Darn it. This is the problem with couples.

174
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,730
You're still defending your boyfriend.

175
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,040
He's not my boyfriend.

176
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:54,530
Sunwoo!

177
00:11:54,530 --> 00:11:55,680
He's not our friend.

178
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,880
He's always on his boyfriend's side. So annoying.

179
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,120
Let's ignore him.

180
00:11:59,380 --> 00:12:00,600
I told you he's not my boyfriend.

181
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,070
Kim Ji-oh didn't come to class today.

182
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,520
Why?

183
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,310
I don't know. They said he's sick. I think it's a cold.

184
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,600
Sunwoo, hand me a pen.

185
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:25,210
Hey, Kim Ji-oh. Are you in there?

186
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,560
Hang on. Give me five minutes.

187
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,100
Open the door.

188
00:12:56,110 --> 00:12:59,050
Why didn't you come out yesterday? I was waiting for you.

189
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,940
Why did you wait for me? You should have gone home when it was raining.

190
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,740
I thought you might come out to see me.

191
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:12,140
If you came out...

192
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:16,060
but I wasn't there, you might be disappointed.

193
00:13:18,650 --> 00:13:20,110
So what did you want to say?

194
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,280
Why are you mad at me?

195
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,910
I want to know what you're thinking.

196
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,190
Hey, Kim Ji-oh.

197
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,730
I'm not one to beat around the bush.

198
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:38,890
So I'll just be straightforward.

199
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:41,400
On the day I was filming for Sunwoo's short film,

200
00:13:43,050 --> 00:13:44,560
why did you badmouth me to the other directing majors?

201
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:46,920
What?

202
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:49,780
You say you like me to my face but you're badmouthing me behind my back.

203
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:54,180
Do you have such a horrible personality that it's affected your character?

204
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:56,160
Why are you blowing hot and cold?

205
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:57,730
Which one is the real you?

206
00:14:00,210 --> 00:14:01,160
Are you angry because of this?

207
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,730
Of course I am.

208
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,160
You were so excited when you were criticizing my acting.

209
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,340
No, that's because those jerks...

210
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:14,810
No, that's because they were so eager to work with you.

211
00:14:15,660 --> 00:14:16,890
I want to work with you too.

212
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,420
I was the first one to ask you to work with me

213
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:22,200
but you didn't give me a response.

214
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:25,970
Instead, you just said you didn't want to get involved with me after this semester.

215
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,910
Darn it.

216
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:34,410
Still, is that enough reason for you to go around and badmouth me?

217
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,710
You're insane.

218
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,170
Just because you can't have it, you don't want anyone else to have it?

219
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,380
How can you be so spiteful?

220
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm sorry.

221
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,710
Are you leaving?

222
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,230
If you're done eating, just go to sleep.

223
00:15:14,150 --> 00:15:15,030
Do you still hate me?

224
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,640
Why do you hate me?

225
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,980
Then why do you suddenly like me?

226
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,860
There's no reason.

227
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:31,480
That can't be it.

228
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,340
It's all my fault.

229
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:39,550
I kept talking about it and manifested it. I should have watched my words.

230
00:15:40,870 --> 00:15:41,940
What did you say?

231
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,490
I said that we didn't kiss.

232
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:47,670
That if there was even a second that felt like a kiss to me,

233
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,420
Yijin's BL novel would become reality.

234
00:15:56,110 --> 00:16:00,120
Are you saying that I like you because the novel came true?

235
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,010
What else could it be?

236
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:06,450
There's no way you'd suddenly fall for me after fighting all the time with me.

237
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:12,500
Do you really want this all to just be because of the novel?

238
00:16:18,730 --> 00:16:19,780
Really?

239
00:16:38,830 --> 00:16:39,790
Yiwon.

240
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,610
If you don't want to get kissed, avoid it.

241
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,200
(Sunwoo, write the screenplay)

242
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:47,210
Jung Yiwon looks great on camera.

243
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,670
You didn't go home?

244
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,610
Yes, I went to a student council meeting.

245
00:17:53,670 --> 00:17:54,780
I also stole this.

246
00:17:57,490 --> 00:17:58,620
Isn't this embezzlement of the student council fees?

247
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,840
It's fine as long as you don't say a thing.

248
00:18:15,250 --> 00:18:16,230
Why are you so pale?

249
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,170
Are you sick?

250
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:22,750
Is something bothering you?

251
00:18:25,630 --> 00:18:26,830
Do whatever you want.

252
00:18:28,060 --> 00:18:30,320
You always think for others.

253
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:33,140
You know it's meaningless, right?

254
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:38,700
No matter how kind a person is, they still have to prioritize their own benefits in the end.

255
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:44,430
I don't know what I want to do.

256
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:46,150
Don't lie to me.

257
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:49,300
You're just pretending not to know.

258
00:18:49,510 --> 00:18:50,450
You know that.

259
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,900
Just do it. Do whatever you want.

260
00:18:56,670 --> 00:18:57,800
But I just can't...

261
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:16,090
Are you waiting for someone's call?

262
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,020
Well,

263
00:19:20,380 --> 00:19:22,520
why do you never get the calls you're waiting for?

264
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,340
I can't believe you have calls you're waiting for.

265
00:19:24,870 --> 00:19:25,770
Is it Doyeon?

266
00:19:28,620 --> 00:19:29,720
I broke up with her a long time ago.

267
00:19:31,470 --> 00:19:32,470
Just call her.

268
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,650
What? You broke up?

269
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:38,790
The problem is I'm always the one taking the initiative.

270
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,150
What? Take the initiative for what?

271
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,030
I'm leaving.

272
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:47,150
Hey.

273
00:19:49,650 --> 00:19:50,790
Hey, Go Yugyeom.

274
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,050
There's no use avoiding me. You're a NPC with a fixed routine

275
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,090
so I know where you are at all times.

276
00:20:17,510 --> 00:20:18,370
The straw...

277
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:19,380
You want me to get it from there?

278
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,970
Get it from there.

279
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,440
I'll wait for you to get off work.

280
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,250
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

281
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:40,800
-Enjoy your drinks.
-Okay.

282
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,940
(Notice of class cancellation
Please take note that today's Scene Acting class is cancelled.)

283
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,320
Why am I so forgetful?

284
00:21:00,730 --> 00:21:03,320
(Kim Ji-oh)

285
00:21:30,830 --> 00:21:31,660
Sunwoo.

286
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:52,640
Woo Sunwoo.

287
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,670
Senior.

288
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:24,410
Yes?

289
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,430
I saw it in a drama,

290
00:22:29,370 --> 00:22:30,630
that when two people look at each other for 10 seconds,

291
00:22:32,430 --> 00:22:34,350
they can confirm their feelings for each other.

292
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:40,200
If nothing happens within ten seconds,

293
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,810
it means there's nothing between them.

294
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,670
If someone looks away first...

295
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,000
no matter what the reason is, it means he feels something for the other.

296
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:06,140
Ten.

297
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,990
Nine.

298
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:14,950
Eight.

299
00:23:19,050 --> 00:23:20,100
Seven.

300
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,210
Six.

301
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:58,630
Don't come to me again from now on.

302
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,230
Don't acknowledge me in school

303
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,970
or come to my part-time job.

304
00:24:08,620 --> 00:24:09,580
Sunwoo.

305
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:12,380
Do you think I'm a pushover because I like you?

306
00:24:14,290 --> 00:24:15,440
How could you say that?

307
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,510
Or do you pity me?

308
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,340
Do you think I'm nice to you because I pity you?

309
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,510
Senior, you've...

310
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:27,470
always been considerate and rich,

311
00:24:29,250 --> 00:24:31,270
so you may have no ulterior motives when you help people.

312
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,520
But I've lived my entire life thinking in the opposite manner,

313
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,850
so I'm always mistaking your generosity for something more than just kindness.

314
00:24:42,550 --> 00:24:43,790
Please don't be nice to me.

315
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:46,490
What did I help you with?

316
00:24:49,690 --> 00:24:51,120
You refused all the help I tried to give you.

317
00:24:55,170 --> 00:24:57,340
You never listen to me. What are you worried about?

318
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:04,070
Why would I help people without a purpose?

319
00:25:06,920 --> 00:25:07,990
That's funny.

320
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,960
I'm nice to you because I like you.

321
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:22,070
You have no reason to like me.

322
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,860
There's nothing to gain

323
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,460
from liking me.

324
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,520
Have you ever thought about what others might think of you?

325
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,940
Why should I care about that?

326
00:25:44,670 --> 00:25:45,670
Sunwoo.

327
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:49,630
Don't you like me too?

328
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:52,530
So what?

329
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:57,220
You're my best friend's boyfriend anyway.

330
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,390
I like you,

331
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,550
but not to the extent of hurting Doyeon.

332
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,360
I have nothing to offer you.

333
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,880
That's why I don't want to receive anything from you.

334
00:26:22,770 --> 00:26:24,040
You're really calculative.

335
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,000
No one will think like you.

336
00:26:32,290 --> 00:26:33,630
I know.

337
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,440
But that's who I am. So...

338
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,980
So find someone who suits you.

339
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:42,590
Who I date is up to me.

340
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:45,200
You're a good person, so you should find a good...

341
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:49,270
Before... you think for others,

342
00:26:50,620 --> 00:26:52,180
figure out how you really feel.

343
00:26:57,410 --> 00:26:58,770
Why did you confess to me?

344
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:01,310
If you're going to be like that, why did you confess to me?

345
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,060
I'm sorry...

346
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:15,880
that I confessed that I like you.

347
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:35,240
You know everything you've said were just excuses, right?

348
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:42,940
I wanted to refute you,

349
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:46,340
but I held it in because of my pride.

350
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:53,480
You like me, but you don't want to sacrifice other things for me, right?

351
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,000
That means that it's not that you're not offering anything because you have nothing to offer,

352
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,110
but that to you, I'm just...

353
00:28:09,420 --> 00:28:10,900
not worth it.

354
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:30,390
Do you really want us...

355
00:28:33,510 --> 00:28:34,840
to have a relationship

356
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,240
where we're indifferent to each other?

357
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,920
Let's do that then.

358
00:29:12,070 --> 00:29:12,170
(In the next episode)

359
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:13,970
Oh? Your boyfriend is over there.
(In the next episode)

360
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,080
(In the next episode)

361
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:20,080
Then let's pretend I've slapped you...

362
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,350
Jung Yiwon and Kim Ji-oh.

363
00:29:35,860 --> 00:29:36,870
Let's see how well

364
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:39,570
you've prepared for the breakup scene throughout this semester.

365
00:29:40,090 --> 00:29:41,270
-I don't...
-I don't want to break up with you!

366
00:29:41,590 --> 00:29:43,860
Ji-oh. Darn it.

367
00:29:44,890 --> 00:29:45,790
I came here to break up with you.

368
00:29:45,790 --> 00:29:47,060
How can you be so clueless?

369
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:48,260
I love you.
