1
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:12,762
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

2
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,058
What should we do?

3
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:46,481
We will make sure
Your Royal Highness can get out of here.

4
00:01:46,898 --> 00:01:48,525
Are you saying I should sacrifice everyone

5
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:50,360
just so that I can survive?

6
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:51,653
I cannot do that.

7
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:52,779
Your Royal Highness.

8
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,533
Someone has to get out of the palace...

9
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:00,078
and let the people know.

10
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:32,986
Fire. They are afraid of fire!

11
00:03:10,732 --> 00:03:12,609
Are you watching this now, Father?

12
00:03:16,988 --> 00:03:18,114
I did not...

13
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,995
let anyone steal the throne from me.

14
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,959
The rear garden
isn't far from this building.

15
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,172
We cannot go to the main gate,
but we may be able to escape that way.

16
00:04:59,007 --> 00:05:00,550
There is no time to lose.

17
00:05:00,633 --> 00:05:02,552
Let us escort you to the rear garden.

18
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,852
The rear garden...

19
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,528
How many bullets are left?

20
00:05:20,611 --> 00:05:24,365
We can't take down all of them even if
we use all the bullets that we have left.

21
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,161
It is not for them.

22
00:05:41,424 --> 00:05:43,301
If we use ourselves as bait,

23
00:05:43,551 --> 00:05:45,136
it may work.

24
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,452
Don't look down!

25
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,067
We should hurry.

26
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,876
All the palace gates are sealed off.

27
00:09:49,547 --> 00:09:50,673
What on earth...

28
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:53,968
is happening inside the palace?

29
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:47,021
Both in Dongnae...

30
00:10:47,938 --> 00:10:49,231
and Sangju,

31
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:51,901
we could not stop the plague.

32
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:55,446
This time, we will stop it.

33
00:10:56,739 --> 00:10:58,199
We must stop it at all costs.

34
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,211
We must do it now. Shoot!

35
00:13:19,965 --> 00:13:22,176
Get off me. Go away!

36
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,553
Stay away. Stay away, I said!

37
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:25,888
Don't come--

38
00:18:53,507 --> 00:18:54,925
How come we're alive?

39
00:18:55,801 --> 00:18:57,010
We were bitten by them too.

40
00:18:57,803 --> 00:19:00,681
I do not know what happened either.

41
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:49,396
We greet you, Your Royal Highness.

42
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:54,234
We greet you, Your Royal Highness.

43
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:58,363
You Royal Highness, are you all right?

44
00:19:59,531 --> 00:20:01,617
What on earth happened inside the palace?

45
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:04,244
Summon all the soldiers
at the fortress walls

46
00:20:04,328 --> 00:20:05,913
back to the palace.

47
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,122
We must hurry.

48
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:20,427
Did you get all the bodies
out of the reservoir?

49
00:20:20,594 --> 00:20:21,470
Yes, sir.

50
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:46,620
Seo-bi...

51
00:20:58,590 --> 00:21:01,718
The plague spread in the palace?

52
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,220
Who survived?

53
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:08,767
Did everyone die except for those
who survived with Your Royal Highness?

54
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:13,313
Including Her Majesty...

55
00:21:14,314 --> 00:21:16,066
and all the ministers?

56
00:21:16,149 --> 00:21:17,192
Yes.

57
00:21:20,821 --> 00:21:21,863
What is it?

58
00:21:23,198 --> 00:21:25,659
The Prince's corpse
is nowhere to be found.

59
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:28,912
We have to find him.

60
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:31,873
We must find him, no matter what.

61
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:34,710
There are palace guards
who left the citadel.

62
00:21:34,793 --> 00:21:37,504
Also, most of the magistrates
in the countryside

63
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,172
are supporters of the Haewon Cho Clan.

64
00:21:39,756 --> 00:21:41,216
If the Prince is alive,

65
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:44,761
those who support him will be sure
to revolt sometime in the future.

66
00:21:45,470 --> 00:21:47,097
The newborn Prince must be killed...

67
00:21:47,889 --> 00:21:51,476
for Your Royal Highness to survive.

68
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,196
YEONGYEONG GATE

69
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:01,463
This place...

70
00:23:04,925 --> 00:23:07,177
enshrines the portraits
of the former kings...

71
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,932
from whom my royal blood is inherited.

72
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,559
Here, their portraits...

73
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:17,896
are kept on the throne
just like when they were alive.

74
00:23:18,313 --> 00:23:20,232
And we also perform
ancestral rites here...

75
00:23:22,401 --> 00:23:24,361
to honor them.

76
00:23:24,861 --> 00:23:27,447
There were two shrines
awaiting their owners.

77
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,121
One was for my father,

78
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:36,289
and the last one...

79
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:42,754
This one was for me.

80
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,260
Hence,

81
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:52,681
you shall get out of there at once.

82
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:20,417
Let me see the baby.

83
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,464
I said let me see him.

84
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,184
Was he bitten by the monsters?

85
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:40,103
He did get bitten,
but this child is not a monster.

86
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:42,397
Please believe me.

87
00:24:42,481 --> 00:24:44,733
This child did not catch the plague.

88
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,360
You mustn't kill him.

89
00:24:49,362 --> 00:24:53,283
Your Royal Highness, I am sure
you also wish to spare his life.

90
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:56,453
Your Royal Highness told me...

91
00:24:57,913 --> 00:25:00,040
to keep this child safe.

92
00:25:00,123 --> 00:25:01,583
Go to the Queen's Palace...

93
00:25:02,375 --> 00:25:03,877
and keep an eye on the child.

94
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,172
The newborn Prince, Your Royal Highness?

95
00:25:08,006 --> 00:25:10,133
There is something I must tell
Your Royal Highness.

96
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,719
It is about the Queen and her newborn son.

97
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:15,722
The child is--

98
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:17,224
Mu-yeong's son...

99
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:22,020
I heard he was taken
to the Queen's Palace.

100
00:25:23,563 --> 00:25:24,439
So...

101
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:28,860
I'd like you to protect him.

102
00:25:30,445 --> 00:25:34,658
Your Royal Highness said
that no one else should be hurt.

103
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:38,161
So please spare this child's life.

104
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:40,914
The plague will be brought to an end.

105
00:25:41,206 --> 00:25:43,250
When winter gives way to spring,

106
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,085
this nightmare...

107
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,546
will end as well.

108
00:25:58,515 --> 00:25:59,641
No.

109
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,353
As long as this child is alive,

110
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,524
this catastrophe will not end.

111
00:26:12,237 --> 00:26:14,656
HONGCHI GATE

112
00:26:15,949 --> 00:26:19,244
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

113
00:26:19,327 --> 00:26:22,706
3 MONTHS LATER

114
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:04,789
JONGMYO SHRINE, 7 YEARS LATER

115
00:27:12,005 --> 00:27:13,882
Begin!

116
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,678
Your Majesty.

117
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:49,394
It is now time to return.

118
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,700
I heard Your Majesty asked to see

119
00:29:03,783 --> 00:29:05,785
the historians' records
from seven years ago.

120
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,663
But were you not well aware of the fact...

121
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:11,666
that the historical records
cannot be disclosed to anyone,

122
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:13,752
including the kings?

123
00:29:13,835 --> 00:29:16,087
No one tells me what happened.

124
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:21,843
Seven years ago, both of my parents,
as well as my only brother,

125
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,430
passed away due to the plague.

126
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:29,058
The plague also killed
all of their court ladies.

127
00:29:29,559 --> 00:29:32,353
But neither you nor Uncle...

128
00:29:33,521 --> 00:29:36,316
As a matter of fact,
no one tells me anything about them,

129
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,819
so whom should I ask?

130
00:29:46,534 --> 00:29:48,745
The royal lecture will begin shortly.

131
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:55,043
Everything you see and hear will help
this country thrive.

132
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,545
Your Majesty, the more you learn,
the better you can lead

133
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:59,756
the royal court and look after
the people of Joseon.

134
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,847
Escort His Majesty.

135
00:30:17,232 --> 00:30:20,527
It seems that the King misses his parents
more and more by the day.

136
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:21,903
He will be...

137
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,823
immensely shocked if he finds out

138
00:30:25,156 --> 00:30:26,699
how his parents passed away.

139
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,577
We must make sure
His Majesty never finds out.

140
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,630
HANYANG

141
00:30:48,847 --> 00:30:50,682
Wait, halt!

142
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,811
Yeong-sin? It's you, right?

143
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:56,938
It's been a long time,

144
00:30:58,147 --> 00:30:59,148
my lord.

145
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,617
I said you may talk casually to me.

146
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,578
Just consider me a friend.

147
00:31:11,661 --> 00:31:12,954
You shouldn't drink more.

148
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:14,372
You've already had quite a bit.

149
00:31:14,914 --> 00:31:16,124
I am only drinking this much

150
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:17,917
because it is with you.

151
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:21,462
Just talk to me casually, will you?

152
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:25,592
All right, I will.

153
00:31:26,342 --> 00:31:29,262
I'm the Second State Councillor.

154
00:31:29,637 --> 00:31:33,016
Look! This punk is being disrespectful
to the Second State Councillor!

155
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:35,310
I'm glad you brought that up.

156
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,688
One of the highest-ranking officials
is devouring his food so greedily.

157
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:39,898
How crude.

158
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:44,444
You're right.

159
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:46,863
How did I even obtain
such a high position?

160
00:31:47,196 --> 00:31:50,283
Even for the magistrate position
in Dongnae, I only accepted it

161
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,662
because my uncle threatened
that he'd turn me into a eunuch otherwise.

162
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,873
But I'm the Second State Councillor now.

163
00:31:58,333 --> 00:32:01,628
There are so many responsibilities
that come with the position.

164
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:03,379
I also have to look proper at all times.

165
00:32:03,463 --> 00:32:05,465
In fact, I never even have time
to drink like this.

166
00:32:08,051 --> 00:32:11,346
Order is being restored in this country
thanks to your hard work.

167
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:13,473
The people in Gyeongsang have managed...

168
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,142
to overcome the disaster as well.

169
00:32:16,893 --> 00:32:18,102
I saw it with my own eyes.

170
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,480
Enough.

171
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,776
Come on. Must I discuss
such serious matters even with you?

172
00:32:25,151 --> 00:32:26,402
Let's just enjoy our wine.

173
00:32:32,909 --> 00:32:35,578
His Majesty is doing well, right?

174
00:32:40,416 --> 00:32:42,043
He is growing up well indeed.

175
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:43,628
Despite his young age,

176
00:32:43,711 --> 00:32:45,838
he's already finished
The Four Books and Three Classics.

177
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:49,425
I'm sure he'll grow up to be a sage-king.
I have no doubt about it.

178
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,055
I'll do my best to assist him.

179
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:57,433
It was His Royal Highness's
earnest wish, you know.

180
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:26,004
Can I trust you?

181
00:33:27,088 --> 00:33:28,506
Are you sure that this child...

182
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,426
did not catch the disease?

183
00:33:32,093 --> 00:33:33,511
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

184
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:37,306
The monsters bit his hands and feet.
When I dipped them in water,

185
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,808
all the worms came out.

186
00:33:39,475 --> 00:33:41,394
This child is free of the disease.

187
00:33:41,477 --> 00:33:42,979
You must not spare his life.

188
00:33:43,896 --> 00:33:46,816
The newborn Prince
is the legitimate heir to the throne.

189
00:33:47,608 --> 00:33:49,235
Sparing his life...

190
00:33:49,944 --> 00:33:52,363
will bring utter chaos upon this kingdom.

191
00:33:55,366 --> 00:33:58,453
Only one prince can succeed to the throne.

192
00:33:58,953 --> 00:34:00,371
Please kill him at once.

193
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,378
You are right.

194
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:11,215
Between he and I,

195
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:14,761
one of us must die.

196
00:34:19,057 --> 00:34:20,016
However,

197
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,563
which one of us truly deserves to die?

198
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,068
He's a prince and the sole legitimate heir
to the throne,

199
00:34:31,027 --> 00:34:32,070
whereas I am...

200
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,032
a beheader of my own father,

201
00:34:38,034 --> 00:34:40,411
a bastard son
who is guilty of high treason.

202
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,917
If you must choose one
between the two of us,

203
00:34:49,837 --> 00:34:52,632
and if I ask you
which one of us this war-torn,

204
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,426
plague-ravaged country needs more,

205
00:34:57,261 --> 00:34:59,555
whom will you choose?

206
00:35:04,852 --> 00:35:06,062
This child...

207
00:35:07,146 --> 00:35:09,565
is the only hope this kingdom has left.

208
00:35:10,233 --> 00:35:12,610
Now that all the evildoers
who were trying to use him

209
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:14,612
to seize power have been exterminated,

210
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:18,324
you should...

211
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:23,162
guide the Prince...

212
00:35:25,748 --> 00:35:28,209
so that he can become a good king.

213
00:35:42,014 --> 00:35:43,474
I firmly trust you...

214
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:47,770
as well as...

215
00:35:49,355 --> 00:35:51,607
all the virtuous ministers
who are loyal to you.

216
00:36:06,205 --> 00:36:07,039
We cannot do this.

217
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:08,916
What if the Prince...

218
00:36:09,542 --> 00:36:11,586
is not the former king's child?

219
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,131
This child,

220
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,426
the Prince...

221
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:23,556
is Father's child and my brother.

222
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:28,853
Please write that the brutal war
killed Father...

223
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,108
and the Queen, whom I called my mother,

224
00:36:36,819 --> 00:36:38,362
as well as me.

225
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,409
That's what I want you to write
in the annals.

226
00:36:46,787 --> 00:36:49,707
That is the last thing I can do...

227
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:54,629
as a descendant of the royal blood.

228
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:05,533
I wonder
if His Royal Highness is doing well.

229
00:38:06,575 --> 00:38:07,410
Yes, of course.

230
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,997
He has Seo-bi right by his side,
so I'm sure he's doing well.

231
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:22,300
What is it?

232
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:25,469
It's a compilation of all her notes
about the plague.

233
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:33,769
The plague broke out
when the dead were revived

234
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:36,063
through the use of the resurrection plant.

235
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,942
The eggs of the worms on the plant
seize control of the brain

236
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:41,861
and awaken the dead.

237
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:43,779
The dead who are resurrected

238
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:46,824
lose their power of reason,
cannot feel pain,

239
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:50,119
and only go after the smell
of human flesh and blood.

240
00:38:51,162 --> 00:38:53,456
Those who get bitten by the resurrected

241
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,708
are also infected by the worms
that enter the body,

242
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,668
but are not turned into monsters.

243
00:38:58,294 --> 00:39:00,463
Instead, they gradually grow cold

244
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:03,215
before falling ill and eventually dying.

245
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:09,096
The disease started spreading
at Jiyulheon in Dongnae.

246
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:12,516
Some cooked and ate the flesh of a person

247
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,935
who died after getting bitten
by a plague victim.

248
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:18,272
They died after having convulsions
and eventually turned into monsters.

249
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,860
After that, those who got bitten
by these monsters

250
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:24,236
also turned into monsters.

251
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,492
However, not everyone who is bitten
turns into a monster.

252
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:34,121
Even if you are bitten, plunging yourself
into the water before you die

253
00:39:34,413 --> 00:39:37,917
removes the worms from your body
before they can reach your brain,

254
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:39,585
thus curing you of the disease.

255
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:44,340
In addition, newborns also do not catch
the plague even if they are bitten

256
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:47,885
because their brains
are not fully developed yet.

257
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:54,392
The worms thrive in cold temperatures,
so they lie dormant in spring and summer.

258
00:39:54,850 --> 00:39:58,687
In autumn and early winter,
they are only inactive when the sun is up.

259
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:02,233
Then from the winter solstice
to the first day of spring,

260
00:40:02,316 --> 00:40:04,527
they stay active all day and night.

261
00:40:06,028 --> 00:40:09,907
Nevertheless, there is one question
I have not yet been able to solve.

262
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:14,495
I am certain that the worms
like cold temperatures.

263
00:40:14,578 --> 00:40:16,956
But for some reason,
the heat made them thrive

264
00:40:17,039 --> 00:40:18,457
and spread even more viciously.

265
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:20,334
RESURRECTION PLANT

266
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,877
There must be

267
00:40:21,961 --> 00:40:24,672
a more profound secret
behind the resurrection plant.

268
00:40:28,008 --> 00:40:30,386
Seo-bi is still trying to determine
what caused the disease?

269
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,892
The plague was eradicated seven years ago.

270
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:38,561
No, not completely.

271
00:40:39,770 --> 00:40:41,689
The plant grows in other regions as well,

272
00:40:42,189 --> 00:40:43,649
not just in Sangju.

273
00:40:43,732 --> 00:40:44,817
Which region?

274
00:40:45,234 --> 00:40:46,527
There is more than one.

275
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:49,655
Gyeongsang, the Three Provinces,
Gyeonggi, Gangwon, and Hwanghae.

276
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,825
We found the resurrection plant
all over the country.

277
00:40:52,908 --> 00:40:54,702
RESURRECTION PLANT

278
00:41:26,609 --> 00:41:28,360
I am sure this is the resurrection plant.

279
00:41:35,784 --> 00:41:36,785
My lord.

280
00:41:46,295 --> 00:41:48,380
This is the headman
of a village nearby and his son.

281
00:41:50,633 --> 00:41:51,717
These plants...

282
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:54,136
When did they start growing here?

283
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:55,971
Oh, those plants.

284
00:41:56,555 --> 00:41:57,681
Well...

285
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,893
we planted them.

286
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:02,978
What do you mean?

287
00:42:03,312 --> 00:42:04,438
You planted them?

288
00:42:05,648 --> 00:42:07,191
Then where did you get these plants?

289
00:42:07,650 --> 00:42:08,609
Well,

290
00:42:09,443 --> 00:42:12,112
my son followed a merchant to China
to earn money.

291
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:15,115
He got those plants near the Yalu River

292
00:42:15,282 --> 00:42:17,618
when he was returning home from China.

293
00:42:17,701 --> 00:42:21,372
We planted them, thinking we might be able
to make money off them.

294
00:42:22,248 --> 00:42:23,165
Is it true?

295
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,917
Yes, it is true.

296
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,545
I heard the plant can revive dead people,

297
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:29,713
so I was hoping to make money off it.

298
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:33,592
But no one believed me,
so I just left them here.

299
00:42:44,395 --> 00:42:46,855
Are you sure someone sold
the resurrection plant to him?

300
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:48,566
Yes, I am sure.

301
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,695
He even knew exactly what to do
to resurrect the dead using the plant.

302
00:42:53,070 --> 00:42:55,781
The person who sold him the plant
gave him all the instructions.

303
00:42:59,743 --> 00:43:01,370
Who would sell such a scary plant?

304
00:43:01,453 --> 00:43:05,332
His Royal Highness sent me
to inform you about this matter.

305
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,751
I was also told
to deliver this book to you

306
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,628
just in case there is another outbreak.

307
00:43:11,547 --> 00:43:12,631
Where is...

308
00:43:13,215 --> 00:43:14,216
His Royal Highness now?

309
00:43:14,925 --> 00:43:16,719
He's gone to the Northern Region...

310
00:43:19,179 --> 00:43:21,140
to track down that person.

311
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,602
HWANGHAE PROVINCE

312
00:43:25,519 --> 00:43:26,562
HAMGYONG PROVINCE

313
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,078
-Where is it?
-It's this place.

314
00:43:43,495 --> 00:43:46,707
The furniture and appliances
are still there, but the people are gone.

315
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:01,448
I found the resurrection plant.

316
00:45:07,746 --> 00:45:09,832
"There must be...

317
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,045
a more profound secret
behind the resurrection plant."
