1
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,333
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

2
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,416
You mean to say...

3
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,126
3 YEARS AGO

4
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:51,337
...that this plant can resurrect the dead?

5
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:52,255
That is correct.

6
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:55,133
They will not die
even if you try to slice or stab them.

7
00:02:55,258 --> 00:02:57,385
They turn into monsters
with an undying thirst...

8
00:02:57,969 --> 00:02:59,637
for human flesh and blood.

9
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:02,515
That's impossible.
How could the dead possibly--

10
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,808
It is true.

11
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,144
So?

12
00:03:07,103 --> 00:03:09,397
Why are you showing me this plant?

13
00:03:09,856 --> 00:03:11,941
Are you suggesting
we resurrect our dead soldiers

14
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:14,819
so that they can fight
the Japanese invaders?

15
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:15,862
No.

16
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:18,907
Corpses that have already started to rot

17
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,491
cannot be resurrected.

18
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:25,580
And we cannot kill our soldiers
just to turn them into monsters.

19
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,458
We should not squander
our military manpower like that.

20
00:03:34,672 --> 00:03:37,717
Then what on earth are you trying to say?

21
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:40,845
The diseased people in Sumang Village.

22
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:45,016
Let us kill them.

23
00:03:47,477 --> 00:03:49,312
If we turn them into monsters...

24
00:03:50,271 --> 00:03:52,690
and make them fight
against the Japanese army,

25
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,361
we'll be able to survive this crisis.

26
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:01,783
Are you serious about this?

27
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,534
They will be considered useless...

28
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,787
no matter where they go, anyway.

29
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,582
We are willing to endure bloodshed
to fight off the Japanese,

30
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,710
so that we could protect
our land and people.

31
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:15,046
But this?

32
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,591
Now you're suggesting...

33
00:04:19,175 --> 00:04:21,135
that we kill our people
with our own hands?

34
00:04:23,596 --> 00:04:25,265
We cannot do that.

35
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:30,645
Bring the dead back to life?

36
00:04:30,728 --> 00:04:32,146
I cannot believe...

37
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,816
such nonsense, either.

38
00:04:36,401 --> 00:04:37,944
Have you been fighting...

39
00:04:38,695 --> 00:04:41,197
for the lowly commoners?

40
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,081
That is not why I've been fighting.

41
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:52,375
What I have been trying to protect...

42
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:56,254
are the royal family, the backbone
of this country, and their traditions.

43
00:04:57,255 --> 00:04:58,631
In order to do so,

44
00:04:59,549 --> 00:05:01,634
I will do just about anything.

45
00:05:26,284 --> 00:05:28,953
Soon, countless Japanese soldiers
will flock here.

46
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:32,665
However, we only have
about 500 soldiers left.

47
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:37,337
So how long do you insist on putting
benevolence and righteousness first?

48
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,714
Lord Ahn.

49
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:44,969
Consider...

50
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,097
the countless people in Sangju.

51
00:05:49,891 --> 00:05:51,434
This is but a small sacrifice...

52
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,520
necessary to save those people.

53
00:05:56,773 --> 00:05:58,191
All will be fine...

54
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:00,943
if just the two of us...

55
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,821
turn a blind eye to it.

56
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,831
SUMANG VILLAGE

57
00:07:27,655 --> 00:07:30,366
The Japanese army
will invade our land soon.

58
00:07:30,867 --> 00:07:33,327
Close the gate facing Sangju.

59
00:07:33,953 --> 00:07:35,788
Open the one on the opposite side...

60
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,748
facing the canal.

61
00:08:56,077 --> 00:08:59,455
I will not forget your sacrifice.

62
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:03,709
And one day, I will pay back my debt.

63
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,178
To stop the creatures
that rose from the dead,

64
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,639
you must aim for their head.

65
00:10:02,810 --> 00:10:04,145
I do not believe this.

66
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,896
How is this possible?

67
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:10,860
Lord Ahn Hyeon definitely passed away.

68
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,111
That is correct.

69
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:16,073
Just as all of you had witnessed,

70
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,618
he had indeed passed away.

71
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:24,832
But that female physician resurrected him,

72
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:29,837
just like how Cho Hak-ju
brought my father back from the dead.

73
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,341
Now, tell us...

74
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,761
everything you saw and heard.

75
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:47,188
Lee Seung-hui,
the physician who taught me,

76
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,483
recorded everything
in his patient journal.

77
00:10:57,698 --> 00:10:59,450
This plant is called
the resurrection plant.

78
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,370
He used it to bring His Majesty
back from the dead,

79
00:11:02,703 --> 00:11:06,248
and that's why this plague
broke out in Gyeongsang.

80
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:14,799
This is Father's patient journal,
which she just mentioned.

81
00:11:16,550 --> 00:11:20,012
He tried to disclose the truth.

82
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,641
The Haewon Cho Clan...

83
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:26,977
and their leader, Cho Hak-ju,

84
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,021
are accusing me of plotting treason.

85
00:11:29,689 --> 00:11:32,191
However, what I want is not the throne.

86
00:11:34,318 --> 00:11:36,278
What I truly want...

87
00:11:37,738 --> 00:11:40,116
is to punish the Haewon Cho Clan...

88
00:11:41,409 --> 00:11:42,660
for degrading our nation.

89
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:50,793
The Haewon Cho Clan
is guilty of mortal sin.

90
00:11:50,876 --> 00:11:53,003
They have treated
the corpse of the late king...

91
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:56,924
with abominable disrespect
just so that they could keep their power.

92
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:00,428
They oppressed the commoners,
who were ravaged by the war.

93
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,930
And they deliberately starved them...

94
00:12:04,181 --> 00:12:06,058
by taking away their food.

95
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,310
The Haewon Cho Clan's greed...

96
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:11,564
caused this atrocious plague.

97
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:14,692
Now, open your eyes and ears!

98
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:19,071
Listen to the people...

99
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,283
and heed the reality of this country.

100
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,454
It is now time...

101
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,499
to decide what the right thing is to do.

102
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,513
Will you join me?

103
00:12:52,271 --> 00:12:56,358
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

104
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,175
The people inside the citadel

105
00:13:21,258 --> 00:13:23,219
will not be able
to hold out for much longer.

106
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,181
We must get some food there
as soon as we can.

107
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,517
Even the most skilled soldiers we have

108
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,393
cannot ward them all off.

109
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:33,270
They greatly outnumber us.

110
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,776
We escaped through this canal.

111
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,612
If we fill wagons with food
and take this route,

112
00:13:42,112 --> 00:13:43,489
it may work.

113
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,158
We are the ones most familiar
with the area.

114
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:47,368
We shall go.

115
00:13:48,619 --> 00:13:50,538
Our families are still inside the citadel.

116
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:51,872
Please allow us to do it.

117
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,415
You will be completely vulnerable.

118
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,292
Will you be able to do it?

119
00:13:58,754 --> 00:13:59,880
We will take...

120
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,216
this route.

121
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:04,218
If you can cover us along the way...

122
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,640
we may be able to do this.

123
00:14:09,723 --> 00:14:12,268
You will be visible
just after you cross the river,

124
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:14,520
but you will soon enter the mountains.

125
00:14:15,479 --> 00:14:18,274
How can we cover you when we cannot
even see how far you have gone?

126
00:14:31,662 --> 00:14:32,538
Fire.

127
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:34,081
Fire!

128
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,108
FIRE

129
00:15:24,214 --> 00:15:25,466
Near the canal.

130
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,968
They are launching bombs near the canal.

131
00:15:37,895 --> 00:15:39,730
Make haste, everyone!

132
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,398
Make haste! Quickly, now!

133
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,902
We have arrived.

134
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:51,033
-They're here.
-We're saved!

135
00:15:51,116 --> 00:15:53,035
-Thank you!
-Thank you for saving us.

136
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:56,705
Goodness, what is going on?

137
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,959
His Royal Highness has managed
to take down Lord Cho Hak-ju

138
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,710
and has taken control of Mungyeong Saejae.

139
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:02,878
Is that right?

140
00:16:05,214 --> 00:16:07,424
He could not come with us

141
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:09,551
for he must head to Hanyang
to resolve this matter,

142
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:11,553
but I come bearing a message from him.

143
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,722
It is impossible

144
00:16:14,181 --> 00:16:16,183
to get everyone out of the citadel safely.

145
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:20,896
However, we will continue
to supply you with food using this method,

146
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:23,565
so try to hold out here
for as long as you can.

147
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,905
Chin up, everyone!

148
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,159
BASE CAMP IN MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

149
00:16:42,918 --> 00:16:43,752
How is he doing?

150
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,089
His body temperature keeps dropping.

151
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,259
But...

152
00:16:50,968 --> 00:16:54,054
you are certain that my uncle
will not turn into a monster, correct?

153
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:56,807
Not everyone who has been bitten
by the resurrected

154
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:59,351
turns into a monster.

155
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:03,439
Dan-i, who was bitten
by His Majesty in Hanyang,

156
00:17:03,522 --> 00:17:05,399
did not turn into a monster.

157
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:10,404
But he did become bedridden
and die eventually.

158
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:16,702
The symptoms changed
at Jiyulheon in Dongnae.

159
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:20,539
Those who ate Dan-i's flesh
turned into monsters...

160
00:17:21,415 --> 00:17:24,168
and started spreading the disease.

161
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,169
Then,

162
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:28,464
what will become of my uncle?

163
00:17:29,798 --> 00:17:31,925
He won't be infected by the disease.

164
00:17:32,551 --> 00:17:34,553
But if we cannot find a way to treat him,

165
00:17:35,095 --> 00:17:38,140
he will eventually die as Dan-i did.

166
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,772
Seo-bi, please save his life.

167
00:17:45,939 --> 00:17:49,276
I understand what my uncle did
to His Majesty cannot be forgiven,

168
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,321
but we cannot let him die
such a horrible death.

169
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:53,322
I had no choice...

170
00:17:54,281 --> 00:17:56,450
but to helplessly let Dan-i die.

171
00:17:58,744 --> 00:18:00,537
But this time, I will be sure to cure him.

172
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:06,043
If I cure him and find out what is causing
such symptoms to manifest,

173
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,630
I should be able to find a way to bring
the plague under control for good.

174
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,467
All right. Whatever you do,
please save my uncle's life.

175
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:17,846
His body is ice-cold.

176
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,766
I will go fetch some herbs
that will warm him up.

177
00:18:20,849 --> 00:18:22,976
Sure, all right.

178
00:18:28,023 --> 00:18:29,608
Seo-bi, wait.

179
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:31,068
Would this work?

180
00:18:31,151 --> 00:18:33,612
This is some rare medicine
that the Queen asked for.

181
00:18:34,905 --> 00:18:39,243
This is sappanwood,
used to treat gynecological conditions.

182
00:18:40,035 --> 00:18:42,579
We cannot treat Lord Cho with this.

183
00:18:47,876 --> 00:18:48,919
Wait.

184
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:51,880
Did you say...

185
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:55,425
Her Majesty asked for this?

186
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:00,180
This isn't for Her Majesty herself,
correct?

187
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:03,433
Why do you think I tried so hard
to get this if it were not for the Queen?

188
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,272
You mean to say
that the Queen took this herself?

189
00:19:09,898 --> 00:19:11,733
That cannot be.

190
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:18,282
Did Her Majesty take it recently?

191
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,827
What difference does that make

192
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,829
when my uncle is at death's door?

193
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:25,414
Please, tell me.

194
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,835
I had to get some last month
as well as the month before.

195
00:19:32,421 --> 00:19:33,672
What is wrong?

196
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:50,189
Your Royal Highness.

197
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,733
We have a problem.

198
00:19:57,487 --> 00:19:58,405
What happened?

199
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:00,616
Where are the soldiers
who were on guard here?

200
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:03,785
They were found dead behind the building.

201
00:20:03,869 --> 00:20:04,995
Who did this?

202
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,706
Who did this, I ask you?

203
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:11,293
I heard
that Your Royal Highness' personal guard

204
00:20:11,376 --> 00:20:13,295
passed the three gates with a carriage,

205
00:20:13,378 --> 00:20:15,589
saying it was your orders.

206
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,492
What is this place?

207
00:20:45,786 --> 00:20:49,539
His Majesty collapsed a few days ago
due to smallpox,

208
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:52,251
so the palace is in chaos now.

209
00:20:53,502 --> 00:20:56,421
I am the only one who can look after you,

210
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,092
so I was worried about leaving you
all alone right before you are due.

211
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:03,178
This is my close acquaintance's residence,

212
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,181
so stay here for a few days.

213
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,225
But if I am here,

214
00:21:08,892 --> 00:21:10,894
who will cook and make your bed

215
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,772
when you come home
even for just a few hours?

216
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:15,399
I would...

217
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:18,443
like to stay beside you.

218
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:27,369
I do not know what I did
to deserve such a loving wife

219
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:31,999
when you have suffered much
due to your foolish husband.

220
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,921
I apologize.

221
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,716
I truly am sorry.

222
00:21:44,428 --> 00:21:45,971
I understand.

223
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,433
Do not worry about me.

224
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:54,062
It will only be for a few days.

225
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:56,773
Stay here for just a few days

226
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,191
and look after yourself.

227
00:22:13,915 --> 00:22:15,250
Show her into her bedroom.

228
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,294
This way, please.

229
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:39,691
You made a wise decision.

230
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,654
I am truly glad
that you brought her here yourself.

231
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:48,116
You are ensuring your wife's safety,

232
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:51,078
and we are getting what we want.

233
00:22:54,331 --> 00:22:55,248
If...

234
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,293
anything bad happens to my wife,

235
00:23:01,004 --> 00:23:02,214
I will never...

236
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:05,926
I will never let it slide.

237
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:14,434
Who do you think you are to threaten me?

238
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:20,565
Shall I go grab your wife by her hair
and drag her here...

239
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:23,985
so I can kill her before your eyes?

240
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:30,075
I understand that the Crown Prince
is fond of you, but do you think

241
00:23:30,158 --> 00:23:33,412
that a mere guard can stand
against the Haewon Cho Clan?

242
00:23:35,205 --> 00:23:37,791
I need to know where the Crown Prince
goes and whom he meets.

243
00:23:37,958 --> 00:23:39,668
Report everything to me.

244
00:23:40,168 --> 00:23:41,420
That is the only way...

245
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:43,505
to ensure your safety...

246
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,007
and your family's as well.

247
00:23:46,591 --> 00:23:47,717
Do I make myself clear?

248
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:39,769
It has already been four hours
since they left.

249
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:42,439
They are carrying a patient,
but they must've gotten far by now.

250
00:24:42,522 --> 00:24:44,149
If Cho Hak-ju reaches Hanyang
before we do,

251
00:24:44,232 --> 00:24:46,276
he'll return
with the rest of the Five Armies.

252
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,278
The people are still scarred by the war.

253
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:49,905
We cannot let our country implode again.

254
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,364
But how will you catch him?

255
00:24:51,448 --> 00:24:53,700
There are many routes
to get to Hanyang from here.

256
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:56,203
I am a tiger hunter.

257
00:24:56,578 --> 00:24:58,622
I'm better at chasing a target
than anyone.

258
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:00,040
Please allow me to accompany you.

259
00:25:18,517 --> 00:25:19,518
Is anyone outside?

260
00:25:19,601 --> 00:25:20,602
HANYANG CONFERENCE HALL

261
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,354
Why have we not received word yet?

262
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,484
We have not heard anything
from the Queen's Palace yet.

263
00:25:27,567 --> 00:25:30,570
But her labor pains began hours ago!

264
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:33,281
Perhaps something has gone wrong?

265
00:25:33,365 --> 00:25:36,117
Stop making such a fuss and sit back down.

266
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:38,036
You are distracting all of us.

267
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:46,086
Are you all not curious, though?

268
00:25:47,087 --> 00:25:50,465
His Majesty was falling in and out
of consciousness due to the plague.

269
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:55,762
So why did the Chief State Councillor
take His Majesty to Mungyeong Saejae?

270
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:58,515
That is not important right now.

271
00:25:58,848 --> 00:26:02,644
This is about whether or not we can
restore the backbone of this kingdom.

272
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:23,582
Who took the pregnant women
and the children?

273
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:26,835
How dare you!

274
00:26:27,544 --> 00:26:30,380
You dare have the audacity
to suspect Her Majesty?

275
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:34,968
If Her Majesty finds out about this,

276
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:36,803
you will...

277
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:40,473
face a brutal punishment at once!

278
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,186
Are you keeping a close watch
on the Queen's Palace?

279
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,230
Yes, sir.

280
00:26:47,439 --> 00:26:50,066
We are closely monitoring everyone
related to the Queen's Palace,

281
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:52,944
from all the court ladies
to court maids and even water maids.

282
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,154
Sir.

283
00:26:56,489 --> 00:27:00,660
I heard something strange from the people
who lent palanquins to Naeseonjae.

284
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:06,499
It seems the people at Naeseonjae borrowed
six palanquins last night, not three.

285
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,179
How can we help you?

286
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,682
We must check something
in the servants' quarters urgently.

287
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:25,268
We cannot let anyone in at the moment.

288
00:27:25,852 --> 00:27:28,688
Can't we even check
the servants' quarters?

289
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,650
We are looking for evidence
of a serious crime.

290
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,319
Step aside.

291
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,758
What is this about?

292
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,513
Her Majesty is about to give birth.

293
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,474
How dare you cause a scene here?
This will not go unpunished.

294
00:28:04,557 --> 00:28:08,144
The guards at the East Gate
told us that they saw

295
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:11,564
three palanquins entering the
Queen's Palace around 10 p.m. last night.

296
00:28:11,648 --> 00:28:13,942
A few wet nurses came

297
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:15,819
to breastfeed the baby.

298
00:28:15,902 --> 00:28:18,071
Right. The guards said
they let the palanquins in

299
00:28:18,154 --> 00:28:20,573
without even asking who were inside
because you told them so.

300
00:28:20,657 --> 00:28:21,616
However,

301
00:28:22,867 --> 00:28:25,453
I must know who was in those palanquins.

302
00:28:25,912 --> 00:28:28,123
As I said, it was the wet nurses.

303
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,332
Step aside.

304
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,149
What on earth happened?

305
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:58,695
We arrested him for entering the Office
of Royal Delivery at the Queen's Palace.

306
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:03,199
You barged into the Queen's Palace,
knowing that Her Majesty is in labor?

307
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:06,703
Did you not know that even the king
cannot enter the Office of Royal Delivery?

308
00:29:07,162 --> 00:29:10,123
I understand that you are the head
of the Royal Commandery Division,

309
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,834
but you shall be punished
as this is a serious offense.

310
00:29:13,710 --> 00:29:15,670
The head of Royal Commandery
has been arrested,

311
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:18,298
and all the soldiers
that were searching Naeseonjae...

312
00:29:19,507 --> 00:29:20,592
have left.

313
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,187
How dare they try to investigate me?

314
00:29:32,854 --> 00:29:35,356
Those rats in Royal Commandery
have dug their own graves.

315
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:39,944
No one can outsmart Your Majesty.

316
00:29:40,737 --> 00:29:42,781
The Royal Commandery Division
has lost its power,

317
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:46,576
so there is no one
to get in Your Majesty's way now.

318
00:29:49,913 --> 00:29:50,830
What...

319
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:52,957
about the baby?

320
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:56,711
I have sent the rest of the pregnant women
back to Naeseonjae.

321
00:29:57,253 --> 00:29:58,087
I believe...

322
00:29:58,588 --> 00:30:01,758
we can expect good news soon.

323
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:13,269
Sir! We need to stop for a few minutes.

324
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:18,399
Sir!

325
00:30:18,817 --> 00:30:20,652
He seems to be in critical condition.

326
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:22,403
Sir!

327
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,618
His body is ice-cold,

328
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,578
and I can barely feel his pulse.

329
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,332
How much longer do you think
he will hold out?

330
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:37,126
At this rate, he will die soon.

331
00:30:40,255 --> 00:30:43,007
We must find a place to lie him down.

332
00:31:02,235 --> 00:31:03,278
Wait...

333
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:05,363
Wait, Seo-bi.

334
00:31:15,164 --> 00:31:16,165
Goodness.

335
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:15,183
They went that way.

336
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,352
It is the only route to Hanyang,

337
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,812
so we should be able to catch them.

338
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,236
Why did you not do anything?

339
00:32:30,406 --> 00:32:31,950
You knew, Your Royal Highness.

340
00:32:33,242 --> 00:32:34,869
You knew that he had betrayed you.

341
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:42,752
I did not want to lose
yet another person from my life.

342
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,506
That is why.

343
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:50,510
I wanted to trust him.

344
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:07,193
Sir.

345
00:33:08,194 --> 00:33:10,697
When will His Royal Highness arrive?

346
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,782
You said he told you to leave first.

347
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:20,540
How is Lord Cho?

348
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:25,211
I managed to stabilize his condition,
but he does not seem to be doing too well.

349
00:33:26,087 --> 00:33:28,673
We should wait for His Royal Highness
here.

350
00:33:32,218 --> 00:33:33,761
No, we will leave now.

351
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,679
Get ready.

352
00:33:35,638 --> 00:33:37,223
Did His Royal Highness...

353
00:33:38,141 --> 00:33:40,309
really say we should leave first?

354
00:33:43,646 --> 00:33:46,733
You never intended
to wait for him, did you?

355
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,318
I do not know why you are acting this way,

356
00:33:51,821 --> 00:33:53,406
but you should not.

357
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:58,244
His Royal Highness was very fond of you,
and has relied on you so much.

358
00:33:59,579 --> 00:34:02,999
And you were always by His Royal
Highness's side, keeping him safe.

359
00:34:06,753 --> 00:34:08,421
I told you to get ready.

360
00:34:09,005 --> 00:34:10,214
I will not.

361
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,884
There is something
I must tell His Royal Highness.

362
00:34:16,554 --> 00:34:20,016
This is sappanwood, a type of
medicinal tree that only grows in Japan.

363
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,478
It is very rare and expensive,
meaning it is difficult to procure.

364
00:34:24,062 --> 00:34:26,147
-What of it?
-Typically, it is used to...

365
00:34:26,939 --> 00:34:29,567
remove blood clots
after a miscarriage or birth

366
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:33,321
or to alleviate symptoms that arise
from improper or lack of postpartum care.

367
00:34:33,654 --> 00:34:35,490
It is very potent,

368
00:34:36,032 --> 00:34:38,493
so it cannot be given to anyone
who is pregnant.

369
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,787
What are you trying to say?

370
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:42,121
I heard...

371
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:45,083
that Her Majesty has been taking it.

372
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,627
What are you saying?

373
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:50,630
You just said that it cannot
be taken during pregnancy.

374
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,590
The magistrate told me so.

375
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:55,718
He said that Her Majesty takes this.

376
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,428
He must be mistaken.

377
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,013
I, too, cannot fathom what is going on.

378
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,557
But if it is true,

379
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:05,353
we must tell His Royal Highness.

380
00:35:05,686 --> 00:35:09,190
We must find out
why Her Majesty is taking it.

381
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:16,280
-Wait.
-Yes?

382
00:35:16,364 --> 00:35:18,491
-Are you all done?
-Yes.

383
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,607
Did you just say...

384
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,444
it is normally taken
after a miscarriage or birth?

385
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:57,321
Yes.

386
00:36:10,668 --> 00:36:12,211
Are you all right, my lord?

387
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,048
Where are we?

388
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:18,718
What is this?

389
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,303
What is it...

390
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,388
used for?

391
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,808
What is that?

392
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,769
At Naeseonjae, I saw pregnant women
who seemed to be due soon.

393
00:36:29,979 --> 00:36:31,314
Why were they gathered there?

394
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:36,569
What are you plotting over there?

395
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:40,072
Answer me.

396
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:17,860
Escort Lord Cho!

397
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:18,903
Yes, sir!

398
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,941
Sir!

399
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:14,792
Seo-bi,

400
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,252
the thing is...

401
00:38:17,837 --> 00:38:20,673
my uncle told me to do this,
so I had no choice.

402
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:34,854
Seo-bi, come with us.

403
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,691
If you refuse, he will kill you as well.

404
00:38:41,694 --> 00:38:43,112
Go.

405
00:38:46,615 --> 00:38:47,700
Go...

406
00:38:51,412 --> 00:38:53,748
and find out, no matter what.

407
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:02,965
Go.

408
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,386
Hurry.

409
00:40:36,934 --> 00:40:39,228
Mu-yeong! Mu-yeong...

410
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,023
Mu-yeong!

411
00:40:44,817 --> 00:40:45,776
Mu-yeong!

412
00:40:53,742 --> 00:40:54,785
Your Royal Highness.

413
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:58,080
Your Royal Highness.

414
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:04,503
Your Royal Highness.

415
00:41:05,921 --> 00:41:08,132
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

416
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,677
I apologize...

417
00:41:13,387 --> 00:41:15,514
for my foolishness, Your Royal Highness.

418
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,312
He is critically injured!

419
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,273
Is there anything we can do?

420
00:41:31,697 --> 00:41:33,240
There were many pregnant women...

421
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:36,785
gathered together at Naeseonjae.

422
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,954
The Queen and her retinue...

423
00:41:39,622 --> 00:41:42,124
are surely scheming something.

424
00:41:43,167 --> 00:41:44,335
The female physician...

425
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:48,214
The female physician knows,
Your Royal Highness.

426
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,843
My wife...

427
00:41:55,554 --> 00:41:58,015
is also at Naeseonjae.

428
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:09,693
My family...

429
00:42:11,946 --> 00:42:13,697
is there.

430
00:42:18,702 --> 00:42:20,454
It was because...

431
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,459
I was foolish...

432
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,965
that I failed
to protect you until the end.

433
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,802
I am sorry, Your Royal Highness.

434
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,144
Mu-yeong.

435
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:49,024
Mu-yeong.

436
00:42:56,991 --> 00:43:00,703
Mu-yeong.

437
00:43:07,751 --> 00:43:11,505
Mu-yeong.

438
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,159
