Tomorrow morning,

00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,196
your families, who were taken
to the Investigation Bureau,

5
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,491
will be beheaded.

6
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,750
Continuing to serve me...

7
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,879
might put all of you in danger.

8
00:02:11,464 --> 00:02:12,507
Will you all...

9
00:02:15,426 --> 00:02:17,512
stay loyal to me nevertheless?

Mom!

Please! Let him go!

13
00:02:59,971 --> 00:03:01,306
Get out of the way!

14
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,726
No! My son!

15
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,397
No!

16
00:03:13,318 --> 00:03:14,194
Father!

17
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:43,389
Halt.

18
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:51,522
This country is suffering
one disaster after another.

19
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:53,775
What happened to Lord Cho Hak-ju
was devastating enough.

20
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:55,944
How about we postpone the executions?

21
00:03:56,027 --> 00:04:00,114
Her Majesty ordered us to carry out
the executions as planned, no matter what.

22
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:02,700
The Minister of War has a point.

23
00:04:02,867 --> 00:04:06,246
Some of the soldiers' families
are of noble origin.

24
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:08,748
It would not be too late
to carry out the executions

25
00:04:08,831 --> 00:04:11,125
after investigating the incident.

26
00:04:11,668 --> 00:04:14,212
It is Her Majesty's order,

27
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,506
which means it is a royal order.

28
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:18,883
Please come out for a moment.

00:04:24,597 --> 00:04:25,807
Military Training Commander.

30
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,643
I am here to make a confession.

31
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:31,312
The traitor, Chang,

32
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:34,941
is waiting for backup troops
at Yeonggi Academy...

33
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:38,653
just outside of Hanyang with soldiers
from the Military Training Corps.

34
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,906
I told you what I know, so please help me.

35
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,452
I beg you to spare my family's lives.

36
00:05:02,802 --> 00:05:05,263
Father was right.

37
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,644
My son, Chang,

38
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,522
dug his own grave.

39
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:28,619
Shoot!

40
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:41,299
I do not hear any screams.

41
00:05:58,399 --> 00:05:59,692
There is no one here, sir!

42
00:05:59,776 --> 00:06:01,194
No one here either, sir!

43
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:09,077
It must have been a trap
to lure the soldiers...

44
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,703
out of Hanyang.

The Crown Prince is here.

52
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:43,671
How many soldiers do we have left
in the Police Bureau?

53
00:07:43,754 --> 00:07:45,923
Many left the citadel
with the palace guards,

54
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:47,341
so only a few dozen at the most.

55
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,718
Assemble all of them.

56
00:07:48,801 --> 00:07:51,137
And ask the Minister of War
for backup troops.

As soldiers
who have pledged their loyalty...

60
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:22,210
to this country, their duty
was to punish the traitor, Chang.

61
00:08:22,293 --> 00:08:25,087
However, they abandoned their duty
and joined hands with the traitor

62
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,840
in pursuit of their selfish greed.

63
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:30,968
Thus, all families and relatives
of the treacherous soldiers

64
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,678
shall be executed--"

65
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:35,139
Please spare us.

66
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,769
But we didn't do anything wrong.

67
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:47,360
This is a royal order.

68
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:48,945
Let the beheading...

69
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,535
No, it can't be...

70
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,496
No.

71
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,043
Let the...

72
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,971
I cannot do this.

73
00:09:15,721 --> 00:09:18,099
I do not care if I am the head
of the Royal Commandery or not,

74
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,559
I can't do it.

75
00:09:32,822 --> 00:09:33,823
Your Royal Highness.

76
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:40,246
Your Royal Highness.

77
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:45,334
You made the right decision.

78
00:09:45,793 --> 00:09:47,712
Your Royal Highness.

79
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:48,879
I will...

80
00:09:50,214 --> 00:09:52,508
return to where I rightfully should be.

81
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:56,137
Will you join hands with me?

82
00:09:57,388 --> 00:10:00,850
The Royal Commandery Division
will be at Your Royal Highness' service.

83
00:10:07,565 --> 00:10:09,108
Untie them.

84
00:10:10,234 --> 00:10:11,319
They are not criminals!

85
00:10:19,910 --> 00:10:21,037
Give me a sword.

86
00:10:22,204 --> 00:10:23,873
I, too, will go to the palace.

87
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,259
My lord.

88
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,511
The traitors were sent
to the execution site.

89
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,807
My lord, why are you being like this?

90
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:43,851
-Tie them up!
-Yes, my lord!

What do you mean?

93
00:10:55,029 --> 00:10:57,406
The traitor, Chang,
is headed to the palace?

94
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:59,742
What were the soldiers doing?

95
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,453
Even Royal Commandery
and the Minister of War's soldiers

96
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,330
have joined hands with the traitors.

97
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,335
The gates have been sealed off,

98
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:11,921
so even the palace guards
cannot enter the citadel.

99
00:11:16,342 --> 00:11:17,301
Your Majesty.

100
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,679
You must escape immediately.

101
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,063
I will go to the Main Hall.

102
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,524
I should get ready...

103
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,151
to welcome my son.

104
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,779

How is this possible?

107
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:09,562
That patient journal was recorded
by Lee Seung-hui,

108
00:12:09,645 --> 00:12:10,813
the former royal physician.

109
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,399
Everything recorded in it is true.

110
00:12:15,693 --> 00:12:18,904
What would His Royal Highness
like me to do?

111
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:22,116
His Royal Highness would like you
to prove...

112
00:12:23,993 --> 00:12:27,496
that you are different from
the Haewon Cho Clan and their followers.

113
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:43,429
We have successfully subdued the soldiers
from the entire Police Bureau.

114
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,474
Now, we will escort Your Royal Highness
to the palace.

115
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:57,026
His Royal Highness
left for the palace first.

116
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,074
What do you mean?

117
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:11,749
Is His Royal Highness back?

118
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:13,626
Let him out.

119
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,303
The world ruled by the Haewon Cho Clan
has come to an end.

120
00:13:40,736 --> 00:13:42,613
Your Royal Highness!

121
00:13:42,696 --> 00:13:44,949
Please spare our lives.

122
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:48,577
All we did was obey the orders

123
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:52,665
of Lord Cho Hak-ju and Her Majesty.

124
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:56,669
Please have mercy, Your Royal Highness.

125
00:13:58,337 --> 00:14:02,174
We will faithfully serve
Your Royal Highness from now on.

126
00:14:02,258 --> 00:14:06,178
We have already disarmed
the palace guards at all the gates.

127
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,722
Please feel free to enter.

128
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:54,768
You are back.

129
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:58,689
Have you been away for so long

130
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,317
that you forgot how to pay
your respects to your mother?

131
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,778
You are not my mother.

132
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:11,994
You still do not know
your filial duties...

133
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:14,038
toward your mother.

134
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:16,415
Step down from the throne.

135
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,043
The throne does not belong to you.

136
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:23,172
Do you think you can make the people
of this kingdom serve you by doing this?

137
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,258
You are wrong.

138
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,385
Son,

139
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,721
you are a criminal of high treason

140
00:15:30,804 --> 00:15:32,806
who decapitated his father
with his own hands.

141
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:36,060
Now, the throne...

142
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:40,564
belongs to my child,
who is the deceased king's son.

143
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,403
Is that child...

144
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:50,199
truly the deceased king's son?

145
00:15:50,282 --> 00:15:53,494
Why is it that pregnant women
were gathered at Naeseonjae?

146
00:15:53,577 --> 00:15:54,495
Also,

147
00:15:55,496 --> 00:15:58,457
why did Your Majesty kill
those pregnant women and baby girls?

148
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,669
The Minister of War is right.

149
00:16:02,211 --> 00:16:04,755
I, too, have been doubting it
for quite some time.

150
00:16:05,172 --> 00:16:08,926
We must arrest the royal physicians
and Your Majesty's court ladies

151
00:16:09,009 --> 00:16:10,678
to find out the truth.

152
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:15,349
How dare you doubt
the legitimacy of my child!

153
00:16:15,432 --> 00:16:17,643
The reason I am trying to oust you

154
00:16:17,726 --> 00:16:21,313
is not because you are a Haewon Cho,
nor is it because I desire the throne.

155
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:24,942
You've neglected the responsibilities
and duties that come with the throne.

156
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:27,194
"The people worship food like God,

157
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,990
and the King must serve
those people like God."

158
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:34,493
That is why I am trying to oust you.

159
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:43,335
Now, make your decision.

160
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,967
Will you step down of your own accord?

161
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,595
Or will you be dragged down
from the throne like a dog?

162
00:16:54,638 --> 00:16:57,016
Was beheading your own father
not enough for you?

163
00:16:57,433 --> 00:17:00,894
Will you even kill your mother
and brother now?

164
00:17:04,523 --> 00:17:05,941
Go ahead and try.

165
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:09,194
I am not leaving the throne.

166
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,865
I will not even budge.

167
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,789
It is unnecessary to dirty
Your Royal Highness' hands with blood.

168
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:21,832
Do not be concerned.

169
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:23,876
I will bring the seal and make her issue

170
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,878
a royal edict to announce
your enthronement.

171
00:17:28,505 --> 00:17:30,007
I will go with him.

172
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,905
The Second and Third State Councillors

173
00:17:52,988 --> 00:17:54,782
are on their way here
to get the royal seal.

174
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,902
Is anyone inside?

175
00:19:17,197 --> 00:19:19,283
Don't walk so fast.

176
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:18,026
Second State Councillor,
what about the royal seal?

177
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:20,237
Second State Councillor! It's me!

178
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,322
Stay away from me!

179
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:27,160
Stay away!

180
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,746
Stay away, I said!

181
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:34,793
Let go of me!

182
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:49,558
Help! Over here!

183
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:54,354
Over here! Help me!

184
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:23,884
What on earth...

185
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:26,887
have you been plotting?

186
00:22:28,889 --> 00:22:30,557
If I cannot have it,

187
00:22:34,311 --> 00:22:35,687
no one else...

188
00:22:37,481 --> 00:22:38,982
can have it.

189
00:22:57,667 --> 00:22:59,002
The plague has broken out!

190
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,880
The plague has broken out.

191
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,930
The plague has broken out!

192
00:23:15,560 --> 00:23:18,939
The plague has broken out
from the Queen's Palace.

193
00:23:27,614 --> 00:23:30,200
Lock up all the gates at the palace!

194
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,038
HEUNGHWA GATE

195
00:23:35,122 --> 00:23:36,790
SUNGJEONG GATE

196
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:39,418
What is happening?

197
00:23:39,835 --> 00:23:42,879
-How could the plague break out here?
-That is not important now.

198
00:23:42,963 --> 00:23:44,256
We do not have time.

199
00:23:45,757 --> 00:23:49,010
Be they noblemen or high-ranking officers,

200
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,971
aim for their heads,
regardless of their rank.

201
00:23:51,054 --> 00:23:54,641
We must kill every single person
who has caught the plague!

202
00:23:54,724 --> 00:23:56,476
-Do you understand?
-Yes, Your Royal Highness!

203
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,062
Your Royal Highness.

204
00:24:31,928 --> 00:24:32,929
Do not be afraid!

205
00:25:34,658 --> 00:25:36,910
Go hide somewhere safe. Hurry!

206
00:25:42,749 --> 00:25:44,209
It's occupied.

207
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:50,715
Jeez.

208
00:25:51,341 --> 00:25:52,968
Someone's in here.

209
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:45,705
YEONGYEONG GATE

210
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:56,049
Take the portraits of the former kings.

211
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:12,000
Do you think...

212
00:29:12,792 --> 00:29:13,668
we killed them all?

213
00:29:21,968 --> 00:29:23,428
The screams...

214
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,264
I no longer hear any screams.

215
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:31,561
What is happening?

216
00:29:33,688 --> 00:29:35,815
Has it been brought under control?

217
00:29:59,714 --> 00:30:02,425
Your Royal Highness must escape!

218
00:30:02,509 --> 00:30:06,054
Please escape at once!

219
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:21,194
-There are too many of them.
-Your Royal Highness, we must run.

220
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,740
Hurry, Your Royal Highness!
