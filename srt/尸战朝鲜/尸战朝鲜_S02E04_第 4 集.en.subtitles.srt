00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,804
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

2
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:00,972
Your...

3
00:03:02,473 --> 00:03:03,391
Your Royal Highness.

4
00:03:08,354 --> 00:03:09,439
Your Royal Highness,

5
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:11,733
I have committed a grave sin.

6
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,693
Please forgive me just this one time.

7
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:15,153
This isn't your first time.

8
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:19,157
The pomegranates and the cookies.

9
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:21,326
What else was there?

10
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,413
You have stolen so many things
that I cannot even remember them all.

11
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,333
Your Royal Highness,
I deserve to be executed

12
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,043
for daring to touch your tea table.

13
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,087
However, please take pity on my wife,

14
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,466
who eked out a living as a seamstress
to support me...

15
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:40,345
until I passed the military examination
after the age of 40.

16
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,140
My kindhearted wife is pregnant,
and she is having a hard time

17
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:45,683
coping with her morning sickness,

18
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,394
but I cannot afford to buy meat
or even rice for her,

19
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,855
which truly breaks my heart.

20
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:54,609
That is why I stole from your tea table
even though I knew it is wrong.

21
00:03:55,818 --> 00:03:57,654
I beg for your mercy, Your Royal Highness.

22
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,405
Did you...

23
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:01,866
truly take them to your wife?

24
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,535
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

25
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:07,205
How could I dare to lie
to Your Royal Highness?

26
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,458
Is your wife all right?

27
00:04:14,587 --> 00:04:17,048
Yes, Your Royal Highness.
She is doing fine.

28
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:27,267
From now on,

29
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,108
taste it before you give her any.

30
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:42,073
I do not understand.

31
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:45,827
Will Your Royal Highness...

32
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,290
allow me to continue
to take the food to my wife?

33
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:04,137
Then what will you give me in return?

34
00:05:04,887 --> 00:05:08,766
I will gladly offer anything I can give
to Your Royal Highness.

35
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,108
Stay by my side.

36
00:05:17,775 --> 00:05:20,320
Keeping by Your Royal Highness's side
is my sole duty.

37
00:05:20,403 --> 00:05:21,612
I must do so without question.

38
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:25,533
No matter what happens,
and regardless of your circumstances,

39
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,785
always stay by my side.

40
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:30,580
Can you do that?

41
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,963
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

42
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:41,466
I can certainly do that.

43
00:05:42,967 --> 00:05:46,262
No matter what happens,
and regardless of my circumstances,

44
00:05:47,096 --> 00:05:49,640
I will stay by your side
and protect you at all times.

45
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:20,963
Your Royal Highness.

46
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,965
We must leave now.

47
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:27,887
Did you not say we must stop
Lord Cho Hak-ju, no matter what?

48
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:39,107
HANYANG

49
00:06:41,776 --> 00:06:43,027
Open the gate!

50
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:48,366
The Chief State Councillor
is inside the carriage! Open the gate.

51
00:06:51,077 --> 00:06:52,412
He is in critical condition.

52
00:06:52,495 --> 00:06:54,080
We must move him as quickly as possible.

53
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,459
Uncle, are you all right?

54
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,462
Seo-bi, please do something.

55
00:07:01,546 --> 00:07:03,548
Needles or herbs, I will get anything.

56
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:06,759
Neither acupuncture needles nor herbs
are the fundamental solution.

57
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,553
Are you saying we should just let him die?

58
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:11,139
He fell ill because he was bitten
by a plague victim.

59
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,933
I'm sure that the symptoms themselves

60
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:17,270
will help us find a way
to treat the disease.

61
00:07:20,106 --> 00:07:21,649
They lose their power of reason

62
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:24,861
and only go after the smell
of human flesh and blood.

63
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:27,905
They fear fire and water.

64
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:30,408
They've all turned into beasts.

65
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:40,585
Seo-bi!

66
00:07:46,257 --> 00:07:48,551
The stream wasn't even deep,

67
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,221
but the plague victims
couldn't even cross the shallow waters.

68
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,433
As for fire, it may be due to the heat.

69
00:07:56,058 --> 00:07:56,976
But...

70
00:07:57,768 --> 00:07:59,020
in the case of water,

71
00:08:00,438 --> 00:08:02,064
why do they fear it so much?

72
00:08:15,077 --> 00:08:16,245
Will this...

73
00:08:16,829 --> 00:08:17,830
really work?

74
00:08:17,914 --> 00:08:19,540
I don't know either.

75
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:22,877
But there is nothing else
we can do, is there?

76
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,383
What? What's happening?

77
00:08:29,926 --> 00:08:30,760
What...

78
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:43,439
Seo-bi, something's wrong.

79
00:08:51,322 --> 00:08:52,615
What are you...

80
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,245
What are you waiting for?
Take my uncle out of--

81
00:08:57,328 --> 00:08:58,246
Just a moment!

82
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,624
This sound is...

83
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,043
It is a prince.

84
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:52,091
Her Majesty gave birth to a prince.

85
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:54,468
Yes!

86
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,220
What joy!

87
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:11,027
Your Majesty.

88
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,656
Congratulations on the birth of a prince.

89
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,908
Congratulations.

90
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,621
What a glorious day for our kingdom.

91
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:24,707
Please accept
our heartiest congratulations.

92
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:38,763
HANYANG

93
00:10:40,014 --> 00:10:42,308
NAESEONJAE

94
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,068
Hurry.

95
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,153
We must finish the job
before the dawn breaks.

96
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:01,118
Your Royal Highness' guard was right.

97
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,036
They're all...

98
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,829
expectant mothers.

99
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,099
She is still alive.

100
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,523
What do you mean?

101
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:33,818
A murder took place at the residence
of Her Majesty's family?

102
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:36,153
It was not an ordinary murder.

103
00:11:36,612 --> 00:11:40,408
Seven pregnant women were murdered, and
we also found corpses of female newborns.

104
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:44,453
We do not know who did it
or why such a cruel thing had to be done.

105
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:49,333
But one thing we know for certain is
that it is connected to the Queen's Palace

106
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:53,170
and that the culprit
must have been after a male newborn.

107
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:56,966
Are you implying...

108
00:11:57,508 --> 00:11:59,677
that the Queen plotted
to bring in a peasant's baby

109
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:02,221
to fool us into believing
that she gave birth to a prince?

110
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,306
That is nonsense!

111
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:07,393
Harboring such a thought itself
is insolent!

112
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:09,353
If it is true,

113
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:12,356
it will utterly disorder
the foundation of this country.

114
00:12:12,732 --> 00:12:16,193
The head of Royal Commandery only went
there to check whether or not it is true.

115
00:12:21,866 --> 00:12:26,620
Chief State Councillor. When did
you return from Mungyeong Saejae?

116
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,003
Do you have firm evidence?

117
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,133
I asked you if there is any firm evidence.

118
00:12:42,136 --> 00:12:46,098
Without any evidence, he dared
to barge into the Office of Royal Delivery

119
00:12:46,474 --> 00:12:48,768
when the Queen was in labor.

120
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,437
He defiled the Office of Royal Delivery,

121
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,481
where even His Majesty
is not allowed to enter.

122
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:57,526
Moreover, he derided the royal family
and threatened its traditions.

123
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,238
Thus, the head of Royal Commandery
should be beheaded.

124
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,406
Lord Cho.

125
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:07,203
We cannot behead a high-ranking
military officer for such a matter.

126
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:08,788
There is more.

127
00:13:10,247 --> 00:13:12,750
The Military Training Commander
and his soldiers...

128
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:17,213
who went to Mungyeong Saejae decided
to join hands with the traitor, Chang.

129
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:20,049
What do you mean?

130
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,968
Why on earth would the soldiers
from the Military Training Corps

131
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:24,678
do such a thing?

132
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,806
That is not important.

133
00:13:27,556 --> 00:13:29,975
Their blades are pointed at us.

134
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,436
We ought to punish them
as soon as possible

135
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,855
so that we can restore order
in this country.

136
00:13:41,028 --> 00:13:43,572
Joining hands with the traitor
who committed high treason...

137
00:13:45,074 --> 00:13:47,243
makes them also guilty of high treason.

138
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:50,621
We shall behead
their families and relatives...

139
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,792
as well as everyone
in their wives' and mothers' families...

140
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,879
at once, to set a proper example.

141
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:03,133
We cannot execute them
without investigating the incident first.

142
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:12,434
It must be done for the sake
of Joseon's national security.

143
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:19,608
Do you have any objections?

144
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,993
Arrest the family members
of the Military Training Commander!

145
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:39,378
Do you not know whose residence this is?

146
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:43,090
Mother!

147
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,518
Get up!

148
00:14:58,355 --> 00:15:00,316
Seo-bi, we should hurry.

149
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,028
Why are they deemed guilty of treason?

150
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,240
Those people and the soldiers
in Mungyeong Saejae are not traitors.

151
00:15:08,324 --> 00:15:09,825
You are well aware of that, my lord.

152
00:15:09,909 --> 00:15:13,245
Watch what you say.
Do you not know how scary my uncle can be?

153
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:15,164
Don't kill us. Please spare our lives.

154
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:17,374
-Father!
-Spare our lives, please.

155
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,418
Father!

156
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:20,586
Father!

157
00:15:20,669 --> 00:15:22,546
Father!

158
00:15:22,630 --> 00:15:24,340
Father...

159
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:26,967
Father...

160
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,385
Father...

161
00:15:28,469 --> 00:15:30,095
-What are you doing?
-Let's hurry.

162
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:34,808
The apothecary is that way.
You said you needed to buy herbs.

163
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:39,563
I'll go and buy herbs that I need
by myself, so please return first.

164
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:17,851

00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:22,773
THOSE WHO TRESPASS ON THE INSTITUTION
WILL BE PUT TO DEATH

166
00:16:32,616 --> 00:16:33,867
My baby...

167
00:16:37,788 --> 00:16:40,165
They took my baby.

168
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,062
How is she?

169
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,857
She's past the critical stage,

170
00:17:05,399 --> 00:17:07,693
but the shock seems to be
too great to bear for her.

171
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,611
By the way, who is that woman?

172
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:12,990
She is Mu-yeong's wife.

173
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:22,082
I heard Cho Hak-ju recovered.

174
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,552
-What is this?
-The disease is caused by this worm.

175
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:41,351
The white specks you see
on the resurrection plant

176
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,062
are eggs of this worm.

177
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:45,564
When ingested, the eggs hatch
into worms inside the body.

178
00:17:45,647 --> 00:17:47,775
That is what brought
the dead back to life.

179
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:54,573
Then have you figured out a way to stop
the plague now that you know the cause?

180
00:17:55,157 --> 00:17:56,658
We must save the people in Sangju.

181
00:17:57,242 --> 00:17:59,953
I apologize, Your Royal Highness.
I haven't figured out a solution yet.

182
00:18:03,415 --> 00:18:06,710
It was all caused by this tiny worm.

183
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,713
It took countless lives,

184
00:18:10,047 --> 00:18:12,007
shook up the entire Gyeongsang Province,

185
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,136
and imperiled this kingdom.

186
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:19,973
All of that was because of this tiny worm.

187
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,226
Are you all right, Your Royal Highness?

188
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:29,566
You suffered severe injuries
from Dongnae to all the way here.

189
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:32,152
Many suffered greater injuries.

190
00:18:32,236 --> 00:18:34,822
And even more people will get hurt.

191
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:39,368
I will put an end to it.

192
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,001
But to do that,

193
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:50,546
I need you to do something for me first.

194
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,976
My lord.

195
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:09,648
What kind of herb did you need
that it took you this long?

196
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,941
My lord.

197
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,569
I must ask a favor of you.

198
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:18,490
So, you wish to work...

199
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:20,868
as Her Majesty's physician?

200
00:19:23,912 --> 00:19:26,206
This female physician cured you
of the disease, Uncle.

201
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:30,711
She deserves a reward for her hard work,
so please kindly accept her request.

202
00:19:31,295 --> 00:19:34,715
I was just planning to visit Her Majesty.

203
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,050
What great timing.

204
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,061
THE QUEEN'S PALACE, INNER ROOM

205
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:53,817
Your Majesty.

206
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,154
The Chief State Councillor is here
for an audience with you.

207
00:20:02,409 --> 00:20:03,243
He may enter.

208
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,349
I heard about your illness,
so I have been concerned.

209
00:20:26,141 --> 00:20:27,517
Are you fully recovered now?

210
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:31,688
Did everything go smoothly
in Mungyeong Saejae?

211
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:44,826
It's a prince.

212
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:48,997
A healthy and bright one.

213
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:52,626
We have a prince now.

214
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,804
I heard all families and relatives
of the soldiers will be executed.

215
00:21:04,763 --> 00:21:05,973
You made a wise decision.

216
00:21:06,556 --> 00:21:08,767
How dare they side
with the traitorous Crown Prince?

217
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,186
They deserve to die.

218
00:21:13,563 --> 00:21:14,606
They are...

219
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,652
only the bait to catch Chang.

220
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:27,327
There is someone else
who committed a mortal sin...

221
00:21:28,829 --> 00:21:30,247
and deserves to die.

222
00:21:47,222 --> 00:21:48,932
That girl I brought...

223
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,644
is a skilled physician.

224
00:21:53,228 --> 00:21:56,940
I am concerned that giving birth
might have taken a toll on your health.

225
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:59,526
Let us have her examine your pulse.

226
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:05,532
Why should I let such a lowborn girl
look after my health?

227
00:22:07,451 --> 00:22:09,077
What are you waiting for?

228
00:22:10,787 --> 00:22:12,914
I told you to examine the Queen's pulse.

229
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:15,625
Father.

230
00:22:34,770 --> 00:22:36,646
Go ahead and check her pulse. Now!

231
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:44,863
If you have nothing to be afraid of,

232
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:48,325
just let her examine your pulse.

233
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:21,316
Tell us.

234
00:23:22,234 --> 00:23:23,568
I can't detect...

235
00:23:24,528 --> 00:23:26,113
a rough pulse on her.

236
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,740
What does that mean?

237
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,624
That baby...

238
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:41,378
is not Her Majesty's child.

239
00:23:44,172 --> 00:23:45,799
When did you start plotting this?

240
00:23:52,931 --> 00:23:53,765
What happened?

241
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,184
The thing is...

242
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:59,563
the cubit pulse and pregnancy pulse
are not detected at all.

243
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,606
Does that mean
Her Majesty's fetus is gone?

244
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,358
Please punish us.

245
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,698
Have you not been taking
good care of Her Majesty?

246
00:24:10,699 --> 00:24:14,119
We truly apologize, but the thoroughfare
and conception vessels are too weak.

247
00:24:14,202 --> 00:24:16,788
We tried every remedy we could think of,

248
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,498
but nothing worked.

249
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:21,626
Is conceiving a child

250
00:24:22,043 --> 00:24:23,545
that difficult for you?

251
00:24:24,713 --> 00:24:26,840
I will conceive a child at all costs.

252
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,388
I will give birth...

253
00:24:34,014 --> 00:24:35,265
to a baby boy.

254
00:24:38,602 --> 00:24:41,021
Do not tell me that you are planning
to fake a pregnancy.

255
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:44,816
How will you fool all the eyes and ears
here at the palace?

256
00:24:45,233 --> 00:24:47,402
Forget such a preposterous thought...

257
00:24:47,861 --> 00:24:51,072
and focus on looking after yourself
so that you can conceive again.

258
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:55,410
His Majesty is over 50 years old.

259
00:24:55,911 --> 00:24:58,497
What if His Majesty passes away
before I can conceive again?

260
00:25:00,373 --> 00:25:01,833
Will you just sit back and watch...

261
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:03,460
the Crown Prince,

262
00:25:06,421 --> 00:25:09,090
whom you absolutely despise,
ascending the throne?

263
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,974
Even His Majesty cannot lay
a finger on me after I conceive.

264
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:20,894
It can be done if we,
along with the guards at my palace...

265
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:25,273
and my court ladies, keep it a secret.

266
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,610
But Father...

267
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:32,030
will never accept a child...

268
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,116
who is not of our bloodline,
the Haewon Cho Clan.

269
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:36,618
That is why...

270
00:25:39,287 --> 00:25:41,373
we must keep it from Father.

271
00:25:43,708 --> 00:25:45,126
What if he finds out?

272
00:25:49,714 --> 00:25:52,259
You have been like this
since you were a little girl.

273
00:25:52,342 --> 00:25:56,972
You were born wicked and cunning,
and you were always awfully foolish.

274
00:25:57,722 --> 00:25:59,516
Because of your foolishness

275
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:02,310
and the ludicrous thing you did,

276
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,772
the Haewon Cho Clan
nearly faced its demise.

277
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,107
You are wrong.

278
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:08,483
I'm the one who protected it.

279
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:10,277
What can you protect
with that lowborn child

280
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:12,195
whose real mother we do not even know?

281
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,658
That is not the kind of country...

282
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,994
I am trying to build.

283
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:21,621
So what, then?

284
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:25,125
Will you give power back to Chang...

285
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:27,627
and enthrone him instead of this child?

286
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,548
The children of Prince Noseong,

287
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:35,468
who was exiled to Ganghwa Island,
are still alive.

288
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,430
No matter how distantly they are related,

289
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:40,932
they are still better
than that lowly child.

290
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:43,977
As for that lowborn baby...

291
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,689
I will kill him tonight.

292
00:26:47,772 --> 00:26:51,943
It won't end there.
From all your court ladies...

293
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:54,946
and palace guards to this physician,

294
00:26:56,489 --> 00:26:59,117
everyone who knows about this
will be killed.

295
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:01,911
Then,

296
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,082
you will become a sad queen dowager
who lost her baby...

297
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:08,335
and get locked in the West Palace...

298
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:20,680
for the rest of your life.

299
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,409
But Father will never accept

300
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:45,455
a child who is not of our bloodline,
the Haewon Cho Clan.

301
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:47,415
What if he finds out?

302
00:28:41,970 --> 00:28:43,722
You always despised and belittled me...

303
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:48,935
for being a girl.

304
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,359
That good-for-nothing girl...

305
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:02,699
will have everything at her feet now.

306
00:29:07,662 --> 00:29:09,831
Both the Haewon Cho Clan...

307
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,585
and this entire kingdom...

308
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,590
are at my command now.

309
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:32,812
YOGEUM GATE

310
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:34,105
Uncle...

311
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:04,928
People, listen to my words

312
00:30:06,805 --> 00:30:09,057
I hear that he died from the plague.

313
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:13,603
The plague killed even that powerful
Chief State Councillor.

314
00:30:14,687 --> 00:30:17,816
Both His Majesty
and now the Chief State Councillor

315
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:19,859
have passed away from the plague.

316
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:21,694
This country is ruined.

317
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:25,782
We will all die soon.

318
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:46,594
GANGHWA ISLAND

319
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:50,265
Gosh, it's freezing.

320
00:30:52,267 --> 00:30:54,394
Either come join me here or leave.

321
00:30:54,477 --> 00:30:57,397
Why stand there in this cold?

322
00:31:06,447 --> 00:31:07,699
You have not caught...

323
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:10,368
a single fish for hours.

324
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:13,788
Are you trying to pick a fight?

325
00:31:15,874 --> 00:31:17,917
We've run out of food ages ago.

326
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:20,920
The same goes for fish.
There is probably none left.

327
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:27,802
I will be thankful to catch one
even if I must wait for days.

328
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:34,642
They say
that the people worship food like God.

329
00:31:35,435 --> 00:31:38,563
But I must say,
this country is a complete mess.

330
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:44,694
Oh, hey! Grab that!

331
00:31:44,777 --> 00:31:48,448
Did you catch one? Did you?
Hold on. Stay put!

332
00:31:48,531 --> 00:31:51,117
Don't pull it.
No, don't pull it. Stay put.

333
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,620
Easy, be careful. Pull it gently.

334
00:31:53,703 --> 00:31:55,288
Now hand it over. Hand it--

335
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:04,213
That's...

336
00:32:04,547 --> 00:32:06,674
Darn it, some crappy day I'm having.

337
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:10,803
Listen,

338
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:13,139
let us never cross paths again, okay?

339
00:32:14,015 --> 00:32:15,266
Goodness.

340
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,102
Why did you...

341
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,938
I told you to just hold it.

342
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:23,608
Uncle.

343
00:32:30,823 --> 00:32:32,283
What did you just say?

344
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:34,577
According to our family tree,

345
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,246
you are my distant uncle.

346
00:32:39,415 --> 00:32:41,125
Although you have been forgotten,

347
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,336
but...

348
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,422
I suppose the royal blood in you
cannot be hidden.

349
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,634
"The people worship food like God."

350
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,846
Are you reading The Book of Han?

351
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:57,642
"The royal blood"?

352
00:32:59,811 --> 00:33:01,020
Wake up.

353
00:33:02,772 --> 00:33:04,816
Whether it belongs to you, me,

354
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,111
or some lowlife on the street,

355
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:11,447
it is just a red fluid called blood.

356
00:33:12,490 --> 00:33:15,076
It may be meaningless to you,

357
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,328
but in this country,

358
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,540
that blood holds great importance.

359
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:24,293
The royal blood that has been...

360
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,963
passed down through generations.

361
00:33:45,106 --> 00:33:47,358
The families of
the Military Training Corps soldiers...

362
00:33:48,192 --> 00:33:49,569
will be executed tomorrow.

363
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,281
So why are you...

364
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,325
still loyal to me?

365
00:33:58,494 --> 00:34:00,913
I heard about
what happened to your family.

366
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,126
Didn't you start helping me...

367
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,253
to get your family's revenge?

368
00:34:09,505 --> 00:34:11,591
Both Lord Ahn and Cho Hak-ju...

369
00:34:15,219 --> 00:34:17,346
have paid for their sins now.

370
00:34:20,975 --> 00:34:22,143
So...

371
00:34:26,814 --> 00:34:28,691
why are you still helping me?

372
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,570
Have we earned any meat...

373
00:34:33,529 --> 00:34:35,239
or even a single grain of rice?

374
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:40,328
Our lives haven't changed
even though they died.

375
00:34:40,745 --> 00:34:43,456
We are still hungry,
and this country is still a complete mess.

376
00:34:46,959 --> 00:34:48,127
But I believe...

377
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:52,840
that Your Royal Highness
can bring about some changes.

378
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,178
Am I wrong?

379
00:35:04,936 --> 00:35:07,438
It is a grave tragedy
for our country and family.

380
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:10,608
I was concerned as I could not neglect
my duty as the Queen,

381
00:35:10,900 --> 00:35:13,861
but you kindly took care of everything
for Father's funeral,

382
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,071
so I am truly grateful.

383
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:18,449
It is my duty
as Your Majesty's loyal subject.

384
00:35:20,451 --> 00:35:24,288
You never say no to me
because you are incredibly tenderhearted.

385
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,500
That is why I am fond of you, Beom-pal.

386
00:35:28,417 --> 00:35:29,252
I am...

387
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:32,588
-I am much obliged, Your--
-I have another favor to ask of you.

388
00:35:33,756 --> 00:35:37,468
Now that both my brother and father
have passed away,

389
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,763
I truly have no one.

390
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,850
I would like to...

391
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,894
appoint you as the head
of the Royal Commandery Division.

392
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:50,022
Please stay by my side
and protect me and my prince

393
00:35:50,106 --> 00:35:52,024
with the palace guards.

394
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,738
I will gladly obey Your Majesty's orders.

395
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:03,619
However, there is something
I must tell Your Majesty.

396
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,123
Before Uncle passed away,

397
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:10,126
he visited Your Majesty
with a female physician.

398
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,003
What happened to--

399
00:36:12,086 --> 00:36:15,423
I figured I wouldn't need her
as I already have a female physician here,

400
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,175
so I sent her back.

401
00:36:18,968 --> 00:36:19,844
I see.

402
00:36:52,501 --> 00:36:55,004
I heard you studied under the physician
Lee Seung-hui.

403
00:36:55,922 --> 00:36:56,964
Is it true?

404
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,220
Find out more
about the victims of the plague.

405
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,889
You will have to find out...

406
00:37:05,723 --> 00:37:07,558
a lot more than your teacher did.

407
00:37:14,982 --> 00:37:17,109
Like my father did,

408
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,739
I will use them...

409
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,200
to gain power.

410
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:40,039
