1
00:00:10,802 --> 00:00:12,804
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

2
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,805
THE FIVE ARMIES' BASE CAMP
IN MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

3
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:38,945
It is odd, sir.

4
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,907
There are only a few of them.
We should go to His Royal Highness.

5
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,885
What did you do...

6
00:07:09,637 --> 00:07:11,097
to His Royal Highness?

7
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:15,226
A criminal who committed high treason
does not deserve such a title.

8
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,687
You are the one
who committed high treason,

9
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,313
not His Royal Highness!

10
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,982
Let His Majesty be the judge of...

11
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,777
which one of us is indeed guilty
of high treason.

12
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:29,782
His Majesty kindly came
all the way here...

13
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,620
to punish the traitor himself.

14
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:48,384
Step aside.

15
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,138
I will not forgive anyone
who stands in my way.

16
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:55,683
Three years ago,

17
00:07:56,058 --> 00:08:00,146
you saved countless lives in Gyeongsang.

18
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,357
You are a man of
such remarkable wisdom and bravery,

19
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,819
so why did you decide
to side with the traitor?

20
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:11,157
I understand that you cannot desert him
for he was once your pupil.

21
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:15,828
But if you admit your wrongdoing now,

22
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:19,874
I will spare your life.

23
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,518
Father...

24
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,514
Everyone that I love

25
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:19,100
either died or was ousted.

26
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:22,311
You are my one and only son...

27
00:09:22,937 --> 00:09:24,855
and the most important person in my life.

28
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:29,151
So you must survive, no matter what.

29
00:09:30,486 --> 00:09:33,281
Survive and prove
that you are different from them,

30
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:35,408
as well as from me.

31
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,160
Show them what a true king...

32
00:09:38,911 --> 00:09:40,663
ought to be.

33
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,876
Father.

34
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:49,714
It's me, Chang.

35
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:02,893
Thanks to you,

36
00:10:04,145 --> 00:10:07,189
I have been living in hell
for the past three years.

37
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:11,736
I will not let you deceive me
like you did back then.

38
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,948
His Majesty...

39
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,118
already passed away.

40
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:24,540
But blinded by his greed for power,

41
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:26,834
Cho Hak-ju resurrected His Majesty...

42
00:10:29,128 --> 00:10:32,340
and turned him into a monster
with an insatiable hunger for human flesh.

43
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,551
Since His Majesty passed away,

44
00:10:36,677 --> 00:10:37,928
the throne...

45
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:40,848
should be passed down...

46
00:10:41,849 --> 00:10:43,684
to His Royal Highness
according to the law.

47
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,821
What are you waiting for?

48
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,323
Shoot him.

49
00:11:10,127 --> 00:11:12,421
Shoot him, or I will slay you as well.

50
00:11:38,114 --> 00:11:39,281
Shoot him down!

51
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:12,958
I...

52
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:17,046
beheaded...

53
00:13:19,673 --> 00:13:21,967
I beheaded my father.

54
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,137
Your Royal Highness.

55
00:13:28,182 --> 00:13:30,184
It is not your fault.

56
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,021
Your Royal Highness.

57
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:37,650
You are now...

58
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:43,823
the king of this kingdom.

59
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:24,071
Your Majesty!

60
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,819
The Five Armies...

61
00:15:05,487 --> 00:15:08,407
shall arrest the traitor
that dared to assassinate His Majesty...

62
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,245
as well as all of his men!

63
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,932
HANYANG

64
00:15:34,642 --> 00:15:39,021
ROYAL COMMANDERY DIVISION

65
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:44,485
Do you really plan to inspect

66
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,321
the private residence
of the Queen's family?

67
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:51,367
We found trails of blood from the creek
where that dead woman was found

68
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,619
all the way to Naeseonjae.

69
00:15:54,203 --> 00:15:56,288
I am certain
that she escaped from Naeseonjae.

70
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,206
Also,

71
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,542
she said more people
are held captive in that place.

72
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:02,378
We must investigate Naeseonjae.

73
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,629
This...

74
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:06,924
is obviously connected
to the Haewon Cho Clan.

75
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,718
Can you handle them, knowing their power?

76
00:16:11,345 --> 00:16:12,388
Right.

77
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,684
Like you said, the Haewon Cho Clan...

78
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,396
is the most powerful family
in this country.

79
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,355
However,

80
00:16:22,398 --> 00:16:24,233
we must get to the bottom of this

81
00:16:24,316 --> 00:16:26,485
and uncover the truth
if such a heinous event...

82
00:16:27,903 --> 00:16:29,738
actually took place there.

83
00:16:34,368 --> 00:16:38,122
The Royal Commandery Division
will investigate Naeseonjae.

84
00:16:41,792 --> 00:16:44,253
NAESEONJAE

85
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,096
We must hurry.

86
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:14,033
Hey, what are you doing?

87
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:15,993
Jeez, seriously.

88
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:18,829
You drunkard, you threw up everything.

89
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:19,830
Damn it.

90
00:17:19,913 --> 00:17:21,749
-I am dying.
-You puked all over me.

91
00:17:22,499 --> 00:17:23,417
Goodness.

92
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:24,960
Seriously.

93
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:32,760
What brings you here at this late hour?

94
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:36,430
We received a report
that there has been a murder here.

95
00:17:36,722 --> 00:17:39,224
We will search the house.
You must all cooperate.

96
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:42,436
-Spread out and search the place.
-Yes, sir!

97
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:45,731
This is a private residence
of Her Majesty's family.

98
00:17:45,814 --> 00:17:48,233
Everyone here is always careful
with their conduct

99
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,902
not to harm Her Majesty's reputation.

100
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:53,030
Such a horrible incident
could not have taken place here.

101
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,740
Search thoroughly!

102
00:18:16,303 --> 00:18:17,596
Who lives there?

103
00:18:18,138 --> 00:18:21,892
It is a place for guests,
but it has been empty for a long time.

104
00:19:03,517 --> 00:19:05,686
Sir, there is something you need to see.

105
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,070
Over here, sir.

106
00:19:17,364 --> 00:19:19,533
The soil is frozen
as we are in the middle of winter,

107
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:21,326
but this spot alone is soft.

108
00:19:22,327 --> 00:19:24,663
It looks like something
had been buried here.

109
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,269
This way. Let's go this way.

110
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:01,825
Catch those men carrying the palanquin!

111
00:20:01,909 --> 00:20:03,202
Catch them all!

112
00:20:03,285 --> 00:20:05,537
-Get them!
-Do not let anyone get away.

113
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,967
Block the way!

114
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:22,471
-Stop!
-Stop right there!

115
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:37,277
They were all...

116
00:20:38,028 --> 00:20:39,947
found at Naeseonjae?

117
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:41,323
Yes, sir.

118
00:20:41,865 --> 00:20:45,285
We found corpses
of seven pregnant women and infants.

119
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:49,665
The women were stabbed,
but something is odd about the children.

120
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:52,876
All the girls were strangled to death,

121
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,629
but it doesn't seem like
anything was done to the boy.

122
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,758
He must have been stillborn.

123
00:20:59,925 --> 00:21:00,801
But how...

124
00:21:01,802 --> 00:21:03,553
How could something like this happen?

125
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,183
Isn't it strange though?

126
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:11,603
Why is it that they killed
all the female newborns...

127
00:21:12,437 --> 00:21:14,731
but none of the boys?

128
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:18,777
What are you trying to say?

129
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:24,533
I do not know who did this,
but the culprit...

130
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:28,245
must have been after a baby boy.

131
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:41,800
It's the horn.

132
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,556
It means His Majesty passed away.

133
00:21:57,816 --> 00:21:59,943
What on earth happened?

134
00:22:03,363 --> 00:22:07,451
The Chief State Councillor,
who is in Joryeong, sent this letter.

135
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,957
In order to bring the plague
in Gyeongsang under control,

136
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,168
as well as to punish Chang
for committing high treason,

137
00:22:16,293 --> 00:22:18,211
His Majesty came all the way to Joryeong,

138
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,506
despite battling an illness
that was affecting His Majesty.

139
00:22:21,923 --> 00:22:25,218
We managed to bring the plague
under control in Mungyeong Saejae,

140
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,679
but Chang and his nefarious aides
took advantage of the chaos

141
00:22:27,763 --> 00:22:29,890
and raided us to seize the throne.

142
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:34,019
And Chang decapitated His Majesty
with his own two hands.

143
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:41,360
Your Majesty!

144
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:47,657
Please return to us, Your Majesty!

145
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,671
What should we do
with Lord Ahn Hyeon's corpse?

146
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:51,805
He was a hero who saved our country,
even though he sided with the traitor.

147
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:55,976
Dress him in shrouds
and give him a proper burial.

148
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:57,227
Yes, sir.

149
00:23:59,729 --> 00:24:01,231
The Ministers of Taxation and Rites...

150
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:02,357
HANYANG CONFERENCE HALL

151
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:04,025
...will oversee the state funeral.

152
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:06,695
The chief magistrate of
the Capital District Office

153
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:08,780
should double-check the route
to the burial site...

154
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,867
and build or repair bridges if necessary.

155
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:15,579
However, there is a more pressing issue.

156
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,540
The throne is vacant at the moment.

157
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,917
We must quickly decide
who will ascend the throne.

158
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:24,337
The Queen is acting as regent
at the moment.

159
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:27,924
Besides, the Queen
is expecting her baby soon.

160
00:24:29,134 --> 00:24:31,094
If a prince is born,

161
00:24:31,386 --> 00:24:33,555
he will naturally ascend the throne.

162
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,390
But what if it is not a boy?

163
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,145
We must find someone from
the collateral bloodlines to be prepared.

164
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:44,816
There are children of Prince Noseong,
who was exiled and executed in Ganghwa.

165
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,987
His children are His Majesty's
distant collateral relatives.

166
00:24:49,404 --> 00:24:51,156
Are you suggesting
we enthrone a puppet king?

167
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,200
The Second State Councillor is right.

168
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,911
We must follow the rule of primogeniture.

169
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:59,414
We should wait
until the Queen gives birth.

170
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,041
This is the head eunuch.

171
00:25:03,585 --> 00:25:06,463
We just heard
from the Office of Royal Delivery.

172
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:11,635
Her Majesty has just started
to experience labor pain.

173
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:15,722
The whole kingdom has been plagued
by misfortune as of late.

174
00:25:15,805 --> 00:25:18,099
I suppose we can expect
some good fortune now.

175
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:23,146
Let us wait for the time being
and pray that a prince will be born.

176
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:24,439
Yes.

177
00:25:24,523 --> 00:25:27,150
DELIVERY ROOM AT THE QUEEN'S PALACE

178
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,445
Her Majesty...

179
00:25:31,488 --> 00:25:33,949
has been waiting for you
and the female physician.

180
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,120
Let's go in.

181
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:51,174
Your Majesty, this is the head court lady.

182
00:26:04,521 --> 00:26:07,232
The royal physician is in the next room.

183
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,662
What happened
to the rest of the pregnant women?

184
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,249
I took care of them
as per Your Majesty's order.

185
00:26:34,134 --> 00:26:36,970
So you'd like me to push ahead
with the investigation on Naeseonjae?

186
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:38,346
That's right.

187
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,558
But be as discreet as possible
so that no one finds out.

188
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:42,892
Understood, sir.

189
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:44,436
We do not have much time.

190
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,896
We must find out the truth at all costs...

191
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,941
before the Queen gives birth.

192
00:26:52,986 --> 00:26:55,488
THE BASE CAMP IN MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

193
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:58,283
What brings you here?

194
00:26:58,366 --> 00:27:00,952
The magistrate ordered me to stop by

195
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:03,163
and check on His Royal Highness.

196
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,956
The magistrate said that?

197
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:06,916
Yes, sir.

198
00:27:08,793 --> 00:27:10,587
CHO BEOM-PAL

199
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,286
Your Royal Highness.

200
00:27:44,496 --> 00:27:46,081
Are you all right?

201
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:52,295
Going all the way to Hanyang
will not be easy.

202
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:56,633
First, I will treat your wound
to make sure it will not be infected.

203
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,801
They knew we were coming.

204
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:43,555
Someone set a trap for us.

205
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:45,807
That means...

206
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,768
there is a spy among us.

207
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:53,231
This isn't the time to doubt each other.

208
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,152
What do you mean?

209
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:59,028
I do not want to die here.

210
00:28:59,112 --> 00:28:59,946
No.

211
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:05,034
Even if I must die, I will be sure
to get my family's revenge first.

212
00:29:06,786 --> 00:29:09,122
Don't you all want to avenge
Lord Ahn Hyeon's death?

213
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,708
I would do anything if we can avenge...

214
00:29:12,292 --> 00:29:13,793
Lord Ahn's death.

215
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:16,463
Is there a way?

216
00:29:18,173 --> 00:29:19,716
If we're willing to risk our lives,

217
00:29:22,635 --> 00:29:24,971
we should at least be able
to take Cho Hak-ju with us.

218
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:29,976
Our only chance is...

219
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:32,520
just before we leave for Hanyang.

220
00:30:14,521 --> 00:30:15,730
What's the matter?

221
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,649
Is something wrong?

222
00:30:20,652 --> 00:30:22,612
We are ready to leave, sir.

223
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:27,283
Bring all the prisoners.

224
00:30:48,304 --> 00:30:49,639
Get up!

225
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,071
They are begging to be killed.

226
00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:48,948
Only spare the Crown Prince's life.

227
00:31:49,741 --> 00:31:51,492
Kill all the rest.

228
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,332
Stand guard!

229
00:32:36,412 --> 00:32:38,331
Arrest that bastard at once!

230
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:11,990
It's a monster!

231
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:18,454
It's a monster!

232
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:14,635
Shoot him in the head.

233
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:17,138
Aim for the head.

234
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:37,033
Your Royal Highness,
there is only one way...

235
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:41,204
you can survive.

236
00:34:41,537 --> 00:34:42,789
When I die,

237
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:46,250
bring me back to life...

238
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:50,338
and turn me into a monster.

239
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,050
You must do it...

240
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:58,262
to reveal the truth.

241
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:03,132
