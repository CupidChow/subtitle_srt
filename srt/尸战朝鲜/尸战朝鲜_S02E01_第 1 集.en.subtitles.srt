1
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:25,025
THREE YEARS AGO

2
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:25,942
JAPANESE FORCES

3
00:00:26,026 --> 00:00:26,901
JOSEON FORCES

4
00:00:27,402 --> 00:00:28,653
SANGJU

5
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:39,539
Is this the plant
that can bring the dead...

6
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,084
back to life?

7
00:00:44,586 --> 00:00:46,254
Yes, my lord.

8
00:00:48,339 --> 00:00:49,841
If you put...

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:54,262
the essence of this plant onto a needle
and insert it in the glabella of the dead,

10
00:00:54,345 --> 00:00:58,641
the body will revive as a monster that
eats the flesh and blood of living people.

11
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:01,102
But if the center of the brain is damaged,

12
00:01:02,145 --> 00:01:04,939
or if the body has already begun to decay,

13
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:07,650
resurrection will be impossible.

14
00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,599
We are surrounded by Japanese troops.

15
00:01:39,682 --> 00:01:42,018
Sangju is the last place standing
in the Gyeongsang Province.

16
00:01:42,102 --> 00:01:44,312
I heard they have reached
the Unpo Wetland.

17
00:01:44,729 --> 00:01:47,065
If they invade the Unpo Wetland,
Sangju will fall as well.

18
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:48,108
Then are we all...

19
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,359
going to die?

20
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:21,159
BASED ON THE KINGDOM OF THE GODS BY YLAB

21
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:43,593
How can this happen in broad daylight...

22
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,437
Hold your weapons and get into position.

23
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,739
It will not catch fire!

24
00:06:57,917 --> 00:06:58,918
Burn them!

25
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:04,966
Move back!

26
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:10,012
Ready the boat! Hurry!

27
00:07:10,388 --> 00:07:11,848
Hurry and ready the boat!

28
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,826
Pull! Now push!

29
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:46,841
Block them! Block their way!

30
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,423
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

31
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,425
The infected are approaching.

32
00:08:29,509 --> 00:08:30,885
Master!

33
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,222
The monsters have arrived
at Byeongseong Stream!

34
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:38,059
BYEONGSEONG STREAM

35
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,278
They will get through soon,
Your Royal Highness!

36
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:50,655
Prepare the cannons!

37
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:19,475
Bring the arrows! Hurry!

38
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,518
Get the arrows ready!

39
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:52,758
Do not fall back!

40
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:54,719
If they get through, we will all die!

41
00:09:54,802 --> 00:09:55,803
Yes, Your Royal Highness.

42
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,510
Your Royal Highness!

43
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:38,554
We cannot fight them any longer!

44
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:40,514
We must go, Your Royal Highness.

45
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:00,534
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

46
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,244
That is the fallback signal.

47
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,580
Prepare the rope ladders!

48
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:49,709
Oh, no.

49
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,085
-Oh, no.
-Goodness!

50
00:11:56,424 --> 00:11:57,466
He got bitten!

51
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:58,843
No...

52
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:00,970
It is just a small bite.

53
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,264
It will be okay.

54
00:12:06,434 --> 00:12:07,435
Stop.

55
00:12:07,768 --> 00:12:08,978
No!

56
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:10,479
No, please!

57
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,357
Help!

58
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,026
-Stay back.
-Help!

59
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,028
Go away. Do not come any closer.

60
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,822
Please!

61
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:21,699
Help!

62
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:24,910
No...

63
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:34,670
What do we do now?

64
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:36,922
We must go to Sangju.

65
00:12:37,298 --> 00:12:38,924
There will be a path there.

66
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:41,260
What if the monsters are there, too?

67
00:12:41,343 --> 00:12:43,220
Do you want to freeze to death here, then?

68
00:12:50,144 --> 00:12:53,981
BYEONGSEONG STREAM

69
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,652
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

70
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,071
-Help!
-Please help!

71
00:13:01,155 --> 00:13:02,406
-Come on!
-Help!

72
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:04,074
-Hurry! Climb up!
-Help us!

73
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:06,702
-Save me! Get down from there!
-Come up!

74
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:08,662
-The infected are here!
-Help me!

75
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,645
The infected have passed
Byeongseong Stream.

76
00:13:35,105 --> 00:13:38,150
Your Royal Highness, we must head
to the north branch of the stream.

77
00:13:38,234 --> 00:13:41,111
There is a passageway there
that was made during the war.

78
00:13:42,446 --> 00:13:43,906
Let's go. Escort him!

79
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,534
Hurry!

80
00:13:54,083 --> 00:13:57,127
HONGCHI GATE

81
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:23,153
-The gate is locked.
-Damn it!

82
00:14:25,197 --> 00:14:26,282
Damn...

83
00:14:26,365 --> 00:14:28,200
-Move aside!
-Form a barrier!

84
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:31,036
-Form a barrier!
-Make haste!

85
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,997
-Form a barrier!
-Quick!

86
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:34,582
Hurry!

87
00:14:43,632 --> 00:14:44,550
They are coming.

88
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:45,718
They are here!

89
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,177
The infected are coming!

90
00:14:47,261 --> 00:14:48,262
Hurry!

91
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:51,765
Form a barrier!

92
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,402
Make way!

93
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,285
Hurry!

94
00:15:57,831 --> 00:15:58,958
Get out of the way!

95
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:10,970
Your Royal Highness!

96
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:12,388
The gate is open!

97
00:16:12,513 --> 00:16:15,140
-Your Royal Highness!
-The gate is open!

98
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:16,934
-Your Royal Highness!
-Your Royal Highness!

99
00:16:17,017 --> 00:16:17,893
Your Royal Highness!

100
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,436
Your Royal Highness, hurry!

101
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,437
This way!

102
00:16:27,945 --> 00:16:29,363
Go inside! Now!

103
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:31,991
What are you doing?

104
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,451
You cannot do this.

105
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,660
Escort Lord Ahn! Hurry!

106
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,345
We must go.

107
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:17,471
I am sorry.

108
00:19:04,393 --> 00:19:05,435
Your Royal Highness.

109
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:09,857
What happened?

110
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:14,403
You told us they return
to being corpses in the morning.

111
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:17,364
I do not know what happened.

112
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:20,951
They used to disappear
when the sun came up.

113
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,246
I am sure of it.

114
00:19:39,136 --> 00:19:40,262
The reason...

115
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:44,975
is not important.

116
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,564
Seo-bi, help me. Please.

117
00:20:33,273 --> 00:20:34,816
Seo-bi!

118
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,683
Why are they still moving around?

119
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,477
Did they not disappear
when the sun came up?

120
00:21:11,853 --> 00:21:15,190
The resurrection plant likes the cold.

121
00:21:16,233 --> 00:21:18,193
If they have the same tendency,

122
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,070
they are not afraid of sunlight.

123
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:23,407
They only hate high temperatures.

124
00:21:24,199 --> 00:21:27,452
But since it is winter now,
it is still cold even when the sun is up.

125
00:21:27,536 --> 00:21:29,496
That is why they have not fallen asleep.

126
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:47,306
Their number has not increased
since yesterday.

127
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:52,019
What do you mean?

128
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:55,480
They are the only monsters nearby.

129
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:58,317
That is why their number
has not increased at all so far.

130
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:01,945
Let us say there are
no other monsters around here.

131
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:04,656
But there will be hundreds of them
near the citadel.

132
00:22:04,906 --> 00:22:06,825
How do we get all the way there?

133
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:09,369
No, we should head up there
instead of to the citadel.

134
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,872
We may be able to
stay away from them up there

135
00:22:11,955 --> 00:22:13,999
since they cannot cross the water.

136
00:22:16,501 --> 00:22:19,338
Seo-bi. Up the mountain?

137
00:22:19,421 --> 00:22:21,006
Where are you thinking of going?

138
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,801
Did you not tell me before

139
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:27,471
that you will be safe because
you belong to the Haewon Cho Clan?

140
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:29,222
Let us go to Mungyeong Saejae.

141
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:33,810
Wait, Seo-bi...

142
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:39,816
SUNGRYE GATE

143
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:50,410
Make sure you do not miss a spot.

144
00:22:51,995 --> 00:22:53,121
Spread some over there too.

145
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:55,624
There will be a plague soon
in Hanyang as well.

146
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:58,627
Hurry up.

147
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,837
I hear that ghosts are coming
from the south.

148
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:10,305
The Chief State Councillor has gone
to Mungyeong Saejae due to urgent matters.

149
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,642
What is so important that I had to leave
the State Council and come here?

150
00:23:13,892 --> 00:23:14,851
What do I need to see?

151
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:16,978
It is a very important matter.

152
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,398
You must see this for yourself, my lord.

153
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,245
What is this?

154
00:23:36,164 --> 00:23:38,917
We found these women
outside the north gate last night.

155
00:23:39,626 --> 00:23:41,670
According to the autopsy,

156
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:43,255
one of the women had just given birth.

157
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:46,716
The baby found with this woman

158
00:23:47,217 --> 00:23:49,928
was strangled to death
before we found them.

159
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,139
Did you find the culprit?

160
00:23:52,639 --> 00:23:55,851
They said this woman said something
before her death.

161
00:23:56,184 --> 00:23:59,312
She said that the people living
in her village hurt her and her child,

162
00:23:59,855 --> 00:24:02,941
and that they would kill everyone else
as well. Those were her last words.

163
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:04,818
Where is that village?

164
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,873
Naeseonjae of Samgye-dong,
outside the north gate.

165
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:20,041
"Naeseonjae"?

166
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,586
Yes, it is where the private residence...

167
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,297
of the Queen's family is located.

168
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:19,351
The Royal Commandery Division
has found out about Naeseonjae.

169
00:25:20,769 --> 00:25:24,105
We must seek help
from the Chief State Councillor.

170
00:25:24,189 --> 00:25:25,857
No, we cannot tell my father.

171
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:29,361
We must keep this a secret...

172
00:25:32,155 --> 00:25:33,740
from my father.

173
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:52,008
I just need to give birth to a prince.

174
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:57,514
Then whether it be the
Royal Commandery Division or anyone else,

175
00:26:00,141 --> 00:26:02,227
no one will be able to challenge me.

176
00:26:19,536 --> 00:26:21,371
Before the crescent moon sets,

177
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,583
set a ritual table
for the Goddess of Childbirth.

178
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:26,960
That day,

179
00:26:29,504 --> 00:26:32,424
you will have a prince in your arms.

180
00:26:43,351 --> 00:26:46,896
THE WALLS OF MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

181
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,836
He had a jade ornament
of the Haewon Cho Clan,

182
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,880
so we let him enter the gates.

183
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,174
Uncle!

184
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,348
It is your only nephew, Beom-pal.

185
00:27:22,015 --> 00:27:24,851
On the first day as a magistrate
in Dongnae, a strange disease broke out.

186
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,145
I barely made it out alive
and came all the way here.

187
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:29,189
Please take me in.

188
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:30,982
Right.

189
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,819
I was the one
who made you the magistrate of Dongnae.

190
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,991
But the only thing you did
in that position of high responsibility...

191
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,911
was save your own life?

192
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:48,917
Uncle, I do not understand what you mean.

193
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,795
Your job was to take care of Dongnae.

194
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:56,758
What were you doing
while the Commander of the Royal Army...

195
00:27:58,051 --> 00:28:01,805
was killed by the Crown Prince in Dongnae?

196
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:07,185
Are you saying Beom-il is dead?

197
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,188
I did not know.

198
00:28:10,647 --> 00:28:12,315
I really had no idea!

199
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:15,568
Please believe me!

200
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:19,197
You should be grateful...

201
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,993
that the Haewon Cho Clan's blood
runs in you.

202
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,456
He is the magistrate of Dongnae...

203
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,459
and the only heir to the Haewon Cho Clan.

204
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:34,838
Treat him accordingly.

205
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:39,801
What about that woman?

206
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:50,270
The thing is, she is a physician who
worked for the physician Lee Seung-hui.

207
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:53,398
She helped me get all the way here alive.

208
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:57,694
"The physician Lee Seung-hui"?

209
00:29:00,655 --> 00:29:01,906
Is that true?

210
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:07,120
Yes, my lord.

211
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:11,374
Prepare some lodgings for her too.

212
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,678
THE CITADEL OF SANGJU

213
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,271
Even if we save the food and eat little,

214
00:30:15,897 --> 00:30:17,607
the food will only last us five days.

215
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:21,236
There are so many refugees.

216
00:30:23,404 --> 00:30:26,908
Hand out food to everyone here
each morning.

217
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,411
It is right to save food,

218
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,956
but the people should not starve.

219
00:30:45,176 --> 00:30:47,387
This is not the disease we know.

220
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,640
It was not like this three years ago.

221
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:52,892
The infected only ate human flesh.

222
00:30:53,434 --> 00:30:55,270
Getting bitten did not lead to infection,

223
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,772
and the infected did not go wild like this
after sunrise.

224
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:01,860
Lord Cho Hak-ju...

225
00:31:02,902 --> 00:31:04,821
was hiding something about this disease.

226
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,322
He deceived you...

227
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:08,783
and all of us, my lord.

228
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,958
What exactly are you trying to say?

229
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,045
I believe...

230
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:24,048
we are paying for what we did then.

231
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:26,301
We are being punished.

232
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:32,181
Do you regret it?

233
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,227
My lord.

234
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:41,065
I do not regret it.

235
00:31:41,608 --> 00:31:44,485
Three years ago, we saved Sangju.

236
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:46,487
We saved Gyeongsang.

237
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:49,198
If I were given the choice again,

238
00:31:49,657 --> 00:31:51,367
I would do the same.

239
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,122
My apologies.

240
00:31:56,998 --> 00:31:59,042
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

241
00:31:59,626 --> 00:32:02,253
I will go and check the security
around the citadel with the others.

242
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:41,834
Your Royal Highness.

243
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:09,487
Your Royal Highness.

244
00:33:11,072 --> 00:33:13,074
I overheard Lord Ahn Hyeon
and one of his men...

245
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,035
saying something strange.

246
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,871
They seemed to know many things...

247
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,374
about the disease.

248
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:25,712
And it seems like Lord Cho Hak-ju
is involved as well.

249
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,840
Your Royal Highness.

250
00:33:29,424 --> 00:33:31,759
It would be best to leave this place
as soon as possible.

251
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:33,970
I will escort you, Your Royal Highness.

252
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:36,681
It will be safe once we go back
through the passageway

253
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,267
and cross the north branch.

254
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:47,900
Why are you telling me this?

255
00:33:50,069 --> 00:33:50,987
Pardon?

256
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,163
Did Cho Hak-ju order you to?

257
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:03,166
Your Royal Highness.

258
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,335
Lord Ahn Hyeon told me...

259
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:09,881
that the palace guards knew
I was coming here.

260
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,177
Was it your doing?

261
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:21,934
Are you...

262
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,897
trying to drive a wedge...

263
00:34:26,773 --> 00:34:28,566
between him and me now?

264
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,110
Your Royal Highness.

265
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:37,366
Do you not trust me?

266
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,789
I left my pregnant wife,

267
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,542
my family, and everything I had...

268
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,463
and followed you
all the way here to Gyeongsang.

269
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:56,427
Do you still not trust me,
Your Royal Highness?

270
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:05,561
Fire!

271
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:08,731
There is a fire!

272
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,317
Fire!

273
00:35:12,568 --> 00:35:13,736
Fire!

274
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:12,587
What about the food?

275
00:36:13,212 --> 00:36:15,339
Did you take out all the food
that was inside?

276
00:36:15,923 --> 00:36:16,883
We could not, sir.

277
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:22,847
What were you doing all this time?

278
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,224
What were you doing while that happened?

279
00:36:25,308 --> 00:36:26,726
We do not know, sir.

280
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,477
There was a sudden explosion, and...

281
00:36:28,561 --> 00:36:29,645
You fool!

282
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,900
Do you not know how valuable
that warehouse was?

283
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:37,111
The lives of everyone in the citadel
depended on the food that was inside!

284
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:38,237
I am sorry.

285
00:36:38,779 --> 00:36:39,739
It is all my fault.

286
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,116
Such insolence!

287
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,075
It was me!

288
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:47,914
It was me.

289
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,255
It was not their fault.

290
00:36:58,716 --> 00:36:59,592
It was me.

291
00:37:02,094 --> 00:37:03,346
I did it.

292
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:07,934
I could not let my child starve to death,

293
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,062
so I was just trying to take some rice.

294
00:37:12,188 --> 00:37:13,814
I did not know this would happen.

295
00:37:14,857 --> 00:37:16,192
I accidentally...

296
00:37:16,692 --> 00:37:18,444
I accidentally dropped my lamp.

297
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,033
I am so sorry.

298
00:37:27,328 --> 00:37:28,162
Just...

299
00:37:29,747 --> 00:37:31,415
Just kill me.

300
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,343
We are all...

301
00:37:43,761 --> 00:37:45,096
going to die anyway.

302
00:37:47,974 --> 00:37:49,183
Whether we starve to death...

303
00:37:52,311 --> 00:37:54,397
or get bitten by those monsters,

304
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:58,109
we are all going to die.

305
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:19,714
MUNGYEONG SAEJAE

306
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,614
Do you think that will provide some way
to stop the disease?

307
00:38:46,198 --> 00:38:49,994
However severe the disease,
there was always a way to stop it.

308
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:52,121
This disease will not be any different.

309
00:38:52,997 --> 00:38:54,707
If I study this plant some more,

310
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:58,002
I am sure I can find a way
to stop this disease.

311
00:38:58,711 --> 00:39:02,798
We will be safe as long as
we stay in Mungyeong Saejae.

312
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:09,680
I believe there are people still alive
in the citadel of Sangju.

313
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:14,101
We have to save those people.

314
00:39:15,436 --> 00:39:17,772
Right, His Royal Highness...

315
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:20,816
What are you holding in your hand?

316
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,989
Hand it over, now!

317
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,925
Do you know what this plant is?

318
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,142
It is called the resurrection plant,

319
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:57,228
known to bring back the dead.

320
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:00,272
That plant...

321
00:40:01,732 --> 00:40:03,359
is what caused this disease.

322
00:40:05,152 --> 00:40:06,946
How do you know this?

323
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:12,827
I only found out through this physician.

324
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:18,207
Tell him how you learned about this.

325
00:40:24,296 --> 00:40:27,925
"The resurrection plant
brought the dead king back to life.

326
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,720
And that caused the disease."

327
00:40:33,681 --> 00:40:35,808
Is that what Lee Seung-hui told you?

328
00:40:36,517 --> 00:40:38,144
What do you mean?

329
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,771
"The dead king"?

330
00:40:42,898 --> 00:40:43,941
Please have mercy.

331
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:47,153
I only found that plant
after reading about it

332
00:40:47,236 --> 00:40:48,946
in his patient journal.

333
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:51,740
You read about it in his patient journal?

334
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:55,536
Then do you know...

335
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:59,457
how to resurrect the dead as well?

336
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:10,134
"If you mash the resurrection plant,
put it on a needle,

337
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,137
and insert it one pun deep
into the glabella,

338
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,765
the dead will come back to life
in two hours."

339
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,809
That was what was written in his journal.

340
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,486
I will take that girl to Hanyang as well.

341
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:32,948
Make the preparations.

342
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:34,450
Yes, my lord.

343
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,119
Are you going to Hanyang? When?

344
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:44,877
There is still something I must do.

345
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:47,213
Something I must finish.

346
00:41:48,339 --> 00:41:50,633
I will go back to Hanyang
after I finish it...

347
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:54,094
and meet the new future prince.

348
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:03,687
SANGJU, LORD AHN HYEON'S RESIDENCE

349
00:42:04,605 --> 00:42:05,439
What...

350
00:42:06,232 --> 00:42:07,858
What did you just say,
Your Royal Highness?

351
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:11,987
I will go to Mungyeong Saejae.

352
00:42:12,696 --> 00:42:13,531
Your Royal Highness.

353
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:17,993
How do you plan to go there
with all those monsters outside?

354
00:42:18,661 --> 00:42:20,412
I must go there
if I want to save everyone.

355
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,374
Please pick out the best of your men.

356
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,141
I will lead the way, Your Royal Highness.

357
00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:53,070
Let's go.

358
00:45:41,739 --> 00:45:43,157
Put out your fires now.

359
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:08,849
The north branch is very close
to the passageway.

360
00:46:08,932 --> 00:46:11,643
The monsters fear water,
so if we cross the river,

361
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,313
we can get away from them.

362
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:16,940
Even if you cross the north branch,

363
00:46:17,024 --> 00:46:19,359
it will not be easy to enter
Mungyeong Saejae.

364
00:46:20,235 --> 00:46:21,862
The Five Armies will be
guarding the gates.

365
00:46:22,404 --> 00:46:26,283
The number of soldiers has dropped to
a tenth due to the war three years ago.

366
00:46:26,909 --> 00:46:29,703
There are about 5,000 elite soldiers
in Hanyang alone.

367
00:46:30,245 --> 00:46:31,872
Even with Cho Hak-ju's power,

368
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,792
it would have been difficult...

369
00:46:36,043 --> 00:46:37,586
to send all those men.

370
00:46:38,253 --> 00:46:39,671
At most, the number...

371
00:46:40,214 --> 00:46:42,132
will not go over 2,500,
which is half of that.

372
00:46:42,216 --> 00:46:45,594
That would be a small number
to be guarding...

373
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,347
all the gates in Gyeongsang.

374
00:46:48,889 --> 00:46:50,015
That is right.

375
00:46:51,016 --> 00:46:52,851
If they are spread out
and guarding every gate,

376
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,020
the number of men guarding
Mungyeong Saejae...

377
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,189
will not be more than 500.

378
00:46:57,272 --> 00:46:58,565
They would not be able to guard

379
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:01,693
every part of Mungyeong Saejae's walls
with that number.

380
00:47:01,777 --> 00:47:05,447
The northwest side of the first gate
has high walls,

381
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,991
so it functions as a defense by itself.

382
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:10,369
There is a high chance
that fewer men would be guarding it.

383
00:47:10,452 --> 00:47:12,246
WEST SIDE, SOUTH SIDE

384
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:17,334
So, what do you plan on doing
once you get to Mungyeong Saejae?

385
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:25,092
I will...

386
00:47:27,427 --> 00:47:28,804
kill Cho Hak-ju.

387
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,015
He disregarded the poverty and starvation
of the people,

388
00:47:32,099 --> 00:47:34,268
and tried to take something
that he should not have.

389
00:47:34,977 --> 00:47:37,187
I will punish him
and return to my rightful place.

390
00:47:38,397 --> 00:47:42,025
I will save the people from
this disastrous starvation and disease.

391
00:47:43,068 --> 00:47:44,736
And I will survive...

392
00:47:48,866 --> 00:47:51,034
and create a new world.

393
00:51:31,880 --> 00:51:33,882
