00:10:07,790 --> 00:10:09,460
Men think in a way

00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,530
Mr. Lou has also been acting strange lately.

192
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,280
Why?

193
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:17,500
The hot spring resort is a small place.

194
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:19,260
But he got lost.

195
00:10:19,460 --> 00:10:20,720
He asked me to pick him up.

196
00:10:20,830 --> 00:10:23,750
And he treated me to hairy crabs gently.

197
00:10:24,110 --> 00:10:25,100
Isn't that strange?

198
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,300
He's trying to get close to you.

199
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:29,660
I think

200
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:31,280
he treats me so well

201
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,990
because he's up to something.

202
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,590
He probably wants me to revise his manuscripts a few more times.

203
00:10:36,030 --> 00:10:37,330
No. I have to be very concentrated

204
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,100

Did you really come here

207
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,470
because you saw the socks advertisement?

208
00:10:48,140 --> 00:10:49,990
I don't know your name,

210
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,700
you've become more imposing.

You are discerning.

Yes, of course.

It's one of the best companies in the industry.

223

It's a big company with a wide business range.

224
00:11:21,660 --> 00:11:22,930
It's not big.

225
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,590

00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:31,610
Not now. Let's go.

376
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:33,180
What?

377
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:34,620
Let's go eat. Cao Ya is waiting.

378
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,820
Who? Cao Ya?

I'm not feeling well today.

383
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,340
-You two go.
-Stand up.

384
00:17:43,990 --> 00:17:45,450
Something is wrong with you today.

385
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,950
Me?

386
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,610
Did you do something that makes you feel guilty for me?

387
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,520
Let's keep the brotherly love in our hearts.

388
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,870
Why would I do anything like that?

389
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,820
You're a director after all.

390
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:05,730
Change your perfume.

This one is not okay?

Whatever.

The CEO of Xianling.

395
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,890
Is it Xianling with over 500 employees?

396
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,480
He must be rich now.

397
00:18:34,260 --> 00:18:36,410
Did he marry that girl?

You have to be cautious this time.

406
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:55,100
He must be up to no good.

I bet he wants to be with you again.

411
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:05,480
I think you've watched too many dramas.

And you know what?

414
00:19:09,460 --> 00:19:10,310
An ex is like

00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,100
expired cola.

416
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,990
You couldn't feel it when you drank it.

417
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,060
But after the carbonic acid is gone,

418
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:18,460
you'll find it's too sweet.

419
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,220
And it tastes bad and makes you gain weight.

420
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:23,260
I was blind back then.

421
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:24,740
Yes. Me too.

single now?

436
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:24,340
Mr. Zhang, if it's personal,

437
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,300

During these three years,

440
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:32,050
it must have been difficult to be a customer service staff member, right?

441

Mr. Zhang,

561
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,180
Sorry, Mr. Lou.

562
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,660
Is there anything else that should be revised?

563
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:09,280
Nothing. You did a good job.

564
00:26:10,580 --> 00:26:11,760
It's almost time for dinner.

565
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:13,430
Let's have a working lunch together before you go back.

566
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,260
Okay.

567
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:21,940
Should I ask her

568
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:23,550
or not?

569
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,540
Will she think

570
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:26,180
I'm inquiring about her privacy?

571
00:26:28,490 --> 00:26:29,330
Just now...

572
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:31,200
what were you busy with?

573
00:26:31,690 --> 00:26:33,450
Nothing. It's just a personal matter.

574
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:37,010
It's not working hours now.

575
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,140
You can tell me if you want to.

576
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,220
My ex came back to me.

577
00:26:41,790 --> 00:26:42,980
Ex-boyfriend?

578
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:46,850
Ex-boyfriend?

579
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,070
Does he want to be with you again?

580
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,720
Probably. Why else would he come back?

581
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:51,540
Right?

582
00:26:52,350 --> 00:26:54,010
He still likes you.

583
00:26:58,540 --> 00:26:59,380
What about you?

584
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,290
Do you still like him?

585
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:01,620
Of course not.

586
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,060
That was years ago.

587
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:04,150
I've let it go long ago.

588
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,060
Then it's easy.

589
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,850
After all, he's your ex.

590
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,780
Blacklist him and stop contacting him.

591
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:12,740
Yes.

592
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,740
But he somehow has become my client.

593
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,380
I have to give Ba'er the credit

594
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,450
for your working capability.

595
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:24,110

596
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:24,900

598
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,500

600

601
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:32,260
I wouldn't give my ex a chance.

602
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,030
After all, we've broken up.

603
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:35,180
It means we are not suitable for each other.

604
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:37,300
No matter how long it has been,

605
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,780
we won't be together again.

606
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:40,290
Lou Yuan,

607
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,210
people change.

608
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:43,860
Maybe you had problems back then.

609
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,980
But people keep improving

610
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:46,180
and growing.

611
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:47,180
Now that the problems are gone,

612
00:27:47,260 --> 00:27:48,140
why can't you

613
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,420
give you a chance?

614
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,140
What chance?

615
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:51,980
It will end the same way even if I give a chance, right?

616
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:52,780
It will only make me upset.

617
00:27:52,890 --> 00:27:54,780
You're getting more evil.

618
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,860
How did you become like this?

619
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:56,820
Why?

620
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,770
Tell me why.

621
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,010
I don't want to talk to you.

622
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:06,930
Ignore him.

623
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:07,940
Let's eat.

624
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,140
It seems the conversation

625
00:28:12,140 --> 00:28:14,420
is not about me anymore.

626
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,180
Later, sort this file out

627
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:16,780
and send it to my email.

I'm a little embarrassed.

in front of the bar

664
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,230
