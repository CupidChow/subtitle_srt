He said he could return the deposit.

But the economic environment is not good now.

212

00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,220
They had a big fight.

380
00:15:03,330 --> 00:15:04,620
And it ended just like that.

381
00:15:06,090 --> 00:15:07,460
This is fate.

382
00:15:07,460 --> 00:15:08,700
It's bygones.

383
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:10,020
As long as they don't have any grudges,

384
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,580
there's a chance to turn things around.

385
00:15:12,810 --> 00:15:13,900
It's hard to say.

386
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:15,460
It's been so many years.

387
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:17,280
They should have contacted each other if they want to.

388
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,480
Why haven't they contacted each other?

389
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:20,590
Their feelings have faded.

390
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,820
If their feelings have faded,

391
00:15:22,820 --> 00:15:23,660
Auntie Lou wouldn't have said

392
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,420
she didn't want to see him

393
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,540
when she heard Mr. Chen's name, right?

394
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:30,420
Do you think it's about dignity?

395
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:31,780
Dignity?

396
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:35,020
People in their generation

397
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:37,100
are reserved about love.

398
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:39,740
No one wanted to take the first step.

399
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,640
So they missed each other.

400
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:45,390
But aren't we going to meet Mr. Chen tomorrow?

401
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,190
Right.

402
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:48,120
Let's see what Mr. Chen's attitude is.

403
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:49,310
Okay.

404
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:50,650
I'm gonna set an alarm for 6 o'clock.

405
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,560
Six o'clock?

406
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,340
It's too early.

407
00:15:54,820 --> 00:15:56,830
So tonight, you have to be good.

408
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:00,550
What are you doing?

409
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,260
Come on.

410
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,010
It's not up to you.

411
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:07,030
Come on.

412
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:18,230
You're up.

413
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,040
Why didn't you get more sleep?

414
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,950
You only slept for 4 hours yesterday.

415
00:16:22,830 --> 00:16:23,790
It's okay.

416
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,170
I can sleep on our way later.

417
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,580
Okay.

418
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,500
I'll drive later,

419
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:30,260
and you can take a nap.

420
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,990
You're so nice.

421
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:36,500
Right.

422
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,290
The succulent plants are growing quite well.

423
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,470
Did you learn it secretly before?

424
00:16:40,550 --> 00:16:41,540
I've been able to grow them since childhood.

425
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,940
There are so many of them in my hometown.

426
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,340
They can live even if you throw them on the ground.

427
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:46,430
You grow this in your hometown?

428
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:47,490
Pigs like eating them.

429
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,140
Pigs?

430
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:50,710
Why do pigs like eating succulent plants?

431
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,800
Succulent plants are so cute.

432
00:16:54,630 --> 00:16:57,130
Pigs also think they are cute.

433
00:16:57,910 --> 00:16:59,230
Pigs also think they are cute?

434
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:02,390
Pigs also think they are cute?

435
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:03,750
Dong Dong'en,

436
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,819
you're saying your boyfriend is a pig, right?

437
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:06,740
I was wrong.

438
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:07,500
Dong Dong'en.

439
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,589
Hello, Mr. Chen.

440
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,660
I'm Dong Dong'en. I'm the person who contacted you.

441
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,460
Sorry

442
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:25,890
for troubling you today.

443
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:27,310
Hello, Uncle Chen.

444
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm Lou Yuan.

445
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:29,450
It's been so many years.

446
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,410
You still look spirited.

447
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:33,720
I didn't even say anything.

448
00:17:33,740 --> 00:17:35,060
How do you know I'm spirited?

449
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:37,990
You have grown up and become glib-tongued.

450
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:39,750
It's been so many years.

451
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,270
You still remember me?

452
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:42,540
Yes.

453
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:43,440
Of course I remember you.

454
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:47,790
I'm afraid you've forgotten me long ago.

455
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,760
What are you waiting for? Come in.

456
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:52,420
Coming.

457
00:17:52,710 --> 00:17:53,740
Let's go.

458
00:18:00,970 --> 00:18:03,150
Since you've come in, you are my guests now.

459
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,380
You should drink this hot tea.

460
00:18:06,180 --> 00:18:06,860
Thank you.

461
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,460
I love hot tea the most.

462
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:09,260
Please.

463
00:18:11,550 --> 00:18:14,140
This is the project proposal of our dining saloon.

464
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:15,290
Please have a look.

465
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,300
For your convenience,

466
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:17,570
I chose a bigger font size.

467
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,480
You're very thoughtful.

468
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,660
Ms. Mudan

469
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,020
has put in great effort for the dining saloon.

470
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,090
We chose you

471
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,690
because we think your design

472
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:28,780
suits the style of our dining saloon very well.

473
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:32,500
Then I have to take this in and take a closer look.

474
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,020
Okay.

475
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,070
Help yourselves.

476
00:18:35,510 --> 00:18:36,260
Thank you.

477
00:19:07,310 --> 00:19:10,320
[Lou Mudan]

478
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,320
Let's go take a look around.

479
00:19:38,830 --> 00:19:39,720
It's expensive.

480
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,520
What should we do?

481
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,130
Fix it.

482
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,660
Are you tearing down my house?

483
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:24,520
It's so noisy.

484
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,180
Mr... Mr. Chen, I'm sorry.

485
00:20:29,180 --> 00:20:31,460
It fell off when I touched it.

486
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:32,420
I'm sorry. Sorry.

487
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,770
It's broken.

488
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:37,930
It's useless.

489
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:41,300
My friend asked me to make this photo frame

490
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:42,400
for his granddaughter.

491
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,260
Considering the value of the wood,

492
00:20:44,260 --> 00:20:44,980
it's not worth too much money.

493
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:47,600
But the meaning

494
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,970
is priceless.

495
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,830
I'm sorry. What do you...

496
00:20:50,890 --> 00:20:51,930
Well...

497
00:20:51,950 --> 00:20:53,110
No need to apologize.

498
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:55,430
If you really want to make it up to me,

499
00:20:56,430 --> 00:20:57,520
stay and help me.

500
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:00,710
What do I need to do?

501
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:02,780
Give it to me.

502
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:07,150
In the courtyard,

503
00:21:07,390 --> 00:21:08,980
there are wood, a saw,

504
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,150
and a table.

505
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:13,070
Cut this into four segments with the same length

506
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:14,740
and then polish them inside.

507
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:15,930
But it's gonna take some time

508
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,950
to do this well.

509
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:19,120
You decide

510
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:21,980
whether you'll leave or stay.

511
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:27,180
Stay. We'll stay.

512
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:27,940
Then get started.

513
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:39,340
♫You pretend and put on a show of enthusiasm♫

514
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,040
♫It's insincere♫

515
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:45,250
♫But you still act like it's genuine♫

516
00:21:45,670 --> 00:21:47,370
♫Thinking that no one can see through♫

517
00:21:47,610 --> 00:21:51,490
♫Your little schemes♫

518
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,570
♫Well, then, I'll play along to the end♫

519
00:21:55,970 --> 00:21:59,670
♫Let's see who gives in and waves the white flag first♫

520
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,240
♫I really appreciate♫

521
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:06,670
♫The opportunity to improve my acting skills♫

522
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:10,690
♫Once again, I bump into you, just like back then♫

523
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:12,020
♫With no plan at all♫

524
00:22:12,210 --> 00:22:14,520
♫Conversations hinting at old memories♫

525
00:22:14,930 --> 00:22:16,010
♫Both spoken and unspoken♫

526
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:20,780
♫Those little expressions of yours, wanting to be angry but not daring♫

527
00:22:21,020 --> 00:22:23,550
♫Oh, how cute♫

528
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,720
♫Our tug-of-war has gradually turned into♫

529
00:22:27,050 --> 00:22:28,190
♫A competition♫

530
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:30,750
♫Even when expectations fall short♫

531
00:22:30,990 --> 00:22:32,270
♫I can't bear to turn and walk away♫

532
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,740
♫Even if you want to deny it♫

533
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,230
The air outside is really fresh.

534
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:36,910
♫Your gaze♫

535
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:39,950
♫Has already revealed the truth♫

536
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,090
We can also see the stars clearly.

537
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:41,080
I have to say

538
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:42,230
♫All the signals of affection♫

539
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:43,070
Uncle Chen has chosen a good place.

540
00:22:42,500 --> 00:22:44,460
♫Have been dodged by you perfectly♫

541
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,050
He knows how to enjoy life.

542
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,070
♫If I don't take the initiative♫

543
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:47,220
I think he has an optimistic attitude,

544
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:48,380
♫I'm afraid I'll never receive your love confession♫

545
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,980
so he doesn't look old at all.

546
00:22:48,550 --> 00:22:50,980
♫There is a sweet relationship♫

547
00:22:49,190 --> 00:22:51,650
He's like a stubborn old boy,

548
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,600
♫I'd like to invite you to talk about yourself♫

549
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:52,900
full of energy.

550
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,420
Speaking of this,

551
00:22:53,870 --> 00:22:55,760
♫Do you dare to come?♫

552
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:55,980
I remember something when I was a kid.

553
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:57,900
When I got home from school,

554
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,300
at the front door, as long as I heard someone

555
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:01,300
nagging

556
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:02,250
around my mom,

557
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,720
it must be Uncle Chen.

558
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:06,330
But he used to smile a lot.

559
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:08,420
And he looked very friendly.

560
00:23:08,900 --> 00:23:09,900
He was not like now.

561
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,660
He has been serious all day.

562
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,300
Tell me.

563
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:17,860
If Mr. Chen accepts this job

564
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:20,020
and sees Ms. Mudan again,

565
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:21,980
will he... will he smile?

566
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:25,490
Maybe.

567
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:28,110
I think he'd want to reject this job

568
00:23:28,830 --> 00:23:31,080
only because he's afraid my mom would be unhappy when she sees him.

569
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,020
Like you said,

570
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,460
maybe he's afraid that he hasn't let it go,

571
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,020
but my mom has let it go.

572
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,760
Isn't that embarrassing?

573
00:23:42,110 --> 00:23:44,730
Do you think he hasn't let it go?

574
00:23:45,770 --> 00:23:47,310
During the daytime, I found

575
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,690
there was a miniature landscape

576
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:49,940
next to his operating table.

577
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:51,940
The miniature landscape

578
00:23:52,030 --> 00:23:53,610
is our house in the hometown.

579
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:54,930
You've been there before.

580
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:08,860
Some people are destined to miss each other

581
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:10,640
because of misunderstandings

582
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,950
or some unavoidable reasons.

583
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:20,790
Many people in their generation

584
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:22,910
are not willing to share their thoughts.

585
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,900
I'm not like them.

586
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:24,910
If I like you,

587
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:26,360
I'll say it boldly.

588
00:24:27,630 --> 00:24:28,390
So

589
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,320
whether it's a misunderstanding

590
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,330
or a concern,

591
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:33,790
we have to tell each other sincerely.

592
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,180
As long as we say it out,

593
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,430
we can face it together

594
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,440
and solve it together.

595
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:42,860
What if you meet someone better than me?

596
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,960
What does that have to do with me?

597
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,560
What if I'm angry?

598
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:50,910
If you're angry, I'll make you happy immediately.

599
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:54,240
What if I am unreasonable and want to leave?

600
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:56,660
Then I'll hold your thighs and cry until I soften you up.

601
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:00,870
What do you think? Are you satisfied?

602
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,090
Uncle Chen.

603
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:54,380
I'm interested in this project.

604
00:25:54,730 --> 00:25:55,800
I want to give it a try.

605
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,350
Go back and tell Mudan.

606
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,600
Are you okay with a competitive presentation?

607
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,750
No kid can defeat me.

608
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:03,620
I'm older than them

609
00:26:03,620 --> 00:26:05,460
and I'm more experienced than them.

610
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:07,470
Since Uncle Chen has agreed,

611
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:09,020
it means you are very confident.

612
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:12,270
Why did you suddenly agree?

613
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,430
It's an old house

614
00:26:15,540 --> 00:26:16,830
with a wood structure.

615
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:18,700
The soundproof effect is bad.

616
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,540
Sorry.

617
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,540
We didn't mean to talk about elders behind your backs.

618
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,890
It's bygones.

619
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:29,010
Forget it.

620
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:31,910
But people in our generation

621
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:36,580
do lack some courage to be shameless.

622
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:37,650
Don't say that.

623
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,260
If my mom knows you have agreed,

624
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,330
she would be very happy.

625
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,800
I know her best.

626
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,530
We don't know if I can make it.

627
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:46,360
But

628
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,750
I'll do my best.

629
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,820
Then we'll go back and wait for your design draft.

630
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:04,780
Okay.

631
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,210
Dad, let me carry it.

632
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:06,940
Don't worry about me.

633
00:27:06,940 --> 00:27:07,940
Go help your mom.

634
00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:08,910
Mom, be careful.

635
00:27:09,340 --> 00:27:10,780
Did you have fun?

636
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,620
Yes, we went to many places.

637
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,100
It was fun.

638
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:13,580
Really?

639
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:16,540
We bought a lot of local specialties. They're all your favorite things.

640
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:17,820
Then where...

641
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,060
It's very convenient now.

642
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:19,340
Yes.

643
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,490
They'll be delivered here directly.

644
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:21,020
That's right.

645
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,180
All right, let's go home.

646
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,740
Let's go home.

647
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:23,220
You...

648
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,940
It has caught my eyes.

649
00:27:24,940 --> 00:27:26,940
What are you wearing?

650
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,500
What is it?

651
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:29,740
It's pretty.

652
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,880
Lou Yuan gave it to me.

653
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:34,200
He proposed to me.

654
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:35,720
Proposed?

655
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:37,230
With this?

656
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:41,750
Why are your shoulders so stiff?

657
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:45,490
I just looked through my phone for a long time yesterday.

658
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:46,920
You have cervical spondylosis again.

659
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:48,540
Is the strength okay?

660
00:27:48,650 --> 00:27:49,380
Yes.

661
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,980
But your hands are too tough.

662
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:56,300
I'll feel more comfortable

663
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:58,140
if someone with softer hands gives me a massage.

664
00:27:58,160 --> 00:28:00,370
You're quite demanding. Softer hands.

665
00:28:00,900 --> 00:28:01,860
What do you mean?

666
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,050
My daughter-in-law's hands. What else can I mean?

667
00:28:04,160 --> 00:28:05,380
You silly boy.

668
00:28:06,610 --> 00:28:08,290
If you really want to make me happy,

669
00:28:08,310 --> 00:28:09,910
find me a daughter-in-law.

670
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,460
I know. I'll keep that in mind.

671
00:28:12,780 --> 00:28:14,040
I don't believe you.

672
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,580
If I believe you,

673
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,220
I'll have to wait for a long time.

674
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,980
I've made an arrangement for you tomorrow.

675
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,010
Have dinner with Li Li'an tomorrow.

676
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:23,870
Look at that girl. She's pretty

677
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,950
and capable.

678
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,340
And you two are childhood sweethearts.

679
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:26,980
That's great.

680
00:28:27,070 --> 00:28:28,270
You two are perfect together.

681
00:28:28,350 --> 00:28:29,080
Right?

682
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:30,500
Looks like you're not tired.

683
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,220
You've even made an arrangement for me.

684
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:32,940
What's wrong?

685
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,100
No.

686
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,300
I can't go have dinner with Li Li'an tomorrow.

687
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,600
Why not?

688
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,100
You have to go.

689
00:28:39,710 --> 00:28:40,620
Look.

690
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:42,020
You'll be 30 soon.

691
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,020
In a few years,

692
00:28:43,210 --> 00:28:43,890
well,

693
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,170
you'll get bald.

694
00:28:46,190 --> 00:28:47,700
You'll have a beer belly. You'll get weak.

695
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,060
And no pretty girls

696
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,140
will like you by that time.

697
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,180
Mom, look at what you said.

698
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,580
Men are charming in their 30s.

699
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,100
Don't bother to find me a girlfriend.

700
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:55,100
I won't go tomorrow.

701
00:29:00,970 --> 00:29:03,140
Do you have a girlfriend?

702
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:03,580
No.

703
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,580
You won't tell me?

704
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:05,660
Look at what you said. No.

705
00:29:05,770 --> 00:29:06,540
Don't ask.

706
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,800
I don't know how to say this.

707
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:12,950
Lower your head.

708
00:29:14,860 --> 00:29:16,010
What is this?

709
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,300
I've never seen you wear it before.

710
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:18,260
Well, Mom, this...

711
00:29:18,370 --> 00:29:19,780
This is a ring.

712
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,740
It's for fun.

713
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,740
I'm wearing it for fun.

714
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,060
Who bought it for you?

715
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,960
Lou Yuan, listen.

716
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:29,120
Telling me honestly

717
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,340
is your only choice.

718
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,100
Are you going to tell me or not?

719
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:38,200
En.

720
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,620
Is something wrong with your throat?

721
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
En.

722
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,020
I like En.

723
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,860
I proposed to her.

724
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:49,230
En?

725
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,530
When did you two get together?

726
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:53,340
Did she buy you this necklace?

727
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,400
Can you stop gossiping?

728
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,660
What's wrong with gossiping?

729
00:29:56,940 --> 00:29:57,750
We've been together for quite some time.

730
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,860
We bought this when we went to do market research.

731
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:00,710
What?

732
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:02,830
When we went to do market research last time.

733
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,310
How can you just buy rings in the market?

734
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:06,780
You silly boy.

735
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,550
This is great.

736
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,610
Lou Yuan is such a fool.

737
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:13,320
Proposing is so important.

738
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:15,200
How can he just buy a plastic ring?

739
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:17,350
Lou Yuan is not a materialistic person.

740
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,380
Maybe he hasn't realized

741
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,860
how important a proposal ring is

742
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:20,840
to a girl.

743
00:30:21,060 --> 00:30:22,380
Auntie, what do you think of this?

744
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,860
This is 5.2 carats.

745
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:25,490
It should be able to make it up to En.

746
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:26,900
You have a good taste, Miss.

747
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,820
This is one of the products we are mainly promoting.

748
00:30:28,850 --> 00:30:31,060
The design means being together day and night.

749
00:30:31,060 --> 00:30:32,490
It represents the deepest love.

750
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,540
Their names can be engraved on the setting.

751
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:36,530
It's the most popular among newlyweds.

752
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:38,710
How much is this?

753
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,160
770,000 yuan.

754
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:42,510
770,000 yuan?

755
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,620
It's a bit expensive.

756
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:47,580
Auntie, they have a smaller one here.

757
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,540
This is 2 carats.

758
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:49,640
It should be cheaper.

759
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,760
No. I'm gonna buy this ring of 770,000 yuan.

760
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,570
I need to make it up to En.

761
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,060
The deepest love, right?

762
00:30:57,060 --> 00:30:57,460
Yes.

763
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,100
This is it.

764
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:01,220
Are there paired earrings and necklaces?

765
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,420
Yes. Please come with me.

766
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:03,020
Okay.

767
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,900
This is good.

768
00:31:04,930 --> 00:31:06,320
The deepest love.

769
00:31:22,230 --> 00:31:23,000
Dong Dong'en,

770
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,350
can you handle a man like Lou Yuan?

771
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,500
Stop!

772
00:31:31,780 --> 00:31:33,540
Sir, stop the car.

773
00:31:36,790 --> 00:31:38,040
After thinking about it,

774
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,290
I don't think this is okay.

775
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,760
What is not okay?

776
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,220
Lou.

777
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,150
Daughter,

778
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:54,240
we don't want anything from them.

779
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:56,680
But this is a proposal.

780
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,860
A proposal.

781
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:01,370
He just gave you a cheap ring

782
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,060
and that's it?

783
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:05,400
That's right.

784
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,290
This means he looks down upon us.

785
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,590
Didn't you say you don't want anything from him?

786
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,220
Yes.

787
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:13,100
Yes, we don't want anything.

788
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:15,930
But at least we can see his attitude from this.

789
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:17,380
His attitude.

790
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,780
He's not sincere.

791
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,460
-Yes.
-Do you know that?

792
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:20,660
I think this is good.

793
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,340
If he

794
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,520
puts a 5-carat diamond ring here,

795
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:25,260
I... I won't dare to accept it, right?

796
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,510
So silly.

797
00:32:27,530 --> 00:32:28,960
Well, you...

798
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,360
You just...

799
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,020
With this thing, you've decided to marry him

800
00:32:31,050 --> 00:32:32,650
just like that?

801
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:34,580
Dad, I know what to do.

802
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,420
What do you know?

803
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:37,610
You are a fool.

804
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,760
My parcels are here.

805
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,300
Come with me to get the parcels.

806
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:45,020
No.

807
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,860
I'm gonna preach at her at home.

808
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,100
There are too many. I can't carry them on my own.

809
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:47,860
I'll go with you, Mom.

810
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,570
Don't. I'll go.

811
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,420
Stay here.

812
00:32:51,420 --> 00:32:52,490
I'll teach you a lesson when I'm back.

813
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:07,390
Hello, Auntie Lou. What's up?

814
00:33:07,550 --> 00:33:08,520
En.

815
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,760
I think I've arrived at the place where you live.

816
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,540
Yes.

817
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:13,570
I see many flowers.

818
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:14,820
So beautiful.

819
00:33:16,110 --> 00:33:17,630
Which building do you live in?

820
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:24,660
One, two, three, four.

821
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:25,620
Auntie.

822
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,300
En.

823
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,860
Auntie, what brings you here?

824
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:29,740
Am I good?

825
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,420
-I found your place at one stroke.
-Yes.

826
00:33:32,020 --> 00:33:34,060
Well, what brings you here?

827
00:33:34,410 --> 00:33:36,700
It's such an important thing. Why didn't you tell me?

828
00:33:37,950 --> 00:33:40,680
It's not the deadline for Mr. Chen to submit the draft yet.

829
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,620
If you're in a hurry, I'll rush him for you.

830
00:33:42,650 --> 00:33:43,180
Don't worry.

831
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,760
It's not about this.

832
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:47,580
It's about you and Lou Yuan.

833
00:33:48,050 --> 00:33:50,370
Well, you look shy.

834
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,000
-You know?
-Come on.

835
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,560
Lou Yuan is a silly boy.

836
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,660
Today, I came here

837
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:58,300
to make it up to you.

838
00:33:58,940 --> 00:33:59,620
Auntie,

839
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:01,540
I can't accept this.

840
00:34:01,540 --> 00:34:02,540
You haven't seen it yet.

841
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,140
How do you know you can't accept it?

842
00:34:04,840 --> 00:34:06,880
Here, take a look.

843
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,429
What do you think?

844
00:34:09,940 --> 00:34:11,260
No, this is too expensive.

845
00:34:11,260 --> 00:34:12,060
I can't accept it.

846
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:12,580
Auntie.

847
00:34:12,580 --> 00:34:13,420
Not at all.

848
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,460
This is a big deal.

849
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,739
I have to give you a big one. Come on.

850
00:34:17,860 --> 00:34:20,190
I think the size is suitable. Look.

851
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:22,139
It's perfect.

852
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,060
What I bought is suitable, right?

853
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:25,340
This is a gift from me.

854
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,610
You must accept it.

855
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,380
Understand?

856
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,380
T-Thank you.

857
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:32,060
It suits your little hand perfectly.

858
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:33,380
En,

859
00:34:33,940 --> 00:34:35,070
this is...

860
00:34:35,090 --> 00:34:36,810
This is Ms. Lou Mudan.

861
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:37,480
She's Lou Yuan's mother.

862
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:38,739
They are my parents.

863
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:40,060
Hello. Hello.

864
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:41,460
Hello. Hello.

865
00:34:42,110 --> 00:34:43,460
-Mudan, right?
-Mr. Dong.

866
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:44,300
Mrs. Dong.

867
00:34:44,730 --> 00:34:46,610
I'm so lucky.

868
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,460
This is my first time here, and I met you.

869
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,730
I've always wanted to ask

870
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,980
how you managed to educate her so well.

871
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,230
She's considerate and ambitious.

872
00:34:55,650 --> 00:34:57,080
I really like her.

873
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,230
I'm flattered.

874
00:34:58,420 --> 00:34:59,100
En,

875
00:34:59,300 --> 00:35:00,960
why didn't you invite her upstairs?

876
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,660
Auntie, how about going upstairs?

877
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,620
Yes, it's time for dinner.

878
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,780
Stay and have dinner.

879
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:07,490
It's too troublesome to eat at home.

880
00:35:07,940 --> 00:35:08,820
Let's go out to eat,

881
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,060
and

882
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:11,700
we can discuss

883
00:35:11,700 --> 00:35:12,540
their thing.

884
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,790
The dishes have all been served.

885
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,370
Lou Yuan is busy with work.

886
00:35:20,390 --> 00:35:21,560
We don't need to wait for him.

887
00:35:21,590 --> 00:35:22,890
Let's eat.

888
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:24,500
We don't need to wait for him?

889
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:24,980
En,

890
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:26,780
I don't know what your parents like.

891
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:27,740
You take care of them.

892
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:28,570
Thank you, Auntie.

893
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,320
Don't stand on ceremony.

894
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:30,430
Right. Right.

895
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,550
Mr. Dong, Mrs. Dong,

896
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:33,450
En

897
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,460
is a very good girl, and she is ambitious.

898
00:35:35,540 --> 00:35:36,780
I always have faith in her.

899
00:35:37,620 --> 00:35:39,530
When I heard they are together,

900
00:35:40,340 --> 00:35:42,530
I thought Lou Yuan is really lucky to have her.

901
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,100
To be honest,

902
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,360
I feel a little guilty.

903
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:50,350
You are making progress in your career,

904
00:35:50,370 --> 00:35:52,650
but now your career development has been hindered by Lou Yuan.

905
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,560
Auntie, he... he hasn't.

906
00:35:54,670 --> 00:35:56,420
What a sweet girl.

907
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,160
Don't worry.

908
00:35:58,190 --> 00:35:59,690
I will treat you well.

909
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:02,120
If you want to live in my villa in the future,

910
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,990
just go. I'll let you live there.

911
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,840
It's okay if you don't like it.

912
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:07,120
Young people

913
00:36:07,250 --> 00:36:08,060
may not want

914
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:09,650
to live with old people.

915
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,180
You want to have your own life, right?

916
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,060
No problem.

917
00:36:12,470 --> 00:36:14,500
No matter which house she likes, I'll buy it for them.

918
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:16,290
It's too early.

919
00:36:16,570 --> 00:36:17,760
Not at all.

920
00:36:18,090 --> 00:36:20,210
Before the wedding and after the wedding,

921
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,980
from the engagement to the wedding banquet,

922
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,220
it'll all happen in the blink of an eye.

923
00:36:24,240 --> 00:36:26,470
We have to buy a house as soon as possible, right?

924
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:28,490
I've thought about the bride price.

925
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,550
1.28 million yuan. What do you think?

926
00:36:30,990 --> 00:36:31,880
-That's...
-That's...

927
00:36:32,040 --> 00:36:32,940
That's too much.

928
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,060
Too much. Too much.

929
00:36:34,060 --> 00:36:34,980
It's not much.

930
00:36:35,370 --> 00:36:36,340
It can't show

931
00:36:36,340 --> 00:36:37,540
the importance of En

932
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:39,720
in my heart at all. Right?

933
00:36:40,660 --> 00:36:41,610
Mrs. Dong,

934
00:36:41,770 --> 00:36:42,630
if there are any requirements and customs

935
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,280
in your hometown,

936
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:46,440
just tell me.

937
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:47,780
I'll make you satisfied.

938
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,860
The most important thing now

939
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,980
is the date.

940
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,340
We need to choose an auspicious date.

941
00:36:53,340 --> 00:36:54,260
It's a big deal.

942
00:36:54,740 --> 00:36:55,820
I've seen the calendar.

943
00:36:55,820 --> 00:36:56,540
This month,

944
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:58,340
-there are several days...
-No hurry. No...

945
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,340
Well, Lou Yuan is here.

946
00:37:00,340 --> 00:37:01,300
I'm going downstairs to take him here.

947
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,260
Okay, go.

948
00:37:02,730 --> 00:37:03,170
Go.

949
00:37:03,170 --> 00:37:05,020
I'll decide with your parents.

950
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,430
Go. Go.

951
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,290
What's going on up there?

952
00:37:20,710 --> 00:37:22,020
Auntie Lou suddenly came to propose a marriage.

953
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,620
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

954
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:25,260
Let me tell you.

955
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:27,420
Today, my mom suddenly asked me,

956
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,980
so I told her I proposed to you.

957
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:30,570
It's my fault.

958
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,670
My parents are scared.

959
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,710
I'm really sorry.

960
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,300
What should we do now?

961
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,140
She is talking about an engagement.

962
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,150
And she gave me such a big diamond ring.

963
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:41,540
This is too expensive.

964
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,750
I can't accept it.

965
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:44,380
I haven't thought that far yet.

966
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,380
What should we do now?

967
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:47,530
I also planned

968
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:49,320
to buy a ring for you.

969
00:37:51,620 --> 00:37:52,620
It's okay. Well.

970
00:37:52,940 --> 00:37:54,860
Listen to me after we go upstairs.

971
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:56,060
I'll keep my mom calm

972
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:57,810
so that your parents won't feel very awkward.

973
00:37:58,470 --> 00:38:01,510
I also think it's a good date. It's a deal then.

974
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,540
Mom. Uncle. Auntie.

975
00:38:04,180 --> 00:38:04,890
What is the deal?

976
00:38:05,370 --> 00:38:06,610
An engagement.

977
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:08,690
We've discussed it.

978
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:10,870
You should get engaged next week.

979
00:38:11,010 --> 00:38:11,540
Really?

980
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,450
You are busy with work. It's okay.

981
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,880
Leave everything to me.

982
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:15,620
I'll arrange it.

983
00:38:15,830 --> 00:38:17,790
It... It's too tiring.

984
00:38:17,980 --> 00:38:19,100
Not at all.

985
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:20,460
I'd love to.

986
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,120
It's not tiring at all.

987
00:38:22,920 --> 00:38:24,520
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

988
00:38:24,550 --> 00:38:25,060
From now on,

989
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,730
we are one.

990
00:38:26,910 --> 00:38:27,880
Don't stand on ceremony.

991
00:38:28,720 --> 00:38:29,570
Sit. Sit.

992
00:38:30,580 --> 00:38:32,780
Silly boy, make a toast.

993
00:38:49,670 --> 00:38:52,600
She will give a 1.28 million yuan red packet.

994
00:38:52,820 --> 00:38:55,470
And she will give En a house.

995
00:38:55,660 --> 00:38:57,180
How much do you think

996
00:38:57,200 --> 00:38:58,950
we should prepare for the dowry?

997
00:39:03,470 --> 00:39:04,110
Daughter,

998
00:39:04,900 --> 00:39:06,640
I have to criticize you first.

999
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:09,080
It's an important thing that the parents of the two families meet.

1000
00:39:09,110 --> 00:39:09,910
Why didn't you

1001
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,100
discuss it with us in advance?

1002
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:13,890
I was just like you. I was also scared.

1003
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,940
Although it was in a hurry,

1004
00:39:18,270 --> 00:39:19,910
after seeing Lou's mother,

1005
00:39:20,380 --> 00:39:22,010
I think she

1006
00:39:22,050 --> 00:39:23,460
likes you very much.

1007
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,270
It's a good thing.

1008
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:26,820
En,

1009
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:28,660
you should think carefully.

1010
00:39:28,910 --> 00:39:30,450
Marriage is not a joke.

1011
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,950
Are you ready?

1012
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,010
I...

1013
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,330
If you don't want to,

1014
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:40,200
there's still room for discussion.

1015
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,000
It's not that I don't want to.

1016
00:39:43,170 --> 00:39:45,290
I just didn't expect it to happen so fast.

1017
00:39:45,810 --> 00:39:48,190
If you are sure Lou is the one,

1018
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:50,350
it doesn't matter even if you get married early.

1019
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,890
Besides, you're not young anymore.

1020
00:39:57,960 --> 00:39:58,360
I...

1021
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,840
Son, look.

1022
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,200
Which kind does En like?

1023
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,690
Jade or gold?

1024
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,260
Or...

1025
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:11,570
How about this?

1026
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,950
Take all of these to her.

1027
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:16,020
Give them to her tomorrow.

1028
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,660
Mom. Mom. Mom.

1029
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,450
Calm down. Let's do it step by step.

1030
00:40:21,010 --> 00:40:22,620
Step by step?

1031
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:23,740
If you do it step by step,

1032
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:25,120
I don't know how long I have to wait.

1033
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:27,170
Mom, shouldn't we prepare

1034
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,500
before the parents of the two families meet?

1035
00:40:29,540 --> 00:40:30,930
You went there suddenly.

1036
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:32,520
En and I were not prepared at all.

1037
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:34,100
We young people

1038
00:40:34,100 --> 00:40:36,060
have our own plans, right?

1039
00:40:36,180 --> 00:40:38,300
You are slow. You are not worried at all.

1040
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,520
All parents in the world

1041
00:40:40,540 --> 00:40:42,460
want their children to get married early.

1042
00:40:42,500 --> 00:40:42,900
Yes.

1043
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,340
While we are still young,

1044
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,100
we can

1045
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,860
help take care of your baby, right?

1046
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:47,940
In my opinion,

1047
00:40:48,340 --> 00:40:49,340
you should

1048
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:51,860
have a wedding as soon as possible.

1049
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:54,380
Mom, you told me before

1050
00:40:54,540 --> 00:40:55,940
a girl's career is also important, right?

1051
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:58,950
I was talking about other girls,

1052
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,370
not my daughter-in-law.

1053
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:01,870
You have two sets of rules.

1054
00:41:02,150 --> 00:41:03,540
Can I treat other girls

1055
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,660
as nicely as I treat my daughter-in-law?

1056
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:06,860
So you do have two sets of rules.

1057
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:08,990
So what?

1058
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,940
What's wrong with you?

1059
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:12,860
Don't you want to marry her?

1060
00:41:12,860 --> 00:41:13,340
I...

1061
00:41:18,930 --> 00:41:20,230
Isn't that enough?

1062
00:41:20,930 --> 00:41:22,140
Take a look.

1063
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:23,730
I don't know which one she likes.

1064
00:41:23,910 --> 00:41:25,740
This Van Cleef & Arpels one is good, right?

1065
00:41:26,740 --> 00:41:27,860
It has to be paired.

1066
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:28,610
Good.

1067
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:32,840
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
