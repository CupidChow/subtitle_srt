00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:05,500
Bye.

191
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:11,160
En, how is it going with packing the things?

192
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,490
It's all done.

193
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,220
You need to check things like the brakes

194
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:15,810
and the engines again.

195
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,020
I've checked everything.

196
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,460
There won't be any problem again.

197
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:19,500
It's all packed.

198
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,340
Get into the car and let's go.

199
00:09:21,660 --> 00:09:22,800
-On the way, you... -En.

200
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,470
Take my car.

201
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:25,930
No.

202
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:27,340
The director and the others are all here.

203
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,820
How can I take your car?

204
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,560
We're client and supplier.

205
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:32,290
Isn't it normal for us to chat on the way?

206
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,270
Let's talk about work.

207
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,200
Besides, my waist hasn't recovered yet.

208
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,160
-They saw us. -Come on.

209
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:37,100
It's okay.

210
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,320
Help me massage my waist on the way.

211
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,980
Hurry up. Go. Get into the car.

212
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,460
Come on.

213
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,150
Get into the car.

[Rose Room] [Cherry Blossom Avenue]

215
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:54,170
Mr. Su, look.

216
00:09:57,470 --> 00:09:59,750
Although their schedule was delayed,

217
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:01,430
they still finished the shooting.

218
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:02,900
They all went back to the company today.

219
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:05,580
Hasn't Lulu terminated the contract with them?

220
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:07,550
How come they could still finish the shooting on time?

221
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,450
Yes, she has terminated the contract.

222
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:11,930
But the local police arrived at the scene

223
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:14,120
much faster than we had thought.

224
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:16,810
Besides, at the scene, Dong Dong'en even suggested that

225
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:19,890
Lou Mudan should participate in the shooting in place of Lulu.

226
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,990
Lou Yuan agreed without even thinking.

227
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:23,290
Dong Dong'en?

228
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,920
I thought Lou Yuan was so great.

229
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:30,180
He's nothing more than this.

230
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,110
Mr. Su,

231
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:34,260
what do you mean?

232
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,310
Isn't it obvious?

233
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,720
Lou Yuan likes Dong Dong'en,

234
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,020
so he listens to whatever Dong Dong'en says.

235
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:43,280
A man who is affected by a beauty

236
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:45,780
won't be a great man in the end.

237
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,360
This is a beauty?

What's the matter?

242
00:11:16,090 --> 00:11:16,860
Have you had lunch?

243
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:20,250
No, I haven't. I'm busy now.

244
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,000
Are you feeling better?

245
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:23,950
Much better.

246
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,240
I haven't decided what to eat, either.

247
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,880
I don't think any of them are as delicious as the food made by you.

248
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,110
Maybe your stomach

249
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:34,650
hasn't fully recovered.

250
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:36,240
If you want to eat the food made by me,

251
00:11:36,270 --> 00:11:38,080
I'll make some for you later and send it to you.

252
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:39,300
Sure.

253
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:42,120
Then send it to me tonight.

254
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:42,900
Tonight?

255
00:11:43,460 --> 00:11:45,790
You'll bring me food and I'll give you a gift,

256
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:48,420
plus some good wine from my private collection for you to choose from.

257
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,210
What do you think?

00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:52,200
Good boy, this deal should be worth it, huh?

259

Even though Cao Ya doesn't like me,

260
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,160
she won't like you, either.

261
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,600
She is just muddled for the time being.

262
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,040
So, don't expect that

263
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:00,300
she would change anything for you.

Why can't I be here?

Don't worry.

I can go upstairs alone.

Even though you can do it alone,

321

go back first.

No.

363
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:30,560
I felt I was breathing more heavily when I was going upstairs just now.

364
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:31,810
Let me get you some water.

365
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:32,360
No need.

366
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,370
Water is useless to me.

367
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,030
Just spend more time with me.

368
00:16:46,280 --> 00:16:47,170
I'll lie down for a while.

369
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,850
I think my blood pressure is a bit high.

370
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,890
Maybe my diastolic pressure is a bit high.

371
00:16:54,330 --> 00:16:54,930
I'm fine.

372
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,060
Two days ago,

373
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,300
I went to see the doctor in the hospital.

374
00:16:58,740 --> 00:16:59,460
The doctor told me that

375
00:16:59,460 --> 00:17:00,980
I didn't take enough rest.

376
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,710
I also sleep late.

377
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,060
My sleep quality is bad, too.

378
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:07,859
Sometimes, I feel that my blood pressure is a little high.

379
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,099
I'll feel better if I can see you more.

380
00:17:16,390 --> 00:17:17,640
It's getting late.

381
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,579
How about I just stay here instead of going back painstakingly?

382
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,180
I'll sleep here.

383
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:23,180
Yes.

384
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,210
You'll sleep here?

385
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:27,730
The sofa is nice.

386
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:29,470
I'm fine.

387
00:17:29,580 --> 00:17:30,470
Go on with your work.

388
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,020
I can lean on the sofa here for a while, and I'll be fine.

389
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,060
Go. Don't worry about me.

390
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:35,870
I don't feel cold.

391
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,490
I don't need to change into pajamas, either.

392
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:38,420
It's good.

393
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:43,400
Just go.

394
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,700
♫You're like a beam of light♫

395
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,240

No, this will scare En.

401
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:07,940
How about...

402
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:08,580
How about...

403
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:11,680
we wait a little longer?

404
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:14,280
I don't think

405
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:17,540
you are ready.

406
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:18,790
Right.

407
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:19,750
No. I...

408
00:19:19,790 --> 00:19:20,790
I was a little impatient.

409
00:19:21,690 --> 00:19:23,170
I can't be too impaitent. Right.

410
00:19:23,690 --> 00:19:24,820
I can't be too impaitent.

411
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:27,150
No hurry.

412
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:32,430
Just wait a little longer.

413
00:19:33,620 --> 00:19:34,590
I'll go back first.

414
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:42,400
I know you're not ready.

415
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,190
Good night.

416
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:04,620
What?

417
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:06,710
What?

418
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:09,200
You went to her home and you just left like that?

419
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,820
I can't be too impatient in the relationship.

420
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,080
Being too impatient will scare her easily.

421
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,980
If that's what you think,

422
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:18,410
you're right.

423
00:20:20,770 --> 00:20:21,700
Actually,

424
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:24,510
we can't let our relationship develop too fast.

425
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,360
After all, not all girls

426
00:20:27,740 --> 00:20:30,250
are as cool as Cao Ya in a romantic relationship.

427
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,190
If you rush to do this,

428
00:20:32,330 --> 00:20:33,770
you'll scare her indeed.

429
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,950
I'm not in a hurry anyway.

430
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,570
I can wait patiently.

431
00:20:37,970 --> 00:20:40,000
I can wait until she fully accepts me.

432
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,900
Fine.

433
00:20:45,610 --> 00:20:48,070
Just enjoy the sweetness of love.

434
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,900
I'll go do some aerobic exercise.

435
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:50,460
I'm tired.

436
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,460
You'll do the aerobic exercise?

437
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:55,040
What?

438
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,210
You really let him go?

439
00:20:57,430 --> 00:20:58,190
What else could I do?

440
00:20:58,330 --> 00:20:59,690
Come on, girl.

441
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,360
The arrow was already on the string.

442
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,660
You should have shot it.

443
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:04,970
Well,

444
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,630
you just let him go without doing anything?

445
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:11,220
I was happy when he said that he would

446
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:12,220
escort me upstairs.

447
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,020
I wanted to say yes.

448
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,060
But as a girl,

449
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,320
shouldn't I be reserved?

450
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:17,610
But he suddenly said that he was not feeling well.

451
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:18,590
So I said,

452
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,730
come upstairs to take a rest.

453
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:21,920
Right.

454
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,090
You asked him to come upstairs to take a rest.

455
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:27,050
Then you two should kiss and hug each other.

456
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,550
Wouldn't it be natural for us to do that since everything was ready?

457
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,980
We already hugged and kissed each other.

458
00:21:32,010 --> 00:21:32,460
You know what?

459
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:33,460
I was about to say that

460
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,750
you should stay tonight.

461
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:37,870
But do you know what he said?

462
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,370
I know you're not ready.

463
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:41,200
Good night.

464
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:43,410
Was he crazy?

465
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,200
Well,

466
00:21:44,290 --> 00:21:46,570
so you just let him go without doing anything?

467
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:47,160
What else could I do?

468
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,730
Should I hold his leg and say

469
00:21:48,770 --> 00:21:50,470
please stay

470
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,770
and let's spend a warm night together?

471
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,460
Alright, alright, alright.

472
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,000
Does he

473
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:09,910
have a problem?

474
00:22:14,310 --> 00:22:15,310
From now on,

475
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:17,530
you can live happily in whatever you like.

476
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,110
Anyway,

477
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:20,590
I won't go to your home anymore.

478
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,620
From now on,

479
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:23,230
we're just friends.

480
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,420
Cao Ya, what a coincidence.

481
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,770
I didn't expect to have the chance to see you again.

482
00:23:00,410 --> 00:23:01,650
It seems

483
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,400
we are destined to meet each other.

484
00:23:08,740 --> 00:23:09,580
It's you.

485
00:23:09,910 --> 00:23:11,260
What would you like to drink? My treat.

486
00:23:12,710 --> 00:23:13,220
I have a drink.

487
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:13,860
Thank you.

488

What smells so good?

489
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:20,840
It's exactly the same as last time.

490
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:24,460
Ya, what is the brand of the perfume you're wearing?

491
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:26,370
It's okay for you to flirt with

a young girl with these old tricks,

493
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,490

495
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,690
It's okay.

Are you willing to do that?

509
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,460
Ya, stop teasing me. Okay?

Let me tell you.

so beautifully.

520
00:25:23,430 --> 00:25:24,990
A company has used this

521
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,490
to pay the fees for us.

522
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,640
Ke thought it would be a waste

523
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,070
if we threw it away,

524
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:30,620

Beisides, the pettern in the middle

526
00:25:32,170 --> 00:25:33,540
of this T-shirt was a "Three".

527
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,420
Then after this part was sewn together, it became a "Two".

No matter how important the matter is, I have to delay it.

536

Why is he so good at flirting?

561
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:13,800
Mr. Ke,

562
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,090
we've had a great time cooperating with each other.

563
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,980
Your Ba'er Company also

564
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:19,380
showed great professionalism

565
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,430
and sincerity.

566
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:21,890
On behalf of our company,

567
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:24,120
I'd like to thank all the staff of Ba'er.

568
00:27:24,370 --> 00:27:25,160
Thanks for your hard work.

569
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,980
We should thank the chairwoman

570
00:27:30,980 --> 00:27:32,020
and Mr. Lou

571
00:27:32,020 --> 00:27:33,650
for giving us an opportunity like this.

572
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:36,120
En has been here for so long.

573
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:38,160
Has she caused you any trouble?

574
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:38,950
No.

575
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:40,250
Dong Dong'en is

576
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:42,150
bold but cautious, and she works very efficiently.

577
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:43,590
She's also smart and independent.

578
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,370
Besides, throughout the whole process of our cooperation,

579
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,990
both her professional quality and potential

580
00:27:55,570 --> 00:27:56,740
were quite good.

581
00:27:58,960 --> 00:27:59,980
I'm flattered, Mr. Lou.

582
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:01,740
That's because Mr. Lou is such a good leader.

583
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,010
In the coming days,

584
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:04,360
I will cooperate with all departments to

585
00:28:04,390 --> 00:28:05,870
work on the finishing touches of the project.

586
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,930
I'd like to thank all the leaders here

587
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:10,280
for your care and support to our Ba'er Company.

588
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:11,250
We're grateful.

589
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:12,470
-Well said. -Thank you for your support.

590
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,990
Good!

591
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:15,450
Alright.

592
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,560
You've finished saying these words to show courtesy.

593
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,870
That's all for today's meeting.

594
00:28:20,050 --> 00:28:20,450
Okay.

595
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,060
Dismiss.

596
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:22,600
Bye, Ma'am.

597
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,360
-Thank you. -We should thank you.

598
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:27,420
Please.

599
00:28:27,470 --> 00:28:28,460
Lady first.

600
00:28:29,110 --> 00:28:30,250
-You brat. Thanks for your hard work, too.

601
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,480
Let's go celebrate it.

602
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,350
[Conference Room]

603
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:39,780
Come on.

604
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,040
How are my shoes?

605
00:28:45,830 --> 00:28:46,660
How childish.

606
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,460
You scared me.

607
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,660
Our relationship was almost discovered just now.

608
00:28:50,790 --> 00:28:51,450
What are you afraid of?

609
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,660
Just let them discover it.

610
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,680
Besides, you really did a good job.

611
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:55,770
So what if I praised you?

612
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,610
But this is...

613
00:28:56,630 --> 00:28:57,150
You should do it.

614
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,310
But we're in the company.

615
00:28:58,410 --> 00:28:59,430
So what?

616
00:29:00,410 --> 00:29:01,210
Besides,

617
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:03,070
I'm the one who pays them salaries.

618
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:04,310
Even if they find out about it,

619
00:29:04,340 --> 00:29:05,820
they'll just discuss it secretly behind my back.

620
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,150
Are they really dating secretly?

621
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:09,750
How they wish they could engrave

622
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,650
each other's names on their foreheads.

623
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:13,710
This is probably a kind of fun.

624
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,480
Look. Look.

625
00:29:17,830 --> 00:29:19,200
Matching clothes for couples.

626
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,430
This is how they show their affection.

627
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:20,850
I...

628
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:22,380
Are you envious?

629
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,340
If you want it,

630
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,740
we can also wear matching shoes for couples.

631
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:29,290
It's not appropriate as we're just friends, right?

632
00:29:32,060 --> 00:29:33,020
What did you say?

633
00:29:33,040 --> 00:29:35,510
But I'm not ready yet.

634
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:37,280
Give me more time.

635
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,440
You're not ready yet?

636
00:29:39,750 --> 00:29:40,260
Okay.

637
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:42,420
I'll wait for you for some more time.

638
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,730
What a good boy.

639
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:47,010
Okay. I'll go now.

640
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:47,990
Go.

641
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:48,590
Bye.

642
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:49,790
I'll go out, too.

643
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:50,940
You can go out first.

644
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:05,130
Ke.

645
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:07,420
We agreed to eat something good after the meeting.

646
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,750
We're just eating this?

647
00:30:08,870 --> 00:30:10,940
We should learn to be prepared for danger in times of peace.

648
00:30:11,170 --> 00:30:12,740
We should keep a low profile.

649
00:30:12,900 --> 00:30:13,800
I'm here!

650
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:16,460
Guys, I've brought you delicious food.

651
00:30:17,020 --> 00:30:18,190
I asked the organizer.

652
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:19,100
All the food could be packed.

653
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,540
Besides, no one has touched them.

654
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,920
Great.

655
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,700
Stop.

656
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,460
This is specially packed for you.

657
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:27,480
Thank you.

658
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,120
What's wrong?

659
00:30:30,530 --> 00:30:32,210
Can't a couple show their affection?

660
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:32,970
That's right.

661
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:34,370
By the way, Hai,

662
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,140
the director who shot our advertisement last time

663
00:30:36,160 --> 00:30:37,950
is preparing for a TV drama.

664
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,010
He's selecting actors now.

665
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:40,480
Do you want to give it a try?

666
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,000
Sure.

667
00:30:42,030 --> 00:30:43,150
I'll give it a try.

668
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:45,110
I've been an unknown model for so many years.

669
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,420
I finally see the chance.

670
00:30:46,550 --> 00:30:48,050
My best friend is very reliable indeed.

671
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,460
I love you.

672
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:50,690
I love you.

673
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,220
Just eat.

674
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,580
I'm not eating.

675
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,860
I have something to do later.

676
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:59,090
A private affair?

677
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:01,640
No wonder you dressed up so nicely.

678
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:07,600
[Zhulian Roasted Pork]

679
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,300
It looks delicious.

680
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:05,790
This is delicious, too.

681
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:06,380
Have you eaten this before?

682
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,410
Yes.

683
00:31:08,270 --> 00:31:09,480
This is very delicious.

684
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:10,660
It needs to be very crispy after being roasted.

685
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:11,880
-It's very delicious. -Do you have a table for three?

686
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,420
My dear Zhuang is so smart.

687
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,320
How long will we have to wait?

688
00:31:14,350 --> 00:31:15,300
Ask the waiter to come over.

689
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:17,250
If it's fast, it'll take you only ten minutes.

690
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,700
Ten minutes?

691
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:19,620
Why are Secretary Huang and the others here?

692
00:31:19,620 --> 00:31:20,860
Later, can you let us go in first?

693
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,700
-Oh, no. -I don't want to line up.

694
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,500
Will they discover us?

695
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,500
Please wait a moment.

696
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,520
Just let them discover us. What are you afraid of?

697
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,070
At worst, we can just admit it initiatively.

698
00:31:27,110 --> 00:31:28,390
Lower your head!

699
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:29,260
No, no.

700
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,100
Now we are

701
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,540
just client and supplier.

702
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:34,820
-Get a number for me. -No. A36.

703
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,380
It's our turn.

704
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:36,460
Please have your meal.

705
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:38,900
-No. A36. -Put it down. I don't want it now.

706
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,780
Please have your meal.

707
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:40,680
Let's go.

708
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,620
No.

709
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,020
No. A36, you can have your meal now.

710
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:46,300
No. A36.

711
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,380
No. A36 is here.

712
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,060
Let's sit here.

713
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:50,870
Hurry up.

714
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:52,420
No. A36.

715
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:59,730
How can I be defeated by Cao Ya?

716
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,290
You're envious?

717
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,530
If you want it, we can also wear matching shoes for couples.

718
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:15,560
Calm down.

719
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:23,640
I'm going to wash up and go to bed.

720
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,970
You should go inside and rest early, too.

721
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:25,780
Okay.

722
00:32:30,870 --> 00:32:33,080
Well, you guys are so unreliable.

723
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,510
You always stood me up and changed your mind right before the appointment.

724
00:32:35,540 --> 00:32:35,940
You...

725
00:32:37,140 --> 00:32:38,090
If you keep doing this,

726
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,660
I'll really get angry.

727
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:40,320
I'll get angry.

728
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:14,840
Come on.

729
00:33:19,110 --> 00:33:20,700
Why is it so hard

730
00:33:20,700 --> 00:33:21,940
to have a meal outside?

731
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:25,270
We have to look at the bright side.

732
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,390
It's true that we can't eat outside.

733
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,130
But think about it.

734
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,940
You can eat the food made by Chef Dong after we come back,

735
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:34,690
don't you feel happier?

736
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:36,400
In that case,

737
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,200
I have to help Chef Dong

738
00:33:38,330 --> 00:33:39,810
in case you should blow up the whole kitchen.

739
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,170
You don't trust me?

740
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,770
Of course I trust you. Go get changed.

741
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:49,750
Have you finished washing them?

742
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,610
-Give them to me. -I'll give you two first.

743
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:53,300
Here you are.

744
00:34:06,490 --> 00:34:08,090
Let me teach you. Cut it like this.

745
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:13,389
Is this better to cut it like this?

746
00:34:21,750 --> 00:34:23,080
Be careful not to scald yourself.

747
00:34:23,110 --> 00:34:24,150
Come on. Let me do it.

748
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,520
You must be hungry.

749
00:34:26,850 --> 00:34:27,489
Yes.

750
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,190
Give me some seasoning.

751
00:34:29,820 --> 00:34:30,350
Salt.

752
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:31,840
Just half a spoon.

753
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:33,010
-Okay. -Add it to the food.

754
00:34:34,409 --> 00:34:34,940
Okay.

755
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:46,840
Before cooking, you said you were Chef Dong.

756
00:34:47,260 --> 00:34:48,730
Which dish was made by Chef Dong?

757
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:52,060
This tomato salad was made by me.

758
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:55,510
All these vegetables were washed by me.

759
00:34:55,540 --> 00:34:57,870
Besides, the rice was cooked by me.

760
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:00,240
Thanks for your hard work, Chef Dong.

761
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,910
No, Chef Lou worked the hardest.

762
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:04,750
Since Chef Lou worked so hard,

763
00:35:04,770 --> 00:35:06,230
should you give him a reward?

764
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:07,290
Of course.

765
00:35:13,580 --> 00:35:14,500
The sincerity isn't enough.

766
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:34,140
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast now♫

767
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:40,390
♫Wait, I'm afraid to fall alone♫

♫Stay by my side as I'm missing you♫

♫Wait, a deeper understanding♫

772
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,650
You're playing with fire.

773
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:08,870
♫Wait, memories overlapped♫

774
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:13,410

♫Little by little♫

779
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:52,230
The food is getting cold.

780
00:36:53,770 --> 00:36:55,920
Let's eat first.

781
00:37:14,290 --> 00:37:14,900
Be good.

782
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,060
He could even hold it back under that situation?

783
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:33,260
Am I not charming enough?

784
00:37:34,450 --> 00:37:36,680
It looks like we need to drink to liven things up.

785
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,280
Lou Yuan, you must hold it back.

786
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:41,500
I can't scare En.

787
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,170
I can't drink anymore.

788
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:45,980
Otherwise, it'll be hard to control myself.

789
00:37:47,580 --> 00:37:49,010
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

790
00:37:50,070 --> 00:37:53,090
Chef Lou has improved the quality of my meal.

791
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:54,940
Come on. Cheers.

792
00:37:55,270 --> 00:37:56,360
I'll drink it up first.

793
00:37:59,830 --> 00:38:01,670
En, your capacity for wine is not big.

794
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:02,940
You even drank so many glasses of wine just now.

795
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:09,070
Okay.

796
00:38:12,930 --> 00:38:13,980
I've drunk it up.

797
00:38:14,530 --> 00:38:15,880
You just drank such a small amount of wine?

798
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:18,690
Then I'll drink it up.

799
00:38:22,510 --> 00:38:23,460
Refill your glass.

800
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:27,740
This time, we finally

801
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,460
had our own advertising style.

802
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:31,850
In this way, our products can stand out among the same types

803
00:38:31,870 --> 00:38:32,640
of competitive products.

804
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:33,310
That's right.

805
00:38:33,340 --> 00:38:33,900
Come on.

806
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:35,310
Cheers.

807
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:36,760
Okay.

808
00:38:39,370 --> 00:38:40,850
Actually, I have an idea.

809
00:38:41,620 --> 00:38:43,760
Let's open a dining saloon for buffets.

810
00:38:43,870 --> 00:38:45,150
We can open them one after another

811
00:38:45,180 --> 00:38:46,420
until we have chain restaurants all over the country.

812
00:38:46,630 --> 00:38:49,280
Then we can open them all over the world gradually

813
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:50,740
so that the whole world

814
00:38:50,740 --> 00:38:52,580
can feel the taste of China

815
00:38:52,620 --> 00:38:55,340
and feel the charm of our Peony's sauces.

816
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:01,290
Of course,

817
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,480
this is just a small idea of mine.

818
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:08,810
This is a dream.

819
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,300
People

820
00:39:11,300 --> 00:39:13,100
must have dreams.

821
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:14,420
Besides, I believe that

822
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,900
your dream will come true.

823
00:39:17,410 --> 00:39:19,970
Come on. Let's drink for your dream.

824
00:39:20,310 --> 00:39:20,990
Cheers!

825
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:26,810
There's no wine.

826
00:39:26,830 --> 00:39:27,620
Let's stop drinking.

827
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:30,390
There's no wine?

828
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:40,180
Are you drunk?

829
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:47,610
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast now♫

830
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:44,250
I...

831
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,180
I want a hug.

832
00:39:48,020 --> 00:39:53,770
♫Wait, I'm afraid to fall alone♫

833
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:49,720
Let me hug you.

834
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:51,860
Give me a hug.

835
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:52,990

836
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:58,050
♫Slow down, let me feel♫

♫Your eyes and sight♫

840
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:00,580

841
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,210

Okay.

845
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:07,580
I won't move.

846
00:40:08,020 --> 00:40:09,700
