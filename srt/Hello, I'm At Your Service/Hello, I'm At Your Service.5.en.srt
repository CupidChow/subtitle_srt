00:14:13,110 --> 00:14:14,790
I wonder if you know something about collecting treasures.

373
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:17,570
[Lady]

374
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:15,800
Look.

375
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:16,870
My friend specially

376
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:19,530
brought this sugar-heart agate from Alxa.

377
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,790
This is the most precious material of the earth's surface.

378
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,760
It's forbidden to get water on it.

379
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:23,770
[Lady] [Gentleman]

380
00:14:23,770 --> 00:14:26,040
[Lady]

381
00:14:24,550 --> 00:14:24,950
Okay.

382
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:25,960
Awesome.

383
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,290
You like movies too?

384
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,920
[Gentleman]

385
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,030
I like Marvel's movies.

386
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:32,980
Hello, sir.

387
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,380
Sir.

388
00:14:35,460 --> 00:14:37,860
My name is Lin Na. What's your name?

389
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:38,820
My surname is Lou.

390
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,810
Mr. Lou.

391
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:45,270
Mr. Lou.

392
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,400
You are so handsome.

393
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:49,600
What do you do?

394
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:50,590
I'm just an ordinary clerk.

395
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:53,740
Miss,

396
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:57,020
[Gentleman] [Lady]

397
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:54,950
if you want to buy crystal bracelets,

398
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,750
let's add each other on WeChat later.

399
00:14:57,020 --> 00:15:00,490
[Lady]

400
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:57,730
Okay.

401
00:14:58,020 --> 00:14:59,320
Okay, sir.

402
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,000
Scumbag.

403
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,000
Hello, beauty.

404
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,910
Let me introduce myself first.

405
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:15,830
I'm an employee of an Internet company in China and I work on special equipment.

406
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,190
I'm busy with work every day.

407
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,040
But my income is pretty high.

408
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,350
I've bought a house. I paid all the money at a time.

409
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:24,540
You just need to pay for the decoration and buy a car.

410
00:15:24,910 --> 00:15:26,030
My request is that

411
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:27,990
we should have a child within two years after we get married.

412
00:15:28,010 --> 00:15:29,510
It's better to have two children.

413
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:32,220
You can be a housewife.

414
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:34,600
My parents may come to live with us.

415
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:36,860
Just take care of the children and the elderly.

416
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:39,130
You don't need to worry

417
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:39,890
about the economic status.

418
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,900
As Buddha said, the 500 times of glancing back in the previous life

419
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:44,370
[Lady]

420
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,380
are exchanged for an encounter in this life.

421
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,870
My existence is for meeting you.

422
00:15:44,370 --> 00:15:48,250
[Lady] [Gentleman]

423
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,470
My phone number is

424
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:48,390
18110119017.

425
00:15:48,550 --> 00:15:49,670
Call me. Call me.

426
00:15:49,790 --> 00:15:50,630
Remember to call me.

427
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:51,990
I'm leaving.

428
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:53,790
I'm leaving.

429
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:54,790
Just go.

430
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:56,030
I'm really leaving.

431
00:16:00,280 --> 00:16:01,730
Why are you here?

432
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,980
I'm here to act as a shill

433
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:08,440
and support Hai in the event.

434
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,910
Mr. Lou, are you here for a blind date?

435
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:13,140
What blind date?

436
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:14,260
I was just passing by.

437
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:15,630
Your friend dragged me in.

438
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:17,630
I'm sorry.

439
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,310
I'll go talk to her.

440
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:20,950
It's okay.

441
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:22,840
You always help us.

442
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,630
As Party A,

443
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:25,310
I can help Party B once in a while.

444
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,140
I don't believe you.

445
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:32,050
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

446
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,440
Not at all.

447
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:34,380
Let's talk for ten minutes

448
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:35,540
and fulfill the requirement.

449
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,310
Okay.

450
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,400
This is my first time to know that

451
00:16:43,950 --> 00:16:46,390
there are special shills in the matchmaking industry.

452
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,920
Don't let others hear it.

453
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:52,770
It's not good.

454
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:55,870
Hello, Miss Chen.

455
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,200
I wonder whether you've learnt about olive cores before.

456
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,470
There are such styles as Southern Crafts, Northern Crafts

457
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,569
and Hai Style.

458
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,670
They are all different.

459
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,099
Each style has its own masters.

460
00:17:08,270 --> 00:17:10,270
Look. For this bracelet of mine...

461
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:15,109
Beauty, my conditions are good enough.

462
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:17,369
If you keep being picky,

463
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,390
you'll only become an old single lady in the end.

464
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:22,510
It'll be too late to have a child by that time.

465
00:17:22,530 --> 00:17:23,609
Well, do you think that a woman gets married

466
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,920
just for giving birth to children for you

467
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,140
and taking care of your parents?

468
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:28,830
After she resigns, she'll have to be a housewife.

469
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,340
She'll need to ask you for money to buy food and clothes,

470
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,480
and act according to your disposition.

471
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,850
If she's no longer beautiful because of the heavy housework, you'll dislike her, right?

472
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:37,330
If you divorce her, the house will still be your prenuptial property.

473
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,590
The decoration and the car will have been

474
00:17:38,630 --> 00:17:40,310
consumed for a few years, and she will have to pay you half of the depreciation cost.

475
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:41,140
Why would she do that?

476
00:17:41,890 --> 00:17:42,860
Just for

477
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,350
a self-righteous husband like you?

478
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:45,150
You...

479
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:45,870
Stop saying "you".

480
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,460
Let me tell you.

481
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,300
I earn a 7-figure annual salary.

482
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,850
The five-star hotel is my home.

483
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:53,150
I've had countless boyfriends before.

484
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,740
But the man for whom I'm willing to give birth to a child

485
00:17:54,950 --> 00:17:56,330
is not born yet.

486
00:17:58,870 --> 00:18:00,260
Take your time to find a husband.

487
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:02,900
Awesome.

488
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:09,830
Hello, Miss.

489
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,790
May I know your surname?

490
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:11,430
I'm busy.

491
00:18:12,780 --> 00:18:14,400
The online platform is almost ready.

492
00:18:14,590 --> 00:18:16,470
How's your special effects advertisement going?

493
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,660
It's going very well.

494
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,890
Has the procedure of the payment contract been finished?

495
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,350
Mr. Lou, let me tell you.

496
00:18:22,350 --> 00:18:25,790
Today has been the best day ever since I became Party B.

497
00:18:25,790 --> 00:18:27,970
The procedure was almost finished.

498
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:32,040
It's all because of your good management.

499
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,350
You are the first customer service clerk who meets

500
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,520
no barrier in the company.

501
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:37,520
That's all because of you.

502
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,620
All the people in our company

503
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,840
think with one mind

504
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,580
and work hard for the same goal.

505
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,480
They're all doing this for the better development of the project.

506
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:46,240
That's why they all provided assistance to me all the way.

507
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,100
And

508
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,690
I have a feeling.

509
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:49,670
I think...

510
00:18:49,770 --> 00:18:50,930
It's not that I think.

511
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:52,190
I'm sure

512
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,560
under your leadership, the Peony Corporation

513
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,640
will surpass the Sanjiao Group anytime.

514
00:18:58,310 --> 00:18:58,880
Okay.

515
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:01,180
I'm counting on you to surpass the Sanjiao Group.

516
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:04,230
Ladies and gentlemen,

["Meet Your True Love" Dating Club]

518

time flies.

519
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,630
I guess you've known each other, right?

520
00:19:08,830 --> 00:19:11,790
After this section of Pursuit,

521
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,830
those who hold hands successfully

522
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,990
will enter the last section.

523

Those who are brought together by fate will make meaningful hand moulds together.

524
00:19:19,910 --> 00:19:20,870
Hand moulds, right?

525

Yes.

No. 27 guest.

00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:35,580
Let's welcome this female guest

558
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,460
to go on the stage and make the meaningful

559
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,390
hand moulds with the male guest.

560
00:20:39,390 --> 00:20:40,660
Come on. This way, please.

561
00:20:41,310 --> 00:20:42,040
Are you willing to do this?

562
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:43,300
Yes, yes.

563
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:45,070
Let's welcome them with applause

564
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:47,340
for making hand moulds together.

565
00:20:48,540 --> 00:20:49,460
-Good! -Good! -Good!

566
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:50,450
Please.

567
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:57,320
Happy cooperation.

568
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,210
Happy cooperation.

569
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:01,490
I wish that you two could cooperate with each other happily

570
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,970
on the journey of love.

571
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:05,380
-Good! -Good! -Good!

572
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:13,430
Young man.

573
00:21:13,450 --> 00:21:16,350
Look. The couple on the stage has succeeded in holding hands.

574
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:18,920
Okay.

575
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:21,190
You haven't found a suitable one yet, have you?

576
00:21:21,310 --> 00:21:23,940
I can introduce someone to you.

577
00:21:24,790 --> 00:21:25,420
Well...

578
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,810
When I was a child, my mom already told me that

579
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,340
I should rely on myself to get a girlfriend

580
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:29,670
step by step.

581
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:30,430
Ma'am,

582
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:31,970
I wish you good health and good luck.

583
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Well, may you have many children and grandchildren.

584
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:34,190
Bye.

585
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,070
Young man, don't run.

586
00:21:35,070 --> 00:21:35,840
Let's chat for some more time.

587
00:21:39,050 --> 00:21:40,970
Thank you for saving my life. I mean it.

588
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,400
Thank you so much for today.

589
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:44,690
I think that old lady likes you very much.

590
00:21:44,890 --> 00:21:47,760
Don't blame me for blocking your luck for love.

591
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:48,590
You regret it?

592
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,780
No.

593
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,690
I respect her.

594
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,430
I'm very respectful to her, you know?

595
00:21:53,550 --> 00:21:53,870
Well...

596
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,540
That old lady was very sincere.

597
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,680
-Really. -For this kind of sincerity, I...

598
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,540
How was it? Have you found someone you like?

599
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,420
What do you think?

600
00:22:00,990 --> 00:22:01,920
No one likes me.

601
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:02,920
Someone likes him.

602
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,250
Of course.

603
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,310
This is my charm.

604
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:08,610
I'm just so popular.

605
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:10,830
I want to find another place to get a drink. Do you want to go?

606
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:11,710
Let's go together.

607
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:12,710
You two can go first.

608
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:13,610
I have something to tell her.

609
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,930
Then we'll leave first.

610
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,850
-Bye, bosses. -Bye bye.

611
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:20,650
Bye bye.

612
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:22,150
Stop making this sound. Let's go.

613
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:23,460
I understand.

614
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,960
What do you want to tell me, Mr. Lou?

615
00:22:26,550 --> 00:22:27,270
Something important.

616
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,130
Something important? What is it?

617
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,140
Catch the adulterers.

618
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,660
Catch the adulterers. Again?

619
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,710
So exciting.

620
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,520
Who are the adulterers? Have you caught them?

621
00:22:34,540 --> 00:22:35,110
Yes.

622
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:36,770
She's right in front of me.

623
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:41,410
Stop looking.

624
00:22:44,280 --> 00:22:44,960
Me?

625
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:46,590
As the wife of Peony's boss,

626
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:48,210
you want to cheat on me here?

627
00:22:48,580 --> 00:22:49,710
If I had not come in time,

628
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:51,490
what would others have said about it?

629
00:22:52,830 --> 00:22:53,310
I...

630
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,530
It's getting late.

631
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:56,010
Mrs. Lou, where do you want to go?

632
00:22:56,030 --> 00:22:56,830
I'll drive you there.

633
00:22:57,060 --> 00:22:58,050
Mr. Lou.

634
00:22:58,070 --> 00:22:59,350
Let me explain.

635
00:22:59,380 --> 00:23:00,980
Explain? I don't want to hear your explanation.

636
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,530
You'll say those flattering words again.

637
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,300
You'd better think about

638
00:23:04,430 --> 00:23:06,320
how to get my forgiveness.

639
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,820
Maybe when I'm in a good mood,

640
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,270
I won't punish you.

641
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:14,560
Do you mean that I should make you happy?

642
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:15,110
Yes.

643
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:15,980
Make me happy.

644
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:19,310
Besides,

645
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,910
what are you wearing?

646
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,630
I've heard that

647
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:28,060
you can make some money as a shill.

648
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:29,640
Remember to transfer the money to me.

649
00:23:31,240 --> 00:23:33,080
["Meet Your True Love" Dating Club]

650
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,300
God.

651
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,680
Life is so hard.

652
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,200
By the way, Mr. Su,

653
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,430
Mr. Zhang has replied to my message.

654
00:23:50,460 --> 00:23:51,910
He also sent me an address.

655
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,300
He said he can see you and talk with you.

656
00:23:54,430 --> 00:23:55,700
But you don't have to have dinner with him.

657
00:23:56,530 --> 00:23:57,090
Okay.

658
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,730
Then find a massage shop with a good environment

659
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:00,460
and strong privacy.

660
00:24:00,500 --> 00:24:01,210
Book a private room.

661
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:03,030
Okay, I'll search it later.

662
00:24:03,710 --> 00:24:05,290
Massage shop?

663
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:07,080
Mr. Su,

664
00:24:07,330 --> 00:24:09,350
do you want a professional one

665
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:10,540
or an unprofessional one?

666
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:14,780
Well, you even have social connections for this?

667
00:24:15,790 --> 00:24:18,390
Mr. Su, do you want me to have these connections

668
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,660
or not?

669
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,020
Shut up.

670
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,760
You've worked for me for so many years.

671
00:24:22,810 --> 00:24:24,810
But what you're thinking is so strange.

672
00:24:25,010 --> 00:24:26,290
Go on driving the car.

673
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,530
Have you prepared all the food here for me?

674
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:38,330
Of course.

675
00:24:38,360 --> 00:24:39,560
You've been working hard lately.

676
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:40,890
You need to eat more to get some nutrients.

677
00:24:43,710 --> 00:24:44,890
Come on. Have some meat.

678
00:24:46,070 --> 00:24:47,140
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

679
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:47,890
Be careful not to scald your mouth.

680
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,360
Okay.

681
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,430
I'll start eating then.

682
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,470
Can you really eat it?

683
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,510
I'm asking you.

684
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,640
Can you really eat it?

685
00:24:55,130 --> 00:24:57,300
You want to be the boss' wife? Do you deserve it?

686
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:58,990
I'm talking to you, Dong Dong'en.

687
00:24:59,040 --> 00:25:00,030
I've told you about it, haven't I?

688
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm talking about you, Dong Dong'en.

689
00:25:01,160 --> 00:25:02,670
The topic should be more eye-catching.

690
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:04,280
But you have to make it a bit low-key.

691
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,020
Did you hear me?

692
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,880
I've told you about it, haven't I?

693
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:06,990
High-end, elegant and classy.

694
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,190
Low-key, luxurious and meaningful.

695
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,430
Hello.

696
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,260
Hello.

697
00:25:31,810 --> 00:25:32,840
What flowers do you want?

698
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:35,910
I want the flowers to be bright and low-key,

699
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,530
high-end and down-to-earth.

700
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:40,880
Who are you giving them to?

701
00:25:41,390 --> 00:25:43,090
The one who decides my life and death.

702
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:44,680
The father of all fathers.

703
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,620
The father of all fathers?

704
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:49,920
What's wrong?

705
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:50,320
Look.

706
00:25:50,360 --> 00:25:52,640
This is the tasting list we've prepared for Mr. Zhang.

707
00:25:52,950 --> 00:25:53,630
How is it?

708
00:25:55,670 --> 00:25:56,230
What about Cao Ya?

709
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,100
Is there any new sauce we can add to it?

710
00:25:58,130 --> 00:25:59,310
I'll tell her then.

711
00:25:59,350 --> 00:25:59,830
Okay.

712
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:01,790
Come in.

713
00:26:04,300 --> 00:26:04,940
Mr. Lou.

714
00:26:06,390 --> 00:26:08,870
Dong Dong'er from the Ba'er Company has sent you some flowers

715
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:09,680
and a gift.

716
00:26:14,230 --> 00:26:15,630
She's worried that it might be inconvenient for you now,

717
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:16,920
so she's waiting for you downstairs.

718
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:18,540
Are you going to see her?

719
00:26:20,710 --> 00:26:22,820
Come on. Let me read it.

720
00:26:23,410 --> 00:26:25,680
Wish us a happy cooperation.

721
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,380
and long-lasting friendship.

722
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,420
Go ask her to come in.

723
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:28,890
Okay.

724
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,730
But these flowers...

725
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,980
Sunflowers are for fathers.

726
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:34,320
She gave these to you...

727
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:35,390
They're for fathers?

728
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,800
Have you finished the market analysis report?

729
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,600
Do you want to get off work?

730
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:39,030
Always remember that we're good buddies.

731
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:39,630
See you later.

732
00:26:45,280 --> 00:26:46,860
Long-lasting friendship?

733
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:55,850
Hello, Ocean. It's me.

734
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,070
Come to my office.

735
00:26:57,340 --> 00:26:57,820
Okay.

736
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,240
Come in.

737
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:08,240
Mr. Lou.

738
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:09,440
Come in.

739
00:27:14,790 --> 00:27:15,370
Oh no.

740
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:17,260
Why do I feel that

741
00:27:17,320 --> 00:27:18,770
Mr. Lou is in a bad mood?

742
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,480
Are the sunflowers not bright enough

743
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,130
and not influential enough?

744
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:28,150
Mr. Lou.

745
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:31,030
Mr. Lou.

746
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:34,710
I've transferred 500 yuan to you.

747
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:36,180
Remember to take it.

748
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,520
Mr. Lou. Mr. Lou.

749
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:43,030
You've called me Mr. Lou three times since you came in.

750
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:44,310
What?

751
00:27:44,520 --> 00:27:47,160
We haven't seen each other for a day, and you're so aloof.

752
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:49,920
Would the boss' wife treat her husband like that?

753
00:27:49,950 --> 00:27:52,230
No, you really misunderstood it.

754
00:27:52,250 --> 00:27:53,290
I wouldn't have the guts

755
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,360
to say that I'm the boss' wife, right?

756
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,040
Your future wife

757
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:59,750
must be smart and beautiful.

758
00:27:59,770 --> 00:28:01,770
She must come from a prominent family, and must be kind-hearted and pretty.

759
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:02,930
She must be much more excellent than me,

760
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,070
and even work harder than me.

761
00:28:04,310 --> 00:28:05,280
How would I dare to say that I'm the boss' wife?

762
00:28:05,330 --> 00:28:06,540
It's just a rumor spread among the colleagues.

763
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:08,050
Please don't believe it.

764
00:28:08,650 --> 00:28:09,910
Don't believe it?

765
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,440
You seem to enjoy it.

766
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,730
No, no, no. Really.

767
00:28:13,080 --> 00:28:13,490
It's my fault.

768
00:28:14,250 --> 00:28:14,960
Let's get down to business.

769
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,150
Has the payment for Ba'er been settled?

770
00:28:17,280 --> 00:28:18,010
No.

771
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,190
Dahai said that I'm as cunning as a fox spirit.

772
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:20,930
He refused to settle the payment for me.

773
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:23,790
Come in.

774
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,650
Mr. Lou, you want to see me?

775
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:35,150
Why haven't you settled the payment for Ba'er yet?

776
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:40,650
Mr. Lou.

777
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:42,150
You know what?

778
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:44,590
In order to have convenience at work,

779
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,210
Dong Dong'en pretended to be the boss' wife and tricked our colleagues everywhere

780
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:49,030
while you were away.

781
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:51,590
She was so arrogant.

782
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:53,010
Okay.

783
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:56,560
Are the invoices prepared by Ba'er complete?

784
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:58,760
Yes.

785
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,490
Are there any questions from the Legal Department?

786
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,300
No.

787
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:06,050
Since there's no problem,

788
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,700
transfer the money to them.

789
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:10,820
There's one more thing.

790
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,550
We should separate our personal feelings from work.

791
00:29:13,770 --> 00:29:15,710
Don't let your personal feelings affect the overall work progress.

792
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,100
Got it, Mr. Lou.

793
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:19,210
Go.

794
00:29:19,710 --> 00:29:20,350
Go.

795
00:29:28,590 --> 00:29:30,400
Mr. Lou, you are so nice.

796
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:32,390
Not only did you not blame me, but you also helped me.

797
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:34,290
You are my best client.

798
00:29:34,330 --> 00:29:36,460
Mr. Lou, for you, I'll...

799
00:29:41,230 --> 00:29:43,250
Don't think that a bunch of flowers and a gift

800
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,570
can quell my anger.

801
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,310
If this is your way to express your sincere apology,

802
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:48,690
before I get angry,

803
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:49,520
get out.

804
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,240
Okay.

805
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,690
A woman like wind.

806
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:00,200
She ran so fast.

807
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:29,650
♫The weather is very fine today♫

808
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:33,940
♫The scenery is good everywhere♫

809
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,270
Look. A human

810
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,530
has a left hand and a right hand.

811
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,670
Look. A human

812
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:48,880
has a left atrium and a right atrium.

813
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:53,820
Look. A human

814
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,030
has a left brain and a right brain.

815
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:57,470
What on earth do you want to say?

816
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,240
I just want to say that

817
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,380
the organs inside a human's body are in pairs.

818
00:31:01,620 --> 00:31:03,490
People need to be in paris, too.

819
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,180
Although you didn't meet the right person at the dating party that day,

820
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,090
you shouldn't get depressed because of it.

821
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:08,880
So?

822
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,490
So you need to think about

823
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,560
if there are any suitable candidates around you.

824
00:31:14,120 --> 00:31:15,440
According to science,

825
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,830
80% of married couples

826
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:19,490
found their spouses among classmates, colleagues

827
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,140
and close friends.

828
00:31:21,450 --> 00:31:22,700
Think about it carefully.

829
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,080
At least,

830
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:26,070
isn't there a Mr. Lou upstairs?

831
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,630
According to what you said,

832
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:32,130
you are also my classmate and colleague.

833
00:31:32,510 --> 00:31:33,420
What?

834
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,630
You are my true love, too?

835
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,620
-Don't dodge. -No, no, no.

836
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,680
If you don't let go, I'll do a suplex on you.

837
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:40,510
I mean it.

838
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,350
Why are you talking about this impossible thing?

839
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:44,110
Us?

840
00:31:44,130 --> 00:31:45,490
Didn't you start talking about it first?

841
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:46,290
I...

842
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:47,940
I can't explain it to you.

843
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,070
You...

844
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,230
Silly man.

845
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,270
Look at the client's needs.

846
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,850
They said they wanted to lower the price, increase sales volume

847
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:01,110
and provide more special offers.

848
00:32:01,150 --> 00:32:02,330
What kind of proposal did you write?

849
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:03,750
Is your brain the same as your stomach

850
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:04,580
which is full of fat?

851
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:06,670
We should use the strategy of empathy,

852
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:08,640
instead of simply lowering the price.

853
00:32:08,770 --> 00:32:09,880
Don't you think you're old-fashioned?

854
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,350
What era is it now? Use the strategy of empathy?

855
00:32:11,370 --> 00:32:13,060
They want the products to suit customers of all ages.

856
00:32:13,090 --> 00:32:14,790
Suit customers of all ages?

857
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,210
Come on, tell me.

858
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,970
How can this design draft be fashionable

859
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,760
and of a vintage style at the same time?

860
00:32:19,790 --> 00:32:20,630
Tell me. Come on.

861
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,120
No, I...

862
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:23,840
En. En!

863
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:25,910
Why don't you ask Mr. Lou

864
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:27,060
what he wants?

865
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:28,070
Now?

866
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:30,310
It's 12 o'clock now.

867
00:32:30,310 --> 00:32:30,950
It's okay for him to call me.

868
00:32:30,950 --> 00:32:32,360
But if I call him, won't he be angry with me?

869
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:35,960
-Revise it then. -Ke.

870
00:32:36,230 --> 00:32:37,090
Come here and get the bowls.

871
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:39,680
Come on, comrades.

872
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:41,910
The newly developed budae-jjigae hot pot is ready.

873
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,510
-Refresh yourselves. -Come on.

874
00:32:43,510 --> 00:32:44,550
-Coming. -Come on.

875
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,910
Try the new product I've developed.

876
00:32:49,340 --> 00:32:50,070
Come on.

877
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:51,570
These are just instant noodles, aren't they?

878
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:54,920
Upgraded version of instant noodles.

879
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:57,510
Let's all stay in the company tonight.

880
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,190
Again?

881
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,180
A distinction should be made between males and females.

882
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:01,940
I'm the only girl here, and it's inappropriate for me to do this.

883
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:03,990
The women in our company are regarded as men,

884
00:33:04,040 --> 00:33:04,990
while the men in our company are regarded as dogs.

885
00:33:04,990 --> 00:33:06,270
What's the distinction between males and females?

886
00:33:11,570 --> 00:33:12,430
En.

887
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:16,770
Well, has Hai sent new posts on Moments?

888
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:17,840
She blocked me.

889
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:19,410
That's because you're too pretentious.

890
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:20,640
You always post the content about rain

891
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:22,000
and sunny weather every day.

892
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:22,800
Let me tell you.

893
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:24,240
She has broken up with that scumbag recently.

894
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,190
Don't provoke her.

895
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:27,060
They broke up?

896
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:29,690
I knew that man was unreliable.

897
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:31,070
He always brought Hai to

898
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:32,510
a bar or a night club.

899
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,880
Could he be serious in a relationship?

900
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,780
The sooner they broke up, the better.

901
00:33:38,020 --> 00:33:39,710
You said you didn't read her posts on Moments.

902
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:41,190
You've read a lot even though you've been blocked, huh?

903
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:41,980
You know everything.

904
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:42,830
Stop talking.

905
00:33:42,850 --> 00:33:44,290
Then you may survive this episode.

906
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,640
I can't die so soon.

907
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:53,810
Mr. Su,

908
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,000
according to your instruction,

909
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,710
we've sent the prepared data

910
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,090
to Mr. Zhang.

911
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:03,300
What's that smell?

912
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:05,750
Have you not taken a shower for years? You stink.

913
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:09,590
Oh, right. This one.

914
00:34:10,170 --> 00:34:11,449
I spilled it.

915
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,610
This, this, this.

916
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:16,120
Mr. Zhang personally made these pickled cucumbers for you.

917
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,310
He asked me to bring them back for you so that you could taste them.

918
00:34:22,219 --> 00:34:24,230
Did Mr. Zhang say anything useful?

919
00:34:24,659 --> 00:34:25,980
He praised you for your enthusiasm.

920
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,989
He also praised Mr. Lou for his enthusiasm.

921
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:31,429
He also praised you for being considerate.

922
00:34:31,949 --> 00:34:34,159
But he also praised Mr. Lou for being considerate.

923
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,540
Besides, he said you're very good at talking.

924
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:38,710
Of course,

925
00:34:38,739 --> 00:34:41,310
he also praised Miss Cao and Mr. Wang,

926
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,150
and he said Miss Cao is very capable.

927
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:47,449
He tends to be impartial.

928
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,650
According to what you said, who else did he mention?

929
00:34:50,989 --> 00:34:52,350
Miss Cao and Mr. Wang.

930
00:34:52,449 --> 00:34:54,860
They are Mr. Lou's important assistants.

931
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:55,880
According to investigation,

932
00:34:55,920 --> 00:34:56,360
they met each other

933
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:58,630
while studying abroad.

934
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:01,090
They match each other well in terms of

935
00:35:01,230 --> 00:35:02,570
personality and ability.

936
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:04,480
Mr. Lou trusts them very much.

937
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,910
I think their friendship back then

938
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,010
must be very profound.

939
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,440
Profound friendship?

940
00:35:10,070 --> 00:35:12,840
Even if their friendship is profound, it can still be influenced.

941
00:35:12,980 --> 00:35:13,500
Tell me.

942
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:15,060
What should we use to deal with this kind of person?

943
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:17,720
Sincerity?

944
00:35:17,750 --> 00:35:19,070
Use sincerity to impress them.

945
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:21,750
Money.

946
00:35:22,390 --> 00:35:23,670
We should use money.

947
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,450
Money.

948
00:35:27,730 --> 00:35:28,450
Money.

949
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,120
Just go.

950
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:30,790
Okay.

951
00:35:31,150 --> 00:35:32,890
Take your stinky cucumbers away.

952
00:35:33,410 --> 00:35:33,940
I...

953
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:35,750
What should I do with them if I take them away?

954
00:35:35,790 --> 00:35:36,510
You should eat them.

955
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:37,720
Okay.

956
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:48,240
Mr. Wang.

957
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,060
Miss Cao.

958
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,240
Hello, Mr. Su.

959
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,200
I didn’t expect you two to come together.

960
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:08,440
For your appointments with us, one is only half hour later than the other.

961
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:09,520
Why don't we see you together?

962
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,390
It saves time and effort.

963
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:11,920
We are all straightforward people.

964
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,730
Just be frank.

965
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,100
How much are you going to give us

966
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:18,790
so that we'll leave Lou Yuan?

967
00:36:20,660 --> 00:36:22,030
You are quite straightforward.

968
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,580
I've drafted the contract.

969
00:36:28,350 --> 00:36:30,510
If you two think it's suitable,

970
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,360
I can sign it anytime.

971
00:36:33,010 --> 00:36:34,150
Our Sanjiao Group

972
00:36:34,150 --> 00:36:36,120
always welcomes talents.

973
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,650
I won't treat you badly.

974
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,070
[Article 2: Salary Treatment]

975
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,070
[Article 3: Introduction of the Post]

976
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,170
Three million yuan.

977
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,120
Mr. Su, your Sanjiao Group is so rich.

978
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:51,260
I can retire with three million yuan.

979
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,000
Is this all you want?

980
00:36:56,510 --> 00:36:58,540
Mr. Su, it's a deal.

981
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,100
Now I know

982
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,410
how much salary I should ask Lou Yuan to give me.

983
00:37:08,590 --> 00:37:09,790
Thank you, Mr. Su.

984
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:11,660
However, we've

985
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:13,720
decided to stay in the Peony Corporation.

986
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:18,360
If you two are not satisfied with the conditions,

987
00:37:18,380 --> 00:37:19,670
I can add more.

988
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:22,890
Mr. Su,

989
00:37:23,190 --> 00:37:25,470
do you think our friendship with Lou Yuan

990
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:27,430
can be measured by money?

991
00:37:27,460 --> 00:37:30,110
Cao Ya, don't make it difficult for Mr. Su.

992
00:37:30,140 --> 00:37:32,270
You know he has no friends.

993
00:37:32,290 --> 00:37:33,930
You'll hurt his feelings by saying that.

994
00:37:33,980 --> 00:37:35,180
Let's go.

995
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,350
I finally had some time to rest after work.

996
00:37:37,350 --> 00:37:38,230
It's all wasted.

997
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:39,480
Don't be sad.

998
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,210
My heart hurts.

999
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:55,430
Yuan!

1000
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,390
I've been waiting for you for so long.

1001
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,320
Why are you this late?

1002
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,340
Do you know how much money Mr. Su wants to give us?

1003
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,830
Millions of yuan.

1004
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:03,920
You have to compensate us.

1005
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:05,200
If you really want to join his company,

1006
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,110
no one will stop you.

1007
00:38:06,540 --> 00:38:07,300
-Okay. -You…

1008
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:08,600
We can share the money by that time.

1009
00:38:08,850 --> 00:38:09,570
Whoever sees this will get a share.

1010
00:38:09,690 --> 00:38:10,370
That makes sense.

1011
00:38:10,790 --> 00:38:12,210
That's not okay.

1012
00:38:12,230 --> 00:38:14,540
I was born to be a member of Peony, and I'll be a soul of Peony after death.

1013
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:16,960
I want to dedicate myself to the Peony Group.

1014
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:17,750
Alright.

1015
00:38:18,160 --> 00:38:19,150
Are you free tonight?

1016
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,030
Let's have dinner together.

1017
00:38:20,110 --> 00:38:21,070
Okay.

1018
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:22,900
I have plans tonight.

1019
00:38:22,950 --> 00:38:24,750
As single men, you two can have fun yourselves.

1020
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,010
You have an appointment again?

1021
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:27,790
-No, why are you... -You have an appointment again?

1022
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:29,230
Cao Ya, you just can't stay idle.

1023
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:53,870
Hurry up!

1024
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,440
Hurry!

1025
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,290
Run! Run! Run!

1026
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,650
It's impossible to defend it!

1027
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,470
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1028
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,370
You... You're a typical person who is addicted to games but is bad at playing games.

1029
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:09,370
Those poor students tend to have a lot of stationery.

1030
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,340
You're not okay today. You haven't scored.

1031
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:12,700
Fine. I quit.

1032
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:13,640
How boring.

1033
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:15,400
Well...

1034
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:19,450
I understand.

1035
00:39:20,040 --> 00:39:22,540
Playing games with your buddy

1036
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:23,910
is definitely not

1037
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:26,630
as interesting as flirting with the customer service girl.

1038
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,230
Right?

1039
00:39:29,110 --> 00:39:31,360
Customer? What custmer service?

1040
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:32,440
What girl?

1041
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:34,150
Do you think I'm like you?

1042
00:39:34,150 --> 00:39:36,000
You always think about girls.

1043
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:37,590
Girls, girls... You have a romantic relationship everywhere.

1044
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,240
Really?

1045
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:40,720
How about this?

1046
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:42,820
Recently,

1047
00:39:42,940 --> 00:39:45,940
I've found that Miss En from Ba'er

1048
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:48,590
is very cute and beautiful.

1049
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:49,810
I've never

1050
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:52,090
met this kind of girl before.

1051
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,550
I'm very interested.

1052
00:39:56,110 --> 00:39:56,940
You can't tolerate the joke?

1053
00:39:56,960 --> 00:39:58,290
You're strangling me.

1054
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,290
I'm warning you.

1055
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,270
Dong Dong'en is a member of Ba'er.

1056
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,330
She's from our partner company.

1057
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,360
Don't act recklessly.

1058
00:40:04,520 --> 00:40:05,570
You're angry.

1059
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:08,030
Your anger indicates that you have a feeling for her.

1060
00:40:08,060 --> 00:40:08,500
I...

1061
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:09,390
You have a feeling for her.

1062
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,280
What kind of feeling would I have?

1063
00:40:11,300 --> 00:40:11,910
I quit.

1064
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:12,670
Play it yourself.

1065
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:13,670
You...

1066
00:40:14,990 --> 00:40:16,160
It's already 12:30.

1067
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:17,830
I'll make do with it by sleeping at your home tonight.

1068
00:40:19,490 --> 00:40:21,050
There's no place for you in my room.

1069
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:22,900
Sleep on the sofa or leave.

1070
00:40:23,140 --> 00:40:24,110
Just make a choice.

1071
00:40:26,750 --> 00:40:28,590
Who wants to sleep in your room?

1072
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,930
I would rather sleep with a dog than sleep with you in the same room.

1073
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:37,020
Little En.

1074
00:40:38,070 --> 00:40:39,380
En.

1075
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:41,490
Good night.

1076
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,860
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
