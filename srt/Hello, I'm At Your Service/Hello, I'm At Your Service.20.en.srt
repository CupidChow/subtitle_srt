Why should I be unsatisfied?

175
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:20,820
Of course.

176
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:22,550
My parents are

177
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:23,700
the best in the world.

178
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:26,280
But I like Auntie Lou too.

179
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,140
Silly girl.

180
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:32,000
Why do you have so many questions today?

181
00:09:32,550 --> 00:09:34,070
Did my mom scare you,

182
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,090
and that's why you panicked?

183
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,910
I just think

184
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:41,030
that you brought me a lot of things.

185
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:44,310
But I can't reward you much.

186
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,960
You have no idea how good you are.

187
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:56,330
You can bring me a lot of happiness

188
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,570
and peace of mind.

189
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,860
It's hard for two people to be together.

190
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,250
But remember,

191
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,500
I will always be with you.

192
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,780
No matter what happens,

193
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:08,300
we'll face it together.

194
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:26,890
It's late.

195
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,380
Wouldn't you gain weight if you eat melon seeds now?

196
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:30,610
Aren't you on a diet?

197
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,660
Didn't you want to be pretty?

198
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,140
I was betrayed by my best friend.

199
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:34,000
I'm upset.

200
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,580
I know I was wrong.

201
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,800
But this is also very sudden to me.

202
00:10:37,830 --> 00:10:39,260
I'm still getting ready for it.

203
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:41,060
I don't want to hear it.

204
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,140
I only know

205
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:44,710
that I've only been in the filming crew for only two days and you're getting engaged.

206
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:46,220
Believe me.

207
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,420
This is very sudden to me.

208
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,740
I still feel like I'm dreaming.

209
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,620
I feel empty.

210
00:10:58,500 --> 00:10:59,340
I won't tease you anymore.

211
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,500
Actually, I'm happy that you are getting married.

212
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,250
Did Lou Yuan give you a diamond ring?

213
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:16,280
Your mother-in-law is so generous.

214
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,120
When you become a superstar,

215
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,970
you will have such a big diamond ring.

216
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:21,340
It must be better than this one.

217
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,050
But I have good news for you.

218
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:27,450
I got the role of the third lead actress in a drama through an interview.

219
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,390
Really?

220
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:30,340
Great. You're going to be popular soon.

221
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,180
Keep a low profile.

222
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
It's a role in a low-budget web series.

223
00:11:33,820 --> 00:11:35,730
The previous director said I was talented.

224
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,580
So he recommended me to the audition director.

225
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,340
I just wanted to give it a try.

226
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,640
I didn't expect that I got it.

227
00:11:41,090 --> 00:11:42,240
Great! Great!

228
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,640
Well.

229
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:46,170
Are you going to stay with the filming crew?

230
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,830
Wouldn't Trouble Ma go crazy?

231
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,890
Yes.

232
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,460
I don't want to leave him.

233
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,260
But I've discussed it with him.

234
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,670
I'll try my best this time.

235
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,290
After all, I like this job so much.

236
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,050
Yeah, give it a try.

237
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:01,240
I believe you can do it.

238
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:03,400
Come on, sign for me.

239
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,130
Okay, but I won't sign here.

240
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:06,060
I'll sign on your face.

241
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,330
Then I'll never wash my face.

242
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:08,330
Then don't do it.

243
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,280
Sign it.

244
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,810
-Don’t wash it.
-You sign it.

245
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,300
I've never seen

246
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,500
such a big diamond ring in my life.

247
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,930
It must look nice on you.

248
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,710
[Party A] [Nandu Peony Flavor Food Co., Ltd.]

249
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:18,710
[Party B] [Chen Wende]

250
00:12:18,550 --> 00:12:19,420
I believe

251
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:21,140
after Mr. Chen joins us,

252
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,940
we will have a new vitality.

253
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:26,290
[Peony]

254
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:24,660
After signing this,

255
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:26,180
I'll be your client.

256
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:28,580
Don't go against me

257
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:29,760
or complain.

258
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:36,390
[Peony]

259
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,490
It's my shop.

260
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,580
Do as I say.

261
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:34,940
Don't do

262
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:37,020
anything weird to it.

263
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:38,050
Okay?

264
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,050
Okay.

265
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,270
I'll listen to you.

266
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,850
You have a good attitude.

267
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,040
But I have to tell you

268
00:12:44,070 --> 00:12:45,940
that it's not easy to earn my money.

269
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,030
[Peony]

270
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:47,770
I only have one request.

271
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:49,540
Make a good design.

272
00:12:50,060 --> 00:12:50,710
Look.

273
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,900
I haven't said anything yet.

274
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,540
The two of you meet again after a long time.

275
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,370
You should work together happily this time.

276
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,540
Let me make it clear.

277
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,120
I didn't ask for you.

278
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:04,210
But your design fits my requirements.

279
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:05,090
I understand.

280
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,190
I didn't take this job because of you.

281
00:13:07,470 --> 00:13:10,090
It was because I saw these kids

282
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,420
working hard.

283
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:16,230
[Peony]

284
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:12,320
Fine, then.

285
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:14,060
Li Li'an,

286
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:16,200
do you have any other requests to tell the designer?

287
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:19,080
Mr. Chen is an expert in this industry.

288
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,610
I'm looking forward to seeing his work.

289
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:22,380
All right, cut the empty talk.

290
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,720
Let's get to work.

291
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,250
Congratulations.

292
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,070
Wan.

293
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,220
How did it go?

294
00:13:44,810 --> 00:13:45,610
Don't worry.

295
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,800
We've tried our best.

296
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:49,500
I should thank you.

297
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,730
When there's work, you still think of me.

298
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,800
I'll treat you to dinner someday.

299
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,270
Forget it.

300
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,780
We small companies need to unite.

301
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:59,560
Besides, we've known each other for so many years.

302
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:01,870
You offer good value for money and perform well.

303
00:14:01,890 --> 00:14:03,150
It'll be a fool not to hire you.

304
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,390
But I have to remind you.

305
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,880
This is the No. 1 demonstration shop of the Peony Dining Salon series.

306
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:09,140
Keep an eye on it.

307
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:10,340
Don't let anything go wrong.

308
00:14:10,370 --> 00:14:11,580
Don't worry.

309
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:12,790
Look.

310
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,340
We use the best materials in China.

311
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,490
Besides, our workers

312
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:17,200
are experienced.

313
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:19,470
Don't worry. I'll finish work on time.

314
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,060
That's good.

315
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:21,960
Well.

316
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:23,360
Safety first.

317
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:24,600
Guys, be careful.

318
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:25,310
OK.

319
00:14:25,430 --> 00:14:26,280
Thank you.

320
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,540
Boss.

321
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:32,150
I'm here.

322
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:33,980
Zhenzhen, you're here.

323
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,040
What did you buy?

324
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,480
Water. Here.

325
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:38,630
This is...

326
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:39,960
Hello, Wan.

327
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,200
I forgot to introduce to you, Wan.

328
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:42,780
This is our customer service.

329
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,620
Lan Zhenzhen.

330
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,860
When I'm not here,

331
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:46,090
go to her if you need anything.

332
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:47,500
Come to me if you need anything.

333
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:48,100
Hello.

334
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,320
Hello.

335
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,430
Zhenzhen.

336
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:52,110
Distribute the drinks to the workers.

337
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:52,650
Sure.

338
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:53,910
Thank you for your hard work.

339
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:55,000
Have some water.

340
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:55,640
Thank you.

341
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:56,270
Thank you.

342
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:59,350
An, thank you so much

343
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:01,040
for coming to help me.

344
00:15:01,060 --> 00:15:01,850
I really don't know

345
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:03,410
what young people like nowadays.

346
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:07,220
Lou Yuan is a brat.

347
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,640
He didn’t tell me he was dating En.

348
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,610
They were secretly dating.

349
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:15,020
That's why I wanted to match you and him.

350
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:16,700
I was wrong.

351
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:18,480
Don’t take it to heart.

352
00:15:18,510 --> 00:15:19,700
It's okay, Auntie.

353
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:21,650
I'm happy to contribute

354
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:22,760
to their engagement ceremony.

355
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:25,100
And what you said sounded like a joke.

356
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,540
I didn't take it seriously.

357
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,260
Fine, if you say so,

358
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,540
I feel relieved.

359
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,810
I'll check the process with them first.

360
00:15:32,570 --> 00:15:33,160
Okay.

361
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:34,340
Hello.

362
00:15:34,360 --> 00:15:35,230
-This way, please.
-Okay.

363
00:15:36,050 --> 00:15:37,970
Auntie, let me introduce to you briefly.

364
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:39,830
Our souvenirs...

365
00:15:39,860 --> 00:15:41,230
There are 11 seats around a table.

366
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:42,450
Let's reserve six rows.

367
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,560
Remove the other tables.

368
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:44,030
Okay.

369
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,210
As to the flowers,

370
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:46,700
prepare as many as you can.

371
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:47,180
Okay.

372
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:48,590
Have you checked the MC's rundown?

373
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,580
Yes.

374
00:15:49,940 --> 00:15:51,590
Don't make any mistakes.

375
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:53,010
Especially the engagement ring.

376
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:54,660
Make sure to present it at the right time.

377
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,170
Okay.

378
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:55,750
