You are here.

7
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,560
Thank you for today.

8
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:06,030
If it weren't for you,

9
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:08,960
we wouldn't have had a second chance.

10
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,660
No need to thank me.

11
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,710
Actually,

12
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,340
I've been thinking a lot recently.

13
00:02:17,820 --> 00:02:19,600
About us,

14
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:22,010
I was thoughtless.

15
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:23,610
I put a lot of pressure on you.

16
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,180
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,280
It has nothing to do with you.

18
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:30,700
Even if I try my best for the rest of my life,

19
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,390
I still may not get what you gave me.

20
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:37,980
Actually, I should have been mentally prepared.

21
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,860
But when it happened suddenly,

22
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,460
I couldn't bear it.

23
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:46,340
Fool.

24
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:49,620
Didn't we agree not to bear it alone?

25
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,270
You still have me.

26
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,500
Didn't we agree

27
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:03,360
to face and solve problems together?

28
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,570
Actually,

29
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:12,450
this is my own problem.

30
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:14,600
It has nothing to do with you.

31
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:16,590
If

32
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,850
I can't figure it out,

00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,520
when I face problems in the future,

34
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:23,870
I will still be overwhelmed

35
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,040
by the public opinion and trivial things.

36
00:03:28,210 --> 00:03:29,810
So I hope

37
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:31,780
you can give me some time

38
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:33,890
to think about

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,750
how to move forward with you in the future.

40
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:40,510
Okay.

41
00:03:41,340 --> 00:03:42,180
I'll be waiting.

42
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,500
But

43
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,190
you can't just abandon me while you're thinking.

44
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,020
I'm gonna go back first.

Where is Chunhua?

46
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:30,680
Did his father take him away again?

He asked me to make a choice

57

between going home and going back to the company.

58

he will...

68
00:05:28,820 --> 00:05:29,940
He will ask you to go back?

69
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,390
He will destroy Eighty-two Studio himself.

70

And I won't have another choice

71

except going home to inherit the family business.

72
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:39,720
Looks like he still doesn't trust us.

73
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,990
Then we have to work harder.

Are you really going to break up?

81

Yuan is so nice to En.

86
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,230
I really don't understand why she's hesitating.

87
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,280

But in my opinion,

91
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:16,420
the more thoughtful you are,

92
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:18,220
the more useless En thinks she is.

93

The cyberbullying this time

94
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,220
is the last straw

95
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,740
that made her like this.

96
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:28,430
Think about it.

Of course not.

102

En told me the same thing.

103

107

Yes.

116
00:07:33,790 --> 00:07:35,860
I had an enlarged class, and it was overrun.

117

[Mr. Lou]

379
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:11,790
I just like you.

380
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,340
I don't want to give up.

381
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,620
I want to face it with you.

382
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,050
We can solve all the problems together.

383
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:21,620
I want to keep trying.

384
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,290
Can you give me a chance?

385
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:28,630
So I want to become someone

386
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:29,910
who En can rely on.

387
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:33,000
I will do my best to take care of her,

388
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,710
protect her, love her,

389
00:19:35,830 --> 00:19:36,710
and let her rely on me.

390
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:38,250
Silly girl.

391
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:40,940
Didn't we agree not to bear it alone?

392
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:42,640
You still have me.

393
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:44,720
But

394
00:19:44,990 --> 00:19:47,180
you can't just abandon me while you're thinking.

We haven't eaten together for a long time.

415
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,900
I've been thinking all this time.

416
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:47,600
A relationship

417
00:21:47,950 --> 00:21:50,250
is like we're reading the same book.

418
00:21:51,490 --> 00:21:53,060
I'm faster than you.

419
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,740
So I can't wait

420
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:55,850
to share the story in the latter part

421
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,260

422
00:21:58,340 --> 00:21:59,620
But now I've realized

423
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,060
this is wrong.

424
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:04,550
I should wait for you

425
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,080
to explore those unknown stories

426
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,480
with you.

427
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:12,770
But what if I can't catch up with you

428
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,170
no matter how hard I try?

429
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,420
I respect every choice you make.

430
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:19,900
But you can't change yourself

431
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:21,060
for anyone.

432
00:22:22,470 --> 00:22:23,710
You are Dong Dong'en.

433
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:25,910
That's why I like you.

434
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,950
I don't want to leave you.

435
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,020
Neither do I.

436
00:22:38,770 --> 00:22:39,460
Yes.

437
00:22:39,550 --> 00:22:41,600
I'm Dong Dong'en, the top customer service staff member.

438
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,870
I've gone through a lot.

439
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:47,040
No matter how difficult the problem is, I can solve it.

440
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:49,960
But because

441
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,180
it's you.

442
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,490
So I think

443
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,790
no matter what I do,

444
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,020
I can't do it well.

445
00:23:02,810 --> 00:23:03,800
It's my fault.

446
00:23:05,390 --> 00:23:07,000
This is also my first time being in a relationship.

447
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,760
I was thoughtless.

448
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:12,960
I don't know what you really want.

449
00:23:13,470 --> 00:23:15,700
I always did what I thought was good for you.

450
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,140
I neglected your feelings.

451
00:23:30,020 --> 00:23:30,820
I'm sorry.

452
00:23:35,450 --> 00:23:37,090
I still haven't

453
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,230
thought through the future plan.

454
00:23:39,610 --> 00:23:41,800
Maybe it'll take long.

455
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:44,880
Will you wait for me?

456
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,220
Of course.

457
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,940
Just be yourself bravely.

458
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,790
I'll always be proud of you.

459
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:57,800
My smart En

460
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,740

461
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,660
Remember to promote me.

462
00:24:01,860 --> 00:24:03,550
Don't forget me when you get rich.

463
00:24:04,350 --> 00:24:06,180
Circumstances change with the passage of time.

464
00:24:06,290 --> 00:24:08,640
Miss Dong sounds quite pleasant.

465
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,460
Then I'll call you that.

466
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,150
Miss Dong.

467
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,320
Well, that's not necessary.

468
00:24:15,350 --> 00:24:17,340
Mrs. Lou, your cake.

469
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:20,080
Mrs. Lou.

470
00:24:22,510 --> 00:24:23,310
Have some cake.

471
00:24:30,030 --> 00:24:30,630
Have a bite.

472
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:34,940
How does it taste?

473
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:39,290
Women wear skirts in nightclubs, okay?

474
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:40,150
Have you been there?

475
00:24:41,410 --> 00:24:42,630
I have never been there.

476
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,700
Really?

477
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:45,030
I just remember that...

478
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:49,870
All right, go back and rest early.

479
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,480
You too.

480
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:56,020
Good night.

481
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:56,670
Good night.

482
00:24:57,250 --> 00:24:57,820
I'm leaving.

483
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,420
Go.

484
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,600
Hello, it's me.

485
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:10,840
Hello, Mr. Lou.

486
00:25:11,110 --> 00:25:12,400
I found something.

487
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:15,430
Okay, thank you.

488
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:32,960
Here's 500,000 yuan.

489
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,040
It's the mental damage compensation for you.

490
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,080
I've checked.

491
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,900
You can only sue me for defamation at most.

492
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:42,040
And you don't have solid evidence.

493
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,400
I'm going abroad soon.

494
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,630
A new company and a new man.

495
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,870
So I don't want to cause myself any trouble.

496
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,930
It's better

497
00:25:53,330 --> 00:25:54,940
to solve the problem once and for all.

498
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,540
I won't sue you.

499
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,390
You won't.

500
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:02,890
But Lou Yuan

501
00:26:03,710 --> 00:26:05,060
probably won't let me go.

502
00:26:06,280 --> 00:26:07,350
Did he come to you?

503
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,910
His lawyer came to me.

504
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:15,000
So you are giving me money

505
00:26:15,130 --> 00:26:16,300
because his lawyer came to you?

506
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,650
I won't take the money.

507
00:26:24,770 --> 00:26:25,920
What do you want then?

508
00:26:26,420 --> 00:26:28,350
You made Ke get hurt first.

509
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,970
Then you spread rumors and made me suffer from cyberbullying.

510
00:26:31,150 --> 00:26:32,750
After we found out the truth,

511
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,980
you are afraid of getting into trouble.

512
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:35,900
So you want to settle everything with money.

513
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,750
Li Li'an, in your eyes,

514
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,740
do you think money can solve every problem?

515
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:48,070
Why would I waste my time

516
00:26:48,380 --> 00:26:50,170
if I can solve it with money?

517
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:52,450
Then I'm telling you.

518
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,380
This time, it's not a problem

519
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:55,980
you can solve with money.

520
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,530
I despise your money.

521
00:26:57,660 --> 00:26:59,700
So take your money and go as far as you can.

522
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:02,010
Because I can't guarantee

523
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:03,840
when I see you next time, I can still talk to you calmly.

524
00:27:08,530 --> 00:27:10,970
Since you've decided to be with Lou Yuan,

525
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,030
you have to put up with others' judgments.

526
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,010
Dong Dong'en.

527
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:18,130
You'd better wear this crown well.

528
00:27:18,870 --> 00:27:20,070
Don't let it fall off.

529
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,280
Only self-contemptuous and weak people

530
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,100
care about what others think.

531
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,220
Besides,

532
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:29,760
I don't need the so-called crown

533
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,140
to prove myself.

534
00:27:46,930 --> 00:27:48,080
Mr. Lou, why are you here?

535
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:48,750
K...

536
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,240
Ke.

537
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:50,900
Ke.

538
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,580
Hurry up.

539
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:52,990
Mr. Lou, you are here.

540
00:27:53,010 --> 00:27:53,890
En isn't here, right?

541
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,210
She's not back yet.

542
00:27:55,510 --> 00:27:56,960
I've figured out

543
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,660
what you told me last time.

544
00:27:57,990 --> 00:27:58,830
Those people

545
00:27:58,860 --> 00:27:59,750
are cunning.

546
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:01,060
They have more than one hideout.

547
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,060
But we are

548
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:03,620
experienced, right?

549
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:06,370
I contacted the studio who uploaded the video.

550
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,440
Fatty and I disguised as clients and went there.

551
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:10,900
We told them we were there to slander our competitors.

552
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:12,380
They understood immediately

553
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,000
and gave us a price.

554
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:15,520
I asked Fatty to record a video.

555
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:16,660
Do you want to take a look?

556
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:17,270
Okay.

557
00:28:23,040 --> 00:28:25,110
Look. This is it.

558
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:27,670
Only our company

559
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:31,920
[Make a fortune]

560
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,780
is good at doing this kind of thing.

00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,910
What kind of thing is that?

750
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,720
We're doomed.

751
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,140
[Letter of Resignation]

752
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:35,740
Su Qi,

753
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,380
you want to resign?

754
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,620
Didn't I ask you to take a leave?

755
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:42,450
No, Mr. Wan. Thank you for your kindness.

756
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:45,710
Triangle has you. I'm not worried.

757
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,440
You are my favorite subordinate.

758
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:54,130
Besides, the future of Triangle is in your hands.

759
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:56,440
Mr. Wan, don't say that.

760
00:35:56,990 --> 00:35:59,480
I'm no match for you.

761
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,440
You'd better give the future of Triangle

762
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,300
to Song Zhen.

763
00:36:06,620 --> 00:36:08,020
You're talented.

764
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:09,520
I've cultivated you for so long.

765
00:36:10,050 --> 00:36:11,280
Now you're leaving.

766
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:13,280
I really don't want you to leave.

767
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,430
But I understand.

768
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,340
As a son, you should be filial.

769
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:18,320
Taking care of your father

770
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:19,810
is your obligation.

771
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,060
Yes.

772
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,480
After all, my father is my real family.

773
00:36:27,710 --> 00:36:28,240
Okay.

774
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:29,830
I'll make an exception.

775
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:31,840
You don't have to come to work next Monday.

776
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,580
I wish Professor Su good health.

777
00:36:42,990 --> 00:36:44,630
You've done so many things with me.

778
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:46,070
You want to leave?

779
00:36:47,630 --> 00:36:48,710
It's too late.

780
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:58,960
Hello?

781
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,280
When?

782
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,330
I'll buy the goods.

783
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,100
Come to my club and let's talk.

784
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:15,780
In addition to the measurement of regular protein

785
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,630
and carbohydrates,

786
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:19,430
our factory also introduced

787
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,190
Brabender viscometers

788
00:37:21,220 --> 00:37:22,900
to measure the viscosity of products

789
00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:24,870
in order to evaluate the product structure.

790
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:27,010
Actually,

791
00:37:27,010 --> 00:37:29,100
it's good as long as we can guarantee the quality of the products.

792
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:30,460
Quality is the most important.

793
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,900
Mr. Wang.

794
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,560
Don't worry.

795
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:36,090
We can guarantee the quality of the products.

796
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,430
From the ingredients

797
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,260
to the production process

798
00:37:37,490 --> 00:37:40,020
[Peony]

799
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:40,000
and the point-of-sale terminal,

800
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,210
we will do inspection comprehensively.

801
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:48,010
[Peony]

802
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:45,030
Bro, it's not the first time we've cooperated.

803
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,680
I'm gonna skip the formalities.

804
00:37:46,710 --> 00:37:47,980
Name your price.

805
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:50,230
What a coincidence. This year,

806
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:52,140
we have a batch of cheap beef.

807
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:54,790
[Peony]

808
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,990
It hasn't arrived yet.

809
00:37:54,330 --> 00:37:55,860
But don't worry about the source.

810
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:57,330
Since you are my regular client,

811
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,440
[Peony]

812
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,340
if you order a lot,

813
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:00,620
I'll deliver it to you first.

814
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,170
[Peony]

815
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,770
Bro, as long as I receive the goods, I'll transfer the money to you.

816
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,540
What do you think? Happy cooperation.

817
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:06,340
Come on.

818
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,310
Happy cooperation.

819
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,220
Let's go. Hurry.

820
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,460
It's freezing.

821
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,060
Let's go.

822
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,260
What are you looking at?

823
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,580
Mr. Lou, you're finally back.

824
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,840
Zheng Chao wanted to see you, but you weren't here.

825
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,440
So Chairman met him on behalf of you.

826
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:28,160
Well,

827
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,900
we don't know what they said.

828
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,960
Chairman beat him.

829
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,190
Beat him?

830
00:38:33,820 --> 00:38:35,060
Let's go take a look now.

831
00:38:35,060 --> 00:38:35,620
Come in.

832
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:36,200
Hurry up.

833
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,500
It's my fault.

834
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:39,180
I...

835
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:40,580
Chairman, you did the right thing.

836
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,340
You made me sober.

837
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,860
I shouldn't have...

838
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,220
Don't try to fool me by pretending to be pitiful.

839
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:46,620
How could you have no conscience at all?

840
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:47,860
Chairman, Mr. Lou is here.

841
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,860
Come here. Listen.

842
00:38:51,220 --> 00:38:52,450
Everything has been recorded here.

843
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:58,140
At Mr. Zhang's tasting event,

844
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:00,300
I need you to destroy

845
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,410
Peony Corporation's supplies.

846
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:02,670
Don't let anyone else see you.

847
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:05,380
Find out Dong Dong'en's whereabouts and address,

848
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,240
and send them to me.

849
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:09,330
When you shoot the sauce commercial on location next week,

850
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,500
do something for me.

851
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,110
Make it big.

852
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:21,460
You are the one who almost got En killed, right?

853
00:39:21,570 --> 00:39:23,330
I didn't mean to do that.

854
00:39:23,620 --> 00:39:25,030
Su Qi forced me.

855
00:39:25,410 --> 00:39:26,700
And he often asked me to steal

856
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,100
the company's information and documents.

857
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,480
I really didn't want to do that.

858
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,780
But... But he found my place.

859
00:39:32,780 --> 00:39:33,720
He threatened me.

860
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,680
I had no choice.

861
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:36,810
You had no choice?

862
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:38,960
You had many choices.

863
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:40,770
But you chose to trust him and cooperate with him.

864
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,300
Yes.

865
00:39:43,810 --> 00:39:45,220
I was wrong.

866
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,110
But he has left Triangle.

867
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:50,380
I can tell you a lot of things. Really.

868
00:39:50,550 --> 00:39:51,060
If I don't tell you,

869
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,920
I'll feel guilty.

870
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:55,550
En, En.

871
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,490
I'm sorry. Sorry.

872
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:58,840
Please forgive me.

873
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,030
I really didn't want to do that to you.

874
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:03,410
I don't want any trouble.

875
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:09,020
Really, why would I lie to you?

876
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,350
I'm telling the truth.

877
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,040
Give me a chance

878
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,360
to testify against Su Qi

879
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,020
and make him pay the price he deserves.

880
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:17,990
Yes, let's call the police.

881
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,890
Let them arrest Su Qi.

882
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,100
I... I'll go with you.

883
00:40:22,130 --> 00:40:22,960
No way.

884
00:40:23,390 --> 00:40:24,480
Leave the recorder here.

885
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:25,280
You leave.

886
00:40:26,620 --> 00:40:28,840
You'll be given a suspension without pay starting from tomorrow.

887
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,390
I'll ask Zhu Li

888
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:31,790
to prepare a separate station for you in the company.

889
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,460
Report on time every day.

890
00:40:33,870 --> 00:40:35,180
Before we settle the problem,

891
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:36,400
keep your mouth shut.

892
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:37,040
Leave.

893
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:38,380
Mr. Lou. Mr. Lou.

894
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,480
How can you let him go?

895
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:39,980
Mr. Lou.

896
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,590
-How could you let him stay in the company?
-Mr. Lou.

897
00:40:41,740 --> 00:40:44,060
-Mr. Lou.
-A scumbag like him should be arrested.

898
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:46,710
What are you thinking?

899
00:40:46,730 --> 00:40:48,520
Why do you still keep him?

900
00:40:48,630 --> 00:40:49,890
Auntie, listen to me.

901
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,820
If they know anything about a mole

902
00:40:51,820 --> 00:40:53,460
or malicious business competition,

903
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:55,800
it's not good for Peony's image either.

904
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:56,480
Then...

905
00:40:56,710 --> 00:40:58,080
What should we do?

906
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:01,910
En, what do you think?

907
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,360
If I were Zheng Chao,

908
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,990
since Su Qi has left Triangle,

909
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,310
for me,

910
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,970
a potential threat has left.

911
00:41:10,010 --> 00:41:11,580
Then no one will know

912
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:12,990
what I did before

913
00:41:13,090 --> 00:41:14,560
since he has left.

914
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,760
Maybe I could get a promotion and a salary increase.

915
00:41:16,940 --> 00:41:19,360
So Zheng Chao

916
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:20,470
won't report Su Qi.

917
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:21,460
Mom.

918
00:41:21,590 --> 00:41:22,600
En is right.

919
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:23,980
Zheng Chao's behavior

920
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:25,280
seems normal,

921
00:41:25,470 --> 00:41:27,080
but it's actually very strange.

922
00:41:27,830 --> 00:41:28,940
Su Qi lost his power.

923
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,340
Could there be someone more powerful than him

924
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,050
threatening or bribing Zheng Chao

925
00:41:33,200 --> 00:41:35,930
to let him lure us to sue Su Qi?

926
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,400
So that he is the one who will eventually gain benefits.

927
00:41:37,820 --> 00:41:39,100
The person behind this

928
00:41:39,190 --> 00:41:41,220
knows clearly Zheng Chao is our important witness

929
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:43,130
against Su Qi for unfair business competition

930
00:41:43,300 --> 00:41:44,480
and we'll attach great importance to him

931
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,660
and even protect him.

932
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,080
If we let him go now,

933
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:49,890
he will think that his plan

934
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:50,700
didn't work.

935
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:52,470
So he will take the next step.

936
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:54,550
And it'll be easier for us to know his weak points.

937
00:41:56,190 --> 00:41:57,630
As for Zheng Chao,

938
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,900
now he must think

939
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:00,610
he failed

940
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:03,120
and he might easily be killed by the person behind this.

941
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:05,050
So he would cooperate with us more easily.

942
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,060
I let him go,

943
00:42:07,380 --> 00:42:08,500
so that he won't run away.

944
00:42:10,890 --> 00:42:13,460
There are many directors

945
00:42:13,490 --> 00:42:14,480
in the board of Triangle.

946
00:42:14,950 --> 00:42:16,750
They have a lot of conflicts.

947
00:42:17,230 --> 00:42:19,430
But who is behind this?

948
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,280
No matter who's behind this,

949
00:42:21,940 --> 00:42:24,370
he is definitely not on Su Qi's side.

950
00:42:25,650 --> 00:42:27,480
Do you think Su Qi

951
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,980
will pretend to be pitiful?

952
00:42:31,030 --> 00:42:32,830
If he uses that trick,

953
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,950
I don't see a way out for him.

954
00:42:35,850 --> 00:42:37,050
On the contrary, I think

955
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,140
Su Qi is the person who we can easily control

956
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,360
at the moment.

957
00:42:45,650 --> 00:42:47,360
You young people

958
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:48,440
are really sharp-witted.

959
00:42:49,190 --> 00:42:51,000
I'll listen to you.

960
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:52,480
Do it your way.

961
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:55,660
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
