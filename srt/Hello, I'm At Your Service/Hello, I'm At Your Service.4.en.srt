00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:06,650
Be careful.

377
00:16:06,670 --> 00:16:07,380
This is...

378
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:10,610
Hello, I'm Dong Dong'en, a customer service representative.

379
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,870
Customer service?

380
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,370
You don't have to do that.

381
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:14,840
It's my duty.

382
00:16:14,870 --> 00:16:16,500
I have a car to pick me up.

383
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,240
The car is here.

384
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:18,360
Come on, get in.

385
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:22,360
Come on.

386
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,000
Let's go.

387
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:26,010
I don't usually come here and rarely have a chance to take this.

388
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,840
Come on, get in.

389
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:27,430
Let's go.

390
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:36,610
Lou.

391
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:37,970
Here.

392
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,050
This place

393
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:41,320
is quite close to my hometown.

394
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:43,290
I haven't been back for a long time,

395
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,730
so I thought

396
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,960
maybe I should go back and take a look.

397
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:49,580
These are the pickled vegetables from our hometown.

398
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:50,390
Try it.

399
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:51,900
Okay. It's too kind of you.

400
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:56,900
We have wet towels and dry towels. Which one do you prefer?

401
00:16:56,990 --> 00:16:58,220
You're so considerate.

402
00:16:58,250 --> 00:16:58,930
Good.

403
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:00,720
Thank you, Dong.

404
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:01,860
Lou.

405
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:04,200
I heard the chairman is sick.

406
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,210
Is it serious?

407
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:08,390
I'm in a hurry.

408
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,589
I was thinking of taking time to visit her.

409
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:11,970
Thank you for asking.

410
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,869
My mom is just overworked.

411
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,109
She needs some rest.

412
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:17,160
It's inevitable for old people

413
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,410
to have some health problems.

414
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,040
Right.

415
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:20,770
But she still needs to pay more attention to her health.

416
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:22,900
Well…

417
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,339
The bag seems to be leaking.

418
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:26,099
It's okay.

419
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:27,980
I have a portable one here.

420
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,980
It's sturdy and doesn't leak.

421
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:30,620
Really?

422
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,240
There you go.

423
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:32,070
This is good.

424
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,310
This is good.

425
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,490
You just taught me something new.

426
00:17:41,740 --> 00:17:42,580
Lou.

427
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:45,570
Let's get hammered today.

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,080
Okay.

429
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,520
I'm at your service today.

430
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:51,320
Mr. Zhang.

431
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,190
Hi, my old fellow.

432
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,160
Long time no see.

433
00:17:58,570 --> 00:17:59,950
You two know each other?

434
00:18:00,610 --> 00:18:01,740
That's great.

435
00:18:02,390 --> 00:18:04,300
Su also asked me to meet him.

436
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,220
I thought

437
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,650
it can save time for everyone,

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,520
so I made an appointment with you both.

439
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,610
By the way,

440
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:10,940
do you mind?

441
00:18:11,180 --> 00:18:12,660
Of course not.

442
00:18:12,970 --> 00:18:14,170
It depends on

443
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,390
whether Mr. Lou will mind.

444
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,290
If Mr. Zhang doesn’t mind, of course I won’t.

445
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:22,450
Mr. Lou, don’t force yourself.

446
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:25,190
Don’t ask me for help

447
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:26,690
like you used to when we were at school.

448
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,310
I had to stand up for you.

449
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,140
Su, you're so funny.

450
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:36,930
This is...

451
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,030
Mr. Lou's girlfriend?

452
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:40,660
Stop making fun of me.

453
00:18:40,810 --> 00:18:42,530
She's a customer service representative for Mr. Zhang.

454
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:44,610
I was just kidding.

455
00:18:44,630 --> 00:18:46,150
Look at you. You're so serious.

456
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:48,810
What's your name?

457
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,360
My name is Dong Dong'en.

458
00:18:51,310 --> 00:18:53,320
Gosh. Why is it Su Qi?

459
00:18:53,350 --> 00:18:54,240
What a special name.

460
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:56,160
Come in, Mr. Zhang.

461
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:57,000
Please come in.

462
00:18:57,790 --> 00:18:58,270
Let's go.

463
00:18:58,290 --> 00:18:59,560
Please.

464
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,640
Let's go.

465
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,580
I heard the food here is good.

466
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,480
Try it.

467
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,510
Come again if you like it.

468
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:14,810
Talk less and drink less.

469
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,200
No matter what he requests,

470
00:19:16,220 --> 00:19:16,950
don't say yes.

471
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,700
It's not your business.

472
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:19,090
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

473
00:19:23,050 --> 00:19:23,900
Hangover pill.

474
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,050
Be careful.

475
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,000
He doesn't dare to do anything to me.

476
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:30,460
Besides, why do you have everything in your bag?

477
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:33,340
I can live well with this bag.

478
00:19:33,370 --> 00:19:34,300
As a top customer service representative,

479
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,050
I have to face all kinds of problems calmly.

480
00:19:37,510 --> 00:19:38,180
Let's go.

481
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:50,060
How does it taste?

482
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:51,930
Mr. Zhang.

483
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,690
I heard that Lesifu wants to

484
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:56,310
promote neighborhood checkout-free convenience stores in China.

485
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,150
Actually, the products of our Sanjiao Group

486
00:19:58,170 --> 00:19:59,490
meet your needs well.

487
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,790
If we have a chance to cooperate with you,

488
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:03,360
you won't be disappointed

489
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,130
at the price I offer.

490
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:07,940
To be honest,

491
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,380
Lesifu has been carefully considering

492
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:12,280
promoting our neighborhood checkout-free convenience stores

493
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,180
for a long time.

494
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:16,440
This business mode is more suitable

495
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:20,320
for the fast-paced lifestyle nowadays.

496
00:20:20,570 --> 00:20:23,120
Everyone is clear about the future, right?

497
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:25,840
So,

498
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,660
in the preliminary selection,

499
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:33,260
we value the sales of the products very much.

500
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:36,060
I know your concerns very well.

501
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:39,580
Mr. Zhang.

502
00:20:40,010 --> 00:20:41,580
Here is a data file.

503
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,860
You can take a look first.

504
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,130
Some classic sauces of Peony Corporation

505
00:20:46,170 --> 00:20:48,400
have been showing good sales performance.

506
00:20:46,770 --> 00:20:48,500
[Sales Analysis Report of Classic Peony Sauces]

507
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,430
To expand the market share

508
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:52,860
and satisfy the young customers' preferences,

509
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,890
we've put a lot of effort

510
00:20:54,910 --> 00:20:55,990
into the development of new sauce.

511
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,780
We're confident that

512
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,190
if these products

513
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:00,920
are sold in checkout-free convenience stores,

514
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:03,020
there will be a spectacular sales volume.

515
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:06,180
Mr. Lou, I'm afraid you are way too confident.

516
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:08,750
Of course I'm confident because of our capabilities.

517
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,620
Apart from sales,

518
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,980
as the CEO of the company,

519
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,830
I believe my confirmation on pricing and profitability

520
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,910
should be more reliable

521
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:17,140
than what Director Su says.

522
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,600
I'm afraid that's not exactly true.

523
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,980
Since I came here to discuss cooperation on behalf of Sanjiao Group,

524
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,690
the higher-ups have given me the right to do so.

525
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,300
Mr. Zhang.

526
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,310
If we can cooperate,

527
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:30,170
I'm willing to increase the commission rate to 6%.

528
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,440
6%?

529
00:21:31,710 --> 00:21:33,030
Mr. Su, you should know

530
00:21:33,170 --> 00:21:34,240
in our industry,

531
00:21:34,370 --> 00:21:36,880
the average gross profit margin is less than 20%.

532
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,440
6% is a lot.

533
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,470
If Sanjiao can't make any profit,

534
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:42,570
it won't look good if Sanjiao discontinues the supply half way.

535
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:44,110
It’s not about being generous.

536
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,870
This is our sincerity to Mr. Zhang.

537
00:21:47,010 --> 00:21:48,560
As for the profit of our company,

538
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,360
Mr. Lou, you don't have to worry about it.

539
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:51,110
Well said.

540
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,580
But when it comes to sincerity,

541
00:21:52,620 --> 00:21:53,730
we shouldn’t only talk about profit.

542
00:21:53,810 --> 00:21:55,880
Mr. Zhang, I believe you know

543
00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,950
we can’t only focus on the current interests

544
00:21:57,970 --> 00:21:59,840
but also the future development.

545
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,190
Apart from a high commission rate,

546
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:04,650
our Peony Corporation can provide you with a batch of trial products

547
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:05,920
for free.

548
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:08,660
Good sales and comprehensive capabilities of a company

549
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:11,050
should be a top consideration for a partner.

550
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:11,850
Mr. Zhang…

551
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:12,600
Alright.

552
00:22:13,990 --> 00:22:15,170
Stop talking.

553
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:17,660
I understand what you two said.

554
00:22:19,090 --> 00:22:20,250
We're just gathering today

555
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:21,690
to have a meal, right?

556
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:22,920
As for the cooperation,

557
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:24,770
we can talk about it later.

558
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:25,630
Okay.

559
00:22:25,650 --> 00:22:26,090
Come on.

560
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:26,680
Come on.

561
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:27,390
Come on.

562
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:28,650
Mr. Zhang, cheers.

563
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,320
Bravo!

564
00:22:32,370 --> 00:22:33,900
Wonderful!

565
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:36,370
Business is like a battle.

566
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:37,630
The alcohol tastes good.

567
00:22:38,980 --> 00:22:39,870
Okay, thank you.

568
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,720
Mr. Lou, you're so enthusiastic.

569
00:22:41,770 --> 00:22:43,340
I'll treat you next time.

570
00:22:44,050 --> 00:22:46,490
I'm afraid I don't deserve it.

571
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:47,890
8 p.m. tonight,

572
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:49,160
in the room 806 on the 8th floor

573
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:50,900
of the hotel where you stay.

574
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:51,940
I promise you will be satisfied.

575
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:52,830
That's great.

576
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,660
What are you talking about?

577
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,680
Dong is a good kid.

578
00:22:56,910 --> 00:22:59,080
She knows how to satisfy a client's needs.

579
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,820
Lou, you're a lucky boss.

580
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:04,210
Right.

581
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,240
Exactly.

582
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:07,260
Mr. Lou, I really envy you.

583
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,270
I also want an employee who provides excellent customer service

584
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:11,990
like Dong Dong'en.

585
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,080
Mr. Zhang, please.

586
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:15,950
-Please.
-Here.

587
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:23,440
A customer service representative from a service provider?

588
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:26,660
Okay, I got it.

589
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,500
Keep an eye on her.

590
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:31,010
Report to me if there's anything.

591
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,440
Why is it her again?

592
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:44,790
Instant noodles every day.

593
00:23:44,280 --> 00:23:46,190
[Ba'er Creative]

594
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:45,890
I'm sick of it.

595
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:46,820
Where's En?

596
00:23:46,840 --> 00:23:49,360
Why hasn't she brought back food yet?

597
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,420
So you're thinking about her food from Peony Corporation,

598
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:53,040
right?

599
00:23:54,290 --> 00:23:55,600
You seem to be quite enjoying your food.

600
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,340
You don't look like you want to eat her food.

601
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,480
Don't you want it?

602
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:00,780
Don't you want to have braised pork,

603
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,880
shrimp or ribs in your instant noodles?

604
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:05,880
If you don't want to eat noodles,

605
00:24:05,950 --> 00:24:06,870
just put it down.

606
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,740
Just wait.

607
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,440
Wait for the shrimp, ribs,

608
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:11,300
and pork belly.

609
00:24:11,710 --> 00:24:13,730
But I don't think you can get it today.

610
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:15,260
Why?

611
00:24:15,500 --> 00:24:16,710
En is not coming back today.

612
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,330
She had dinner there tonight.

613
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,220
No way.

614
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,590
En is not that kind of person.

615
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,620
Look at how smart Shi is.

616
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:25,010
She didn't go to Peony Corporation today.

617
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:26,010
Where did she go?

618
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:29,060
She and Mr. Lou went to see Mr. Zhang of Lesifu.

619
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,930
Lesifu?

620
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:33,260
The big chain supermarket?

621
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,960
Yes, it is.

622
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:37,380
Mr. Lou asked En

623
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,330
to serve Mr. Zhang of Lesifu on behalf of Peony Corporation.

624
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,920
Wait. Who did you just say?

625
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:47,180
Mr. Lou.

626
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,460
Do you think there's something going on here?

627
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,370
I think Mr. Lou

628
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,700
must be interested in En.

629
00:24:55,720 --> 00:24:56,840
Otherwise,

630
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,120
would he assign such a good task to her?

631
00:24:58,150 --> 00:24:58,790
Right?

632
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,440
Look at you.

633
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:04,040
What are you thinking?

634
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,350
Eat your noodles.

635
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:06,900
Is that impossible?

636
00:25:07,110 --> 00:25:08,020
Nonsense.

637
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,010
In my opinion,

638
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,140
it's not completely impossible.

639
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:15,100
Right?

640
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,580
Did you find something too?

641
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:19,800
Share with us.

642
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:21,440
You're asking the right person.

643
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:25,160
Dong.

644
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,030
-Hurry up.
-Hello, Mr. Zhang.

645
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:26,870
Get in the car. Hurry.

646
00:25:26,950 --> 00:25:27,660
Go.

647
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:29,890
Be careful.

648
00:25:30,560 --> 00:25:31,160
Okay.

649
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,050
I'm the guard at the entrance of Peony,

650
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,740
the traffic light at the intersection,

651
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:48,240
the doctor at the emergency room,

652
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:49,790
and the ATM on the street

653
00:25:49,820 --> 00:25:52,080
at your service 24 hours a day.

654
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:53,560
8 p.m. tonight,

655
00:25:53,590 --> 00:25:54,870
in the room 806 on the 8th floor

656
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:56,830
of the hotel where you stay.

657
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,190
I promise you will be satisfied.

658
00:25:58,220 --> 00:25:59,130
Great.

659
00:25:59,590 --> 00:26:00,790
Dong really knows

660
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:02,810
how to satisfy a client's needs.

661
00:26:24,680 --> 00:26:25,810
Be gentle.

662
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,350
It's okay.

663
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,850
Dong.

664
00:26:32,730 --> 00:26:34,810
The masseuse you recommended

665
00:26:34,830 --> 00:26:37,110
is really good.

666
00:26:37,350 --> 00:26:38,050
All the masseuses here

667
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:40,450
are professionals with experience of more than 10 years.

668
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:41,670
They're amazing.

669
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,180
Many people come here for a massage

670
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,440
instead of hot spring.

671
00:26:44,610 --> 00:26:45,800
If you like it,

672
00:26:45,820 --> 00:26:47,570
tell me next time. I'll book for you.

673
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,290
That’s great.

674
00:26:51,020 --> 00:26:51,930
By the way, Dong,

675
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:53,760
when did you start working at Peony?

676
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:57,170
Wang used to serve me.

677
00:26:57,810 --> 00:27:00,920
Actually, I'm a customer service representative of an advertising company that works for Mr. Lou.

678
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:04,210
Mr. Wang is on a business trip these days.

679
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:06,350
I'm good at customer service,

680
00:27:06,370 --> 00:27:07,890
so I volunteered to do this.

681
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,240
If there's anything I did that makes you unhappy,

682
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:11,590
just tell me. I'll change.

683
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:13,360
No, no, no.

684
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,990
You did a good job.

685
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,850
I'm just asking.

686
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:20,200
There'll probably be an event in our company soon.

687
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,620
I may need your help

688
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,400
in a few days.

689
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,030
No problem.

690
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,260
It's my pleasure.

691
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:28,310
Call me anytime. I'll at your service 24 hours a day.

692
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:29,940
Great.

693
00:27:39,410 --> 00:27:40,180
Here.

694
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,410
Hi, Hai.

695
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,610
I'm with a client here.

696
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:48,840
Talk to you later.

697
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:51,410
What? Catch?

698
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:55,680
Catch the mistress?

699
00:27:57,010 --> 00:27:58,940
Yes, he's a scumbag.

700
00:27:59,100 --> 00:28:00,800
He came to meet his mistress

701
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,070
at Hot Spring Hotel.

702
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:05,500
Well, he even used the voucher I gave him.

703
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,310
If I hadn't called his colleagues,

704
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:10,860
I would think he's working overtime.

705
00:28:11,130 --> 00:28:12,330
Well, even I have never been to

706
00:28:12,350 --> 00:28:13,640
such a nice hotel.

707
00:28:14,610 --> 00:28:17,330
I happen to meet a client at this hotel.

708
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:18,400
Fine, in my opinion,

709
00:28:18,650 --> 00:28:20,840
don't take it to heart.

710
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:21,900
Don't be mad at him.

711
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:23,550
Calm down.

712
00:28:23,580 --> 00:28:24,490
Wait for me.

713
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:25,930
Okay, I'll wait for you.

714
00:28:27,530 --> 00:28:28,380
Well…

715
00:28:28,410 --> 00:28:30,790
If I don't soak him in the hot spring today,

716
00:28:30,920 --> 00:28:33,220
I'll drink the hot spring water.

717
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:35,820
Wait. Thank you.

718
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:36,820
Mr. Zhang.

719
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,460
I have an emergency.

720
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,290
You keep going.

721
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,070
I've paid the bill.

722
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,990
No, no, no.

723
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:44,010
Wait.

724
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,350
I heard what you said.

725
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,670
I want to go with you.

726
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:51,610
You may be taken advantage of if there are only two girls of you.

727
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:52,890
It's much better with me here.

728
00:28:52,950 --> 00:28:53,590
Well…

729
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:55,170
I don't want to bother you.

730
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:56,170
It's okay.

731
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,150
It's not a big deal.

732
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,950
Good job. I’ll come tomorrow.

733
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,030
Mr. Lou, why are you here?

734
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:05,990
Well…

735
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,390
I’m here for a massage.

736
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,120
Mr. Zhang, are you going to…

737
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,490
Catch the mistress.

738
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:12,660
Catch the mistress?

739
00:29:15,590 --> 00:29:16,390
Alright.

740
00:29:16,410 --> 00:29:17,360
Don't cry.

741
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,060
We're here.

742
00:29:21,290 --> 00:29:22,400
19…

743
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,520
After all, it's your friend’s personal stuff.

744
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,230
Mr. Zhang and I won’t go in.

745
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:30,930
Call us if anything happens.

746
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,140
Okay.

747
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,170
Who is it?

748
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:37,190
Hello, room service.

749
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,780
I didn't call for room service.

750
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:39,900
You came to the wrong room.

751
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,370
Here is the thing.

752
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:43,260
We're having a promotion at the hotel.

753
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,980
We've prepared a bottle of premium wine

754
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,920
for each couple for free.

755
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:49,350
Coming.

756
00:29:55,030 --> 00:29:55,980
It's really you.

757
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,100
Get out of my way!

758
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,810
You scumbag!

759
00:30:00,380 --> 00:30:01,430
Let me see who you are.

760
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:02,250
Who are you?

761
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:04,080
You bastard. How dare you bully her?

762
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:05,210
I'll record this.

763
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,640
Ding Fan, control her.

764
00:30:06,670 --> 00:30:07,740
Give me back my jade gourd!

765
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,100
You stupid jerk!

766
00:30:11,130 --> 00:30:11,820
Don't fight!

767
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:12,800
Scum!

768
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:14,730
I'll record both of you today.

769
00:30:15,470 --> 00:30:16,350
Both of you.

770
00:30:16,350 --> 00:30:17,070
No photos!

771
00:30:17,070 --> 00:30:17,820
No photos!

772
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:18,830
This is a private thing between Wei and me.

773
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:19,590
Put down your phone.

774
00:30:19,610 --> 00:30:20,160
Don't touch me.

775
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:21,030
-Let go of her!
-Go away!

776
00:30:21,370 --> 00:30:22,140
How dare you scold me?

777
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:22,780
Let go!

778
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,560
Are you okay?

779
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,370
Wei, trust me.

780
00:30:32,710 --> 00:30:33,870
It's a misunderstanding.

781
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,900
It was her.

782
00:30:35,190 --> 00:30:36,480
She seduced me first.

783
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:37,870
She's just...

784
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,230
She's just a service station

785
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:41,800
before I arrive at your destination.

786
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,370
I was blinded.

787
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,450
You're the one I love the most, Wei.

788
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:48,220
Ding Fan, what kind of man are you?

789
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:48,810
Wei.

790
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,320
-Wei.
-Don’t touch her.

791
00:30:51,340 --> 00:30:52,050
Scum!

792
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:54,110
Bastard! Go!

793
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:04,660
Alright.

794
00:31:04,690 --> 00:31:06,110
Don't be sad.

795
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,770
How about this? Go back and pack your things.

796
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:12,180
I'll help you move to another place.

797
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:13,720
It's good to leave a scumbag like him

798
00:31:13,740 --> 00:31:16,320
as soon as possible.

799
00:31:17,290 --> 00:31:19,330
Okay, I'll go back now.

800
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:20,620
You don't have to send me back.

801
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:24,060
-Be careful.
-Bye.

802
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,280
Call me when you get home.

803
00:31:32,490 --> 00:31:34,360
Mr. Zhang, I’m really sorry today.

804
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:35,320
Sorry.

805
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,190
We didn't serve you well.

806
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,130
Sorry about that.

807
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:40,860
Don't say so.

808
00:31:41,730 --> 00:31:43,840
I'm happy to do this for my friends.

809
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:44,850
Lou.

810
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:47,910
I'll consider our cooperation seriously.

811
00:31:48,280 --> 00:31:51,080
Peony is a traditional sauce brand in China.

812
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:54,220
It's indeed a brand we're considering seriously.

813
00:31:54,760 --> 00:31:56,040
But this time,

814
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:58,020
we'll be more cautious

815
00:31:58,050 --> 00:32:00,190
about the products in the checkout-free convenience stores,

816
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:01,400
so

817
00:32:01,430 --> 00:32:02,950
we need to assess the comprehensive strengths

818
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,000
of a few companies.

819
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:09,520
I'll give you an answer soon

820
00:32:09,700 --> 00:32:12,140
after I go back to the headquarters.

821
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:14,230
Thank you in advance.

822
00:32:14,550 --> 00:32:16,710
Call me if you need anything.

823
00:32:16,730 --> 00:32:17,910
Don't thank me.

824
00:32:17,950 --> 00:32:19,940
I need to thank En.

825
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,520
She's been with me all day.

826
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:22,490
Thank you.

827
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,170
No, that's what I should do.

828
00:32:24,190 --> 00:32:25,130
It's late.

829
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:26,320
Go back and rest. Bye.

830
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:26,800
Take care.

831
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:27,660
-Okay.
-Bye, Mr. Zhang.

832
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:28,270
Bye.

833
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:30,210
Thank you, Mr. Zhang.

834
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,600
Good night, Mr. Zhang.

835
00:32:36,210 --> 00:32:37,370
You are really something.

836
00:32:37,390 --> 00:32:39,440
You brought our client to catch a mistress?

837
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,030
I'm sorry.

838
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,100
But,

839
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:47,840
thank you for what you did, Mr. Lou.

840
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,800
Mr. Zhang said

841
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:51,830
I should thank you.

842
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,360
Let's go.

843
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:59,890
Can't I come with you next time?

844
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:01,240
I forgot

845
00:33:01,270 --> 00:33:03,150
to call you today…

846
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,590
Why are they...

847
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:09,820
Wait.

848
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:13,620
I found a big gossip.

849
00:33:14,490 --> 00:33:15,440
I'll tell you later.

850
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:21,960
I saw it clearly.

851
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:24,650
They were very close.

852
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:26,520
Who is Mr. Lou?

853
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:27,910
How could he come out of a hotel

854
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,700
with a woman for no reason?

855
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,130
Being together after work

856
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:33,470
doesn't necessarily mean there's something between them.

857
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:34,870
You're too naive.

858
00:33:35,020 --> 00:33:36,140
Too young.

859
00:33:36,430 --> 00:33:38,810
It's a premium hotel.

860
00:33:38,910 --> 00:33:40,810
Their bed is big and soft.

861
00:33:40,830 --> 00:33:42,990
A man and a woman were together

862
00:33:43,020 --> 00:33:44,470
in the same room.

863
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:47,020
There's even more breaking news.

864
00:33:47,110 --> 00:33:48,150
I heard

865
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,540
Cao Ya is Mr. Lou's ex-girlfriend.

866
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,860
Jian knows this.

867
00:33:55,460 --> 00:33:56,810
When the three of them were abroad...

868
00:33:58,310 --> 00:33:59,680
En is here

869
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,610
En, aren't you supposed to be at Ba'er?

870
00:34:01,810 --> 00:34:02,920
I missed you guys,

871
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:04,230
so I've brought some food for you.

872
00:34:04,270 --> 00:34:04,870
Hurry up.

873
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,710
Thank you, En.

874
00:34:06,710 --> 00:34:07,560
You're welcome.

875
00:34:07,900 --> 00:34:09,230
I have something to ask you.

876
00:34:09,250 --> 00:34:11,920
Is the payment of the deposit

877
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:13,830
in progress?

878
00:34:14,030 --> 00:34:15,429
When can it be done?

879
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,380
Our small company

880
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,639
is nothing compared to Peony Corporation.

881
00:34:19,670 --> 00:34:21,590
We're short of money lately.

882
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,389
Understood.

883
00:34:24,010 --> 00:34:25,010
Well, En,

884
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:27,429
Mr. Lou just took office.

885
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:29,630
Our company has been cutting jobs frequently,

886
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:32,080
so the progress has been affected recently.

887
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:34,320
I'm really not sure

888
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,630
when your thing can be done.

889
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,090
Zhu Li.

890
00:34:39,739 --> 00:34:41,420
You really have to help me with this.

891
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:43,330
We're a small company.

892
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:44,500
If the payment is delayed for a month or two,

893
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,250
our company will go bankrupt.

894
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:49,179
Will you bear to see me homeless?

895
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,199
No, it can't be that bad.

896
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:53,000
My hands are tied,

897
00:34:53,110 --> 00:34:54,460
but I suggest

898
00:34:54,489 --> 00:34:56,550
you talk to Mr. Lou

899
00:34:56,810 --> 00:34:58,470
after he comes back from the client

900
00:34:58,870 --> 00:34:59,830
and beg him.

901
00:35:00,530 --> 00:35:01,050
Okay.

902
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,220
I'll call him later.

903
00:35:03,860 --> 00:35:04,540
Good luck.

904
00:35:04,570 --> 00:35:05,650
Go and eat.

905
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,050
Enjoy yourselves.

906
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:08,550
-Thank you, En.
-Bye.

907
00:35:08,550 --> 00:35:09,270
It's delicious.

908
00:35:09,270 --> 00:35:10,310
-Not bad.
-Thank you.

909
00:35:10,310 --> 00:35:11,070
-Bye.
-Thank you.

910
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,080
Did you hear that?

911
00:35:14,830 --> 00:35:17,200
An employee from a service provider

912
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,900
dares disturb Mr. Lou at night.

913
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:20,520
What else could it be if there's nothing between them?

914
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:22,230
In my opinion,

915
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,110
Dong Dong'en

916
00:35:24,140 --> 00:35:25,820
is more likely than Cao Ya.

917
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,530
No.

918
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:28,920
Mr. Lou

919
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:31,260
terminated contracts with so many companies.

920
00:35:31,610 --> 00:35:32,890
How could they survive

921
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:34,630
and send someone to our company?

922
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,220
I don't think

923
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:38,420
Dong Dong'en

924
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:40,360
is that simple.

925
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,950
You're not that simple, too.

926
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:45,070
How come you saw this kind of thing?

927
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:46,380
It's so exciting.

928
00:35:46,870 --> 00:35:47,360
I...

929
00:36:00,220 --> 00:36:01,340
The color is bright.

930
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:02,800
It's also spicy enough

931
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:04,430
to cover the taste of beef.

932
00:36:04,460 --> 00:36:05,500
I think it's good.

933
00:36:05,940 --> 00:36:06,620
Of course.

934
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:09,160
Our chili is very famous.

935
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,550
Nothing can compare to them.

936
00:36:11,740 --> 00:36:12,650
Sir, look.

937
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,150
We need a lot of chili.

938
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,980
I wonder how much…

939
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:20,640
The market price is three yuan.

940
00:36:20,910 --> 00:36:21,970
I'll sell them to you at 2.8 yuan.

941
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:22,780
What do you think?

942
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:23,680
A good price, huh?

943
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:28,190
We've visited many suppliers.

944
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:29,560
Your price

945
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:31,150
is not that good.

946
00:36:31,470 --> 00:36:32,140
Sir.

947
00:36:32,620 --> 00:36:34,920
You must have heard of Peony Corporation.

948
00:36:34,940 --> 00:36:36,470
I don't think I need to introduce it to you.

949
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:37,990
In our company,

950
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,670
we value raw materials the most for our sauce.

951
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,630
The suppliers we've worked with

952
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,260
are all well-known in the industry.

953
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,320
Sir, look.

954
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,550
Working with us

955
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:48,250
is not only about making money.

956
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:49,860
Don't limit your vision.

957
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:51,330
You need to open your mind.

958
00:36:51,470 --> 00:36:52,660
Think further.

959
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:55,180
Think about it.

960
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,330
Okay.

961
00:36:57,150 --> 00:36:58,400
Since it's our first cooperation,

962
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,260
I'll lower the price for you.

963
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,320
2.6 yuan.

964
00:37:01,350 --> 00:37:03,060
I'll lose money if it's lower.

965
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:04,280
2.6 yuan?

966
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,580
Okay.

967
00:37:05,610 --> 00:37:06,490
Deal.

968
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:08,120
Deal.

969
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:08,670
Thank you, sir.

970
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:10,010
-Okay. I'm looking forward to our cooperation.
-Thank you.

971
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,190
Mr. Lou.

972
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,330
Can you talk now?

973
00:37:16,030 --> 00:37:17,060
Yes. Go ahead.

974
00:37:18,590 --> 00:37:21,060
Don't you like pastries from Yue's Pastry?

975
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,530
I'll bring some to you tomorrow.

976
00:37:23,330 --> 00:37:24,470
Thank you.

977
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:25,820
Are you in any trouble?

978
00:37:26,890 --> 00:37:28,900
I just missed you.

979
00:37:28,930 --> 00:37:31,210
After all, it's rare to find

980
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:33,240
a good client like you.

981
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,690
If there's nothing else,

982
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,100
I have to go now.

983
00:37:38,630 --> 00:37:41,390
Well, I do need your help.

984
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:42,770
What is it?

985
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,970
Just get to the point.

986
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:45,160
Here's the thing.

987
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,280
We have started

988
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,070
working on the ad proposal.

989
00:37:48,390 --> 00:37:49,460
But as you know,

990
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,930
we are a small company.

991
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,630
We have some funding issues,

992
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:57,630
so I want to ask you

993
00:37:57,710 --> 00:37:58,950
if you can speed up the payment process.

994
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:00,480
Just for this?

995
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:01,600
No, no, no.

996
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,530
Of course I called because I care about you.

997
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,600
I'm not rushing you.

998
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:07,580
The company has its procedures.

999
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,530
If you're in a hurry, go push them yourself.

1000
00:38:10,780 --> 00:38:11,700
I have to run if there's nothing else.

1001
00:38:14,240 --> 00:38:16,340
He asked me to rush myself.

1002
00:38:17,190 --> 00:38:18,070
En.

1003
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:20,610
Mr. Lou is giving you a privilege.

1004
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:23,600
Ba'er is counting on you.

1005
00:38:26,750 --> 00:38:27,620
En.

1006
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,300
Don't let him see

1007
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:31,720
the alias you gave him.

1008
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:32,630
Don't worry.

1009
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:34,510
Don't you trust me?

1010
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,550
[Iron Rascal]

1011
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:42,880
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
