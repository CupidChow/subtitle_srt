happily and harmoniously as client and supplier

191
00:07:27,510 --> 00:07:28,810
just like we did before.

192
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:33,700
As client and supplier?

193
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:36,760
Don't misunderstand me.

194
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,980
I really have an appointment.

195
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:41,720
If she says no, it means yes.

196
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,080
If she says she doesn't want it, it means she wants it.

197
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:45,580
She said no to you.

198
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:47,130
Why? She was testing you.

199
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,900
Then you have to pester her.

200
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:52,020
Anyway, just remember this word, pester.

201
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,290
If there's nothing else, I'll go out.

202
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,980
Yes.

203
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:56,300
Of course there's something else.

204
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,480
Two directors are not enough.

205
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,810
This is the first advertisement

206
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,640
for our Peony's new sources.

207
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,310
Two directors are not enough for me to choose.

208
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,250
Since you want me to make a choice, you need to find more candidates for me.

209
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:08,220
Bring the list to me after you get it ready.

210
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,280
Okay.

211
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:13,010
We'll screen them inside our team again.

212
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,890
I'll go out now.

213
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:15,510
Go.

214
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:20,970
Wait.

215

Put down your bag.

216
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:49,660
Go.

Hello, everyone. I'm Hai.

There will be an event for our shop's anniversary today.

We've brought you a lot of clothes.

229

Why isn't she picking up the phone?

230
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,380
What should I do with this?

231
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:42,900

Thank you so much.

234
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,100
I called my best friend just now

235
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:50,180
to ask her to send me clothes.

236
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,820
Don't thank me. It's Mr. Lou's idea.

237
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,070
He also said that

238
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,550
you don't need to worry about the proposal.

239
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,140
You two can discuss it after he reads the directors' profiles.

240
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,400
Get changed at once. Call me if you need anything.

Bye.

Are you and Mr. Wang

244
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:24,420
going to have a lunch date tomorrow?

245
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:26,950
Don't tell me that

246
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:29,090
you still want to give it a try with him now?

247
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,730
He has a crush on someone else now.

248
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,300
He knows and I know.

249
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:36,620
How can we give it a try?

250
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:42,050
However, seeing him feel bad now,

251
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,740
I feel bad, too.

252
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,620
It's okay. It's just a man.

00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,330
It's no big deal.

Anyway,

255
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:53,420
As you feel disappointed in love, I'll stay with you and go shopping with you.

256

This is Cao Ya' skirt.

Now you're so poor that you stole others' clothes?

372
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,500
What?

00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:11,060
I was having a period.

376
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:14,260
My pants got dirty, and Mr. Lou saw it.

377
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,780
It's nothing.

378
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:18,780
If he had not helped you,

379
00:15:18,780 --> 00:15:20,380
it would have meant his moral character was bad.

380
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,960
He was quite considerate.

381
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,470
He even helped you borrow a skirt.

382
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,460
It has made me have a better impression on him.

383
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,220
What else could he do?

384
00:15:27,220 --> 00:15:29,380
Would he just let me spill my blood in my client's company?

385
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,180
Besides,

386
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:31,940
he just did something

387
00:15:31,940 --> 00:15:32,980
which a normal person would do.

388
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,940
But I didn't do

389
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:36,940
what a qualified supplier should do.

390
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:39,740
Today, I couldn't even

391
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,190
butter up my clients well.

392
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:42,560
Let me tell you.

393
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:44,260
I've seen this movie plot before.

394
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,380
As the saying goes,

395
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,060
the truth which is contrary to your prejudgement might be late,

396
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:50,520
but it'll never be absent.

397
00:15:58,260 --> 00:15:59,620
This is the famous snack shop

398
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,700
I've found in the list of delicious food.

399
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,200
What do you want to eat?

400
00:16:02,620 --> 00:16:04,220
I'll eat them with you tomorrow.

401
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:09,550
Didn't we agree to do it step by step?

402
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:12,230
Let's start from the first restaurant.

403
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:17,490
It's okay.

404
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:19,940
Since I've made up my mind,

405
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,360
I will try to change myself for you.

406
00:16:22,900 --> 00:16:24,620
I'll go out with you to have fun,

407
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,310
travel to a lively place,

408
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,920
and go shopping with you to buy clothes.

409
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,660
This time, I will become

410
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,300
the boyfriend you've imagined.

411
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:36,900
Ma Chengshu.

412
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,390
How about I move to your house to stay with you for your treatment?

413
00:16:40,260 --> 00:16:43,410
I want to stay with you when you try to overcome this disease.

414
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:46,440
Let's work hard together, okay?

415
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,300
Ma Chengshu.

416
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,870
How about I move to your house to stay with you for your treatment?

417
00:16:53,890 --> 00:16:56,900
I want to stay with you when you try to overcome this disease.

418
00:16:57,520 --> 00:16:59,920
Let's work hard together, okay?

419
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:02,540
[Hai]

420
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,560
[Okay]

421
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:11,040
[Ma Chengshu]

422
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:07,740
Okay.

423
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:13,420
Yes!

424
00:17:32,970 --> 00:17:34,570
Because you like him.

425
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:36,300
You want to try to

426
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:38,140
look like a lady

427
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,100
in front of him.

428
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,100
Mr. Lou.

429
00:17:59,050 --> 00:18:00,030
He's asleep.

430
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,230
Mr. Lou.

431
00:18:36,890 --> 00:18:37,710
Mr. Lou.

432
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,540
Let me sleep a little longer.

433
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:13,760
En.

434
00:19:14,950 --> 00:19:15,550
Well...

435
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,930
I'm sorry.

436
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:19,340
I thought

437
00:19:19,340 --> 00:19:20,260
I was still dreaming.

438
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,640
It's okay.

439
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:28,540
I was watching Director Xue's movie.

440
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:30,170
I remember I was watching this scene before I was asleep.

441
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,320
Is it a dead halt?

442
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:33,150
This movie is just like this.

443
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,520
A scene lasts for a long time.

444
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:38,120
By the way,

445
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:41,020
this is the skirt which you borrowed for me yesterday.

446
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,150
I've washed it.

447
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:42,980
Thank you.

448
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:45,290
You're welcome.

449
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,100
You're welcome.

450
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:52,740
By the way,

451
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:54,110
let's choose Director Xue

452
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:55,260
for the advertisement.

453
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:55,990
It's him.

454
00:19:56,670 --> 00:19:58,950
You chose Director Xue? Aren't you going to consider other directors?

455
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,810
I've watched his previous works.

456
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:01,970
I think they are good.

457
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,490
He has his own ideas and style.

458
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:04,420
He is very suitable for us.

459
00:20:05,290 --> 00:20:07,300
I've finished watching the movie,

460
00:20:07,330 --> 00:20:09,210
thought I fell asleep in the middle several times.

461
00:20:09,450 --> 00:20:10,960
However, as you said,

462
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:13,170
he has his own ideas and style

463
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,630
for film shooting indeed.

464
00:20:16,560 --> 00:20:19,000
This is a shooting plan I've made.

465
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:19,910
Please read it.

466
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:22,470
It contains our shooting duration,

467
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,650
and the fees of the staff

468
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,740
and machines.

469
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:26,660
I can read it myself.

470
00:20:27,020 --> 00:20:28,260
What's wrong?

471
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,350
Is Mr. Lou still angry?

472
00:20:33,630 --> 00:20:34,960
Why haven't you decided on the shooting location?

473
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,620
We want to discuss with the director

474
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,630
after you choose the director.

475
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:39,260
That's good.

476
00:20:39,420 --> 00:20:40,900
Let's discuss it with the director.

477
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,540
Besides, take our requirements for reference only.

478
00:20:43,680 --> 00:20:45,300
You can go to Dahai for the approval of the cost.

479
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:48,150
Go on working on the details of the shooting.

480
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:53,380
Okay.

481
00:20:54,170 --> 00:20:55,120
If there's nothing else,

482
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,170
go back first.

483
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:06,980
Mr. Lou.

484
00:21:07,090 --> 00:21:09,070
I still want to thank you for your kindness yesterday.

485
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:11,960
My mood has been unstable lately.

486
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:14,100
Please forgive me.

487
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:16,420
Besides, I will personally supervise

488
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:18,040
this advertisment plan.

489
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:20,580
We'll make a perfect work

490
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,200
and live up to your expectations.

491
00:21:23,900 --> 00:21:24,500
Okay.

492
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:25,620
Get back to work.

493
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:43,470
It's her menstrual period indeed.

494
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:45,030
Menstrual period.

495
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:47,310
Always say yes to her.

496
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,000
Always say yes to her.

497
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:54,260
[TRIANGLE]

498
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,660
Advertisement shooting?

499
00:21:57,310 --> 00:21:58,900
Think of a way to destroy it.

500
00:21:58,970 --> 00:22:00,210
You can use any way.

501
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,410
But if I'm exposed...

502
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,230
The soldier has been trained for a long time.

503
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:07,630
I've planted you in the Peony Corporation for so long.

504
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,080
I haven't asked you to do anything.

505
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,020
As long as you don't do anything stupid,

506
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,310
it'll be hard for you to get exposed, right?

507
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:14,120
Okay. I got it.

508
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,060
Then this time...

509
00:22:15,060 --> 00:22:16,540
I'll transfer the money to you.

510
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:21,400
What a useless idiot.

511
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,300
All he cares about is money.

512
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,900
Yuan.

513
00:22:28,350 --> 00:22:30,630
Have you been influenced by something recently?

514
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:33,100
You've removed the company's surveillance equipment,

515
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:34,810
and adjusted the vacation system.

516
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,330
You're just different after spring has come.

517
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,320
If you have the time,

518
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,260
you should worry about yourself.

519
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,090
Doesn't Mr. Wang have the nickname of White Dragon in the Waves?

520
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,140
Why are you always

521
00:22:45,160 --> 00:22:46,520
jealous of the intern?

522
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:47,890
What are you talking about?

523
00:22:47,940 --> 00:22:50,310
Who's jealous of that intern?

524
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,340
You...

525
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:52,820
I mean, you can't

526
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,100
slander me!

527
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:55,700
I... I... I...

528
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,950
How did you know?

529
00:23:00,450 --> 00:23:02,500
It's not my first day meeting you and Cao Ya.

530
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,020
Besides,

531
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:05,180
Cao Ya

532
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,780
didn't plan to hide it from me from the beginning.

533
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:11,870
I just feel a bit guilty for you.

534
00:23:12,230 --> 00:23:13,220
Besides, she doesn't want to

535
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:14,660
regard me as her boyfriend.

536
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:16,580
I have nothing to say about it.

537
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,560
Why doesn't she regard you as her boyfriend?

538
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:19,860
I told her that

539
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:21,620
maybe we should be together.

540
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:22,860
But she rejected me directly.

541
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,980
I think we are a very good match in all aspects, including the feelings.

542
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,120
The feelings are quite right.

543
00:23:27,740 --> 00:23:30,100
Why can't we become boyfriend and girlfriend?

544
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,000
Why do these words sound so familiar?

545
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,960
Is it because

546
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:38,070
I'm not proactive enough?

547
00:23:38,650 --> 00:23:39,250
No.

548
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:40,900
Is it because

549
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:43,090
I'm not excellent enough?

550
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,100
No.

551
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:47,570
Then is it because

552
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:50,660
my power as a boyfriend isn't strong enough?

553
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
It's hard to say.

554
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:56,230
As a girl, Cao Ya

555
00:23:56,580 --> 00:23:58,460
looks tough

556
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,420
and invincible.

557
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:00,600
However,

558
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,460
maybe you can use

559
00:24:02,460 --> 00:24:03,350
a soft

560
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:05,630
and gentle way to treat her.

561
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:06,560
It might be effective.

562
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:09,770
Soft?

563
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:11,340
Gentle?

564

I just...

565
00:24:12,790 --> 00:24:13,400
Alright.

566
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:16,070
The master may teach, but progress is up to the hard work of the apprentice.

567
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,980
Besides, the stick is too thin.

568
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,250
You need to replace it with a better one.

569
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:24,050
Didn't you feel comfortable while you were holding it just now?

570
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:25,430
This is so troublesome.

571
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,390
You're so demanding.

572

Be gentle?

573
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:32,170
I have to be gentle?

574
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:37,900
Xingyun Village?

575
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,660
Do you think it is

576
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,950
too simple there?

577
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,590
You know that village?

578
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:45,940
I grew up there.

579
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:47,090
I know tha place well.

580
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,430
What a coincidence.

581
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:49,830
I once went there to shoot some scenes for my movies.

582
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:52,140
The view in the village is perfect for this advertisement.

583
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,540
Okay.

584
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,940
Director, if you think the location should be there,

585
00:24:54,940 --> 00:24:56,270
then let's shoot the advertisement there.

586
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,100
Director, let me tell you secretly.

587
00:24:58,100 --> 00:24:59,740
Mr. Lou doesn't allow me to tell you

588
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,100
in case you should feel embarrassed.

589
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:03,320
He has watched your movie, Naughty Child,

590
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:04,870
for many times.

591
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,460
He feels very touched.

592
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,500
I knew Mr. Lou has artistic pursuit.

593
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:11,430
He's different from those rich guys who have no taste.

594
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:12,960
Therefore,

595
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,510
we must shoot this advertisement well

596
00:25:15,530 --> 00:25:17,120
so that we can have more chances to work together in the future.

597
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:19,530
Don't worry. I'll do my best.

598
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:22,100
When your new movie is released,

599
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,660
our company will definitely make a block booking.

600
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:25,100

What is it?

605

I've decided to live with Ma Chengshu.

606

You know what?

608
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:42,180
For me,

609
00:25:42,300 --> 00:25:45,220
he has decided to go shopping in a dirty street where there are many people.

610
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:45,860
So,

611
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:47,340
I want to stay with him

612
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:48,990
when he tries to overcome mysophobia.

613
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:52,710
I mean, for your sake,

614
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,260
Shi has really mustered up all his courage.

615
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,930
We've known each other for so many years.

616
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,500
He has never eaten with us at a street stall.

617
00:25:58,610 --> 00:25:59,320
Right.

618
00:25:59,830 --> 00:26:02,520
Besides, both of us have no sense of security.

619
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,160
We have similar personalities, too. We get angry easily.

620
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,020
So,

621
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,260
I think if we live together, it's a good way to go through the adjustment period.

622
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:09,980
Good.

623
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,040
If you live togther,

624
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,250
you can get to know each other and go through the adjustment period.

625
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:13,860
It's good.

748
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:43,680
The shooting will be delayed because of this.

749
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,300
Director, why don't you wait in the car?

750
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,450
I'll go make a call.

751
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:47,450
Hurry up and repair it.

752
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:48,610
It's a waste of time.

753
00:31:04,660 --> 00:31:05,430
En!

754
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:06,820
En!

755
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:09,050
Get into the car. Don't catch a cold.

756
00:31:09,390 --> 00:31:11,180
There's no signal here. I'll go make a call

757
00:31:11,220 --> 00:31:12,380
and find the signal.

758
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:12,980
Okay.

759
00:31:47,950 --> 00:31:49,590
Hello, buddy.

760
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,330
Our car broke down halfway.

761
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:53,070
Can you come to pick us up?

762
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:55,380
We're at Xingfu Road.

763
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,180
Go a little forward and you'll see us.

764
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,100
[Musn't dump muck within the jurisdiction of the Shanquan Town. Those who violate this rule will be punished severely according to the law.]

765
00:32:26,390 --> 00:32:27,320
[Musn't dump muck within the jurisdiction of the Shanquan Town. Those who violate this rule will be punished severely according to the law.]

766
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,620
En!

767
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:32,860
En!

768
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,020
How are you?

769
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,260
Are you hurt?

770
00:32:38,310 --> 00:32:38,820
Come on.

771
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:53,090
[Musn't dump muck within the jurisdiction of the Shanquan Town. Those who violate this rule will be punished severely according to the law.]

772
00:33:00,850 --> 00:33:03,740
[Musn't dump muck within the jurisdiction of the Shanquan Town. Those who violate this rule will be punished severely according to the law.]

773
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:09,700
Here you are. A towel.

774
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,640
Wipe yourself first.

775
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:12,580
Thank you.

776
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:14,930
There's a new jacket in the bag next to you.

777
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:16,690
Get changed with it. Don't catch a cold.

778
00:33:17,580 --> 00:33:18,620
It's my mom's jacket.

779
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,030
It might not fit.

780
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:24,100
You should get changed first.

781
00:33:24,120 --> 00:33:25,230
I'm getting out of the car.

782
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,280
It's still raining outside.

783
00:33:29,930 --> 00:33:30,970
It's okay.

784
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:40,940
Alright.

785
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:49,920
In the future,

786
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:51,270
if you encounter this situation again,

787
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,200
don't rush forward by yourself foolishly.

788
00:33:53,350 --> 00:33:54,540
Safety is the most important thing.

789
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:59,180
I didn't mean to go to dangerous places.

790
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,630
The car broke down,

791
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,550
so I asked someone to come and help.

792
00:34:04,590 --> 00:34:06,210
Why didn't you contact me immediately?

793
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,850
I called you as soon as it happened,

794
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,780
but your phone line was busy,

795
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,679
so I asked a villager to come here.

796
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:18,409
Actually,

797
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,389
you were the first person I thought of.

798
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,000
That's why I'm here.

799
00:34:49,469 --> 00:34:53,070
[Musn't dump muck within the jurisdiction of the Shanquan Town. Those who violate this rule will be punished severely according to the law.]

800
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,340
Hello, En.

801
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:55,510
Where are you?

802
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,200
It's raining heavily. It's very dangerous.

803
00:34:57,250 --> 00:34:58,040
Director Xue.

804
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:59,980
I went to find the signal for my mobile phone.

805
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,030
I ran a little far.

806
00:35:01,130 --> 00:35:02,130
Don't worry.

807
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:03,420
Mr. Lou is here.

808
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,320
I'm in his car.

809
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,410
You can go first.

810
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:06,460
Mr. Lou is here.

811
00:35:06,790 --> 00:35:07,540
Okay.

812
00:35:07,540 --> 00:35:08,510
We'll leave first.

813
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:09,370
Okay.

814
00:35:10,050 --> 00:35:10,590
Let's go.

815
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:33,260
Have you been waiting for a long time?

816
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:33,740
It's okay.

817
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:34,780
Just give me your luggage.

818
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:35,500
Just give it to me.

819
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:36,340
Have a seat.

820
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:36,930
Sit.

821
00:35:36,980 --> 00:35:37,540
Come on.

822
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,210
Sit here.

823
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:40,150
Come on. Change into the slippers.

824
00:35:40,830 --> 00:35:41,390
Okay.

825
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:42,170
Come on.

826
00:35:42,500 --> 00:35:43,180
I can do it myself.

827
00:35:43,180 --> 00:35:44,140
It's okay. Let me do it.

828
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:48,380
Alright.

829
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,020
Disinfect your hands.

830
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,490
I'll disinfect myself, too.

831
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:56,580
Okay.

832
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,430
After we have dinner,

833
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,580
you can take a shower and have a rest.

834
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:02,930
Be careful not to catch a cold.

835
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:04,020
I'll unpack

836
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:05,660
your luggage with you tonight.

837
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,900
Then I'll have to rely on Mr. Ma, the master of

838
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,780
organizing things to put my belongings in order.

839
00:36:10,080 --> 00:36:10,870
Leave it to me.

840
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:11,450
Come on.

841
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,020
Taste the food.

842
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:17,730
Eat this.

843
00:36:17,860 --> 00:36:18,500
How is it?

844
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,420
It's delicious.

845
00:36:21,770 --> 00:36:23,300
By the way, that's all

846
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,100
for your luggage?

847
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,110
It's less than I thought.

848
00:36:27,010 --> 00:36:27,940
This time, En and I discarded

849
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,660
many things decisively.

850
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,830
We just keep the most important things.

851
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:34,090
Some things are not indispensable for me.

852
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,010
Even if they were with me, I wasn't very happy.

853
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,360
Now the most important thing is that

854
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,810
you're by my side, and that's enough for me.

855
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,220
Alright.

856
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:43,180
Just eat. The food is getting cold.

857
00:36:44,630 --> 00:36:45,760
Right. Wait a moment.

858
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:50,530
Come on.

859
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,880
Let's celebrate

860
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:55,380
our first meal after we started to live together.

861
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,510
Come on. Cheers.

862
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,020
I'll wash the dishes after dinner.

863
00:36:59,530 --> 00:37:00,210
Okay.

864
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:00,880
No.

865
00:37:01,710 --> 00:37:03,530
I'll do all the housework.

866
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:07,420
Then at least let me put the bowls in the sink.

867
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,040
Okay.

868
00:37:15,470 --> 00:37:16,190
Excuse me.

869
00:37:21,670 --> 00:37:22,800
I'll be careful.

870
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,360
Okay.

871
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,130
Well,

872
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:30,750
En must be tired when she shoots the advertisement

873
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,230
in the Xingyun Village.

874
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,300
Don't worry.

875
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:33,860
With her ability,

876
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:35,300
she'll definitely take good care of herself.

877
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,080
I like this, too.

878
00:37:37,570 --> 00:37:38,920
Eat more if you like it.

879
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,390
Be careful.

880
00:37:40,740 --> 00:37:42,300
Our threshold is high.

881
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,850
Look at my house.

882
00:37:43,870 --> 00:37:45,480
We haven't lived here for a long time.

883
00:37:45,510 --> 00:37:47,000
My son and daughter-in-law

884
00:37:47,030 --> 00:37:48,500
has bought a house in the downtown.

885
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,680
This house is vacant now.

886
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,990
In these two years, hasn't it been the trend to do

887
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,560
the guesthouse business?

888
00:37:54,910 --> 00:37:56,020
That's why

889
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,260
I thought about getting the supply of

890
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,570
water and electricity back.

891
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:01,120
You can cook here,

892
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,320
and there's access to the Internet.

893
00:38:02,350 --> 00:38:03,350
Not bad, right?

894
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:05,230
It's good.

895
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,280
This room

896
00:38:06,340 --> 00:38:07,910
is clean.

897
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,430
But there's only one room.

898
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:11,890
It's hard to arrange accommodation.

899
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:15,020
How many blankets are there?

900
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:17,170
Six or seven.

901
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:18,630
There are many of you, right?

902
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:20,870
Can you all sleep on a wide bed?

903
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,060
Yes, we can.

904
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,500
Should I ask Mr. Lou

905
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:27,540
to sleep on the wide bed with us?

906
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:29,700
Hello, Zhu Li.

907
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:30,240
It's me.

908
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,540
Let Mr. Wang host

909
00:38:31,540 --> 00:38:32,820
tonight's meeting.

910
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:33,980
The Internet connection is not good here.

911
00:38:33,980 --> 00:38:34,900
I might not be able to participate.

912
00:38:36,610 --> 00:38:37,140
It's okay.

913
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:38,170
I'll go back as usual tomorrow.

914
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:38,930
Don't worry.

915
00:38:39,850 --> 00:38:40,730
Okay. That's all.

916
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:43,220
Mr. Lou!

917
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:45,660
Is Dong inside?

918
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:46,960
Yes.

919
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,060
Go inside.

920
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:49,820
It's cold outside.

921
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:50,520
Okay.

922
00:38:59,550 --> 00:39:01,820
Mr. Lou left in the middle of the meeting.

923
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,370
Did he go to look for Dong Dong'en?

924
00:39:08,050 --> 00:39:12,290
[Xingyun Village]

925
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,050
Be careful.

926
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:24,480
Thank you.

927
00:39:27,240 --> 00:39:27,980
You should have a rest.

928
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,410
Not bad. It's good.

929
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,990
En.

930
00:39:33,860 --> 00:39:34,980
The rain has stopped,

931
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:36,740
but there's no daylight.

932
00:39:37,030 --> 00:39:38,380
We can't shoot the advertisement today anyway.

933
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:40,500
Later, let's inform everyone to rest early.

934
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,690
We'll start working early tomorrow.

935
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,020
It has stopped now.

936
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,810
It'll still rain later.

937
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:45,990
It'll still rain?

938
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:46,950
Yes.

939
00:39:47,270 --> 00:39:49,240
Is the rain here so unpredictable?

940
00:39:49,430 --> 00:39:50,540
It can rain so suddenly.

941
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,710
It can rain intermittently for many days.

942
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,570
No.

943
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,140
If it keeps raining like this,

944
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:55,580
can I

945
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,000
start shooting the advertisement?

946
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:58,730
En.

947
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:00,850
Why don't we revise the shooting plan now?

948
00:40:01,020 --> 00:40:01,620
Don't worry.

949
00:40:01,650 --> 00:40:03,220
I'll still get the effect you want.

950
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,240
Okay. Thanks for your hard work.

951
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:08,300
Whether it's sunny or rainy tomorrow,

952
00:40:08,320 --> 00:40:10,110
we can't delay any further.

953
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:10,780
That's right.

954
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,090
Alright. I shouldn't be idle here.

955
00:40:12,220 --> 00:40:13,620
I'll go find those several leading creators

956
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,300
and discuss it with them.

957
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:15,740
Okay. Thank you, Director.

958
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:16,680
It's not easy for both of us.

959
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:18,630
Miss,

960
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:20,460
I'll give you a military coat so that you can wear it.

961
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:21,810
It's cold outside.

962
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:22,640
Don't catch a cold.

963
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,110
Thank you.

964
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:24,810
You're welcome.

965
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:47,340
What if someone dies?

966
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,610
Don't go too far.

967
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:50,750
Otherwise, you'll bring trouble to yourself.

968
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,230
Mr. Su, I just wanted to scare her.

969
00:40:53,250 --> 00:40:53,930
Enough!

970
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,110
From now on, you're only responsible for prying into information.

971
00:40:59,510 --> 00:41:01,400
Don't make decisions on other things without my permission.

972
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:04,000
Send me their shooting plan.

973
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:05,070
Okay.

974
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,620
You're too kind. One is enough.

975
00:41:13,620 --> 00:41:14,540
One is enough.

976
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:16,220
-Come on. Put it on. -Put it on.

977
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,220
Alright. Okay.

978
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:18,420
I have more if it's not enough.

979
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:19,180
Okay.

980
00:41:19,180 --> 00:41:20,820
You haven't eaten yet, right? Go to my home to have dinner.

981
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:21,780
It's okay, Ma'am.

982
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:22,450
Does it fit?

983
00:41:22,450 --> 00:41:23,460
Yes, it does.

984
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,120
I'll

985
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,700
-take the blanket and this... -Here you are.

986
00:41:25,820 --> 00:41:27,620
quilted coat, and I have to send these things to them right now.

987
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:28,820
Lou. Lou.

988
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,740
Don't go.

989
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,230
Are you married?

990
00:41:31,350 --> 00:41:32,990
I have a cousin who looks very pretty.

991
00:41:33,110 --> 00:41:34,280
Why don't you come to my home for dinner tonight?

992
00:41:34,310 --> 00:41:35,260
Let me introduce you to each other.

993
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:36,020
No, Ma'am.

994
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:36,900
Lou!

995
00:41:38,930 --> 00:41:41,120
Are you cold? Put it on at once.

996
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:42,980
I've brought you a coat specially.

997
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:43,940
-Don't catch a cold. -Miss.

998
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,140
Are you his wife?

999
00:41:45,140 --> 00:41:45,900
I'm here to save you.

1000
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:46,460
I knew it.

1001
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:47,420
It's impossible that such a good young man

1002
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:48,820
is not married yet.

1003
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,460
Have you seen the things he's carrying?

1004
00:41:50,530 --> 00:41:51,740
They are all prepared for you.

1005
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:52,210
Yes.

1006
00:41:52,230 --> 00:41:54,350
-Right. -Right. -Right.

1007
00:41:54,380 --> 00:41:56,190
-Don't catch a cold. -It’s cold. He's afraid that you'll catch a cold.

1008
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,460
He borrowed all these things for you.

1009
00:41:58,460 --> 00:41:59,780
-He cares about you. -Your husband

1010
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:01,230
is very considerate.

1011
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,250
She is usually busy with work,

1012
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:03,990
and it's very tiring for her.

1013
00:42:04,860 --> 00:42:06,500
Just say it directly if you care about your wife.

1014
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,010
No one will laugh at you.

1015
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,690
They are a couple.

1016
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:11,860
It's right for him to care about his wife like this.

1017
00:42:11,890 --> 00:42:12,640
That's right.

1018
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:14,590
New bride, do you care about him?

1019
00:42:14,710 --> 00:42:15,780
Of course.

1020
00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:17,660
Are you shy?

1021
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:18,480
-Well... -She's shy.

1022
00:42:18,510 --> 00:42:21,070
My dear Lou is very nice

1023
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:22,100
and very kind.

1024
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,390
He's also very considerate and knows how to take care of others.

1025
00:42:24,570 --> 00:42:25,850
Besides, he's simple.

1026
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:26,580
He's very good

1027
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:29,850
from the tips of his hair to his heels.

1028
00:42:30,240 --> 00:42:31,190
Madams, well...

1029
00:42:31,460 --> 00:42:32,910
Thank you. We have to go.

1030
00:42:33,110 --> 00:42:33,950
See you. Thank you.

1031
00:42:33,980 --> 00:42:35,290
Carry the things steadily. Take care.

1032
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,340
-You're welcome. -Come and get more if it's not enough.

1033
00:42:38,220 --> 00:42:39,730
Tell me if you need anything else.

1034
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,250
-It's okay. -Be careful.

1035
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:41,700
Be careful.

1036
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,140
I'm fine.

1037
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:42,860
-Thank you. -The road is slippery.

1038
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:43,820
-Okay. -The road is slippery.

1039
00:42:43,820 --> 00:42:45,700
It's okay. I'll take care of him.

1040
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:46,380
Be careful.

1041
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:47,820
Tell me if you need anything else.

1042
00:42:47,820 --> 00:42:48,500
Okay, Madams. Thank you.

1043
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,770
If you need anything, just come and get it.

1044
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:53,350
Dong Dong'en, you're really something.

1045
00:42:53,530 --> 00:42:55,580
You were so good at praising me.

1046
00:42:56,310 --> 00:42:57,830
That's what I should do.

1047
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,170
You're still laughing?

1048
00:43:02,710 --> 00:43:03,300
You're still laughing?

1049
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:05,760
I'll stop laughing. Let me tell you.

1050
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,080
Mr. Lou, you know what?

1051
00:43:07,190 --> 00:43:09,470
This military coat and this jacket with floral patterns

1052
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:10,580
suit you well while you're wearing them.

1053
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:12,490
They suit me well?

1054
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:13,700
It's true.

1055
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:14,910
Look.

1056
00:43:15,700 --> 00:43:18,410
It looks the most beautiful to match red with green.

1057
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:21,630
You are like the most beautiful scenery

1058
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,190
in the Xingyun Village.

1059
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,580
♫Diamonds are shiny♫

1060
00:43:27,900 --> 00:43:31,050
♫They're like the most beautiful stars in the sky♫

1061
00:43:31,260 --> 00:43:32,460
Dong Dong'en.

1062
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,820
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
