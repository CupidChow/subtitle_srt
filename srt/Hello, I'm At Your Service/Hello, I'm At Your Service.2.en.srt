47
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:03,880
Why did you suddenly talk about terminating the contract?

48
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,320
Could it be that you don't know

49
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:06,830
our Ba'er company very well?

50
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:08,890
I've checked all the previous cases

56
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,840
The business scope of your company is really wide.

57

But for now,

58

your advertisements

59
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:27,870
are basically in a very simple form,

60
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:29,460
and the content is full of platitudes.

61
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,730

62
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:32,220
increase in the acutal benefit to the advertisers,

63
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:35,000

No, Mr. Lou.

65

Fine.

68
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:43,079
Let's talk about the advertisement you've made for Peony.

69
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,900
There's nothing novel about the content of the advertisement.

70
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,710
Nothing in the the advertisement is memorable.

71
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:49,450
Online advertising volume and the click rates

72
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,570
are so low that they can even be neglected.

73
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,780
I can't even say any merit about it.

74
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,800

00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,090
I know more

76
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:57,940
than you.

77
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:02,080
That's because the chairman thinks that

78
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,730
the good quality of products is the most important thing.

79
00:04:03,730 --> 00:04:05,700
Therefore, as she gave us a very small budget,

80
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:06,920
the advertisement we made

81
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,600
has restricted our performance.

82
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:09,690
So you mean that

83
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:11,120
you think we didn't pay enough money?

84
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,590

85

89

90
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,670
you took the initiative to offer a low price

91
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,740
so as to attract the chairman to sign the contract with you.

92
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:29,610
After you officially signed the contract,

93
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:31,890
you could suggest increasing the investment cost.

94
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,610
Then you would have no advantage.

95
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:34,730
Just admit it.

190
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:07,630
[Peony]

191
00:08:01,810 --> 00:08:03,010
Do you really think that my mom

192
00:08:03,010 --> 00:08:04,660
doesn't know what you did?

193
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:07,080
Zhuang.

194
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,330
Don't blame me for saying this to you.

195
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,730
When one drinks water, he must not forget where it comes from.

196
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,290
What you're doing now is too extreme and unreliable.

197
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,870
[Peony]

198
00:08:13,290 --> 00:08:14,290
No one does this in a company.

199
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,130
My goodness.

200
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:17,530
I came across a big scene.

201
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:18,610
It's so exciting.

202
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,360
Zhuang.

203
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:20,570
Zhuang?

204
00:08:20,570 --> 00:08:21,600
As humans,

205
00:08:21,730 --> 00:08:22,770
we can't only talk about benefit.

206
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:23,570
We still need to think about emotions.

207
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,290
Just think about it.

208
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,360
Your mom and I have been through a lot all the way.

209
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,250
We're sworn friends for life and death.

210
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:28,470
Besides,

211
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:31,150
I held you in my arms when you were a child.

212
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:32,390
You once had a fever,

213
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:34,100
and I helped your mom look after her stall so that she could

214
00:08:34,169 --> 00:08:35,240
go back in time to check on you.

215
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:37,049
You were only this little back then.

216
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:45,370
[Peony]

217
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,370
You were just a little kid.

218
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:40,280
Okay, Uncle Lai.

219
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:42,940
Since you don’t want to talk about benefit,

220
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:44,570
let's talk about our emotions.

221
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,050
Sure.

222
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,450
Tianhui Packaging,

223
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,290
Dayou Transportation

224
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,080
and Xinlai Refrigeration.

225
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,690
You took nearly 60% of the profits for our cooperation with them every time.

226
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,480
When you put the filthy lucre

227
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,630
into your pocket,

228
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,460
had you ever thought about your bonds with the company?

229
00:08:55,950 --> 00:08:56,980
I didn't call the police,

230
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:58,810
and it shows my biggest repsect for you.

231
00:08:58,750 --> 00:08:59,910
[Peony]

232
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,090
We were asked to work when the company was poor.

233
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,610
Now the company is rich.

234
00:09:03,690 --> 00:09:05,370
I merely took the money I deserved.

235
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:08,150
You and your mother want to kick me away?

236
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,580
Let me tell you. No way!

237
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:10,120
Step aside.

238
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:11,010
Don't go.

239
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,290
You've grown up,

240
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,720
and you're a capable man now, huh?

241
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,560
You've learned to trick me.

242
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:20,720
I wanted to show you some mercy,

243
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:22,410
But it seems that it's not necessary now.

244
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:29,780
[Peony]

245
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,890
Hello, Zhu Li.

246
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:29,220
Call the police.

247
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,760
Give the file in the left drawer of my desk

248
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,530
to the police.

249
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:34,210
How dare you call the police?

250
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:35,010
I'll fight it out with you!

251
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,430
Give me your mobile phone.

252
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,410
A beauty saves the hero.

253
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,690
[Peony]

254
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,130
Here comes the chance for the hero to repay the kindness.

255
00:09:40,130 --> 00:09:41,290
Mr. Lou, don't be afraid.

256
00:09:41,290 --> 00:09:42,180
I'm here.

257
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:43,690
What are you doing?

258
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:44,650
Let go of Mr. Lou!

259
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:49,690
You...

260
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,390
[Peony]

261
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:02,710
Mr. Lou.

262
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,970
Wake up.

263
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,640
Mr. Lou.

264
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,520
Mr. Lou.

265
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:25,510
The hospitalization procedures are done.

266
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:26,160
Is there anything else

267
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
you want me to arrange?

268
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,390
Nothing else.

269
00:10:36,570 --> 00:10:37,820
Go back to work.

270
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,470
Okay. I'm leaving.

271
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,160
[Lou Yuan]

272
00:10:49,270 --> 00:10:50,650
Move the lever to lift the bed up for me.

273
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:51,330
Okay.

274
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:03,940
Is that okay?

275
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:06,520
Yes.

276
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,230
Where are you going to send me?

277
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,000
Will you be satisfied if you can send me

278
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:16,700
directly to the the morgue?

279
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:18,450
[Lou Yuan]

280
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,230
No, you misunderstood it.

281
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,450
Your health is the foundation of the company's progress.

282
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:22,480
The company can't operate without you.

283
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:23,190
Yes.

284
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:24,280
Without you,

285
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:25,210
the company can operate better.

286
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:26,900
[Lou Yuan]

287
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:26,080
You should go.

288
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,220
No.

289
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:30,370
I'm partly responsible for

290
00:11:30,370 --> 00:11:32,070
you lying here.

291
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:35,270
I swear I really wanted to save you.

292
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,090
I mean, that Mr. Lai...

293
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:37,730
No.

294
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,730
That villain.

295
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:39,910
How could he do that?

296
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,900
Luckily, he was taken away by the police.

297
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:43,030
I just

298
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,830
[Lou Yuan]

299
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,240
can't tolerate any bad behavior I've seen.

300
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,980
So this is really...

301
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,930
It's so annoying. Do you think so?

302
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:51,660
Then tell me

303
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:52,560
what we should do.

304
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:55,600
[Lou Yuan]

305
00:11:57,290 --> 00:11:58,440
I'll pay for the medical expenses.

306
00:11:58,530 --> 00:11:58,970
Okay.

307
00:11:59,280 --> 00:11:59,960
You'll pay.

308
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,580
No, Mr. Lou.

309
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:05,750
You...

310
00:12:11,130 --> 00:12:12,610
As a CEO,

311
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,290
you must have bought insurance.

312
00:12:14,290 --> 00:12:16,650
Your medical expenses will be fully compensated by the insurance.

313
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,370
[Lou Yuan]

314
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:17,450
How can a small company

315
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,210
like ours pay for the expenses?

316
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,400
Besides,

317
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:23,370
look at you.

318
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:24,390
You're tall,

319
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,330
strong

320
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:26,360
and handsome.

321
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:28,610
You wouldn't ask a little girl like me to...

322
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:29,190
Stop.

323
00:12:29,810 --> 00:12:30,580
Stop it.

324
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:35,460
[Lou Yuan]

325
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,090
I fainted because of hypoglycemia.

326
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,040
It had nothing to do with you.

327
00:12:35,730 --> 00:12:36,930
If you keep nagging,

328
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:39,410
Ba'er can never cooperate with us again.

329
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:50,200
Just stop it when the trend gets better.

330
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:57,700
[Lou Yuan]

331
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:51,710
Stop.

332
00:12:58,690 --> 00:12:59,850
I'm leaving.

333
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:01,350
Goodbye, Mr. Lou.

334
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,380
Bye.

335
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:13,810
He probably didn't remember that

336
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:15,290
I had vomited on him, right?

337
00:13:16,330 --> 00:13:17,620
It looks like there's still hope.

338
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,010
Zhu Li said that Ms. Mudan

339
00:13:24,010 --> 00:13:25,710
is also receiving treatment in this hospital.

340
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,190
Is this going to be discarded?

341
00:13:32,610 --> 00:13:33,200
Yes.

342
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,300
The cleaner will be here soon to discard it.

343
00:13:35,810 --> 00:13:36,340
Thank you.

344
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:37,010
You're welcome.

345
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:45,040
[Wish that you could recover soon and return to the stage]

346
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,080
Don't waste it.

347
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,270
Thank you.

348
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,790
[Peony]

349
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:56,420
Two million yuan?

350
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,870
Do you want to kill me?

351
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:00,770
Are there any other choices?

352
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,540
Yes, yes.

353
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:08,010
The scale of this company is a little small,

354
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:09,310
but their idea is good.

355
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:11,480
So what if it's a small company? As long as thier idea is good, it'll be fine.

356
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,480
Ask their representative to speak now.

357
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:13,740
Ba'er Creative.

358
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:20,020
[Peony]

359
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:14,650
Okay.

360
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:17,110
Mrs. Lou.

361
00:14:17,810 --> 00:14:20,240
Please read our proposal for

362
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:21,990
the online marketing campaign of your company.

363
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,800
Thanks for your hard work.

364
00:14:25,630 --> 00:14:29,660
[Peony]

365
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,290
Is this a handmade sweater?

366
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,620
You embroidered the flowers by yourself?

367
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,420
It's so nice.

368
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:34,120
Its style is the same as my sweater's.

369
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,610
Yes.

370
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:35,300
Right?

371
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,010
My mother knitted this for me.

372
00:14:37,010 --> 00:14:38,730
My mom likes knitting these kinds of clothes.

373
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:40,490
When I'm free,

374
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,250
I also learn from her.

375
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,660
If you like it,

376
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,130
I can knit one for you.

377
00:14:44,170 --> 00:14:46,250
No need. I can also do it myself.

378
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,330
When I'm free,

379
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,210
I also like thinking about these things.

380
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:51,290
Really? What a coincidence.

381
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,940
I think we're

382
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:55,150
brought together by fate.

383
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,570
[Peony]

384
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:57,090
Every time when I wear this sweater,

385
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,280
I just feel as if I had

386
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,530
come home.

387
00:14:59,530 --> 00:15:00,400
It gives me the feeling of home.

388
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,010
It's just like our Peony Corporation's sauces.

389
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:02,650
They taste

390
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:03,730
just like home.

391
00:15:03,730 --> 00:15:04,290
Yes, yes, yes.

392
00:15:04,290 --> 00:15:04,900
Our concept is to

393
00:15:04,930 --> 00:15:07,270
make the sauces taste like home.

394
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,570
Who is it? Come in.

395
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,300
Mrs. Lou. It's me.

396
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:24,570
It's you, En.

397
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,980
You're the one who cares about me.

398
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,840
I feel sorry for you.

399
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,130
You're sick,

400
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:36,460
but I have not come here until now.

401
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,050
-Mrs. Lou, sit down. -Come on.

402
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:38,910
Sit down.

403
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:40,690
How are you feeling?

404
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:41,750
I'm fine.

405
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:43,290
At our age,

406
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:44,760
it's inevitable to have a small disease.

407
00:15:44,850 --> 00:15:45,970
I look fine, right?

408
00:15:45,970 --> 00:15:46,720
Yes, yes.

409
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:47,900
That's good.

410
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,170
Your sweater is so beautiful.

411
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:51,640
Has your mother knitted this new sweater for you?

412
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,480
Look.

413
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,890
Your mother is so skilful in knitting clothes.

414
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,730
Look at me.

415
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:56,170
I'm knitting something, too.

416
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:58,230
I've unknitted and knitted it again and again.

417
00:15:58,650 --> 00:15:59,330
Look.

418
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:00,530
It's good. It's good.

419
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:02,210
Therefore,

420
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,970
during this period of time,

421
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,030
you should take a good rest in this hospital.

422
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,370
The young Mr. Lou will handle everything in the company, right?

423
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:08,490
You don't need to worry.

424
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:09,900
Come on. Have some water.

425
00:16:11,530 --> 00:16:12,580
In my opinion,

426
00:16:12,730 --> 00:16:14,860
Mr. Lou is quite brilliant.

427
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:17,070
He has just taken up the post for a few days,

428
00:16:17,170 --> 00:16:20,120
and he has fired those several pests, including Mr. Lai.

429
00:16:20,870 --> 00:16:23,180
Actually, I know what Mr. Lai

430
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,650
and the others did.

431
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:25,990
However, considering that

432
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,360
they used to work so hard with me

433
00:16:27,450 --> 00:16:29,750
to create and develop the company,

434
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:31,710
I couldn't make up my mind to fire them all the time.

435
00:16:32,050 --> 00:16:32,970
I thought

436
00:16:32,970 --> 00:16:34,250
after all,

437
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,920
when the company was founded,

438
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,300
they made contribution to it.

439
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:38,190
Right?

440
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:39,810
Mrs. Lou,

441
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:40,970
in my opinion,

442
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,290
you are just too kind.

443
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:46,460
Although Mr. Lou

444
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,550
doesn't

445
00:16:47,890 --> 00:16:49,330
think about their former contribution,

446
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:51,170
and is ruthless,

447
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:56,630
he's still very decisive in his work,

448
00:16:56,690 --> 00:16:57,890
and he talks in a sensible way.

449
00:16:57,970 --> 00:16:59,720
We really hope to learn more

450
00:16:59,810 --> 00:17:00,890
from Mr. Lou.

451
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,370
In this way, we can also make progress

452
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:03,520
and serve the company better.

453
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,150
Right?

454
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:05,339
Yes, yes, yes.

455
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:06,859
He's still young.

456
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,260
Compared with my performance back then,

457
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:10,250
there's still a small gap between him and me.

458
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,200
Of course. As a woman, you're no inferior to men.

459
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:15,660
Just because he has a role model like you,

460
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:17,270
he's so excellent now.

461
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,480
He has grown up.

462
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,569
Now he's not the little boy

463
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:24,430
who needs my company.

464
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:31,180
Back then,

465
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:34,450
his father had a heart disease

466
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:36,080
and suddenly passed away.

467
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,460
We were the only two members left in the family.

468
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,380
I had to look after him,

469
00:17:41,730 --> 00:17:43,550
and had to earn money to support the family.

470
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,210
I had no choice

471
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:46,020
but to

472
00:17:46,130 --> 00:17:47,120
set up a stall to sell things.

473
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:50,460
Later,

474
00:17:50,610 --> 00:17:52,640
our life got a little better.

475
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,850
But I had to manage the factory.

476
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,660
I couldn't spend time with him

477
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,760
every night.

478
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,790
To be honest,

479
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,280
I really don't know

480
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,490
how he got through those nights.

481
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,150
Sometimes...

482
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:11,230
Sometimes when I got home,

483
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:14,100
I found that his little pillow was wet.

484
00:18:14,530 --> 00:18:16,320
I knew he must have fallen asleep

485
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,420
while crying.

486
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,660
Later, I came up with a way.

487
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,850
I bought him a stuffed toy.

488
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:26,050
I asked him to hold it in his arms.

489
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,250
I said,

490
00:18:27,410 --> 00:18:28,250
just hold it in your arms.

491
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:29,970
When you hold it in your arms,

492
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,540
it feels as if I were hugging you.

493
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,200
He was very obedient.

494
00:18:34,410 --> 00:18:35,330
He held it in his arms,

495
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:36,790
and then fell asleep.

496
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:42,760
He even can't get rid of

497
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:44,600
this bad habit till now.

498
00:19:13,170 --> 00:19:13,860
Ke.

499
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,290
Ai Lin's

500
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,720
concert will be held soon.

501
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:19,510
For the tickets...

502
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,130
You don't know how to help those who are in needs,

503
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,780
but you're quite good at making things more difficult for those

504
00:19:23,930 --> 00:19:25,040
who are facing problems.

505
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:27,090
These are two different things.

506
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,280
You promised me that

507
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,410
you would buy me tickets.

508
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:30,440
Your idol

509
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:32,620
only holds a concert once in her life?

510
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:33,650
Besides,

511
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,320
you've been a fan of your idol for so long,

513
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,770
what kind of idol she is.

514
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,330
Have I never showed you how charming she is?

515
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,290
No.

516
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:43,990
Just show me.

517
00:19:44,170 --> 00:19:45,470
If you can show me how charming she is,

518
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,140
not to mention the concert tickets,

519
00:19:47,170 --> 00:19:49,050
I'll even buy you her relevant products.

520
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,390
You said this yourself.

521
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:51,570
You've been a fan of your idol for so long,

522
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:52,860
but we've never seen her.

523
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:53,980
Let me tell you.

524
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,250
You've never seen

00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:38,970
Well, Shi,

540
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,490
calm down.

Have I ever put pressure on you?

Ba'er Creative, Extraordinary Works.

566
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:31,810
Well...

567
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:32,650
I have a piece of good news,

568
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:33,120
and a piece of bad news.

569
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,270
Which one do you want to hear first?

570
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:35,400
The good news.

571
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:36,570
The good news.

572
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:40,210
After I battled with with Mr. Lou

573
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:40,920
mutally and fiercely

574
00:21:40,950 --> 00:21:42,820
day and night,

575
00:21:42,850 --> 00:21:44,630
I've discovered one of his weaknesses.

576
00:21:45,410 --> 00:21:46,540
What weakness?

577
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,160
He likes hair.

578
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,610
Who is Hair?

579
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:53,570
Everyone has hair on his body.

580
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:54,300
Shut up!

581
00:21:55,310 --> 00:21:56,140
What's the bad news?

582
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,700
Well,

583
00:21:58,990 --> 00:22:00,330
three years ago,

584
00:22:00,530 --> 00:22:01,930
I once drank wine with him,

585
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,400
and I drank too much.

586
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,080
Okay.

587
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:07,710
Let's pack up and leave together.

588
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:08,720
Okay.

589
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:10,220
Let's buy train tickets and go home.

590
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,650
Fatty.

591
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:14,860
If we don't want Mr. Lou to think of that incident,

592
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,080
I have an idea.

[Introduction of the Company]

594
00:22:24,970 --> 00:22:25,780
Mr. Wang.

595
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:28,610
It's me.

596
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,970

598
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:32,980
What are you doing here?

599
00:22:33,050 --> 00:22:34,290
I'm here to see Mr. Lou.

600
00:22:34,290 --> 00:22:35,390
Is he here?

601
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,570
He's upstairs.

602
00:22:38,570 --> 00:22:39,380
I'm going to see him, too.

603
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:40,050
Let's go together.

604
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:40,730
Okay.

605
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,710
[Peony]

606
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,410
With your look like this today, I didn't recognize you.

607
00:22:42,410 --> 00:22:43,080
You look very fashionable.

608
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,370
It suits you.

609
00:22:44,370 --> 00:22:45,090
Thank you.

610
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:45,860
Thanks, Mr. Wang.

611
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:47,110
Mr. Wang, you're here.

612
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:48,750
Secretary Huang.

613
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,050
Your earrings are beautiful.

614
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,270
They suit you so well.

615
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,450
What perfume are you wearing today?

616
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,010
It smells so manly.

617
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,210
Mr. Wang never relies on perfume.

618
00:22:57,270 --> 00:22:58,070
He was born to

619
00:22:58,130 --> 00:22:59,970
have this manly smell.

620
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:01,790
You're getting better at complimenting others, Secretary Huang.

621
00:23:08,810 --> 00:23:09,480
Mr. Wang.

622
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:12,690
Your clothes look so good.

623
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:13,250
Get to the point.

624
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:15,130
For the project we're working on with Ms. Hua,

625
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,280
I've put the fild on your desk.

626
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:16,810
Okay.

627
00:23:16,810 --> 00:23:17,730
Leave Ms. Hua to me.

628
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,930
The key is that you're doing great in the early stage of the project.

629
00:23:19,950 --> 00:23:21,240
Keep up the good work in the later stage.

630
00:23:21,290 --> 00:23:21,650
Go for it!

631
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,560
Go for it!

632
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,330
Go.

633
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:24,170
Okay.

634
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:27,450
People from a big company also butter others up?

635
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,810
Buttering others up is a kind of ability.

636
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:32,000
Look. It can make people happy after we butter them up.

637
00:23:32,090 --> 00:23:32,810
Yes.

638
00:23:32,810 --> 00:23:34,200
He looked so confident when he left.

639
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,570
Are you helping me because I'm good at buttering you up?

640
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:38,320
I help you

641
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,340
mainly because

642
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,610
Yuan is too scrupulous in doing everything.

643
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,130
I think many people

644
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,570
deserve a second chance,

645
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:45,010
for example,

646
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:45,810
you.

647
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:47,250
Mr. Wang,

648
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:49,530
you're really both handsome and kind.

649
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,330
You smell

650
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,720
so manly indeed.

651
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:52,930
You really know me well.

652
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:53,830
Let's go.

653
00:23:54,810 --> 00:23:55,850
When will the funds for our R&D department

654
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:56,940
be approved?

655
00:23:57,850 --> 00:23:59,490
You talked with me about money as soon as our conversation started.

656
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,470
This is inappropriate, right?

657
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,450
Is there anyone in our company whose final goal

658
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,360
is not to ask you for money?

659
00:24:04,650 --> 00:24:06,210
At least, after I ask you for money,

660
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,320
I can still make money for you.

661
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:07,730
Right?

662
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:09,200
That's right.

663
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,250
Only you, Cao Ya, can say that.

664
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:12,940
I'll give you the money

665
00:24:12,970 --> 00:24:13,610
at the end of the month.

666
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:14,930
Okay.

667
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,000
I'll wait for your news.

668
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,320
I have to go.

669
00:24:18,210 --> 00:24:19,270
Yuan!

670
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,910
Look whom I've brought.

671
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,510
Hello, Mr. Lou.

672
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,450
You brought her here?

673
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,210
Who asked you to bring her here?

674
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:35,070
Ya, let's go have lunch.

675
00:24:35,190 --> 00:24:35,570
Okay.

676
00:24:35,570 --> 00:24:36,030
Well,

677
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:37,890
opportunities are for those who are prepared.

678
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,640
Go for it!

679
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:39,680
I have to go.

680
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:41,640
Please.

681
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,590
I've brought you some gifts.

682
00:24:44,810 --> 00:24:46,770
I hope you'll like them.

683
00:24:51,010 --> 00:24:51,730
Sit down.

684
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,130
Okay.

685
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,620
I know why you're here.

686
00:24:58,650 --> 00:24:59,440
I'll make it short.

687
00:24:59,460 --> 00:24:59,970
Okay.

688
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,970
I've read all the proposals

689
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:01,840
made by you.

690
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,080
I can't say they're very bad.

691
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,600
But I can only say that there's nothing attractive.

692
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,490
Actually, I'm also not sure

693
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:09,380
whether you're able to do this project.

694
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,540
I've finished talking about it.

695
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,900
It's not that we're incompetent.

696
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,710
It's because Party A just gave a small sum of money to us

697
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:15,890
and they had many requirements.

698
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,660
I revised the proposal again and again.

699
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:19,370
All the good ideas were gone after the revision.

700
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:20,680
Besides, they kept

701
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,030
giving suggestions,

702
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,700
but their ideas were not unified.

703
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:25,650
How could we work on it?

704
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:28,020
This is my first time that I've seen

705
00:25:28,090 --> 00:25:29,750
Party B tell Party A that

706
00:25:29,780 --> 00:25:31,440
Party A gave a very sum money to them and had too many requirements.

707
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:33,570
After all,

708
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:35,530
you're just incompetent.

709
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,500
Mr. Lou.

710
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,500
I know

711
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:41,890
you despise small companies like ours.

712
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:43,050
You also look down on

713
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:45,150
the hard work of small photoes like us.

714
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,160
But when you said that we were just incompetent,

715
00:25:47,250 --> 00:25:49,770
you erased all our efforts.

716
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:50,890
This is so unfair.

717
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:51,830
Can't you even

718
00:25:52,130 --> 00:25:53,710
give us a chance?

719
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:54,680
Chance?

720
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,250
You can come to see me.

721
00:25:56,530 --> 00:25:57,730
This is actually a chance.

722
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:59,080
But you didn't cherish it.

723
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:01,350
It seems that you still don't understand me.

724
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:03,520
You said that

725
00:26:03,650 --> 00:26:04,560
I despised small companies

726
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,470
like yours,

727
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:07,270
and I looked down on small potatoes like you?

728
00:26:07,920 --> 00:26:10,090
What I despise the most is the behavior

729
00:26:10,090 --> 00:26:11,250
of acquiring a project

730
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:12,660
by buttering up Party A.

731
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:14,920
I won't even look down on

732
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:16,170
the cleaners in our company.

733
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,450
Because they're down to earth,

734
00:26:17,450 --> 00:26:18,490
and work hard step by step

735
00:26:18,490 --> 00:26:19,860
to get their own chances.

736
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:22,930
You want a chance, don't you?

737
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,290
There's the post of cleaner in the company.

738
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:25,060
Will you do the job?

739
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,090
Yes!

740
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,050
It's just a metaphor.

741
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:29,960
Mr. Lou.

742
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:32,780
As long as I can change your opinion on our company,

743
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:35,440
I will try my best.

744
00:26:35,470 --> 00:26:36,330
No, I...

745
00:26:36,650 --> 00:26:37,620
Didn't you say that

746
00:26:37,730 --> 00:26:39,510
you would give us a chance?

747
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,050
Did I say that I would give you a chance?

748
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:47,010
Then I want to make a request.

749
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:47,900
No problem.

750
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:49,490
Don't use these small

751
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:50,430
and useless tricks.

752
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:51,130
If you have the time,

753
00:26:51,130 --> 00:26:52,480
you should do something more meaningful instead.

754
00:26:54,650 --> 00:26:55,270
Okay.

755
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:57,390
No problem.

756
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,260
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

757
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:00,350
I'm leaving.

Article 11 of Rules for Party B.

759
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:11,780
Only by staying in the battlefield

760
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,380
can we have the chance to survive.

761
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,150
A good cat

762
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,240
has become a cunning little fox.

763
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,980
Hello, Ke.

764
00:27:31,050 --> 00:27:33,390
I met Mr. Lou today.

765
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,050
I don't think

766
00:27:35,070 --> 00:27:36,190
he remembers that

767
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,870
[Peace and Joy] [Source of Money]

768
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:39,020
I was the girl who vomited on him.

00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:44,070
[The Future Is Promising]

770
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:42,050
But he still wants to terminate the contract with us.

771
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:43,760
So I have no choice

772
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:44,770
but to become

773
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:46,880
a member of the Peony Corporation.

774
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:50,170
If you can join the Peony Corporation, you'll get more than half of the success.

775
00:27:50,410 --> 00:27:51,180
En.

776
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,440
You've sacrificed too much for our company.

777
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,320
You're our best customer service clerk.

778
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,170
As the saying goes,

779
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:01,330
danger can never be overcome without taking risks.

780
00:28:01,370 --> 00:28:01,930
Don't worry.

781
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:03,810
I will try my best to get this order.

782
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:05,970
That's it.

783
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:06,370
Bye bye.

784
00:28:11,610 --> 00:28:12,340
It smells good.

785
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,400
The noodles can be eaten now, right?

786
00:28:34,120 --> 00:28:34,850
Mom.

787
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:35,610
What's wrong?

788
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,320
En, have you had dinner?

789
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:38,580
I'm eating. Look.

790
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:39,690
Be careful with your health.

791
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:40,890
Don't get too tired.

792
00:28:41,050 --> 00:28:42,090
Don't stay up late at night.

793
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,900
Don't play on your phone even if you stay up late.

794
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:45,370
Don't play games even if you play on your phone.

795
00:28:45,370 --> 00:28:46,210
Did you hear me?

796
00:28:47,570 --> 00:28:48,210
Don't worry.

797
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:49,480
Take good care of yourselves.

798
00:28:49,610 --> 00:28:51,200
Alright. Our daughter is going to bed.

799
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,090
-Stop talking. -Let me take a look at her.

800
00:28:52,090 --> 00:28:53,110
Let me take a look.

801
00:28:53,470 --> 00:28:54,010
By the way,

802
00:28:54,010 --> 00:28:54,860

805
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,410
doesn't look good. It's like a lunatic.

806
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:00,850
I'll send you some nice ones later.

807
00:29:01,010 --> 00:29:02,310
Replace it with another picture.

808
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,400
Bye bye.

809
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:29,210
I'm going to work as a cleaner at Party A's company tomorrow.

810
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:32,350
Though being a cleaner doesn't necessarily mean that I can get the chance of cooperation,

811
00:29:32,690 --> 00:29:36,440
I still have to try my best even if I only have small hope.

812
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:38,190
Ba'er needs this chance.

813
00:29:38,250 --> 00:29:39,060

00:29:39,290 --> 00:29:40,860

815
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:42,980

-Hello, Mr. Lou. -Hello, Mr. Lou.

818
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:02,950
Mr. Lou.

819
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:04,450
Hello, Mr. Lou.

820
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:05,180
Hello.

821
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,480
Mr. Lou.

822
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:09,920
That's all for now.

823

Dong Dong'en.

824
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:39,600
Mr. Lou.

825
00:30:39,690 --> 00:30:40,530
Good morning.

826
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,310
I've started working.

827
00:30:43,170 --> 00:30:45,390
Who told you to take up the job arbitrarily?

828
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,090
Mr. Lou,

829
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:49,130
I already went to the logistics department to report for duty this morning.

830
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:49,870
This is

831
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:52,060
the work assigned to me by Ms. Zhao.

832
00:30:52,090 --> 00:30:52,860
Look at the floor.

833
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:53,820
It's so bright.

834
00:30:53,890 --> 00:30:55,260
Look at the stairs.

835
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,160
There's no dust at all.

836
00:30:57,650 --> 00:30:59,710
This suits the high-class image

837
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:01,790
of our Peony Corporation.

838
00:31:03,530 --> 00:31:04,110
Alright.

839
00:31:04,170 --> 00:31:05,330
It's quite good.

840
00:31:06,170 --> 00:31:08,530
What else can I do for you, Mr. Lou?

841
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,450
I'll do

842
00:31:09,530 --> 00:31:11,050
whatever you ask me to do.

843
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:14,920
♫You're in disguise and pretend to be enthusiastic♫

00:33:16,650 --> 00:33:17,360
Yes.

895
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,490
Mr. Lou, you went to the toilet personally.

896
00:33:19,570 --> 00:33:21,170
I'm really sorry.

897
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:23,700
I should be blamed for being careless.

898
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:25,510
I didn't replenish

899
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:26,650
the toilet paper.

900
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:29,590

You're welcome.

This is

905
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,990
what I should do.

906
00:34:01,530 --> 00:34:03,100
Let me clean it for you.

907
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:05,290
It's not necessary for now.

908
00:34:05,850 --> 00:34:07,680
-Not necessary. -It's necessary.

909
00:34:08,330 --> 00:34:08,889
No hurry.

910
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,520
I'm in a hurry.

911
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:10,679
I'm very diligent.

912
00:34:11,980 --> 00:34:12,530
No need to do it in such a hurry.

913
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:12,969
I'm really serious.

914
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:15,050
Mr. Lou is really cruel.

915
00:34:15,610 --> 00:34:17,199
I've heard that in order to fire Mr. Lai,

916
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:18,830
he made a lot of effort.

917
00:34:21,489 --> 00:34:22,179
What is this called?

918
00:34:22,449 --> 00:34:24,170
-It seems Mr. Lou didn't wash his hands. -Get rid of the person as soon as he has done his job.

919
00:34:24,510 --> 00:34:25,659
He's really ruthless.

920
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:27,110
He doesn't show any mercy.

921
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,170
That's how he treats the senior executive who made great contribution.

922
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:30,550
For the few of us,

923
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,500
we'd better stay cautious and keep a low profile.

924
00:34:33,130 --> 00:34:35,940
Mr. Lou is so cruel

925
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,489
and ruthless.

926
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:40,639
I also want to slack off

927
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,139
during working time.

928
00:34:42,409 --> 00:34:43,520
Let me teach you a way.

929
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:44,679
Just use the toilet for half an hour

930
00:34:44,699 --> 00:34:45,739
during the working time every day.

931
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:52,520
Mr. Lou.

932
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,860
It's normal for people in the company to gossip.

933
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:57,220
Don't take it

934
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:58,860
seriously.

935
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:01,730
Why is there no good thing

936
00:35:02,050 --> 00:35:03,060

00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,590
I'm going to announce a new personnel appointment.

970
00:36:42,770 --> 00:36:45,360
The directors of the Finance Department and the Legal Department have left our company.

971
00:36:45,390 --> 00:36:46,500

[Peony]

986
00:37:02,130 --> 00:37:03,320
Our Marketing Department

987
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,730
did a market research on

988
00:37:04,730 --> 00:37:06,570
all the sauces in the market.

989
00:37:06,570 --> 00:37:08,220
Young people's consumption capacity

990
00:37:08,250 --> 00:37:10,220
is much bigger than that of the middle-aged people.

991
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:13,260
If we want to increase

992
00:37:13,330 --> 00:37:14,180
the sales volume quickly,

993
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:15,470
we need to occupy

994
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,970
the market of young people as soon as possible.

What about Mr. Cao?

Our R&D department

1001
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,520
has lost many staff.

1002
00:37:23,740 --> 00:37:25,170
But luckily,

1003
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,790
the several main clerks have stayed,

1004
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,740
and the new employees have started working.

1005
00:37:29,490 --> 00:37:30,900
These are the several new flavours

1006
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:32,660
we're going to launch according to

1007
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:34,200
the result of the Marketing Department's research.

1008

Just do the work according to your procedure.

1016
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,580
If there are no other problems,

1017
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:07,010

00:38:10,410 --> 00:38:11,430
from now on,

1022
00:38:11,530 --> 00:38:12,480
I'll count on you

1023
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:13,880
for the invoices.

1024
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,160
Count on me? I'll handle everything according to the rules of the company.

1025
00:38:15,160 --> 00:38:16,690
Handle everything according to the rules? Let's have dinner together later.

1027

Get rid of the person as soon as he has done his job.

1028
00:38:31,530 --> 00:38:34,270
Mr. Lou is so cruel

1029
00:38:34,550 --> 00:38:35,850
-and ruthless. -Come in.

1030
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:45,190
Mr. Lou.

1031
00:38:45,290 --> 00:38:46,540
I've brought the file

1032
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:47,430
you asked for.

1033
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,400
I'll put it here.

1034
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:52,530
If there's nothing else,

1035
00:38:52,530 --> 00:38:53,770

Sit down.

1038
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,080
Let me ask you a question.

1039
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:12,100
Do you also think that I'm a boss

1040
00:39:12,810 --> 00:39:13,890
who doesn't care about friendship of the past,

1041
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,120
gets rids of the person as soon as he has done his job,

1042
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,150
and is not quite humane?

1043
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,430
Mr. Lou, for your question...

1044
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:22,440
You have to be honest.

1045
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:28,060
Actually,

1046
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,210
you're not like that.

1047
00:39:29,740 --> 00:39:31,250
After all, Mr. Lai and the others

1048
00:39:31,290 --> 00:39:33,370
used power for personal gain.

1049
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,050
Although...

1050
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:38,000
No need to say "although".

1051

Go back to work.

1052
00:39:39,930 --> 00:39:40,720
Okay, Mr. Lou.

1053
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:57,440
Why should I care about what others think?

1054
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:06,320
