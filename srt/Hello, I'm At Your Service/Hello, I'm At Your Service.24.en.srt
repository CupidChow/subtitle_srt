[Episode 24]

6
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,330
I've read your proposal.

7
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,840
The idea is good.

8
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,520
I like it very much.

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,229
Your awareness is quite ahead of the time.

10
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,650
But I don't think

11
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:51,150
it's down-to-earth enough.

12
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,870
Nowadays,

13
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,770
selling concepts doesn't work anymore.

14
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,670
Like what you said, if the price is high,

15
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:01,180
no matter how you brag it,

16
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,320
the consumers won't be able to afford it.

17
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,810
Mr. Huang, here's the thing.

18
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:06,260
The budget we proposed here

19
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,550
is just an approximation.

20
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,240
As for the final price,

21
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:10,580
based on my years of experience

22
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:11,940
in Triangle Group,

23
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:13,620
I don't think it will be

24
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,420
more than 20%

25
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:16,150
higher than the prices of similar products.

26
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:18,740
Similar products.

27
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,540
I wish you had been here a few months earlier.

28
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,840
I've seen this kind of product

29
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,050
in the market.

30
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:27,730
It doesn't sell well.

31
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,620
I think

32
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:31,160
you should think more carefully.

33
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:34,030
Either give me a cheaper price

34
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,829
or something better.

35
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,100
Mr. Huang.

36
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,940
Actually, I mentioned this proposal to you

37
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,740
a few months ago.

38
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:42,880
You wanted to invest it then.

39
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,890
A few months ago,

40
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:46,300
you were still Mr. Su, the CEO.

41
00:02:46,829 --> 00:02:48,760
The shade of a big tree is great for cooling off.

42
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:51,710
Okay, that's all for today.

43
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,250
Mr. Huang,

44
00:02:54,329 --> 00:02:56,180
since you just want to cool off,

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:57,820
maybe my project

46
00:02:57,820 --> 00:02:58,900
is not suitable for you.

47
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:00,900
Thank you for taking the time

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,300
to reject me during your busy schedule.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,510
I believe

50
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,970
I can find

51
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,900
a partner who can ride the wind and waves.

52
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,300
Think about it.

53
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:10,010
Among those who left Mr. Wan,

54
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:12,580
who could ride the wind and waves?

55
00:03:13,370 --> 00:03:14,500
Listen to me.

56
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:15,730
Don't let yourself

58
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,470
Hello, it's me.

59
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,270
You don't have to tell me.

60
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:39,860
That's what I want.

61
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,140
How dare you come?

62
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:00,940
Why not?

63
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,450
I'll make it short.

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,500
Zheng Chao has completely

65
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,630
betrayed you.

66
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,640
I didn't expect Zheng Chao to be in your hands.

67
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:17,890
No wonder I couldn't reach him.

68
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,380
Watch your language.

69
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:21,470
He came to me with this

70
00:04:21,899 --> 00:04:23,790
and said he wanted to testify for Peony.

71
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,260
The evidence in this

72
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:26,460
is enough to put you in jail.

73
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:28,690
I have nothing to say.

74
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:30,780
Are you sure you don't want to listen to it first?

75
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,600
I know

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,070
what I did.

77
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:35,450
I'm willing to take the responsibility.

78
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:38,000
I've left Triangle.

79
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,800
It won't do you any good to bring me down now.

80
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,010
On the contrary,

81
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,730
we should cooperate.

82
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:46,180
Only in this way can we bring down Mr. Wan.

83
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:47,540
Go on.

84
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,060
I believe that you've suspected

85
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:51,300
Zheng Chao's surrender.

86
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,950
If you settle the score with me now,

87
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,940
Triangle will seize the chance

88
00:04:55,940 --> 00:04:57,130
to severely attack Peony.

89
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,820
I've been working in Triangle

90
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,690
for Mr. Wan for so many years.

91
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,440
I must have something that can protect myself.

92
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,900
Actually, Mr. Wan had some private deals.

93
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,580
Even though they were posted,

94
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:12,540
they showed illegal traces.

95
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,020
I’m willing to share the information with you

96
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:16,260
and work with you to bring down Mr. Wan.

97
00:05:17,380 --> 00:05:19,250
But I need you to promise me one thing.

98
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,250
After we succeed,

99
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,780
give me these recordings.

100
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,870
I believe

101
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:26,140
this deal is advantageous to you

102
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,700
in any case.

103
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:29,020
Well said.

104
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:32,060
But you have to be clear

105
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:34,580
that you're the one in danger now.

106
00:05:35,060 --> 00:05:36,580
You're also the one who's seeking

107
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:37,780
our help.

108
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:41,100
Peony has been competing

109
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:42,740
with Triangle for a long time.

110
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:44,500
We appear to be on good terms on the surface.

111
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,980
Mr. Wan can't interfere with Peony.

112
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:47,740
However, you're the one

113
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:50,340
who is being pressured by Mr. Wan step by step.

114
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,740
He wants to use me to send you to jail.

115
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,340
You also want to use me to bring him down

116
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:57,020
for your own safety, right?

117
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,580
That's right.

118
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,900
That's what I think.

119
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,180
But what I said is also the truth.

120
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:04,790
Do you remember the dinner three years ago when I tried to set a trap for you?

121
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,390
Do you think I was the only one who wanted to bring you down?

122
00:06:07,890 --> 00:06:09,420
Mr. Wan's real plan

123
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,210
will not only ruin your reputation

124
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,790
but also destroy the entire Peony company.

125
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,910
Compared to him, I'm far behind in playing tricks,

126
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,160
let alone the current you.

127
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:22,990
You have weaknesses

128
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:24,900
and vulnerabilities.

129
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,210
Are you threatening me?

130
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:33,530
I'm just reminding you.

You got off work so late today.

134
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,740
Madam Wang thinks

135
00:06:56,740 --> 00:06:58,980
that the jingle we made for the advertisement isn't upbeat enough

136
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,580
and isn't earworm-worthy.

Fatty is studying new music styles.

138
00:07:02,390 --> 00:07:04,760
Listening to them was giving me a headache.

139
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:05,580
All right.

140
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:08,070
What did Su Qi say?

141
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:11,300
Su Qi said the mastermind was Mr. Wan.

142
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,200
He also said he wanted to work with us this time.

143
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:16,040
That’s similar to what we thought.

144
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,900
Then, my military strategist, do you think

145
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:19,300
whether we should trust him?

146
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:21,840
You want to work with him?

147
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:25,020
We have so much leverage on Su Qi.

148
00:07:25,190 --> 00:07:27,300
And Mr. Wan got rid of him after using him.

149
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,440
He even wants to make Su Qi a scapegoat this time.

150
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,840
I don't think Su Qi can let it go.

151
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,900
Besides,

152
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,980
what he eagers to do the most now

153
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:36,140
is to get out of the mess of Triangle.

154
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:38,300
Your enemy's enemy is your friend.

155
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:40,940
That makes sense.

156
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,890
Even if he plays tricks,

157
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,980
I believe we will be able to handle it.

158
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:45,650
I believe in you.

159
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,180
But there's one thing Su Qi said wrong.

160
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,210
You

161
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,040
are not my weakness.

162
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:56,540
You are my armor.

163
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:01,100
All right.

164
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,020
Let's go home.

165
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:08,740
Come on.

166
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,640
Come over.

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,180
Since I asked you to investigate Mr. Wan,

168
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,370
you lost touch.

169
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,430
I guess you were bribed by him,

170
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,560
or maybe threatened by him.

171
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,260
Only guys like you,

172
00:08:35,260 --> 00:08:36,860
who're money-crazed

173
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,659
would sell your lives to him.

174
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,260
Do you think Mr. Wan will protect you?

175
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,810
You think too much.

176
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,610
You want to run away after getting the money?

177
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,840
Do you think I'm dead?

178
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,870
I have investigated things

179
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:57,330
you asked me to investigate.

180
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:58,950
Stop beating me.

181
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,140
Do you think you're qualified

182
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
to negotiate with me?

183
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:02,860
I...

184
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,780
I have many valuable clues.

185
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,310
Really.

186
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,060
OK.

187
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:12,260
I'll give you one last chance.

188
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,950

00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:03,960
they have to ask Ai Lin to come to Eighty-two.

563
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:04,770
You're bragging.

564
00:25:06,050 --> 00:25:07,330
Don't expose Ke.

565
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:09,140
Ke, in the future...

566
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:09,600
No.

567
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,140
I'll work hard this time.

568
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,620
I won't complain

569
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,530
if you ask me to work overtime in the future.

570
00:25:14,100 --> 00:25:15,660
You will only stop complaining

571
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:18,090
when it comes to Ai Lin.

572
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:24,060
What is this?

573
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:26,900
It's garish.

574
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,690
The latest drawing tablet.

575
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,630
For me?

576
00:25:32,970 --> 00:25:35,630
Ke bought it for you with a lot of money. It's the best version.

577
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:38,110
Not bad.

578
00:25:38,130 --> 00:25:39,350
That's more like it.

579
00:25:42,250 --> 00:25:43,020
Where's En?

580
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:47,270
She received a call this morning.

581
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,060
She said it was from a headhunter.

582
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:52,230
It was about someone wanting to change the job. I didn't hear it clearly.

583
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:55,980
Change the job?

584
00:25:57,910 --> 00:25:59,520
Stop eating. Put it down.

585
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:00,260
Let's go.

586
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:01,860
Yu, look after the company.

587
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,110
The four of us will go out.

588
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,600
Put them in the fridge.

589
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:05,620
Okay.

590
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:06,850
Let me get my coat.

591
00:26:07,350 --> 00:26:08,140
Hurry up.

592
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:21,120
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

593
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,780
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

594
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:24,140
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

595
00:26:24,140 --> 00:26:25,850
You shouldn't eavesdrop.

596
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:28,080
What if she takes the new job?

597
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,190
If so, it's because you're so stingy.

598
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,380
People like En

599
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,100
are popular anywhere in the job market.

600
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:35,390
They're talking about the salary.

601
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:39,980
One million a year.

602
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:43,110
1.5% of the company's shares.

603
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:45,120
You'll also provide me with housing and a car?

604
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,050
You think too highly of me.

605
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,230
Not only that,

606
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:53,780
Xiangde Group's mother company, Xiangyun Group

607
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:55,030
has a solid foundation

608
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,460
and abundant resources.

609
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,780
Other companies can't compete.

610
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:02,180
We've shown our utmost sincerity.

611
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:04,130
If you want to pursue your career

612
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,080
in a company,

613
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:07,870
Xiangde is definitely your best choice.

614
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,610
Actually, I'm not

615
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,100
that ambitious.

616
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,550
I think money is the most important thing.

617
00:27:14,750 --> 00:27:15,350
Oh no.

618
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,020
Since you think so highly of me...

619
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:16,860
Oh no.

620
00:27:17,310 --> 00:27:18,640
Oh no.

621
00:27:18,670 --> 00:27:19,920
Can you raise the salary

622
00:27:20,030 --> 00:27:22,510
a little more?

623
00:27:25,110 --> 00:27:26,970
What is your expected annual salary?

624
00:27:32,490 --> 00:27:33,550
Listen carefully.

625
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:36,070
Ten million.

626
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,460
Ten...

627
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:38,980
Ten million?

628
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:39,370
This...

629
00:27:43,010 --> 00:27:44,290
I was just kidding.

630
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:46,680
To be honest,

631
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:48,940
I have no intention of leaving Eight-two.

632
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,900
Yes.

633
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,780
Although I don't earn that much now,

634
00:27:51,780 --> 00:27:53,980
the most important thing for me is

635
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,540
my friends who work with me.

636
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,300
They cannot be measured by money.

637
00:27:58,630 --> 00:27:59,820
You asked me before.

638
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:01,620
I told you I didn't want to change my job.

639
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,260
But you didn't believe me.

640
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,230
I understand what you mean.

641
00:28:05,570 --> 00:28:07,490
As you said, you don't want to change your job for the time being.

642
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:10,480
You might change your mind later.

643
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:12,850
This is my name card.

644
00:28:13,620 --> 00:28:15,060
Feel free to contact me if you need anything.

645
00:28:15,880 --> 00:28:17,920
The door of Xiangyun will always be open for you.

646
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,570
Thank you for your recognition.

647
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:20,380
Then we won't disturb you

648
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:21,550
during your lunch break for now.

649
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:22,140
Okay.

650
00:28:23,250 --> 00:28:23,850
Thank you.

651
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:24,420
You're welcome.

652
00:28:24,660 --> 00:28:25,220
Thank you.

653
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,440
Did you enjoy it?

654
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,850
What a pity.

655
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,550
Such a high salary.

656
00:28:44,270 --> 00:28:45,320
You should go.

657
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:46,690
When you're rich,

658
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:48,280
don't forget to give us a hand.

659
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,160
Do not forget your friends when you are wealthy and prosperous.

660
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,430
Is what I like money?

661
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,630
What I like is it makes me

662
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:58,280
appear less outdated when I'm with you.

663
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,500
I don't think

664
00:29:00,860 --> 00:29:02,610
we are that outdated.

665
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:03,180
Right.

666
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,260
They offered you such a high salary.

667
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,640
Is it a trap?

668
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,240
You're right.

669
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,070
Although

670
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,090
I'm excellent,

671
00:29:10,510 --> 00:29:12,990
I'm a newcomer at work.

672
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,300
Why would a company as big as theirs

673
00:29:14,300 --> 00:29:15,820
come to poach me?

674
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:18,270
Xiangde

675
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:20,010
sounds familiar.

676
00:29:20,030 --> 00:29:21,360
Of course.

677
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:22,710
I used to work in Xiangde.

678
00:29:22,780 --> 00:29:24,730
You can't go to this company.

679
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,080
Their boss is a rich second generation.

680
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:28,470
He pissed off several designers and creative directors.

681
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:29,170
You can't go.

682
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:31,180
He is an empty shell, strong on the outside but weak on the inside.

683
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:33,700
I knew something must be wrong.

684
00:29:36,500 --> 00:29:38,100
What are you waiting for?

685
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,150
Get back to work.

686
00:29:39,550 --> 00:29:40,680
Let's go.

687
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:41,800
Stop watching dramas.

688
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,750
Let's go.

689
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:44,750
Let's go.

690
00:29:58,540 --> 00:29:59,340
Ke.

691
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:02,710
How about we recruit two more people?

692
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:05,400
This kid was so tired that he'd fallen asleep.

693
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:08,060
Our recruitment advertisement has been published.

694
00:30:08,060 --> 00:30:09,860
But few people are willing

695
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,140
to accept the conditions.

696
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,410
This is because the market is restless.

697
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,930
Although the environment here is ordinary,

698
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:20,820
he can join the projects as soon as he comes.

699
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,300
He will earn a lot of experience.

700
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:26,810
It's better than serving tea in big companies.

701
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:28,100
Right, Yu?

702
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:29,510
Forget it.

703
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:31,410
Don't flatter ourselves.

704
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:33,100
It's just because he's stingy.

705
00:30:34,830 --> 00:30:35,810
Am I stingy?

706
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:38,590
I've prepared a big gift for En.

707
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:40,750
The gift is here.

708
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:43,520
Master.

709
00:30:44,230 --> 00:30:45,130
Zhenzhen?

710
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,700
Master, long time no see.

711
00:30:50,420 --> 00:30:52,630
I heard from Ke that the company is still recruiting.

712
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,660
So I came.

713
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:55,090
Well,

714
00:30:55,700 --> 00:30:56,900
do you still need me?

715
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,010
Welcome home.

716
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,060
Eighty-two Studio.

717
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:11,700
Extraordinary Works.

718
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:12,700
Get to work.

719
00:31:12,790 --> 00:31:13,640
Let's go.

720
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:18,470
Thank you, Master.

721
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,370
Hello, can I take a look at this one?

722
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:26,950
Okay.

723
00:31:28,790 --> 00:31:29,880
You have good taste.

724
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:30,500
This is

725
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:31,900
our designer piece.

726
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,440
It means eternity and true love.

727
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:35,060
It's very suitable for proposing.

728
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:39,160
What's the circumference of your girlfriend's finger?

729
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:41,620
Finger circumference...

730
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,810
About this size.

731
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,570
Sir,

732
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,740
I suggest you

733
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,100
measure the exact size.

734
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:50,660
Okay.

735
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,500
You're back.

736
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:31,810
You were asleep.

737
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:33,310
So I didn't wake you up.

738
00:33:33,550 --> 00:33:35,440
Have you eaten? How about I cook something for you?

739
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,550
I have. I went to many places today.

740
00:33:38,590 --> 00:33:40,490
I fell asleep because I was tired.

741
00:33:41,230 --> 00:33:41,910
Good job.

742
00:33:42,110 --> 00:33:42,670
How about this?

743
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,600
I'll take you to a big meal tomorrow

744
00:33:44,620 --> 00:33:45,600
to reward you.

745
00:33:49,180 --> 00:33:49,820
Get some more sleep.

746
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,300
What is it?

747
00:34:05,590 --> 00:34:06,230
Nothing.

748
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:07,390
The copper paper. It dropped.

749
00:34:09,230 --> 00:34:10,420
I'll go get changed.

750
00:34:10,449 --> 00:34:11,100
