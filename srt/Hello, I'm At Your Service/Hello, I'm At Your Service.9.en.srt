Mr. Lou.

Why are you here?

8
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:37,990
I...

9
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,150
Well,

10
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,310
I was just passing by.

11
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,340
I was just passing by.

12
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,230
Passing by…

13
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:46,329
Here?

14
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:59,079
Tell me.

15
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,600
It's been so long.

16
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:03,440
Why am I still sad?

17
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,910
That means

18
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:11,760
you haven't completely let it go.

19
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,700
I had already got over him,

20
00:03:18,579 --> 00:03:20,960
but when he showed up again,

21
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:23,600
the past memories

22
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:25,550
all came back.

23
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,600
That period of time to me

24
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:33,740
was special

25
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,079

because

30
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,370
I wanted to say goodbye.

31
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,200

What?

42
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:33,340
I ordered a lot of crabs.

43
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,020
I happen to need someone to accompany me.

44
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:36,540
How can you eat crabs without me?

Look.

00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,030
It's big, juicy and fresh.

50

61

I haven't seen you for days.

62
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,670
You've improved a lot in peeling crabs.

63
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:28,980
It was embarrassing to eat crabs with you last time,

64
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,620
so I learned all the methods of eating crabs

65
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:31,460
after I went back.

66
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:34,010
By the way,

67
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,180
how did you get together with him?

68
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:40,310
We were classmates in college.

69
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:41,480
He was my senior.

70
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,659
We used to do homework together.

71
00:05:43,659 --> 00:05:46,700
Then we got together naturally.

72
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,020
Then he

73
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,290
cheated on me.

74
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:50,780
I didn't expect

75
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,670
he to become the CEO of Xianling.

76

I'm just a customer service representative.

77
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:57,590
But now I figure it out.

78
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,340
I will make myself better,

79
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:01,220
so that I can meet a better person.

80
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:04,030
Actually,

81
00:06:04,050 --> 00:06:06,270
it's good to improve yourself,

82
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:08,680
but a person who really likes you

83
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,190
will choose you

84
00:06:10,210 --> 00:06:11,210
no matter who you are.

85
00:06:11,780 --> 00:06:14,080
He'll make progress with you together.

86
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,620
That's how Ke and the others are.

87
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:26,780
Right.

As the old saying goes, everything has a good side.

109
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:02,410
So one of the most important reasons

110
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,660
why you stayed at Ba'er

111
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:04,900
was you wanted to repay their kindness?

112
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:07,330
There was a reason like that at first,

113
00:08:07,610 --> 00:08:09,000
but now I think

114
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,420
I'd rather be with them

115
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,890
than be with employees from other companies.

116
00:08:13,930 --> 00:08:14,700

as long as I'm with them,

121
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,220
we will become better together.

122
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:26,080

00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:06,020
you are the best client.

385
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:08,400
You are my big client, VIP client.

386
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:08,740
Alright.

387
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:09,420
Best of the clients.

388
00:19:09,420 --> 00:19:10,140
That's enough.

389
00:19:10,420 --> 00:19:11,460
If you're done with your compliments,

390
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:12,310
you can leave now.

391
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,200
This is

392
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,820
a small gift for you.

393
00:19:16,330 --> 00:19:18,000
I'll leave you to it.

394
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:19,440
Go.

395
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,360
Thank you.

396
00:19:23,570 --> 00:19:25,830
Have a good one.

397
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:28,590
Remember to come in three days.

398
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:29,370
Okay.

399
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,960
Did I overthink about Zhang Jiamu?

400
00:19:45,210 --> 00:19:46,900
Why are you laughing so happily?

401
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,600
Let me see.

402
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,340
I'm reading a popular comic called

403
00:19:50,410 --> 00:19:52,380
My Baby Is a Wingman.

404
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,140
Well…

405
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:54,960
The male and female leads are so funny.

406
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:56,850
[Selling products is selling oneself.]

407
00:19:55,020 --> 00:19:56,220
Look how cute he is.

408
00:20:05,270 --> 00:20:08,580
[Selling products is selling oneself.]

409
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:10,080
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

410
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:12,090
I've reviewed your revised proposal.

411
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:13,110
It's still not good.

412
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:13,940
How about this?

413
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:15,710
Come over now.

414
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,540
Let's discuss the problems in the proposal.

415
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:19,090
Now?

416
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:20,060
Yes.

417
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,530
Max, Middle Haihe Road.

418
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:23,460
If you don't come,

419
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,140
you won’t get a penny.

420
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:25,870
Well, Mr. Zhang.

421
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:28,180
It’s not a good place to discuss work.

422
00:20:28,180 --> 00:20:28,900
How about this?

423
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,810
I'll go to your office early morning tomorrow.

424
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:32,200
You have 20 minutes left.

425
00:20:33,310 --> 00:20:34,070
Hey!

426
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:38,800
He's so annoying.

427
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:41,240
What time is it now?

428
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:42,960
Are you okay?

429
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,190
I'm fine.

430
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,560
Well…

431
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:55,530
Hello, Mr. Lou.

432
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:57,850
Cao Ya raised some new requests.

433
00:20:57,870 --> 00:20:58,990
I'll ask Zhu Li to send them to you.

434
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,420
Got it.

435
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:02,750
But I'm going to Max to deliver some documents.

436
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,890
I think I'll be late.

437
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,030
Okay, bye.

438
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:12,410
She's going to a club to deliver documents this late?

439
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,020
Come on. Cheers.

440
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,220
Come on, cheers!

441
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,570
Dance.

442
00:21:51,340 --> 00:21:52,460
Come on, let's drink.

443
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,460
It's all on

444
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:57,020
Mr. Zhang at Table 16.

445
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,180
Everyone, listen to me.

446
00:22:02,270 --> 00:22:04,740
Enjoy yourselves tonight.

447
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:07,340
It's on my secretary.

448
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,100
So he's not forcing me to drink.

449
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:15,930
I'd rather drink.

450
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:19,320
What are you doing?

451
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:22,490
What?

452
00:22:22,870 --> 00:22:25,100
You don't even want me to hug you?

453
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,380
You're drunk.

454
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,210
Let me get you a glass of juice.

455
00:22:29,670 --> 00:22:31,090
I don't like juice.

456
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,170
I like the old ones.

457
00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:35,080
I only like you.

458
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:37,610
Zhang Jiamu, are you tired of acting?

459
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,860
Are you tired of pretending?

460
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:40,790
Do you think all girls will like you

461
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,350
if you pretend to be a hopeless romantic.

462
00:22:42,670 --> 00:22:44,120
Who are you to say that to me?

463
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:46,730
Fine, you're good, right?

464
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:49,940
I heard that Miss Dong is a top customer service representative.

465
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:53,030
Do you know what a customer service representative is?

466
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:57,080
A customer service representative is like a dog to a client.

467
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:58,150
Come on.

468
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,980
Show us.

469
00:23:01,070 --> 00:23:02,230
Don't forget

470
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:05,530
I'm a client to your company.

471
00:23:06,150 --> 00:23:07,910
It's up to me whether I want to change the proposal or not.

472
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:09,650
You don't want this project worth millions?

473
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,620
Some clients are clients,

474
00:23:14,110 --> 00:23:16,580
but others are not even humans.

475
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,630
You're giving a little girl a hard time.

476
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,180
You're so rude.

477
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,290
It's none of your business. Who are you?

478
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:27,780
No wonder

479
00:23:28,130 --> 00:23:30,040
you wouldn't get back together with me.

480
00:23:30,170 --> 00:23:31,810
Seems like you got a new boyfriend.

481
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:41,930
Do you know how much my clothes cost?

482
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:43,440
This is a haute couture.

483
00:23:43,610 --> 00:23:45,130
Italian haute couture.

484
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,380
You can't afford it.

485
00:23:46,610 --> 00:23:48,460
Don't wipe your haute couture anymore.

486
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:49,550
I'll buy you another one.

487
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:54,610
Wipe it.

488
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:56,970
Sorry, I'm late.

489
00:23:59,540 --> 00:24:01,170
Is this the second top client you mentioned?

490
00:24:01,310 --> 00:24:02,150
That's him.

491
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,510
Another one?

492
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,230
Well done, Dong Dong'en.

493
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:07,730
Not bad.

494
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:10,340
Look at you.

495
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:12,410
Stop pretending.

496
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,170
Please show some respect to my girlfriend.

497
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:20,890
By the way,

498
00:24:21,310 --> 00:24:22,950
it's normal to meet a few people

499
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,050
in your life

500
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,930
who waste your hippocampal neurons.

501
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,870
You're so arrogant.

502
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,090
Do you know what this is?

503
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:32,290
Have you seen it?

504
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,520
Patek Philippe.

505
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,970
Open your eyes.

506
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,910
Do you have these shoes?

507
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,140
Do you?

508
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,030
It's a limited edition.

509
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:48,640
Mr. Lou.

510
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,100
I didn't expect you two to get close so fast.

511
00:24:52,390 --> 00:24:54,430
Mr. Su, what a coincidence.

512
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,920
Right, Mr. Lou.

513
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,260
We met again.

514
00:24:58,230 --> 00:24:59,690
You're really everywhere.

515
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,340
You too.

516
00:25:02,590 --> 00:25:03,550
Let's go.

517
00:25:04,580 --> 00:25:05,340
Okay.

518
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,050
Mr. Lou, he even wanted me to pay for his bill.

519
00:25:11,070 --> 00:25:12,550
He was literally dreaming.

520
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,830
I'm glad you're fine.

521
00:25:22,090 --> 00:25:24,240
Dong Dong'en, listen.

522
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,740
You're losing us.

523
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:26,700
The contract is terminated.

524
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,690
Your proposal is too bad.

525
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:30,290
We can't use it at all.

526
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,180
I don't mind letting the whole industry

527
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:33,500
know your company's incapability.

528
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:35,140
If you don't care

529
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,650
your company's reputation,

530
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,990
you can ask me for the penalty.

531
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:45,960
Wait for me.

532
00:25:49,610 --> 00:25:51,400
Mr. Su is really everywhere.

533
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:52,560
What do you want?

534
00:25:52,850 --> 00:25:53,570
Mr. Lou.

535
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:55,400
You're wrong about me.

536
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,820
I just had a drink with my colleagues after work.

537
00:25:57,850 --> 00:25:58,990
I happened to see Miss Dong in trouble,

538
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:00,500
so I came up to help.

539
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,270
Why are you so nervous?

540
00:26:02,650 --> 00:26:04,810
It's normal to have some business at work,

541
00:26:05,070 --> 00:26:05,950
but I hope

542
00:26:05,980 --> 00:26:07,620
this wouldn't expand to her personal life.

543
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,010
Of course.

544
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,720
Aren't we always competing against each other fairly?

545
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,630
I don't understand what you mean.

546
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
I mean it literally.

547
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,440
Thank you, Mr. Su.

548
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,010
The juice is delicious.

549
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,830
Mrs. Wang, do you have bud buns?

550
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:32,640
Yes.

551
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,000
I've packed for you.

552
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,030
Take it yourself.

553
00:26:35,050 --> 00:26:35,810
-I'm busy now.
-Okay.

554
00:26:36,390 --> 00:26:37,440
Wait a minute.

555
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:40,000
What happened to your clothes?

556
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,870
I accidentally spilled the juice

557
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:44,050
on it.

558
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,760
You'll get cold in this.

559
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,710
You're so careless.

560
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:48,820
How about this?

561
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,390
I'll get you clothes to change.

562
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,070
Don't worry.

563
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:53,900
I just washed it.

564
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:55,240
Although the size is a little big,

565
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,580
it's better than wearing wet clothes.

566
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,100
There you go.

567
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,940
Thank you.

568
00:26:58,110 --> 00:26:58,740
You're welcome

[Fresh Food for Good Buns]

570
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:03,230
You don't know how to take care of yourself.

571

Hello, Mr. Lou.

Mr. Lou.

784

We don't know what you like,

785
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:41,010
so we just ordered.

786
00:35:41,030 --> 00:35:44,050
But the food here is very good,

787
00:35:44,210 --> 00:35:45,610
especially the roasted duck

788
00:35:45,630 --> 00:35:47,690
It's roasted with fruitwood and charcoal.

789
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,250
It's tender inside and crispy on the outside.

790
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:52,900
And the steak is very delicious.

791
00:35:52,930 --> 00:35:54,510
I'm sure she'll like it.

792
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:56,040
Mr. Liu, it's so nice of you.

793

We agreed

00:35:56,980 --> 00:35:58,010
a simple meal is okay.

795
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,030
That won't do.

796
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:01,340
I must make sure you're happy.

00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
I hope

there's a chance

803
00:36:18,140 --> 00:36:19,700
that I can learn more from you two.

804
00:36:20,220 --> 00:36:23,180
You young people should communicate more

805
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:25,140
if you have common topics.

806
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,380
Ms. Yuan has been in charge of Xianling

00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:32,200
You're really successful on family and career.

810

Mr. Lou, I'm flattered.

813
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,110
have a lot to learn

814
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:40,850
from you.

815
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,610
Right.

816
00:36:42,110 --> 00:36:45,270

Well,

we're not in a hurry.

We'd spend some time dating.

821
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,290
No hurry.

822
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:59,490

823
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:01,500
you young people want to focus on career first.

824

But

825

I've been through this.

826
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,140
I have the right to speak.

827
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:07,990
If you want to start a career,

828
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:09,370
you must get married first.

830

when I was young,

831
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:14,510
then I could spend all my time

832
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:16,060
on work.

833
00:37:16,650 --> 00:37:17,970
So you young people

834
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:19,200
should really hurry up.

835
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:20,980
In that case,

836
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:23,090
we should learn from Ms. Yuan.

837
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:26,970
It’s a pity.

838
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:28,740
Although they're young,

839
00:37:28,910 --> 00:37:31,180
they have ruined

840
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,020
their health.

841
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,640
They can't get pregnant even if they want.

842
00:37:34,900 --> 00:37:37,240
That's why I talked too much today.

843
00:37:37,450 --> 00:37:38,660
-I advise you to hurry up.
-Mom.

844
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,530
