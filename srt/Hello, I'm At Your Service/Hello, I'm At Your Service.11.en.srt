564
00:24:47,370 --> 00:24:50,280
How can I stand it?

565
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:07,140
Then move your right foot backward.

566
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,310
Come on. Move your right foot forward.

567
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:11,390
Right. Move backward again.

568
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:12,660
I know how to do this.

569
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,180
You know how to do this?

570
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,260
Come on. Move backward again.

571
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,660
Make a circle.

572
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:21,650
What are you doing?

573
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:22,580
-Let me go!
-What's wrong?

574
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:23,720
Aren't you my girlfriend?

575
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,220
What's wrong with kissing and hugging you?

576
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:27,090
Who is your girlfriend?

577
00:25:27,370 --> 00:25:29,150
We've been chatting for so long. Are you kidding me?

578
00:25:30,350 --> 00:25:31,980
What are you doing? Help!

579
00:25:33,750 --> 00:25:35,190
-Let go!
-Let go!

580
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,190
You pushed me?

581
00:25:39,090 --> 00:25:40,000
You pushed me.

582
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:41,550
-You pushed me.
-Stop! Stop!

583
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:42,380
-You pushed me.
-Stop!

584
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,340
-You pushed me.
-Stop!

585
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:47,980
I'll call the security guards if you beat him again.

586
00:25:49,730 --> 00:25:50,760
-Stop!
-Loser.

587
00:25:51,460 --> 00:25:52,220
Get lost!

588
00:25:54,070 --> 00:25:55,030
Are you okay?

589
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,020
Are you okay? Get up.

590
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:57,640
Get up.

591
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:04,900
Let me see.

592
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:08,410
Why did you do that if you are not good at fighting?

593
00:26:08,550 --> 00:26:09,760
If someone bullies you,

594
00:26:10,010 --> 00:26:11,920
I will do my best to protect you. Whatever it takes.

595
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:13,990
Let me see.

596
00:26:15,710 --> 00:26:16,810
You fool.

597
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,550
You're bleeding.

598
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,930
Hang in there.

599
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:23,730
Come on.

600
00:26:26,930 --> 00:26:28,660
Why... Why did you drink so much?

601
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:31,030
Lou,

602
00:26:31,720 --> 00:26:33,800
help me up.

603
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:38,100
What's going on?

604
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,220
Are they Lou Yuan and En?

605
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,530
Just keep our voice down.

606
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:44,620
Your proposal is not good.

607
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,450
What do we need?

608
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:49,300
We need temperament.

609
00:26:49,390 --> 00:26:51,500
Don't ask me what temperament is.

610
00:26:51,650 --> 00:26:53,770
You need to feel it.

611
00:26:53,910 --> 00:26:56,580
Feel it with your heart.

612
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,760
-Okay.
-Did you hear that?

613
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,540
Boom. Boom. Boom.

614
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:00,980
Okay.

615
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,320
I'll revise the next draft

616
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:04,230
for Miss Dong, okay?

617
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,480
That's right.

618
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,010
Let me tell you.

619
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:09,200
And black

620
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:10,610
is not really black.

621
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:16,240
Behind black is enchanting pink

622
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,620
and splendid gold.

623
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:18,180
Yes.

624
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,620
They are so funny.

625
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:21,330
Don't worry about them.

626
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:23,340
Let me tell you something serious.

627
00:27:24,980 --> 00:27:27,460
Let's... be together.

628
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:33,900
Are you serious?

629
00:27:34,370 --> 00:27:35,120
Yes.

630
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:38,620
Then this is the end.

631
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,300
Ke.

632
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,380

Look at you.

635
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,110
If you are not good at drinking,

636
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,850
why did you drink so much?

637
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:06,370
You drink as much as you can just because the wine is free?

638
00:28:07,130 --> 00:28:09,490
-We were invited here.
-Lou,

639
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:10,940
Do you understand?

640
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,580
are you happy today?

641
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,220
You can't risk your lives because of wine, right?

642
00:28:14,300 --> 00:28:15,340
-Let me tell you.
-Ke.

643
00:28:15,340 --> 00:28:16,620
Next time,

644
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:17,860
we'll sing the Song of Lou.

645
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:20,540
Lou. Lou.

646
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,260
-Mr. Lou, she...
-We love you.

647
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:22,940
She's drunk.

648
00:28:24,810 --> 00:28:25,340
Lou?

649
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,300
Hua.

650
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:29,770
What's wrong with them?

651
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:30,500
They're drunk too.

652
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:31,920
Fatty.

653
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:32,720
Be careful.

654
00:28:33,490 --> 00:28:34,620
Fatty.

Wake up!

658
00:28:37,540 --> 00:28:39,730
-Why did you fall asleep?
-Sorry.

659
00:28:40,180 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm gonna take her home first.

660

Okay.

661

Come on. One, two.

662
00:28:42,930 --> 00:28:44,900
Did she do anything bad to you?

663
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,960
What bad things can I do to him?

664
00:28:46,990 --> 00:28:48,550
Am I that kind of person?

665
00:28:49,050 --> 00:28:52,370
Hua, you really don't know me.

666
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,560
Right, Lou?

667
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:54,350
Yes. Yes.

668
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:55,140
Take care of them.

669
00:28:55,140 --> 00:28:56,060
I'm gonna take her home first.

You collided with me!

674
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,770
All of you are drunk.

675
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:36,020
Hello?

676
00:29:36,020 --> 00:29:37,140
Hai, where are you?

677

It's urgent.

678
00:29:38,810 --> 00:29:40,690
Go downstairs of your house to take En home.

679
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:43,040
She's drunk, and Mr. Lou has taken her home.

680
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:44,300
What happened?

681
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:45,620
This is what happens when En is drunk.

682
00:29:45,620 --> 00:29:46,500
Getting drunk, vomiting, talking nonsense,

683
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,740
and hitting people violently. Go now. Hurry.

684
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,100
Okay.

685

We're here.

694
00:30:25,970 --> 00:30:27,190
Why are you looking at me?

695
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,060
Lou.

696
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,660
Don't move.

697
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:36,030
This is it. You look a little handsome from this angle.

698
00:30:37,690 --> 00:30:38,590
This angle?

699
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:41,950
Very handsome. You're like...

700
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:44,830
like...

701
00:30:45,040 --> 00:30:47,770
like the one on the US dollars.

702
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,460
Don't move. Turn your face away a little.

703
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,160
Please.

704
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:53,870
He's a little bald. Very handsome.

705

I'm not bald, right?

706
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:57,110
You are not bald.

707
00:30:58,500 --> 00:30:59,640
Well...

708
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,770

when I'm with you every day.

712
00:31:11,730 --> 00:31:13,450
Is it because you look like him?

713
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:24,330
Are you so happy every day because of money

714
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:26,470
or the person on the money?

715
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
It depends on how much it is.

716
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,610
100 yuan is definitely not enough.

717
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:35,050
200 yuan. 300 yuan.

718
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,620
