6
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,100
So the truth is Su Qi and Lan Zhenzhen

7
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:43,340
colluded with each other.

8
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,820
Lan Zhenzhen delivered the supplementary agreement

9
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,620
to Su Qi.

10
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:46,900
And what you have

11
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:48,580
is the original high-amount compensation contract.

12
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,509
But we have some chat histories on WeChat.

13
00:01:53,550 --> 00:01:55,470
They can be used as evidence, right?

14
00:01:56,060 --> 00:01:57,190
Yes,

15
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,750
but they are not very convincing.

16
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,280
Judging from the current situation,

17
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,780
I don't recommend you to institute a countersuit.

18
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,470
It's best to reach a settlement.

19
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,680
If you don't,

20
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,199
you're very likely to go bankrupt.

21
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,590
Besides, the lawsuit fee is actually not low.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,350
If you lose,

23
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:17,100
it will be worse.

24
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,220
So there are only two options.

25
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:21,840
First, compensate them according to the original contract.

26
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:24,160
Second, dissolve your company.

27
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:26,860
Is there no third option?

28
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:30,110
From what I know about Su Qi,

29
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,480
he won't just let it go.

30
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,670
So

31
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,140
you may only have one option:

32
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,210
compensating them.

33
00:02:35,829 --> 00:02:37,780
But we don't have any money.

34
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,670
Is Eighty-two Studio going to be dissolved just like this?

35
00:02:41,270 --> 00:02:43,100
Su Qi did that to you because of me.

36
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:44,680
So I'm also responsible.

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:47,550
I'll pay the money.

38
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,860
It's not your fault. It's Su Qi's fault.

39
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:52,020
I know you care about me.

40
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:53,470
But you can't pay the money.

41
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,960
Eighty-two Studio is also responsible.

42
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:58,780
My legal consciousness is weak,

43
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,480
so I let Su Qi take advantage of us.

44
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:03,040
Don't blame yourself.

45
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,030

No matter what difficulties and setbacks we face,

51
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,310
we should face them together.

52

Besides, Ke got hurt

53

54
00:03:23,050 --> 00:03:25,390

00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,510
I want to try based on my ideas.

189
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:50,520
Our family has a company.

190
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:51,990
But you want to start your own business

191
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:53,690
instead of learning to manage our company.

192
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,900
Han Chun,

193
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,710
you don't feel comfortable if you don't disobey me, right?

194
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:59,470
Dad, I'm not disobeying you.

195
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:01,060
I know you made great efforts

196
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:02,660
to make Han's Group

197
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:04,240
become a large company with thousands of people

198
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:06,310
from a small company with only dozens of people.

199
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,220
And I know

200
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:09,700
how hard it was.

201
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,810
But this is not what I want.

202
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,710
What you want

203
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,000
is to start your own business.

204
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,230
Do you know how hard it is to start from scratch?

205
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,460
I want to try no matter how hard it is.

206
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,680
I won't know until I try.

207
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:24,150
Dad, I don't want to stay

208
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,810
in the so-called comfort zone you created for me.

209
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,610
I've been there for too long.

210
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:30,060
I want to try my best

211
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,700
and see how far I can go.

212
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,050
No need to say anything more.

213
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,050
I won't allow you to do that.

214
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:36,340
As the successor of Han's Group,

215
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:39,560
it's your responsibility to learn to manage the company.

216
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,200
Dad,

217
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,290
I've always listened to you.

218
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,260
I learned everything you asked me to learn.

219
00:10:49,890 --> 00:10:51,340
I did everything you asked me to do.

220
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:53,180
I didn't like many of them,

221
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,740
but I've never gone against your will.

222
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,800
But the older I am, the more I have realized

223
00:10:57,930 --> 00:10:59,460
what I like is really different

224
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,560
from what you like.

225
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:03,120
I don't like this job either.

226
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,660
No matter what, I want to try this time.

227
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:08,180
I want to live for myself once.

228
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:10,340
I want to go out to try

229
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,380
with my like-minded friends.

230
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,390
I want to do what I like.

231
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:16,640
Han Chun,

232
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,920
if you dare to leave here today,

233
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,300
don't blame me for not acknowledging you as my son.

234
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,650
Why are you here?

235
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,040
It's Chinese New Year.

236
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,280
I'm worried.

237
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,820
I came here to check if they've shut off water and electricity.

238
00:11:53,790 --> 00:11:54,930
Why are you here?

239
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,050
The same reason as yours.

240
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,020
I'm hungry.

241
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:04,330
It's Chinese New Year. Don't eat instant noodles.

242
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:06,530
I'm gonna see if there's anything to eat in the fridge.

243
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,650
Where did you get the dumplings?

244
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,330
This is a coincidence.

245
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,010
Let's have dumplings on Chinese New Year.

246
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:25,560
Just make do with this.

247
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,710
Your urticaria

248
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,170
and vomiting you mentioned

249
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,060
are mostly caused by psychological reasons.

250
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,560
Relax, and you will recover gradually.

251
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,230
Is there any medicine that can relieve the symptoms?

252
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:50,790
How about this?

253
00:13:51,090 --> 00:13:53,470
I'll prescribe some medicine for you to take and apply.

254
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,640
But you can't take it for a long time.

255
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,680
It contains hormones.

256
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:04,060
Honey, you're here.

257
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,540
I'll be here after getting changed.

258
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:06,720
Wait for me.

259
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,960
It's not that I don't want to be with you.

260
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:24,690
I have mysophobia.

261
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,020
I'm not unreasonable. I'm sick.

262
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:27,100
It's a physical reaction.

263
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:29,480
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't like it.

264
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,290
Give me some time.

265
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,430
It can definitely be cured.

266
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:49,870
Check it

267
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:51,100
and send the result to my email.

268
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,870
If he finds out,

269
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,470
you know what to do, right?

270
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:57,780
Okay.

271
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,860
Why didn't you tell me you are here?

272
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,930
Su,

273
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:10,610
what are you busy with?

274
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:12,820
Have a seat.

275
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,900
I'm not busy.

276
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:16,970
Something like contacting regular clients

277
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,480
to have dinner together.

278
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:20,590
Nothing important.

279
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:22,930
What I'm good at is only drinking.

280
00:15:23,160 --> 00:15:25,270
I know you are good at drinking.

281
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,650
I still remember

282
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,490
when we first met at a banquet,

283
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,020
you did your best.

284
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:32,710
I was drunk.

285
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,680
At that time, I thought

286
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,540
this young man was ruthless.

287
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:41,220
I'm a businessman.

288
00:15:41,430 --> 00:15:43,220
Drinking wine is normal.

289
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,260
But I'm not always the winner.

290
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,350
Lou Yuan is the only one better at drinking than me.

291
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:49,110
What a pity.

292
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:52,100
I wanted to prepare a sideshow for him.

293
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,220
You mean your trap?

294
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,520
That's nothing.

295
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,200
I've

296
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:05,050
prepared a better sideshow for him.

297
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,210
As long as he falls into your trap,

298
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:08,910
I promise

299
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:11,340
he will wake up at the police station the next day

300
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:12,050
and find something

301
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:14,310
that he can't even explain on himself.

302
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:15,540
Unfortunately,

303
00:16:17,270 --> 00:16:18,670
you failed.

304
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,120
I know.

305
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,420
You should know

306
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,240
you're no longer useful to me.

307
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:35,070
Get lost while I'm in a good mood.

308
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:39,090
Stop thinking about

309
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,970
getting the goods on me.

310
00:16:44,430 --> 00:16:47,880
This kind of trick is nothing to me.

311
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:50,980
Remember,

312
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:54,900
always stay one step ahead of others.

313
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:56,190
Understand?

314
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,280
You'd better take a leave.

315
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,950
Old bastard.

316
00:17:13,190 --> 00:17:13,910
Please, Mr. Wang.

317
00:17:13,930 --> 00:17:15,079
Please. Please.

318
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,660
We are very sincere.

319
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:18,380
This time, we really need this opportunity.

320
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:18,859
Besides,

321
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:21,260
I... You can't ignore our friendship, right?

322
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:21,900
Right, Mr. Wang?

323
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:23,490
We had great collaborations.

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:23,980
Hello?

325
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:33,190
I've contacted all the companies we know.

326
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,990
There is a rumor in the industry

327
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,290
that we did something bad in bidding.

328
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:39,780
So those who wanted to cooperate with us

329
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,440
are not willing to contact us.

330
00:17:44,070 --> 00:17:46,330
What about those who haven't given us the final payment?

331
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:47,540
They're avoiding us.

332
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,330
Now they are seizing the chance to take advantage of us.

333
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:52,580
If this continues,

334
00:17:53,590 --> 00:17:54,400
things will be difficult.

335
00:17:55,350 --> 00:17:56,450
I guess

336
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:58,800
Dongshi knew we couldn't afford the compensation long ago.

337
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:01,020
So they are waiting for us to take this step.

338
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:04,430
What should we do now?

339
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:06,900
Let's institute a countersuit.

340
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,400
It can't be worse.

341
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:11,590
If we institute a countersuit,

342
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:15,120
we can have time to think of other ways

343
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:16,650
and raise money.

344
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,150
Sue them.

345
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,570
Let's sue them.

346
00:18:21,790 --> 00:18:23,130
We can't let them bully us.

347
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:28,990
Fatty,

348
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:31,200
why are you putting away your precious things?

349
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:34,330
I... I just think

350
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,270
I don't like these now.

351
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,490
I'm putting them away in case they get dusty.

352
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,470
Tell me the truth.

353
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,470
Do you want to sell them

354
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,840
to raise money for the company?

355
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,420
No, I just think

356
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,000
many of them are new.

357
00:18:51,030 --> 00:18:52,380
I barely touched them.

358
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,430
Selling them can make a lot of money.

359
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,490
But these are your favorite things.

360
00:18:57,510 --> 00:18:58,470
How can you sell them?

361
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,100
There will be a solution to the company's problem.

362
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:03,630
We can raise enough money.

363
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:05,210
It's okay.

364
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,470
These things...

365
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,900
When Ke comes back,

366
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,540
I can ask him to buy them again after the company survives the crisis.

367
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:10,260
Right, Trouble Ma?

368
00:19:12,290 --> 00:19:13,200
Where's Trouble Ma?

369
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:14,890
Why didn't he come to the company today?

370
00:19:15,230 --> 00:19:17,620
[Made in China]

371
00:19:38,470 --> 00:19:39,610
Are you leaving today?

372
00:19:48,170 --> 00:19:49,720

559
00:30:40,290 --> 00:30:42,480
broke up with Hai.

560
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:44,770
And En.

561
00:30:45,330 --> 00:30:46,870
She has been suffering from cyberbullying for many days

562
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,940
because of Mr. Lou.

563
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,450
She's almost depressed.

564
00:30:52,310 --> 00:30:53,690
These keyboard warriors

565
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:55,290
are bold enough to say whatever they want.

566
00:30:57,860 --> 00:31:00,180
They said En is a canary.

567
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,190
And they said something worse.

568
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,740
Do they know who En is?

569
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:05,870
Do they know her?

570
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:08,130
When I saw these every day, I...

571
00:31:12,160 --> 00:31:13,800
All right, I'm not telling you this.

572
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,480
I guess you won't be happy to hear it.

573
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:16,450
Right?

574
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,570
I know you've felt guilty towards them

575
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,970
these years.

576
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:31,700
Yes.

577
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:34,830
The company didn't make much money these years.

578
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:38,520
But they don't think so.

579
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,110
They are grateful to you.

580
00:31:42,920 --> 00:31:44,560
Without you,

581
00:31:44,930 --> 00:31:46,260
Eighty-two Studio wouldn't have existed

582
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,300
and we wouldn't have had

583
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:50,420
so many good memories.

584
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:53,580
Especially me.

585
00:31:56,710 --> 00:31:58,260
Without you,

586
00:32:00,230 --> 00:32:03,870
I would have obeyed my parents' wish

587
00:32:04,340 --> 00:32:06,150
to marry a girl

588
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:09,710
who they think is a good match for me and have a baby with her.

589
00:32:10,430 --> 00:32:11,470
And then

590
00:32:12,300 --> 00:32:14,290
according to their plan,

591
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:16,200
I would have inherited the family business

592
00:32:17,630 --> 00:32:20,750
and spent my whole life in the way they want.

593
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,830
It's like a puppet's life.

594
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:31,780
I would be pathetic if I live like that, right?

595
00:32:38,510 --> 00:32:39,300
Ke,

596
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:41,470
thank you.

597
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,820
Thank you for telling me

598
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:47,720
that people should live for themselves.

599
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,660
And thank you

600
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:52,340
for letting me meet so many lovely people.

601
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:55,510
Don't worry.

602
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,870
In your absence,

603
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,330
I will protect them.

604
00:33:24,060 --> 00:33:24,970
The chicken soup is ready.

605
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,190
Why did you fall asleep on the sofa?

606
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,650
It smells so good.

607
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:33,350
Your favorite fish maw chicken soup.

608
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:35,370
Get up and eat some.

609
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:36,790
Don't leave your stomach empty.

610
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,040
But now I don't have the strength to get up.

611
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,010
No strength?

612
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:42,600
It's okay.

613
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:44,480
Let me feed you.

614
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:47,980
Come on. Get up.

615
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:51,660
Come on.

616
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:52,340
You're so nice.

617
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:55,570
Don't burn yourself.

618
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,270
Here.

619
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,080
How does it taste?

620
00:34:04,060 --> 00:34:04,710
Is it good?

621
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:06,770
One more sip.

622
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:07,960
Is it hot?

623
00:34:08,130 --> 00:34:09,170
No, it's not hot.

624
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:12,159
Do you want more?

625
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:16,300
Well,

626
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,699
if only everything

627
00:34:17,699 --> 00:34:19,820
could be as simple as eating.

628
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,489
Think about this.

629
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,489
When I was not with you,

630
00:34:26,699 --> 00:34:27,780
you were not as happy as you are now.

631
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:29,270
Isn't that sadder?

632
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,960
I don't want to think about the past.

633
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:35,929
But life was really hard back then.

634
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:37,920
Okay, let's not think about the past.

635
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,679
Everything that happened before has become bygones.

636
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:40,780
Don't take it to heart.

637
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,159
But considering what happened to Eighty-two Studio,

638
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,300
I really think

639
00:34:45,300 --> 00:34:46,949
it's not a problem

640
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,550
that I can solve.

641
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:50,380
Do you want to hear

642
00:34:50,380 --> 00:34:52,370
professional opinions from a professional?

643
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,460
Actually, it's very simple.

644
00:34:57,620 --> 00:34:59,760
Just find someone who's willing to invest

645
00:34:59,790 --> 00:35:00,630
in Eighty-two Studio.

646
00:35:01,830 --> 00:35:03,200
I know.

647
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:03,980
But...

648
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:09,320
No.

649
00:35:10,330 --> 00:35:11,660
Why not?

650
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:13,220
You are my girlfriend.

651
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:14,400
We are engaged.

652
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:17,180
If you still don't want me to help you at your most difficult time,

653
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:18,470
that looks like you're not treating me as your boyfriend, right?

654
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:20,800
That's not true.

655
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,160
I can't mix work with private matters.

656
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,580
This is Eighty-two Studio's own problem.

657
00:35:23,610 --> 00:35:24,050
How...

658
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:25,350
How can I let you take the responsibility?

659
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,020
Why... Why is it your own problem?

660
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,440
I... I mean

661
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:30,350
I'll help you get through this first.

662
00:35:30,550 --> 00:35:32,050
After that,

663
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:33,700
you can repay me through your performance.

664
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,590
It's the same, right?

665
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:35,520
No.

666
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:39,050
You already helped us once last time.

667
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:41,970
I can't ask you for help whenever I'm in trouble.

668
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:45,190
If so, I'll become more dependent on you

669
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:46,710
and become unlike myself.

670
00:35:50,140 --> 00:35:52,060
Why?

671
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,210

Alright.

Don't be angry. Don't be angry.

I know what you're thinking.

Don't worry. I won't do anything stupid.

681
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:14,760
I'll think of another way.

682
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,120
Don't give us money.

683
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:22,300
Okay, I won't.

you came so early. It's not working hours yet.
