I thought he was a good backer.

188
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,980
I didn't expect him to be an unreliable backer.

189
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:36,060
En.

190
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,920
You have to maintain a good relationship with the other backer, Mr. Lou.

191
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:42,230
Tell him my love and longing for him.

192
00:07:42,280 --> 00:07:43,159
Don't worry.

[Dongshi Design]

194
00:07:54,990 --> 00:07:58,100
Mr. Su, the people of Eighty-two Studio are determined to terminate the contract.

195
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,130
They insisted on quitting the project.

196
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:01,040
Have you signed the termination contract?

197
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:01,930
Yes.

198
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,820
After it's sent to me tomorrow, it'll be effective.

[Dongshi Design]

200
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:04,900
In that case,

201
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:05,700
accept it.

202
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:09,060
Shall I do it according to our previous plan?

203
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:11,640
No hurry.

204
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:13,110
It's not the time yet.

205
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,530
Yes. I'm packing up.

206
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:28,670
I've booked a flight which will take off at 9:10.

207
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,620
I'm sure I can catch up with the trying of the makeup look.

208
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,380
Don't worry.

209
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,299
It's my duty.

210
00:08:33,299 --> 00:08:34,390
It's not hard work for me.

211
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,740
Okay. See you tonight.

212
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,390
Okay.

213
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,880
Okay. Bye.

214
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:42,039
Dear.

215
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:45,570
I'm going to join the film crew.

216
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:46,910
Are you leaving tonight?

217
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:48,060
So hurriedly?

218
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,640
Yes, the producer called me this afternoon,

219
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:52,780
and said that the original actress' schedules contradicted one another.

220
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,290
Then he selected me.

221
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,700
It's seven o'clock. I need to pack up at once.

222
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,680
I need up pack up at once.

223
00:09:00,830 --> 00:09:01,630
Kewei,

224
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,440
is this film crew reliable?

225
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,540
I've heard that a proper crew is very strict

226
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,570
when they select actors.

227
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,340
They wouldn't change the actors so easily.

228
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,500
Besides, I've never heard about

229
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,040
going out to try the makeup look in the middle of the night.

230
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:22,940
Recently, there is often some news disclosed on the Internet,

231
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:25,340
and it says some people cheated others out of their money in the name of filming, right?

232
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,500
What if...

233
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,780
Ma Chengshu, what do you mean?

234
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,190
Are you looking down on me that much?

235
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:32,230
No.

236
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,650
Kewei, I'm not looking down on you.

237
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,780
That's not what I mean. I'm just worried that...

238
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,690
I'm not very good with words. Don't be angry.

239
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,450
It's okay.

240
00:09:43,930 --> 00:09:45,130
I can understand.

241
00:09:46,210 --> 00:09:48,270
I also didn't expect that I would be chosen.

242
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,220
But this is an opportunity.

243
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:51,510
I don't want to give it up.

244
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,990
Whether it's a scam or not,

245
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,350
I have to give it a try.

246
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,070
You're right.

247
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,170
Whether it's good or bad,

248
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,540
we should still experience it personally.

249
00:10:05,910 --> 00:10:06,880
If you miss me,

250
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,910
send me a video or call me.

251
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:09,860
I'll wait for you to come back.

252
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,190
I'll just play a small role this time.

253
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,740
I'll be back soon.

254
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,780
Okay.

255
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:20,370
You'll be late if you don't pack your luggage fast.

256
00:10:20,370 --> 00:10:21,580
Let me pack your luggage with you.

257
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:34,480
Why are you also taking summer clothes?

258
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:37,880
I'm afraid I might need them on some occasions. Just in case.

259
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,860
It's so sweet.

260
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:50,660
Mom, stop it.

261
00:10:51,230 --> 00:10:52,150
-Do you want to eat it? -No.

262
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,140
Daughter.

263
00:10:54,610 --> 00:10:55,480
Well,

264
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,770
I've signed up for a travel group with your mom.

265
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,000
We're leaving tomorrow.

266
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,290
Well, why are you leaving so soon?

267
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,440
Why don't you stay for a few more days?

268
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,370
We've been here for so long.

269
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,980
You are always busy.

270
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,260
You either stay with us or work.

271
00:11:06,260 --> 00:11:07,230
It's too tiring for you.

272
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,060
I just want to spend more time with you.

273
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:10,370
Besides, I'm not tired at all.

274
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,830
Look, Mom. You're the one who is doing all the chores.

275
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,900
That's the point.

276
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:15,340
We've really signed up for it.

277
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:15,830
Yes.

278
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,940
Your dad and I

279
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,980
have to spend some time alone.

280
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:21,540
I see.

281
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,620
Alright.

282
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:25,620
You two should spend some time alone.

283
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,380
Lou Yuan and I will see you off tomorrow.

284
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,510
No, no, no.

285
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,190
You don't need to worry about it. Neither of you should see us off.

286
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,320
We'll leave by ourselves.

287
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:39,620
Dad.

288
00:11:40,870 --> 00:11:43,730
Do you still not like Lou Yuan?

289
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:46,980
He's different from other bosses.

290
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:50,430
He's quite simple and frugal.

291
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,680
He's nice, too.

292
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:54,660
No.

293
00:11:56,130 --> 00:11:57,940
You've thought too much, silly girl.

294
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:59,260
Lou is good.

295
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,350
I mean it. He's good.

296
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:01,490
Ask your mom.

297
00:12:01,530 --> 00:12:03,250
-He's good. -We both like him.

298
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,500
Dad.

299
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,100
Tell me the truth.

300
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,370
To tell you the truth, I still think that he's good.

301
00:12:09,010 --> 00:12:10,810
As parents,

302
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,210
we just hope that our child

303
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:14,440
can be a capable person,

304
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:16,150
and be confident,

305
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,240
without being bullied by others outside.

306
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:19,690
Of course,

307
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:21,450
your mom and I will give you

308
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,740
spiritual support.

309
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,620
But materially,

310
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,380
what is the most important thing

311
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:30,260
when a man and a woman are together?

312
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:33,280
The social ranks of their families should be equal, right?

313
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:35,340
The couple should be able to move forward side by side.

314
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,970
Neither of them should be superior to the other.

315
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:40,030
But the gap between you two

316
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,080
is just too big.

317
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:44,920
If he really bullies you one day,

318
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:45,940
your mom and I will have no idea

319
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,620
how to teach him a lesson for you.

320
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,300
Right?

321
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:49,710
Yes.

322
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:52,820
Baby,

323
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:57,220
your dad thought so much.

324
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,580
But it's for your own good.

325
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,050
I'm quite satisfied

326
00:13:03,440 --> 00:13:04,730
with Lou.

327
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,790
After all, in the future,

328
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,580
you'll be the one who lives with him.

329
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,480
I respect your choice.

330
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,940
Dad, actually, I knowt that

331
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,700
you've thought so much just for my own good.

332
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,210
I also know that, just as you said,

333
00:13:23,140 --> 00:13:24,930
there's a huge gap between us.

334
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,740
I've thought about that, too.

335
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,340
But...

336
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:31,010
But I just want to be with him.

337
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:32,680
I just like him.

338
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:36,790
Being with him makes me very happy.

339
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:41,400
Actually, I didn't think too much about the future.

340
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:44,140
I just want to live an ordinary life

341
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,420
and get down to earth.

342
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,610
Besides, I believe that

343
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,100
we can live a good life.

344
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,050
Are you sure?

345
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:02,400
Are you sure?

346
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,050
Okay.

347
00:14:09,780 --> 00:14:10,260
Okay.

348
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,500
Let Lou see us off tomorrow.

349
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,730
Lou is good.

[Wonderful Space] [Twin Buildings]

351
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:50,650
Zhenzhen.

352
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,040
This is the termination agreement.

353
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:52,920
There are two copies.

354
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,480
One should be kept on file and the other should be sent to Dongshi.

355
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,430
I've asked the courier to come. He's downstairs.

356
00:14:56,670 --> 00:14:58,150
Please give it to him.

357
00:14:58,190 --> 00:14:58,670
Okay.

358
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:01,380
So this is over?

359
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:03,540
Great!

360
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:06,090
I don't have to stay up late to revise the manuscript anymore.

361
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:13,620
What's wrong, Zhenzhen?

362
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,140
Is there anything wrong with the contract?

363
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,020
No.

364
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:17,470
Well, I'll go send it.

What's wrong with this girl?

367
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,020
She's been acting weird lately.

368
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,170
We don't understand the things of young people.

Do you think something wrong happened?

370

00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:49,770
Whether you're yummy or not,

557
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:51,970
I won't know until I taste you.

558
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:57,620
Not bad.

559
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,490
Don't move.

560
00:23:44,900 --> 00:23:46,710
Well, have you told Zhuang?

561
00:23:46,820 --> 00:23:47,730
Yes.

562
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:49,300
Don't worry. I've arranged everything.

563
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,490
An is here.

564
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:57,600
An.

565
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,300
An.

566
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,060
Ms. Chairwoman.

567
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:02,000
I miss you so much.

568
00:24:02,410 --> 00:24:04,560
This is a small gift I've brought back from abroad.

569
00:24:04,590 --> 00:24:05,630
It's for you.

570
00:24:05,660 --> 00:24:07,060
Look at you.

571
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:09,210
I'm happy that you're here.

572
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:11,410
You didn't have have to bring a gift. You're too kind.

573
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,230
Come on. Have a seat.

574
00:24:12,260 --> 00:24:12,990
Okay.

575
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,320
Dan,

576
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:19,190
An has just come back from abroad.

577
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,820
She has wanted to see you.

578
00:24:20,950 --> 00:24:23,000
She came here as soon as she got off the plane.

579
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,840
I was too reckless.

580
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:25,540
Ms. Chairwoman,

581
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:27,580
I came here so late at night. Have I hindered you from your rest?

582
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:28,820
No, no.

583
00:24:28,950 --> 00:24:30,580
Why are you still calling me Ms. Chairwoman?

584
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:31,550
Just call me Aunt Lou as you

585
00:24:31,620 --> 00:24:32,620
used to do in childhood.

586
00:24:33,380 --> 00:24:34,790
Okay, Aunt Lou.

587
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,760
You are so tall

588
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:40,990
and so pretty, An.

589
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:42,730
How are you?

590
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,060
Have you been used to the life

591
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,160
abroad during these years?

592
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:46,610
Yes.

593
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,720
I've been working abroad these years.

594
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:50,300
I've accumulated a lot of work experience.

595
00:24:50,330 --> 00:24:51,380
I've learned a lot.

596
00:24:51,400 --> 00:24:53,570
I didn't expect that I could still get used to it after I came back from abroad.

597
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,050
I don't even have to deal with the jet lag.

598
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:55,930
Really?

599
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,700
When my son came back

600
00:24:57,740 --> 00:24:58,670
from abroad last time,

601
00:24:58,690 --> 00:25:00,890
he spent half a month dealing with his jet lag.

602
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,660
This varies from person to person.

603
00:25:03,790 --> 00:25:05,400
Maybe now I just want to

604
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:06,680
go to work as soon as possible

605
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,900
and offer my humble effort to the company.

606
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:09,720
This girl is too modest.

607
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,660
Guifen,

608
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,730
you have such a good daughter,

609
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:13,180
and It's my honor that she can

610
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,530
work at my company.

611
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:16,420
By the way,

612
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:19,280
I've entrusted the management of the company to Zhuang.

613
00:25:19,310 --> 00:25:21,170
In the future, if there's anything, you can discuss it with each other.

614
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,230
Lou Yuan.

615
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,770
I wonder how he is now.

616
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:26,660
Have you forgotten it?

617
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:29,060
You were even engaged when you were kids.

618
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:30,130
Yes.

619
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:32,060
When you two played the game of make-believe in childhood,

620
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,200
you often call each other honey.

621
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:35,420
Mom.

622
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,990
Aunt Lou, stop making fun of me.

623
00:25:39,060 --> 00:25:41,020
It was just a game in childhood.

624
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:43,330
She's so embarrassed that she's blushing.

625
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:45,730
This kid has grown up.

626
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:48,830
Aunt Lou, it's getting late.

627
00:25:48,850 --> 00:25:49,850
We'll leave now.

628
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,080
I won't disturb you any longer.

629
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:52,530
How can you leave?

630
00:25:52,570 --> 00:25:53,930
You've just arrived, haven't you?

631
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,110
Let's make dumplings here.

632
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:56,240
-Don't leave. -Okay.

633
00:25:56,450 --> 00:25:57,360
I'll make the dough first.

634
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:57,950
Let's go.

635
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,510
Alright.

636
00:25:58,580 --> 00:25:59,430
-I'll help. -Let's make dumplings.

637
00:26:00,710 --> 00:26:01,480
Come on.

638
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:18,050
[East Gate]

639
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:26,310
Hello, I'm Li Li'an from the Planning Department.

640
00:26:27,290 --> 00:26:28,600
-Hello, Miss Li. -Hello.

641
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,630
These are some small gifts for you.

642
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,160
I hope you'll like them.

643
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,100
Thank you.

644
00:26:33,180 --> 00:26:34,140
Thank you, Miss Li.

645
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,100
She's very nice.

646
00:26:39,570 --> 00:26:41,460
Look. This is the office area.

647
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:42,940
Your desk is normally over there.

648
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:43,580
And...

649
00:26:43,660 --> 00:26:45,620
They are Secretary Huang and Zhu Li.

650
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,990
Hello. Hello.

651
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:47,900
Hello, everyone.

652
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,290
-Let me introduce someone to you. -Hello.

653
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,420
This is my apprentice, Lan Zhenzhen.

654
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,310
From now on,

655
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,880
she'll be in charge of the contact with the Peony Corporation.

656
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:56,840
Hello, everyone. Nice to meet you.

657
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:57,580
Okay.

658
00:26:57,790 --> 00:26:58,670
By the way, Zhenzhen,

659
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,950
this is your badge.

660
00:27:00,590 --> 00:27:02,430
If you have any questions about contracts,

661
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,570
you can ask Ji Qiu.

662
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,220
If you have any questions about the financial procedure,

663
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,990
go over there to ask Ocean.

664
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,180
Of course,

665
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,540
as for the affairs of advertising planning,

666
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:10,380
-you can ask... -Me.

667
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,180
Secretary Huang.

668
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,840
She will tell Mr. Wang.

669
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:15,100
Actually, your main responsibility is

670
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,460
to be a communication bridge

671
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,780
between the clients and Mrs. Lou.

672
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,220
Okay.

673
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,120
I believe that you can do it.

674
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:20,700
Don't worry.

675
00:27:20,700 --> 00:27:21,140
Go for it!

676
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:21,650
Thank you, Master.

677
00:27:21,650 --> 00:27:22,180
I'm leaving.

678
00:27:22,180 --> 00:27:22,620
Okay.

679
00:27:31,510 --> 00:27:32,030
Bye.

680
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:40,220
Come in.

681
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,370
Mr. Lou.

682
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:51,820
Li Li'an.

683
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:54,200
Come on. Sit down, please.

684
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,160
We haven't seen each other for many years,

685
00:27:58,400 --> 00:27:59,870
but you haven't changed at all.

686
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:01,940
But compared with what you used to look like in childhood,

687
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,010
you're more handsome now.

688
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:04,180
Sit.

689
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,950
This is a gift for you.

690
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,160
Don't misunderstand.

691
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,300
Everyone has a gift.

692
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:15,880
This chocolate is famous abroad.

693
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,080
I once had hypoglycemia while I was working.

694
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:20,020
After I ate a piece of this, I felt refreshed immediately.

695
00:28:20,060 --> 00:28:21,140
I hope you'll like it.

696
00:28:21,920 --> 00:28:24,000
Okay. I'll accept your gift.

697
00:28:25,590 --> 00:28:27,470
Yesterday, my mom told me that you would work in the Planning Department.

698
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,550
I didn't expect that you would start working here today.

699
00:28:30,230 --> 00:28:31,680
Come on. Read this first.

700
00:28:32,270 --> 00:28:34,100
This is some information about the dining saloon.

701
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,660
You can read it first.

702
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:36,860
If you have any question,

703
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:37,640
we can communicate at any time.

704
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,180
Okay.

705
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,470
I can start working right away.

706
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:43,810
But Mr. Lou,

707
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,990
although we're old acquaintances,

708
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,300
I hope you can still treat me in a businesslike manner at work.

709
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,250
If I do anything wrong,

710
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,540
you can tell me anytime.

711
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:52,580
Okay.

712
00:28:53,090 --> 00:28:54,220
I look forward to working with you.

713
00:28:54,390 --> 00:28:55,250
Me, too.

714
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,630
Hello, a gentleman asked me to give this to you.

715
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:06,740
Thank you.

716
00:29:14,040 --> 00:29:16,220
I'll let you rank second for now.

717
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:17,120
An.

718
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:19,980
Why are you here?

719
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:21,850
I've brought you

720
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:23,710
your favorite milk when you were a kid.

721
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,380
I don't drink milk anymore.

722
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:28,320
I have lactose intolerance now.

723
00:29:29,700 --> 00:29:31,010
I see.

724
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:34,480
I haven't taken care of you by your side for a long time.

725
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:37,520
An, I've cleaned the house.

726
00:29:37,650 --> 00:29:39,950
Why don't you come back to live at home?

727
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:42,460
Then it'll be convenient for me to take care of you.

728
00:29:42,550 --> 00:29:44,250
I'm fine living in the hotel.

729
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:45,830
Besides, I'm an adult now.

730
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,050
I don't need anyone to take care of me.

731
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,360
It's my fault.

732
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:52,930
I didn't spend much time with you while you were growing up.

733
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,370
You know what?

734
00:29:54,490 --> 00:29:56,640
This time, you came back to work at the Peony Corporation.

735
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,590
I'm feel

736
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:00,350
very happy.

737
00:30:00,660 --> 00:30:02,340
I may not stay.

738
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,440
Why?

739
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:07,280
This is a great opportunity.

740
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:09,050
You became the department director as soon as you joined the company.

741
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,340
You'll have a bright future.

742
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:15,690
The Peony Corporation is not the same as it used to be.

743
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,350
Now under the market environment with such fierce competition,

744
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:20,470
new companies are also rising.

745
00:30:21,100 --> 00:30:23,270
It's destined to be on the decline.

746
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:24,510
But luckily,

747
00:30:24,540 --> 00:30:26,360
with its former status, its influence is still there.

748
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,670
So, with this experience,

749
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,650
I think the development of my career will go smoothly, too.

750
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,640
I'll go upstairs first.

751
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:33,990
By the way,

752
00:30:36,230 --> 00:30:37,520
in the future,

753
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,040
we should keep a distance from each other at the company.

754
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,700
I don't want others to know about our relationship,

755
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:44,760
in case my colleagues

756
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:46,820
should think that I got this job by nepotism.

757
00:30:47,770 --> 00:30:48,450
Okay.

758
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,490
I understand.

759
00:30:50,560 --> 00:30:51,720
I'll do as you say.

760
00:30:51,950 --> 00:30:53,260
I'll go upstairs first to take a rest.

761
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,630
Be careful on your way back home.

762
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,240
[Eighty-two Studio]

763
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,810
Stop your work for now.

764
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,490
Let's have dinner at a restaurant tonight.

765
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:14,180
Have dinner at a restaurant?

766
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,100
-Let’s go. -Where will we have dinner?

767
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:16,410
Which restaurant? Is it clean?

768
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,790
It's clean. You'll be satisfied.

769
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:19,860
There's a promotion event in that shop. Ten yuan for three chicken legs.

770
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:20,410
Let's go.

771
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,790
-Let's go. -Go.

Let's go, Shi.

773
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,350
En, aren't you going?

774
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,190
Bachelor, what do you know?

775
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,690
She needs to go on a date during this good time.

776
00:31:28,710 --> 00:31:29,550
Let's go.

777
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,140
Ke knows me well.

778
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,480
-Bachelor. -Bye.

The supply company's customer service clerk got off work early.

781

Your girlfriend is online now.

782
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:42,930
Dear boyfriend, do you have time now?

783
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,950
What's the matter?

784
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:50,630
It's a secret.

785
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,910
Come pick me up at the Eighty-two Studio later.

786
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,830
See you later.

00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,420
Come in.

788
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:05,920

Postpone all the work today to tomorrow.

790
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,420
I need to go home first.

791
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,140
Okay.

792
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:12,410
What about the welcome party

793
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:14,010
our chairwoman has arranged for Miss Li?

794
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,780
It'll be fine if the chairwoman is there.

795
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,790
Remember to help me turn off my computer.

796
00:32:19,090 --> 00:32:19,770
Okay.

797
00:32:24,310 --> 00:32:25,700
This is great.

798
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,490
Ms. Chairwoman.

799
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:27,950
Ms. Chairwoman.

800
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:29,740
Hello, Ms. Chairwoman.

801
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:31,380
Just eat. Alright. Hurry up.

802
00:32:32,200 --> 00:32:32,950
Eat your food.

803
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,430
The food is good today.

804
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,960
This meal is well prepared.

805
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:40,460
The food in our canteen is getting better and better.

806
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,200
Call the Logistics Department.

807
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,420
We should praise them.

808
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,050
Why are you still standing there?

809
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:45,870
Sit down.

810
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:49,700
Why isn't Zhuang here?

811
00:32:49,730 --> 00:32:50,760
Is he still working overtime?

812
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:53,420
He's busy.

813
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:55,030
I don't know what he's busy with now.

814
00:32:55,090 --> 00:32:56,710
Anyway, An has joined the company.

815
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:58,170
They can see each other every day.

816
00:32:58,190 --> 00:32:58,700
Yes.

817
00:32:58,990 --> 00:32:59,920
I'm sorry, Ms. Chairwoman.

818
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:00,830

An,

824
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,090
it's not your fault.

825
00:33:09,110 --> 00:33:10,760
It's our fault.

826
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,480
We've developed this habit of

827
00:33:12,540 --> 00:33:14,080
eating early if arriving early.

828
00:33:14,220 --> 00:33:15,560
Right? Do you think so?

829
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:16,290

00:35:50,610 --> 00:35:52,320
Unfortunately, both of you weren't there yesterday.

925
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:55,140
Yesterday, we went to see the people in charge of selecting the location.

926
00:35:55,190 --> 00:35:57,700
Their intention to cooperate with us is very strong.

927
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,260
I think the prime location at the Huaihai Road

928
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,370
will be ours.

929
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,810
Huaihai Road?

930
00:36:01,970 --> 00:36:03,920
That is the most bustling area

931
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:05,100
among all the newly developed commercial zones.

932
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:06,340
It has been acquired by our company?

933
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,120
The sales trend of our company's new sauces has been good recently.

934
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,560
The sales volume also increased by 30% last year.

935
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,670
The developer thinks highly of our performance.

936
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,130
They made an exception and approved it this time.

937
00:36:16,650 --> 00:36:18,420
It was mainly due to Lou Yuan's efforts this time.

938
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
After he came back,

939
00:36:19,610 --> 00:36:21,620
our new Peony sauces have sold well.

940
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,960
We used to beg others to sell our products

941
00:36:23,990 --> 00:36:24,950
and to cooperate with us.

942
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:26,280
Now they all take the initiative to visit us.

943
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,430
It's totally different now.

944
00:36:27,450 --> 00:36:30,400
I didn't expect Mr. Lou to be so capable at such a young age.

945
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,020
It looks like I have to work hard

946
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,620
so that I won't hinder your progress.

947
00:36:33,740 --> 00:36:34,820
Let's work hard together.

948
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:37,320
Young people can get to know each other fast.

949
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:40,790
[Food is the paramount necessity of the people]

950
00:36:40,620 --> 00:36:42,070
I'm almost done eating.

951
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,080
[Peony]

952
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,900
You guys should communicate with each other well.

953
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:45,740
Ask them if you have any questions.

954
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:48,450
-Then I… -Let me see you off.

955
00:36:48,470 --> 00:36:49,940
You don't have to see me off.

956
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:52,660
-Where's Zhu Li? Zhu Li will see me off. -It’s all arranged.

957
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,020
-Enjoy your meal. -Be careful.

958
00:36:54,040 --> 00:36:55,460
-Enjoy your meal. -Bye, Ms. Chairwoman.

959
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:56,890
Enjoy your meal.

960
00:36:56,910 --> 00:36:57,590
I have to go.

961
00:36:58,300 --> 00:36:59,410
-Bro, about the reimbursement, -You're leaving, too?

962
00:36:59,460 --> 00:37:00,100
let's talk on WeChat?

963
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:01,530
Let's talk later.

964
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,820
Come back home to live with me after we finish this meal.

965
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,820
Is Mr. Lou easy to get along with?

966
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:17,360
You mean Zhuang?

967
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:18,760
He's easy to get along with.

968
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,220
Come on. Cheers.

969
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,810
He works hard and has aspirations.

970
00:37:20,860 --> 00:37:22,090
He works late every day.

971
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:24,020
He doesn't have the bad habits which a rich boy might have.

972
00:37:24,230 --> 00:37:25,500
He doesn't even have a girlfriend.

973
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:30,380
Got it.

974
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,540
Aunt Lou, I've arranged everything today.

975
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,620
I'll take you to the largest wholesale market.

976
00:37:39,620 --> 00:37:41,550
Let's take a look there carefully.

977
00:37:42,140 --> 00:37:43,340
This is good.

978
00:37:43,620 --> 00:37:45,780
En, you're just so considerate towards me.

979
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,220
Aunt Lou, today, I've specially brought you

980
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,920
your favorite snacks when we were kids.

981
00:37:51,630 --> 00:37:53,990
This girl is still as considerate as she was when she was a kid.

982
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,700
When you were a kid,

983
00:37:55,730 --> 00:37:57,870
you loved playing the game of make-believe with him.

984
00:37:58,100 --> 00:37:59,690
You played the role of mom, and he played the role of dad.

985
00:37:59,710 --> 00:38:01,190
They were very close to each other.

986
00:38:02,180 --> 00:38:03,620
Auntie, it's all in the past.

987
00:38:03,620 --> 00:38:04,830
Don't mention it again.

988
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,950
You've grown up, so you feel embarrassed?

989
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,350
Let me make an introduction.

990
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,290
This is Li Li'an.

991
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,680
She has just come back from abroad.

992
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:13,630
Now she's

993
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:15,870
the director of our company's Planning Department.

994
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:17,930
So, as we'll have an inspection tour today,

995
00:38:17,950 --> 00:38:19,160
I want to invite her to go with us.

996
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:20,020
Alright, Mom.

997
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:20,730
Get in the car first.

998
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,730
-Let's go. -Let's go.

999
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:27,780
Get in the car.

1000
00:38:51,440 --> 00:38:52,140
Ms. Lou, be careful.

1001
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:53,140
Come on. Watch your head.

1002
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:53,620
Okay.

1003
00:38:57,950 --> 00:39:02,740
[Agricultural Products Market]

1004
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,610
This place is nice.

1005
00:39:00,970 --> 00:39:02,380
I want to go to the shop

1006
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,260
which sells black rice wine.

1007
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:04,060
You should go with me.

1008
00:39:04,060 --> 00:39:05,620
I happen to like that shop, too. Let's go.

1009
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:05,980
Let's go.

1010
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:07,330
Ms. Chairman, let me join you.

1011
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:08,050
No need.

1012
00:39:08,070 --> 00:39:09,950
You two can go see the chilli shop.

1013
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:10,870
I...

1014
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:11,380
Let's go.

1015
00:39:11,380 --> 00:39:11,900
Let's go.

1016
00:39:11,900 --> 00:39:12,370
No.

1017
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,550
It's just ahead, right?

1018
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,860
So carefree.

1019
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:17,980
-Wholesale of sugar. -Let’s go.

1020
00:39:23,950 --> 00:39:25,340
Please take it. Bye.

1021
00:39:25,540 --> 00:39:26,030
Okay.

1022
00:39:33,590 --> 00:39:34,690
You have a good taste.

1023
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,210
These chillies

1024
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:38,420
taste spicy, but they won't make your stomach feel bad.

1025
00:39:38,470 --> 00:39:39,750
Try it if you don't believe me.

1026
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,220
Okay.

1027
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:47,510
It's good indeed.

1028
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:49,860
It's not worse than the ones we bought before.

1029
00:39:50,010 --> 00:39:50,890
Not bad, right?

1030
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:51,850
Actually,

1031
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:53,140
the quality of our chillies

1032
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,900
is the best in our country.

1033
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,290
But there is no good publicity

1034
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,180
or good packaging,

1035
00:39:57,420 --> 00:39:59,260
so they look unfashionable, dirty

1036
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,240
and not classy.

1037
00:40:00,310 --> 00:40:02,460
But for this kind of products, we need to focus on its inner quality.

1038
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:04,180
The quality of our products is just good.

1039
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,720
If someone is willing to help,

1040
00:40:06,770 --> 00:40:08,210
and make them known by more people,

1041
00:40:08,420 --> 00:40:10,060
then our good chillies

1042
00:40:10,060 --> 00:40:10,990
can become popular.

1043
00:40:11,510 --> 00:40:12,820
You are right.

1044
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:14,420
Please take a look first.

1045
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:15,290
Ask me to come if you need anything.

1046
00:40:15,330 --> 00:40:15,870
Okay.

1047
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,760
There are too many good things in our country,

1048
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,420
but there is lack of publicity.

1049
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:24,810
This time, our Peony Corporation's dining saloon

1050
00:40:24,860 --> 00:40:26,060
can also provide the function of

1051
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,300
finding good ingredients.

1052
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:28,250
Kill two birds with one stone.

1053
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,040
It's great that you think so, too.

1054
00:40:30,660 --> 00:40:31,660
Actually, I also hope that

1055
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,380
we can use this dining saloon as a platform

1056
00:40:33,510 --> 00:40:35,270
so that more and more good agricultural products

1057
00:40:35,290 --> 00:40:37,300
can be known by many consumers.

1058
00:40:38,420 --> 00:40:40,420
We have the same idea.

1059
00:40:40,830 --> 00:40:43,220
I've been studying plans on this aspect lately.

1060
00:40:43,810 --> 00:40:46,100
Do you know a foreign brand called Pitz?

1061
00:40:46,860 --> 00:40:48,140
It used to be

1062
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,530
a very ordinary family workshop.

1063
00:40:49,810 --> 00:40:51,670
After the processing of a big factory

1064
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:52,660
and the help of advertising,

1065
00:40:52,690 --> 00:40:54,180
as well as the making of a good brand story,

1066
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,220
now it has become a dark horse.

1067
00:40:56,250 --> 00:40:57,410
It's really popular.

1068
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:59,770
Yes. I've been studying this case lately, too.

1069
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:01,350
It's worth learning.

1070
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:03,250
But the most important thing is that

1071
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:05,480
it insists not to be purchased by a big company.

1072
00:41:05,780 --> 00:41:07,950
That's why it can maintain its original style.

1073
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,420
Indeed, you haven't changed at all.

1074
00:41:10,670 --> 00:41:12,050
You're still as curious about

1075
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:14,170
everything as you used to be.

1076
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:16,520
You've been making progress and learning.

1077
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:21,550
You know what?

1078
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,090
You've always been my role model.

1079
00:41:24,710 --> 00:41:26,390
Thanks to your influence,

1080
00:41:26,590 --> 00:41:28,040
I've had all these achievements today.

1081
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:33,860
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
