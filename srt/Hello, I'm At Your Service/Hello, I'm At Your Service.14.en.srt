Is it an upper eyelash or lower eyelash?

33
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,620
My mom said if it's an upper eyelash,

34
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,260
I should throw it downward.

35
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:05,180

This is not specific enough.

43
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:47,940

I got to know you better.

82
00:08:12,890 --> 00:08:14,230
I found that you haven't changed.

00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:13,150

113
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:32,590

-Thank you.

116
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,580
It's okay, Director.

117
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,390
The weather is beyond our control.

118
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:40,670
It has nothing to do with you.

119
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:43,710
Quality is our top priority.

120
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:46,210
No need to rush it.

121
00:10:46,690 --> 00:10:48,180

00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:50,940
-Reasonable and rational.
-I'm flattered.

124
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:51,660
-Right. Right.
-En,

125

I said Mr. Lou

127
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,260
is a person who has great artistic pursuit.

128
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:58,610

-Yes. Yes.

I have something to tell you.

140
00:11:30,230 --> 00:11:31,210
-Okay. -You guys eat first.

141
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,980
You are not eating?

142
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:44,880
I have something serious to ask you.

143
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,100
Did you see

144
00:11:48,130 --> 00:11:49,700
who pushed you from behind yesterday?

145
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:51,880
I was in a hurry to save you yesterday.

146
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,590
I didn't see his face.

147
00:11:54,290 --> 00:11:55,930
He pushed me from behind.

148
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:57,190
I couldn't see him at all.

149
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,470
I kind of remember

150
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,450
he was wearing a raincoat and a hat.

151
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,640
It seems he disguised himself on purpose.

152
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,890
Our car broke down yesterday, right?

153
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,720
I asked the driver when I came back.

154
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,990
He told me that someone did it maliciously.

155
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:16,900
But don't worry.

156
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:18,650
I've already taken a photo as evidence.

157
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,170
Mr. Lou,

158
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:22,620
could it be that someone

159
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:24,800
doesn't want us to shoot the commercial?

160
00:12:24,950 --> 00:12:26,490
If that's the case,

161
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:30,130
it's malignant business competition.

162
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:35,760
The competition among companies is normal.

163
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,890
But I hope

164
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,430
you won't make it personal.

165
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,310
Of course.

166
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:42,890
It's always been healthy competition between us, right?

167
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,480
I don't understand what you mean.

168
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,400
I mean it literally.

169
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,740
But I still want to thank you for today.

170
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:50,220
The juice tastes good.

171
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,050
You're right.

172
00:12:57,710 --> 00:12:59,080
Luckily, you didn't get hurt.

173
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,850
Remember to send me the photo later.

174
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,530
And

175
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,460
yesterday...

176
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,660
I fell asleep yesterday.

177
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,590
I fell asleep yesterday.

178
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,100
I'm quite heavy, right?

179
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,510
Thank you for carrying me back.

180
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,530
You're not heavy.

181
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,730
I just want to say yesterday...

182
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:29,750
I'm

183
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,980
a heavy sleeper.

184
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:34,970
I can fall asleep anywhere.

185
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,850
One year,

186
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,790
there was a flood

187
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,790
passing our school.

188
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,790
Everyone in the school woke up.

189
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:46,460
I was the only one sleeping.

190
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,050
Hm.

191
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,250
The next day, they told me

192
00:13:51,670 --> 00:13:54,710
there were rotten wood and giant stones in the flood.

193
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:57,040
There was noise as they hit the walls.

194
00:13:57,230 --> 00:13:58,460
-Well, I...
-Dong Dong'en.

195
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,260
You were awake yesterday, right?

196
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:11,820
No.

197
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,500
Are you sure?

198
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,130
I'm sure.

199
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,080
I had a dream yesterday.

200
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:20,850
A deity told me

201
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:22,800
I can't wake up.

202
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,780
Mr. Lou, what can I do for you?

203
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:40,980
I need to ask for a two-day leave.

204
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:42,740
If the company has a very important meeting,

205
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:44,760
ask Mr. Wang or Miss Cao to chair it.

206
00:14:44,910 --> 00:14:47,020
If there is something important

207
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,440
that I need to sign personally,

208
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,900
remember to deliver it to Xingyun Village.

209
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,000
Xingyun Village?

210
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:52,100
Yes, that's right.

211
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:53,990
Okay.

212
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,860
This is from the Marketing Department.

213
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,430
It needs Mr. Lou's signature.

214
00:15:00,500 --> 00:15:01,060
Okay.

215
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,800
Mr. Lou asked for a two-day leave.

216
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,770
I have to take these to Xingyun Village.

217
00:15:07,330 --> 00:15:08,100
Bye.

218
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,130

Is Miss Cao here?

226

No.

227

You don't know?

228
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:47,920
Miss Cao asked for a sick leave.

229
00:15:48,020 --> 00:15:48,580
Sick?

230
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,490
What happened to her?

231
00:15:49,980 --> 00:15:51,400
It seems she has a fever.

232
00:15:51,770 --> 00:15:52,830
Miss Cao didn't tell me specifically.

233
00:15:54,390 --> 00:15:55,570
Did Wei Kaile

234
00:15:55,870 --> 00:15:56,500
ask for a leave?

235
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,260
He heard that Miss Cao is sick, so he...

236
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:11,110
Coming.

237
00:16:15,570 --> 00:16:16,540
I heard you're sick.

238
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,420
I bought you some food and medicine.

239
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,780
I just want to accompany you.

240
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:21,890
No, I'm fine.

241
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,200
It's working hours now, right?

242
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,520
Go back to the company.

243
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,500
I'm really here to deliver the medicine.

244
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,910
Just let me accompany you

245
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,340
so that I won't be worried.

246
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:32,150
Okay?

247
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,220
Be careful.

248
00:16:37,590 --> 00:16:38,460
Let me do it.

249
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:48,910
Is the rain going to stop?

250
00:16:49,690 --> 00:16:51,470
Okay, let's start tomorrow morning.

251
00:16:51,660 --> 00:16:52,300
Okay.

252
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:53,420
En.

253
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,130
Mr. Lou.

254
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,050
We're not slacking off.

255
00:16:57,110 --> 00:16:58,050
The rain just stopped.

256
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:59,490
We'll start early tomorrow.

257
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:01,010
The weather is beyond our control.

258
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:01,970
Have you seen En?

259
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,040
I think she went to look for a school.

260
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:06,680
Luck Elementary School. Yes.

261
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:09,550

262
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:12,660

Well said.

Are you awake, Lazy Bug?

268
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,160
I made you something to eat.

269
00:17:45,190 --> 00:17:46,330
Do you want to get up and eat something?

270
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:48,310
Didn't you go to work?

271
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:49,540
Here, take it.

272
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:54,030
I called you but you didn't answer.

273
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:56,060
I thought you must be still in bed.

274
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,920
You stayed up late to work last night.

275
00:17:57,990 --> 00:18:00,000
It'll be too greasy if you eat take-out.

276
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,500
It's not good for your stomach.

277
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,790
So I came back to cook something for you.

278
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,560
You're so sweet.

279
00:18:10,810 --> 00:18:12,940
Are you going to Ba'er Creative later?

280

I'm not going today.

281
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,730
I don't have much work today.

282
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:19,240
I asked for a leave to accompany you.

283
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,270
Really?

284
00:18:20,290 --> 00:18:21,780
I don't have work tonight.

285

Let's go shopping together.

286
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,450
Sure.

287
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:29,430
I'm going to help you get the salad ready.

288
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:30,540
Come on.

So sweet.

292

It's nice to have a boyfriend with a cleanliness obsession.

293

You're so sweet.

294

You're perfect for me.

295
00:19:36,540 --> 00:19:38,940
I know girls in your industry are afraid of gaining weight.

296
00:19:39,350 --> 00:19:41,510
This is healthy and won't make you gain weight.

297
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,130
Yes.

Yes, eat more.

I'll pick some with you tonight.

305

Okay, I'll listen to you.

308
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:03,710
is also damaged.

I'll buy you a new one.

Go straight and turn right.

322

Okay, thank you.

Mr. Lou.

325
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,560
Well,

326
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:12,020
I came out for a walk. What about you?

327
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:14,680
Me too. I ate too much.

328
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:15,740
I came out to digest food.

329
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,120
Looks like you're full.

330
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,150
That's because the dumplings you made are delicious.

331
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,220
I've never seen a client

332
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,380
who can cook such delicious food.

333
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,420
I didn't make the dumplings.

334
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,690
But it would be more delicious if I made them.

335
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:29,530
Of course.

336
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:30,980
Let me tell you.

337
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:31,620
When I was 7 years old,

338
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,230
I started to help my mom cook.

339
00:21:33,310 --> 00:21:35,310
She was willing to take me with her no matter what she did.

340
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:36,800
She even asked me to learn

341
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,790
to fluff cotton and prepare shoe soles from her.

342
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,520
There was a time when she

343
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,620
asked me to learn cross-stitch

344
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:41,540
and scarf knitting.

345
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:42,850
I've learned a lot.

346
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,100
Why are you looking at me like this?

347
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:46,260
Do you think a man

348
00:21:46,260 --> 00:21:47,100
shouldn't do these things?

349
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:48,410
No.

350
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:50,250
But many people think

351
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,860
these should be girl things.

352
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:54,790
It feels a bit awkward if boys can do them.

353
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:56,500
But you told me frankly.

354
00:21:57,540 --> 00:21:58,470
It's no big deal.

355
00:21:58,570 --> 00:21:59,820
And I don't think

356
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,060
girls must know how to do these things.

357
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:02,770
I think so too.

358
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,450

00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,180
My seat was here.

380
00:22:48,210 --> 00:22:50,050
I miss the time when I was in school.

381
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,950
Back then,

382
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:53,980
was it a boy or a girl sitting next to you?

383
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:55,390
A boy.

384
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,060
Our class monitor.

385
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,790
When I just transferred here,

386
00:22:58,820 --> 00:23:00,410
my teacher asked him to take care of me.

387
00:23:00,430 --> 00:23:02,270
He's a straight-A student.

388
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:03,500
All the girls in our class liked him.

389
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:04,530
All?

390
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:06,610
Including you?

391
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,730
Yes.

392
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:09,500
Who doesn't like straight-A students?

393
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,830
Let's... Let's go back.

394
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,450
Mr. Lou.

395
00:23:35,590 --> 00:23:36,640
I think

396
00:23:37,480 --> 00:23:39,150
our relationship is a little strange.

397
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:41,460
Why?

398
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,210
I refused you.

399
00:23:47,050 --> 00:23:47,880
I know.

400
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,570
I don't want others to say I get what I have because I slept with you.

401
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,140
I don't want others to say you used unspoken rules on me either.

402
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:02,940
En,

403
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:07,450
actually, I know your concerns.

404
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:11,640
But no matter who you are with

405
00:24:11,940 --> 00:24:13,240
or who you like,

406
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,380
you'll have all kinds of problems.

407
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,040
But I like you.

408
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,870
I don't want to give up.

409
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:23,090
I want to face them with you.

410
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,680
We can solve all the problems together.

411
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,540
So

412
00:24:28,390 --> 00:24:31,500
♫You're like a beam of light♫

413
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,900

425
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,740

I'm just an ordinary person. Look.

434
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:07,550

No need to go to the hospital.

No, you've taken the medicine twice.

519
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,540
Didn't she just catch a cold?

520

Don't you know

525
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,180
different cold medicine can't be taken at the same time?

What should we do?

528
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:30,300

00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:01,690
It must be raining over there.

Listen.

541
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,050
This will delay the shooting.

Why are you worried?

546
00:30:11,870 --> 00:30:14,470
We should be worried even though Party A is not worried.

547
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:16,360
If Party A

548
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,830
says we have slacked off,

549
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:19,760
should we take the blame or not?

550
00:30:21,780 --> 00:30:22,460
Take it.

551
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,420
This is the final draft.

552
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:25,710
I won't revise it again.

553
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,300
I won't no matter what.

What's wrong with me?

558
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:35,480
If you don't recruit people, I'll kill you.

559
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,440
I will quit.

560
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,590
Look at him.

561
00:30:39,980 --> 00:30:41,770
This is called slacking off.

562
00:30:44,170 --> 00:30:45,110
They all have left?

563
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:46,990
Have dinner with me.

564
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,640
Having dinner is okay.

565
00:30:49,770 --> 00:30:51,190
But drinking wine is impossible.

566
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,410
It's not dinner if I don't drink.

567
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:56,160
Listen. You care too much about preserving your health.

568
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,340
[Conscience matters the most]

569
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:29,250
How does it feel?

570
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:30,710
Is it comfortable?

571
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,430
What's wrong?

572
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,240
It feels great.

573
00:31:47,290 --> 00:31:49,630
Then why are you shy?

574
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,900
Who... Who is shy?

575
00:31:53,790 --> 00:31:55,450
Why are you covering yourself if you're not shy?

576
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:56,530
I'm not shy.

577
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:58,270
Really?

578
00:31:59,230 --> 00:32:00,250
Touch me again.

579
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,460
Touch me again.

580
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,510
So obedient?

581
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,780
Then I can't just let you walk away.

582
00:32:13,020 --> 00:32:14,380
Everything is ready. Let's...

583
00:32:16,770 --> 00:32:17,620
There is...

584
00:32:19,630 --> 00:32:21,120
There is a rainbow!

585
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,650
Beautiful.

586
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,050
It's all your fault.

587
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:29,270
Why are you blaming me?

588
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,200
We agreed that we are a soon-to-be couple.

589
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,550
We are a soon-to-be...

590
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:35,560
Do you regret it?

591
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:37,660
No.

592
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,670
Love is a lifetime matter.

593
00:32:39,820 --> 00:32:41,380
We should be cautious.

594
00:32:42,990 --> 00:32:43,750
You deserve praise.

595
00:32:44,170 --> 00:32:45,810
You've started to think about a lifetime matter.

596
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,460
Let's... Let's go.

597
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:48,020
No.

598
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:51,320
How could you? Let's go.

599
00:32:51,340 --> 00:32:52,700
We didn't kiss just now.

600
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,210
Let's go.

601
00:32:53,290 --> 00:32:53,730
No.

602
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,540
Let's go.

603
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,060
No.

604
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,920
It's time to work. It's your company's project.

605
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,490
No hurry.

606
00:32:58,970 --> 00:32:59,860
-Give me a kiss.
-We need to work.

607
00:33:00,010 --> 00:33:01,240
Don't act cute.

608
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:02,770
Kiss.

609
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:04,100
Hurry up.

610
00:33:04,460 --> 00:33:05,060
Kiss.

611
00:33:05,210 --> 00:33:05,920
Hurry up.

612
00:33:08,030 --> 00:33:08,700
Kiss.

613
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:12,550
I'm angry.

614
00:33:14,850 --> 00:33:15,610
Come on.

615
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:20,780
Let's go.

616
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:21,360
Let's go.

617
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,570
Cotton-padded trousers.

618
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,740
Later,

619
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,810
-zoom in.
-This way, right?

620
00:33:39,830 --> 00:33:40,260
Okay.

621
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:41,660
It seems nice over there too.

622
00:33:42,620 --> 00:33:44,440
Take some photos as materials over there later.

623
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:45,250
Okay.

624
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,540
This is the proposal we made yesterday.

625
00:33:54,560 --> 00:33:55,600
Director, what do you think?

626
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,410
No problem.

627
00:33:56,770 --> 00:33:57,540
Later, let's film these two first.

628
00:33:57,540 --> 00:33:58,170
Hello, Zhu Li.

629
00:33:58,380 --> 00:33:59,010
These two.

630
00:33:59,010 --> 00:33:59,850
How's it going?

631
00:34:00,260 --> 00:34:02,100
Mr. Lou, basically, everything is fine.

632
00:34:02,130 --> 00:34:03,210
I have some documents

633
00:34:03,240 --> 00:34:04,200
for you to take a look at.

634
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,680
One more thing.

635
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,110
I'm on my way to the filming site with the chairman.

636
00:34:08,170 --> 00:34:09,639
She said she wanted to come to take a look.

637
00:34:09,860 --> 00:34:10,750
To the...

638
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,540
I like the feeling after the rain.

639
00:34:13,989 --> 00:34:16,080
You can smell mud, right?

640
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:18,130
Auntie, why are you here?

641
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,770
Why didn't you tell me in advance?

642
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,980
I came to see you.

643
00:34:20,980 --> 00:34:21,940
Thank you for your hard work.

644
00:34:22,230 --> 00:34:23,020
Not at all.

645
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:25,230
Chairman, you came all of a sudden.

646
00:34:25,530 --> 00:34:27,780
You're busy. Shouldn't we

647
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,699
come to care about you?

648
00:34:28,750 --> 00:34:30,179
I brought you milk tea.

649
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:31,600
I'm gonna give them out first.

650
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:32,780
Come and drink later.

651
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:33,340
Thank you.

652
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,770
-Have some water.
-Give it to them.

653
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:35,750
Come on.

654
00:34:36,070 --> 00:34:37,120
-Come on.
-Hello, Director.

655
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,570
Thank you, Chairman.

656
00:34:39,570 --> 00:34:40,780
Auntie Lou is so cute.

657
00:34:40,820 --> 00:34:42,400
Come here. Have some milk tea.

658
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:44,750
Are you happy to have a mother-in-law like her?

659
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,810
Here, young man. Take it.

660
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:49,360
There's more after you finish it.

661
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,300
Thank you, Chairman.

662
00:34:50,659 --> 00:34:51,570
Thank you.

663
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,840
Don't film me.

664
00:34:53,330 --> 00:34:54,370
-Do I have one too?
-Mr. Lou.

665
00:34:54,620 --> 00:34:55,520
We have a problem.

666
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,270
Lulu's agent just called

667
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,380
and said they wouldn't come.

668
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,240
They wouldn't come?

669
00:34:59,260 --> 00:34:59,950
What happened?

670
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,070
They said after Lulu

671
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:02,490
read our ad script,

672
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,480
she thought our ad is too low-end.

673
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,730
It goes against her international development direction.

674
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,240
She also said the weather is not good.

675
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,350
She's worried about her safety.

676
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:10,860
Anyway, they are already heading back.

677
00:35:10,980 --> 00:35:11,830
What should we do?

678
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:13,100
Have you had milk tea?

679
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,990
-I'll choose one myself.
-Good.

680
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:14,420
What should we do?

681
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:14,900
Come on.

682
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:15,620
Help yourself.

683
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,340
Thank you, everyone.

684
00:35:16,340 --> 00:35:18,260
-Photographers have the toughest job.
-Thank you.

685
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:20,360
Don't film me.

686
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,320
Do I look good?

687
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:25,230
You all have one?

688
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:26,610
I have an idea.

689
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:27,450
Alright, stop filming me.

690
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:28,600
We have a beauty here.

691
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,640
You really convinced my mom.

692
00:35:50,670 --> 00:35:51,620
How did you do that?

693
00:35:51,760 --> 00:35:54,420
I told her how much money she could save if she did it herself.

694
00:35:54,450 --> 00:35:55,720
So she agreed happily.

695
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:57,930
That's a good reason.

696
00:35:58,070 --> 00:35:59,280
It indeed can save us a lot of money.

697
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:03,280
Mr. Lou,

698
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,790
I just helped you save so much money.

699
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:08,070
Shouldn't you reward me?

700
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,580
It's not my style to talk about money.

701
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,320
Guys, look...

702
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:15,980
Nice.

703
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,930
One more time.

704
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:22,910
Not enough?

705
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,590
She's spinning.

706
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,570
Can she do it?

707
00:36:39,900 --> 00:36:40,540
Stop filming.

708
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:41,220
-Who are they?
-Who are you?

709
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,290
-What are you doing?
-Go away!

710
00:36:42,890 --> 00:36:43,580
What's going on?

711
00:36:43,580 --> 00:36:44,620
-What are you doing? We're still shooting.
-Go away!

712
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,140
What are you doing?

713
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:45,860
What's going on?

714
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:46,550
What are they doing?

715
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,210
Let's go take a look.

716
00:36:47,270 --> 00:36:47,750
Let's go.

717
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:48,890
Go away! Move!

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:49,530
What's going on?

719
00:36:49,550 --> 00:36:50,510
Who asked you to film here?

720
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:51,620
-What are you doing?
-Who asked you to film here?

721
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,420
Who are you?

722
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,340
-Are you from our village?
-Stop filming.

723
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,040
Hello?

724
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:00,520
The police? I want to report a case.

725
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:02,980
Don't fight.

726
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:03,860
Go. Go.

727
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:06,020
Brothers.

728
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,420
Calm down. Calm down.

729
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,590
We're from the same village.

730
00:37:08,610 --> 00:37:09,490
I'm also from this village.

731
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,760
We are family.

732
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:12,800
I was there when Wang Mazi's dog

733
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,500
gave birth.

734
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,220
Cut the crap.

735
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:16,460
Who is in charge?

736
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,580
Ask him here.

737
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:18,010
Hurry up.

738
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:18,620
I am...

739
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,510
What are you doing?

740
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,020
Can't we talk nicely?

741
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:21,900
Why are you shouting here?

742
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Take care of Auntie. I can handle this.

743
00:37:26,470 --> 00:37:27,210
Be careful.

744
00:37:27,290 --> 00:37:28,130
Don't worry.

745
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:29,770
Mom.

746
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:31,100
I'm the person in charge.

747
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,620
What's wrong, bro?

748
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,130
You are the person in charge?

749
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:35,930
Then there's no need to talk.

750
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:37,330
Pack your things and get lost.

751
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,030
Hurry.

752
00:37:38,100 --> 00:37:39,020
We're from the same village.

753
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:39,540
Calm down.

754
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:39,900
Who's from the same village as you?

755
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,420
-Who's from the same village as you?
-Calm down.

756
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,060
If you want us to leave,

757
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:43,710
you have to give us a reason, right?

758
00:37:43,940 --> 00:37:44,790
Reason?

759
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,540
The reason is that you are disturbing the villagers

760
00:37:46,540 --> 00:37:48,140
-and causing damages.
-Tell them.

761
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,290
You are causing damages.

762
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,580
My hen wouldn't lay eggs because of you.

763
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:52,870
-That's right.
-Yes.

764
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,620
-Do you know what consequences there will be?
-Okay. Okay.

765
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:57,170
I understand what you said.

766
00:37:57,250 --> 00:37:57,980
But

767
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,190
we've got the permit

768
00:37:59,260 --> 00:38:00,860
to film here.

769
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:02,620
We also have reported to the neighborhood committee.

770
00:38:02,670 --> 00:38:03,650
We also have told

771
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,030
the villagers nearby.

772
00:38:05,260 --> 00:38:06,020
Well,

773
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,260
we've told them.

774
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,550
Don't you know?

775
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,830
Are you from... from this village?

776
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:11,960
None of your business.

777
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:13,980
Since your hen wouldn't lay eggs,

778
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,530
I should deliver some eggs to you.

779
00:38:15,550 --> 00:38:17,060
You need to give me your name, address,

780
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,190
and phone number, right?

781
00:38:18,310 --> 00:38:19,310
Well, what does this mean?

782
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:20,540
You won't leave, right?

783
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,300
-You won't leave, right?
-S-Sir.

784
00:38:21,340 --> 00:38:22,220
Let's talk nicely.

785
00:38:22,220 --> 00:38:22,970
You want to bully honest men?

786
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:24,380
Drop your weapons. I'm telling you.

787
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:25,700
-I can do taekwondo.
-Smash their things!

788
00:38:25,890 --> 00:38:26,780
Grab your weapon!

789
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:31,740
Stop! Stop!

790
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,030
Stop!

791
00:38:33,420 --> 00:38:34,230
Go away!

792
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:38,130
Stop!

793
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,220
Chairman.

794
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:40,950
Stop! Stop!

795
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,650
What are you doing?

796
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:46,820
Smash their things!

797
00:38:53,260 --> 00:38:55,140
The police are here!

798
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:59,290
The police are here!

799
00:38:59,330 --> 00:38:59,960
Are you okay?

800
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:00,810
Let's go.

801
00:39:00,950 --> 00:39:02,360
The police are here. Let's wait and see.

802
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:04,180
Go. Let's wait and see.

803
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,580
Hurry. Let's go.

804
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:11,860
How are you feeling?

805
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:13,240
Come on.

806
00:39:14,470 --> 00:39:15,940
They hit me so hard.

807
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,350
Where does it hurt?

808
00:39:18,260 --> 00:39:19,090
anywhere.

809
00:39:19,720 --> 00:39:20,730
Let's go to the hospital then.

810
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:21,300
Let's go.

811
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:22,350
It hurts on the left.

812
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,460
Here?

813
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:27,310
Can't you

814
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:30,590
take good care of yourself?

815
00:39:30,660 --> 00:39:32,500
It was so dangerous. Why did you come to protect me?

816
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:33,700
What if they hit your head?

817
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:37,950
Look.

818
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:39,180
I'm fine.

819
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:40,720
It doesn't hurt. I'm fine.

820
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,550
How can it not hurt?

821
00:39:44,570 --> 00:39:45,860
I'm fine.

822
00:39:47,540 --> 00:39:49,390
Don't be angry. I was just pretending.

823
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:51,890
Is it worth taking such a big risk

824
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,210
for me?

825
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:56,880
Yes.

826
00:39:57,710 --> 00:39:58,950
If I don't protect you,

827
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,820
who will make me happy every day?

828
00:40:01,670 --> 00:40:03,110
It's definitely not okay

829
00:40:03,460 --> 00:40:04,350
if you are not here to make me happy.

830
00:40:07,970 --> 00:40:08,690
All right.

831
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,870
Don't be angry.

832
00:40:11,500 --> 00:40:12,710
Little sun.

833
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,230
Little sun.

834
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,780
You are my little sun.

835
00:40:16,780 --> 00:40:18,100
I have to protect you.

836
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:19,320
Smile.

837
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,690
Little...

838
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,940
Don't move.

839
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,290
Does it hurt?

840
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:28,500
Yes.

841
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:31,170
Don't do this again.

842
00:40:31,750 --> 00:40:32,270
Okay.

843
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,660
You can only take care of me when you take care of yourself first.

844
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:56,870
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
