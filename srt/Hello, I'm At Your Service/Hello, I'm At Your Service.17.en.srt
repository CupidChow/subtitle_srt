Liu?

00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:53,390
Lou.

8
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:54,620
Lou.

9
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:56,450
Sit. Sit.

10
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,010
Uncle, Auntie, I'm not sitting.

11
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:04,140
Sorry for the misunderstanding just now.

12
00:02:04,300 --> 00:02:05,610
Let me introduce myself.

13
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,520
I'm En's boyfriend.

14
00:02:07,860 --> 00:02:09,449
My name is Lou Yuan.

15
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:10,509
I'm 30 years old.

16
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,920
Do you know what you did wrong?

17
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:15,330
In public,

18
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,810
you were

19
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:18,870
being lovey-dovey.

20
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,930
That's ridiculous.

21
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:22,410
What do you think you were doing? Filming a movie?

22
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:23,540
If others see you,

23
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,260
they would think you are ill-educated.

24
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,579
Keep your voice down. You scared her.

25
00:02:27,579 --> 00:02:28,500
Well, Uncle, Auntie,

26
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:30,530
don't blame En. It was my fault.

27
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:31,820
Just blame me.

28
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:33,620
It's okay.

29
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,180
What do you do?

30
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,460
I'm Peony Corporation's president.

31
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:43,260
His driver.

32
00:02:48,990 --> 00:02:51,240
When he is free, he would provide ride-hailing services.

33
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:54,490
Provide ride-hailing services to get extra gains?

34
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,350
The son of our neighbor Ms. Wang

35
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:58,550
also provides ride-hailing services.

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,700
He can earn tens of thousands yuan a month.

37
00:03:05,430 --> 00:03:06,910
Making money by working, right?

38
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:07,810
It's reasonable and legal.

39
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,850
You get as you give.

40
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:12,980
Yes, especially boys.

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,040
Boys should be independent early

42
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,950
and be responsible.

43
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:22,940
Can you cook?

44
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:23,700
Yes.

45
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,020
Dad, why did you ask that?

46
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:26,660
It's okay.

47
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:28,400
Uncle, Auntie, I can cook.

48
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,500
I usually cook when I'm not busy.

49
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,050
You can cook?

50
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,790
Not many boys can cook nowadays.

Why... Why are you staring at me?

54
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:42,260
Did I say anything wrong? Did I?

55
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,240
Well, Uncle, Auntie, here's the thing.

56
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:44,860
Since childhood,

57
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,780
I've been helping my mom cook.

58
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,770
So I can cook some dishes myself.

59
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:49,510
Don't worry.

60
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:52,020
I will cook more frequently for En in the future.

61
00:03:55,030 --> 00:03:56,790
Have your parents met En?

62
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:57,460
Dad.

63
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,910
What?

64
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,540
I'm sitting here, right?

65
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,850
Well,

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,840
this boy

67
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,380
wants to have my daughter.

68
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:09,340
Can't I ask him some questions?

69
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,580
Can't I?

70
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,220
You can.

71
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:12,980
They haven't met En yet.

72
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:14,360
But don't worry.

73
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:15,780
They can meet her anytime.

74
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,360
No, no, no.

75
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:18,910
They haven't met her, right?

76
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,130
That's better.

77
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,860
Good. Good.

78
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,060
Liu.

79
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:25,620
Lou.

00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,790
Lou.

81
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:28,150
Lou.

82
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:29,940
It's getting late, right?

83
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,700
Go back.

84
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,140
I'm going to walk him out.

85
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:34,940
No need.

86
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,420
Doesn't he have legs?

87
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,620
Can't he walk by himself?

88
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:40,290
En.

89
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:41,490
En, well,

90
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,820
where's the fridge?

91
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,260
Your dad brought you a lot of food.

92
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,460
Let's... Let's put them in the fridge.

93
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:48,050
Well, Lou,

94
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,620
s-sorry.

95
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,690
It's okay, Auntie.

96
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,740
Uncle, Auntie,

97
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,340
I'll visit you at home next time.

98
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,270
I'm leaving.

99
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:05,520
What's wrong with you?

100
00:05:11,180 --> 00:05:12,500
Okay, thank you.

101
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,810
Thank you so much.

102
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,780
The director said

103
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,250
you look more suitable

104
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
for the character.

105
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,870
It will be decided in several days.

106
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:19,740
Get prepared

107
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:20,580
-these days.
-Okay. Okay.

108
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:20,980
Thank you.

109
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,980
Thank you. Thank you.

110
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,570
I will be well prepared.

111
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:25,310
Goodbye. Goodbye.

112
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,980
What... What...

113
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:30,740
What... What happened?

114
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:31,480
Honey.

115
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:33,230
Guess who called me just now.

116
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,040
En?

117
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,750
The producer. The producer!

118
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:38,820
She said I passed the second audition.

119
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,070
They will choose between me and another girl.

120
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,360
But the director is more interested in me.

121
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,110
Really?

122
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:44,740
Gosh.

123
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,540
Look. Look.

124
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:47,500
My heart is beating so fast. I'm so excited.

125
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:49,250
-And she said...
-Calm down.

126
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,820
she'll introduce more resources to me in Beiqing.

127
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,180
Gosh, I'm so lucky.

128
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:56,659
The characters they introduced are all good.

129
00:05:56,860 --> 00:05:59,020
I'm so happy.

130
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:01,070
I'm so excited. So excited.

131
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,460
Are... Are you going out?

132
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:40,760
No. No.

133
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,740
Come here.

134
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,050
What's wrong, Mom?

135
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,400
Sit there.

136
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:06,900
Where's Hai?

137
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:10,080
Her boyfriend is sick and hospitalized.

138
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,360
She went to accompany him.

139
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,550
Are you sure you two live together?

140
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:16,220
Yes, right here.

141
00:07:23,850 --> 00:07:25,850
These are hers?

142
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:27,830
They are not her size.

143
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,110
They are...

144
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:32,590
Mr. Lou...

145
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,900
No. Lou

146
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,640
left them here as spare clothes.

147
00:07:38,320 --> 00:07:39,940
There is his toothbrush in the bathroom.

148
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,720
Because he needs to brush his teeth after eating. He's a neat person.

149
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,390
Keep making up stories.

150
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,610
Turn around.

151
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,450
Look at me.

152
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:52,270
Tell me the truth.

153
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:54,180
Are you living together?

154
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:56,140
What... What are you talking about?

155
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:56,930
No. No.

156
00:07:56,950 --> 00:07:58,350
I'm serious.

157
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:00,250
No matter what,

158
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:02,560
you must take safety precautions.

159
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,940
Okay. Okay.

160
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,220
Mom, don't tell my dad.

161
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:08,090
He'll have hypertension if he knows.

162
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,660
This is a serious matter. Why would I...

163
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,810
Why would I tell him?

164
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,270
But judging from the fabric,

165
00:08:17,460 --> 00:08:20,220
the business suits are quite expensive.

166
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,200
How much does a driver have to earn

167
00:08:24,230 --> 00:08:25,900
to afford this kind of suit?

168
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:29,070
Mom, if I tell you

169
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,240
he is the president,

170
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,140
do you believe it?

171
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:34,679
President?

172
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:37,260
A president came to this shabby place to date you?

173
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:38,460
Who would believe that?

174
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,220
En,

175
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:45,250
you should be cautious.

176
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:46,940
Don't be deceived by a liar.

177
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,810
Don't forget

178
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:52,680
when your cousin got married last year,

179
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:54,670
she thought she married a big boss.

180
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:57,470
Now she has lost everything.

181
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,190
Your uncle was so angry

182
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,540
that he was sent to the hospital.

183
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:03,660
Your dad was furious too.

184
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:04,600
Your dad said

185
00:09:04,630 --> 00:09:06,090
if he meets such a liar,

186
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,820
he will definitely beat him up.

187
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,770
You must be cautious.

188
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,140
Be careful.

189
00:09:13,490 --> 00:09:14,170
Don't worry.

190
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:24,270
Are you cold?

191
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:25,420
No.

192
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,040
Your parents are asleep?

193
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:30,320
Sorry to keep you waiting.

194
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:33,040
Your hands are freezing.

195
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,710
No need to apologize.

196
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:37,300
Right,

197
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,960
why did you tell your parents

198
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:41,420
that I'm a driver?

199
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:44,870
My...

200
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,530
My parents don't like presidents.

201
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,860
If you tell them you are the president,

202
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,100
they won't even let you in.

203
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,440
I'm not joking.

204
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,500
I don't want your parents

205
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,220
to think I'm an dishonest person.

206
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,390
I'm sorry.

207
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:06,880
It's my fault.

208
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,960
I... I will explain to them later.

209
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:21,040
Then it's a deal.

210
00:10:21,580 --> 00:10:22,660
Don't bully me.

211
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:30,310
All right.

212
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:31,620
Go back.

213
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:33,670
If your parents find out,

214
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:34,460
they will really think

215
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:36,380
I'm an unreliable boy.

216
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:38,820
And I won't be able to clear my name no matter what I do.

217
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:43,050
You should go back and rest early too.

218
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:44,700
Take this back first.

219
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:46,340
Okay.

220
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,580
Good night.

221
00:10:53,510 --> 00:11:00,680
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫

222
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:54,290
Good night.

223
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:06,990
♫Wait, I'm afraid to fall alone♫

224
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,160
♫Slow down, let me feel♫

225
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:09,410
Sorry.

♫Your eyes and sight♫

227
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:21,870
♫Stay by my side, be worried♫

228
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:19,960
All right.

229
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:22,420
Go back and keep them company.

231
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:24,990

Bye.

233
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:35,580

♫Little by little♫

239
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,220
What are you looking at?

240
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,560
You look dedicated.

241
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,060
How much can a president's driver make?

242
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,750
Seriously?

243
00:12:20,870 --> 00:12:23,800
Do you believe what they say on the Internet?

244
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,800
Our daughter is in a relationship.

245
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,260
Are you more nervous than her?

246
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,670
I'm not nervous.

247
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:32,980
But I can't

248
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:35,220
let my daughter be deceived.

249
00:12:36,710 --> 00:12:38,380
How old is she?

250
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,530
You should learn to let go when you need to.

251
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:43,780
If everyone treats their future son-in-law like a criminal

252
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:46,740
like you,

253
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,300
who can marry off their daughter?

254
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,180
Look at me. Look at me.

255
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:57,340
Turn around. Turn around.

256
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,110
Come on. Take a look.

257
00:12:58,140 --> 00:12:59,690
What's there to look at? I see you every day.

258
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:00,660
Focus on me.

259
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:04,050
Am I really scary?

260
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:06,280
Horrible?

261
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:07,780
Yes.

262
00:13:08,280 --> 00:13:10,370
I think I usually

263
00:13:10,550 --> 00:13:12,230
talk very politely and nicely.

264
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,590
Very politely.

265
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,060
Like this.

266
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:15,580
What are you doing?

267
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,900
Do you know Bai Wuchang?

268
00:13:17,590 --> 00:13:20,390
You'll look just like him if you wear a white coat.

269
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,030
If our daughter can't find a husband,

270
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,200
it will be your fault.

271
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,620
You scared that boy.

272
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,210
Even if she can't find a husband,

273
00:13:28,230 --> 00:13:29,070
so what?

274
00:13:29,510 --> 00:13:30,470
I'll support her.

275
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:31,860
What's the big deal?

276
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:35,290
You scared me.

277
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,510
I can't just

278
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:37,050
let my daughter

279
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,120
marry a random guy, right?

280
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:41,600
I need to know his background.

281
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,100
What do you know?

282
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:49,830
I have to find it out.

283
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,130
You scared me! What are you doing?

284
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:57,310
Listen.

285
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,070
Our daughter has asked for a leave tomorrow.

286
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:01,380
She will take us out to have fun.

287
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:04,120
You should behave well. Don't cause trouble.

288
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:13,750
Alright.

289
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,580
I hit my head.

290
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,610
It's all your fault.

291
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:30,620
What are you doing?

292
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:31,590
Get up.

293
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:32,260
No.

294
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:34,500
Why are you shy?

295
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,730
It's not like I haven't seen it before.

296
00:14:36,070 --> 00:14:36,750
No.

297
00:14:39,580 --> 00:14:40,700
Listen.

298
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:43,020
After this period of time,

299
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,610
I've figured out something.

300
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,250
Get up.

301
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,630
In this world,

302
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:53,020
there are so many problems.

303
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,150
Living is too tiring.

304
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,960
But only when I'm with you,

305
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:00,090
am I truly relaxed.

306
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,060
At first, I didn't realize

307
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,310
that this is love.

308
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,020
I was quite confused for a while.

309
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:10,810
But now I've figured it out.

310
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:13,250
Staying where I am is not my style.

311
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:17,420
I want to try to be with you.

312
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,440
Try?

313
00:15:19,010 --> 00:15:20,330
You're talking like...

314
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:22,470
You're talking like a scumbag.

315
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:25,390
Is it too easy for you to have me?

316
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:27,020
I should have made it more difficult.

317
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:28,980
Pursuing you properly is romantic.

318
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,470
If you deliberately make it difficult for me, it'll be annoying.

319
00:15:31,310 --> 00:15:31,940
Come here.

320
00:15:35,830 --> 00:15:36,720
What's that sound?

321
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:41,690
Your heart is beating so fast.

322
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:42,790
My...

323
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,890
My... It's always like this.

324
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:49,340
I like you, Wang Zijian.

325
00:15:51,110 --> 00:15:51,580
I...

326
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,640
I like you very, very, very much.

327
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,310
Cao Ya,

328
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:07,610
I like you too.

329
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,900
Everyone knows they're in a relationship now.

330
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,040
They're still pretending.

331
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,630
Now everyone in Peony

332
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,450
is pretending that they don't know.

333
00:16:20,620 --> 00:16:21,390
But

334
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:23,180
actually, everyone knows they are together.

335
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,370
It's just that they don't know

336
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,980
we all know they are together.

337
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:26,740
Have you been

338
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,980
practicing tongue twister recently?

339
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:31,100
I just think they are very funny.

340
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:32,620
They look great together.

341
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,480
A perfect match.

342
00:16:35,220 --> 00:16:35,820
Besides,

343
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,750
I think since my grandmaster met my master,

344
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,960
he has been very lucky.

345
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:43,680
My master must be very auspicious.

346
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:45,730
But my master's hard work

347
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:46,930
also played a significant role.

348
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:49,230
My grandmaster mentioned once

349
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,370
that he wanted to run a dining saloon.

350
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,300
Later, I saw my master

351
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:54,990
searching information

352
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,870
on buffet dining saloons several times.

353
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:57,660
Dining saloon?

354
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,080
You mean Lou Yuan wants to run a dining saloon?

355
00:17:01,900 --> 00:17:04,200
I... I shouldn't have said that, right?

356
00:17:04,849 --> 00:17:06,010
Are you his sister?

357
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,859
You are my sister.

358
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,630
Why can't you tell me?

359
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,839
Brother, my lunch break will be over.

360
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,760
I'm leaving.

361
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,800
I'll talk to you next time.

362
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:15,569
Bye.

363
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,359
Dining saloon?

364
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,220
Peony wants to run a dining saloon.

365
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,300
Come in.

366
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:43,070
What is this?

367
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:48,010
[Internship Certificate]

368
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,110
Internship certificate?

369
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,260
Your internship is going to end, right?

370
00:17:53,450 --> 00:17:55,480
After Mr. Wang transferred me to the Marketing Department,

371
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:57,460
I was transferred to Shanghai to do things.

[Internship Certificate]

373
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:58,580
Look at me.

374
00:17:59,260 --> 00:17:59,980
I've lost weight.

375
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:01,860
Get some nutrition after you go back to your campus.

376
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:02,830
After graduation,

welcome to our company.

378
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,460
Miss Cao, do I still have a chance?

379

The gate of our company

I'm talking about you.

382

My gate is locked.

383
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,360
I'm not as good as Mr. Wang,

384
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,100
but

385
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,780
I can also be very nice to you.

386
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,240
And I'm very young.

387
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:23,500
I think he's better.

388
00:18:24,190 --> 00:18:24,910
You're late.

389
00:18:27,180 --> 00:18:27,820
Fine.

390
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,390
I wish you happy.

391
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:30,810
Thank you.

How did it go with Eighty-two Studio?

398

You're right.

399

They took the initiative to come to me.

400
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,600
We've reached an agreement.

401
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:05,740
I've sent the contract.

402
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,050
It should be signed soon.

403

Okay, good.

What should we do next?

405

I have my own plan.

Is it Lou?

407

But he's a driver.

411

Although he's a president's driver,

412
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,600
it's not promising, right?

413
00:19:55,100 --> 00:19:55,820
Dad, Mom,

414
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:57,810
I have something to tell you.

Actually, Lou Yuan is not a driver.

How about this? Mr. Li,

422
00:20:19,530 --> 00:20:20,460
please wait for me upstairs.

Okay.

Why are you eating here?

431
00:20:38,090 --> 00:20:40,220
I was talking about you with my parents,

432
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:41,380
and you showed up.

433
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:45,350
He's my client.

434
00:20:45,500 --> 00:20:47,400
He's a real boss.

435
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:49,160
Don't be angry.

436
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:50,630
Last time, I didn't have time

437
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,660
to explain to you.

438
00:20:53,060 --> 00:20:53,690
Well,

I happen to have time tomorrow.

440
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,460
I'll drive and show you around

441

450

If you are with him,

451
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,020
aren't you worried?

452
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:22,930
What's wrong with you?

453
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:25,000
A president's driver is not okay.

454
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:26,430
A president is not okay either.

455
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,630
Why are you so picky?

456
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,160
I... I think he's good.

457
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,580
Can't you be more positive?

458
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,080
What... What do you know?

459
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,490
You're shortsighted.

460
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:37,970
He's a president.

461
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:39,660
His family is rich.

462
00:21:39,690 --> 00:21:40,400
So what?

463
00:21:40,530 --> 00:21:42,170
If something bad happens,

464
00:21:42,190 --> 00:21:44,060
it doesn't matter even if he fails.

465
00:21:44,090 --> 00:21:45,130
What about my daughter?

466
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:46,600
My daughter is with him.

467
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:48,470
It will influence the rest of her life if he fails.

468
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,120
Dad, can you say something auspicious?

469
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:51,660
Right.

470
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,770
Can't you just hope for good things for her?

471
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:55,120
In times of peace, prepare for war.

This way, Uncle, Auntie.

This is your first time here.

478

Let me introduce.

479
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,260
This place

480
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:10,490
is called Luodai Ancient Town.

481
00:22:10,650 --> 00:22:11,410
It dates back

482
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:13,410
to the Three Kingdoms period.

483
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,310
It's time-honored.

484
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,430
This ancient town is situated in Longquanyi District, Chengdu.

is also a time-honored street.

487
00:22:21,300 --> 00:22:22,660
It's well preserved.

architectural style of Ming and Qing dynasties.

493
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,940
Why is it called Luodai Ancient Town?

494
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:33,940
It is said that

495
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:34,660
back then, Liu Shan

496
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,720
left his belt here.

497
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:38,340

Didn't he get angry?

571
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,990
Mr. Lou is not that kind of person.

572
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,190
He's very generous.

573
00:24:51,650 --> 00:24:53,180
If he stands in your shoes,

574
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:54,480
I'm sure he can understand you.

575
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,270
Tell me the truth.

How much do you like him?

577
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,990
Do you really like him?

578
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:05,470
Do you really want to marry him

579
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,610
and spend the rest of your life with him?

580
00:25:07,670 --> 00:25:08,380
Do you?

581
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,860
I really like him.

582
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:16,350
But I haven't thought about those things.

Don't. Don't.

584
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:21,590
You have to think about the future.

585
00:25:21,750 --> 00:25:23,700
You are not young anymore.

586
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:24,300
I...

587
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:27,220
I just want to make money for you.

588
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:29,100
And I'm an adult now.

589
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,310
Dad, don't worry about me.

590
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes, actually,

591
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,590
I didn't mean to force you.

592
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,110
But I'm really worried.

593
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:40,210
-You two…
-Dad.

594
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,890
I know what you said.

595
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:47,540
Yes. We are different.

596
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,740
-Yes.
-It's an objective fact.

597
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:51,520
But...

598
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,050
I like him.

599
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:58,760
And I like him more than I know.

600
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:02,620
He is a president.

601
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,270
He is cool.

602
00:26:04,830 --> 00:26:05,580
But

603
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,460
he is willing

604
00:26:07,790 --> 00:26:09,550
to be with an ordinary customer service staff member like me.

605
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,210
He would take me to eat

606
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,950
my favorite hairy crabs.

607
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:17,050
He would make me happy when I'm unhappy.

608
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:19,060
He would also act cute to me

609
00:26:19,060 --> 00:26:20,560
and ask me not to bully him.

610
00:26:22,430 --> 00:26:23,130
Anyway,

611
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,700
you should trust me.

Don't you trust your daughter?

Peony's dining saloon

00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:35,460
is a comprehensive food experience store

615
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,180
combining product traceability with on-site cooking.

616
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,300
Our current plan

617
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:41,020
is to lay a foundation

618
00:26:41,020 --> 00:26:43,160
in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen first.

619
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:46,210
And then we'll make adjustments

620
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:46,820
according to the local flavors.

621
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,730
-First-tier cities are not enough.
-So the cities...

[Localized layout in first-tier cities]

623
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:50,620
You should also pay attention to middle-sized and small cities.

00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:52,480
What is our concept?

The taste of home.

626
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:54,860
So

627
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,580
we must

628
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:58,060
expand the retail channels.

629
00:26:58,500 --> 00:26:59,740
We must let more people

eat our sauces.

631
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,220
If so,

her grandson asked for it.

If I don't teach Triangle a lesson,

they won't know who is the sauce ancestor.
