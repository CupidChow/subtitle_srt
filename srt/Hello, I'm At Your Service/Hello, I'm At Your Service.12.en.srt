Then I fell asleep.

383
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:06,280
This house was almost burnt down.

384
00:16:06,550 --> 00:16:08,830
I told you to study hard,

385
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,830
but you would like to come to cause me trouble.

386
00:16:11,550 --> 00:16:13,740
I didn't.

387
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:15,300
You almost burned the yard.

388
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:16,750
Wasn't it a trouble?

389
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,220
Come to think of it,

390
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:20,940
I was really happy back then.

391
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,940
You were indulged in studying the sauce.

392
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:23,500
I

393
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,700
sold them with loud calls

394
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,930
beside our stall.

395
00:16:29,060 --> 00:16:30,240
What's that to be happy about?

396
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:32,510
Life was so hard back then.

397
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:35,050
It's a good life now.

398
00:16:35,900 --> 00:16:37,120
Although it was a bit hard,

399
00:16:37,350 --> 00:16:38,670
I was really happy.

400
00:16:40,450 --> 00:16:42,280
Mom, I know

401
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:43,820
you can't let go of the company

402
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,660
or

403
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,420
these things that have been with you all your life.

404
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:49,130
Although you said you'd entrust the company to me,

405
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:51,190
you still can't help caring about it.

406
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,340
Actually, we can

407
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:53,500
be like before.

408
00:16:53,530 --> 00:16:55,200
You just focus on researching the sauces.

409
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:56,650
I'll be responsible for selling it.

410
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,500
It's simple, isn't it?

411
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:02,820
En is here.

412
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,359
Come here.

413
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:07,790
Go back to your work.

414
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,700
No, I have no plans today.

415
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:10,890
You look like a model,

416
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:12,020
not a worker.

417
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:13,060
Get back to work.

418
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,319
I have En here.

419
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,720
Go. Go.

420
00:17:17,430 --> 00:17:18,310
I'm leaving.

421
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,770
Auntie, did I come at the wrong time?

422
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:27,050
How could that be?

423
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:28,230
He should have left.

424
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,340
This brat

425
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:31,940
is persuading me with our kinship.

426
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:33,440
He thinks I can't tell.

427
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:34,580
Come on.

428
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:35,260
Try it.

429
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,000
The sauce smells so good.

430
00:17:37,070 --> 00:17:38,080
How is it?

431
00:17:38,560 --> 00:17:39,540
It really smells good.

432
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:42,060
I need to cook it for a while.

433
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:42,820
It'll be ready soon.

434
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:43,590
Sit there.

435
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:44,780
Do you need my help?

436
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:45,620
No, no.

437
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,340
Sit over there.

438
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:46,780
Okay.

439
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:48,230
I'll give you a little to taste.

440
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:49,170
Thank you. Auntie.

441
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:03,840
Coming.

442
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:07,380
Here.

443
00:18:07,410 --> 00:18:08,380
Thank you. Auntie.

444
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,860
-Fresh steamed buns.
-Thank you.

445
00:18:11,260 --> 00:18:11,740
Here.

446
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:12,520
Okay.

447
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,090
-Have a taste.
-I’ll eat it.

448
00:18:14,180 --> 00:18:14,900
Eat.

449
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,290
How is it?

450
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:20,500
Have some sauce.

451
00:18:21,820 --> 00:18:23,450
Steamed buns with sauce.

452
00:18:23,780 --> 00:18:24,900
The delicacy in the mortal world.

453
00:18:25,530 --> 00:18:27,310
It is the taste of my childhood.

454
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,340
Back then, I just graduated from university.

455
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:29,820
I had no money

456
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:30,860
and was reluctant to order takeout.

457
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,140
Every year when my mom came to see me,

458
00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,850
she would bring me two cans of sauce.

459
00:18:35,060 --> 00:18:37,660
I survived by dipping the steamed buns in the sauce.

460
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,260
En.

461
00:18:40,470 --> 00:18:42,580
Does this sauce taste like your mom's homemade sauce?

462
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:43,590
Yes.

463
00:18:46,280 --> 00:18:47,660
Look at the way you eat it.

464
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,230
Just like when Zhuang was young.

465
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:55,110
The first time I cooked sauce

466
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,660
was here.

467
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,120
Before Zhuang went to high school,

468
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,860
we had lived in this yard.

469
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:05,430
This place

470
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:07,780
is the starting point of our Peony company.

471
00:19:10,830 --> 00:19:12,440
The first time I made sauce

472
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:14,620
because Zhuang was sick.

473
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,250
He couldn't eat anything.

474
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:18,420
He just wanted to eat the sauce I made.

475
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:20,650
When I cooked the sauce,

476
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,910
he ate the big steamed bun with it,

477
00:19:21,930 --> 00:19:23,180
and it gets tastier with every bite.

478
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:26,160
But I cooked too much sauce.

479
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:27,220
I had no choice.

480
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,670
I could only send some

481
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,430
to my neighbors and friends.

482
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,570
I didn't expect them

483
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,660
to ask me for it afterward.

484
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,780
They said my sauce was so delicious.

485
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:38,590
Then I thought

486
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,220
I might as well open a sauce shop.

487
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,810
First, I could share

488
00:19:43,830 --> 00:19:45,680
the sauce with everyone.

489
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,010
Second,

490
00:19:47,010 --> 00:19:48,260
I could also provide some income

491
00:19:48,450 --> 00:19:50,180
to the family to supplement.

492
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,400
I made the sauce.

493
00:19:52,690 --> 00:19:53,380
But...

494
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:56,120
I was too shy to talk to people.

495
00:19:57,550 --> 00:19:59,030
I didn't dare to shout.

496
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,800
No passer-by would buy it.

497
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:07,520
[Peony]

498
00:20:03,260 --> 00:20:04,900
Mudan, are you still busy?

499
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,540
Guifen.

500
00:20:05,540 --> 00:20:07,180
Come on, take a bottle home and eat.

501
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:07,900
No need.

502
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,020
I can't sell it anyway.

503
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,460
Take one back and eat.

504
00:20:10,590 --> 00:20:11,790
Thank you.

505
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:12,860
Let me try it.

506
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:13,910
Later,

507
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,910
I saw those sellers

508
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:18,380
have to shout it out.

509
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,820
I learnt from them.

510
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,750
Everyone, have a taste.

511
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:27,500
[Peony]

512
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:25,380
It's authentic sauce. Five yuan per bottle.

513
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:28,780
It worked after I shouted it out.

514
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,850
My peony paste

515
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:32,810
was getting more and more popular.

516
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:35,060
Come often.

517
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,220
Let's buy some more.

518
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:37,340
Boss, how much is it?

519
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,320
Now, my sauce

520
00:20:40,710 --> 00:20:42,480
is not just a kind of sauce.

521
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:45,950
It's also a memory

522
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:47,350
of those days.

523
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,410
So the sauce I sell

524
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,690
will never be outdated.

525
00:20:55,990 --> 00:20:56,740
Come on.

526
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:57,290
Boss, give me one.

527
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:57,760
Thank you.

528
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,370
Give me two bottles.

529
00:20:58,420 --> 00:20:59,340
Come again if you like it.

530
00:20:59,470 --> 00:20:59,940
Okay.

531
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:00,940
I'm too busy.

532
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,650
Here.

533
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:02,750
Thank you.

534
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
How much is this?

535
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:04,780
Five yuan for one bottle.

536
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,730
I'll put the money here.

537
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:07,980
Here.

538
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:20,620
En.

539
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,140
Mr. Lou, why are you still here?

540
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:27,300
I drove here.

541
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:28,140
Let me drive you home.

542
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:30,480
Thank you. But I called a taxi.

543
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,410
Are you getting in the car by yourself,

544
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,960
or would you like me to help you?

545
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,250
Dear listeners.

546
00:21:45,450 --> 00:21:47,330
Are you having trouble finding the right opportunity

547
00:21:47,350 --> 00:21:49,210
to confess your feelings to your beloved?

548
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,690
Let's talk about

549
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,880
how adults express their love.

550
00:22:12,570 --> 00:22:13,860
Mr. Lou, I'm sorry

551
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:15,300
for disturbing you today.

552
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:16,540
It's okay.

553
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,380
Even if you don't come,

554
00:22:18,410 --> 00:22:19,690
our conversation can't continue.

555
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,620
You don't have to

556
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:22,780
blame yourself.

557
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:26,100
Actually, Auntie Lou

558
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:27,610
isn't mad at you.

559
00:22:30,070 --> 00:22:31,000
I know.

560
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,760
And I know

561
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,370
what this sauce means to my mom.

562
00:22:37,810 --> 00:22:39,440
When my dad was still alive,

563
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,540
my dad loved this sauce.

564
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,460
After my dad passed away,

565
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,820
my mom raised me alone.

566
00:22:46,570 --> 00:22:47,630
She had a hard time.

567
00:22:47,670 --> 00:22:48,410
I know it.

568
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:50,380
So this sauce

569
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,060
is not just a jar of sauce,

570
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:54,160
but also my whole childhood.

571
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,680
Then why did you...

00:29:57,400 --> 00:29:59,630
the braised pork my grandpa made.

762
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,940
It is so delicious.

763
00:30:00,940 --> 00:30:01,900
Every New Year,

764
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:04,310
it's a must-be New Year's Eve dish at home.

765
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:07,460
Although it's a little oily,

766

the meat is a little greasy,

767
00:30:09,060 --> 00:30:10,020

781
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:40,340
I can tell it's made from my sauce.

782
00:30:40,340 --> 00:30:40,940
Right?

There's no sugar, either.

It tastes terrible.

810

00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:01,070
Where is this place?

953
00:38:03,070 --> 00:38:04,300
You'll know soon.

954
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,820
It's so cold,

955
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:11,000
and you wear so little.

956
00:38:18,250 --> 00:38:19,490
I remember you said

957
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,710
you loved watching fireworks on snowy days.

958
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:25,580
Look.

959
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,320
♫You're like a beam of light♫

960
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,940
♫A warm light♫

961
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:54,230
♫Imprinted the distance we've been looking at♫

962
00:38:54,590 --> 00:38:57,590
♫For many years♫

963
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,030
♫If a message♫

964
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:05,160
♫Can also imprint the time♫

965
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,330
En.

966
00:39:04,630 --> 00:39:06,120
About what happened that night,

967
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:08,380
♫Please don't forget♫

968
00:39:06,950 --> 00:39:07,760
there's a misunderstanding.

969
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:12,760
♫There's also me standing here♫

970
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,130
You didn't beat me

971
00:39:10,950 --> 00:39:12,110
but stamped on me.

972
00:39:15,140 --> 00:39:21,580
♫I just want to be your sun♫

973
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:27,890
♫I'll leave a beam of light in your heart♫

974
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,940
♫One day♫

975
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:36,750
♫You will follow the light and come to me♫

976
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:40,790
♫Even if I'm not by your side♫

977
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,750
Oh no.

978
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:40,130
I remembered.

979
00:39:41,690 --> 00:39:45,810
♫I'll do my best for you♫

980
00:39:41,870 --> 00:39:42,580
En.

981
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:44,890
Be my girlfriend.

982
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,420
Are you okay?

983
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:53,500
What do you mean?

984
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:55,480
Am I talking about me?

985
00:39:55,510 --> 00:39:57,010
I'm talking about a friend of mine.

986
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:00,220
Your friend.

987
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,470
I was wondering why you came out as soon as I called today.

988
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:04,820
It turned out you've been frustrated in a relationship.

989
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,170
Your friend.

990
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:11,840
Your friend has been frustrated.

991
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:12,670
A toast to your friend.

992
00:40:12,690 --> 00:40:13,130
Cheers.

993
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:13,720
Cheers.

994
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:19,100
What should I do to help?

995
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:19,850
Tell me.

996
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,100
The atmosphere has already reached this point.

997
00:40:22,230 --> 00:40:24,360
Why couldn't she just accept me naturally?

998
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,890
Sometimes,

999
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:29,350
people just can't.

1000
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:32,230
Let me ask you a few questions.

1001
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:33,090
Answer me honestly.

1002
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:35,530
Am I not proactive enough?

1003
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:36,950
No.

1004
00:40:37,170 --> 00:40:38,530
Am I not good enough?

1005
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,220
Well.

1006
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,190
I don't know.

1007
00:40:43,730 --> 00:40:44,880
What do you know?

1008
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:46,250
I called you out

1009
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,940
to ask you to give me some advice.

1010
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:49,160
But you didn't give me any.

1011
00:40:50,150 --> 00:40:51,830
As the saying goes,

1012
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,180
the virtuous woman is afraid of the persistent suitor.

1013
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,560
Be persistent

1014
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:57,670
and start an intense pursuit.

1015
00:40:58,100 --> 00:40:58,740
Be persistent.

1016
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,140
Have you tried it?

1017
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,310
Yes.

1018
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,090
How is it?

1019
00:41:06,750 --> 00:41:07,390
It's useless.

1020
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:13,640
But

1021
00:41:14,180 --> 00:41:15,390
it depends on the target.

1022
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,010
En always does what you ask at work.

1023
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:20,720
Don't you allow her

1024
00:41:20,760 --> 00:41:22,180
to be capricious in love?

1025
00:41:22,460 --> 00:41:23,180
Little girls

1026
00:41:23,180 --> 00:41:25,420
won't fall in love with you easily.

1027
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:28,310
If she says it's no good, it means it's good.

1028
00:41:28,750 --> 00:41:30,700
If she says no, it means yes.

1029
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:32,490
What is she rejecting you for?

1030
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:33,580
She's testing you.

1031
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,800
You have to pester her.

1032
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,280
Just remember two words.

1033
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,040
Be persistent.

1034
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:41,200
Be persistent.

1035
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,430
Be persistent?

1036
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,290
I said no.

1037
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,340
Of course, I mean it.

1038
00:41:45,340 --> 00:41:47,180
It's not about being reserved.

1039
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,010
Mr. Lou is my client.

1040
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,750
I can't date my client.

1041
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,070
Forget about work,

1042
00:41:52,330 --> 00:41:55,110
in terms of looks, family, and personality,

1043
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,330
you can't find another one with a browsing lamp.

1044
00:41:57,980 --> 00:41:59,420
You hesitated before.

1045
00:41:59,440 --> 00:42:00,680
But he confessed to you.

1046
00:42:00,710 --> 00:42:02,030
What are you worried about?

1047
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,400
Let me ask you.

1048
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:04,340
Do you like him?

1049
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:07,670
I do.

1050
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:08,740
That's fine.

1051
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:09,930
Call him

1052
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,080
and tell him you regret it,

1053
00:42:11,110 --> 00:42:12,130
you like him,

1054
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:13,920
and your head was kicked by a donkey just now.

1055
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:15,500
Yes, my head was kicked by a donkey.

1056
00:42:15,530 --> 00:42:16,020
But

1057
00:42:16,220 --> 00:42:18,180
the most important rule for Party B is

1058
00:42:18,300 --> 00:42:21,620
not to fall in love with your client.

1059
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,460
I don't care about the rules.

1060
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,340
I only know

1061
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,020
you're avoiding your feelings.

1062
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,560
I've seen you grovel and flatter so many clients.

1063
00:42:28,710 --> 00:42:31,440
You throw tantrums and use every means possible.

1064
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,050
Can you show it to Lou Yuan?

1065
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:35,820
No.

1066
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:38,160
Because you have him in your heart.

1067
00:42:38,580 --> 00:42:39,760
You want to

1068
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,690
show the demeanor of a girl

1069
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,590
in front of him.

1070
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,780
Think about it.

1071
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:46,770
I need to make a call.

1072
00:42:52,330 --> 00:42:54,860
How about I resign?

1073
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,460
No, no, no.

1074
00:42:58,110 --> 00:42:59,530
Work is the most important.

1075
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:03,310
So annoying.

1076
00:43:07,640 --> 00:43:09,020
You don't need to be so formal

1077
00:43:09,170 --> 00:43:10,400
between the two of us.

1078
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:12,320
I'm not angry anymore.

♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫

1080

1082
00:43:19,370 --> 00:43:21,290
