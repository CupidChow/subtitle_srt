00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:32,870
What is it?

569
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,550
Just tell me.

570
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:40,380
I found a job at Ba'er Creative.

571
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,080
You went to Dong Dong En's company?

572
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,320
It's just that you mentioned it,

573
00:24:43,350 --> 00:24:44,820
and I thought it sounded fun, so I went.

574
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:46,290
Plus,

575
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:49,250
those people are all very open-hearted.

576
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:51,020
They're always having a happy time.

577
00:24:52,370 --> 00:24:53,260
You know what?

578
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:54,830
On my first day of work,

579
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,100
they dared to take me to the client's office

580
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:58,520
and tell me everything.

581
00:24:58,850 --> 00:24:59,690
Besides,

582
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:01,900
they're so poor that they only have one power strip left,

583
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:04,060
and they might go out of business with a gust of wind.

584
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:05,960
Their biggest advantage they could possibly rely on

585
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:09,050
is the relationship between Dong Dong'en and Lou Yuan.

586
00:25:09,510 --> 00:25:10,120
Qi.

587
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,620
I really don't think they're worth your concern.

588
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,190
Zhenzhen.

589
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,970
You like them too?

590
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
I don't.

591
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,560
I really don't.

592
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:19,690
Truly.

593
00:25:20,830 --> 00:25:21,430
Zhenzhen.

594
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,740
I'll agree

595
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:25,070
to whatever you want to do.

596
00:25:25,550 --> 00:25:26,630
I promise.

597
00:25:27,090 --> 00:25:29,290
But you also have to promise me one thing.

598
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:30,850
What is it?

599
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,270
That no matter which day in the future,

600
00:25:34,090 --> 00:25:36,150
you'll choose to stand by my side.

601
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:38,240
Okay, that's for sure.

602
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:44,050
[Peony]

603
00:25:53,510 --> 00:25:54,350
Mr. Wan.

604
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:56,620
You're back.

605
00:25:58,300 --> 00:25:59,600
You don't look well.

606
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:01,560
You didn't sleep well last night?

607
00:26:02,110 --> 00:26:02,830
I'm fine.

608
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,530
Mr. Wan, are you watching the advertisement of Peony?

609
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:07,760
It's quite interesting.

610
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,860
The operation of Peony is quite interesting.

611
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:15,390
Is this what they call

612
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,160
going viral?

613
00:26:17,670 --> 00:26:20,080
These kinds of trends usually have a limited lifespan.

614
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,930
They're forgotten once the hype dies down.

615
00:26:22,290 --> 00:26:24,100
The future development of Triangle

616
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:26,390
should still rely on solid new projects,

617
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:28,550
those that revolve around the consumer.

618
00:26:29,370 --> 00:26:30,010
Very good.

619
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,650
You have your own judgment.

620
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:32,940
I'm relieved.

621
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,810
Although Peony Company is currently on a strong momentum,

622
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,840
with you

623
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:40,350
in Triangle,

624
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:42,300
I feel we're not inferior than they are.

625
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,450
We also have young talents.

626
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,270
Mr. Wan, you're flattering me.

627
00:26:46,420 --> 00:26:48,900
This is just what I should be doing.

628
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:52,370
Young man, don't belittle yourself.

629
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,930
When I was as young as you,

630
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,680
I wasn't as capable as you are.

631
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,750
Young people have enthusiasm and drive,

632
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,430
qualities that older people like us

633
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:03,960
wish we still had.

634
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:06,960
Seeing you now

635
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,460
reminds me of my younger self.

636
00:27:12,310 --> 00:27:15,180
I'm about to retire.

637
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,050
Come on.

638
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:16,940
Mr. Wan.

639
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:17,470
Sit.

640
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,630
Have a seat.

641
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,990
The future of the company

642
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:28,220
will rely on young people like you.

643
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Do you understand what I mean?

644
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:34,910
Mr. Wan, don’t worry.

645
00:27:35,790 --> 00:27:37,700
I won’t let you down.

646
00:27:38,990 --> 00:27:39,580
Good luck.

647
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:56,750
I'm going to work.

648
00:27:57,650 --> 00:27:59,020
Just thinking that I won't see you

649
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,860
when I go to work later

650
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:01,350
makes me not want to go.

651
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:04,090
Well, aren't we going to have dinner together tonight?

652
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:07,120
I'm leaving.

653
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:09,740
Give me a kiss.

654
00:28:11,710 --> 00:28:12,710
I have to go to work.

655
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:13,190
You...

656
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:16,920
That's more like it.

657
00:28:17,870 --> 00:28:19,300
It's great to have a boyfriend.

658
00:28:21,350 --> 00:28:23,880
They are actually showing affection at the company entrance.

659
00:28:24,830 --> 00:28:27,770
Why doesn't Lou Yuan publicly acknowledge his relationship with En?

660
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,270
En, that silly girl.

661
00:28:47,270 --> 00:28:47,920
En.

662
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:53,440
Sit down.

663
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:00,890
What's wrong?

664
00:29:01,250 --> 00:29:04,190
Tell us if you're wronged.

665
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,290
We can help you vent your frustrations.

666
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,100
Don't suffer alone.

667
00:29:10,170 --> 00:29:11,330
What did I do?

668
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:12,940
Stop pretending.

669
00:29:13,810 --> 00:29:16,190
We all know

670
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:18,230
Lou Yuan is with you

671
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:20,180
and he doesn't want to reveal your relationship.

672
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:22,990
Don't be fooled by his sweet words.

673
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,840
All scumbags are the same.

674
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:27,270
Can he be irresponsible if he doesn't make it public?

675
00:29:27,300 --> 00:29:28,750
When he leaves without a care,

676
00:29:28,770 --> 00:29:30,030
and you're left alone,

677
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:32,090
crying and suffering,

678
00:29:32,120 --> 00:29:33,360
we'll feel sorry for you.

679
00:29:36,680 --> 00:29:37,670
You've misunderstood.

680
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,550
It's me who didn't want to go public.

681
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,680
Earlier, we were business partners,

682
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:45,980
and I was afraid of gossip.

683
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:47,620
But now that we're no longer collaborating,

684
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:49,580
I can be open about it.

685
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:50,940
Tonight at 8 o'clock,

686
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:52,310
the two of us will treat you to dinner.

687
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,490
But

688
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,100
you're not allowed to make him drink,

689
00:29:55,340 --> 00:29:56,600
not allowed to bring up my past,

690
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,580
and

691
00:29:57,690 --> 00:29:59,130
no mischief, understood?

692
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,940
If we can't say anything,

693
00:30:00,970 --> 00:30:03,320
it's just like having dinner with a client.

694
00:30:04,090 --> 00:30:05,620
He truly is our client.

695
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,510
But let's be clear from the start.

696
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,080
If he's inviting us to dinner

697
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,150
in his capacity as our client,

698
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:12,860
then he's the boss,

699
00:30:12,890 --> 00:30:13,750
and we certainly won't

700
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,660
create any trouble.

701
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,820
But if he's inviting us to dinner

702
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:18,820
as your boyfriend,

703
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,140
then he's a piglet

704
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:22,830
who got a free lunch from all of us.

705
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:24,700
We must make him eat, drink,

706
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,250
smile, and foot the bill.

707
00:30:26,310 --> 00:30:27,460
There's no escaping it for him.

708
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,340
Do you believe

709
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,330
I'll send this message to him exactly as it is?

710
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,650
Let's see if this piglet will give us orders in the future.

711
00:30:37,170 --> 00:30:37,930
Dong Dong‘en.

712
00:30:38,060 --> 00:30:39,330
You've only just started dating,

713
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,420
and you're already siding with your boyfriend?

714
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:43,880
It's settled then.

715
00:30:44,070 --> 00:30:44,840
Remember,

716
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:45,580
no messing around.

717
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,260
En has changed.

718
00:30:53,230 --> 00:30:54,200
Actually,

719
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,980
you don't need to worry too much.

720
00:30:56,290 --> 00:30:57,660
En isn't the type to be

721
00:30:57,690 --> 00:30:59,410
emotional in a relationship.

722
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:00,740
Just let things flow naturally.

723
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,910
I think

724
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:03,260
that any romance that En is missing,

725
00:31:03,290 --> 00:31:04,930
Mr. Lou can make up for.

726
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:06,440
As long as En is fine.

727
00:31:06,810 --> 00:31:08,300
Piglet, mind your own business.

728
00:31:14,310 --> 00:31:14,910
Who is it?

729
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,770
Yuan.

730
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:18,180
Coming.

731
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,760
Yuan.

732
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,520
Surprise!

733
00:31:22,560 --> 00:31:23,500
Why are you here?

734
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,170
I'm here to hide from Cao Ya.

735
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:27,070
Why are you dressing

736
00:31:27,180 --> 00:31:28,700
so provocatively and going out at this hour?

737
00:31:29,790 --> 00:31:30,420
Listen.

738
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,980
I have dinner plans with people from Ba'er tonight.

739
00:31:31,980 --> 00:31:33,020
I don't have time for you.

740
00:31:33,590 --> 00:31:35,570
En doesn't give you a proper status,

741
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:37,190
why are you still so proactive?

742
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:39,300
You have to earn your status.

743
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,170
By the way,

744
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,900
have you resolved things with Cao Ya?

745
00:31:43,550 --> 00:31:46,150
She was just in the mood for some eye candy,

746
00:31:46,550 --> 00:31:48,260
admiring my beauty,

747
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:50,200
nothing more.

748
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:53,170
You are so narcissistic,

749
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,920
claiming to be a beauty.

750
00:31:55,530 --> 00:31:57,260
I'm versatile,

751
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:58,210
cute, and domineering at the same time,

752
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,740
active like a fitness enthusiast,

753
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,320
and calm like a charming gentleman.

754
00:32:01,340 --> 00:32:03,500
Which of my ex-girlfriends didn't give me a five-star rating?

755
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:04,810
Tell me.

756
00:32:05,530 --> 00:32:06,620
But even with all your talents,

757
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,060
don't you still seek refuge from me?

758
00:32:08,350 --> 00:32:09,200
Also,

759
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,860
you know Cao Ya's temper.

760
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,340
Be careful.

761
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:15,160
I suggest you two should have a face-to-face conversation.

762
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,190
I'm leaving.

763
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:20,280
Are you just going to watch me suffer here alone?

764
00:32:20,310 --> 00:32:21,900
Lou Yuan, I was wrong about you.

765
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,230
What you're doing now

766
00:32:23,250 --> 00:32:24,530
is like a scumbag who forgets his old love

767
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,130
when he finds a new one.

768
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:29,760
How about I call Cao Ya over for you?

769
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:33,290
Mr. Lou, have a safe journey.

770
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,990
I can stay here alone.

771
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:35,590
Good luck.

772
00:32:39,150 --> 00:32:40,230
Are you really leaving?

773
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:46,830
You put romance before friendship.

[THE BALVENIE]

788
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,860
Sir, let me ask you a question.

789
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,550
What is love?

790
00:33:45,550 --> 00:33:47,100
I'm asking you

791
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,420
what love is.

792
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:51,180
I don't know what love is.

793
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:51,900
But I know

794
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,440
if you throw up here, you have to pay 800 yuan.

795
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,890
-I won’t.
-Cao Ya.

796
00:33:56,910 --> 00:33:57,970
Is she your girlfriend?

797
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,660
My friend.

798
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:01,220
-Okay. I’ll leave her to you.
-Thank you.

799
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:01,780
Thank you.

800
00:34:01,780 --> 00:34:02,260
It's okay.

00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:06,260
Yes.

804
00:34:06,550 --> 00:34:08,639
Why are you avoiding me?

805
00:34:08,830 --> 00:34:10,920
Why are you avoiding me?

806
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,460
I couldn't even see you.

807
00:34:12,949 --> 00:34:14,550
You're drunk. I'll take you home.

I don't want to lose you.

You know what?

814
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,530
While you were hiding from me,

815
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:35,830
I was so upset.

816
00:34:36,989 --> 00:34:38,100
I've thought about it.

817
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:41,219
I tried not to think about you.

818
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,300
I tried to find someone else.

819
00:34:42,469 --> 00:34:45,500
I tried to let everything go back to the beginning.

820
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,900
But I found that

821
00:34:49,480 --> 00:34:50,250
I couldn't make it.

First,

836
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:56,980
thank Mr. Lou for your hospitality tonight.

837
00:35:57,070 --> 00:35:59,810
You have prepared such a feast for us.

838
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,100
We're flattered.

839
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:03,660
It makes me feel like a client.

840
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:05,150
To Mr. Lou.

841
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:06,530
Let's not drink for now.

842
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
Have a seat.

843
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,390
Don't call me Mr. Lou today.

844
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:12,420
Just call me Lou Yuan.

845
00:36:12,450 --> 00:36:14,990
It's just a common meal.

846
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,620
Since you said so,

847
00:36:16,620 --> 00:36:17,540
I won't stand on ceremony.

848
00:36:18,550 --> 00:36:20,590
En's parents are in her hometown.

849
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,610
We are

850
00:36:21,610 --> 00:36:23,750
like her family.

851
00:36:24,190 --> 00:36:25,340
So if En

852
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:26,340
is bullied

853
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,580
or wronged,

854
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,960
we wouldn't like it.

855
00:36:29,630 --> 00:36:31,060
He's our client after all.

Let me propose a toast to you.

860
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:46,810
Ke and Chunhua are kind of En's elders.

The rest of you from Ba'er

862
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,590

863
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:52,950
We've been working together before.

864
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,430
This is the first time

865
00:36:54,650 --> 00:36:56,050
we're having dinner in private.

866
00:36:56,430 --> 00:36:57,060
I don't know

867
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,740
how to say pretty things.

868
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,000
But there's one thing.

869
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:01,700
I hope you can rest assured.

870
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:04,420
I really love En.

871
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:08,130
En is like a little sun.

872
00:37:08,350 --> 00:37:09,580
She brings warmth and happiness

873
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,140
to everyone around her.

874
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,070
But there are times when the little sun is tired.

875
00:37:15,050 --> 00:37:15,820
So I want to

876
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:17,860
be the shoulder that En can lean on.

877
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:21,180
I want to do my best to take care of her,

878
00:37:21,580 --> 00:37:23,640
protect her, love her,

879
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:24,550
and be someone she can rely on.

880
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:26,370
I'll drink this.

881
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:31,460
Ma Chengshu.

882
00:37:31,630 --> 00:37:33,940
You have to confess to me like this in the future.

883
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,260
I will.

884
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:40,790
Mr. Lou said it so well.

885
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:43,000
Since we've come to this point,

886
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,250
for the time being,

887
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,260
we'll rest assured to leave En to you.

888
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:49,750
From now on,

889
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:51,930
we are Party A and Party B at work.

890
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,740
We're family in life.

891
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:55,380
One more thing.

892
00:37:55,650 --> 00:37:56,260
Tell me.

893
00:37:56,340 --> 00:37:58,760
Think about us more if there's work.

894
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:00,790
Aren't you ashamed?

895
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:01,850
Why did you say that here?

896
00:38:01,890 --> 00:38:03,150
It doesn't matter.

897
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,700
Mr. Lou, a toast to you.

898
00:38:04,770 --> 00:38:05,260
OK.

899
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:08,050
I'll drink. You drank too much.

900
00:38:08,250 --> 00:38:08,820
-En..
-It’s OK.

901
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:11,570
You're protecting him before getting married.

902
00:38:11,630 --> 00:38:12,600
It seems that

903
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,620
it'll be hard for us to make Mr. Lou drink in the future.

904
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,440
He's a big boss.

905
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:17,500
What's wrong with having one more drink?

906
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:18,280
Right, Lou...

907
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:19,120
Mr. Lou?

908
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,890
It's okay.

909
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:22,760
Let me drink it.

910
00:38:23,230 --> 00:38:24,100
How about this?

911
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,540
Let's drink together.

912
00:38:26,670 --> 00:38:27,630
Cheers.

913
00:38:27,990 --> 00:38:29,480
A toast to Mr. Lou.

914
00:38:37,150 --> 00:38:38,550
This wine is good, Mr. Lou.

915
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,860
Let's eat.

916
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:42,980
What do you want to eat?

917
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:45,500
You did a good job.

918
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:46,910
I thought you would be nervous.

919
00:38:46,940 --> 00:38:48,220
Did you practice a lot?

920
00:38:48,390 --> 00:38:49,620
I didn't.

921
00:38:49,970 --> 00:38:51,210
It's all true feelings and emotions.

922
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,420
Walking with you,

923
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:02,620
just like this now.

924
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,060
Walking with you...

925
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:05,380
I can sing for you.

926
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:07,980
I said you ordered too many dishes.

927
00:39:08,010 --> 00:39:08,770
What a waste.

928
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,930
It won't be.

929
00:39:10,270 --> 00:39:11,390
I can go back and reheat these dishes

930
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,300
for a late-night snack.

931
00:39:13,920 --> 00:39:15,130
I'm going upstairs.

932
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,670
I don't want you to leave.

933
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:19,950
Give me a hug.

934
00:39:26,580 --> 00:39:28,470
I won't sleep at your house tonight.

935
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:32,840
Nose bump.

936
00:39:42,910 --> 00:39:43,930
Rest early.

937
00:39:49,350 --> 00:39:50,030
En.

938
00:40:00,060 --> 00:40:00,990
You know them?

939
00:40:02,430 --> 00:40:03,190
My parents.

940
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:04,600
Your parents?

941
00:40:08,730 --> 00:40:10,160
Uncle, Auntie.
