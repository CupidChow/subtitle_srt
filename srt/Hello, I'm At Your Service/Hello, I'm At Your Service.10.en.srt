we finally developed five kinds of sauces.

I don't have time to find you a daughter-in-law.

559
00:24:35,650 --> 00:24:37,090
You have no time to get a wife because of me?

560
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,990
-Of course.
-You're just not capable.

Ms. Zhao.

569
00:24:50,350 --> 00:24:50,950
Defeat her.

570
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,190
I have to go.

00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:53,310
Silly boy.

00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:01,240
How's your daughter Dali?

576
00:25:01,310 --> 00:25:02,240
Any news about her?

577
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:07,540
Ke, aren't you too stingy?

578
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:09,750
You said you would buy us some meat. So this is the meat?

579
00:25:09,770 --> 00:25:11,300
It's full of starch. There's no meat at all.

580
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,220
There are still some sausages here.

581
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:14,180
Here you are.

Look. Look. What is this?

A chicken wing. It's meat.

585
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:22,420
It's called chicken wing tip.

00:27:48,620 --> 00:27:49,500
in the blink of an eye

663
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,460
and as quick as a flash,

664
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:51,340
she's a Glutton for Rice.

It's so long.

666
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,580
It's a long name indeed,

667
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:58,500
but it proves her traits that

668
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:00,130
she has a very big appetite,

669
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,810
she would resort to extreme measures just for eating,

670
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,960
and she can both endure hardships and eat a lot of rice.

As a girl, don't I need dignity?

672
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:09,750
Alright. Just eat.

Yes.

705
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:05,300
Mr. Wu's barbeque really deserves its reputation.

706
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:07,780
But it might be due to the fact that it was brought

707
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,700
by you.

708
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,140
So it's especially delicious.

00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,650

We've received them.

711
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,380
We even had an argument because of the ownership

712
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,260
of the sausages.

713
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,730
Well, what about the doll?

714
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,620
It's with me all the time.

715
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:37,020
May I?

716
00:31:21,070 --> 00:31:21,670
Done.

00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,520
Mr. Lou, you're amazing.

718
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:28,500
You can do this much better

719
00:31:28,520 --> 00:31:30,930
than that barber who charges 888 yuan

720
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,000
for his service.

721
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,970
He'll be no match for you if he stands in front of you.

722
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:37,440
I'll put it back for you.

723
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:47,890
There's one more thing.

724
00:31:48,860 --> 00:31:49,910
This is an invitation letter.

725
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:51,970
Remember to come to the annual party.

726
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:54,510
Sure.

727
00:31:55,410 --> 00:31:56,960
We have to dance at the annual party.

728
00:31:57,430 --> 00:31:58,540
Dance?

729
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,900
I can't dance.

730
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,510
If you can't dance, it doesn't matter.

731
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:02,510
I can teach you.

732
00:32:04,740 --> 00:32:06,710
Why do you teach me dancing?

733
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,090
I just want to invite you

734
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,420
to be my dance partner.

735
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:15,560
Don't you have any other female friends?

736
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:18,390
Does Ms. Cao have no time?

737
00:32:18,650 --> 00:32:20,040
I have other female friends.

738
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:21,630
Cao Ya may have time, too.

739
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:23,390
But I just want to invite you

740
00:32:23,430 --> 00:32:24,310
to be my dance partner.

741
00:32:25,890 --> 00:32:27,900
Is it appropriate for me to be your dance partner?

742
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:28,830
It's fine.

743
00:32:29,650 --> 00:32:31,290
Let's practice hard these two days.

744

Sir, I want this.

926
00:40:59,630 --> 00:41:01,860
The point is that I like everything with eggs.

927
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:02,420
Thank you.

928
00:41:02,550 --> 00:41:03,300
-No problem. -This one.

929
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,870
Well, Ma'am,

930
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:07,910
I want a portion of fried eggs with Chinese chives, too.

931
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:08,440
Okay.

932
00:41:08,810 --> 00:41:10,290
I'll send it to you when it's done.

933
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:12,890
Be careful in the company from now on.

934
00:41:12,890 --> 00:41:14,060
People are watching.

935
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,840
Don't be shy. It's not the first time.

936
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,560
Whose first time are you talking about?

937
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,470
I'm serious.

938
00:41:29,810 --> 00:41:30,660
I think

939
00:41:30,870 --> 00:41:32,380
we are a good match.

940
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:33,170
Yes.

941
00:41:34,070 --> 00:41:35,510
We're a good match in every aspect.

942
00:41:36,620 --> 00:41:37,770
Well,

943
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:39,920
how about we date?

944
00:41:44,130 --> 00:41:45,070
No. Wait.

945
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,480
What's wrong with you today?

946
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,270
How good it is to just be friends.

947
00:41:50,310 --> 00:41:52,110
Why are you talking about feelings with me now?

948
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:55,130
-I... -On New Year's Eve, many people asked me out.

949
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:56,180
But I refused them all.

950
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:57,890
I went to take a hot spring bath with you.

951
00:41:58,570 --> 00:41:59,740
I thought you were lonely, so I just

952
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,740
wanted to comfort you.

953
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,310
I...

954
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:04,570
Do you really have a crush on me?

955
00:42:05,250 --> 00:42:06,360
That would be boring.

956
00:42:07,810 --> 00:42:08,960
How is that possible?

957
00:42:08,990 --> 00:42:10,320
I was just kidding.

958
00:42:10,710 --> 00:42:12,030
You lose if you're serious.

959
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:13,100
Have a shrimp tail.

960
00:42:13,120 --> 00:42:13,760
It's delicious.

961
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:16,110
Remember to prepare the tuxedo for the annual party.

962
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:18,500
Did you hear me?

963
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:21,000
-Good boy.
-Fried eggs with Chinese chives.

964
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:22,260
Please enjoy it.

965
00:42:22,290 --> 00:42:23,230
Thank you, sir.

966
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:26,990
You should eat more.

967
00:42:27,020 --> 00:42:28,040
Okay.

968
00:42:38,510 --> 00:42:39,220
It's delicious.

969
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,850
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
