Calm down. What's wrong?

Mr. Su stir-fried eggs first

and then put rice in it.

124

Then

125
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,920
he used the most classic sauce of Sanjiao Group.

is different from the usual rice.

133

I think he separated the egg whites from the yolks first

134
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:03,980
and then mixed the rice with the yolks.

135
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,820
Now the rice

00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,210
Okay.

748
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,560
Let me sing another song.

749
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:37,680
Dong Dong'en.

00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,460
-Come down.
-What?

755
00:32:59,480 --> 00:33:00,690
Can you behave?

756
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:02,240
The men of Ba'er are still here.

757
00:33:02,370 --> 00:33:03,840
What era is this now?

758
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:06,230
Of course I should take the initiative to pursue my love.

759
00:33:06,490 --> 00:33:07,840

763
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,070
In ancient times, if a hero saved a beauty,

764
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:13,770
the beauty would give herself to the hero.

765
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,650
Good for the hero, huh?

766
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:17,260
This... This is not good for me.

767
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:18,590
Look at the way she looks at me.

768
00:33:18,610 --> 00:33:19,850
I'm like a piece of meat.

769
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,740
Let me show you a magic trick.

00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:22,760
-Pull with both hands.
-There is chocolate.

00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,040
Put the rubber band here.

772
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,710
It can't come out on the left or right.

773
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,530
Pull it like this.

774
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:28,580
Come on. Blow.

00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:33,650
-I can't believe this.
-Isn't it amazing?

776
00:33:34,230 --> 00:33:35,510
I think the buffet has this ice cream too.

777
00:33:35,540 --> 00:33:36,020
You...

778
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,140

Okay.

The buffet here includes braised noodles.

786

What do you want to eat?

787
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:53,940

00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,190
Okay, wait for me.

Hai, listen.

-My shoes. My shoes.
-Let me help you.

Mr. Wang needs to rest.

There are men with 8-pack abs at the pool.

-Coming.

Where?

00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:23,560
This is a public occasion.

804
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:25,230
Look at you.

805
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:27,130
Zheng Chao was so close to you.

806
00:34:27,469 --> 00:34:28,980
He is up to no good.

807
00:34:29,780 --> 00:34:30,480
Shallow.

808
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:33,510
I like shallow men. So what?

809
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:35,500
He's simple and innocent. I don't need to guess.

810
00:34:35,580 --> 00:34:36,639
He's not like someone.

811
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:37,580
I think he's good.

812
00:34:37,850 --> 00:34:39,630
Can you be more cautious?

813
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,719
He was so close to you, and you think he's innocent?

814
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,940
We broke up. Don't be worried about me.

815
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:45,270
Who is worried about you?

816
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:47,429
Can't I say something after being dumped?

817
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,920
Who dumped you?

818
00:34:49,989 --> 00:34:51,380
You dumped me.

819
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,860
You abused me emotionally.

820
00:34:52,860 --> 00:34:54,489
You abandoned me.

821
00:34:56,389 --> 00:34:56,860
I...

822
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:02,760
-I was acting.
-Go in.

823
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,060
You're good at acting.

824
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,660
You saw what happened.

825
00:35:08,730 --> 00:35:10,760
When did you book such a big room?

826
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,720
It's for the convenience of all of us.

827
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,830
There's even a private pool.

828
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,120
Nice.

829
00:35:18,030 --> 00:35:19,360
Where is Lou Yuan?

830
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,730
Why can't I reach him?

831
00:35:20,850 --> 00:35:22,390
Don't worry about him.

832
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:24,660
He is with En alone

833
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,670
enjoying romance.

834
00:35:27,140 --> 00:35:28,140
It's getting late.

835
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:29,140
Let's go back now.

836
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:31,270
I haven't finished the task yet.

837
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,440
You haven't taken a photo?

838
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:35,880
You have taken a photo?

839
00:35:37,020 --> 00:35:39,040
I took a photo

840
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,720
with the waiter brother. Look.

841
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:42,090
-Isn't it good?
-Brother.

842
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,160
Good.

843
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:46,850
There is a girl there.

844
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,160
I'm going to ask her to come here to take a photo with you.

845
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:49,490
Come back.

846
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:52,700
No need to ask her.

847
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:54,480
You take a photo with me.

848
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:54,980
Me?

849
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:55,740
No, no, no.

850
00:35:58,680 --> 00:35:59,390
No?

851
00:35:59,650 --> 00:36:00,660
Why not?

852
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:01,860
They didn't say

853
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,860
it has to be a stranger of the opposite sex.

854
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,640
I think it's okay.

855
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:07,570
Yes. If you say so.

856
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:08,890
Okay, I'll take a photo with you.

857
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:15,100
Hello, can you take a photo for us?

858
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:15,650
Sure.

859
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:16,380
Thank you.

860
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:24,220
Make a heart shape.

861
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,720
Okay, make a heart shape.

862
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:27,740
Three, two, one.

863
00:36:28,380 --> 00:36:29,610
Three, two, one.

864
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,580
Boss, tell me how we should do it.

865
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:33,960
Use this.

866
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:38,460
Okay, it's done.

867
00:36:38,550 --> 00:36:39,350
Okay, thank you.

868
00:36:39,380 --> 00:36:40,420
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

869
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:46,650
Not bad.

870
00:36:47,090 --> 00:36:47,690
What's wrong?

871
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:48,810
My crabs.

872
00:36:50,070 --> 00:36:50,800
Crabs?

873
00:36:51,980 --> 00:36:53,850
I think he's serious this time.

874
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:56,000
Serious this time?

875
00:36:57,550 --> 00:36:59,990
You weren't serious during the three days you were together?

876
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:01,460
We were serious too.

877
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:03,600
But not that kind of seriousness.

878
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,780
Why did you get changed?

879
00:37:09,780 --> 00:37:10,860
Lou Yuan is not here yet.

880
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,510
Cut the crap.

881
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:15,130
Today, let me tell you

882
00:37:15,150 --> 00:37:16,630
about my relationship with Lou Yuan back then.

883
00:37:17,530 --> 00:37:19,340
Lou Yuan was the one who was most likely to be my boyfriend

884
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,380
among my classmates back then.

885
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,680
When I asked him to give it a try,

886
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,860
he was embarrassed.

887
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,380
During the three days,

888
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,850
we had no feelings for each other.

889
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,510
You two are a good match in all aspects.

890
00:37:36,110 --> 00:37:38,840
You didn't have feelings for each other after being together for three days. It doesn't make sense.

891
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,220
Are you stupid?

892
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:42,650
There are not so many reasons in love.

893
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,360
You can only be together if you have feelings.

894
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:45,630
Break up if you don't.

895
00:37:46,490 --> 00:37:48,810
We just didn't like each other.

896
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:50,530
So we broke up.

897
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:52,680
What about now?

898
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:54,010
Who do you have feelings for now?

899
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,570
What about you?

900
00:37:58,900 --> 00:37:59,830
I...

901
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:01,830
I'm a playboy.

902
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:03,540
Girls can like me.

903
00:38:03,570 --> 00:38:05,810
I've never thought about what kind of girl I like.

904
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,260
What a coincidence.

905
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,300
Me too.

906
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,140
Isn't this fate?

907
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,240
Give me five for enjoying ourselves.

908
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,220
Give me five.

909
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,090
Come on.

910
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:03,340
Eat it while it's hot.

911
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,050
Please have a seat.

912
00:39:08,820 --> 00:39:09,780
Mr. Lou,

913
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:13,510
you are the best Party A in the world.

914
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:15,820
Please have a seat.

915
00:39:19,090 --> 00:39:20,090
Thank you.

916
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,220
Come on. Eat.

917
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,500
Okay.

918
00:39:36,580 --> 00:39:38,690
The first bite is for the best Party A.

919
00:39:57,510 --> 00:39:59,110
You've improved compared with last time.

920
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:15,350
Dong Dong'en, you can't fall for his beauty.

921
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:16,790
Stay sober.

922
00:40:25,010 --> 00:40:28,870
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
