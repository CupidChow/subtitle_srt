00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,820
Come and play during your break.

375
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,050
Got it.

376
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:33,710
This full-sugar one is really delicious.

377
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,800
You know me.

378
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,000
What is this soft thing?

379
00:16:40,370 --> 00:16:42,160
Auntie, this is a bubble.

380
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:45,780
This is interesting.

381
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:46,990
I thought

382
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,530
it was Eight Treasure Congee.

383
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:51,190
This is the youngsters' favorite now.

384
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:53,330
This is a family combo. There's everything in it.

385
00:16:53,330 --> 00:16:54,850
If you don't like it, I'll get you another one next time.

386
00:16:54,850 --> 00:16:55,410
No, no, no.

387
00:16:55,410 --> 00:16:56,510
I think it's good.

388
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:59,330
I like everything you young people like.

389
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:00,860
It's novel.

390
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:05,530
By the way,

391
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:07,800
have you got the advertisement case?

392
00:17:10,849 --> 00:17:11,890
Why are you sighing?

393
00:17:11,890 --> 00:17:14,369
Why can't you tell me?

394
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:15,670
What happened?

395
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,869
Speaking of the advertising case,

396
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:20,339
we haven't

397
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:23,130
made a proposal that satisfies Mr. Lou.

398
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:25,410
But Auntie, don't worry.

399
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:27,130
We can make it.

400
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:28,800
Of course, I'm not worried.

401
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:30,240
But why is he so calm?

402
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,370
Half a month has passed.

403
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,570
What is he thinking about?

404
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:33,090
-Auntie.
-He's really...

405
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,330
Don't disturb him.

406
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:35,170
It's okay. Auntie.

407
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:36,160
I'll ask Guifen.

408
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,170
Guifen.

409
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:40,450
Which one did you assign the advertising campaign in the end?

410
00:17:42,890 --> 00:17:44,370
I heard Lou Yuan has chosen Jia Xun.

411
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:45,460
Do you know that?

412
00:17:46,090 --> 00:17:47,110
Jia Xun?

413
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,240
Is it the one that bid the highest?

414
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,560
They're so expensive...

415
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:53,290
That brat. He's just a scoundrel.

416
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:10,480
Well...

417
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:11,490
Mom.

418
00:18:11,490 --> 00:18:12,610
What?

419
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:13,650
Don't call me Mom.

420
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,450
Do you still see me as your mother?

421
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,430
I think you thought you’d grown up.

422
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,770
-Auntie. Are you alright?
-Don’t be angry.

423
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:21,370
Don't be angry.

424
00:18:21,370 --> 00:18:22,050
I'm your son.

425
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:22,850
What else can I call you?

426
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:23,890
Why did you come closer? Stand still.

427
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:28,890
Stand still. Think carefully.

428
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:35,930
Mom.

429
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:36,770
Look.

430
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:38,410
The company is running well.

431
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:39,550
Nothing major happened.

432
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:42,090
Did you hear some rumors?

433
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:44,090
With me staying here,

434
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:45,790
the company is running well, right?

435
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,690
Can I stay here forever?

436
00:18:47,690 --> 00:18:48,210
Of course not.

437
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:49,170
Tell me.

438
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,890
Why did you choose that Xun...

439
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,290
Jia Xun.

440
00:18:51,290 --> 00:18:52,850
Jia Xun. The most expensive one.

441
00:18:53,130 --> 00:18:54,130
Do you think our money

442
00:18:54,130 --> 00:18:55,400
comes from the wind?

443
00:18:57,420 --> 00:19:00,070
Mom, I'm your son.

444
00:19:00,370 --> 00:19:02,090
I wouldn't dare even if I had the guts.

445
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:04,370
Don't be angry. Listen to me.

446
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:06,410
Jia Xun's proposal

447
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:08,470
is really modern and fashionable.

448
00:19:08,570 --> 00:19:09,330
It can help us

449
00:19:09,330 --> 00:19:11,850
attract young customers as soon as possible.

450
00:19:12,050 --> 00:19:12,960
At this stage,

451
00:19:12,990 --> 00:19:14,870
their proposal is indeed better.

452
00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:16,420
But don't worry.

453
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:18,280
I haven't decided to hire them.

454
00:19:19,690 --> 00:19:20,530
That's good.

455
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,610
Even if the advertisement is fancy,

456
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:24,300
it's useless.

457
00:19:24,450 --> 00:19:25,370
Be practical

458
00:19:25,370 --> 00:19:26,810
and ensure the quality of the products.

459
00:19:26,890 --> 00:19:27,890
Mom, you're right.

460
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:29,450
Quality is the most important.

461
00:19:30,330 --> 00:19:31,770
So we need to let more people

462
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,450
know our quality.

463
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:34,610
As the saying goes,

464
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,210
“Although the wine is fragrant, it's also afraid of not being smelled due to the deep alley.”

465
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,610
So advertising is very important now.

466
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,900
Take Sanjiao for an example.

467
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:42,370
They made a great performance

468
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:44,060
on the internet platform due to a special advertising concept.

469
00:19:44,180 --> 00:19:45,710
Their sales keep increasing.

470
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:47,240
They're pressuring us.

471
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,170
Mom.

472
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:53,930
You built our empire

473
00:19:54,050 --> 00:19:55,050
with one bottle and can of sauce after another.

474
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:56,290
How can we ignore it?

475
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,970
Can their shoddy sauce

476
00:19:58,970 --> 00:19:59,970
compete with what I've made?

477
00:19:59,970 --> 00:20:00,770
Of course not.

478
00:20:01,850 --> 00:20:03,650
So we have to get back

479
00:20:03,650 --> 00:20:04,450
the market we lost.

480
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:06,100
Wow.

481
00:20:06,130 --> 00:20:08,330
I'm impressed with his acting.

482
00:20:09,570 --> 00:20:10,210
How?

483
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:11,600
Let's do advertising too

484
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:13,020
and promote our products.

485
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,090
That's right.

486
00:20:17,970 --> 00:20:18,690
So,

487
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:21,380
I've invited a few companies for competitive presentations.

488
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,950
We'll use whoever has a better idea.

489
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,800
It depends on their real skills.

490
00:20:25,930 --> 00:20:28,290
It is fair, open, and just.

491
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:30,930
Maybe

492
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:32,920
in such a big competition,

493
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:34,780
we can save some cost.

494
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:38,290
Rather than allowing these parasites to infest the company,

495
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:39,390
we should

496
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:41,210
consider changing our business philosophy.

497
00:20:42,770 --> 00:20:43,930
That makes sense.

498
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:46,300
Good boy. That's a good idea.

499
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:48,290
But the reform

500
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:49,980
should be carried out step by step.

501
00:20:50,410 --> 00:20:52,450
We can't accomplish it all at once.

502
00:20:52,450 --> 00:20:52,930
Yes.

503
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,090
Don't hurt those old friends...

504
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,050
-That's right.
-And old partners.

505
00:20:58,290 --> 00:20:59,170
You're right, Mom.

506
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:03,450
You just stay in the hospital

507
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,450
and recuperate.

508
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:06,450
As for the rest,

509
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:08,170
leave them to me.

510
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:09,970
Here, have some bananas.

511
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,370
We will definitely keep

512
00:21:13,170 --> 00:21:14,330
those who cooperate with us sincerely.

513
00:21:14,970 --> 00:21:15,650
If anything happens in the company

514
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,210
that I don't understand in the future,

515
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:18,690
I'll consult you as soon as possible.

516
00:21:20,210 --> 00:21:22,210
It's okay. I'm just reminding you.

517
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,170
Of course.

518
00:21:23,810 --> 00:21:25,530
Work hard. Come on.

519
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:27,440
I have faith in you.

520
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:40,790
[Ward 4]

521
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,380
You came to visit my mom on the surface,

522
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:42,970
but in reality, you're here to tell on me, right?

523
00:21:43,090 --> 00:21:44,370
I'm not here to tell on you.

524
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,170
Auntie asked me to come.

525
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,750
I'm here to chat with her.

526
00:21:56,090 --> 00:21:56,970
I advise you

527
00:21:57,330 --> 00:21:59,310
to focus on the right path.

528
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,060
Stop playing tricks.

529
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:03,800
I've read your proposal.

530
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:06,170
It's filled with empty words.

531
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:08,800
The valuable content does not exceed one page of text.

532
00:22:09,490 --> 00:22:11,970
Isn't that to enhance the readability?

533
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:13,690
Miss Dong.

534
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:15,510
Do I want to read a novel?

535
00:22:15,570 --> 00:22:16,850
I want results.

536
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,130
Wasn't your research direction good?

537
00:22:20,050 --> 00:22:21,610
But it became more and more unreasonable.

538
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:23,210
Did I say the word should be that big?

539
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,840
Did I ever mention wanting a tacky color scheme of red and green?

540
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,490
How about we change it back to the first draft?

541
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:33,050
What do you think?

542
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,290
What I meant was to gain a deeper understanding of the college students.

543
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:40,560
What do college students like?

544
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:41,880
What's their daily app?

545
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:43,220
What's your promotion direction

546
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,090
and strength?

547
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,660
Understand?

548
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,200
Yes. I understand them all.

549
00:22:51,030 --> 00:22:51,910
Mr. Lou.

550
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:55,570
Haven't you decided on Jia Xun?

551
00:22:56,210 --> 00:22:56,850
Decided?

552
00:22:58,970 --> 00:23:01,130
Don't believe in groundless things.

553
00:23:02,150 --> 00:23:03,830
If your proposal stands out,

554
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,250
the contract will be yours.

555
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,060
Really?

556
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:12,410
But as I said,

557
00:23:13,220 --> 00:23:15,140
don't always try to play tricks.

558
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,550
If you have time,

559
00:23:16,690 --> 00:23:18,220
do your job well.

560
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:18,690

00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,690
why you treated her like that.

753
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:08,800
What do you mean?

754
00:33:08,860 --> 00:33:10,010
What did I do to her?

755
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:11,910
Wang Zijian, make it clear.

756
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,170
Do you think I'm like you, mixing business with personal life?

757
00:33:14,450 --> 00:33:16,180
What do you mean?

758
00:33:16,530 --> 00:33:19,050
Don't question my professional ethics.

759
00:33:19,050 --> 00:33:20,090
You... You...

760
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:22,370
You...

761
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:25,970
Boring.

762
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,840
You're making me...

763
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:36,110
What's wrong

764
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:37,810
with these two pieces of lotus roots?

765
00:33:37,930 --> 00:33:39,690
Why did they jump into

766
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:42,410
the tomb of love at such a young age?

767
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,340
Take them away.

768
00:33:54,250 --> 00:33:55,750
Hello, Zhu Li.

769
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,630
Inform HR.

770
00:33:58,150 --> 00:34:01,520
Mr. Wang mixes business with personal life and disrespects his superior.

771
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,340
Half of his performance bonus will be deducted.

772
00:34:03,580 --> 00:34:04,740
Half?

773
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:05,890
That's right.

774
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:06,900
If...

775
00:34:06,970 --> 00:34:07,730
If you deduct half of it,

776
00:34:07,730 --> 00:34:09,199
how should I live on next month?

777
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:10,889
That's your business. It has nothing to do with me.

778
00:34:15,170 --> 00:34:17,600
[General Manager’s Office]

779
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:18,770
The decision to choose your proposal is the result

780
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:20,850
of careful consideration by the company's top management.

781
00:34:21,170 --> 00:34:23,050
But considering that your professional level

782
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:25,090
is unstable,

783
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,500
the company also decided

784
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,110
that all the contents you prepare

785
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:30,290
should be handed to me for review personally.

786
00:34:30,650 --> 00:34:31,440
Is there any problem?

787
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,550
No.

788
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:33,570
It's our honor

789
00:34:33,570 --> 00:34:35,040
that you can guide us.

790
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,449
Nice attitude.

791
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,230
But don't worry.

792
00:34:38,370 --> 00:34:39,750
The feedback afterward

793
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:41,300
won't be just vague comments like

794
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,929
"The font isn't big enough” or “It doesn't feel right.”

795
00:34:44,330 --> 00:34:45,620
What are you talking about?

796
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:48,429
It's our job to modify it until you're satisfied.

797
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,330
To communicate effectively,

798
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,310
I reserved a desk for you in the company.

799
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:56,739
You'll need to be available at any time. Is that acceptable?

800
00:34:57,220 --> 00:34:58,420
No problem.

801
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,280
Zhu Li will take you there later.

802
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:00,830
Okay.

803
00:35:01,420 --> 00:35:02,260
Do you see this?

804
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:04,560
I can see

805
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:06,880
your every move.

806
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,570
I advise you

807
00:35:08,690 --> 00:35:10,430
don't always think about taking shortcuts.

808
00:35:10,450 --> 00:35:11,460
Work hard.

809
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:14,110
If there's no problem, let's follow the contract.

810
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:17,090
Don't worry, Mr. Lou. I'll work hard.

811
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:19,950
The ringtone.

812
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:20,580
I've changed it.

813
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:22,220
I've changed it long ago. Don't worry.

814
00:35:25,530 --> 00:35:26,090
Let's go.

815
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:30,360
Goodbye, Mr. Lou.

816
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:33,020
It's our honor to work with you.

817
00:35:43,170 --> 00:35:43,780
This way.

818
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:49,890
Miss Cao.

819
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,870
Miss Cao, let me introduce.

820
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:54,010
This is Dong Dong'en, our on-site customer service representative

821
00:35:54,010 --> 00:35:55,690
from our advertising partner.

822
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:56,490
Dong Dong'en.

823
00:35:56,490 --> 00:35:58,640
This is Cao Ya, Director of

824
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,170
our R&D Department.

825
00:35:59,170 --> 00:36:00,170
I've seen her.

826
00:36:00,370 --> 00:36:01,930
Miss Cao, you are beautiful

827
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:02,730
and good at business.

828
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:04,720
I will learn from you.

829
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,490
Just call me Cao Ya.

830
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,630
Welcome to Peony.

831
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,090
If there's any problem,

832
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,010
we can communicate at any time.

833
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:10,530
-Okay?
-Okay.

834
00:36:11,030 --> 00:36:13,410
Then, I won't hold you up.

835
00:36:13,450 --> 00:36:16,070
I hope I can have coffee with you when you have time.

836
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:17,790
Okay, go ahead.

837
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,210
Okay, Miss Cao.

838
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,330
En.

839
00:36:25,010 --> 00:36:26,090
Come here.

840
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,550
This will be your desk from now on.

841
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:32,440
I've told the administrative department.

842
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,120
Your employee card, meal card,

843
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,780
and other office necessities

844
00:36:36,010 --> 00:36:37,250
will be brought to you tomorrow.

845
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:37,850
Okay.

846
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,810
Dear colleagues,

847
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,850
let me introduce

848
00:36:40,850 --> 00:36:42,570
a new colleague to you.

849
00:36:42,570 --> 00:36:44,850
She's Dong Dong'en from Ba'er Creative.

850
00:36:44,850 --> 00:36:45,850
Let's welcome her.

851
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,610
Hello.

852
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:47,850
Hello, I'm Dong Dong'en.

853
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,300
Nice to meet you.

854
00:36:49,410 --> 00:36:51,230
Welcome.

855
00:36:52,370 --> 00:36:53,480
Change the data.

856
00:36:53,730 --> 00:36:54,170
Okay.

857
00:36:54,290 --> 00:36:54,730
Here.

858
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,330
Go.

859
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:55,890
Okay.

860
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:00,640
If you're so slow,

861
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,630
go home and sleep.

862
00:37:01,860 --> 00:37:04,580
I'm afraid Cao Ya will be lonely. You...

863
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:06,090
Zhu Li, look.

864
00:37:07,230 --> 00:37:09,600
Isn’t this design better than last time?

865
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,540
Isn't it nice?

866
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:13,370
It makes people feel warm and accompanied.

867
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,200
Go in if you want to see her.

868
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:16,910
Why are you sneaking around? Let's go.

869
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:18,950
Do you want to work overtime?

870
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:22,430
Let's keep the brotherly love in our hearts.

871
00:37:22,530 --> 00:37:23,130
I'll wait for you in the car.

872
00:37:23,150 --> 00:37:24,780
Look at this new concept package.

873
00:37:25,060 --> 00:37:27,890
It's trendy in the packaging industry.

874
00:37:28,770 --> 00:37:32,020
To achieve a yearly growth target of 12 percent

875
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:33,610
and help rapidly

876
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,150
penetrate the market for Peony products...

877
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:37,820
So this time, the most favored styles

878
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:39,780
include being fresh, quirky,

879
00:37:39,810 --> 00:37:41,510
and absurd.

880
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:43,000
Then we can quickly

881
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:44,700
attract consumers' attention.

882
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:00,970
Time to get off work?

883
00:38:01,310 --> 00:38:01,930
Time to get off work.

884
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,010
-Let’s go.
-Let’s go eat.

885
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,370
We're leaving.

886
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:07,890
Okay, I'll see you later.

887
00:38:07,890 --> 00:38:09,050
-Bye.
-Bye.

888
00:38:16,970 --> 00:38:18,640
Hi, Hai. What's up?

889
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,090
When will the spring

890
00:38:21,090 --> 00:38:23,730
in my life come?

891
00:38:23,730 --> 00:38:24,670
All right.

892
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,970
Are you thinking too much?

893
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,600
No.

894
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:30,670
Ding Fan has already displayed

895
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:33,180
the three major signs that a man is about to have an affair.

896
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:35,340
He muted his phone as soon as he got home.

897
00:38:35,370 --> 00:38:37,410
He never answered the phone in front of me.

898
00:38:37,470 --> 00:38:38,900
His expenses have increased.

899
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:40,470
He started to pay attention to his appearance.

900
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,540
There must be something wrong with him.

901
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,090
Well.

902
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:45,210
If you are unhappy with him,

903
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,330
then break up with him.

904
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,490
There are plenty of men in the world.

905
00:38:48,490 --> 00:38:50,730
Besides, you are so excellent.

906
00:38:50,930 --> 00:38:52,850
You have a beautiful face and a good figure.

907
00:38:52,850 --> 00:38:54,370
How can you not find a boyfriend?

908
00:38:55,650 --> 00:38:56,370
Right?

909
00:38:57,210 --> 00:38:58,130
So,

910
00:38:58,650 --> 00:38:59,780
focus on your work.

911
00:38:59,950 --> 00:39:00,990
En, you're right.

912
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:02,370
I've figured it out.

913
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:03,940
I think dating

914
00:39:04,370 --> 00:39:05,300
is less important than working.

915
00:39:05,370 --> 00:39:07,270
Working is the most important.

916
00:39:09,890 --> 00:39:11,010
Working is hard too.

917
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:13,170
Speaking of which, I feel like crying.

918
00:39:13,210 --> 00:39:15,390
Why do you want to cry too?

919
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,780
Because I met a client who holds grudges.

920
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:24,320
Will you and Cao Ya

921
00:39:24,340 --> 00:39:26,350
never get back together?

922
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
It's been so long.

923
00:39:28,510 --> 00:39:30,060
Why are you still so obsessed?

924
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,370
If you and Cao Ya

925
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:32,980
can't get back together,

926
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:35,610
why do you work together with her every day

927
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:37,210
inseparably?

928
00:39:37,850 --> 00:39:39,170
What do you mean?

929
00:39:39,170 --> 00:39:40,690
Watch your language.

930
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,090
You know Cao Ya's personality.

931
00:39:43,310 --> 00:39:45,340
She can distinguish love from career.

932
00:39:46,190 --> 00:39:46,990
Besides,

933
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,080
we were together for three days.

934
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:50,080
It was experimental.

935
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:51,330
Don't mention it again.

936
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:52,780
Experimental?

937
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:01,530
It's Dong Dong'en.

938
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,560
Let's go say hello.

939
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:06,540
I just graduated from university at that time.

940
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:08,610
And I was an intern in Sanjiao.

941
00:40:08,850 --> 00:40:09,730
My boss told me

942
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,200
to entertain a very important client that day.

943
00:40:13,410 --> 00:40:14,650
I was serious.

944
00:40:14,670 --> 00:40:17,960
I got drunk

945
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,230
and vomited on him.

946
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,630
This girl is really strange.

947
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,940
The company she works for, Ba'er Creative, is not famous

948
00:40:26,970 --> 00:40:28,850
in our industry.

949
00:40:29,010 --> 00:40:29,490
They

950
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,570
don't have much experience in serving big clients.

951
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,950
You would have eliminated them.

952
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,290
Why did you give them a chance this time?

953
00:40:40,090 --> 00:40:40,890
Do you want to hear a story?

954
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:42,050
Tell me.

955
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:44,130
She helped me once.

956
00:40:45,410 --> 00:40:46,610
Come on.

957
00:40:46,610 --> 00:40:47,410
Cheers.

958
00:40:47,410 --> 00:40:48,890
When I returned to China three years ago,

959
00:40:48,890 --> 00:40:50,650
I attended a gathering organized by Su Qi.

960
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:52,470
Mr. Lou, a toast to you.

961
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:56,020
Dong Dong'en was an intern in Sanjiao.

962
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:57,370
She was called to entertain me.

963
00:40:57,370 --> 00:40:58,090
What a good drinker.

964
00:40:59,130 --> 00:41:00,410
Dong, hurry.

965
00:41:00,440 --> 00:41:02,360
Fill the cup for Mr. Lou.

966
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,140
At first, we were talking and laughing.

967
00:41:05,170 --> 00:41:05,450
OK.

968
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,950
But after a few cups,

969
00:41:06,970 --> 00:41:09,090
I felt something was wrong with Su Qi's wine.

970
00:41:09,530 --> 00:41:10,210
Come on.

971
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,340
Let me fill it up for Mr. Su.

972
00:41:12,650 --> 00:41:13,890
You should accompany Mr. Lou.

973
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:15,340
I felt dizzy from drinking.

974
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:16,930
But he was fine.

975
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:17,560
Thank you.

976
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:19,450
Well, Su Qi,

977
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:21,570
why are you so petty now?

978
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,690
I just drank a cup for Dong.

979
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,080
Let me drink this for you.

980
00:41:25,590 --> 00:41:26,790
Mr. Lou, let me.

981
00:41:26,890 --> 00:41:27,970
You drank too much.

982
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:30,500
Dong Dong'en felt guilty

983
00:41:30,530 --> 00:41:31,410
seeing me being forced to drink.

984
00:41:31,410 --> 00:41:32,130
You're so immature.

985
00:41:32,590 --> 00:41:33,690
When she helped me drink,

986
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,210
she accidentally drank Su Qi's wine.

987
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,050
She found something wrong with the wine.

988
00:41:42,710 --> 00:41:44,140
Maybe she couldn't bear it.

989
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:46,380
So she secretly changed my wine into water.

990
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,350
But at that time,

991
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,080
Su Qi and the other guy were back.

992
00:41:57,350 --> 00:41:58,100
Keep drinking.

993
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,050
Where have you been?

994
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:02,110
Lou Yuan, another toast to you.

995
00:42:02,290 --> 00:42:02,930
Dong.

996
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:03,710
Drink with him.

997
00:42:04,490 --> 00:42:05,210
Come on.

998
00:42:06,920 --> 00:42:08,790
She had to drink my wine.

999
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:11,360
Then she got drunk.

1000
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:15,370
Come on.

1001
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:16,830
Help him.

1002
00:42:17,950 --> 00:42:19,450
Lou Yuan, let's go.

1003
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,640
Let me send you back to your room.

1004
00:42:20,850 --> 00:42:21,450
Do you still want to drink?

1005
00:42:21,450 --> 00:42:22,010
After that,

1006
00:42:22,010 --> 00:42:23,970
Su Qi wanted to frame me with indecent photos.

1007
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:24,610
What are you doing?

1008
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,410
She saw through him.

1009
00:42:25,870 --> 00:42:26,600
Let's go.

1010
00:42:26,620 --> 00:42:28,170
Although she was too drunk to stand,

1011
00:42:28,730 --> 00:42:31,230
she insisted on saving me.

1012
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:36,210
Mr. Lou! Open the door!

1013
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:37,740
Open the door!

1014
00:42:39,970 --> 00:42:41,410
Mr. Lou, go!

1015
00:42:41,430 --> 00:42:42,440
Hurry up.

1016
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:44,150
Mr. Lou.

1017
00:42:45,770 --> 00:42:48,970
Listen, they set this up for you.

1018
00:42:49,530 --> 00:42:50,210
They want...

1019
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:51,490
Want to set...

1020
00:42:57,890 --> 00:42:59,270
She helped me out.

1021
00:43:00,090 --> 00:43:01,330
But because of this,

1022
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:03,050
she lost her job.

1023
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:05,940
So,

1024
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,480
drinking is risky.

1025
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,240
You need to be careful when you drink.

1026
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:09,980
Yes.

1027
00:43:10,490 --> 00:43:11,370
Then cheers.

1028
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,520
-Cheers.
-Stop drinking. Let me help you.

1029
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:14,370
Let me drink.

1030
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:14,850
No.

1031
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:15,810
I'll drink it.

1032
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:16,290
No, no.

1033
00:43:16,290 --> 00:43:17,010
Go away.

1034
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,850
♫Wait, my heart, don't beat so fast♫
