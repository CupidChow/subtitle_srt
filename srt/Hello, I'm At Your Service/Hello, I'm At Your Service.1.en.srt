00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,340
No problem.

194
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,620
Zhuang.

195
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,620
Mudan suddenly fell ill this time.

196
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,060
She must have been tired because of managing the company for so many years.

197
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:07,680
Peony Corporation

198
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:08,740
will count on you from now on.

199
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:10,170
Don't worry.

200
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:11,620
We've been with Mudan

201
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,820
for so long.

202
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:14,500
We'll try our best to help you.

203
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,060
Okay.

204
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,060
Uncle Lai.

205
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:17,300
To be honest,

206
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,700
this time my mom suddenly asked me to come back

207
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,810
to take over the company.

208
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,830
How would I know how to do that?

209
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:23,500
Luckily, all of you are here,

210
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:24,400
which makes me relieved.

211
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,980
Zhuang.

212
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:27,340
It's really your fault.

213
00:09:27,790 --> 00:09:29,940
You didn't care your family business at home

214
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:32,300
and went to work abroad.

215
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:34,270
Your mother had to take care of everything.

216
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,150
How could she not be sick?

217
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,860
But I have good news for you.

218
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,240
Our company

219
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,500
has moved to a new place.

220
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:43,210
There are all advanced amenities.

221
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:44,980
Let me walk you around.

222
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:45,540
Okay.

223
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,340
Okay, let's go.

224
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:46,860
Let's go.

225
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:48,980
This place is so nice.

226
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:52,530
He's a fool.

227
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,080
Hello, Mr. Lou.

228
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:55,860
Hello, Mr. Lou.

229
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,140
I'm flattered.

230
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:57,830
Hello, Mr. Lou.

231
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:58,740
Mr. Lou.

232
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,040
Hello, Mr. Lou.

233
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:00,900
Hello, Mr. Lai.

234
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:01,540
Isn't it good?

235
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,700
Not too bad.

236
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,140
Look.

237
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
So grand.

238
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:09,250
There's a big staircase here.

239
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,660
Oh my god.

240
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,680
Who am I looking?

241
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,240
This must be Mrs. Lou's son.

242
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,480
He doesn't inherit any temperament from his mother.

243
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,090
He was obedient when talking to Mr. Lai.

244
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,260
I'm afraid

245
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,060
he'll all listen to Mr. Lai.

246
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,720
Right.

247
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,940
Think about it.

248
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,580
If Mrs. Lou's conditions get worse,

249
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,940
this company will be all Lai's.

250
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,990
Mr. Lai likes to use people who are close to him.

251
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,210
He likes to take advantage of others.

252
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,590
If you offend him, he'll find a way to revenge.

253
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,470
I greeted Mr. Lou first.

254
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,790
You're doomed.

255
00:10:37,870 --> 00:10:39,490
Ba'er Creative.

256
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:41,220
Extraordinary Works.

257
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,960
Ba'er Creative.

258
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,880
Extraordinary Works.

259
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:45,580
My lady.

260
00:10:45,580 --> 00:10:47,520
Why did you fail at the critical moment?

261
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,600
En.

262
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:50,830
Did you let go of the brake, right?

263
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,040
Yes.

264
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,250
One, two, three.

265
00:10:54,350 --> 00:10:55,160
Go.

266
00:10:55,710 --> 00:10:57,180
Faster.

267
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,960
The proposal meeting is about to start.

268
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:00,220
Well,

269
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:02,180
can't we

270
00:11:02,580 --> 00:11:03,860
call a tow truck?

271
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,190
Shi.

272
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:06,830
So you are not lazy.

273
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,410
You just don't seem to be busy.

274
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,420
It's just walking distance. Why do we need a tow truck?

275
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,770
[Ba'er Creative]

276
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,590
You bastard! Come on!

277
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:12,660
-Come on!
-Come on.

278
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,130
Ba'er Creative.

279
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,700
Extraordinary Works.

280
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,580
Ba'er Creative.

281
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:19,580
Ke is the stingiest.

282
00:11:22,090 --> 00:11:22,930
Well.

283
00:11:23,060 --> 00:11:24,080
Ladies and gentlemen,

284
00:11:24,870 --> 00:11:25,830
I'm Lou Yuan.

285
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,980
I'm not good at talking.

286
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,380
Everyone here has been working with my mom

287
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:31,080
all the way

288
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:32,300
from a small factory

289
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,020
to this big company with 2,000 employees.

290
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,260
I really appreciate it.

291
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:36,660
Today,

292
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,980
I'll make a toast

293
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:38,980
to all of you.

294
00:11:38,980 --> 00:11:39,820
Great!

295
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:40,860
Great!

296
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,740
Come on.

297
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:42,380
-Come on.
-Drink some.

298
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:42,940
Come on.

299
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,410
Zhuang.

300
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,950
Have a seat.

301
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:49,380
Great.

302
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,340
Zhuang, you know what?

303
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,660
We really spent our youth

304
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,620
on the company.

305
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:58,060
Yes.

306
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:00,100
We're old now.

307
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:00,820
From now on,

308
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,540
we'll count on you young people.

309
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,520
Don't say that.

310
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,140
I don't know

311
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,220
why.

312
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,310
My head aches a lot recently.

313
00:12:11,780 --> 00:12:12,540
You just

314
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,860
worked too hard.

315
00:12:14,060 --> 00:12:15,730
Take care of yourself.

316
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,700
Right.

317
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,510
Lai.

318
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,090
Please take care of yourself.

319
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,940
The entire Peony Corporation counts on you.

320
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,300
You must stay well.

321
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:23,540
Don't mention it.

322
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,860
It's nothing serious.

323
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:25,800
It's all because of

324
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,930
some of our partners recently.

325
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,590
They know your mom is sick

326
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:31,050
and you're not familiar with the business

327
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,160
after just coming back,

328
00:12:32,740 --> 00:12:33,500
so

329
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:34,980
the things they produce

330
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,860
are getting worse every time.

331
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:38,070
They don't have a proper attitude either.

332
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,100
In my opinion,

333
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:40,440
we can seek new partnerships.

334
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,020
Do they think we're pushovers?

335
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,700
Right?

336
00:12:44,870 --> 00:12:45,620
Come on, Lai.

337
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:46,990
Have some more.

338
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:48,180
Try this.

339
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,740
Zhuang.

340
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,340
Of course.

341
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,290
Whether we change them or not,

342
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,510
it's up to you.

343
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:55,410
I'm just assisting you.

344
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,540
Assiting your work,

345
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,020
right?

346
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:58,350
Uncle Lai, don’t say that.

347
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,900
You are the best

348
00:13:01,100 --> 00:13:02,100
at managing the company.

349
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,500
It's up to you

350
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,040
whether we change them or not.

351
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,780
Let's eat first.

352
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:07,860
Let's not talk about work.

353
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:08,900
-No work?
-Yeah, let’s eat.

354
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:09,540
No work.

355
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,800
Have some of this.

356
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,940
This is made by a special cook.

357
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,980
It tastes great.

358
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:16,220
Try it.

359
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:16,900
Let me try it.

360
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,380
What happened?

361
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,000
It's too spicy today.

362
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:35,940
Waiter.

363
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:38,140
Don't serve spicy food.

364
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,170
Okay.

365
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,200
Zhuang, I’m not blaming you.

366
00:13:41,540 --> 00:13:43,200
Can't you eat spicy food?

367
00:13:44,050 --> 00:13:44,940
Peony company

368
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,260
has been producing chilli sauce for 20 years.

369
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:48,750
We can't eat

370
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:49,960
without

371
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:52,260
chilli.

372
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,030
This is not good for you.

373
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:55,160
You have to practice eating spicy food.

374
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,980
Practice hard.

375
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:56,340
Okay.

376
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:56,900
Right?

377
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:09,260
Our owner has left.

378
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,460
Please come earlier next time.

379
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,100
Oh no.

380
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:20,060
We're doomed.

381
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,930
Keep your voice down.

382
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,450
The landlord just came.

383
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,020
I guess he hasn't gone far yet.

384
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,850
Okay.

385
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,630
When will you pay the rent?

386
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,080
I'll pay the rent after I get the final payment.

387
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:39,020
Chun, let me tell you.

388
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,230
This car is a waste of time.

389
00:14:40,230 --> 00:14:41,450
I'm late again.

390
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,370
I'm late again.

391
00:14:42,580 --> 00:14:43,020
What should I do?

392
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,940
What should I do? I didn't make it this time.

393
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,330
You're all here.

394
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,700
Yes.

395
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,120
Well...

396
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:54,880
You came all the way here.

397
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:55,430
Look.

398
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:56,980
Well…

399
00:14:57,790 --> 00:14:59,610
I've been waiting for you for days.

400
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,100
Three months.

401
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,620
You've been avoiding me for three months.

402
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,490
Listen.

403
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:05,500
If you don't pay today,

404
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,880
get out of here immediately.

405
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,240
Madam.

406
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,260
You dress up so well today.

407
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:25,280
Why are you angry?

408
00:15:25,380 --> 00:15:27,300
Look at this pearl.

409
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,390
You must be rich.

410
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:30,860
You won't be bothered by this little money, right?

411
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:31,610
But…

412
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,260
Can't we not give it to you?

413
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,820
I'll pay you

414
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,300
even if you sell me.

415
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,290
I'll be right there.

416
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,130
Wait for me.

417
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:47,770
Money.

418
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,300
Hurry up.

419
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,120
Look at the money.

420
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,040
It's still new.

421
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:07,750
How tempting it smells.

422
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:09,530
First.

423
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,990
Why is it so little?

424
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,350
Well…

425
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:15,220
Don't mind.

426
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,700
It's good

427
00:16:15,780 --> 00:16:17,030
as long as there's money.

428
00:16:18,790 --> 00:16:19,510
Don't worry.

429
00:16:19,540 --> 00:16:20,510
Let me tell you.

430
00:16:20,580 --> 00:16:22,680
We're working with Peony Corporation now.

431
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,460
You must know that.

432
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:27,260
It's the leader of the sauce industry.

433
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,940
Since we're work with such a big company,

434
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:31,660
how can we owe you money, right?

435
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,110
Right?

436
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:38,240
Speak of the devil.

437
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:43,350
Hello.

438
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,600
This is Ba'er Creative.

439
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,620
Hello.

440
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,150
-This is Peony Corporation. -See?

441
00:16:48,190 --> 00:16:49,610
Unfortunately,

442
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,820
we have decided to

443
00:16:50,820 --> 00:16:52,690
terminate our partnership with your company.

444
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,870
Please contact us immediately

445
00:16:54,910 --> 00:16:56,110
after you receive the termination agreement

446
00:16:56,130 --> 00:16:57,260
and go through the termination process.

447
00:16:57,320 --> 00:16:58,520
Thank you for your cooperation.

448
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,720
Terminate the contract?

449
00:16:59,950 --> 00:17:01,210
Why?

450
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,640
What about the final payment?

451
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:06,609
If you can't pay the rent for the rest of the two months

452
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:08,569
by next week,

453
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:09,980
get out of here immediately.

454
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,359
What do you mean?

455
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:17,940
You think you can terminate the contract

456
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,440
just because you're a big company?

457
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,060
Calm down.

458
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,099
Alright, calm down.

459
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:22,290
Then… let's dismiss.

460
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,300
I quit anyway.

461
00:17:23,970 --> 00:17:24,690
I'm gonna…

462
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,940
This season...

463
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,420
Calm down.

464
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,740
-Calm down.
-It’s hard to find a job.

465
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:28,700
Sit down.

466
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:30,900
I have to buy tickets for the concert

467
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:32,850
I have to pay the rent

468
00:17:33,150 --> 00:17:34,430
and buy food.

469
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,100
Forget it.

470
00:17:36,300 --> 00:17:37,020
I'm not eating.

471
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,840
I'm gonna go on a diet.

472
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,220
You are quite calm.

473
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,780
Wait.

474
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,020
There's still wiggle room

475
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:46,760
with Peony Corporation.

476
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,450
We haven't signed the termination agreement,

477
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,290
right?

478
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:50,610
We have to do something.

479
00:17:50,630 --> 00:17:52,430
We can't work for nothing.

480
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,780
En is right.

481
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,210
You're indeed the excellent employee

482
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,840
in Ba'er.

483
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,410
As usual,

484
00:18:02,890 --> 00:18:04,920
you'll always be our strongest support.

485
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,660
No.

486
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,760
We're your strongest support.

487
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,210
Go, En.

488
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:13,110
Again?

489
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:43,470
Calm down. Take your time.

490
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,780
Hurry up.

491
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,780
What's going on?

492
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,730
Do you know how to park the car?

493
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,230
Move aside if you can't.

494
00:19:06,310 --> 00:19:07,630
Excuse me.

495
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:14,150
Hello, sir.

496
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,980
Go out from that intersection.

497
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,860
There's a parking lot 300 meters away in the south.

498
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,950
I just came from there.

499
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,020
There are fewer cars there.

500
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:22,150
I believe it can help you.

501
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,620
So what if he drives a Benz?

502
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:24,780
Why should I move aside for him?

503
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,540
Yes, you're right.

504
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:28,420
He's just unskillful

505
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,420
and clumsy.

506
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,020
Besides,

507
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:31,380
among all the traditional virtues

508
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,500
of our Chinese culture,

509
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,920
a gentleman is willing to help others,

510
00:19:34,950 --> 00:19:35,960
do good deeds,

511
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,890
and put others' interest on the top of themselves'.

512
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:40,540
You must be a very cultivated person.

513
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,560
Don't let this small thing

514
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:43,230
disturb your plan.

515
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:44,890
Forget it.

516
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:46,150
I don't want to argue with you.

517
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:46,860
Fine.

518
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,260
Wish you a good day.

519
00:19:50,950 --> 00:19:51,740
Goodbye.

520
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,210
Turn back.

521
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,350
Bye.

522
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,260
Don't thank me.

523
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,400
Work harder on your driving skills.

524
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,450
As a human,

525
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:14,790
you can't be ungrateful.

526
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:17,100
I have to save you.

527
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,820
The wind is chilling, the water is cold.

528
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:43,060
Even if you kneels to your clients, they won't return.

529
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,100
When can stop

530
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,080
making a scene like this?

531
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:53,750
I want to be a decent service provider.

532
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:08,780
Zhu Li.

533
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:11,900
En.

534
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,280
En, long time no see.

535
00:21:15,310 --> 00:21:17,080
I've got an emergency here.

536
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:17,710
An emergency?

537
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:18,590
Yes.

538
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:20,980
I brought you some cookies.

539
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,030
Your favorite.

540
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,550
It's so nice of you.

541
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,450
You're welcome.

542
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:24,980
Be careful.

543
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:26,660
Mrs. Lou...

544
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,790
The chairman?

545
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:32,310
The chairman has not been feeling well recently.

546
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,060
Her son, Mr. Lou,

547
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:35,890
is in charge of everything in the company.

548
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,000
Mr. Lou.

549
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:39,620
Are you here for the termination of the contract?

550
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,500
Yes.

551
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:43,480
I'm afraid you have to talk to Mr. Lou about this,

552
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,190
but I don't think

553
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:46,830
he has time to see you today.

554
00:21:48,180 --> 00:21:49,140
He's busy?

555
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:49,960
Yes.

556
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:52,260
Okay.

557
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:53,900
I'll come again.

558
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,180
It's okay.

559
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,060
Sorry about that.

560
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,060
It's okay.

561
00:21:57,060 --> 00:21:57,900
It has nothing to do with you.

562
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,070
You came here for nothing.

563
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,100
Thank you.

564
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:00,980
Bye.

565
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:01,620
Okay, bye.

566
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,660
Okay, thank you.

567
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:05,750
What's wrong?

568
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:07,450
I felt the baby.

569
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,020
This baby...

570
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,020
I felt the baby.

571
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
So naughty.

572
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:10,940
You...

573
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:11,820
-You’re so disobedient.
-Come here.

574
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:12,820
Come and sit.

575
00:22:12,820 --> 00:22:13,740
Sit here. Slow down.

576
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:14,270
I...

577
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,000
I...

578
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:17,740
It hurts so much.

579
00:22:17,740 --> 00:22:18,980
Why does it hurt?

580
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,660
I want some water.

581
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,580
Water?

582
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,020
Okay.

583
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:23,420
Can I get you some hot water?

584
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,180
Don't worry. I'll keep an eye on him.

585
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,860
If someone is looking for Mr. Lou,

586
00:22:29,860 --> 00:22:30,450
I'll tell them

587
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:31,180
he's not here.

588
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,300
Okay.

589
00:22:32,550 --> 00:22:34,260
Okay, I'll be right there. Don't worry.

590
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,140
I'll be right back.

591
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,530
Here.

592
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:52,800
I made the coffee for you.

593
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,730
I'm from Ba'er Creative.

594
00:22:59,950 --> 00:23:01,660
I don't know why

595
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:03,100
-I suddenly got a message.
-What’s going on?

596
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:06,110
that the Peony Corporation will terminate their collaboration with us.

597
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,140
It's not easy

598
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,140
for a small company like us.

599
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,180
Please

600
00:23:11,910 --> 00:23:13,040
get up first.

601
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:14,480
-Get up.
-Okay.

602
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:26,700
Uncle Lai.

603
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,560
Isn’t she the girl in the parking lot?

604
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,140
Right.

605
00:23:29,140 --> 00:23:30,100
Why are you here?

606
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:34,060
I'm here to see Mr. Lou.

607
00:23:34,230 --> 00:23:35,800
Hello, I'm Lou.

608
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,180
Lou…

609
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,100
Hello, Mr. Lou.

610
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:43,950
Hello.

611
00:23:47,230 --> 00:23:48,350
Sorry, Mr. Lou.

612
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,260
She's in the Customer Service of Ba'er Creative.

613
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:51,500
She wanted some water,

614
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,820
so I went to get her some hot water.

615
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,140
It's okay. Go back to your work.

616
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:54,940
Okay.

617
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:55,980
Uncle Lai, she's from Ba'er.

618
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:57,820
Wait.

619
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,700
Let me see.

620
00:23:58,700 --> 00:23:59,660
Be careful.

621
00:24:01,770 --> 00:24:02,670
Little girl.

622
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,700
Why did you get pregnant so quickly?

623
00:24:05,630 --> 00:24:07,070
Uncle Lai, I didn’t notice it until you mentioned it.

624
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,110
Pregnant?

625
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,460
Are you kidding me?

626
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,020
I...

627
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:13,380
It's a physical issue.

628
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,410
My stomach gets bigger when I eat it.

629
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:17,520
Their company's food is good.

630
00:24:17,950 --> 00:24:19,060
Yes, not only the food is good,

631
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:20,850
but our service.

632
00:24:23,750 --> 00:24:25,170
Mr. Lou.

633
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:26,950
Well…

634
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,690
We worked well

635
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:30,550
with Mrs. Lou.

636
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:32,250
I wonder

637
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,210
what aspect of our work you are not satisfied with.

638
00:24:33,230 --> 00:24:34,440
Everything.

639
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:35,810
Look at you.

640
00:24:35,920 --> 00:24:37,750
How dare you try to get sympathy in this way?

641
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:39,370
There's no integrity in your company.

642
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:42,190
We won't cooperate with you anymore.

643
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:43,030
Go.

644
00:24:43,030 --> 00:24:43,900
Go.

645
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,350
Go.

646
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,170
Go.

647
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:56,220
How can I say I've gained weight?

648
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:59,070
Who can gain weight that quickly?

649
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,660
I'm really out of my mind.

650
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:03,340
Take it off.

651
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:07,790
You'll be punished

652
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:08,980
using immoral methods like this.

653
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:10,670
Put it away.

654
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:13,630
Hello, Mr. Lou.

655
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,060
What a coincidence.

656
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,100
Mr. Lou

657
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:35,770
You came to the toilet in person?

658
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:36,340
Yes.

659
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,820
Thank you for helping me

660
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:39,740
in the parking lot.

661
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:40,540
It's okay.

662
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,910
That's what I should do.

663
00:25:43,970 --> 00:25:46,140
If you really want to thank us,

664
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:46,780
Please

665
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,940
give us Ba'er another chance.

666
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,560
Our advertising proposal

667
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,220
strictly followed the rules

668
00:25:52,220 --> 00:25:53,660
given by your company.

669
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:55,560
We didn't slack off.

670
00:25:55,750 --> 00:25:57,420
I know what you said very well.

671
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,510
You all worked hard,

672
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:00,700
nut as you know,

673
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:02,300
it's very hard for Mr. Lai

674
00:26:02,620 --> 00:26:04,740
to change his decision.

675
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,500
But...

676
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,760
But you're Mr. Lou.

677
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:08,740
Yes.

678
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,360
If it were me,

capability

680
00:26:13,030 --> 00:26:15,010
would be my concern,

681
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,310
but you know,

682
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:18,600
Mr. Lai

683
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,500
seems to prefer cooperating with his friends.

684
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,660
It's normal to have business

685
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,210
with friends.

686
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,850
Maybe this is only a guess.

687
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,380
After all, I just came back to China.

688
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,570
I don't know much about

689
00:26:30,620 --> 00:26:31,870
the domestic market.

690
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,020
I don't have

691
00:26:33,020 --> 00:26:35,990
suitable advertisers either.

692
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:36,540
Forget it.

693
00:26:36,620 --> 00:26:37,750
I can't talk anymore.

694
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,860
Anyway, thank you for your hard work in the past.

695
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,390
Hope we can cross paths again.

696
00:26:43,430 --> 00:26:44,500
Mr. Lou.

697
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:48,660
You just mentioned

698
00:26:48,660 --> 00:26:50,810
companies of Mr. Lai's friends.

699
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:52,570
I know one

700
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,500
called Laijia Advertising.

701
00:26:54,500 --> 00:26:55,460
Do you know that?

702
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:58,040
Laijia Advertising?

703
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,030
Good for you.

704
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:03,020
You guys know a lot.

705
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:04,690
I see.

706
00:27:05,380 --> 00:27:06,430
Don't worry.

707
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,890
I'll help you

708
00:27:08,140 --> 00:27:09,410
get the evidence you want.

709
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:10,860
I'll get it for you.

710
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,220
Thank you.

711
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,910
This is what I should do.

712
00:27:22,730 --> 00:27:25,050
This Mr. Lou looks familiar.

713
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,830
Where have you been?

714
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:32,380
Come here.

715
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:33,380
Let's take a photo first.

716
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,020
Hurry up.

717
00:27:34,020 --> 00:27:35,110
Let's keep it as a souvenir.

718
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,940
One, two, three.

719
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:40,170
How do you feel about

720
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,500
winning the Oscar Best Actor Award today?

721
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:44,020
To be honest, it's really tiring.

722
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:46,700
After three months of investigation,

723
00:27:46,700 --> 00:27:48,020
we found that the original supplier

724
00:27:48,020 --> 00:27:50,170
has been replaced to Lai's close friend.

[Test Report]

728
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:53,880
so they used the interior raw materials,

729
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,780
which sacrificed the taste of our sauce

730
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:56,810
increased the cost.

731
00:27:56,930 --> 00:27:58,180
After the researchers found out,

732
00:27:58,180 --> 00:27:59,070
they had no other options

733
00:27:59,070 --> 00:28:00,180
but to resign.

734
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:03,460
Most of the employees who left

735
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,900
were poached by Sanjiao Group.

736
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,500
In order to maintain our profit,

737
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:07,420
we had to increase prices.

738
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,900
Compared to Sanjiao,

739
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,230
we have no advantages in pricing.

740
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,940
You can check out the goods in the supermarket now.

741
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:13,580
Sanjiao is obviously a dominant player.

742
00:28:13,990 --> 00:28:15,140
The taste is getting worse.

743
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,200
The cost is going up.

744
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,880
Besides, we lag peers in terms of sales channels.

745
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:19,870
Plus, there's not enough brand promotion,

746
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,440
so our popularity has decreased among customers.

747
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,020

749
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,070
For the past five years,

750
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:29,240
our market share has decreased from 22%

751
00:28:29,300 --> 00:28:31,150
to 19%.

752
00:28:31,300 --> 00:28:32,090
However, Sanjiao's market share

753
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:34,060
has steadied at 17%.

754
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,630
We only have two products

755
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:36,500
leading ahead of them,

756
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,850
but the rest

If we don't

759
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:43,300
resolve these problems,

760
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,710
our company will be doomed.

Mr. Lou.

763
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,260
I brought the mat you asked for.

00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:59,200
after all these years.

766
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,280
So cute.

767
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:02,580
This artificial leather

768
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:03,740
feels quite comfortable.

769
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:05,980
I got it.

770
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,450
Lai has five properties.

771
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:11,200
[Jin Shangcheng]

772
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,460
Let's split up.

773
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,250
One keeps an eye on each.

774
00:29:29,170 --> 00:29:32,410
There must be something wrong with Laijia Advertising.

775
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:37,400
I followed Mr. Wang of Laijia Advertising for the past three days.

776
00:29:37,940 --> 00:29:39,360
Guess what I found?

777
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,430
What did you find?

778
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,500
I found that

779
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:43,240
Mr. Wang of Laijia Advertising

780
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,650
went to a private club

781
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,230
a private club called Wild Lily.

782
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,520
Wild Lily?

783
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:52,270
Guess what I found

784
00:29:52,420 --> 00:29:53,820
in Wild Lily?

785
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:55,590
What did you find?

786
00:29:55,630 --> 00:29:56,670
I found

787
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,680
Mr. Lai.

788
00:29:59,070 --> 00:30:01,320
Mr. Lai and Mr. Wang

789
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,700
went in together

790
00:30:04,150 --> 00:30:06,350
and came out drunk in the middle of the night.

791
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,840
They were like

792
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,330
a conjoined twin.

793
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:11,240
A conjoined twin?

794
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,010
What does that mean?

795
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:15,890
What does that mean?

796
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:16,800
Look.

797
00:30:17,030 --> 00:30:18,420
Our Ba'er

798
00:30:18,660 --> 00:30:19,960
is loyal

799
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,560
to Peony.

800
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:21,980
Yes.

801
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:23,150
But why did Mr. Lai

802
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,350
want to terminate the contract with us

803
00:30:25,460 --> 00:30:26,830
and sign the contract

804
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,080
with Laijia Advertising?

805
00:30:29,910 --> 00:30:31,830
According to my investigation,

806
00:30:32,260 --> 00:30:35,140
the quotation from Laijia Advertising

807
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,070
is 20% more than

808
00:30:37,140 --> 00:30:39,740
those of other companies.

809
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,200
Okay. Please contact the bidding

810
00:30:37,930 --> 00:30:39,200
Yes. [and sign the contract in 30 days.]

811
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,320
[Notice of winning the bid]

812
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,800
There's something fishy going on.

813
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,650
Miss Dong.

814
00:30:45,750 --> 00:30:46,780
If you hadn't told me,

815
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:47,840
I wouldn't have known

816
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:49,480
Uncle Lai is such a person.

817
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,370
Right.

818
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:53,340
Actually, I know

819
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:54,760
our Ba'er

820
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,440
is a small company.

821
00:30:56,540 --> 00:30:57,360
However,

822
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:00,940
we spent every penny Peony Corporation paid us

823
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,680
on the project.

824
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,930
No one takes kickbacks.

825
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:07,780
No matter what tricks Mr. Lai plays

826
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:10,870
in Peony Corporation,

827
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:12,180
at the end of the day,

828
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:15,740
we signed the contract with Mrs. Lou,

829
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:18,060
so we’re always

830
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:19,980
on the Lou family's side.

831
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:21,140
We will always

832
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:23,260
be on your side.

833
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:28,550
Thank you so much, Miss Dong.

834
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,900
I didn't expect

835
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:32,540
there would be such a service provider like you in the world.

836
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,880
Thank you.

837
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,020
You're welcome.

838
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,700
How about this?

839
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:37,820
I'll take these materials.

840
00:31:37,820 --> 00:31:38,300
Okay.

841
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,230
We must

842
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,830
resolve the problems within the company.

843
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,510
Thank you very much.

844
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,470
If anything good happens,

845
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,850
I'll think of you.

00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,280

847
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:49,850
Great! Wait!

848
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:51,040
I forgot my bag.

849
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:52,610

850
00:31:55,540 --> 00:31:56,190

887

the new director of the R&D Department,

00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,640
They are the directors.

892
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,480
What about Liu and Feng?

893
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,850
There's a new personnel transfer order.

894
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:38,690
Mr. Liu and Mr. Feng

895
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,450

00:33:58,800 --> 00:34:00,300
show them the evidence of breach of contract.

903
00:34:01,220 --> 00:34:01,880
Okay.

904
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:03,700
But Mr. Lou,

905
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,660
not only some of them are old employees here,

906
00:34:05,780 --> 00:34:07,780
but also long-term partners of the company.

907
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,219
There's no need to continue our partnerships with them anymore.

908
00:34:09,699 --> 00:34:10,620
Also,

00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:11,860

So this kid is playing with me.

using young people.

937
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:08,110
After all, he's not familiar with the company's business

938
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:09,380
and lacks experience.

939
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,550
He still needs someone more senior to guide him.

940
00:35:11,780 --> 00:35:12,430
Look.

941
00:35:12,580 --> 00:35:13,620
Director Liu and Director Feng

942
00:35:13,790 --> 00:35:15,580
are seniors of our company.

After all…

945
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:19,700
I still call you Uncle Lai.

946

You've earned a lot

947
00:35:21,580 --> 00:35:23,700
in the company these years.

948
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:25,220
You're old now.

949
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,030
It's time to go back

950
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,460
and enjoy your break with your kids.

951
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,350
What do you mean?

952
00:35:30,420 --> 00:35:31,290
Let me tell you.

953
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,660
I've dedicated myself

00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:37,870
Look at you.

00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,500
You're still anxious.

959
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:40,400
Have a seat.

960
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:43,230
Come on.

961
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:44,420

965
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:52,870
You know,

966
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:54,170
you look good on camera.

967
00:35:59,350 --> 00:36:01,250
Just because of these photos?

968
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,500
You're still too young.

969
00:36:04,580 --> 00:36:06,310
I’m just familiar with the manager

970
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:08,420
of Laijia Advertising.

971
00:36:09,070 --> 00:36:10,860
You're so persistent.

972
00:36:11,660 --> 00:36:12,140
Here.

973
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:12,840
Look at this.

[Announcement of the Bidding] [Notice of the Bidding Result]

975
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,860
Laijia's offer to Peony

976
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,980
is far higher than those from other companies in the market.

977
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,950
You've been recommending Laijia lately.

978
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:24,660
I'm afraid it’s not just about being close to their manager.

Here.

981
00:36:28,050 --> 00:36:29,050
Look at this.

982
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:31,180
You've been working with my mother for more than 20 years.

983
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,500
You know very well

984
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:34,100
in order to ensure the taste of the sauce,

985
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:36,860
she emphasized the beef must be sourced from Inner Mongolia,

986
00:36:36,890 --> 00:36:39,140
but you used cheap beef from other places

987
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,220
as the good one.

988
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:41,860

990
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:45,420
from raw materials, transportation to refrigerator.

991
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:46,340
Uncle Lai.

992
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:48,370
If my mom knew what you did,

993
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,640
what would she think?

994
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:53,340
And look at this.

995
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:54,810
You told my mom

996
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:56,580
we need to use machines

997
00:36:56,600 --> 00:36:57,460
to replace the procedure of producing sauce manually

998
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,980
for cost saving.

999
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:01,660
Before this,

1000
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:04,280
you purchased most of the mechanic production lines,

1001
00:37:04,310 --> 00:37:05,420
but most of the machines

1002
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,390
were

1003
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,010
old used goods.

1004
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:10,020
They were all outdated in less than half a year.

1005
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:11,660
They are still idle in the factory.

1006
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:13,820
How can you explain this to my mom?

1007
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:20,710
What do you want?

1008
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:23,800
You know what I want.

1009
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:25,460
Uncle Lai.

1010
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:27,720
You’ve known my mom for more than 20 years.

1011
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:30,480
You've been working all the way up from a small workshop until now.

1012
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,260
In light of this relationship,

1013
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:34,140
I chose not to call the police.

1014
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:35,700
Resign.

1015
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:36,940
Leave.

1016
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:39,140
I'll pay you

00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,560

1019
00:37:43,610 --> 00:37:44,800
You know where the HR Department is

1020
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:46,260
better than me.

1021
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:47,600
See you.

1022
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:49,780

1023
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,540
Mr. Lou.

1024
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,140
I heard that

1025
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,060
Mr. Lou, Mr. Wang and Mr. Cao

1026
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:55,620
studied abroad

1027
00:37:55,820 --> 00:37:57,670
together.

1028
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:58,660
Mr. Lou

1029
00:37:58,740 --> 00:38:00,660
is a gentleman

1030
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,950
but can be tough sometimes.

1031
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,300
He would be the main character

1032
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:05,980
in a drama.

1033
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:06,460
That's right.

1034
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,460
That's right.

1035
00:38:07,820 --> 00:38:11,100
He's a typical playboy

1036
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:12,940
who attracts women.

1037
00:38:12,980 --> 00:38:14,170
We finally have a handsome guy

1038
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:16,710
in our workplace.

1039
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:19,830
I thought Mr. Lou was a pushover.

1040
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:22,220
I didn't expect that he's the devil who disguised himself.

1041
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:23,670
After this major change,

1042
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,780
I'll definitely be fired

1043
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,300
given my performance.

1045
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:28,430
Twelve.

1046
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,540
Twelve? Oh my God.

1047
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,650
I'm doomed.

1048
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:32,980
I took a week off last month

1049
00:38:32,980 --> 00:38:34,140
for a trip to Dali.

1050
00:38:34,470 --> 00:38:36,060
I'm dead. What about you?

1051
00:38:36,090 --> 00:38:37,140
The pantry room is not a place

1052
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,260
to gossip.

1053
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:40,860
Go back to your desk now.

1054
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,700
He installed a monitor here.

1055
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:43,820

He left his job

1060
00:38:51,820 --> 00:38:53,990
and has been in the bathroom for over two hours.

1061
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,820

[List of Termination of Suppliers]

1063
00:39:00,460 --> 00:39:01,180

1064
00:39:02,090 --> 00:39:02,830
No.

1065
00:39:02,850 --> 00:39:04,490
Shouldn't we renew the contract?

1066
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,190
It is indeed termination.

1067
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,420
I've checked this many times.

1068
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:10,500
But I helped your boss…

1069
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:11,260
I know.

1070
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:13,180
But I'm not sure about the details.

1071
00:39:13,310 --> 00:39:14,740
But I've really checked with him about this list...

1072
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,580
Is he in the office?

1073
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,310
He's in the office.

1074
00:39:17,310 --> 00:39:18,150
-Okay.
-This one.

to drive them away?

1078
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,060
Cruel?

1079
00:39:28,930 --> 00:39:30,460
They were crueler

1080
00:39:30,460 --> 00:39:31,500
when they were stealing money from the company.

1081
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:34,270
But the company is gossiping about you.

1082
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:35,660
I'm just afraid that you'll push people away.

1083
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,700

00:39:38,200 --> 00:39:38,960
We can't rush it.

1086
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,500
Mr. Lou.

1087
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:42,580
I tried so hard to help you find the evidence

1088
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,780
of Mr. Lai taking kickbacks.

1089
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,670
Are you still going to terminate the contract with us?

1090
00:39:46,470 --> 00:39:47,320
You two...

1091
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,740
Don't fight if you can talk.

00:39:48,740 --> 00:39:49,520
