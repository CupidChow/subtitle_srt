00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,970
He asked me to come back to accompany you.

187
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:03,510
Are you okay?

188
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:06,690
The netizens are driving me crazy.

189
00:08:06,730 --> 00:08:09,500
He misinterpreted the stories and talked nonsense.

190
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,730
Look.

191
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:13,590
Even my home address has been found and disclosed.

192
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,760
Stop reading it.

193
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,720
From now on, don't look at your mobile phone.

194
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:19,520
I don't understand.

195
00:08:19,630 --> 00:08:21,230
Just because of an article,

196
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,880
all the efforts I've made these years

197
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,700
are erased.

198
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:25,730
Why is everyone criticizing me so severely?

199
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,550
They just can't accept that

200
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:29,130
the winner of life is also an ordinary person

201
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,270
like them.

202
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,539
When they see you living so happily,

203
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:34,390
they will be picky about you.

204
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:36,530
In order to attract pageviews,

205
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,039
those unscrupulous small media organizations

206
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:39,020
would do anything,

207
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,530
including aggravating the dispute.

208
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,409
How evil their thoughts are.

209
00:08:44,169 --> 00:08:45,990
Just ignore them and don't read the comments.

210
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:47,680
I also want to stop reading them.

211
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:48,450
But...

212
00:08:49,170 --> 00:08:50,290
I can't help reading them.

213
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:54,020
Since our engagement, all kinds of news about my life has been exposed.

214
00:08:54,900 --> 00:08:57,800
Now I'm being scolded by all the people online.

215
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:01,580
Everyone says that as Lou Yuan and I are engaged,

216
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:03,460
I'm like a sparrow which has turned into a phoenix.

217
00:09:05,380 --> 00:09:07,160
All these comments have been reminding me that

218
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:09,870
the gap of social status between us is very big.

219
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,790
I always thought that

220
00:09:12,990 --> 00:09:14,510
as long as I worked hard enough,

221
00:09:14,540 --> 00:09:16,660
the gap between us would get smaller and smaller.

222
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,340
But now I realize that

223
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:19,920
no matter how hard I try,

224
00:09:19,950 --> 00:09:20,950
in the eyes of others,

225
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:24,050
I'm a canary raised by Lou Yuan,

226
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,120
the future Mrs. Lou.

227
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,130
I'm just a code name.

228
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:31,900
One of you is a CEO, and the other is a customer service clerk.

229
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:33,720
One is the client, and the other is the supplier.

230
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:36,520
In others' eyes, there is indeed a gap between you two.

231
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,960
But as you two love each other, the most important thing is that

232
00:09:37,990 --> 00:09:40,770
you both feel happy.

233
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,500
Don't care about

234
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:43,400
what others think.

235
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,570
Don't be angry.

236
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:50,060
Have a piece of candy. Cheer up.

237
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:06,130
Just as the security guard said,

238
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,430
they moved everything away yesterday.

239
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:09,340
These bastards ran away so fast.

240
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,260
After they attacked someone, they would move to another place.

241
00:10:12,280 --> 00:10:14,210
It seems these people often do this kind of thing.

242
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:17,440
So, this is not a groundless rumor,

243
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:18,730
and it was premeditated?

244
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:22,340
Let's go.

245
00:10:25,350 --> 00:10:26,590
She does these bad things habitually.

246
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,950
During our cooperation,

247
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,930
she always came to deliver documents in the middle of the night.

248
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,410
She always asked me to meet her on the riverside...

249
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,060
Bah!

250
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:32,540
or in a club.

251
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,980
What are you talking about?

252
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,430
Which of you actually pestered the other?

253
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:38,020
You're nothing! You're talking nonsense.

254
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,590
What did she say?

255
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,460
She said, "it's okay."

256
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:41,450
"A man who works hard to support his family

257
00:10:41,470 --> 00:10:43,070
is in greater need of relaxing."

258
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,020
My blood pressure...

259
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,160
How can you, an ugly man, slander her while you should be blamed?

260
00:10:49,730 --> 00:10:51,120
You're ugly, and you're nothing.

261
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,630
She even asked me to spend the night in a plantation.

262
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,810
She had an appointment with her client during non-working time.

263
00:10:57,830 --> 00:10:58,870
She even brought her client

264
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:00,340
to such a high-end recreation club

265
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:01,950
to trade service for money.

266
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:04,320
Is this a customer service clerk's work?

267
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:05,300
Of course.

268
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:07,340
Otherwise, how can they cultivate feelings with each other?

269
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,750
Not only these tings,

270
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
there are more details.

271
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,180
You stood En up.

272
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,660
This Golden Retriever has heatstroke, doesn't it?

273
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:15,340
Move it to the shade at once.

274
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,140
Don't touch me. I'm angry.

275
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,860
Right. She was alone in the shade,

276
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,280
and was eating ice cream.

277
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,730
-She's just so evil. -Ke!

278
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,030
You're awake, Ke.

279
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:25,180
Ke, you're awake!

280
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,370
I'm sorry.

281
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:29,660
Nurse! Nurse! He's awake!

282
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:30,860
Nurse!

283
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,230
You're back.

284
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,060
We're back.

285
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,180
Come and take a look.

286
00:11:40,180 --> 00:11:40,820

00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,540
Sit.

288
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,970
This is the latest video to disclose scandals.

289
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,750
Of course, we do business legitimately.

290
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,620
But it was very strange.

291
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,380
Why did a little girl

292
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:52,960
bring her client to our place?

293
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,430
We agreed that there would be competitive presentations.

294
00:11:55,940 --> 00:11:57,620
But it was surprising that a very small advertising workshop

295
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,820
won the bid.

296
00:11:59,930 --> 00:12:02,220
If you tell me there was nothing fishy about it,

297
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:03,410
I don't believe it.

298
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:05,260
Unfair competition.

299
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:07,420
She had an appointment

300
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,510
with her client during non-working time.

301
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:09,700
She even brought her client

302
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,260
to such a high-end recreation club

303
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:13,040
to trade service for money.

304
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,010
Is this a customer service clerk's work?

305
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:16,240
Of course.

306
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:18,300
An engagement ring

307
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,490
is worth 770,000 yuan.

308
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,190
-What nonsense is she talking about? -Right.

309
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,830
It's getting more and more ridiculous.

310
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:27,060
Come in.

00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,250

-She even covered her face. -Mr. Lou.

313
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:34,660
The receptionist received a letter of yours,

314
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,260
but I don't know who sent this letter.

Let me tell you. I even want to stay here for a few more days.

There's no such...

322
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:51,280
You two should talk.

323
00:12:55,190 --> 00:12:56,640
Don't go up to such high places again.

324
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:57,220
Got it?

325
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:58,620
Do you know you nearly scared us to death?

326

I won't do that again.

00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,320
Don't be angry. Sit down.

Look. I'm so energetic now.

329
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,180
I don't look like a patient.

330
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,870
I can prove that.

331
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:13,950
Just now, the doctor said that

332
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,640
he can be discharged from the hospital after observation.

333
00:13:15,670 --> 00:13:16,910
But the doctor also asked him to

334
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,810
take medicine on time and come back to the hospital for a check-up regularly.

335
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:20,160

00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:20,910
Yes.

We can't get in touch with Chunhua.

You can't get in touch with him?

00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,020
Chunhua wouldn't be like this for no reason.

370
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:51,270
He said he went to attract investment.

371
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,600
[Science]

372
00:14:51,690 --> 00:14:53,310
And he would go on a trip, too.

373
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,930
Attract investment?

374
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,700
What investment?

375
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:59,180
[Science]

376
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,810
He has attracted an investment of 1.5 million yuan.

377
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:01,140
1.5 million yuan?

378
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:02,910
Who invested in our company?

379
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:04,060
Han's Group.

380
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:07,580
Han... Han's Group?

381
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,480
That's the company of Chunhua's father.

382
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:11,230
Back then, Chunhua cut ties with his father.

383
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,780
That's why he started a business with me.

384
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:13,690
If he has gone back,

385
00:15:13,690 --> 00:15:15,340
he must have promised his father something.

386
00:15:15,370 --> 00:15:17,820
Shi, finish the discharge procedure at once.

387
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,910
Fatty, hurry up.

388
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,820
Calm down. Calm down. Calm down.

389
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,540
[Science]

390
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:22,240
En.

391
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:23,690
You shouldn't go.

392
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,480
We still need someone to look after the dining saloon.

393
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,300
Okay.

394
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:27,290
It's okay. I'll be with him.

395
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:28,980
Well... Just calm down.

396
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:30,700
Why do I suddenly feel dizzy?

397
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:35,920
En.

398
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:37,620
Coming.

399
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:43,170
What photo are you taking?

400
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:46,470
It's okay. I'm used to it. Have a seat.

401
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:47,460
No.

402
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,600
It'll be more dangerous if this continues.

403
00:15:50,290 --> 00:15:51,660
We can't control

404
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:52,380
the public opinions online.

405
00:15:52,380 --> 00:15:53,190
Listen to me first.

406
00:15:53,310 --> 00:15:54,810
I've found you a house.

407
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,310
We can move there in these two days.

408
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:57,630
After we move there,

409
00:15:57,650 --> 00:15:59,610
we can buy the daily necessities when we get there.

410
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,430
Let's stay away from the trouble during these several days first. Okay?

411
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:03,580
Move elsewhere?

412
00:16:03,670 --> 00:16:04,070
Yes.

413
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,630
Ke is awake now.

414
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,360
You don't have to worry about the Eighty-two Studio, either.

415
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:09,830
Everything is fine with the dining saloon, too.

416
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:10,460
Listen to me.

417
00:16:10,490 --> 00:16:11,690
It's safer there.

418
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:14,020
But I didn't do anything wrong.

419
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:15,520
Why should I hide?

420
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,620
Besides, this dining saloon has just been opened.

421
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:18,670
We need someone to look after this place.

422
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:20,140
I can't hide just because of these

423
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,290
groundless public opinions.

424
00:16:21,420 --> 00:16:22,460
What's wrong with hiding?

425
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,820
Now nothing is more important

426
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,220
than your safety.

427
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,270
Zijian and I will look after the dining saloon.

428
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,940
Don't worry about other things.

429
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:29,790
Listen to me.

430
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:31,210
Just move to that house first. Okay?

431
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:35,590
How long do I have to hide?

432
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,360
Ten days?

433
00:16:38,550 --> 00:16:39,540
Half a month?

434
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,930
Or a month?

435
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,020
As long as people are talking about this

436
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,220
and you think that it's not safe for me,

437
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,730
I'll have to keep hiding.

438
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,590
Since the day I was engaged with you,

439
00:16:48,610 --> 00:16:49,770
from what kind of gown I should wear,

440
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,640
what kind of ring I should choose,

441
00:16:50,660 --> 00:16:52,190
to our engagement time,

442
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:53,650
I've accepted

443
00:16:54,390 --> 00:16:56,130
everything passively.

444
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,920
Many things have happened recently,

445
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:02,560
but I just feel that

446
00:17:02,890 --> 00:17:04,980
there has been no time for me to think about them,

447
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,050
and everything has been settled just like that.

448
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,480
I know.

449
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,040
I know you're doing this for my own good.

450
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,819
But I don't want to be like this.

451
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,560
I don't want to hide.

452
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,530
If I really hide now,

453
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,099
then I'll really become the canary they talked about.

454
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:31,410
Let's calm down and think about it.

455
00:17:33,510 --> 00:17:34,850
What do you mean?

456
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:46,750
As parents,

457
00:17:46,770 --> 00:17:48,850
we just hope that our child

458
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,660
can be a capable person,

459
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:50,870
and be confident,

460
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,650
without being bullied by others outside.

461
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:54,370
Materially,

462
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,120
what is the most important thing

463
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,360
when a man and a woman are together?

464
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:59,470
The social ranks of their families should be equal, right?

465
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,450
The couple should be able to move forward side by side.

466
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:04,190
Neither of them should be superior to the other.

467
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:06,210
But the gap between you two

468
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,440
is just too big.

469
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:18,380
Hello, Mom?

470
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,680
En.

471
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:22,390
What's going on with the statements online?

472
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:25,200
It's okay. They made them up.

473
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,060
Daughter, don't mind those comments.

474
00:18:28,170 --> 00:18:30,530
Just live your own life well.

475
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,260
Dad, don't worry. I'm fine.

476
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,920
What's wrong with your voice, baby?

477
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:37,590
Did you cry?

478
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:40,900
No, I didn't.

479
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,780
I'm fine.

480
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:42,180
Now I'm with

481
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:44,730
Ke, Fatty and the others.

482
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,290
I'm really fine. Don't worry.

483
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,680
Take good care of yourself. And Lou, too.

484
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,900
You two should both take good care of yourselves.

485
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,590
Dad, I'm hanging up.

486
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:58,030
I have work to do.

487
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:42,870
[Executive Office]

488
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,510
Sorry, Mr. Lou.

489
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,900
The dinner is scheduled at 7 p.m.

490
00:19:39,920 --> 00:19:41,600
Mr. Wu insists on meeting you before he leaves.

491
00:19:42,270 --> 00:19:42,780
It's okay.

492
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:44,230
Have we started implementing Mr. Wu's contract?

493
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:46,430
There are still some details to be dealt with.

494
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:48,250
-Mom. -Son.

495
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,180
Son.

496
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,090
All you know is working.

497
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:55,820
You'll get married soon.

498
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:57,240
You don't even know that you should arrange it.

499
00:19:58,150 --> 00:19:59,970
I've arranged everything for you. Look.

500
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,280
I bought something for En again.

501
00:20:01,610 --> 00:20:03,350
It's engraved with these words of "having many children and blessings".

502
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,130
It shows good wishes.

503
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:07,660
Mom, we appreciate your kindness.

504
00:20:07,830 --> 00:20:08,920
I thank you on behalf of En.

505
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,180
But we can

506
00:20:10,220 --> 00:20:11,750
deal with it by ourselves.

507
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:13,530
Keep this for her.

508
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:18,000
Auntie, Lou Yuan has a dinner tonight.

509
00:20:18,030 --> 00:20:18,910
We'll leave now.

510
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,780
Okay. Alright.

511
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:21,330
Keep an eye on him and ask him to drink less.

512
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:21,820
Okay.

513
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,060
Look at this kid.

514
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,130
Tell me.

515
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,570
For such a good thing,

516
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,490
how could he not need it?

517
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,590
Just keep it for him. He will like it.

518
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:33,910
Gentlemen, please.

519
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,290
Please sit for a while first.

520
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:41,470
I'll go ask Mr. Han to come.

521
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:42,870
Thank you.

522
00:20:43,370 --> 00:20:43,970
Fatty, sit down.

523
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,020
Shi.

524
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:45,680
Sit.

525
00:20:50,370 --> 00:20:51,260
Is this Chunhua's

526
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,580
rich father?

527
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:55,000
The head of the Han's Group.

528
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:57,370
Put it there at once.

529
00:20:59,830 --> 00:21:00,440
Ke.

530
00:21:00,870 --> 00:21:01,440
Look.

531
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:03,530
The vase is kept inside the glass case.

532
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,500
It's authentic.

533
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:07,620
You don't know, do you?

534
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,950
This company is Chunhua's family business.

535
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:12,100
This foundation has been laid through several generations' efforts.

536
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:13,750
This company is also very famous in the textile industry.

537
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,640
He is the eldest son and grandson of his family.

538
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:17,170
His father especially wants him to come back

539
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:18,610
and take over the family business.

540
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:22,760
Chunhua does not only have a rich father,

541
00:21:22,790 --> 00:21:24,410
but her family has also been rich for several generations.

542
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:27,040
It turns out that Chunhua is the one who has concealed his amazing background.

543
00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:36,030
You're awake.

544
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,210
Who is this?

545
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,400
Look. I hurt my head a few days ago.

546
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,430
I have amnesia now.

547
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:53,060
Let me recall it.

548
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,560
Mr. Han.

549
00:21:57,730 --> 00:21:59,930
Thanks to you, I'm still alive.

550
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,270
Mr. Han is living a happy life now.

551
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,640
He feeds the fish,

552
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,100
drinks tea,

553
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:07,410
and looks after the flowers every day.

554
00:22:07,850 --> 00:22:09,380
That's how he spends time in a day.

555
00:22:09,420 --> 00:22:11,760
Come on. Serve tea to Mr. Han.

556
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,540
If you don't mind,

557
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:16,580
how about we move the Eighty-two Studio here, too?

558
00:22:16,810 --> 00:22:17,700
I think it's okay.

559
00:22:18,330 --> 00:22:19,080
What do you think?

560
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,220
You think I don't know what's going on?

561
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,960
Why did you run away from home a few years ago?

562
00:22:29,330 --> 00:22:31,550
Didn't you come back today for the Eighty-two Studio?

563
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,540
Yes.

564
00:22:32,660 --> 00:22:34,130
Don't think that you can ask us to leave

565
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:34,820
with just a few words.

566
00:22:34,970 --> 00:22:35,750
That's impossible.

567
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,440
All the family of the Eighty-two Studio should be together.

568
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:40,880
Who

569
00:22:41,850 --> 00:22:43,540
is a family?

570
00:22:52,030 --> 00:22:54,330
After hearing Mr. Lou's idea about the dining saloon,

571
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,930
I've learned a lot.

572
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:57,680
I didn't expect you to have such a

573
00:22:57,710 --> 00:22:59,460
long-term vision at such a young age.

574
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:00,580
I admire you.

575
00:23:01,090 --> 00:23:01,990
I'm flattered.

576
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,820
It's our honour

577
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:05,380
to cooperate with you.

578
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:07,000
Let's not say those words to show courtesy.

579
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,100
All our sincerity is shown in the wine.

580
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:08,900
-Cheers. -Okay.

581
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:09,720
-I look forward to cooperating with you. -Cheers.

582
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:11,720
I look forward to cooperating with you.

583
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:19,390
Mr. Lou can drink a lot.

584
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:31,750
Thank you for coming all the way here to see Han Chun.

585
00:23:31,990 --> 00:23:33,570
Come on. Let's have some tea first.

586
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,740
This is the top-quality Longjing tea.

587
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:42,940
It's good tea, Mr. Han.

588
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,510
As the saying goes,

589
00:23:44,550 --> 00:23:47,470
good tea should be brewed with good water, and the tea will be fragrant.

590
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,340
If we want the Longjing tea to be fragrant,

591
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:53,830
we need to brew it with the water of Tiger-running Spring.

592
00:23:53,950 --> 00:23:56,030
It's like the friendship in our Eighty-two Studio.

593
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,120
Each of us is indispensable.

594
00:23:57,270 --> 00:24:00,490
So we still hope that Han Chun can come back.

595
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,530
Go back?

596
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,700
Your company is on the verge of bankruptcy.

597
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:07,870
So you just brought these several young man

598
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:08,830
to my company?

599
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:10,840
What do you mean by doing this?

600
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:21,120
This is an investment contract.

601
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:24,940
The investment money should be in your account now.

602
00:24:26,430 --> 00:24:29,810
Han Chun won't mess around with you anymore.

603
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:31,950
After this meal,

604
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:33,570
just leave at once.

605
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:37,310
Mr. Han, thank you very much

606
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,040
for helping us

607
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:41,050
at our most difficult moment.

608
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:42,180
But we really hope that

609
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,620
Han Chun can come back.

610
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,140
Besides, when we came here this time,

611
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,530
our main purpose was to hear Han Chun's opinion.

612
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:55,240
A man...

613
00:24:56,390 --> 00:24:57,890
A real man

614
00:24:58,330 --> 00:25:00,450
should know what is the most important thing.

615
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,050
Start a family and have his own career.

616
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,810
Starting a family comes first.

617
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:11,430
If a man can't bear the responsibility for a family,

618
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:14,100
how can he bear the responsibility for a company?

619
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,700
I have no other expectations for Han Chun.

620
00:25:18,550 --> 00:25:19,750
Since he's back,

621
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:23,050
he should help me manage the company.

622
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:24,950
Then

623
00:25:25,780 --> 00:25:27,820
he should marry someone from a family with the same social status as ours.

624
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,140
If he goes on messing around like this,

625
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:33,610
which of you will be responsible for his life?

626
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,640
I've made up my mind.

627
00:25:43,230 --> 00:25:46,130
Let's treat this meal as a farewell dinner.

628
00:25:47,390 --> 00:25:50,100
Chunhua, the Eighty-two Studio can't exist without you.

629
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,280
Right. You can't leave.

630
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,680
I've ordered the dishes and paid the bill.

631
00:26:00,130 --> 00:26:02,270
We have some personal matters to attend to in our family.

632
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:03,600
I won't accompany you.

633
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:05,670
When Chun gets married,

634
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,820
you're all welcomed to attend his wedding.

635
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,200
Let's go.

636
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:18,590
Chunhua.

637
00:26:23,830 --> 00:26:25,660
Ke, we can't sign that contract.

638
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,030
Let's return the money to him.

639
00:26:28,170 --> 00:26:31,060
We have to use the money to compensate Dongshi. How can we return it?

640
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,840
[Investment Agreement]

641
00:26:31,780 --> 00:26:33,260
I know Chunhua well.

642
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,260
He sacrificed so much

643
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:37,110
to get the financing fund.

644
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,640
If we return it,

645
00:26:39,110 --> 00:26:42,060
he will break our necks, won't he?

646
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:44,660
We have to take the money, and he has to come back, too.

647
00:26:45,870 --> 00:26:48,420
Ke, after you recovered, I think

648
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:49,540
you've become manlier.

649
00:26:51,690 --> 00:26:53,840
Otherwise, I couldn't be your boss.

650
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:58,550
In fact, let's think about it from another perspective.

651
00:26:59,000 --> 00:27:01,820
Our company has no achievement which we can feel so proud of.

652
00:27:02,410 --> 00:27:03,630
Ma Shishi, I think you...

653
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,310
How can you talk without considering the situation?

654
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,580
I was so excited to this extent just now,

655
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:08,520
but you pressed it down.

656
00:27:09,430 --> 00:27:11,210
No wonder Hai broke up with you.

657
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:14,650
Why did you mention Hai?

658
00:27:15,030 --> 00:27:16,660
So what if I mentioned Hai?

659
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:17,620
Well, you know that now we're...

660
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,060
Alright. Stop arguing.

661
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,150
There is so much food here and it can't silence you?

662
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,140
I'll plead with Mr. Han.

663
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,090
All the members of the Eighty-two Studio are indispensable.

664
00:27:27,110 --> 00:27:27,790
Be careful.

665
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,240
Where is this?

666
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,580
This is your home.

667
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,140
This is not my home.

668
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:34,500
I want to go home.

669
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:35,620
This is your home.

670
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:37,180
The bedroom is over there. Hurry up.

671
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,230
Who are you?

672
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:42,220
I...

673
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,350
Who are you?

674
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:44,670
I'm Dong Dong'en.

675
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:46,940
You're not En.

676
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,820
You're not En.

677
00:27:50,620 --> 00:27:51,780
You're not En.

678
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:55,540
You're not En.

679
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:57,620
You're not En.

680
00:27:59,120 --> 00:27:59,820
En.

681
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:22,570
En.

682
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,890
Why are you here?

683
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:28,900
Fatty told me that Chunhua didn't come back.

684
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,840
I knew you would be here.

685
00:28:31,980 --> 00:28:34,260
Girls are all considerate.

686
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,940
En, you know me well.

687
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:39,660
What should we do now?

688
00:28:42,430 --> 00:28:44,100
I don't know what to do, either.

689
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:47,310
Chunhua's father has a tough attitude this time.

690
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:48,790
It's not easy to deal with it.

691
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,500
How about we talk to him again?

692
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:52,920
It's useless.

693
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:55,120
If you want Chunhua to come back,

694
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:57,120
it won't work if we just try to persuade him.

695
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,070
Don't think too much.

696
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:03,600
I'll figure out a way.

697
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,100
Don't you belive in your boss?

698
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:14,880
En.

699
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:18,910
You've been in a lot of trouble lately.

700
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,810
I know

701
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,570
life isn't easy for you recently.

702
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:26,090
If you feel wronged,

703
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,210
just cry,

704
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,810
and vent your feelings.

705
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:30,730
Don't bottle them up.

706
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:32,360
Otherwise, you'll feel overwhelmed easily.

707
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,190
Many things

708
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,930
may seem difficult,

709
00:29:36,950 --> 00:29:39,530
but after you experience them and go through them,

710
00:29:39,730 --> 00:29:40,860
it'll be fine.

711
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:45,040
Will it get better?

712
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,130
You don't know this, do you?

713
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,820
When I first knew that

714
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,780
you and Lou Yuan were in a relationship,

715
00:29:54,140 --> 00:29:56,580
I felt very proud of you.

716
00:29:57,260 --> 00:29:58,860
What's there to be proud of?

717
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:00,340
Of course I feel proud.

718
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,600
Think about it.

719
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,510
A girl from an ordinary family

720
00:30:04,730 --> 00:30:06,850
became a CEO's girlfriend.

721
00:30:07,060 --> 00:30:09,230
She had to muster up a lot of courage

722
00:30:09,580 --> 00:30:11,140
and endure much

723
00:30:11,570 --> 00:30:14,060
reproach and criticism.

724
00:30:15,510 --> 00:30:16,750
If one day,

725
00:30:17,110 --> 00:30:19,780
a rich young lady takes fancy to me,

726
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:21,660
and they talk about me like that online,

727
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,810
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

728
00:30:24,470 --> 00:30:25,450
So,

729
00:30:25,710 --> 00:30:27,510
En is the bravest.

730
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,880
I believe that

731
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:32,460
those malicious slanderous words and jealousy online

732
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:35,410
will be destroyed by the true love

733
00:30:35,590 --> 00:30:36,740
between you and Mr. Lou.

734
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:40,680
Ke,

735
00:30:41,420 --> 00:30:45,210
do you think I deserve him?

736
00:30:46,910 --> 00:30:48,320
In my mind,

737
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,510
En is a perfect match for him.

738
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:52,230
You're just too fond of me.

739
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,360
In the hearts of those who love you,

740
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,410
you are always the best.

741
00:31:19,770 --> 00:31:20,600
You're awake.

742
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,080
Do you still feel dizzy?

743
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:28,180
Why are you here?

744
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:30,450
This is my home.

745
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:33,930
Yesterday, you...

746
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,060
Don't worry.

747
00:31:39,520 --> 00:31:41,600
I won't tell En about us.

748
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:43,770
This is a secret between us.

749
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:46,380
A secret?

750
00:31:47,060 --> 00:31:47,870
What secret?

751
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,830
Is it the secret that your scheme failed?

752
00:31:54,310 --> 00:31:55,120
I knew it.

753
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,310
I can't fool you with my tricks.

754
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:02,310
Let's have a good talk today.

755
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:06,740
I really don't understand

756
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,300
why you rejected me.

757
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,490
Are you kidding me?

758
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,340
No, I'm not.

759
00:32:24,910 --> 00:32:26,030
You're a man.

760
00:32:26,930 --> 00:32:28,420
You have to figure out

761
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,560
what is the best for you.

762
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,190
I won't measure my feelings

763
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:42,200
with interests.

764
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:45,740
Nor will I exchange my feelings for benefit.

765
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,500
You know what, Lou Yuan?

766
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,300
In fact, I really like you.

767
00:32:54,220 --> 00:32:55,970
Because you're different from other men.

768
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:57,890
You have the trait of

769
00:32:58,310 --> 00:32:59,800
a romantic fairy tale.

770
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:02,380
Really?

771
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:04,420
I have to thank you.

772
00:33:05,550 --> 00:33:07,560
But my romance doesn't belong to you.

773
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:09,840
Besides,

774
00:33:10,750 --> 00:33:12,780
remember to hand in your resignation letter to the company.

775
00:33:13,110 --> 00:33:15,200
I won't make an exception for you

776
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:16,630
just because we are old acquaintances.

777
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:20,700
You want to fire me?

778
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,660
Why?

779
00:33:23,290 --> 00:33:25,790
I've worked very hard in the Peony Corporation.

780
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
Then I have to make it clear.

781
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,540
You were the one who caused

782
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:32,580
those criticizing comments to En, right?

783
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:33,990
The inner parts of our engagement rings

784
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,530
are engraved with our names.

785
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,340
Apart from En and I as well as our family,

786
00:33:38,430 --> 00:33:39,450
only you know that.

787
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:49,960
You don't have any evidence.

788
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:50,780
Really?

789
00:33:50,950 --> 00:33:52,270
You can give it a try.

790
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,210
Mr. Han, this way.

791
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:27,139
You're capable of running a dining saloon

792
00:34:27,139 --> 00:34:28,889
at such a prosperous area as the Huaihai Road.

793
00:34:29,080 --> 00:34:31,239
Mr. Lou, you're really successful at such a young age.

794
00:34:31,300 --> 00:34:32,620
Mr. Han, I'm flattered.

795
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:35,449
Without the support of the Peony Corporation,

796
00:34:35,530 --> 00:34:37,239
I wouldn't be able to acquire that location

797
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,530
even if I tried my best to persuade them.

798
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,330
If Chun can be half as good as you, it'll be great.

799
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:43,030
He doesn't do proper business,

800
00:34:43,780 --> 00:34:46,100
and is always messing around with a small company called

801
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,070
Eighty-two Studio.

802
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,230
Mr. Han, this way please.

803
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:54,489
Mr. Lou.

804
00:34:55,659 --> 00:34:58,970
The reason why you asked me to come here today isn't talking about cooperation, right?

805
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,810
To be honest,

806
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,200
today, I've asked you to come here

807
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,630
because of the Eighty-two Studio.

808
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:07,230
Is this small and insignificant company

809
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,350
worth your speaking up for them personally?

810
00:35:11,470 --> 00:35:13,480
Actually, I used to think the same way as you.

811
00:35:13,510 --> 00:35:14,700
I thought the Eighty-two Studio

812
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,720
was a small and insignificant company.

813
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:18,500
But after our cooperation in this period,

814
00:35:18,530 --> 00:35:19,390
I've found that

815
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,160
their efforts and professionalism

816
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,810
are what I couldn't imagine previously.

817
00:35:23,480 --> 00:35:24,570
Some time ago,

818
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:27,090
the designer of the dining saloon suddenly resigned.

819
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:29,310
The Eighty-two Studio was the one that found a suitable person

820
00:35:29,340 --> 00:35:30,180
for me to take up the post.

821
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:31,260
After that,

822
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:33,820
in order to finish the task of opening of the dining saloon in advance,

823
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,850
they all took turns to keep an eye on the construction site.

824
00:35:36,930 --> 00:35:39,080
Because of this, Mr. Ke fell and hurt himself. Then he was hospitalized.

825
00:35:40,440 --> 00:35:43,270
Mr. Han, I can't interfere in your family affairs.

826
00:35:43,470 --> 00:35:45,020
But today, I still want to ask you

827
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,580
to give them a chance

828
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:48,310
and hear their true thoughts.

829

830
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:02,710
Go for it!

831
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:06,860
Mr. Han, you're here.

832
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,020
Please come in.

833
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,850
Mr. Han, please come in.

834
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:10,010
I'm here today

835
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:12,310
because I respect Mr. Lou.

836
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:14,970
If you have anything to say,

837
00:36:14,990 --> 00:36:16,040
now is the time.

838
00:36:16,350 --> 00:36:17,730
I don't have much time.

839
00:36:19,100 --> 00:36:20,900
En, brew some tea for Mr. Han.

840
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:28,580
Mr. Han, I'd like to sincerely apologize to you first.

841
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:30,300
I didn't manage the Eighty-two Studio well,

842
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:32,330
and made Han Chun suffer here.

843
00:36:32,950 --> 00:36:36,020
Now the Eighty-two Studo is developing by overcoming many difficulties.

844
00:36:36,590 --> 00:36:39,210
It was a big step of progress for us

845
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,090
to achieve long-term cooperation with the Peony Corporation.

846
00:36:41,560 --> 00:36:44,360
So, please give our Eighty-two Studio a chance.

847
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:46,140
Give Han Chun and me a chance

848
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,260
so that both of us can

849
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,810
watch the company founded by us develop better and better.

850
00:36:50,550 --> 00:36:51,530
Yes, Mr. Han.

851
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:53,070
Chunhua... Han Chun

852
00:36:53,090 --> 00:36:54,530
is the most reliable person in our company.

853
00:36:54,560 --> 00:36:55,930
We need to rely on him for many things.

854
00:36:55,950 --> 00:36:57,200
If you really replace him with another leader,

855
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,700
he might not be better than him.

856
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,410
What he meant just now is that

857
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:02,650
we all think that

858
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,640
Han Chun is a very capable man.

859
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:06,680
He's not like what you have thought,

860
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:08,220
and he wasn't messing around in a small company.

861
00:37:08,360 --> 00:37:09,620
On the contrary,

862
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,140
the smaller a company is, the more it can hone one's skills.

863
00:37:12,500 --> 00:37:16,380
He and Ke worked so hard and bore the pressure

864
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,730
while leading us, a group of young people,

865
00:37:18,810 --> 00:37:20,490
to develop the company little by little.

866
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,680
This can reflect his ability, right?

867
00:37:25,260 --> 00:37:27,860
Mr. Han, the tea is ready.

868
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,030
Come and have some tea.

Mr. Han.

874
00:38:04,170 --> 00:38:06,220
I know that you look down on our company.

875
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:08,530
You think that we are a small company,

876
00:38:08,910 --> 00:38:11,220
and there's no good prospect for us to work here.

877
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:14,540
But every day, Han Chun spent his time here

878
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:15,910
so happily.

the life he pursues is worthless.

883
