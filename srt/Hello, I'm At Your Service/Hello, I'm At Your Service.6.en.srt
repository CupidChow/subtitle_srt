192
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,720
this is a bit challenging.

193

the client of Peony and Sanjiao.

197
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:10,940
I think so.

198

I didn't expect

199
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:16,890
that one day, our company would become other companies' client.

I'm afraid they'll do something to En.

that we have a long-term cooperation with Ba'er.

219
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:57,120
Mr. Zhang knew that

220
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,760
Ba'er dared not be biased.

221
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:01,620
And their pricing is economical.

No.

I'm afraid that I'll make her faint.

229
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:14,920
But you shouldn't piss your mom off in the future.

230
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,140
Or you'll regret it.

The disputes between you and your mom can be resolved slowly.

But the company's decision can't be delayed.

237

Since it was founded,

as long as it gets paid, it'll take any project

253
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,170
or any job.

They have no bottom line when it comes to pleasing clients.

255
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,500
They also have no bottom line when it comes to collecting final payments.

256
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,740
They were at the edge of bankruptcy seven times.

257

What does Ba'er lack the most?

00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,860
to see if the new sauce

571
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,820
can be launched as a secret edition.

572
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,620
It doesn't matter if you reply to me later.

573
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:28,820
OK.

574
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:29,860
I'll give you feedback

575
00:24:29,890 --> 00:24:30,950
after reading it.

576
00:24:31,260 --> 00:24:32,380
Yuan.

577
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,160
I'm hanging up.

578
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,050
Yuan.

579
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Why are you two here?

580
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,610
The working hours are over.

581
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,110
It's the time for us Three Musketeers.

582
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:45,300
How long has it been since we watched a game together?

583
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:46,610
There's a ball game tonight.

584
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,770
Do you still have my snacks?

585
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:49,880
Let's review the story of the three of us.

586
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:51,340
It's all over there.

587
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:53,120
Well, why are you

588
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:54,340
here to watch the ball game suddenly?

589
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,300
Tomorrow morning,

590
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:57,300
I need to go check the venue of the tasting event.

591
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,270
I won't join you today.

592
00:24:58,300 --> 00:24:58,700
Well.

593
00:24:58,780 --> 00:25:00,030
Why are you going in person?

594
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:02,090
I can ask those kids in my apartment to go.

595
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,480
-Let me through.
-I have to...

596
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,940
Go in person.

597
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:05,820
The two of you watch it.

598
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,410
Let's not talk about work today.

599
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,650
Let’s watch the game.

600
00:25:08,690 --> 00:25:10,100
-The two of you are so slow.
-Look.

601
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:11,660
Stop nagging.

602
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:13,730
That's not right.

603
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:14,690
He started it.

604
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,070
He's like a universe cop

605
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,100
who talks a lot and worries a lot.

606
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,140
Well said.

607
00:25:20,300 --> 00:25:22,380
Why are you so chatty and broad-minded?

608
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:28,250
You two are really in harmony.

609
00:25:28,340 --> 00:25:29,260
When you talk about me,

610
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,210
the two of you cooperate

611
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,300
perfectly.

612
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:32,210
Perfect.

613
00:25:32,260 --> 00:25:34,060
-Forever.
-Again? Again?

614
00:25:34,060 --> 00:25:35,180
There you go again.

615
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:36,020
I'll get it.

616
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,740
Especially when

617
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,780
you gossip about others and matchmake others.

618
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:40,380
You're right.

619
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:42,540
He is annoying at this kind of moment.

620
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:57,040
The emancipated serfs sing songs.

621
00:25:57,260 --> 00:26:03,260
Happy songs are spread everywhere.

622
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,860
Why are you so happy? What happened?

623
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:08,000
It's my first time being a Party A.

624
00:26:08,020 --> 00:26:09,300
Of course, I'm happy.

625
00:26:10,850 --> 00:26:13,320
Sure. Let me interview you.

626
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,970
Miss Dong, you've been Party B all the time.

627
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,120
How does it feel to be Party A for the first time?

628
00:26:17,170 --> 00:26:18,390
One word. Awesome.

629
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,420
Let me tell you.

630
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,980
Lou Yuan and Su Qi

631
00:26:24,260 --> 00:26:25,330
have changed

632
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,470
their attitudes completely.

633
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:31,140
They either sent flowers or treated me to dinner.

634
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,760
In the past,

635
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:34,240
I wouldn't be treated like this.

636
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:36,580
I begged them and bought them dinner.

637
00:26:36,580 --> 00:26:37,900
Even so, they weren't willing to eat with me.

638
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,180
Great.

639
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:40,990
Two bosses are around you.

640
00:26:41,060 --> 00:26:42,840
I feel so happy thinking about it.

641
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,700
Let me tell you.

642
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:45,300
Mr. Lou even

643
00:26:45,330 --> 00:26:46,100
peeled the crab leg for me today.

644
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,820
The crab was so big.

645
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:49,860
So...

646
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:50,300
In the past,

647
00:26:50,300 --> 00:26:51,500
I couldn't even imagine it.

648
00:26:51,900 --> 00:26:53,140
Mr. Lou is so nice to you.

649
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,950
Don't you have any feelings for him?

650
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,800
What are you thinking?

651
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,180
He was asking me for a favor.

652
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:01,780
We're just working partners.

653
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:03,380
Putting work aside,

654
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:06,320
love is also the most important part of your life.

655
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:08,060
Alright, stop talking about me. Let's talk about you.

656
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:09,380
What happened between you and Ma Shi?

657
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,100
It's been so long.

658
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,140
The two of you are not together

659
00:27:11,140 --> 00:27:12,260
or broken up.

660
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,490
I was stuck between you two,

661
00:27:13,490 --> 00:27:14,370
acting like

662
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,350
a message pigeon.

663
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:16,330
Stop.

664
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,890
He and I broke up. He was like a dead man to me.

665
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:19,340
Why should I talk to a dead man?

666
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:21,740
Besides, he hasn't contacted me yet.

667
00:27:23,570 --> 00:27:25,540
You acted differently

668
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,480
towards your previous ex.

669
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:27,870
You answered his phone.

670
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:29,450
I asked him to pay me back.

671
00:27:30,660 --> 00:27:32,940
You have double standards when it comes to Shi.

672
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,320
He deserves it.

673
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:36,230
A man who broke up with me with cold violence

674
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:37,470
is unworthy of forgiveness.

675
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,690
Besides, I've come to my senses.

676
00:27:38,730 --> 00:27:40,850
I just want to work and make money.

677
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:43,580
You can date someone and do your job well at the same time.

678
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:44,480
It won't affect you.

679
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,140
You said

680
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,640
you were a money-making machine without feelings.

681
00:27:48,980 --> 00:27:49,710
Well.

682
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,670
If you can meet at the top

683
00:27:51,730 --> 00:27:53,620
and fight together,

684
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,480
even a money-making machine

685
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:56,960
still wants to be in love.

686
00:27:57,610 --> 00:27:58,300
You've changed.

687
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,850
You didn't used to say that before.

688
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:02,510
A person who has both love and a career

689
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:05,110
is the winner of life.

690
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:06,770
What you said

691
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,350
was the ideal perfect love story.

692
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,650
But in reality, two people really...

693
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:14,060
Forget it. You won't understand.

694
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,050
I'm going to bed.

695
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,340
Why do I feel that

696
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,430
Iron Tortoise is very gentle today?

697
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:23,610
What are you thinking?

698
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:24,490
Dong Dong'e, what are you thinking?

699
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:25,930
He's your client.

700
00:28:26,810 --> 00:28:27,540
Focus on your work.

701
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:40,750
The emancipated serfs sing songs.

702
00:28:41,090 --> 00:28:46,630
Happy songs are spread everywhere.

703
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:47,780
Hooray!

704
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:11,990
Good morning, Miss Dong.

705
00:29:12,770 --> 00:29:15,840
Mr. Su, why are you here?

706
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:17,100
Since you

707
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:18,540
don't want to have dinner with me,

708
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,360
I have to invite you personally.

709
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,630
No, I have something else to do today.

710
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:25,650
Mr. Su, please go back.

711
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:26,780
Well,

712
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,970
I can send you there.

713
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,390
No, I can go by myself.

714
00:29:30,890 --> 00:29:32,200
Take me there.

715
00:29:33,100 --> 00:29:35,230
That's not necessary.

716
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:36,540
Take me there.

717
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:37,610
Or I'll treat you to dinner.

718
00:29:37,610 --> 00:29:38,470
Choose one.

719
00:29:40,780 --> 00:29:41,460
Well,

720
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,810
I'll take you there.

721
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:43,500
Okay.

722
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,820
I'm sorry, Mr. Lou.

723
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,890
Mr. Su insisted on coming with me.

724
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:03,820
So I was late.

725
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,250
Mr. Su, why are you dressed so formally?

726
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,210
What? Are you here to give a speech?

727
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:11,360
Mr. Lou, with your casual suit,

728
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:11,920
people might think

729
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:13,800
you're here to pick up your sister from school.

730
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,900
Both of you look good and handsome.

731
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,130
Why don't we go in first? I'll park the motor.

732
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,460
Can't you drive?

733
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,900
[Hujing University]

734
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,890
[Eat in and Order]

735
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:35,540
Actually, I think the canteen is good.

736
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,410
First, the electricity problem is solved.

737
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:38,320
Besides,

738
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,070
if there's bad weather,

739
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:41,370
we won't be caught off guard.

740
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,190
Look.

741
00:30:42,690 --> 00:30:44,140
In the canteen,

742
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:44,940
there is a large crowd of people.

743
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:47,260
We can distribute the sauces to every window.

744
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,240
Then more people will try it.

745
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:50,380
[Eat in and Order]

746
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,530
Miss Dong.

747
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,680
That's a good idea.

748
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,460
In this way,

749
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,860
we can reduce the cost of setting up the venue.

750
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:57,480
That's a good idea.

751
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,740
But as you can see,

752
00:30:59,020 --> 00:31:00,410
it's hard for students

753
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,460
to wait in line

754
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,890
to try different flavors.

755
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,780

00:38:04,940 --> 00:38:06,180
we will really

946
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,260
lost certain layers of consumers.

947
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,470
The company will lose the market advantage.

948
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:10,900
So our top priority

949
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:11,910
is to develop

950
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,600
public consumption habits.

951
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,770
What should we do?

952
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,130
Actually, young consumers nowadays

953
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:21,490
are more willing to accept online purchases.

954
00:38:21,620 --> 00:38:23,550
So we did a promotion a few days ago

955
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,860
to attract traffic

956
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,040
with low prices.

957
00:38:26,180 --> 00:38:27,970
We provided online and offline discounts at the same time.

958
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,970
After a consumption habit is formed,

959
00:38:30,050 --> 00:38:31,580
we'll end the offline discount

960
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,670
and focus on online selling.

961
00:38:32,860 --> 00:38:34,540
That way, we can transfer customers

962
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:35,930
from offline to online platforms.

963
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,940
Will this plan work?

964
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:39,820
No matter what,

965
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:41,140
we have to give it a try.

Besides,

967
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,310
to maintain the market advantage,

968
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,770
we have to innovate

969
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,630

00:38:47,620 --> 00:38:48,300
