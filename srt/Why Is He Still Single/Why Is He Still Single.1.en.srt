50

Okay, that's all. Bye.

55

Are you in the wrong seat?

56
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,180
Sorry about that.

57
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,950
Can I switch seats with you?

58
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:11,880
Why?

59
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:12,790
I have this habit.

60
00:04:13,070 --> 00:04:15,240
I sit in that seat
every time I come to this hall.

61
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,620
But somehow,

62
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,990
you ended up buying it today.

63
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,420
I calculated it carefully.

64
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:31,940
The seat you're in right now

65
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:34,030
is exactly
where the hall's acoustics converge.

66
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:36,230
And the distance to the screen

67
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:37,940
also offers the best view.

68
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:40,110

the best audiovisual experience.

70
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:43,060
Why didn't you

71
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:44,590
just sit here from the start?

72
00:04:45,462 --> 00:04:47,151
Isn't the whole point of picking seats

73
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:48,860
so you sit where you choose?

74
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:50,350
You can't just sit anywhere.

75
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,910
I think you have a point.

76
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,470
Let's sit in the seats we bought then.

It's the weekend.

79

Mr. Yu, we have a problem.

80
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,550
We can't paint more green, Mr. Sun.

81
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,500
If you keep painting,

82
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,110
Mr. Yu will kill me.

83
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,380
Hey, you...

84
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:29,820
Just stay within this area.

85
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:30,928
Stop painting over there.

86
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:33,230
Mr. Yu, I couldn't stop him.

87
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:35,940
Sun, what's going on?

88
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:38,110
The work order,
design plan, materials list,

89
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:39,940
and the blueprint say deep scarlet.

90
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,417
Why are you painting it green?

91
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,590
The homeowner wants green.

92
00:05:42,662 --> 00:05:44,906
The homeowner wants green,
so you paint green?

93
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,550
What else would I do?

94
00:05:47,595 --> 00:05:49,884
You listen to the homeowner
or the blueprint? Huh?

95
00:05:49,928 --> 00:05:50,670
You tell me.

96
00:05:51,420 --> 00:05:52,260
Put that down.

97
00:05:52,620 --> 00:05:53,620
You want to fight?

98
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,300
- Miss, you're here.
- Hello.

99
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,884
I was nearby

100
00:05:57,884 --> 00:05:59,260
and thought I'd take a look.

101
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,500
Well, well, the designer is here.

102
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,620
Looks good.

103
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:08,740
This wall can't be green.

104
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:16,060
It's fine.

105
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:17,150
I told them to change it.

106
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:18,260
You can't change it.

107
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,062
I designed deep scarlet for you.

108
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,060
Elegant and dignified,

109
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:30,710
perfect for your elegance.

110
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:32,500
In ancient Europe,

111
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:34,110
this color was adored by nobles.

112
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,420
Look at the render.

113
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:36,710
If you switch it to green,

114
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:38,060
the whole effect changes.

115
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:40,180
And if you change other colors
to match the green,

116
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:41,740
the cost goes up too.

117
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,110
Leave everything else the same.

118
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:46,820
Just paint this wall green.

119
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:48,260
If you do that,

120
00:06:48,260 --> 00:06:49,670
the whole color balance

121
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:51,180
will look totally off.

122
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:52,420
Living in a space like that

123
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,940
will affect your personality.

124
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:56,820
You'll get irritable,
anxious, and depressed.

125
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:57,990
Don't scare me!

126
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:00,350
Listen.

127
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,230
I lack green in my fate.

128
00:07:02,470 --> 00:07:03,740
I like green.

129
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:05,470
No, the green you mean

130
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:06,310
isn't this green.

131
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,230
This is emerald green...

132
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,230
Enough!

133
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:11,500
Let me tell you.

134
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,740
I make the decisions here.

135
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:17,740
Anyone who changes the color

136
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,470
will be swapped.

137

138
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,940

156

00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,380
as a professional designer,

164
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,860
you never have the right
to criticize a client's taste.

165
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:33,140
It's been so many years.

166
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,230
Why are you still making
such rookie mistakes?

167
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,710
You should tell the client your concept.

168
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,430
Explain how you combine practicality

169
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,260
with your design philosophy.

170
00:08:41,590 --> 00:08:42,990
I just couldn't hold it in.

171
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,595

He'll explain it to everyone in a bit.

186
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:26,550
Let's go.

187
00:09:27,506 --> 00:09:29,340
(Yichu Era Decoration Group,
Ou Yang)

188
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,860
(Chief Contract Designer)
A smooth talker who only flirts around.

189
00:09:33,110 --> 00:09:33,950
Hey, uh...

190
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:35,800
Let's go.

191
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:36,862
What are you staring at?

192
00:09:37,595 --> 00:09:39,373
This is exactly
why I didn't want to come.

193
00:09:41,462 --> 00:09:43,351
It's a promotional seminar
full of newcomers.

194
00:09:43,351 --> 00:09:45,130
Why do I need to be here?
I'm not a newcomer.

195
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:47,590
If clients don't like these newcomers,

196
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,310
who do you think they'll notice instead?

197
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,870
- Me.
- Exactly.

198
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:52,470
You're here to hold down the fort.

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,950
These seven newcomers
are all counting on you.

200
00:09:55,528 --> 00:09:57,190
I'm not the old man
in Calabash Brothers.

201
00:09:57,190 --> 00:09:58,540
You can be Snow White if you want.

202
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:01,140
Remember. I'm here to promote you.

203
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:02,500
No need to thank me.

204
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:04,190
Just cooperate.

205
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:05,460
Cheer up.

206
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,950
You're sulking

207
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,860
like someone owes you money.

208
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,110
Mr. Yu, Ms. Lin.

209
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:11,260
You're here.

210
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:12,900
The presentation slides are ready.

211
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:15,780
Here, keep an eye on Mr. Yu.

212
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,740
Don't let him run off.

213
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:18,830
Watch him for me. Watch closely.

214
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:21,310
Okay.

215
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,190
Wait, Mr. Yu.

216
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,620
Why did you use a black-and-white photo
for this poster?

217
00:10:33,990 --> 00:10:35,306
Because I'll look stunning

218
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:36,660
when my colored face appears.

219
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:38,590
It's color psychology. Got it?

220
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:41,990
No wonder you're the master

221
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:42,990
and I'm the disciple.

222
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,350
- Wu.
- Yeah?

223
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:50,728
Want to switch roles and be the master?

224
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:55,660
Next,

225
00:10:55,660 --> 00:10:56,870
let's welcome

226
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:58,660
Yichu Decoration Group's

227
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:00,990
most senior designer,

228
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:02,230
Yu Yu.

229
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:18,820
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

230
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,660
Distinguished guests,

231
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,780
good evening.

232
00:11:21,990 --> 00:11:23,780
I'm an architectural designer.

233
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,430
(Home is a social invention.)

234
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:30,470
(It doesn't just turn)

235
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:32,500
(biological humans into social humans.)

236
00:11:33,430 --> 00:11:35,900
(Home is the only place
where flaws and failures can hide.)

237
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:39,310
(It holds sweetness and love.)

238
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:43,540
(It's also the only place in modern life
where fire can be lit.)

239
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,900
(Only then does home
have warmth and character.)

240
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,070
(When a family sits together
for a meal,)

241
00:11:53,350 --> 00:11:55,470
(that's when home feels the best.)

242
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,620
(So my designs all revolve around this.)

243
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:02,380
(I call this the warm zone.)

244
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,860
(Human warmth.)

245
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,260
My interior designs begin with the home.

246
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:20,310
A place that only lets you sleep
isn't a home.

247
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:22,540
For example, a hotel.

248
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,470
Want a bowl?

249
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,340
What kind of noodles?

250
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,540
Authentic Tianjin noodles with gravy.

251
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:40,380
Authentic?

252
00:12:41,617 --> 00:12:42,990
This isn't hand-pulled noodles.

253
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,470
And the sauce is way too clear.

254
00:12:44,710 --> 00:12:45,900
The toppings are pathetic.

255
00:12:46,310 --> 00:12:47,990
There are so many. How is this pathetic?

256
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,220
There are like

257
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,830
four or five.

258
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,190
Is four or five a lot?

259
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:55,620
In Tianjin,
that barely fills a side platter.

260
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:57,380
And there's no red sheet.

261
00:12:57,462 --> 00:12:58,500
How can it share in my joy?

262
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,380
I didn't expect you
to know noodles this well.

263
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,950
I went to university in Tianjin.

264
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:04,800
Of course I know.

265
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,710
And this isn't knowledge.

266
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:09,310
It's taste.
What you eat isn't the point.

267
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:10,990
But you must be particular.

268
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:12,150
Never settle.

269
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:16,310
You're Mr. Yu, right?

270
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,780
What you did earlier was so cool.

271
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:22,070
Your warm zone totally proved

272
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,617
your "no settling with food" philosophy.

273
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:24,710
I love it.

274
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:25,950
Oh?

275
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,070
You love food too?

276
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:28,030
Yeah.

277
00:13:28,310 --> 00:13:29,260
For example,

278
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:31,500
this Tianjin noodles with gravy.

279
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:33,830
If I could eat an authentic bowl of it

280
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,380
in your warm zone,

281
00:13:37,140 --> 00:13:38,350
that would be bliss.

282
00:13:38,830 --> 00:13:40,380
No need to go to my house. Wait here.

283
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:46,700
(Tianjin Noodles With Gravy)

284
00:14:21,430 --> 00:14:23,070
He said eating red sheet

285
00:14:23,070 --> 00:14:24,500
could help me share some of your joy.

286
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,500
Miss.

287
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,780
It's freezing and you're telling jokes.

288
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,110
Your hair's literally blowing up.

289
00:14:29,110 --> 00:14:30,350
It's true.

290
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:33,660
I even flew to Los Angeles
just to eat curry last week.

291
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:34,860
Huh?

292
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,780
A spontaneous trip?

293
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,310
But shouldn't you go to India for curry?

294
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,110
You've screwed me over today.

295
00:14:44,173 --> 00:14:45,660
- Here.
- Why are you giving me this?

296
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,740
No. Hey.

297
00:14:53,070 --> 00:14:53,990
Did you just throw up?

298
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:00,540
(Wildebeest Space)

299
00:15:08,260 --> 00:15:09,230
Isn't Wildebeest Space...

300
00:15:11,151 --> 00:15:13,620
just a store that rents Blu-rays
and sells second-hand copies?

301
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,430
I sell sentimentality.

302
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:19,020
Everything here was pre-loved.

303
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:20,990
I'm the relay baton of love,

304
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:23,740
passing it
to the next person who'll love it.

305
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,950
Any problem with that?

306
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,260
How sentimental.

307
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,140
My name's Huaiqing.
Of course I have sentiment.

308
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:35,430
Right now it's not about the noodles.

309
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,540
It's about skill.

310
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,030
Skill for what?

311
00:15:39,590 --> 00:15:40,470
I'm trying to show her

312
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:43,070
what an authentic Tianjin noodle
really is.

313
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,660
You really are something.

314
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,260
You always manage to annoy a woman
within ten sentences.

315
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,070
Hmph.

316
00:15:53,070 --> 00:15:53,910
Hmph what?

317
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,620
Not convinced? Let's bet.

318
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,500
Bet on what?

319
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,751
Whatever it is, you'll lose.

320
00:15:58,350 --> 00:15:59,620
- Li.
- Hey, Andi.

321
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,830
Call me Huaiqing.

322
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,310
Alright, Li. Any new releases lately?

323
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,430
The whole second row is new.

324
00:16:05,430 --> 00:16:06,351
Pick whatever you like.

325
00:16:09,190 --> 00:16:11,070
Hey, Andi, let me introduce you.

326
00:16:11,620 --> 00:16:13,500
This is the famous designer,

327
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,660
Mr. Yu Yu.

328
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,310
This is Andi, my good friend.

329
00:16:17,830 --> 00:16:19,900
Hello, Mr. Yu Yu.

330
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:20,740
Yeah.

331
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:28,430
You're doomed to lose.

332
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:32,700
Hello.

333
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,900
Oh, hello.

334
00:16:34,928 --> 00:16:36,540
Have you tried
noodles with gravy before?

335
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:38,270
Ah...

336
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,350
Yes.

337
00:16:39,351 --> 00:16:41,310
Compared to curry rice,
which tastes better?

338
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,260
Can these two be compared?

339
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,860
If you had to choose one,

340
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,190
which would it be?

341
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:49,750
Curry.

342
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:50,620
Mm.

343
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:53,900
What do you think of me?

344
00:16:59,110 --> 00:17:01,230
Pretty good.

345
00:17:04,710 --> 00:17:05,590
- Hey.
- Hey.

346
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:06,550
Andi.

347
00:17:06,670 --> 00:17:07,570
Hey!

348
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,580
Why are you leaving?

349
00:17:08,595 --> 00:17:10,062
Hey, she said I'm pretty good.

350
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:12,230
Pretty good?

351
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:15,950
Why did she come?

352
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,470
To rent discs.

353
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:18,820
Why did she leave?

354
00:17:20,870 --> 00:17:22,430
You only said five sentences.

355
00:17:22,462 --> 00:17:25,310
And you've already
seriously affected my business. Pal.

356
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,617
This round doesn't count.

357
00:17:26,662 --> 00:17:27,390
I wasn't ready.

358
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,740
Do you have a loyalty card?

359
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:41,830
No.

360
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,540
That'll be 98.40 yuan in total.

361
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,790
How much is this?

362
00:17:44,950 --> 00:17:45,790
1.60 yuan.

363
00:17:47,017 --> 00:17:49,730
You get a lottery draw if you spend
more than 100 yuan. Want to try?

364
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,660
Sure.

365
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:04,180
(Happy Shopping, Lucky to Have You,
Scratch Area, First Prize)

366
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:05,740
Congratulations, you won first prize.

367
00:18:05,790 --> 00:18:06,670
How big is the prize?

368
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,550
Huh?

369
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:08,430
I'm taking a taxi.

370
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,820
(Movie Voucher)

371
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:22,060
You really are something.

372
00:18:22,710 --> 00:18:25,580
You always manage to annoy a woman
within ten sentences.

373
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,340
Hey, how much is this?

374
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,395
Tell me. How big is the prize?
I'm taking a taxi.

375
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:32,430
How much for the gum?

376
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,030
12.

377
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,340
- Can it blow bubbles?
- No.

378
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,270
Why?

379
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,260
Because it's not bubble gum.

380
00:18:38,340 --> 00:18:39,470
Do you have bubble gum?

381
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,790
Are you buying it?

382
00:18:43,910 --> 00:18:44,820
Do you dislike me?

383
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:08,540
Juan, did the cheese
I ordered last time arrive?

384
00:19:08,573 --> 00:19:10,817
- It did. Okay.
- Could you grab it for me? Thanks.

385
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:29,710
Xia Xiaoman, I love you.

386
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:34,470
Go away!

387
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,020
Hey, do you think

388
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,710
all the men I meet are problematic?

389
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:43,260
I even met a man

390
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,300
at dinner yesterday.

391
00:19:44,470 --> 00:19:45,728
Six years old. Want to meet him?

392
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:46,390
I'm telling you.

393
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,780
I have nothing to do with you
from today on.

394
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:51,470
What? No one's cooking for you,

395
00:19:51,820 --> 00:19:52,820
and you missed me?

396
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:54,580
Eat?

397
00:19:54,580 --> 00:19:55,580
Get jealous.

398
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,620
Hey.

399
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:01,630
Qing.

400
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:04,540
No, I just argued with him.

401
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:06,340
I stormed out in anger.

402
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:07,950
I know.

403
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:10,500
Hearing that alone is enough.

404
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:15,580
My uncle always has a spare room.

405
00:20:15,580 --> 00:20:16,595
He lets me stay there.

406
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:19,150
(Riverside Building)
I think I'm almost there.

407
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:26,020
I feel like
I've time-traveled to the Republic era.

408
00:20:27,430 --> 00:20:29,580
Alright, I'll stop talking to you.

409
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,910
I'm entering the elevator.

410
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:38,230
Ah.

411
00:20:50,580 --> 00:20:51,420
Xia Xiaoman.

412
00:20:53,670 --> 00:20:54,510
It loves you.

413
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:57,740
Oh, thanks.

414
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,470
Why are you following me?

415
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,390
Are you moving in here?

416
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:01,540
Oh, we're neighbors now.

417
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,710
When will you move out?

418
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:06,020
Soon, I guess. Why?

419
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:07,030
This wall is bad.

420
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,060
Xia Xiaoman, I love you.

421
00:22:18,710 --> 00:22:19,910
I love you so much.

422
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:21,910
I love you extremely, extremely much.

423
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,060
Xia Xiaoman.

424
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:28,150
Can you be quiet?

425
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:34,380
Great.

426
00:22:51,150 --> 00:22:54,470
Dao, look at our place.

427
00:23:01,470 --> 00:23:02,780
Wow, the kitchen.

428
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,740
Our room.

429
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:20,260
Wow, Dao, look. Isn't it beautiful?

430
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,100
Dao.

431
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:56,780
Dao, you didn't help me when I fell.

432
00:23:57,340 --> 00:23:58,180
Okay.

433
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:00,870
Got it.

434
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:02,060
Yes, thanks.

435
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,300
Dao.

436
00:24:14,470 --> 00:24:15,360
Alright.

437
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:16,870
I know you love me.

438
00:24:18,870 --> 00:24:19,780
Dao.

439
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,100
Dao.

440
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,540
Alright.

441
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:27,700
(Inspiration)

442
00:24:36,990 --> 00:24:38,630
This is way too noisy.

443
00:24:39,190 --> 00:24:40,030
Dao.

444
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
Hey.

445
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,630
It's too noisy.

446
00:25:01,551 --> 00:25:02,630
You want me to be quiet?

447
00:25:02,630 --> 00:25:03,710
Why aren't you quiet then?

448
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:27,670
Can you be quiet?

449
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:48,060
What's wrong with you?

450
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,580
It hurts...

451
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:55,595
(Emergency)
This seems like a hemorrhoid flare-up.

452
00:25:56,020 --> 00:25:57,150
Do you need pain relief now?

453
00:25:58,262 --> 00:25:59,740
Which hospital do you want to go to?

454
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,190
Zhongjing Private Hospital.

455
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,420
Alright.

456
00:26:04,340 --> 00:26:05,390
Hold your husband steady.

457
00:26:05,610 --> 00:26:06,470
Hey, he...

458
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:07,470
He's not my husband.

459
00:26:10,020 --> 00:26:10,860
Oh.

460
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:24,100
What? Strangulated hernia?

461
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,950
It's been five hours since the onset.

462
00:26:25,973 --> 00:26:27,300
It can cause intestinal necrosis.

463
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,300
It's life-threatening.

464
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,780
We need surgery immediately.

465
00:26:34,670 --> 00:26:36,710
Fortunately, it hasn't strangulated yet.

466
00:26:36,910 --> 00:26:38,950
Dr. Gu is trying manual reduction.

467
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,910
What? Manual reduction?

468
00:26:41,090 --> 00:26:42,430
It's been so long since the onset.

469
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:43,470
It's difficult.

470
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,430
But the advantage
is that no surgery is required.

471
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,260
It can recover quickly,
reducing patient pain.

472
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,710
Yeah, surgery pain is still pain.

473
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:54,340
Dr. Gu always considers
the patient's perspective.

474
00:27:20,340 --> 00:27:21,990
How are you? Feeling better?

475
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:23,830
Much better.

476
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,420
Dr. Gu.

477
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:26,710
The surgery room is ready.

478
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:27,862
You can go in for surgery.

479
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:30,300
No need.
I've reduced the bowel into the abdomen.

480
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,300
Give the patient
a CT scan of his abdomen.

481
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:33,790
Then the patient can return to the ward.

482
00:27:33,795 --> 00:27:34,440
Yeah.

483
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,380
Okay.

484
00:27:36,470 --> 00:27:37,310
Monitor closely.

485
00:27:40,870 --> 00:27:41,710
Ah...

486
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,420
Name?

487
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:57,590
- Yu Yu.
- Age?

488
00:27:57,850 --> 00:27:59,020
2 days until I'm 40.

489
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:06,470
Doctor, he said he wants
Zhong Liangchuan to examine him.

490
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:08,350
The vice director
went for an urgent consult.

491
00:28:08,351 --> 00:28:09,000
Ah?

492
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,190
Family, please wait outside.

493
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,910
I'm not family.

494
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:14,860
Hello?

495
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,500
Have you taken painkillers?

496
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,530
No.

497
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:19,810
Do you have high blood pressure,

498
00:28:19,810 --> 00:28:21,150
- diabetes or heart disease?
- None.

499
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:22,519
- Allergies?
- None.

500
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,490
Family medical history?

501
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,340
None.

502
00:28:24,373 --> 00:28:25,380
Prepare for a rectal exam.

503
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:26,870
Ah? Rectal exam?

504
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:28,580
I'll perform an anoscopy to examine you.

505
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,820
I'm asking why a rectal exam.

506
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:32,470
Because 120 ER
shows you have acute hemorrhoids.

507
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:35,150
They're my interns.

508
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,340
Pull down his pants.

509
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,390
- Hey, you...
- No!

510
00:28:39,390 --> 00:28:40,740
Hey.

511
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,430
Hey, you can't leave.

512
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,150
I'm not in pain anymore.

513
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,340
Go on then.

514
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,910
Ah.

515
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,820
How about this?

516
00:28:59,306 --> 00:29:01,260
Today we'll use
hemorrhoid suppositories first.

517
00:29:01,328 --> 00:29:02,870
I'll also prescribe some oral ibuprofen.

518
00:29:02,995 --> 00:29:04,580
You'll stay overnight for observation.

519
00:29:04,580 --> 00:29:06,430
Tomorrow morning,
we'll reassess your condition

520
00:29:06,470 --> 00:29:08,300
and plan further treatment. Okay?

521
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:14,260
If you insist I stay,

522
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:15,900
it's not impossible.

523
00:29:18,217 --> 00:29:19,795
Come on. Let's fill the prescription.

524
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,795
You've just said
your 13th sentence to me.

525
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:23,140
So?

526
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:24,910
Do you dislike me?

527
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,430
No.

528
00:29:28,340 --> 00:29:29,340
You're a good doctor.

529
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:35,390
Thanks. You be a good patient too, okay?

530
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:39,020
How is Dr. Gu so amazing?

531
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,060
She can handle any kind of patient.

532
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:42,740
What are you saying?

533
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,740
You're mumbling.

534
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:45,670
Song, Ping Yang.

535
00:29:45,690 --> 00:29:46,440
- Yeah.
- Here.

536
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:47,560
Take him to fill his prescription.

537
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,390
- Okay.
- Okay.

538
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:50,500
I'll help you.

539
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:51,340
Don't touch me.

540
00:29:51,950 --> 00:29:52,950
I can walk myself.

541
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:54,780
Over there.

542
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:00,950
What?

543
00:30:01,390 --> 00:30:03,260
I'm just doing a good deed.

544
00:30:03,630 --> 00:30:05,260
So what if I just moved here?

545
00:30:05,390 --> 00:30:07,500
I can't ignore someone who's sick.

546
00:30:10,710 --> 00:30:11,550
Hello.

547
00:30:11,670 --> 00:30:14,390
The man admitted earlier
needs overnight observation.

548
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:15,820
Are you staying with him?

549
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,790
A man?

550
00:30:16,884 --> 00:30:18,500
The one you sent to hospital is a man?

551
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,500
He's a middle-aged man.

552
00:30:21,580 --> 00:30:22,630
He's my neighbor.

553
00:30:22,780 --> 00:30:23,740
Believe it or not.

554
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:28,040
Sorry. Did I say something wrong?

555
00:30:28,040 --> 00:30:30,060
No, it's fine. You don't have to
worry about my boyfriend.

556
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:30,990
He's always jealous.

557
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:34,190
How is my neighbor?

558
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:35,230
He's got hemorrhoids.

559
00:30:35,390 --> 00:30:36,430
I've given him medication.

560
00:30:36,430 --> 00:30:37,630
We need to see if it works.

561
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:39,670
If not, surgery might be considered.

562
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:42,630
But no major issues for now.

563
00:30:43,150 --> 00:30:45,870
Can I leave then?

564
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,500
Technically, yes.

565
00:30:47,710 --> 00:30:48,710
Okay, thanks.

566
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:50,140
Bye.

567
00:30:54,817 --> 00:30:56,351
The patient was admitted overnight.

568
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,862
He's given topical treatment
like pain relief and antibiotics,

569
00:30:58,928 --> 00:31:00,470
and hemorrhoid suppositories.

570
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:01,910
Symptoms eased overnight.

571
00:31:01,910 --> 00:31:03,106
He can sleep intermittently.

572
00:31:03,106 --> 00:31:05,573
This morning,
anal pain eased, no bleeding.

573
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,710
Okay.

574
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:09,540
This patient has a typical
external hemorrhoid history.

575
00:31:09,820 --> 00:31:10,950
Schedule a colonoscopy.

576
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:13,230
Regular checkups
are necessary at this age.

577
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:14,100
Okay.

578
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:16,060
Alright, you can all leave now.

579
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:25,310
Hey, Yu.

580
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:27,430
Still in pain? Feeling better?

581
00:31:27,595 --> 00:31:29,100
You did a great job acting as director.

582
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:31,020
(Zhong Liangchuan, Vice Director)
Vice director.

583
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:34,470
Here's your 5,000 yuan back.

584
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,340
Transfer it to me.

585
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:38,100
Transfers leave a trace.

586
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:39,260
My wife would find out.

587
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,500
Besides, don't you like cash?

588
00:31:44,950 --> 00:31:46,540
Can you lend me 10,000 yuan more?

589
00:31:46,670 --> 00:31:47,510
No.

590
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,390
Dad.

591
00:31:52,060 --> 00:31:52,900
Uncle.

592
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,120
Yu.

593
00:31:54,130 --> 00:31:55,150
How are you?

594
00:31:55,230 --> 00:31:56,260
Oh, I'm fine.

595
00:31:56,890 --> 00:31:59,020
Why did you bring flowers?
They'll be thrown away anyway.

596
00:31:59,020 --> 00:31:59,950
You're overthinking.

597
00:32:00,430 --> 00:32:01,630
I bought them for myself.

598
00:32:02,020 --> 00:32:03,430
I hate the smell of bachelors.

599
00:32:04,300 --> 00:32:05,340
Bachelor.

600
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,470
Mom.

601
00:32:09,190 --> 00:32:10,030
Here, eat quickly.

602
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,910
Why eat a red egg?

603
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,020
I'm not in confinement.

604
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:16,390
Today is the seventh day.

605
00:32:16,484 --> 00:32:18,230
Eating red eggs
brings good luck in love.

606
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,430
I won't eat.

607
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:20,550
You must eat.

608
00:32:22,060 --> 00:32:22,900
Later.

609
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:26,100
Uncle, what illness do you have?

610
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:28,870
A secret.

611
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:31,100
Why be shy about it?

612
00:32:32,300 --> 00:32:33,190
Stop nagging.

613
00:32:33,340 --> 00:32:34,950
Where were you
messing around last night?

614
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:36,240
I couldn't find you anywhere.

615
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:37,940
Messing around?

616
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,300
Messing around?

617
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:42,230
I had a consultation last night.

618
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:44,740
Yu, don't speak recklessly.

619
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:46,100
I'm telling you guys.

620
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:47,780
Don't collude to trick me.

621
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:49,580
I never collude with anyone.

622
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:54,390
If your brother were colluding,
would he still dislike women?

623
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,100
Mom, why would I dislike women?

624
00:32:57,150 --> 00:32:58,540
Then show me who you like.

625
00:32:58,540 --> 00:32:59,630
Bring her here.

626
00:32:59,780 --> 00:33:00,910
What are you here for?

627
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,780
To push you to get married.

628
00:33:04,020 --> 00:33:05,300
(Lin Sa)

629
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,420
Hello?

630
00:33:08,910 --> 00:33:10,390
You said you'd go to the site today.

631
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:11,230
Where are you?

632
00:33:12,462 --> 00:33:13,580
- I'm sick.
- A woman.

633
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:14,750
Stop faking it.

634
00:33:15,820 --> 00:33:16,670
Woman?

635
00:33:16,670 --> 00:33:17,910
Go to the site immediately.

636
00:33:18,230 --> 00:33:19,190
Hello?

637
00:33:22,670 --> 00:33:24,100
Who's this woman?

638
00:33:25,390 --> 00:33:26,390
No one.

639
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:27,870
Then why is she...

640
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:28,990
Okay, Mom, stop talking.

641
00:33:28,990 --> 00:33:29,910
I'm going to work.

642
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,630
Hey, where are you going?

643
00:33:37,770 --> 00:33:38,610
To work.

644
00:33:38,630 --> 00:33:39,630
You can't leave.

645
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:40,710
You still have tests pending.

646
00:33:40,910 --> 00:33:41,750
I'm fine now.

647
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,260
That's just the medicine working.

648
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:45,260
If you don't complete treatment,
it will recur.

649
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,820
The recurrence
could be worse than before.

650
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:47,660
Aren't you tired?

651
00:33:47,684 --> 00:33:48,549
Huh?

652
00:33:48,550 --> 00:33:49,880
You just finished a night shift.

653
00:33:49,884 --> 00:33:51,040
You should go back and sleep.

654
00:33:51,795 --> 00:33:53,260
You need to take care of your health.

655
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,580
Don't think you're still young.

656
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:55,884
You're not that young anymore.

657
00:33:55,950 --> 00:33:58,820
When you answer calls,
you don't say "hello"

658
00:33:58,820 --> 00:33:59,740
or "hi", right?

659
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:00,820
You just say "hey".

660
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,270
Huh?

661
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:03,300
If that's the case,

662
00:34:03,395 --> 00:34:05,195
you're also not that young anymore.

663
00:34:12,870 --> 00:34:13,710
Hey.

664
00:34:13,870 --> 00:34:14,790
Hey, Jia.

665
00:34:15,106 --> 00:34:17,084
Last time I asked you
to go on a blind date.

666
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,390
You stood me up again.

667
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,830
Meet him today.

668
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:20,670
Okay.

669
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,790
Do you like babies?

670
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,390
Our baby.

671
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,470
I do like kids.

672
00:34:32,500 --> 00:34:34,500
Great, I like them too.

673
00:34:36,084 --> 00:34:37,350
Now that the policy is relaxed,

674
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:39,310
I think we should have at least two.

675
00:34:39,310 --> 00:34:41,660
No, the more, the better.

676
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,140
And I'm the type of person

677
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:46,990
who doesn't hold traditional
son-preference views.

678
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,060
But I think

679
00:34:49,060 --> 00:34:52,790
we should first discuss inheritance.

680
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:56,620
No.

681
00:34:56,620 --> 00:34:57,460
Hey.

682
00:34:59,020 --> 00:35:00,950
It'll be fine
after meeting a few more times.

683
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,220
(Noodles From the Dingmao Year)
Jia.

684
00:35:18,220 --> 00:35:20,100
(Bus 220, Yanji East Road Terminal)
Did you go on that blind date?

685
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:20,950
I did.

686
00:35:21,140 --> 00:35:22,700
- How was it?
- Not bad.

687
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:24,270
Tall and handsome.

688
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:25,160
Successful in career.

689
00:35:25,170 --> 00:35:26,030
Not for me.

690
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:26,980
Huh?

691
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,750
Dad, my standards aren't high.

692
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:30,700
Just easy on the eyes,

693
00:35:30,790 --> 00:35:31,790
share interests,

694
00:35:31,790 --> 00:35:33,020
and have things to talk about.

695
00:35:33,020 --> 00:35:34,020
I'm busy.

696
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:35,060
I have work today.

697
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:35,950
Can you...

698
00:35:37,910 --> 00:35:39,580
Fine.

699
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,580
But I remind you,

700
00:35:40,595 --> 00:35:42,500
you have one more
blind date slot this month.

701
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:46,950
Your scallion oil noodles.

702
00:35:46,950 --> 00:35:48,084
Half a portion of spicy pork.

703
00:35:48,240 --> 00:35:49,090
Thanks.

704
00:35:49,110 --> 00:35:51,500
Why are you back so late tonight?

705
00:35:51,870 --> 00:35:52,870
Actually, not too late.

706
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,500
I already had a meal earlier,

707
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:55,700
but I couldn't finish it.

708
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,350
Your noodles are still the best.

709
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,580
What a big balcony.

710
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:21,020
The view isn't bad either.

711
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:25,310
Has that uncle been divorced twice?

712
00:36:26,430 --> 00:36:28,580
Yeah, he just got divorced recently,

713
00:36:28,580 --> 00:36:29,790
so he went traveling.

714
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:31,310
That's why this place became available.

715
00:36:32,106 --> 00:36:34,870
You should've said so. Tell me
next time he marries for the third time.

716
00:36:36,690 --> 00:36:37,540
Alright.

717
00:36:37,540 --> 00:36:40,470
Stop getting upset
over that jerk.

718
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:42,230
I'm telling you.

719
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,390
He doesn't love you.

720
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:45,217
Otherwise,
he'd have come to cheer you up.

721
00:36:45,350 --> 00:36:47,830
He's acting like this
just to force you to break up with him.

722
00:36:48,870 --> 00:36:51,790
No, he said he really loves me before

723
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:52,990
and even wanted to marry me.

724
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:54,950
He probably says that
to every girlfriend.

725
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:56,620
Anyway,

726
00:36:56,620 --> 00:37:00,180
you can't just settle for anyone
just to get married.

727
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,580
You have to choose a good one.

728
00:37:03,795 --> 00:37:06,506
What about the neighbor
you took to the hospital last time?

729
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:09,180
He's just a weird older guy.

730
00:37:09,790 --> 00:37:10,660
Ten years later,

731
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:13,220
he won't be handsome, just weird.

732
00:37:18,830 --> 00:37:20,790
Who's coming? Go help open the door.

733
00:37:23,220 --> 00:37:24,430
Coming.

734
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,830
Who's there?

735
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:32,020
Wait for me.

736
00:37:32,030 --> 00:37:33,484
Open the door when I come out.

737
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:38,180
Oh, hello.

738
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:39,180
I'm Shen Wu.

739
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,990
I'm your neighbor, Mr. Yu's assistant.

740
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:42,310
Just call me Wu.

741
00:37:42,310 --> 00:37:43,160
Hello.

742
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,430
One of these is a gift from Mr. Yu.

743
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:47,395
The other is the medical fee
you helped pay first.

744
00:37:47,395 --> 00:37:49,120
Thanks for taking Mr. Yu
to the hospital.

745
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,180
How kind.

746
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,390
(Movie Voucher)
Two tickets

747
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:58,430
and one lollipop?

748
00:37:59,140 --> 00:38:00,060
Too little?

749
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:03,540
No, it's the thought that counts.

750
00:38:03,750 --> 00:38:05,350
This gift is significant.

751
00:38:05,910 --> 00:38:07,390
This is my gift to you.

752
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:12,350
Why are you giving me a gift?

753
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:14,180
He's my superior after all.

754
00:38:14,180 --> 00:38:15,870
I'd be jobless
if anything happens to him.

755
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:18,380
Speaking of,

756
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,270
add me on WeChat.

757
00:38:20,270 --> 00:38:21,660
If anything happens to Mr. Yu,

758
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:23,270
you can just contact me directly.

759
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:27,110
- Okay.
- Okay.

760
00:38:27,270 --> 00:38:28,470
Thanks, appreciate it.

761
00:38:28,470 --> 00:38:29,310
No problem.

762
00:38:31,660 --> 00:38:33,430
Open the door. I'm ready.

763
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,830
Why did you put on full makeup?

764
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,950
He's quite handsome.

765
00:38:38,370 --> 00:38:39,220
He's gone.

766
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:41,270
He's gone?
Why didn't you ask him to stay?

767
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:08,260
- Sun.
- Yes?

768
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:09,750
The lines aren't aligned.

769
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,470
Ah, don't be so fussy.

770
00:39:15,706 --> 00:39:16,790
Where is it not aligned?

771
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,470
Check yourself if it's aligned.

772
00:39:23,706 --> 00:39:24,790
What are you looking at?

773
00:39:24,790 --> 00:39:26,217
Do what you're supposed to do.

774
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:32,020
Hey, I told you to come see.

775
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:32,860
No.

776
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,310
Tear it up and redo it.

777
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:39,870
Why?

778
00:39:39,870 --> 00:39:41,262
Because your work is substandard.

779
00:39:42,750 --> 00:39:44,220
The client didn't say anything.

780
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:45,540
Why so fussy?

781
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:46,390
Fussy?

782
00:39:46,390 --> 00:39:47,310
There are standards.

783
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:48,230
What standards?

784
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,830
I'm a proper Hui craftsman.

785
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,710
13 generations in my family
have built houses.

786
00:39:52,700 --> 00:39:54,500
My great-grandfather
built an emperor's tomb.

787
00:39:54,500 --> 00:39:55,430
What about yours?

788
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:57,500
Alright. What does your ancestor
have to do with this?

789
00:39:57,506 --> 00:39:58,730
Are you tearing it down or not?

790
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:03,700
No.

791
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,660
No? Fine, I'll tear it.

792
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:07,150
Hey!

793
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:09,310
What are you doing?

794
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,700
I call the shots here.

795
00:40:10,830 --> 00:40:11,830
I decide the effect.

796
00:40:11,850 --> 00:40:12,700
Give me.

797
00:40:12,700 --> 00:40:13,620
I just got to the site.

798
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,830
Okay.

799
00:40:15,390 --> 00:40:17,310
I'll go shopping with you
after work, okay?

800
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,580
Stop being so fussy. What are you doing?

801
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,284
Mr. Yu and the foreman
are fighting again.

802
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:22,100
Hey, let go.

803
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:23,060
What are you doing?

804
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,099
Tear it down or not?

805
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,660
This is the fifth time this month.

806
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:26,860
Are you tearing it down or not?

807
00:40:26,862 --> 00:40:28,350
You're way too fussy.

808
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,310
Win or lose?

809
00:40:34,580 --> 00:40:36,870
I can't tell who's winning right now.

810
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,140
What are you doing?

811
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,590
Are you tearing it down or not?

812
00:40:41,540 --> 00:40:42,540
Gosh.

813
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,540
Are you okay, Mr. Sun?

814
00:40:43,660 --> 00:40:44,500
I'm telling you.

815
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,540
Mr. Yu won today.

816
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:47,870
Ah, my leg.

817
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:49,060
Ah, my leg.

818
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:50,470
I can't feel my leg.

819
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:51,390
Ah.

820
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:52,862
Look at how you're pretending...

821
00:40:52,910 --> 00:40:53,750
Ah!

822
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,110
Ah!

823
00:40:57,795 --> 00:40:59,020
Look at how you're pretending.

824
00:40:59,020 --> 00:41:00,528
I'll hang up first. Talk to you later.

825
00:41:00,528 --> 00:41:01,910
I didn't even hit you in the butt.

826
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:02,950
Mr. Yu, are you okay?

827
00:41:05,020 --> 00:41:05,910
Don't touch my butt.

830
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:40,617
You haven't fought enough?

831
00:41:44,995 --> 00:41:46,906
Is there seriously
something wrong with you?

832
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,700
You're even fighting with Sun.

833
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,060
Is something really wrong with you?

834
00:41:50,060 --> 00:41:50,990
Have I ever lied?

835
00:41:51,390 --> 00:41:52,230
Never.

836
00:41:52,830 --> 00:41:54,500
It's because you're so blunt

837
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:56,180
that things went wrong.

838
00:41:56,500 --> 00:41:57,350
I mean...

839
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:00,660
Why be embarrassed to tell me
that you're sick?

840
00:42:00,830 --> 00:42:02,700
If you find it embarrassing to say,

841
00:42:02,830 --> 00:42:04,950
you could have told me more tactfully.

842
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:06,140
Tactfully? How?

843
00:42:06,417 --> 00:42:07,950
Tell you I have a problem down there?

844

I'm telling you,

845
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:11,990
sitting for long periods
can cause a relapse.

846
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,270
So you need to get up
and walk around once in a while.

847
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:18,350
Oh, does it hurt? Want me to massage it?

848

Mr. Yu,

850
00:42:21,060 --> 00:42:23,270
reimburse the money
I spent on your neighbor.

851
00:42:25,106 --> 00:42:26,660
Didn't I already give you the gift?

852
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:28,220
Why buy her more?

853
00:42:28,700 --> 00:42:30,220
How dare you mention it?

857
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,750
the girl's face was full of contempt.

You're a famous designer.

859
00:42:39,540 --> 00:42:40,700
Why are you so stingy?

860
00:42:40,830 --> 00:42:42,540
Yeah, I felt embarrassed.

861
00:42:42,830 --> 00:42:44,350
I spent money and bought her something.

862
00:42:44,660 --> 00:42:45,620
You don't understand.

863
00:42:46,020 --> 00:42:47,020
It's a first prize.

864
00:42:47,350 --> 00:42:49,180
I gave her my good luck, okay?
