Okay.

Dao! Dao!

32
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:18,990
Dao!

33
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:19,990
Mr. Yu.

34
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,580
Where is Dao?

35
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:22,860
Is that Dao over there?

36
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,390
Mr. Yu!

37
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,510
Dao!

38
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,670
Dao!

39
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
Dao!

40
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,460
How is Dao?

41
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,510
This isn't Dao.

42
00:02:54,100 --> 00:02:55,020
(Do not go into the pond.)

43
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,350
Be careful.

44
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:01,550
Where could Dao be?

45
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:08,180
- Dao!
- Dao!

46
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,020
- Dao!
- Dao!

47
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:15,950
Dao!

48
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,830
Sorry, Dao.

49
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:21,580
I finally found you.

50
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:23,180
Thank you.

51
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,900
Dao is safe and sound.

52
00:03:25,350 --> 00:03:26,350
I should get going.

53
00:03:27,580 --> 00:03:28,620
Stay safe.

54
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,670
Keep warm!

55
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:56,990
Dao, look who's here.

56
00:03:56,990 --> 00:03:57,900
Dao!

57
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,510
Here you go, Xiaoman.

58
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,110
Mommy missed you so much.

59
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:05,700
This little guy is so cute.
And so chubby.

60
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,460
How did you get so fat?

61
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:10,740
Thank you, Jia.

62
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:11,950
No problem.

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,910
By the way,
I need to be honest about something.

64
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,590
I lost Dao

65
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:20,790
a few days ago.

66
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:25,740
Luckily, Mr. Yu helped me find him.

67
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,260
And to save Dao,

68
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,670
he even jumped into a pond.

69
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:30,670
Sorry, Xiaoman.

70
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:33,470
It's fine.

71
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:34,320
You didn't mean to.

72
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,030
And look, he's back now.

73
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:38,230
I just didn't expect it.

74
00:04:38,590 --> 00:04:41,030
I always thought Mr. Yu was
the kind of person

75
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,710
who only cared about himself.

76
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:46,150
But someone who cares about pets

77
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,550
probably knows
how to care about people too.

78
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,420
Right, Dao?

79
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:19,260
Sir, which one do you like?

80
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,470
Mr. Yu,

81
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:47,990
thank you for taking care
of Dao these days.

82
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,070
Dao.

83
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:52,100
Let me carry this.

84
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,230
I got it.

85
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:54,684
I stepped on it, and I'll help you.

86
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,180
After staying
in the hospital for so long,

87
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:07,740
I didn't sell a single car this month.

88
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:09,830
I'm doomed.

89
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,350
I won't hit my KPI.

90
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,710
I can't even afford your dog food.

91
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:22,350
Dao, how about trying rabbit food?

92
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,500
It's cheaper.

93
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,340
No.

94
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,260
Why not?

95
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,710
Nothing. Feed him whatever.

96
00:06:36,420 --> 00:06:40,580
(Yang Wang Dealership)

97
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,300
Why are you eating cafeteria food again?

98
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,160
It's so oily.

99
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,150
You'll gain weight.

100
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:01,550
Because it's free.

101
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:03,030
Are you broke again?

102
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:04,550
Let me show you

103
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,260
my expense log.

104
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,540
(This month's bill. Income
and expenses. Balance: -42.8 yuan.)

105
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,940
Why is your balance negative?

106
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:12,380
Did you not work this month?

107
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,030
I went to the hospital this time.

108
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,670
Mr. Yu paid a lot up front.

109
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:18,150
I have to pay him back.

110
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,550
So, I talked to the manager

111
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:21,740
and got a 3000-yuan advance.

112
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,910
Honestly, our company is pretty humane.

113
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:26,420
They take care of people.

114
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,940
So, you basically have
no income this month.

115
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:31,420
I just need to work harder

116
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:33,030
to sell one car.

117
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,300
As long as I sell one car,

118
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,230
I can rise from the ashes.

119
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,470
That's called making a comeback.

120
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,070
Good luck.

121
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,380
Good luck.

122
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:25,220
What's up?

123
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,580
Um...

124
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,550
Can I borrow some soy sauce?

125
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:29,860
You're that lazy?

126
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,995
Can't you buy some yourself?

127
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:33,590
Well, I was going to buy it.

128
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,990
But my streaming membership

129
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,780
auto-renewed

130
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,350
and deducted 22 yuan.

131
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:41,990
Welcome to the Internet era.

132
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,070
Wait...

133
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:45,620
The soy sauce.

134
00:08:57,595 --> 00:08:59,540
I only have this bottle.
You can borrow it.

135
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:01,500
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

136
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:04,110
I'll pay you back with two bottles.

137
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:05,100
Wait here.

138
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,373
Oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar,
chicken powder, and oyster sauce.

139
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,230
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

140
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:14,350
Don't thank me yet.

141
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:16,110
You said you'd pay me double.

142
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:17,990
This is my investment.

143
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:45,990
Dao.

144
00:09:48,140 --> 00:09:50,260
Can you maybe eat a little less?

145
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,310
You've gotten kind of chubby.

146
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,310
Fine, I'll work harder.

147
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,430
Mr. Yu.

148
00:10:24,710 --> 00:10:25,710
What are you buying?

149
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:27,100
Soy sauce.

150
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,900
Walking the dog so early today?

151
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,470
Yeah, he's been super picky lately.

152
00:10:32,470 --> 00:10:33,710
Either he won't eat,

153
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,110
or he just swallows without chewing.

154
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:36,620
I'm worried he can't digest it.

155
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,110
I figured I'd take him out for a walk.

156
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,190
What were you feeding him before?

157
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,620
My cooking.

158
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:47,260
You know,
you could buy him canned food.

159
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,900
It's pricey.

160
00:10:51,310 --> 00:10:53,500
Poor folks' dogs grow up fast.

161
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,350
I can barely keep my own pot boiling.

162
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,900
I'll buy it for him.

163
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,900
Two boxes enough?

164
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:03,660
But...

165
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:06,710
Canned food is way too expensive.

166
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,500
You're that broke now?

167
00:11:12,190 --> 00:11:13,070
Don't worry.

168
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,110
No matter how broke I get,
we won't starve.

169
00:11:18,110 --> 00:11:20,230
Alright, let's go back and sleep.

170
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,500
Come on.

171
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:24,710
Sleeping early to save electricity?

172
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,740
I'm listening to music tonight.

173
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,830
Go ahead.
I'll sleep with my ears covered.

174
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,830
Saving money starts

175
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:54,900
Saving electricity starts
with sleeping early.

176
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,500

00:13:28,430 --> 00:13:29,270
Go ahead.

188
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:33,590
Do you want to buy a car?

189
00:13:35,620 --> 00:13:36,460
A car?

190
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,010
I picked a studio close to home

191
00:13:42,190 --> 00:13:43,380
because I don't want to drive.

192
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,780
Finding parking is just too annoying.

193
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,380
I actually have a scooter.

194
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,500
But I never ride it.

195
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,740
Wearing a helmet is way too hot.

196
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,540
And it presses on the Yuzhen acupoint.

197
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,540
So...

198
00:13:54,773 --> 00:13:55,860
You don't want to buy one,

199
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,500
right?

200
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,500
Thank you both so much.

201
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,620
A huge weight finally came off my chest.

202
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,990
Our home is in your hands from now on.

203
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,140
Don't worry.

204
00:14:36,140 --> 00:14:38,110
Mr. Yu will definitely give it his all

205
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:40,230
to build the perfect home for you.

206
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,310
I believe you.

207
00:14:42,380 --> 00:14:43,230
Great job.

208
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,430
And thank you for your trust.

209
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,700
Take care.

210
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,220
Take care.

211
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:51,780
The contract is done.

212
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,230
Mission accomplished.

213
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:56,470
It's all thanks to you.

214
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,620
Without you, what would Mr. Yu and I do?

215
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,350
If he could stay silent like today,

216
00:15:01,350 --> 00:15:03,190
he'd be such a quiet, handsome man.

217
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:04,190
Right, Mr. Yu?

218
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:05,030
Do you want a car?

219
00:15:07,017 --> 00:15:08,230
I just changed mine last year.

220
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:10,380
No, your car's outdated.

221
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:12,830
Look, this one's the newest,
trendiest model.

222
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,780
Perfect for someone stylish

223
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,260
and successful like you.

224
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:18,990
Oh, please,
this is called being low-key.

225
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,540
If I drove something that expensive,

226
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,140
people would think I'm taking bribes.

227
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,000
Wu,

228
00:15:23,020 --> 00:15:23,900
you should buy one.

229
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:25,230
The price is fair,

230
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:26,190
great value for money,

231
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:27,830
and zero down payment, all installments.

232
00:15:28,595 --> 00:15:30,500
Xiaoxiao won't let me
borrow from my future.

233
00:15:30,860 --> 00:15:32,190
Plus, I'm too broke to even afford

234
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:33,310
getting a driver's license.

235
00:15:33,310 --> 00:15:34,310
How am I buying a car?

236
00:15:38,217 --> 00:15:39,430
If you want me to buy a car,

237
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:40,950
then raise my base pay.

238
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,830
Or point me toward
a legit way to make money.

239
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:45,830
Take 600 yuan
and buy a kilogram of mercury.

240
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,070
Mercury. You know mercury?

241
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:48,070
I know, then what?

242
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:50,470
Then...

243
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,620
Then you use tweezers

244
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,710
to pluck one proton and one electron
from each mercury atom.

245
00:15:56,710 --> 00:15:59,190
Then, the mercury turns
into 980 grams of gold.

246
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,230
Check the gold price yourself online.

247
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,970
Price of 580 grams...

248
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:08,900
For real?

249
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,720
I can turn 600 yuan
into a few hundred grand?

250
00:16:11,990 --> 00:16:13,110
How do I even pluck them?

251
00:16:35,306 --> 00:16:37,230
You keep checking your watch.
Am I bothering you?

252
00:16:37,380 --> 00:16:38,220
Yeah.

253
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:41,020
You've been sitting here

254
00:16:41,020 --> 00:16:41,900
without saying a word.

255
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,780
What do you want?

256
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,540
It's hard to say.

257
00:16:47,430 --> 00:16:49,110
If you can't say it, write it down.

258
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:06,830
Here.

259
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:10,100
What's this?

260
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:12,430
Is this your dream?

261
00:17:13,017 --> 00:17:14,710
I need to look up some psych references

262
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:16,100
to figure out what this even means.

263
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:18,150
It's not that complicated.

264
00:17:18,390 --> 00:17:19,230
Buying or not?

265
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:21,020
Well, this is drawn pretty well.

266
00:17:21,062 --> 00:17:22,230
I can pay two yuan for it.

267
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,950
I'm asking if you'll buy the car.

268
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:25,990
The car?

269
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:28,950
Look, this is the car, and that's you.

270
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:29,990
Such a perfect match.

271
00:17:30,230 --> 00:17:31,340
Do I look that fat?

272
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,420
Relax.

273
00:17:32,670 --> 00:17:34,020
This car can definitely fit you.

274
00:17:35,300 --> 00:17:36,230
Get lost.

275
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,340
This looks pretty.

276
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:44,340
Full-bodied with a hint of fire,

277
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,190
strength and seduction all in one.

278
00:17:46,540 --> 00:17:47,390
Gorgeous.

279
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:52,580
That description is quite accurate.

280
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:54,670
Look at that paint. Shiny.

281
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:56,870
Those rims, so cool.

282
00:17:57,862 --> 00:17:59,230
What are you even talking about?

283
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:01,990
The Harley, obviously.

284
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,540
It is a nice bike.

285
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:06,910
It was my dad's first Harley.

286
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:08,780
He loved it

287
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,390
like it was his own brother.

288
00:18:11,340 --> 00:18:12,540
I really want one too.

289
00:18:15,260 --> 00:18:16,740
Do you have a photo without you in it?

290
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,470
Look, you're blocking a third of it.

291
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,670
Out!

292
00:18:26,950 --> 00:18:27,790
That car.

293
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,500
Give it some thought.

294
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
Hold on.

295
00:18:36,430 --> 00:18:39,630
Are you helping Xiaoman sell this car?

296
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:43,150
I'm doing it for Dao.

297
00:18:45,740 --> 00:18:47,190
If it's for Dao,

298
00:18:47,670 --> 00:18:48,780
care to make a bet?

299
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,940
What bet?

300
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,740
My dad bought another Harley.

301
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:55,300
He treats it like treasure.

302
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,470
He's out riding every day.

303
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,670
He's not young anymore,

304
00:18:58,950 --> 00:19:01,020
and his riding every day
makes me worried.

305
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,060
If you can convince him
to sell his Harley,

306
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,950
you win.

307
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,910
Beating you is easy.

308
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:07,820
But what do I get?

309
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:09,670
I'll help you sell that car.

310
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:10,830
Deal?

311
00:19:14,870 --> 00:19:15,990
I don't need a car.

312
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:17,710
I have a Harley.

313
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,780
You're not a kid anymore.

314
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:21,430
You're married,

315
00:19:21,430 --> 00:19:23,190
you've got a wife and a family.

316
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,580
A Harley doesn't suit you now.

317
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,390
It makes you look too frivolous.

318
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:28,100
Doesn't match
your stay-at-home-husband vibe.

319
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:30,580
That's called "cute contrast."

320
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,820
Think about it.
You are riding your Harley,

321
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:36,150
taking your wife
to the supermarket to stock up.

322
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:37,030
You're riding up front,

323
00:19:37,062 --> 00:19:38,780
and your wife's holding
onto you in the back.

324
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,260
Where do all the groceries go?

325
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:43,500
Think again.

326
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:47,190
You're taking your wife out
for a countryside ride on the Harley,

327
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,580
but the weather suddenly turns.

328
00:19:48,580 --> 00:19:50,390
Wind, rain, and hail come down on you.

329
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,430
How's your wife supposed to stay dry?

330
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:55,910
My Harley's a single-seater.

331
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:57,740
Doesn't that make it even lonelier?

332
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,710
According to the usage rules
of regulations for applying

333
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,100
for a motorcycle license,

334
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:05,230
people over 70 aren't allowed
to ride heavy motorcycles.

335
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,100
Judging by your face,

336
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,020
you're getting close to that age.

337
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:10,470
So...

338
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:25,300
If I get a car,

339
00:20:26,020 --> 00:20:27,100
what about my Harley?

340
00:20:27,390 --> 00:20:28,540
You can sell it to me.

341
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,170
You...

342
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:35,500
You go home first.

343
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,670
I'll think about it.

344
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,510
Sure thing.

345
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,630
Think it through.

346
00:20:39,440 --> 00:20:40,300
Look carefully too.

347
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:41,230
Yeah.

348
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:03,990
Hello.

349
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,630
Hi, there.

350
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:07,740
Why are you here?

351
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,150
You know this bike?

352
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,260
There are only two kinds
of motorcycles in the world.

353
00:21:13,580 --> 00:21:14,740
Motorcycles

354
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:16,190
and Harleys.

355
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,710
You really know your stuff.

356
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:20,230
Single owner.

357
00:21:20,430 --> 00:21:21,870
Original parts, and original paint.

358
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:23,710
You want to buy it?

359
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:25,830
I have to.

360
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,020
You're not even asking the price?

361
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:32,910
Don't insult me, and don't insult it.

362
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,470
Deal.

363
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,190
To be honest,

364
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:53,340
I'm really reluctant to let it go.

365
00:21:53,630 --> 00:21:54,470
Don't worry.

366
00:21:54,630 --> 00:21:56,060
No one's touching it.

367
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:57,470
You could find a girl

368
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:00,820
who grew up riding
behind her dad on a Harley.

369
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,820
I don't want to.

370
00:22:07,950 --> 00:22:08,790
Honestly,

371
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:12,470
handing my baby over to you

372
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,060
puts my mind at ease.

373
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,580
Alright.

374
00:22:16,617 --> 00:22:18,020
We'll transfer the ownership tomorrow.

375
00:22:18,340 --> 00:22:19,710
What's the rush?

376
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:23,340
You should give it
a proper farewell ceremony at least.

377
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:25,580
That's only right.

378
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,580
As for that car...

379
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:31,820
I'll go test-drive it with you.

380
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:33,100
Sure, sure.

381
00:22:33,580 --> 00:22:37,700
(Harley Helmet)

382
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:53,990
Hello.

383
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,190
Here. Double what I owe you.

384
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:56,740
You have money now?

385
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:57,670
Of course.

386
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,060
I found a side job walking dogs.

387
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:01,060
It's 50 yuan an hour.

388
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,540
Dao needs the walks anyway.

389
00:23:02,820 --> 00:23:03,660
Nice one.

390
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,950
You look like
you're in a great mood today.

391
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:11,100
I went to sell that car for you.

392
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,580
So, how'd it go?

393
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:14,710
Well...

394
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:16,950
I bought a Harley.

395
00:23:16,950 --> 00:23:17,790
Goodnight.

396
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:41,020
I'll go grab the documents first.

397
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,020
What do you think?

398
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:50,180
Well?

399
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:51,820
Hard to say.

400
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,260
Mr. Yu's referral doesn't feel reliable?

401
00:23:54,910 --> 00:23:56,500
It's Dr. Gu's dad.

402
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:57,500
He's fine.

403
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,870
I think I'm the problem.

404
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:00,340
What problem?

405
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,190
Too dumb to sell anything.

406
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:03,470
I still have to push hard later.

407
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,670
True. Good luck.

408
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:09,020
Sir, let me walk you through this car.

409
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:11,190
Young lady, no need.

410
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,340
I'll take it.

411
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,580
Five.

412
00:24:20,710 --> 00:24:21,550
Yes.

413
00:24:22,395 --> 00:24:23,500
I'll go take a look around.

414
00:24:27,373 --> 00:24:29,150
See? You're actually
good at selling cars.

415
00:24:29,500 --> 00:24:30,630
Why are you still so broke?

416
00:24:42,190 --> 00:24:44,710
Five cars!

417
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:49,190
Next month, noodles are on me.

418
00:24:49,710 --> 00:24:52,020
Then, I want the real,
authentic oil-splash noodles.

419
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:52,930
Sure.

420
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:54,430
Order whatever you like.

421
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,940
(Incoming call: Dad)

422
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:01,470
Hey, Dad. What's up?

423
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:03,230
Jia, uh...

424
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:04,430
You're coming this weekend.

425
00:25:04,430 --> 00:25:06,340
For your "farewell Harley" ceremony?

426
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:07,190
Why should I be there?

427
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,390
Think about it.

428
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,500
You grew up riding all kinds of Harleys.

429
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:14,340
If you don't come,
the Harley will get mad.

430
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,470
Seriously?

431
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:17,740
You're not setting me up
on another blind date, are you?

432
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:18,670
No, no.

433
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,870
Absolutely not.

434
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,430
Just come.

435
00:25:21,580 --> 00:25:22,420
Fine.

436
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,870
I smell trouble.

437
00:25:28,630 --> 00:25:29,870
Xiaoman, come with me.

438
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,780
And you decided to drag me into it?

439
00:25:32,910 --> 00:25:33,750
Sure.

440
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,060
What scheme could my dad even have?

441
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:38,470
Worst case,
he lined up a few blind dates.

442
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:39,710
You can check them out too.

443
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:41,060
And it's outdoors.

444
00:25:41,060 --> 00:25:42,173
Probably looks pretty nice.

445
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,070
Treat it like a trip.

446
00:25:43,630 --> 00:25:44,470
Come on.

447
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:46,020
Alright.

448
00:25:47,230 --> 00:25:51,060
He counts as a big client of mine too.

449
00:25:52,150 --> 00:25:55,260
I can't let this whale slip away.

450
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,580
(Why is Mr. Yu coming too?)

451
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:09,630
You're not happy to see me?

452
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:15,580
You saw me from that far?

453
00:26:16,150 --> 00:26:16,990
I guessed.

454
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:22,990
Mr. Yu, if it weren't for your referral,

455
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:25,230
I wouldn't have such a big client.

456
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:28,780
You're a lifesaver for me and Dao.

457
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,060
Of course you're welcome.

458
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:31,230
I was just curious.

459
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,580
He's here because

460
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:35,300
he bought my dad's Harley.

461
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:36,870
You really bought it?

462
00:26:37,670 --> 00:26:39,580
Sure, the idea was hers.

463
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,100
But, it was my talking skills
that convinced her dad.

464
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:44,470
Amazing.

465
00:26:44,490 --> 00:26:45,340
I always felt

466
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:48,630
he was the type
with zero athletic ability.

467
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,260
A man stays a boy till he dies.

468
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:53,990
However, I didn't expect you
to have a motorcycle license.

469
00:26:54,910 --> 00:26:56,390
Back when I was in college in Tianjin,

470
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,740
I got a full scholarship.

471
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,740
Seven years straight.

472
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:01,390
What does that have to do
with your motor skills?

473
00:27:01,780 --> 00:27:02,780
And then?

474
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,060
Then, I bought a Vespa.

475
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:08,230
The same one Hepburn
rode in "Roman Holiday".

476
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,190
Such a romantic movie,

477
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:13,430
and he finishes it and buys a scooter.

478
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,390
A stereotypical guy indeed.

479
00:27:17,710 --> 00:27:19,540
I bought it
because I like Hepburn, okay?

480
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,540
Wow, you can even like women?

481
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:24,230
I'm a film buff.

482
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,190
A film buff, you know?

483
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:26,390
I like Vivien Leigh too.

484
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:29,230
Shouldn't you be into Schwarzenegger?

485
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,950
Shut it.

486
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,470
Look up front.

487
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:50,470
That engine roar is music to my ears.

488
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,230
Let's head out.

489
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:53,070
Okay.

490
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:54,860
(Reverse and U-turn)

491
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:00,900
Welcome.

492
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:03,660
Come.

493
00:29:03,910 --> 00:29:05,060
Let me do the introductions.

494
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,780
That one's the eldest.

495
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,020
He's number two.

496
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,740
This is the third brother.

497
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:17,630
I'm the fourth.

498
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,190
This is the fifth brother.

499
00:29:21,630 --> 00:29:22,630
This is Yu Yu.

500
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:25,820
They don't have actual names?

501
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:29,500
Once you hang around enough,
you'll figure them out.

502
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:34,060
Dad, you go bond with them first.

503
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,910
I'll take Xiaoman over there.

504
00:29:43,580 --> 00:29:45,630
Eldest Brother, you handle it.

505
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:32,100
How did Mr. Yu get thrown off?

506
00:30:32,430 --> 00:30:33,870
This is their initiation ritual.

507
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:35,870
I told my dad

508
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:37,340
Mr. Yu was delicate.

509
00:30:37,340 --> 00:30:38,630
They should know what to do.

510
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:25,500
♪Should old acquaintance be forgot♪

511
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:32,190
♪And never brought to mind?♪

512
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:38,470
♪Should old acquaintance be forgot♪

513
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:44,260
♪In the days of auld lang syne?♪

514
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:51,560
♪For auld lang syne, my dear♪

515
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:57,910
♪For auld lang syne♪

516
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:03,820
♪We'll drink a cup of kindness yet♪

517
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,780
♪For the sake of auld lang syne♪

518
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:23,950
Five cars.

519
00:34:25,270 --> 00:34:27,910
I sold five cars.

520
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,700
Up this early?

521
00:34:50,684 --> 00:34:51,950
You're awake this early too.

522
00:34:52,660 --> 00:34:55,180
Did Xia Xiaoman's teeth grinding
keep you up last night?

523
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,830
I barely slept.

524
00:34:57,830 --> 00:35:00,060
I've been having trouble sleeping.

525
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,100
This place is really beautiful.

526
00:35:13,951 --> 00:35:15,462
How about we watch the sunrise?

527
00:35:18,470 --> 00:35:19,310
Sure.

528
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,620
I haven't felt like this in ages.

529
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,990
It feels pretty nice.

530
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,150
Is that so?

531
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:30,750
I think it feels pretty nice too.

532
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,990
I've definitely seen
more sunrises than you.

533
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:46,660
I sometimes see them
when I get off night shifts.

534
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:50,100
And when I can't sleep,
I see them pretty often too.

535
00:35:52,430 --> 00:35:53,700
Why are you always losing sleep?

536
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:54,910
Nothing serious.

537
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:57,390
Probably just work stress,

538
00:35:57,390 --> 00:36:00,310
plus all the night shifts.

539
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,310
That's autonomic nervous dysfunction.

540
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:04,950
Your biological clock's off.

541
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,350
You're not a doctor.
Stop diagnosing me.

542
00:36:08,180 --> 00:36:09,270
Who says I'm not qualified?

543
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:12,430
I've got tons of quick ways
to fall asleep.

544
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:15,140
Yeah? Like what?

545
00:36:15,660 --> 00:36:16,500
Counting sheep.

546
00:36:16,830 --> 00:36:18,500
I thought you had something impressive.

547
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,500
I counted over 8,000 sheep once.

548
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,500
My mouth got so dry.

549
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,270
I drank a huge glass of water,

550
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:27,160
and spent the whole night
running to the bathroom.

551
00:36:28,180 --> 00:36:29,470
Who told you to count out loud?

552
00:36:29,700 --> 00:36:30,870
You count in your head.

553
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:34,350
And picture the little sheep hopping.

554
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,660
Next.

555
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,660
Drink a glass of milk before bed,

556
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:40,750
and eat a banana.

557
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:42,990
Helps your brain make serotonin.

558
00:36:43,660 --> 00:36:45,910
Serotonin can help you
fall asleep quickly.

559
00:36:46,750 --> 00:36:47,750
Number three,

560
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,990
take a college-level calculus exam,

561
00:36:50,350 --> 00:36:52,620
and tell yourself you must
finish it carefully.

562
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:54,390
Number 21

563
00:36:54,830 --> 00:36:56,020
is super important.

564
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:58,700
Sleep away from your phone.

565
00:36:59,310 --> 00:37:00,390
(Number 66,)

566
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,700
(make one eyeball draw circles,)

567
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,100
(and the other draw squares.)

568
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:07,580
(Train your eyes to "fight each other.")

569
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,270
(Your brain glitches,
and you fall asleep.)

570
00:37:22,310 --> 00:37:25,220
Number 149, white noise.

571
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:27,700
Just listen to any sound.

572
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:30,430
It can be wind, rain, or people talking.

573
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:33,700
As long as it's boring enough,

574
00:37:34,350 --> 00:37:35,660
you'll fall asleep fast.

575
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:58,960
♪May your sleep be pure and sweet♪

576
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:03,110
♪Whether alone or side by side♪

577
00:38:03,430 --> 00:38:06,250
♪Midnight feels different
with you there♪

578
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:11,440
♪Raising a glass together♪

579
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:15,950
♪Even the moon shines brighter♪

580
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:20,990
♪Asleep or awake,
it's all beautiful with you♪

581
00:38:22,540 --> 00:38:23,380
What...

582
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,020
What...

583
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,790
What's wrong?

584
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,390
We were watching the sunrise.

585
00:38:29,910 --> 00:38:31,060
And it's already over?

586
00:38:31,790 --> 00:38:32,630
You fell asleep.

587
00:38:33,350 --> 00:38:34,830
I got it on the phone for you.

588
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:36,660
I'll send it to you.

589
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,430
My arm's kinda numb.

590
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:43,620
I need to stretch a bit.

591
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,620
I'll send you the video.

592
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:56,910
Are these bikes going straight
to the motorcycle museum?

593
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:00,470
A friend of mine runs it.

594
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:03,220
Pretty good retirement for them.

595
00:39:05,373 --> 00:39:07,270
From now on,
if we want to have fun with bikes,

596
00:39:07,751 --> 00:39:09,540
we'll have to look for you,
Sixth Brother.

597
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:10,830
What Sixth Brother?

598
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,020
You're a member of Steppenwolf now.

599
00:39:15,870 --> 00:39:16,870
So much trouble...

600
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:28,750
Fourth Brother.

601
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:32,750
Sixth Brother.

602
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:36,830
Good boy, Sixth Brother.

603
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:41,340
(And just like that,)

604
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:43,140
(I got my own Harley.)

605
00:39:44,350 --> 00:39:45,500
(I vaguely felt)

606
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,660
(I'd taken on some kind of burden,)

607
00:39:48,062 --> 00:39:49,750
(but I haven't figured out what it is.)

608
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:53,390
(Maybe it was the rising sun,)

609
00:39:53,870 --> 00:39:54,990
(warm)

610
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:56,540
(but a little blinding.)

611
00:40:03,262 --> 00:40:04,390
(It's a beautiful sunrise,)

612
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:05,540
(and you fell asleep.)

613
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:07,020
(You should've woken me up.)

614
00:40:09,470 --> 00:40:10,950
(Judging by your breathing rate,)

615
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,310
(you were in deep sleep.)

616
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:15,270
(You really needed the rest.)

617
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,540
(Thanks.)

618
00:40:21,910 --> 00:40:24,950
(I haven't slept
that peacefully in a long time.)

619
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,390
(You really should thank me.)

620
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:28,660
(Half my body went numb.)

621
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,350
(You should start working out.)

622
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:36,220
(I'll figure it all out eventually.)

623
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:45,310
Thanks.

624
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:48,270
Thank you
to all the owners for choosing us.

625
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:51,540
Our cars will never disgrace
the Steppenwolf's name.

626
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:53,870
Thank you!

627
00:40:56,060 --> 00:40:57,790
You only sold five cars.

628
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:58,950
Is it worth being this happy?

629
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,660
Look at that smug face of yours.

630
00:41:01,660 --> 00:41:03,660
Straight-up vicious concubine energy.

631
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:06,430
Now, you can go on trips without worry.

632
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:10,020
The best part?
Your wife won't nag you anymore.

633
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,060
I'm not scared of her.

634
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:14,220
Then, why buy the car?

635
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,060
Exactly.

636
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,540
It's safe and comfortable.

637
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,430
Most importantly, there's a roof

638
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,220
over your head on rainy days.

639
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:26,750
Come on, let's take a photo.

640
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:27,590
This way.

641
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:40,060
Wow.

642
00:41:42,990 --> 00:41:45,020
Mr. Yu, this looks incredibly cool.

643
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,500
Let me ride it for a bit.

644
00:41:50,270 --> 00:41:51,110
In your dreams.

645
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,580
Can you let me be the Seventh Brother?

646
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:54,928
Not even the Eighth Brother.

647
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:56,540
You're stingy.

648
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,540
Mr. Yu,

649
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,350
is this Vespa yours?

650
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,540
I have never seen you ride it.

651
00:42:02,470 --> 00:42:04,990
You can think of it
as a decorative piece.

652
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:07,910
You know how many people have
limited-edition collectibles at home,

653
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:08,950
but never use them.

654
00:42:09,350 --> 00:42:10,270
Oh.

655
00:42:10,395 --> 00:42:11,620
Then now it has a companion.

656
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:12,580
It must be very happy.

657
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:19,230
Mr. Yu,

658
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:21,950
your little scooter now has company,

659
00:42:21,951 --> 00:42:23,020
but you are still alone.

660
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:25,870
You must be feeling extremely lonely.

661
00:42:26,020 --> 00:42:26,860
Oh?

662
00:42:26,906 --> 00:42:29,220
So after this little Vespa
and little Harley get together,

663
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:30,220
what should the surname be?

664
00:42:30,660 --> 00:42:32,270
Should it be called Har-Ves or Ves-Har?

665
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,230
Get off.

666
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:35,910
Fine. Come on.

667
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:41,830
This is way too cool.

668
00:42:41,830 --> 00:42:42,670
I know.

669
00:42:44,500 --> 00:42:45,340
Yes.

670
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
=Why Is He Still Single=
