I won't come either.

186
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:51,110
♪How can it compare to the
green gauze rising over sorghum fields?♪

187
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:55,500
Looks like it's not about the dates.

188
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,190
Hey, Ms. Lin.

189
00:10:06,590 --> 00:10:07,470
Dr. Gu.

190
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:09,540
Have you seen Mr. Yu
these past two days?

191
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:10,910
No.

192
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,380
Okay, got it, thanks.

193
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:17,070
Dr. Gu also has no idea where he went.

194
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,110
Xiaoman and Qing said
they haven't seen him either,

195
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,140
and there was no activity
next door last night.

196
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:26,190
What exactly happened to him?

197
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:28,351
He used 200,000 yuan contingency fund.

198
00:10:28,460 --> 00:10:30,151
We've worked together for so many years.

199
00:10:30,173 --> 00:10:31,640
This is the first time he's done this.

200
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,830
Wait...

201
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,990
Do you think Mr. Yu got kidnapped?

202
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:37,380
Who would buy him?

203
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,173
What if they cut out a kidney
or something?

204
00:10:39,195 --> 00:10:40,380
With his old kidney,

205
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,230
forget it.

206
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,140
He's just kind-hearted.

207
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,110
It's possible

208
00:10:43,110 --> 00:10:44,020
that he got scammed.

209
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,310
True.

210
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:47,740
These days, there are
so many scammers online.

211
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:51,020
They appear in these high-end
matchmaking events.

212
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,500
Stop joking, okay?

213
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,620
So annoying.

214
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,710
You two behave.

215
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,420
(Mr. Sun)

216
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:08,100
Hey, Sun.

217
00:11:08,551 --> 00:11:10,860
Where were you just now?
Why didn't you answer the phone?

218
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:11,700
Ms. Lin.

219
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,710
You've got to side with me this time.

220
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,190
That Yu guy keeps harassing me,

221
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,260
being so unreasonable with me.

222
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:19,100
Mr. Yu?

223
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:20,350
Did he come to see you?

224
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,190
Yes.

225
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:25,230
He asked me to drop what I was doing
and go with him to another site.

226
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:28,110
- If I refuse, he just messes with me.
- Alright, stop saying useless things.

227
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:29,280
Where is he? Tell me quickly.

228
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:31,740
(Yangpu Bridge)
This place is so far.

229
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,500
It'll take me over two hours
to drive here.

230
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Mr. Yu!

231
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
Mr. Yu!

232
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,980
Mr. Yu!

233
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,500
Hey.

234
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,020
What's this...

235
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:33,140
Long time no see.

236
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,380
Sorry, everyone, I might

237
00:12:38,551 --> 00:12:40,590
not be able to take
your photo shoots recently.

238
00:12:43,906 --> 00:12:45,350
You came looking for Mr. Yu, right?

239
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,540
- Yes.
- Yes.

240
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:47,380
He...

241
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,190
We've been looking for you for days.

242
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,950
You don't answer calls or messages.

243
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,910
Sorry.

244
00:13:00,190 --> 00:13:02,230
I've been occupying Mr. Yu lately.

245
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,110
He's been helping me.

246
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:11,020
I've already designed your new home.

247
00:13:12,380 --> 00:13:13,220
Look.

248
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:15,430
I added handrails to all the walls,

249
00:13:15,990 --> 00:13:17,540
so you can walk while holding on.

250
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:18,990
Also,

251
00:13:18,990 --> 00:13:21,110
I've made all the floors cushioned,

252
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:23,780
so if you fall by accident,
it won't hurt.

253
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:25,740
Don't remove it when you get better.

254
00:13:25,773 --> 00:13:27,706
Because it makes walking
more comfortable.

255
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:28,600
Okay.

256
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,710
Look at this.

257
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:32,380
I lowered all the furniture,

258
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,710
so it's easier for you to use
in a wheelchair.

259
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,950
I'll raise them again when you recover.

260
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,470
This is the most important. Look.

261
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:42,500
This is a gift for you.

262
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,790
This is...

263
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,190
A telescope.

264
00:13:48,140 --> 00:13:50,140
It can see scenery ten kilometers away,

265
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,950
so even without leaving home,

266
00:13:52,195 --> 00:13:54,140
you can still see the beauty
of the world.

267
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,500
Do you like it?

268
00:13:57,380 --> 00:13:58,590
Yes, I like it.

269
00:13:59,740 --> 00:14:01,620
I'll move it to you when the house
is ready.

270
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,500
Thank you, Master Yu.

271
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:08,830
I'm very satisfied with this new home.

272
00:14:18,528 --> 00:14:20,417
Don't be afraid of the surgery.

273
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,270
Okay.

274
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:31,830
Well...

275
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:38,030
I should be able to stand again, right?

276
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,860
Right.

277
00:14:41,140 --> 00:14:42,070
You definitely can.

278
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:58,940
(Lab report)

279
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:01,740
She likely has a lesion
in the motor cortex,

280
00:15:01,773 --> 00:15:03,310
plus compression of the pyramidal tract.

281
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,990
Although before surgery,

282
00:15:04,990 --> 00:15:07,540
her lower limb strength had declined,

283
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,590
it should get better.

284
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,860
Are you sure?

285
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:14,528
I checked online,
and it seems quite serious.

286
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:16,190
I'm a doctor.

287
00:15:16,884 --> 00:15:18,900
But you're not a specialist
in this field.

288
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:21,030
Then why are you asking me?
Go check online yourself.

289
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
Because I care about her.

290
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,990
I can tell you care.

291
00:15:28,540 --> 00:15:29,660
You almost went to extremes.

292
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,190
What extremes?

293
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:32,740
I'm not dating her.

294
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:34,020
But isn't that dating?

295
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:35,706
You disappeared completely.

296
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,900
And they said, for this matter,

297
00:15:38,951 --> 00:15:40,773
you borrowed 200,000 yuan
from the company.

298
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,020
If it's not for dating,

299
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:43,350
why are you so nice

300
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:44,620
to a stranger?

301
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:47,660
I didn't borrow it for her.

302
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,373
It was an advance for the renovation.

303
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:51,030
It's like this.

304
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:53,173
She promised to do a photo shoot for me,

305
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:55,620
and I'd help her renovate a house.

306
00:15:55,950 --> 00:15:57,860
That's it. A fair exchange.

307
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:01,900
Then why did you disappear?

308
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:07,020
Because I promised to help her
hide her condition.

309
00:16:08,106 --> 00:16:09,350
Because I sympathize with her.

310
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:13,190
But strong people

311
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,860
often see sympathy as an insult.

312
00:16:16,260 --> 00:16:17,660
Then why tell me?

313
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,830
Because I'm a doctor?

314
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,140
It's not about the job.

315
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:23,860
Even if you were a chef, I'd tell you.

316
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:26,540
Why?

317
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:35,620
No reason.

318
00:16:36,306 --> 00:16:37,380
I just wanted to tell you.

319
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:40,660
If you insist on a reason,

320
00:16:41,062 --> 00:16:42,995
it's because I'm afraid
you'd misunderstand.

321
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,310
If you misunderstood, you'd get angry.

322
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:48,190
And I wouldn't know why you're angry.

323
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:49,310
I'd have to guess.

324
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,150
Stop.

325
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:52,590
Why say so much?

326
00:16:53,070 --> 00:16:55,310
I didn't ask for an explanation.
So annoying.

327
00:16:59,020 --> 00:17:00,780
So, do you have a misunderstanding?

328
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:04,860
No.

329
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:10,190
I'm off work now.

330
00:17:11,973 --> 00:17:13,820
I still haven't finished saying
what I wanted.

331
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:27,060
So Dragon's 18 Techniques
actually has 18 more.

332
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,780
In total, there are 36 moves.

333
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,150
You called me here

334
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,430
just to say this?

335
00:17:42,430 --> 00:17:45,500
I heard you went on a blind date
with Ximen again.

336
00:17:46,573 --> 00:17:47,773
That man isn't right for you.

337
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:52,670
Why isn't he right for me?

338
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:56,100
According to blind date logic,

339
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:57,990
he'll show you his best side.

340
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,740
But he's convinced you'll like
his teapot tricks.

341
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,500
But he's not good at them,

342
00:18:03,190 --> 00:18:05,710
which shows he's childish
and narcissistic.

343
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:09,030
Is that so?

344
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,740
I think he's quite cute.

345
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:12,862
Cute? What's cute about that?

346
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:15,340
You're looking for a husband, not a son.

347
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,180
Why so cute then?

348
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,580
And after you marry,

349
00:18:17,906 --> 00:18:19,810
he'll force you to wash teapots
every day.

350
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:20,906
Listen, I'm telling you.

351
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,150
The teapot spout is three
and a half feet long.

352
00:18:23,217 --> 00:18:24,710
And you don't like housework, right?

353
00:18:24,710 --> 00:18:25,550
Stop.

354
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,884
What exactly do you want to tell me?

355
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:32,990
Nothing.

356
00:18:35,190 --> 00:18:37,430
You're not jealous, are you?

357
00:18:37,630 --> 00:18:38,910
Who's jealous of you?

358
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,300
Hey, I'm your sixth uncle.

359
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
I can't let my eldest niece
act recklessly.

360
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,740
Who's your eldest niece?

361
00:18:47,430 --> 00:18:50,740
Fine, let me show you the photos
I took of my eldest niece.

362
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,140
Let me take a look.

363
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,230
What are you doing?

364
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,270
I took these.

365
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,740
You took photos of me.

366
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,020
But I took them.

367
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,060
But they're of me.

368
00:19:04,060 --> 00:19:04,900
So what if it's you?

369
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,150
Hey, stop that.

370
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,030
Don't touch.

371
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,310
I'll do it myself.

372
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:16,620
It's all dirty now.

373
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,870
These are the ones you took that day?

374
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,630
Yes, I washed them myself.

375
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,190
You washed them yourself?

376
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,728
How else could they look so good?

377
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,620
Do they look good?

378
00:19:33,540 --> 00:19:34,380
Yes, they do.

379
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:37,620
Look at the lighting.

380
00:19:37,950 --> 00:19:38,790
The composition.

381
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,380
So beautiful.

382
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:44,300
The photos are pretty good.

383
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,100
At least quite clear.

384
00:19:48,340 --> 00:19:49,190
My hands are steady.

385
00:19:49,820 --> 00:19:50,660
And also,

386
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:52,500
your face is big, easy to focus on.

387
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,340
Confiscated.

388
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:57,180
Give them back.

389
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,340
I've decided.

390
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,060
Ximen really isn't right for me.

391
00:20:50,470 --> 00:20:52,190
What are you doing? What?

392
00:20:54,740 --> 00:20:56,990
Don't play with other people's socks,
got it?

393
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:03,900
Come back.

394
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:07,860
Dao.

395
00:21:10,710 --> 00:21:11,870
You really are...

396
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:24,340
(Strong wash)

397
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:26,710
Yesterday, I just searched
for wedding items on my phone,

398
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,300
and today, my phone is full
of wedding ads.

399
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:30,820
Be satisfied, Mr. Yu.

400
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,060
You're so festive.

401
00:21:32,740 --> 00:21:33,580
You know what?

402
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:35,820
Once I sent Xiaoxiao a message saying,

403
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:36,820
I'm dying of laughter.

404
00:21:37,150 --> 00:21:40,470
Next day, it recommended
a 40,000+ yuan urn.

405
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,580
They really value me.

406
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,500
Big data has no privacy.

407
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:46,710
I really should use an MG42

408
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:48,430
and spray a few rounds at them.

409
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:55,020
Trouble again.

410
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:58,060
They don't like your revised plan.

411
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:00,540
What, they have no sense of aesthetics?

412
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,870
It's you sloppily messing around.

413
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:04,540
Fine, then don't let them
add 500,000 yuan.

414
00:22:04,617 --> 00:22:05,780
Stick to the original design.

415
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,740
Hey, aren't you just sulking?

416
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:09,910
If you act like this,
they won't let you do it.

417
00:22:10,710 --> 00:22:11,550
Fine.

418
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:13,260
Mr. Yu.

419
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:14,820
Can you be reasonable?

420
00:22:16,630 --> 00:22:17,780
How am I being unreasonable?

421
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,190
That was supposed to be a week's work,

422
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,910
but you finished it in one day.

423
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,860
What do you know?

424
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,550
For me,

425
00:22:27,670 --> 00:22:29,150
one day and one week are the same.

426
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,620
And you...

427
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:32,310
What's wrong?

428
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:38,100
(X-ray report)
Fungal upper respiratory infection.

429
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,870
That's quite rare.

430
00:22:40,820 --> 00:22:43,060
Mr. Yu, what did you just smell?

431
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,510
Socks.

432
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,140
Socks?

433
00:22:46,780 --> 00:22:47,710
Whose socks?

434
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,100
Your socks are that dirty?

435
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,500
How many days have you worn them?

436
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:55,340
I really didn't expect you
to be so sloppy.

437
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:56,300
What's the saying?

438
00:22:56,430 --> 00:22:57,870
All that glitters is not gold.

439
00:22:57,870 --> 00:22:59,340
Looks good on the outside.

440
00:22:59,500 --> 00:23:00,950
Embroidered pillow.

441
00:23:01,060 --> 00:23:02,540
What other words describe this?

442
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:06,540
Ultimately,

443
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:09,340
it's because you haven't been
taking care of your body.

444
00:23:09,340 --> 00:23:10,870
So your immunity is low.

445
00:23:10,870 --> 00:23:12,740
That's why you get infections so easily.

446
00:23:16,506 --> 00:23:19,190
Didn't you say no matter how busy
you are, you clean the house?

447
00:23:19,351 --> 00:23:21,340
Then why are there still dirty things
in your home?

448
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:22,670
Think carefully again.

449
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,020
Are there any other dirty things
at home?

450
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:27,630
You can't talk,

451
00:23:27,630 --> 00:23:28,740
and that's great.

452
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:32,300
Looks like my wish really worked.

453
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:39,430
What? I can't hear you.

454
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,020
Good for you, Mr. Yu.

455
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:47,580
You fainted just from smelling a sock.

456
00:23:47,870 --> 00:23:48,910
You're so delicate.

457
00:23:49,573 --> 00:23:50,830
How dirty was that sock?

458
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:52,195
Be more diligent in the future.

459
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:53,790
Wash more, and don't sniff those socks.

460
00:23:55,910 --> 00:23:56,990
Alright, got it.

461
00:23:57,260 --> 00:23:59,580
Small illnesses often,
big illnesses none, right?

462
00:24:02,528 --> 00:24:04,217
You need to revise the design.

463
00:24:10,670 --> 00:24:12,630
Did he just speak?

464
00:24:14,500 --> 00:24:15,470
Yes, just now.

465
00:24:17,470 --> 00:24:18,310
Oh.

466
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:21,300
But Dr. Gu said

467
00:24:21,328 --> 00:24:23,060
you usually don't take care
of your health.

468
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:24,260
Immunity is low.

469
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:26,640
If you want to revise the design,

470
00:24:26,662 --> 00:24:27,750
how are you going to do it?

471
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,990
Yeah, with your current condition,
it's impossible.

472
00:24:37,950 --> 00:24:39,340
You want me to take over the design?

473
00:24:42,500 --> 00:24:43,390
I...

474
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,230
He...

475
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,660
He can't do it, right?

476
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:52,260
No, Mr. Yu.

477
00:24:52,870 --> 00:24:55,060
I know this is a project
under your own studio.

478
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,609
You don't want others interfering.

479
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:57,580
But now the problem is...

480
00:25:02,430 --> 00:25:05,150
Ms. Lin, I think I can do it again.

481
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:06,150
Let me try.

482
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,140
What?

483
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:12,310
Mr. Yu said I can do it.

484
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,230
I...

485
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,390
I just want to know...

486
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:23,910
How did you understand

487
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,740
the meaning of what he said?

488
00:25:27,528 --> 00:25:28,580
Don't worry about it.

489
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,710
Mr. Yu said the same.

490
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:42,060
Thirsty? I'll get you some water.

491
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:47,340
Hey.

492
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:50,710
Cough a bit.

493
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:52,540
I'll see if I can understand.

494
00:25:57,395 --> 00:25:58,580
Need to use the bathroom?

495
00:25:59,100 --> 00:26:00,190
Oh, quick.

496
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,300
Mr. Yu, do you think...

497
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,140
Stop spinning.

498
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:52,020
Out of inspiration, right?

499
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:53,750
Yeah.

500
00:26:54,195 --> 00:26:55,430
Now you know how I usually...

501
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,100
Alright, stop.

502
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,780
I know you're usually amazing, okay?

503
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,230
Come, I'll tell you a secret.

504
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:08,020
The Earth we're on now

505
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,300
rotates by itself.

506
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:10,780
But it also revolves around the Sun.

507
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,780
But we humans

508
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:12,870
always think that we

509
00:27:12,870 --> 00:27:14,430
can control time,

510
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,950
and want to use a time machine
to go back or forward.

511
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:17,870
But actually, in terms

512
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:20,580
of the dimension of time

513
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,780
and the vastness of space,

514
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,620
we humans

515
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:24,260
cannot really predict

516
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,100
or control it.

517
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,310
Perfectly said.

518
00:27:33,710 --> 00:27:35,630
You just talked to me for ten minutes

519
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:36,940
about the universe.

520
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:39,510
Yes.

521
00:27:40,951 --> 00:27:42,630
What exactly are you trying to tell me?

522
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:44,340
I'm off work already.

523
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,710
Recently, I've been doing design work.

524
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:51,662
I have no inspiration.

525
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:53,260
Mr. Yu said I could come find you.

526
00:27:54,390 --> 00:27:55,230
Ah?

527
00:27:55,710 --> 00:27:56,630
Find me?

528
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,262
How am I supposed
to give you inspiration?

529
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:00,910
Before, Mr. Yu said

530
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,217
whenever he was extremely frustrated,
he'd come to you.

531
00:28:03,217 --> 00:28:04,230
Every single time,

532
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:05,670
he'd come in dazed

533
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,950
and leave with a clear mind.

534
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:12,380
Well...

535
00:28:12,417 --> 00:28:14,130
Maybe you're the only one
who can heal him.

536
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,260
As long as the mind doesn't falter,

537
00:28:21,390 --> 00:28:23,395
there are always more solutions
than problems.

538
00:28:24,230 --> 00:28:26,500
What you just said
is the same as Mr. Yu.

539
00:28:26,773 --> 00:28:27,990
I won't bother you then.

540
00:28:27,990 --> 00:28:29,430
I'll head back first. Thanks, Dr. Gu.

541
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:30,306
Sure, no problem.

542
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,780
Is this your new photo shoot?

543
00:28:34,150 --> 00:28:34,990
Yes.

544
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:35,870
Can I take a look?

545
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,420
Sure.

546
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,430
This one is beautiful.

547
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:41,510
Thank you.

548
00:28:42,284 --> 00:28:43,580
Is this one when you're angry?

549
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,150
Why are you pointing
at the photographer?

550
00:28:45,151 --> 00:28:46,528
He said my face is big for focusing.

551
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,630
Well, he was spot on.

552
00:28:53,617 --> 00:28:55,300
Really well shot. Really beautiful.

553
00:28:55,328 --> 00:28:56,390
You should get off.

554
00:28:56,390 --> 00:28:57,530
I'll leave first. Bye.

555
00:28:57,540 --> 00:28:58,670
See you next time. Bye.

556
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:01,910
Seems like his Mr. Yu.

557
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:06,470
Eat more.

558
00:29:08,710 --> 00:29:10,100
No good deed goes unpunished.

559
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:11,710
If not a villain, a thief.

560
00:29:12,230 --> 00:29:14,190
I'm just happy for you, okay?

561
00:29:14,630 --> 00:29:16,870
Happy that you've finally
started independent design.

562
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:19,340
Taking the first step to becoming
a designer.

563
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,670
Ms. Lin told you, right?

564
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:22,710
Yes.

565
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,020
Of course, I'm happy.

566
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:27,100
But recently,

567
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:28,300
I've been a bit lost.

568
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,190
Before, when complaining about Mr. Yu,

569
00:29:31,190 --> 00:29:32,540
I could complain endlessly.

570
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:35,020
But when I actually start myself,

571
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:37,470
I realize it's not that simple.

572
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,180
Don't be discouraged.

573
00:29:39,500 --> 00:29:40,630
You are the best.

574
00:29:40,973 --> 00:29:42,395
Stop saying such insincere things.

575
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:43,780
How is it insincere?

576
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:46,470
Right now,

577
00:29:46,484 --> 00:29:47,710
you need some encouragement.

578
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:53,230
Sit.

579
00:29:53,710 --> 00:29:55,100
Look, covered in oil.

580
00:29:58,870 --> 00:29:59,710
Eat quickly.

581
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:05,860
Wait...

582
00:30:06,084 --> 00:30:07,540
Hey, let me tell you something.

583
00:30:08,470 --> 00:30:09,470
I feel...

584
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:11,870
Ms. Lin has been acting
strange recently.

585
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:13,990
Always secretive.

586
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:34,790
Ms. Lin.

587
00:30:35,417 --> 00:30:36,973
Have you made up your mind?

588
00:30:38,340 --> 00:30:39,180
Change city.

589
00:30:39,580 --> 00:30:40,420
Change mood.

590
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:41,660
Change

591
00:30:42,020 --> 00:30:43,340
to a more promising job.

592
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,710
Go to sleep.

593
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,580
Stop scaring me.

594
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:25,950
Don't stay up.

595
00:31:25,950 --> 00:31:26,790
Go to bed.

596
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,580
The deadline is in a couple of days.

597
00:31:29,862 --> 00:31:31,928
If you don't submit,
Lin Sa won't kill you.

598
00:31:33,230 --> 00:31:35,780
Meeting deadlines is a designer's duty.

599
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,900
Nonsense.

600
00:31:37,020 --> 00:31:38,390
You taught me that.

601
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:18,910
Coffee's here, Ms. Lin.

602
00:32:19,395 --> 00:32:20,928
You're rushing me for a meeting, right?

603
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:21,790
Meeting?

604
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:23,300
The meeting is tomorrow.

605
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,260
Meeting a client now.

606
00:32:24,390 --> 00:32:25,470
Which client?

607
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:29,780
They want to fix a swimming pool
in the house.

608
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:31,951
You're telling me
this is because they're bored.

609
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:45,580
Xiaoxiao.

610
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,500
Do you want to go develop
in another city?

611
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:49,860
Where?

612
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,710
Beijing.

613
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:51,550
No.

614
00:32:52,150 --> 00:32:52,990
Why not?

615
00:32:54,580 --> 00:32:56,190
Wu is in Shanghai.

616
00:32:56,190 --> 00:32:57,262
Why would I go to Beijing?

617
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,870
What if it's a Fortune 500 company?

618
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:03,470
And the salary triples?

619
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:05,230
Even if it triples, I still wouldn't go.

620
00:33:07,580 --> 00:33:08,630
I'm not like you.

621
00:33:09,430 --> 00:33:11,950
You have the capital
to pursue a career and a future.

622
00:33:12,230 --> 00:33:14,870
Me? The only thing I can hold onto
is my loved one.

623
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:21,990
As a woman,

624
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,340
you shouldn't just seek love.

625
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,190
You need to work hard.

626
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:29,910
Facing reality is actually
a woman's strength.

627
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:31,260
Men are the ones

628
00:33:31,470 --> 00:33:33,740
who are clueless
and full of fantasies, fools.

629
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:43,430
If I were to go,

630
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:45,150
would you go with me?

631
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:50,780
Of course, I'd want to work with you.

632
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,910
But I have Wu.

633
00:33:57,780 --> 00:33:59,580
Suddenly, I feel a lot of pressure.

634
00:33:59,870 --> 00:34:01,340
Why is there pressure now?

635
00:34:03,470 --> 00:34:04,540
I was thinking...

636
00:34:04,740 --> 00:34:05,870
If you leave,

637
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:06,740
what will I do?

638
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,470
I'll be alone.

639
00:34:09,180 --> 00:34:10,500
I definitely won't do well.

640
00:34:12,020 --> 00:34:13,540
Don't start by doubting yourself.

641
00:34:13,910 --> 00:34:14,750
Have confidence.

642
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:26,020
Well, the client

643
00:34:26,062 --> 00:34:27,795
who requested
an additional 500,000 yuan.

644
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,790
I really like this new proposal.

645
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:31,270
It's amazing.

646
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:32,240
Let's start work then.

647
00:34:32,660 --> 00:34:34,470
Did you hear that? Perfect.

648
00:34:36,180 --> 00:34:37,100
During this time,

649
00:34:37,270 --> 00:34:38,580
Wu has worked hard.

650
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:39,790
Absolutely.

651
00:34:40,270 --> 00:34:42,060
Wu hasn't been home for several days.

652
00:34:42,790 --> 00:34:45,500
I think I should cook a good meal
to reward him.

653
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,950
I'll leave then.

654
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,620
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

655
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,060
Welcome back, Your Majesty.

656
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:16,990
Rise.

657
00:35:16,990 --> 00:35:17,830
Okay.

658
00:35:19,140 --> 00:35:21,100
I heard the client really
liked your design.

659
00:35:21,830 --> 00:35:22,670
Thanks to you.

660
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:24,140
Mr. Yu, could you give some feedback?

661
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:34,700
Why use this tacky little floral print?

662
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:35,870
I hate it the most.

663
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:37,270
I think it looks pretty.

664
00:35:37,580 --> 00:35:38,910
I never use this in my designs.

665
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,940
- But this isn't...
- But what?

666
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:42,580
Is this your design?

667
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:48,470
Yu Yu Design Studio, Designer Yu Yu.

668
00:35:48,728 --> 00:35:51,240
Do you think people will still believe
it's your design?

669
00:35:52,990 --> 00:35:53,830
No.

670
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,750
If you use my name,
it must follow my style.

671
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:58,750
Got it?

672
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:00,710
Come with me.

673
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,750
I saw in the monitor that you used AI
to make images.

674
00:36:05,220 --> 00:36:06,060
Don't use it again.

675
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:08,270
Why? I think AI

676
00:36:08,870 --> 00:36:09,830
is very efficient.

677
00:36:10,470 --> 00:36:12,660
Efficient, but soulless.

678
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:17,500
Actually, before this,

679
00:36:17,862 --> 00:36:18,990
I also used AI for images.

680
00:36:19,790 --> 00:36:22,140
But for me, it's always just a tool.

681
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:23,750
Currently, AI technology

682
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:26,910
mixes all designers' styles together

683
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
into one image.

684
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,270
You think AI is not mature enough now?

685
00:36:31,750 --> 00:36:32,950
It's not that AI isn't mature.

686
00:36:33,350 --> 00:36:35,430
It needs a mature designer to handle it.

687
00:36:36,020 --> 00:36:38,350
Wu, do you think you're mature enough?

688
00:36:42,350 --> 00:36:43,270
In other words,

689
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:46,470
can your hands draw on a blank sheet?

690
00:36:46,728 --> 00:36:48,180
Do you have images in your head?

691
00:36:49,910 --> 00:36:50,750
AI is a tool,

692
00:36:51,270 --> 00:36:52,140
not a cheat.

693
00:36:53,060 --> 00:36:55,310
Art's soul lies in originality.

694
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,500
Mr. Yu, I was wrong.

695
00:37:04,060 --> 00:37:05,270
I am a designer.

696
00:37:05,950 --> 00:37:07,100
I should have my own ideas,

697
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
my own style.

698
00:37:09,470 --> 00:37:10,700
I will redo the design.

699
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,220
Replace the AI one.

700
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,270
Good.

701
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:17,500
What I said earlier

702
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:19,140
that follow my style...

703
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:20,660
I didn't mean design style.

704
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:24,100
I meant your attitude
towards work and career.

705
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:25,230
Got it.

706
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:29,980
Come back.

707
00:37:34,217 --> 00:37:35,500
This is all the design fee.

708
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:36,900
Not a commission.

709
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,110
Here you go.

710
00:37:40,790 --> 00:37:41,630
All for me?

711
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,020
You're not keeping any?

712
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:45,990
You did this project from start
to finish.

713
00:37:46,195 --> 00:37:47,230
Why should I keep any?

714
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,150
Thanks, Mr. Yu.

715
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:53,500
Remember.

716
00:37:53,728 --> 00:37:55,430
If you have subordinates in the future,

717
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,470
big money must be given in cash.

718
00:37:57,528 --> 00:37:59,351
That's the only way
to keep them in line.

719
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:00,220
Got it.

720
00:38:00,220 --> 00:38:01,140
I deducted 5,000 yuan

721
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,700
because you used AI.

722
00:38:04,220 --> 00:38:06,220
Next time you use it, I'll fire you.

723
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:09,470
Out.

724
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:10,310
Ah.

725
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:19,990
(Please open the door.)

726
00:38:19,990 --> 00:38:20,950
I'm back.

727
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,310
Close your eyes.

728
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:37,790
Careful. Don't open them.

729
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,630
Sure, I won't open.

730
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:39,580
Go.

731
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,420
What?

732
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:42,700
Don't open.

733
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:45,790
Three, two, one.

734
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:54,230
What's this?

735
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:57,910
These...

736
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:00,020
These are your man's design fees.

737
00:39:00,990 --> 00:39:02,500
How about it? Impressive, right?

738
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,430
So much money?

739
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,420
Quick, count it.

740
00:39:20,580 --> 00:39:21,430
Wu.

741
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:22,270
Yes?

742
00:39:22,790 --> 00:39:23,660
Are you

743
00:39:23,660 --> 00:39:25,180
going to propose to me?

744
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:27,460
Propose what?

745
00:39:29,660 --> 00:39:30,500
Not proposing?

746
00:39:30,620 --> 00:39:31,460
No.

747
00:39:31,595 --> 00:39:32,870
Then why did you buy a ring?

748
00:39:33,390 --> 00:39:34,350
No, this ring...

749
00:39:34,417 --> 00:39:35,950
Every time you see it, you can't resist.

750
00:39:35,950 --> 00:39:37,769
Since you've been
longing for it, I'd buy it.

751
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,773
- If you don't want it, I'll return it.
- Wait!

752
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,420
What now?

753
00:39:54,973 --> 00:39:56,395
Consider it the betrothal gift.

754
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:03,270
Even this counts as a betrothal gift? Stingy.

755
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,390
Ah, stop looking.

756
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:12,700
Like you've never seen the world.

757
00:40:14,540 --> 00:40:16,140
It's not about the money.

758
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:20,180
This reflects a man's value,

759
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:22,830
and proves I haven't gone astray
in life.

760
00:40:23,270 --> 00:40:24,660
It also shows my abilities.

761
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,310
I've overcome that hurdle.

762
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:27,220
Wu.

763
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,060
Yes?

764
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,930
I believe in you.

765
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,310
You will definitely become
the best designer.

766
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,380
Of course.

767
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:36,660
But when do you think that will be?

768
00:40:38,020 --> 00:40:39,220
I'm almost 30.

769
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:40,470
Still, Mr. Yu's assistant.

770
00:40:41,084 --> 00:40:42,910
People say thirty is the age
of standing firm.

771
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:45,020
So what am I standing on? Xiaoxiao.

772
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:47,020
True.

773
00:40:48,020 --> 00:40:48,870
You see,

774
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:51,140
this time is just an exception.

775
00:40:51,830 --> 00:40:52,670
Next time,

776
00:40:53,470 --> 00:40:56,500
we'll rely on this salary
and commission.

777
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:01,310
Income is just one part.

778
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:04,620
Mainly, I feel my career

779
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,060
has reached a bottleneck.

780
00:41:08,220 --> 00:41:09,700
I'm currently Mr. Yu's assistant.

781
00:41:10,470 --> 00:41:12,180
Even if I master my craft,

782
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,430
the studio's name

783
00:41:14,390 --> 00:41:15,870
will still be Yu Yu Studio.

784
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:17,830
Over time,

785
00:41:17,830 --> 00:41:19,500
you can actually discuss with Mr. Yu

786
00:41:19,500 --> 00:41:21,620
to call it Yu Yu & Shen Wu Studio.

787
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:24,500
I want it to be Shen Wu Studio.

788
00:41:26,830 --> 00:41:27,670
Xiaoxiao.

789
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:31,380
I'm going solo.

790
00:41:32,500 --> 00:41:33,340
Start my own studio.

791
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:36,830
Wu, you finally figured it out!

792
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,950
I figured it out. Really did.

793
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:44,390
But I have something to tell you.

794
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,020
What?

795
00:41:47,660 --> 00:41:48,830
The money on this bed...

796
00:41:49,790 --> 00:41:51,060
Whoever grabs it keeps it.

797
00:41:55,620 --> 00:41:56,740
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

798
00:41:56,750 --> 00:41:58,540
You're now also considered

799
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:00,580
a somewhat famous designer in Shanghai.

800
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:02,390
If you're willing to come over,

801
00:42:02,790 --> 00:42:05,470
I'm sure Ms. Lin will be very happy.

802
00:42:05,910 --> 00:42:08,350
You are Ms. Lin's most capable designer.

803
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:09,500
- She...
- Wrong.

804
00:42:10,270 --> 00:42:12,750
She's my most capable partner
and manager.

805
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,460
Okay.

806
00:42:16,060 --> 00:42:17,950
Then by your logic,

807
00:42:18,620 --> 00:42:20,950
it's precisely because Ms. Lin
is so outstanding

808
00:42:21,350 --> 00:42:24,060
that her leaving would
be your biggest loss.

809
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,470
Are you threatening me?

810
00:42:26,220 --> 00:42:27,580
Without her, I can't work, right?

811
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,020
That's not what I meant.

812
00:42:32,790 --> 00:42:34,990
Lin Sa didn't leave,
and now you want to poach me?

813
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,190
In your dreams.

814
00:42:36,328 --> 00:42:37,390
What do you take me for?

815
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:39,500
A sidekick, a freebie?

816
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:43,020
Mr. Yu, we will offer you
a very generous...

817
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:43,910
I don't care.

818
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
