Here you go.

29
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:15,180
I promised I'd make you noodles.

30
00:02:16,151 --> 00:02:17,390
You're such a good friend.

31
00:02:17,620 --> 00:02:18,460
Let me smell it.

32
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:20,350
It's great.

33
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:22,740
You're amazing, Xiaoman.

34
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,270
I have to praise your cooking.

35
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,790
This is one of the reasons

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,550
I love coming to your place.

37
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:30,990
I can't wait to try it.

38
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,510
Delicious.

39
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,700
Wait.

40
00:02:39,990 --> 00:02:40,830
Shouldn't you

41
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:42,990
give Mr. Yu a bowl of noodles too?

42
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,440
Well, you see.

43
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:50,300
I could put up a longevity plaque
for him at the temple,

44
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:52,350
but asking me to treat him to a meal...

45
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:53,190
I get it.

46
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,790
Mr. Yu-phobia.

47
00:02:54,990 --> 00:02:55,830
We're both patients.

48
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,420
Say, Xiaoman,

49
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,510
are you free this weekend?

50
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,110
Can you come to a matchmaking event
with me?

51
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,550
Why again?

52
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,110
My dad and I

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:07,990
made a deal.

54
00:03:08,110 --> 00:03:09,860
If I attend this matchmaking event,

55
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,230
I get two months of peace.

56
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,670
I really don't want to go.

57
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,790
Is Mr. Yu doing aerobics?

58
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:24,020
Mr. Yu?

59
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,740
Doing aerobics?

60
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:31,390
Ouch.

61
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:00,350
Ow.

62
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,420
My back.

63
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,510
Please come in.

64
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:30,690
What happened?

65
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,630
It hurts.

66
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:32,670
Where?

67
00:04:34,110 --> 00:04:34,950
The ab roller.

68
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:36,060
I did nine reps.

69
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:39,860
Just nine reps
and you're in this much pain?

70
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:41,070
Each rep

71
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,660
was very solid.

72
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:43,530
That's why

73
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,751
my whole body is sore now.

74
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:47,700
Does this hurt?

75
00:04:48,106 --> 00:04:51,306
- Does this hurt?
- What are you doing?

76
00:04:51,306 --> 00:04:52,684
Is this how you treat the elders?

77
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:53,990
Since when are you my elder?

78
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,350
I call your dad "Fourth Brother",

79
00:04:55,351 --> 00:04:57,130
so you should call me "Sixth Uncle",
got it?

80
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,300
Oh, Sixth Uncle.

81
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
You're in so much pain.

82
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,670
Should I bring you

83
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,230
a wheelchair?

84
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:04,500
The exam's done.

85
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:07,030
You over-exercised
and your muscles are sore.

86
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:08,595
Rest for two days, and you'll be fine.

87
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,150
Exercise is for your health.

88
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:11,351
Why punish your body like this?

89
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:13,150
Don't push yourself too hard.

90
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,500
Why suddenly do ab-roller training?

91
00:05:17,420 --> 00:05:19,500
Because I want abs.

92
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:25,030
Mr. Yu, even without abs,

93
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:26,620
you're still a very charming man.

94
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,460
Oh?

95
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:29,660
- Really?
- Yeah.

96
00:05:29,790 --> 00:05:31,940
My dad signed me up
for a matchmaking event.

97
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,500
He keeps saying no one likes me,

98
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,180
so I want to prove my charm.

99
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,090
Do you want to join me
and test yours as well?

100
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,420
We can make a bet.

101
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,260
Hmph!

102
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:41,260
You really love betting.

103
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:43,260
Let's see if anyone wants to
go on a date with you

104
00:05:43,262 --> 00:05:44,590
after the event.

105
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,380
What? Scared?

106
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:49,430
Says who?

107
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:51,590
Time. Place.

108
00:05:53,980 --> 00:05:57,980
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

109
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:14,940
Wu.

110
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:15,780
Yes?

111
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,790
If I had abs,

112
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:19,260
would you look?

113
00:06:21,550 --> 00:06:22,390
What?

114
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:24,990
Forget it.

115
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,260
I'm not showing you.

116
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,830
Wu.

117
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:30,690
Yeah.

118
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:33,550
Why are you staring at him
like you're seeing something gross?

119
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,150
Mr. Wu asked me to feel his abs.

120
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,940
You have abs?

121
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:41,910
Don't touch me.

122
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,590
Oh, please.

123
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,030
All my personal trainers
are better than you.

124
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,790
Hmph! Listen.

125
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:51,710
Even without abs,

126
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:53,230
I'm still very charming.

127
00:06:57,940 --> 00:06:59,060
What did you buy this time?

128
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:01,870
Beauty.

129
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:17,710
Let me formally introduce her.

130

She won an Oscar

133
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,350
for "Gone with the Wind".

134
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:26,750
You know her?

135
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,350
This poster

136
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:31,260
is from "A Streetcar Named Desire".

137
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,620
1951. First premier. First edition.

138
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,670
This is her autograph.

139
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,390
How much?

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,340
Shallow.

141
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,220

I'll scan yours.

144
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:06,260
Come. Give me a hug, my baby.

145
00:08:09,420 --> 00:08:10,300
Dad, look.

146
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,110
This is the matchmaking event.

147
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,500
Pretty impressive, right?

148
00:08:15,860 --> 00:08:18,300
I've hit this month's quota.

149
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,150
If there's anything else,
wait till next month.

150
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,420
Monthly blind date KPI, done.

151

152
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,240
Wait.

153
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:27,230
- Oh.
- Thank you.

154
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:28,910
We should celebrate this. Cheers.

155
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:33,260
Do you think Mr. Yu will come?

156
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,830
Don't worry. He'll definitely show up.

157

00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,590
Fake compliment.

189
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,684
What's pretty about her?

190
00:09:39,684 --> 00:09:40,500
I...

191
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,860
Let me tell you what's pretty.

192
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:43,110
Smile.

193
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,670
See? Two dimples.

194
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,190
Best thing she's got

195
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,020
from head to toe.

196
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,140
Show your hip joint.

197
00:09:50,350 --> 00:09:51,190
Hip?

198
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,310
I'm warning you.

199
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,830
Have some confidence.

200
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:55,830
Don't go this far just to win.

201
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:57,270
See that?

202
00:09:57,540 --> 00:09:58,470
Calm face

203
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,470
with the raging storm inside.

204
00:10:00,470 --> 00:10:01,990
That's her trait, not a flaw.

205
00:10:02,173 --> 00:10:03,660
It means she comports herself well

206
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,500
and is forgiving.

207
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:06,190
Besides, she never holds a grudge.

208
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:08,110
She's a care-free type.

209
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,590
Something happens, and she forgets.

210
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,140
Is he your ex-husband?

211
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,500
Yes, he is.

212
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:15,710
Nice looks,

213
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:16,780
but average performances.

214
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,500
I'll let you guys talk.

215
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:20,430
I'm going to the restroom.

216
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:23,950
Well.

217
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,590
What a shame.
He's not interested in you.

218
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,860
Why are you messing this up?

219
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:28,700
Wait.

220
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:30,140
I was praising you.

221
00:10:30,140 --> 00:10:31,140
I was promoting you.

222
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,900
No need. Worry about yourself.

223
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:33,990
Stop interfering.

224
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:36,190
Annoying. You're going to lose for sure.

225
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,950
Take your nonsense elsewhere.

226
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,990
This is called,
"I shot myself in the foot."

227
00:11:08,990 --> 00:11:11,140
Up there. Isn't that Mr. Yu?

228
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:14,470
He's in the one-on-one area.

229
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:16,020
Doesn't matter where he is.

230
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,710
No one can stand listening to him.

231
00:11:18,617 --> 00:11:20,462
He gets three seconds
of sympathy from me.

232
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:24,950
Jia,

233
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:27,380
I love your dimples.

234
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,470
I'm so jealous.

235
00:11:28,710 --> 00:11:29,900
I want to get surgery for one.

236
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,070
Don't.

237
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:32,540
They'd collect rainwater.

238
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,710
You're sounding more like Mr. Yu.

239
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:37,740
You're starting to act like him.

240
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,070
Am I?

241
00:11:59,950 --> 00:12:00,990
Look.

242
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:03,190
There are two of them.

243
00:12:04,106 --> 00:12:05,620
They can't handle him for long.

244
00:12:06,900 --> 00:12:07,860
Aren't you two cramped?

245
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,660
This is a competition.

246
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,020
This is a rat race.

247
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,260
You're fighting for mate-choice rights.

248
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,070
The rights go to you.

249
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:20,950
One's gone.

250
00:12:22,310 --> 00:12:24,660
Right, we weren't done talking.

251
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:27,660
There's also a related term for that,
priority mate-choice rights.

252
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,230
You're not that knowledgeable.

253
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:32,710
The other one left too.

254
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,860
I told you.

255
00:12:36,740 --> 00:12:39,110
We'll definitely win.

256
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:40,430
Right.

257
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,430
Nikon FM2.

258
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:12,230
Oh, you know cameras.

259
00:13:34,862 --> 00:13:36,310
People don't carry cash anymore.

260
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:37,710
Can't believe someone brought coins.

261
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,310
Thank you.

262
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:45,590
Hey. If you keep shooting me,
I'm charging for image rights.

263
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,110
My job is to photograph the event,

264
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:51,470
but I respect your privacy.

265
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,573
But this is a film. I can't delete them.

266
00:13:54,617 --> 00:13:56,070
And I shot other things at the start,

267
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:57,660
so I can't give you the whole roll.

268
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:58,500
So?

269
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,540
So, I'll develop the negatives
and send them to you.

270
00:14:02,551 --> 00:14:04,860
Keep or throw them away, your choice.
How does that sound?

271
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:07,540
Whatever.

272
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:09,262
But I don't think
you'll throw them away.

273
00:14:11,070 --> 00:14:11,910
What do you think?

274
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:16,173
Develop the negatives
and give them to me.

275
00:14:16,173 --> 00:14:16,840
Okay.

276
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,190
What's your name?

277
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,580
Yu Yu.

278
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,500
Yu Yu?

279
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:23,430
Mmm.

280
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,310
No wonder you looked familiar.

281
00:14:25,310 --> 00:14:27,020
I've seen you in home decor magazines.

282
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,350
You must be the talented

283
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:29,710
but quirky designer, right?

284
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:31,310
Am I weird?

285
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:32,995
Nice to meet you, I'm Fei Wenli.

286
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:34,270
What?

287
00:14:35,662 --> 00:14:37,351
(Fei Wenli. Events Department)
Fei Wenli.

288
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:43,950
I didn't expect to meet you here.

289
00:14:44,751 --> 00:14:46,373
Are you here for the matchmaking event?

290
00:14:46,484 --> 00:14:47,620
I'm here for a competition.

291
00:14:47,860 --> 00:14:48,860
And I'm about to win.

292
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,420
Congrats.

293
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:54,500
I remember your design concept
centers on the kitchen.

294
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,660
- Right?
- Right.

295
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,470
People say a bed makes a home,

296
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,500
but it doesn't.

297
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,500
The warmth of cooking does.

298
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:02,620
Mmm.

299
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,230
To be precise, it's wok hei.
[*Charred, smoky flavor from stir-frying]

300
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,790
Wok hei?

301
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:10,660
You know about food?

302
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:14,110
Of course. All I do every day
is take photos and eat.

303
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,380
I love meat,

304
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:16,660
especially braised pork belly.

305
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,380
Braised pork belly?

306
00:15:19,590 --> 00:15:20,860
Yeah. Do you like it?

307
00:15:23,084 --> 00:15:24,310
I used to eat it all the time.

308
00:15:24,860 --> 00:15:25,700
I see.

309
00:15:26,190 --> 00:15:29,190
Jia, I can't find Mr. Yu.

310
00:15:29,310 --> 00:15:30,990
Could someone have picked him up?

311
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,430
Impossible.

312
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,470
He's immune to flirting.

313
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:37,830
Maybe he ran off
because he felt defeated.

314
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,110
Let him.

315
00:15:39,128 --> 00:15:41,050
I've struck out on
seven conversations in a row.

316
00:15:41,190 --> 00:15:44,470
It's like I've collected
every kind of superhero here.

317
00:15:45,260 --> 00:15:47,190
The matchmaking event

318
00:15:47,190 --> 00:15:49,190
is seriously training
my stress tolerance.

319
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,780
Yeah. Like you said,

320
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:53,860
someone funny, attractive,
and easy to talk to

321
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,070
can't be found here.

322
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:56,100
Honestly,

323
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,590
everyone here is less interesting
than Mr. Yu.

324
00:15:59,310 --> 00:16:01,020
Keep looking for him then.

325
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,540
Sure. I'll look for something fun.

326
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,660
Isn't that Mr. Yu?

327
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:08,710
They're chatting and laughing.

328
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,900
She's a young, pretty lady.

329
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,070
That makes no sense.

330
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:14,430
Look.

331
00:16:14,660 --> 00:16:16,380
Is that a staff ID

332
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,070
hanging around her neck?

333
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:20,660
Mr. Yu is doing whatever it takes

334
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:23,830
to win.

335
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:24,840
Hmph.

336
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,860
Such a pity.

337
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,190
He scared off all the ladies,

338
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,230
so now he can only talk to the staff.

339
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,595
Blanch the pork belly.

340
00:16:34,617 --> 00:16:37,950
Then, turn it to medium heat and simmer
for two minutes and fifteen seconds.

341
00:16:37,950 --> 00:16:39,590
Yes, to get rid of the blood smell.

342
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:41,780
Then, cut it into pieces,

343
00:16:41,780 --> 00:16:43,500
and fry it until half-cooked.

344
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,590
Golden brown.

345
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,190
Add ginger and scallions.

346
00:16:46,310 --> 00:16:48,990
Yes. Then add rock sugar and stir slowly.

347
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:50,310
After adding water,

348
00:16:50,310 --> 00:16:52,310
throw in some star anise and cinnamon.

349
00:16:52,590 --> 00:16:54,020
Hey, not "throw".

350
00:16:54,350 --> 00:16:55,500
You need the exact grams.

351
00:16:55,900 --> 00:16:58,350
Fine. Skip ahead to lifting the lid

352
00:16:58,350 --> 00:16:59,590
and serving it at the table.

353
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:01,430
Glossy and red.

354
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,590
Nice aroma.

355
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,340
You're making me hungry.

356
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,230
Come on. Let's eat now.

357
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:10,550
Now?

358
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,630
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

359
00:17:18,340 --> 00:17:20,710
Whoa. Have you found someone
who wants to marry you?

360
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,860
Need my help?

361
00:17:21,870 --> 00:17:22,920
We had a good conversation.

362
00:17:22,928 --> 00:17:23,740
No thanks.

363
00:17:23,910 --> 00:17:24,750
Really?

364
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:28,550
Ximen.

365
00:17:29,484 --> 00:17:30,540
Sorry to keep you waiting.

366
00:17:30,870 --> 00:17:31,870
Let's continue.

367
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,940
Let's go.

368
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:33,940
Xiaoman.

369
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,620
Your friends?

370
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:40,910
My neighbor and my doctor.

371
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:42,710
Ignore them. Let's go.

372
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:43,580
Okay.

373
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,780
I'll take you to a place

374
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,100
you've definitely never tried.

375
00:17:46,260 --> 00:17:47,100
Really?

376
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,060
He's despicable.

377
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,630
He went after the staff.

378
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,670
He really wants to win.

379
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:00,710
(Yu Yu)
(I won.)

380
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:08,740
May I ask, which one of you
is supposed to talk to me?

381
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,100
- Her.
- Her.

382
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:20,190
Let me try.

383
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,310
How does it taste?

384
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:25,973
The braised pork belly is really good.

385
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,870
Right? I've eaten it since I was a kid.

386
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,740
Even after I became a photographer,

387
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,260
I came back to shoot the chef here.

388
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:33,430
An old Shanghai man.

389
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,580
Not bad.

390
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:40,060
You captured
that warmth of cooking I like.

391
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,340
Well, your photos are artistic,

392
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:44,740
but they still feel real.

393
00:18:44,928 --> 00:18:46,780
That's what a good photographer
should do.

394
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,060
Thank you.

395
00:18:48,390 --> 00:18:51,260
A bad one is that they close their eyes,
hit the shutter,

396
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,150
and call it "art".

397
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,300
I know people like that.

398
00:18:56,328 --> 00:18:57,540
What do you usually shoot?

399
00:18:59,020 --> 00:18:59,910
Beauty.

400
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:03,820
I don't want to shoot Messi
being tackled mid-air,

401
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,150
or homeless refugees.

402
00:19:06,484 --> 00:19:08,284
I just like shooting things
that are beautiful.

403
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,430
But those photos don't get paid,

404
00:19:10,580 --> 00:19:12,340
so I can only take gigs

405
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,820
like the matchmaking event earlier

406
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:15,020
to fund my dream.

407
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:18,710
Keep at it.

408
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:20,270
I support you.

409
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:24,020
Take photos that make people feel calm

410
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:26,950
when they're upset

411
00:19:26,950 --> 00:19:28,670
or hopeful when they're down.

412
00:19:30,910 --> 00:19:31,750
Alright.

413
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:33,380
Thank you.

414
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,500
An optimistic photographer spreads joy.

415
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:40,910
A kind designer creates happiness.

416
00:19:49,484 --> 00:19:50,580
I have to get back to work.

417
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:52,150
Annoying. Bill, please.

418
00:19:52,870 --> 00:19:53,710
Wait.

419
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,710
Guess how many photos I took.

420
00:19:55,950 --> 00:19:56,950
Even or odd?

421
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,470
I think

422
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,990
even.

423
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:05,060
Wrong. 35 photos.

424
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:05,900
It's on me.

425
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,180
Thank you.

426
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:10,790
Nice meeting you.

427
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:18,070
- Is it here?
- Yes.

428
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,940
Give me a second.

429
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,620
Again?

430
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:43,910
I really can't wait to see them.

431
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,630
Really? I'll do it quick.

432
00:20:46,328 --> 00:20:47,540
Thank you for sending me back.

433
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,395
Don't mention it.
Next time it's your turn.

434
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:04,470
Next time?

435
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,820
(Espresso)

436
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,150
Mr. Yu, sorry to call you back

437
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,820
on the weekend.

438
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:27,320
It's fine.

439
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:28,230
Wow.

440
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,430
Did you go to an audition or something?

441
00:21:31,230 --> 00:21:33,190
Just cleaned myself up a bit.

442
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,990
Why do you sound like Ou Yang?

443
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:38,470
Well,

444
00:21:39,020 --> 00:21:42,060
Sun said the schedules are overlapping.

445
00:21:42,060 --> 00:21:43,060
They're short-handed.

446
00:21:43,170 --> 00:21:45,528
Figure something out.
Xiaoxiao went to get the documents.

447
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,860
She'll bring them over in a moment.

448
00:21:46,862 --> 00:21:48,390
Mr. Yu.

449
00:21:49,710 --> 00:21:50,550
The files.

450
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:02,740
(Slackers Group Chat)

451
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,180
What?

452
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:08,340
What's it?

453
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:13,190
Xiaoxiao stepped on my foot.

454
00:22:20,820 --> 00:22:22,940
(Who's that woman?)

455
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:30,100
(Mr. Yu's girlfriend?)

456
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,170
(It's that photographer
from the matchmaking event.)

457
00:22:32,173 --> 00:22:34,860
(Are they dating now?)

458
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,550
Let's take a selfie.

459
00:22:40,910 --> 00:22:41,870
The lighting's bad here.

460
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,820
Let's move to this side.

461
00:22:44,195 --> 00:22:46,020
You look pretty from this angle,
Xiaoxiao.

462
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:47,230
Really pretty.

463
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,540
It's working hours now.

464
00:22:53,150 --> 00:22:54,150
- Alright.
- Alright.

465
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:07,580
(Something's wrong with him.)

466
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,710
Mr. Yu,

467
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:20,500
who was that girl just now?

468
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:23,550
A girl?

469
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,780
No wonder you clean up so nicely.

470
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,470
She's young and beautiful.

471
00:23:30,670 --> 00:23:31,950
She dropped him off.

472
00:23:31,950 --> 00:23:32,790
Really?

473
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,940
Who is she?

474
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:36,620
No one.

475
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,540
No one? She's gorgeous.

476
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:40,860
Look at him.

477
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:43,430
He's trying to hide it.

478
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Are you shy?

479
00:23:47,728 --> 00:23:49,300
You really got yourself a girlfriend?

480
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:52,670
Someone actually asked you out, Mr. Yu?

481
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,100
Am I not allowed to go on a date?

482
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,540
Why are you all freaking out?

483
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:04,620
What do you think?

484
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,770
I just like shooting something
that is beautiful.

485
00:24:07,430 --> 00:24:08,340
Hello, I'm Fei Wenli.

486
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:12,500
- Wu.
- Yes?

487
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:15,540
Take that poster down
and throw it away.

488
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,940
Why?

489
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:20,990
That one isn't the real Yu Yu.

490
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:44,300
Do you need a straw?

491
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,310
No.

492
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,100
Do you have a membership card?

493
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:48,310
No.

494
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:53,580
By the way,

495
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:55,470
this one's on me.

496
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,100
Thank you.

497
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,630
We can make a bet.

498
00:25:03,662 --> 00:25:05,640
Let's see if anyone wants to
go on a date with you

499
00:25:05,684 --> 00:25:06,710
after the event.

500
00:25:06,773 --> 00:25:07,780
You're definitely losing.

501
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:10,500
Who was that girl just now?

502
00:25:10,950 --> 00:25:11,790
Who is she?

503
00:25:11,950 --> 00:25:13,580
No wonder you clean up so nicely.

504
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:23,070
Oh.

505
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,060
What are you doing here, Dao?

506
00:25:25,990 --> 00:25:26,990
Look what I brought you.

507
00:25:30,820 --> 00:25:31,660
Dao.

508
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,580
Mr. Yu.

509
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:36,500
What are you eating, Dao?

510
00:25:39,630 --> 00:25:40,470
He says it's nothing.

511
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,150
Um... Mr. Yu.

512
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:48,630
That girl from the matchmaking event...

513
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:50,580
Her name is Fei Wenli.

514
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,070
Right.

515
00:25:52,190 --> 00:25:53,670
How are things going with her?

516
00:25:53,684 --> 00:25:55,173
Have you two had a meal together yet?

517
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:56,270
We have.

518
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,180
How was it?

519
00:25:57,340 --> 00:25:58,180
The food is good.

520
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,740
I mean, how are things between you two?

521
00:26:02,020 --> 00:26:02,860
Not bad.

522
00:26:04,060 --> 00:26:05,630
What did you two do?

523
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,670
We ate, took a walk,

524
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:10,100
took a car,

525
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
and took some photos.

526
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,060
Wow, so romantic.

527
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:15,580
Romantic what?

528
00:26:16,340 --> 00:26:18,060
I didn't even get her number.

529
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:19,300
So "not bad"

530
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:21,060
means "not okay".

531
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,340
Liar.

532
00:26:26,910 --> 00:26:27,750
Wait...

533
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:32,630
Why is she here?

534
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:40,990
Mr. Yu.

535
00:26:41,462 --> 00:26:42,710
How did you know I live here?

536
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:43,950
I'm staff.

537
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,060
I have your info.

538
00:26:45,306 --> 00:26:46,340
We chatted for two hours,

539
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,928
and I didn't add you on WeChat.

540
00:26:48,017 --> 00:26:49,540
We talked for two hours?

541
00:26:49,540 --> 00:26:50,560
Yeah. Here you go.

542
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,020
Looking forward to it?

543
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,660
(Podfelin Laboratory)
Check and see if it's clear.

544
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:54,862
I'm looking forward to it.

545
00:26:55,290 --> 00:26:56,150
What's that?

546
00:26:56,150 --> 00:26:57,351
It has nothing to do with you.

547
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:01,490
Hi, neighbor.

548
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:02,580
We met this morning.

549
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,420
I'm Fei Wenli.

550
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,020
Hi, I'm Xia Xiaoman.

551
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,310
This is my card.

552
00:27:07,395 --> 00:27:08,189
I'm a photographer.

553
00:27:08,190 --> 00:27:09,710
If you want a photo shoot,
just hit me up.

554
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:10,910
Okay. Sure.

555
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,430
Why are you coughing?

556
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,020
Don't you have things to do?

557
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,270
You guys talk.

558
00:27:29,470 --> 00:27:30,470
Tomorrow's the weekend.

559
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,740
Come by my studio if you're free.

560
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,870
I have a Flextight X5 scanner.

561
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,300
All the chemicals are single-use,

562
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:36,340
including E6.

563
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:37,750
Interested?

564
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:38,630
Very interested.

565
00:27:39,780 --> 00:27:41,100
The anticipation of film

566
00:27:41,140 --> 00:27:42,680
is something digital can't compare to.

567
00:27:42,684 --> 00:27:44,150
Here. Add me on WeChat, and I'm off.

568
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,373
See you at my studio tomorrow.

569
00:27:45,373 --> 00:27:46,070
Alright.

570
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,140
Coming.

571
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,190
Welcome.

572
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,470
Big news!

573
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,390
Mr. Yu is seeing someone.

574
00:28:46,820 --> 00:28:47,660
What?

575
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:50,340
That girl from the matchmaking event.
Fei Wenli.

576
00:28:51,990 --> 00:28:52,830
Oh.

577
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,910
You know what?

578
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,190
The way they looked at each other

579
00:28:55,190 --> 00:28:57,340
was pure chemistry.

580
00:28:58,820 --> 00:28:59,780
Oh, really?

581
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,500
"Oh"?

582
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,230
This is huge news. I need a moment.

583
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,500
(Podfelin Laboratory, Fei Wenli)

584
00:29:08,670 --> 00:29:09,510
Look.

585
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:11,180
It's her, right?

586
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,262
(Photographer, Podfelin Laboratory)

587
00:29:12,710 --> 00:29:13,950
She looks elegant.

588
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:15,990
She's older than me,

589
00:29:16,190 --> 00:29:17,580
but she's very artsy.

590
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:20,060
Marriage is a dark path

591
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,900
full of thorns.

592
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,060
Wish them luck.

593
00:29:22,084 --> 00:29:23,230
What are you talking about?

594
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:24,780
They're not getting married tomorrow.

595
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:27,550
True.

596
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:35,430
Are you upset
that Mr. Yu's dating someone?

597
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,470
Why would I be?

598
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,060
Well, I am.

599
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:44,470
He's already dating,
and I'm still single.

600
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:46,340
Makes me look like a loser.

601
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:50,390
How about we go shopping tomorrow?

602
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,230
I need an outlet.

603
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:54,230
Sure. Afternoon.

604
00:29:54,328 --> 00:29:55,906
I have consultations in the morning.

605
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,430
Mr. Yu's dating someone.

606
00:30:01,670 --> 00:30:03,150
Ridiculous!

607
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:30,740
What is this?

608
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:33,990
You're so lazy now,
and you see a doctor by video?

609
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:35,420
Well...

610
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,870
I need you to help me pick an outfit.

611
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:39,510
Look.

612
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,100
Pick one for me.

613
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,910
Which one works?

614
00:30:43,870 --> 00:30:45,580
You really need me for this?

615
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:48,500
If you don't want to help,

616
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:49,790
it's fine.

617
00:30:51,870 --> 00:30:52,710
What's the occasion?

618
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:56,230
I'm meeting someone.

619
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:58,030
Man or woman?

620
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,140
Woman.

621
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,020
Fei Wenli?

622
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:06,740
Top right, first outfit.

623
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,860
This one?

624
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:39,510
What are you doing?

625
00:31:39,795 --> 00:31:41,395
- Taking pictures of you.
- Delete it.

626
00:31:42,150 --> 00:31:43,020
Film can't be deleted.

627
00:31:43,951 --> 00:31:45,820
Aren't you going on a date?
Why are you here?

628
00:31:46,662 --> 00:31:47,780
I wanted to test the camera.

629
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:48,750
I'm busy.

630
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,100
I'll take just two shots.

631
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,470
Why not shoot someone else?

632
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:55,870
Out of the people I know,
you're the only one I thought of.

633
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:58,706
No one else wants to
deal with you, right?

634
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:00,300
You look best in photos.

635
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,670
Don't move. No big movements.

636
00:32:06,500 --> 00:32:07,740
One, two, three.

637
00:32:08,870 --> 00:32:09,710
This one's nice.

638
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:11,260
Look outside. Good.

639
00:32:11,728 --> 00:32:13,551
A few more shots. It won't take long.

640
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,870
Big faces are easier to focus on.

641
00:32:18,340 --> 00:32:19,820
What did you just say? Say that again.

(Podfelin)

644
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,860
How's it?

645
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,620
Mr. Yu,

646
00:33:19,670 --> 00:33:20,950
just relax and pose naturally.

647
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,870
Try putting one foot down.

648
00:33:32,740 --> 00:33:33,580
Mr. Yu,

649
00:33:33,910 --> 00:33:36,060
it isn't quite ideal today.

650
00:33:38,506 --> 00:33:40,373
Why don't we shoot at your studio
another day?

651
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:41,420
That's troublesome.

652
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,820
You bought the premium portrait package.

653
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:46,430
Of course, I want to capture
the most real, natural,

654
00:33:46,580 --> 00:33:48,340
and handsome version of you, right?

655
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:50,100
You're right. I agree.

656
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,340
Great. It's settled.

657
00:34:04,820 --> 00:34:06,340
(Podfelin)

658
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:12,350
How's my studio?

659
00:34:13,350 --> 00:34:14,190
Not bad.

660
00:34:14,973 --> 00:34:16,620
I thought it'd be
some ordinary photo studio.

661
00:34:16,620 --> 00:34:18,020
I didn't know it was a film lab.

662
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:20,195
For a moment, I thought
I had traveled back in time.

663
00:34:20,220 --> 00:34:21,870
Photo studios are all over the place.

664
00:34:22,350 --> 00:34:23,310
This place

665
00:34:23,910 --> 00:34:24,750
is history.

666
00:34:25,950 --> 00:34:28,020
Oh, right. Can you develop this roll?

667
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,150
This is

668
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,100
a Seagull 4A.

669
00:34:34,417 --> 00:34:36,128
One of the two Chinese classic rolls.

670
00:34:36,506 --> 00:34:37,540
The other one's Phoenix.

671
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:38,790
You're an expert.

672
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,500
But this roll must be really old.

673
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,500
Hope it develops.

674
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,350
It's a 400 roll, but I shot it at 100.

675
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,750
So develop it at 800.

676
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,310
Professional.

677
00:34:50,020 --> 00:34:50,860
No problem.

678
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:23,750
Nice shot.

679
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,420
Not bad.

680
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,100
Can I do it myself?

681
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,020
Of course.

682
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:30,310
Here.

683
00:35:30,990 --> 00:35:31,830
Remember.

684
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:32,960
This is the developer.

685
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,810
This is the wash.

686
00:35:33,830 --> 00:35:34,670
This is the fixer.

687
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:23,540
Is she the doctor?

688
00:36:24,270 --> 00:36:25,110
Yeah.

689
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,020
Nice shot.

690
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:29,670
Thank you.

691
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:40,390
Please. Please.

692
00:36:42,351 --> 00:36:43,470
What are you doing, Xiaoxiao?

693
00:36:43,950 --> 00:36:45,020
Tomorrow's Monday.

694
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:47,262
I'm making a wish
that I don't have to wake up early.

695
00:36:47,310 --> 00:36:48,150
Stop dreaming.

696
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:49,390
Unless the earth explodes.

697
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,980
What are you thinking about?

698
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,060
I just think

699
00:36:58,060 --> 00:37:00,350
that Fei Wenli is a bit weird.

700
00:37:00,790 --> 00:37:03,140
When we see Mr. Yu,

701
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,180
we don't like him.

702
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:06,750
But when she sees him,

703
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,620
she's even more into him.

704
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:09,910
What's wrong with that?

705
00:37:10,140 --> 00:37:13,020
Maybe she sees
Mr. Yu as a potential client.

706
00:37:13,310 --> 00:37:14,950
When we meet a client,

707
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:17,470
we all do that sincere fake smile.

708
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,310
A sincere fake smile?

709
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,270
It sounds twisted.

710
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,580
That's normal.

711
00:37:24,684 --> 00:37:26,417
After all, she's trying
to get customers.

712
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:27,500
Anyway,

713
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,540
if she really hits the right note,

714
00:37:29,750 --> 00:37:32,270
Mr. Yu would definitely spend money.

715
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,270
Yeah.

716
00:37:41,870 --> 00:37:42,710
What?

717
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:44,790
Mr. Yu says tomorrow's a day off.

718
00:37:44,884 --> 00:37:46,830
He told me to let you know
you don't need to go.

719
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:49,060
I don't need to go?

720
00:37:49,220 --> 00:37:50,620
My wish came true.

721
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:51,990
But I have confirmed

722
00:37:51,990 --> 00:37:53,660
tomorrow's work with him.

723
00:37:53,660 --> 00:37:54,540
Why suddenly cancel?

724
00:37:54,684 --> 00:37:56,417
And why don't you need to go to work?

725
00:37:56,660 --> 00:37:57,830
You're not under him.

726
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,950
Look. Ms. Lin just texted me.

727
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,500
Mr. Yu told her not to go
to the studio tomorrow.

728
00:38:10,310 --> 00:38:11,580
What on earth

729
00:38:11,580 --> 00:38:13,140
is Mr. Yu doing at the studio tomorrow?

730
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:19,390
I heard he's meeting Fei Wenli
this weekend.

731
00:38:19,620 --> 00:38:20,500
So maybe

732
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:22,310
your day off
has something to do with her.

733
00:38:22,910 --> 00:38:23,830
I get it.

734
00:38:24,270 --> 00:38:26,700
Men always bring women to their turf

735
00:38:26,700 --> 00:38:27,790
to show off their success.

736
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:28,750
That's typical of men.

737
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:31,660
He's probably meeting her
there tomorrow

738
00:38:31,706 --> 00:38:32,990
and doesn't want you guys around,

739
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,830
as it'll be awkward,

740
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:35,373
so he gave everyone the day off.

741
00:38:37,700 --> 00:38:39,580
Is he really dating now?

742
00:38:39,790 --> 00:38:40,700
How would I know?

743
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,950
Whether he is or not,
we'll find out tomorrow.

744
00:38:45,262 --> 00:38:46,470
You can wake up early then?

745
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:48,620
Not even the food can shut you up.

746
00:38:49,180 --> 00:38:50,270
I want to see too.

747
00:38:50,470 --> 00:38:52,580
But we both have work tomorrow.

748
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:53,950
You can go.

749
00:38:53,950 --> 00:38:55,151
I'll help you apply for leave.

750
00:38:55,151 --> 00:38:56,084
You go for me.

751
00:38:56,270 --> 00:38:57,180
I'm not interested.

752
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,580
My task is very important.

753
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:01,710
Give me another one.

754
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:10,700
I want to have a boyfriend.

755
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,540
Here.

756
00:39:13,790 --> 00:39:14,630
Eat one.

757
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,020
It's really good.

758
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:18,020
Nice, right? Eat more.

759
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:21,020
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

760
00:39:23,390 --> 00:39:24,230
Good.

761
00:39:25,660 --> 00:39:26,830
Very good.

762
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:30,310
Yes. Good.
Lower your head a little. Turn around.

763
00:39:32,506 --> 00:39:33,830
Taking photos is exhausting.

764
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,910
You're good at this.

765
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:37,470
People used to ask me
to model, you know?

766
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:38,420
I turned them down.

767
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,340
Close-up shot.

768
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:41,670
Good.

769
00:39:41,728 --> 00:39:42,710
Let me check the light.

770
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:43,980
Mr. Yu,

771
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:46,180
your studio is so nice.

772
00:39:46,750 --> 00:39:47,590
I'm jealous.

773
00:39:48,830 --> 00:39:49,700
If a designer

774
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:52,060
who can't fix his own workspace,

775
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:53,430
how can clients trust them?

776
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,830
Fair point. Clothes make the man.

777
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:56,900
House too.

778
00:39:58,950 --> 00:40:00,040
- Close-up shot.
- Okay.

779
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,700
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

780
00:40:04,660 --> 00:40:06,060
Hi, I'm Shen Wu.

781
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:07,020
Nickname Wu.

782
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:08,060
Hello, I'm Fei Wenli.

783
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:09,150
No nickname.

784
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:11,390
You're Fei Wenli?

785
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:14,580
I heard

786
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:15,750
you rescued Mr. Yu

787
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:17,100
from the matchmaking event

788
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,310
and saved thousands of girls
from his mean sarcasm.

789
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,910
I thank you on their behalf.

790
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,230
No need.

791
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:23,560
- Wu.
- Yes?

792
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:25,020
Didn't I tell you not to come today?

793
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:25,860
Why are you here?

794
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:30,580
I forgot something.

795
00:40:30,580 --> 00:40:31,830
Carry on. Don't mind me.

796
00:40:33,020 --> 00:40:33,860
Let's continue.

797
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,100
- Ignore him.
- Okay.

798
00:40:35,750 --> 00:40:37,390
Milk tea.

799
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:38,480
Hi.

800
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:39,340
Hi.

801
00:40:39,351 --> 00:40:40,430
What are you doing here?

802
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,270
I...

803
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:47,660
I thought you were working so hard,

804
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,795
so I came to check on you.

805
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:50,620
Aren't you living with Wu?

806
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:51,990
He could've brought it.

807
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,906
We're couples.
Either of us can deliver.

808
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:54,750
Have something sweet?

809
00:40:55,580 --> 00:40:56,420
No thanks.

810
00:40:57,484 --> 00:40:58,540
Just put it down and leave.

811
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:02,990
Wu.

812
00:41:02,990 --> 00:41:03,830
Yes?

813
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,710
Have you found it?

814
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,180
Where is it? I can't find it.

815
00:41:09,180 --> 00:41:10,020
Xiaoxiao,

816
00:41:10,180 --> 00:41:11,180
help me.

817
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:12,950
Don't disturb Mr. Yu.

818
00:41:18,173 --> 00:41:19,560
- Let's change angles.
- Okay.

819
00:41:19,580 --> 00:41:21,020
- Ignore them.
- Okay.

820
00:41:22,950 --> 00:41:23,790
Come on.

821
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,310
Let's get a few nice shots.

822
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:26,940
Whoa.

823
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:27,950
Ms. Lin.

824
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:29,595
- Everyone's here?
- You're here, Ms. Lin.

825
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,350
Mr. Yu,

826
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:32,910
those eyes of yours.

827
00:41:33,595 --> 00:41:35,017
Missing your girlfriend?

828
00:41:40,140 --> 00:41:40,980
Hi.

829
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,790
Hello. Well...

830
00:41:43,990 --> 00:41:44,830
I'm Fei Wenli.

831
00:41:44,990 --> 00:41:46,470
You really do know Vivien Leigh.

832
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:47,900
I'm Lin Sa.

833
00:41:47,973 --> 00:41:49,440
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

834
00:41:50,790 --> 00:41:52,620
How's it going?

835
00:41:55,180 --> 00:41:56,100
Thrilling.

836
00:41:58,870 --> 00:41:59,910
Don't lie.

837
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:02,350
The client loved your design so much.

838
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,528
They added another half a million
to the budget

839
00:42:04,660 --> 00:42:06,500
for a better design.

840
00:42:07,270 --> 00:42:09,310
So my commission is going up too?

841
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,310
As expected of Ms. Lin.

842
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:11,200
Right.

843
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,390
But Mr. Yu will have to redo the design.

844
00:42:13,580 --> 00:42:14,540
I'm not redoing it.

845
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:17,480
Miss Fei.

846
00:42:17,500 --> 00:42:19,950
Quick. Capture this moment
of stubborn Mr. Yu.

847
00:42:20,270 --> 00:42:22,830
I'm putting this photo on my desk

848
00:42:22,830 --> 00:42:23,670
to motivate myself.

849
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:24,710
Okay.

850
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:30,220
It's just a photo shoot.

851
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:31,540
Did you have to send us all away?

852
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:33,350
Right? Was that necessary?

853
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,310
Yeah. Was that necessary, Mr. Yu?

854
00:42:35,310 --> 00:42:36,660
It's just a photo shoot.

855
00:42:37,620 --> 00:42:39,020
Yeah. Mr. Yu, we're not outsiders.

856
00:42:39,751 --> 00:42:41,910
Let's take a group photo.
Miss Fei, take one for us.

857
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:44,100
No, no, no!

858
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:44,940
Come on.

859
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:46,950
Okay. Ready?

860
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,540
Three, two, one.

861
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
