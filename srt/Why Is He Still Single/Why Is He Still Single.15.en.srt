Hello, Mr. Yu, anything?

33
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,420
Xiaoxiao.

34
00:02:25,106 --> 00:02:26,973
Where is Lin Sa signing the contract?

35
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,350
Are you okay?

36
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:11,580
Don't go.

37
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:25,020
Don't go.

38
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:28,540
Alright?

39
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,020
No one's here now.

40
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,550
Tell me the reason.

41
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:43,260
The reason?

42
00:03:44,510 --> 00:03:45,700
A better opportunity.

43
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:46,950
Better salary.

44
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:48,390
Hmph.

45
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:49,840
You won't gain anything at all.

46
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,830
Why?

47
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,070
The reason headhunters approached you

48
00:03:53,417 --> 00:03:55,062
is that you've achieved results,

49
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,230
but your achievements
are all because of my designs.

50
00:03:57,350 --> 00:03:58,230
Without my designs,

51
00:03:58,284 --> 00:03:59,670
you wouldn't survive in Beijing.

52
00:04:01,350 --> 00:04:02,950
I could find a designer

53
00:04:02,950 --> 00:04:04,700
as outstanding as you in Beijing.

54
00:04:05,506 --> 00:04:07,110
Have you found one in all these years?

55
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:09,830
You mean

56
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:11,860
everything I have today

57
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:12,980
is because of you?

58
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,260
No.

59
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,740
Without you,

60
00:04:20,328 --> 00:04:21,573
I can't make it either.

61
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:26,430
All these years,

62
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:28,790
I've been focused on my own creations.

63
00:04:30,084 --> 00:04:31,820
I couldn't handle those unhappy couples,

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:32,860
or annoying clients.

65
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:35,510
But you could.

66
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:40,430
So we are partners.

67
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,220
The best partners.

68
00:04:44,706 --> 00:04:46,573
And you've learned to compliment me.

69
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:49,470
I'm quite flattered.

70
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:51,951
Be serious.

71
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,990
Are you still going?

72
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,260
Alright, I understand.

73
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,470
Let me think it over.

74
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:56,900
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

75
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,180
Everyone, I'm here.

76
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,590
- Ms. Lin.
- Ms. Lin.

77
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:16,710
You're back, Ms. Lin.

78
00:06:16,862 --> 00:06:18,060
Ms. Lin, you're not leaving?

79
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,380
Right, I'm staying.

80
00:06:23,062 --> 00:06:24,670
Did the company in Beijing reject you?

81
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:28,230
I took the offer letter from Beijing

82
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:30,150
to talk to our company executives.

83
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,860
As soon as they heard I was leaving,

84
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,380
they immediately promoted me.

85
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:37,350
I'm now responsible for all designers
in the whole region.

86
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:40,150
About the position...

87
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:42,790
Director of Design Operations.

88
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,380
Wow, Ms. Lin, you're amazing.

89
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:49,150
You actually forced the company
to promote you.

90
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,180
This shows them my true value.

91
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,380
Mr. Yu.

92
00:06:55,150 --> 00:06:56,150
Call me Director Lin.

93
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,990
Director Lin.

94
00:07:08,751 --> 00:07:10,973
- Hello, Director Lin.
- Hello, Director Lin.

95
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,030
But speaking of which, Ms. Lin,

96
00:07:15,590 --> 00:07:16,710
even though you're staying,

97
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:18,150
you're no longer in charge of us.

98
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:19,230
Isn't that like leaving?

99
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:21,940
Then who will be responsible
for me and Mr. Yu?

100
00:07:23,030 --> 00:07:24,300
Miss Wang Xiaoxiao.

101
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:25,580
Me?

102
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:26,660
Yes.

103
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:27,790
Starting today,

104
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:29,470
you take over my previous role.

105
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:30,990
They are handed to you.

106
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,230
Then I got promoted, too.

107
00:07:35,820 --> 00:07:36,990
Thank you, Director Lin!

108
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,100
Tch!

109
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:41,684
After taking care of Wu,
I also have to manage Wang Xiaoxiao.

110
00:07:41,910 --> 00:07:42,750
So troublesome.

111
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,300
Both of them have improved now.

112
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,350
Only you are left.

113
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:50,590
Good luck, Mr. Yu.

114
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,350
I'll add you on WeChat.

115
00:07:57,395 --> 00:07:58,790
Our store has many events recently.

116
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,706
I'll send them to you.

117
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:00,820
Alright, thanks.

118
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:01,660
Okay.

119
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:03,990
Sent, all done.

120
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,850
Alright, bye.

121
00:08:04,850 --> 00:08:05,790
Bye.

122
00:08:10,528 --> 00:08:12,440
What's wrong? Thinking about something?

123
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,710
Wu already told me

124
00:08:17,060 --> 00:08:18,860
that Ms. Lin didn't leave.

125
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,550
She even got promoted.

126
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,740
She became even more powerful.

127
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,030
I really envy her so much.

128
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,260
When will I

129
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,060
also be able to handle things so easily?

130
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:30,580
President Xia.

131
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,230
Do you want stinky tofu for lunch today

132
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:34,500
or river snail rice noodles?

133
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,190
Stop dreaming.

134
00:08:37,640 --> 00:08:39,973
You should hurry up
and find a reliable boyfriend.

135
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,710
Fine.

136
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,500
A perfect boyfriend,

137
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,710
and a perfect roommate.

138
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,884
Which one should I choose?

139
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,470
Why can't you have both?

140
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:52,100
Hello?

141
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,980
Who is it?

142
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:57,590
My ex.

143
00:09:38,070 --> 00:09:38,910
Xiaoman.

144
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:41,830
It's me.

145
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,620
I already said we broke up.

146
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,900
When did we ever say we broke up?

147
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:50,990
But that's not important.

148
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,210
You know what?

149
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:53,350
While you were gone,

150
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,660
I really changed a lot.

151
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:57,070
I quit my old job.

152
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,380
I got a new one.

153
00:09:58,380 --> 00:09:59,220
I bought a car.

154
00:09:59,284 --> 00:10:00,862
I'm even planning to buy a house.

155
00:10:01,430 --> 00:10:03,110
We're not suitable.

156
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:05,260
We are. How are we not suitable?

157
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:07,590
That's it.

158
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,340
Xiaoman.

159
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,260
Xiaoman.

160
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:36,540
Let's get back together.

161
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:37,990
Get back together for what?

162
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,860
I'm begging you.

163
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:41,230
I already said we broke up.
Don't you understand?

164
00:10:41,230 --> 00:10:42,990
I'll kneel for you, okay?

165
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,430
Go away.

166
00:10:44,710 --> 00:10:46,350
Let's go. Come with me.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,700
Mr. Yu.

168
00:10:48,017 --> 00:10:49,220
- What's wrong?
- Help me.

169
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:50,580
Who are you?

170
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
Who is he?

171
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,440
You...

172
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,417
Is he your new lover?

173
00:10:53,462 --> 00:10:54,710
See? You haven't changed at all!

174
00:10:54,710 --> 00:10:55,773
- Get lost!
- You get lost!

175
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:56,850
No. You get lost.

176
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,070
Stop harassing her,
or I'll call the police.

177
00:10:59,195 --> 00:11:00,350
Call the police for what?

178
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:01,430
Pick that up.

179
00:11:01,462 --> 00:11:02,630
Mind your own business, huh?

180
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,500
Pick it up.

181
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,190
Go. Hurry, go.

182
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:12,140
My nose is broken!

183
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,350
I'm gonna kill you!

184
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:24,310
How dare you hit someone!

185
00:11:25,110 --> 00:11:26,140
How dare you hit someone!

186
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,230
I was saving a damsel in distress!

187
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,230
You're a designer.

188
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,860
If you act like this, who will hire you?

189
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,130
(Americano)
Usually, I already clean up your mess.

190
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,500
Now I have to pay fines
at the police station to bail you out.

191
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,595
Do you know you were wrong?

192
00:11:36,906 --> 00:11:38,070
Your memory's pretty good.

193
00:11:38,084 --> 00:11:40,017
That's exactly what I yelled
at Wu before.

194
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,340
Mr. Yu, do you know you were wrong?

195
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:46,270
Come back.

196
00:11:50,217 --> 00:11:51,500
Do you know you were wrong?

197
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,340
I was wrong.

198
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,910
Coffee. Triple shot.

199
00:12:01,230 --> 00:12:03,020
Xiaoxiao, learn from this.

200
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,070
That's how you tame these two
from now on.

201
00:12:13,017 --> 00:12:15,070
How did he still find this place
after so long?

202
00:12:15,310 --> 00:12:16,540
It's terrifying.

203
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,190
It really is a little scary.

204
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:24,380
Do you think I need
to change apartments?

205
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:25,590
Change for what?

206
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:26,860
Why should you hide from him?

207
00:12:26,906 --> 00:12:28,506
I'm telling you, if he dares come again,

208
00:12:28,573 --> 00:12:30,190
I'll slap him twice.

209
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:32,500
What is all this nonsense?

210
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,349
(Property Office)
The property office

211
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,400
sent over the surveillance video.

212
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,190
Let me see.

213
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:42,110
- Move.
- Hey, let me see.

214
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:42,969
Cast it to the screen.

215
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:43,484
Okay.

216
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:47,190
(Mr. Yu!)

217
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,190
(Help me!)

218
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:49,030
(What's wrong?)

219
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,780
(Who are you?)

220
00:12:51,230 --> 00:12:52,070
(Stop harassing her.)

221
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:53,009
(I'm calling the police.)

222
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,800
- (Why did you pull out your phone?)
- (Pick it up.)

223
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,620
(Nonsense. Mind your own business.)

224
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,860
Rewind five seconds before that move.

225
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,140
Let me watch it again.

226
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,190
Mr. Yu's move is really amazing.

227
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:10,950
Hey, play it again.

228
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:11,790
I want to see.

229
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,128
- (Pick it up for me.)
- (I won't.)

230
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:15,350
(Mind your own business, huh?)

231
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:50,900
I think...

232
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,470
I like Mr. Yu.

233
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,540
Now that I think about it,

234
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:11,070
he's always been helping me.

235
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,262
When I was drunk,

236
00:14:15,262 --> 00:14:17,110
he climbed such a high balcony

237
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:18,110
just to save me.

238
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,259
When I had appendicitis,

239
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:23,017
he was the one who took me
to the hospital.

240
00:14:24,830 --> 00:14:25,990
Even though he hates dogs,

241
00:14:27,190 --> 00:14:28,740
he still helped me take care of Dao.

242
00:14:30,306 --> 00:14:31,530
(Bill details)
When I had no money

243
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,728
to pay the property fee,

244
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,660
he even scolded my uncle.

245
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:41,620
He even humbled himself to ask
around for help selling the car.

246
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,620
You know his character.

247
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:47,110
Whenever he makes a mistake,

248
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:49,540
apologizing
is such a struggle for him.

249
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:52,780
It's hard to imagine...

250
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,540
For me,

251
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,350
he has to beg people for help.
It must have been so painful.

252
00:15:00,430 --> 00:15:03,900
Now, whenever something happens,

253
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:05,900
I'm not worried at all.

254
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,430
I just think...

255
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,020
Mr. Yu will definitely help me.

256
00:15:16,140 --> 00:15:16,990
Before,

257
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,070
I always wanted to find a man
I could rely on,

258
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:23,620
someone who could take care of me.

259
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:25,830
But...

260
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:29,620
I didn't expect it would be him.

261
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:41,660
♪Falling in love with someone
who doesn't come home♪

262
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,110
But you've fallen in love with someone
who won't let you into his home.

263
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,990
I like him.

264
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,830
Love is the next step.

265
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,310
The next step should be
to confess to him first.

266
00:15:57,110 --> 00:15:57,950
Confess?

267
00:15:58,973 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm afraid he'll ridicule me to death.

268
00:16:00,684 --> 00:16:02,706
Exactly, you already know
what kind of person he is.

269
00:16:02,728 --> 00:16:03,950
Why do you still like him?

270
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:07,470
I'm the only one who knows
how good he is.

271
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,860
Like he's my little treasure.

272
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:13,660
Don't you think this feeling
is really thrilling?

273
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,020
Well...

274
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,620
He's really handsome.

275
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:21,110
I swear,

276
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,620
I'll never meet a better man
than him again.

277
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:25,660
Good.

278
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:27,710
Those guys...

279
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,740
What is all this?

280
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,350
Comparing goods makes you
throw them away.

281
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,860
Comparing people makes you die.

282
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:43,190
If anyone speaks badly of him again,
I'm leaving the group.

283
00:16:43,190 --> 00:16:45,110
Wow, okay, fine.

284
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:47,190
Since you're so obsessed,
I won't stop you.

285
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:48,380
Excuse me.

286
00:16:48,710 --> 00:16:49,990
One glass of whiskey.

287
00:16:50,830 --> 00:16:52,110
Right, Dao?

288
00:16:53,540 --> 00:16:54,900
Come. For this lady.

289
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,110
Miss, your whiskey.

290
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,070
Don't drink that cocktail.

291
00:16:59,070 --> 00:17:00,990
Just finish this whiskey, okay?

292
00:17:01,260 --> 00:17:03,230
Before you decide he's
the only one for you,

293
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:04,430
hurry and confess to him.

294
00:17:04,506 --> 00:17:05,710
Don't care about the results.

295
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,430
Just go for it, okay?

296
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,380
Okay.

297
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,950
Don't care about the results!

298
00:17:59,406 --> 00:18:01,300
Hi, would you like to subscribe
to daily fresh milk?

299
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:03,200
If you subscribe, you'll get
a laundry detergent set.

300
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:03,990
I don't spit up milk.

301
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,630
No, I didn't mean that.

302
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,140
Sorry.

303
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:09,740
The woman behind you looks like
she's about to vomit.

304
00:18:09,773 --> 00:18:11,217
Go ask her to subscribe.

305
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,500
You actually subscribed.

306
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:36,660
What's going on?

307
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,140
Oh, no.

308
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:43,820
Turn around.

309
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:47,260
The alcohol is too strong.

310
00:18:59,630 --> 00:19:01,500
I just want to thank you.

311
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:03,100
Thank me for what?

312
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:08,500
Just for taking care of me
and helping me all the time.

313
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:10,550
So?

314
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,540
Oh, okay.

315
00:19:16,540 --> 00:19:17,870
I knew you liked me.

316
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,200
I...

317
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:25,390
Maybe I like you, I guess.

318
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:29,710
So you didn't really like me.

319
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,230
You foodie.

320
00:19:31,780 --> 00:19:32,620
Hmph.

321
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,060
It's true.

322
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:35,300
Turn around.

323
00:19:35,928 --> 00:19:37,260
The alcohol is too strong.

324
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,190
If it's true,

325
00:19:42,020 --> 00:19:43,190
what would you think?

326
00:19:43,795 --> 00:19:45,100
If it's true, then it's true.

327
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:49,340
What do you mean?

328
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:52,390
What do you mean?

329
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,470
What kind of attitude is this?

330
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:56,630
What attitude do I have?

331
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:58,470
You...

332
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:16,470
This is ridiculous.

333
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:22,870
I think I drank fake alcohol...

334
00:20:22,870 --> 00:20:24,340
Fake alcohol? What?

335
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:27,150
With your tolerance, passing out
after one glass is normal, isn't it?

336
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:28,780
Here, have some fruit.

337
00:20:31,870 --> 00:20:33,540
So, did you confess?

338
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:34,620
Yes, I did.

339
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:35,470
Then...

340
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,780
What did he say?

341
00:20:37,870 --> 00:20:40,190
He just said, "If you like, then like."

342
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:43,060
That's definitely his style.

343
00:20:46,390 --> 00:20:50,100
What do you think he means?

344
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:53,430
Who knows?

345
00:20:54,630 --> 00:20:57,260
Do you think he accepted me?

346
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,430
Hard to say.

347
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:11,910
It's all your fault for making me
drink so much.

348
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:15,950
I finally confessed at his doorstep,

349
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:17,780
and I don't remember all his reactions.

350
00:21:17,990 --> 00:21:19,710
I don't even remember his tone.

351
00:21:19,710 --> 00:21:20,990
Alright.

352
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,230
Don't cry.

353
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:24,870
This is also why I didn't want you
to go then.

354
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,100
Think about it.
He already knows you like him.

355
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,820
Then why hasn't he reacted at all?

356
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,620
Why?

357
00:21:32,710 --> 00:21:34,470
Because he doesn't like you.

358
00:21:34,470 --> 00:21:36,300
He just wants to be friends.

359
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:41,740
Lately, you've really been
too carried away,

360
00:21:41,740 --> 00:21:42,820
too impulsive.

361
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,260
If you keep this up,

362
00:21:44,260 --> 00:21:46,780
you might do something you'll regret.

363
00:21:48,150 --> 00:21:50,540
Then tell me, what should I do?

364
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:51,990
Well...

365
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,100
Our company is doing training soon.

366
00:21:54,262 --> 00:21:56,017
We'll have to stay in Beijing
for a month.

367
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:59,150
I think you can
change your environment,

368
00:21:59,150 --> 00:22:00,950
and your mood.

369
00:22:01,910 --> 00:22:04,710
Then, after you calm down,
you can think about what to do.

370
00:22:06,950 --> 00:22:09,260
Why is my allowance so low
this month again?

371
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,430
Are you deliberately saying this
in front of my brother?

372
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,630
Thinking I'd lose face?

373
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:16,780
Hoping for more? Dream on.

374
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,030
Yu,

375
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,230
say a few words for me.

376
00:22:21,351 --> 00:22:22,580
What did I tell you to do?

377
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:25,660
Yu.

378
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,620
Oh.

379
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,230
Get a divorce, huh?

380
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,260
I wasted a meal on you.

381
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,390
Have you heard about Mom going
to a nursing home?

382
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:39,950
I didn't know.

383
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,740
She did say that.

384
00:22:44,540 --> 00:22:45,630
You knew it all along?

385
00:22:46,230 --> 00:22:47,630
Then why didn't you persuade her?

386
00:22:47,630 --> 00:22:49,262
Living at our house is so comfortable.

387
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,580
I also think it's fine.

388
00:22:51,190 --> 00:22:52,340
It's just that she feels

389
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:54,349
that a mother-in-law living
with her son-in-law

390
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,260
is a bit inappropriate.

391
00:22:55,260 --> 00:22:56,300
How could that be?

392
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,950
We all welcome her.

393
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,020
Right, Honey?

394
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:00,870
Yes, we really do welcome her.

395
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,020
Welcome, right?

396
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:05,630
Alright, I'll invite her back.

397
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:06,470
Wait for a second.

398
00:23:07,670 --> 00:23:10,390
We also have to consider
her own thoughts.

399
00:23:11,470 --> 00:23:12,310
Right?

400
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:20,430
It's all because of you.

401
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,230
If you got married,

402
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:23,430
Mom could live elsewhere.

403
00:23:23,462 --> 00:23:26,340
Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law conflicts
are also one reason I'm not marrying.

404
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,060
Just find a woman
who won't quarrel with Mom.

405
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,380
- Is that impossible?
- Where?

406
00:23:29,390 --> 00:23:31,340
- Even if I found one, I wouldn't marry.
- Why not?

407
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:33,470
Finally, a woman likes you,
and you still won't marry.

408
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:36,100
A real man doesn't rely
on others for allowance.

409
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:37,830
What?

410
00:23:38,430 --> 00:23:39,300
You two are bickering.

411
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:40,820
What does it have to do with me?

412
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:45,990
Mr. Yu, it seems that the female client
who wanted dough figurines

413
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,670
is pretty satisfied with your design.

414
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,670
She really made a set for you.

415
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:51,530
Why didn't she do it for me
after paying her?

416
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:54,950
If you didn't like it,

417
00:23:54,950 --> 00:23:56,840
you wouldn't accept these
even if she pays you.

418
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,550
Hey,

419
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,470
Ms. Lin.

420
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,870
Congratulations to Mr. Yu.

421
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,780
What, Mr. Yu is expecting?

422
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:10,470
Mr. Yu has been shortlisted
for Shanghai Annual Best Designer.

423
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,740
Wow.

424
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,910
So impressive, Mr. Yu.

425
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,710
I checked
the other shortlisted candidates.

426
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,430
Mr. Yu winning this award
is almost guaranteed.

427
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,900
(Invitation Letter)

428
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,150
It's just a small award.

429
00:24:23,195 --> 00:24:25,150
If you think it's small,
don't have to take it.

430
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,100
Honestly, I didn't really want to go.

431
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,150
But if you insist I go,

432
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:30,870
then I'll go.

433
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:36,340
The craftsmanship is really exquisite.

434
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:41,140
(Basics of Architectural Design)

435
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:53,990
I can't treat you anymore.

436
00:24:53,990 --> 00:24:55,284
You need to see a neurologist.

437
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:57,900
Here.

438
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:00,300
Don't touch it. Just look.

439
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
I won't look.

440
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,951
Then I'll read it out loud.

441
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,430
Shanghai Annual Best Designer
Awards Ceremony.

442
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:09,580
You won?

443
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,300
Of course I will.

444
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,990
So confident?

445
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,990
It's rigged?

446
00:25:15,230 --> 00:25:16,070
No way.

447
00:25:16,340 --> 00:25:17,340
This award,

448
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,060
is fair and open.

449
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:20,870
But the winner is definitely me.

450
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,580
Then I wish you all the best.

451
00:25:26,751 --> 00:25:27,910
Why are you staring at me?

452
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:30,310
It's for you.

453
00:25:34,620 --> 00:25:36,260
(Invitation Letter, Gu Yejia)

454
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:39,780
You want me to accompany you
to the awards ceremony?

455
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,820
No, I just want to show you the world.

456
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,740
"If you really want to see the world,"

457
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,670
"I can take you."

458
00:25:49,751 --> 00:25:50,820
You should have said that.

459
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,860
What's wrong, Mr. Yu?

460
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:52,790
Forgot your lines?

461
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:55,300
If you don't go,

462
00:25:55,951 --> 00:25:56,990
then I won't go either.

463
00:25:57,580 --> 00:25:58,420
What?

464
00:25:58,780 --> 00:25:59,870
Why?

465
00:26:00,630 --> 00:26:01,950
Your name is on it.

466
00:26:02,084 --> 00:26:03,430
I can't give it to someone else.

467
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:05,630
If a stranger sat next to me,

468
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:08,060
I'd have to shake her hand properly
when I win,

469
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,990
hug her, maybe even exchange WeChat.

470
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:13,020
I'd have to endure her admiring gaze,

471
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,740
asking me stupid questions.

472
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,820
But if it's you,

473
00:26:16,190 --> 00:26:17,030
then it's fine.

474
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:20,500
Do I normally ask stupid questions?

475
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:21,340
See?

476
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:25,230
Then why didn't you
take Lin Sa with you?

477
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,070
Hmph.

478
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,630
She's now Director Lin.

479
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:29,430
Not a match anymore.

480
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:32,870
So...

481
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,060
Beg me.

482
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:36,100
What?

483
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:05,910
Ms. Gu Yejia,

485

at the awards ceremony.

488

Here you go.

489
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,560
- Okay.
- Bye.

in a video online?

to win this year's Best Newcomer Award.

542

Receiving this award

543
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,190
is very meaningful to me.

The winner

556
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,230
is Yu Yu.

557
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,260
Yu Yu's "Warm Zone" concept

558
00:31:11,284 --> 00:31:13,390
has attracted widespread attention
and discussion,

559
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,910
becoming a highlight
in today's design world.

560
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:18,500
It not only demonstrates
high professional standards,

561
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:19,630
but also

562
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:23,710
shows his deep understanding
and leadership of future design trends.

563
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:27,540
Please welcome Yu Yu to the stage
to receive the award.

564
00:31:34,780 --> 00:31:35,630
Yu Yu.

565
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:39,580
On his application form,
Mr. Yu described himself

566
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,100
as "I don't eat fish."

567
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,780
Yu Yu also wrote his personal motto,

568
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:51,230
"Yu Yu wishes for fish;
the fish shall be Yu Yu's."

569
00:31:51,950 --> 00:31:53,670
Yu Yu is quite witty.

570
00:31:54,780 --> 00:31:59,060

to the stage to accept his award.

not just because of this award,

577
00:32:34,506 --> 00:32:35,870
but because I have the chance

578
00:32:35,870 --> 00:32:38,260
to share the "Warm Zone" concept
with more peers,

579
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:40,500
allowing more people
to have warmer homes.

580
00:32:40,710 --> 00:32:41,820
Everyone here is an insider.

581
00:32:41,951 --> 00:32:43,740

naturally understand.

582

583

Once you fly solo,
you can slack off openly.

587
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,190
Exactly.

588

660
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:36,750
then she fainted.

00:38:04,540 --> 00:38:05,500
I'm here.

Mom.

670
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,910
I'm fine.

671
00:38:36,350 --> 00:38:38,910
I just saw the Naihe Bridge.

672
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:43,100
I was holding that bowl of soup,

673
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:44,220
and I was thinking,

674
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,470
my son isn't married yet.

675
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,270
I can't die like this.

676
00:38:53,580 --> 00:38:56,180
Mom, don't be so superstitious.

677
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:58,020
I told Meng Po...

678
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,430
I can't go.

679
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:02,950
I have to go back.

680
00:39:03,950 --> 00:39:06,180
My son isn't married yet.

681
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:08,310
He hasn't started a family.

682
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:10,540
If I die like this,

683
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:12,020
what will he do?

684
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:14,620
Who will take care of him?

685
00:39:17,390 --> 00:39:19,350
So I made a deal with Meng Po.

686
00:39:22,140 --> 00:39:25,390
I'll come after my son
gets married, okay?

687
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:29,430
Meng Po is really kind.

688
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:32,950
She drank the soup herself.

689
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:36,390
She also told me,

690
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:39,470
"Go back."

691
00:39:40,870 --> 00:39:42,790
"I'll forget that you were here."

692
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:51,430
You're just too young.

693
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:57,470
You can't understand the feeling

694
00:39:59,870 --> 00:40:02,270
of loneliness when one gets old.

695
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:09,290

- Yes.
- It's great.

698
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:15,220
I plan to move in.

699
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,420
What?

700
00:40:16,950 --> 00:40:18,270
Why not stay at Yu Jie's place?

701
00:40:18,790 --> 00:40:20,660
That's Zhong Liangchuan's home.

702
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,270
It's not good to bother them.

703
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,430
I'll just live well

704
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,220
and keep taking care of you.

705
00:40:27,728 --> 00:40:29,830
I don't want to live
in a retirement home with you.

706

It's too expensive.

707

a "thank you" from you directly

709

is Mrs. Yu.

710
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:26,310
I realize something about you.

711
00:41:26,462 --> 00:41:27,870
The more you care about someone,

712
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,180
the more easily you anger them.

713
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,220
That's not a good habit.

714

715
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:34,620

Not funny.
