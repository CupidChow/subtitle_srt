I really wasn't talking
about you just now.

42
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:51,270
I'm not that upset.

43
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:54,506
It's just that the way you speak
can be really embarrassing sometimes.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:55,860
No.

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,020
I didn't hear any of that.

46
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,830
All I heard was something
about a car rusting.

47
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,990
I didn't know anything else.

48
00:03:01,017 --> 00:03:02,550
So I'm talking about the car, not you.

49
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:03,740
And you actually

50
00:03:05,270 --> 00:03:06,230
still look

51
00:03:06,830 --> 00:03:07,790
pretty young.

52
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:09,230
What do you mean by "look"?

53
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:11,300
Oh, I mean, you really are young.

54
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:17,830
Why are you standing outside?

55
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:21,510
Come on in and join us.

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,070

00:03:30,830 --> 00:03:32,510
Don't you want a drink to loosen up?

58
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,070
This is my friend's place.

59
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:36,900

61
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:39,390
How should I address you?

62
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:41,070
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

63
00:03:41,270 --> 00:03:42,460
Oh, Miss Gu.

64
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:46,580
Your friend?

65
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:54,350
Ah, yes.

66
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,350
I'm his friend.

67
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,350
Oh, really?

68
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,350
You guys chat.

69
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,460
Alright.

70
00:04:05,751 --> 00:04:07,110
Have you ever been to Africa?

71
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:09,510
Ah?

72
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:11,620
No.

73
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,700
I think you're great.

74
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:14,180
Ah?

75
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:15,070
Come by more often.

76
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:16,551
Have you been to our shop before?

77
00:04:20,062 --> 00:04:21,710
It's fine. Feel free to come anytime.

78
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,550
Okay.

79
00:04:24,195 --> 00:04:25,990
"The Great Escape" Collector's Edition.

80
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:26,990
It's for you.

81
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,500
Don't you have other things to do?

82
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,550
You're the only table of guests tonight.

83
00:04:36,795 --> 00:04:38,620
Then go find something else
to keep busy.

84
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,470
Need help?

85
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,620
No, thank you.

86
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:44,470
Alright then.

87
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,990
Why are you giving me this?

88
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:53,300
Consider it

89
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,150
a little gift between friends.

90
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,017
You don't have
to give me anything in return.

91
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:01,110
It can also be my way of making amends.

92
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,470
"Making amends" includes
both manners and etiquette.

93
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:05,910
It also implies a gift.

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,710
Well, thank you then.

95
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,990
Who even watches DVDs these days?

96
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,670
Oh, this isn't a DVD.

97
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:16,670
Come with me.

98
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:20,500
These are all Blu-ray movies.

99
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,820
You can buy or rent them.

100
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,380
What era is this?

101
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:26,217
Does anyone even watch discs anymore?

102
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,640
Just because you don't watch them
doesn't mean no one does.

103
00:05:28,684 --> 00:05:29,462
Let me tell you,

104
00:05:29,462 --> 00:05:31,060
every field has its enthusiasts.

105
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,300
These enthusiasts

106
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,030
would spend 99% more money

107
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:35,670
for just a one percent improvement.

108
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,380
Enthusiasts? What do you mean?

109
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,150
They're hobbyists.

110
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:41,817
They go all out on all sorts of gadgets.

111
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,620
Blu-ray movies like these

112
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:45,500
are a favorite
among audio-visual enthusiasts.

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:49,860
Then what am I supposed to use

114
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,060
to watch this disc?

115
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:52,590
I don't have a player at home.

116
00:05:52,940 --> 00:05:54,350
Can I use my laptop?

117
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,670
A laptop's screen is

118
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,670
just A4-sized.

119
00:05:56,670 --> 00:05:57,773
You use it to watch films?

120
00:05:57,817 --> 00:06:01,030
There's an idiom called wasting heaven's
gifts and that's exactly what this is.

121
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:02,820
You've been to a cinema before.

122
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:04,973
You should know
that the bigger the screen, the better.

123
00:06:05,884 --> 00:06:07,595
Then what do you
usually use to watch them?

124
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:08,620
I use a Blu-ray player

125
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:09,790
and a big projector.

126
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,790
These were all shot on film.

127
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:13,470
You need a large projector

128
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:14,860
to really show their texture.

129
00:06:14,884 --> 00:06:15,990
And the sense of ceremony.

130
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:18,990
Okay, I'll buy one tomorrow.

131
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,230
Alright.

132
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,150
Where can I get one?

133
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:22,230
I have one here.

134
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,110

135

I'll give you 30% off. Is that okay?

00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:33,620
Ah...

138
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,300

00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:38,670
turn it on?

185
00:08:39,110 --> 00:08:40,110
I like watching ads.

186
00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:42,470
Hmph, you must regret it,

187
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,470
but won't admit it.

188
00:08:46,430 --> 00:08:47,430
You can leave now.

189
00:08:47,950 --> 00:08:49,430
Didn't you check if it's okay?

190
00:08:53,020 --> 00:08:53,860
Well...

191
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,750
Is this better?

192
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:55,710
Much better.

193
00:08:56,350 --> 00:08:57,350
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

194
00:08:57,350 --> 00:08:58,620
Move it gently yourself.

195
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,550
All done?

196
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:01,580
Yes.

197
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:03,230
By the way...

198
00:09:04,830 --> 00:09:06,310
The movie I gave you, did you like it?

199
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,990
Yes, it was good.

200
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:09,380
Classy taste.

Elegant and intellectual women

207
00:09:49,350 --> 00:09:51,110
just love watching these romantic films.

208
00:09:53,830 --> 00:09:54,670
Hey.

209
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:57,310
The last time Mr. Yu
gave you "The Great Escape,"

210
00:09:57,310 --> 00:09:58,150
did you finish it?

211
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,540
That movie?

212
00:09:59,540 --> 00:10:01,310
I fell asleep in less than ten minutes.

213
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,150
Oh really?

214
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:04,860
You liar.

215
00:10:04,995 --> 00:10:06,230
And you told me it was good.

216
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,260
I was just being polite.

217
00:10:23,310 --> 00:10:24,150
Hey.

00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,380
What?

219
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:27,660
Settle your friend's bill.

220

Me?

221
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:31,660
How much?

222
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,500
45 yuan.

223

- Ah!

227
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:04,350
You scared me.

228
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,260
Are you crazy?

229
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,710
I'm fine now.

230

00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,070
don't stand behind me
and scare me again.

Hey.

234

This apartment isn't bad.

Which one?

236
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:20,020
See? You really want to buy a place.

237
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,590
How is this not bad?

238
00:11:22,706 --> 00:11:23,740
It's not that big either.

239
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:25,470
Oh, you want a bigger one.

240
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:26,950
Got it.

241
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:29,590
You're thinking,
what if you accidentally get married

242
00:11:29,590 --> 00:11:31,310
and have to live with that man, right?

243
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,430
What do you mean
"accidentally get married"?

244
00:11:36,470 --> 00:11:37,860
100 square meters is too small?

245
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,540
Rich people, huh.

246
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,950
You're a top designer.

247
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,830
But I've always wondered,

248
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:45,710
for such a famous designer like you,

249
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:47,590
why live in such a small place?

250
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,660
And it's not soundproof.

251
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,500
Oh.

252
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,590
I calculated it.

253
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,910
By myself,

254
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:53,470
I only need a space this size.

255
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,830
As for soundproofing,

256
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,470
that's just Xiaoman's uncle's

257
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,380

00:11:58,380 --> 00:11:59,540

00:12:00,217 --> 00:12:02,470
Yesterday, I was browsing online,
and by chance,

260
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,540
I saw one of your peers, Ou Yang.

261
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,710
He lives in a huge villa.

262
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,230
That's an exception.

263
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,830
He's the exception, or are you?

264
00:12:14,190 --> 00:12:15,030
Oh right.

265
00:12:15,380 --> 00:12:18,140
I also bought the collector's edition
of "The Great Escape."

266
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,830

I'll watch it ten times.

It's Dao who is troubling you.

307
00:13:52,710 --> 00:13:54,710
Is that Mr. Yu's nickname?

Yes.

309

Pretty good name, right?

311
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,430
But when he grew up,

312
00:14:02,430 --> 00:14:05,500
he thought it didn't fit
his designer identity,

313
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,260
so he changed it to Yu Yu.

314
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,710

315
00:14:09,710 --> 00:14:11,310
Sounds like a coachman, right?

318
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:18,830
I mean the name.

00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,470
My son is just too introverted.

Your son is introverted?

321
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:28,780
Isn't he introverted in front of you?

quite well in his career.

I'll prescribe some medication.

340
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:31,830
You should also watch your diet.

341
00:15:32,230 --> 00:15:34,110
Measure your blood pressure at home,

00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:45,990
Nothing much.

346
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:46,950
It's not serious.

347
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:47,950
Alright.

348
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:53,470
Bro, why aren't you saying anything?

349
00:15:54,190 --> 00:15:56,950
I don't borrow money from others,
and I don't lend either.

350
00:15:57,990 --> 00:15:59,070
Why say it twice?

351
00:15:59,106 --> 00:16:00,110
Think about it yourself.

352
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:02,190
Lend me some?

a financial crisis this month.

354

00:16:06,284 --> 00:16:07,551
Isn't it your sister's fault?

356
00:16:08,110 --> 00:16:10,230
She only gives me
2,000 pocket money a month.

357
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:12,540
2,000 is not that little.

358
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:15,860
In New Guinea,
that could save a whole tribe.

359
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:19,190
Actually, there are many
wonderful things in life

360
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,470

require money to experience.

363

Stop.

364
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,590
No need to show off
your single life to me.

365
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:29,070
Just say it, will you lend or not?

366
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:34,670
Alright.

367
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:36,840
Then I'll tell Mom

368
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,900
that you keep going
to the hospital to see Gu Yejia.

00:16:45,990 --> 00:16:47,660
Alright, I'll give it to you later.

370
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:50,020
Thanks, my dear brother.

371
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:52,860
What are you two doing?

372
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,884
Aren't you going to eat?

373
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,430
Nothing much, just...

374
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:57,217
I'll take him to wash his hands.

375
00:16:57,262 --> 00:17:00,100
Can you believe someone this grown-up
still doesn't like cleanliness?

376
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,140
You'll lead him?

377
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,230
He never listens.

378
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:05,230
Financial freedom isn't
about how much you earn,

379
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:07,060
but how much you can freely spend.

380
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:08,100
For example,

381
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,430
I can spend 6,000 a month,

382
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,270
and you spend 3,000.

383
00:17:10,270 --> 00:17:11,284
Then I'm richer than you.

384
00:17:11,284 --> 00:17:12,950
Even if your monthly salary
is ten times mine.

385
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:13,790
Oh, bro,

386
00:17:13,950 --> 00:17:15,580
stop your twisted logic.

387
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:16,870
Let's eat.

388
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:20,950
The money you earn
while single is truly yours.

389
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:24,470
After marriage,
your earnings get eaten up by your wife,

390
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:26,580
children, house, and car.

391
00:17:26,590 --> 00:17:27,430
Poor you.

392
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:29,740
If you want to give a speech,
go stand on TV and say it.

393
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,740
We're eating here.

394
00:17:30,740 --> 00:17:32,740
What wife and kids spending money?

395
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:34,990
That's just an excuse
for not getting married.

396
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:37,190
Listen to me,
you should get married too.

397
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,630
You got married, and you
keep telling others to get married.

398
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,710
Is marriage MLM?

399
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:43,060
Are you recruiting downlines?

400
00:17:43,670 --> 00:17:44,510
Ignore him.

401
00:17:44,817 --> 00:17:46,470
His downline doesn't need recruiting.

402
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:47,470
He'll marry soon.

403
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,180
How do you know?

404
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,780
Which fortune teller told you that?

405
00:17:50,780 --> 00:17:51,670
I want to report him.

406
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:54,060
I'm telling you, Yejia is really great.

407
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,300
Good-looking,

408
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,262
has a great temperament,
and is well-mannered.

409
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,500
Professionally decent.

410
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,100
Mom likes her very much.

411
00:18:01,630 --> 00:18:02,500
How do you know her?

412
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,260
You're so silly.

413
00:18:05,430 --> 00:18:06,630
So convenient.

414
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:08,020
Just introduce her to me directly.

415
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,670
I won't lend the money. I'm telling you.

416
00:18:12,884 --> 00:18:14,390
You're borrowing from my brother again?

417
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,820
No, he's talking nonsense.

418
00:18:16,820 --> 00:18:18,230
Don't interrupt.

419
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,580
I'm talking about Yejia.

420
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:22,580
Yejia thinks very highly
of your brother.

421
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,060
How so?

422
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,190
Outgoing.

423
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:27,260
- Outgoing?
- Yes.

424
00:18:27,260 --> 00:18:28,150
That counts as a merit?

425
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:29,870
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

426
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,150
Oh, yes.

427
00:18:35,950 --> 00:18:36,790
Foodie.

428
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,060
What are you thinking?

429
00:18:40,617 --> 00:18:41,910
I'm not thinking about anything.

430
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:43,870
I'm full. You can take your time.

431
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:51,260
(Ten-thousand Dingmao Year Noodles)

432
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,190
Dr. Gu.

433
00:18:52,190 --> 00:18:53,580
Oh, sorry.

434
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,020
Could you please hold onto
the fan for me?

435
00:18:56,580 --> 00:18:57,820
Do not send it by courier.

436
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:00,300
I'll have my son pick it up personally.

437
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:02,190
Thanks a lot.

438
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,230
I'll have my son
treat you to coffee then.

439
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,910
That's the situation.

440
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:09,100
But I don't want to

441
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:11,060
see him again just for this fan.

442
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,300
You can help me give it to him.

443
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:13,300
Your homes are so close.

444
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,150
I?

445
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,230
This fan is so valuable.

446
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:18,580
Forget it, I'm poor anyway.

447
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:21,540
If anything happens along the way,
I can't afford it.

448
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,900
Moreover...

449
00:19:24,820 --> 00:19:26,950
Auntie is just trying to set you two up.

450
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,230
Oh, no way.

451
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:30,500
If something happens

452
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,710
to the fan along the way,
I'll take responsibility.

453
00:19:32,910 --> 00:19:34,670
Please just help me
give it to him, okay?

454
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:38,470
I'm not helping with this favor.

455
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:44,380
(Yu Yu)

456
00:19:44,540 --> 00:19:45,380
Hey.

457
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:46,910
Look who's calling.

458
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,580
Speak of the devil.

459
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:50,300
Quick, answer it.

460
00:19:50,630 --> 00:19:51,990
Speakerphone, I'll listen.

461
00:19:54,390 --> 00:19:55,340
Hello?

462
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:56,180
Done with work?

463
00:19:57,260 --> 00:19:58,100
Yes.

464
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:01,540
(Yu Yu)
Eating noodles right now?

465
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,617
If it's important, just say it.

466
00:20:07,910 --> 00:20:09,190
My mom contacted you.

467
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,390
Mm-hmm.

468
00:20:10,390 --> 00:20:11,773
I don't have time tomorrow either.

469
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:14,430
But if you really want me to see you...

470
00:20:14,430 --> 00:20:16,430
It's not like I really want to meet you.

471
00:20:16,950 --> 00:20:18,260
You took my mom's fan.

472
00:20:18,580 --> 00:20:20,740
It's your mom who left it at my place.

473
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,670
Here's the deal.
I'll give you three options.

474
00:20:23,951 --> 00:20:25,440
Option one, send me the address,

475
00:20:25,506 --> 00:20:26,730
and I'll send it via express.

476
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:28,430
Option two,
you come pick it up yourself.

477
00:20:28,710 --> 00:20:30,950
Option three, get a third party to help.

478
00:20:31,062 --> 00:20:32,100
My noodles will get cold.

479
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,710
Decide and tell me. Bye.

480
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:37,470
Exactly, he's such a proud person.

481
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:38,330
I'm telling you,

482
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,740
every time he speaks, I just...

483
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:41,750
Exactly.

484
00:20:48,470 --> 00:20:50,020
The hospital system told me

485
00:20:51,670 --> 00:20:54,500
Mr. Yu Yu booked me for next Monday.

486
00:20:57,630 --> 00:20:58,470
Okay.

487
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:01,390
He's clever, choosing the fourth option.

488
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:03,190
I'll give him a call.

489
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:09,260
What's up now?

490
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:11,500
If it's just about picking up the fan,

491
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,500
I suggest you cancel the appointment.

492
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,870
Don't waste public resources.

493
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:15,910
I'm off tomorrow.

494
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:16,750
I can meet you.

495
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,670
I'm not insisting
on taking public resources,

496
00:21:18,670 --> 00:21:19,870
nor insisting on seeing you.

497
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:22,230
But if you really want to see me...

498
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:27,150
Fine, since you already made plans,

499
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,100
I won't be the go-between.

500
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:31,670
It's getting late.

501
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,260
I'm going to my part-time job.

502
00:21:33,395 --> 00:21:35,217
Since when did you
start a part-time job?

503
00:21:36,910 --> 00:21:37,910
Long story.

504
00:21:38,060 --> 00:21:39,740
I'll tell you later. Gotta go.

505
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,340
Bye, take care.

506
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:02,340
The fan.

507
00:22:04,017 --> 00:22:05,740
Do you think
you can scare me every time?

508
00:22:05,995 --> 00:22:07,030
You actually did scare.

509
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:15,540
Hey, can you stop
standing behind me all the time?

510
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,140
Sit down.

511
00:22:20,670 --> 00:22:21,510
Wow.

512
00:22:22,190 --> 00:22:23,030
Milk tea.

513
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:28,910
Chocolate, sugar, pearls,
and coconut jelly.

514
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,710
How much do you weigh?

515
00:22:31,728 --> 00:22:32,790
Mind your own business.

516
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,950
Look at me,
my green drink is so healthy.

517
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:03,870
Your bag is really messy.

518
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,750
What's this?

519
00:23:06,990 --> 00:23:07,830
Which one?

520
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,100
This one.

521
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,260
This spray is for hydration.

522
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:14,910
The relative humidity today is 64%.

523
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:16,300
Is your face a desert?

524
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,340
Such a big bag,
yet you pack so many useless things.

525
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,150
Ugh, you're even more annoying today.

526
00:23:25,262 --> 00:23:27,506
I'm just trying to stop my mom
from getting her way.

527
00:23:35,230 --> 00:23:36,230
I forgot the fan.

528
00:23:36,230 --> 00:23:37,070
Ah?

529
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,870
Weren't you coming today
just to return the fan?

530
00:23:40,870 --> 00:23:41,951
And you still forgot it?

531
00:23:42,230 --> 00:23:44,950
I changed my jacket when I left.

532
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,780
I put the fan in that jacket pocket.

533
00:23:46,780 --> 00:23:48,100
I didn't put it in my bag.

534
00:23:48,170 --> 00:23:49,060
Alright.

535
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:49,990
With your bag,

536
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,260
you would forget it
even if it was inside.

537
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:54,900
Look at mine.

538
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:57,740
It has compartments.

539
00:23:57,906 --> 00:24:00,020
Everything is clearly organized
and easy to find.

540
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:01,910
This pocket is for a notebook.

541
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,190
This one is for a wallet.

542
00:24:04,670 --> 00:24:07,470
Everything has its place.

543
00:24:08,260 --> 00:24:10,500
I suggest you get the same one as mine.

544
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:13,190
Or better, get one for Auntie too.

545
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,710
She has the same problem as I.

546
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:16,300
She's forgetful.

547
00:24:20,990 --> 00:24:21,830
Goodbye.

548
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,100
Green means health.

549
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,230
I won't.

550
00:24:46,630 --> 00:24:47,500
Morning, Ms. Lin.

551
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,340
Morning.

552
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:49,420
What's up?

553
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:51,670
Hit the tennis ball too far?

554
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,990
I was the one who threw it.

555
00:24:56,630 --> 00:24:59,260
My love life is all sweet,
no bitterness.

556
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:00,420
Hmph.

557
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,470
Then next time, try baseball.

558
00:25:02,795 --> 00:25:03,950
Enough with the ball talk.

559
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:06,580
You really think
a breakup would upset me?

560
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,550
Fine.

561
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:09,470
The client has another problem.

562
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:12,500
The client lost their job.

563
00:25:12,751 --> 00:25:14,300
They want to cut the budget by 50,000.

564
00:25:14,670 --> 00:25:15,510
Ah?

565
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:16,510
What?

566
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,820
I already finished the design.

567
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:20,240
Now they tell me they have no money.

568
00:25:20,780 --> 00:25:22,260
They suddenly lost their job

569
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:23,340
and can't spend too much.

570
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,950
Then get another job.

571
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,820
Easier said than done.

572
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:29,060
Nothing in the adult world comes easy.

573
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:32,300
Easy to go bald,
gain weight, or go broke.

574
00:25:32,500 --> 00:25:34,390
Hard to find a wife too.

575
00:25:34,395 --> 00:25:36,020
Mature people either learn to compliment

576
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:36,870
or learn to shut up.

577
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,260
You're fine just the way you are.

578
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,910
Mr. Yu, how about we leave
this kitchen wall as it is?

579
00:25:44,230 --> 00:25:46,580
If we don't knock it down,
it should save 50,000.

580
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,260
Yeah, isn't that great?

581
00:25:48,470 --> 00:25:50,060
It won't affect your design either.

582
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,300
If you're so casual about it,

583
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,780
then hire another designer.

584
00:25:55,780 --> 00:25:56,630
Why hire me?

585
00:25:57,710 --> 00:26:00,670
One small compromise
won't affect your design vision.

586
00:26:00,670 --> 00:26:02,390
No, let him find someone else.

587
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:03,820
Come on, Mr. Yu.

588
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,990
Are you really going to
give up 250,000 for 50,000?

589
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:07,870
If we do that,
we won't get a single cent.

590
00:26:08,060 --> 00:26:09,230
It's about my principle.

591
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:10,670
It's about my survival.

592
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:11,740
I make the call here.

593
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,740
Please, Mr. Yu.

594
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:14,580
If we do this,

595
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:15,950
I won't even get my commission.

596
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:17,340
I'll have no money for dating.

597
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,340
Hmph.

598
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:21,340
Dating two girls
takes double the effort.

599
00:26:21,670 --> 00:26:24,190
Hey. You have
other girls besides Xiaoxiao?

600
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:25,060
No, really not.

601
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:26,240
Mr. Yu, why are you saying that?

602
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:26,840
You swear.

603
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:27,506
I swear.

604
00:26:30,150 --> 00:26:30,990
Hello.

605
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:32,860
Okay, I'll get it.

606
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:40,780
Hello, Mr. Yu, your package.

607
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:41,620
Thanks.

608
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,420
The Sims, Master Chess.

609
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,270
What is this?

610
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:48,620
The Sims.

611
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,950
A variant of Master Chess.

612
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:51,470
Designed in 1972.

613
00:26:51,780 --> 00:26:52,910
Published in 1979.

614
00:26:53,230 --> 00:26:54,120
How much?

615
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:54,990
Over a thousand.

616
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:55,850
So expensive.

617
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:56,700
Ah?

618
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:59,190
He's so poor,
and you're still spending like crazy.

619
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,260
His poverty is none of my business.

620
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,100
I'm not his father.

621
00:27:02,470 --> 00:27:03,540
Even if I were,

622
00:27:03,551 --> 00:27:05,951
the inheritance I leave
would be my leftover money.

623
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,328
I mean, buy this junk

624
00:27:08,351 --> 00:27:09,670
and play it by yourself...

625
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,580
Mature people either learn to compliment

626
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,060
or learn to shut up.

627
00:27:15,870 --> 00:27:16,710
Good.

628
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,630
- Oh no.
- What happened?

629
00:27:22,630 --> 00:27:23,990
An emergency.

630
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,260
Do you have ten thousand?

631
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,430
No cash.

632
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:29,190
You can use my credit card,

633
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:30,773
but pay the card payment next month.

634
00:27:32,910 --> 00:27:35,260
I can't pay next month either.

635
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,230
What happened? Another mess?

636
00:27:38,780 --> 00:27:40,580
That house is my uncle's.

637
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,190
Today, the property management
called me.

638
00:27:42,190 --> 00:27:44,230
Turns out
I have to pay the property fee.

639
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:45,580
4,000 per month.

640
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:47,060
I already owe three months.

641
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,340
What property fee?

642
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,540
4,000 a month?

643
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:51,780
Three months make 12,000.

644
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,190
12,000 isn't the problem.

645
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,670
The issue is 4,000 per month.

646
00:27:54,870 --> 00:27:57,300
How can I pay for that on my salary?

647
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,870
You know how I spend my money.

648
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:00,910
I use Huabei and Jiebei,

649
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:02,430
and swap between them.

650
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,630
Robbing Peter to pay Paul.

651
00:28:04,630 --> 00:28:06,470
Now the wall collapsed.

652
00:28:06,470 --> 00:28:08,060
You got what you deserved.

653
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,230
Look at you.
400 for earrings, 800 for foundation,

654
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,950
and 80 for socks.

655
00:28:12,017 --> 00:28:13,340
Luckily, we have work uniforms.

656
00:28:13,340 --> 00:28:14,500
Otherwise, you'd be bankrupt.

657
00:28:14,595 --> 00:28:15,910
It's not reckless spending.

658
00:28:15,910 --> 00:28:16,910
It's affordable luxury.

659
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:19,950
Affordable luxury is just fancy poverty.

660
00:28:19,950 --> 00:28:21,390
It's a scam for fools like you.

661
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:24,540
There are just too many cute things.

662
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,780
I swear I won't spend recklessly again.

663
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:31,430
But even that won't help.

664
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,990
I bought it in installments,

665
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:34,630
and I still pay every month.

666
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,490
Mm.

667
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,990
Yeah, just accept your fate.

668
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,230
There's nothing I can do.

669
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,740
Good evening.

670
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:57,580
Mm.

671
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,430
Can I ask you something?

672
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:03,780
A simple answer.

673
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,500
Do you pay property fees
for this house every month?

674
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:09,580
Yes.

675
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:10,920
- How much?
- 1,000.

676
00:29:11,870 --> 00:29:12,910
1,000?

677
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,706
Why is it 1,000 for you
but 4,000 for me?

678
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,710
I told you, simple answer.

679
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:19,540
Isn't this house your uncle's?

680
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,500
Why not ask him?

681
00:29:29,390 --> 00:29:31,780
Stop showing off. It's annoying.

682
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:56,740
(Bill)

683
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:32,380
(Congratulations, you're married.)

684
00:30:34,540 --> 00:30:35,470
Alas...

685
00:30:36,990 --> 00:30:38,870
Marriage is always a chain.

686
00:30:40,195 --> 00:30:41,660
(Congratulations, you own a villa.)

687
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:51,260
Your wife requests an increase
in household expenses.

688
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,830
Decline.

689
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,620
(Congratulations, you're married.)

690
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:14,340
Your wife left you.

691
00:31:14,470 --> 00:31:15,910
You never recover.

692
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,020
Depressed and unhappy.

693
00:31:17,230 --> 00:31:18,150
Bad ending.

694
00:31:19,128 --> 00:31:20,973
Does getting married
always lead to trouble?

695
00:31:21,020 --> 00:31:22,100
(Tragic ending)
I'm done.

696
00:31:26,740 --> 00:31:27,820
(The client lost their job.)

697
00:31:27,995 --> 00:31:29,751
(Option A: Total renovation 250,000)
(He wants to cut 50,000.)

698
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:32,380
(Option B: Closed kitchen,
total renovation 200,000)

699
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:33,710
(I already finished the design.)

700
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:35,260
(Option A: Open kitchen)
(Now they say they have no money?)

701
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,630
(They suddenly lost their job)

702
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,150
(and can't overspend.)

703
00:31:38,150 --> 00:31:39,950
(Then get another job.)

704
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,670
(Easier said than done.)

705
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:43,780
(Adults' lives aren't that simple.)

706
00:31:44,870 --> 00:31:47,340
(Closed kitchen)
(How about we leave this wall as is?)

707
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,780
(Leaving it saves 50,000.)

708
00:31:50,470 --> 00:31:52,660
(Total renovation 200,000)
(It's about my principle.)

709
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,528
(Option B: Moved to trash)

710
00:32:00,573 --> 00:32:02,750
(Option A: Open kitchen,
total renovation 250,000)

711
00:32:09,506 --> 00:32:11,580
We still need to confirm this plan
with the client.

712
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,630
Okay, no problem.

713
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:13,630
Ms. Lin.

714
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,910
No problem.

715
00:32:14,910 --> 00:32:15,750
Here.

716
00:32:15,773 --> 00:32:18,284
This is the design draft Mr. Yu
asked me to deliver personally.

717
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:21,260
Delivering the draft or seeing Xiaoxiao?

718
00:32:21,260 --> 00:32:23,260
Well, it's on the way.

719
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,230
He actually changed the design.

720
00:32:33,630 --> 00:32:35,430
Isn't this still the original design?

721
00:32:35,430 --> 00:32:36,540
Printed so beautifully too.

722
00:32:36,540 --> 00:32:37,430
Is he crazy?

723
00:32:37,580 --> 00:32:38,420
Hmph.

724
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:40,710
Make them regret it
every time they see it.

725
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,150
That's exactly what Mr. Yu said.

726
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,950
How old is he? Really...

727
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,630
But this design does look pretty good.

728
00:32:57,060 --> 00:32:58,340
Pretty, yes.

729
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,260
But the client's budget isn't enough.

730
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:02,300
There's nothing we can do.

731
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,580
Well, honestly speaking,

732
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:05,950
if it were me,

733
00:33:05,950 --> 00:33:07,910
I'd definitely choose
the open-plan design.

734
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,670
If everyone were as rich as you,

735
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,040
this wouldn't even be a problem.

736
00:33:12,670 --> 00:33:13,670
But Ms. Lin...

737
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:14,510
Yes?

738
00:33:15,062 --> 00:33:16,884
How do you usually manage your finances?

739
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:17,910
Manage finances?

740
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,780
I can introduce you
to a financial advisor.

741
00:33:19,780 --> 00:33:20,950
No need.

742
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,573
A financial advisor wouldn't bother
with someone as broke as me.

743
00:33:23,573 --> 00:33:24,570
- Sis.
- Eh?

744
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:27,540
Someone sent you flowers again.

745
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:29,630
Oh, put them
with the other two bouquets.

746
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:30,950
Aren't you going to go take a look?

747
00:33:30,950 --> 00:33:32,630
Downstairs, handsome guy.

748
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,580
If he's still here in an hour,

749
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:35,710
I'll go check him out.

750
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,540
Hey, who's this new guy, Ms. Lin?

751
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:42,100
Let me see.

752
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:43,780
What kind of coach is he today?

753
00:33:43,780 --> 00:33:45,340
What does that have to do with you?

754
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:47,100
Where is he?

755
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,710
Don't look. You can't see.

756
00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:50,510
Come here.

757
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:51,620
She's calling you.

758
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:57,060
Is something wrong with her?

759
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:58,180
Ah?

760
00:34:05,470 --> 00:34:09,060
I told her you were dating another girl.

761
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,430
What are you clucking about?

762
00:34:14,430 --> 00:34:16,140
- You have...
- Who do you think you are?

763
00:34:17,140 --> 00:34:18,990
Why are you spreading what Mr. Yu said?

764
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:20,351
Do you talk to the boss like that?

765
00:34:20,373 --> 00:34:21,060
Out.

766
00:34:21,950 --> 00:34:23,580
I'm really done with your blabbermouth!

767
00:34:23,830 --> 00:34:24,670
Xiaoxiao.

768
00:34:25,580 --> 00:34:26,470
Xiaoxiao.

769
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,140
Serves you right for gossiping.

770
00:34:29,270 --> 00:34:30,110
Alas...

771
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,950
Xia Xiaoman is Mr. Yu's neighbor.

772
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:34,350
Mr. Yu was sick before.

773
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:36,140
She took him to the hospital.

774
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:37,700
I had dinner with her twice.

775
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:38,540
Twice?

776
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:40,700
You had dinner twice? Really?

777
00:34:40,700 --> 00:34:42,220
The first time,

778
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:44,500
I went to thank her
for taking Mr. Yu to the hospital.

779
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,350
The second time was a big group dinner.

780
00:34:47,350 --> 00:34:48,350
I just tagged along.

781
00:34:48,350 --> 00:34:49,350
Not a date.

782
00:34:49,350 --> 00:34:51,830
You know my situation better than I do.

783
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:52,950
I don't.

784
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:54,906
If it's too little for you,
you can switch jobs.

785
00:34:55,910 --> 00:34:56,790
Xiaoxiao.

786
00:34:59,990 --> 00:35:01,750
I want to be a designer.

787
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,830
Back in the old days,
I'd just be an apprentice.

788
00:35:03,830 --> 00:35:05,540
An apprentice is lucky to have food.

789
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,620
I get what you mean.

790
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,950
You want me to step out
of my comfort zone.

791
00:35:09,950 --> 00:35:10,789
That's fine.

792
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,795
But you can't push me out
of my safety zone, right?

793
00:35:12,795 --> 00:35:13,660
Shen Wu.

794
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:16,240
You're just lazy like a pig.

795
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,790
But you can't be lazy
like a pig and feel at ease.

796
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:20,140
Making excuses?

797
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:20,990
Well, forget it.

798
00:35:20,990 --> 00:35:22,180
Don't be mad, my bad.

799
00:35:22,180 --> 00:35:23,551
Let's not talk about this, okay?

800
00:35:23,660 --> 00:35:24,580
Change the topic.

801
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:30,100
Then tell me about Xia Xiaoman.

802
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:33,310
What's there to say about Xia Xiaoman?

803
00:35:33,310 --> 00:35:34,580
Talk about Xia Xiaoman.

804
00:35:34,580 --> 00:35:35,700
She's a woman.

805
00:35:35,700 --> 00:35:37,430
In her twenties, about 1.7 meters tall.

806
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,830
One nose, two eyes, one mouth.

807
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:40,860
Not prettier than you.

808
00:35:42,350 --> 00:35:43,750
- I want to meet her.
- No problem.

809
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:50,950
Nice place.

810
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,950
This is my girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.

811
00:36:07,500 --> 00:36:10,020
Xia Xiaoman, Mr. Yu's neighbor.

812
00:36:36,390 --> 00:36:37,390
1st, 12th.

813
00:36:37,390 --> 00:36:38,620
Also Xueyin Liuguang, right?

814
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,910
You can tell just by looking?

815
00:36:42,470 --> 00:36:43,470
Impressive.

816
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,420
What's this?

817
00:36:46,950 --> 00:36:47,950
Loose powder shade.

818
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:48,790
Lipstick shade.

819
00:36:48,790 --> 00:36:49,830
And perfume scent.

820
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:54,700
Enough. Based on this set,

821
00:36:55,060 --> 00:36:57,140
you and Wu are innocent.

822
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,500
What do you mean by innocent?

823
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,020
Obviously.

824
00:37:04,700 --> 00:37:05,620
You can't support her.

825
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:07,180
She doesn't fancy you.

826
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,617
You looking down on someone,
Wang Xiaoxiao?

827
00:37:11,662 --> 00:37:12,270
What?

828
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,750
I really hate your reasoning.

829
00:37:13,973 --> 00:37:15,190
Who are you talking about?

830
00:37:15,973 --> 00:37:17,100
But I like your argument.

831
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,990
Though, I don't entirely agree with it.

832
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:25,310
Even though
all my stuff is very refined,

833
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:29,660
it doesn't mean I only care about money.

834
00:37:30,830 --> 00:37:32,540
No, I didn't mean anything else.

835
00:37:33,310 --> 00:37:36,580
I just think money
has nothing to do with love.

836
00:37:36,910 --> 00:37:38,580
Yes, you're right.

837
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,420
But...

838
00:37:39,910 --> 00:37:42,470
Judging by how often
he's been disappearing lately,

839
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:44,430
you two haven't even met
that many times.

840
00:37:44,950 --> 00:37:47,020
And I think

841
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:49,990
you two can't be in love at first sight.

842
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:56,470
Is he using every coupon when paying?

843
00:37:56,470 --> 00:37:57,310
Trying for discounts?

844
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:58,817
Then, splitting the bill in the end?

845
00:37:58,830 --> 00:38:00,060
You know him too well.

846
00:38:00,790 --> 00:38:02,910
Of course, I taught him all that.

847
00:38:03,350 --> 00:38:05,140
Then teach me too.

848
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:06,750
I've been broke lately.

849
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:14,580
Yeah, you really are.

850
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:17,580
Mixing the dense style
and natural style lashes.

851
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:19,910
What is that?

852
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,060
Fake eyelashes, didn't you notice?

853
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:25,710
They're the same.

854
00:38:26,140 --> 00:38:26,980
Gosh...

855
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,540
This side is longer,
and that side is shorter.

856
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:32,310
Why aren't yours as long as hers?

857
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,150
What?

858
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,500
Say that again.

859
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:35,750
Open your eyes and look closely.

860
00:38:35,750 --> 00:38:36,590
See?

861
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:37,830
Same.

862
00:38:37,830 --> 00:38:38,830
Got it.

863
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:40,700
I'll tell you,

864
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,580
if you want to save money,
you must carry

865
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:45,580
discount coupons with you.

866
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,060
I have some too.

867
00:38:47,840 --> 00:38:49,862
(Three-person group discount coupon)
Perfect, let's see what to eat.

868
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:52,140
You two are a perfect match.

869
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:52,980
I got it!

870
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,270
How about we go eat together?

871
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,060
Three people get 30% off.

872
00:38:57,910 --> 00:38:58,750
Well...

873
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,270
You go ahead.

874
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:01,700
I won't go.

875
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:03,430
I already have plans with a friend.

876
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:04,660
I'll go with you next time.

877
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,100
Then we'll eat at this place.

878
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:07,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

879
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:08,830
Let's go.

880
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,790
- I paid the bill. Bye.
- Bye.

881
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,270
Let's go.

882
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:22,750
Jia, can you go for a walk
with me today?

883
00:39:26,020 --> 00:39:26,860
Sure.

884
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,580
How about we go shopping together?

885
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:36,620
(Why did you suddenly ask me out today?)

886
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,470
(Had a dose of love envy,
feeling a bit lonely.)

887
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:40,940
(Who?)

888
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:44,100
(Wu and his girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.)

889
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,180
(I'm telling you,)

890
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,060
(they're literally made for each other.)

891
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:56,910
Hey, what do you think of this bag?

892
00:39:57,928 --> 00:39:59,580
Seems like it has a lot of compartments.

893
00:39:59,750 --> 00:40:01,580
Those compartments are for organization.

894
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:02,728
This side can hold a laptop.

895
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:03,870
Here you can put your wallet.

896
00:40:03,870 --> 00:40:05,140
Here you can put your phone.

897
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,430
And here is your key pouch.

898
00:40:06,660 --> 00:40:07,950
Everything has its place.

899
00:40:07,950 --> 00:40:10,684
- Each item stays where it belongs.
- Each item stays where it belongs.

900
00:40:10,706 --> 00:40:12,660
But don't you think
putting things all together

901
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:15,060
and rummaging through them is fun?

902
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:17,390
And things aren't lonely
when they're together.

903
00:40:18,910 --> 00:40:20,060
Everyone has their quirks.

904
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:23,350
Let's look at the clothes first.

905
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,750
I plan to get both of these.

906
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,310
They are pretty, sure.

907
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,540
But it's the same style.

908
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:38,620
Why buy different colors?

909
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,270
I do this all the time.

910
00:40:40,700 --> 00:40:43,060
Once I find something I like,
I get a few colors.

911
00:40:43,060 --> 00:40:44,284
Then I mix and match at home.

912
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,270
What about you? How do you usually shop?

913
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:49,540
I look at the brand,
the price, and the style.

914
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:51,140
I think I've got to try

915
00:40:51,140 --> 00:40:52,573
and change to a different style.

916
00:40:53,430 --> 00:40:54,660
Then get both of these.

917
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:55,500
Okay.

918
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,180
When I was your age,

919
00:40:57,350 --> 00:40:59,270
I also liked trying all kinds of styles.

920
00:40:59,660 --> 00:41:01,100
But you're still young.

921
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,173
I don't have the luxury of trial
and error anymore.

922
00:41:07,870 --> 00:41:09,620
Jia, how about...

923
00:41:09,910 --> 00:41:11,620
You pick an outfit for me?

924
00:41:12,020 --> 00:41:13,660
Would you like what I pick?

925
00:41:13,870 --> 00:41:14,790
Not sure.

926
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:16,700
I think a new look

927
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,173
is the way to embrace a new life.

928
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,100
Jia,

929
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:23,580
your taste is amazing.

930
00:41:27,462 --> 00:41:28,670
What are you looking at?

931
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:33,870
Isn't that...

932
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:38,310
Why try on every hat?

933
00:42:11,950 --> 00:42:14,100
(Look, what kind of hat did Mr. Yu buy?)

934
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:18,470
(Do you think
he'll actually wear this out?)

935
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:21,310
(Not just out.)

936
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:38,790
(Look.)

937
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,540
Mr. Yu.

938
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:41,590
Speak.

939
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,390
You actually wore that thing
to work this morning?

940
00:42:46,060 --> 00:42:47,060
This is called a hat.

941
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,500
Yes, a hat.

942
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
