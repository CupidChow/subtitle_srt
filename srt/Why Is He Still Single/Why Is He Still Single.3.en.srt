Listen,

29
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,860
if you dare glare at a client again,

30
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,910
I won't hold back.

31
00:02:06,951 --> 00:02:08,620
What does he mean Ou Yang
is better than me?

32
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:09,990
Is that even design?

33
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,360
A rich kid with no skills,

34
00:02:11,373 --> 00:02:13,620
suddenly deciding to become
a designer in his thirties,

35
00:02:14,551 --> 00:02:15,830
just to gain some recognition

36
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,860
and fool young girls.

37
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,860
It's a disgrace to the profession.

38
00:02:18,951 --> 00:02:20,528
That's why I recommended you.

39
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:22,230
You increased the cost by 50,000 yuan.

40
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:23,262
Are you out of your mind?

41
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:25,420
50,000 yuan can buy
a much higher quality of life.

42
00:02:25,484 --> 00:02:26,860
If we calculate it over ten years,

43
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,860
that's only 13.5 yuan per day.

44
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:30,550
Over twenty years, it's just 6.75 yuan.

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:31,550
Quite reasonable, right?

46
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,190
Mr. Yu,

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,990
it's definitely worth it.

48
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:37,420
But 50,000 yuan is still a lot of money.

49
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:40,110
That's basically Wu's salary
for six months.

50
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:43,300
And whenever we go out now,
I'm the one paying.

51
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:45,180
Yeah, I feel like I'm being...

52
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:46,180
So you mean being kept?

53
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:47,230
You know that too.

54
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,300
Hey.

55
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:50,180
You still haven't given Wu a raise.

56
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:50,989
This is Shanghai.

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,390
With such a small salary,
when will he think about marriage?

58
00:02:53,390 --> 00:02:54,580
We're talking about Ou Yang now.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,300
What does his marriage
have to do with this?

60
00:02:56,306 --> 00:02:57,620
Fine, let's go back to Ou Yang.

61
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,230
Since the client chose him,

62
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,140
if you're unhappy,

63
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:02,460
prove you're better
with a superior design,

64
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,860
instead of sulking here.

65
00:03:03,860 --> 00:03:05,440
Complaining doesn't solve problems!

66
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:08,460
- Where are you going?
- The restroom.

67
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:09,550
Then why take your bag?

68
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,460
Mind your own business.

69
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:13,350
A lazy donkey produces more waste.

70
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:23,550
Master Designer Yu,

71
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:26,420
you came here
just for this piece of wood?

72
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,830
I know.

73
00:03:27,830 --> 00:03:30,180
You always provide artists
with the best materials.

74
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,140
Yu Yu, you should
explain this to the client.

75
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:36,390
Because this type of wood
is only available here.

76
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,740
But it's already been reserved
by someone else.

77
00:03:45,790 --> 00:03:46,670
Can you give it to me?

78
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,990
No, I can't.

79
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:49,270
A museum is opening.

80
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:52,860
I need it
for an eight-meter-tall mascot.

81
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:55,350
Does the contract specify the material?

82
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:57,790
No, it doesn't.

83
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,270
Will the mascot stay
in the museum afterward?

84
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,510
No.

85
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:04,270
So no one will lie on it and cry?

86
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:05,620
Or sleep on it?

87
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:10,790
Even though it's eight meters tall,

88
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:12,790
it's not that high yet.

89
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:14,830
Will it be discarded afterward?

90
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,020
Yes.

91
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:25,470
I want to turn it into a dining table,

92
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:27,590
to hold a person's sweet
and bitter moments.

93
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,150
I also want to make it into a bed,

94
00:04:30,306 --> 00:04:31,990
to carry someone's joys and sorrows.

95
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,180
Hey.

96
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,290
Gu Yejia gave me your test results.

97
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,160
Hmph.

98
00:04:52,170 --> 00:04:54,380
Tell her I don't like her tattling.

99
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:55,380
Well...

100
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,590
She's only trying to help you.

101
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,150
Come over tonight.

102
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,760
I'll make you some healthy food.

103
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,670
Hmph.

104
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,060
Can I eat at your place every day?

105
00:05:02,306 --> 00:05:03,620
That's definitely not allowed.

106
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:05,710
You'd ruin the family harmony.

107
00:05:05,751 --> 00:05:07,150
Then what's the point if I go once?

108
00:05:08,617 --> 00:05:09,940
It won't make a difference.

109
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:10,990
So...

110
00:05:12,550 --> 00:05:13,550
I'm going for barbecue.

111
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,230
Barbecue?

112
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,220
Just imagine,

113
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,740
lean beef mixed
with just the right amount of fat,

114
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:22,940
sizzling over high charcoal heat.

115
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,670
Take a bite at medium-rare,

116
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:28,180
and the fat and cholesterol,

117
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:30,550
enhanced by the Maillard reaction,

118
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,620
burst with savory aroma in your mouth.

119
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,500
Then explosion.

120
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,070
How wonderful.

121
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:39,990
Bro, I want to go too.

122
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:40,990
Goodbye.

123
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,020
Director Zhong.

124
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,910
Hey, Dr. Gu.

125
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:50,230
Here's a document for you to sign.

126
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,070
Sure.

127
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,310
Oh, right.

128
00:05:54,328 --> 00:05:55,470
I finished talking to Yu Yu.

129
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:57,030
I gave him a severe scolding.

130
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:58,390
How did he respond?

131
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,710
He said he hates you tattling on him.

132
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,710
Why is he so...

133
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:06,780
Annoying,

134
00:06:07,260 --> 00:06:08,910
immature, weird,

135
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,230
proud, scheming,

136
00:06:10,230 --> 00:06:11,700
stubborn, complicated, and difficult.

137
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,230
Complaining or not,

138
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,620
you should still try to advise him
as a family member.

139
00:06:19,590 --> 00:06:20,860
Alright, don't worry.

140
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,500
Tonight, I'll have him over for dinner.

141
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:43,470
What are you doing? Washing the car?

142
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,150
I'm doomed.
It's almost the end of the month,

143
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:49,740
and I haven't sold a single car.

144
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,440
The manager is going to scold me.

145
00:06:51,884 --> 00:06:53,380
If you want to hit your sales target,

146
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:55,820
you can't just wait in the store
for customers to come in.

147
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:58,300
You need to
open your eyes to opportunities.

148
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,670
You need to look outside.

149
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:01,340
Outside?

150
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,820
You need to find some potential clients.

151
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:07,460
For example,

152
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:11,060
that handsome guy who delivered
something to your house last time,

153
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:11,910
seemed pretty good.

154
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:14,380
You mean Shen Wu?

155
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,990
Oh, he is Wu.

156
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,060
We haven't been in touch since then.

157
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,550
So what if you haven't?
Just message him.

158
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,670
Invite him for coffee

159
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:23,030
and have a chat.

160
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,260
Then casually ask

161
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,030
if he's thinking about changing cars.

162
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,910
Then just show him this brochure.

163
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:29,500
Not a good idea.

164
00:07:29,670 --> 00:07:30,670
What's wrong with that?

165
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,995
Even if the deal doesn't go through,
you still gain goodwill, right?

166
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,820
Let's go eat barbecue.

167
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:46,500
No money.

168
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:52,780
Just withdrew.

169
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:54,030
Brand new.

170
00:07:55,150 --> 00:07:56,260
Still smells of ink.

171
00:07:56,990 --> 00:07:58,940
What are you doing,
showing off your wealth?

172
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,180
Is that necessary, Mr. Yu?

173
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:02,350
I'm not showing off.

174
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:04,110
I just want to show you

175
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,300
why you're short on cash while I'm not.

176
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:08,550
Why?

177
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:09,620
Because I use cash.

178
00:08:10,350 --> 00:08:11,940
Cash represents a kind of sentiment

179
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,470
and the quality of life.

180
00:08:13,470 --> 00:08:15,500
At the same time, it's also a warning.

181
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:17,430
Look.

182
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:20,910
As this cash decreases,

183
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,030
your sense of urgency grows.

184
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:24,860
Then you stay alert.

185
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,500
You're outdated.

186
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,500
Most people

187
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:33,710
aren't rich enough
to treat money just as numbers.

188
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,190
People like you

189
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:36,350
use electronic payments,

190
00:08:36,590 --> 00:08:38,380
which quietly make money disappear,

191
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:39,860
fall into overdraft,

192
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,110
and ruin themselves.

193
00:08:41,470 --> 00:08:42,310
Got it?

194
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:43,590
Wu, ignore his rambling.

195
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,710
Just take the money.

196
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:45,730
Free money, don't miss it.

197
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,780
He closed the bag already,

198
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,195
and didn't even let me touch it.

199
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:53,500
Oh, right.

200
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:55,230
I went for a check-up this morning.

201
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:58,260
Everything is perfectly healthy.

202
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,830
So,

203
00:08:59,906 --> 00:09:01,884
(BBQ. Couple Set Discount)
let's go for barbecue.

204
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:05,110
Oh, I'm not going.

205
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,740
I have to go back to work.

206
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,380
- Ah?
- You're working overtime?

207
00:09:08,830 --> 00:09:09,900
Then what about dinner?

208
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,470
You can mooch off Mr. Yu's barbecue.

209
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,350
I'm not going. I don't want barbecue.

210
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:15,460
Hey!

211
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:16,470
Nobody's going?

212
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:18,710
Why don't you just go with Ms. Lin?

213
00:09:18,820 --> 00:09:19,660
Oh, right.

214
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:23,260
That couple set has a discount.

215
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:29,230
Just tell them Ms. Lin is your wife.

216
00:09:29,230 --> 00:09:30,110
No one will notice.

217
00:09:30,110 --> 00:09:32,470
Why would I pretend to be his wife?

218
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:33,830
I don't mind.

219
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:36,350
Some sacrifices
are worth it for barbecue.

220
00:09:40,773 --> 00:09:42,380
Is it really a sacrifice to go with me?

221
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,340
That's not important.

222
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:45,830
Let's go together. Come on.

223
00:09:45,862 --> 00:09:47,589
I want the deluxe barbecue set.

224
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,070
With beef tenderloin and lamb chops,

225
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:50,470
perilla leaf wrapped garlic,

226
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,310
one bite,

227
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,900
delicious!

228
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:54,710
With red wine
and double scoop ice cream.

229
00:09:54,728 --> 00:09:55,840
- You go yourself.
- Alright.

230
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,190
If you don't go, how do I get 20% off?

231
00:09:57,195 --> 00:09:58,110
I'm not your coupon.

232
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
Xiaoxiao, let's go.

233
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,740
Oh, okay.

234
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,340
Bye.

235
00:10:12,110 --> 00:10:13,500
Wu, how about...

236
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,780
No, Mr. Yu. I already made plans.

237
00:10:17,190 --> 00:10:18,030
Bye.

238
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,150
Delicious.

239
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,470
What's up?
Why did you want to meet today?

240
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:35,430
Here is the thing.

241
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:38,310
I have something I'd like to ask you.

242
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,380
After all,
your designer circle is high-end,

243
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:43,710
skill level is high,

244
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:44,660
and income is high too.

245
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:46,470
Not high. Everything can be high.

246
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:48,070
Income isn't high at all.

247
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:53,860
So what do you usually use
for getting around?

248
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:55,230
Transportation?

249
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,660
First, by foot.

250
00:10:59,020 --> 00:10:59,860
Then hitch a ride.

251
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:01,950
If that doesn't work, use a shared bike.

252
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:02,990
I don't take taxis anyway.

253
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:11,070
Pretty eco-friendly and low carbon.

254
00:11:11,590 --> 00:11:13,190
Good exercise too.

255
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:15,230
Doesn't your boyfriend work out?

256
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,270
I...

257
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:18,740
I'm single.

258
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:23,260
Aren't you living with your boyfriend?

259
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,950
Who told you that?

260
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:27,230
Mr. Yu told me.

261
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,380
Yu Yu?

262
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:31,350
Which eye did he
see me living with someone?

263
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:32,590
Impossible.

264
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:34,590
Mr. Yu never spreads rumors.

265
00:11:35,540 --> 00:11:38,230
He just told me
your boyfriend's name is...

266
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,950
What is it...

267
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,230
Dao...

268
00:11:46,780 --> 00:11:48,380
Dao? My boyfriend?

269
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:50,190
His English name is Dao.

270
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:53,260
Oh, so it's that Dao.

271
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,660
Sorry about that.

272
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,900
Blame Mr. Yu for this.

273
00:12:00,950 --> 00:12:02,540
It's just about lunch time.

274
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:04,070
How about I treat you?

275
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:05,860
I never got to
thank you properly before.

276
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:08,350
I know a really good restaurant.

277
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,690
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

278
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,470
Three greatest joys in life

279
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:18,990
are eating, eating, and eating.

280
00:12:19,710 --> 00:12:20,620
And sleeping.

281
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,620
That's four joys, then.

282
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:23,260
Hello, check please.

283
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,900
Let's split it.

284
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,620
I said I'd treat you.

285
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,740
Split it.

286
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,830
I really enjoyed our chat today.

287
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,230
Total is 528.

288
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:33,260
528, right?

289
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,350
Wait a moment.

290
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:38,020
Hello, I have a free salad coupon,

291
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:41,140
a 20-off-400 cash voucher,

292
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:42,740
a 3% discount coupon,

293
00:12:42,950 --> 00:12:44,950
(App Voucher)
and a 7% discount from the app.

294
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,500
Don't mess up the order,

295
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:47,620
or the discounts won't stack.

296
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,520
Okay, thanks.

297
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,540
Thank you. Xiaoman.

298
00:12:49,906 --> 00:12:51,906
Can I borrow your phone
to scan the code?

299
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,660
Thanks. Done.

300
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,260
Here's a new user

301
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,780
50 yuan voucher.

302
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:06,780
How much did you end up spending?

303
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:08,100
64.

304
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,020
64? How?

305
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,140
Used the vouchers.

306
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:14,430
I'm telling you,

307
00:13:14,430 --> 00:13:16,740
he's a real organizer type.

308
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:17,710
In the end,

309
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:21,900
he managed a big group order
for four tables, twelve people.

310
00:13:22,260 --> 00:13:24,710
Dude, should we join the group order?

311
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:25,900
We could save 100 yuan.

312
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:27,380
- 100 yuan?
- 100 yuan.

313
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:28,220
Okay.

314
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,500
Hello, we'll join the group order.

315
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:32,140
Alright.

316
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,230
The waiters and customers
all gathered around.

317
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:38,350
The manager didn't feel it was a loss,

318
00:13:38,350 --> 00:13:39,740
and even gave a bag of chips,

319
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:42,660
thanking us for spotting a bug.

320
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,740
You gotta admit, he's pretty sharp.

321
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:47,620
But in the end, we split it.

322
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:49,190
32 per person.

323
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:51,070
Ouch.

324
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:54,020
So I didn't mention buying a car.

325
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,380
I wasn't really expecting him
to buy one anyway.

326
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:58,260
But even if he didn't,

327
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,860
I think he's pretty impressive.

328
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:08,150
Marriage.

329
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,340
Hmph.

330
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:10,860
What's so great about marriage?

331
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,660
Every time I come home,
I see you busy in the kitchen.

332
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:15,190
Look at me.

333
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,740
So free.

334
00:14:17,140 --> 00:14:18,070
Going wherever I want.

335
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
Doing whatever I want.

336
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,830
A day has twenty-four hours.

337
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,540
Minus eight hours of sleep,

338
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,660
you still have sixteen.

339
00:14:24,906 --> 00:14:26,780
But you spend five
of those in the kitchen.

340
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,950
That means a third

341
00:14:28,950 --> 00:14:30,430
of your waking life

342
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:31,990
is trapped in this cursed kitchen.

343
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,070
Pathetic.

344
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,140
Oh, you not helping is one thing,

345
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:36,440
but pointing fingers at the side

346
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:37,230
is annoying.

347
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,830
We're from the same mother.

348
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:40,070
How can you be so annoying?

349
00:14:40,284 --> 00:14:41,860
Are we really from the same mother?

350
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:43,540
I think your nose is kind of weird.

351
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,190
I think you are weirder.

352
00:14:45,462 --> 00:14:46,995
Take that dish out quickly.

353
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:56,740
I thought you'd come in a few days.

354
00:14:57,140 --> 00:14:58,710
Never expected you tonight.

355
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:02,470
Weren't you going for barbecue?

356
00:15:02,684 --> 00:15:04,260
Because of a group of unreliable people.

357
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:05,460
Hey.

358
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:07,070
Eat the veggies yourself.

359
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:08,620
Give the meat to the kids.

360
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,110
Remember, only your wife
will always be by your side.

361
00:15:13,110 --> 00:15:14,395
Too bad you don't have one yet.

362
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,470
Does my mom visit often?

363
00:15:16,780 --> 00:15:18,190
Yes, she lives here.

364
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,260
Listen to me.

365
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:24,420
When the mother-in-law comes over,

366
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:25,900
the son-in-law might not be too happy.

367
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,830
How could that be?

368
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:30,350
I actually welcome her.

369
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:31,190
Right, Mom?

370
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:32,580
Did you hear that?

371
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,620
Yeah, it would be weirder
if my uncle showed up at home.

372
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,140
Is that trait inherited
across generations?

373
00:15:44,817 --> 00:15:46,950
Hey, why is all the meat
just sitting there today?

374
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,350
Doctor's orders.

375
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:51,740
She told me to make you
more vegetarian meals.

376
00:15:53,950 --> 00:15:54,790
Doctor's orders?

377
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:55,900
Yours.

378
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,740
What?

379
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:57,830
So fancy.

380
00:15:58,230 --> 00:16:00,830
Eight types of vegetables,
low cholesterol,

381
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,900
and low carb.

382
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:05,260
Packed with vitamins A through G.

383
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:08,230
This is just veggies
with a sprinkle of salt.

384
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,740
No, there's no salt.

385
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:10,580
You're overthinking.

386
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,140
Just oil and vinegar.

387
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,110
I don't like it.

388
00:16:13,173 --> 00:16:14,350
I like it, and that's enough.

389
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:16,260
Eat, it's good for you.

390
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,780
If you want someone else's wife
to cook to your taste,

391
00:16:21,500 --> 00:16:25,020
back in ancient times, people like you
would get us all in trouble.

392
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:26,950
What do you mean?

393
00:16:27,017 --> 00:16:28,860
A seventeen-year-old girl
who refuses to marry,

395
00:16:30,151 --> 00:16:31,860
A twenty-year-old man
who refuses to marry,

396
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:33,110
his family is punished.

397
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:34,740
Understand?

398
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,070
A twenty-year-old man not married,

399
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,240
the whole family suffers.

400
00:16:38,951 --> 00:16:40,190
Whose terrible idea was that?

401
00:16:40,430 --> 00:16:41,380
King Goujian of Yue.

402
00:16:41,990 --> 00:16:42,990
I'm telling you,

403
00:16:43,062 --> 00:16:44,950
don't think I'm nagging you
about marriage

404
00:16:44,950 --> 00:16:46,660
because I'm old-fashioned.

405
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:49,780
It's scientific advice
and gentle reminders.

406
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,740
Fine, then give me orders.

407
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:52,790
Orders are orders.

408
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:54,350
Starting tomorrow.

409
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:55,500
Starting today.

410
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:57,380
No meat for him.

411
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,740
Okay.

412
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,710
I don't have the three highs,
but he's already at risk.

413
00:17:02,706 --> 00:17:04,470
High blood pressure,
sugar, and cholesterol.

414
00:17:04,950 --> 00:17:06,670
Why does everyone act like Gu Yejia?

415
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:08,780
Gu Yejia?

416
00:17:09,340 --> 00:17:10,180
Who?

417
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:11,420
A woman?

418
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:13,710
Our hospital's doctor
has treated him before.

419
00:17:13,928 --> 00:17:16,328
She's the one who told my brother
to eat more vegetables.

420
00:17:16,395 --> 00:17:17,630
She's good.

421
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:19,150
Married?

422
00:17:19,430 --> 00:17:22,430
No way, Mom.
She examined my brother's butt.

423
00:17:22,430 --> 00:17:23,630
So awkward.

424
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:27,470
It's fine. We're family.

425
00:17:27,528 --> 00:17:29,328
What's the big deal
if she's examined him?

426
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:30,630
Once examined,

427
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,260
she's not an outsider anymore.

428
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:33,817
Yes.

429
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:34,990
Now she knows him thoroughly,

430
00:17:34,990 --> 00:17:36,573
maybe things could even develop faster.

431
00:17:36,573 --> 00:17:37,350
Exactly, right.

432
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,020
Yeah, having a doctor
at home is so convenient.

433
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,630
Is she forty already?

434
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,290
Can you eat properly?

435
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,470
The veggies are cold now.

436
00:17:45,950 --> 00:17:47,230
Vegetables are naturally cold.

437
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,070
Even colder now.

438
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,300
This meat is delicious.

439
00:17:50,230 --> 00:17:51,390
There's still meat, want some?

440
00:17:51,630 --> 00:17:52,870
You guys are going too far.

(Ultra-high pressure pasteurization)
Celery, chives, garlic, and cilantro.

442

Who would drink
this five-vegetable juice?

443
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:02,060
It tastes pretty good.

444
00:18:02,262 --> 00:18:04,020
And it's not exactly
a five-vegetable mix.

445
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:06,990
Because there's no green onion.

446
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:10,990
Ninety in total.

447
00:18:25,706 --> 00:18:26,780
Cholesterol is too high.

448
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:28,840
Blood pressure and sugar
are at dangerous levels.

449
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,060
In your case,

450
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,060
if you eat more vegetables and fiber...

451
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:34,100
From today, no meat for him.

(Pathology Dept)
That's the doctor's order.

453

Nothing more to say. Take care.

454
00:18:37,820 --> 00:18:38,990
Does this count as going out?

455
00:18:43,430 --> 00:18:44,820
Say it directly.

456
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,470
Your store says no returns
after items leave the shop.

457

Change all my milk to skim milk.

458
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,540
Also, give me a box of what you drink.

459

What can we do? We're all just workers.

460

Honestly, Wu is kind of pitiful.

461
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,100
His boss is also stingy.

462
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,060
Look, he hasn't had a raise for ages.

463

Really?

464
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,870
Then your neighbor
is way too stingy.

465
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:16,230
Check out what gift he gave last time.

466
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,950
Oh, two movie tickets.

467
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,230
And a lollipop.

468
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,910
He must be the type

who licks the yogurt lid
for ten minutes.

470
00:19:25,990 --> 00:19:27,300
Hey, Xiaoman.

Don't worry. He definitely didn't.

00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,020
Can you be a little quieter?

483

Such a small task won't stop me.

Nice racket. Who gave it to you?

00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:10,190
The client chose my design, right?

554
00:25:10,540 --> 00:25:12,100
Yes, they gave up Ou Yang's design.

555
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:12,990
Okay.

556
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:13,870
Wise choice.

557
00:25:14,540 --> 00:25:16,740
He's happy you found cheap wood,

558
00:25:16,890 --> 00:25:18,700
making this a win-win situation.

559
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,780
And he feels that things
clients don't care about,

560
00:25:20,930 --> 00:25:22,060
you do better on.

561
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,670
It's a rare quality nowadays.

562
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:25,630
Of course.

563
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:27,100
He said he wants to visit your home.

564
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,470
Oh, that's not necessary.

565
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,820
Having strangers in my home
would bother me for a month.

566
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,260
I already refused for you.

567
00:25:35,017 --> 00:25:36,870
Ou Yang posted
on his video account again.

568
00:25:36,870 --> 00:25:38,470
He went to Paris on vacation.

569
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:43,540
(After assigning clients
to other designers,)

570
00:25:44,390 --> 00:25:45,710
(I come to Paris to recharge.)

571
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:46,910
(Looking for inspiration in Art Paris)

572
00:25:46,910 --> 00:25:49,190
The other designers
aren't talking about Mr. Yu, right?

573
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:51,780
Assigned? He's the one
who gave it to you?

574
00:25:55,173 --> 00:25:56,670
Losers just hype themselves up.

575
00:25:56,910 --> 00:25:57,780
Yeah, alright.

576
00:25:58,150 --> 00:25:59,390
Hurry and finish the designs.

577
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,300
Work starts tomorrow.

578
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:04,540
You've already finished them.

579
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,540
Wow, truly worthy of Mr. Yu.

580
00:26:08,540 --> 00:26:10,150
Always confident in your victory.

581
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,630
Now that we have a new project,

582
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:14,670
we should celebrate.

583
00:26:14,820 --> 00:26:16,500
Let's go eat barbecue.

584
00:26:16,500 --> 00:26:17,500
Barbecue again?

585
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,100
We didn't manage last time.

586
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,470
And Mr. Yu loves it too.

587
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,020
I actually don't mind.

588
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,780
Oh, you two go ahead.

589
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:26,260
I have a date tonight.

590
00:26:26,260 --> 00:26:27,540
One less tennis game won't hurt.

591
00:26:27,540 --> 00:26:29,390
Who said I was playing tennis?

592
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:30,260
Date, you know?

593
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:31,230
Concert, you know?

594
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,100
Front row, you know?

595
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Whose concert?

596
00:26:34,106 --> 00:26:36,306
A metal band. They're
all coming. Aren't you going?

597
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:41,180
Wu.

598
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,870
Accompany Mr. Yu to barbecue.

599
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:43,910
I'll reimburse you.

600
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:44,990
Alright.

601
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,300
Forget it.

602
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,910
I don't really like barbecue
that much anyway.

603
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:51,500
And when Mr. Yu eats,

604
00:26:51,500 --> 00:26:52,500
he doesn't say a word.

605
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,430
Eating in that atmosphere

606
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:55,580
gives me indigestion.

607
00:27:01,230 --> 00:27:04,300
By the way, can the concert be canceled?

608
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,420
What?

609
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:26,860
(Couple dining)

610
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:28,480
(Vegetable and mushroom dishes)

611
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,340
Hey.

612
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:31,870
Why do you only have
a vegetable platter? No meat platter?

613
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:33,500
Sorry, we don't have one.

614
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,528
If you think you can't finish,
you can order less.

615
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:36,620
Oh, no need.

616
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,662
I want premium lamb,
premium beef, premium pork belly,

617
00:27:39,662 --> 00:27:42,950
signature beef tongue, soybean paste
soup, double-skin milk and a draft beer.

618
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,870
Do you still need the vegetable platter?

619
00:27:45,430 --> 00:27:46,270
No.

620
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:50,150
Thanks for inviting me
to the movies, Dr. Gu.

621
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,430
But this movie is so boring.

622
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,300
Really, it's just boring.

623
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,230
Good thing we watched it together.

624
00:27:57,230 --> 00:27:58,670
Otherwise, no one to complain with.

625
00:27:59,780 --> 00:28:00,630
Let's go eat.

626
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:01,470
Sure.

627
00:28:01,620 --> 00:28:03,340

649
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,910
Do you know
there's a loneliness ranking?

650
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,340
It's for when someone
goes to watch a movie alone.

651
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:56,340
Ranked fourth.

652
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,300
What's number one then?

653
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,230
Eating alone outside.

654
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:04,190
Isn't that your neighbor?

655
00:29:04,430 --> 00:29:05,740
Hey, this is...

656
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,500
This is a couple's restaurant.

657
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:08,710
Is he eating alone?

658
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,500
Ordered all meat dishes.

659
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,990
His life's purpose must be eating meat.

660
00:29:13,062 --> 00:29:14,470
Not listening to any medical advice.

661
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Well...

662
00:29:15,990 --> 00:29:19,340
Eating alone is truly the saddest.

663
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:21,340
Let's go.

664
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:23,773
But I really
do have to thank this fellow

665
00:29:23,795 --> 00:29:25,090
for the fact that we met.

666
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,010
Indeed.

667
00:29:26,020 --> 00:29:27,260
But he's kind of strange.

668
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,340
Is that so?

669
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:47,670
You...

670
00:29:47,670 --> 00:29:48,780
What are you doing?

671
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,020
Ate too much meat yesterday.

672
00:29:57,060 --> 00:29:58,260
What are you doing?

673
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:00,500
Checking the project quality...

674
00:30:00,870 --> 00:30:01,710
Ouch!

675
00:30:03,062 --> 00:30:04,780
I just finished nailing this door frame.

676
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,020
Sun, all you think about is door frames.

677
00:30:07,670 --> 00:30:08,510
You...

678
00:30:08,670 --> 00:30:10,230
Definitely missed some nails.

679
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,500
(Emergency)

680
00:30:25,190 --> 00:30:26,740
Hey, Mr. Yu.

681
00:30:26,884 --> 00:30:27,870
What are you doing here?

682
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:29,660
What happened?

683
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,580
Work injury.

684
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,100
You really have a thing for hospitals.

685
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:40,670
That started after meeting you.

686
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,060
If you followed my advice,

687
00:30:42,060 --> 00:30:44,217
you wouldn't have come
to the hospital so many times.

688
00:30:44,884 --> 00:30:46,540
I stood in line to get this for you,

689
00:30:46,540 --> 00:30:47,500
and my legs went numb.

690
00:30:47,500 --> 00:30:48,780
Come, eat while it's hot.

691
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:51,830
I...

692
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:54,190
Um...

693
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:55,100
Hello, you are...

694
00:30:55,300 --> 00:30:56,300
I am...

695
00:30:56,300 --> 00:30:57,540
She's the doctor treating me.

696
00:30:57,573 --> 00:30:58,795
Oh, hello, nice to meet you.

697
00:30:58,990 --> 00:30:59,950
I'm Yu Yu's manager,

698
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,820
Lin Sa.

699
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,950
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

700
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:03,100
Thank you for your care.

701
00:31:03,617 --> 00:31:05,260
He actually doesn't have major issues.

702
00:31:05,260 --> 00:31:06,300
Just the three highs.

703
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:07,728
He just needs to be careful at home.

704
00:31:07,773 --> 00:31:08,550
I mean,

705
00:31:10,430 --> 00:31:11,390
this person

706
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,150
is quite troublesome.

707
00:31:14,128 --> 00:31:15,230
Already has three highs.

708
00:31:15,230 --> 00:31:16,340
You should eat less meat.

709
00:31:16,373 --> 00:31:17,780
The fourth high doesn't concern you.

710
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:19,580
Then let a girlfriend deal with it.

711
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:20,710
I just won't. What of it?

712
00:31:21,417 --> 00:31:23,150
I have some things to do. I'll go first.

713
00:31:23,150 --> 00:31:24,060
You two keep talking.

714
00:31:24,951 --> 00:31:26,500
We'll meet again if there's a chance.

715
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,900
Sure.

716
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,670
The female doctor is quite beautiful.

717
00:31:34,190 --> 00:31:35,190
Beautiful? Where?

718
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:36,040
I don't see it.

719
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:37,190
How could you not see it?

720
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,620
Are you okay?

721
00:31:39,670 --> 00:31:40,630
What are you doing?

722
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Looking at your hand,

723
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,230
you won't be able
to cook for a few days.

724
00:31:44,390 --> 00:31:46,500
How about I order
some takeout for you these days?

725
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,060
Can you show some sincerity?

726
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:49,262
I don't eat takeout anyway.

727
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,740
What's the matter?

728
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:54,580
I could even come to your place
and cook for you.

729
00:31:55,910 --> 00:31:57,150
You cook for me?

730
00:31:57,817 --> 00:31:58,790
That's not impossible.

731
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:03,100
But you know,
I don't like people entering my house.

732
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:04,540
Because once you enter,

733
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:06,500
the whole room feels stuffy.

734
00:32:06,910 --> 00:32:08,020
What do you mean?

735
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:11,260
How can the air get stuffy
just because I enter?

736
00:32:11,910 --> 00:32:13,060
Alright, how about this?

737
00:32:13,300 --> 00:32:15,470
After you cook,
just deliver it to my apartment.

738
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,310
What do you think?

739
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,060
Thank you so much.

740
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:24,580
Go away.

741
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,030
Mr. Yu, do you usually

742
00:32:33,030 --> 00:32:34,810
buy so many random things?

743
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:35,720
Of course not.

744
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:36,670
But today, there's you.

745
00:32:37,084 --> 00:32:38,440
I'm helping you out of kindness.

746
00:32:38,462 --> 00:32:40,470
Treating me like a laborer?
What about my overtime pay?

747
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,500
Weren't you volunteering?

748
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:43,670
I knew it.

749
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:46,030
- Hey.
- Hey.

750
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:48,950
Did you come to deliver food for me?

751
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,390
Is there meat?

752
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,230
I...

753
00:32:53,820 --> 00:32:55,470
Um, hello.

754
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,500
I'm Shen Wu, nicknamed Wu.

755
00:32:57,500 --> 00:32:58,540
I'm Mr. Yu's assistant.

756
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:00,340
Hello, I'm Gu Yejia.

757
00:33:02,300 --> 00:33:03,670
So you're Dr. Gu.

758
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:06,260
Mr. Yu talks about you a lot.

759
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:11,100
Mr. Yu talks about me often... How so?

760
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,190
Yeah, how do I talk about her?

761
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:22,020
- Hey, Jia.
- Yeah...

762
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:23,100
Hello.

763
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:24,070
Xiaoman.

764
00:33:24,630 --> 00:33:26,190
Sorry, I came to the wrong place.

765
00:33:28,351 --> 00:33:29,506
You go in and sit first.

766
00:33:29,528 --> 00:33:31,750
My drain is blocked.
The property management isn't answering.

767
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:32,630
Okay.

768
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:36,310
Hello.

769
00:33:36,820 --> 00:33:37,660
What's up?

770
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:38,990
Um...

771
00:33:39,630 --> 00:33:41,430
My drain is blocked,

772
00:33:41,430 --> 00:33:43,240
and the property management
isn't answering.

773
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,950
Do you know someone who can fix it?

774
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:46,190
Yes, him.

775
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:47,750
Ah?

776
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:49,870
Then I'll trouble you.

777
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:50,940
No trouble at all.

778
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,060
I'll go help her fix it.

779
00:33:53,060 --> 00:33:53,900
Suit yourself.

780
00:34:38,390 --> 00:34:39,230
All done.

781
00:34:40,140 --> 00:34:41,990
You really know
what you're doing. Thanks.

782
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:47,350
Your clothes got wet.

783
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,790
The wind will dry them.

784
00:34:51,990 --> 00:34:53,350
But then you'll catch a cold.

785
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:54,900
Why not take it off and air it a bit?

786
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,910
And join us for dinner.

787
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,750
That, that's not appropriate.

788
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:00,220
What's inappropriate about it?

789
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:02,830
I just need a man to taste my cooking.

790
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:39,990
You two are skilled.

791
00:35:40,270 --> 00:35:41,790
All the dishes were made by Xiaoman.

792
00:35:42,700 --> 00:35:43,540
Well...

793
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:46,310
Um, Xiaoman,

794
00:35:47,790 --> 00:35:49,100
I want to apologize to you.

795
00:35:50,580 --> 00:35:51,420
Apologize?

796
00:35:51,830 --> 00:35:52,670
Why apologize?

797
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,350
The last time at the restaurant,
didn't I embarrass you?

798
00:35:57,350 --> 00:35:58,190
Sorry about that.

799
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:01,220
Did he say anything to you?

800
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,060
Oh, no, nothing.

801
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:03,062
He didn't say anything.

802
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:04,910
Spreading rumors.

803
00:36:05,390 --> 00:36:06,750
No, don't misunderstand.

804
00:36:06,750 --> 00:36:09,430
I'm really not targeting you
or saying anything about you.

805
00:36:09,430 --> 00:36:10,910
I was just venting about him.

806
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,420
Alas...

807
00:36:12,910 --> 00:36:14,140
(A one-handed dinner)

808
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,020
(really hard to swallow.)

809
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:18,180
(I shouldn't have done those pull-ups.)

810
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,900
(Mom)

811
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,110
Hey, Mom.

812
00:36:26,620 --> 00:36:29,180
Dao, I made you stewed ribs.

813
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,710
- Come eat.
- I'm not coming.

814
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:31,830
That's fine too.

815
00:36:31,830 --> 00:36:32,990
Then go with a friend.

816
00:36:33,220 --> 00:36:34,540
Don't eat alone.

817
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:36,950
Online it says eating alone often

818
00:36:36,950 --> 00:36:38,350
can affect mental health.

819
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,340
Goodbye.

820
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,870
Honestly, I really admire you.

821
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:48,430
You're so meticulous with your money.

822
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,620
How is he meticulous with money?

823
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:54,390
I want to learn from him.

824
00:36:55,350 --> 00:36:57,020
I'm a bit embarrassed to say it.

825
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:59,700
Let me explain. Simply put,

826
00:36:59,700 --> 00:37:01,500
he organized a bulk purchase

827
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:02,870
for everyone at the restaurant,

828
00:37:02,870 --> 00:37:05,100
turning a 500 yuan meal into 64 yuan.

829
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,750
Wow, it really feels nice
to have someone

830
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:12,790
to eat with.

831
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:14,750
Yeah, eating alone is so lonely.

832
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
Unlike some people,

833
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,790
who don't say a word while eating.

834
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:20,020
Honestly, such weird people,

835
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:21,100
who can put up with him?

836
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:23,950
Bear with him?

837
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:29,340
Ms. Lin.

838
00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:33,310
Oh, is that the one who brought him
to the hospital today?

839
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,470
- The one with glasses?
- Yes.

840
00:37:35,470 --> 00:37:36,500
- That's her.
- Oh.

841
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:37,620
Who? His girlfriend?

842
00:37:37,910 --> 00:37:40,350
No, they're just close buddies.
No way they're dating.

843
00:37:43,390 --> 00:37:46,140
Mr. Yu can't have
always been single, right?

844
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:47,230
Of course not.

845
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,617
He's been dumped many times.

846
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:50,870
But nobody knows why.

847
00:37:54,220 --> 00:37:56,060
Starting this early today.

848
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:06,660
What?

849
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,020
You're too loud.

850
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:10,430
Because you guys are laughing so loudly.

851
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,270
What's so funny?

852
00:38:13,395 --> 00:38:16,284
Are you laughing because the person
who brought the food cooked badly?

853
00:38:16,306 --> 00:38:17,540
The person you're talking about

854
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,660
asked if you wanted
to come over and eat.

855
00:38:21,310 --> 00:38:22,150
I already ate.

856
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:23,460
Hmph.

857
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:24,790
Xia Xiaoman said,

858
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:27,310
you started the music earlier today,

859
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:28,750
so you didn't actually eat.

860
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:29,950
Are you coming or not?

861
00:38:32,060 --> 00:38:32,900
Not coming.

862
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:42,580
What did you bring?

863
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,910
Chive and fennel juice.

864
00:38:45,910 --> 00:38:47,350
This tastes awful.

865
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:52,950
Who could drink this? Oh my god.

866
00:38:53,620 --> 00:38:54,460
I can.

867
00:38:54,830 --> 00:38:56,620
Green, so healthy.

868
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:01,950
You're impressive. I admit I was wrong.

869
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:05,270
But did my food taste good?

870
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:06,710
Terrible.

871
00:39:06,870 --> 00:39:07,710
The rice is too hard.

872
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:09,950
Mr. Yu,

873
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,580
have some manners.

874
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,830
Hey.

875
00:39:14,990 --> 00:39:16,270
These buns look good.

876
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:17,540
I made them.

877
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:22,270
Ah, forget it. Don't mind him.

878
00:39:22,270 --> 00:39:23,395
Let's talk about our stuff.

879
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,020
Xiaoman, you just said

880
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:28,060
that dating is like driving a car.

881
00:39:28,530 --> 00:39:29,390
Yes.

882
00:39:29,390 --> 00:39:32,700
Dating is like driving
without a license,

883
00:39:32,817 --> 00:39:34,140
just crashing through everything,

884
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,306
hitting things by chance.

885
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,100
Life doesn't come with a dating license.

886
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:40,500
I think, Jia,

887
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:42,470
you're the kind of person
who drives safely.

888
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:47,350
I haven't driven my car
for seven or eight years.

889
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:49,470
It's been gathering dust in the garage.

890
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:52,580
I don't even know if I could drive it
on the road again.

891
00:39:52,580 --> 00:39:53,700
What does that mean?

892
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:57,060
It means you should drive it
around more often.

893
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,620
That way it won't rust.

894
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:01,100
Exactly. Old cars need to be driven.

895
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,390
Otherwise, they'll rust.

896
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,100
No way.

897
00:40:05,990 --> 00:40:06,830
Ah?

898
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:07,830
What do you mean?

899
00:40:07,990 --> 00:40:10,270
Cars basically
start rusting after a year,

900
00:40:10,430 --> 00:40:11,870
even if kept in a garage.

901
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,950
A seven or eight-year-old car

902
00:40:14,180 --> 00:40:15,470
would be completely rusted.

903
00:40:15,910 --> 00:40:17,430
Basically,

904
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:18,700
it's considered scrap.

905
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:21,180
There's no hope of driving it.

906
00:40:21,306 --> 00:40:22,990
But if you want to use it as decoration,

907
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:24,660
you could still repurpose it.

908
00:40:25,700 --> 00:40:26,580
Scrap, huh?

909
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:28,580
No hope left, huh?

910
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:29,700
Yeah.

911
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:31,950
Or you could just
throw it away like trash.

912
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:42,100
You're the trash.

913
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,330
- What's wrong?
- Mr. Yu!

914
00:40:59,330 --> 00:41:00,950
How can you say that about Dr. Gu?

915
00:41:00,973 --> 00:41:03,100
No, I... I was talking about the car.
Why is she angry?

916
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:03,990
You went off-topic.

917
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,180
We weren't talking about a car.

918
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:06,540
It's a metaphor for dating.

919
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:07,380
What?

920
00:41:07,750 --> 00:41:09,950
