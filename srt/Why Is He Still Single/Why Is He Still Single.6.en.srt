00:01:58,030 --> 00:02:00,580
Hey, let me show you
something really funny.

29
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,780
Are you ready?

30
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,620
Yes.

31
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:10,790
He really wore that hat outside!

32
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:11,630
Yeah.

33
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,830
And he even thought he looked great.

34
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,670
Hey.

35
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:20,110
But speaking of which,
you two are quite fated.

36
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,670
Fancy running into him on a trip.

37
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,550
What we have is a cursed fate.

38
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,230
Enemies always cross paths.

39
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:27,460
You don't even know how mean
he was the whole way.

40
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:29,740
Like a peacock showing off.

41
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,300
Always bragging about how much he knows.

42
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,950
He even made the tour guide girl cry.

43
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:38,620
Sounds like you had a terrible
travel experience.

44
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:40,020
So off-putting.

45
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:42,790
I know.

46
00:02:43,070 --> 00:02:45,420
Next time you travel, bring me.

47
00:02:45,506 --> 00:02:47,740
A good travel companion
is the first step to happiness.

48
00:02:48,140 --> 00:02:48,990
True.

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,300
Oh, in a few days there'll be
the fireworks festival.

50
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:53,140
Let's go together.

51
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,460
The fireworks festival...

52
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,740
Speaking of that,

53
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:03,390
last year, I went with my boyfriend.

54
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,460
It's in the past. Time to move on.

55
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,350
How about this?

56
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:12,900
If you're afraid it'll be lonely
or bring back memories,

57
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:15,300
we can invite more people,
make it livelier.

58
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:17,860
Sure. It's decided then.

59
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,700
Sure.

60
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:24,580
(Son)
Hello, son.

61
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:25,420
Hi, Mom.

62
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:29,860
Yejia got your brother-in-law to bring
that fan back for me.

63
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,300
And under the fan,

64
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:34,620
she tied a jade pendant
for "peace in all seasons".

65
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:35,990
Her return gift

66
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:38,830
is thoughtful and exquisite.
I really like it.

67
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,210
Return gift?

68
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:41,973
What exactly did you two do
behind my back?

69
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:43,390
Alright, don't worry about it.

70
00:03:43,550 --> 00:03:44,390
I'm just telling you.

71
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,740
You need to thank her.

72
00:03:46,070 --> 00:03:47,860
The girl is so polite.

73
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:49,270
Hmph, girl?

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,550
Hear that?

75
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,830
You must go. Immediately.

76
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,670
Also, you can't just say "thank you".

77
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,928
Then what do I do?

78
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,190
Think for yourself.

79
00:03:57,190 --> 00:03:58,980
(Son)

80
00:04:12,395 --> 00:04:14,390
The drink you ordered today
is very creative.

81
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,860
Oh, thank you.

82
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:18,420
And you?

83
00:04:18,420 --> 00:04:19,420
The usual?

84
00:04:21,940 --> 00:04:23,300
I want to change mine.

85
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,310
Change to what?

86
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:25,750
Anything.

87
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,100
Alright.

88
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,230
Still here alone?

89
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,500
Aren't you alone too?

90
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:36,150
Oh, darling.

91
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,060
Sorry.

92
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:38,060
I'm late.

93
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,820
Not late. I just arrived too.

94
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,550
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

95
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:44,350
How about watching the fireworks
together on Sunday?

96
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:47,230
I booked a suite on the rooftop.

97
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:49,910
The fireworks will bloom right
before your eyes.

98
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,110
So romantic.

99
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,500
I love it!

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,150
Darling, you're amazing.

101
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,380
Sorry to keep you waiting.

102
00:04:56,910 --> 00:05:00,820
Fireworks should be watched
with my own woman.

103
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:02,300
Yes.

104
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:04,060
Cheers.

105
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,973
(Shanghai International Fireworks Music Festival)
You want to watch fireworks?

106
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,150
What do you want?

107
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:15,710
You can't just say "thank you"
and call it done.

108
00:05:23,973 --> 00:05:24,950
(I'm telling you all.)

109
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,670
(I'm not soldering a capacitor,)

110
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:29,030
(but sincerity.)

111
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,550
(I believe)

112
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:32,990
(the best way to thank someone
is with a gift.)

113
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,860
(But the gift)

114
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,740
(must be handmade by you.)

115
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:38,910
(To let the other person feel)

116
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,910
(that you put thought into it.)

117
00:05:58,990 --> 00:06:02,420
A total of 86 patients
underwent randomization.

118
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,470
Fifty-seven were assigned
to the experimental group.

119
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,150
Twenty-nine were assigned
in the control group.

120
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:12,620
A pathological complete
response occurred in 37%

121
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:18,180
of the patients
in the experimental group,

122
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:21,590
and in 7% in the control group.

123
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:23,380
Thank you for your time.

124
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,300
It would be our journal
honor to publish your essay.

125
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:28,550
Pleasure is mine.

126
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:30,617
I look forward to meeting you
in person next time.

127
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,860
Thank you. Talk to you soon.
Have a good day.

128
00:06:36,151 --> 00:06:37,330
Your English is really fluent.

129
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,420
Well, all those years studying abroad
can't go to waste.

130
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,140
Paper published?

131
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:44,430
Yes.

132
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:45,630
Went smoothly?

133
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,180
Quite smooth, thank you.

134
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:49,590
What's wrong with you today?

135
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:51,620
Oh, my stomach.

136
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,230
I didn't feel uncomfortable today.

137
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,940
Oh, right.

138
00:06:57,420 --> 00:07:00,030
My mom likes the jade pendant
you sent to her.

139
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:01,620
That's great.

140
00:07:01,620 --> 00:07:02,728
As long as Auntie likes it.

141
00:07:03,773 --> 00:07:04,906
So I think...

142
00:07:04,906 --> 00:07:06,520
You don't need to give me
any more gifts.

143
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:07,595
Otherwise, it'll never end.

144
00:07:08,084 --> 00:07:09,470
Who said I'm giving you a gift?

145
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,710
By the way,

146
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:18,550
I saw that fireworks flyer you had.

147
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:20,150
I know a really great spot.

148
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,590
Amazing view.

149
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:24,470
So I've prepared red wine
to watch the fireworks.

150
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,710
Sweet on the tongue,

151
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:26,710
brightness in the eyes,

152
00:07:26,860 --> 00:07:28,128
and "boom-boom" in the ears.

153
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:33,900
(Yu Yu)

154
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:36,870
This is my secret.

155
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,420
Don't tell Xia Xiaoman or Wu.

156
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:40,260
Absolutely not.

157
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:42,500
Then why did you send me the location?

158
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:48,220
You...

159
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:50,550
You want me to watch the fireworks
with you.

160
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,380
Well...

161
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:56,670
If you insist on coming with me,

162
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:57,900
I won't object.

163
00:07:58,620 --> 00:07:59,460
I'm not going.

164
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,380
Huh?

165
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,573
I already asked Xiaoman
to watch the fireworks with me.

166
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,240
You're leaving such an important thing

167
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,590
to someone as unreliable as Xia Xiaoman?

168
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:10,620
She'll probably pick some
overly crowded place,

169
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,620
squeezed with people,

170
00:08:11,662 --> 00:08:13,928
or some shabby spot
where you can't see anything.

171
00:08:14,350 --> 00:08:16,910
As long as we're together,
we'll have fun.

172
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,328
The fireworks are just decoration.

173
00:08:18,462 --> 00:08:20,570
Of course, you wouldn't understand
that kind of joy.

174
00:08:21,670 --> 00:08:22,670
I don't need to.

175
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,230
Go on with what you're doing. Bye.

176
00:08:46,660 --> 00:08:47,620
- Hey.
- Hello.

177
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,710
- You're here.
- Hello.

178
00:08:48,710 --> 00:08:49,550
Xiaoxiao.

179
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,590
Alright, you two.

180
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,470
You're the only couple today.

181
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,900
Tone it down a bit.

182
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:55,820
I'm not really into
all that lovey-dovey stuff.

183
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,350
It's fine. Let them show off.

184
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,350
Save it for Dao later.

185
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,380
So frugal.

186
00:09:00,380 --> 00:09:01,380
Xiaoman. Hey!

187
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:02,260
Hello, you're here.

188
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Let me introduce you.

189
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,470
This is Wu.

190
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,660
His girlfriend Xiaoxiao.

191
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,660
- Hello.
- Hello.

192
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,660
I am Song.

193
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,500
I am Ping Yang.

194
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:11,150
- You're here.
- Hi.

195
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:12,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

196
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,140
- You all came.
- Yeah.

197
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:15,684
Why are you
carrying such a big bag?

198
00:09:15,728 --> 00:09:17,740
It's full of snacks and drinks.

199
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:18,660
A treasure stash.

200
00:09:18,706 --> 00:09:20,830
Don't mention it.
She couldn't sleep at all last night.

201
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:22,130
Like a kid before a school trip.

202
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
Alright, everyone's here. Let's go.

203
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,380
Sure!

204
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:27,684
- Sure.
- Where are we going?

205
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,860
To the secret base
for watching fireworks.

206
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:37,300
(Panda Construction Engineering Co., Ltd)

207
00:09:37,310 --> 00:09:38,660
What kind of secret base is this?

208
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:41,260
Don't look down
on this abandoned building.

209
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,070
The view here is wide open.

210
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:44,140
Perfect location.

211
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:46,990
And the best part,
there won't be a single person here.

212
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,190
I've actually heard of

213
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,590
this abandoned building.

214
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:53,350
It must be great for watching fireworks.

215
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:56,230
But how did you even find a place
like this?

216
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:57,380
You're incredible.

217
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:59,470
Don't you know who I am?

218
00:09:59,470 --> 00:10:00,950
Come on, let's go.

219
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,380
Right here.

220
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:06,310
Hey.

221
00:10:07,070 --> 00:10:07,910
Who are you people?

222
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,470
We're just ordinary citizens.

223
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,260
Here to watch the fireworks.

224
00:10:12,728 --> 00:10:14,240
No. You all should leave now.

225
00:10:14,262 --> 00:10:16,990
They're doing construction inside.
What fireworks are you trying to see?

226
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:18,310
Isn't this an unfinished building?

227
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,540
Our company took it over.

228
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:20,910
Hurry and leave.

229
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,740
Sorry.

230
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:27,540
So, what do we do now?

231
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,830
I'm really sorry, everyone.

232
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:33,140
I'm just too unreliable.

233
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:28,470
Earlier, you invited me
to watch fireworks.

234
00:11:28,470 --> 00:11:29,470
I turned you down.

235
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:30,740
Sorry.

236
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,900
Oh, it's fine.

237
00:11:35,380 --> 00:11:36,710
Can I still watch with you?

238
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:48,590
If you insist on watching with me,

239
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,990
I can only agree out of courtesy.

240
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:52,660
Thank you.

241
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:56,110
Wow, this place is really nice.

242
00:11:59,706 --> 00:12:01,140
Fireworks for just the two of us.

243
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:02,990
Not only that.

244
00:12:02,990 --> 00:12:03,860
What?

245
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:04,830
Come here.

246
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:06,020
This way.

247
00:12:06,973 --> 00:12:08,590
Didn't I tell you not to tell others?

248
00:12:08,590 --> 00:12:09,590
Isn't it lively now?

249
00:12:09,830 --> 00:12:10,950
No, this is my secret spot.

250
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:12,190
Sharing brings more joy.

251
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,140
Xia Xiaoman is really unreliable.

252
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,540
Mr. Yu.

253
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:18,500
Wow, this place is amazing.

254
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:20,500
Wow, it's absolutely perfect.

255
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,860
It's okay.

256
00:12:22,070 --> 00:12:24,440
Still a bit worse than my spot.

257
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,350
Not bad, Mr. Yu. Impressive.

258
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,590
Well, Mr. Yu.

259
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,430
How did you even find this secret base?

260
00:12:31,195 --> 00:12:33,380
The owner of this building
is my college classmate.

261
00:12:33,590 --> 00:12:34,590
He lent it to me.

262
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:36,710
- Oh.
- Wow.

263
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,110
Although Mr. Yu didn't invite us
to watch fireworks before,

264
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,540
this time we're lucky thanks to you.

265
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,540
We get to see them now.

266
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,860
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.
- Thank you, Mr. Yu.

267
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey.

268
00:12:47,350 --> 00:12:48,740
This is pretty nice.

269
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:51,190
Why don't we just eat here?

270
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,230
Sure, let's do it.

271
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:54,900
Let's see what you brought.

272
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,310
How does it feel to be thanked?

273
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:07,430
Not bad.

274
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,310
Look how happy they are.

275
00:13:10,660 --> 00:13:11,660
It's all because of you.

276
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,780
Sorry for sharing your secret.

277
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,620
- Wow!
- Wow!

278
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:25,780
Wow, look!

279
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,500
It's huge!

280
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:29,470
That one just now!

281
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:30,660
Wow!

282
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,190
There!

283
00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,430
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

284
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:46,660
I really didn't expect
to see fireworks like this.

285
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,070
Take this.

286
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:10,950
What's this?

287
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,790
A VR headset.

288
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:13,340
I built a shuttle device.

289
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:14,573
It works great for fireworks.

290
00:14:14,595 --> 00:14:15,230
Try it.

291
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:18,380
- What about you?
- I've got one too.

292
00:14:18,380 --> 00:14:19,380
You have two?

293
00:14:19,706 --> 00:14:20,770
Buy one, and get one free.

294
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:22,900
Why can't I see anything?

295
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,380
You'll see in a moment.

296
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:26,460
Here it comes.

297
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,150
Wow!

298
00:15:00,470 --> 00:15:03,070
Wow!

299
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,620
Beautiful, right?

300
00:15:06,070 --> 00:15:07,070
So beautiful.

301
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,070
Too beautiful! So dreamy!

302
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:24,380
So this is what fireworks look like
through your eyes.

303
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,020
This is way too cool.

304
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:28,860
Send me the video?

305
00:16:29,590 --> 00:16:31,830
For a price,
later, we'll treat you to a dinner.

306
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,710
I can give you the video for sure.

307
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,860
But dinner... Forget it.

308
00:16:35,190 --> 00:16:36,860
I have to go home to wash clothes today,

309
00:16:36,860 --> 00:16:37,860
and tidy up the house.

310
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:39,860
Work's been way too busy lately.

311
00:16:39,906 --> 00:16:41,259
I haven't cleaned for so long.

312
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,140
Well...

313
00:16:42,140 --> 00:16:42,980
Alright then.

314
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,980
Hey.

315
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,020
Since when did you learn to eavesdrop?

316
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,860
I didn't.

317
00:16:50,862 --> 00:16:52,530
You still have three minutes
before work.

318
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:54,020
So I'm waiting for you.

319
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:57,310
Mr. Yu is back at the hospital again.

320
00:16:57,590 --> 00:16:58,430
Don't speak.

321
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:00,140
Let's disappear.

322
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:01,670
Hurry, go.

323
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,150
Hello, Mr. Yu.

324
00:17:04,150 --> 00:17:05,580
Thank you for your hard work, Mr. Yu.

325
00:17:05,580 --> 00:17:06,420
Gone again?

326
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:12,270
Sit down.

327
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:18,830
Where does it hurt now?

328
00:17:19,190 --> 00:17:22,020
I still have a headache and neck pain.

329
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:24,060
So I came to ask you
for some painkillers.

330
00:17:24,340 --> 00:17:25,580
You finished the painkillers

331
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,906
I gave you last time so quickly?

332
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:27,870
I finished them,

333
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:31,340
so I came to ask
for stronger painkillers.

334
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:33,740
Medicine can't be prescribed recklessly.

335
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:36,430
And many pains heal on their own.

336
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,990
You must not...

337
00:17:37,995 --> 00:17:39,617
Make a big deal out of it, right?

338
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:42,950
Not very accurate,
but roughly means that.

339
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:44,220
Wait...

340
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:47,060
Do you often have patients
who make a big deal out of small things

341
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,060
come to see you?

342
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:51,190
So that makes you too tired
to do housework.

343
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:54,300
You said you didn't eavesdrop on others.

344
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,100
Besides, so what if I'm busy
and too tired to do housework?

345
00:17:58,540 --> 00:17:59,470
Hmph.

346
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:00,470
I am this kind of person.

347
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:02,260
No matter how tired,
I will do housework.

348
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:04,740
I am very diligent and love cleanliness.

349
00:18:05,190 --> 00:18:07,670
That means your home
must be very tidy and clean.

350
00:18:07,670 --> 00:18:08,510
Of course.

351
00:18:09,430 --> 00:18:10,740
But very regrettably,

352
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:13,020
I cannot invite you to my home,

353
00:18:13,284 --> 00:18:15,630
because I'm not used
to letting outsiders into my room.

354
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:19,710
So regrettable.

355
00:18:20,470 --> 00:18:21,310
You may leave.

356
00:18:23,462 --> 00:18:25,500
Anyway, people who say they don't
like housework

357
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:26,870
or can't do housework are,

358
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,500
in one word, lazy.

359
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:31,390
Headache.

360
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,300
Headache? I have medicine.

361
00:18:35,910 --> 00:18:36,910
I'm being sarcastic.

362
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:38,820
I'm just joking.

363
00:18:39,580 --> 00:18:41,270
Goodbye.

364
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,100
Who wants to go to your home?

365
00:18:55,940 --> 00:19:00,460
(House renovation bill of quantities
and pricing table)

366
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:01,500
In such a short time,

367
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,390
how can such a complex project
be completed?

368
00:19:03,390 --> 00:19:04,470
Isn't that ridiculous?

369
00:19:05,780 --> 00:19:08,100
Ou Yang said he wouldn't do it.

370
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,020
I had no choice either,

371
00:19:10,390 --> 00:19:11,260
so I came over

372
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:12,950
to find you.

373
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:14,940
Ou Yang, huh?

374
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:15,830
Hmph.

375
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:18,470
He said this goes against the rules
of creation.

376
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:20,140
It can't be done.

377
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,630
This time he's right.

378
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,780
Other designers said the same thing.

379
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:27,260
Otherwise,

380
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:29,340
should I just drop it? Forget it.

381
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,180
Wait.

382
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,180
Don't drop it.

383
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:33,510
I'll take it.

384
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,060
A project no one can complete.

385
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:39,740
If I complete it on time,

386
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:40,630
what does that mean?

387
00:19:40,630 --> 00:19:42,780
It means slapping them in the face,

388
00:19:42,906 --> 00:19:45,100
and it also means you are
more capable than them.

389
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,820
You would be the designer of the year.

390
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:48,940
Exactly.

391
00:19:50,670 --> 00:19:52,780
Oh, have you thought it through?

392
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,740
What if you don't finish?

393
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:57,470
Piece of cake.

394
00:20:00,470 --> 00:20:01,310
Oh.

395
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,950
Wu, aren't you setting up Mr. Yu?

396
00:20:05,190 --> 00:20:06,030
I'm not.

397
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,580
(People always need
some difficult challenges)

398
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,706
(to motivate themselves.)

399
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,780
(Success lets you show off,)

400
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,740
(and failure lets you be playful.)

401
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:20,470
(All for hope that there is
something only you can do.)

402
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:22,780
(It makes you feel safe,)

403
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:24,780
(like finding your place)

404
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,340
(in a crowded subway.)

405
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:30,540
(Wanting to be unique among billions,)

406
00:20:30,662 --> 00:20:32,373
(this is the root of inner struggle.)

407
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:35,060
(Torturing yourself,)

408
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:37,260
(any obstacle can be overcome.)

409
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:40,950
(But remember to lift your feet first.)

410
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:50,910
No inspiration?

411
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:52,740
How could I have no inspiration?

412
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,140
Go do your work.

413
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:56,990
(I have no work.)

414
00:20:57,306 --> 00:20:59,430
(I have to wait for you
to finish the design drawing.)

415
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,270
(Got it.)

416
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:03,830
(Mr. Yu.)

417
00:21:04,084 --> 00:21:06,060
(The client didn't want it to be
that perfect.)

418
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:07,390
(Stop being pretentious.)

419
00:21:07,780 --> 00:21:08,630
(What pretentious?)

420
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:10,630
(This is a dedication to art.)

421
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,340
It's you.

422
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,230
Where are you going?

423
00:21:41,230 --> 00:21:42,662
I'm going to Xia Xiaoman's place.

424
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,100
Hey, following someone like that
is scary.

425
00:21:45,300 --> 00:21:46,500
Why not greet me?

426
00:21:46,573 --> 00:21:48,300
After greeting,
if there's nothing to say,

427
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:49,540
wouldn't it be more awkward?

428
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,060
Haven't seen you for days.

429
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,506
Have you gone crazy from overtime?

430
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:54,870
Overtime is for the inefficient.

431
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,340
I don't do overtime.

432
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,340
Let's go.

433
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,230
See?

434
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:32,190
Wu, what are you doing here?

435
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:34,580
Dr. Gu, I'm waiting for Mr. Yu.

436
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:36,740
Why is he so far from you?

437
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,990
Sick again. Continue your work.

438
00:22:39,670 --> 00:22:40,820
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

439
00:22:44,020 --> 00:22:45,020
Fighting again?

440
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:46,820
Hmph, actually the opposite.

441
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:49,230
To avoid awkward silence,

442
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:50,500
I stay away from her.

443
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:52,500
But don't you talk a lot with her?

444
00:22:52,884 --> 00:22:54,030
What are you doing here?

445
00:22:57,390 --> 00:22:58,260
Mr. Yu.

446
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,740
You must finish this design today.

447
00:23:00,870 --> 00:23:02,870
Otherwise, I won't have time
for the mock-up.

448
00:23:02,870 --> 00:23:04,260
So I came to help you.

449
00:23:04,820 --> 00:23:05,820
I even brought my laptop.

450
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:07,630
Are you questioning my ability?

451
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:10,390
No, I'm just sharing the workload.

452
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:12,060
Enough, go back now.

453
00:23:12,060 --> 00:23:13,780
I came all this way,
so just let me go up.

454
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:16,340
- You knew I wouldn't let you in, yet you came.
- Breaking the rule for work once.

455
00:23:16,340 --> 00:23:17,430
Either in the hallway,

456
00:23:17,430 --> 00:23:18,670
or Xia Xiaoman's place.

457
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:19,540
Pick one.

458
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:22,870
Then I'll work overtime at the office.

459
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:24,340
Why not do it at home?

460
00:23:24,630 --> 00:23:26,390
Home is where I live with my girlfriend.

461
00:23:26,390 --> 00:23:28,300
I can't bring work home.

462
00:23:28,540 --> 00:23:30,990
Hmph. It's clearly because there's
no private space.

463
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,190
See how good I have it.

464
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:33,500
Free and easy at home.

465
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:35,020
No one bothers me. Jealous, huh?

466
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:36,500
Sick again.

467
00:23:36,884 --> 00:23:37,995
- Come back.
- Goodbye.

468
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,540
Ta-da.

469
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:48,260
This is my newly
invented vegetable rice.

470
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,060
It looks black but tastes great.

471
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,540
Indeed, it's very black. Can I eat it?

472
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:54,580
Yes.

473
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,150
Here, try it.

474
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,340
Try it.

475
00:24:00,870 --> 00:24:01,710
Thank you.

476
00:24:05,230 --> 00:24:06,070
Mmm.

477
00:24:07,300 --> 00:24:08,300
Xiaoman, you're amazing.

478
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,740
Cooking so well

479
00:24:09,740 --> 00:24:11,340
and inventing new things.

480
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I really admire you.

481
00:24:12,580 --> 00:24:15,710
I think my future husband
will be very happy.

482
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:19,540
Because I will take care
of everything at home.

483
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:21,150
Let him fully

484
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,630
focus on his career.

485
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:25,430
I think behind every successful man,

486
00:24:25,430 --> 00:24:27,300
there's a strong woman.

487
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:30,230
That said,

488
00:24:30,230 --> 00:24:32,100
you want to be a full-time housewife.

489
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:35,260
Yes, and I don't need him to spend much.

490
00:24:35,306 --> 00:24:36,670
I'm not trying to take advantage.

491
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,300
I think each month

492
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,630
it's enough if he brings back
living expenses.

493
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,190
Any leftovers we save.

494
00:24:42,630 --> 00:24:44,060
So we can gradually manage

495
00:24:44,230 --> 00:24:45,230
and feel at home.

496
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:48,710
I think you'll be a great wife.

497
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:49,990
I think so too.

498
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:51,150
What a pity.

499
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,300
No one appreciates it.

500
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,190
Otherwise, I'd marry you.

501
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,630
Or tomorrow we could register?

502
00:24:59,710 --> 00:25:01,990
But I never knew

503
00:25:02,990 --> 00:25:04,540
what kind of man you like?

504
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,340
Me?

505
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:09,300
I want a man
who is ambitious in his career,

506
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,990
but also willing to share housework
with me.

507
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,260
In today's world,

508
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,500
such men are rare.

509
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:16,790
There are.

510
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:17,860
Who?

511
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:20,430
(Facing time pressure,)

512
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,300
(higher work efficiency is needed.)

513
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:24,630
(Staying calm and focused)

514
00:25:24,630 --> 00:25:25,470
(is the key.)

515
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,020
(Choose a quiet work environment,)

516
00:25:28,390 --> 00:25:29,820
(and allocate time for each task.)

517
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:55,950
Really.

518
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,470
I think Mr. Yu actually
likes doing housework.

519
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,020
He does laundry more diligently than I do.

520
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:02,540
He did tell me

521
00:26:02,950 --> 00:26:05,740
that he keeps his home neat and clean,

522
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,430
tidy and spotless.

523
00:26:07,710 --> 00:26:08,950
Have you been inside?

524
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:11,670
No, but I heard from Shen Wu

525
00:26:12,020 --> 00:26:13,430
that he doesn't let anyone in.

526
00:26:13,670 --> 00:26:14,540
So strange.

527
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,230
Now I'm curious.

528
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:39,660
Xiaoman.

529
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,340
I'm wondering why you always cry poor.

530
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:43,630
You spend so much money

531
00:26:43,630 --> 00:26:45,670
buying luxury shoes and bags.

532
00:26:47,484 --> 00:26:49,540
Even have these limited-edition
red-soled shoes.

533
00:26:50,820 --> 00:26:53,100
I call it "exquisite poverty".

534
00:27:00,910 --> 00:27:02,150
Why are you staring at me?

535
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,430
Stay here tonight.

536
00:27:04,870 --> 00:27:07,230
I'll let you experience
princess treatment.

537
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:50,230
Jia, you're amazing.

538
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,630
I worked hard on my makeup.

539
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,820
Gotta show it off.

540
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:59,710
Or scare him?

541
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,340
What's this?

542
00:28:36,462 --> 00:28:37,580
What are you recording?

543
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,230
What are you two doing?

544
00:28:44,084 --> 00:28:45,528
Why are you dressed like that?

545
00:28:45,573 --> 00:28:46,740
Going to sing "Night Shanghai"?

546
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,950
Wearing that mask,

547
00:28:48,950 --> 00:28:50,528
planning a Sichuan opera face-change?

548
00:28:50,528 --> 00:28:51,470
I really can.

549
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,060
Give up, huh?

550
00:28:59,060 --> 00:28:59,900
You win.

551
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:03,500
This dish is made by Xiaoman. Try it.

552
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,780
Even you can't finish it.

553
00:29:07,862 --> 00:29:09,060
Then it must be terrible.

554
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:11,060
So will you eat it or not?

555
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,910
If you insist I eat,

556
00:29:12,910 --> 00:29:14,150
I'll just eat a little.

557
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,530
We have

558
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,910
a question to ask you.

559
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:26,660
Go ahead.

560
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,990
Why don't you let anyone into your home?

561
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,100
Good question.

562
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:35,950
Home can be a place

563
00:29:35,995 --> 00:29:37,540
to separate from this troublesome world.

564
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:40,260
It's an independent, private space.

565
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:42,820
Like male leads
in fantasy martial-arts drama.

566
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:46,190
They cultivate alone
in their secret rooms.

567
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:47,030
Understand?

568
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:57,300
Then, sorry to disturb you.

569
00:29:57,300 --> 00:29:59,470
Please continue your cultivation.

570
00:30:04,950 --> 00:30:06,340
He's really strange.

571
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:08,470
Grown up and still wearing a mask.

572
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,870
I made a meme of him, look.

573
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:15,780
You're so talented.

574
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:17,150
Even put the hat in.

575
00:30:17,390 --> 00:30:18,670
I'll post it in our group chat.

576
00:30:48,340 --> 00:30:50,100
Mr. Yu, it's so late, still not here?

577
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:51,100
What's going on?

578
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:52,870
It's 10:30 AM.

579
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,470
Wu, coffee, double shot.

580
00:31:23,470 --> 00:31:24,310
Triple.

581
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,270
- Hey, you.
- Mr. Yu.

582
00:31:29,617 --> 00:31:31,060
You don't need to say anything.

583
00:31:31,060 --> 00:31:32,780
Trust me, I can finish quickly.

584
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,020
You don't need to do this work anymore.

585
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:36,630
What?

586
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:38,340
You don't have to do it.

587
00:31:38,630 --> 00:31:39,470
What?

588
00:31:39,470 --> 00:31:40,740
This place is nice.

589
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:44,430
How are you here?

590
00:31:46,540 --> 00:31:48,100
Because you didn't finish work on time.

591
00:31:48,430 --> 00:31:49,950
According to headquarters,

592
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:52,020
this place is now managed by Ou Yang.

593
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:53,260
You're no longer needed.

594
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,820
Effective now, immediately.

595
00:31:56,551 --> 00:31:59,390
This contract officially
takes effect at noon.

596
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,500
One minute left.

597
00:32:06,470 --> 00:32:07,310
What?

598
00:32:08,190 --> 00:32:09,030
No.

599
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,710
This is my studio.

600
00:32:10,710 --> 00:32:12,230
Even if I didn't finish work on time,

601
00:32:12,395 --> 00:32:13,950
you can't just dismiss me so recklessly.

602
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,100
No need to explain.

603
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,020
See for yourself.

604
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:19,440
If you don't understand,
get a lawyer to teach you.

605
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,380
Also,

606
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,780
this woman is mine now.

607
00:32:27,020 --> 00:32:27,860
What?

608
00:32:28,230 --> 00:32:29,780
Please take good care of me.

609
00:32:30,260 --> 00:32:31,100
Lin Sa, you...

610
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:32,340
Hey, you.

611
00:32:33,100 --> 00:32:34,190
He's also mine from now on.

612
00:32:35,470 --> 00:32:36,470
Triple of yours.

613
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,580
Sorry.

614
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:41,230
Just black tea.

615
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:42,630
Oh, very sorry.

616
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:46,190
One minute has passed.

617
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:48,910
Mr. Yu, you should leave.

618
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,300
- I...
- From now on,

619
00:32:51,630 --> 00:32:54,300
this is Ou Yang's studio.

620
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:58,820
This thing looks so annoying.

621
00:33:00,060 --> 00:33:00,900
Throw it away.

622
00:33:00,910 --> 00:33:01,790
Right now.

623
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:02,690
Coming.

624
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:03,860
Wu.

625
00:33:06,630 --> 00:33:08,100
Wu, don't!

626
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:14,860
Who?

627
00:33:18,540 --> 00:33:19,380
Who?

628
00:33:32,150 --> 00:33:32,990
Hi.

629
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,070
What are you doing here?

630
00:33:36,230 --> 00:33:37,740
Ou Yang is too flirtatious.

631
00:33:37,910 --> 00:33:39,820
We decided to ditch that guy.

632
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:42,630
Just saw you feeding him fruit earlier.

633
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:43,910
For you too.

634
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,390
From now on, we follow you.

635
00:33:46,820 --> 00:33:48,340
Obedient in everything.

636
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,630
Do whatever you ask.

637
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:50,910
I don't need that.

638
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:51,950
You do.

639
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,430
It's already 2:14 AM.

640
00:34:07,260 --> 00:34:08,180
Delays are terrifying.

641
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:46,150
This...

642
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,500
What's that sound?

643
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,140
What's meant to come will come.

644
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,750
Why is he so annoying?

645
00:35:23,310 --> 00:35:24,350
(Keeping promises)

646
00:35:24,910 --> 00:35:26,310
(isn't easy,)

647
00:35:26,884 --> 00:35:28,350
(but things promised to others)

648
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:29,790
(must be fulfilled.)

649
00:35:31,660 --> 00:35:33,060
(Showing off is scary.)

650
00:35:58,790 --> 00:35:59,790
Why are you panicking?

651
00:35:59,973 --> 00:36:01,973
Waiting for you to release
the second half.

652
00:36:01,995 --> 00:36:03,270
We couldn't sleep all night.

653
00:36:03,270 --> 00:36:04,180
Now we're late.

654
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,100
We're like this now...

655
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,220
It's all your fault.

656
00:36:07,180 --> 00:36:08,470
You look like those two women.

657
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:10,140
Who?

658
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,020
The women in my dream.

659
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:12,470
Ugh.

660
00:36:18,862 --> 00:36:20,540
I'm very disappointed
in you two traitors.

661
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,150
What?

662
00:36:23,310 --> 00:36:24,790
When did we betray you?

663
00:36:25,270 --> 00:36:26,390
Traitors, don't talk to me.

664
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,100
He's just late.

665
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,020
Saving face.

666
00:36:30,020 --> 00:36:32,100
Just blaming us to distract.

667
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,950
But it's rare that Mr. Yu is late.

668
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:37,180
Design plan, done.

669
00:36:38,470 --> 00:36:39,310
Alright.

670
00:36:45,790 --> 00:36:46,870
Mr. Yu, are you tired?

671
00:36:46,884 --> 00:36:48,350
Want me to pour you some black tea?

672
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:49,790
Absolutely not.

673
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:51,660
Just say it.

674
00:36:51,660 --> 00:36:52,500
Why so fierce?

675
00:36:52,500 --> 00:36:54,310
I want coffee, triple shot.

676
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:07,270
The design plan is done.

677
00:37:07,750 --> 00:37:10,620
Can the materials and construction plan
be finished today?

678
00:37:11,790 --> 00:37:13,540
- Yes.
- If not finished,

679
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,070
tomorrow I can't hand it to the foreman.

680
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:15,950
Then our start time...

681
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:16,990
I said I can.

682
00:37:25,580 --> 00:37:26,420
Well...

683
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:28,910
Mr. Yu is quite irritable today.

684
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,430
Menopause?

685
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,870
Getting older.

686
00:37:35,020 --> 00:37:35,860
Well...

687
00:37:36,430 --> 00:37:38,140
Ou Yang called me this morning.

688
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:41,540
He said he wants to help
finish this project.

689
00:37:41,540 --> 00:37:42,750
Don't mention him to me.

690
00:37:43,100 --> 00:37:45,180
Third and final time I say it,

691
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,660
I can do it myself.

692
00:37:50,990 --> 00:37:51,830
Where's my coffee?

693
00:37:55,390 --> 00:37:56,230
Hmph.

694
00:37:56,990 --> 00:37:57,950
Two traitors.

695
00:38:01,430 --> 00:38:02,540
Scald you.

696
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:08,420
Hmph.

697
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:30,060
It's past ten at night and
still drinking this, not sleeping?

698
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:33,990
Is it ten already?

699
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,140
Thirty-six yuan in total.

700
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,540
(Emergency)

701
00:38:56,910 --> 00:38:58,580
Over fatigue. Nothing serious.

702
00:38:58,706 --> 00:39:00,350
Rest for a few days, and he'll be fine.

703
00:39:01,350 --> 00:39:02,540
Over fatigue?

704
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,500
Probably from staying up late.

705
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:07,390
Then why did he suddenly faint?

706
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:08,790
Low blood sugar?

707
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,020
Not really.

708
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,220
He drank a lot of Red Bull,

709
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,950
so he wouldn't have low blood sugar.

710
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:16,500
But extreme anxiety can affect appetite.

711
00:39:17,180 --> 00:39:18,020
Right.

712
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,420
Yes.

713
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:23,220
I can't eat when I talk to Mom
about his marriage.

714
00:39:24,470 --> 00:39:25,390
I can hear.

715
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:26,990
That's great.

716
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:32,990
I'm fine now.

717
00:39:32,990 --> 00:39:33,910
I'm going to work.

718
00:39:34,790 --> 00:39:35,700
That won't do.

719
00:39:36,700 --> 00:39:38,580
Dr. Gu said your
blood pressure is unstable.

720
00:39:38,580 --> 00:39:39,470
Irregular heartbeat.

721
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,350
You must rest for 48 hours.

722
00:39:41,910 --> 00:39:43,220
Don't listen to her.

723
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,310
She's a doctor after all.

724
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,660
Or you can listen to me.

725
00:39:46,660 --> 00:39:47,580
I'm a doctor too.

726
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:48,870
You're even less reliable.

727
00:39:49,140 --> 00:39:50,950
Mr. Yu, you don't need to rush.

728
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:52,790
Ms. Lin just told me

729
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:55,310
that Ou Yang will help us
complete this project.

730
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,340
Ou Yang?

731
00:39:59,100 --> 00:39:59,940
Forget it.

732
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,580
Anyway, the main design

733
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,060
is almost finished.

734
00:40:03,270 --> 00:40:04,270
Only materials

735
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:05,350
and pricing issues are left.

736
00:40:05,870 --> 00:40:08,140
Even if he's stupid,
he should handle it.

737
00:40:09,790 --> 00:40:10,660
Where's Lin Sa?

738
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:15,180
Lin is in a meeting with Ou Yang.

739
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:20,100
Such a simple thing,
still hand-holding him?

740
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:23,420
Well...

741
00:40:23,750 --> 00:40:25,700
The condition for Ou Yang to take over

742
00:40:26,790 --> 00:40:28,540
is to change your design.

743
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:32,500
What are you doing?

744
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:33,750
I want to stop him.

745
00:40:33,910 --> 00:40:35,660
Are you insane? You need to rest.

746
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:36,790
Mr. Yu, calm down.

747
00:40:36,790 --> 00:40:38,220
That work is already Ou Yang's.

748
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:39,310
Stop talking. Move aside.

749
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,750
No, Mr. Yu.

750
00:40:40,750 --> 00:40:41,590
What are you doing?

751
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:43,950
You didn't stop Ou Yang
from changing my design,

752
00:40:43,950 --> 00:40:44,990
but you stopped me instead?

753
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:46,500
Aren't you supposed to rest?

754
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:47,340
Move aside.

755
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,940
Yu Yu!

756
00:40:50,995 --> 00:40:52,060
What did you just call me?

757
00:40:52,573 --> 00:40:54,390
You're disrespectful!
What are you doing?

758
00:40:54,390 --> 00:40:56,500
It's not that I'm doing anything.
You should rest.

759
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,660
- Move aside!
- I won't!

760
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:58,750
Go away, don't block me!

761
00:40:58,750 --> 00:41:00,310
Stop being so willful!

762
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,540
Listen, I'm your apprentice.

763
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,750
I have to look after you.

764
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:03,990
Then don't be my apprentice.

765
00:41:03,990 --> 00:41:05,060
Get out!

766
00:41:19,910 --> 00:41:21,100
What's wrong with you?

767
00:41:21,350 --> 00:41:22,470
Don't block me either.

768
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:24,500
Yu.

769
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:25,790
Don't be mad.

770
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:27,430
Yu, sit.

771
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,100
Rest well.

772
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:30,430
Come, lie down.

773
00:41:30,430 --> 00:41:31,270
Rest well.

774
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:33,990
(A designer)

775
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,950
(who doesn't finish work on time)

776
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,140
(ends up having their design
changed by someone else.)

777
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:39,220
(Truly a failure.)

778
00:41:54,270 --> 00:41:56,700
You got fired just like that?

779
00:41:57,390 --> 00:41:58,870
Can I still ask about this?

780
00:41:59,140 --> 00:42:00,990
But it doesn't sound quite right.

781
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:03,990
Shall I ask for you again?

782
00:42:04,580 --> 00:42:05,430
Forget it.

783
00:42:05,430 --> 00:42:06,750
I won't trouble you with this.

784
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:09,390
Then why didn't you tell your girlfriend

785
00:42:09,390 --> 00:42:10,620
and call us out?

786
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:13,750
I don't want to bring
this negative mood home.

787
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,180
If you don't bring it home,
bring it to us, huh?

788
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,540
Aren't you my good friends?

789
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:19,470
Friends, right?

790
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:21,084
Share the hardship together. Come.

791
00:42:21,140 --> 00:42:21,980
Come on.

792
00:42:47,060 --> 00:42:47,900
Hi.

793
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
