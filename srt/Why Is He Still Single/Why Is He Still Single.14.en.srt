Mr. Yu.

Who was that person just now?

30
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:14,110
A fool.

31
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,390
Oh.

32
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:21,070
This is my new design draft.

33
00:02:21,128 --> 00:02:22,420
The client is quite satisfied.

34
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,460
I replaced the previous AI version.

35
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,790
Not bad.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,795
Although there are still those
little floral patterns,

37
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,140
for you, it's a milestone.

38
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,740
I allow you to be a little proud.

39
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:41,260
Thanks.

40
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:52,550
Mr. Yu, I have something I want
to discuss with you.

41
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,417
But don't get angry when I say it.

42
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:56,950
I understand.

43
00:02:57,670 --> 00:02:59,270
You're finally going to take that step.

44
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:01,462
I really feel sorry for you.

45
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,740
Which step?

46
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:04,910
Marriage.

47
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,740
Alright.

48
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,817
- By then...
- I want to work independently.

49
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,580
You're leaving too?

50
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:19,020
Who else is leaving?

51
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:22,540
Nothing.

52
00:03:23,417 --> 00:03:25,240
I don't agree
with you working independently.

53
00:03:25,390 --> 00:03:26,230
Why?

54
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:28,090
Look.

55
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:30,420
Just flip a page and I can find
so many mistakes.

56
00:03:30,728 --> 00:03:32,506
How do you expect to work independently?

57
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:34,299
My basic design has no problems.

58
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,520
Just because you don't like it
doesn't mean it's wrong.

59
00:03:36,528 --> 00:03:37,884
We just have different aesthetics.

60
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,990
I have a design concept.

61
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:41,700
Do you?

62
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:43,373
You know very well.

63
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,884
The selling point of my design

64
00:03:44,906 --> 00:03:46,284
is centered on the warm zone.

65
00:03:46,551 --> 00:03:47,670
What's your selling point?

66
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:49,110
What's your design concept?

67
00:03:49,373 --> 00:03:50,440
Little floral patterns?

68
00:03:50,460 --> 00:03:51,620
Back when I joined,

69
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:53,173
you didn't have a design concept either.

70
00:03:53,195 --> 00:03:53,990
You could find it.

71
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:55,180
I think I can too.

72
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,180
It's not that easy.

73
00:03:59,140 --> 00:03:59,980
Mr. Yu.

74
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,300
If you think my design skills
are problematic,

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,140
I don't accept that.

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,070
I'm going independent.

77
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,230
But if you want me to stay and help you,

78
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:07,510
I'm not saying I must leave.

79
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,300
I don't need you to stay and help me.

80
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:10,860
I just want to tell you,

81
00:04:10,862 --> 00:04:12,070
if you go independent now,

82
00:04:12,070 --> 00:04:13,620
you're headed for disaster.

83
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:15,460
Then tell me, when can I go independent?

84
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,900
Mr. Yu.

85
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,990
Back when you kept me, it was because

86
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:29,260
you thought I had potential.

87
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,910
So now tell me, where is my future?

88
00:04:36,260 --> 00:04:37,420
At this desk?

Why are you following me?

91
00:05:33,484 --> 00:05:35,195
It's your fault for leaving work
too early.

92
00:05:35,217 --> 00:05:36,928
I couldn't visit you at the hospital.

95
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,590
She's leaving?

96
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:49,940
So irresponsible.

97
00:05:50,728 --> 00:05:51,940
You don't want her to leave?

98
00:05:53,084 --> 00:05:54,620
It's not that I don't want her to go.

99
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,420
I just feel that if she leaves,

100
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:58,260
my work will be inconvenient.

101
00:05:58,506 --> 00:05:59,660
Efficiency will be affected.

102
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:01,860
If it's not about reluctance,

103
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:03,860
you need to respect her choice.

104
00:06:04,328 --> 00:06:05,860
If you don't want her to leave,

105
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,350
you have to show some sincerity.

106
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,110
Think more about her.

107
00:06:09,173 --> 00:06:10,528
Don't always think of yourself.

108
00:06:11,684 --> 00:06:13,262
Why are you speaking for her?

109
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:14,662
Listen or not, it's up to you.

110
00:06:14,662 --> 00:06:16,195
If you don't want to listen, go home.

111
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:17,300
Don't disturb my reading.

00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,140
Beginner level.

115
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,500
I'll recommend one too.

116
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:35,860

Alright.

125
00:07:36,710 --> 00:07:38,260
No cooking, no shoes.

00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:40,070
Go ahead and play then.

I'm her assistant.

135

If she leaves,

136
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:10,060
there won't be a suitable position
for me.

137
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:12,620
Ms. Lin is leaving?

138
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:13,910
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

139
00:08:14,106 --> 00:08:15,549
She wasn't even sure before.

140
00:08:15,550 --> 00:08:16,710
What was I supposed to say?

141
00:08:16,710 --> 00:08:18,150
If you had told me earlier,

142
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,470
I wouldn't have gone solo.

143
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:21,590
What does your going solo

144
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:23,380
have to do with her changing jobs?

145
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,060
If she quits and I go solo too,

146
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:26,710
isn't that rubbing salt
in Mr. Yu's wound?

147
00:08:26,710 --> 00:08:28,060
Why are you yelling at me?

148
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:28,940
I'm not yelling.

149
00:08:28,940 --> 00:08:29,820
I'm just asking,

150
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:30,940
why didn't you tell me earlier

151
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:32,020
that she was leaving?

152
00:08:32,060 --> 00:08:33,995
If you had told me,
I wouldn't have done this.

153
00:08:34,017 --> 00:08:34,950
Now I look ungrateful.

154
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,350
You're yelling at me because of him?

155
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:37,590
What "him"? That's Mr. Yu.

156
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,470
Mr. Yu.

157
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:39,620
Then stay with Mr. Yu!

158
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,310

What?

167
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,430
Daring to fight? Seriously?

168
00:09:34,528 --> 00:09:36,640
It's already enough that I clean up
after you at work.

169
00:09:36,662 --> 00:09:38,417
Now I have to pay your fine
at the station

170
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,217
and get you out.

171
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,710
Alright, stop lecturing him.

172
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,040
He actually lost the fight.

173
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:42,900
I didn't lose!

174
00:09:42,928 --> 00:09:44,262
You can't even beat Ou Yang?

175
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:45,150
Embarrassing.

176
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,380
Why did you hit Ou Yang?

177
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:55,620
He called Mr. Yu garbage.

178
00:09:56,780 --> 00:09:57,900
I did the design.

179
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:59,470
How could he insult Mr. Yu?

180
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,900
It's my fault the studio got criticized.

00:10:05,710 --> 00:10:07,310
Mr. Yu taught me for five whole years.

183
00:10:07,328 --> 00:10:09,662
He could talk about any tiny problem
for an hour.

184
00:10:09,684 --> 00:10:11,500
My phone recordings
are full because of him.

185
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,830
How dare he insult Mr. Yu?

186
00:10:13,128 --> 00:10:15,595
Without Mr. Yu,
there wouldn't be the Wu I am today.

187
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,990
Mr. Yu is my mentor.

188
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,260
No one is allowed to insult him.

189
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:21,350
No matter what, you can't hit people.

190
00:10:21,795 --> 00:10:23,430
If you hit people, who would hire you?

191
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,660
Aren't you planning to go solo?

192
00:10:25,710 --> 00:10:26,550
Go solo?

193
00:10:26,662 --> 00:10:28,020
You want to start your own?

194
00:10:28,230 --> 00:10:30,540
No, I'm not. I won't go solo.

195
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:32,020
I won't leave Mr. Yu.

196
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:34,260
Even the greatest general
needs soldiers.

197
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:37,380
How could I leave?
If I leave, who will take care of him?

198
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,817
Who asked you to take care of me?

199
00:10:39,706 --> 00:10:41,020
Take care of yourself first.

200
00:10:47,780 --> 00:10:48,780
Cut it out.

201
00:10:49,551 --> 00:10:51,350
What solo career are you talking about?

202
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:19,140
(Name: Shen Wu)
(File: Personal Resume)

203
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:26,372
(I am a fresh graduate in
interior architecture design.)

204
00:11:26,396 --> 00:11:28,180
(Through this resume,
you will get to know me. Shen Wu.)

205
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:36,380
("My Dream" Shen Wu,
Personal Introduction Video)

206
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:38,070
Hello, Mr. Yu. I'm Shen Wu.

207
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,070
I'm 25 this year.

208
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,590
My dream is to become
a designer like you,

209
00:11:41,590 --> 00:11:43,990
to create homes that feel warm
and full of happiness.

210
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,740
I hope under your guidance,

211
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:47,110
I can achieve my dream.

212
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,879
Back when you kept me,

213
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,710
it was because you thought
I had potential.

214
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:54,710
So now tell me, where is my future?

215
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:55,950
At this desk?

216
00:11:55,973 --> 00:11:56,990
If you go independent now,

217
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,500
you're headed for disaster.

218
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,500
Then tell me, when can I go independent?

219
00:12:20,950 --> 00:12:21,790
Mr. Yu.

220
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,340
Hello.

221
00:12:24,351 --> 00:12:25,830
I'm a reporter from the TV station.

222
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,230
You didn't answer my call,

223
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:29,590
so I took the liberty of coming
to wait for you.

224
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,900
Sorry, I didn't notice the call.

225
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:32,350
It's alright.

226
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:35,020
I'd like to schedule
an interview with you.

227
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,110
Would that be okay?

228
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:38,500
Interview?

229
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:30,500
What do you mean?

230
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,950
You were in such a hurry
to call me for help

231
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,217
but you didn't even let me in.

232
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:36,900
Is that dignified?

233
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,110
Can't you see

234
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:40,817
I've tried to be as proper as possible?

235
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,380
Sit, don't be shy.

236
00:13:45,590 --> 00:13:47,110
For the sake of this fruit platter.

237
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:50,830
Actually, I don't want
to trouble you either.

238
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,590
It's just that doing a TV interview
is really troublesome.

239
00:13:54,470 --> 00:13:56,350
Being on TV is great.

240
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:58,020
More fame, more business.

241
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,350
That's why I asked you to help me

242
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,540
pick an appropriate outfit.

243
00:14:02,230 --> 00:14:03,260
Sit and eat.

244
00:14:04,070 --> 00:14:04,910
Wait a moment.

245
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,970
Look.

246
00:14:18,990 --> 00:14:21,190
White shirt, and blue suit.

247
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,600
With pants.

248
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:24,070
I wear this often. How about it?

249
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:27,270
Boring.

250
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,580
Wait a moment.

251
00:14:32,595 --> 00:14:33,884
I'll change to another set.

252
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,020
You'll like this one.

253
00:14:38,710 --> 00:14:39,990
Casual with a touch of formality,

254
00:14:40,173 --> 00:14:42,110
and formal with a hint of casual.
How about it?

255
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:44,500
The colors are good.

256
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,740
But it looks a bit like
everyday office wear.

257
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:48,910
No problem.

258
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:50,262
I have plenty of clothes.

259
00:14:50,380 --> 00:14:51,220
Have a seat.

260
00:14:53,906 --> 00:14:55,262
The door isn't properly closed.

261
00:14:57,728 --> 00:14:59,430
This set has a completely
different style.

262
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,900
White shirt with knitwear,

263
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,590
matched with a gray coat,

264
00:15:02,590 --> 00:15:03,728
and jeans on the bottom.

265
00:15:04,590 --> 00:15:05,430
How about it?

266
00:15:07,350 --> 00:15:08,350
This one's nice,

267
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:10,710
but too casual.

268
00:15:12,710 --> 00:15:14,470
I got it. How about you try

269
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:16,600
top from the second set,
and pants from the third set.

270
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,310
Top from the second set,

271
00:15:19,195 --> 00:15:20,430
and pants from the first set.

272
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:21,500
Third set.

Hmph.

287
00:16:16,230 --> 00:16:17,380
I'm talented beyond my looks.

288
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,310
I've got talent here too.

289
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,030
By the way,

290
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:22,780
I've mastered

291
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,190
your surgery skills.

292
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,620
And my architecture basics...

293
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,580
How's that going?

294
00:16:27,951 --> 00:16:28,990
Can you build a house yet?

295

Here's a suggestion.

296
00:16:31,310 --> 00:16:32,350
During the interview,

297
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,780
watch your words carefully.

298
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:35,100
Don't worry.

299
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:37,740
My wording this time will be perfect.

300
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,590
Xiaoxiao, I was wrong.

301
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:48,430
I should have put your slippers away

302
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,020
before you came home from work,

303
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:51,740
and prepared your meal.

304
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,860
I shouldn't have raised my voice

305
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,430
or lectured you.

306
00:16:55,430 --> 00:16:56,969
I shouldn't be so stubborn with you.

307
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:58,728
I shouldn't have gotten angry with you

308
00:16:58,751 --> 00:16:59,590
over Yu Yu.

309
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,740
I was completely wrong.

310
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:05,230
Finished?

311
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,180
No.

312
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:08,710
Go on.

313
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:09,940
From now on,

314
00:17:10,100 --> 00:17:11,780
Xiaoxiao, whatever you say is right.

315
00:17:14,580 --> 00:17:15,420
Hey.

316
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,630
I told you to kneel.

317
00:17:16,630 --> 00:17:17,710
Why are you sitting?

318
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,740
(Sales Bible)

319
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:21,430
As the saying goes,

320
00:17:21,430 --> 00:17:22,780
"Under a man's knees lies gold".

321
00:17:22,817 --> 00:17:24,770
Durian can't pierce through gold,

322
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:26,540
so I sit here to reflect on my mistakes.

323
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:28,990
Quick, get up.

324
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,470
How can you eat while sitting?

325
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,540
It's smelly by nature anyway.

326
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:36,870
Don't be mad.

327
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:40,710
Well...

328
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,910
Don't be mad.

329
00:17:46,230 --> 00:17:47,950
Mr. Yu has a TV interview soon.

330
00:17:47,950 --> 00:17:49,100
Let's take a look at him.

331
00:17:49,260 --> 00:17:50,740
What's so special about him?

332
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:53,060
You already said you won't go solo,

333
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,551
and he doesn't appreciate it either.

334
00:17:54,551 --> 00:17:56,630
Ah, why are you jealous?

335
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:57,780
He's just that kind of person.

336
00:17:57,780 --> 00:17:58,670
I'm not leaving now.

337
00:17:58,670 --> 00:17:59,884
He must be quite happy inside.

338
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:01,020
Time is running out.

339
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:02,750
Take a look at him.

340
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:04,100
(No doubt.)

341
00:18:04,128 --> 00:18:06,973
(Yu Yu, Senior Designer)
(So the main focus is my design concept)

342
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,020
(is centered on the warm zone.)

343
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:10,470
(Basically, yes.)

344
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:13,870
(Okay, now let's take a look)

345
00:18:13,870 --> 00:18:14,870
(at Mr. Yu's works.)

346
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:16,620
(Harmony between Home and Nature)
(The warm zone)

347
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:18,230
(is an important space in the home.)

348
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:19,670
I don't see anything special here.

349
00:18:19,950 --> 00:18:22,580
He's just doing
all that humble bragging.

350
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,950
Boasting, and what else?

351
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:26,630
(The happiness gained at home.)

352
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:29,820
(What you see on the screen now...)

353
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:31,230
- Wu.
- (His name is Shen Wu.)

354
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,100
You.

355
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,020
Since when did you install surveillance?

356
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:34,860
(All these years...)

357
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:35,730
To watch the dog.

358
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:37,195
(He's been meticulous all along,)

359
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,260
(diligently working for me,)

360
00:18:40,670 --> 00:18:41,950
(often staying late at night.)

361
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,630
Not that often, though.

362
00:18:44,773 --> 00:18:46,151
I only stayed late that one time.

363
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,190
Mr. Yu lied.

364
00:18:49,470 --> 00:18:50,540
He did lie.

365
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,380
Watch again.

366
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,190
(Hello, Mr. Yu, I'm Shen Wu.)

367
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,190
(I'm 25 this year.)

(creating homes that bring happiness
and warmth.)

370
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,910
(I hope under your guidance,)

371
00:19:01,060 --> 00:19:02,260
(I can achieve my dream.)

372
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,630
Mr. Yu still keeps the video
of my initial interview.

373
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,500
Yes.

374
00:19:07,540 --> 00:19:08,380
(At the same time,)

375

(he is also my student.)

376
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,430
(But now he's gone solo,)

377
00:19:15,240 --> 00:19:16,820
(becoming an independent designer.)

378
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,020
(If you don't like my work,)

379
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,617
(feel free to consult him.)

380
00:19:24,484 --> 00:19:25,995
(He has a better temper than me,)

381
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,500
(easier to compromise.)

382
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,710
(If he doesn't do well,)

383
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,500
(don't scold him.)

384
00:19:33,884 --> 00:19:35,390
(You can discuss properly with him.)

386
00:19:40,710 --> 00:19:41,580
I am here

387
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,580

388
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:45,150
to realize your dream soon.

389
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,150
I'll be behind you,

390
00:19:49,910 --> 00:19:50,750
cheering for you.

391
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,540
Okay, Mr. Yu.

392
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:08,340
He agreed...

393
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:13,820
I think I misunderstood him.

394
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:48,230
I watched the interview.

395
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,300
What do you mean by that?

396
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,020
See him off.

397
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:43,300
I'm leaving, Mr. Yu.

398
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,470
Take care of yourself.

449
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:11,820
me, Mr. Yu, Wu...

450
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,340
The three of us

451
00:25:14,740 --> 00:25:17,020
have formed a very stable structure.

452
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:20,060
Now, both sides have left.

453
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,580
The middle

454
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:24,150
will naturally collapse.

455
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,300
Mr. Yu will definitely fall.

456
00:25:33,780 --> 00:25:35,300
But he will get up quickly.

457
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,710
But I worry,

458
00:25:41,950 --> 00:25:42,990
if he falls too hard,

459
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,540
he won't get up.

460
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:48,390
If you're really worried
he'll fall hard,

461
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,630
just lay a mat for him.

462
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:51,990
Give him some support.

463
00:25:52,017 --> 00:25:54,173
So he won't fall and hurt so badly,
that's it.

464
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,380
You're right.

465
00:25:59,551 --> 00:26:01,230
I can't just cause the problem
and leave.

466
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:03,630
I have to handle the aftermath
before leaving.

467
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,060
Exactly.

468
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:06,820
I'll go get the medicine.

469
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:09,100
Okay. Contact me anytime
if anything happens.

470
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
Mm, thanks.

471
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:10,940
No problem.

472
00:26:12,340 --> 00:26:13,180
- Leaving.
- Bye.

473
00:26:25,710 --> 00:26:26,550
Huh?

474
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,990
What new performance art is this?

475
00:26:29,820 --> 00:26:30,820
Pulled my back.

476
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:32,670
Old arms and legs.

477
00:26:32,684 --> 00:26:33,684
Be careful.

478
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,230
Wu left.

479
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,870
The company says you alone

480
00:26:41,870 --> 00:26:43,820
occupying this whole studio is a waste.

481
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,580
So a new designer will be assigned.

482
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,580
Why? I don't agree.

483
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:49,580
Don't do that.

484
00:26:49,662 --> 00:26:50,750
It's not your decision.

485
00:26:50,951 --> 00:26:52,300
This studio belongs to the company.

486
00:26:56,430 --> 00:26:57,910
Come in, new designer.

487
00:26:58,670 --> 00:26:59,510
Mr. Yu!

488
00:27:02,500 --> 00:27:03,340
Hello, Mr. Yu.

489
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:04,580
My name is Shen Wu,

490
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
nickname Wu.

491
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,306
I'm the company's newly signed designer,

492
00:27:07,328 --> 00:27:08,740
also under Ms. Lin's supervision.

493
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,780
Already can't fit in so soon?

494
00:27:16,230 --> 00:27:17,070
Hi.

495
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,540
All arranged by Ms. Lin.

496
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,420
Mr. Yu.

497
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:22,670
Please take care of me from now on.

498
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:25,060
Be firm.

499
00:27:25,390 --> 00:27:27,060
You're now on the same level as him.

500
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,060
Who's on the same level?

501
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:29,820
I'm a senior designer.

502
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:33,190
But at least someone
can share utility bills.

503
00:27:33,617 --> 00:27:35,060
That's also quite practical.

504
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,740
Don't worry.

505
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:37,580
No arrears.

506
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:38,540
Mr. Yu,

507
00:27:38,540 --> 00:27:40,430
for projects your studio can't finish,

508
00:27:40,430 --> 00:27:41,430
you can assign them to me.

509
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,390
Shen Wu Studio will

510
00:27:42,910 --> 00:27:43,750

511
00:27:46,780 --> 00:27:47,620

Hey, Mr. Yu.

513
00:27:53,230 --> 00:27:54,100
Oh, right, Mr. Yu.

514
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,300
I've already decided.

515
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:59,340
My future design style will be
English country style.

516
00:27:59,662 --> 00:28:01,349
- English country style?
- Yes.

517
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,430
With small floral patterns?

518
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:03,484
You're going against me.

519
00:28:03,780 --> 00:28:05,580
No, that's a successful project of mine.

520
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:06,820
That's just that one project.

521
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:08,817
We're on the same level now.

522
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:09,900
Don't interfere with me.

523
00:28:09,910 --> 00:28:11,100

524
00:28:11,128 --> 00:28:12,020

525

but status is equal.

531
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,540
You're too naive.

532

My original work.

Yes.

Whoa.

539
00:29:18,973 --> 00:29:21,395
(Shen Wu Design Studio, Yu Yu)
Mr. Yu, you wrote me a sign.

540
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,470
Not gonna lie,

541
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,062
this handwriting is really good.

542
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:26,670
If you can draw, you can write.

543
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:29,230
And drawing is a basic skill
for a designer.

544
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:30,670
Which designer can't draw?

545
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:32,230
- Me.
- Illiterate and unskilled.

546
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,950
I'm going to frame it.

547
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,630
Where should I hang it?

548
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,230
How about here, Mr. Yu?

549
00:29:38,430 --> 00:29:39,270
Up to you.

550
00:29:39,817 --> 00:29:41,100

00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:51,190
Ms. Lin isn't coming back?

555
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,670
How can you do this?

556
00:29:52,670 --> 00:29:53,910
Then what about my house?

557
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:55,340
Can you convince my husband?

558
00:29:56,670 --> 00:29:57,510
Convince what?

559
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,990
You're too irresponsible.

560
00:29:59,990 --> 00:30:01,373
Don't even know what to convince.

561
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,190
Don't worry.
Let's talk it through slowly.

562
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:05,670
Fine, I'll explain to you again.

563
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,510
Alright.

564
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,580
Take a look at this first.

565
00:30:09,710 --> 00:30:10,820
The child is so cute.

566
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:11,820
So lifelike.

567
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:14,780
Dolls made of dough have no soul.

568
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,060
You don't understand.

569
00:30:16,284 --> 00:30:17,540
Have you really looked at it?

570
00:30:17,540 --> 00:30:18,870
Why does it have no soul?

571
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,780
I mean white dough isn't suitable
for making dolls.

572
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,100
This is called dough modeling.

573
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,430
It's an art in China
for hundreds of years.

574
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:27,500
You just point fingers
without understanding.

575
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:28,950
If I told you,

576
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:31,340
your designed house has no soul,

577
00:30:31,340 --> 00:30:32,230
how would you feel?

578
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,170
Would you like it?

579
00:30:33,190 --> 00:30:34,060
I do interiors.

580
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:37,430
Hmph, so this is how you argue
with clients?

581
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:38,390
Don't rush.

582
00:30:38,390 --> 00:30:39,430
Sorry, don't rush.

583
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:40,540
Let me ask.

584
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:42,973
What does this little figure
have to do with your house?

585
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:44,470
I see.

586
00:30:45,150 --> 00:30:47,150
My house has two bedrooms
and a living room.

587
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,670
One is a bedroom.

588
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,950
I want the other
as a dough modeling studio.

589
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:54,190
But my husband wants it
as a study to write novels.

590
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,580
Ms. Lin promised me

591
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,060
that she could convince my husband.

592
00:30:57,390 --> 00:30:58,670
That's why I came to you.

593
00:31:00,573 --> 00:31:01,710
Now that Ms. Lin isn't here,

594
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,195
we can also convince your husband.

595
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:07,900
You guys?

596
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:08,950
I think never mind.

597
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:10,390
I don't trust you.

598
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:11,830
Goodbye.

599
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,300
I...

600
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:14,300
What's wrong with us?

601
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,990
Why did you say that?

602
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:22,780
I just wanted to tell her

603
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:24,820
the dough back then
was different from now.

604
00:31:25,100 --> 00:31:26,595
The grain ratio is different too.

605
00:31:26,670 --> 00:31:28,470
So it lost its former soul.

606
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,106
I hadn't finished and she left.

607
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:31,790
Alas.

608
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,740
Back then,

609
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:36,340
it was about Guan Yu cooking liquor
to kill Hua Xiong.

610
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:37,550
Here...

611
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:41,630
Clients got upset.

612
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,630
Mr. Yu, how about this?

613
00:31:43,684 --> 00:31:45,580
Next time,
I'll negotiate with clients for you.

614
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,140
Negotiate what?

615
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:48,390
Blame Lin Sa.

616
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:49,710
Irresponsible.

617
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:52,190
She quit before even leaving.

618
00:31:52,710 --> 00:31:55,100
She had a birthday banquet tonight.

619
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,150
Took leave in advance.

620
00:31:57,070 --> 00:31:57,930
Birthday banquet?

621
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,910
Yeah, let's go together.

622
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
I'm not going.

623
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,540
You can't bring work emotions

624
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:04,710
into your personal life.

625
00:32:04,710 --> 00:32:05,550
You know that, right?

626
00:32:05,570 --> 00:32:07,150
So you're on the same level
as me, huh?

627
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:08,817
Now you have the right
to lecture me, huh?

628
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,310
Do as you like.

629
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:13,340
Do as you like.

630
00:32:28,620 --> 00:32:33,140
(January 31st)

631
00:32:50,710 --> 00:32:52,630
Thank you all for coming
to my birthday party.

632
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:53,630
Happy birthday!

633
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,470
Ah, keep your voice down.

634
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,150
So rustic.

635
00:32:57,630 --> 00:32:59,230
I forgot this is a high-end place.

636
00:32:59,500 --> 00:33:00,870
Happy birthday, Ms. Lin.

637
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:05,500
It's my first time
at such a fancy restaurant.

638
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:07,630
Look, I'm in formal attire.

639
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:08,470
Looks good.

640
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,973
Especially like bridesmaids.

641
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:12,740
Everyone, sit down.

642
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:20,100
- Wu.
- Yes?

643
00:33:20,230 --> 00:33:21,417
I have something to tell you.

644
00:33:21,430 --> 00:33:22,270
Go ahead.

645
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:23,470
Starting tomorrow,

646
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:26,230
Xiaoxiao will be your
and Mr. Yu's assistant.

647
00:33:26,230 --> 00:33:27,070
What?

648
00:33:27,070 --> 00:33:28,710
Surprised? Shocked?

649
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:30,260
From now on, we can go to work together.

650
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:31,870
I can use your bus card.

651
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:34,380
But, Ms. Lin,

652
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,870
why let Xiaoxiao be our assistant?

653
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,340
Can't you see it?

654
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:43,500
Aren't you not coming?

655
00:33:45,210 --> 00:33:46,919
You're shoving Wang Xiaoxiao onto me?

656
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:49,328
Are you making arrangements
for the future or being cautious?

657
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:51,780
Since Mr. Yu is here,

658
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,820
just sit down first.

659
00:33:53,430 --> 00:33:55,710
Waiter, serve a drink to this gentleman.

660
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,780
Mr. Yu, you're here just in time.

661
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,020
Go persuade her quickly.

662
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:01,860
Don't let her leave.

663
00:34:02,395 --> 00:34:04,262
I have no right to interfere
with her freedom.

664
00:34:04,340 --> 00:34:06,484
If she thinks it's better
for her career, she can go.

665
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:07,420
I don't care.

666
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:15,910
It's her birthday today.

667
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:17,310
What are you here for?

668
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:25,500
Happy birthday.

669
00:34:25,990 --> 00:34:27,750
Wow!

670
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:30,470
I got a birthday gift? Thanks.

671
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:37,910
What is this thing?

672
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:39,580
This is bismuth trioxide.

673
00:34:40,540 --> 00:34:41,660
A rare metal.

674
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:43,870
On the periodic table,

675
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:45,470
it's in group VA, period 6.

676
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:49,350
This element was discovered
in the 15th century.

677
00:34:49,870 --> 00:34:51,660
Ancient Romans used it for trays.

678
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:54,430
Its half-life is 19 quintillion years.

679
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,950
Meaning even if humanity dies out,

680
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,020
it won't go bad.

681
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:00,590
Got it.

682
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:02,580
Wishing me longevity.

683
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,790
- Long life!
- Long life!

684
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,190
Thanks.

685
00:35:11,020 --> 00:35:13,430
Is this the romance of a science guy?

686
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,700
Kind of puzzling but cute.

687
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,540
Alright, everyone heard that.

688
00:35:21,310 --> 00:35:23,620
Have you made up your mind?

689
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:26,950
Well...

690
00:35:27,928 --> 00:35:29,728
I'll sign the contract tomorrow night.

691
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:32,620
Then I'll hand over things
at the company.

692
00:35:33,390 --> 00:35:34,230
I will...

693
00:35:34,910 --> 00:35:35,870
I'll go to Beijing.

694
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:40,750
Hmph, what?

695
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,470
I really like this thing.

696
00:35:44,580 --> 00:35:45,950
Come on, eat.

697
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:40,100
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

698
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:07,940
Goodbye.

699
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:26,180
(Shen Wu Design Studio)

700
00:37:32,620 --> 00:37:34,540
Shen Wu Design Studio.

701
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,830
Congrats.

702
00:37:36,140 --> 00:37:37,270
You're independent now.

703
00:37:37,270 --> 00:37:38,220
Wow!

704
00:37:39,862 --> 00:37:41,106
What are you two doing?

705
00:37:42,128 --> 00:37:43,540
Trying to take over my studio?

706
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:46,790
How did it end up like this?

707
00:37:49,906 --> 00:37:51,020
What's with this plaque?

708
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:52,930
Well...

709
00:37:52,950 --> 00:37:54,100
I wanted to frame it,

710
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,950
but the shop owner

711
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:55,830
heard it as a plaque.

712
00:37:55,928 --> 00:37:58,373
In the end, gave me a 30% discount.
I thought it was worth it.

713
00:37:59,750 --> 00:38:00,990
Full of small flowers.

714
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,470
Tacky.

715
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:04,660
Intriguing.

716
00:38:05,700 --> 00:38:06,540
Mr. Yu.

717
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:09,580
I put lunch on your desk.

718
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:11,060
Work report.

719
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:13,470
I've already declined

720
00:38:13,470 --> 00:38:14,580
Mr. Wang's project for you.

721
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,462
Wu, Mr. Wang's project
was successfully signed this morning.

722
00:38:18,484 --> 00:38:19,700
Congrats on your first deal.

723
00:38:20,106 --> 00:38:22,930
The person I want to decline is not
the Wang with three strokes on the left.

724
00:38:23,950 --> 00:38:25,580
Well, he is my client.

725
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,540
Wrong again?

726
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:31,310
Forget it. Doesn't matter.

727
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,084
Even if the company signed the contract,
I won't design for him.

728
00:38:34,390 --> 00:38:35,230
Wu.

729
00:38:35,390 --> 00:38:36,230
You take it.

730
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:38,100
- Mr. Yu.
- Sorry, Mr. Yu.

731
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,230
Wu.

732
00:38:42,390 --> 00:38:43,390
- I...
- It's okay.

733
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,950
Let's go explain.

734
00:38:45,140 --> 00:38:46,210
- Let's go.
- Okay.

735
00:38:46,660 --> 00:38:47,540
We're leaving, Mr. Yu.

736
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:09,660
Did you eat something that wasn't fresh?

737
00:39:10,310 --> 00:39:12,540
Looking at this lab report,
nothing serious.

738
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:14,500
I seriously suspect

739
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:15,790
Wang Xiaoxiao and Shen Wu

740
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,830
want to completely take over my studio.

741
00:39:18,140 --> 00:39:19,310
So they poisoned my food.

742
00:39:20,100 --> 00:39:22,060
You really like to assume
the worst about others.

743
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,660
I can't even work properly now,

744
00:39:26,106 --> 00:39:28,151
and I still have to deal
with some white-dough dolls.

745
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:29,790
If I can't work in peace,

746
00:39:30,100 --> 00:39:33,020
the houses I design can't bring joy
to people.

747
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,380
Actually, I...

748
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:40,390
Oh, I understand.

749
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:44,180
If you need her so much at work,

750
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,620
you should keep her.

751
00:39:48,300 --> 00:39:49,180
It's come to this.

752
00:39:49,180 --> 00:39:50,270
What else can I say?

753
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:51,830
It's your fault.

754
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:53,100
Telling me not to be selfish.

755
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:55,462
Telling me to see things
from others' perspectives.

756
00:39:56,310 --> 00:39:57,830
And now you blame me?

757
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,430
Do as you like.

758
00:39:59,660 --> 00:40:00,500
Fend for yourself.

759
00:40:00,528 --> 00:40:02,062
I won't care about you anymore.

760
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:04,500
No sympathy at all.

761
00:40:04,973 --> 00:40:06,020
You call yourself a doctor?

762
00:40:06,500 --> 00:40:07,390
So cold.

763
00:40:10,995 --> 00:40:13,640
You don't mean you want me
to speak for you, right?

764
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:17,470
If you really want to speak
on my behalf,

765
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,600
it's possible.

766
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:19,460
I don't want to.

767
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,060
Alright then, never mind.

768
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:45,750
You're still here?

769
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:48,790
Oh, I have another appointment.

770
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,470
Oh, then I won't bother.

771
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:51,420
Wait.

772
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,140
If she's determined to leave,

773
00:40:57,310 --> 00:40:58,470
you can't keep her.

774
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,180
But if she's indecisive,

775
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:02,950
your attitude matters a lot.

776
00:41:05,350 --> 00:41:06,190
Really?

777
00:41:06,910 --> 00:41:10,500
You two have been colleagues,
friends, and partners for so many years.

778
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:12,500
If she leaves,

779
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,660
and you don't say a word,

780
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,350
she will be very hurt.

781
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:18,310
Don't hurt others' hearts,

782
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:20,430
and don't hurt your own heart.

783
00:41:40,370 --> 00:41:42,270
("Shaky Human World" documentary)
(Give me this booklet.)

784
00:41:42,270 --> 00:41:43,390
(One for knowledge,
and one for delight.)

785
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:44,470
(Why give it to you?)

786
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,020
(As a graduation keepsake.)

787
00:41:49,100 --> 00:41:51,580
Everyone has mostly looked
through the materials.

788
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:54,350
Our meeting is about to start.

789
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,470
Next month's tasks

790
00:41:57,830 --> 00:42:00,620
are the showrooms of four properties.

791
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:01,590
Any questions?

792
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:03,460
I have a question.

793
00:42:03,870 --> 00:42:04,710
Go ahead.

794
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,660
You know Lin Sa is allergic to dog hair,

795
00:42:06,662 --> 00:42:08,640
yet you insist on keeping a dog
in the office.

796
00:42:08,830 --> 00:42:11,620
Choose between me and your dog.

797
00:42:14,100 --> 00:42:15,220
Why did you resign too?

798
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:16,790
He chose the dog.

799
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:17,630
Why wouldn't I leave?

800
00:42:19,310 --> 00:42:21,470
I want to start my own studio.

801
00:42:22,620 --> 00:42:23,460
Sure.

802
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:27,540
But I want a manager and partner.

803
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,500
Someone to help me handle business.

804
00:42:31,660 --> 00:42:34,020
You want me to be your partner?

805
00:42:42,990 --> 00:42:45,100
Hello, Mr. Yu, anything?

806
00:42:45,750 --> 00:42:46,590
Xiaoxiao.

807
00:42:47,284 --> 00:42:49,173
Where is Lin Sa signing the contract?

808
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
