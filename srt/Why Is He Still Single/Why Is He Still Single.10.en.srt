"Little Women" is such

39
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,390
a good film.

40
00:03:15,830 --> 00:03:17,300
I read the novel,

41
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:18,860
but I didn't really get it.

42
00:03:18,884 --> 00:03:20,420
Now that I've experienced more of life,

43
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,860
I realize how brave the heroine is.

44
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,300
Here's to being brave.

45
00:03:26,662 --> 00:03:28,550
Why hasn't "Little Women"
been returned yet?

46
00:03:28,550 --> 00:03:29,706
I've been waiting forever.

47
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,670
Don't know.

48
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:32,950
Check who rented it.

49
00:03:32,950 --> 00:03:33,990
What gives?

50
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,230
Why should I tell you?

51
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,950
I'm a professional.

52
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:39,070
I have to protect my clients' privacy.

53
00:03:39,528 --> 00:03:40,580
If you're that desperate,

54
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:41,790
watch it online.

55
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:42,790
Just be patient.

56
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:43,790
Why should I?

57
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:46,510
Didn't you say there was a new set?

58
00:03:46,528 --> 00:03:47,580
I'll buy that one instead.

59
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:50,550
Oh, right.

60
00:03:50,973 --> 00:03:52,660
Didn't you say
I gave you a terrible deal?

61
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,020
So I sold it to someone else.

62
00:03:55,390 --> 00:03:56,550
You're the worst.

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,950
Jia.

64
00:04:01,180 --> 00:04:03,270
How'd you feel about the film?

65
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,510
A great movie is like a mirror.

66
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:11,270
It makes you look at your own life

67
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:12,740
through someone else's story.

68
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,670
That's quite a clever line.

69
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:23,790
But I don't want to give up marriage
just to chase freedom.

70
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,260
I want both.

71
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:27,470
I've always wanted a relationship

72
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,620
and a big family.

73
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:30,750
Do you think

74
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:34,260
that makes me shallow?

75
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:35,500
Not at all.

76
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:37,740
Wanting love and company

77
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,990
isn't shallow.

78
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:41,180
Besides,

79
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:43,500
what matters is you know what you want.

80
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:45,940
That already
puts you ahead of most people.

81
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:49,820
Xiaoman,
you should have more confidence.

82
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,430
Okay.

83
00:04:55,106 --> 00:04:57,060
So, what kind of person
are you looking for?

84
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:01,910
I've talked about this with my dad.

85
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:03,795
There are three things that matter most.

86
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,910
First, someone you don't
get tired of looking at.

87
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,500
Second, someone fun.

88
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,110
Third,

89
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,820
someone you can talk to.

90
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,940
If they're easy on the eyes,
that means they're handsome.

91
00:05:16,973 --> 00:05:19,700
If you can talk to them, that means
they're emotionally intelligent.

92
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,380
My ex was great at talking,

93
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,084
but later I found out
he talked like that to every girl.

94
00:05:25,590 --> 00:05:27,230
Being fun is the hardest to define.

95
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,620
Who even counts as fun?

96
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:36,110
Mr. Yu's fun, isn't he?

97
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,500
What's wrong?

98
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,620
The movie was so good.

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:48,030
I want to watch it again and again.

100
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,173
I'm not returning this disc.

101
00:05:49,173 --> 00:05:50,230
They can keep the deposit.

102
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:51,580
- All right.
- Here.

103
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:53,350
Cheers!

104
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,060
(To those)

105
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:00,590
(who don't understand racing,)

106
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:03,030
(it's just cars going in circles).

107
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,060
(But the ones who get it,
know the charm of it.)

108
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:09,420
(It's the never-ending
pursuit of speed.)

109
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,430
(The thrill of acceleration,
flirting with danger.)

110
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:13,470
(It inflates your confidence.)

111
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:15,550
(It gives you the rush
of controlling roaring power)

112
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:17,790
(and complicated machinery.)

113
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:20,910
(It's a peak celebration
of technology and courage.)

114
00:07:08,484 --> 00:07:11,050
(Speed and passion)
Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,

115
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,470
the final's about to begin.

116
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,860
Who will take home the title?

117
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:16,860
Let's find out.

118
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,590
Starting positions in the final

119
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,910
are determined by the qualifying scores.

120
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,180
First on the grid is Bu Jingyun.

121
00:07:24,590 --> 00:07:26,910
His car looks ready
to blast off the starting line.

122
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,110
Second is Nie Feng,

123
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:31,820
driving the "Very Invincible."

124
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:35,110
Third is our lovely racer,

125
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,260
Zhang Liheng.

126
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:39,710
Fourth is Yu Yu.

127
00:07:40,250 --> 00:07:42,940
He and his
"Who Borrowed The Little Woman?"

128
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,180
are heading for the trophy.

129
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,230
Ready!

130
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:50,540
(4 Yu Yu)
Go!

131
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:56,150
Look at that!

132
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,860
Yu Yu nailed the start

133
00:07:57,860 --> 00:07:59,300
and jumped straight into third.

134
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,500
He tries an outside overtake.

135
00:08:01,990 --> 00:08:03,710
Nie Feng holds his line tight.

136
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,820
The finalists' lap times

137
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:08,180
(Yu Yu, Third Place)
are incredibly fast.

138
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,180
All three broke the ten-second mark,

139
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:12,590
hitting speeds
over 100 kilometers per hour.

140
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,030
Yu Yu slipped in the corner,

141
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:16,940
but he corrected his line right away.

142
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:18,350
Nie Feng tries to pass.

143
00:08:18,350 --> 00:08:20,740
His fight with Bu Jingyun is intense.

144
00:08:21,795 --> 00:08:23,540
(Bu Jingyun, Nie Feng,
Zhang Liheng, Yu Yu)

145
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,500
Every driver is locked in.

146
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:33,540
At these speeds,

147
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:34,470
one slip

148
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:35,990
and you're done.

149
00:08:36,350 --> 00:08:39,020
Yu Yu takes a braver line
into the corner.

150
00:08:39,710 --> 00:08:40,900
Astonishing!

151
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,950
Yu Yu uses two back-to-back curves

152
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,540
to jump straight into first.

153
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:47,140
He skims
the edge of the track to pass them.

154
00:08:49,728 --> 00:08:50,950
Bu Jingyun refuses to back down

155
00:08:50,951 --> 00:08:52,130
and tries to reclaim the lead,

156
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:54,380
but Yu Yu's line

157
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,740
is flawless.

158
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,990
This time, Nie Feng tries.

159
00:09:00,430 --> 00:09:03,140
He's glued
to "Who Borrowed The Little Woman?"

160
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,990
Yu Yu doesn't let him get through.

161
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:15,640
(Yu Yu, First Place)
Two corners left. Who'll take it?

162
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,990
Straightaway! Speed up! Go!

163
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:20,350
Yu Yu crosses the finish line first!

164
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:23,540
We have our champion!

165
00:09:29,773 --> 00:09:31,580
(Yu Yu, First Place)

166
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,140
Remote model car racing champion.

167
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:37,190
Yeah, I won. Impressive, right?

168
00:09:37,190 --> 00:09:38,070
You learned to drive?

169
00:09:38,660 --> 00:09:39,500
No.

170
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,340
This.

171
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,020
A toy car?

172
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,780
Wu.

173
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,620
Come here.

174
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:50,430
Allow me to introduce you.

175
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,140
Don't underestimate this thing.

176
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,190
Its top speed

177
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:55,860
hits more than 100 kilometers per hour.

178
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,950
I modified it in several places.

179
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,740
Lower drag,

180
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,990
better handling,

181
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:02,540
lighter body,

182
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:03,740
and its exhaust...

183
00:10:13,217 --> 00:10:15,790
Sharing something you love
with someone who doesn't appreciate it

184
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,260
really is a lonely kind of humiliation.

185
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,710
The client has new requests again.

186
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:24,020
She wants a welcome camera
at the entrance.

187
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,380
So when her husband gets home,

188
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:28,110
it'll make a beep

189
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:29,990
and she can greet him at the door.

190
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:32,900
Which country is this woman from?

191
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,430
Who still greets
their husband like that?

192
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,500
Sounds like its real use is to warn

193
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,470
her lover

194
00:10:39,470 --> 00:10:40,350
to hide.

195
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:43,020
Just do what she wants.

196
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:43,900
Yeah.

197
00:10:43,928 --> 00:10:46,500
Besides, having someone greet you
when you get home sounds nice.

198
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,817
Mr. Yu, when you come home from work

199
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,900
and step into a dark place,

200
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,260
don't you feel lonely?

201
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,380
Of course.

202
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:54,220
Yeah.

203
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,110
Why would I be?

204
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,310
I've got this one with me,

205
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:00,830
and this one,

206
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,500
and plenty more of these with me.

207
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:03,860
Shameless.

208
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:04,700
You're hopeless.

209
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:28,540
Good evening.

210
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:30,140
Buying dog food?

211
00:11:30,573 --> 00:11:31,740
Why not get it delivered?

212
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:33,590
Delivery fees are ridiculous.

213
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:35,950
The food itself is already expensive.

214
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:37,740
I'm practically broke.

215
00:11:38,795 --> 00:11:40,110
You might as well have a baby.

216
00:11:40,373 --> 00:11:42,617
At least kids can pay you back
when they grow up.

217
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,710
Meanwhile,

218
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:45,573
your dog will only spend your money.

219
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,710
My dog's my family.

220
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:51,950
It's the way Dao waits at home

221
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,990
for me to come back...

222
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:59,550
Mr. Yu, you wouldn't understand.

223
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:02,830
Waiting for their owner to return

224
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,900
and feed them
is a basic mammal instinct, you know?

225
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:08,230
Good night.

226
00:12:30,195 --> 00:12:31,710
Why's the elevator broken again?

227
00:12:31,795 --> 00:12:33,140
I'm definitely filing a complaint.

228
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:36,830
Good thing you're here, Mr. Yu. Thanks.

229
00:12:37,310 --> 00:12:38,660
I should've minded my own business.

230
00:12:39,830 --> 00:12:41,740
What's inside this thing?

231
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:43,350
Don't shake it.

232
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,310
This is much better than your dog.

233
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:47,070
Doesn't need food, won't pee everywhere,

234
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,500
and it runs fast.

235
00:12:49,830 --> 00:12:51,110
I can't guess.

236
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,140
What is it?

237
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
I'll bet you can't.

238
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:55,790
Bye.

239
00:12:56,190 --> 00:12:57,470
It's only two more steps.

240
00:12:57,470 --> 00:12:58,710
You should see it through.

241
00:13:03,430 --> 00:13:04,310
Please open the door.

242
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,990
Dao!

243
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,500
Missed me?

244
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,340
Come here.

245
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:19,660
I bought you lots of treats.

246
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,660
Hey, quiet down!

247
00:13:42,990 --> 00:13:43,830
Mr. Yu,

248
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:45,540
when you get home...

249
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,380
And hear that little beep.

250
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,190
Isn't it nice to have
someone waiting for you?

251
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,900
(My... my stomach...)

252
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:54,990
(Why does it suddenly hurt this much?)

253
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:57,830
(It hurts so much I can't speak.)

254
00:13:58,310 --> 00:13:59,150
(I'm dying.)

255
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,900
(Mr. Yu, help me!)

256
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,190
It hurts!

257
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:11,190
What... what are you doing?

258
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:14,928
What's wrong with you?

259
00:14:17,110 --> 00:14:17,950
It hurts...

260
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:19,620
Did you eat dog food?

261
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,500
You've got appendicitis.

262
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,620
It's not that serious though.

263
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:25,900
A minimally invasive surgery,

264
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,310
and you should be able
to eat normally in a day or two.

265
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:31,590
What about my hand?

266
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,830
Well, I looked at your report.

267
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:37,151
It's probably a minor fracture.

268
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,350
But I'll have
an orthopedic doctor take a look.

269
00:14:41,860 --> 00:14:42,700
Okay.

270
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,110
Mr. Yu is brutal.

271
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:48,740
From what I can remember,

272
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,780
he crushed it twice with his heel

273
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,260
like he was putting out a cigarette.

274
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,500
He's unbelievable.

275
00:14:58,710 --> 00:15:00,740
It's Qing. I'll put her on speaker.

276
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,340
Hello?

277
00:15:02,490 --> 00:15:03,350
Xiaoman.

278
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:05,190
Are you feeling any better?

279
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:07,050
I'll take leave this afternoon
and visit you.

280
00:15:07,470 --> 00:15:08,310
I'm fine.

281
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,150
Um,

282
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:11,070
can you check on Dao for me?

283
00:15:11,070 --> 00:15:12,230
I'm really worried about it.

284
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:14,020
Sure, I can do that.

285
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:18,590
And I might need to stay
in the hospital for a week.

286
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:21,540
Can you take care of it for a few days?

287
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,780
That's not possible.

288
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:25,540
My landlord won't allow it.

289
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:28,310
And my roommate, you know her.

290
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:29,751
She definitely won't allow it.

291
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:31,310
Okay, I'll think of something.

292
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,900
Get some rest.

293
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,380
Why're you staring at me?

294
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,070
I work night shifts every day.

295
00:15:42,070 --> 00:15:43,595
I don't have time to look after Dao.

296
00:15:45,070 --> 00:15:46,020
I know.

297
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,590
Being a doctor is tough.

298
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:51,710
Xiaoman, how are you?

299
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,140
I heard Mr. Yu crushed your hand.

300
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,470
Don't exaggerate.

301
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,110
It's not crushed, just fractured.

302
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,430
It must hurt a lot.

303
00:16:00,995 --> 00:16:03,470
Mr. Yu made ribs for you
so you can get more calcium.

304
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,350
I'm having surgery.

305
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,860
I can't eat anything.

306
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:07,910
So what now?

307
00:16:09,310 --> 00:16:10,470
Have you eaten, Dr. Gu?

308
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:11,710
No.

309
00:16:11,710 --> 00:16:13,140
Then why don't we eat it?

310
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,484
Seems a waste to throw it away.

311
00:16:16,590 --> 00:16:18,860
Xiaoman, remember to appreciate
Mr. Yu's kindness.

312
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:27,110
People these days

313
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,430
can be so cold.

314
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,220
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

315
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:39,980
Mr. Yu.

316
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,380
What's this?

317
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:47,860
A dog.

318
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:48,780
No kidding.

319
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:49,990
I even know its name is Dao.

320
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,110
Xia Xiaoman's in the hospital.

321
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,640
She asked me to look after it
for a few days.

322
00:16:53,662 --> 00:16:54,620
We don't need dogs here.

323
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,900
I'm giving you half a day off.
Take it home.

324
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:58,310
Seriously, Mr. Yu?

325
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,380
What if he makes a mess?

326
00:17:00,710 --> 00:17:02,740
And it whines all the time.

327
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,630
It's not noisy. It's adorable.

328
00:17:06,910 --> 00:17:07,750
Adorable?

329
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:09,910
Such a weird-looking animal.

330
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:11,990
Left paw.

331
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:13,620
Right paw.

332
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,150
Good boy.

333
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,020
Here you go.

334
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,100
Open wide.

335
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,230
Xia Xiaoman trusts you a lot.

336
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,106
This dog is like her kid.

337
00:17:30,128 --> 00:17:32,020
She trusts you enough
to put it in your care.

338
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:34,528
And you didn't even ask
if I'd be okay with it.

339
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,060
Do you like it that much?

340
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:47,470
Who, the dog or Xia Xiaoman?

341
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,820
Aren't you two best friends already?

342
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,820
Which is why

343
00:17:52,820 --> 00:17:54,190
she should've asked me.

344
00:17:54,190 --> 00:17:55,260
Why'd she ask you?

345
00:17:55,260 --> 00:17:57,500
I happened to visit her in the hospital.

346
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,910
You went to the hospital?

347
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,390
Even Qing and I haven't gone yet.

348
00:18:00,390 --> 00:18:01,580
You were the first.

349
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:03,710
Mr. Yu told me to go.

350
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:04,950
Mr. Yu.

351
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:07,150
It's always Mr. Yu.

352
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,500
What is it this time?

353
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:10,390
Nothing.

354
00:18:22,630 --> 00:18:23,470
So...

355
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Can I keep it?

356
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:28,180
Sure.

357
00:18:37,340 --> 00:18:38,180
Good evening.

358
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,180
What's the dog doing here?

359
00:18:40,995 --> 00:18:43,020
Thanks to it,
Xiaoxiao isn't smiling anymore.

360
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:47,190
She made you choose

361
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:48,270
between her and the dog,

362
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:49,910
and you chose the woman.

363
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,580
I chose peace.

364
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:54,430
Mr. Yu, I'm begging you.

365
00:18:54,430 --> 00:18:55,340
Take it for two days.

366
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:56,180
Heh.

367
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,340
- You...
- Let go.

368
00:18:58,340 --> 00:18:59,180
Please.

369
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,150
Just a few days, Mr. Yu.

370
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:01,340
No. Let go.

371
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm not letting go.

372
00:19:03,330 --> 00:19:04,190
Let go!

373
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:05,030
Hey.

374
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,390
Just help him for two days.

375
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:08,260
Why're you here?

376
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,390
I'm here to get Xiaoman
a change of clothes.

377
00:19:11,684 --> 00:19:12,870
Xiaoxiao, you're here too.

378
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:13,710
Xiaoxiao!

379
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:20,230
You can take the dog to a pet hospital.

380
00:19:20,230 --> 00:19:22,430
Where are we supposed
to find one this late?

381
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,500
Can't you just look after it
for a few days?

382
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:27,430
Not even a second.

383
00:19:28,780 --> 00:19:29,740
Fine.

384
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,706
Then don't come to me
for medical help anymore.

385
00:19:31,728 --> 00:19:33,060
Then I'll go to the pet hospital.

386
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,580
Wu, ignore him.

387
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:36,940
We're leaving.

388
00:19:37,170 --> 00:19:38,617
Go to the pet hospital all you want.

389
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:53,660
Dr. Gu,

390
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:55,820
got any ideas?

391
00:19:57,540 --> 00:19:58,540
Humans are one thing,

392
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,100
but I'm trying to figure out
why this guy won't even

393
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:03,950
let a dog into his place.

394
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:07,580
Dr. Gu, stop complaining about Mr. Yu.

395
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:09,260
He's not the point right now.

396
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:11,150
The problem is the dog.

397
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:13,420
Yeah.

398
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,740
What about the dog?

399
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,710
What about me?

400
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:24,670
Who's flashing that light?

401
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:27,710
Mr. Yu.

402
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,580
Why're you here?

403
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:33,020
Five days, and five days only.

404
00:20:35,990 --> 00:20:38,060
So you do have a heart.

405
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:39,990
Mr. Yu,

406
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:42,100
you're not worried Dr. Gu
will ignore you, are you?

407
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,190
Of course not.

408
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:45,740
This is compassion.

409
00:20:45,795 --> 00:20:47,220
I'm showing compassion for you guys.

410
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,260
Whatever you say.
Thanks for saving my life.

411
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:50,950
- Come on, Dao.
- Go on.

412
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:51,790
Come on. Down.

413
00:20:59,390 --> 00:21:00,740
Inside here is its dog food

414
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,580
and its toys.

415
00:21:12,817 --> 00:21:14,470
Do you know how to take care of a dog?

416
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,470
You must be hungry.

417
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:44,980
(How much should a pug eat each meal?)

418
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,620
(Young puppies eat
around 50-70 grams a day.)

419
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,884
(Older puppies and adult pugs
need about 80 grams a day.)

420
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:55,910
I'll get you some food.

421
00:22:34,580 --> 00:22:36,470
A good meal starts with the right bowl.

422
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:42,030
Go on, eat.

423
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:44,750
Eat.

424
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:49,870
I know you're annoyed
that I tied you up,

425
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,190
but I have to.

426
00:22:51,217 --> 00:22:53,470
There are lots of things in my place
you can't touch.

427
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,390
Like my speakers,

428
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,780
my records, and my models.

429
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:57,100
None of them is for you, got it?

430
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:01,230
Suit yourself.

431
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,500
A hunger strike isn't going to work.

432
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:58,820
Eat or don't.

433
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:01,710
Look at me. I'm enjoying my dinner.

434
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,100
If you keep refusing,
I'll throw away your food.

435
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:21,230
If you keep refusing,
I'll throw you out too.

436
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:22,230
You hear me?

437
00:24:57,390 --> 00:24:58,990
We'll get you to the operating room now.

438
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:02,580
Xiaoman.

439
00:25:03,990 --> 00:25:05,340
Dr. Gu, why're you here?

440
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:06,580
I was worried you'd be nervous.

441
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:07,820
I am a bit.

442
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,100
Can I make a call first?

443
00:25:10,990 --> 00:25:12,500
Sure. Who're you calling?

444
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,260
Shen Wu. I'm worried about Dao.

445
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:17,870
Then maybe don't call.

446
00:25:18,630 --> 00:25:19,470
Why?

447
00:25:20,060 --> 00:25:22,190
Dao's with Mr. Yu.

448
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:24,100
What? Why with him?

449
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,100
Don't worry.

450
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:26,580
Mr. Yu will take good care of Dao.

451
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,990
No. I'm not doing the surgery.

452
00:25:27,990 --> 00:25:29,284
Take her to the operating room.

453
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,740
Dr. Gu, I need to save Dao!

454
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:33,230
I need to save Dao!

455
00:25:33,710 --> 00:25:36,020
Just accept your fate. Be good.

456
00:25:38,990 --> 00:25:39,990
The client is here.

457
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:43,300
Please come in, Mr. Li.

458
00:25:43,328 --> 00:25:44,773
- Hello.
- Please have a seat.

459
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:49,660
Hello.

460
00:25:51,910 --> 00:25:54,580
Mr. Li,
should we pick up from the budget?

461
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:58,910
I've thought
about increasing the budget.

462
00:25:58,910 --> 00:25:59,750
Don't.

463
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:08,190
Please carry on.

464
00:26:08,870 --> 00:26:10,060
I want to add another 50,000.

465
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:11,230
No.

466
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,430
Maybe

467
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,580
eighty thousand?

468
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,710
Dao, come out!

469
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,100
Dao!

470
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,100
Hello?

471
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:56,780
Mr. Yu, how is Dao?

472
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,580
Your Dao has no manners at all.

473
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:02,670
Can you turn on the video
so I can see it?

474
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,900
No.

475
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,100
Why?

476
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,540
Because I ate it.

477
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,630
What are you doing?

478
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,150
Why are you scaring Xiaoman?

479
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:17,990
Don't worry.

480
00:27:17,990 --> 00:27:19,820
Mr. Yu won't eat Dao.

481
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:23,190
But what if he does?
He's so greedy and loves meat.

482
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:26,230
Why is this person so annoying?

483
00:27:34,195 --> 00:27:35,430
You really have no problem?

484
00:27:36,951 --> 00:27:38,870
Since you're so rarely asking me
for help,

485
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,060
of course I won't refuse.

486
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:42,710
Besides, it affects whether you
can work with peace of mind.

487
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:43,550
Right?

488
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,260
Okay then, I'll leave it to you.

489
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:47,100
Don't worry.

490
00:27:48,100 --> 00:27:49,390
Dao.

491
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,230
Good boy.

492
00:27:51,230 --> 00:27:52,580
Cute Dao.

493
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,840
This dog's name is Dao,
and I'm the one called Dao, okay?

494
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:58,100
Of course, I know that.

495
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,300
Right, Dao?

496
00:28:02,151 --> 00:28:04,260
Didn't you just say
that your allergy to dog hair

497
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,100
had been cured?

498
00:28:05,540 --> 00:28:07,470
I'm allergic to pollen.

499
00:28:07,470 --> 00:28:08,780
Where are the flowers this season?

500
00:28:12,940 --> 00:28:13,780
Never mind.

501
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:15,150
Give it to me, hurry.

502
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:16,150
Forget it.

503
00:28:16,151 --> 00:28:17,300
- Give it to me.
- Let go.

504
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,190
I can really do it.

505
00:28:18,190 --> 00:28:19,030
Go.

506
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:20,830
Dao.

507
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,630
Dao, go home with me.

508
00:28:22,630 --> 00:28:23,910
I will take care of you.

509
00:28:34,540 --> 00:28:35,780
Is Dao cute?

510
00:28:36,260 --> 00:28:37,150
Cute.

511
00:28:37,684 --> 00:28:39,740
Then I'll bring it over to play
with you for a few days, okay?

512
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:41,300
Okay, I want to play with Dao.

513
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,190
Okay.

514
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,670
Eh, no.

515
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,300
I'm allergic to dog fur.

516
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,150
I'll sneeze and get rashes.

517
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:50,190
No, I want to play with Dao.

518
00:28:50,190 --> 00:28:51,390
Yeah, she wants to play.

519
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:53,300
You'll get used to it. Don't worry.

520
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:56,340
What do you mean she'll get used to it?

521
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,150
Allergies are allergies.

522
00:28:59,084 --> 00:29:00,484
People these days are unbelievable.

523
00:29:00,484 --> 00:29:02,100
Don't get married when they should,

524
00:29:02,100 --> 00:29:03,020
and just raise a dog.

525
00:29:03,551 --> 00:29:04,740
We're not learning from her.

526
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,300
Never wanted to.

527
00:29:08,973 --> 00:29:11,060
Mom, look, the dog is making trouble
in my home.

528
00:29:11,128 --> 00:29:12,630
How am I supposed to live here?

529
00:29:12,950 --> 00:29:13,820
Impossible to live.

530
00:29:14,540 --> 00:29:16,990
If not, let me take care of it
for a few days.

531
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,430
Fine, have you ever raised a dog?

532
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,630
I raised you.

533
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:24,910
Then it's settled.

534
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,195
Come with me later to pick it up.

535
00:29:26,580 --> 00:29:27,990
What do you mean settled?

536
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,430
I have conditions.

537
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:30,470
What conditions?

538
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,060
Treat Yejia to a meal.

539
00:29:33,190 --> 00:29:34,710
Then you plan to spy on us, right?

540
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:37,430
Wrong, I'm going to watch openly.

541
00:29:39,728 --> 00:29:41,100
All three of us will eat together.

542
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,710
Forget it.

543
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:47,260
Grandma, I want to raise Dao.

544
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:50,020
Your mom is allergic.

545
00:29:50,910 --> 00:29:53,470
If we keep it,
your mom's body will get itchy.

546
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:56,670
Do you want your mom to be itchy?

547
00:29:57,580 --> 00:29:58,580
Yes.

548
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:01,740
Yu, Mom.

549
00:30:01,740 --> 00:30:02,580
Where are you going?

550
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,710
We're heading back.

551
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:05,820
You're going home?

552
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:07,580
- Leaving.
- We're leaving.

553
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:08,710
Okay, Mom.

554
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:11,710
Mom, aren't you staying a few more days?

555
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:14,580
See? See how popular I am?

556
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:16,820
I'll go home and get some more clothes.

557
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,100
Then come stay for more days.

558
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,380
We're leaving.

559
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:21,710
She'll stay for more days.

560
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,390
Really. I am getting old.

561
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:33,820
It's raining today.

562
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:36,340
How did I remember it as tomorrow?

563
00:30:36,862 --> 00:30:38,740
All because you insisted
on taking the subway.

564
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,740
Why not take a taxi?

565
00:30:40,706 --> 00:30:42,500
Mom, the dog is acting up at home again.

566
00:30:43,260 --> 00:30:44,820
Be a bit frugal.

567
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,340
Alright, I'll listen to you.

568
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,910
You insisted on keeping it.

569
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:22,710
What are you doing?

570
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:24,060
Why are you here?

571
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,430
I'm getting pants for Xiaoman.

572
00:31:26,430 --> 00:31:27,740
I don't have her pants here.

573
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,260
Might as well bring some food.

574
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,230
I'm not eating.

575
00:31:31,230 --> 00:31:32,340
It's for the dog.

576
00:31:36,630 --> 00:31:37,740
Let's discuss this.

577
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:40,340
Otherwise, I'll just take Dao away.

578
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:42,910
I think with my hospital colleagues,

579
00:31:42,910 --> 00:31:45,340
we can manage it in shifts
for a few days.

580
00:31:45,340 --> 00:31:46,340
Not now.

581
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:48,100
Or let me check on it.

582
00:31:48,100 --> 00:31:49,150
I'll take some photos.

583
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,230
I'll send videos to Xiaoman.

584
00:31:51,230 --> 00:31:52,230
Don't try to go in.

585
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,260
Then let it out.

586
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,190
It can't come out.

587
00:31:55,190 --> 00:31:56,150
Why?

588
00:31:56,150 --> 00:31:58,150
Because I'm performing
a dissection on it.

589
00:31:59,150 --> 00:31:59,990
I...

590
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:02,670
Let me in. Open the door.

591
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:16,340
Hey, honey.

592
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:18,340
I'm walking Mimi.

593
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:20,500
She's doing well. Very obedient.

594
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:23,710
She really likes playing
with other puppies.

595
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:24,550
Are you scared of it?

596
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,580
Don't be. Bite it.

597
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:28,060
- Bite it, go.
- Alright.

598
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:29,710
So timid.

599
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,740
It's fine.

600
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:31,740
I've run into a lunatic.

601
00:32:33,740 --> 00:32:34,910
It ran!

602
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,260
Mimi!

603
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:39,260

What are you doing?

640
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:51,460
Dao.

641
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:52,860
You...

642
00:35:53,390 --> 00:35:54,230
Go away.

643
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:56,100
What's wrong with you?

644
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,660
Didn't I tell you not to touch my stuff?

645
00:35:58,430 --> 00:35:59,270
Go downstairs.

646
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:04,950
Hey, where do you live?

647
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,110
Here.

648
00:36:19,950 --> 00:36:21,990
Why did you suddenly send Dao to me?

649
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,500
It broke my trophy,

650
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,100
and also ruined my RC car.

651
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,500
It's a dog.

652
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:28,270
How can you argue with a dog?

653
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,390
I know it's a dog.

654
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:30,790
But I'm also a victim.

655
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,270
Both dogs and humans make mistakes.

656
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,580
You have to learn to forgive.

657
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,910
Do you know? I won that trophy

658
00:36:34,910 --> 00:36:36,620
by beating 23 opponents.

659
00:36:36,620 --> 00:36:38,319
All the screws on my car
are titanium alloy,

660
00:36:38,320 --> 00:36:39,430
and tested in a wind tunnel.

661
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,470
Are you going to stand there

662
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,910
and say everything you want to say?

663
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:51,870
You want me to go in?

664
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:53,100
Of course.

665
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,950
Do you think I'm as rude as you?

666
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:03,060
Forget it. Goodbye.

667
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,180
Hey, what's wrong?

668
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:17,990
Feed 80 grams of dog food.

669
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:19,180
Got it.

670
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:20,830
Use clean water when washing its paws.

671
00:37:20,830 --> 00:37:22,220
Steak medium rare.

672
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,540
No black pepper sauce.

673
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:24,540
That's for peasants.

674
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:31,220
Anything else to say?

675
00:37:32,706 --> 00:37:33,790
It's afraid of big dogs.

676
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,060
(Gu Yejia)

677
00:37:57,870 --> 00:37:58,710
Hey.

678
00:37:58,950 --> 00:37:59,790
Mr. Yu.

679
00:37:59,884 --> 00:38:01,790
Dao is digging in the trash.
What should I do?

680
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,630
Bear with it.

681
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:05,020
Isn't there another way?

682
00:38:05,430 --> 00:38:07,910
Humans and dogs both make mistakes.

683
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:09,862
- Alright.
- You have to learn to be tolerant.

684
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:13,270
Okay.

685
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,950
Better to send it away after all.

686
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:35,580
Ou Yang posted another video.

687
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,195
What is he showing off this time?

688
00:38:39,470 --> 00:38:40,310
Look.

689
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,950
(It's nice to have someone
welcome you home.)

690
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:45,750
Plus fine wine and beautiful women?

691
00:38:48,220 --> 00:38:49,430
Who would welcome him?

692
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:50,790
He has three beautiful women.

693
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:54,060
Dating without the intention
of marriage is just messing around.

694
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:57,950
I actually hope someone
welcomes me home.

695
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:01,270
Xiaoxiao gets off work later than me,
yet I'm the one welcoming her.

696
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,910
I need to learn from you.

697
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,620
That mindset of opening the door
to an empty home without caring.

698
00:39:10,430 --> 00:39:11,270
Get lost.

699
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,470
Alright.

700
00:40:23,500 --> 00:40:24,430
Mr. Yu.

701
00:40:25,180 --> 00:40:26,180
You're here too.

702
00:40:28,060 --> 00:40:28,900
Sit.

703
00:40:29,350 --> 00:40:30,190
Same as usual?

704
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:31,270
Yes.

705
00:40:33,750 --> 00:40:34,950
I heard you recently got a dog.

706
00:40:35,310 --> 00:40:37,790
I especially bought a dog collar
for you in Paris.

707
00:40:38,140 --> 00:40:39,020
Do you like it?

708
00:40:39,350 --> 00:40:40,830
I really like this brand.

709
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:43,220
Very thoughtful, thank you.

710
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,310
You must treat your dog well.

711
00:40:45,540 --> 00:40:48,430
Because dogs are humanity's
best friends.

712
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,580
You're right.

713
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,580
Mr. Yu, do you have a dog?

714
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:54,940
No.

715
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,580
Dao, slow down.

716
00:41:02,870 --> 00:41:05,100
Dao, slow down. I can't keep up.

717
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,910
Dao.

718
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,620
Dao!

719
00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:13,790
Dao, slow down.

720
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:14,990
Dao, wait.

721
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:16,350
I need water, Dao.

722
00:41:17,060 --> 00:41:18,910
Come, I'm dying of thirst.

723
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:20,220
Dao, don't move.

724
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:21,540
Wait for me. I'll be right there.

725
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:28,110
Hey.

726
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:29,750
Have you eaten?

727
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,060
Yes.

728
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:33,020
I mean the dog.

729
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,660
The dog ate too.

730
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,180
How much dog food?

731
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:37,990
A big handful, I guess.

732
00:41:37,990 --> 00:41:39,462
You're walking the dog now, right?

733
00:41:39,462 --> 00:41:40,230
Yes.

734
00:41:40,390 --> 00:41:41,660
Here's some advice.

735
00:41:41,830 --> 00:41:43,100
Don't let it lead you.

736
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,100
You need to be in control, understand?

737
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:47,100
It doesn't listen to me.

738
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:48,870
Negotiate with it.

739
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:50,350
Negotiate with a dog?

740
00:41:50,580 --> 00:41:51,470
It's Dao.

741
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:53,870
Alright, I'll negotiate with it.

742
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:54,940
Dao...

743
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:56,590
Dao.

744
00:41:57,100 --> 00:41:58,220
Dao is gone.

745
00:41:58,220 --> 00:41:59,700
What? You...

746
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,540
Did you tie it nearby just now?

747
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,430
Yes.

748
00:42:02,870 --> 00:42:04,140
It can pull itself free.

749
00:42:05,084 --> 00:42:06,990
I'm done talking to you.
I went looking for Dao.

750
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
Dao.

751
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,140
- Hey.
- Dao.

752
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:11,220
So dumb.

753
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:15,220
Dao.

754
00:42:19,390 --> 00:42:20,390
Let's go, Sir.

755
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:23,790
Dao.

756
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:25,540
Dao.

757
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:28,180
Sir, please hurry.

758
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,340
Okay.

759
00:42:30,430 --> 00:42:32,790
Dao!

760
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:36,430
Dao!

761
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,430
Dao.

762
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:43,430
Mr. Yu.

763
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,020
Where's Dao?

764
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,310
Is that Dao over there?

765
00:42:48,910 --> 00:42:49,750
What?

766
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
