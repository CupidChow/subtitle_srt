Ever since Mr. Yu won that award,

31

his orders and project requests
have been pouring in like snowflakes.

32
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:10,560
Looks like I made the right decision
not to go to Beijing.

33
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,119
Throw me some work, Ms. Lin.

34
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:16,719
Why don't you go back
to assisting Mr. Yu?

35
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,880
No way. I'd be mortified.

36
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,840
You.

37
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,040
I remember you today.

38
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:28,439
What? Did you forget me yesterday?

39
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,759
You didn't like my post on Moments.

40
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,879
Because I blocked you.

41
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,999
I rarely post everything.
Why would you block me?

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,920
I finally made a post,
and none of you gave me a like.

43
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:37,080
Exactly because you don't post,
that's why I blocked you.

44
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,920
If I don't post,
what's the point of blocking me?

45
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,200
Wait. Can you two take this conversation
back to your desks?

46
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,320
Why are you having it here? Ridiculous.

47
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:44,439
- Oh, right.
- What?

48
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,039
You haven't settled
this month's utilities.

49
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,879
If you don't pay me,

50
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,040
I'll make another post to call you out.

51
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,400
Xia Xiaoman's going to Beijing
for her internship.

52
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,200
She's having a party this weekend
and told me to ask if you want to come.

53
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,719
I'm not going.

54
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,280
Okay.

55
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,600
Wait.

56
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,760
I was talking about the utilities.
Why are you suddenly talking about her?

57
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:06,399
Right!

58
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,040
I'll send you the address later.

59
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,560
Who were you calling ridiculous just now?

60
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,080
I'm the boss here.
I sit wherever I want.

61
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,439
Xia Xiaoman is really unbelievable.

62
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,760
So clueless.

63
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:22,800
Seriously.

64
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:30,559
I'm really going to miss you.

65
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,160
- I'll miss you too!
- I'll miss you too!

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,559
That's enough.

67
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,200
It's not like Xiaoman isn't coming back.

68
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,920
Didn't you hear her?

69
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,439
If the training goes well,

70
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,200
she might get posted to another city
as a store manager.

71
00:03:45,320 --> 00:03:49,040
Then let me wish her an average performance
in the training, just enough to make the cut.

72
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:51,119
Don't jinx me.

73
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,679
I'm ambitious.

74
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,080
Exactly.

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,880
Where's Qing?

76
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,879
She's meeting a big client today.

77
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:03,320
Not sure if she can make it.

78
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Mr. Yu?

79
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,200
I thought you weren't coming.

80
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,560
Are you leaving for Beijing?

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,560
I didn't know what to give you.

82
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,400
According to Tianjin custom,

83
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,400
dumplings are to welcome,
and noodles are to send someone off.

84
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
I made you a bowl of noodles.

85
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:27,479
Mr. Yu, you personally serving it?
What about me and Xiaoxiao?

86
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,000
Go get them from the kitchen yourself.

87
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:31,520
Let's go.

88
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:37,120
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

89
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
Is it good?

90
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:54,840
Yes.

91
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,720
Xiaoman.

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,360
I heard you're leaving for Beijing.

93
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,520
Such a pity.

94
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,480
Our city is losing a beautiful sight.

95
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,920
I don't have anything fancy to give you.

96
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,640
This.

97
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,680
I bought it back from East Asia.

98
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:22,560
It's been with me for years.

99
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,479
Open it.

100
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,640
There's a surprise.

101
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,039
Noodles without garlic

102
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,360
lose half the flavor.

103
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,280
Thank you.

104
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:38,160
You eat garlic?

105
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,360
Aren't you afraid of bad breath?
The smell will get to Dao.

106
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,560
Shut it.

107
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,279
Xiaoman's leaving.

108
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,800
She can eat whatever she wants.

109
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:46,040
Say something nice.

110
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:48,480
Adjust your tone, okay?

111
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:58,760
Well.

112
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,119
Once you get to Beijing,

113
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,440
if you're too busy

114
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,480
to look after Dao,

115
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,799
you can hand him to me anytime.

116
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,960
I'll take care of him.

117
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,359
I know you care about him.

118
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,880
You've said that many times.

119
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,440
Don't you

120
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:21,680
have anything else to say to me?

121
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,840
No.

122
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,680
That's it?

123
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:33,200
Hmm.

124
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,599
I'm starving.

125
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,620
I'm getting a bowl too. Take your time.

126
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:03,039
Hello, Qing?

127
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,240
You really can't come?

128
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:07,799
Yeah. Huge client.

129
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:09,600
I'll treat you another day.

130
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:12,000
Let me tell you something.

131
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:13,480
What's it?

132
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm going to

133
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:18,440
confess to Mr. Yu again.

134
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,609
Why?

135
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,320
Why are you confessing again?

136
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,680
I met him just now.

137
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,560
He acted like nothing ever happened.

138
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,240
Also, the more I think about it,

139
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,360
it really was a mess
when I confessed to him that day.

140
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,800
Maybe there was a misunderstanding
between us.

141
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,879
Even if he doesn't like me,

142
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,120
I want to hear him say it.

143
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:43,559
Girl, Dr. Gu went to
the award ceremony with him.

144
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,999
They hugged!

145
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,919
Do you have to learn the hard way?

146
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,080
Hmm.

147
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,560
Mr. Yu,

148
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,000
there's something I want to tell you.

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,960
Oh.

150
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,160
What's it?

151
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,359
Hello.

152
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,879
Sorry, I'm late.

153
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:30,800
- Oh.
- Xiaoman, this is for you.

154
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:32,200
Thank you.

155
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,840
So much food.

156
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,960
Mr. Yu made all of this.

157
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,680
Wow, that's amazing.

158
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,079
Xiaoman, when you get to Beijing,

159
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,560
remember to text me.

160
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:47,200
If I get a break, I'll go visit you.

161
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,640
Definitely.

162
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:50,760
You're late.

163
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,519
I told Xiaoman

164
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:55,440
I got held up at the hospital,
so I'd be a bit late.

165
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,759
Being late is a modern-day condition.

166
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:59,400
You should study it.

167
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,999
That falls under psychology.

168
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,879
Not my field.

169
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,999
I'm suggesting a research topic to you.

170
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,759
Then I'd like to study

171
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:09,719
someone's baseless self-importance.

172
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:11,280
Commonly known as being thick-skinned.

173
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,979
You're the thick-skinned one.
Look at your subcutaneous fat.

174
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,599
Medical studies show subcutaneous fat
has nothing to do with the epidermis.

175
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:18,560
So you're admitting you got chubbier?

176
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,719
- How is my weight any of your business?
- It annoys me to look at.

177
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:21,719
Then look away.

178
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,890
- Don't come to me for treatment.
- You can quit your job.

179
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,920
Then I won't come.

180
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:37,800
Ah!

181
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:43,360
Xiaoman.

182
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,360
Where is she going?

183
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
No idea.

184
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
I'll check on her.

185
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:51,680
- Hi, Jia.
- Hello.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,640
Where are they going?

187
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
Don't know.

188
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:06,000
Xiaoman.

189
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:09,560
Xiaoman.

190
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,800
Xiaoman, what's wrong?

191
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,440
Open the door, Xiaoman.

192
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,920
Talk to me, Xiaoman.

193
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,269
Xiaoman.

194
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,119
Open up, Xiaoman.

195
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,680
I like Mr. Yu.

196
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,520
But he...

197
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,200
He likes you.

198
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,680
So,

199
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,640
do you like him?

200
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,800
I'm leaving.

201
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:27,920
I came to say goodbye.

202
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,680
Dao,

203
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,200
say bye-bye to Mr. Yu.

204
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,480
It's dry up north.
Make sure he drinks a lot of water.

205
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,480
Okay.

206
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,130
Well,

207
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:48,850
I'm going.

208
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,320
See you, Mr. Yu.

209
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,160
See you.

210
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,400
Hold on.

211
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:43,400
It's for Dao.

212
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,560
Thank you.

213
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,160
He'll love it.

214
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,640
Well.

215
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,280
We're leaving now.

216
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,920
Bye-bye.

217
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,560
We'll miss you.

218
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,360
Xia Xiaoman.

219
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:41,280
Ah?

220
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:42,680
He loves you.

I'm definitely filing a complaint.

if you're too busy to look after Dao,

Mr. Yu.

240

I'm a huge fan.

241
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,920
Designer of the Year.

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,599
Can I get a photo with you?

243
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,760
What?

244
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,999
I'm going to print it out
and hang it at home.

245
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,320
It'll surely grace my humble home.

246
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,320
Best New Designer.

247
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,640
You're great too.

248
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,800
Mr. Yu,

249
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,920
my real name

250
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,680
is Ouyang Pingfan.
[*Pingfan means "ordinary"]

251
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,680
But I don't feel ordinary,

252
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,920
so I tell people my name is Ou Yang.

253
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,999
But compared to you in design,

254
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,440
I'm ordinary.

255
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:35,639
Before this,

256
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,200
I never understood
how you managed to do it.

257
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,560
Until that award ceremony,

258
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,719
when I saw you and your wife.

259
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,040
You were sharing happiness with us.

260
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:46,479
She isn't my...

261
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:49,720
All your cooking zones
are designed for two people.

262
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,160
From the kitchen layout

263
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,479
to the size of the counter,

264
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,800
everything is made

265
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:59,560
for two people to use together.

266
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,640
That infuriating sweetness.

267
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,000
I'm jealous of that happiness.

268
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,680
Especially during dinner,

269
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:10,760
when you share every little thing
from your day.

270
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:14,120
From daisies in the morning sun,

271
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:17,360
to random frustrations at noon.

272
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,920
From office battles

273
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:24,280
to the rain at the bus stop.

274
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,639
After a whole day of work,

275
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,960
coming home,

276
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,920
hugging that person
and saying, "I'm home."

277
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,680
That's wonderful, isn't it?

278
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,160
Actually,

279
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,920
I wanted to confess to Mr. Yu just now.

280
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,280
But

281
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,879
when I saw you two bickering

282
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,080
like some old married couple,

283
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,200
I... I...

284
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,079
That vibe and chemistry,

285
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,680
I felt jealous.

286
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:31,000
And honestly,

287
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,920
I was awkward.

288
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,880
I didn't know
how to look at you two anymore.

289
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:40,440
That's why I walked away.

290
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:49,600
But the thing that embarrassed me the most

291
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:52,360
was how honest you two are.

292
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:55,440
The way Mr. Yu looks at you is honest.

293
00:18:55,670 --> 00:18:57,439
You admit you like him.

294
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,920
You're honest too.

295
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,360
I'm an honest person too.

296
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
So,

297
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,960
Jia, I need to tell you,

298
00:19:09,160 --> 00:19:10,760
I like Mr. Yu.

299
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:17,960
But

300
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:23,600
I can't like someone
who has someone in his heart.

301
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,200
You know,

302
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,120
before you arrived,

303
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,880
the way he looked at me

304
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,760
was like friends saying goodbye.

305
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,000
But once you showed up,

306
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:42,440
he lit right up.

307
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,359
You changed too.

308
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,840
You both did.

309
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,400
That was when I finally realized

310
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,880
the two of you are the ones

311
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,840
who really have
something real between you.

312
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:19,638
(Mr. Yu, are you free for BBQ tomorrow?)

313
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,720
(Mr. Yu, are you free for BBQ tomorrow?)

314
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:48,440
What do you want to order?

315
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:53,200
Shiitake, Chinese cabbage,

316
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,080
tomato, and enoki.

317
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,000
All veggies?

318
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,320
I've got the three highs.

319
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:00,760
Better cut down on meat.

320
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,760
It's fine to eat a little
once in a while.

321
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,280
True.

322
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,599
Then I'll make the order.

323
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,639
Okay.

324
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:10,479
Excuse me.

325
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:11,640
Yes.

326
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:15,919
One marbled beef,

327
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,279
one marinated lamb,

328
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:18,720
one pork belly,

329
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,680
one veggie platter,

330
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,599
and two pints of draft beer.

331
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,760
Okay.

332
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,000
If you have something to say,
just say it.

333
00:21:41,880 --> 00:21:42,959
I was wondering

334
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,680
why you suddenly asked me out

335
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,480
for dinner.

336
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:52,919
They serve special beef tongue here.

337
00:21:52,920 --> 00:21:54,240
It's interesting.

338
00:21:56,160 --> 00:21:57,760
Interesting how?

339
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,520
Excuse me.

340
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,200
Yes.

341
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:02,759
Could you tell us

342
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:05,079
what's interesting about beef tongue?

343
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:07,879
Our beef tongue is smooth, chewy,

344
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:08,959
finely sliced,

345
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,119
and it has the meaning of
"improving your eloquence".

346
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:12,399
Ever since we launched it,

347
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,319
we've been selling out.

348
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:14,959
Scalpers even tried to resell it.

349
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,879
To avoid more trouble,

350
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:19,359
we turned it into a challenge item.

351
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,439
So the two of you

352
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,119
have to complete a task

353
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:24,160
before you can get it.

354
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:26,320
There's a task?

355
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,520
A kiss of love between a couple.

356
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,360
Kiss?

357
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,640
If it's a French kiss,

358
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
we'll give you one more place.

359
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,920
French kiss?

360
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,680
Look over there.

361
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,200
Are you interested in trying?

362
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:11,960
Do you want to give it a shot?

363
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:18,280
If you insist,

364
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,440
I can force myself to do it.

365
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:23,080
Great.

366
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,119
Come.

367
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:26,200
Sit there. The background looks perfect.

368
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:43,800
You can start.

369
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,680
I'm going to the restroom.

370
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,400
Why is he so nervous?

371
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,200

Hello,

373
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:52,639
I looked for him in the restroom just now.

374
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:54,200
There's no one inside.

375
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,680
Ah.

376
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:58,680

(Yu Yu)
I'd like to invite you for BBQ again.

425
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,880
At my place.

426
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,280
Don't go.

427
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,000
Don't get the wrong idea.

428
00:29:57,520 --> 00:29:58,840
I put them

429
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,640
in the hallway

430
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,920
so the smell won't get into the house.

431
00:30:12,120 --> 00:30:13,280
I'm sorry.

432
00:30:14,300 --> 00:30:15,460
I messed it up.

433
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:19,920
That day at the BBQ place,

434
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,400
the closer I got to you,

435
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,720
the more images

436
00:30:28,770 --> 00:30:30,600
flooded into my head.

437
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,399
I feared

438
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,240
that once we got together,

439
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:38,640
we wouldn't last.

440
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:41,280
Why?

441
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,960
You know I'm terrible at this.

442
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:49,720
And I just...

443
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,920
I just feel like

444
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,919
I'll mess up so many things.

445
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,319
You're giving up at the beginning

446
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:59,360
because of an ending
you made up yourself.

447
00:31:01,080 --> 00:31:03,880
We haven't even started yet,

448
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:07,240
and you already declared it a failure.

449
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,839
If you avoid the battlefield

450
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,360
because you're afraid of losing,
isn't that being a deserter?

451
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,520
You say it like you're innocent,

452
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,080
as if it's just a prediction.

453
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:21,680
But the truth is, you're scared.

454
00:31:29,092 --> 00:31:30,600
And you're ignorant.

455
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:32,119
Because you don't understand

456
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:34,200
that love isn't a one-person thing.

457
00:31:34,680 --> 00:31:37,080
You think you'll ruin everything

458
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,480
because you forgot that I'm in this too.

459
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,880
If we date,

460
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,240
I'm not Dr. Gu anymore.

461
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:48,720
I'm not just your friend.

462
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:52,360
I'm your partner.

463
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,680
No matter what happens
or what problems come up,

464
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:01,240
you don't get to handle it alone.

465
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,440
I'll face it and solve it

466
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:08,680
with you.

467
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,200
Will you?

468
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:19,120
I will.

469
00:32:26,280 --> 00:32:27,520
Got it.

470
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:34,760
So?

471
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:41,240
Can you go in and grab me
a bottle of soy sauce?

472
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:44,760
Okay.

473
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:51,400
When I was little,

474
00:34:51,840 --> 00:34:53,000
I didn't like going out.

475
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,960
I loved staying home

476
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,239
and playing with mud.

477
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,560
I made little animals.

478
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,720
One day,

479
00:35:02,360 --> 00:35:03,680
it rained heavily

480
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,120
and washed

481
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,520
all the animals away.

482
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,760
My dad said,

483
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,199
"Hey,

484
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:14,040
why don't you make them a home

485
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,080
to give them a shelter?"

486
00:35:16,680 --> 00:35:18,240
I took that to heart,

487
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,760
so I studied architecture

488
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,200
and became a designer.

489
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
That secret garden

490
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,320
is the home I made for them.

491
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,800
Is it cute?

492
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,640
Come with me.

493
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,720
Let me show you something else.

494
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,800
This is the model of the house.

495
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:52,160
Why did you put me inside it?

496
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,600
You're using that photo.

497
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,880
It's to push myself.

498
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,720
I want to renovate this place,

499
00:36:04,680 --> 00:36:06,280
but it's really hard.

500
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:09,160
I'm afraid

501
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:10,960
I'll be discouraged.

502
00:36:12,080 --> 00:36:13,880
I'm afraid I'll give up.

503
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:16,120
So

504
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:19,040
I put you there.

505
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,240
What does this house have to do with me?

506
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,360
Of course, it has to do with you.

507
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,560
I designed this

508
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,960
for myself at first.

509
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,480
But now,

510
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:41,000
it's for two people.

511
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,200
Every design

512
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,680
is designed for two people.

513
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,560
Besides,

514
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,480
I have to consider your taste

515
00:36:52,690 --> 00:36:54,480
and your habits.

516
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,320
It's really hard.

517
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,400
My habits?

518
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,320
What do you mean?

519
00:37:13,680 --> 00:37:15,680
The first time we watched fireworks,

520
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
I built a wall.

521
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:24,450
When you came over to check on me,

522
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,320
I opened a window.

523
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,680
When we watched the sunrise,

524
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,560
I made a door.

525
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,960
And finally,

526
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:39,760
when you came with me
to the award ceremony,

527
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,280
I was ready to put on the roof

528
00:37:43,320 --> 00:37:44,680
and start the interior work.

529
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,600
I wanted to finish everything

530
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,280
and then invite you in.

531
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,880
But I got stuck.

532
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:01,760
I was scared I'd never get it right.

533
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:06,040
I was scared

534
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,120
you'd never walk through that door.

535
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:13,720
I was afraid.

536
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:17,680
That's why

537
00:38:18,640 --> 00:38:20,520
I ran away from the BBQ place.

538
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,400
But what you said outside just now

539
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:29,200
made me realize

540
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,480
this isn't something I face alone.

541
00:38:43,080 --> 00:38:44,360
So,

542
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,320
would you like to

543
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,880
decorate this house with me?

544
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,280
And when it's all done,

545
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:06,000
would you move in?

546
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,120
I'm hungry.

547
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,120
Do you want beef tongue?

548
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:27,200
Do we need to do a task for that too?

549
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:29,040
Yes.
