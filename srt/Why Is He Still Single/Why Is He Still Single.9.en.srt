That was quick.

I have not gone yet.

31
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:20,270

But I need to head to the site now.

33
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:25,620
You handle the drawing.

34
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,900
Send it to me once it is done.

35
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,390
Okay.

- My computer will not turn on.

Come use mine.

39
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,300

Why are you sitting here
instead of going to apologize?

57

Mr. Sun.

58
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:54,230
Get up.

59

This is for working.

60

You are quite cooperative today.

Why are you smiling like that?

62
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,030
What are you laughing at?
That smile is strange.

63
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,940
Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

64
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:31,790
It was my fault.

65
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,910
I misjudged you.

66

Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

71
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,060
I blamed you for nothing.

72
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:14,180
Rise.

73
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,230
From now on, do you trust me or Wu?

74
00:05:22,470 --> 00:05:23,710
Of course I trust you.

75
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:26,670
Mr. Yu, you are generous and forgiving.

76
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:28,180
Everything you say is right.

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:37,230
Sun should be the one apologizing.

78
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:39,300
- Mr. Sun!
- Mr. Sun!

79
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,350
Forget it.

80
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,470
I will go.

81
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:48,940
But you were not the one who hit him.

82
00:05:49,351 --> 00:05:50,500

88
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,420
that taking responsibility for others

89
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:07,060
is an act of greatness.

90

91

93
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:18,990

He is proud, but a little tsundere too.

103

104
00:06:59,030 --> 00:07:00,030
True.

120
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,060
No. Someone made me angry.

I heard the food is great.

131

Mr. Yu just kneaded
the flour into a dough.

166

Now we need to roll the pieces
into dumpling wrappers.

187
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,670
It is a woman.

188
00:11:17,310 --> 00:11:18,620
Hello, Auntie. I am Gu Yejia.

189
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,660
Yejia, hello.

190
00:11:21,310 --> 00:11:22,740
Are you two making dumplings?

191
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,430
Are you making them at your place?

192
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,380
It is so nice that my son
can make dumplings at your home.

193
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,780
What are you two doing
after you finish eating?

194
00:11:29,780 --> 00:11:30,951
Alright. I will stop talking.

195
00:11:30,973 --> 00:11:32,190
Any new movies lately?

196
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:33,740
He hung up.

197
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,950
Mom, you are going to
scare Dr. Gu again.

198
00:11:38,710 --> 00:11:40,110
Doctors are brave.

199
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:41,260
I will not scare her.

200
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,310
Mr. Yu, you are amazing.

201
00:11:55,950 --> 00:11:56,860
Of course.

202
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:57,910
Impressive.

203
00:11:58,470 --> 00:12:00,020
They are all the same size.

204
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,230
Alright. You may express
your admiration now.

205
00:12:04,110 --> 00:12:05,470
This one is great.

206
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:06,740
This one is great too.

207
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,780
They are all the same size.

208
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,590
This is perfectionist-level beauty.

209
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:14,950
Look at their aprons.

210
00:12:15,140 --> 00:12:17,020
Foodie. Chef.

211
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,830
They really match well.

212
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,430
They do look good together.

213
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,950
Alright. I am going to eat my dumplings.

214
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,260
Talk to you later. Bye.

215
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:28,740
What are you looking at?

216
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,710
The aprons are stating facts.

217
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,620
(Time is up)

218
00:12:35,262 --> 00:12:37,195
The dumplings are ready.
I will go serve them.

219
00:12:44,106 --> 00:12:45,480
These are way too good.

220
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,120
My ancestors worked
in the imperial kitchen.

221
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:48,480
- Really?
- No.

222
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,100
Right.

223
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
About last time...

224
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,617
Thank you for making
those four dishes for my dad.

225
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:58,110
It was nothing.

226
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,230
Eat more if you like them.

227
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:02,780
If it is not enough,
I can make you some hand-pulled noodles.

228
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,260
I cannot eat that much.

229
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:07,620
But you are really good
at making dough dishes. Why?

230
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,859
I studied architecture
at Tianjin University for five years.

231
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,950
The food in Tianjin is great.

232
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:13,110
Especially the seafood.

233
00:13:13,540 --> 00:13:15,780
And the Tianjin noodles
with gravy are amazing.

234
00:13:15,780 --> 00:13:17,380
Yes, they have eight toppings.

235
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:20,740
Dr. Gu.

236
00:13:21,830 --> 00:13:22,780
Mr. Zhang.

237
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,740
Good afternoon.

238
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,740
- Welcome.
- Hello.

239
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,990
Did you enjoy your meal?

240
00:13:25,990 --> 00:13:27,430
Very much. It was excellent.

241
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,860
Do you two know each other?

242
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,030
Kind of.

243
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:41,860
And this is...

244
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:42,950
He is my patient.

245
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,620
And also my friend.

246
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:49,670
Right.

247
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:51,150
Mr. Zhang.

248
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,230
About what happened last time...

249
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:55,780
What happened between you two?

250
00:13:57,540 --> 00:13:58,430
Nothing serious.

251
00:13:58,430 --> 00:13:59,900
My kitchen is next to this window.

252
00:13:59,906 --> 00:14:02,710
I cook every day. The sawdust flies into
my food. How am I supposed to eat that?

253
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:04,120
If it is nothing serious, why complain?

254
00:14:04,128 --> 00:14:05,500
- You are dramatic.
- You're rude.

255
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,620
You are still going on?

256
00:14:06,950 --> 00:14:07,860
Hold on.

257
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,500
I do not know what happened,

258
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,740
but if Mr. Zhang says it is nothing,

259
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:12,630
then let it go.

260
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:13,900
Let it go.

261
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:15,140
Eat your dumplings.

262
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:16,350
No, we cannot let it go.

263
00:14:16,373 --> 00:14:17,879
Mr. Zhang, I am sorry.

264
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:19,020
I did not manage my team well.

265
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,470
Please accept this watermelon.

266
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,900
I do not need the watermelon.

267
00:14:25,140 --> 00:14:26,660
Today's dumplings are on me.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,900
No need. I can pay myself.

269
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,350
Alright, suit yourself.

270
00:14:29,830 --> 00:14:30,800
Enjoy.

271
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,620
Take your time. Let me know
if you need anything.

272
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
- Alright.
- Okay, thank you.

273
00:14:41,230 --> 00:14:44,780
So you invited me
to eat dumplings to apologize.

274
00:14:45,595 --> 00:14:48,230
I came with you to eat dumplings
and apologize at the same time.

275
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,140
You needed me there for courage, right?

276
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:54,500
Wrong.

277
00:14:54,950 --> 00:14:56,950
My brain processes things too fast.

278
00:14:56,950 --> 00:14:59,350
I worry others cannot keep up
and misunderstand me.

279
00:15:00,660 --> 00:15:01,990
You were not very helpful,

280
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:03,380
but I still need to thank you.

281
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:06,230
Thank you for giving him
the courage to accept my apology.

282
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:09,620
You earned this. Here.

283
00:15:09,862 --> 00:15:11,000
- What?
- You're welcome.

284
00:15:13,710 --> 00:15:15,190
Do you know why he forgave you?

285
00:15:16,230 --> 00:15:17,310
Because I was sincere.

286
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:19,020
Because he is my blind date.

287
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:21,470
And he has been calling me,
trying to ask me out.

288
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:24,620
Blind date?

289
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,470
You have not given up on marriage?

290
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,310
Just because you gave up
does not mean I have to.

291
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,310
Here, it is too heavy.

292
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,340
I cannot carry it.

293
00:15:35,140 --> 00:15:37,900
He is over thirty and runs
such a strange dumpling shop.

294
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,260
He is not stable at all.

295
00:15:39,260 --> 00:15:40,190
He is not right for you.

296
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,950
Then what kind of person suits me?

297
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:44,070
Someone roughly like you.

298
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:44,920
That is enough.

299
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:46,500
What do you mean, roughly like me?

300
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:48,900
Someone who is not much better than you.

301
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:51,020
You are not much better than me.

302
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:52,550
I am better than you.

303
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,140
Though not by much.

304
00:15:54,990 --> 00:15:56,500
How are you better than me?

305
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,860
I have an extra watermelon.

306
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:03,860
Mr. Yu.

307
00:16:04,660 --> 00:16:08,260
Why did you bring Dr. Gu
with you to apologize yesterday?

308
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,900
I went with her to eat dumplings.

309
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,860
So next time you refuse to give in,

310
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:17,590
should we get Dr. Gu to help again?

311
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,380
I went with her...

312
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,230
Forget it.

313
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:28,140
There is a big project.

314
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:31,900
How big?

315
00:16:31,928 --> 00:16:32,995
Five hundred square meters.

316
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:34,540
Is that big enough?

317
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:36,020
More than enough.

318
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,260
Mr. Yu.

319
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,860
Take it. Hurry.

320
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,620
Five hundred square meters? Suspicious.

321
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,590
He is an artist.

322
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,950
An artist? Does he even understand art?

323
00:16:47,284 --> 00:16:49,240
He is a very popular painter right now.

324
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:51,500
One of his oil paintings
can sell for hundreds of thousands.

325
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:52,500
That impressive?

326
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,260
Designing a home
for such a famous artist.

327
00:16:59,773 --> 00:17:01,360
There will definitely be news coverage.

328
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:02,470
The budget is generous.

329
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:04,910
You can design it however you want.

330
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,950
And he even said clearly

331
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:10,190
that it must be designed by Yu Yu.

332
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:14,780
Then this artist really knows art.

333
00:17:17,580 --> 00:17:19,710
We will go to his place
for a party this weekend.

334
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,990
A party?

335
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,540
You need to meet him first,

336
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,990
and check out the house.

337
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,820
I hate parties.

338
00:17:30,017 --> 00:17:31,151
Five hundred square meters.

339
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:32,150
An artist.

340
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:34,260
(Famous Oil Painter)
News coverage.

341
00:17:34,262 --> 00:17:35,670
He needs you.

342
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:39,340
Alright then.

343
00:17:40,260 --> 00:17:42,150
Since he understands art,

344
00:17:42,630 --> 00:17:43,780
I will make an exception.

345
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,500
A gathering requires a female companion.

346
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:47,580
A female companion?

347
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,820
Do not look at me.

348
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,780
I am not a woman.

349
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:56,100
Why are you looking at me?

350
00:17:56,595 --> 00:17:57,870
I am definitely not a woman.

351
00:18:12,630 --> 00:18:13,710
Then I will dress as one?

352
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:32,230
Dao.

353
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,670
You are not behaving, huh?

354
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:40,020
When you have a dog,
you must keep the leash on at all times.

355
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:43,060
Isn't he leashed now?

356
00:18:43,540 --> 00:18:45,020
It suddenly ran, and I missed it.

357
00:18:45,150 --> 00:18:46,462
That is still your responsibility.

358
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:00,470
Do not look at it.

359
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:08,020
Xia Xiaoman.

360
00:19:09,020 --> 00:19:10,630
There is a party. Do you want to go?

361
00:19:11,470 --> 00:19:12,310
A party?

362
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,230
There will be lots of good food.

363
00:19:15,670 --> 00:19:17,630
And plenty of wealthy people and artists.

364
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:24,020
Wealthy artists?

365
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,940
(Pioneer Invitation. Exhibiting Artists)

366
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,300
Mr. Luo.

367
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,470
Ms. Lin.

368
00:20:09,470 --> 00:20:10,773
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

369
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:12,540
- Have you seen everything?
- Yes, we have.

370
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:14,470
- How is it?
- It is wonderful.

371
00:20:15,230 --> 00:20:16,390
Thank you.

372
00:20:40,580 --> 00:20:41,430
Well?

373
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:42,630
Any good men here?

374
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:46,150
No, only beautiful women.

375
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:02,300
Miss.

376
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:04,750
Sorry.

377
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:06,310
You...

378
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,060
Are you here alone?

379
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:11,500
I... I came with Mr. Yu.

380
00:21:11,990 --> 00:21:15,150
You are his girlfriend?

381
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:17,150
No. I am his neighbor.

382
00:21:19,430 --> 00:21:20,430
My name is Luo Han.

383
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,190
Hello, Mr. Luo.

384
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,430
You can call me Luo Han.

385
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:32,300
What do you think
of the bicycle I designed?

386
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:33,340
How is it?

387
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,340
You...

388
00:21:35,020 --> 00:21:36,200
- It looks nice.
- Try it.

389
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,300
Kick it?
[*Sounds the same as English "try"]

390
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:39,190
Give it a try.

391
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:42,990
Beautiful lady,

392
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,670
I sincerely invite you

393
00:21:44,870 --> 00:21:45,990
to join me

394
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:48,300
on my

395
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,430
Journey Bicycle.

396
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:55,430
The Journey Bicycle is ready to go.

397
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,380
How is it?

398
00:21:59,060 --> 00:21:59,900
Not bad.

399
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:01,630
This Journey Bicycle

400
00:22:01,950 --> 00:22:03,340
carries my glorious youth.

401
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,100
It holds my memories.

402
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:08,870
It is the passion of my younger days.

403
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:11,630
Your passion from your childhood?

404
00:22:11,910 --> 00:22:13,340
No wonder I did not understand it.

405
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:16,100
Let us have dinner sometime.

406
00:22:16,390 --> 00:22:17,230
Then

407
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:18,910
I can explain it to you slowly.

408
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:20,230
No need.

409
00:22:20,230 --> 00:22:22,060
It is no trouble. Very easy.

410
00:22:22,062 --> 00:22:23,580
Here, let us add each other on WeChat.

411
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,100
What are you doing?

412
00:22:27,910 --> 00:22:28,750
Look at this.

413
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,328
What does it look like to you?

414
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:32,580
It looks like Mr. Yu.

415
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,300
It feels like he has lost in
the battlefield of love his whole life.

416
00:22:39,150 --> 00:22:39,990
It does.

417
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,340
This is one of our big client's works.

418
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:48,380
What do you think?

419
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,430
This is called art?

420
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,780
What a mess.

421
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,780
A mess?

422
00:22:55,630 --> 00:22:56,470
Mr. Yu.

423
00:22:56,740 --> 00:22:58,060
What is wrong with this painting?

424
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,540
It is full of pretension.

425
00:23:03,540 --> 00:23:04,870
Overly contrived.

426
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,580
It lacks expressive vitality,

427
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,060
and independent thought.

428
00:23:08,540 --> 00:23:09,390
In my opinion,

429
00:23:09,417 --> 00:23:10,995
the frame is better than the painting.

430
00:23:11,190 --> 00:23:12,990
It has the Rococo shape

431
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,470
and the colors of contemporary art.

432
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,620
It is impressive.

433
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:18,750
Well said.

434
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,540
Your comments just now

435
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,950
will appear in the next issue
of the art review.

436
00:23:23,670 --> 00:23:24,670
I am so happy.

437
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,340
You enjoy being criticized?

438
00:23:27,990 --> 00:23:28,990
Not exactly.

439
00:23:29,990 --> 00:23:31,470
Because this painting is not mine.

440
00:23:32,390 --> 00:23:34,580
Did you not say it was your latest work?

441
00:23:34,820 --> 00:23:36,500
I made the frame.

442
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,240
Your sister?
[*Sounds the same as English "made"]

443
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,060
- Mr. Luo Han.
- Alright.

444
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:44,020
I heard you plan to renovate the place.

445
00:23:44,020 --> 00:23:47,020
Yes. Mr. Yu,
the master designer, will handle it.

446
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:48,780
Mr. Yu,

447
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:51,470
what style do you plan to design?

448
00:23:53,430 --> 00:23:55,870
Of course, it must match
the artist's temperament and taste.

449
00:23:55,870 --> 00:23:56,820
Secondly,

450
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,500
it needs to be luxurious.

451
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:01,060
I want it to feel like
the most exclusive

452
00:24:01,300 --> 00:24:02,910
private club in Shanghai.

453
00:24:05,395 --> 00:24:06,710
You are not planning to live here?

454
00:24:07,820 --> 00:24:08,670
I am.

455
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,540
Do not give me
any of that "homey feeling"

456
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,430
or "warm atmosphere."

457
00:24:14,670 --> 00:24:16,710
I do not need anything domestic.

458
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:19,670
All I want is that during my parties,

459
00:24:19,670 --> 00:24:22,020
my guests will gasp and scream in awe.

460
00:24:25,470 --> 00:24:26,740
But a house designed like that

461
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:27,780
will get boring quickly.

462
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:29,230
Then I will tear it down and redo it.

463
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,910
If I do not like it,
I will renovate again.

464
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,260
Please leave.

465
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:34,300
Yes. Wow.

466
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,300
Wow.

467
00:24:36,470 --> 00:24:37,390
What "wow"?

468
00:24:37,780 --> 00:24:38,670
Stop talking.

469
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:39,910
Watch your attitude.

470
00:24:43,230 --> 00:24:44,230
Nonsense.

471
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,100
My beautiful lady,

472
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,950
would you like to know
the story behind this piece?

473
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,710
I do not understand art.

474
00:25:07,190 --> 00:25:08,190
Hello, Mr. Luo.

475
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:10,470
Hello, Ms. Lin.

476
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,670
Congratulations.

477
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:13,100
Your exhibition is a great success.

478
00:25:13,230 --> 00:25:15,230
And you have gained a true admirer.

479
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,260
I am very pleased.

480
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:29,820
Among everyone here,

481
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,710
only Mr. Yu appreciated
your exquisite frame.

482
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,630
So you can safely entrust
the design to him.

483
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:38,260
Master Yu is not mingling
with the crowd.

484
00:25:38,710 --> 00:25:40,540
He really is quiet.

485
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:43,060
Sorry, Mr. Yu is

486
00:25:43,060 --> 00:25:44,300
not very fond of chatting.

487
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,990
It adds to the artist's mystique.

488
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,870
I feel confident giving him my house.

489
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:52,950
Let's sign the contract soon.

490
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:55,500
Thank you for your trust.

491
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,740
You are welcome.

492
00:26:08,630 --> 00:26:11,150
Congratulations on securing
this big project.

493
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:14,990
Are you alright?

494
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,740
I guess so.

495
00:26:18,417 --> 00:26:19,710
Why did you call me here again?

496
00:26:20,230 --> 00:26:22,780
I wanted to
ask you something about Auntie.

497
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:23,780
Auntie?

498
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,900
Yes.

499
00:26:25,060 --> 00:26:27,430
It highlights that she is your mom too.

500
00:26:27,430 --> 00:26:28,540
You should handle it.

501
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,500
What about her?

502
00:26:33,150 --> 00:26:35,500
It seems she is not planning to leave.

503
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,430
She wants to stay
at my place permanently.

504
00:26:37,706 --> 00:26:39,020
And what is wrong with that?

505
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:40,580
You do not understand, Yu.

506
00:26:41,150 --> 00:26:42,500
Living with elders means

507
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:45,260
every habit of yours
has to follow theirs.

508
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,150
For example,

509
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:48,190
I still have to wake up
at seven on weekends.

510
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:50,540
All the food I cook

511
00:26:50,540 --> 00:26:52,230
must match her taste.

512
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:53,795
I cannot even use the vacuum cleaner.

513
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:55,950
She thinks it does not
clean thoroughly enough.

514
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:57,190
It is exhausting.

515
00:26:57,306 --> 00:27:00,060
So basically, you do not want to live
with your mother-in-law, right?

516
00:27:00,060 --> 00:27:01,060
No. You cannot say that.

517
00:27:01,060 --> 00:27:01,910
Then what can I say?

518
00:27:01,920 --> 00:27:02,840
Stop it.

519
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:03,990
No.

520
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,270
Yu.

521
00:27:06,950 --> 00:27:08,950
I just want you to help me.

522
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:10,870
Ask her gently

523
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,100
when she plans to leave.

524
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:12,950
Ask her yourself.

525
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,060
I am the son-in-law.

526
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:15,670
Asking would ruin the harmony.

527
00:27:15,950 --> 00:27:17,230
You are her son.

528
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,260
It is fine if you ask.

529
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,300
Alright.

530
00:27:20,417 --> 00:27:21,510
I will think about it.

531
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:23,260
Thanks, Yu.

532
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,380
(I will hold on to this peace)

533
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,900
(and wait for everyone to gather.)

534
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,660
(See you.)

535
00:27:29,910 --> 00:27:31,100
My brother is here.

536
00:27:33,230 --> 00:27:34,550
- You are here, Yu.
- I am here.

537
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,910
Yu.

538
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:42,060
Don't forget to ask Mom
about that thing later.

539
00:27:42,060 --> 00:27:42,900
Just that matter.

540
00:27:44,173 --> 00:27:44,879
Alright.

541
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:46,630
Have a seat first.
I will get you some water.

542
00:27:46,630 --> 00:27:47,580
- Mom.
- Uncle.

543
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,284
- This is for you.
- She is calling you.

544
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,060
You do not like it?

545
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:16,540
Mom.

546
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:19,060
What is your relationship
with Dr. Gu now?

547
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,020
Doctor and patient.

548
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:26,470
What kind of patient goes to
a doctor's home to make dumplings?

549
00:28:27,710 --> 00:28:28,990
We ate at a restaurant.

550
00:28:29,190 --> 00:28:30,990
A restaurant
where you can make dumplings?

551
00:28:32,470 --> 00:28:34,340
Can you come up with a believable lie?

552
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,060
The restaurant is an unbelievable one.

553
00:28:36,990 --> 00:28:37,990
Let me tell you,

554
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,820
next time you two go on a date,
take me with you.

555
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,190
Why?

556
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,670
So I can see
how your relationship is progressing.

557
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:46,630
She will not notice me.

558
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:47,990
That is spying.

559
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:49,740
How is that spying?

560
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:50,740
Mom.

561
00:28:50,817 --> 00:28:52,617
Keep your voice down.
We are watching TV.

562
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,060
I have seen this cartoon.

563
00:29:00,060 --> 00:29:01,260
You watch cartoons too?

564
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:04,340
The final villain
is called the "Corpse Emperor."

565
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:05,740
Yu.

566
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,260
How can you be like this?

567
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:09,150
Spoilers are shameful, you know.

568
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:12,020
- Keep watching if you do not believe me.
- Enough. Go home.

569
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,390
Why did you even come?

570
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:14,660
Alright.

571
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:17,820
Dad, why did you call Uncle over?

572
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:18,990
Exactly.

573
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:21,230
Your uncle loves you very much.

574
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:22,550
No, he does not.

575
00:29:22,551 --> 00:29:23,740
You do not like him anymore?

576
00:29:25,260 --> 00:29:26,780
Why did you not ask Mom?

577
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:27,820
I did not get the chance.

578
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:47,910
Where is your mother?

579
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:58,820
When exactly do you have time?

580
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:01,390
How about tomorrow?

581
00:30:01,820 --> 00:30:02,660
Hello?

582
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,870
Mr. Yu.

583
00:30:06,106 --> 00:30:07,500
Are you on a date with that artist?

584
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,190
No.

585
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,230
I really do not have time these days.

586
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:14,840
So please stop asking me out for now.

587
00:30:15,500 --> 00:30:16,390
I already said so,

588
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:17,595
and he still will not give up.

589
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:19,630
Just block him.

590
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,580
That feels a bit impolite.

591
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:25,870
With someone like him,
a "citrus person",

592
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:27,150
why bother being polite?

593
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,060
A citrus person?

594
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:34,020
A citrus marries all kinds of fruit,

595
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,430
and produces all kinds of fruit.

596
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,260
Then that citrus is very loving.

597
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:41,990
Do you need me to explain it to you?

598
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:43,580
No, no need.

599
00:30:45,430 --> 00:30:46,300
Well...

600
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:47,670
What I really wanted to ask is,

601
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:50,780
when will this project
of yours be fully completed?

602
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,380
Why?

603
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:54,820
I was thinking...

604
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,100
After your project is done,

605
00:30:57,100 --> 00:30:58,670
I will block him completely.

606
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:01,580
Since you were the one
who introduced him to me.

607
00:31:02,173 --> 00:31:03,630
I am worried it might affect you,

608
00:31:03,630 --> 00:31:04,520
Wu,

609
00:31:04,520 --> 00:31:05,430
and Xiaoxiao.

610
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,740
They really need this project.

611
00:31:14,430 --> 00:31:15,820
Just mind your own business.

612
00:31:58,670 --> 00:32:00,540
He is pursuing Xia Xiaoman?

613
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,820
That is harassment.

614
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,990
Artists can be passionate.

615
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:08,230
Didn't Tang Bohu pursue Qiuxiang?

616
00:32:09,351 --> 00:32:10,870
There was no Qiuxiang in real life.

617
00:32:11,373 --> 00:32:13,773
Tang Bohu cheated in
the imperial exam and divorced his wife.

618
00:32:13,780 --> 00:32:15,780
He only painted to survive afterward.

619
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:18,990
His paintings may be worth billions now,

620
00:32:19,217 --> 00:32:21,300
but back then, you could swap one
for two steamed buns.

621
00:32:21,351 --> 00:32:22,870
Look it up if you do not believe me.

622
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:24,390
How is that the same thing?

623
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:26,670
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

624
00:32:26,670 --> 00:32:27,670
Ms. Lin.

625
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:29,100
I am all done.

626
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:30,500
You worked fast this time.

627
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:31,990
This is what we call

628
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:34,340
profit being the greatest motivation.

629
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,950
Mr. Yu.

630
00:32:36,190 --> 00:32:37,630
Come take a look at my model.

631
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:39,900
Come on.

632
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,060
I am not taking this job.

633
00:32:44,430 --> 00:32:45,270
What?

634
00:32:50,950 --> 00:32:52,430
You are really dropping the project

635
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:54,106
because he is harassing Xia Xiaoman?

636
00:32:55,484 --> 00:32:56,870
It has nothing to do with her.

637
00:32:58,300 --> 00:33:00,340
Then give me a reason. A real one.

638
00:33:02,740 --> 00:33:04,710
I cannot stand how he sees a home.

639
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,580
Everything has to be lavish.

640
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,060
Every guest must walk in and go "wow."

641
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:10,540
What does he think a home is?

642
00:33:11,417 --> 00:33:13,390
And he wants to tear down
my design anytime.

643
00:33:13,710 --> 00:33:15,710
What? His paintings count as art,

644
00:33:15,710 --> 00:33:17,100
but my design does not?

645
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:18,870
If he plans to tear it down anytime,

646
00:33:18,870 --> 00:33:20,020
why should I do it at all?

647
00:33:24,190 --> 00:33:25,430
Because he is paying.

648
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:26,630
Because this is your job.

649
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:27,540
Let me tell you,

650
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:28,870
this is not just about you.

651
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,500
Suppliers, contractors,

652
00:33:30,500 --> 00:33:31,780
me, Wu, Xiaoxiao,

653
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,820
and dozens of people

654
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:34,230
are tied to this project.

655
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:36,580
Then get another designer.

656
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,300
He insisted on having you.

657
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,190
The contract is signed.

658
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,540
Who is paying the penalty?

659
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,940
Me.

660
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:43,940
You?

661
00:33:48,780 --> 00:33:50,060
Unbelievable.

662
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,670
He comes and goes

663
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:53,100
whenever he wants.

664
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,500
Mr. Yu only responds
to kindness, not pressure.

665
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,500
Should we beg him, then?

666
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:03,500
You beg him.

667
00:34:16,790 --> 00:34:19,750
I was thinking I would wait
until your project is done

668
00:34:19,750 --> 00:34:21,310
before blocking him.

669
00:34:21,662 --> 00:34:23,020
I do not want it to affect you,

670
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:23,950
Wu,

671
00:34:23,950 --> 00:34:25,060
and Xiaoxiao.

672
00:34:25,060 --> 00:34:26,790
They really need this project.

673
00:34:27,430 --> 00:34:28,310
Mr. Yu,

674
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,620
fifty thousand is still a lot of money.

675
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,790
It is basically
half of Wu's yearly salary.

676
00:34:32,790 --> 00:34:35,700

I am the one paying.

Grow up?

00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:05,790
Highly unlikely.

727
00:37:05,790 --> 00:37:06,950
Not much hope there.

728
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:10,620
But do not stay mad at him.

729
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,830
Being mad at him only punishes yourself.

730
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:14,430
You are free anyway.

731
00:37:14,430 --> 00:37:15,870
Why not vent to me a little?

732
00:37:15,870 --> 00:37:17,684
Do not bottle it up

00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:34,390
I cannot invite you to dinner
for no reason?

738
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:36,062
You would not ask me out for nothing.

739
00:37:36,062 --> 00:37:37,328
And you changed into new clothes.

740
00:37:37,430 --> 00:37:38,580
This is old.

741
00:37:38,830 --> 00:37:40,660

742
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:42,390

00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,020
Get what?

745
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:45,950
You are craving.

746
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,100
You want to eat my dumplings, right?

747
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:50,380
Yes.

748
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:51,420
Yes.

749
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:53,660
Fine, take off the apron.

750
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:54,940
I will do it.

751
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:57,380
(Foodie)

752
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:00,020
So...

753
00:38:00,540 --> 00:38:02,990
Can you continue
with that artist's project?

754
00:38:03,910 --> 00:38:04,750
No.

755
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,990
No job is 100% your ideal.

756
00:38:10,990 --> 00:38:13,500
You know my attitude toward work.

757
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,750
I know, but...

758
00:38:15,750 --> 00:38:16,750
That is why I cannot

759
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:18,270
design a home for someone

760
00:38:18,270 --> 00:38:19,573
whose values clash with mine.

761
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:22,910
I treat patients with different beliefs
from mine too.

762
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:25,430
But I still have to treat them.

763
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,430
Take you, for example.

764
00:38:27,660 --> 00:38:28,500
You know,

765
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,870
you are not dealing with patients.

766
00:38:30,995 --> 00:38:32,270
You are dealing with lives.

767
00:38:32,700 --> 00:38:34,540
I am not dealing with a house.

768
00:38:34,540 --> 00:38:35,580
I am dealing with a home.

769
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:37,390
You must protect lives.

770
00:38:37,390 --> 00:38:38,620
I must protect a home.

771
00:38:38,870 --> 00:38:40,390
He does not see it as a home.

772
00:38:40,995 --> 00:38:42,906
This has nothing to do with you anymore.

773
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:50,990
Let us look at it from another angle.

774
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,620
If you continue,

775
00:38:54,870 --> 00:38:55,990
you will be unhappy.

776
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:57,660
If you quit,

777
00:38:57,660 --> 00:38:59,660
Lin Sa and Wu will be unhappy.

778
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,310
If they are unhappy,

779
00:39:01,310 --> 00:39:02,910
you will be unhappy too.

780
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:04,830
Because they are
the closest people to you.

781
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:07,870
Either way, you end up unhappy.

782
00:39:07,870 --> 00:39:09,540
So you might as well help them.

783
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,700
Make them happy.

784
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,660
So just to make them happy,

785
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:14,790
I have to swallow it?

786
00:39:14,950 --> 00:39:16,700
They put up with you all the time too.

787
00:39:25,580 --> 00:39:27,180
Mr. Yu, I am sorry.

788
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:28,990
I blamed you unfairly.

789
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,390
Mr. Yu, you are generous and forgiving.

790
00:39:31,390 --> 00:39:32,870
Whatever you say goes from now on.

791
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,140
They put up with you
because they respect you,

792
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,660
not because they owe you.

793
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:47,140
Is this what relationships are?

794
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,750
It is the responsibility
and duty of friends.

795
00:39:53,660 --> 00:39:54,910
You can live without friends?

796
00:39:56,750 --> 00:39:57,620
I can.

797
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,340
(Yu Yu Design Studio)

798
00:40:26,195 --> 00:40:27,595
Have you been putting up with me?

799
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,060
It is fine. Just say it.

800
00:40:33,990 --> 00:40:35,270
Why say that?

801
00:40:35,351 --> 00:40:37,128
You will just get mad at me later.

802
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:10,150
Morning,

803
00:41:11,620 --> 00:41:12,470
everyone.

804
00:41:28,928 --> 00:41:31,220
(I went to talk to Mr. Yu yesterday.
He did not agree.)

805
00:41:46,220 --> 00:41:47,060
This project...

806
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:49,580
I plan to take it.

807
00:41:50,180 --> 00:41:51,220
- Really?
- Why?

808
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:52,060
Because I want to.

809
00:41:58,060 --> 00:41:58,990
Are you all happy now?

810
00:41:58,990 --> 00:41:59,830
Of course.

811
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:02,790
My luxurious European trip
can finally happen.

812
00:42:03,430 --> 00:42:04,620
Going alone is boring.

813
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,220
Who said I am going alone?

814
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,220
Mr. Yu, what do you want for lunch?

815
00:42:08,220 --> 00:42:09,500
My treat, order anything.

816
00:42:09,870 --> 00:42:11,660
Except dumplings. Anything else is fine.

817
00:42:12,620 --> 00:42:13,460
No problem.

818
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:14,830
Let me make a call.

819
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:20,500
Hello?

820
00:42:20,790 --> 00:42:21,630
Dr. Gu.

821
00:42:21,870 --> 00:42:22,790
Ms. Lin.

822
00:42:22,790 --> 00:42:25,100
Mr. Yu agreed to continue
with the project.

823
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:27,830
He agreed?

824
00:42:27,830 --> 00:42:29,430
You really are a miracle worker.

825
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,750
Cured him in one shot.

826
00:42:30,750 --> 00:42:32,100
How did you persuade him?

827
00:42:34,700 --> 00:42:36,270
I did not really say anything.

828
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:39,470
Well, thank you then.

829
00:42:39,660 --> 00:42:40,500
I will hang up now.

830
00:42:41,140 --> 00:42:41,980
Goodbye.

831
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
