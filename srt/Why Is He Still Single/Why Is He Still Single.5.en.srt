he'll actually wear this out?)

31
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,070
(Not just out.)

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:26,540
(Look.)

33
00:02:27,460 --> 00:02:28,300
Mr. Yu.

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:29,350
Speak.

35
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:33,140
You actually wore that thing
to work this morning?

36
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,830
This is called a hat.

37
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,140
Yes, a hat.

38
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:41,020
But the color of that hat of yours...

39
00:02:43,462 --> 00:02:44,740
Forget it, I won't say it.

40
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,740
Just say it.

41
00:02:49,573 --> 00:02:51,390
Why would a single man wear a green hat?

You dare laugh?

44
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,270
I didn't laugh.

45
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,420
I was thinking of Xiaoxiao.

46
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,020
Xiaoxiao was amazing yesterday.

47
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:14,020
She figured out
from Xia Xiaoman's outfit

48
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,550
that she's really broke.

49
00:03:16,110 --> 00:03:17,350
Is Xia Xiaoman really broke now?

50
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:19,300
I couldn't tell at all.

51
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:22,980
Ms. Lin.

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,630
Goodness.

53
00:03:25,790 --> 00:03:28,020
Why would you wear a green hat
when you're single?

54
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:36,020
Oh dear.

55
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:37,830
My great designer Yu.

56
00:03:38,270 --> 00:03:39,670
You not only changed the materials,

57
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,230
but you also
adjusted some of the design,

58
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,350
and lowered the cost.

59
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,990
You even kept the open kitchen.

60
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:46,070
You're wonderful.

61
00:03:46,420 --> 00:03:47,580
Really?

62
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,700
You would revise your own design?

63
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:51,570
Why?

64
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:54,020
To help them live better,

65
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,860
and to help you earn a bit more bonus.

66
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:00,550
I was wrong, Mr. Yu.

67
00:04:00,550 --> 00:04:01,860
You really do have a kind heart.

68
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:04,420
Of course, his heart is the warmest.

69
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,740
Right.

70
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,070
Do you think this hat looks good on me?

71
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:14,270
Look at that green.

72
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:15,950
That green is really something.

73
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,706
- Right?
- It even matches your outfit.

74
00:04:17,706 --> 00:04:19,590
Wu, you really should wear it.

75
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,430
No need, Ms. Lin.

76
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,570
My green shirt is enough.

77
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:23,151
Alright, fine, it looks good.

78
00:04:23,173 --> 00:04:25,350
I'm telling you,
green hats are all the rage this year.

79
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:27,550
We won't wear them,
won't wear anything green.

80
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,060
(Hahaha)

81
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:35,300
What are you laughing at? So happy?

82
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,140
Come look.

83
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,990
I sent Mr. Yu's hat photo to Wu.

84
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,180
He made a meme out of it.

85
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:42,860
Wu is too talented.

86
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,830
Any more?

87
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:46,740
Should I make a group chat?

88
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,300
I'll ask him to make more and send them.

89
00:04:48,306 --> 00:04:49,060
Yes.

90
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:51,350
Are we being too mean?

91
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,350
How could we be?

92
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,500
He's annoying.

93
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:55,710
He deserves a bit of teasing.

94
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:58,860

invites you to a group chat)

96
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:04,420
(What should we name the group?)

97
00:05:05,928 --> 00:05:07,150
(Let's call it the Idle Group.)

98
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:09,550
(Good name.)

99
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,420
(Idle Group.)

100
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:32,030
Here's your 10,000.

101
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:36,550
I borrowed that 10,000
to invest in my friend's restaurant.

102
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:38,030
(Ma's Roast Lamb Leg)

103
00:05:38,030 --> 00:05:40,150
This card counts as the interest.

104
00:05:40,350 --> 00:05:42,790
All the vegetarian dishes are free.

105
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:44,350
Ma's Roast Lamb Leg.

106
00:05:44,506 --> 00:05:45,710
Vegetarian dishes are free?

107
00:05:45,951 --> 00:05:47,180
Am I supposed to eat cumin?

108
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:48,500
Listen to yourself.

109
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,817
Who said you have to eat spices?

110
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,470
Hey, hey.

111
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,820
Yu, could you lend me another 10,000?

112
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:58,060
It's just that this month...

113
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:00,551
I have over a dozen weddings
and funerals to give gifts to.

114
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:02,060
I really can't keep up.

115
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,990
Hmph.

116
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,060
Pointless social rituals.

117
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
What are you counting?

118
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,380
Exactly 10,000.

119
00:06:07,790 --> 00:06:08,630
Here's 9,000.

120
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:10,380
What?

121
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,528
Nine out, and thirteen back.

122
00:06:11,670 --> 00:06:12,710
You owe me 13,000.

123
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,230
You're ruthless.

124
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:15,751
We're real brothers.

125
00:06:15,795 --> 00:06:17,662
Even if you were my own dad,
no exception.

126
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:22,350
Mom, Dad has money now.

127
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:24,180
Ha ha.

128
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,070
Hey.

129
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,030
2,000 a month for your allowance
still isn't enough?

130
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,150
It really isn't.

131
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,060
There are too many dinners to attend.

132
00:06:57,373 --> 00:06:58,940
Our daughter wants to learn piano.

133
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,150
What do you think?

134
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,790
Why not violin?

135
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,030
Mom can teach her, and it's free.

136
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:07,030
The issue is that your niece
isn't interested.

137
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:10,860
Piano is good.

138
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:13,230
She might even be a musician
in the future.

139
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:14,590
Right?

140
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:16,620
Right, I agree.

141
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:20,500
So, between your daughter's future
and eating out with friends,

142
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:21,910
which matters more?

143
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,620
Her future matters more, of course.

144
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,230
Congratulations, you fell right in.

145
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,300
The piano lesson fee.

146
00:07:35,260 --> 00:07:36,150
You can cover it.

147
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:41,670
How much is it?

148
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,300
500 per lesson.

149
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,670
20 lessons in total.

150
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:47,910
This is what marriage is.

151
00:07:48,380 --> 00:07:50,260
A constant game of strategy, right?

152
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:03,750
Thanks.

153
00:08:05,030 --> 00:08:05,910
Hey.

154
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,110
My money.

155
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:20,470
The piano lesson fee

156
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,017
will come out of your allowance.

157
00:08:22,420 --> 00:08:23,260
Wait...

158
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,420
Even less allowance now.

159
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:30,940
And you still owe me 4,000.

160
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:31,910
What?

161
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:33,950
I'm calling the police.

162
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,310
Your Macallan Impression.

163
00:08:57,380 --> 00:08:58,220
Please.

164
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,190
Thank you.

165
00:08:59,262 --> 00:09:00,500
A little surprise for you.

166
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,110
A small gift.

167
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,270
Do you like it?

168
00:09:04,020 --> 00:09:06,380
This necklace is lovely.

169
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:11,540
It suits you.

170
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:13,110
I think so.

171
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,660
It looks so nice.

172
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:16,860
Can I show it off to my friends?

173
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:17,780
Go on.

174
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:19,140
I'll excuse myself then.

175
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,980
Alright.

176
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,710
What are you drinking today?

177
00:09:29,350 --> 00:09:30,350
The usual.

178
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:31,190
Alright.

179
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,860
A new girlfriend again?

180
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:35,430
She isn't my girlfriend.

181
00:09:36,380 --> 00:09:38,230
We just met by chance.

182
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:40,510
With no pressure between us,

183
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,020
we're having a small adventure.

184
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:44,990
Of course, this adventure

185
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,430
doesn't have to involve
the same person every time.

186
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,230
You're really philosophical.

187
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,620
You need experience.

188
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,230
When you have had enough of it,

189
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,470
you can find answers in the adventure.

190
00:09:55,190 --> 00:09:57,260
So, can you tell me

191
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,310
what the answer is now?

192
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:00,020
I think it might be money.

193
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,950
Take that girl just now.

194
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,780
She's actually a flight attendant.

195
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:07,540
I met her on a flight to Paris.

196
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,230
To make sure we could talk quietly,

197
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,706
I booked the entire first class cabin
on the way back.

198
00:10:13,230 --> 00:10:15,860
So money brought you love.

199
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,470
Smart. That's for you.

200
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,070
Thanks.

201
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,500
And now it brings my gratitude
and respect for you as well.

202
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:29,950
Beer promotion.

203
00:10:29,950 --> 00:10:31,310
Come take a look.

204
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,380
Come on, have a look.

205
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:34,230
It's a great deal right now.

206
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:35,500
Come on, look.

207
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,260
It's a great deal. Have a drink.

208
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:38,660
What do you think?

209
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,990
Harley, the hurdle men
can't seem to cross.

210
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:46,430
Have a beer instead.

211
00:10:46,590 --> 00:10:47,590
Sit and take your time.

212
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:48,740
Aren't you cold?

213
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:51,900
I am, but if you buy a beer,

214
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:53,595
I'll be so happy that I won't feel cold.

215
00:10:53,630 --> 00:10:54,500
Give me a dozen.

216
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,900
Sure, come inside.

217
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,310
Hello, everyone.

218
00:10:57,310 --> 00:10:59,860
If you like our beer, give it a try.

219
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:00,950
This one,

220
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:02,350
strawberry beer.

221
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:03,190
It's great.

222
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,710
And we have promotions now.

223
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,440
Alright, you go somewhere else first.

224
00:11:06,462 --> 00:11:07,660
- We'll look around.
- Sure.

225
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,220
No problem. Please enjoy.

226
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:14,900
Let's pack it instead.

227
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:15,990
No problem.

228
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:17,260
Add me on WeChat.

229
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:19,020
I'll take you out for skewers tonight.

230
00:11:19,190 --> 00:11:20,740
I'll cover the drinks, alright?

231
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:21,860
Add me then.

232
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,500
Cheers.

233
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,500
Have one.

234
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,710
Why are you ignoring me?

235
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:28,550
Have a drink.

236
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,830
No, enjoy your night.

237
00:11:30,830 --> 00:11:32,110
What's that attitude?

238
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:35,620
That little butt is really perky. Nice.

239
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,980
Say that again.

240
00:11:43,990 --> 00:11:45,190
What's that attitude?

241
00:11:45,462 --> 00:11:46,950
Believe it or not, I'll report you.

242
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,950
This flat of yours...

243
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,430
Do you have to pay
the service charge every month?

244
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,460
Yes.

245
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,310
How much?

246
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:55,150
1,000.

247
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:56,860
1,000?

248
00:11:56,860 --> 00:11:58,430
Why is yours 1,000 and mine 4,000?

249
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:15,540
(Credits)

250
00:12:19,351 --> 00:12:21,190
How long have you been
standing behind me?

251
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,710
About ten seconds.

252
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:24,070
Why didn't you say anything?

253
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:25,260
I was afraid I'd startle you.

254
00:12:25,260 --> 00:12:26,420
You might choke while eating.

255
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,780
That's considerate.

256
00:12:27,950 --> 00:12:28,790
Sit.

257
00:12:33,310 --> 00:12:34,150
What's wrong now?

258
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:37,590
Oh, my duodenum hurts a bit.

259
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,020
That's your stomach.

260
00:12:39,430 --> 00:12:40,500
Then, it's stomach pain.

261
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,020
Any other symptoms?

262
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,830
Dizziness and nausea.

263
00:12:45,310 --> 00:12:46,620
My vision's a bit blurry.

264
00:12:47,020 --> 00:12:47,860
Alright.

265
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,595
I'll prescribe you something
to clear your head when I get to work.

266
00:12:51,140 --> 00:12:52,070
Right.

267
00:12:53,110 --> 00:12:54,230
I saw Ms. Lin yesterday.

268
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:55,670
Lin Sa?

269
00:12:55,830 --> 00:12:56,670
Where?

270
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:58,540
In a bedroom.

271
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:06,110
Oh, sorry.

272
00:13:09,350 --> 00:13:10,350
Dr. Gu.

273
00:13:12,590 --> 00:13:14,070
Ms. Lin.

274
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,370
So, what brings you here today?

275
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,520
Buying a flat or planning a renovation?

276
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,230
I just want to redo our home.

277
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:21,950
Came to look at the show flats.

278
00:13:21,950 --> 00:13:22,900
See if I get any ideas.

279
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:24,020
Renovating?

280
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,110
Then you should come to me.

281
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,230
Renovation takes time.

282
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:28,310
You can't rush it.

283
00:13:28,470 --> 00:13:29,900
Look around, and compare more.

284
00:13:30,230 --> 00:13:31,740
Follow your own style.

285
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,195
Pick slowly, and choose what you like.

286
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,740
She said you cut the cost

287
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,070
and still met the client's needs.

288
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:38,230
The client was thrilled.

289
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:40,590
Said the money saved
could go to hiring a carer

290
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,830
to look after their ill mother.

291
00:13:41,830 --> 00:13:43,860
That would ease the wife's burden.

292
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:45,660
You really did something wonderful.

293
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:47,070
It's nothing.

294
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:48,862
Just saving them a bit of money.

295
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:52,190
Money, when used well,

296
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,830
can bring people joy.

297
00:13:53,973 --> 00:13:55,528
It can even improve relationships.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,500
What is it?

299
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:22,430
Your dog was loud tonight.

300
00:14:23,860 --> 00:14:24,700
Oh.

301
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:26,900
I worked late.

302
00:14:27,230 --> 00:14:28,500
Didn't have time to walk it.

303
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:29,430
Sorry.

304
00:14:29,430 --> 00:14:30,710
Selling cars at 10 at night?

305
00:14:33,110 --> 00:14:35,430
It's a part-time job selling beer.

306
00:14:36,817 --> 00:14:38,380
Can't afford the service charge, right?

307
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:44,660
Even with that job,

308
00:14:45,310 --> 00:14:46,780
three more of those won't cover it.

309
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,660
Then I'll just have to move out.

310
00:14:58,660 --> 00:14:59,660
Alright then.

311
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:22,230
What's this?

312
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,030
Money.

313
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:26,500
Why are you giving me money?

314
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:28,190
I know you like this flat.

315
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:30,470
And I know

316
00:15:30,950 --> 00:15:32,860
how important a home is to someone.

317
00:15:33,284 --> 00:15:35,540
Especially for someone
drifting alone like you.

318
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,260
Stop selling beer.

319
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:42,950
That way, the customers
will be happier too.

320
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,310
I saw those men

321
00:15:48,310 --> 00:15:49,150
harassing you.

322
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,620
You glared at them fiercely.

323
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:53,900
As if you'd smash a bottle on them.

324
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,340
Let me tell you.

325
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,190
You can't beat those young girls.

326
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,620
They know how to please customers.

327
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:02,540
If you really want to sell beer,

328
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:04,062
you might as well livestream.

329
00:16:05,110 --> 00:16:06,310
They can't touch you,

330
00:16:06,310 --> 00:16:08,070
and you get beauty filters.

331
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,380
A few years later, when you've aged,

332
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:11,780
they won't notice.

333
00:16:14,430 --> 00:16:16,430
I don't usually spend much.

334
00:16:16,751 --> 00:16:18,350
I just end up buying useless things.

335
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:20,540
Buying rubbish

336
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,030
or giving it to you

337
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:23,030
is all the same.

338
00:16:23,128 --> 00:16:24,795
Either way makes no difference to me.

339
00:16:24,830 --> 00:16:26,860
At least you'll say thank you.

340
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,020
But I think

341
00:16:28,310 --> 00:16:29,780
the money I'm giving you

342
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,230
feels worthwhile to me.

343
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:34,110
It gives me a sense of helping someone.

344
00:16:34,950 --> 00:16:35,790
But don't worry.

345
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:37,310
I don't need your thanks.

346
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,470
Using this money

347
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:41,260
to find some sense of achievement in me?

348
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,100
Does that amuse you?

349
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:44,430
You mock me,

350
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,350
belittle me,

351
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,110
and call me ugly for fun?

352
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,110
Is that fun?

353
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:51,350
- I...
- Useless!

354
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:34,300
Don't panic. Listen to me.

355
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:35,910
Hold him from behind.

356
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:37,740
Make a fist with one hand, palm in.

357
00:17:37,910 --> 00:17:39,740
Place it between his navel and ribs.

358
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:41,740
Use your other hand to grip your wrist.

359
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:43,540
Push inward and upward.

360
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:44,380
Alright, I'll try.

361
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:45,910
He spat it out.

362
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:48,020
Great, it's out.

363
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:50,910
Call 120 now.

364
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:51,862
Have the hospital check

365
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,299
- whether his oesophagus is scratched.
- Alright.

366
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:54,540
Call me if anything happens.

367
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,900
- Alright, Dr. Gu.
- Bye.

368
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:00,230
Are you mad?

369
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:01,740
Why sneak behind me to scare me?

370
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,020
The Heimlich manoeuvre.

371
00:18:03,430 --> 00:18:05,390
Someone choked on something?

372
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,630
A friend tried biting off
a beer bottle cap

373
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:10,780
and swallowed it.

374
00:18:12,150 --> 00:18:13,500
Your friends are that childish?

375
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:16,940
Except me.

376
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,500
What are you even here for?

377
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:23,100
I booked your slot for tomorrow.

378
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,340
But I couldn't wait.

379
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,940
What now?

380
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:29,190
Something scared me.

381
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:30,910
My appendix cramped a bit.

382
00:18:31,430 --> 00:18:33,500
But your record says your appendix

383
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:35,820
was removed seven or eight years ago.

384
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,390
Why did you memorize my record?

385
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:43,780
Tell me what guilty thing you did.

386
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:46,030
It's your fault.

387
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:48,100
You told me

388
00:18:48,300 --> 00:18:49,870
money can improve relationships.

389
00:19:08,230 --> 00:19:09,950
Mr. Yu Yu told me

390
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,990
you need money lately.

391
00:19:13,190 --> 00:19:15,260
Why would he tell you that?

392
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:16,500
So annoying.

393
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:18,710
He meant well.

394
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:23,020
No. I don't need
his condescending sympathy.

395
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,260
It only makes me feel smaller.

396
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,180
Wait.

397
00:19:27,390 --> 00:19:28,230
Hold on.

398
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,340
Take this.

399
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:35,950
Return them when you can.

400
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,670
No, I don't need them.

401
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:40,740
I've already made up my mind.

402
00:19:41,470 --> 00:19:42,310
Well,

403
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,580
if I can't afford this flat,

404
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:45,780
I'll move.

405
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:47,500
If I can't survive in this city,

406
00:19:47,950 --> 00:19:48,910
I'll leave.

407
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,430
No need to be that grim.

408
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,990
It's called knowing my limit.

409
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:54,060
Are you sure about this?

410
00:19:54,260 --> 00:19:55,100
I'm sure.

411
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:57,580
But I still don't get

412
00:19:57,820 --> 00:20:00,230
why Yu Yu pays 1,000

413
00:20:00,390 --> 00:20:01,740
and mine is 4,000.

414
00:20:01,870 --> 00:20:02,710
What?

415
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
Hello, who's this?

416
00:20:12,630 --> 00:20:14,500
Your neighbour, Yu Yu.

417
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,340
Don't hang up.

418
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:16,950
Or it'll be worse.

419
00:20:17,910 --> 00:20:19,540
What did I do to you now?

420
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,928
I'm already in America.
Why are you still bothering me?

421
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:24,430
I heard you told your niece Xia Xiaoman

422
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,710
to pay your fine.

423
00:20:25,990 --> 00:20:26,830
Right?

424
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,950
What's that got to do with you?

425
00:20:29,300 --> 00:20:30,140
Hmph.

426
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:31,950
You expanded your flat illegally

427
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:33,084
and did random renovations,

428
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,395
which ruined the soundproofing.

429
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,100
You're selfish and inconsiderate.

430
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,262
You even asked the management
to split your fine

431
00:20:38,262 --> 00:20:39,540
and made your niece pay it.

432
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:41,920
Are you even worthy of being an uncle?
Do you have a conscience?

433
00:20:41,920 --> 00:20:43,540
She's out selling beer at night now,

434
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:45,060
hungry and freezing to pay your fine.

435
00:20:45,062 --> 00:20:46,300
Are you worthy of being a man?

436
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,150
I'm warning you.

437
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,670
Carry your own burden.

438
00:20:49,670 --> 00:20:51,230
Or deal with the consequences.

439
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,380
That's it.

440
00:21:00,670 --> 00:21:01,670
My uncle.

441
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,820
He apologized to me.

442
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,780
He said he'd mixed the fine
into the service fee

443
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:11,100
and forgot the installment plan.

444
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:15,230
And he said he paid the fine.

445
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,470
He even paid this year's service fee.

446
00:21:17,630 --> 00:21:18,630
That's great.

447
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,390
Wait...

448
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:21,340
That means

449
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,340
I can keep living here.

450
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:24,660
Congratulations.

451
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:50,910
I still have to put up
with that annoying man.

452
00:21:51,230 --> 00:21:52,390
Annoying is annoying,

453
00:21:53,300 --> 00:21:55,540
but he's a good person.

454
00:21:56,230 --> 00:21:57,910
He gave you the money

455
00:21:57,910 --> 00:21:59,020
because he cares.

456
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,820
But I still think the way he shows care

457
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:02,780
is so awkward.

458
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:03,950
A bit condescending.

459
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:04,820
Quite arrogant.

460
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:06,373
He thinks he's better than everyone.

461
00:22:06,417 --> 00:22:07,540
Arrogant for no reason.

462
00:22:07,540 --> 00:22:08,830
No wonder he can't find a wife.

463
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:10,190
Serves him right to stay single.

464
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,220
Are we being too harsh,

465
00:22:13,220 --> 00:22:14,260
cursing him like this?

466
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:16,140
Not at all.

467
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,670
This is the trouble
he brought on himself.

468
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:21,820
Honestly,

469
00:22:22,060 --> 00:22:24,150
every time I see his icy face,

470
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:25,870
I get a bit nervous.

471
00:22:26,670 --> 00:22:28,260
I just feel like

472
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:29,540
avoiding him.

473
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,950
What's there to be afraid of?

474
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:34,020
Listen, the reason he puts himself

475
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,060
on a pedestal

476
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,230
is because only that way

477
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,820
does he feel safe.

478
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:39,500
In fact,

479
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,100
he's timid inside.

480
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,820
He hides his fear behind arrogance.

481
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:48,740
Listen, next time you see him,

482
00:22:48,773 --> 00:22:50,430
just think of him as a pot of flowers.

483
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:53,260
Or think of him as Dao.

484
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,500
You can even tease him a little.

485
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,260
Wait, hold on.

486
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:40,060
Hey, wait a second.

487
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:43,950
Are you avoiding me?

488
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,300
No.

489
00:23:45,300 --> 00:23:46,300
Then what's wrong?

490
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,190
Nothing.

491
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:48,310
Bye.

492
00:23:50,060 --> 00:23:50,900
Wait.

493
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:52,230
Wait.

494
00:23:55,990 --> 00:23:57,300
My uncle said

495
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,990
you scolded him for twenty minutes.

496
00:23:59,995 --> 00:24:01,570
It was eight minutes and thirty seconds.

497
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,300
To be exact, fifty-four seconds from me,

498
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:06,195
and seven minutes
thirty-six seconds from him.

499
00:24:06,300 --> 00:24:07,230
And I didn't scold him.

500
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:09,910
We had a very deep
and honest conversation.

501
00:24:12,230 --> 00:24:13,070
Thank you.

502
00:24:13,780 --> 00:24:15,740
Without you,
I'd have moved out long ago.

503
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:19,260
Then you'd be free
of your annoying neighbor.

504
00:24:19,390 --> 00:24:20,580
I...

505
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:24,500
Thank you, Mr. Yu.

506
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,100
It's nothing.

507
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,230
See?

508
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:34,150
Much better than throwing money at me.

509
00:24:35,670 --> 00:24:36,870
Scientifically speaking,

510
00:24:37,100 --> 00:24:38,990
everyone is moved by money.

511
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:41,340
Your reaction only shows

512
00:24:42,060 --> 00:24:42,950
I gave too little.

513
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,470
If it hadn't been 12,000...

514
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,540
Stop.

515
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,190
Don't ruin my good impression of you.

516
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:52,500
We'll leave, then.

517
00:25:02,150 --> 00:25:02,990
Come in.

518
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:05,060
Dr. Gu, there's a form

519
00:25:05,128 --> 00:25:06,390
that needs your signature.

520
00:25:10,151 --> 00:25:11,630
You had the day off yesterday?

521
00:25:11,910 --> 00:25:13,980
Yes, I went to Jinxi Ancient Town
with a friend.

522
00:25:13,990 --> 00:25:14,870
Come in.

523
00:25:14,870 --> 00:25:16,230
A short trip, just to unwind.

524
00:25:21,020 --> 00:25:22,230
I'll go.

525
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:29,100
Which bit hurts today,
your heart, liver, spleen,

526
00:25:29,430 --> 00:25:30,270
lungs or kidneys?

527
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,150
First, you're a doctor,

528
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:33,060
don't jinx me.

529
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,500
Second, I'm not ill this time.

530
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,950
That's why I came
during your lunch break.

531
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,740
What is it? Say it.

532
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,470
Well?

533
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,300
(Shanghai International Fireworks)
You're going to watch fireworks?

534
00:25:45,230 --> 00:25:46,470
What are you actually here for?

535
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,020
Xia Xiaoman said

536
00:25:50,390 --> 00:25:51,230
she thanked me.

537
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:53,500
Nice work.

538
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:54,470
I applaud you.

539
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,300
I called her uncle.

540
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:00,190
Turns out he forgot
about the renovation fine.

541
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:03,020
Why was her uncle fined for renovating?

542
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,020
He shaved a 54 cm wall
down by fourteen centimeters

543
00:26:06,190 --> 00:26:07,670
and replaced the soundproof panels.

544
00:26:07,910 --> 00:26:08,950
So the effect got worse.

545
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:14,100
So Xiaoman's crisis is solved.

546
00:26:14,390 --> 00:26:15,300
That's great.

547
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:16,820
Why are you so happy?

548
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:18,260
Her trouble is gone.

549
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,260
Of course, I'm happy.

550
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,020
I've always wondered.

551
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,340
You and Xia Xiaoman

552
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:25,260
are nothing alike in age,

553
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:26,670
vibe or figure.

554
00:26:26,670 --> 00:26:27,910
Why are you two so close?

555
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:30,910
What's strange about us being close?

556
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:33,630
I'm a doctor.

557
00:26:33,870 --> 00:26:35,950
I deal with life and death every day.

558
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:37,190
After work,

559
00:26:37,190 --> 00:26:39,990
I get to see a cheerful, simple girl.

560
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:40,870
It makes me happy

561
00:26:40,870 --> 00:26:41,710
and relaxed.

562
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:44,190
And Xiaoman likes cooking.

563
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:45,580
I like good food.

564
00:26:45,950 --> 00:26:48,100
We can even watch films together.

565
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:49,790
It's great.

566
00:26:51,340 --> 00:26:52,180
I get it.

567
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:54,230
Get what?

568
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,990
You're pretending
to have a girlish heart.

569
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,500
What's wrong with that?

570
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:01,430
Why would I pretend?

571
00:27:01,430 --> 00:27:03,060
- Then, you are pretending.
- Get out.

572
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,900
Bye.

573
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,740
Xiaoxiao, let's go out this weekend.

574
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,260
Where?

575
00:27:14,990 --> 00:27:16,020
Wherever is cheap.

576
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:17,390
Home is the cheapest.

577
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:21,470
Right.

578
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:25,230
Admin says there are
free Happy Valley tickets.

579
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:26,070
Want to go?

580
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:27,300
Why free?

581
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,020
It's been renovated.

582
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,500
The free tickets are a promotion.

583
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:34,990
Free tickets.

584
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:36,190
It'll be packed.

585
00:27:38,190 --> 00:27:39,910
Let's go to Happy Valley this weekend.

586
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:41,100
Okay.

587
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:46,390
You two carry on.

588
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:54,990
Ha.

589
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,100
Ha.

590
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,540
What are you laughing at, Mr. Yu?

591
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,150
The client wants to change the design.

592
00:28:00,150 --> 00:28:02,060
We start on Monday
and they want changes now?

593
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:03,020
Yes.

594
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,240
That's what I'm laughing at.

595
00:28:04,830 --> 00:28:05,690
What do you mean?

596
00:28:05,710 --> 00:28:06,550
Guess.

597
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,580
We have to work this weekend?

598
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:16,390
I don't want to work overtime.

599
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:17,230
Wrong.

600
00:28:17,500 --> 00:28:19,300
You can't handle
this kind of tight deadline.

601
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:21,190
You'd only get in the way.

602
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,060
According to the negative energy theory,

603
00:28:24,060 --> 00:28:25,540
you're a negative element.

604
00:28:26,430 --> 00:28:28,100
He means

605
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,060
you should enjoy your weekend

606
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:32,540
and leave the work to him.

607
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,910
It's his way of caring for you.

608
00:28:34,340 --> 00:28:35,340
Really?

609
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,820
Then why can't he just say it nicely?

610
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:38,990
He's just stubborn.

611
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:51,140
Wait.

612
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:16,390
(Next time you see him,
just treat him like Dao.)

613
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:18,300
(You can even tease him a little.)

614
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:23,670
Mr. Yu.

615
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:27,940
Good evening.

616
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,870
Just finished work?

617
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:33,270
What is it?

618
00:29:33,990 --> 00:29:34,990
Nothing really.

619
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:38,190
I was just being polite
and saying hello.

620
00:29:38,780 --> 00:29:41,060
From now on, whenever I see you,

621
00:29:41,260 --> 00:29:42,580
I'll greet you.

622
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:43,420
Okay?

623
00:29:45,150 --> 00:29:46,020
Oh.

624
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:46,860
Here we are.

625
00:29:47,020 --> 00:29:48,190
Goodnight, Mr. Yu.

626
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:52,390
So strange.

627
00:30:01,580 --> 00:30:02,420
Oh.

628
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,540
Good morning, Mr. Yu.

629
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:06,420
Morning.

630
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:10,260
Working on a Saturday as well?

631
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:12,500
No wonder you're so wealthy.

632
00:30:13,462 --> 00:30:15,260
Even on holidays,
you're out earning money.

633
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,300
Keep it up.

634
00:30:58,706 --> 00:30:59,710
I came to check on you.

635
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:00,820
I'm working.

636
00:31:00,820 --> 00:31:01,870
Just drop it and go.

637
00:31:11,150 --> 00:31:12,230
Some snacks.

638
00:31:16,430 --> 00:31:17,740
Hey, what are you doing?

639
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:18,630
You startled me.

640
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:19,990
A massage gun.

641
00:31:20,390 --> 00:31:22,150
You sit all day and your back aches.

642
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,190
Give it a massage.

643
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:25,260
What?

644
00:31:26,300 --> 00:31:28,060
The pain is in my back.

645
00:31:28,390 --> 00:31:29,630
I can't reach it on my own.

646
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,630
What's the point then?

647
00:31:32,260 --> 00:31:33,540
Then get yourself a girlfriend.

648
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,950
She can help you with it.

649
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,430
You might as well
buy me a massage chair.

650
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,710
Only 18,900 yuan.

651
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:44,150
If you insist on making me buy it,

652
00:31:45,740 --> 00:31:46,910
I still won't.

653
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:54,884
Hey. Good news.

654
00:31:54,951 --> 00:31:57,910
The client said no design changes.
You don't need to work overtime.

655
00:31:57,910 --> 00:31:58,750
What?

656
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,540
What am I supposed to do then?

657
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:02,020
Stare into space?

658
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:04,190
Why don't

659
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,300
you come shooting with me?

660
00:32:06,995 --> 00:32:08,500
Why would I go shooting with you?

661
00:32:08,684 --> 00:32:09,870
Get your little boyfriend to go.

662
00:32:09,870 --> 00:32:11,340
The one born in the Year of the Tiger.

663
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,390
We broke up.

664
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,640
I'm seeing someone
born in the Year of the Rabbit now.

665
00:32:15,390 --> 00:32:17,740
Two years ago, you collected
all twelve star signs.

666
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,950
This year, you're collecting
the zodiac instead?

667
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,740
What's that supposed to mean?

668
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:24,020
What do you mean by "collected"?

669
00:32:24,150 --> 00:32:26,630
I take every relationship seriously.

670
00:32:28,540 --> 00:32:29,500
Anyway,

671
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,500
I want you to get out more.

672
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:33,580
Get some fresh air.

673
00:32:34,430 --> 00:32:37,780
And I need a flourishing money tree.

674
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,100
Design needs creativity.

675
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:40,740
Go find some inspiration.

676
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,150
Here we are. Dinner's ready.

677
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,360
- Tissues.
- Sure.

678
00:32:57,670 --> 00:32:58,510
Mom.

679
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:02,500
I learn a new piece
in my piano class today.

680
00:33:02,500 --> 00:33:03,340
Did you?

681
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:05,100
Any reward for me?

682
00:33:05,260 --> 00:33:06,100
Of course.

683
00:33:06,710 --> 00:33:07,710
Piano class.

684
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,140
Coward.

685
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,630
Shall we go to Happy Valley tomorrow?

686
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:14,150
Yes. I love Happy Valley.

687
00:33:14,740 --> 00:33:15,580
Happy Valley.

688
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,500
Newly renovated and reopened.

689
00:33:17,506 --> 00:33:18,950
They gave out loads of free tickets.

690
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,820
It'll be overflowing with people.

691
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:23,430
You'll queue for fifty minutes
for five minutes of bumper cars.

692
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:25,430
Shall we go for a picnic instead?

693
00:33:25,630 --> 00:33:28,500
Find somewhere quiet
and beautiful and set up a tent.

694
00:33:28,910 --> 00:33:30,910
Fly a kite and fish for a bit.

695
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,070
What do you think, Mom?

696
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,060
That sounds good. Nice idea.

697
00:33:34,990 --> 00:33:36,260
Dao, come with us.

698
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:38,020
What for?

699
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:39,910
Tomorrow, I'm sleeping in.

700
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:41,820
I'll do whatever I want.

701
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:43,300
Eat what I want.

702
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:44,670
Buy what I like.

703
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,430
That's the joy of being single.

704
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,060
Jealous?

705
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:49,710
Jealous.

706
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:51,470
What are you jealous of?

707
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,230
We agreed when we got married

708
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,990
that every weekend,
you'd take the family out.

709
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,100
That's your responsibility as a husband.

710
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,780
Yes.

711
00:34:00,990 --> 00:34:02,390
That's the pain of marriage.

712
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:03,580
Right?

713
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:05,100
Yes.

714
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:08,780
(Happy Valley)

715
00:34:08,790 --> 00:34:10,060
These four tickets are yours.

716
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,220
Do you know why it's four?

717
00:34:12,990 --> 00:34:14,470
Because I figured you wouldn't go.

718
00:34:16,220 --> 00:34:17,470
Then why give them to him?

719
00:34:18,020 --> 00:34:19,310
He can give them to friends.

720
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:21,830
What friends would he have?

721
00:34:22,950 --> 00:34:23,830
Oh. Right.

722
00:34:24,528 --> 00:34:25,710
Then I won't give them to you.

723
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:27,470
I have friends.

724
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,900
Besides,

725
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:30,700
I can go alone four times.

726
00:34:31,180 --> 00:34:32,020
Convinced yet?

727
00:34:34,470 --> 00:34:35,470
You're so free.

728
00:34:42,217 --> 00:34:43,700
How about Happy Valley tomorrow?

729
00:34:43,910 --> 00:34:45,500
They added lots of new rides.

730
00:34:45,700 --> 00:34:47,750
I really think it's a bit pricey.

731
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,580
See you later.

732
00:34:54,140 --> 00:34:55,270
Hello, Mr. Yu.

733
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,380
Hey.

734
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:24,350
Are you going to Happy Valley?

735
00:35:26,950 --> 00:35:28,100
- What?
- Ah?

736
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:29,470
You don't like Happy Valley?

737
00:35:30,060 --> 00:35:32,620
No. It's not about the place.

738
00:35:32,620 --> 00:35:34,350
It's that you suddenly asked me.

739
00:35:34,870 --> 00:35:36,830
We're just neighbors.

740
00:35:36,830 --> 00:35:38,060
Why would I invite you?

741
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:40,140
Then why ask me?

742
00:35:41,140 --> 00:35:43,350
Someone shoved four tickets
into my hand.

743
00:35:43,350 --> 00:35:44,910
It felt wasteful to throw them away.

744
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,500
So I thought I'd give them to you.

745
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,700
You can even sell two.

746
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,990
Buy yourself a soda.

747
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:56,540
See you.

748
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:04,860
(Wooden Coaster)

749
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:10,470
Wait. Xiaoxiao.

750
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,730
A tiny bag like that is useless.
You won't carry it anyway.

751
00:36:13,730 --> 00:36:14,570
What's wrong?

752
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:15,620
Can't you hold it for me?

753
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:18,110
Hey.

754
00:36:18,706 --> 00:36:20,100
Let's take the roller coaster.

755
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,220
I'm not going.

756
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,910
I know this one. It's wooden.

757
00:36:23,910 --> 00:36:25,020
It's terrifying.

758
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,180
It's not scary. It's fun.

759
00:36:26,180 --> 00:36:27,500
I'm not going. You go if you want.

760
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:28,470
Then I'll go myself.

761
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:29,790
Why? You dare to go?

762
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:34,380
Wait...

763
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:35,590
Well...

764
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:37,910
Hi, Xiaoman.

765
00:36:40,470 --> 00:36:41,310
Hey.

766
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:45,100
- Hello.
- What a coincidence.

767
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,020
Such a coincidence.

768
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,350
This is my best friend, Qing.

769
00:36:47,506 --> 00:36:49,500
This is Shen Wu
and his girlfriend, Wang Xiaoxiao.

770
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:50,700
Pleasure to meet you.

771
00:36:50,700 --> 00:36:52,950
Next time, teach me

772
00:36:52,950 --> 00:36:53,830
that coupon trick.

773
00:36:54,430 --> 00:36:55,270
Sure.

774
00:36:55,470 --> 00:36:57,310
No problem. I'll make sure you learn it.

775
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:58,870
Hey.

776
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:01,060
You're here at Happy Valley too?

777
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,180
Company tickets.

778
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,580
They're free. Might as well go.

779
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,140
Oh. Your tickets were from Mr. Yu.

780
00:37:08,750 --> 00:37:10,470
He gave you your tickets?

781
00:37:10,990 --> 00:37:12,870
He handed it to me himself.

782
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:15,350
Amazing.

783
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,620
Impressive.

784
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,100
Are you taking the coaster?

785
00:37:22,220 --> 00:37:23,500
Um. I'm not going.

786
00:37:23,500 --> 00:37:24,350
Come on. Join us.

787
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:25,830
She won't go with me.

788
00:37:25,830 --> 00:37:26,790
Come together.

789
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:33,860
(Shanghai. Kunshan)

790
00:37:57,060 --> 00:37:58,100
Did I scare you?

791
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,020
Why are you here too?

792
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,180
A short trip. Just relaxing.

793
00:38:55,060 --> 00:38:56,060
(Happy Times)
You...

794
00:38:56,350 --> 00:38:57,580
Oh my goodness.

795
00:38:57,790 --> 00:38:59,540
She insisted on riding this one.

796
00:39:00,790 --> 00:39:01,870
Honestly.

797
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:03,790
Here he comes.

798
00:39:05,795 --> 00:39:07,270
Why do you put yourself through this?

799
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,270
Paying to suffer.

800
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:09,990
I didn't pay.

801
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,390
I'm enjoying myself.

802
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:15,430
Take a break.

803
00:39:21,470 --> 00:39:22,470
Where's my shoe?

804
00:39:25,884 --> 00:39:27,310
You're watching this drama too?

805
00:39:28,373 --> 00:39:30,140
I finished all twenty-four episodes.

806
00:39:30,928 --> 00:39:32,140
Which episode are you on?

807
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:33,270
Episode twenty-three.

808
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,110
Oh.

809
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:36,350
The guy dies at the end.

810
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,830
Don't worry.

811
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,040
He comes back in season two.

812
00:39:43,270 --> 00:39:44,180
Hello, everyone.

813
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:47,100
I'm Chunling, your guide
for the Jinxi Ancient Town day tour.

814
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,500
Jinxi Ancient Town

815
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:51,100
is known as the hometown
of China's folk museums.

816
00:39:51,310 --> 00:39:54,620
It preserves many cultural landmarks
and historical sites.

817
00:39:54,790 --> 00:39:58,310
It's a water town in Jiangnan
with two thousand years of history.

818
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:00,940
Excuse me.

819
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:02,100
That's not quite right.

820
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:05,220
As far back as 5,500 years ago
in the Songze era,

821
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,220
the first settlers
were already living in Jinxi.

822
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:08,840
When King Helv of Wu ordered Wu Zixu

823
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,840
to build Suzhou
during the Spring and Autumn period,

824
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,700
this place had already grown
into a market town.

825
00:40:12,706 --> 00:40:14,484
That was about
2,500 years ago, wasn't it?

826
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:17,140
I misspoke.

827
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:18,270
My apologies.

828
00:40:20,430 --> 00:40:22,220
We'll reach Jinjiang Ancient Town soon.

829
00:40:23,790 --> 00:40:25,220
Please take a short break.

830
00:40:26,062 --> 00:40:27,190
Jinjiang Ancient Town?

831
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,506
Isn't it Jinxi Ancient Town?

832
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:30,750
Jinxi Ancient Town.

833
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:34,790
Take a break first.

834
00:40:36,620 --> 00:40:39,390
Mate, you sure know a lot.

835
00:40:39,790 --> 00:40:40,870
How should I address you?

836
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:42,580
My surname is Yu.

837
00:40:42,950 --> 00:40:44,500
He didn't ask for your surname.

838
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,750
Where are you two coming from?

839
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,270
Oh. From Shanghai.

840
00:40:52,470 --> 00:40:54,310
Who's a couple with you?

841
00:40:55,470 --> 00:40:56,870
This answer saves trouble.

842
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,990
Mrs. Yu.

843
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,620
Oh my. You're gorgeous.

844
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,100
I made these sweet potato slices.

845
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,390
They're delicious.

846
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:09,459
They strengthen the body

847
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:10,660
and protect the arteries.

848
00:41:10,660 --> 00:41:11,500
Have some.

849
00:41:12,430 --> 00:41:13,270
Thank you.

850
00:41:13,430 --> 00:41:14,270
You're welcome.

851
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:25,660
It's not just for you.

852
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,310
Morning, Mr. Yu.

853
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:49,310
Well, since when were you
into motorbikes again?

854
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,100
What would you know?

855
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:52,620
This is a Harley.

856
00:41:53,500 --> 00:41:54,430
Men never get over it.

857
00:41:54,660 --> 00:41:57,580
Please. There are plenty of things
you can't get over.

858
00:42:13,390 --> 00:42:14,790
Did you go to Happy Valley?

859
00:42:15,430 --> 00:42:16,270
Yes.

860
00:42:16,395 --> 00:42:17,500
Did you see Xia Xiaoman?

861
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:20,100
Yes. Didn't you give her
the tickets yourself?

862
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:22,020
So you really ran into her.

863
00:42:23,140 --> 00:42:24,140
How was it?

864
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:28,390
Not bad. We spent
the whole afternoon buying shoes.

865
00:42:29,270 --> 00:42:30,110
What?

866
00:42:31,620 --> 00:42:32,700
We all bought some.

867
00:42:32,773 --> 00:42:34,020
We even picked a pair for you.

868
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:35,740
- Here.
- Hey.

869
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,990
Don't ask. I don't want to say anything.

870
00:42:40,540 --> 00:42:42,140
And you? How was your day yesterday?

871
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,551
I don't want to talk about it either.

872
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:57,119
=Why Is He Still Single=
