00:00:00,007 --> 00:00:03,445
(Romy Feerique)

2
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:27,016
Use this color to apply to this area.

3
00:00:28,188 --> 00:00:28,968
How is it?

4
00:00:29,102 --> 00:00:30,438
It's wonderful.

5
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,134
Yes.

6
00:00:31,141 --> 00:00:32,125
Thank you very much.

7
00:01:09,469 --> 00:01:10,727
Thank you very much.

8
00:01:11,297 --> 00:01:12,813
Please come again.

9
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:26,476
Natsume-kun,

10
00:01:26,492 --> 00:01:28,273
are you here to see your mom?

11
00:01:28,687 --> 00:01:29,734
She's currently with

12
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:30,993
a customer over there.

13
00:01:31,018 --> 00:01:32,523
Apply it until it is absorbed

14
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:33,659
into the skin.

15
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:36,047
Umm... No.

16
00:01:36,274 --> 00:01:37,086
Well...

17
00:01:37,961 --> 00:01:39,836
I want to be a BA like you,

18
00:01:39,844 --> 00:01:40,884
Tanouchi-san.

19
00:01:41,618 --> 00:01:44,258
Is it hard being a male BA?

20
00:01:46,235 --> 00:01:47,883
There are challenges,

21
00:01:48,344 --> 00:01:49,867
but it's also very rewarding.

22
00:01:50,391 --> 00:01:52,563
Since you're determined,

23
00:01:52,805 --> 00:01:55,164
Natsume-kun, you'll make a great BA.

24
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:57,586
It would be wonderful if we could

25
00:01:57,611 --> 00:01:59,165
work together someday.

26
00:02:01,946 --> 00:02:04,289
A BA, or Beauty Advisor,

27
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:06,743
is a cosmetics advisor.

28
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:22,539
I'll have this.

29
00:02:22,602 --> 00:02:24,118
Yes. Got it.

30
00:02:24,203 --> 00:02:25,453
Welcome.

31
00:02:27,172 --> 00:02:28,828
I'll try this color for you.

32
00:02:28,844 --> 00:02:30,016
Yes, thank you.

33
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,453
It's not too bright, right?

34
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:35,844
Yes, this one will absorb well

35
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:36,962
into the skin.

36
00:02:36,993 --> 00:02:39,063
I think it suits your skin.

37
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,616
It's a light pink color.

38
00:02:41,617 --> 00:02:44,562
From a beauty advisor,

39
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,671
to skincare advice and

40
00:02:46,688 --> 00:02:47,734
makeup suggestions

41
00:02:47,758 --> 00:02:49,102
for the customer's satisfaction.

42
00:02:49,203 --> 00:02:50,469
Thank you very much.

43
00:02:50,508 --> 00:02:52,328
Please come again.

44
00:02:58,907 --> 00:02:59,884
What do you think?

45
00:03:01,063 --> 00:03:02,164
It's nice!

46
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:03,492
What a relief.

47
00:03:03,602 --> 00:03:05,500
But what to do?

48
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:06,703
I'm also interested in

49
00:03:06,727 --> 00:03:07,969
the lipstick earlier.

50
00:03:08,336 --> 00:03:09,672
Would you like to try

51
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:11,377
that lipstick as well?

52
00:03:12,774 --> 00:03:13,906
I'll bring you a few shades.

53
00:03:13,907 --> 00:03:14,641
Yes.

54
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,649
Natsume-san.

55
00:03:16,532 --> 00:03:18,133
I have selected the lipstick colors that

56
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:20,258
I would like to recommend the customers.

57
00:03:20,586 --> 00:03:21,867
This is the new one that Romy

58
00:03:21,891 --> 00:03:22,812
just released this season.

59
00:03:22,836 --> 00:03:23,594
Please try.

60
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,875
This is my job…

61
00:03:24,891 --> 00:03:25,719
Thank you.

62
00:03:26,282 --> 00:03:27,141
No.

63
00:03:28,961 --> 00:03:30,235
This is our job.

64
00:03:35,571 --> 00:03:36,508
Good work.

65
00:03:38,063 --> 00:03:39,688
That customer earlier

66
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,323
took an hour just to buy one lipstick.

67
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:44,805
It was clear what she wanted to buy.

68
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,516
That's rude.

69
00:03:47,219 --> 00:03:50,642
Kawanishi-sama always carefully
considers her choices.

70
00:03:50,985 --> 00:03:51,672
Huh?

71
00:03:52,383 --> 00:03:53,711
Really?

72
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:55,422
She just wants to be pampered.

73
00:03:56,618 --> 00:03:57,860
Watch your words.

74
00:03:59,743 --> 00:04:00,907
Sahashi Toma.

75
00:04:01,195 --> 00:04:02,633
He used to work as a model.

76
00:04:02,758 --> 00:04:04,633
His only good point is his appearance.

77
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:06,022
A junior who says the opposite

78
00:04:06,047 --> 00:04:07,648
of what's on his mind and doesn't listen.

79
00:04:08,844 --> 00:04:10,078
Seriously, Mamiya-san,

80
00:04:10,094 --> 00:04:11,351
you're way too serious.

81
00:04:11,735 --> 00:04:13,438
Even during breaks, you work.

82
00:04:14,946 --> 00:04:15,891
Seriously, you...

83
00:04:16,696 --> 00:04:17,844
It's only natural to be

84
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,969
serious about work.

85
00:04:20,055 --> 00:04:21,444
Do you know how hard it is

86
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,985
for a male BA to earn customers' trust?

87
00:04:26,563 --> 00:04:27,336
Besides,

88
00:04:27,868 --> 00:04:29,508
you're making good sales.

89
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,109
- If you were more motivated...
- Yeah, yeah, I know.

90
00:04:33,016 --> 00:04:34,187
That's why I don't along

91
00:04:34,204 --> 00:04:35,219
with you, senpai.

92
00:04:36,407 --> 00:04:38,250
You're too meddlesome.

93
00:04:39,454 --> 00:04:40,704
Natsume-san.

94
00:04:41,094 --> 00:04:42,274
You should worry more

95
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:43,539
about yourself than me.

96
00:04:44,391 --> 00:04:45,454
Huh?

97
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:48,610
Currently, you're making sales,

98
00:04:48,969 --> 00:04:50,735
it's not because of trust,

99
00:04:51,563 --> 00:04:53,188
but it's thanks to me.

100
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,211
You know that well.

101
00:05:04,118 --> 00:05:06,477
This guy...

102
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:08,547
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 1)

103
00:06:10,977 --> 00:06:12,243
The cosmetics industry

104
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:14,266
has seen a significant increase

105
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,484
in male staff recently.

106
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,000
Even standing at a counter,

107
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,157
male BAs still stand out.

108
00:06:21,165 --> 00:06:22,687
Taking advantage of the attention,

109
00:06:22,985 --> 00:06:24,118
Sahashi and I

110
00:06:24,571 --> 00:06:26,946
are paired to sell together,

111
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:30,836
in what they call 'crowd pullers'.

112
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,633
Is it for a wedding?

113
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:33,704
Yes,

114
00:06:33,797 --> 00:06:35,547
a friend's from college.

115
00:06:36,071 --> 00:06:37,766
I want to do my makeup myself,

116
00:06:37,798 --> 00:06:39,664
but I'm not very good at it.

117
00:06:40,196 --> 00:06:41,344
So I don't know what to do, yeah?

118
00:06:41,391 --> 00:06:42,227
Yeah.

119
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:44,281
For formal makeup,

120
00:06:44,298 --> 00:06:45,983
Natsume-san is the expert.

121
00:06:46,008 --> 00:06:46,875
Hmm...

122
00:06:48,415 --> 00:06:50,219
Right, Natsume-san?

123
00:06:50,383 --> 00:06:51,235
- Wow!
- Wow!

124
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:52,156
This guy...

125
00:06:52,250 --> 00:06:53,602
Even though he's better at it...

126
00:06:53,657 --> 00:06:55,469
Yes, if you don't mind,

127
00:06:55,508 --> 00:06:57,243
feel free to consult me anytime.

128
00:06:57,407 --> 00:06:59,397
Oh, then please teach me this time.

129
00:06:59,398 --> 00:07:00,688
Me too.

130
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:01,540
Certainly.

131
00:07:04,415 --> 00:07:05,313
It's frustrating.

132
00:07:06,407 --> 00:07:07,211
But...

133
00:07:08,102 --> 00:07:10,133
Sahashi's is really good.

134
00:07:11,243 --> 00:07:12,602
He's a natural talent with

135
00:07:12,618 --> 00:07:13,672
knowledge, skills,

136
00:07:14,727 --> 00:07:16,829
and the ability to attract people.

137
00:07:23,758 --> 00:07:25,344
Thanks for your hard work.

138
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,821
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

139
00:07:27,071 --> 00:07:28,118
Natsume-san,

140
00:07:28,243 --> 00:07:30,211
I'm leaving first.

141
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:32,344
Thanks for your hard work.

142
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:35,055
That's why...

143
00:07:35,766 --> 00:07:37,907
I can't stand his attitude.

144
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:41,649
Thanks for your hard work.

145
00:07:41,657 --> 00:07:42,469
Thanks for your hard work.

146
00:07:42,493 --> 00:07:43,450
Thanks for your hard work.

147
00:07:45,172 --> 00:07:46,157
That guy...

148
00:07:46,836 --> 00:07:47,929
If he could just fix

149
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,045
that arrogant attitude,

150
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:50,297
he'd be an excellent BA.

151
00:07:51,281 --> 00:07:52,937
How can I motivate him?

152
00:07:54,883 --> 00:07:55,891
Natsume-kun,

153
00:07:56,336 --> 00:07:57,477
Thanks for your hard work.

154
00:07:58,180 --> 00:07:59,391
Tanouchi-san?

155
00:07:59,774 --> 00:08:00,836
Thanks for your hard work.

156
00:08:01,672 --> 00:08:02,946
Is the chief here?

157
00:08:03,532 --> 00:08:05,196
He's stepped out for a moment

158
00:08:05,399 --> 00:08:06,704
but should be back soon.

159
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:08,735
Then I'll wait a bit.

160
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,158
Of course. No problem.

161
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,524
Let me see...

162
00:08:13,649 --> 00:08:15,485
Hey, Natsume-kun,

163
00:08:15,547 --> 00:08:16,633
can I tell you something?

164
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,500
Sure.

165
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:19,375
The other day, my daughter...

166
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,063
Ah, how is Yui-chan?

167
00:08:21,094 --> 00:08:21,704
Good.

168
00:08:21,813 --> 00:08:23,320
She drew a picture of me

169
00:08:23,345 --> 00:08:25,040
during art class at daycare.

170
00:08:25,141 --> 00:08:26,586
- Tanouchi-san.
- That's great.

171
00:08:27,117 --> 00:08:29,468
He's in sales now but used to be a BA.

172
00:08:30,016 --> 00:08:30,946
And...

173
00:08:31,516 --> 00:08:32,516
Ever since I was in

174
00:08:32,532 --> 00:08:33,726
elementary school, he's my...

175
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,367
The mouth and the nose are just right.

176
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:39,071
I think she takes after me.

177
00:08:39,071 --> 00:08:40,531
She definitely takes after your wife.

178
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,032
What?

179
00:08:43,438 --> 00:08:44,422
Sorry.

180
00:08:44,446 --> 00:08:45,500
I talked too much.

181
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,883
No, not at all.

182
00:08:47,274 --> 00:08:49,438
So, how are things with you?

183
00:08:49,618 --> 00:08:51,266
Getting along with Sahashi-kun?

184
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:52,750
Ah...

185
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:54,813
Yes. Somehow.

186
00:08:55,477 --> 00:08:56,360
That's good.

187
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:58,102
Using two men as

188
00:08:58,126 --> 00:08:59,719
a strong point in sales,

189
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,235
Chief Harada's strategy is going well.

190
00:09:02,415 --> 00:09:06,313
Customer surveys say it's eye candy.

191
00:09:07,532 --> 00:09:08,336
Thank you.

192
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:10,211
Of course, it's not just

193
00:09:10,219 --> 00:09:11,203
about appearances.

194
00:09:11,227 --> 00:09:13,187
You're both excellent BAs.

195
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:21,023
Sahashi-kun, I thought you went home.

196
00:09:21,048 --> 00:09:22,586
Ah, I forgot something.

197
00:09:23,422 --> 00:09:24,563
If you have anything to ask,

198
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:25,789
feel free to consult me.

199
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:26,860
Yes.

200
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:28,547
Ah, Chief.

201
00:09:28,586 --> 00:09:29,961
Oh, Tanouchi-san.

202
00:09:31,359 --> 00:09:33,149
Natsume-kun, keep up the good work.

203
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,321
I'm counting on you.

204
00:09:34,821 --> 00:09:36,055
Thank you very much.

205
00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:36,821
Yeah.

206
00:09:38,094 --> 00:09:39,391
- Chief.
- Yes?

207
00:09:39,523 --> 00:09:41,147
Regarding this...

208
00:09:41,172 --> 00:09:42,040
Yes.

209
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:48,532
I feel so refreshed.

210
00:09:49,704 --> 00:09:50,860
You said that...

211
00:09:51,258 --> 00:09:52,649
Was that because of Tanouchi-san?

212
00:09:54,805 --> 00:09:55,852
Sahashi?

213
00:09:56,485 --> 00:09:58,195
I thought you left...

214
00:09:58,290 --> 00:10:00,868
I've been thinking for a while...

215
00:10:01,196 --> 00:10:02,399
Natsume-san, you like

216
00:10:02,415 --> 00:10:03,727
Tanochi-san, don't you?

217
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:05,110
Huh?

218
00:10:06,578 --> 00:10:08,336
It's written all over your face.

219
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:09,977
No, it's not like that...

220
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,485
But he's married, right?

221
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:14,797
And he's very fond of his daughter.

222
00:10:22,883 --> 00:10:24,102
Is it unrequited love?

223
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,493
Shut up!

224
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:30,430
He's like that, so what?

225
00:10:38,993 --> 00:10:40,235
You don't want

226
00:10:41,665 --> 00:10:43,500
this to get out, do you?

227
00:10:48,094 --> 00:10:49,922
What are you doing?

228
00:11:01,219 --> 00:11:02,125
Just kidding.

229
00:11:02,656 --> 00:11:04,398
I'll keep your secret.

230
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:08,797
See ya.

231
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,672
What...

232
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:17,742
What the heck was that?

233
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:25,609
Let's start the morning meeting.

234
00:11:25,734 --> 00:11:27,023
- Yes.
- Yes.

235
00:11:31,461 --> 00:11:33,773
Good morning, Natsume-san.

236
00:11:35,328 --> 00:11:36,297
Good morning.

237
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:37,867
This guy...

238
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,109
Seriously,

239
00:11:39,117 --> 00:11:40,741
what on earth is with this guy?

240
00:11:42,437 --> 00:11:44,312
And about the holiday collection

241
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:45,945
announced recently.

242
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:48,312
We will be holding a pre-sale event

243
00:11:48,337 --> 00:11:50,270
to coincide with its release.

244
00:11:50,624 --> 00:11:51,679
We'll select someone from

245
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:52,874
our counter this year?

246
00:11:52,898 --> 00:11:53,617
Yes.

247
00:11:53,789 --> 00:11:55,773
Yes. We'll dispatch one staff member.

248
00:11:56,281 --> 00:11:58,828
Head office staff will also be there,

249
00:11:58,945 --> 00:12:00,273
so if you produce results,

250
00:12:00,298 --> 00:12:02,126
there's a chance to aim higher.

251
00:12:03,172 --> 00:12:04,577
Whoever is dispatched

252
00:12:04,609 --> 00:12:05,843
will be determined based on

253
00:12:05,868 --> 00:12:06,889
overall performance,

254
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:08,781
including sales and customer service.

255
00:12:08,805 --> 00:12:10,570
Everyone, do your best.

256
00:12:10,804 --> 00:12:11,851
- Yes.
- Yes.

257
00:12:15,398 --> 00:12:17,094
This color, yes?

258
00:12:17,344 --> 00:12:18,086
Yes.

259
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:19,194
That's right.

260
00:12:19,562 --> 00:12:20,914
Ah, and...

261
00:12:21,140 --> 00:12:22,158
Oh, do you have the

262
00:12:22,175 --> 00:12:23,601
brochure for the Christmas set?

263
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:24,781
Yes, we do.

264
00:12:25,234 --> 00:12:27,289
I saw the announcement online.

265
00:12:27,383 --> 00:12:28,672
Thank you.

266
00:12:28,719 --> 00:12:30,178
- I'll bring it right away.
- Yes, please.

267
00:12:33,140 --> 00:12:35,055
Among cosmetic brands,

268
00:12:35,242 --> 00:12:36,921
the Christmas season's new releases

269
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,179
are highly competitive,

270
00:12:39,023 --> 00:12:41,750
it's the busiest time for sales staff.

271
00:12:43,555 --> 00:12:46,305
I wonder who'll get to go to the event?

272
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,703
Well, if it's based on sales,

273
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:50,890
it's probably Sahashi-kun, right?

274
00:12:50,914 --> 00:12:52,711
I know, right?

275
00:12:52,906 --> 00:12:54,719
He's got such a great face.

276
00:12:54,773 --> 00:12:56,218
It's understandable why customers

277
00:12:56,234 --> 00:12:57,241
are drawn to him.

278
00:12:57,719 --> 00:13:00,258
But his attitude is a bit...

279
00:13:00,789 --> 00:13:03,305
If he had acted cuter, he'd be perfect.

280
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:05,147
He should take a page

281
00:13:05,172 --> 00:13:06,546
from Mamiya-kun's book.

282
00:13:07,047 --> 00:13:08,429
Huh? Me?

283
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:10,758
Mamiya-san, you are very earnest.

284
00:13:10,820 --> 00:13:12,685
You're even making customer notes

285
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:14,084
yourself right now.

286
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:16,437
It might be Mamiya-kun.

287
00:13:16,773 --> 00:13:17,694
He went last year too.

288
00:13:17,726 --> 00:13:19,046
- Really?
- Yes.

289
00:13:19,203 --> 00:13:20,492
Well, yes.

290
00:13:20,695 --> 00:13:22,719
As expected.

291
00:13:22,851 --> 00:13:24,820
So, Mamiya-san it is then.

292
00:13:24,844 --> 00:13:26,047
No, that's not...

293
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:27,312
You two,

294
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:30,164
stop chatting and get to work.

295
00:13:30,719 --> 00:13:31,617
- Yes.
- Yes.

296
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:37,875
What is this?

297
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,656
Why do I feel so uneasy?

298
00:13:43,265 --> 00:13:45,358
(Locker Room)

299
00:13:45,359 --> 00:13:46,992
Mamiya is fine,

300
00:13:47,344 --> 00:13:48,758
but you, I oppose.

301
00:13:50,656 --> 00:13:52,359
That stings.

302
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:53,992
Huh?

303
00:13:54,719 --> 00:13:56,601
Sahashi and Aizawa-san?

304
00:13:56,890 --> 00:13:59,984
Sure, I might have the best sales,

305
00:14:00,319 --> 00:14:01,694
but it's Natsume-san, right?

306
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,398
He probably wants to go, right?

307
00:14:04,422 --> 00:14:05,679
He'll get promoted too.

308
00:14:07,062 --> 00:14:07,922
Well,

309
00:14:08,164 --> 00:14:09,765
I don't really care either way.

310
00:14:14,922 --> 00:14:15,930
You

311
00:14:16,492 --> 00:14:18,015
think that just because you can

312
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,405
attract customers with your looks,

313
00:14:19,429 --> 00:14:21,211
so you can look down on effort?

314
00:14:22,867 --> 00:14:24,781
I didn't think that at all.

315
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:31,335
What's wrong with

316
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:32,929
using what you have?

317
00:14:36,234 --> 00:14:37,844
Stop it, Sahashi!

318
00:14:38,492 --> 00:14:40,086
I'm sorry, Aizawa-san!

319
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:41,828
He really has a foul mouth.

320
00:14:41,866 --> 00:14:43,662
But Sahashi is...

321
00:14:43,663 --> 00:14:45,007
I'll head back first.

322
00:14:49,984 --> 00:14:50,828
Idiot!

323
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:52,101
Watch what you say!

324
00:14:52,101 --> 00:14:53,781
You didn't have to defend me.

325
00:14:57,086 --> 00:14:59,437
You might get targeted by the sub-chief.

326
00:15:02,765 --> 00:15:04,055
Why...

327
00:15:08,914 --> 00:15:10,609
Why are you always like this?

328
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:14,383
Do you hate this job?

329
00:15:16,819 --> 00:15:18,147
I don't hate it.

330
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:20,070
I just don't care about it.

331
00:15:23,039 --> 00:15:23,898
Then...

332
00:15:25,969 --> 00:15:27,015
What is it that you

333
00:15:27,039 --> 00:15:28,265
can get serious about?

334
00:15:41,851 --> 00:15:43,687
I don't get serious about anything.

335
00:15:46,703 --> 00:15:48,312
Because it's meaningless.

336
00:15:48,562 --> 00:15:49,624
Even if I'm partially invested,

337
00:15:49,633 --> 00:15:50,742
things go well.

338
00:15:51,874 --> 00:15:53,843
Natsume-san, why are you bothering me?

339
00:15:54,945 --> 00:15:56,335
Is it because my sales are better,

340
00:15:56,351 --> 00:15:57,601
and I'm an eyesore?

341
00:15:57,867 --> 00:15:59,250
That's not it!

342
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:01,195
I just...

343
00:16:02,398 --> 00:16:05,117
- think you could do even better.
- None of your business.

344
00:16:06,586 --> 00:16:08,640
I told you to worry about yourself.

345
00:16:11,109 --> 00:16:12,461
Thanks for your hard work.

346
00:16:17,781 --> 00:16:19,172
Why do I meddle?

347
00:16:19,484 --> 00:16:20,281
Why...

348
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:22,617
It's because

349
00:16:22,945 --> 00:16:25,133
I see potential in Sahashi.

350
00:16:32,969 --> 00:16:34,344
Haa...

351
00:16:36,461 --> 00:16:38,695
Dammit.

352
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:41,906
Even though he's skilled,

353
00:16:42,368 --> 00:16:44,434
he acts like he trusts nothing.

354
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:47,156
It's infuriating.

355
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:49,664
But...

356
00:16:50,461 --> 00:16:51,687
Even though he's infuriating,

357
00:16:52,406 --> 00:16:53,882
I can't just ignore him.

358
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,710
It's probably because,

359
00:16:56,914 --> 00:16:58,202
as a fellow male BA,

360
00:16:58,226 --> 00:16:59,616
I can't give up on him.

361
00:17:06,327 --> 00:17:07,765
(Romy Feerique Holiday Collection)

362
00:17:07,765 --> 00:17:09,178
If he gets to learn in a place

363
00:17:09,203 --> 00:17:10,686
where excellent BAs gather,

364
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,883
maybe he'll change a bit...

365
00:17:18,555 --> 00:17:19,258
Huh?

366
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:20,797
Me?

367
00:17:22,008 --> 00:17:23,484
You consistently make sales and

368
00:17:23,492 --> 00:17:25,170
provides excellent customer service.

369
00:17:25,195 --> 00:17:26,351
And above all,

370
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,508
we evaluate your attitude towards work.

371
00:17:29,703 --> 00:17:30,656
How about it?

372
00:17:31,023 --> 00:17:32,273
Can I count on you?

373
00:17:33,742 --> 00:17:34,773
I'm honored.

374
00:17:37,031 --> 00:17:37,890
But,

375
00:17:39,289 --> 00:17:40,680
Chief...

376
00:17:41,633 --> 00:17:42,976
This event,

377
00:17:43,367 --> 00:17:44,570
can I suggest sending

378
00:17:44,595 --> 00:17:46,048
Sahashi instead of me?

379
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:47,937
Why?

380
00:17:48,687 --> 00:17:50,984
I think he's more suitable than I am.

381
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,648
Sahashi

382
00:17:53,914 --> 00:17:55,640
has the ability and the sense.

383
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:57,572
With the right opportunity,

384
00:17:57,588 --> 00:17:59,275
I believe he can achieve more.

385
00:17:59,609 --> 00:18:00,531
Are you sure?

386
00:18:00,820 --> 00:18:02,353
Giving up your chance over to him?

387
00:18:02,586 --> 00:18:03,617
It's fine.

388
00:18:04,617 --> 00:18:07,680
I believe he deserves it.

389
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,617
Understood.

390
00:18:14,164 --> 00:18:16,640
Let's send Sahashi-kun this time.

391
00:18:17,945 --> 00:18:18,969
Honestly,

392
00:18:19,289 --> 00:18:22,445
I suspected you might say that.

393
00:18:23,359 --> 00:18:23,961
Huh?

394
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,398
For someone as dedicated

395
00:18:25,414 --> 00:18:26,647
to their work as you are

396
00:18:26,671 --> 00:18:28,397
to think so highly of him,

397
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:30,351
I...

398
00:18:31,125 --> 00:18:32,179
It makes me want to give

399
00:18:32,204 --> 00:18:33,312
Sahashi-kun a chance too.

400
00:18:36,242 --> 00:18:37,695
Thank you very much!

401
00:18:45,086 --> 00:18:46,023
Excuse me.

402
00:18:48,344 --> 00:18:49,515
Natsume-san.

403
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:51,148
Sahashi?

404
00:18:52,586 --> 00:18:54,578
You're too meddlesome. It's off-putting.

405
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:56,828
You heard?

406
00:18:57,273 --> 00:18:58,586
You're too nice.

407
00:18:58,984 --> 00:19:00,117
It's not like that...

408
00:19:00,172 --> 00:19:02,305
Giving a chance to your junior?

409
00:19:03,547 --> 00:19:04,820
Normally, you'd trip up the guy

410
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:05,945
who's only getting sales

411
00:19:05,961 --> 00:19:06,984
because of his face.

412
00:19:07,562 --> 00:19:08,429
Huh?

413
00:19:08,890 --> 00:19:10,203
What are you talking about?

414
00:19:12,953 --> 00:19:14,367
To be honest,

415
00:19:14,922 --> 00:19:16,429
it's not just your face, you know.

416
00:19:17,914 --> 00:19:18,820
I have

417
00:19:19,844 --> 00:19:22,094
recognized your ability for a long time.

418
00:19:28,508 --> 00:19:30,195
You're quick with touch-ups.

419
00:19:32,078 --> 00:19:33,804
Your extensive product knowledge

420
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,469
is proof of your effort.

421
00:19:37,945 --> 00:19:40,117
I don't know why you're so twisted,

422
00:19:42,562 --> 00:19:43,375
But I...

423
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,500
have never lied to you about work.

424
00:19:49,476 --> 00:19:51,156
You really are excellent.

425
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:56,898
That's why

426
00:19:57,750 --> 00:20:01,273
I want you to aim higher.

427
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:04,695
Even if it frustrates me.

428
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,117
What's so funny?

429
00:20:13,430 --> 00:20:14,336
It's nothing.

430
00:20:15,555 --> 00:20:17,383
I just think you're amazing.

431
00:20:18,047 --> 00:20:19,952
Are you making fun of me?

432
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:24,101
Oh,

433
00:20:24,547 --> 00:20:26,094
what are you two doing?

434
00:20:28,047 --> 00:20:29,172
Just in time,

435
00:20:29,758 --> 00:20:31,742
Sahashi-kun, I need to talk to you.

436
00:20:34,047 --> 00:20:34,758
Yes,

437
00:20:37,156 --> 00:20:38,055
In the end,

438
00:20:38,344 --> 00:20:40,273
Sahashi was chosen for the event.

439
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:41,850
After that,

440
00:20:42,133 --> 00:20:44,937
when the one-week event period ended...

441
00:20:47,758 --> 00:20:48,851
He returned looking as if

442
00:20:48,867 --> 00:20:50,265
nothing had happened.

443
00:20:50,289 --> 00:20:51,601
Thank you.

444
00:20:51,773 --> 00:20:53,109
Please come again.

445
00:20:57,867 --> 00:20:59,281
Thank you very much.

446
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,515
Well, I'm off now.

447
00:21:06,656 --> 00:21:07,765
Thanks for your hard work.

448
00:21:08,086 --> 00:21:08,851
Ah...

449
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:09,930
Yeah.

450
00:21:10,406 --> 00:21:11,289
Good work.

451
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:13,430
That guy...

452
00:21:14,234 --> 00:21:15,930
Did he not change at all?

453
00:21:24,594 --> 00:21:26,515
Hey, where's Sahashi-kun?

454
00:21:27,523 --> 00:21:29,094
Oh, he just left.

455
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:30,047
Really?

456
00:21:30,297 --> 00:21:31,351
I wanted to tell him

457
00:21:31,367 --> 00:21:32,609
something right away.

458
00:21:32,633 --> 00:21:33,945
Did something happen?

459
00:21:38,015 --> 00:21:38,937
Seriously?

460
00:21:39,062 --> 00:21:40,555
That Sahashi got...

461
00:21:41,164 --> 00:21:43,531
That guy really...

462
00:21:57,469 --> 00:22:00,460
(Sahashi Toma)

463
00:22:02,617 --> 00:22:04,484
Whoa! Wait, wait!

464
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,914
Natsume-san.

465
00:22:06,851 --> 00:22:07,945
Sahashi!

466
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:10,500
What are you doing here?

467
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:11,773
I was waiting for you.

468
00:22:12,672 --> 00:22:13,734
Waiting?

469
00:22:15,101 --> 00:22:16,797
Did you hear the sales report?

470
00:22:17,234 --> 00:22:19,624
You were amazing, first place!

471
00:22:20,140 --> 00:22:21,797
Among all those elite sellers,

472
00:22:21,813 --> 00:22:23,493
and you're a newcomer!

473
00:22:23,851 --> 00:22:26,031
Of course. I worked hard.

474
00:22:27,164 --> 00:22:28,515
What made you switch gears?

475
00:22:28,750 --> 00:22:29,828
What motivated you?

476
00:22:31,055 --> 00:22:33,070
Oh, something happened at the event?

477
00:22:34,680 --> 00:22:36,719
It was Natsume-san who motivated me.

478
00:22:37,226 --> 00:22:37,812
Huh?

479
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,383
What did you say?

480
00:22:40,062 --> 00:22:41,312
Hey, Natsume-san,

481
00:22:41,601 --> 00:22:43,508
I want a reward.

482
00:22:45,453 --> 00:22:46,172
Sure,

483
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:48,343
a meal or anything you want...

484
00:22:49,046 --> 00:22:50,226
That's not what I mean.

485
00:23:15,742 --> 00:23:16,453
You...

486
00:23:17,305 --> 00:23:18,578
What did you just do?

487
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:21,062
Let go!

488
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,508
Natsume-san,

489
00:23:23,992 --> 00:23:25,726
you asked me before.

490
00:23:27,289 --> 00:23:28,453
What is it that you can

491
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:29,492
get serious about?

492
00:23:39,383 --> 00:23:40,039
I...

493
00:23:41,906 --> 00:23:42,991
Can I get serious about you,

494
00:23:43,008 --> 00:23:44,008
Natsume-san?

495
00:23:59,195 --> 00:24:01,202
(Next episode)
Do you really like him?

496
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:02,414
As long as Tanouchi-san's happy,

497
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:03,163
that's enough.

498
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:04,555
You are surprisingly cowardly.

499
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:05,937
You moved here because there was

500
00:24:05,962 --> 00:24:07,156
a problem at the Shinjuku branch

501
00:24:07,164 --> 00:24:08,101
four years ago, right?

502
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,531
So, don't run away from me.

503
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,187
You're unfair.

504
00:24:11,234 --> 00:24:12,913
They know everything, right?

505
00:24:13,469 --> 00:24:15,414
I'll look into everything about you.

506
00:24:15,414 --> 00:24:16,390
(This is a work of fiction)
