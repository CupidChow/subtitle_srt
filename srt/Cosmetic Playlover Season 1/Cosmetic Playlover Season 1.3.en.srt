1
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:26,047
Here, take these instead.

2
00:00:26,586 --> 00:00:30,031
Wear them and remember who you belong to.

3
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:36,813
Huh?

4
00:00:37,047 --> 00:00:37,828
Wait,

5
00:00:39,297 --> 00:00:41,320
if I wear these does that mean I'm...

6
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,820
I...

7
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:50,711
Good morning, Natsume-san.

8
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,258
Good morning.

9
00:00:55,141 --> 00:00:56,391
They look good on you.

10
00:00:59,688 --> 00:01:00,570
Does this mean...

11
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:03,870
we're actually dating!?

12
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:05,976
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 3)

13
00:02:07,664 --> 00:02:09,656
She's really beautiful.

14
00:02:09,797 --> 00:02:11,703
Yumihara Risa-san, our new muse.

15
00:02:12,164 --> 00:02:12,914
Yes,

16
00:02:13,055 --> 00:02:16,000
she's the top supermodel right now.

17
00:02:17,148 --> 00:02:17,758
Oh,

18
00:02:18,094 --> 00:02:18,938
right.

19
00:02:19,758 --> 00:02:20,531
Sahashi,

20
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,859
Chief asked me to give you

21
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,547
a new business card.

22
00:02:25,109 --> 00:02:25,836
Please.

23
00:02:25,977 --> 00:02:26,766
Ah,

24
00:02:27,281 --> 00:02:28,742
thank you.

25
00:02:29,695 --> 00:02:30,383
A business card?

26
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,554
I got new ones.

27
00:02:33,297 --> 00:02:35,094
Here, Natsume-san.

28
00:02:37,805 --> 00:02:38,492
You...

29
00:02:38,883 --> 00:02:40,578
You became a Makeup Expert?

30
00:02:40,578 --> 00:02:41,352
(Makeup Expert
Sahashi Toma)

31
00:02:41,352 --> 00:02:42,500
After the success of

32
00:02:42,516 --> 00:02:43,789
the holiday collection event

33
00:02:43,805 --> 00:02:45,078
you let me handle,

34
00:02:45,102 --> 00:02:47,445
the Chief recommended me.

35
00:02:47,609 --> 00:02:49,063
When did you...

36
00:02:49,086 --> 00:02:49,828
Alright,

37
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:51,391
you two, it's opening time.

38
00:02:51,984 --> 00:02:52,586
Yes.

39
00:03:00,578 --> 00:03:02,617
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

40
00:03:03,031 --> 00:03:04,289
This way please.

41
00:03:04,938 --> 00:03:06,758
Sahashi is incredible.

42
00:03:07,414 --> 00:03:09,312
- To become a Makeup Expert,
- Welcome.

43
00:03:09,437 --> 00:03:10,624
you need to pass a special

44
00:03:10,648 --> 00:03:12,101
internal qualification course.

45
00:03:12,328 --> 00:03:13,828
Yet, he never shows any sign

46
00:03:13,853 --> 00:03:15,533
of the effort he puts in.

47
00:03:19,094 --> 00:03:20,313
Thank you very much.

48
00:03:22,196 --> 00:03:22,907
Welcome...

49
00:03:24,482 --> 00:03:25,193
Huh?

50
00:03:25,781 --> 00:03:26,977
Yumihara Risa?

51
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:28,813
Ah,

52
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:30,297
there you are.

53
00:03:31,273 --> 00:03:32,991
Toma, long time no see.

54
00:03:33,055 --> 00:03:33,891
Risako.

55
00:03:35,031 --> 00:03:38,141
So it's true you're working as a BA here.

56
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:39,234
Should a top model be

57
00:03:39,258 --> 00:03:40,435
wandering around like this?

58
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:42,010
- I ditched my manager to come here!
- The real one?

59
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:42,687
Why?

60
00:03:42,688 --> 00:03:43,938
Ah. Got a business card?

61
00:03:43,984 --> 00:03:44,749
Yeah.

62
00:03:45,727 --> 00:03:48,290
What's her relationship with Sahashi?

63
00:03:49,501 --> 00:03:51,586
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much.

64
00:03:54,407 --> 00:03:57,415
Why didn't you tell me you knew the muse?

65
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,501
Are you talking about Risako?

66
00:03:59,938 --> 00:04:02,313
We were just colleagues back in the day.

67
00:04:02,446 --> 00:04:03,915
Didn't think I need to mention it.

68
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:05,766
Maybe, but still...

69
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:06,805
But...

70
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,172
I call her Risako because

71
00:04:09,274 --> 00:04:10,477
she used her real name

72
00:04:10,485 --> 00:04:11,833
when she started working.

73
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:13,383
That's not what I asked!

74
00:04:13,782 --> 00:04:14,743
Are you jealous?

75
00:04:15,188 --> 00:04:16,977
Huh? Why would I be?

76
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:18,649
Damn,

77
00:04:19,071 --> 00:04:21,070
why does this make me so uneasy...

78
00:04:21,477 --> 00:04:22,688
Good job.

79
00:04:23,352 --> 00:04:24,446
Good job.

80
00:04:25,032 --> 00:04:26,118
Sahashi-kun.

81
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,055
The head office called for you.

82
00:04:29,547 --> 00:04:30,726
About the PR event for

83
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:31,960
the Spring Collection

84
00:04:31,984 --> 00:04:33,408
starting next month.

85
00:04:33,672 --> 00:04:36,352
Yumihara-san, our muse, will be the model,

86
00:04:36,492 --> 00:04:38,438
touring department stores nationwide

87
00:04:38,446 --> 00:04:39,886
for makeup shows.

88
00:04:40,415 --> 00:04:42,125
Sahashi-kun, you've been chosen

89
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,891
as the makeup artist for the event.

90
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:52,414
Will you take on the challenge?

91
00:04:54,469 --> 00:04:56,266
Yes, I will.

92
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:02,711
Sahashi will be away from

93
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,399
our store for two months.

94
00:05:05,969 --> 00:05:06,758
Plus...

95
00:05:07,977 --> 00:05:09,586
he'll be working with Yumihara Risa.

96
00:05:15,657 --> 00:05:16,743
Natsume-san.

97
00:05:16,774 --> 00:05:18,344
Don't cry because I'll be gone

98
00:05:18,369 --> 00:05:19,860
starting tomorrow.

99
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,282
I won't, idiot.

100
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,680
But your face

101
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,344
shows everything.

102
00:05:24,797 --> 00:05:25,672
No, it doesn't!

103
00:05:26,024 --> 00:05:27,836
Ah, there you are.

104
00:05:28,508 --> 00:05:30,180
Oh? Am I interrupting?

105
00:05:32,649 --> 00:05:33,641
Nice to meet you!

106
00:05:33,689 --> 00:05:35,298
I'm Nanjo Atsushi.

107
00:05:35,571 --> 00:05:36,938
Didn't Chief tell you?

108
00:05:37,172 --> 00:05:38,422
I'll be the new makeup artist

109
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:39,570
starting tomorrow.

110
00:05:39,876 --> 00:05:41,719
Just came to say hi.

111
00:05:42,071 --> 00:05:42,867
Ah...

112
00:05:42,984 --> 00:05:44,086
Ah, right!

113
00:05:44,196 --> 00:05:45,774
I'm Mamiya. Nice to meet you.

114
00:05:45,799 --> 00:05:48,656
I know you guys, Yurakucho's twin princes.

115
00:05:48,883 --> 00:05:50,493
And you must be Sahashi-kun?

116
00:05:50,649 --> 00:05:52,422
You're amazing!

117
00:05:52,438 --> 00:05:53,367
Getting a direct request

118
00:05:53,376 --> 00:05:54,391
from the muse herself!

119
00:05:54,415 --> 00:05:56,070
Overlooking makeup artists like us,

120
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,352
people are wondering what kind

121
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,406
of person you are.

122
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,391
Thanks.

123
00:05:59,829 --> 00:06:01,040
By the way,

124
00:06:01,655 --> 00:06:03,319
are you two dating?

125
00:06:03,344 --> 00:06:03,992
Huh?

126
00:06:04,196 --> 00:06:05,141
Huh? No...

127
00:06:05,313 --> 00:06:06,274
It's not like that between us...

128
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:07,586
Really?

129
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,452
You seemed pretty cozy just now,

130
00:06:09,477 --> 00:06:11,102
who would have thought you were friends.

131
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:13,032
I like men, you see.

132
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:15,680
I used to hide it when I first joined,

133
00:06:15,829 --> 00:06:17,751
but I'm no good at hiding.

134
00:06:19,688 --> 00:06:23,586
Sahashi-kun, you're really handsome,

135
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,188
but...

136
00:06:26,954 --> 00:06:29,126
Mamiya-kun is my type.

137
00:06:29,907 --> 00:06:30,618
Huh?

138
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:32,415
You're cute.

139
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:36,915
What? Are you guys actually dating?

140
00:06:37,321 --> 00:06:38,680
Sorry about that,

141
00:06:38,704 --> 00:06:40,063
i didn't mean to upset you.

142
00:06:40,618 --> 00:06:41,922
Well, regardless,

143
00:06:41,947 --> 00:06:42,892
for the next two months,

144
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:43,834
I'll be taking over.

145
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:45,335
Nanjo-san, right?

146
00:06:45,719 --> 00:06:46,571
Hmm?

147
00:06:47,844 --> 00:06:48,672
Huh?

148
00:06:54,501 --> 00:06:55,696
Natsume-san,

149
00:06:56,711 --> 00:06:58,258
those earrings really suit you.

150
00:06:59,907 --> 00:07:00,751
If anything happens,

151
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,735
contact me right away.

152
00:07:07,845 --> 00:07:08,759
Nanjo-san.

153
00:07:08,853 --> 00:07:09,821
Hmm?

154
00:07:10,415 --> 00:07:11,454
Looking forward

155
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:13,728
to working with you.

156
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:16,173
No need to be that polite.

157
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,275
Likewise.

158
00:07:23,618 --> 00:07:24,775
Sahashi,

159
00:07:24,946 --> 00:07:26,490
you need to go to the main office soon.

160
00:07:28,084 --> 00:07:29,329
I know.

161
00:07:31,126 --> 00:07:32,001
See you.

162
00:07:38,314 --> 00:07:39,501
Hmm?

163
00:07:39,556 --> 00:07:41,165
So, he gave you those earrings, huh?

164
00:07:41,236 --> 00:07:42,032
Huh?

165
00:07:42,814 --> 00:07:43,814
Ah...

166
00:07:44,032 --> 00:07:44,782
Well...

167
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:49,173
Looks so tempting.

168
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:52,687
I don't make it a habit

169
00:07:52,695 --> 00:07:54,429
to steal others' partners,

170
00:07:55,587 --> 00:07:58,079
but it's true that you're really my type.

171
00:07:59,626 --> 00:08:00,439
Huh?

172
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:03,517
See you around.

173
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:18,196
Since then,

174
00:08:18,423 --> 00:08:20,900
the events featuring Sahashi have started.

175
00:08:21,547 --> 00:08:24,094
And our store got Nanjo-san.

176
00:08:24,119 --> 00:08:25,290
To make the rosy color

177
00:08:25,315 --> 00:08:26,361
on the cheeks more visible,

178
00:08:26,386 --> 00:08:27,558
I added some blush here

179
00:08:27,583 --> 00:08:28,652
to make it look sexy as if

180
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:29,591
you just finished taking a bath.

181
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:31,274
Getting makeup done by you

182
00:08:31,275 --> 00:08:32,306
lifts my spirits.

183
00:08:32,368 --> 00:08:33,212
Really?

184
00:08:33,275 --> 00:08:34,110
Thank you very much.

185
00:08:34,235 --> 00:08:36,602
Despite his easy going personality,

186
00:08:36,611 --> 00:08:38,486
- Nanjo-san's makeup is
- I'll take this then.

187
00:08:38,837 --> 00:08:40,689
delicate and refreshing.

188
00:08:40,837 --> 00:08:42,657
Can you put this away, please?

189
00:08:42,673 --> 00:08:43,431
Sure.

190
00:08:44,736 --> 00:08:46,540
It'll definitely suit you.

191
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:48,400
This color is cute.

192
00:08:50,478 --> 00:08:54,790
(Romy Feerique thanked everyone
who came to the Kyoto branch)

193
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:03,149
(Both of them are ready for the 3pm
round at the Fukuoka branch)

194
00:09:07,353 --> 00:09:09,282
Looks like they're having fun.

195
00:09:09,993 --> 00:09:11,602
Sahashi-kun seems to be

196
00:09:11,618 --> 00:09:13,418
a hit at events everywhere.

197
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:14,946
Yes.

198
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:16,861
Hey.

199
00:09:18,861 --> 00:09:20,611
What do you like about Sahashi-kun?

200
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:22,550
No.

201
00:09:22,650 --> 00:09:23,490
We're not like that...

202
00:09:23,532 --> 00:09:24,743
Oh, come on.

203
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:26,570
You shouldn't deny it so strongly.

204
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,735
If you denied it like that,

205
00:09:27,751 --> 00:09:28,860
he'd seem pitiful.

206
00:09:28,884 --> 00:09:30,923
Hasn't he told you he likes you?

207
00:09:31,782 --> 00:09:32,814
That...

208
00:09:33,696 --> 00:09:34,407
Wait.

209
00:09:35,297 --> 00:09:36,961
That guy hasn't even told me

210
00:09:36,977 --> 00:09:38,257
he likes me yet.

211
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,532
What's up?

212
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,829
No, it's nothing.

213
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:46,961
But what will Sahashi-kun do

214
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:48,186
in the future?

215
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:50,486
What do you mean?

216
00:09:50,618 --> 00:09:53,453
Sahashi-kun likes girls too, right?

217
00:09:54,548 --> 00:09:57,087
Even now, those two are still together.

218
00:10:01,118 --> 00:10:02,625
If it was me, I wouldn't make

219
00:10:02,650 --> 00:10:04,016
you feel insecure.

220
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:08,486
That is...

221
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,892
Just kidding.

222
00:10:12,251 --> 00:10:13,735
But if you don't stand firm,

223
00:10:13,767 --> 00:10:15,233
someone like me will take advantage.

224
00:10:15,258 --> 00:10:16,258
Be careful.

225
00:10:18,025 --> 00:10:19,165
See you later.

226
00:10:20,978 --> 00:10:22,118
Thanks for your hard work.

227
00:10:23,962 --> 00:10:24,829
I'm not

228
00:10:25,384 --> 00:10:27,673
doubting Sahashi's feelings.

229
00:10:28,954 --> 00:10:29,814
I just...

230
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:32,071
don't know how to handle them...

231
00:10:33,048 --> 00:10:34,040
If I gather my courage

232
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,337
and say that I love that guy,

233
00:10:36,907 --> 00:10:38,400
will anything change?

234
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:41,829
But what do lovers do?

235
00:10:43,861 --> 00:10:44,704
By the way,

236
00:10:45,337 --> 00:10:47,267
he hasn't even said he likes me.

237
00:10:52,043 --> 00:10:54,922
(Sahashi Toma)

238
00:10:54,923 --> 00:10:56,829
Maybe if we were lovers,

239
00:10:57,508 --> 00:10:58,900
in times like these...

240
00:11:08,564 --> 00:11:10,150
Hello, Natsume-san?

241
00:11:11,688 --> 00:11:12,523
Sahashi.

242
00:11:12,634 --> 00:11:13,516
What's up?

243
00:11:13,821 --> 00:11:15,571
Did Nanjo do something to you?

244
00:11:16,423 --> 00:11:17,626
No.

245
00:11:18,705 --> 00:11:19,502
Umm...

246
00:11:19,853 --> 00:11:21,282
Now, you...

247
00:11:21,486 --> 00:11:22,509
I'm in Nagoya.

248
00:11:22,876 --> 00:11:24,407
I'll be here tomorrow too,

249
00:11:24,486 --> 00:11:26,196
so I'm at the hotel after work.

250
00:11:27,095 --> 00:11:29,228
Just hearing his voice

251
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:31,595
makes me feel so relieved.

252
00:11:32,986 --> 00:11:34,032
I'm happy that

253
00:11:34,321 --> 00:11:36,025
you called, Natsume-san.

254
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:37,564
Oh no.

255
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,478
Hearing this

256
00:11:40,236 --> 00:11:41,751
makes me want to be spoiled.

257
00:11:42,173 --> 00:11:43,212
Natsume-san?

258
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:45,891
I don't know what it means

259
00:11:45,907 --> 00:11:47,024
to act like lovers.

260
00:11:47,571 --> 00:11:48,337
But

261
00:11:49,439 --> 00:11:51,618
saying that I feel uncomfortable...

262
00:11:51,993 --> 00:11:52,829
Hey.

263
00:11:53,219 --> 00:11:53,837
Sahashi...

264
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,220
Toma!

265
00:11:55,664 --> 00:11:56,773
Can you turn on the hot water yet?

266
00:11:56,798 --> 00:11:57,915
Ah, Risako,

267
00:11:58,048 --> 00:11:59,025
wait a moment.

268
00:11:59,892 --> 00:12:00,985
Natsume-san, sorry.

269
00:12:01,165 --> 00:12:02,478
I'll call you back later.

270
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,329
No, it's okay.

271
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:06,821
Sorry for bothering while you're busy.

272
00:12:07,189 --> 00:12:08,470
Good luck with the event!

273
00:12:09,243 --> 00:12:09,978
Bye!

274
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:14,853
Why was he with her?

275
00:12:17,165 --> 00:12:18,603
I was so happy just to call him.

276
00:12:20,704 --> 00:12:21,603
I...

277
00:12:22,173 --> 00:12:23,642
really am pathetic.

278
00:12:27,775 --> 00:12:28,868
What an idiot I am.

279
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:45,181
Mamiya-kun, you don't look lively.

280
00:12:45,853 --> 00:12:46,938
No, it's nothing.

281
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:47,759
Come on,

282
00:12:48,024 --> 00:12:50,407
I know you smile for the customers,

283
00:12:50,595 --> 00:12:52,431
but you can't fool me.

284
00:12:54,877 --> 00:12:56,619
Hey, why don't you come over tonight?

285
00:12:56,673 --> 00:12:57,322
Huh?

286
00:12:57,619 --> 00:12:59,486
I won't do anything weird,

287
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:00,423
I promise!

288
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:02,228
No.

289
00:13:02,884 --> 00:13:05,416
I just got back from training in Paris.

290
00:13:05,978 --> 00:13:07,000
I've got some products for

291
00:13:07,025 --> 00:13:08,085
next year's new releases.

292
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,055
Not interested?

293
00:13:09,297 --> 00:13:10,009
Huh?

294
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,672
There's also stuff you can

295
00:13:11,697 --> 00:13:12,820
only get over there.

296
00:13:13,705 --> 00:13:14,486
Hmm?

297
00:13:16,127 --> 00:13:17,517
Toma!

298
00:13:17,961 --> 00:13:19,141
Can you turn on the hot water yet?

299
00:13:19,142 --> 00:13:20,392
Ah, Risako,

300
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,408
wait a moment.

301
00:13:24,088 --> 00:13:25,119
I'll go.

302
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,283
Great, it's settled!

303
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,170
Wow!

304
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:41,295
(Romy Feerique)
Amazing!

305
00:13:41,678 --> 00:13:43,271
Feel free to touch anything.

306
00:13:43,717 --> 00:13:44,787
Here is the information.

307
00:13:44,842 --> 00:13:46,560
Ah, thank you.

308
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:48,654
The limited overseas products,

309
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:49,935
I often can't answer questions

310
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:51,787
about the texture to the customers.

311
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:53,771
You've cheered up.

312
00:13:54,334 --> 00:13:56,256
You really love your work, don't you?

313
00:13:56,795 --> 00:13:57,537
Huh?

314
00:13:57,756 --> 00:13:59,412
Your customer service is meticulous,

315
00:13:59,584 --> 00:14:01,099
and you're trusted by colleagues

316
00:14:01,115 --> 00:14:02,235
and regulars.

317
00:14:02,865 --> 00:14:04,795
Plus, you seem to enjoy your work.

318
00:14:07,029 --> 00:14:08,209
So,

319
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,786
I find it even stranger about Sahashi-kun.

320
00:14:11,928 --> 00:14:14,037
What's wrong with Sahashi?

321
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:17,428
Did you guys have a fight?

322
00:14:18,310 --> 00:14:19,318
It's not like that...

323
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,396
Well, both of you are talented,

324
00:14:22,755 --> 00:14:24,160
but I heard Sahashi-kun's attitude

325
00:14:24,185 --> 00:14:25,865
was problematic before.

326
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:28,553
It's true

327
00:14:30,185 --> 00:14:31,958
I've gotten mad and scolded him for

328
00:14:31,983 --> 00:14:33,663
looking down on his job.

329
00:14:36,006 --> 00:14:36,818
But...

330
00:14:37,326 --> 00:14:38,709
Sahashi is amazing.

331
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:41,006
He's often misunderstood,

332
00:14:41,318 --> 00:14:42,701
but he works hard,

333
00:14:45,154 --> 00:14:47,428
and his attitude has improved.

334
00:14:49,006 --> 00:14:51,685
As much as I feel frustrated as his senpai,

335
00:14:53,271 --> 00:14:54,998
I'm equally proud of him as a junior.

336
00:14:56,998 --> 00:14:57,982
Plus,

337
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,169
once I understand him,

338
00:15:00,194 --> 00:15:01,874
I think he's reliable

339
00:15:02,717 --> 00:15:04,373
more than people realize.

340
00:15:07,607 --> 00:15:09,709
You really like him, don't you?

341
00:15:09,834 --> 00:15:10,443
Huh?

342
00:15:10,553 --> 00:15:12,623
You made my heart race.

343
00:15:14,342 --> 00:15:15,763
You thought about him that much,

344
00:15:15,818 --> 00:15:17,505
but he's cruel to make you feel uneasy.

345
00:15:17,506 --> 00:15:18,795
That's not what I meant...

346
00:15:18,796 --> 00:15:20,076
It's okay, it's okay.

347
00:15:20,571 --> 00:15:21,782
I get it.

348
00:15:21,853 --> 00:15:23,790
You really love Sahashi-kun.

349
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:26,892
But

350
00:15:29,056 --> 00:15:31,587
you shouldn't make such a lonely face.

351
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:33,525
Huh?

352
00:15:40,907 --> 00:15:42,234
I'll accidentally think that you

353
00:15:42,259 --> 00:15:43,297
gave me a chance.

354
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:55,141
(Sahashi Toma)

355
00:15:55,142 --> 00:15:56,345
It's Sahashi-kun.

356
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,064
Is it okay to not answer?

357
00:16:04,025 --> 00:16:05,173
It's fine.

358
00:16:06,743 --> 00:16:08,321
Huh?

359
00:16:09,962 --> 00:16:11,196
I thought Mamiya-kun

360
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,892
was pitiable for looking lonely,

361
00:16:14,142 --> 00:16:15,540
but maybe Sahashi-kun is

362
00:16:15,548 --> 00:16:16,923
the one to actually pity.

363
00:16:18,267 --> 00:16:19,025
Huh?

364
00:16:20,056 --> 00:16:21,150
Not calling for help

365
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,099
in this situation is strange.

366
00:16:23,908 --> 00:16:25,267
He called you even though

367
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,485
he was really busy.

368
00:16:26,970 --> 00:16:27,970
That is...

369
00:16:28,994 --> 00:16:31,134
You're quite cunning, aren't you?

370
00:16:34,978 --> 00:16:37,072
What do you mean by cunning?

371
00:16:38,619 --> 00:16:40,095
I'll let you go this time.

372
00:16:41,353 --> 00:16:42,275
Go home.

373
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,071
Just this once.

374
00:16:50,767 --> 00:16:51,775
Why...

375
00:16:57,775 --> 00:17:00,017
Why did he have to say that much?

376
00:17:02,705 --> 00:17:05,228
I understand that Sakashi is busy.

377
00:17:05,978 --> 00:17:07,103
That's why I don't want to

378
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:08,140
cause him any problems.

379
00:17:08,165 --> 00:17:09,485
Is it so wrong?

380
00:17:11,486 --> 00:17:12,634
As a senpai,

381
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,243
not showing weakness is correct, right?

382
00:17:17,072 --> 00:17:17,876
Then...

383
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:20,689
is it the correct way for as a lover?

384
00:17:23,775 --> 00:17:26,478
Ugh, I just don't get it!

385
00:17:32,751 --> 00:17:35,399
(Sahashi Toma: I'll call you again)

386
00:17:41,017 --> 00:17:43,009
Wanna try a gold eyebrow?

387
00:17:43,056 --> 00:17:44,834
Huh, gold?

388
00:17:44,881 --> 00:17:46,506
Everyone's surprised at first,

389
00:17:46,513 --> 00:17:47,990
but it suits them quite well.

390
00:17:48,662 --> 00:17:50,881
Alright, I'll give it a shot.

391
00:17:50,935 --> 00:17:51,951
Alrighty.

392
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:53,209
Mamiya-kun, can you pass me that?

393
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,107
Ah, sure.

394
00:17:58,872 --> 00:18:00,161
Thank you.

395
00:18:01,013 --> 00:18:01,928
Ah. Sorry.

396
00:18:02,381 --> 00:18:03,685
I know you feel awkward

397
00:18:03,701 --> 00:18:04,778
after yesterday,

398
00:18:04,802 --> 00:18:06,310
but you need to act professionally.

399
00:18:07,826 --> 00:18:09,170
I'm sorry.

400
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,998
Many customers come here

401
00:18:12,037 --> 00:18:14,232
to feel better and gain confidence.

402
00:18:14,529 --> 00:18:16,005
We want them to leave feeling

403
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:17,084
bright and happy.

404
00:18:17,764 --> 00:18:18,756
You understand, right?

405
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:21,146
Yes.

406
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,302
I'm sorry.

407
00:18:49,787 --> 00:18:51,496
(Sahashi: I'll call you again)

408
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:53,364
(Sorry I missed your call)

409
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,215
(Sahashi: It's fine)

410
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:56,817
(Sahashi: Did something happen?)

411
00:18:56,818 --> 00:19:00,403
(Sahashi)

412
00:19:00,404 --> 00:19:03,280
(I missed you)

413
00:19:06,872 --> 00:19:09,580
(Sahashi I missed you)

414
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:11,575
(Sahashi)
(Message Recalled)

415
00:19:11,575 --> 00:19:13,645
(Message Recalled)
(Message Recalled)

416
00:19:20,286 --> 00:19:21,247
In the end,

417
00:19:22,396 --> 00:19:24,099
Maybe I'm just scared.

418
00:19:26,271 --> 00:19:28,012
Scared of showing my pathetic side

419
00:19:29,185 --> 00:19:30,763
and being disliked by him.

420
00:19:32,778 --> 00:19:34,316
That's why I can't be needy

421
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:36,693
or honest with my feelings.

422
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,278
Mamiya-kun, you're quite cunning,

423
00:19:40,303 --> 00:19:41,303
aren't you?

424
00:19:42,771 --> 00:19:44,489
Nanjo-san was right.

425
00:19:45,497 --> 00:19:46,521
I am cunning.

426
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:48,974
If I could just throw away my pride

427
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,755
and tell him everything like he does...

428
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:54,559
You're too serious,

429
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:55,677
stubborn,

430
00:19:55,927 --> 00:19:57,763
and awkward. Straight as a ruler.

431
00:19:58,099 --> 00:20:00,044
You're too meddlesome. It's off-putting.

432
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:01,786
I'm going to expose

433
00:20:01,810 --> 00:20:03,036
everything about you.

434
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:07,825
Wait.

435
00:20:08,684 --> 00:20:10,786
That guy really pisses me off.

436
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,887
Messing with my feelings like that!

437
00:20:17,318 --> 00:20:18,146
But...

438
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:20,763
I know.

439
00:20:22,341 --> 00:20:23,974
It's because he's like that

440
00:20:24,497 --> 00:20:25,325
that I...

441
00:20:35,251 --> 00:20:36,322
Sahashi?

442
00:20:48,134 --> 00:20:49,306
Did something happen?

443
00:20:49,853 --> 00:20:51,517
That's my line.

444
00:20:53,759 --> 00:20:55,407
Why did you delete your messages?

445
00:20:57,383 --> 00:20:58,383
That is...

446
00:21:00,157 --> 00:21:00,978
Forget it.

447
00:21:06,009 --> 00:21:07,040
What?

448
00:21:10,407 --> 00:21:11,821
If nothing's wrong, that's fine.

449
00:21:15,626 --> 00:21:16,876
It wasn't fine.

450
00:21:19,306 --> 00:21:20,220
Well...

451
00:21:22,735 --> 00:21:24,032
I was really stressed.

452
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:27,439
You being alone with her

453
00:21:28,314 --> 00:21:29,399
alone in the hotel.

454
00:21:29,430 --> 00:21:30,125
Oh,

455
00:21:30,415 --> 00:21:31,266
that.

456
00:21:32,048 --> 00:21:33,516
Risako couldn't turn on the hot water

457
00:21:33,532 --> 00:21:34,532
in the room.

458
00:21:34,571 --> 00:21:36,220
So she called me to help her.

459
00:21:37,868 --> 00:21:39,196
Don't worry.

460
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,509
Risako has a boyfriend.

461
00:21:42,376 --> 00:21:43,782
We're just colleagues.

462
00:21:47,524 --> 00:21:49,423
Were you jealous?

463
00:21:50,540 --> 00:21:51,689
No!

464
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:56,298
Natsume-san,

465
00:21:57,165 --> 00:21:58,501
I missed you,

466
00:21:59,282 --> 00:22:00,345
and you?

467
00:22:04,586 --> 00:22:05,547
I was lonely.

468
00:22:07,587 --> 00:22:08,884
I really missed you.

469
00:22:15,687 --> 00:22:16,703
Me too.

470
00:22:32,167 --> 00:22:33,089
After that,

471
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,799
Sahashi performed brilliantly

472
00:22:34,823 --> 00:22:35,917
at all the events.

473
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:40,675
I saw Sahashi-kun's performance.

474
00:22:40,699 --> 00:22:42,004
It was more than I expected.

475
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:43,464
He should become

476
00:22:43,488 --> 00:22:44,565
a professional makeup artist.

477
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:45,824
I think so too.

478
00:22:47,574 --> 00:22:48,738
Hey.

479
00:22:49,215 --> 00:22:51,355
I'm still serious, you know.

480
00:22:54,996 --> 00:22:56,027
Sorry.

481
00:22:56,605 --> 00:22:59,238
I like him.

482
00:23:02,269 --> 00:23:04,636
You've got a good look on your face now.

483
00:23:08,793 --> 00:23:09,769
Ah...

484
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,566
Hello, Nanjo-san.

485
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,199
Thanks for taking care of

486
00:23:13,207 --> 00:23:14,487
our Natsume-san.

487
00:23:14,761 --> 00:23:16,277
What's with 'our'?

488
00:23:16,542 --> 00:23:17,730
It's fine.

489
00:23:17,824 --> 00:23:19,793
You two take care of each other.

490
00:23:20,043 --> 00:23:21,261
Don't make others think

491
00:23:21,286 --> 00:23:22,418
you guys are lonely.

492
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:24,230
See ya!

493
00:23:32,707 --> 00:23:33,691
Hey, Sahashi,

494
00:23:36,465 --> 00:23:37,574
today...

495
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:39,527
you were really cool.

496
00:23:41,129 --> 00:23:42,363
I will also try my best

497
00:23:42,388 --> 00:23:43,472
not to lose to you.

498
00:23:45,722 --> 00:23:46,605
I...

499
00:23:47,206 --> 00:23:49,581
took on the event to see
that look on your face.

500
00:23:49,753 --> 00:23:51,581
That 'you're cool' look.

501
00:23:52,621 --> 00:23:53,995
What's with you?

502
00:23:58,769 --> 00:24:00,152
Falling for me again, huh?

503
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:06,652
Ah.

504
00:24:06,824 --> 00:24:09,480
Hey, can you call me by my name now?

505
00:24:09,972 --> 00:24:10,707
Huh?

506
00:24:12,863 --> 00:24:13,621
By the way,

507
00:24:13,730 --> 00:24:15,894
why do I have to do what you say?

508
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:17,207
You haven't...

509
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:19,097
What?

510
00:24:22,269 --> 00:24:23,159
You haven't...

511
00:24:23,863 --> 00:24:25,673
even told me you like me!

512
00:24:27,855 --> 00:24:29,824
That bothered you?

513
00:24:30,261 --> 00:24:32,254
You're cute in that way.

514
00:24:32,785 --> 00:24:33,691
Aww...

515
00:24:36,207 --> 00:24:37,300
Dammit!

516
00:24:37,480 --> 00:24:38,785
Dammit!

517
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,308
I'm totally in love with him!

518
00:24:46,418 --> 00:24:47,238
(Next episode)
Spare key.

519
00:24:47,238 --> 00:24:49,441
Actually, you're really worried.

520
00:24:49,441 --> 00:24:51,441
I'm rooting for you two.

521
00:24:51,441 --> 00:24:52,425
At the end of next month, there'll be

522
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:53,487
two weeks of training in Paris.

523
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:55,339
If I could be like you, that'd be great.

524
00:24:55,457 --> 00:24:57,136
Then do better.

525
00:24:57,161 --> 00:24:58,003
If I could do better,

526
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,065
I'd have done it long ago.

527
00:24:59,089 --> 00:25:01,292
I can't do everything like you.
