1
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:02,398
Spring.

2
00:00:02,796 --> 00:00:03,679
New school terms.

3
00:00:03,883 --> 00:00:04,820
Promotion.

4
00:00:05,266 --> 00:00:06,234
New fiscal year.

5
00:00:06,703 --> 00:00:08,703
A season for new beginnings.

6
00:00:08,836 --> 00:00:09,922
How do you like it?

7
00:00:11,070 --> 00:00:12,039
Huh?

8
00:00:12,085 --> 00:00:13,546
I look like a different person!

9
00:00:13,585 --> 00:00:15,233
Amazing, Sahashi-san.

10
00:00:15,258 --> 00:00:16,359
Thank you.

11
00:00:16,672 --> 00:00:17,680
It's all..

12
00:00:18,508 --> 00:00:19,320
Huh?

13
00:00:19,663 --> 00:00:22,265
Thanks to the practice with Mamiya-san.

14
00:00:22,578 --> 00:00:23,914
- Wow!
- Wow!

15
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:25,359
- Prince!
- Prince!

16
00:00:27,984 --> 00:00:29,328
For our company,

17
00:00:29,953 --> 00:00:31,421
it's the season for personnel changes.

18
00:00:32,125 --> 00:00:33,078
Sahashi-san.

19
00:00:33,273 --> 00:00:35,039
I heard today is your last day.

20
00:00:35,078 --> 00:00:36,320
What? Really?

21
00:00:36,563 --> 00:00:38,148
The 'W Prince' duo is breaking up?

22
00:00:38,359 --> 00:00:40,852
I'll continue to stay here,

23
00:00:40,867 --> 00:00:42,101
and Sahashi is just moving to

24
00:00:42,126 --> 00:00:43,321
the Ginza store.

25
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:44,601
It's really close by,

26
00:00:44,656 --> 00:00:46,078
so please come visit.

27
00:00:46,273 --> 00:00:47,718
I definitely will!

28
00:00:47,906 --> 00:00:49,069
- It's okay, right?
- Yes.

29
00:00:49,070 --> 00:00:50,921
Sahashi is transferring to a new store

30
00:00:50,945 --> 00:00:52,491
that specializes in makeup.

31
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:54,039
How do you like it?

32
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,039
Chief is being transferred to the HQ.

33
00:00:56,055 --> 00:00:57,991
This one will show results very quickly.

34
00:00:58,234 --> 00:00:59,570
Thank you very much.

35
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,789
As for Aizawa-san,

36
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:02,476
I heard she was offered

37
00:01:02,501 --> 00:01:03,866
the position of new chief,

38
00:01:04,273 --> 00:01:05,359
but declined.

39
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:08,515
And...

40
00:01:09,383 --> 00:01:10,211
Umm...

41
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:11,515
Thank you for your hard work,

42
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,398
Chief Harada.

43
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:13,578
And Mamiya-san,

44
00:01:13,805 --> 00:01:15,023
congratulations on your

45
00:01:15,039 --> 00:01:16,296
new position as chief!

46
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,422
Cheers!

47
00:01:17,492 --> 00:01:19,984
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

48
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:21,461
As for me...

49
00:01:22,102 --> 00:01:23,805
I was promoted to chief manager

50
00:01:23,829 --> 00:01:25,320
of the Shinonome Yurakucho.

51
00:02:23,062 --> 00:02:26,976
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 4)

52
00:02:27,609 --> 00:02:28,695
Natsume-kun is now

53
00:02:28,711 --> 00:02:30,140
promoted to the chief position?

54
00:02:30,391 --> 00:02:31,960
It is tough, but don't hesitate

55
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:33,585
to ask for anything.

56
00:02:33,914 --> 00:02:35,273
Chiefs and sales need to

57
00:02:35,297 --> 00:02:36,640
work together, after all.

58
00:02:37,156 --> 00:02:37,867
Yes!

59
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,883
I'll do my best.

60
00:02:41,008 --> 00:02:44,078
I'm really glad Mamiya-kun is here.

61
00:02:46,594 --> 00:02:47,602
What do you mean?

62
00:02:47,664 --> 00:02:50,586
Because he trained you.

63
00:02:51,406 --> 00:02:54,102
You were a difficult subordinate,

64
00:02:54,211 --> 00:02:55,593
so I'm glad you two

65
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,289
got along as expected.

66
00:02:58,531 --> 00:03:01,445
You two are really my pride.

67
00:03:05,031 --> 00:03:07,736
I'm happy about it too.

68
00:03:09,414 --> 00:03:11,302
- Chief.
- Chief.

69
00:03:11,303 --> 00:03:12,468
Come on,

70
00:03:12,469 --> 00:03:14,743
it's not a forever goodbye.

71
00:03:15,117 --> 00:03:16,313
Do your best.

72
00:03:16,359 --> 00:03:18,375
- We will!
- We will!

73
00:03:18,922 --> 00:03:20,500
Ah. Mamiya-kun.

74
00:03:20,992 --> 00:03:21,703
Yes?

75
00:03:21,977 --> 00:03:23,424
Just one last thing.

76
00:03:23,781 --> 00:03:24,921
If anything happens,

77
00:03:24,946 --> 00:03:26,540
don't carry it all by yourself.

78
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,313
Yes.

79
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,851
Even though I'm your senpai

80
00:03:29,883 --> 00:03:30,882
and your subordinate,

81
00:03:30,906 --> 00:03:32,453
and it might be awkward,

82
00:03:33,398 --> 00:03:36,070
I'll support you as I can.

83
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:37,195
so don't hesitate to ask.

84
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:39,148
Thank you very much.

85
00:03:40,422 --> 00:03:41,117
And...

86
00:03:41,734 --> 00:03:42,484
Chief,

87
00:03:43,945 --> 00:03:45,617
thank you so much for everything!

88
00:03:46,289 --> 00:03:47,398
I'm rooting for you.

89
00:03:48,445 --> 00:03:49,726
Alright everyone, let's go

90
00:03:49,742 --> 00:03:51,045
before we bother the staff here.

91
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,852
Time to go!

92
00:03:52,875 --> 00:03:54,500
- Yes!
- Yes!

93
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:00,263
Are you really going to be okay

94
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:01,287
from tomorrow?

95
00:04:02,272 --> 00:04:03,194
What do you mean by that?

96
00:04:04,256 --> 00:04:06,045
We'll be at different stores,

97
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:07,123
so I won't be able to

98
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:08,311
support you anymore.

99
00:04:08,561 --> 00:04:09,475
I'll be fine.

100
00:04:09,873 --> 00:04:10,881
I'll do my best.

101
00:04:13,272 --> 00:04:14,545
I'm heading this way.

102
00:04:16,194 --> 00:04:16,967
Ah...

103
00:04:18,498 --> 00:04:19,420
Truth is,

104
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:21,233
I'm incredibly anxious.

105
00:04:23,326 --> 00:04:24,108
Oh,

106
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:25,678
by the way.

107
00:04:26,186 --> 00:04:26,905
Here.

108
00:04:31,428 --> 00:04:32,116
Huh?

109
00:04:34,145 --> 00:04:34,903
A key?

110
00:04:35,287 --> 00:04:36,147
A spare key.

111
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:39,373
I know you're actually really anxious.

112
00:04:41,209 --> 00:04:42,740
He can read me like a book?

113
00:04:44,936 --> 00:04:46,561
Here's my address.

114
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,686
Come by anytime you miss me.

115
00:04:52,233 --> 00:04:53,831
You can even stay over.

116
00:04:55,084 --> 00:04:55,920
You!

117
00:04:56,537 --> 00:04:57,334
Later.

118
00:04:59,787 --> 00:05:00,998
Does he think this is supposed

119
00:05:01,022 --> 00:05:02,022
to be encouraging?

120
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,722
On the first day of the new system,

121
00:05:15,144 --> 00:05:16,253
I was not at all used to

122
00:05:16,262 --> 00:05:17,417
the tasks of a chief.

123
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:18,925
Chief,

124
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:21,027
the new sample additions have arrived.

125
00:05:21,082 --> 00:05:22,667
Thank you. Just leave them here.

126
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:23,394
Yes.

127
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:26,152
Chief, we're out of lipstick number 31.

128
00:05:26,207 --> 00:05:27,331
- Already?
- Yes.

129
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,423
Got it, number 31.

130
00:05:30,417 --> 00:05:31,144
Chief,

131
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,839
- Yes?
- a customer is waiting over there.

132
00:05:32,839 --> 00:05:33,995
- I'm on my way!
- Yes.

133
00:05:34,019 --> 00:05:35,800
Are you okay? Want me to take over?

134
00:05:35,971 --> 00:05:37,628
Thank you, but I'm okay!

135
00:05:41,753 --> 00:05:43,285
Welcome, Sakai-sama.

136
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,808
Sorry to make you wait.

137
00:05:47,148 --> 00:05:48,562
I've sent the email,

138
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,961
and this document needs to go to HQ.

139
00:05:51,617 --> 00:05:53,883
And then handle the inquiries.

140
00:05:53,945 --> 00:05:54,953
Natsume-kun.

141
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,477
Great work.

142
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:58,203
Tanouchi-san!

143
00:05:58,445 --> 00:06:00,250
- Thank you for your hard work.
- Thank you for your hard work.

144
00:06:02,281 --> 00:06:03,430
Thank you for your hard work.

145
00:06:04,539 --> 00:06:06,101
This is the new guy, Harukawa-kun.

146
00:06:06,641 --> 00:06:07,758
I'm Harukawa Taichi.

147
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,312
Nice to meet you.

148
00:06:09,484 --> 00:06:10,695
I'm Chief Mamiya.

149
00:06:11,055 --> 00:06:11,891
Nice to meet you.

150
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:14,164
He's my junior in the sales department,

151
00:06:14,274 --> 00:06:15,336
but he wants to gain some

152
00:06:15,344 --> 00:06:16,444
on-site experience.

153
00:06:16,469 --> 00:06:17,609
Can you let him help out

154
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,914
on the floor occasionally?

155
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:20,078
Got it.

156
00:06:20,844 --> 00:06:22,234
You're quite studious, huh?

157
00:06:22,937 --> 00:06:24,172
I think it's important to

158
00:06:24,197 --> 00:06:25,445
know the field as well!

159
00:06:26,586 --> 00:06:28,766
But having a male BA like this,

160
00:06:28,836 --> 00:06:29,930
it's reassuring.

161
00:06:30,531 --> 00:06:31,788
I'll do my best to become

162
00:06:31,804 --> 00:06:32,859
proficient quickly!

163
00:06:33,336 --> 00:06:34,664
Oh, Harukawa-kun,

164
00:06:34,789 --> 00:06:35,844
- What about that?
- Yes.

165
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
These are the additional

166
00:06:37,016 --> 00:06:38,062
purchase benefits!

167
00:06:38,086 --> 00:06:39,477
- Whoa!
- Oh!

168
00:06:39,586 --> 00:06:40,852
Harukawa-kun!

169
00:06:41,031 --> 00:06:42,289
- Are you alright?
- Take it easy, okay?

170
00:06:42,313 --> 00:06:43,124
I'm sorry!

171
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,148
Seeing a fresh rookie even more

172
00:06:45,172 --> 00:06:46,612
flustered than me

173
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,327
somehow eased my own tension.

174
00:06:50,328 --> 00:06:51,727
Yes, thank you.

175
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:52,891
Thank you.

176
00:06:57,195 --> 00:06:58,602
Umm...

177
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:01,078
So tomorrow, there's a new leaflet,

178
00:07:01,429 --> 00:07:02,538
the meeting at HQ.

179
00:07:02,539 --> 00:07:04,374
And I need to bring the documents

180
00:07:04,399 --> 00:07:05,578
from the meeting.

181
00:07:13,492 --> 00:07:17,468
(Sahashi Toma: 'Let's go home together'
'I'll cook dinner')

182
00:07:27,891 --> 00:07:28,961
Wow,

183
00:07:29,227 --> 00:07:30,774
this is Sahashi's place?

184
00:07:31,422 --> 00:07:33,172
It's so stylish.

185
00:07:33,524 --> 00:07:34,867
I'm incredibly nervous.

186
00:07:36,266 --> 00:07:38,422
Even the food looks fancy!

187
00:07:40,406 --> 00:07:41,969
Please eat while it's still warm.

188
00:07:42,072 --> 00:07:42,774
Huh?

189
00:07:42,820 --> 00:07:43,906
Ah, thank you.

190
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:49,546
Then...

191
00:07:51,547 --> 00:07:53,180
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

192
00:08:06,117 --> 00:08:07,828
Mmm...

193
00:08:09,727 --> 00:08:10,649
Delicious!

194
00:08:12,727 --> 00:08:14,656
So, how's the new store?

195
00:08:15,992 --> 00:08:17,383
There's a guy with a Kansai accent,

196
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:18,656
and he's quite annoying.

197
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:20,445
The W Princes of Yurakucho!

198
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,031
You mean Nanjo-san.

199
00:08:24,844 --> 00:08:25,852
How about you?

200
00:08:26,195 --> 00:08:27,641
Tell me about your day.

201
00:08:27,953 --> 00:08:28,703
Me?

202
00:08:28,953 --> 00:08:30,219
Ah...

203
00:08:30,641 --> 00:08:31,711
A new sales trainee,

204
00:08:31,735 --> 00:08:33,078
Harukawa-kun, joined today,

205
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:35,234
and he was incredibly nervous.

206
00:08:36,156 --> 00:08:37,844
I'm still not used to being the chief,

207
00:08:37,869 --> 00:08:39,000
so it was tough.

208
00:08:40,484 --> 00:08:43,000
Plus, I have a meeting at HQ tomorrow.

209
00:08:47,906 --> 00:08:49,211
Mmm!

210
00:08:49,797 --> 00:08:51,695
But this is so good.

211
00:08:54,852 --> 00:08:57,555
I didn't have a proper meal all day.

212
00:08:58,328 --> 00:08:59,742
If I had gone home,

213
00:09:00,063 --> 00:09:01,602
I wouldn't have had the energy to eat.

214
00:09:02,227 --> 00:09:03,445
Hmm...

215
00:09:04,562 --> 00:09:05,750
Then why not live here?

216
00:09:07,774 --> 00:09:08,859
No.

217
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:14,094
Sorry.

218
00:09:19,109 --> 00:09:20,391
Tanouchi-san.

219
00:09:22,703 --> 00:09:24,109
Yes, good evening.

220
00:09:26,508 --> 00:09:27,828
Oh, really?

221
00:09:30,422 --> 00:09:32,664
Yes, of course! I'd love to!

222
00:09:34,094 --> 00:09:34,766
Huh?

223
00:09:35,452 --> 00:09:36,483
Next month?

224
00:09:38,063 --> 00:09:38,774
Ah...

225
00:09:39,328 --> 00:09:40,203
No.

226
00:09:41,484 --> 00:09:42,500
I'd like to do it.

227
00:09:43,266 --> 00:09:44,680
Please let me!

228
00:09:45,492 --> 00:09:46,508
Please.

229
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,578
Yes. Good night.

230
00:09:53,313 --> 00:09:54,133
What was that?

231
00:09:55,742 --> 00:09:57,109
He suddenly asked if I wanted

232
00:09:57,126 --> 00:09:58,328
to hold an event at the shop.

233
00:09:59,805 --> 00:10:01,086
But it's scheduled for

234
00:10:01,102 --> 00:10:02,500
the middle of next month.

235
00:10:03,164 --> 00:10:04,609
That's quite sudden.

236
00:10:05,016 --> 00:10:06,500
Normally, event preparations

237
00:10:06,524 --> 00:10:07,524
take months.

238
00:10:08,086 --> 00:10:09,594
Tanouchi-san said we

239
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:11,351
didn't have to accept it,

240
00:10:11,813 --> 00:10:13,359
but I think it'd boost

241
00:10:13,376 --> 00:10:15,024
our summer collection sales..

242
00:10:15,313 --> 00:10:16,789
Hmm...

243
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:18,945
Did you accept it just because

244
00:10:18,977 --> 00:10:20,453
Tanouchi-san asked you to?

245
00:10:21,156 --> 00:10:22,547
What? No!

246
00:10:23,422 --> 00:10:24,891
I want to improve our sales

247
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,844
as the chief.

248
00:10:27,469 --> 00:10:29,242
So, I'll do my best.

249
00:10:29,609 --> 00:10:30,352
Yeah.

250
00:10:33,313 --> 00:10:34,766
At that time, I thought

251
00:10:35,554 --> 00:10:36,672
sheer determination

252
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:37,906
would get me through.

253
00:10:41,203 --> 00:10:43,179
Is this direction okay for the display?

254
00:10:43,219 --> 00:10:43,984
But...

255
00:10:44,024 --> 00:10:44,758
Yes.

256
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,156
Reality wasn't so kind.

257
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:48,750
This element...

258
00:10:48,781 --> 00:10:49,703
Yes.

259
00:10:50,945 --> 00:10:52,352
Excuse me.

260
00:10:56,258 --> 00:10:57,078
Yes.

261
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:00,953
Understood, I'm on my way.

262
00:11:04,641 --> 00:11:06,711
Chief, I'm sorry.

263
00:11:06,969 --> 00:11:08,101
I think I miscounted

264
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,805
the lipstick inventory.

265
00:11:09,883 --> 00:11:11,359
It didn't match the invoice.

266
00:11:11,914 --> 00:11:14,086
Alright, I'll check it after this.

267
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:15,211
- It's alright.
- I'm sorry.

268
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:18,727
Chief,

269
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:20,117
the limited edition gloss

270
00:11:20,172 --> 00:11:22,375
is running low. Can we restock?

271
00:11:22,883 --> 00:11:24,210
I'll handle it right after this.

272
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:24,953
Yes.

273
00:11:25,141 --> 00:11:26,211
Ah, umm...

274
00:11:27,109 --> 00:11:28,203
It's still not full.

275
00:11:28,828 --> 00:11:29,399
Huh?

276
00:11:40,047 --> 00:11:42,349
(Can you come over today?)

277
00:11:42,350 --> 00:11:46,523
(Mamiya: Probably not.)

278
00:11:46,523 --> 00:11:53,507
(Mamiya: Working late.)

279
00:11:53,507 --> 00:11:57,586
(Got it.)

280
00:11:57,586 --> 00:12:01,750
(Call me when you're free)

281
00:12:06,506 --> 00:12:08,818
Oh dear, got dumped?

282
00:12:09,631 --> 00:12:10,756
No way.

283
00:12:10,795 --> 00:12:11,631
Hold on,

284
00:12:11,662 --> 00:12:12,646
work talk.

285
00:12:13,193 --> 00:12:14,433
Two weeks of training in Paris starting

286
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:15,519
at the end of next month.

287
00:12:15,544 --> 00:12:17,646
I'm taking you along, so be prepared.

288
00:12:17,904 --> 00:12:19,178
Here are the materials.

289
00:12:21,334 --> 00:12:23,521
Me too? But I'm not a makeup artist.

290
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,060
Even though I'm like this,

291
00:12:25,084 --> 00:12:26,990
I have an eye for talent, you know.

292
00:12:29,568 --> 00:12:30,326
Ugh...

293
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,998
I'm dying.

294
00:12:33,428 --> 00:12:34,513
Umm...

295
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:37,224
Display and advertising

296
00:12:37,241 --> 00:12:38,921
are top priorities.

297
00:12:39,521 --> 00:12:40,521
Waiting for a reply on

298
00:12:40,545 --> 00:12:41,582
the limited editions.

299
00:12:41,607 --> 00:12:44,326
Arrange shifts for temporary employees.

300
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:47,645
Allocate staff within budget and then...

301
00:12:49,013 --> 00:12:53,217
ugh, my head is going to explode!

302
00:12:56,576 --> 00:12:57,537
At times like this,

303
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,818
if only he were here...

304
00:13:03,568 --> 00:13:04,638
I want to see him.

305
00:13:06,489 --> 00:13:08,028
How did I unwind

306
00:13:08,326 --> 00:13:10,489
before meeting him?

307
00:13:13,029 --> 00:13:14,576
I can't remember at all.

308
00:13:16,138 --> 00:13:16,911
But...

309
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:18,943
I promised myself I wouldn't

310
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:20,138
rely on him this time.

311
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,646
Umm...

312
00:13:26,381 --> 00:13:28,763
We'll need two makeup artists.

313
00:13:29,045 --> 00:13:30,654
Sahashi-kun is a must.

314
00:13:30,951 --> 00:13:32,099
Ah, no,

315
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:33,998
I'd like someone else instead.

316
00:13:34,592 --> 00:13:35,881
Really?

317
00:13:36,123 --> 00:13:37,716
He's a valuable asset.

318
00:13:38,131 --> 00:13:40,560
I want to try managing without his help.

319
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:44,753
Plus,

320
00:13:45,271 --> 00:13:46,299
he's working hard

321
00:13:46,323 --> 00:13:47,510
at his current location.

322
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:50,342
True,

323
00:13:50,732 --> 00:13:52,299
it seems the headquarters is

324
00:13:52,315 --> 00:13:54,221
focusing on developing him.

325
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:56,018
He's even going to a training session

326
00:13:56,026 --> 00:13:56,895
in Paris soon.

327
00:13:56,919 --> 00:13:57,677
Paris?

328
00:13:59,943 --> 00:14:01,208
Really?

329
00:14:01,365 --> 00:14:03,428
Didn't he tell you?

330
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,959
Sahashi

331
00:14:08,724 --> 00:14:10,818
doesn't talk much about himself.

332
00:14:12,576 --> 00:14:14,209
We haven't seen each other lately.

333
00:14:15,443 --> 00:14:16,747
He's probably trying

334
00:14:16,771 --> 00:14:18,654
not to interfere with my work.

335
00:14:19,662 --> 00:14:20,904
Don't you want to visit him?

336
00:14:22,045 --> 00:14:22,818
Huh?

337
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,037
No...

338
00:14:27,771 --> 00:14:29,834
but in this overwhelming situation...

339
00:14:29,974 --> 00:14:31,053
Why not?

340
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,427
When times are tough,

341
00:14:33,544 --> 00:14:35,474
wanting to see someone you love,

342
00:14:35,803 --> 00:14:38,076
I think it is natural.

343
00:14:40,224 --> 00:14:41,724
Sahashi-kun said

344
00:14:42,044 --> 00:14:43,208
that you're his.

345
00:14:43,795 --> 00:14:45,943
That's what it meant, right?

346
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:50,912
This person is already mine.

347
00:14:53,909 --> 00:14:54,612
Yes.

348
00:14:56,685 --> 00:15:00,044
I'm rooting for you two.

349
00:15:18,513 --> 00:15:19,521
It's okay, right?

350
00:15:20,373 --> 00:15:22,162
To just come over unannounced.

351
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:38,670
Excuse me.

352
00:15:43,381 --> 00:15:44,412
Sahashi.

353
00:15:46,029 --> 00:15:46,881
He's asleep.

354
00:16:05,415 --> 00:16:06,929
(Romy Feerique 2024
Paris training materials)

355
00:16:06,930 --> 00:16:08,859
Paris training materials?

356
00:16:10,477 --> 00:16:11,844
He's amazing.

357
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:14,110
I'm just

358
00:16:14,657 --> 00:16:16,337
stuck in place.

359
00:16:38,094 --> 00:16:40,094
I know it's impossible,

360
00:16:42,868 --> 00:16:43,618
but I

361
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,274
wish I could be like you.

362
00:16:53,935 --> 00:16:55,013
I want to touch him.

363
00:17:05,388 --> 00:17:06,450
I feel so calm.

364
00:17:08,724 --> 00:17:09,803
As expected,

365
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,506
with this guy,

366
00:17:12,506 --> 00:17:13,357
I probably...

367
00:17:40,412 --> 00:17:42,584
What am I doing?

368
00:17:43,248 --> 00:17:45,115
Showing up at his place unannounced.

369
00:17:45,803 --> 00:17:48,052
It's not like we're living together.

370
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:50,536
But...

371
00:17:51,099 --> 00:17:51,880
Wait.

372
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:54,810
By the way...

373
00:17:56,263 --> 00:17:57,482
Hmm...

374
00:17:58,467 --> 00:17:59,685
Then why not live here?

375
00:18:00,428 --> 00:18:01,497
Was that his way of

376
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:02,700
asking me to move in?

377
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:05,607
I brushed it off without thinking.

378
00:18:06,356 --> 00:18:07,489
I might have hurt him.

379
00:18:12,615 --> 00:18:14,756
An event that began amidst chaos...

380
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,458
(Meet your new self)
The first two weeks

381
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,576
passed by in a whirlwind.

382
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:22,693
Thank you very much. Please come again.

383
00:18:24,006 --> 00:18:24,911
Sorry for the wait.

384
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:25,771
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

385
00:18:25,834 --> 00:18:26,771
- I'm so sorry!
- Sorry.

386
00:18:26,787 --> 00:18:28,560
These are additional pamphlets,

387
00:18:28,568 --> 00:18:29,779
where should I put them?

388
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:30,997
It's okay. I'll take care of them.

389
00:18:31,076 --> 00:18:32,326
Thanks. You've helped a lot.

390
00:18:33,107 --> 00:18:34,528
Chief, we're running out of

391
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:35,834
the limited edition gloss!

392
00:18:35,858 --> 00:18:36,419
What?

393
00:18:36,435 --> 00:18:37,950
Maybe there was a miscount?

394
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:39,208
I'll get more immediately.

395
00:18:39,209 --> 00:18:40,545
Thank you, I'm sorry!

396
00:18:40,599 --> 00:18:41,428
Chief,

397
00:18:41,623 --> 00:18:43,310
we're up to number 15 in line.

398
00:18:43,826 --> 00:18:45,193
Got it, thanks!

399
00:18:45,998 --> 00:18:47,724
Looks like it's pretty hectic here.

400
00:18:47,787 --> 00:18:48,810
I'm here to help.

401
00:18:48,857 --> 00:18:49,881
Thank you.

402
00:18:50,428 --> 00:18:52,771
You okay? You look really tired.

403
00:18:53,685 --> 00:18:55,123
I'll manage.

404
00:18:55,599 --> 00:18:57,013
Please handle the customers.

405
00:18:58,326 --> 00:19:00,802
Thank you for waiting. Please come in.

406
00:19:03,685 --> 00:19:05,209
The two-week event

407
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:07,217
finally ended today.

408
00:19:08,693 --> 00:19:10,068
We had many customers,

409
00:19:10,451 --> 00:19:11,630
if you look at the numbers,

410
00:19:11,646 --> 00:19:12,693
it was a success...

411
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:14,889
I guess.

412
00:19:18,412 --> 00:19:19,146
But...

413
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,263
I was just

414
00:19:22,865 --> 00:19:24,552
overwhelmed the whole time

415
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:26,951
and failed as a chief.

416
00:19:28,256 --> 00:19:29,193
The truth is

417
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:31,756
I really wanted to impress Sahashi.

418
00:19:32,959 --> 00:19:33,998
That's why I...

419
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:47,763
Good work today.

420
00:19:48,178 --> 00:19:49,201
Good work.

421
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:51,209
I was just with Mamiya-kun.

422
00:19:51,248 --> 00:19:52,248
I went to help out.

423
00:19:52,662 --> 00:19:53,428
Hmm.

424
00:19:53,638 --> 00:19:56,810
But Mamiya-kun looked really unwell.

425
00:19:56,873 --> 00:19:58,646
Maybe he overdid it with the event?

426
00:19:59,763 --> 00:20:01,638
For a couple, you two don't seem

427
00:20:01,663 --> 00:20:03,343
to see each other much.

428
00:20:04,185 --> 00:20:05,373
What's going on?

429
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:07,451
Excuse me.

430
00:20:08,091 --> 00:20:10,310
(38.2°C)

431
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:13,115
I've definitely caught a cold.

432
00:20:21,834 --> 00:20:22,842
I want to see him.

433
00:20:24,209 --> 00:20:25,224
Sahashi.

434
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:36,045
Yes.

435
00:20:37,061 --> 00:20:38,092
Who is it...

436
00:20:39,068 --> 00:20:40,342
Can you let me in?

437
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,092
No way.

438
00:20:42,904 --> 00:20:44,466
I can't risk giving you my cold.

439
00:20:53,928 --> 00:20:55,607
Nanjo told me.

440
00:20:56,592 --> 00:20:57,842
Why didn't you tell me yourself?

441
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,654
It's not a big deal.

442
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,568
And I didn't want to infect you.

443
00:21:06,154 --> 00:21:07,607
If I had to hear about you

444
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:09,063
from someone else,

445
00:21:09,287 --> 00:21:11,498
I'd rather catch your cold.

446
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:13,412
I'm sorry.

447
00:21:14,475 --> 00:21:15,724
I bought some medicine for you.

448
00:21:19,342 --> 00:21:20,100
Thank you.

449
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,764
I wanted to catch up to Sahashi,

450
00:21:23,146 --> 00:21:24,935
to prove myself through the event.

451
00:21:26,967 --> 00:21:28,670
Now is not the time to be bedridden.

452
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:43,232
How are you feeling?

453
00:21:52,287 --> 00:21:53,115
Mmm.

454
00:21:53,748 --> 00:21:54,740
Much better.

455
00:21:57,623 --> 00:21:59,873
You've been here all along...

456
00:22:03,349 --> 00:22:04,583
You really should go home.

457
00:22:04,607 --> 00:22:05,638
If you catch my cold,

458
00:22:05,646 --> 00:22:06,708
it'll be a problem.

459
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:09,311
I'm fine now.

460
00:22:11,365 --> 00:22:12,178
Thanks.

461
00:22:13,107 --> 00:22:15,037
Don't worry about me.

462
00:22:16,904 --> 00:22:19,350
Why do you always seem so unfazed?

463
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:21,318
It's annoying.

464
00:22:28,584 --> 00:22:29,896
Hey, Natsume-san.

465
00:22:32,037 --> 00:22:33,029
Come to my place.

466
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:35,740
Huh?

467
00:22:37,162 --> 00:22:38,271
Let's live together.

468
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,630
I won't.

469
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:53,084
If I move in now,

470
00:22:53,872 --> 00:22:55,771
I'll just end up being spoiled.

471
00:22:57,725 --> 00:22:59,083
When you want to be spoiled,

472
00:22:59,099 --> 00:23:00,193
you can be spoiled.

473
00:23:01,029 --> 00:23:02,036
Like the other day,

474
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,255
you missed me so much that you

475
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:04,365
had to come see me, right?

476
00:23:04,529 --> 00:23:05,724
Why didn't you tell me?

477
00:23:06,498 --> 00:23:07,927
You were awake?

478
00:23:09,006 --> 00:23:10,928
Be more selfish with me.

479
00:23:11,576 --> 00:23:13,787
- If we lived together, you could...
- Now is...

480
00:23:17,514 --> 00:23:18,967
not the time for that.

481
00:23:21,162 --> 00:23:22,295
I need...

482
00:23:22,717 --> 00:23:23,998
to be more capable.

483
00:23:24,006 --> 00:23:25,146
Depending on someone and

484
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,552
doing your job are different.

485
00:23:26,748 --> 00:23:28,498
If you collapse, you lose everything.

486
00:23:29,631 --> 00:23:31,756
You're told to rely on others more,

487
00:23:32,123 --> 00:23:33,350
so balance things out...

488
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:34,717
I know that.

489
00:23:36,561 --> 00:23:38,037
Even though I know everything.

490
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:40,396
But sometimes...

491
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:43,717
I can't help but envy Sahashi,

492
00:23:44,607 --> 00:23:45,560
he's so dazzling,

493
00:23:46,311 --> 00:23:48,396
and I feel so pathetic.

494
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:51,061
Then you need to manage better.

495
00:23:54,514 --> 00:23:56,333
Don't compare me to you!

496
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:00,467
If I could manage better,

497
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:01,818
I'd have done it already.

498
00:24:01,998 --> 00:24:03,475
I'm not as capable as you.

499
00:24:04,623 --> 00:24:06,943
I can't do everything like you can!

500
00:24:10,271 --> 00:24:11,107
What?

501
00:24:13,896 --> 00:24:15,271
So that's how you feel.

502
00:24:28,717 --> 00:24:29,537
Sahashi.

503
00:24:34,982 --> 00:24:35,889
Take care,

504
00:24:36,654 --> 00:24:37,357
'senpai.'

505
00:24:51,428 --> 00:24:52,021
(Next episode)

506
00:24:52,021 --> 00:24:53,231
Three days have passed since that day.

507
00:24:53,232 --> 00:24:55,349
Sahashi went to Paris for training.

508
00:24:55,513 --> 00:24:56,506
Even if I send a message,

509
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,607
he won't reply.

510
00:24:57,631 --> 00:25:00,037
Please don't burden Natsume too much.

511
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,420
Take care of your own matters.

512
00:25:01,529 --> 00:25:03,146
I realized it when

513
00:25:03,155 --> 00:25:05,021
Sahashi-san scolded me.

514
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:06,982
I envy your ability.

515
00:25:07,545 --> 00:25:08,318
But I

516
00:25:08,576 --> 00:25:10,037
really like you.

517
00:25:10,068 --> 00:25:11,842
But you don't understand at all.

518
00:25:11,904 --> 00:25:13,037
That guy...

519
00:25:13,982 --> 00:25:15,615
Will you come and see me again?
