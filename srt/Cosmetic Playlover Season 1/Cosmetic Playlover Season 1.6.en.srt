1
00:00:35,039 --> 00:00:36,352
Good morning.

2
00:00:37,906 --> 00:00:38,789
Good morning.

3
00:00:51,523 --> 00:00:52,336
I...

4
00:00:53,679 --> 00:00:54,991
This is the first time I've spent

5
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,429
a night at Toma's apartment.

6
00:01:12,575 --> 00:01:13,880
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

7
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:19,520
Oh!

8
00:01:20,723 --> 00:01:22,333
This is so crispy!

9
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:24,083
What kind of bread is this?

10
00:01:24,106 --> 00:01:25,013
Rye.

11
00:01:25,419 --> 00:01:26,684
Wow.

12
00:01:27,059 --> 00:01:28,535
Having breakfast together like this

13
00:01:28,551 --> 00:01:29,831
is also a first.

14
00:01:32,536 --> 00:01:33,450
Of course,

15
00:01:34,052 --> 00:01:36,161
we get to brush our teeth side by side.

16
00:01:37,106 --> 00:01:37,919
Oh,

17
00:01:38,785 --> 00:01:39,738
your hair.

18
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,239
Sorry.

19
00:01:41,458 --> 00:01:42,192
Mmm.

20
00:01:49,919 --> 00:01:51,036
Let me do it.

21
00:01:55,505 --> 00:01:57,036
There you go.

22
00:01:57,583 --> 00:01:58,427
Thanks.

23
00:02:00,333 --> 00:02:01,677
They really suit you.

24
00:02:03,216 --> 00:02:04,059
Thank you.

25
00:02:04,722 --> 00:02:05,981
I'm on an early shift today,

26
00:02:05,997 --> 00:02:07,645
let's move your stuff tonight.

27
00:02:07,669 --> 00:02:09,223
Yeah.

28
00:02:10,286 --> 00:02:12,794
Ah, right.

29
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,575
Then...

30
00:02:15,184 --> 00:02:16,294
how about this?

31
00:02:17,638 --> 00:02:18,856
Can I have it back?

32
00:02:20,442 --> 00:02:21,255
Even though

33
00:02:22,981 --> 00:02:23,981
I'm like this,

34
00:02:25,985 --> 00:02:27,024
is that okay?

35
00:02:28,134 --> 00:02:29,063
Of course.

36
00:02:29,915 --> 00:02:30,993
We're...

37
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,837
finally living together!

38
00:02:40,468 --> 00:02:41,343
Wait.

39
00:02:41,702 --> 00:02:42,851
Yes?

40
00:02:44,657 --> 00:02:45,751
You forgot something.

41
00:02:48,055 --> 00:02:48,821
Let's go.

42
00:02:50,493 --> 00:02:51,227
Yeah.

43
00:02:55,095 --> 00:02:56,306
Wait.

44
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:03,808
Aren't you worried about

45
00:03:03,824 --> 00:03:05,433
losing an spare key?

46
00:03:05,582 --> 00:03:07,394
No, not so far.

47
00:03:07,621 --> 00:03:08,683
Hmm?

48
00:03:11,503 --> 00:03:13,356
I never thought I'd end up dating him,

49
00:03:13,381 --> 00:03:14,631
living with him,

50
00:03:17,503 --> 00:03:20,135
having mornings like this.

51
00:03:25,488 --> 00:03:27,433
Well, I'm going this way.

52
00:03:28,066 --> 00:03:29,402
Contact me when you're done.

53
00:03:29,886 --> 00:03:30,503
Got it.

54
00:03:34,613 --> 00:03:37,941
Life really is unpredictable.

55
00:04:38,355 --> 00:04:42,620
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 6)

56
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,433
And then,

57
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:46,066
as we've already announced

58
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,206
via social media,

59
00:04:47,230 --> 00:04:48,745
this weekend is the release date

60
00:04:48,761 --> 00:04:50,058
for the new foundation.

61
00:04:50,308 --> 00:04:52,089
Please make sure to distribute samples

62
00:04:52,105 --> 00:04:54,042
according to the customers' skin types

63
00:04:54,746 --> 00:04:57,003
and spread the word as much as possible.

64
00:04:57,449 --> 00:04:58,418
- Yes.
- Yes.

65
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:00,534
Alright, let's keep up

66
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:02,526
the good work with a smile.

67
00:05:02,941 --> 00:05:04,691
- Yes.
- Yes.

68
00:05:09,074 --> 00:05:10,621
Mamiya-san,

69
00:05:10,761 --> 00:05:12,417
your skin looks really radiant today!

70
00:05:12,426 --> 00:05:14,104
Did you do something special?

71
00:05:14,128 --> 00:05:15,307
You look great.

72
00:05:15,323 --> 00:05:17,292
Did something good happen?

73
00:05:17,753 --> 00:05:19,941
No, it's nothing.

74
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:21,753
Ah, maybe it's because I used

75
00:05:21,761 --> 00:05:23,441
the new cream before bed.

76
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:26,246
- Really?
- Really?

77
00:05:28,058 --> 00:05:29,722
Yesterday with Toma…

78
00:05:33,464 --> 00:05:35,285
No way I can say that out loud!

79
00:05:36,457 --> 00:05:37,941
Focus on work! Work!

80
00:05:40,644 --> 00:05:41,863
Good morning!

81
00:05:42,417 --> 00:05:43,573
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

82
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:44,510
Good morning!

83
00:05:44,847 --> 00:05:47,394
You're here to help today, right?

84
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,832
I got a message from Tanouchi-san.

85
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:49,535
Yes.

86
00:05:49,566 --> 00:05:51,151
I want to learn about the work here.

87
00:05:51,152 --> 00:05:53,457
I'll do anything. Please, count on me!

88
00:05:53,769 --> 00:05:54,769
Thank you.

89
00:05:55,566 --> 00:05:56,730
Ah, um, about the other day…

90
00:05:56,738 --> 00:05:59,371
Could you check the product inventory?

91
00:05:59,589 --> 00:06:00,776
If it seems low, please

92
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:02,096
place an additional order.

93
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,785
Got it!

94
00:06:03,847 --> 00:06:04,752
I'll get on it right away!

95
00:06:04,753 --> 00:06:05,425
Ah.

96
00:06:05,519 --> 00:06:07,214
Don't rush too much.

97
00:06:08,113 --> 00:06:09,050
Yes.

98
00:06:10,331 --> 00:06:11,081
Do your best!

99
00:06:11,136 --> 00:06:12,191
I will!

100
00:06:13,441 --> 00:06:14,293
Ah...

101
00:06:19,464 --> 00:06:20,675
Will he be alright?

102
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:26,058
I cleared half of this closet,

103
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:28,168
let's start by organizing your clothes.

104
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,730
Okay, I'll do that.

105
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,171
Ah...

106
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:55,968
This kind of situation...

107
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:58,366
Can't believe this is really happening.

108
00:06:58,898 --> 00:07:00,030
Aren't you going to use

109
00:07:00,046 --> 00:07:01,374
the hangers in the closet?

110
00:07:01,398 --> 00:07:02,140
Huh?

111
00:07:02,999 --> 00:07:04,765
Oh, right.

112
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:08,093
"Right?"

113
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:11,538
Well, my old room only had boxes,

114
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:13,201
so I always folded everything

115
00:07:13,226 --> 00:07:14,266
out of habit.

116
00:07:15,273 --> 00:07:16,288
Hmm?

117
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:17,897
Your folding style is

118
00:07:17,905 --> 00:07:19,046
different from mine.

119
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:20,171
It's fine.

120
00:07:20,718 --> 00:07:21,709
That's how we've always

121
00:07:21,725 --> 00:07:22,819
done it at my place.

122
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:24,595
I'm not complaining.

123
00:07:26,187 --> 00:07:26,999
By the way,

124
00:07:28,523 --> 00:07:30,070
you really keep things neat.

125
00:07:30,843 --> 00:07:32,311
Were you always like this?

126
00:07:34,648 --> 00:07:35,382
Yes.

127
00:07:36,007 --> 00:07:37,398
I've been doing this myself

128
00:07:37,414 --> 00:07:38,476
since I was young.

129
00:07:39,218 --> 00:07:42,046
Wow, that's impressive.

130
00:07:42,734 --> 00:07:44,085
I was in the same room as

131
00:07:44,101 --> 00:07:45,491
my sister when I was little,

132
00:07:45,515 --> 00:07:46,780
my clothes got mixed up with my sister's.

133
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,976
You have a sister?

134
00:07:49,062 --> 00:07:49,788
Yeah.

135
00:07:49,952 --> 00:07:51,155
We got separate rooms

136
00:07:51,171 --> 00:07:53,171
once I started middle school.

137
00:07:53,804 --> 00:07:56,070
What about you, Toma? Any siblings?

138
00:07:57,843 --> 00:08:00,296
Well, I don't know. Maybe?

139
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:02,999
Oh, I'll go start the bath.

140
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:04,851
Oh, thanks.

141
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,249
Natsume-san, would you like

142
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,718
to take a bath together?

143
00:08:11,062 --> 00:08:13,109
What? Are you crazy?

144
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:14,562
Just kidding.

145
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:16,265
But only for today.

146
00:08:40,835 --> 00:08:43,147
You're still so dedicated to your work.

147
00:08:44,397 --> 00:08:45,194
Hmm?

148
00:08:46,429 --> 00:08:47,187
Well,

149
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:48,326
since becoming the chief,

150
00:08:48,335 --> 00:08:49,515
I have a lot more to handle.

151
00:08:50,094 --> 00:08:52,483
I barely have time to take notes,

152
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:54,483
so

153
00:08:54,843 --> 00:08:56,686
I'm making sure I remember today's

154
00:08:56,694 --> 00:08:59,022
customers' details while they're fresh.

155
00:09:00,843 --> 00:09:02,647
You haven't change since you became chief.

156
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,843
A workaholic.

157
00:09:04,726 --> 00:09:06,186
You also have a lot of

158
00:09:06,195 --> 00:09:07,635
regular customers.

159
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:09,796
Many people who go out of

160
00:09:09,804 --> 00:09:11,327
their way to come to see you.

161
00:09:11,913 --> 00:09:13,999
Not as many as you, Natsume-san.

162
00:09:14,983 --> 00:09:16,327
Because you, Natsume-san,

163
00:09:16,851 --> 00:09:19,421
have a lot of things I don't have.

164
00:09:20,944 --> 00:09:21,999
What do you mean?

165
00:09:22,976 --> 00:09:23,757
Let's sleep.

166
00:09:24,444 --> 00:09:26,124
I have an early shift tomorrow.

167
00:09:27,593 --> 00:09:29,202
Wait a minute.

168
00:09:35,496 --> 00:09:36,887
Umm...

169
00:09:37,444 --> 00:09:38,218
Toma,

170
00:09:39,772 --> 00:09:41,054
I'll be in your care from now on.

171
00:09:44,757 --> 00:09:45,733
What's that all of a sudden?

172
00:09:46,679 --> 00:09:47,999
I just felt like

173
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:51,116
I hadn't properly said it.

174
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:02,178
Likewise.

175
00:10:02,513 --> 00:10:04,021
I'll be in your care from now on.

176
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:14,101
Hand it over.

177
00:10:14,210 --> 00:10:14,765
Mmm.

178
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:15,890
Here.

179
00:10:16,288 --> 00:10:17,569
- Please keep it for me.
- Yeah.

180
00:10:18,788 --> 00:10:19,687
Alright.

181
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,404
If there are things Toma

182
00:10:21,413 --> 00:10:23,093
doesn't have that I do…

183
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,772
I'll give them to him as much as I can.

184
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:32,913
Being together

185
00:10:34,023 --> 00:10:34,968
must mean…

186
00:10:36,593 --> 00:10:38,023
That's what it means.

187
00:10:43,148 --> 00:10:44,390
After that, the PR event

188
00:10:44,398 --> 00:10:46,198
for the new product began…

189
00:10:46,804 --> 00:10:48,101
Sahashi returned to

190
00:10:48,117 --> 00:10:49,936
our store for a brief time.

191
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:51,163
Wow!

192
00:10:51,249 --> 00:10:52,514
So happy to see Sahashi-san

193
00:10:52,523 --> 00:10:53,609
doing touch-ups!

194
00:10:53,835 --> 00:10:55,460
It's been a while since I've seen you

195
00:10:55,498 --> 00:10:57,310
side by side with Mamiya-san.

196
00:10:58,656 --> 00:10:59,546
Like this?

197
00:10:59,765 --> 00:11:01,140
- Wow!
- Wow!

198
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,014
- W princes!
- W princes!

199
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:05,444
- I'm so happy.
- You two look really nice.

200
00:11:05,569 --> 00:11:06,584
How is it?

201
00:11:06,585 --> 00:11:07,492
- As expected,
- Umm...

202
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:10,225
- customers are happy when he's around.
- I want to try other colors.

203
00:11:10,249 --> 00:11:11,757
Yes, I'll bring some for you.

204
00:11:11,812 --> 00:11:12,984
Yes.

205
00:11:13,194 --> 00:11:14,632
A moment, please.

206
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:17,541
Umm...

207
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:18,931
Thanks for your hard work.

208
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:20,088
Thanks for your hard work.

209
00:11:20,127 --> 00:11:21,829
Actually, I've brought some additional

210
00:11:21,837 --> 00:11:23,423
samples of the new foundation.

211
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:26,080
Thank you.

212
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:27,486
And...

213
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:31,127
Thank you for the meal the other day.

214
00:11:31,455 --> 00:11:32,361
Not at all.

215
00:11:33,674 --> 00:11:35,408
I'm finally able to thank you.

216
00:11:35,588 --> 00:11:37,024
I'm glad you're feeling better.

217
00:11:37,025 --> 00:11:37,689
Yes.

218
00:11:37,978 --> 00:11:40,103
I'll keep doing my best in my own way.

219
00:11:40,939 --> 00:11:42,119
- Do your best.
- Yes.

220
00:11:42,306 --> 00:11:43,103
See you.

221
00:12:08,463 --> 00:12:09,572
Hey, what's going on?

222
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:10,377
Huh?

223
00:12:11,478 --> 00:12:13,127
Did something happen between you two?

224
00:12:16,197 --> 00:12:17,549
Actually, the other day…

225
00:12:17,931 --> 00:12:20,291
Mamiya-san invited me to a dinner.

226
00:12:21,259 --> 00:12:22,025
What?

227
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,658
Do you happen to like Natsume-san?

228
00:12:25,736 --> 00:12:26,369
Huh?

229
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,408
Like?

230
00:12:30,189 --> 00:12:31,103
Yes.

231
00:12:33,478 --> 00:12:35,705
I really admire him as a person.

232
00:12:36,275 --> 00:12:37,228
I admire him.

233
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:40,611
Admire...

234
00:12:42,705 --> 00:12:45,330
Did I say something weird?

235
00:12:46,689 --> 00:12:47,705
Not really.

236
00:12:47,994 --> 00:12:49,791
You've got a good eye.

237
00:12:51,627 --> 00:12:53,002
But nothing more than that.

238
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,525
He's mine.

239
00:12:55,267 --> 00:12:55,978
Huh?

240
00:12:56,994 --> 00:12:57,877
"Mine?"

241
00:12:59,049 --> 00:13:00,689
- That means...
- Sahashi.

242
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:02,025
- A moment?
- Yes.

243
00:13:02,127 --> 00:13:03,056
Sorry.

244
00:13:03,711 --> 00:13:05,329
A customer mentioned they're interested

245
00:13:05,353 --> 00:13:07,829
in the overseas limited edition colors.

246
00:13:08,633 --> 00:13:09,859
They just came out recently,

247
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,884
I guess it's these?

248
00:13:10,908 --> 00:13:12,150
Ah, yes.

249
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:13,547
But that customer seems

250
00:13:13,555 --> 00:13:14,674
to be a collector,

251
00:13:14,698 --> 00:13:15,734
maybe it's better to find

252
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,173
goods that are available.

253
00:13:17,197 --> 00:13:18,955
Then these?

254
00:13:18,994 --> 00:13:20,025
The same set?

255
00:13:20,619 --> 00:13:22,189
The Ginza store should have it,

256
00:13:22,197 --> 00:13:23,197
I'll check.

257
00:13:23,564 --> 00:13:25,197
Thank you.

258
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:27,142
Having knowledge about

259
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:28,720
limited editions is a big plus.

260
00:13:29,236 --> 00:13:30,447
I'm glad you're here.

261
00:13:31,002 --> 00:13:32,322
Really? I'm glad.

262
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,143
Yeah.

263
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,822
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

264
00:13:37,626 --> 00:13:40,181
Umm, I'd like to try a new lipstick.

265
00:13:40,377 --> 00:13:41,307
Both of them?

266
00:13:41,377 --> 00:13:42,252
- Yes.
- Yes.

267
00:13:42,791 --> 00:13:45,268
- This is the new lipstick.
- I'll test it for you.

268
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,079
Yes.

269
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:47,900
This is the correct one, right?

270
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:54,572
- One color would you like to try first?
- This color, then.

271
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,667
- This color.
- This color, then.

272
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,486
Thanks for your hard work.

273
00:14:18,603 --> 00:14:19,572
Mamiya-san.

274
00:14:19,705 --> 00:14:20,853
Thanks for your hard work.

275
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,635
Harukawa-kun?

276
00:14:23,236 --> 00:14:25,439
Can I have a moment of your time?

277
00:14:26,603 --> 00:14:27,580
Sure.

278
00:14:29,197 --> 00:14:30,064
Huh?

279
00:14:30,807 --> 00:14:33,033
Sahashi said that?

280
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,533
Yes.

281
00:14:35,049 --> 00:14:38,471
Sahashi-san said Mamiya-san 'is mine.'

282
00:14:39,666 --> 00:14:40,924
That guy!

283
00:14:42,752 --> 00:14:44,658
Hearing that

284
00:14:45,666 --> 00:14:48,088
made me feel like it's nice.

285
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:49,791
Huh?

286
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,197
When I heard that from Sahashi-san,

287
00:14:53,650 --> 00:14:54,947
I realized something.

288
00:14:56,064 --> 00:14:58,744
When you're next to Sahashi-san,

289
00:14:59,338 --> 00:15:01,298
you look so happy and

290
00:15:01,323 --> 00:15:03,118
seem more like yourself.

291
00:15:04,744 --> 00:15:05,666
Ah...

292
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:06,947
Really?

293
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:08,064
Yes.

294
00:15:09,478 --> 00:15:11,010
How should I put it?

295
00:15:12,596 --> 00:15:16,260
You're always very serious,

296
00:15:16,908 --> 00:15:18,674
but with Sahashi-san,

297
00:15:19,088 --> 00:15:22,103
you seem much more approachable.

298
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,127
Am I really that different?

299
00:15:26,885 --> 00:15:28,088
Honestly,

300
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:30,986
I was surprised to learn about you two,

301
00:15:32,033 --> 00:15:33,002
but when I see...

302
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,314
how you two sparkle,

303
00:15:35,353 --> 00:15:36,908
I thought it was wonderful.

304
00:15:40,963 --> 00:15:41,791
Ah.

305
00:15:43,244 --> 00:15:45,596
I'm sorry for taking up your time!

306
00:15:46,002 --> 00:15:47,072
Not at all.

307
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,486
I just thought...

308
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:52,665
both of you are wonderful.

309
00:15:53,658 --> 00:15:56,549
I just had to tell you.

310
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:01,244
Is that so?

311
00:16:02,213 --> 00:16:03,385
I'm cheering for you!

312
00:16:04,346 --> 00:16:06,502
I respect both Sahashi-san

313
00:16:06,527 --> 00:16:08,519
and you very much!

314
00:16:11,307 --> 00:16:12,799
If it's just respect,

315
00:16:13,205 --> 00:16:15,541
will Sahashi-san be able to accept it?

316
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:18,439
Yeah.

317
00:16:21,439 --> 00:16:23,072
Harukawa-kun, you are so gentle.

318
00:16:24,705 --> 00:16:25,713
Thank you.

319
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:27,814
Thank you very much!

320
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:31,408
Huh?

321
00:16:43,158 --> 00:16:44,260
Hey, Toma!

322
00:16:44,502 --> 00:16:45,791
Welcome back, Natsuke-san.

323
00:16:45,846 --> 00:16:47,330
Don't say weird things to Harukawa-kun.

324
00:16:47,439 --> 00:16:48,705
Weird things? Like what?

325
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:50,564
Well...

326
00:16:52,174 --> 00:16:53,673
Saying things like 'he's mine'

327
00:16:53,682 --> 00:16:54,682
and so on.

328
00:16:54,674 --> 00:16:56,018
It's the truth.

329
00:16:57,291 --> 00:16:59,049
- Umm...
- But you

330
00:16:59,275 --> 00:17:00,689
secretly went out to dinner

331
00:17:00,714 --> 00:17:02,072
with Harukawa, didn't you?

332
00:17:02,244 --> 00:17:03,158
That is...

333
00:17:03,713 --> 00:17:05,501
Harukawa-kun was making mistakes

334
00:17:05,526 --> 00:17:06,775
many days in a row.

335
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,275
So I went out to dinner with him once.

336
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,642
He was depressed, so I encouraged him.

337
00:17:13,736 --> 00:17:15,260
That's all.

338
00:17:15,830 --> 00:17:18,228
As his boss, it was only natural, right?

339
00:17:18,283 --> 00:17:19,564
Hmm?

340
00:17:20,525 --> 00:17:21,682
Are you mad?

341
00:17:21,846 --> 00:17:23,189
Natsume-san,

342
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:25,525
you don't reject, you praise them,

343
00:17:25,564 --> 00:17:26,891
You accept all their flaws.

344
00:17:26,907 --> 00:17:28,073
It's concerning.

345
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,230
You don't realize it, do you?

346
00:17:29,674 --> 00:17:30,924
Isn't that normal?

347
00:17:32,494 --> 00:17:34,182
I don't easily reject people.

348
00:17:36,463 --> 00:17:38,002
Geez.

349
00:17:39,853 --> 00:17:41,337
You be a little more aware of

350
00:17:41,353 --> 00:17:43,048
being nice with others.

351
00:17:45,877 --> 00:17:47,041
I'll be careful.

352
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,025
So,

353
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:53,666
what did Harukawa say about us?

354
00:17:54,033 --> 00:17:55,994
He said she's going to support us.

355
00:17:56,127 --> 00:17:57,018
Hmm...

356
00:17:57,478 --> 00:17:59,205
If that's the case, then it's fine.

357
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,150
You know,

358
00:18:02,728 --> 00:18:05,502
it was surprising to see someone listening

359
00:18:07,494 --> 00:18:10,338
and accepting us like that.

360
00:18:11,150 --> 00:18:12,525
I'm cheering for you!

361
00:18:12,814 --> 00:18:15,510
I'm rooting for you two.

362
00:18:17,978 --> 00:18:19,533
That's not it.

363
00:18:19,689 --> 00:18:21,268
You should be more mindful

364
00:18:21,314 --> 00:18:24,205
of how others perceive us.

365
00:18:26,932 --> 00:18:28,142
It's true that I

366
00:18:28,573 --> 00:18:30,346
I'm friendly with others.

367
00:18:31,705 --> 00:18:33,744
I don't intend to be nice to everyone,

368
00:18:33,807 --> 00:18:35,893
but maybe you're right.

369
00:18:37,877 --> 00:18:38,783
But...

370
00:18:40,783 --> 00:18:42,049
The special one...

371
00:18:43,517 --> 00:18:44,439
What?

372
00:18:45,822 --> 00:18:46,916
You know it already!

373
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,461
I don't know.

374
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:49,556
So stressed out.

375
00:18:49,557 --> 00:18:51,096
I'm so worried.

376
00:18:51,174 --> 00:18:52,471
You're trying to annoy me.

377
00:18:54,728 --> 00:18:55,775
Natsume-san.

378
00:18:57,782 --> 00:18:58,635
Here.

379
00:19:06,463 --> 00:19:07,447
That's it?

380
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:09,705
You're cooking right now.

381
00:19:10,993 --> 00:19:12,711
I'm sorry that you always have to do it.

382
00:19:12,736 --> 00:19:13,822
I'll help out.

383
00:19:14,244 --> 00:19:15,978
Rather than helping out right now...

384
00:19:20,393 --> 00:19:21,494
Natsume-san,

385
00:19:21,697 --> 00:19:23,470
people like you so easily,

386
00:19:24,385 --> 00:19:25,658
I'll nail you properly even if

387
00:19:25,666 --> 00:19:26,830
I have to exaggerate.

388
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:31,619
Umm...

389
00:19:32,088 --> 00:19:33,088
Toma.

390
00:19:33,697 --> 00:19:34,509
Hmm?

391
00:19:44,275 --> 00:19:45,260
Here, I got this for you.

392
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,119
You shouldn't just

393
00:19:54,197 --> 00:19:55,924
carry your key around like that.

394
00:19:59,174 --> 00:20:00,978
You were worried about that?

395
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:02,588
Well...

396
00:20:03,127 --> 00:20:04,189
It's for the earrings.

397
00:20:04,752 --> 00:20:05,697
And the place.

398
00:20:05,697 --> 00:20:06,571
Even though I'm the senpai,

399
00:20:06,596 --> 00:20:07,947
I'm splitting only half with you.

400
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:10,986
Besides...

401
00:20:14,627 --> 00:20:15,525
It's just like mine.

402
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,463
Natsume-san,

403
00:20:23,814 --> 00:20:25,947
you're being quite proactive lately.

404
00:20:26,103 --> 00:20:26,830
Huh?

405
00:20:27,143 --> 00:20:28,213
Isn't it fine?

406
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,353
Is there a problem with that?

407
00:20:29,572 --> 00:20:30,463
No, there isn't.

408
00:20:31,205 --> 00:20:33,002
Let's have dinner.

409
00:20:33,353 --> 00:20:34,018
Yeah.

410
00:20:34,283 --> 00:20:35,385
I'll help.

411
00:20:35,775 --> 00:20:36,946
Tonight's miso soup is

412
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,205
with nameko mushrooms.

413
00:20:38,471 --> 00:20:39,947
I love nameko mushrooms!

414
00:20:41,432 --> 00:20:42,970
By the way, are you more into

415
00:20:42,995 --> 00:20:44,502
silken or firm tofu?

416
00:20:45,064 --> 00:20:45,822
Firm!

417
00:20:46,096 --> 00:20:47,080
What a relief,

418
00:20:47,205 --> 00:20:48,447
it's firm.

419
00:20:50,268 --> 00:20:51,189
The following week…

420
00:20:51,666 --> 00:20:54,025
The PR event for the foundation ended.

421
00:20:55,158 --> 00:20:57,689
We went back to working

422
00:20:57,705 --> 00:20:59,079
at separate stores.

423
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:00,924
Thank you very much.

424
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:12,611
Mamiya Natsume?

425
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,025
Yes?

426
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,182
Are you the one who has deceived Toma?

427
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:25,705
Huh?

428
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,510
You must be the reason

429
00:21:39,658 --> 00:21:42,697
why Toma is staying with this brand.

430
00:21:44,549 --> 00:21:45,518
Haa...

431
00:21:46,736 --> 00:21:48,080
Such a waste.

432
00:21:49,532 --> 00:21:52,259
There are more suitable places for him.

433
00:21:55,471 --> 00:21:56,439
Umm...

434
00:21:57,181 --> 00:21:58,908
Are you acquainted with Sahashi?

435
00:21:58,939 --> 00:22:00,885
Anyway, Mamiya Natsume,

436
00:22:02,103 --> 00:22:04,674
you and Toma are far too mismatched.

437
00:22:07,564 --> 00:22:08,635
It's about to overflow!

438
00:22:11,666 --> 00:22:12,861
You surprised me.

439
00:22:13,971 --> 00:22:15,228
Welcome back.

440
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,002
You're late.

441
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:17,908
Yeah.

442
00:22:17,947 --> 00:22:19,291
I've been working overtime.

443
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:24,158
Hey.

444
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:27,564
Today, someone who seemed like

445
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:29,330
a fan of yours came by the store.

446
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:33,392
And said that you'd be better suited

447
00:22:33,408 --> 00:22:35,158
for somewhere other than Romy.

448
00:22:38,611 --> 00:22:39,447
A man?

449
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,744
Yes.

450
00:22:41,627 --> 00:22:42,611
He was

451
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:44,486
about this tall,

452
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:48,228
with hair like this.

453
00:22:48,768 --> 00:22:50,416
Always wearing sunglasses.

454
00:22:52,049 --> 00:22:53,822
That's probably someone I know.

455
00:22:54,728 --> 00:22:55,432
Huh?

456
00:22:55,619 --> 00:22:56,703
Can I come pick you up

457
00:22:56,711 --> 00:22:57,626
starting from tomorrow?

458
00:22:57,650 --> 00:22:59,424
I think he'll come back.

459
00:23:00,018 --> 00:23:01,736
Yeah. Sure.

460
00:23:02,010 --> 00:23:03,275
By the way, Natsume-san

461
00:23:03,946 --> 00:23:06,008
you really attract a lot of attention.

462
00:23:13,213 --> 00:23:14,057
Nevermind.

463
00:23:14,603 --> 00:23:15,306
Huh?

464
00:23:16,041 --> 00:23:17,189
Even if I kiss you now,

465
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:18,556
you seem distracted.

466
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:21,572
It's not a big deal, so don't worry.

467
00:23:22,822 --> 00:23:23,666
Yeah.

468
00:23:24,728 --> 00:23:25,697
I got it.

469
00:23:29,345 --> 00:23:30,736
Mamiya Natsume,

470
00:23:31,674 --> 00:23:34,213
you and Toma are far too mismatched.

471
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:41,518
(Next episode)
Toma.

472
00:23:41,572 --> 00:23:42,994
Let's go back to New York together.

473
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:45,533
I can't get that person out of my head.

474
00:23:45,643 --> 00:23:47,868
Mamiya Natsume, what can you do?

475
00:23:47,893 --> 00:23:48,696
Toma.

476
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,275
You should go to New York.

477
00:23:50,393 --> 00:23:52,202
You really like doing that.

478
00:23:52,203 --> 00:23:53,445
Making decisions about other people.

479
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,025
It was for your own sake...

480
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,736
Then stay by my side.

481
00:23:56,807 --> 00:23:57,791
I...

482
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,307
can't do anything...

483
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:00,875
for you at all.
