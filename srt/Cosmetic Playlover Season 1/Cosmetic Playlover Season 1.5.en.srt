1
00:00:06,031 --> 00:00:06,992
Looks great.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:08,788
Sakashi-kun, next, hold this bag.

3
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:13,672
I started modeling during university.

4
00:00:15,094 --> 00:00:16,797
I was scouted and

5
00:00:18,664 --> 00:00:20,031
I started to believe

6
00:00:20,056 --> 00:00:21,736
I could really do this.

7
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:22,718
Okay, check first.

8
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:23,586
But...

9
00:00:24,844 --> 00:00:25,703
Huh?

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:28,898
There's a detailed report about

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,032
you taking a woman home…

12
00:00:31,602 --> 00:00:33,563
It's caught the attention of the sponsors.

13
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:37,359
Female troubles are a big no-no.

14
00:00:38,602 --> 00:00:40,086
I had no recollection of such an incident.

15
00:00:41,367 --> 00:00:43,148
I was dropped from the job.

16
00:00:45,813 --> 00:00:48,109
I knew it was a setup by a senpai.

17
00:00:49,633 --> 00:00:51,344
Even if I took it seriously,

18
00:00:51,875 --> 00:00:53,633
I was dragged down by others.

19
00:00:59,211 --> 00:01:00,469
If that's the case, then I...

20
00:01:01,781 --> 00:01:02,977
won't take things seriously.

21
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:06,695
Good morning.

22
00:01:06,969 --> 00:01:08,297
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

23
00:01:08,656 --> 00:01:09,983
Let me introduce you,

24
00:01:09,984 --> 00:01:11,343
- I became a BA because I thought
- This is Sahashi Toma.

25
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:13,203
working in a female-dominated

26
00:01:13,211 --> 00:01:14,991
- environment would keep me out of
- I look forward to working with you.

27
00:01:15,008 --> 00:01:16,351
the reach of male seniors.

28
00:01:16,563 --> 00:01:17,742
- I look forward to working with you.
- I look forward to working with you.

29
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:18,633
But...

30
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:20,516
This is Mamiya-kun, your mentor.

31
00:01:20,688 --> 00:01:21,960
He's an excellent senior,

32
00:01:21,985 --> 00:01:23,185
so rely on him.

33
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,688
I'm Mamiya Natsu.

34
00:01:26,351 --> 00:01:27,132
Nice to meet you!

35
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:30,750
And here too, there's a male senpai.

36
00:01:35,609 --> 00:01:36,421
Hey.

37
00:01:36,422 --> 00:01:38,202
Sakashi-kun, why did you become a BA?

38
00:01:38,336 --> 00:01:39,656
Why did you choose Romy?

39
00:01:40,397 --> 00:01:42,529
- My impression was that he loved
- Do you prefer skincare or makeup?

40
00:01:42,555 --> 00:01:43,547
his job and was very caring.

41
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:44,938
- And...
- Oh,

42
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:46,336
sorry!

43
00:01:47,242 --> 00:01:49,414
I'm just excited to have a male junior.

44
00:01:49,547 --> 00:01:50,507
It's my first time.

45
00:01:50,797 --> 00:01:51,977
He seemed a bit annoying.

46
00:01:52,859 --> 00:01:54,492
There may be many difficulties,

47
00:01:55,125 --> 00:01:56,297
but I will help you.

48
00:01:56,773 --> 00:01:57,835
If there is anything you

49
00:01:57,859 --> 00:01:59,390
don't understand, please ask.

50
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,070
Well...

51
00:02:01,071 --> 00:02:02,250
Yes?

52
00:02:03,492 --> 00:02:04,590
Do people often tell you

53
00:02:04,615 --> 00:02:05,747
that you're annoying?

54
00:02:05,772 --> 00:02:06,499
Huh?

55
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:09,273
And I'm sure

56
00:02:10,359 --> 00:02:12,398
this guy will treat me just like

57
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:14,766
aLL the male senpais I've ever had.

58
00:02:14,805 --> 00:02:15,750
Sahashi!

59
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:17,336
You're really good at touch-ups.

60
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:18,516
Yeah, yeah.

61
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,015
Wait!

62
00:02:22,344 --> 00:02:23,250
Smile!

63
00:02:25,008 --> 00:02:26,969
You're tall,

64
00:02:27,429 --> 00:02:28,539
you should act a little more cheerful,

65
00:02:28,564 --> 00:02:29,594
customers will find you

66
00:02:29,617 --> 00:02:30,381
more approachable.

67
00:02:30,406 --> 00:02:31,461
He's just nitpicking

68
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:33,157
and criticizing again.

69
00:02:33,727 --> 00:02:35,570
Fine, got it.

70
00:02:35,867 --> 00:02:36,703
Great!

71
00:02:36,914 --> 00:02:37,969
That's all.

72
00:02:38,789 --> 00:02:41,063
You're quick and can bring in sales.

73
00:02:41,961 --> 00:02:45,313
I think you have a lot of potential.

74
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:48,554
Is that it?

75
00:02:48,585 --> 00:02:50,562
I have to get back,

76
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,844
my break is almost over.

77
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,875
See you!

78
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:00,859
How's the finish?

79
00:03:00,938 --> 00:03:02,094
It's really cute!

80
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:03,258
I'm glad.

81
00:03:04,093 --> 00:03:05,961
This product might be a bit matte

82
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:07,937
from what you're used to.

83
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:09,273
But it turned out well.

84
00:03:09,937 --> 00:03:11,093
This lipstick

85
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,047
is quite dark

86
00:03:13,633 --> 00:03:15,320
but it goes well with this makeup look.

87
00:03:18,758 --> 00:03:20,578
How's Sakashi-kun doing?

88
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,086
He seems to be a handful, right?

89
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,125
No,

90
00:03:24,883 --> 00:03:28,477
Sakashi is skilled, smart, and talented.

91
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,906
I hope he keeps growing

92
00:03:30,931 --> 00:03:32,906
and brings in more sales.

93
00:03:33,695 --> 00:03:34,695
That's good to hear.

94
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:38,195
Seeing him grow as a BA

95
00:03:38,391 --> 00:03:39,773
makes me happy.

96
00:03:40,633 --> 00:03:43,023
I need to work hard not to fall behind.

97
00:03:43,938 --> 00:03:45,000
Do your best.

98
00:03:45,429 --> 00:03:46,702
Ah, would you like coffee?

99
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,367
What's with this person?

100
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:53,148
Also, you're getting good results,

101
00:03:53,313 --> 00:03:55,477
- so if you get motivated...
- Yes, yes, I know.

102
00:03:56,063 --> 00:03:57,297
Why does he have such

103
00:03:57,321 --> 00:03:58,382
expectations for me

104
00:03:58,406 --> 00:04:01,241
- and take me so seriously?
- You're too meddlesome.

105
00:04:01,632 --> 00:04:02,398
But I...

106
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:05,413
have never lied to you about work.

107
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,241
Being around him makes me

108
00:04:07,273 --> 00:04:08,553
want to believe.

109
00:04:10,813 --> 00:04:12,109
As I expected...

110
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:14,273
I want to possess him.

111
00:04:15,336 --> 00:04:16,305
I felt that way.

112
00:04:18,531 --> 00:04:19,640
That's why…

113
00:04:19,703 --> 00:04:21,969
I can't do everything like you can!

114
00:04:23,039 --> 00:04:25,188
I didn't want to hear those words.

115
00:04:35,492 --> 00:04:36,406
Bonjour.

116
00:04:36,469 --> 00:04:37,116
Bonjour.

117
00:04:37,117 --> 00:04:39,593
If my being is rejected by Natsume-san,

118
00:04:40,461 --> 00:04:41,789
there will be no place for me

119
00:04:41,813 --> 00:04:42,851
to respect him.

120
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:45,711
No matter how you look at it,

121
00:04:46,516 --> 00:04:48,492
he's the impressive one.

122
00:04:53,781 --> 00:04:54,773
Ah...

123
00:04:54,827 --> 00:04:57,913
(Out of signal area)

124
00:05:53,914 --> 00:05:57,953
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 5)

125
00:05:58,617 --> 00:06:00,984
I took several days off due to illness,

126
00:06:01,344 --> 00:06:02,578
I'm sorry!

127
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:05,664
What are you talking about?

128
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,891
You were working too hard, Chief.

129
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:09,007
We were actually relieved

130
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:10,234
that you took a break.

131
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:11,055
Exactly.

132
00:06:11,289 --> 00:06:13,234
You can delegate more work to us.

133
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:15,726
You handled all the event

134
00:06:15,751 --> 00:06:17,618
wrap-up by yourself, right?

135
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:20,063
You need to go home when you're sick.

136
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:22,500
You're still terrible

137
00:06:22,525 --> 00:06:24,045
at asking for help.

138
00:06:24,727 --> 00:06:26,188
Thank you.

139
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:28,437
Ah, I've been neglecting

140
00:06:28,462 --> 00:06:30,086
people surroundings me again.

141
00:06:34,563 --> 00:06:35,531
Take care.

142
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:37,008
‘Senpai.'

143
00:06:38,297 --> 00:06:39,977
It's been three days since then.

144
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:41,991
I haven't had the chance to apologize.

145
00:06:42,414 --> 00:06:44,648
Sahashi went to Paris for training.

146
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:47,546
And even if I send a message,

147
00:06:47,562 --> 00:06:48,762
he won't reply.

148
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:52,219
Natsume-kun,

149
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,664
you're feeling better?

150
00:06:54,109 --> 00:06:55,328
Good morning.

151
00:06:55,961 --> 00:06:57,820
I'm sorry for the trouble.

152
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,305
You've been so busy,

153
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:00,484
but don't push yourself.

154
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:03,641
And thank you for taking on the event.

155
00:07:03,883 --> 00:07:04,625
No, it's fine.

156
00:07:04,742 --> 00:07:06,320
By the way,

157
00:07:06,352 --> 00:07:07,508
we're having a dinner

158
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,773
with Emma Lauren soon.

159
00:07:08,797 --> 00:07:10,398
Would you like to join?

160
00:07:11,102 --> 00:07:11,930
Huh?

161
00:07:12,914 --> 00:07:13,859
I'd love to!

162
00:07:14,109 --> 00:07:14,992
Emma...

163
00:07:15,133 --> 00:07:16,531
Emma Lauren.

164
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,469
She's our brand's top makeup artist

165
00:07:19,633 --> 00:07:21,117
and is coming from Paris.

166
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,531
I'll let you know the details later.

167
00:07:23,844 --> 00:07:25,336
Thank you!

168
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,664
I get to meet Emma Lauren?

169
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:31,578
Then, please take care of Harukawa-kun.

170
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:32,688
Yes.

171
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,687
I'll give you the samples…

172
00:07:34,719 --> 00:07:35,367
- Oh!
- Oh!

173
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,281
Wait...

174
00:07:36,406 --> 00:07:37,086
Sorry!

175
00:07:38,469 --> 00:07:39,922
- I'm always messing up…
- Are you okay?

176
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,117
It's always like this.

177
00:07:41,742 --> 00:07:42,531
I'm sorry.

178
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:49,859
I'm really sorry for everything today!

179
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,383
It's okay.

180
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:54,734
Here.

181
00:07:54,781 --> 00:07:55,898
Thank you.

182
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,617
At the previous event,

183
00:08:01,016 --> 00:08:04,375
if it weren't for Sahashi-san's help...

184
00:08:05,719 --> 00:08:06,820
Sahashi?

185
00:08:07,219 --> 00:08:08,179
What do you mean?

186
00:08:09,273 --> 00:08:10,617
On the second day of the event,

187
00:08:10,883 --> 00:08:12,491
when I was rushing to deliver

188
00:08:12,516 --> 00:08:14,319
extra samples and limited editions.

189
00:08:16,031 --> 00:08:16,859
Whoa!

190
00:08:17,766 --> 00:08:18,813
Are you okay?

191
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:21,078
Thank you.

192
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:28,679
Are you Harukawa from sales?

193
00:08:28,719 --> 00:08:29,312
Huh?

194
00:08:29,313 --> 00:08:30,758
Oh, yes.

195
00:08:31,499 --> 00:08:32,937
How do you know me?

196
00:08:34,343 --> 00:08:35,789
I used to work as a BA

197
00:08:35,805 --> 00:08:37,070
with Natsume-san here.

198
00:08:37,095 --> 00:08:37,976
I'm on the early shift,

199
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:38,960
so I came to check.

200
00:08:38,984 --> 00:08:39,943
Are you

201
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:41,461
Sahashi-san?

202
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:44,086
I heard you and Mamiya-san

203
00:08:44,094 --> 00:08:45,586
were the ‘W Princes'!

204
00:08:46,477 --> 00:08:47,992
It's an honor to meet you!

205
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:49,460
You're amazing.

206
00:08:49,694 --> 00:08:51,163
I'm not impressive,

207
00:08:51,289 --> 00:08:52,859
it's Natsume-san who's great.

208
00:08:53,186 --> 00:08:54,038
Thank you.

209
00:08:54,047 --> 00:08:54,789
Huh?

210
00:08:55,008 --> 00:08:56,180
But, Sahashi-san,

211
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,805
even as a new BA,

212
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,804
but you're top in sales

213
00:09:00,172 --> 00:09:01,563
and your makeup is amazing.

214
00:09:03,016 --> 00:09:04,461
Anything I can do,

215
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:06,535
he can do too.

216
00:09:10,023 --> 00:09:10,805
Huh?

217
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:13,218
He's the kind of person who makes people

218
00:09:13,226 --> 00:09:15,054
want to lend a helping hand to him.

219
00:09:17,313 --> 00:09:20,758
You respect him very much, don't you?

220
00:09:22,008 --> 00:09:23,570
Because he was the first person

221
00:09:23,578 --> 00:09:24,858
to support me.

222
00:09:25,086 --> 00:09:25,648
Huh?

223
00:09:27,359 --> 00:09:28,281
By the way,

224
00:09:30,147 --> 00:09:32,989
can you not put an unnecessary
burden on Natsume-san?

225
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,727
He's kind,

226
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,273
too serious and

227
00:09:38,289 --> 00:09:39,453
keeps all the problems to himself,

228
00:09:39,477 --> 00:09:40,789
so handle your own work.

229
00:09:42,539 --> 00:09:43,468
I'm sorry.

230
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:45,438
First, observe your surroundings.

231
00:09:45,992 --> 00:09:46,945
Don't rush.

232
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,930
Don't do more than you can handle.

233
00:09:49,883 --> 00:09:50,594
Yes.

234
00:09:50,883 --> 00:09:52,601
If you need advice, ask me,

235
00:09:52,626 --> 00:09:53,812
not Natsume-san.

236
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:55,156
Yes.

237
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:57,195
But why?

238
00:09:57,461 --> 00:09:59,336
I just want Natsume-san to focus on

239
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:00,554
what's in front of him.

240
00:10:01,305 --> 00:10:02,406
Aren't you in a hurry?

241
00:10:03,319 --> 00:10:04,453
- That's what happened.
- You're right.

242
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:05,383
Excuse me.

243
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:09,702
Sahashi-san made me realize

244
00:10:11,016 --> 00:10:14,281
I was relying too much on Mamiya-san.

245
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,055
That guy...

246
00:10:16,773 --> 00:10:18,711
did all that without me knowing.

247
00:10:21,695 --> 00:10:22,742
Mamiya-san?

248
00:10:23,813 --> 00:10:25,016
Ah, sorry.

249
00:10:27,203 --> 00:10:30,156
Sahashi was exaggerating.

250
00:10:32,516 --> 00:10:33,242
I...

251
00:10:33,906 --> 00:10:35,297
I remember when I was a

252
00:10:35,322 --> 00:10:37,002
newcomer when I see you.

253
00:10:38,615 --> 00:10:42,349
I was very motivated at that time.

254
00:10:44,224 --> 00:10:45,045
Besides,

255
00:10:45,357 --> 00:10:47,584
you brighten up the surroundings.

256
00:10:48,998 --> 00:10:50,334
That brightness,

257
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,271
I hope that will never change.

258
00:10:54,896 --> 00:10:56,271
I think I understand what

259
00:10:56,296 --> 00:10:57,591
Sahashi-san was saying.

260
00:10:59,224 --> 00:11:00,982
That Mamiya-san is amazing!

261
00:11:13,662 --> 00:11:14,498
That guy...

262
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,810
He understood everything

263
00:11:16,835 --> 00:11:17,865
and accepted me.

264
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,473
(Sorry for earlier
Good luck with the training)

265
00:11:27,474 --> 00:11:28,849
(Don't push yourself too hard)
All unread.

266
00:11:31,970 --> 00:11:33,321
I'll send something.

267
00:11:34,548 --> 00:11:35,993
But if I apologized too much,

268
00:11:36,009 --> 00:11:37,110
it wouldn't be good.

269
00:11:39,103 --> 00:11:39,947
Right.

270
00:11:44,326 --> 00:11:49,302
(How are you? I'm going to have a meal
with Emma Lauren)

271
00:11:49,506 --> 00:11:51,631
Alright.

272
00:12:03,353 --> 00:12:04,563
Tanouchi-san?

273
00:12:07,356 --> 00:12:09,214
(The dinner with Emma Lauren is at
Ginza Grand Royal Maison Hotel)

274
00:12:09,239 --> 00:12:10,935
(June 13th, 8:30 PM. Please confirm!)

275
00:12:12,767 --> 00:12:13,642
Oh no.

276
00:12:14,688 --> 00:12:17,438
That's Sahashi's return date…

277
00:12:22,359 --> 00:12:24,648
I can't do everything like you can!

278
00:12:25,766 --> 00:12:27,032
So that's how you feel.

279
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:35,555
For formal makeup,

280
00:12:35,571 --> 00:12:36,836
Natsume-san is the expert.

281
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,305
- Because he never shows an effot
- Right, Natsume-san?

282
00:12:39,328 --> 00:12:40,883
and does everything so effortlessly.

283
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:42,267
You...

284
00:12:42,946 --> 00:12:44,258
think that just because you can

285
00:12:44,274 --> 00:12:45,260
attract customers with your looks,

286
00:12:45,284 --> 00:12:47,970
- Maybe that's why he's been envied.
- so you can look down on effort?

287
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:50,497
I didn't think that at all.

288
00:12:55,618 --> 00:12:56,720
He must be angry.

289
00:12:58,032 --> 00:12:59,865
Maybe he won't forgive me.

290
00:13:02,056 --> 00:13:03,173
Is he still

291
00:13:03,876 --> 00:13:05,306
willing to meet me?

292
00:13:09,084 --> 00:13:11,474
I understand now what Sahashi-san meant.

293
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,130
That Mamiya-san is amazing!

294
00:13:16,498 --> 00:13:17,310
But

295
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:19,724
when we meet next…

296
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:22,943
I want to be the person

297
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,648
he thought was amazing…

298
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:31,098
For now I'll focus on work!

299
00:13:33,513 --> 00:13:34,763
Thank you very much.

300
00:13:40,412 --> 00:13:41,826
- Takano-san.
- Yes?

301
00:13:41,826 --> 00:13:43,255
I'm heading to the head office now.

302
00:13:43,264 --> 00:13:44,966
Could you check the stock for me?

303
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,381
Sure. Have a good trip.

304
00:13:46,521 --> 00:13:47,958
Thank you. I appreciate it.

305
00:13:47,981 --> 00:13:48,754
Yes.

306
00:13:50,435 --> 00:13:51,365
Has Mamiya-san

307
00:13:51,443 --> 00:13:53,178
changed a bit?

308
00:13:53,576 --> 00:13:55,201
Is he back to his previous self?

309
00:13:55,857 --> 00:13:57,411
Maybe he's feeling pressured now

310
00:13:57,436 --> 00:13:58,466
that he's the Chief.

311
00:13:59,967 --> 00:14:02,271
Thank you for waiting. Is this correct?

312
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:03,240
Yes.

313
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,193
How is your skin condition?

314
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:08,178
My skin is very dry.

315
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,498
I am interested in the booster.

316
00:14:10,154 --> 00:14:11,575
Aizawa-san, could you place

317
00:14:11,607 --> 00:14:13,302
an additional order for samples?

318
00:14:13,326 --> 00:14:14,920
I have a customer inquiry.

319
00:14:15,138 --> 00:14:16,631
Yes, of course.

320
00:14:16,779 --> 00:14:18,748
- Thank you very much.
- I'll do it my way.

321
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,068
Please come again.

322
00:14:21,748 --> 00:14:23,013
Focus on the task at hand.

323
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:28,334
And finally,

324
00:14:30,928 --> 00:14:33,709
tomorrow, he's coming back.

325
00:14:43,638 --> 00:14:44,794
(Sorry for earlier)

326
00:14:44,795 --> 00:14:46,521
Still haven't read.

327
00:14:46,521 --> 00:14:49,013
(Sorry for earlier. Good luck with the
training. Don't push yourself too hard)

328
00:14:49,013 --> 00:14:52,817
(How are you? I'm going to have a meal
with Emma Lauren)

329
00:14:52,818 --> 00:14:56,269
(You're coming home tomorrow, right?)

330
00:14:56,270 --> 00:15:01,052
(I can't pick you up because of the dinner)

331
00:15:01,053 --> 00:15:03,458
(Are you free the day after?)

332
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:05,115
(Are you free the day after?)

333
00:15:05,294 --> 00:15:10,193
(I want to see you)

334
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:13,349
Maybe I'm being too needy?

335
00:15:14,365 --> 00:15:15,365
But still...

336
00:15:17,193 --> 00:15:18,029
(I want to see you)

337
00:15:18,388 --> 00:15:20,912
I sent it!

338
00:15:22,553 --> 00:15:23,670
Maybe I should delete it.

339
00:15:26,295 --> 00:15:27,084
No,

340
00:15:27,935 --> 00:15:29,185
it's fine.

341
00:15:30,287 --> 00:15:32,185
I need to tell Sahashi properly.

342
00:15:38,451 --> 00:15:40,793
My message remained unread

343
00:15:41,739 --> 00:15:42,818
until the next morning.

344
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,303
Your seat is ready. This way, please.

345
00:15:47,771 --> 00:15:49,060
Excuse me.

346
00:15:49,224 --> 00:15:50,373
Thank you very much.

347
00:15:50,802 --> 00:15:52,099
This one may...

348
00:15:52,162 --> 00:15:55,099
- The day was busy with many customers.
- Please come again.

349
00:15:56,201 --> 00:15:58,474
We barely had a moment to breathe,

350
00:15:59,771 --> 00:16:01,131
it was hectic,

351
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:03,295
and the closing time arrived.

352
00:16:04,122 --> 00:16:04,717
Welcome.

353
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:07,115
If we brush here a bit more...

354
00:16:12,443 --> 00:16:13,388
That guy...

355
00:16:13,990 --> 00:16:15,771
should be at the airport by now.

356
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,107
The dinner time.

357
00:16:19,162 --> 00:16:19,982
There you are.

358
00:16:20,662 --> 00:16:22,529
I couldn't get through to you.

359
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:24,217
I'm sorry,

360
00:16:24,396 --> 00:16:25,982
I was at work until now.

361
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,942
I was in the neighborhood.

362
00:16:27,967 --> 00:16:29,959
So, can you make it today?

363
00:16:31,474 --> 00:16:32,279
Ah...

364
00:16:40,662 --> 00:16:42,177
(I want to see you)

365
00:16:42,178 --> 00:16:44,865
(Sahashi: Me too)

366
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:46,599
Are you okay?

367
00:16:50,693 --> 00:16:51,646
I'm sorry!

368
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,287
I can't go!

369
00:16:53,826 --> 00:16:55,276
It's really urgent.

370
00:16:55,896 --> 00:16:56,803
I'm sorry!

371
00:16:57,623 --> 00:16:58,287
Huh?

372
00:16:58,771 --> 00:16:59,888
Natsume-kun!

373
00:17:12,146 --> 00:17:13,099
Toma!

374
00:17:20,107 --> 00:17:20,912
Toma!

375
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:22,888
Sorry.

376
00:17:29,013 --> 00:17:30,318
I was too harsh too.

377
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:34,638
But why are you here?

378
00:17:35,326 --> 00:17:36,724
What about the dinner with Emma?

379
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:38,654
What?

380
00:17:40,615 --> 00:17:41,880
Is it so wrong to prioritize

381
00:17:41,905 --> 00:17:43,025
you over that?

382
00:17:46,709 --> 00:17:47,865
Natsume-san.

383
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:50,060
Don't look at me like that.

384
00:17:51,287 --> 00:17:52,232
I feel like hugging you

385
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,365
and never letting go.

386
00:17:56,748 --> 00:17:57,521
Come.

387
00:18:14,141 --> 00:18:15,055
I...

388
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:18,414
I know you're putting

389
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:19,500
in a lot of effort.

390
00:18:22,485 --> 00:18:24,313
But I'm envious of your talent

391
00:18:27,188 --> 00:18:28,508
and feel inferior…

392
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:35,633
I'm used to being seen that way.

393
00:18:38,688 --> 00:18:40,133
During my model days,

394
00:18:40,954 --> 00:18:43,508
I was targeted by male senpai models.

395
00:18:46,743 --> 00:18:48,891
When I really tried, I was dragged down.

396
00:18:51,243 --> 00:18:51,993
You...

397
00:18:53,469 --> 00:18:54,610
That's why then...

398
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,087
I don't get serious about anything.

399
00:19:01,321 --> 00:19:02,024
Yes.

400
00:19:03,001 --> 00:19:04,923
I thought it's useless to be serious.

401
00:19:08,563 --> 00:19:09,524
But I...

402
00:19:11,126 --> 00:19:13,680
I think Sahashi is really cool!

403
00:19:18,704 --> 00:19:19,844
So, I...

404
00:19:22,227 --> 00:19:25,532
want to stand beside you properly…

405
00:19:29,157 --> 00:19:29,985
But still,

406
00:19:31,711 --> 00:19:34,852
the event without you don't go well,

407
00:19:36,657 --> 00:19:38,016
and I feel pathetic…

408
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,673
I'm sorry for saying such awful things.

409
00:19:52,907 --> 00:19:53,758
But I

410
00:19:55,352 --> 00:19:57,008
really, really like you.

411
00:20:07,337 --> 00:20:08,290
I'm sorry too.

412
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:16,680
It's true I was annoyed by you

413
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:18,385
acting out of character,

414
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:20,423
but I was

415
00:20:22,915 --> 00:20:24,375
really frustrated with myself

416
00:20:24,384 --> 00:20:26,584
when you were sick at that time.

417
00:20:28,110 --> 00:20:29,415
I'm truly sorry.

418
00:20:33,008 --> 00:20:35,149
But you don't understand at all.

419
00:20:39,492 --> 00:20:41,732
Even if you don't try to match me,

420
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,977
I respect you.

421
00:20:47,141 --> 00:20:48,149
Besides,

422
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:54,266
I really like you.

423
00:21:00,985 --> 00:21:03,196
You just called me by name earlier.

424
00:21:05,413 --> 00:21:06,171
Well,

425
00:21:07,508 --> 00:21:09,290
you told me to…

426
00:21:11,157 --> 00:21:12,454
When I was thinking about you,

427
00:21:13,235 --> 00:21:14,469
I just blurted it out.

428
00:21:16,618 --> 00:21:18,477
You were thinking about me all the time?

429
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:20,711
I'm happy.

430
00:21:36,477 --> 00:21:37,618
Let's make up.

431
00:21:40,812 --> 00:21:41,665
Yeah.

432
00:21:44,094 --> 00:21:45,351
Is there anything you want

433
00:21:45,375 --> 00:21:46,352
as an apology?

434
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:47,266
No.

435
00:21:48,837 --> 00:21:49,735
Just seeing you

436
00:21:50,594 --> 00:21:51,594
is enough.

437
00:21:51,798 --> 00:21:52,790
Then...

438
00:21:55,829 --> 00:21:56,946
how about this?

439
00:21:58,188 --> 00:21:59,391
Can I have it back?

440
00:22:03,063 --> 00:22:03,852
Even though

441
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:06,742
I'm like this,

442
00:22:08,493 --> 00:22:09,641
is that okay?

443
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,079
Of course.

444
00:22:23,974 --> 00:22:24,833
Here.

445
00:22:35,415 --> 00:22:36,110
Mhm.

446
00:23:04,282 --> 00:23:05,438
Sahashi.

447
00:23:07,891 --> 00:23:09,094
Call me by my name.

448
00:23:12,305 --> 00:23:13,313
Toma.

449
00:23:19,571 --> 00:23:20,891
Say you like me.

450
00:23:24,462 --> 00:23:25,415
I like you.

451
00:23:30,344 --> 00:23:31,641
To say ‘I like you'…

452
00:23:32,337 --> 00:23:33,594
It's amazing.

453
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:36,250
The heart that was

454
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:37,955
bulky just a moment ago

455
00:23:38,758 --> 00:23:39,766
is now...

456
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:47,422
(Next episode)
I forgot something.

457
00:23:47,438 --> 00:23:50,196
We finally live together now.

458
00:23:50,266 --> 00:23:51,320
Thank you for treating me to

459
00:23:51,344 --> 00:23:52,172
a meal the other day.

460
00:23:52,196 --> 00:23:53,719
Don't tell me you like Natsume-san?

461
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:54,563
Like?

462
00:23:54,891 --> 00:23:55,579
Yes.

463
00:23:55,938 --> 00:23:58,360
If I have what he doesn't have,

464
00:23:58,618 --> 00:24:00,688
from now on, I'll give him
as much as I want.
