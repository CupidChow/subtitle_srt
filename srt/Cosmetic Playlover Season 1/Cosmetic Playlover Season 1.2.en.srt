1
00:00:04,164 --> 00:00:05,188
How is it?

2
00:00:06,578 --> 00:00:07,727
I'll take this!

3
00:00:09,664 --> 00:00:11,000
The colors you choose are

4
00:00:11,008 --> 00:00:12,553
always refreshing, Mamiya-san.

5
00:00:12,578 --> 00:00:13,477
I really like it.

6
00:00:13,975 --> 00:00:15,663
My boyfriend complimented me before too.

7
00:00:15,727 --> 00:00:16,977
Oh, really?

8
00:00:17,117 --> 00:00:18,227
Thank you.

9
00:00:18,391 --> 00:00:19,836
I'll get it ready for you.

10
00:00:19,906 --> 00:00:20,617
Yes, please.

11
00:00:23,219 --> 00:00:24,141
- Natsume-san.
- Oh.

12
00:00:24,445 --> 00:00:25,609
What number is that?

13
00:00:25,758 --> 00:00:27,906
My customer wanted to try it too.

14
00:00:28,344 --> 00:00:29,039
Oh.

15
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,602
Uh...

16
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:32,273
This one.

17
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:33,500
Thanks.

18
00:00:39,359 --> 00:00:40,508
Sorry for the wait.

19
00:00:40,555 --> 00:00:42,570
After the holiday collection event,

20
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,719
Sahashi's attitude towards work

21
00:00:44,735 --> 00:00:45,922
drastically changed,

22
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:47,492
and his sales increased.

23
00:00:48,617 --> 00:00:49,328
Moreover,

24
00:00:49,797 --> 00:00:50,410
the two of us

25
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:52,410
(This year's famous male BA duo)
were featured in industry magazines,

26
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,359
becoming quite a hot topic.

27
00:01:00,266 --> 00:01:01,281
Still...

28
00:01:02,413 --> 00:01:04,015
That thing that happened that night...

29
00:01:13,086 --> 00:01:13,891
I...

30
00:01:14,609 --> 00:01:16,545
Can I get serious about you,

31
00:01:18,414 --> 00:01:20,641
What was that about?

32
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,297
And also...

33
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:27,539
From now on,

34
00:01:27,891 --> 00:01:29,336
be prepared.

35
00:01:35,687 --> 00:01:36,515
Prepared for...

36
00:01:37,836 --> 00:01:39,906
what exactly?

37
00:01:41,422 --> 00:01:42,406
Natsume-san.

38
00:01:43,664 --> 00:01:44,453
Sahashi!

39
00:01:44,914 --> 00:01:46,460
Did you make that, Natsume-san?

40
00:01:46,484 --> 00:01:47,524
That's rare.

41
00:01:48,281 --> 00:01:49,336
Yeah, I felt like it.

42
00:01:50,531 --> 00:01:51,461
By the way,

43
00:01:52,016 --> 00:01:53,953
you've been serious lately.

44
00:01:54,422 --> 00:01:55,765
Chief said it was good

45
00:01:55,789 --> 00:01:57,522
to send you to the event.

46
00:01:58,398 --> 00:01:59,875
That tamagoyaki looks good.

47
00:02:00,422 --> 00:02:01,320
Can I have one?

48
00:02:03,695 --> 00:02:04,750
Mmm...

49
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,477
Natsume-san, you're too wary.

50
00:02:13,984 --> 00:02:15,891
This guy!

51
00:02:15,984 --> 00:02:17,438
Saying he's serious about me,

52
00:02:17,523 --> 00:02:19,078
he's definitely just playing around!

55
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:25,680
Stop getting so close!

56
00:03:25,749 --> 00:03:27,515
Did you change your perfume?

57
00:03:27,867 --> 00:03:29,414
I got a tester the other day.

58
00:03:29,453 --> 00:03:30,508
I see.

59
00:03:30,656 --> 00:03:31,906
This one is nice too.

60
00:03:32,695 --> 00:03:33,875
Stop getting so close!

61
00:03:34,234 --> 00:03:35,320
Good work.

62
00:03:37,523 --> 00:03:38,555
Tanouchi-san?

63
00:03:39,141 --> 00:03:40,109
Good work!

64
00:03:40,516 --> 00:03:41,430
What brings you here?

65
00:03:41,539 --> 00:03:42,976
Oh, I came to restock the powder

66
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:44,313
that was running low.

67
00:03:44,508 --> 00:03:45,203
Yes.

68
00:03:45,523 --> 00:03:48,187
By the way, do you have time after work?

69
00:03:48,484 --> 00:03:49,734
Would you like to grab a drink

70
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:50,766
after a long time?

71
00:03:51,305 --> 00:03:52,750
Yes, I'd love to!

72
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,258
I'll join too.

73
00:03:55,452 --> 00:03:56,172
Huh?

74
00:03:56,328 --> 00:03:57,672
- This guy...
- Yeah.

75
00:03:57,672 --> 00:03:58,609
What does this mean...

76
00:04:06,266 --> 00:04:07,914
This is so awkward.

77
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:10,687
Sahashi-kun, it seems you're doing well

78
00:04:10,703 --> 00:04:11,710
since the event.

79
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:12,797
No,

80
00:04:12,922 --> 00:04:14,805
it's thanks to Natsume-san's guidance.

81
00:04:15,438 --> 00:04:16,516
Right, Natsume-san?

82
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,188
What 'right?'

83
00:04:18,344 --> 00:04:20,180
You never listened to me.

84
00:04:21,054 --> 00:04:23,172
When I first met you, Natsume-kun,

85
00:04:23,234 --> 00:04:24,891
you were so small.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,648
But now you're a full-fledged BA.

87
00:04:28,227 --> 00:04:30,328
No, I'm no that good yet.

88
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:33,625
When did you get your ears pierced?

89
00:04:34,008 --> 00:04:34,711
Oh.

90
00:04:35,195 --> 00:04:38,023
It was about five years ago.

91
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:40,547
Speaking of which,

92
00:04:40,593 --> 00:04:42,101
our fifth wedding anniversary

93
00:04:42,109 --> 00:04:43,351
is coming up soon.

94
00:04:43,421 --> 00:04:44,586
Oh, that's right.

95
00:04:44,695 --> 00:04:47,188
I want to get my wife something nice.

96
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,648
What do you think would be good?

97
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:50,609
Umm...

98
00:04:50,703 --> 00:04:53,539
If it's cosmetics, I can help with that,

99
00:04:54,172 --> 00:04:54,883
Cake...

100
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,250
How about a cake?

101
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,359
A cake would be good, the other day...

102
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:02,953
Thank you very much.

103
00:05:03,617 --> 00:05:04,453
Please.

104
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,438
Yes.

105
00:05:05,922 --> 00:05:08,633
Are you okay? Did he drink too much?

106
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:10,453
I can still drink...

107
00:05:10,727 --> 00:05:11,563
It's fine.

108
00:05:11,852 --> 00:05:13,438
Natsume-san has a day off tomorrow.

109
00:05:13,891 --> 00:05:15,742
Do you have an early start tomorrow?

110
00:05:15,914 --> 00:05:18,063
Should I take Natsume-kun home?

111
00:05:23,875 --> 00:05:25,555
No, I'll take care of him.

112
00:05:26,102 --> 00:05:28,930
You should go home to your wife.

113
00:05:29,828 --> 00:05:30,679
Oh?

114
00:05:31,086 --> 00:05:33,156
Then I'll leave him to you.

115
00:05:33,547 --> 00:05:34,266
Yes.

116
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,281
Thanks for your hard work.

117
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:38,328
Thanks for your hard work.

118
00:05:54,414 --> 00:05:55,313
Huh?

119
00:05:56,305 --> 00:05:57,063
Home?

120
00:05:59,273 --> 00:06:00,313
Are you awake?

121
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:03,703
Sahashi.

122
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:04,922
Why?

123
00:06:05,602 --> 00:06:07,352
You passed out,

124
00:06:07,891 --> 00:06:09,344
so I brought you home.

125
00:06:10,062 --> 00:06:10,906
Sorry.

126
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,266
What about Tanouchi-san?

127
00:06:14,938 --> 00:06:16,258
He went home.

128
00:06:17,898 --> 00:06:18,633
I see.

129
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,383
By the way,

130
00:06:27,086 --> 00:06:29,093
do you really like that guy?

131
00:06:29,789 --> 00:06:30,523
Huh?

132
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:35,429
I was curious about your expression

133
00:06:35,454 --> 00:06:36,852
when you were with him.

134
00:06:37,047 --> 00:06:38,000
But what was that?

135
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,976
How can you smile like that

136
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,703
when he's talking about his wife?

137
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:46,313
It's fine.

138
00:06:47,273 --> 00:06:48,218
I...

139
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,656
as long as Tanouchi-san is happy.

140
00:06:53,094 --> 00:06:54,422
You just said that

141
00:06:55,313 --> 00:06:56,804
because you're scared of getting

142
00:06:56,829 --> 00:06:58,375
hurt and gave up, didn't you?

143
00:07:01,289 --> 00:07:02,546
You have feelings for him,

144
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,796
but you're not brave enough,

145
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,656
yet you still claim to like him.

146
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,500
You're surprisingly cowardly.

147
00:07:17,635 --> 00:07:18,486
Huh?

148
00:07:23,258 --> 00:07:24,672
I told you I'm serious.

149
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:30,352
Don't run away from me,

150
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,445
face me properly.

151
00:07:40,367 --> 00:07:41,343
I'm leaving.

152
00:07:46,912 --> 00:07:48,294
Think carefully about what I meant

153
00:07:48,303 --> 00:07:49,372
by being prepared.

154
00:07:57,256 --> 00:07:58,716
What's with him?

Hello?

What's wrong?

00:08:36,912 --> 00:08:37,982
Umm, Chief,

165
00:08:38,857 --> 00:08:41,591
Mamiya-san is off today, right?

166
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,474
Yes, he is.

167
00:08:43,787 --> 00:08:45,834
We've received multiple

168
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,443
complaint emails.

169
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,865
I had the day off,

170
00:08:58,982 --> 00:09:00,592
but I don't feel like doing anything.

171

172
00:09:04,599 --> 00:09:07,162
how am I supposed to face him?

Tsukimura-sama,

174
00:09:10,513 --> 00:09:11,849
shall I prepare your usual

175

refreshing type of toner?

176
00:09:13,342 --> 00:09:14,099
Yes.

177
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:16,278
Also, I've been concerned about

178
00:09:16,302 --> 00:09:17,474
dark circles lately.

179
00:09:17,787 --> 00:09:18,708
I understand.

180
00:09:19,287 --> 00:09:20,865
In that case, may I remove your makeup

181
00:09:20,889 --> 00:09:22,247
to take a closer look?

182
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:24,060

00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,396
Mamiya speaking.

195
00:10:07,797 --> 00:10:08,617
What?

196
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:10,467
- What happened?
- Whoa!

197
00:10:11,263 --> 00:10:12,825
Don't sneak up on me like that.

198
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:15,302
Who was on the phone?

199
00:10:15,763 --> 00:10:16,950
I don't know, they hung up

200
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:18,114
without saying anything.

201
00:10:19,631 --> 00:10:20,498
Again?

202
00:10:21,217 --> 00:10:21,974
Again?

203
00:10:22,263 --> 00:10:23,388
We've been getting a lot of

204
00:10:23,396 --> 00:10:24,396
silent calls lately.

205
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:28,170
Mamiya, are you free?

206
00:10:28,248 --> 00:10:28,785
Yes.

207
00:10:28,786 --> 00:10:30,193
The chief wants to see you.

208
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:31,756
Okay.

209
00:10:36,645 --> 00:10:38,138
Personal customer service?

210
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:41,498
Actually, we received complaint emails

211
00:10:41,506 --> 00:10:42,786
with your name.

212
00:10:43,614 --> 00:10:44,833
Do you have any idea why?

213
00:10:45,185 --> 00:10:45,974
No.

214
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:49,583
Could it just be harassment?

215
00:10:50,318 --> 00:10:51,599
I'm sorry

216
00:10:52,146 --> 00:10:53,506
for causing trouble.

217
00:11:05,928 --> 00:11:06,748
But...

218
00:11:07,419 --> 00:11:08,786
Why now...

219
00:11:10,146 --> 00:11:11,888
I'm causing trouble for everyone.

220
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:16,474
And then there's Sahashi...

221
00:11:17,357 --> 00:11:18,654
Damn.

222
00:11:19,364 --> 00:11:20,403
My head feels like

223
00:11:20,411 --> 00:11:21,341
it's going to explode.

224
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:22,670
You don't look so good.

225
00:11:24,310 --> 00:11:26,240
What something to eat?

226
00:11:27,903 --> 00:11:28,951
You're overthinking it.

227
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:30,708
Too close.

228
00:11:39,842 --> 00:11:40,599
Sorry

229
00:11:41,404 --> 00:11:42,631
for causing trouble.

230
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:45,678
Natsume-san,

231
00:11:46,599 --> 00:11:47,654
you have an idea

232
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,873
who the culprit is, yes?

233
00:11:55,209 --> 00:11:56,131
No.

234
00:11:57,310 --> 00:11:58,326
Just leave me alone.

235
00:12:01,357 --> 00:12:02,248
I see.

236
00:12:03,442 --> 00:12:04,599
If you want to mope around,

237
00:12:04,607 --> 00:12:05,692
that's your choice,

238
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:07,521
but don't drag me down with you.

239
00:12:09,623 --> 00:12:11,029
I know that.

240
00:12:22,053 --> 00:12:24,217
We're partners, after all.

241
00:12:26,021 --> 00:12:26,818
See you.

242
00:12:36,233 --> 00:12:37,999
(Tuna Mayonnaise Filling)

243
00:12:48,256 --> 00:12:49,927
Welcome, Tsukimura-sama.

244
00:12:50,271 --> 00:12:51,076
Umm...

245
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,833
I have something that needs consultation,
from last time.

246
00:12:53,872 --> 00:12:54,997
If it's alright with me.

247
00:12:57,232 --> 00:12:59,334
Sorry, but this place is...

248
00:13:00,373 --> 00:13:01,498
Can we talk outside?

249
00:13:03,154 --> 00:13:04,365
We can't go outside the store.

250
00:13:04,631 --> 00:13:05,857
Please!

251
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,491
I can only talk to you, Mamiya-san.

252
00:13:11,937 --> 00:13:12,952
I understand.

253
00:13:13,773 --> 00:13:16,218
I'll be on break soon,

254
00:13:16,249 --> 00:13:17,491
so could you wait a little?

255
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:20,171
Yes. Thank you so much!

256
00:13:24,695 --> 00:13:27,241
Are you still employing a BA like that?

257
00:13:29,054 --> 00:13:30,061
Kakizaki-san?

258
00:13:30,491 --> 00:13:31,343
I...

259
00:13:32,257 --> 00:13:33,694
I used to work with Mamiya

260
00:13:33,719 --> 00:13:34,983
at the department store.

261
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,053
He did private consultations

262
00:13:39,163 --> 00:13:40,890
and even stole my customers.

263
00:13:41,687 --> 00:13:42,687
I knew it!

264
00:13:44,101 --> 00:13:46,108
But why now?

265
00:13:47,164 --> 00:13:49,453
He sneaked out with a customer

266
00:13:49,461 --> 00:13:51,179
just a while ago.

267
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:54,195
- That's...
- Before it becomes a problem,

268
00:13:55,914 --> 00:13:58,171
You should hurry up and fire him.

269
00:14:05,539 --> 00:14:07,070
You coward.

270
00:14:11,265 --> 00:14:12,187
Kakizaki-san.

271
00:14:12,562 --> 00:14:14,773
Natsume-san, who was that guy?

272
00:14:16,562 --> 00:14:17,406
Come here.

273
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:21,851
What was this about you

274
00:14:21,875 --> 00:14:23,140
going out with a customer?

275
00:14:25,078 --> 00:14:26,015
That is...

276
00:14:29,672 --> 00:14:31,945
I'm sorry, but I can't say.

277
00:14:33,883 --> 00:14:36,281
That will only raise more suspicion.

278
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:37,398
Is that okay with you?

279
00:14:39,273 --> 00:14:40,226
You

280
00:14:40,531 --> 00:14:42,108
caused a problem at the Shinjuku store

281
00:14:42,117 --> 00:14:43,671
four years ago and were transferred here

282
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:44,827
because of it, right?

283
00:14:46,398 --> 00:14:48,555
I know you're diligent,

284
00:14:48,726 --> 00:14:49,905
but that doesn't mean

285
00:14:49,914 --> 00:14:51,101
everything is allowed.

286
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,273
If anything happens,

287
00:14:53,281 --> 00:14:54,663
you'll be held accountable.

288
00:15:07,015 --> 00:15:08,811
A few days later,

289
00:15:09,413 --> 00:15:10,561
the atmosphere in the store

290
00:15:10,586 --> 00:15:11,523
became tense.

291
00:15:11,554 --> 00:15:12,577
Aizawa-san.

292
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:13,217
Yes?

293
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:14,311
Are these all the eye cream

294
00:15:14,319 --> 00:15:15,420
samples we have?

295
00:15:16,218 --> 00:15:18,655
No, there should be more in the back.

296
00:15:18,757 --> 00:15:20,170
Could you get them when you have time?

297
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:21,523
- Yes.
- I'll get them.

298
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,264
Alright, please do.

299
00:15:24,616 --> 00:15:26,859
Despite the suspicion directed at me,

300
00:15:27,741 --> 00:15:28,999
Only Sahashi

301
00:15:29,413 --> 00:15:30,679
has been acting as usual.

302
00:15:33,601 --> 00:15:34,491
Here you go.

303
00:15:35,359 --> 00:15:36,265
Thanks.

304
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:42,343
(Yamada-san came to the shop on January 21st.
Worried about dry skin)

305
00:15:42,343 --> 00:15:43,882
(Moisturizing Toner, Touch Up )

306
00:15:43,882 --> 00:15:45,906
Natsume-san, you're as serious as ever.

307
00:15:47,601 --> 00:15:48,749
Don't bother with me.

308
00:15:49,523 --> 00:15:51,038
You'll get suspected too.

309
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:53,389
I don't care. We're partners after all.

310
00:15:56,265 --> 00:15:57,148
But...

311
00:15:58,257 --> 00:15:59,702
in front of customers,

312
00:16:02,648 --> 00:16:04,100
you shouldn't show that face.

313
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:16,398
If I show them this...

314
00:16:17,648 --> 00:16:19,311
No, I can't.

315
00:16:20,093 --> 00:16:21,804
I could cause him more trouble.

316
00:16:22,859 --> 00:16:23,952
As expected,

317
00:16:23,977 --> 00:16:25,601
I have to take responsibility.

318
00:16:29,023 --> 00:16:30,820
Excuse me. Is Mamiya-san here?

319
00:16:31,256 --> 00:16:32,202
Welcome.

320
00:16:32,437 --> 00:16:34,046
He's not here at the moment.

321
00:16:35,226 --> 00:16:37,241
Then I'll come back another time.

322
00:16:37,976 --> 00:16:39,960
Um, Tsukimura-sama...

323
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,616
I have something to ask.

324
00:16:45,788 --> 00:16:47,734
Is that guy still employed here?

325
00:16:50,179 --> 00:16:52,053
Chief, you also know

326
00:16:52,671 --> 00:16:54,741
what he did four years ago.

327
00:16:55,788 --> 00:16:57,312
I apologize.

328
00:16:58,273 --> 00:17:01,531
We will handle Mamiya internally.

329
00:17:02,132 --> 00:17:03,140
Chief.

330
00:17:04,218 --> 00:17:05,241
I'm sorry,

331
00:17:06,468 --> 00:17:08,187
I will to speak to him directly.

332
00:17:11,390 --> 00:17:13,632
In order to not disturb others,

333
00:17:14,132 --> 00:17:15,671
could we talk elsewhere?

334
00:17:18,648 --> 00:17:19,819
I'm looking forward to

335
00:17:19,844 --> 00:17:20,991
hearing your excuses.

336
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:23,936
Chief,

337
00:17:25,624 --> 00:17:26,499
everyone...

338
00:17:29,046 --> 00:17:31,866
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

339
00:17:37,249 --> 00:17:38,335
Mamiya-kun.

340
00:17:43,726 --> 00:17:44,811
All the harassment

341
00:17:45,335 --> 00:17:46,765
was your doing, right?

342
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,632
Even four years ago.

343
00:17:53,296 --> 00:17:54,647
You have some nerve saying that

344
00:17:54,671 --> 00:17:56,116
after stealing my customers.

345
00:17:57,756 --> 00:17:58,788
You probably got

346
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,108
transferred here because

347
00:18:00,741 --> 00:18:02,061
that glasses-wearing sales rep

348
00:18:02,086 --> 00:18:03,210
pulled some strings.

349
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,459
I don't know what kind

350
00:18:05,476 --> 00:18:06,624
of relationship you have,

351
00:18:06,648 --> 00:18:08,671
but you suck up to women and men alike.

352
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:11,685
Having someone awful like you around

353
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:14,771
tarnishes the reputation of male BAs.

354
00:18:18,044 --> 00:18:19,435
Just quit already.

355
00:18:21,396 --> 00:18:22,599
If I quit,

356
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,693
will you be satisfied?

357
00:18:27,537 --> 00:18:28,685
If I leave,

358
00:18:29,974 --> 00:18:32,224
no one else will be bothered,

359
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,076
can you promise that?

360
00:18:36,443 --> 00:18:37,536
Why should Natsume-san

361
00:18:37,545 --> 00:18:38,528
be the one to quit?

362
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:42,482
Sahashi.

363
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,982
You...

364
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:46,700
the one who was in the magazine with him.

365
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:47,786
Besides,

366
00:18:48,115 --> 00:18:49,731
I think Natsume-san is the last person

367
00:18:49,748 --> 00:18:51,614
who knows how to suck up to anyone.

368
00:18:53,826 --> 00:18:55,208
Poor you, being stuck with

369
00:18:55,232 --> 00:18:56,216
someone like him.

370
00:18:57,521 --> 00:18:59,990
Who's the real poor one here, I wonder?

371
00:19:02,066 --> 00:19:03,410
Four years ago,

372
00:19:04,879 --> 00:19:06,418
he stole my customer

373
00:19:06,488 --> 00:19:08,277
using underhanded methods.

374
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:10,426
Hayami-sama came to our shop by chance.

375
00:19:10,605 --> 00:19:12,129
There's nothing shady about it!

376
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:13,909
There's no way I can believe that.

377
00:19:14,668 --> 00:19:16,355
This will make it clear.

378
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:17,636
Natsume-san keeps

379
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,949
meticulous customer notes.

380
00:19:18,973 --> 00:19:19,707
Hey.

381
00:19:19,847 --> 00:19:20,581
Where...

382
00:19:20,613 --> 00:19:22,129
Sahashi, stop!

383
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,105
I...

384
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:27,831
I'll explain.

385
00:19:34,738 --> 00:19:35,746
Four years ago,

386
00:19:37,113 --> 00:19:38,348
Hayami-sama

387
00:19:39,738 --> 00:19:41,074
used the oil

388
00:19:42,277 --> 00:19:44,418
you recommended,

389
00:19:46,691 --> 00:19:48,175
then a rash appeared on her face.

390
00:19:51,074 --> 00:19:51,941
So...

391
00:19:52,394 --> 00:19:53,698
She tried

392
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,277
our sensitive skin products after that.

393
00:19:59,658 --> 00:20:00,681
Hayami-sama

394
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:03,769
already said that

395
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,980
she has sensitive skin.

396
00:20:07,861 --> 00:20:11,658
Because she trusted you, Kakizaki-san,

397
00:20:12,939 --> 00:20:14,158
which is why she was so shocked.

398
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:19,392
Oh.

399
00:20:20,066 --> 00:20:21,587
That's on you.

400
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,587
Ignoring a customer's skin condition

401
00:20:23,611 --> 00:20:25,218
because you think the product is good?

402
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:27,360
As a BA, I can't believe it.

403
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,345
It was tough for me too.

404
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:34,759
I was avoided because I'm a man,

405
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:36,665
and the only customer that I have

406
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,244
is Hayami-sama.

407
00:20:38,681 --> 00:20:39,595
Idiot.

408
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:44,149
What you're seeing isn't
the customer, but yourself.

409
00:20:46,282 --> 00:20:47,579
No wonder you couldn't compete

410
00:20:47,595 --> 00:20:48,610
with Natsume-san.

411
00:20:51,978 --> 00:20:53,080
Well, that's how it is.

412
00:20:53,142 --> 00:20:54,189
Excuse us.

413
00:20:55,542 --> 00:20:56,354
Let's go.

414
00:21:06,658 --> 00:21:08,838
I'm not letting you quit, Natsume-san.

415
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:10,478
Huh?

416
00:21:10,939 --> 00:21:12,064
I asked about the situation

417
00:21:12,088 --> 00:21:13,283
from Tsukimura-sama.

418
00:21:14,283 --> 00:21:15,439
I was the one who was

419
00:21:15,455 --> 00:21:16,533
being inappropriate.

420
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:20,267
I had double eyelid surgery

421
00:21:20,853 --> 00:21:22,431
and needed makeup advice

422
00:21:22,455 --> 00:21:23,829
while the scars healed.

423
00:21:25,103 --> 00:21:27,088
How could you do as you like?

424
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,642
That's the customer's privacy!

425
00:21:28,705 --> 00:21:31,025
I knew it. How can someone like you

426
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,736
do personal consultations?

427
00:21:33,322 --> 00:21:34,407
You're too serious and

428
00:21:34,424 --> 00:21:35,728
not good at sucking up to others.

429
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:36,923
If you were doing that,

430
00:21:36,931 --> 00:21:38,103
I would have noticed.

431
00:21:48,071 --> 00:21:50,954
(Tanouchi-san)

432
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:54,486
This person knew everything

433
00:21:54,728 --> 00:21:55,783
about the past, right?

434
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,579
I tried to stay out of it

435
00:22:03,604 --> 00:22:05,604
until the trouble was resolved

436
00:22:07,766 --> 00:22:08,908
but forget it.

437
00:22:12,361 --> 00:22:13,704
I'll reveal everything about you,

438
00:22:13,713 --> 00:22:14,689
Natsume-san.

439
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:21,197
Hello,

440
00:22:21,338 --> 00:22:22,236
this is Sahashi.

441
00:22:23,111 --> 00:22:23,665
Huh?

442
00:22:24,079 --> 00:22:24,861
Oh?

443
00:22:25,369 --> 00:22:26,517
Sahashi-kun?

444
00:22:27,017 --> 00:22:28,056
Where's Natsume-kun?

445
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:31,033
Natsume-san is busy right now.

446
00:22:31,705 --> 00:22:33,704
What are you doing?

447
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:35,244
Yes.

448
00:22:35,666 --> 00:22:36,392
Ah...

449
00:22:36,486 --> 00:22:38,385
Don't worry about that matter.

450
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:41,907
We'll take care of everything.

451
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:46,338
Besides,

452
00:22:47,291 --> 00:22:48,736
this person is mine now.

453
00:22:51,502 --> 00:22:52,127
Huh?

454
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:54,127
Saying that...

455
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:55,118
Goodbye.

456
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,386
Now

457
00:23:05,832 --> 00:23:07,355
let's clear up the misunderstanding

458
00:23:07,371 --> 00:23:08,379
with the chief.

459
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:13,949
Thanks to Sahashi,

460
00:23:15,543 --> 00:23:16,738
the misunderstanding about me

461
00:23:16,746 --> 00:23:17,866
was cleared.

462
00:23:20,027 --> 00:23:21,628
You should have shown the customer notes

463
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:22,769
from the beginning.

464
00:23:24,996 --> 00:23:26,410
The customer trusted me and

465
00:23:26,441 --> 00:23:27,871
told me about those things.

466
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,042
I didn't want to use it

467
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:31,113
for my own defense.

468
00:23:33,347 --> 00:23:34,183
You're too serious,

469
00:23:34,613 --> 00:23:35,410
stubborn,

470
00:23:35,754 --> 00:23:37,402
and awkward. Straight as a ruler.

471
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:41,894
He never doubted me,

472
00:23:42,902 --> 00:23:44,379
always stayed by my side,

473
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:46,316
obstinate,

474
00:23:47,004 --> 00:23:47,965
and overbearing.

475
00:23:49,097 --> 00:23:49,785
But

476
00:23:50,699 --> 00:23:52,386
without him, I...

477
00:23:52,730 --> 00:23:53,582
Sahashi.

478
00:23:58,574 --> 00:23:59,496
Thank you.

479
00:24:08,629 --> 00:24:09,808
You're welcome.

480
00:24:11,066 --> 00:24:12,183
Ah...

481
00:24:13,465 --> 00:24:14,418
I lost.

482
00:24:16,347 --> 00:24:17,636
Since I like the feeling

483
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,120
when I'm with Sahashi,

484
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:22,996
my feelings for Tanouchi

485
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:25,910
might be a little different from love.

486
00:24:28,808 --> 00:24:30,691
Why don't you take off that earring too?

487
00:24:31,799 --> 00:24:33,034
You got it in commemoration of

488
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:34,308
your lost love when Tanouchi-san

489
00:24:34,331 --> 00:24:35,659
got married, didn't you?

490
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,879
You, how...

491
00:24:38,957 --> 00:24:41,332
Here. I'll give it to you instead.

492
00:24:44,254 --> 00:24:45,410
What's this?

493
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,206
Wear this and remember

494
00:24:58,238 --> 00:24:59,870
who you belong to.

495
00:25:01,965 --> 00:25:02,879
Huh?

496
00:25:03,691 --> 00:25:05,355
What? I'm so pissed off!

497
00:25:05,402 --> 00:25:06,816
But I've already declared it

498
00:25:06,832 --> 00:25:08,032
to Tanochi-san.

499
00:25:08,558 --> 00:25:10,152
You're so pushy!

500
00:25:10,175 --> 00:25:11,519
And what's bad about it?

501
00:25:12,277 --> 00:25:12,980
Shut up.

502
00:25:18,148 --> 00:25:18,475
(Next episode)

503
00:25:18,476 --> 00:25:19,893
Have you become a makeup expert?

504
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:21,776
Toma, long time no see.

505
00:25:21,777 --> 00:25:22,589
Risako.

506
00:25:22,596 --> 00:25:23,596
Nanjo-san.

507
00:25:23,847 --> 00:25:25,307
Nice to meet you.

508
00:25:25,332 --> 00:25:26,691
You were with her the other day.

509
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,129
Alone in a hotel.

510
00:25:28,246 --> 00:25:29,332
Making a lonely face

511
00:25:29,348 --> 00:25:30,543
like that isn't good.

512
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,582
I'm really stressed out.

513
00:25:35,074 --> 00:25:36,761
I saw Mamiya-kun looking lonely,

514
00:25:36,777 --> 00:25:38,206
so I sympathized with you.

515
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,542
But the one who really deserved

516
00:25:39,567 --> 00:25:41,254
sympathy might be Sahashi-kun.

517
00:25:41,824 --> 00:25:42,597
I'm so lonely.

518
00:25:42,832 --> 00:25:44,331
And I missed you a lot.

519
00:25:44,613 --> 00:25:45,800
Same here.
