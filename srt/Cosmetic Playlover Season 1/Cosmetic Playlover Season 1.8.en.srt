00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:02,719
Working as a BA makes

2
00:00:03,406 --> 00:00:05,320
the passing of seasons feel so fast.

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:08,500
After summer,

4
00:00:08,867 --> 00:00:10,062
we've already moved on to

5
00:00:10,087 --> 00:00:11,304
the holiday collection

6
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:13,898
after the Christmas season for winter,

7
00:00:14,203 --> 00:00:16,000
and as soon as the new year arrives,

8
00:00:16,313 --> 00:00:17,469
we start preparing for

9
00:00:17,493 --> 00:00:18,656
the spring collection.

10
00:00:20,078 --> 00:00:21,851
If you blend them together like this,

11
00:00:21,867 --> 00:00:23,374
it will look very beautiful.

12
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,641
You're right.

13
00:00:24,945 --> 00:00:25,852
And...

14
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,820
our cohabitation life has already

15
00:00:29,813 --> 00:00:31,359
passed six months.

16
00:00:32,258 --> 00:00:33,016
Huh?

17
00:00:33,187 --> 00:00:34,976
You've been promoted to makeup artist?

18
00:00:35,203 --> 00:00:36,312
I applied just to try,

19
00:00:36,328 --> 00:00:37,677
without any expectations,

20
00:00:37,701 --> 00:00:39,178
but Nanjo-san supported me.

21
00:00:39,203 --> 00:00:41,203
(Makeup artist Sahashi Toma)
That's amazing! So awesome!

22
00:00:41,266 --> 00:00:42,828
You did it, Toma!

23
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,094
Wow!

24
00:00:45,219 --> 00:00:46,875
Come on, be more excited!

25
00:00:47,258 --> 00:00:48,430
I am glad,

26
00:00:48,742 --> 00:00:50,687
but it looks like you're more thrilled.

27
00:00:50,859 --> 00:00:52,008
Of course I'm thrilled!

28
00:00:52,258 --> 00:00:52,969
And...

29
00:00:53,242 --> 00:00:54,758
there's our collaboration stage

30
00:00:54,766 --> 00:00:56,117
at the TSS event, right?

31
00:00:56,383 --> 00:00:58,023
I've been assigned to work there.

32
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,898
So, you'll be doing makeup

33
00:00:59,914 --> 00:01:01,367
for the models backstage?

34
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:02,390
Yes.

35
00:01:02,633 --> 00:01:04,977
Wow, that's amazing!

36
00:01:06,007 --> 00:01:07,741
I wonder what it'll feel like to see

37
00:01:07,781 --> 00:01:09,241
the models you've done makeup

38
00:01:09,257 --> 00:01:10,452
for walking the stage.

39
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,477
Let me know how it feels.

40
00:01:14,273 --> 00:01:15,070
Feels?

41
00:01:15,352 --> 00:01:16,117
Mmm.

42
00:01:17,343 --> 00:01:18,890
Oh, Tenma is coming too.

43
00:01:19,008 --> 00:01:19,922
Tenma-san is?

44
00:01:20,047 --> 00:01:21,765
It seems my family's brand

45
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:22,910
is exhibiting.

46
00:01:23,828 --> 00:01:25,695
I hope we don't run into each other.

47
00:01:25,820 --> 00:01:27,304
If you run into him, make sure to

48
00:01:27,328 --> 00:01:28,328
greet him properly.

49
00:01:28,352 --> 00:01:30,539
He'll get lonely otherwise.

50
00:01:30,547 --> 00:01:32,078
Hmm?

51
00:01:33,016 --> 00:01:34,140
Anyway,

52
00:01:34,188 --> 00:01:35,906
congratulations!

53
00:01:36,117 --> 00:01:37,414
I'll definitely come to see it!

54
00:01:38,461 --> 00:01:40,086
Alright,

55
00:01:40,859 --> 00:01:42,195
I'll do my best too!

56
00:01:43,547 --> 00:01:45,383
Wow, amazing.

57
00:01:45,852 --> 00:01:47,375

(Romy Feerique Lounge)
The Tokyo Style Stage,

59
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,330
(Romy Feerique Lounge)
or TSS,

60
00:01:55,828 --> 00:01:57,749
is a fashion show-centric event,

61
00:01:57,914 --> 00:01:59,422
- but every year,
- Alright.

62
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,585
- there are collaborative stages
- Here.

63
00:02:00,585 --> 00:02:02,101
- featuring cosmetic brands.
- All good.

64
00:02:02,391 --> 00:02:04,421
- Yes.
- This year, Romy

65
00:02:04,516 --> 00:02:06,188
is participating for the first time.

66
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:07,281
Good work today.

67
00:02:07,453 --> 00:02:10,234
Oh, Mamiya-kun, what brings you here?

68
00:02:10,297 --> 00:02:12,570
I got a ticket from Tanouchi-san,

69
00:02:12,633 --> 00:02:13,875
so I came to see Romy's stage.

70
00:02:14,148 --> 00:02:15,953
As expected from a workaholic.

71
00:02:16,023 --> 00:02:17,586
You never missed anything.

72
00:02:18,984 --> 00:02:20,188
Hey, Toma.

73
00:02:21,313 --> 00:02:22,859
Toma, huh?

74
00:02:22,914 --> 00:02:23,695
Sahashi.

75
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,390
Even if you correct it,

76
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:27,031
this brother still heard it.

77
00:02:28,164 --> 00:02:31,484
Toma, Toma, Toma, To...

78
00:02:31,555 --> 00:02:32,570
Toma!

79
00:02:32,602 --> 00:02:33,562
What a relief.

80
00:02:33,625 --> 00:02:34,977
- Tenma-san.
- What's with you?

81
00:02:35,062 --> 00:02:36,758
Long time no see, Mamiya Natsume.

82
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,898
More importantly, Toma,

83
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,054
I beg you,

84
00:02:40,172 --> 00:02:41,977
please be our brand's model.

85
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:42,914
No way.

86
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,586
Huh?

87
00:02:43,633 --> 00:02:44,672
Hey, who's this?

88
00:02:44,875 --> 00:02:46,664
- Why not?
- He's Toma's older brother.

89
00:02:46,734 --> 00:02:47,421
Hey!

90
00:02:47,531 --> 00:02:48,898
- Sahashi's older brother?
- Why not?

91
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:50,038
Hear me out first.

92
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:51,352
My model...

93
00:02:51,366 --> 00:02:53,139
The model scheduled to appear on

94
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,202
Tenma-san's brand stage was injured,

95
00:02:55,226 --> 00:02:56,078
I can only count on you.

96
00:02:56,079 --> 00:02:58,054
- A replacement couldn't come in time.
- They're a bit similar.

97
00:02:58,055 --> 00:02:59,852
Please, I'm begging you!

98
00:03:12,953 --> 00:03:14,164
You owe me one,

99
00:03:15,429 --> 00:03:16,671
Toma.

100
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:17,562
Are you going to do it?

101
00:03:17,563 --> 00:03:18,273
Yeah.

102
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,461
I changed my mind.

103
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:22,398
In that case, I'll do my best.

104
00:03:22,569 --> 00:03:23,413
Sit down here.

105
00:03:23,414 --> 00:03:24,875
- Absolutely not.
- Huh?

106
00:03:27,094 --> 00:03:28,125
Natsume-san.

107
00:03:32,602 --> 00:03:33,258
Huh?

108
00:03:33,945 --> 00:03:35,414
No, but I'm...

109
00:03:35,445 --> 00:03:36,219
Then I won't do it.

110
00:03:36,242 --> 00:03:37,680
- Huh?
- Huh?

111
00:03:39,172 --> 00:03:40,507
But I don't know how to

112
00:03:40,524 --> 00:03:41,851
do runway makeup.

113
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:43,632
You won't mind if I give some advice

114
00:03:43,641 --> 00:03:44,789
from the side, right?

115
00:03:45,273 --> 00:03:46,766
That's fine.

116
00:03:49,492 --> 00:03:50,602
Natsume-san,

117
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,469
I'll be in your care.

118
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,719
Alright then!

119
00:03:59,016 --> 00:03:59,898
Leave it to me!

120
00:04:02,109 --> 00:04:03,109
Alright.

121
00:04:05,195 --> 00:04:06,508
So let's start with the base.

122
00:04:06,531 --> 00:04:07,148
Mmm.

123
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:13,844
My hands are shaking.

124
00:04:15,484 --> 00:04:17,538
Even though I've touched this guy's face

125
00:04:17,554 --> 00:04:18,754
so many times,

126
00:04:20,719 --> 00:04:21,914
this feeling,

127
00:04:22,734 --> 00:04:24,625
is different from any of them.

128
00:04:29,164 --> 00:04:31,179
I will do everything I can to make Toma

129
00:04:31,711 --> 00:04:34,195
the coolest

130
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:41,000
with all I've got.

131
00:04:50,758 --> 00:04:51,805
It's done.

132
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,031
Thanks.

133
00:04:58,843 --> 00:04:59,562
Okay, then,

134
00:04:59,563 --> 00:05:00,773
fitting.

135
00:05:00,992 --> 00:05:02,500
I'll show you, let's go.

136
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:06,031
Toma.

137
00:05:09,289 --> 00:05:10,281
Do your best.

138
00:05:11,273 --> 00:05:12,109
Yes.

139
00:05:13,414 --> 00:05:14,172
Huh?

140
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,875
Hey, I'm standing here, you know?

141
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:20,461
Toma's back had already become

142
00:05:21,133 --> 00:05:24,446
that of a model

143
00:05:25,242 --> 00:05:28,265
and was shining very brightly.

144
00:05:29,664 --> 00:05:31,445
Everyone will see Tomoya,

145
00:05:32,266 --> 00:05:33,500
the one I did makeup for.

146
00:05:46,531 --> 00:05:48,164
Still looking at those photos?

147
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:51,094
They're just so cool.

148
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,648
So, how was it?

149
00:05:56,281 --> 00:05:57,984
Seeing the model you did makeup

150
00:05:58,008 --> 00:05:59,179
for walk the runway?

151
00:06:00,984 --> 00:06:01,813
Well...

152
00:06:03,328 --> 00:06:04,570
Mmm...

153
00:06:05,461 --> 00:06:06,297
It was…

154
00:06:07,133 --> 00:06:08,250
amazing.

155
00:06:09,843 --> 00:06:11,874
Even days later,

156
00:06:13,266 --> 00:06:14,680
I still get excited

157
00:06:14,696 --> 00:06:15,961
just thinking about it.

158
00:06:17,796 --> 00:06:19,257
Seeing the audience in front

159
00:06:19,281 --> 00:06:20,453
captivated by you,

160
00:06:20,781 --> 00:06:22,766
feeling their excitement…

161
00:06:24,469 --> 00:06:25,563
Isn't it cool?

162
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:27,516
Yeah, I did the makeup.

163
00:06:28,367 --> 00:06:29,773
It made me feel proud.

164
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:33,273
Mmm.

165
00:06:35,359 --> 00:06:36,523
Makeup is all about

166
00:06:37,008 --> 00:06:38,516
making people shine

167
00:06:39,391 --> 00:06:40,961
and smile.

168
00:06:41,531 --> 00:06:42,680
That's how it is.

169
00:06:45,578 --> 00:06:47,148
But since I'm in BA,

170
00:06:48,383 --> 00:06:49,437
I want to continue

171
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:50,740
standing at the counter

172
00:06:50,765 --> 00:06:53,133
and make even more customers smile.

173
00:06:58,273 --> 00:07:00,140
You're truly a dedicated workaholic,

174
00:07:00,156 --> 00:07:01,429
Natsume-san.

175
00:07:06,531 --> 00:07:08,078
But it was worth modeling.

176
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:10,047
Hmm?

177
00:07:13,758 --> 00:07:14,578
You

178
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,781
didn't do it just for that, did you?

179
00:07:17,273 --> 00:07:18,727
Is there any other reason to do it?

180
00:07:26,328 --> 00:07:27,133
Toma.

181
00:07:28,758 --> 00:07:29,594
Thank you.

182
00:07:30,977 --> 00:07:32,672
You looked so cool!

183
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,859
Thanks to Tenma-san keeping

184
00:07:39,867 --> 00:07:41,960
Toma's media exposure to a minimum.

185
00:07:43,352 --> 00:07:45,202
It seems like Toma was successfully

186
00:07:45,227 --> 00:07:47,627
kept out of sight of the customers,

187
00:07:49,289 --> 00:07:50,873
but there's no doubt

188
00:07:50,905 --> 00:07:52,741
that the model industry noticed.

189
00:07:53,563 --> 00:07:54,469
Work?

190
00:07:56,773 --> 00:07:58,414
A contact from my modeling days.

191
00:07:58,922 --> 00:07:59,781
I see.

192
00:08:00,773 --> 00:08:02,308
He constantly gets

193
00:08:02,805 --> 00:08:05,086
messages from former colleagues.

194
00:08:05,664 --> 00:08:06,469
Yes.

195
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,516
No. It's been a while.

196
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:11,961
Ah...

197
00:08:12,461 --> 00:08:13,593
It was a coincidence,

198
00:08:13,617 --> 00:08:15,140
I was working for Romy.

199
00:08:15,164 --> 00:08:15,891
Yes.

200
00:08:20,773 --> 00:08:21,914
Thanks for your hard work.

201
00:08:22,461 --> 00:08:23,609
Thanks for your hard work.

202
00:08:24,367 --> 00:08:25,656
Are you free now?

203
00:08:26,227 --> 00:08:27,398
Yes, I'm free.

204
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:30,500
The TSS stage the other day is being

205
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:32,109
talked about in the PR department.

206
00:08:33,273 --> 00:08:34,843
There's a discussion about hiring

207
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,397
Sahashi-kun as a PR model

208
00:08:36,421 --> 00:08:38,148
for our men's cosmetics.

209
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,109
Huh?

210
00:08:39,109 --> 00:08:40,226
He should be talking with

211
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,289
the PR department at the HQ right now.

212
00:08:43,914 --> 00:08:44,766
He…

213
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:48,336
went on stage for me and now...

214
00:08:51,414 --> 00:08:53,539
What? Is it about the model role?

215
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:54,570
Yeah.

216
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,148
I heard from Tanouchi-san.

217
00:08:57,742 --> 00:08:58,992
I'm really sorry.

218
00:08:59,695 --> 00:09:01,054
It must have been tough to refuse.

219
00:09:02,117 --> 00:09:03,633
No, I accepted it.

220
00:09:04,383 --> 00:09:05,125
Huh?

221
00:09:05,797 --> 00:09:06,563
Why?

222
00:09:06,766 --> 00:09:09,320
Hmm, because the conditions were right?

223
00:09:09,859 --> 00:09:11,164
Conditions?

224
00:09:12,828 --> 00:09:13,938
Ah, hello.

225
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,477
It's been a while.

226
00:09:15,797 --> 00:09:16,555
Yes.

227
00:09:18,710 --> 00:09:20,281
Could it be that he's seriously

228
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,023
considering returning to modeling?

229
00:09:23,438 --> 00:09:25,906
He just became a makeup artist.

230
00:09:27,617 --> 00:09:28,813
It was just starting…

231
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:33,102
Is this really okay, Toma?

232
00:09:33,813 --> 00:09:35,273
Are you sure about this?

233
00:09:40,469 --> 00:09:41,734
If it's come to this, I...

234
00:09:42,578 --> 00:09:45,413
will keep Toma tied down!

235
00:09:48,141 --> 00:09:49,734
Natsume-san, is something wrong?

236
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,195
You've been acting weird since earlier.

237
00:09:53,914 --> 00:09:54,680
Toma,

238
00:09:56,148 --> 00:09:57,852
the next event you're assigned

239
00:09:58,836 --> 00:10:00,265
to is at our store, right?

240
00:10:01,227 --> 00:10:03,297
Yes, that's right.

241
00:10:04,586 --> 00:10:05,398
Then...

242
00:10:06,797 --> 00:10:08,633
let's have a personal sales competition!

243
00:10:09,445 --> 00:10:10,359
A competition?

244
00:10:10,742 --> 00:10:11,820
If I lose,

245
00:10:12,953 --> 00:10:14,109
you can return to modeling

246
00:10:14,133 --> 00:10:15,742
or do whatever you want.

247
00:10:15,766 --> 00:10:16,547
But

248
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:18,578
if I win...

249
00:10:19,789 --> 00:10:21,359
you must listen to my request.

250
00:10:22,742 --> 00:10:23,766
Got it.

251
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,039
Alright.

252
00:10:25,914 --> 00:10:27,922
I'll make you do as I request.

253
00:10:27,938 --> 00:10:28,930
Huh?

254
00:10:29,328 --> 00:10:30,758
Watch me.

255
00:10:31,922 --> 00:10:32,914
Alright.

256
00:10:33,757 --> 00:10:34,828
From now on,

257
00:10:35,063 --> 00:10:36,391
we're not lovers

258
00:10:36,578 --> 00:10:37,633
but rivals!

259
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,953
You say that,

260
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:41,187
but you'll still cling

261
00:10:41,212 --> 00:10:42,351
to me tonight, right?

262
00:10:43,859 --> 00:10:44,719
No,

263
00:10:45,594 --> 00:10:46,922
until the result is out,

264
00:10:47,836 --> 00:10:49,219
I'm going to sleep in the living room.

265
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,328
Strictly no flirting allowed!

266
00:10:52,766 --> 00:10:54,258
- Are you serious?
- Yes.

267
00:10:57,875 --> 00:10:58,961
Understood.

268
00:11:00,414 --> 00:11:02,601
I'll watch ‘senpai's' seriousness.

269
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:16,164
This is my personal color,

270
00:11:16,195 --> 00:11:17,852
but I prefer this color.

271
00:11:17,883 --> 00:11:19,234
What do you think, Mamiya-san?

272
00:11:19,398 --> 00:11:21,320
I bought some eyeshadows and other items

273
00:11:21,352 --> 00:11:22,695
that aren't available in Japan,

274
00:11:22,719 --> 00:11:24,210
but I can't seem to use them properly.

275
00:11:24,359 --> 00:11:26,625
Personal color is important,

276
00:11:26,992 --> 00:11:28,530
but you can to try the colors you like

277
00:11:28,547 --> 00:11:30,140
without being constrained by it.

278
00:11:30,164 --> 00:11:31,452
I might be able to offer

279
00:11:31,468 --> 00:11:33,148
some makeup suggestions.

280
00:11:33,555 --> 00:11:34,601
Please consider it for

281
00:11:34,625 --> 00:11:35,882
the next opportunity.

282
00:11:35,906 --> 00:11:37,281
- We look forward to seeing you again.
- We look forward to seeing you again.

283
00:11:41,438 --> 00:11:42,351
Hey, don't stick so close.

284
00:11:42,352 --> 00:11:44,063
This is part of the job.

285
00:11:44,531 --> 00:11:45,211
By the way,

286
00:11:45,375 --> 00:11:47,037
are you aware of the quickly diminishing

287
00:11:47,062 --> 00:11:48,232
stock of the freebies?

288
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,607
Don't do anything careless like

289
00:11:50,623 --> 00:11:52,482
running out early in the event,

290
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,063
Chief.

291
00:11:57,359 --> 00:11:58,961
What's with that attitude?

292
00:12:02,227 --> 00:12:03,063
Welcome.

293
00:12:03,141 --> 00:12:04,367
Toma!

294
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:05,781
It's been a while.

295
00:12:05,813 --> 00:12:06,453
It's been a while.

296
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:07,586
Risako told me.

297
00:12:07,610 --> 00:12:09,695
I didn't know you were with Romy.

298
00:12:09,719 --> 00:12:11,156
You haven't changed at all.

299
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:12,751
You could've returned to being a model.

300
00:12:13,891 --> 00:12:15,477
- What are you laughing for?
- Hey, make a come back, yeah?

301
00:12:15,478 --> 00:12:16,523
- No, no.
- Do makeup for me please.

302
00:12:16,547 --> 00:12:17,500
- Refuse now!
- Right?

303
00:12:17,515 --> 00:12:18,977
- Please recommend products for me.
- Tell them...

304
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:20,953
I won't let him return!

305
00:12:21,063 --> 00:12:22,125
Then oil products then.

306
00:12:23,164 --> 00:12:25,031
Sales are looking good.

307
00:12:25,344 --> 00:12:26,812
At this rate, we might reach

308
00:12:26,836 --> 00:12:28,187
a pretty high position

309
00:12:28,211 --> 00:12:30,094
compared to other stores.

310
00:12:30,203 --> 00:12:31,375
Really?

311
00:12:32,038 --> 00:12:32,968
Ah, sit down.

312
00:12:35,031 --> 00:12:36,406
Especially since Sahashi-kun's

313
00:12:36,414 --> 00:12:37,656
model-related customers

314
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:39,430
have been spreading
the word on social media,

315
00:12:39,586 --> 00:12:41,016
it's been quite effective.

316
00:12:41,226 --> 00:12:42,320
The average spend per customer

317
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:43,093
is also high.

318
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:43,875
Yes.

319
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,109
As for you,

320
00:12:45,281 --> 00:12:46,748
your customer age range is

321
00:12:46,772 --> 00:12:48,476
broader than Sahashi-kun's,

322
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,843
and your turnover rate is good,

323
00:12:49,851 --> 00:12:51,156
so it's really well-balanced.

324
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,390
The overall atmosphere

325
00:12:52,414 --> 00:12:53,443
at the counter is good,

326
00:12:53,467 --> 00:12:54,686
and morale is high.

327
00:12:54,711 --> 00:12:56,156
Keep up the good work!

328
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:58,109
Yes.

329
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,461
Thank you!

330
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:02,352
I won't give up.

331
00:13:03,281 --> 00:13:04,641
I'll do my best.

332
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:08,156
And yet...

333
00:13:10,313 --> 00:13:11,039
Ah...

334
00:13:11,211 --> 00:13:12,234
Good night…

335
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:15,500
Good night.

336
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:29,883
I'm tired…

337
00:13:31,266 --> 00:13:32,227
and lonely.

338
00:13:37,555 --> 00:13:38,390
Sorry for the wait.

339
00:13:38,407 --> 00:13:39,450
Here to pick up the items, yes?

340
00:13:39,474 --> 00:13:39,958
Yes.

341
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:40,709
- Sasaki-san.
- Yes?

342
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:42,007
- Please take care of this customer.
- After that,

343
00:13:42,047 --> 00:13:45,078
- Sorry for the wait.
- we're still rivals,

344
00:13:45,147 --> 00:13:47,295
- There are customers waiting in line now.
- and the event reached its final day.

345
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:48,234
This is the queue card.

346
00:13:49,602 --> 00:13:51,422
This day coincided with the weekend,

347
00:13:51,813 --> 00:13:53,898
leading to customers waiting in line.

348
00:13:54,133 --> 00:13:55,250
Aizawa-san, sorry.

349
00:13:55,273 --> 00:13:56,039
Hmm?

350
00:13:56,047 --> 00:13:57,461
Since it looks like it'll get crowded

351
00:13:57,477 --> 00:13:58,508
in the afternoon,

352
00:13:58,533 --> 00:13:59,898
I was thinking of shortening the day-of

353
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:00,835
reservations to 45-minute intervals.

354
00:14:00,913 --> 00:14:02,179
I think that's fine.

355
00:14:02,516 --> 00:14:03,445
Alright, I'll do that.

356
00:14:09,383 --> 00:14:11,430
- Looking good, Mamiya.
- Sorry for the wait.

357
00:14:15,211 --> 00:14:16,344
Yes, it is.

358
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:18,570
In the end,

359
00:14:18,797 --> 00:14:20,211
I didn't reach the top spot

360
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,390
in individual sales.

361
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:24,156
But my stable sales

362
00:14:24,477 --> 00:14:26,007
and high customer satisfaction

363
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,311
were recognized,

364
00:14:27,383 --> 00:14:28,984
and I was awarded.

365
00:14:31,133 --> 00:14:32,844
Chief Mamiya,

366
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,477
congratulations on the Rookie award.

367
00:14:35,547 --> 00:14:37,875
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

368
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,266
Thank you, everyone!

369
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,613
Well then, let's hear a few words

370
00:14:51,637 --> 00:14:53,077
from Mamiya-kun.

371
00:14:53,242 --> 00:14:54,219
Huh?

372
00:14:54,266 --> 00:14:55,656
Come on, stand up.

373
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,922
Oh, okay.

374
00:14:57,727 --> 00:14:58,781
Alright.

375
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:02,523
Umm...

376
00:15:04,281 --> 00:15:05,406
I believe this award

377
00:15:06,156 --> 00:15:07,500
is not just mine

378
00:15:08,514 --> 00:15:11,108
but something we all achieved together.

379
00:15:14,836 --> 00:15:17,828
I aspired to be in BA since

380
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:19,805
I was in elementary school.

381
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:24,383
I wanted to make people shine like that.

382
00:15:25,938 --> 00:15:28,172
That was my inspiration.

383
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:32,568
I knew it would be tough with

384
00:15:32,593 --> 00:15:34,273
so few men in the field,

385
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:37,174
but when I achieved my dream,

386
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:38,979
there were many challenges.

387
00:15:41,252 --> 00:15:42,112
But

388
00:15:43,229 --> 00:15:46,862
making customers smile with my own hands

389
00:15:48,276 --> 00:15:49,877
and earning their trust

390
00:15:50,104 --> 00:15:51,408
is incredibly rewarding.

391
00:15:52,322 --> 00:15:53,431
I've faced my work

392
00:15:53,456 --> 00:15:55,136
with the determination

393
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:56,994
to never forget that feeling.

394
00:15:59,487 --> 00:16:00,104
I'm...

395
00:16:01,463 --> 00:16:04,526
still inexperienced as a chief,

396
00:16:05,979 --> 00:16:10,166
but the positive feedback from customers

397
00:16:11,377 --> 00:16:13,425
is thanks to everyone's efforts.

398
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,151
I'm truly grateful to you all.

399
00:16:21,979 --> 00:16:22,791
I...

400
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:26,463
I love this job as a beauty advisor.

401
00:16:29,908 --> 00:16:30,932
A lot.

402
00:16:39,978 --> 00:16:42,830
Has Harada-san received the item yet?

403
00:16:44,815 --> 00:16:46,119
And Aizawa-san...

404
00:16:48,151 --> 00:16:51,041
(Sahashi Toma: Meet me at
the fountain plaza later)

405
00:16:51,604 --> 00:16:52,565
Mamiya-san

406
00:16:52,612 --> 00:16:53,572
is so cool.

407
00:16:53,862 --> 00:16:55,979
Harukawa, try to follow him.

408
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:56,978
Yes.

409
00:16:56,979 --> 00:16:57,862
Do your best.

410
00:17:04,174 --> 00:17:05,221
Toma!

411
00:17:19,627 --> 00:17:21,510
I wanted to see it with Natsume-san.

412
00:17:23,174 --> 00:17:23,924
Yeah.

413
00:17:25,244 --> 00:17:26,064
It's beautiful.

414
00:17:30,119 --> 00:17:32,854
Congratulations on the award.

415
00:17:34,658 --> 00:17:35,697
You too, right?

416
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,072
You won the Rookie Artist Award.

417
00:17:39,393 --> 00:17:40,229
Congrats!

418
00:17:41,338 --> 00:17:42,072
Are you happy?

419
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:43,838
Of course!

420
00:17:44,947 --> 00:17:46,893
It's my first time being awarded.

421
00:17:49,479 --> 00:17:50,112
But...

422
00:17:52,408 --> 00:17:53,720
I didn't reach the top in

423
00:17:53,745 --> 00:17:55,204
individual sales like you did.

424
00:17:56,307 --> 00:17:57,221
Are you frustrated?

425
00:17:59,026 --> 00:18:00,479
Of course I am!

426
00:18:03,127 --> 00:18:03,893
Besides,

427
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:05,627
that promise...

428
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:07,908
If I lose,

429
00:18:09,049 --> 00:18:10,306
you can return to modeling

430
00:18:10,331 --> 00:18:11,666
or do whatever you want.

431
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:16,237
As promised, I'll do what I like.

432
00:18:27,533 --> 00:18:28,728
I didn't mean ‘do what you like'

433
00:18:30,213 --> 00:18:31,346
like this.

434
00:18:35,221 --> 00:18:36,151
I...

435
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:39,143
If you want to return to modeling, then…

436
00:18:39,174 --> 00:18:40,151
I won't.

437
00:18:40,963 --> 00:18:41,627
Huh?

438
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,924
I'm suited for behind-the-scenes work,

439
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,174
and I actually like my current job.

440
00:18:48,901 --> 00:18:49,752
Then...

441
00:18:50,744 --> 00:18:52,119
why did you do modeling for our brand?

442
00:18:52,479 --> 00:18:53,510
Oh.

443
00:18:54,322 --> 00:18:55,720
Even though it was called modeling,

444
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,854
I turned down opportunities

445
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:58,150
to show off fancy outfits.

446
00:18:59,033 --> 00:19:00,299
As a makeup artist,

447
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,041
wearing a uniform would be too flashy.

448
00:19:05,471 --> 00:19:06,205
Then...

449
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,558
why the competition with me?

450
00:19:09,768 --> 00:19:10,752
That is...

451
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,119
When I talked to the PR team at HQ,

452
00:19:14,541 --> 00:19:16,197
I told them that if they wanted to

453
00:19:16,205 --> 00:19:17,306
focus on male staff,

454
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:19,369
Natsume-san would be better.

455
00:19:19,893 --> 00:19:21,337
Why did you say that?

456
00:19:21,338 --> 00:19:22,783
Because Natsume-san

457
00:19:23,096 --> 00:19:24,330
loves his job

458
00:19:24,729 --> 00:19:26,174
and takes pride in it,

459
00:19:27,252 --> 00:19:29,437
and BA is more accessible to customers.

460
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:32,682
However,

461
00:19:33,579 --> 00:19:35,158
the PR person said that

462
00:19:35,183 --> 00:19:36,863
my job is more glamorous

463
00:19:37,182 --> 00:19:38,651
and I have a better future.

464
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:41,174
That's to be expected.

465
00:19:41,244 --> 00:19:43,283
I was really annoyed that Natsume-san

466
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:44,822
was being underestimated.

467
00:19:46,994 --> 00:19:48,033
So I wanted to

468
00:19:48,807 --> 00:19:50,713
prove myself in the event

469
00:19:50,924 --> 00:19:52,861
and show that PR person.

470
00:19:55,799 --> 00:19:56,643
Was that all?

471
00:19:57,494 --> 00:19:58,216
Yes.

472
00:20:02,432 --> 00:20:03,658
That's trivial.

473
00:20:05,135 --> 00:20:06,322
What's that all about?

474
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:10,885
Even if it seems trivial to you,

475
00:20:11,744 --> 00:20:13,134
I was frustrated seeing you

476
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,384
being underestimated.

477
00:20:15,892 --> 00:20:17,876
I thought you must have misunderstood

478
00:20:17,901 --> 00:20:19,501
about the modeling,

479
00:20:20,088 --> 00:20:21,111
if I could stir up

480
00:20:21,127 --> 00:20:22,322
your competitive spirit,

481
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,877
you would work harder.

482
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,416
I was…

483
00:20:28,776 --> 00:20:29,947
desperately afraid you

484
00:20:29,971 --> 00:20:31,080
might quit makeup.

485
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:32,182
I won't quit.

486
00:20:35,994 --> 00:20:37,901
I really like this job.

487
00:20:45,799 --> 00:20:46,666
But...

488
00:20:50,088 --> 00:20:50,807
I...

489
00:20:52,892 --> 00:20:54,490
like you as a model too.

490
00:20:55,674 --> 00:20:56,369
Huh?

491
00:20:57,330 --> 00:20:58,760
But more than that,

492
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,291
I think you look even more dazzling and

493
00:21:01,315 --> 00:21:03,315
cool when you're doing makeup.

494
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:04,806
Ah...

495
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:06,891
Sure, there are things

496
00:21:06,923 --> 00:21:08,897
about you that annoy me.

497
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,274
But

498
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,423
working together and doing

499
00:21:16,448 --> 00:21:17,814
many things is enjoyable,

500
00:21:21,844 --> 00:21:23,876
and I'm glad you're here.

501
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:36,391
I'm sorry. I lied.

502
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,258
The reason I accepted

503
00:21:40,282 --> 00:21:41,734
the challenge with you…

504
00:21:41,758 --> 00:21:42,914
I said it was because

505
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:44,594
I was annoyed with PR,

506
00:21:44,618 --> 00:21:46,180
but it wasn't just that.

507
00:21:51,922 --> 00:21:53,109
It's because I couldn't

508
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:54,250
stay away from you,

509
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:57,913
hoping you wouldn't be

510
00:21:57,938 --> 00:21:59,233
able to stay away from me either.

511
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:03,813
If there's anything I can do

512
00:22:03,821 --> 00:22:05,055
for what Natsume-san wants

513
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:06,587
or aims for,

514
00:22:08,383 --> 00:22:10,704
I will do everything I can

515
00:22:12,954 --> 00:22:14,258
to make you believe that

516
00:22:14,281 --> 00:22:15,687
you can achieve it with me

517
00:22:17,508 --> 00:22:19,883
and that you can't live without me.

518
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:24,985
I...

519
00:22:27,133 --> 00:22:28,984
am desperate to become someone

520
00:22:29,009 --> 00:22:30,689
essential to your life.

521
00:22:44,587 --> 00:22:46,438
You think about a lot of things.

522
00:22:51,071 --> 00:22:52,735
It must be tough,

523
00:22:53,126 --> 00:22:54,805
you got caught by someone like me.

524
00:22:55,915 --> 00:22:56,930
Is it tough?

525
00:22:58,977 --> 00:22:59,766
I...

526
00:23:00,219 --> 00:23:01,672
I love Natsume-san so much

527
00:23:01,688 --> 00:23:03,390
that even I am surprised myself,

528
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:05,383
so it's very hard

529
00:23:06,258 --> 00:23:07,734
because it's heavy and annoying.

530
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:19,415
So...

531
00:23:22,469 --> 00:23:23,829
I'll tell you something good.

532
00:23:29,337 --> 00:23:30,157
I also...

533
00:23:32,351 --> 00:23:33,874
love you a lot, too, you know.

534
00:23:38,235 --> 00:23:40,415
You don't have to think so much.

535
00:23:42,727 --> 00:23:43,633
When I

536
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,852
wake up in the morning

537
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:49,587
and when I go to sleep at night,

538
00:23:51,859 --> 00:23:53,124
if you're there…

539
00:23:54,829 --> 00:23:56,547
I'm incredibly happy.

540
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:17,547
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 8)

541
00:24:43,618 --> 00:24:45,251
The competition is over,

542
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:46,860
so we can finally be affectionate.

543
00:24:47,454 --> 00:24:48,547
No,

544
00:24:49,180 --> 00:24:50,587
I haven't given up yet!

545
00:24:51,782 --> 00:24:54,821
I'm going to become a better BA

546
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:56,532
and definitely surpass you!

547
00:24:57,258 --> 00:24:58,563
Watch me!

548
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,602
Alright.

549
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:01,992
I'm serious!

550
00:25:02,126 --> 00:25:03,462
I'm really serious!

551
00:25:04,251 --> 00:25:05,126
Yes, yes.

552
00:25:05,203 --> 00:25:07,023
I understand, Natsume-san.
