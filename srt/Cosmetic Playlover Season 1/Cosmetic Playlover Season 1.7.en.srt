1
00:00:01,383 --> 00:00:02,938
You must be the reason

2
00:00:03,375 --> 00:00:06,688
why Toma is staying with this brand.

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,141
Haa...

4
00:00:10,438 --> 00:00:11,930
Such a waste.

5
00:00:13,492 --> 00:00:16,453
There are more suitable places for him.

6
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:21,258
I can't get that man out of my head.

7
00:00:22,805 --> 00:00:23,937
Sahashi said he was just

8
00:00:23,953 --> 00:00:24,827
an acquaintance,

9
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:26,180
but was he a senpai model from his past?

10
00:00:26,922 --> 00:00:28,070
Starting tomorrow,

11
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:29,359
I'll come pick you up.

12
00:00:29,383 --> 00:00:30,820
That guy is sure to show up again.

13
00:00:32,016 --> 00:00:32,828
But

14
00:00:33,539 --> 00:00:35,141
why did he approach me?

15
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:37,695
Moreover...

16
00:00:37,852 --> 00:00:40,516
you and Toma are far too mismatched.

17
00:00:42,102 --> 00:00:43,656
What did he mean by that?

18
00:00:45,617 --> 00:00:47,108
Can't sleep?

19
00:00:49,688 --> 00:00:50,883
You were awake?

20
00:00:53,125 --> 00:00:54,953
Natsume-san, come here.

21
00:02:02,286 --> 00:02:06,232
"Cosmetic Playlover"
(Episode 7)

22
00:02:09,271 --> 00:02:10,404
Thanks for your hard work.

23
00:02:11,763 --> 00:02:13,740
- Thanks for your hard work.
- Thanks for your hard work.

24
00:02:14,623 --> 00:02:16,334
That guy didn't show up today.

25
00:02:16,630 --> 00:02:17,810
Toma!

26
00:02:22,006 --> 00:02:23,693
I knew it was you.

27
00:02:24,474 --> 00:02:25,509
What are you doing

28
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,575
coming to Natsume-san?

29
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:29,107
You wouldn't talk to me.

30
00:02:30,326 --> 00:02:32,420
So I hired a detective.

31
00:02:32,717 --> 00:02:34,349
That's how I learned that you are

32
00:02:34,365 --> 00:02:36,052
deeply involved with Mamiya Natsume...

33
00:02:36,076 --> 00:02:37,162
A detective?

34
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:37,943
Huh?

35
00:02:38,248 --> 00:02:39,903
So, you decided to mess with us?

36
00:02:39,904 --> 00:02:41,279
That's...

37
00:02:41,763 --> 00:02:42,693
Hey,

38
00:02:43,904 --> 00:02:44,959
who is this guy?

39
00:02:45,482 --> 00:02:46,529
Sahashi Tenma,

40
00:02:48,193 --> 00:02:49,396
my older brother.

41
00:02:50,849 --> 00:02:51,732
You...

42
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:53,684
you have a brother?

43
00:02:53,748 --> 00:02:54,435
Yeah.

44
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:55,662
Toma.

45
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:58,201
Let's go back to New York together.

46
00:02:58,474 --> 00:02:59,942
We're establishing a cosmetics division

47
00:02:59,958 --> 00:03:00,904
within our brand.

48
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:01,756
New York?

49
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:04,388
- You can fully utilize your skills.
- "Our brand?"

50
00:03:04,474 --> 00:03:05,732
So let's go home.

51
00:03:05,857 --> 00:03:07,537
Father and Mother are waiting for you...

52
00:03:07,576 --> 00:03:09,240
I'm from Tokyo,

53
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:10,834
so please go alone.

54
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:12,036
Don't come back. Bye.

55
00:03:12,037 --> 00:03:13,224
Huh? Wait...

56
00:03:13,521 --> 00:03:14,896
Toma!

57
00:03:18,317 --> 00:03:19,270
Hey.

58
00:03:20,763 --> 00:03:21,849
Are you okay with this?

59
00:03:22,123 --> 00:03:23,240
Forget it.

60
00:03:24,779 --> 00:03:25,748
What?

61
00:03:26,255 --> 00:03:27,489
What's going on?

62
00:03:33,553 --> 00:03:34,646
Explain to me,

63
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,341
what does

64
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:37,340
'going back' mean?

65
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,068
Calm down.

66
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:41,232
I'll explain everything.

67
00:03:46,732 --> 00:03:48,185
My father

68
00:03:48,365 --> 00:03:50,748
runs an apparel brand in New York.

69
00:03:50,935 --> 00:03:53,053
My mother helps him out.

70
00:03:54,185 --> 00:03:55,880
When I graduated from college,

71
00:03:55,896 --> 00:03:58,096
Tenma asked me to work with them,

72
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:00,357
but I kept refusing.

73
00:04:01,388 --> 00:04:02,138
Just recently,

74
00:04:02,537 --> 00:04:04,138
he contacted me again, saying they're

75
00:04:04,154 --> 00:04:05,614
creating a new cosmetics division

76
00:04:05,638 --> 00:04:06,748
and wanted me to join.

77
00:04:07,834 --> 00:04:10,029
I turned him down again.

78
00:04:11,365 --> 00:04:12,678
That's all.

79
00:04:14,912 --> 00:04:15,935
Why?

80
00:04:16,974 --> 00:04:17,920
Why what?

81
00:04:19,396 --> 00:04:20,490
"Why what?"

82
00:04:22,615 --> 00:04:24,482
Why did you refuse the job?

83
00:04:25,466 --> 00:04:26,895
You like clothes too, don't you?

84
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,678
I was more interested in makeup,

85
00:04:31,537 --> 00:04:33,459
I have no interest in my family matters.

86
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:35,482
Huh?

87
00:04:36,287 --> 00:04:38,748
Tenma seems to respect our parents,

88
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:42,209
He's just here for work,

89
00:04:42,435 --> 00:04:43,763
and he'll probably leave soon.

90
00:04:45,342 --> 00:04:46,521
I'm sorry for the trouble.

91
00:04:46,576 --> 00:04:47,435
No.

92
00:04:47,935 --> 00:04:49,646
I'm not bothered by it.

93
00:04:52,092 --> 00:04:52,982
What?

94
00:04:53,287 --> 00:04:54,623
What's this weird feeling.

95
00:04:56,107 --> 00:04:58,053
We're talking about his family,

96
00:04:59,435 --> 00:05:00,661
but it's like we're talking

97
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:01,778
about someone else.

98
00:05:03,615 --> 00:05:04,717
That time too...

99
00:05:05,146 --> 00:05:07,263
What about you? Do you have a sibling?

100
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:11,318
I don't know. Maybe.

101
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:18,334
Toma.

102
00:05:19,623 --> 00:05:20,420
Hmm?

103
00:05:21,099 --> 00:05:22,099
Well...

104
00:05:23,873 --> 00:05:27,342
Do you hate your family?

105
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:28,787
Ah...

106
00:05:30,529 --> 00:05:32,053
It's not hate.

107
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:34,099
Like I said,

108
00:05:34,756 --> 00:05:35,920
I'm just not interested in them.

109
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,763
That's all there is to it.

110
00:05:38,185 --> 00:05:39,115
Then...

111
00:05:39,553 --> 00:05:41,013
But you didn't have to treat

112
00:05:41,022 --> 00:05:42,193
your brother like that.

113
00:05:43,584 --> 00:05:45,138
He wanted to see you.

114
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:46,810
You could have at least talked to him...

115
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,920
Even though he only says the same thing?

116
00:05:55,482 --> 00:05:57,506
‘You're more talented than me, '

117
00:05:58,303 --> 00:06:00,232
'you can definitely help dad, '

118
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:02,263
'spend more time with the family.'

119
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:03,388
I'm tired of it.

120
00:06:03,818 --> 00:06:04,763
And hiring

121
00:06:04,998 --> 00:06:06,058
a private investigator

122
00:06:06,066 --> 00:06:07,160
to look into his own brother?

123
00:06:07,185 --> 00:06:08,691
Checking on his brother is not sane.

124
00:06:08,912 --> 00:06:10,474
And it dragged you into this mess.

125
00:06:12,834 --> 00:06:13,662
But...

126
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,349
Some things can be understood

127
00:06:16,373 --> 00:06:17,325
if you just talk it out.

128
00:06:17,349 --> 00:06:18,701
I'm sure your brother feels the same.

129
00:06:18,709 --> 00:06:19,755
You're kind.

130
00:06:23,053 --> 00:06:25,115
Sometimes things just don't click,

131
00:06:26,904 --> 00:06:28,553
whether it's with family or anyone else.

132
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:33,365
Let's eat.

133
00:06:51,287 --> 00:06:52,224
Mamiya Natsume.

134
00:06:59,662 --> 00:07:01,154
I'm sorry for disturbing

135
00:07:01,178 --> 00:07:02,458
you during work.

136
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:06,177
But I had to talk to you.

137
00:07:14,461 --> 00:07:15,523
Yesterday,

138
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:17,327
Did Toma say anything,

139
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,164
like,

140
00:07:19,703 --> 00:07:23,488
about me or our family yesterday?

141
00:07:28,211 --> 00:07:30,703
He said he's not interested.

142
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:35,750
Not interested?

143
00:07:37,968 --> 00:07:40,382
I suppose that's true.

144
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,147
I guess saying

145
00:07:45,179 --> 00:07:47,007
he has stopped being interested.

146
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:49,859
would be more correct.

147
00:07:52,297 --> 00:07:53,781
But...

148
00:07:54,546 --> 00:07:56,718
It's sad, really.

149
00:07:58,428 --> 00:08:01,951
Toma never listens to me.

150
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:04,109
He won't even pick up the phone.

151
00:08:04,906 --> 00:08:07,750
At least he reads my messages...

152
00:08:09,601 --> 00:08:11,851
He was such a sweet child

153
00:08:11,876 --> 00:08:13,374
when he was younger...

154
00:08:15,062 --> 00:08:16,047
Toma!

155
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:17,156
Umm...

156
00:08:17,187 --> 00:08:18,156
Big brother...

157
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:19,499
You don't have the right

158
00:08:19,523 --> 00:08:20,803
to call me that.

159
00:08:22,789 --> 00:08:23,859
But...

160
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,406
But why is he like this?

161
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:31,218
Mmm...

162
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:34,703
I...

163
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,539
was a sickly child,

164
00:08:39,898 --> 00:08:41,679
often in the hospital.

165
00:08:43,023 --> 00:08:45,132
My mother was always by my side.

166
00:08:46,882 --> 00:08:47,867
My father

167
00:08:48,078 --> 00:08:49,569
had just moved to New York

168
00:08:49,577 --> 00:08:51,452
to establish his career as a designer,

169
00:08:52,968 --> 00:08:55,632
so Toma was often left alone.

170
00:08:57,179 --> 00:08:59,288
He learned to take care of himself

171
00:08:59,312 --> 00:09:01,272
because our mother taught him to.

172
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:04,359
Wow, you're so well-organized.

173
00:09:04,468 --> 00:09:05,797
Have you always been like this?

174
00:09:06,023 --> 00:09:06,742
Yeah,

175
00:09:07,437 --> 00:09:08,710
I've taken care of myself

176
00:09:08,726 --> 00:09:09,726
since I was little.

177
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,898
Toma is perceptive, isn't he?

178
00:09:17,172 --> 00:09:18,070
Yes,

179
00:09:18,914 --> 00:09:20,632
I feel that way often.

180
00:09:21,437 --> 00:09:23,273
I wonder if he was always like that,

181
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:25,999
or if he became that way because he had

182
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:27,976
to be considerate of me and our mother.

183
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:31,538
Alone in a house without family,

184
00:09:34,937 --> 00:09:37,054
of course he was lonely.

185
00:09:41,367 --> 00:09:43,570
Sometimes things just don't click,

186
00:09:44,992 --> 00:09:47,031
whether it's with family or anyone else.

187
00:09:49,703 --> 00:09:51,398
As his big brother,

188
00:09:51,984 --> 00:09:53,531
I want to bring back the time

189
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:54,609
we lost as a family.

190
00:09:58,172 --> 00:09:59,797
That's why I came to pick him up.

191
00:10:02,140 --> 00:10:03,297
Mamiya Natsume,

192
00:10:05,507 --> 00:10:08,085
I know about your relationship with Toma.

193
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,617
But what can you do?

194
00:10:12,836 --> 00:10:13,797
Huh?

195
00:10:14,289 --> 00:10:15,367
Can you

196
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:18,028
fix his past?

197
00:10:19,437 --> 00:10:22,211
Only family can spend time as a family.

198
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,961
Don't you think so too?

199
00:10:44,115 --> 00:10:48,935
(Mamiya: You don't
need to pick me up today)

200
00:10:54,334 --> 00:10:55,939
We look forward to seeing you again.

201
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:04,998
Finally, it's settled down.

202
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:08,498
Only 15 minutes left.

203
00:11:09,419 --> 00:11:11,295
You two can go home now.

204
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:13,084
You both stayed late yesterday.

205
00:11:13,576 --> 00:11:14,529
I'll handle the rest.

206
00:11:14,888 --> 00:11:15,912
Got it.

207
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,920
Excuse me then.

208
00:11:18,467 --> 00:11:19,553
Thanks for your hard work.

209
00:11:19,904 --> 00:11:20,724
Thanks for your hard work.

210
00:11:20,842 --> 00:11:21,615
Thanks for your hard work.

211
00:11:29,717 --> 00:11:31,060
Natsume!

212
00:11:31,693 --> 00:11:32,552
Mom.

213
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:33,279
Thanks for your hard work.

214
00:11:33,342 --> 00:11:34,365
Thanks for your hard work.

215
00:11:34,412 --> 00:11:35,388
I came to pick up

216
00:11:35,405 --> 00:11:36,442
the lipstick I reserved!

217
00:11:36,466 --> 00:11:38,092
Please wait a moment.

218
00:11:40,927 --> 00:11:41,786
Toma.

219
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:50,724
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

220
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,208
- So? So?
- Tell us.

221
00:11:58,896 --> 00:12:00,263
Well...

222
00:12:01,365 --> 00:12:02,480
This is Sahashi Toma.

223
00:12:03,412 --> 00:12:05,482
He's working at the Ginza store.

224
00:12:05,693 --> 00:12:06,443
And...

225
00:12:07,615 --> 00:12:08,771
we're living together.

226
00:12:09,443 --> 00:12:11,751
So that means you guys are dating?

227
00:12:12,025 --> 00:12:13,048
Gosh!

228
00:12:13,873 --> 00:12:15,060
Guess we don't have to hide now.

229
00:12:15,091 --> 00:12:16,428
- Yeah.
- Wow!

230
00:12:17,551 --> 00:12:20,080
I'm Sahashi Toma, his boyfriend.

231
00:12:20,607 --> 00:12:21,810
Thank you for always taking care

232
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,411
of Natsume-san.

233
00:12:22,435 --> 00:12:24,208
- Likewise.
- Likewise.

234
00:12:24,209 --> 00:12:25,693
- Thank you for taking care of Natsume.
- Thank you for taking care of Natsume.

235
00:12:25,732 --> 00:12:26,755
Wait, Natsume.

236
00:12:26,928 --> 00:12:28,436
How did you snag such a handsome guy?

237
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:31,371
- What?
- You've got some skills, Natsume.

238
00:12:31,396 --> 00:12:33,506
Wait, Toma-kun, are you younger?

239
00:12:33,553 --> 00:12:34,170
Yes.

240
00:12:35,037 --> 00:12:36,622
No way! So cute!

241
00:12:36,623 --> 00:12:38,060
My heart is racing!

242
00:12:38,177 --> 00:12:40,286
Come on, stop messing around.

243
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:41,724
Way too cute.

244
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:42,411
By the way,

245
00:12:42,482 --> 00:12:44,348
are you going to the
fireworks festival tomorrow?

246
00:12:44,372 --> 00:12:45,465
Is that tomorrow?

247
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:47,661
Yeah, you used to go all the time.

248
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:49,021
Natsume used to love

249
00:12:49,029 --> 00:12:50,637
watching fireworks as a kid.

250
00:12:50,661 --> 00:12:51,802
Yeah, yeah.

251
00:12:51,872 --> 00:12:53,333
Ah, right.

252
00:12:53,661 --> 00:12:54,989
You should go with Toma-kun.

253
00:12:55,482 --> 00:12:57,896
Geez, Mom, you're such an instigator.

254
00:12:58,386 --> 00:12:59,886
Shall we go as well?

255
00:12:59,911 --> 00:13:01,715
- Shall we go as well?
- Behind them, yeah?

256
00:13:04,818 --> 00:13:06,700
You used to go to fireworks shows often?

257
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:08,841
Yeah.

258
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,466
When I was a kid, I went every year.

259
00:13:12,036 --> 00:13:14,020
My family called it a Mamiya tradition,

260
00:13:14,083 --> 00:13:15,252
and we all went together.

261
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,638
Hmm...

262
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,739
Sounds nice.

263
00:13:19,286 --> 00:13:20,674
Your family is so cheerful,

264
00:13:20,685 --> 00:13:22,682
it sounds like a Natsume-san family.

265
00:13:25,778 --> 00:13:26,549
Hey.

266
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,481
Today, Tenma-san told me…

267
00:13:34,035 --> 00:13:35,356
about your…

268
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:37,207
family.

269
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:41,207
I figured he would.

270
00:13:41,887 --> 00:13:42,582
So?

271
00:13:43,426 --> 00:13:44,480
Tenma-san

272
00:13:44,918 --> 00:13:46,614
wants to reconcile with you.

273
00:13:48,223 --> 00:13:50,793
He seemed to regret the past,

274
00:13:51,402 --> 00:13:53,731
- so...
- You're saying I should listen to him?

275
00:13:55,606 --> 00:13:57,043
I bet he said something like,

276
00:13:57,059 --> 00:13:58,691
'He must have been so lonely.'

277
00:13:58,715 --> 00:14:00,129
He's exaggerating.

278
00:14:00,567 --> 00:14:02,481
I was fine, doing things on my own.

279
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:03,441
But...

280
00:14:03,466 --> 00:14:05,248
For me, the distance we have now

281
00:14:05,264 --> 00:14:06,264
is normal,

282
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:07,934
and I have no complaints.

283
00:14:08,825 --> 00:14:11,059
You don't need to get involved.

284
00:14:11,356 --> 00:14:12,348
But...

285
00:14:15,762 --> 00:14:17,668
Maybe it's meddling to get involved.

286
00:14:19,348 --> 00:14:20,762
But even so…

287
00:14:21,864 --> 00:14:24,395
don't want you to abandon your family.

288
00:14:29,145 --> 00:14:30,332
Natsume-san?

289
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:33,450
Toma.

290
00:14:35,145 --> 00:14:36,715
Just go to New York.

291
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:41,590
I...

292
00:14:42,559 --> 00:14:44,332
think that's the best choice.

293
00:14:46,364 --> 00:14:47,934
You can figure out how to deal

294
00:14:48,364 --> 00:14:49,606
with your family after that.

295
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,676
What are you talking about?

296
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,238
I already told you,

297
00:14:52,254 --> 00:14:53,511
it's an exaggeration.

298
00:14:53,535 --> 00:14:54,682
Don't be swayed.

299
00:14:54,683 --> 00:14:56,129
I'm not being swayed.

300
00:14:57,567 --> 00:14:58,754
I'm telling you what

301
00:14:58,762 --> 00:14:59,973
I've thought through.

302
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,176
Time is limited.

303
00:15:05,028 --> 00:15:06,348
You might regret it if you

304
00:15:06,364 --> 00:15:08,097
don't try to make amends.

305
00:15:09,457 --> 00:15:10,481
So at least…

306
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,558
I only asked for one thing...

307
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:13,863
My time with you is more important.

308
00:15:14,715 --> 00:15:16,317
To abandon you and go somewhere else...

309
00:15:16,318 --> 00:15:18,239
I'm not saying we should break up.

310
00:15:19,637 --> 00:15:20,902
I just want you to spend

311
00:15:20,926 --> 00:15:22,347
some time with your family.

312
00:15:23,340 --> 00:15:24,676
It's just New York.

313
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:28,543
I can visit if I take some time off.

314
00:15:29,348 --> 00:15:30,410
For that matter...

315
00:15:32,207 --> 00:15:33,489
A little distance is fine.

316
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,278
Are you serious?

317
00:15:43,981 --> 00:15:46,013
You have a habit

318
00:15:46,363 --> 00:15:48,160
of making decisions for other people.

319
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,464
Like when you gave up on the event

320
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:52,222
for me without telling me.

321
00:15:53,348 --> 00:15:54,840
That really annoys me.

322
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,504
What do you mean it annoys you?

323
00:16:00,723 --> 00:16:03,137
I care about you too...

324
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:05,004
Then stay by my side.

325
00:16:05,817 --> 00:16:07,129
You're too nice to others.

326
00:16:08,121 --> 00:16:10,051
And you're too detached.

327
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:18,200
Maybe you need to cool off.

328
00:16:19,637 --> 00:16:21,965
It's you who has to cool off.

329
00:16:27,871 --> 00:16:28,817
That night…

330
00:16:31,176 --> 00:16:32,950
Toma didn't come home.

331
00:16:39,145 --> 00:16:40,200
Mamiya-san?

332
00:16:41,348 --> 00:16:42,067
Ah,

333
00:16:42,207 --> 00:16:43,348
Harukawa-kun.

334
00:16:43,457 --> 00:16:44,551
Hello.

335
00:16:45,113 --> 00:16:46,887
I live nearby, so…

336
00:16:48,559 --> 00:16:51,395
What? You and Sahashi-san had a fight?

337
00:16:51,989 --> 00:16:53,707
It's not really a fight.

338
00:16:54,307 --> 00:16:56,410
We just had a disagreement.

339
00:16:57,543 --> 00:16:59,200
I said something I shouldn't have said.

340
00:17:01,575 --> 00:17:03,684
Sorry for unloading this on you.

341
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:04,957
Not at all.

342
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:07,738
But shouldn't you try

343
00:17:07,763 --> 00:17:09,443
contacting Sahashi-san?

344
00:17:11,629 --> 00:17:12,676
Not just yet.

345
00:17:13,692 --> 00:17:14,972
If we meet now,

346
00:17:14,988 --> 00:17:16,761
I feel like we'll just argue again.

347
00:17:17,965 --> 00:17:19,200
I see.

348
00:17:21,090 --> 00:17:21,871
Ah.

349
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,629
I'd like to go to the restroom.

350
00:17:25,410 --> 00:17:26,371
Sure.

351
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:46,520
Mamiya-san.

352
00:17:47,606 --> 00:17:49,285
Let's hangout?

353
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:50,973
Huh?

354
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:59,489
Wow, yukata!

355
00:17:59,653 --> 00:18:01,504
I'm so glad we could rent yukatas!

356
00:18:03,035 --> 00:18:04,219
Fireworks are best

357
00:18:04,227 --> 00:18:05,907
enjoyed in yukatas, right?

358
00:18:06,825 --> 00:18:07,535
Yeah.

359
00:18:07,825 --> 00:18:09,231
I kind of got pushed here

360
00:18:09,256 --> 00:18:10,325
by the momentum.

361
00:18:10,965 --> 00:18:11,903
Honestly, by now,

362
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:13,441
I should be with him...

363
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:14,067
Ah!

364
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:16,496
There's a food stall over there!

365
00:18:17,082 --> 00:18:18,121
Since we're here,

366
00:18:18,145 --> 00:18:19,464
let's grab something to eat!

367
00:18:19,488 --> 00:18:21,239
- Ah, yeah.
- I'll go get it!

368
00:18:21,707 --> 00:18:22,707
Huh?

369
00:18:28,231 --> 00:18:29,121
Mmm!

370
00:18:29,637 --> 00:18:30,950
Delicious.

371
00:18:31,184 --> 00:18:33,020
Why is the yakisoba bought from

372
00:18:33,114 --> 00:18:34,754
a food stall so delicious?

373
00:18:34,793 --> 00:18:36,348
I guess it was the sauce.

374
00:18:36,754 --> 00:18:38,348
Yeah, you're right.

375
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,200
What would you like to eat next?

376
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:42,054
Umm...

377
00:18:42,106 --> 00:18:43,582
Candy apples.

378
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,200
Sure.

379
00:18:46,496 --> 00:18:48,746
It's not crowded around here,

380
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:49,983
we should get a good view

381
00:18:50,007 --> 00:18:51,061
of the fireworks.

382
00:18:52,379 --> 00:18:53,989
By the way, when do the fireworks start?

383
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,395
Thank you, Harukawa-kun.

384
00:19:02,715 --> 00:19:04,121
For cheering me up.

385
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,402
No problem.

386
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:07,527
Actually...

387
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,200
I was asked to do this.

388
00:19:10,418 --> 00:19:12,106
When we were at the café earlier,

389
00:19:12,223 --> 00:19:14,426
I secretly sent Sahashi-san a message,

390
00:19:14,848 --> 00:19:16,918
and he called me back immediately.

391
00:19:18,645 --> 00:19:20,504
Please come pick him up.

392
00:19:21,238 --> 00:19:24,269
Mamiya-san is really down

393
00:19:24,364 --> 00:19:25,614
after the fight with you.

394
00:19:26,417 --> 00:19:28,010
If I go now, it'll just turn into

395
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,377
another argument.

396
00:19:30,893 --> 00:19:32,003
But

397
00:19:32,901 --> 00:19:35,112
could you do me a favor instead?

398
00:19:36,534 --> 00:19:37,714
Sahashi-san

399
00:19:37,964 --> 00:19:39,401
asked me to help you take

400
00:19:39,426 --> 00:19:40,729
your mind off things.

401
00:19:42,651 --> 00:19:45,533
I owe both you and Sahashi-san

402
00:19:45,558 --> 00:19:47,597
immensely,

403
00:19:47,768 --> 00:19:48,745
so...

404
00:19:52,823 --> 00:19:53,932
I...

405
00:19:56,022 --> 00:19:58,358
didn't mean to make him that angry.

406
00:20:01,851 --> 00:20:03,163
I'm just worried about him.

407
00:20:04,179 --> 00:20:05,593
Because

408
00:20:07,522 --> 00:20:08,725
he's important to me.

409
00:20:12,554 --> 00:20:15,022
That's really all there is to it.

410
00:20:34,780 --> 00:20:36,030
Natsume-san...

411
00:20:36,717 --> 00:20:38,155
I finally found you.

412
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,671
Toma.

413
00:20:47,264 --> 00:20:49,287
Why is this place so hard to find?

414
00:20:49,452 --> 00:20:50,546
Sorry!

415
00:20:54,054 --> 00:20:54,967
Well,

416
00:20:55,296 --> 00:20:56,655
I'll take my leave now.

417
00:21:00,554 --> 00:21:01,718
Harukawa,

418
00:21:04,358 --> 00:21:05,319
thanks.

419
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:07,397
Yes!

420
00:21:14,194 --> 00:21:15,312
Now then...

421
00:21:20,890 --> 00:21:22,140
Natsume-san,

422
00:21:22,804 --> 00:21:24,382
what do you want me to do?

423
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:30,155
I...

424
00:21:32,630 --> 00:21:35,615
Only family can spend time as a family.

425
00:21:49,858 --> 00:21:50,983
I...

426
00:21:56,202 --> 00:21:57,671
What I can do for you...

427
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:02,632
is nothing at all.

428
00:22:11,435 --> 00:22:12,865
I can't give you

429
00:22:16,467 --> 00:22:17,685
family time.

430
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,974
And yet, you're...

431
00:22:25,013 --> 00:22:26,881
so kind to me always,

432
00:22:28,701 --> 00:22:31,545
and I'm worried if this is really okay.

433
00:22:37,019 --> 00:22:37,667
Huh?

434
00:22:37,826 --> 00:22:39,123
What's so funny?

435
00:22:39,131 --> 00:22:40,146
No, I'm sorry.

436
00:22:45,224 --> 00:22:46,404
That's alright.

437
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:50,904
As long as I can eat meals with you,

438
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:53,498
have silly conversations,

439
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,545
and

440
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,373
come to places like this with you.

441
00:23:02,701 --> 00:23:03,615
The feelings

442
00:23:05,037 --> 00:23:08,732
you've cherished with your family,

443
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:10,826
I'm experiencing

444
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,919
those now with you.

445
00:23:17,748 --> 00:23:18,974
Isn't that enough?

446
00:23:23,615 --> 00:23:24,615
Also, I am

447
00:23:26,568 --> 00:23:28,286
glad that you're so worried about me

448
00:23:28,311 --> 00:23:29,474
that it makes you cry.

449
00:23:33,146 --> 00:23:34,647
Can you smile for me?

450
00:23:36,654 --> 00:23:38,232
Are you really okay with this?

451
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,482
- Won't you regret...
- No.

452
00:23:46,709 --> 00:23:47,608
For me,

453
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:52,287
there's nothing more important than you.

454
00:23:55,404 --> 00:23:56,553
It's unfair.

455
00:23:57,951 --> 00:24:00,045
How can you smile so happily like that?

456
00:24:10,967 --> 00:24:11,920
I heard that

457
00:24:12,021 --> 00:24:14,067
- before coming here,
- You are my family,

458
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:16,380
- Sahashi met with his brother.
- so at least...

459
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:17,450
I am

460
00:24:17,779 --> 00:24:19,474
doing this job because I enjoy it.

461
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,381
Instead of relying on me,

462
00:24:22,896 --> 00:24:24,312
why don't you put in effort yourself?

463
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:26,576
- But, I...
- So what?

464
00:24:27,795 --> 00:24:29,748
There are things you can do, too.

465
00:24:31,763 --> 00:24:32,943
After all, you're my brother.

466
00:24:36,662 --> 00:24:37,631
It seems...

467
00:24:38,342 --> 00:24:39,951
you've changed.

468
00:24:40,848 --> 00:24:42,989
I never thought you'd encourage me.

469
00:24:43,373 --> 00:24:44,201
Because I

470
00:24:45,489 --> 00:24:47,239
have someone who worries about me.

471
00:24:50,842 --> 00:24:51,888
I see.

472
00:24:53,404 --> 00:24:55,490
What you really needed

473
00:24:55,599 --> 00:24:57,201
wasn't us,

474
00:24:58,678 --> 00:24:59,842
but that person.

475
00:25:07,787 --> 00:25:09,670
I'll make you happy.

476
00:25:12,964 --> 00:25:13,886
I promise.

477
00:25:30,513 --> 00:25:31,966
(Next episode)
Don't tell me that guy is

478
00:25:32,131 --> 00:25:33,560
thinking of retuning to being a model.

479
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:35,185
Come compete with me in sales.

480
00:25:35,248 --> 00:25:36,029
If I lose,

481
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:37,810
you can go back to being a model.

482
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:38,623
I got it.

483
00:25:38,716 --> 00:25:40,615
I'll wait and see when you get serious.

484
00:25:40,701 --> 00:25:42,193
The time we have together

485
00:25:42,201 --> 00:25:43,450
like that is so important.

486
00:25:43,474 --> 00:25:45,997
I want to be important to you
so much that I'm going crazy.
