00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
How much money are you going to give me now?

3
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,000
Don't even try to be cold!

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm sorry.

5
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Hey.

6
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,000
Huh?

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
Actually, I saw everything.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,000
Oh, did you?

9
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
I don't think I would have forgiven him right away.

10
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
But that's the beginning, right?

11
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,000
I'm sorry.

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
There were 31 people.

13
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,000
The people I had to ask for forgiveness.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
But do you know what's really painful?

15
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,000
There are some of them that I don't remember their faces.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Wow, you were a really bad guy.

17
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,000
You can keep apologizing sincerely.

18
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
The people will forgive you anyway.

19
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Don't you need time for them too?

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Thank you, Woosol.

21
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
There's a lot of courage because of you.

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Don't say that. It's creepy.

23
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,000
I'm sorry.

24
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,000
It's creepy.

25
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
But I think I still lack courage.

26
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I have something to tell you.

27
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I'll tell you when I'm done with the homework.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Homework?

29
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm so hungry.

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Let's go to Hanseong Young-nae today and eat.

31
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Don't change the subject.

32
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
There's something like that.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Only real men can do it.

34
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then you can't do it forever.

35
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm not a real man.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
So tell me.

37
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You always have to tell me that men should know how to wait.

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
A man who is a man of honor.

39
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I'll finish everything I have to do and wait for the sky to come.

40
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
A public place.

41
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
I'm sorry.

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I'm sorry.

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
You're so mean.

44
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
You're Han Sung-kyung's cousin.

45
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Sung-kyung's cousin.

46
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm sorry.

47
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm sorry.

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I'm sorry.

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm sorry.

50
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'm sorry.

52
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm sorry.

53
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I'm sorry.

54
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:58,000
I'm sorry.

55
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I'm sorry.

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,000
I'm sorry.

57
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm sorry.

59
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,000
I'm sorry.

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I'm sorry.

62
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I'm sorry.

63
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,000
I'm sorry.

64
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I'm sorry.

66
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm sorry.

67
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I'm sorry.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I'm sorry.

69
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'm sorry.

70
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I'm sorry.

71
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000
I'm sorry.

72
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
I'm sorry.

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I'm sorry.

75
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
You're the one, aren't you?

76
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Cha Woo-sol.

77
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:00,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

79
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:06,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

80
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:12,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

81
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:18,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

82
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

83
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

84
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

85
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

86
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:50,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

87
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:59,000
The water is getting deeper and deeper

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,020
her

89
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:05,800
days

90
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:12,740
after

91
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:18,640
days

92
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,800
Bleeding

93
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,800
I'm sorry.

94
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,300
It's you, right? Cha Usol.

95
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,400
Who are you? Why were you alive?

96
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,640
What were you doing when Lee Eunjun died?

97
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,740
What were you doing?

98
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,200
I'm sorry.

99
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm sorry.

100
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:03,960
Tell me.

101
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,260
Why was Eunjun dead?

102
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:09,800
What were you doing when he died?

103
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:12,400
Why? Why?

104
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,800
Why?

105
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:16,900
Let go. Let go!

106
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,900
I'm sorry.

107
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,800
I'm sorry.

108
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:23,100
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:26,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

110
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,900
If you're sorry, save Lee Eunjun.

111
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,700
Save him!

112
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,300
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

113
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,900
I'm sorry.

114
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,200
Wait.

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
Let go.

116
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,300
Eunjun is still alive.

117
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,300
Wait.

118
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,700
Why?

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,800
Why was he alive?

120
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,900
Eunjun, get out!

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,100
Save him!

122
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,400
You idiot.

123
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,500
Eunjun.

124
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,300
Don't hate me too much.

125
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:27,700
It's all because of me.

126
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,500
Because of me,

127
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,400
Eunjun...

128
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:36,900
It happened like that.

129
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,300
When he first came to us, he said he'd never turn me down.

130
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,500
He said he'd just do this with me.

131
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,800
I'm sorry.

132
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:52,800
I'm sorry.

133
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:53,800
I'm sorry.

134
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:54,800
Why?

135
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,200
EVAN,

136
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
he asked for the food.

137
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,800
I get angry

138
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,800
when I do this to someone.

139
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
I said, get out!

140
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,080
What did he say in the car this time?

141
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:26,080
He said it's not the case because you're like this.

142
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,680
I said it's not the case!

143
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:34,480
He knew he couldn't forgive the stupid guy who was rude to me when he was in college.

144
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,360
He said he felt like a human being for the first time.

145
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,280
His life was like trash.

146
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:43,600
Thanks to you, Cha Woo-sol,

147
00:08:43,920 --> 00:08:46,000
I feel like a human being for the first time.

148
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,040
But if you're like this,

149
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,480
he'll like you a lot.

150
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,600
Don't make him feel bad.

151
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,600
I did an emergency treatment, so I can go later.

152
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,320
Yoon Ji-hee!

153
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,040
Mom, come home right now!

154
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm the reason why you're like this.

155
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,600
But how can I do that?

156
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,120
Ji-hee, Ji-hee, what's wrong?

157
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
Ji-hee!

158
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Hello?

159
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
Ji-hee!

160
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,320
Hello?

161
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
Mom, I'll call you later.

162
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
Ji-hee!

163
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,320
Ji-hee!

164
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,320
You can't sleep if you keep looking for me.

165
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,320
Can't you see I'm working?

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,320
Let's live together.

167
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:02,320
What?

168
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,320
What are you doing?

169
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Answer it.

170
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
This is a case of being stabbed.

171
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
It's hard. I'll take care of it alone.

172
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,320
So you decide the outcome.

173
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,320
But,

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,320
why did you do that?

175
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
You're so annoying.

176
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,320
It's only been two days.

177
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Hey,

178
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,320
you have to be careful this time.

179
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,320
It's a murder case.

180
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
It's been two days.

181
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,320
Okay.

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,320
Take care of the case.

183
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,320
Okay.

184
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,320
Hey.

185
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,320
You look like a cop.

186
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,320
Grandma, I heard you well.

187
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,320
Yes.

188
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
If you need help,

189
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,320
please contact me here.

190
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Thank you.

191
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,320
You must be very sad.

192
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,320
Cheer up.

193
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,320
It will be solved.

194
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,320
Grandma.

195
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,320
So,

196
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
the police are after Hyun-woo?

197
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,320
I'm going to die.

198
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,320
What should we do now?

199
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,320
I'll leave it here.

200
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,320
What is it?

201
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,320
I delivered it well.

202
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Hey.

203
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,320
Isn't it a living old man?

204
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,320
Change it to a new one.

205
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
Okay.

206
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
Let's go.

207
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,320
Oh, my God.

208
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,320
Oh, my God.

209
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,320
Oh, my God.

210
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:24,320
We're the ones who are the police.

211
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:28,320
Stop it.

212
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,320
What are we going to do?

213
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,320
We'll catch the police or kill them.

214
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,320
If we had been so nice to him,

215
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,320
he would have been angry with us.

216
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,320
Do you want to go to the police?

217
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,320
Is that what you want?

218
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,320
Is that what you want?

219
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,320
Hyun-woo.

220
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,320
You should go now.

221
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Get out if you're tired.

222
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,320
I'll go alone if you don't go.

223
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,320
Are you tired? Do I look tired?

224
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:56,320
I want to kill you.

225
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
But this is not the time.

226
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,320
We have to catch them now.

227
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,320
Are you crazy?

228
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Are you a gangster?

229
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
I'm not done yet.

230
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,320
I'm not done yet.

231
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
Oh, my God.

232
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
I think you're still a little scared.

233
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,320
I have something to tell you.

234
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:48,320
I'll tell you when I'm done with the job.

235
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Job?

236
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,320
What is it? Tell me.

237
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,320
No, there's something like that.

238
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:56,320
Only real people can do it.

239
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,320
I hope you're not crazy.

240
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
I hope you're not too.

241
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,320
I hope you're not too.

242
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,320
I'm going to kill you.

243
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:20,320
I'm going to kill you.

244
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,320
I'm going to kill you.

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,320
I'm going to kill you.

246
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,320
I'm going to kill you.

247
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Sung-ryong was right.

248
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:38,320
I hope that I won't fall until the end.

249
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:48,040
L tod you said just to look at yourokay los

250
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:54,360
O

251
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,140
I went for a

252
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,260
ting

253
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,800
You

254
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:06,600
Oh

255
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,440
Can it's fine?

256
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:20,480
Give me some time.

257
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,240
I'm's paying back the debt of cut this company.

258
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,720
Please promise to talk.

259
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:33,960
Or you will regret it later.

260
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:37,260
I should at least pay for the crimes Won-jun did.

261
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,300
But this time, I'll make a proper plan.

262
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,260
I'm coming with you.

263
00:15:44,840 --> 00:15:46,140
It's my brother's job.

264
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,600
I'm coming with you.

265
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,600
Hey, it's dangerous. We can't go together.

266
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,040
I don't think this is right.

267
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:26,440
If you believe that the path you chose is the right one,

268
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:29,440
you should believe that you have to go even if it's hard.

269
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,940
Won-jun ran.

270
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:36,540
The path we're going to take is definitely dangerous,

271
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,540
but nothing will change if we give up.

272
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,040
So we have to go.

273
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,040
I'll be back.

274
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,600
Look at me now

275
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,600
Look at me now

276
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:10,600
Look at me now

277
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,600
Even if a huge storm comes...

278
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,600
The next day

279
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,600
Why do I keep getting weird things?

280
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:03,600
This is weird.

281
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,600
There's a reason for everything.

282
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:07,600
Come out.

283
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,600
Oh, I guess you're taking a lot.

284
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,600
Isn't this a little too much?

285
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
What?

286
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,600
Who takes a picture of a school card with a sticker?

287
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
Hey, you said you'd give me two for 4,000 won.

288
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,600
Isn't this too much?

289
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
Does it look right from the size?

290
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,600
Where's a picture of a longer proof than a new one?

291
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,600
Oh, is that so?

292
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,600
Oh, I'm so tired of saying that.

293
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,600
Let's get out of here.

294
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,600
Oh, wait a minute.

295
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,600
Then you can take it like this.

296
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,600
I'll take it for you.

297
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:43,600
I'll take it with an album.

298
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,600
Is it a little weird?

299
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,600
It's a little weird.

300
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm embarrassed to see the kids.

301
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,600
Come on, come on, come on, come on.

302
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:53,600
Look at this. Look at this. I brought it.

303
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:55,600
This is your favorite meat.

304
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,600
Oh, meat. Okay, okay, okay.

305
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,600
Jung Sang-hyuk, let's go out with the normal people.

306
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,600
Yes, sir.

307
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,600
Let's go.

308
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,600
Oh, my God.

309
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:06,600
Here we go.

310
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,600
And if you don't look at this, it's absolutely a misunderstanding.

311
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,600
What's wrong with you?

312
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,600
I'm giving you two for 4,000 won.

313
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,600
How can you give me a chance like this?

314
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:18,600
Look at that. Stop it.

315
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:20,600
I'm going to get you all.

316
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:23,600
This idiot is here to take a picture of a school card.

317
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,600
That's right.

318
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
Wait a minute, brothers.

319
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,600
Listen to me.

320
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Then shouldn't we turn our heads like this?

321
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,600
Look, he's saying the same thing as me.

322
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:35,600
You know how good Woo-sol is at studying, right?

323
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:36,600
He was the best in school.

324
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:37,600
Yeah.

325
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,600
I'm going crazy.

326
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,600
Su-jin fell too much.

327
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,600
No!

328
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,600
Oh, my God.

329
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,600
I almost fell.

330
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:46,600
I almost fell.

331
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
You're not allowed to say you're falling here.

332
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:53,600
If Won-jun really falls, if he falls, you'll take responsibility.

333
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:54,600
You shouldn't have said that.

334
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,600
Oh, I fell.

335
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,600
I fell.

336
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Woo-sol, I'm going to fall because of you.

337
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:05,600
I'm sorry.

338
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:06,600
All right, all right, all right.

339
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,600
Let's take a picture and go.

340
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,600
Mr. Han.

341
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:13,600
Am I your ATM?

342
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,600
What's wrong with the boss?

343
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:16,600
I have money, too.

344
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
I have money.

345
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,600
I have a deposit of money.

346
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:24,600
Here you go.

347
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,600
There's a place to put coins in here.

348
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:27,600
Oh, there's nothing.

349
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,600
Is this 1,000 won?

350
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,600
Get out of here.

351
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:36,600
Oh, the owner of the bank.

352
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:38,600
Hey, what was that?

353
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,600
Should we try this first?

354
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,600
This or this?

355
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:42,600
No, this is the same as before.

356
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,600
Come out.

357
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,600
Oh, my God.

358
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,600
Where should I look?

359
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,600
Where should I look?

360
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,600
With the lens.

361
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:49,600
Let's pose first.

362
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Okay, okay.

363
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:54,600
All right, all right.

364
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
Hey, what kind of funeral is this?

365
00:20:56,600 --> 00:20:58,600
Everyone, smile cute.

366
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,600
Shouldn't we pose?

367
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:01,600
I'm a heart.

368
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,600
Heart, heart.

369
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:04,600
It's a little bigger.

370
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,600
But Han Sung-ryong, you're this tall.

371
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,600
It's been a while since I touched my feet.

372
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm going to get caught in the middle of the pig and die.

373
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:15,600
I'll go ahead.

374
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:17,600
Hey, hey, hey.
