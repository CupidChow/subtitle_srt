00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:10,000
Please, don't do it.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:11,000
Hey, Um Seon-ah!

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Poke it.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,000
Poke it.

6
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Poke it.

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Here.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
I heard that you were a school bully in middle school.

9
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
You have to use your intention to escape from the prison.

10
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,000
Do you admit to this?

11
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Please teach me how to fight.

12
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,000
I want to be strong like a dog.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Pull harder.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
You know the shark, right?

15
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,560
The shark doesn't have any

16
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:06,000
so it won't swim for a while.

17
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,000
It will sink.

18
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,000
So it will keep swimming until it dies.

19
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Don't stop.

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
The school bully

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The school bully

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The social

23
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:17,000
aitings

24
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Six months have passed since seating room and fight ended.

25
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
It's been six months.

26
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Hey, the bus is coming.

27
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
Hurry up.

28
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Hurry up.

29
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Thank you.

30
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Thank you.

31
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Thank you.

32
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I'm still struggling to keep it from stopping.

33
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
One more driver, please.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,000
The bus doesn't wait for us.

35
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Wow, it's so clean.

36
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
Wow, it's really clean.

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Sung Yong-hee, who was a real fool, started a food truck.

38
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Give me some candy.

39
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
I told you to give me candy.

40
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Give me candy.

41
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Give me candy.

42
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Let's eat first and come back.

43
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
Jun-hee is preparing to be inspected while he's working.

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
You are sleeping.

45
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
While you're sleeping, your brain is...

46
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Sang-yeop, who missed his career as a player during his time at school,

47
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:48,000
went back to the gym.

48
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,000
We promised each other.

49
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Even if the devil called the ex-hospitalist pushed us,

50
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,000
we will never give up.

51
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We will definitely be better than yesterday.

52
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,000
We are running after the past.

53
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Like a shark without any regrets.

54
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
The recording is on.

55
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:34,000
You can turn it on.

56
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Hey, I went to the gym.

57
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You're okay with a young major?

58
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm not a player. I'm a part-timer.

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I'm working at a dormitory, cleaning and washing clothes.

60
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
What are you laughing at?

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I've solved the dormitory.

62
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,000
After the gym, I work out with Sang-yeop and train separately.

63
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Isn't it great?

64
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Do you have to be a martial artist?

65
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,000
You don't stop the shark.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Why did I say that?

67
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But if you work hard, you'll get a chance.

68
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I'm good at it.

69
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
You think you can beat most opponents, right?

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
It's easy to get into trouble when it's you.

71
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I didn't do anything.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Listen to me.

73
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
It was six months ago,

74
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,000
but you beat Bae Seok-chan, the famous man among the groupers.

75
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I'm not a player.

76
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
It's not like that.

77
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I'm not like that.

78
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Then forget it.

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Anyway, don't move at that moment.

80
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
You know, right?

81
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
So where am I now?

82
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes.

83
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Do your best.

84
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
I'll be with you forever.

85
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I'll be with you forever.

86
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
I'll be with you forever.

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Do your best.

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
I'll cheer for you.

89
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Thank you.

90
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Good.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll wake you up after the afternoon training.

92
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Hurry up.

93
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yes.

94
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Gloves.

95
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
I wiped it with alcohol and put it in the locker.

96
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
You can take it out and use it.

97
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
You're a jerk.

98
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Open it.

99
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
Open it.

100
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Open it.

101
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Open it.

102
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Our Seok-chan is so cool.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Can't you see me fighting like this?

104
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
More, more, more.

105
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Who's the human sandbag today?

106
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
No one.

107
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Everyone ran away.

108
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're a fan of Ju Il-tae.

109
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
You should've brought it.

110
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I'm paying you for that.

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
If you come back, you'll beat me.

112
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
If you beat me, you'll run away.

113
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Then you can take her.

114
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Yeah, you can do it.

115
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Try it.

116
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Hey, murder.

117
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Hey.

118
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
You come up.

119
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Come up, you punk.

120
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Hey.

121
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
Give me a protective suit.

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Sandbag is already crazy.

123
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Hey, do you know?

124
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
If you beat a professional player, the manager will make you a player.

125
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You punk.

126
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
Wow, Sandbag looks great.

127
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
What is it?

128
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
You punk.

129
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
You're good at avoiding.

130
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
You can wear it.

131
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'll just try it.

132
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
With the same conditions.

133
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You're a good player.

134
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
You can be my former detective.

135
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Hit me.

136
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Hit me, you punk.

137
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I'll just try it.

138
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
Hit me.

139
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
You punk.

140
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
You punk.

141
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
You punk.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
You punk.

143
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Are you okay?

144
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
You have to take the test today.

145
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
You punk, get out of here.

146
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
You punk.

147
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Who told you to come up to the ring?

148
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
I'm sorry.

149
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
If Sang-yeop doesn't want you to be kicked out,

150
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Get rid of him quickly in front of me.

151
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
You punk.

152
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Please check the signal with your voice.

153
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
The signal has been confirmed.

154
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,000
This device is a ticket to the VBRP match that the chairman of the board invited.

155
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
It's a betting device.

156
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,000
If you lose, you can put a threat on your owner's side.

157
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Please make sure to use it.

158
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Then enjoy tonight's match.

159
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The basic bet for the opening match is 5,000.

160
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Jeb, you're definitely showing your back.

161
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
It's going to explode.

162
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
It's going to explode.

163
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
It's going to explode.

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
It's going to explode.

165
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,000
It's going to explode.

166
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
They're very sensitive.

167
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
It's very fierce.

168
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,000
Anyway, the target is the hook.

169
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
If you hit that, you'll faint.

170
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
The front is very damaged.

171
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
It's very fierce.

172
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Oh, and the distance is narrow.

173
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,000
Hey, Jun-gi.

174
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Get ready to stop here.

175
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
It's going to be a lot of damage.

176
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
The match can end like this.

177
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
It's going to be a lot of damage.

178
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,000
It was a game where the poison of the god who has won the long-awaited victory was exposed.

179
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Wait a minute.

180
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Today's last game starts.

181
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Before the betting, you can check the player's power and record in the app.

182
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Betting is impossible to cancel.

183
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
It is possible to repeat betting.

184
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Finally, today's main event begins.

185
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
F1G's best three-man one-shot success.

186
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
F1G's best three-man one-shot success.

187
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
I hit the first one.

188
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
I hit the first one.

189
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
The man with 83.3% win rate.

190
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
The one who is the winner of the Songgu World Challenge is...

191
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Tank!

192
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,000
You've been waiting for this two-player game for a long time.

193
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
Now, let's get started!

194
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:12,000
You didn't get the player.

195
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Yeah.

196
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
It's going to be fun.

197
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I'm going to tell you the news.

198
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,000
The opponent's player has been changed.

199
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,000
According to the rules of this event, the new betting starts.

200
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,000
We will start a new betting based on the rules.

201
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Who is the new challenger facing the tank?

202
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,000
What is this?

203
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,000
Before the new player is revealed,

204
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:55,000
10 times the amount of money will be paid regardless of the betting.

205
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
After the betting, it is impossible to change.

206
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Would you like to participate in the shocking event?

207
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,000
10 times shocking betting countdown begins.

208
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,000
Shocking betting is over.

209
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,000
From now on, we will proceed in the existing way of betting.

210
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,000
Who is the special player that everyone is curious about?

211
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Now I will reveal the player.

212
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,000
Today's special final game!

213
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:40,000
Chairman Hyun Woo-young!

214
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,000
With Chairman Hyun Woo-young's special appearance,

215
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,000
we will make new rules for fair games.

216
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,000
I'm going crazy.

217
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,000
The tank will win if it lasts for 30 seconds.

218
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
I will say it again.

219
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,000
If you last for 30 seconds,

220
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:02,000
the tank wins!

221
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,000
It's Hyun Woo-young.

222
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
Hey, Hyun Woo-young!

223
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Why are you so nervous?

224
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Don't be nervous.

225
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
It's fun.

226
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Just hit me once.

227
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Then I'll wipe all your blood.

228
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
How is it?

229
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Tank fighting!

230
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't shoot the tank!

231
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Now the normal betting will be over.

232
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:58,000
5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

233
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,000
Ready and fight!

234
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Down!

235
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:28,000
The tank is down in 10 seconds!

236
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Why?

237
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
There are still 10 seconds left.

238
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I'm sorry.

239
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
Jo Chul-ho, I think you can come to the dorm tonight.

240
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
What?

241
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
Really?

242
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:03,000
I thought you were just being chased.

243
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
I'm so glad. Thank you.

244
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
No, I'm going to the hyungs.

245
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
What about you?

246
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
I'm having a hard time today.

247
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Tell them what I need to say.

248
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Okay, I'll see you later.

249
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Bye.

250
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,000
It's terrible to see you like this.

251
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,000
How much money are you going to spend now?

252
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Don't even think about it.

253
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Just...

254
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Where are you running away from?

255
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,000
What are you doing?

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,000
I'm going to the hyungs.

257
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,000
I'm going to the hyungs.

258
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Hey, Won-jun, I'm sorry.

259
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,000
Run!

260
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,000
Run!

261
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,000
Run!

262
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
Can you run?

263
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,000
I said run!

264
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,000
Run!

265
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Won-jun.

266
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Oh?

267
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Oh?

268
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Jo Chul-ho.

269
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
When did you come?

270
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Just now.

271
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Aren't you going to Sung-ryong?

272
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
Oh, okay.

273
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

274
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
Oh, right.

275
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,000
You said you were kicked out.

276
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,000
I almost did, but I got over it.

277
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
What kind of bastard is this?

278
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It's complicated to say.

279
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Life is not easy, is it?

280
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,000
But it's the path I chose, so I have to go even if it's hard.

281
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:59,000
Thank you, Oh Seol-ah.

282
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
What?

283
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
There's something like that.

284
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,000
I'll go to Sung-ryong and have a beer.

285
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
You said you were going to lose weight.

286
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Where's the weight I'm going to lose?

287
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,000
If you take it off, it's the same as you.

288
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Wow.

289
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Here's the Hawaiian pizza you ordered.

290
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Thank you.

291
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,000
It's a service.

292
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Thank you.

293
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
It's delicious.

294
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
I've told you a few times, but it's a gift.

295
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
300,000 won.

296
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,000
The boss is a four-leaf clover.

297
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,000
What kind of fries are you doing?

298
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,000
300,000 won.

299
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
Don't you calculate what you've been eating?

300
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:51,000
Oh, pizza is burning.

301
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,000
Oh, shit.

302
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Oh Seol-ah, let's eat deliciously.

303
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,000
I'm not going to fall for it.

304
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,000
Give me everything, you pig.

305
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,000
Oh, you're a coward.

306
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Don't you think it's gotten worse because you're always hanging around in the prison?

307
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,000
But brother, 300,000 won is a bit too much.

308
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Oh Seol-ah, you're on my side.

309
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
Don't do that.

310
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
I don't know if it's his brother or not.

311
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It would be embarrassing if I knew that Jin-hye always eats for free.

312
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,000
Hey, this monkey.

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,000
No matter how much you do it, your family doesn't fall over.

314
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
Isn't this a good thing?

315
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
But brother, did you have a younger brother?

316
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,000
It's so pretty.

317
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,000
But why does this guy look like this?

318
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:35,000
I'm getting a face-scratching from Han-sung.

319
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
Oh Seol-ah, be honest.

320
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
Who's better?

321
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
It's obvious.

322
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
It's me, right?

323
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I think each of you has a different style.

324
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Oh, tell me the truth.

325
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,000
It's me.

326
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Answer me quickly.

327
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,000
Bring me some alcohol.

328
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,000
Hey, we're customers here.

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Tell the boss to bring it.

330
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Son, you ask if you don't have feet.

331
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,000
I have feet, so tell him to bring it quickly.

332
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,000
If you don't want to die, can you tell him to move?

333
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:12,000
Should I ride a horse?

334
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,000
Should I show you a kick?

335
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,000
I should ask him to do it.

336
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Jung-bi, look at the referee.

337
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,000
It's ridiculous.

338
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,000
You have to do it.

339
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
You have to do it.

340
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,000
Oh, Ji-hee, are you here?

341
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,000
Sir, are you here?

342
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
Sit here.

343
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Mr. Han, what are you doing?

344
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,000
I don't have alcohol.

345
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
I'll bring it.

346
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,000
Sorry, I'm late.

347
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
The next part-time job is a little late.

348
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
No, we just came.

349
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Sir, let's have a cool drink.

350
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,000
I told you to treat me comfortably when I'm on vacation.

351
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Hey, hey.

352
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,000
Isn't a teacher an eternal teacher?

353
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
What kind of wind blows to go to college?

354
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:13,960
Don't be a

355
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
I know how to study.

356
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
You look down on me?

357
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,000
Can't I study?

358
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Yeah, you can't.

359
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,000
You can't, too.

360
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Why can't I?

361
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
Are you the same as me?

362
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,000
From the beginning, with me.

363
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Hey.

364
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,000
Hey, Ji-hee, what's wrong with you?

365
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,000
Shall we all cheers?

366
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Let's all do it together.

367
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
What are you doing?

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,000
Sir, you're a little drunk.

369
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,000
