1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,000
No!

2
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,500
This is an opportunity.

3
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,200
An opportunity for you to take revenge.

4
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:54,200
This is a video file.

5
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,800
Take it with you,

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
or play a game with me.

7
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
No!

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
You have to pay for your choice.

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,500
Get up!

10
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,500
Who's next?

11
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
Is your family more stimulating than your friends?

12
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
Why are you doing this?

13
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:34,500
Why?

14
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,000
It's fun.

15
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Shit!

16
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,000
It hurts, right?

17
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Are you surprised?

18
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
Shit!

19
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
I told you to play it safe.

20
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Shit!

21
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shit!

22
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Shit!

23
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Shit!

24
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Shit!

25
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Do you think I called you to play like this?

26
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Get up.

27
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Get up.

28
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
I won't hit you.

29
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,000
Get up.

30
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's okay.

31
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Get up.

32
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Shit!

33
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
Come under me.

34
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,000
Shit!

35
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Come in.

36
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Get up!

37
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Turn it off.

38
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Why?

39
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Are you scared of being like this?

40
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
Turn it off, you bastard!

41
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Come on.

42
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
He's fighting with a knife.

43
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Why aren't you fighting?

44
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Shit!

45
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Is this all you've got?

46
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Is this all you've got?

47
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,000
Shit!

48
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,000
Are you okay?

49
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,000
Keep going.

50
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Shit!

51
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
You should have done this sooner.

52
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Shit!

53
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Come on.

54
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Shit!

55
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Shit!

56
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,000
Shit!

57
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,000
Shit!

58
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
Shit!

59
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
Shit!

60
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
Shit!

61
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,000
Shit!

62
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Shit!

63
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,000
Shit!

64
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Shit!

65
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Come on, you bastard.

66
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,000
I'm the one who's going to finish you.

67
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Shit!

68
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Shit!

69
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Shit!

70
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,000
Shit!

71
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Shit!

72
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Shit!

73
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
Shit!

74
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
Shit!

75
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Shit!

76
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Shit!

77
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Shit!

78
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Shit!

79
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,000
Shit!

80
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,000
Shit!

81
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,000
Shit!

82
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Shit!

83
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Shit!

84
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,000
Shit!

85
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Shit!

86
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
Shit!

87
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,000
Shit!

88
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Shit!

89
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
Shit!

90
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
Shit!

91
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,000
Shit!

92
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Shit!

93
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,000
Shit!

94
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,000
Shit!

95
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,000
Shit!

96
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,000
You're going to regret saving me.

97
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,000
I'm different from you.

98
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
You can't shut me down

99
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
This is who I want to be

100
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:13,000
This is who I want to be

101
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
You hear the crying

102
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
It makes me run it

103
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,000
You cannot control

104
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,000
Have you seen the devil

105
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Aiming for prey

106
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:38,000
It never stopped till it's done

107
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:44,000
This is the time to be end

108
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
And I'm never gonna be lost my mind

109
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Let's get started

110
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:56,000
And I will never ever lose to you

111
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:02,000
This is what I want to be

112
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:07,000
This is where I want to grow

113
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
This is what I want tiny

114
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:15,000
No one can shut me down

115
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,000
This is who I want to be

116
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
This is who I want to be

117
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,000
This is who I want to be

118
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:30,000
This is who I want to be

119
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
This is who I want to be

120
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:36,000
This is who I want to be

121
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,000
This is who I want to be

122
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:42,000
This is who I want to be

123
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,000
This is who I want to be

124
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
This is who I want to be

125
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,000
This is where I want to be

126
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,000
This is where I want to be

127
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:51,000
I'll be right back

128
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,000
I'm sorry

129
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Bro

130
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
I

131
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,000
I already forgive you a long time ago

132
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,000
I'm sorry

133
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,000
I think you're Lee Wonjun's brother

134
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
I'm afraid you're not his brother

135
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,000
You're not gonna be happy

136
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Bro, I'm not gonna be happy

137
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
He's not gonna be happy

138
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
He's not gonna be happy

139
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:04,000
Bro, you know the back end is not good, right?

140
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
Correct

141
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:08,000
It's so noisy when you go alone

142
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,000
I'm scared of the wind

143
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
I heard about Wonjun

144
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,000
Bro, I think I know now

145
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:48,000
What I really want

146
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
What do you mean?

147
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,000
When I fight, I feel alive

148
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I thought people like Bae Seok-chan liked me

149
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,000
I enjoyed it too

150
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,000
So I'm going to keep fighting

151
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:06,000
I'm going to fight

152
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,000
Not a fight that's being dragged by the situation

153
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,000
I want to fight a fight that I choose

154
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What am I going to do?

155
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
You're going to be a fighter, right?

156
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Yes, I'm going to be a fighter

157
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
What did you say before?

158
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
Please fight with me, bro

159
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,000
What?

160
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:32,000
I'll work hard and be a cool fighter like you

161
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:36,000
Please fight with me then

162
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,000
Hey, if you want to be like me, you have to work harder than now

163
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,000
You know that, right?

164
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:07,000
Sang-ho swims for the rest of his life because he has no regrets

165
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,000
So I decided to keep moving without stopping

166
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,000
But I finally realized how heavy that decision is

167
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:26,000
As if Wonjun apologized even if he wasn't forgiven

168
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:33,000
Sometimes we have to do something even if we don't achieve it 100%

169
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
World Rookie Champion

170
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:51,000
590

171
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,000
World Rookie Champion

172
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,000
590

173
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Even if today's decision comes at a different weight

174
00:24:41,000 --> 00:24:43,000
I have to keep moving

175
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,000
I decided to fight to live

176
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Instead of fighting to live

177
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,000
I decided to live

178
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,000
590

179
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,000
World Rookie Champion

180
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,000
590

181
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,000
World Rookie Champion

182
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:27,000
590

183
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,000
World Rookie Champion

184
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,000

187
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,000
World Rookie Champion

188
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,000
590

189
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,000
World Rookie Champion

190
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,000
590

191
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:10,000
World Rookie Champion

192
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,000
590

193
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,000
World Rookie Champion

194
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,000

195
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,000
World Rookie Champion

196
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,000
590

197
