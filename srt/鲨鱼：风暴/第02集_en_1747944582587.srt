1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,200
ุง

2
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
The body of a fighter known as Son Got was found at Han River this morning.

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:44,000
It is said that it was a case of conflict with the manager, and the manager who killed Son Got is said to be taking his own life.

4
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,000
Among the bodies, Choi Mo-young, who was Son Got's lover, was also found.

5
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Did you wake up?

6
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:40,000
Where are my friends?

7
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Look, I'm looking for a friend first. I told you I'd be like this.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Why are you doing this?

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I told you to see me later. How have you been?

10
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,000
I think I should change a little bit. So I'm building a church here.

11
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Where are my friends?

12
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I'm talking to you now. Focus.

13
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I'm sorry.

14
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I recently got a coffee injury.

15
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,000
So I read books and watched documentaries.

16
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:44,000
I found out that in Africa, they send children to the battlefield.

17
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I don't know that. Where are my friends, Ji-hee and Won-jun?

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Ji-hee!

19
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,000
They don't make children go crazy, but they shoot people with guns.

20
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
In Africa.

21
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Now, how do you make them go crazy?

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Put on your blindfold and shoot them.

23
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I thought you were shooting at a wall with nothing.

24
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Take off your blindfold and you'll see a person dead in front of you.

25
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Because of the gun you shot.

26
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
What about him?

27
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He'll go crazy, right?

28
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
After that, you'll do everything you're told.

29
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Now, let's understand the African kids' mentality.

30
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
If you know, pick one.

31
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Pick one. Who do you want to kill?

32
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You're not that smart, are you?

33
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:11,000
It's simple. If you choose, he dies and the rest lives.

34
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You have nothing to be hurt.

35
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Oh, pick one. Who do you want to save?

36
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,000
That's more convenient.

37
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
You two have nothing to do with each other, so can't you just let me go?

38
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Oh, shit!

39
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
I'm not fun, U-sol.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,000
I want to be with you until the end, but I have another schedule.

41
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Anyway, pick one.

42
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Good luck, U-sol.

43
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

44
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I just have to stay.

45
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Wait a minute.

46
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

48
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

49
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Put it on record.

50
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
If you can't, just kill them both.

51
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Wait!

52
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Wait!

53
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Please, wait!

54
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Look at him.

55
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
I'm so good at this.

56
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Hey, right.

57
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Record.

58
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Hey, Jun-gyu.

59
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'm so good at this.

60
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm going to have to go to the salon.

61
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Hey, pick one quickly.

62
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'll give you 10 seconds.

63
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
10.

64
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Wait a minute.

65
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,000
If you don't pick it in time, both of you will die.

66
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
I'll do it. I'll do it.

67
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I'll do everything you tell me to do.

68
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,000
8.

69
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
How can I save you?

70
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Save me?

71
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
7.

72
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't do it!

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't do it!

74
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Don't do it!

75
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
Don't do it!

76
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you touch me, I'll kill you!

77
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
6.

78
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
I'll kill you!

79
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Don't do it!

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

81
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I must have lost my mind for a moment.

82
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Please don't do it. Please.

83
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
4.

84
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
My friends are not at fault.

85
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Didn't you say you'd do everything I told you to do?

86
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Just now.

87
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
You're so mean.

88
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,000
3.

89
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
I told you.

90
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,000
If you don't pick it in 10 seconds, both of you will die.

91
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,000
I don't know.

92
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I really don't know.

93
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I don't know.

94
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
2.

95
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
What should I do?

96
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
What should I do?

97
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Won Jun-young.

98
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
I really don't know what to do.

99
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
1.

100
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Won Jun-young.

101
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
I really don't know what to do.

102
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
I really don't know.

103
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
No, no, no.

104
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't know.

105
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,000
I don't know.

106
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I don't know.

107
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
I don't know.

108
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
3.

109
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,000
No!

110
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Won Jun-young!

111
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
4.

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:27,000
At this moment, remember it clearly.

113
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,000
No!

114
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
No!

115
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
No!

116
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,000
I told you not to pick it in 10 seconds.

117
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
5.

118
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,000
You should remember it clearly.

119
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
6.

120
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Won Jun-young, are you okay?

121
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,000
How can you be okay with a knife?

122
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Don't worry.

123
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
It's just a slight cut.

124
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
What about you, Jin-seung?

125
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,000
I'm okay.

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
You're really okay, right?

127
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
Won-young, are you going to die from this?

128
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
Let's get out of here.

129
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
7.

130
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:03,000
The punch combination was very clean, right?

131
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Catch them.

132
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
Catch the pig and the rest of them!

133
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Hurry up and catch them!

134
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Hurry up and catch them!

135
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
You guys are going to die right away!

136
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Hey!

137
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Catch them!

138
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
Go, Jin-seung!

139
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Catch them!

140
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:58,000
Hurry up and catch them!

141
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
8.

142
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,000
You bastards!

143
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,000
9.

144
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
10.

145
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,000
10.

146
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
11.

147
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,000
Are you okay?

148
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
Are you okay?

149
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,000
Let's get out of here.

150
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,000
Are you okay?

151
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
I think it's that one.

152
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
What?

153
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Hey, over there.

154
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,000
Hey, move it!

155
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,000
You guys get out of here first.

156
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,000
I'll try to get some time.

157
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
That's not possible.

158
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Please, please!

159
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
Please take him away!

160
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,000
I'll get you out of here!

161
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,000
What if he goes in?

162
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,000
I'm sorry, but did you kidnap someone?

163
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,000
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,000
Then what are we going to do sitting here?

165
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,000
I'll see you later.

166
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Let's get started.

167
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,000
10.

168
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
I forgot something in the bathroom yesterday.

169
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,000
It was the bastard I used to know.

170
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Catch them!

171
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,000
11.

172
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you going to run away from the border?

173
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
If I give you a signal, you just go up to the bright spot.

174
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,000
Just go to the crowded place, okay?

175
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:25,000
One, two, three.

176
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,000
Oh, my God.

177
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,000
That's amazing.

178
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,000
What?

179
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,000
I'm the one, right?

180
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,000
What are you guys doing?

181
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
What do you mean?

182
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,000
We're here to deliver pizza.

183
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
I'll add some cheese crust.

184
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:48,000
You bastards!

185
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,000
12.

186
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:24,000
What about Wonjun?

187
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:52,000
13.

188
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,000
You're too late.

189
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:08,000
He's worth living.

190
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,000
He's sitting with his ass on the ground.

191
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,000
Where are you?

192
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,000
Follow us!

193
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Where are you?

194
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,000
Where are you?

195
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
There he is!

196
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
You bastard!

197
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:30,000
Hurry up!

198
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,000
Hurry up!

199
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Hurry up!

200
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Get out of here!

201
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Get out of here!

202
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,000
Get out of here!

203
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Get out of here!

204
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,000
Go, Jonghyeong!

205
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,000
Get out of here!

206
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
Get out of here!

207
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,000
You bastard!

208
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,000
You bastard!

209
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,000
Get out of here!

210
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,000
Hey!

211
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,000
You bastard!

212
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,000
Jonghyeong, are you okay?

213
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Jonghyeong, go to the hospital!

214
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Jonghyeong, hold on to me!

215
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,000
Hurry up!

216
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Jonghyeong, are you okay?

217
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,000
Are you okay?

218
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,000
Go away.

219
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:44,000
You saw me there.

220
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:45,000
Jonghyeong, it's not that.

221
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I saw you there after choosing you.

222
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
It's not that.

223
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,000
I know.

224
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:53,000
The people I was bothering saw me like that.

225
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,000
They wanted me to save them.

226
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,000
They wanted me to help them.

227
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,000
So I know.

228
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
How much is your budget this week?

229
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,000
If you die before it's too late,

230
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,000
you're really going to die.

231
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
That bastard is going to die.

232
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,000
That bastard is going to die.

233
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,000
Smile.

234
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:28,000
I'll give you some candy.

235
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,000
Please tell the people.

236
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,000
I'm sorry.

237
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
How can you make me apologize?

238
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
You're the one who should apologize!

239
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
That's right.

240
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:43,000
Apologizing is selfish.

241
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,000
I'm sorry.

242
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Smile.

243
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:56,000
I'll never die as a trash.

244
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Jonghyeong.

245
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,000
Jonghyeong.

246
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,000
Jonghyeong.

247
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,000
No, no.

248
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Jonghyeong!

249
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Jonghyeong!

250
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Jonghyeong!

251
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,000
What are you doing?

252
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
What are you doing?

253
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
What are you doing?

254
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
No!

255
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
No!

256
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,000
No!

257
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
No!

258
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
No!

259
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
No!

260
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,000
No!

261
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
The End
