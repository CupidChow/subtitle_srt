1
00:00:26,303 --> 00:00:27,366
Dusik! Dusik!

2
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:28,962
Sweep. Dusik, sweep.

3
00:00:29,047 --> 00:00:29,871
Sweep.

4
00:00:29,955 --> 00:00:31,031
Donggu!

5
00:00:31,495 --> 00:00:33,033
Sweep. Sweep!

6
00:00:33,974 --> 00:00:35,903
Sweep!

7
00:00:41,331 --> 00:00:42,301
What are you doing?

8
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:44,536
Is it curling this time?

9
00:00:44,889 --> 00:00:47,527
I told you to clean.
What is this madness?

10
00:00:47,611 --> 00:00:48,954
We were cleaning.

11
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:51,112
We were just trying to have fun
while we're cleaning.

12
00:00:51,197 --> 00:00:53,550
We didn't want to play but Jungi insisted.

13
00:00:53,635 --> 00:00:55,151
- It's true.
- What?

14
00:00:56,006 --> 00:00:56,972
Jungi did?

15
00:00:58,925 --> 00:01:00,616
Still, you shouldn't tattle
on him like that.

16
00:01:00,705 --> 00:01:01,914
You're so petty.

17
00:01:01,998 --> 00:01:02,831
What?

18
00:01:03,069 --> 00:01:03,997
Petty?

19
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:05,632
Kang Seojin.

20
00:01:05,874 --> 00:01:07,634
Why are you taking Jungi's side?

21
00:01:08,473 --> 00:01:10,150
When did I take his side?

22
00:01:10,235 --> 00:01:11,466
Don't be ridiculous.

23
00:01:11,647 --> 00:01:12,506
What did you say?

24
00:01:12,761 --> 00:01:13,662
"Petty"?

25
00:01:21,065 --> 00:01:22,316
I'm going to my script reading.

26
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:30,251
Dusik, don't you think something's
going on between those two?

27
00:01:30,335 --> 00:01:31,698
Like what?

28
00:01:32,542 --> 00:01:35,597
Like Seojin and Jungi are dating?

29
00:01:38,697 --> 00:01:39,754
That's nonsense.

30
00:01:39,838 --> 00:01:40,969
Yeah, that's not possible.

31
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:42,996
Jungi's out of her league.

32
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,558
Are you crazy? I should kick your ass.

33
00:01:47,748 --> 00:01:49,972
Cleaning never ends.

34
00:01:50,278 --> 00:01:52,367
I have to write my web novel.

35
00:01:52,451 --> 00:01:54,548
Dusik! Dusik!

36
00:01:54,735 --> 00:01:56,258
Why are you making a fuss?

37
00:01:56,343 --> 00:01:59,196
I finally found something
I could be good at.

38
00:01:59,281 --> 00:02:00,114
Look at this.

39
00:02:01,728 --> 00:02:03,278
"Soorgio Armhany"?

40
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:04,251
Business plan?

41
00:02:04,336 --> 00:02:06,409
I'm going to start
an online shopping mall.

42
00:02:06,493 --> 00:02:08,241
Soorgio Armhany Mall.

43
00:02:08,326 --> 00:02:10,297
In short, 'SAM.'

44
00:02:10,906 --> 00:02:14,968
I thought about it and I want to do
something related to fashion.

45
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:18,524
So, you want to start a business?
Do you have seed money?

46
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,878
Yes, I got an investment from my brother.

47
00:02:20,962 --> 00:02:22,384
He got his fight money.

48
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:25,468
Not anyone can run a business.

49
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,493
Plus you can't do all this by yourself.

50
00:02:27,578 --> 00:02:29,744
I won't be doing it by myself.
You're doing it with me.

51
00:02:29,829 --> 00:02:32,196
What? Me? When? Where? What? Why?

52
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:36,121
Would you rather be a part-timer
or a director of a online shopping mall?

53
00:02:36,436 --> 00:02:37,396
Director?

54
00:02:37,942 --> 00:02:39,177
I'm a director?

55
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,096
How much is my salary?

56
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:42,953
3000.

57
00:02:43,037 --> 00:02:44,318
My annual salary will be 30 million won?

58
00:02:44,402 --> 00:02:46,853
No, your hourly wage will be 3000 won.

59
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,088
The minimum hourly wage is 7530 won now.
And you're offering 3000 won?

60
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,091
Okay, I'll be generous.

61
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:57,089
I'll give you 3500 won an hour. Okay?

62
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,586
Director Bong. Come with me.

63
00:02:58,671 --> 00:02:59,520
We've got lots to do.

64
00:02:59,609 --> 00:03:01,713
No, I'm not doing this.

65
00:03:01,798 --> 00:03:03,927
-I'm not doing this, you bully.
-Come here.

66
00:03:04,011 --> 00:03:04,844
No!

67
00:03:05,096 --> 00:03:07,540
I just finished the chores
and I'm going to the workroom now.

68
00:03:08,281 --> 00:03:10,072
See you later, Hyeonjun.

69
00:03:10,262 --> 00:03:11,158
Bye.

70
00:03:14,878 --> 00:03:16,771
I'm interested in Yuna.

71
00:03:17,075 --> 00:03:18,214
I like her.

72
00:03:20,091 --> 00:03:21,394
Are you going to the workroom again?

73
00:03:21,517 --> 00:03:22,954
Yes, I need to practice something.

74
00:03:23,038 --> 00:03:24,271
I see.

75
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:26,018
Did you finish cleaning?

76
00:03:26,103 --> 00:03:28,294
Just now I saw the third floor
was pretty messy.

77
00:03:28,378 --> 00:03:31,604
The third floor?
I vacuumed and mopped the floor.

78
00:03:31,689 --> 00:03:32,439
You did?

79
00:03:32,523 --> 00:03:35,595
I noticed that the second-floor
bathroom tub was very dirty.

80
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:36,972
-Did you wipe it?
-Yes.

81
00:03:37,057 --> 00:03:41,198
I cleaned the whole wall with bleach.

82
00:03:41,637 --> 00:03:42,578
You did?

83
00:03:42,793 --> 00:03:44,120
Then...

84
00:03:44,205 --> 00:03:45,703
In the pockets of the pool table...

85
00:03:45,787 --> 00:03:48,228
Oh, the dust in pockets?

86
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:49,804
I cleaned it.

87
00:03:49,893 --> 00:03:52,618
Plus, I waxed the balls and the cues.

88
00:03:53,096 --> 00:03:55,635
-Then, you may go.
-Okay, see you.

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,689
She's become meticulous.

90
00:04:04,773 --> 00:04:07,342
She's a cleaning expert now.

91
00:04:07,426 --> 00:04:10,099
I don't want her spending
so much time with him.

92
00:04:10,184 --> 00:04:12,480
This is bothering me so much.

93
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:18,592
We're almost home.

94
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:19,509
Why?

95
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:21,198
You want to stay with me longer, 'Bacca'?

96
00:04:21,282 --> 00:04:22,367
'Bacca'?

97
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:24,128
It's your nickname.

98
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:27,811
I can't call you Chewbacca
now that you're my girlfriend.

99
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:31,389
So I was contemplating
between 'Chew' and 'Bacca.'

100
00:04:31,473 --> 00:04:33,356
'Bacca' sounded cuter.

101
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:37,835
Or should I call you 'Huam Hairy'?
Short for 'Huam-dong Hairy Girl.'

102
00:04:39,623 --> 00:04:41,072
I don't like any of them.

103
00:04:41,156 --> 00:04:43,370
But you can call me anything
except for 'Huam Hairy.'

104
00:04:43,455 --> 00:04:44,693
Then, Bacca it is.

105
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:48,612
How long do we have to
keep us dating a secret?

106
00:04:48,702 --> 00:04:50,618
Can't we just tell Donggu?

107
00:04:50,702 --> 00:04:51,535
What?

108
00:04:51,777 --> 00:04:53,766
Don't you know what Donggu's like?

109
00:04:54,055 --> 00:04:57,464
If he finds out,
he'll beat me up to death.

110
00:04:58,058 --> 00:05:01,768
So, let's keep it a secret
for a while. Please?

111
00:05:02,011 --> 00:05:03,245
Okay.

112
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:04,879
But...

113
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:06,636
...are we just going in?

114
00:05:06,841 --> 00:05:08,376
How would we go in then?

115
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,286
Doing back-flips
or crawling on our hands and knees?

116
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,345
No, not that.

117
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:16,345
What?

118
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:18,980
-Oh, kiss?
-Yeah.

119
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:19,993
But...

120
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,618
-Right here?
-Yes.

121
00:05:23,232 --> 00:05:25,220
Someone might see us.

122
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,578
There's no one around.

123
00:05:29,969 --> 00:05:31,561
All right.

124
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:33,606
You naughty Bacca.

125
00:05:34,563 --> 00:05:35,396
Come here.

126
00:05:41,181 --> 00:05:43,761
What the hell are they doing
out on the streets?

127
00:05:45,933 --> 00:05:46,648
Wait.

128
00:05:46,732 --> 00:05:49,249
I've seen that face many times.

129
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:52,552
Hey! Kang Seojin!

130
00:05:55,797 --> 00:05:56,673
It is you.

131
00:05:57,476 --> 00:05:59,006
What the hell are you doing?

132
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,073
It's Donggu, isn't it?

133
00:06:01,367 --> 00:06:02,318
Oh no.

134
00:06:02,888 --> 00:06:03,948
Who are you?

135
00:06:04,053 --> 00:06:05,732
Stay right there.

136
00:06:05,978 --> 00:06:07,018
Darn it.

137
00:06:08,302 --> 00:06:09,679
Where are you going?

138
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:12,303
-No, it's not like that.
-Shut up. Move.

139
00:06:23,498 --> 00:06:24,371
What the heck?

140
00:06:29,453 --> 00:06:32,171
What the... He's a freak.

141
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:35,016
Hang on...

142
00:06:36,012 --> 00:06:39,336
I've seen that red coat before.

143
00:06:43,512 --> 00:06:44,345
What the...

144
00:06:44,777 --> 00:06:45,936
Are you...?

145
00:06:47,078 --> 00:06:47,947
Are you...?

146
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,439
No. No.

147
00:06:49,619 --> 00:06:50,452
You!

148
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,554
Kang Seojin.

149
00:06:55,890 --> 00:06:57,267
Tell me the truth.

150
00:06:57,525 --> 00:07:00,153
That guy in the park was Jungi, right?

151
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:01,887
No, it wasn't.

152
00:07:01,972 --> 00:07:06,173
What do you mean "no"?
He had the same coat as Jungi.

153
00:07:06,613 --> 00:07:10,908
I thought it was weird that you shaved
regularly even when you're at home.

154
00:07:10,992 --> 00:07:12,502
It really wasn't Jungi.

155
00:07:12,587 --> 00:07:13,926
Then who the hell was he?

156
00:07:14,336 --> 00:07:15,700
Who was he?

157
00:07:15,784 --> 00:07:16,823
Well...

158
00:07:18,103 --> 00:07:19,389
I have a boyfriend.

159
00:07:19,474 --> 00:07:21,335
What? A boyfriend?

160
00:07:21,802 --> 00:07:23,322
But why did he run away when he saw me?

161
00:07:24,345 --> 00:07:27,856
That's because you were screaming at us.
He got scared.

162
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:29,105
No.

163
00:07:29,410 --> 00:07:31,196
There's something suspicious here.

164
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:34,175
I can smell something very fishy going on.

165
00:07:36,965 --> 00:07:38,164
Hello, Director.

166
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,082
Yes.

167
00:07:39,347 --> 00:07:41,594
Yes, I just got home.

168
00:07:41,764 --> 00:07:44,875
Okay, see you tomorrow. Bye.

169
00:07:47,214 --> 00:07:48,047
What?

170
00:07:48,183 --> 00:07:49,114
Why are you looking at me like that?

171
00:07:49,198 --> 00:07:50,309
Tell me the truth.

172
00:07:50,408 --> 00:07:54,055
You're the guy who was kissing
Seojin in the park, right?

173
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,449
What are you talking about?

174
00:07:55,542 --> 00:07:58,491
I just got back from practice all day.

175
00:07:58,576 --> 00:07:59,409
Wait.

176
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:01,744
Did you say Seojin kissed someone?

177
00:08:01,829 --> 00:08:02,750
With whom?

178
00:08:03,064 --> 00:08:04,171
-Drop the act.
-Huh?

179
00:08:04,256 --> 00:08:07,409
That guy was wearing a red coat
just like yours.

180
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,064
You fool.

181
00:08:09,262 --> 00:08:11,769
Then every guy in a red coat
is Seojin's boyfriend?

182
00:08:11,982 --> 00:08:14,891
Besides, why would I date
a bad-tempered girl like her?

183
00:08:14,975 --> 00:08:17,133
And she grows more facial hair than me.

184
00:08:18,076 --> 00:08:19,973
Oh, that's how you're going to play this?

185
00:08:20,057 --> 00:08:21,305
Fine.

186
00:08:22,428 --> 00:08:23,505
Bring him over.

187
00:08:23,839 --> 00:08:26,406
Bring your boyfriend here and show me.

188
00:08:26,491 --> 00:08:29,198
-What?
-You can't do it, right?

189
00:08:29,283 --> 00:08:32,141
Because your boyfriend is Jungi!

190
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:33,362
Goodness.

191
00:08:33,454 --> 00:08:35,607
-Seojin, bring him!
-What?

192
00:08:35,692 --> 00:08:40,132
Bring him here and show Donggu
that we're not dating.

193
00:08:40,216 --> 00:08:41,206
Call him.

194
00:08:43,577 --> 00:08:45,255
Oh, okay.

195
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:48,044
Fine, I'll bring him.

196
00:08:48,247 --> 00:08:49,496
Yeah? Fine.

197
00:08:50,013 --> 00:08:50,802
Great.

198
00:08:50,886 --> 00:08:52,915
Let's wait and see.

199
00:08:57,359 --> 00:08:58,192
Jungi.

200
00:08:58,916 --> 00:08:59,749
Jungi?

201
00:09:04,177 --> 00:09:05,321
Are you okay?

202
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:09,849
Blood... You're bleeding!

203
00:09:19,224 --> 00:09:21,120
I'm okay. It's fine.

204
00:09:25,344 --> 00:09:26,960
I guess my organs were damaged...

205
00:09:27,683 --> 00:09:29,836
...when I got hit by the car earlier.

206
00:09:30,365 --> 00:09:33,433
What's important is
that Donggu didn't catch us.

207
00:09:33,518 --> 00:09:35,387
Do we have to keep doing this?

208
00:09:35,511 --> 00:09:37,227
Can't we just tell him that we're dating?

209
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:39,978
You never know.
He might give us his blessing.

210
00:09:40,063 --> 00:09:40,896
Hey.

211
00:09:41,132 --> 00:09:43,497
If I had a little sister,
I wouldn't let her date a guy like me.

212
00:09:43,768 --> 00:09:45,576
Donggu will never approve of us.

213
00:09:45,838 --> 00:09:47,233
Stop dreaming.

214
00:09:47,318 --> 00:09:48,368
Geez.

215
00:09:48,687 --> 00:09:50,861
But what about the fake boyfriend?

216
00:09:50,946 --> 00:09:52,770
-What are we going to do?
-Don't worry.

217
00:09:52,884 --> 00:09:56,332
I'll ask an actor friend
who can act really well.

218
00:09:56,557 --> 00:09:57,787
This will actually work for us.

219
00:09:57,871 --> 00:10:00,989
If we show him the fake boyfriend,
he will stop being suspicious of us.

220
00:10:01,073 --> 00:10:02,826
Then we can date without worries.

221
00:10:02,921 --> 00:10:03,754
Right?

222
00:10:04,764 --> 00:10:06,250
Yeah, that's true...

223
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:09,709
Don't worry.

224
00:10:09,848 --> 00:10:12,443
Just trust me, Bacca.

225
00:10:13,258 --> 00:10:14,834
-Okay?
-Yeah.

226
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,684
What are you two doing?

227
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,421
Gee, you're so ugly.

228
00:10:24,506 --> 00:10:27,426
How can you be so ugly?

229
00:10:28,105 --> 00:10:30,149
A mustache on this face?

230
00:10:30,234 --> 00:10:32,381
Who would ever want to date you?

231
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:38,656
I'm wide awake after seeing your face.

232
00:10:43,846 --> 00:10:44,935
Wait.

233
00:10:48,134 --> 00:10:49,596
What? What?

234
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:55,173
I'm warning you just in case.

235
00:10:56,306 --> 00:10:59,292
If there's something going on
between you two...

236
00:11:01,135 --> 00:11:07,306
...I'll send you to your grave
on the same day.

237
00:11:09,074 --> 00:11:10,193
Got it?

238
00:11:14,684 --> 00:11:15,530
Don't worry.

239
00:11:15,783 --> 00:11:16,947
That will never happen.

240
00:11:24,752 --> 00:11:25,785
Got it?

241
00:11:32,991 --> 00:11:35,994
It's still suspicious
no matter how I think about it.

242
00:11:36,264 --> 00:11:38,444
Two of them kissing the other day...

243
00:11:38,893 --> 00:11:39,726
Well...

244
00:11:39,924 --> 00:11:41,582
...I'll find out today.

245
00:11:42,944 --> 00:11:47,738
If Seojin is dating Jungi, I'll just...!

246
00:11:53,264 --> 00:11:55,381
Donggu, I'm going to the workroom.

247
00:11:55,466 --> 00:11:56,299
Again?

248
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,294
You're leaving the house too often
when there are chores to do.

249
00:11:59,378 --> 00:12:00,524
I finished my chores.

250
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:03,297
Dirty clothes were piled up.
Did you wash them?

251
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:05,490
I washed them and hung them on the rack.

252
00:12:05,579 --> 00:12:08,147
There was a smudge on the top left corner
of the pillowcase in the room upstairs.

253
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:10,560
I removed all the pillowcases
and washed them.

254
00:12:10,645 --> 00:12:12,461
I disinfected them and put them back on.

255
00:12:12,545 --> 00:12:14,999
-Third floor window...
-The curtains?

256
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:17,166
I washed them and hung them to dry.

257
00:12:18,078 --> 00:12:18,921
You did?

258
00:12:19,006 --> 00:12:23,384
-By the third railing on the rooftop...
-The Waikiki flag?

259
00:12:23,539 --> 00:12:26,532
I washed it, ironed it,
and hung it back up.

260
00:12:27,437 --> 00:12:30,050
-Then you may go.
-See you.

261
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,354
She's become meticulous.

262
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,408
She's efficient too.

263
00:12:36,493 --> 00:12:38,086
When did she do all those things?

264
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:40,443
It's bothering me so much.

265
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,379
Song Hyeonjun...!

266
00:12:48,792 --> 00:12:49,842
Would you look at this?

267
00:12:58,021 --> 00:12:58,944
Director Bong!

268
00:13:00,513 --> 00:13:01,776
You shocked me.

269
00:13:01,865 --> 00:13:03,298
Why did you do that?

270
00:13:04,151 --> 00:13:07,782
I spent all night buying clothes.

271
00:13:07,872 --> 00:13:09,455
-You dare sleep during work hours?!
-Hey.

272
00:13:09,998 --> 00:13:12,344
I worked on the website all night.

273
00:13:12,428 --> 00:13:13,398
Whatever.

274
00:13:13,505 --> 00:13:14,745
Did we get any orders?

275
00:13:15,439 --> 00:13:17,919
We're the only people
who know this website address.

276
00:13:18,004 --> 00:13:20,600
So, who would visit and order?

277
00:13:20,977 --> 00:13:22,702
What do we do?

278
00:13:23,023 --> 00:13:24,889
How can we promote our website?

279
00:13:24,973 --> 00:13:27,647
Promoting it on the media is the best way.

280
00:13:27,832 --> 00:13:29,676
But it won't be easy.

281
00:13:30,171 --> 00:13:31,679
Oh, the media.

282
00:13:32,243 --> 00:13:33,806
Media...

283
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:39,196
We're back on Seo Yuri's
"Let's Meet at Noon."

284
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:43,063
It's time for your favorite event,
the singing contest.

285
00:13:43,147 --> 00:13:46,354
Let's speak to the first participant.

286
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,521
Hello?

287
00:13:50,397 --> 00:13:51,121
Hello.

288
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:53,601
Nice to meet you.
Can you introduce yourself?

289
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:56,196
Hello, my name is Bong Dusik...

290
00:13:56,312 --> 00:14:00,369
...director of the online shopping mall,
Soorgio Armhany.

291
00:14:00,454 --> 00:14:02,252
Okay, Director Bong.

292
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:05,996
But you can't say the name
of your business on air.

293
00:14:06,081 --> 00:14:07,903
Really? Sorry.

294
00:14:07,991 --> 00:14:11,454
You didn't know, so we'll let it slide.

295
00:14:11,539 --> 00:14:14,628
Director Bong,
what song will you sing for us?

296
00:14:14,713 --> 00:14:18,199
I'm going to sing
Yim Jaebeom's "Confession."

297
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:20,324
That's a difficult song.

298
00:14:20,408 --> 00:14:22,363
Let's hear your singing.

299
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,828
♪ Quietly, "Soor"

300
00:14:58,265 --> 00:15:02,474
♪ Pretending to have "Soor"

301
00:15:03,838 --> 00:15:07,012
♪ Soorgio Armhany

302
00:15:07,097 --> 00:15:10,582
♪ Shopping Mall

303
00:15:11,283 --> 00:15:12,307
♪ Soor...

304
00:15:13,429 --> 00:15:16,114
The call got disconnected.

305
00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:29,708
It's good.

306
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:30,729
Really?

307
00:15:30,814 --> 00:15:32,408
Yes. It's really good.

308
00:15:33,633 --> 00:15:34,790
What a relief.

309
00:15:35,158 --> 00:15:38,487
I'm actually most confident
making muffins.

310
00:15:38,571 --> 00:15:42,809
I already have a muffin named after Seol
that I want to sell in my bakery.

311
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,852
Yeah? What's the name?

312
00:15:45,739 --> 00:15:49,264
"Do Re Mi Fa Sol" muffins.

313
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:53,492
That's an interesting name.

314
00:15:55,798 --> 00:15:57,901
-This is the recipe?
-Yes.

315
00:15:57,986 --> 00:16:00,208
I made this recipe.

316
00:16:05,962 --> 00:16:09,274
So, this is your boyfriend?

317
00:16:09,394 --> 00:16:11,377
-Yes. I told you so.
-You, be quiet.

318
00:16:12,118 --> 00:16:14,126
Are you really her boyfriend?

319
00:16:18,847 --> 00:16:21,778
Yes, I love wearing this red coat.

320
00:16:21,863 --> 00:16:25,251
And I was kissing Seojin in the park
when you...

321
00:16:26,681 --> 00:16:31,983
When you shouted at us,
I got startled and ran away.

322
00:16:32,068 --> 00:16:35,320
I'm Seojin's boyfriend Kang Hongseok.

323
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:40,041
He's a musical actor.

324
00:16:40,403 --> 00:16:41,875
So he uses big gestures.

325
00:16:42,327 --> 00:16:44,036
He's very expressive.

326
00:16:44,794 --> 00:16:45,922
I can see that.

327
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:48,374
How did you guys meet?

328
00:16:59,057 --> 00:17:00,012
What happened to the lights?

329
00:17:01,574 --> 00:17:05,024
We first met in a theater.

330
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:08,933
Seojin entered the theater
to write a story.

331
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:10,423
Click-clack.

332
00:17:11,601 --> 00:17:12,434
Click-clack.

333
00:17:13,164 --> 00:17:14,817
Click-clack, as she entered...

334
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:16,902
...suddenly my heart went thump...!

335
00:17:17,550 --> 00:17:18,383
Thump...!

336
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:19,829
Thump...!

337
00:17:20,167 --> 00:17:21,474
My heart started beating fast.

338
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,912
And I heard a song telling us
that we're meant to be.

339
00:17:32,185 --> 00:17:33,018
By the way...

340
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,390
Where's the bathroom?

341
00:17:36,905 --> 00:17:38,503
The bathroom?

342
00:17:38,587 --> 00:17:40,703
It's over there.

343
00:17:42,426 --> 00:17:43,385
That way.

344
00:17:44,023 --> 00:17:45,908
Then, excuse me for a moment.

345
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:47,002
Tap...

346
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,787
Tap... Tap...

347
00:17:48,969 --> 00:17:49,802
Tap...

348
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:51,504
Tap...

349
00:17:51,637 --> 00:17:52,677
See?

350
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:54,740
I told you Seojin and I aren't dating.

351
00:17:55,777 --> 00:17:57,881
He's weird, but...

352
00:17:59,138 --> 00:18:02,300
It's much better than Seojin dating you.

353
00:18:02,709 --> 00:18:04,116
What did you say?

354
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:06,035
What's wrong with me?

355
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:08,356
You should be thankful
you're not dating her.

356
00:18:08,441 --> 00:18:12,677
If Seojin was dating you...!

357
00:18:13,571 --> 00:18:18,114
...I'll send you to your grave
on the same day.

358
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:19,733
I got it.

359
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,122
Stop saying that. It's super scary.

360
00:18:21,206 --> 00:18:23,159
You sound like the Grim Reaper.

361
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:28,860
Do I have to do this?

362
00:18:28,944 --> 00:18:30,281
Really?

363
00:18:30,365 --> 00:18:33,630
Yeah, we have to promote
our online shopping mall.

364
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:38,213
Hey, why are you being so loud?

365
00:18:38,341 --> 00:18:39,174
Donggu.

366
00:18:39,423 --> 00:18:40,832
What the...?

367
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,060
What are you doing?

368
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:45,618
We're doing a live show
to promote our online shopping mall.

369
00:18:45,703 --> 00:18:47,504
Oh, I see.

370
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,755
What's that on your face?

371
00:18:51,131 --> 00:18:52,376
This?

372
00:18:52,461 --> 00:18:55,727
Last time, the video of Seojin
shaving got lots of views.

373
00:18:55,812 --> 00:18:59,175
So, I'm going to shave live.
So I put on fake mustache.

374
00:18:59,259 --> 00:19:02,028
Oh, I see.

375
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:04,560
What are these bones?

376
00:19:04,644 --> 00:19:05,838
Are those dinosaur bones?

377
00:19:05,923 --> 00:19:09,878
She's making me eat bones like Jungi did.

378
00:19:09,963 --> 00:19:13,677
This super strong cow leg bone at that.

379
00:19:14,712 --> 00:19:18,777
Jungi did pigs' feet, so we need
something bigger to attract people.

380
00:19:19,784 --> 00:19:20,859
Come on.

381
00:19:22,523 --> 00:19:23,598
Someone came in.

382
00:19:24,763 --> 00:19:25,921
Let's do this, Dusik.

383
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,771
Hello, 'Gangnam Parvenu'.

384
00:19:29,986 --> 00:19:33,446
I'm the new beautiful hairy BJ...

385
00:19:33,531 --> 00:19:36,165
...BJ Soorgio.

386
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:41,814
Hello, I'm the cute bone-eating BJ,
BJ Armhany.

387
00:19:42,446 --> 00:19:44,433
We'll begin our bone eating show...

388
00:19:45,383 --> 00:19:48,682
...and face shaving show.

389
00:19:48,766 --> 00:19:51,698
I'll apply shaving cream first.

390
00:19:55,653 --> 00:19:58,482
Go on, eat the bone.

391
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,453
Dusik...

392
00:20:05,283 --> 00:20:07,219
How's the practice going
for your first shoot?

393
00:20:07,719 --> 00:20:08,774
I don't know.

394
00:20:09,128 --> 00:20:10,726
I'm doing my best.

395
00:20:10,881 --> 00:20:13,977
But I'm feeling worried and nervous.

396
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,034
Cheer up.

397
00:20:15,211 --> 00:20:16,539
I know that you can do it.

398
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:17,713
I knew it.

399
00:20:17,798 --> 00:20:20,571
Bacca, you're the only one
who worries about me.

400
00:20:20,655 --> 00:20:22,198
You're grateful, right?

401
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:24,356
-Then, you should give me a reward.
-A reward?

402
00:20:25,259 --> 00:20:26,150
What kind of reward?

403
00:20:26,324 --> 00:20:27,593
You know.

404
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:30,950
What?

405
00:20:32,210 --> 00:20:33,043
Again?

406
00:20:33,545 --> 00:20:35,537
What if Donggu sees us again?

407
00:20:35,621 --> 00:20:36,830
No way.

408
00:20:36,915 --> 00:20:38,816
We should be careful.

409
00:20:38,961 --> 00:20:40,579
Didn't you hear what he said yesterday?

410
00:20:41,215 --> 00:20:45,294
I'll send you to your grave.

411
00:20:47,031 --> 00:20:51,289
I still get chills down my spine
when I think about that.

412
00:20:51,374 --> 00:20:52,692
Still...

413
00:20:56,364 --> 00:20:57,271
Gee!

414
00:20:57,478 --> 00:21:01,371
Bacca, you're so sexy and naughty!

415
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:03,778
Put your lips right here.

416
00:21:05,032 --> 00:21:06,521
Get ready.

417
00:21:06,751 --> 00:21:08,667
Here comes my move.

418
00:21:13,304 --> 00:21:14,204
What the hell?

419
00:21:16,937 --> 00:21:18,027
Kang Seojin!

420
00:21:18,936 --> 00:21:21,288
That's Donggu, right?

421
00:21:21,372 --> 00:21:22,303
On no!

422
00:21:22,611 --> 00:21:23,604
Kang Seojin!

423
00:21:23,689 --> 00:21:25,851
Who is it?! Who are you!

424
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:28,499
What the...?

425
00:21:29,472 --> 00:21:30,489
Why is he so fast?

426
00:21:31,575 --> 00:21:32,408
By the way...

427
00:21:33,051 --> 00:21:35,137
...Kang Seojin.

428
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:37,458
-You...!
-No!

429
00:21:37,542 --> 00:21:38,969
Shut up.

430
00:21:40,411 --> 00:21:41,938
Come here.

431
00:21:43,917 --> 00:21:45,362
Kang Seojin.

432
00:21:45,486 --> 00:21:47,791
Hongseok is at the theater.

433
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:49,195
Who was that?

434
00:21:50,479 --> 00:21:51,312
Wait.

435
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:55,620
His back looked a lot like Jungi.

436
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:57,464
What are you talking about?

437
00:21:57,552 --> 00:21:58,646
It wasn't Jungi.

438
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:00,124
Then who was it?

439
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:02,955
Who the hell was kissing you?!

440
00:22:03,174 --> 00:22:04,093
Well...

441
00:22:05,513 --> 00:22:06,708
My boyfriend.

442
00:22:06,793 --> 00:22:08,759
What? Your boyfriend?

443
00:22:08,861 --> 00:22:10,090
What about Hongseok?

444
00:22:10,483 --> 00:22:13,073
Are you two-timing?

445
00:22:14,856 --> 00:22:15,689
Yeah.

446
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,491
I met him when I was doing an interview.

447
00:22:18,576 --> 00:22:19,918
I really liked him, so...

448
00:22:20,002 --> 00:22:22,398
You kissed a guy you met today?

449
00:22:22,482 --> 00:22:24,463
I'm feeling passionate these days.

450
00:22:24,548 --> 00:22:25,964
I'm sexually frustrated.

451
00:22:26,053 --> 00:22:28,431
You expect me to believe that?

452
00:22:30,297 --> 00:22:31,496
Hello, Director.

453
00:22:32,317 --> 00:22:33,867
Thank you for driving me home.

454
00:22:33,952 --> 00:22:35,921
Get home safely. Bye.

455
00:22:37,715 --> 00:22:38,642
Look at this.

456
00:22:38,727 --> 00:22:41,198
This is the back of the head
that I saw in the park.

457
00:22:41,282 --> 00:22:44,110
-What are you talking about?
-Stop pretending.

458
00:22:44,661 --> 00:22:47,847
You're the guy who was kissing
Seojin in the park, right?

459
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:49,225
What are you talking about?

460
00:22:49,385 --> 00:22:52,296
I was practicing lines with the director.

461
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:55,618
Wait. Seojin kissed again?

462
00:22:56,512 --> 00:22:59,873
You're a kiss maniac, aren't you?

463
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,216
So that guy in the park wasn't you?

464
00:23:03,301 --> 00:23:04,516
Fine.

465
00:23:04,895 --> 00:23:06,828
Then, call your boyfriend.

466
00:23:06,913 --> 00:23:08,619
-Call him.
-Tell him to come over right now.

467
00:23:08,704 --> 00:23:09,537
What?

468
00:23:10,419 --> 00:23:13,608
- Right now?
- Why are you surprised?

469
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:14,817
I'm not!

470
00:23:14,992 --> 00:23:17,159
Seojin, tell him to come over.

471
00:23:17,663 --> 00:23:18,837
Call him.

472
00:23:18,922 --> 00:23:20,308
You can tell him to come over.

473
00:23:20,392 --> 00:23:22,261
Trust me and tell him to come over.

474
00:23:22,351 --> 00:23:26,352
And show Donggu that nothing's
going on between us.

475
00:23:26,627 --> 00:23:28,941
Go on, tell him to come over.

476
00:23:29,025 --> 00:23:30,542
Call him!

477
00:23:30,724 --> 00:23:33,060
Why aren't you calling?!
I have to see him today!

478
00:23:33,145 --> 00:23:34,004
Call him over.

479
00:23:34,098 --> 00:23:35,166
This instant.

480
00:23:35,617 --> 00:23:36,916
Okay.

481
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:45,206
Why are you dressed like that?

482
00:23:45,624 --> 00:23:50,185
I was shooting a historical TV drama
and I received an urgent casting call.

483
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:51,823
A casting call?

484
00:23:52,997 --> 00:23:54,223
No, what I meant was...

485
00:23:55,008 --> 00:23:58,875
I received an urgent phone call
from my girlfriend Bang Seojin.

486
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,572
"Bang" Seojin?

487
00:24:03,259 --> 00:24:04,703
-Is it wrong?
-What?

488
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:06,302
The truth is...

489
00:24:06,387 --> 00:24:09,377
We had just met this morning.

490
00:24:09,462 --> 00:24:11,699
So, I haven't memorized her name.

491
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,795
Yeah, that happens.

492
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,403
Once, I didn't know the girl's name
for three months.

493
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,082
-Yeah?
-Anyway...

494
00:24:18,237 --> 00:24:21,357
I am Seojin's boyfriend.

495
00:24:21,442 --> 00:24:22,628
Excuse me...

496
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:25,513
You've seen me, so can I go now?

497
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:28,175
I have to drink poison
in about 30 minutes.

498
00:24:28,259 --> 00:24:31,203
Oh, okay. You can go.

499
00:24:31,288 --> 00:24:32,134
Bye.

500
00:24:36,734 --> 00:24:39,485
See? I told you it wasn't me.

501
00:24:41,119 --> 00:24:44,900
Yeah, he's weird too, but...

502
00:24:45,365 --> 00:24:47,960
It's much better than Seojin dating you.

503
00:24:48,926 --> 00:24:52,136
Two boyfriends
and kissing on the first day?

504
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,709
Seojin, you're too promiscuous.

505
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:55,982
Sorry.

506
00:24:56,232 --> 00:24:59,565
I had no idea I was so promiscuous.

507
00:25:02,390 --> 00:25:03,836
You're worrying me.

508
00:25:08,429 --> 00:25:10,516
We had zero visitors.

509
00:25:11,436 --> 00:25:13,822
But we bought so many clothes already.

510
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,691
Ow, my tooth.

511
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:18,780
Darn it, Min Sua, that witch.

512
00:25:22,029 --> 00:25:23,243
Director Bong, follow me.

513
00:25:23,328 --> 00:25:24,293
Where are we going?

514
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:26,768
We can't just sit there
and wait for customers.

515
00:25:26,852 --> 00:25:28,259
We have to try everything.

516
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:29,209
Let's go.

517
00:25:29,370 --> 00:25:31,944
-Where are we going?
-Just follow me.

518
00:25:32,028 --> 00:25:34,821
-What are we doing this time?
-Come on.

519
00:25:34,909 --> 00:25:36,051
Hello. It's Soorgio Armhany...

520
00:25:36,135 --> 00:25:39,527
Hello. It's an online shopping mall
Soorgio Armhany.

521
00:25:39,672 --> 00:25:41,902
Hello. It's an online shopping mall
Soorgio Armhany.

522
00:25:41,986 --> 00:25:43,290
Look it up on the Internet.

523
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:45,030
Look it up on the Internet.

524
00:25:50,838 --> 00:25:51,671
Sua.

525
00:25:52,021 --> 00:25:53,155
Let's go home.

526
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,902
This is not working.

527
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,172
No one uses fliers anymore.

528
00:25:58,256 --> 00:26:00,257
But there's no other way.

529
00:26:00,381 --> 00:26:02,019
I have to try something.

530
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,445
You can go if you want to.

531
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,891
I'm going to distribute all of these.

532
00:26:04,975 --> 00:26:06,084
Hey.

533
00:26:06,168 --> 00:26:08,184
Hello. It's an online shopping mall
Soorgio Armhany.

534
00:26:08,268 --> 00:26:09,512
Thank you.

535
00:26:30,220 --> 00:26:32,421
That's enough.

536
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:34,210
Let's go home.

537
00:26:37,299 --> 00:26:38,148
Min Sua.

538
00:26:39,008 --> 00:26:39,985
Are you crying?

539
00:26:40,267 --> 00:26:41,133
Dusik.

540
00:26:42,139 --> 00:26:43,910
What's wrong with me?

541
00:26:46,004 --> 00:26:48,234
Why am I bad at everything?

542
00:26:51,312 --> 00:26:53,244
I really tried my best this time.

543
00:26:55,793 --> 00:26:57,681
I really wanted to make this work.

544
00:27:03,325 --> 00:27:04,158
Stand up.

545
00:27:04,553 --> 00:27:07,974
No, I'm going to hand out more fliers.
You can go home.

546
00:27:08,058 --> 00:27:10,977
Stand up. I'm hungry.

547
00:27:11,790 --> 00:27:14,417
How can you say that in this situation?

548
00:27:14,501 --> 00:27:17,387
We need to eat first if we want
to hand out all the fliers.

549
00:27:17,593 --> 00:27:18,913
-What?
-Plus...

550
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:21,908
I can't go home
when the CEO is still working.

551
00:27:23,070 --> 00:27:24,159
Stand up.

552
00:27:40,689 --> 00:27:41,944
Here. Drink.

553
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:43,821
No, thanks. I'm not hungry.

554
00:27:43,906 --> 00:27:45,550
Have some.

555
00:27:45,634 --> 00:27:46,565
Go on.

556
00:27:57,697 --> 00:27:58,530
Don't move!

557
00:27:58,824 --> 00:27:59,745
Don't move!

558
00:28:00,922 --> 00:28:02,256
Everyone get on the floor.

559
00:28:02,365 --> 00:28:04,736
Get on the floor if you don't want to die.

560
00:28:04,828 --> 00:28:06,787
Is that a gun?

561
00:28:08,562 --> 00:28:10,515
That's a g-gun.

562
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:11,899
What the hell is happening?

563
00:28:11,984 --> 00:28:12,883
You two.

564
00:28:13,236 --> 00:28:13,919
On the floor.

565
00:28:14,003 --> 00:28:15,861
-Get on the floor now!
-Okay.

566
00:28:18,784 --> 00:28:19,965
Hyeonjun.

567
00:28:20,827 --> 00:28:21,660
Hi.

568
00:28:21,793 --> 00:28:22,626
Hi.

569
00:28:22,735 --> 00:28:24,598
Why did you call me?

570
00:28:24,784 --> 00:28:27,321
I have something to show you.

571
00:28:27,406 --> 00:28:29,374
"New item Do Re Mi Fa Sol muffins"

572
00:28:31,271 --> 00:28:32,877
What's this?

573
00:28:32,961 --> 00:28:34,984
I'm a businessman believe it or not.

574
00:28:35,069 --> 00:28:37,902
I thought your muffins
would sell quite well.

575
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:40,052
So, I made them and displayed them.
What do you think?

576
00:28:40,201 --> 00:28:41,121
Really?

577
00:28:41,205 --> 00:28:43,113
I followed your recipe.

578
00:28:43,197 --> 00:28:46,352
We'll make and sell these muffins
in this bakery.

579
00:28:46,437 --> 00:28:48,850
And we'll split the profit in half.

580
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,088
Any objections?

581
00:28:50,911 --> 00:28:52,589
No, no objections.

582
00:28:53,101 --> 00:28:54,401
Thank you so much.

583
00:28:55,111 --> 00:28:56,516
Thank you, Hyeonjun.

584
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:59,461
I look forward to working with you,
Pastry Chef Han Yuna.

585
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:09,128
Park Ducheol, it's not too late.

586
00:29:09,286 --> 00:29:11,583
Put down your weapon and surrender!

587
00:29:11,797 --> 00:29:13,280
Don't try anything funny!

588
00:29:13,365 --> 00:29:15,956
Back off if you want to save the hostages!

589
00:29:16,040 --> 00:29:18,808
How long do we have to stay here?

590
00:29:20,958 --> 00:29:21,791
Huh?

591
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,163
-Even the media is here.
-Oh, yeah.

592
00:29:26,050 --> 00:29:27,662
There are a lot of cameras.

593
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:29,666
Wait.

594
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:34,151
Dusik, don't they usually broadcast
this kind of stuff live?

595
00:29:34,318 --> 00:29:35,921
Yeah. Why do you ask?

596
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:38,063
It's our chance to promote our website.

597
00:29:38,148 --> 00:29:40,021
It's being broadcast live
to the whole country.

598
00:29:40,105 --> 00:29:42,477
You want to promote our website
in this situation?

599
00:29:42,562 --> 00:29:43,585
Are you crazy?

600
00:29:44,716 --> 00:29:45,762
Stay here.

601
00:29:46,013 --> 00:29:46,866
I'll take care of this.

602
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,178
Don't do it.

603
00:29:48,430 --> 00:29:51,008
You'll get shot. Don't do it.

604
00:29:51,479 --> 00:29:52,583
Stop it.

605
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:54,151
Don't do it.

606
00:29:54,346 --> 00:29:55,275
Don't do it.

607
00:29:56,345 --> 00:29:58,816
-What's going on there?
-What is she doing?

608
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,570
"Soorgio Armhany"

609
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,815
Hey, what are you doing?

610
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:10,872
Actually, sir...

611
00:30:10,956 --> 00:30:13,293
Can't I just stand here?

612
00:30:13,407 --> 00:30:15,037
I'm already a hostage.

613
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:17,521
So it doesn't matter whether
I'm on the floor or standing up, right?

614
00:30:17,605 --> 00:30:18,419
She's insane.

615
00:30:18,503 --> 00:30:20,549
What? Have you lost it?

616
00:30:20,633 --> 00:30:21,496
Get down on the floor.

617
00:30:22,190 --> 00:30:23,183
Now.

618
00:30:23,267 --> 00:30:25,200
I have to do this.

619
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,362
I already lost the will to live.

620
00:30:27,456 --> 00:30:29,097
So I can really kill you.

621
00:30:36,326 --> 00:30:38,460
You're not the only one with a tough life.

622
00:30:38,999 --> 00:30:39,832
What?

623
00:30:40,627 --> 00:30:42,944
I don't know what's your story...

624
00:30:43,127 --> 00:30:45,039
...but my life is pretty messed up too.

625
00:30:45,403 --> 00:30:49,648
I got scammed by a man
and lost all my money.

626
00:30:49,771 --> 00:30:50,940
As if that's not enough...

627
00:30:51,192 --> 00:30:54,727
...I'm living in my ex-boyfriend's house,
whom I dumped for being unsuccessful.

628
00:30:55,096 --> 00:30:55,929
Really?

629
00:30:56,283 --> 00:30:57,229
On top of that...

630
00:30:57,418 --> 00:31:00,192
...he likes someone else now.

631
00:31:01,146 --> 00:31:03,341
He even asks me for dating advice.

632
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,383
It hurts my pride.

633
00:31:06,564 --> 00:31:07,899
He's a jerk.

634
00:31:08,648 --> 00:31:13,904
The online shopping mall was my last hope,
but it's about to go under.

635
00:31:14,593 --> 00:31:15,674
So, please...

636
00:31:16,292 --> 00:31:18,298
...let me stand here.

637
00:31:18,628 --> 00:31:19,461
Please.

638
00:31:19,798 --> 00:31:21,246
Please.

639
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,973
No. No...

640
00:31:25,182 --> 00:31:26,138
Don't... Don't cry.

641
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:28,748
Everyone's watching you.

642
00:31:29,064 --> 00:31:29,897
Stop crying.

643
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,277
They're both crazy.

644
00:31:49,747 --> 00:31:51,675
Glad I learned that from Subong.

645
00:31:53,408 --> 00:31:54,929
Bacca, what's wrong?

646
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,173
What's the matter?

647
00:31:56,258 --> 00:31:57,383
You really don't know?

648
00:31:57,467 --> 00:31:59,080
You made me look like a tramp.

649
00:31:59,164 --> 00:32:01,634
I have no choice.

650
00:32:01,718 --> 00:32:03,301
How long are we going to keep doing this?

651
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:04,583
Forever?

652
00:32:04,667 --> 00:32:06,077
Don't you know what Donggu's like?

653
00:32:06,309 --> 00:32:08,822
If he finds out,
he'll beat me up to death.

654
00:32:08,906 --> 00:32:11,802
How can a man be so gutless?
Are you that scared of my brother?

655
00:32:11,887 --> 00:32:14,276
Yes, I'm terrified.

656
00:32:14,539 --> 00:32:16,735
I don't want to be in a grave.

657
00:32:16,819 --> 00:32:18,524
Whatever. Let's stop.

658
00:32:18,609 --> 00:32:20,372
Let's just break up.

659
00:32:20,862 --> 00:32:23,108
Wait. What are you talking about?

660
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,300
Don't say that.

661
00:32:26,766 --> 00:32:28,204
Seojin!

662
00:32:28,288 --> 00:32:29,754
No! Let me go!

663
00:32:29,838 --> 00:32:32,524
-No, I won't let go.
-Let go of me.

664
00:32:33,176 --> 00:32:35,056
Kang Seojin!

665
00:32:36,626 --> 00:32:38,508
It's Donggu again, isn't it?

666
00:32:40,003 --> 00:32:40,753
Not again.

667
00:32:40,837 --> 00:32:42,432
Let's just tell him the truth.

668
00:32:42,516 --> 00:32:45,213
-No! He'll kill me.
-Come on!

669
00:32:46,495 --> 00:32:48,362
You! Don't move.

670
00:32:48,446 --> 00:32:50,144
Seojin, I'm sorry.

671
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,603
Come here.

672
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,596
Is that a man or a cheetah?

673
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:02,676
Kang Seojin.

674
00:33:02,811 --> 00:33:04,000
Who was that?

675
00:33:04,339 --> 00:33:05,687
I don't know either!

676
00:33:07,179 --> 00:33:08,023
What?

677
00:33:08,107 --> 00:33:10,514
Why are you yelling at me? Hey!

678
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,641
Kang Seojin!

679
00:33:12,333 --> 00:33:15,274
A citizen brought down a robber
with her bare hands.

680
00:33:15,359 --> 00:33:17,609
Let's speak to her now.

681
00:33:18,516 --> 00:33:19,496
Hello.

682
00:33:20,550 --> 00:33:23,228
Hello, my name is Min Sua.

683
00:33:23,312 --> 00:33:27,940
I'm the CEO of an online shopping mall
called Soorgio Armhany.

684
00:33:28,025 --> 00:33:31,398
I bet it wasn't easy taking down
a man with a gun.

685
00:33:31,482 --> 00:33:32,633
No, it wasn't.

686
00:33:32,717 --> 00:33:36,224
But the founding philosophy
of Soorgio Armhany...

687
00:33:36,308 --> 00:33:38,559
...is the realization of a just society.

688
00:33:39,553 --> 00:33:45,381
Soorgio Armhany offers the best quality,
reasonable prices and fast delivery.

689
00:33:45,465 --> 00:33:48,923
We're here to realize a just society
that everyone dreams of.

690
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:50,880
"www dot..."

691
00:33:51,016 --> 00:33:52,814
Tell me the truth.

692
00:33:52,902 --> 00:33:54,880
Who were you hugging in the park?

693
00:33:54,964 --> 00:33:56,207
I don't know!

694
00:33:56,292 --> 00:33:57,111
What?!

695
00:33:57,195 --> 00:33:59,194
So, you were hugging
a stranger in the park?!

696
00:33:59,476 --> 00:34:01,162
I just hugged him because I liked him.

697
00:34:01,246 --> 00:34:02,541
I'm promiscuous, remember?

698
00:34:03,412 --> 00:34:05,918
You don't have to yell.

699
00:34:06,003 --> 00:34:09,627
I'm just trying to make sure
you're not dating Jungi.

700
00:34:09,711 --> 00:34:12,266
Do you hate Jungi that much?

701
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:13,184
What?

702
00:34:13,578 --> 00:34:14,411
Hey.

703
00:34:14,979 --> 00:34:16,438
Why would I hate Junggi?

704
00:34:16,522 --> 00:34:18,616
I like him.

705
00:34:18,700 --> 00:34:22,230
He's immature but has a good heart.

706
00:34:22,522 --> 00:34:23,895
He's sometimes considerate too.

707
00:34:24,194 --> 00:34:25,164
But!

708
00:34:25,552 --> 00:34:29,200
I don't want him
as my brother-in-law. That's all.

709
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:30,401
Yeah?

710
00:34:31,017 --> 00:34:35,006
I'm just asking this hypothetically.

711
00:34:35,253 --> 00:34:37,742
What are you going to do
if Jungi and I are actually dating?

712
00:34:37,827 --> 00:34:39,160
Are you going to beat him up?

713
00:34:39,244 --> 00:34:41,793
Are you crazy? I can't hit him.

714
00:34:42,542 --> 00:34:45,055
But if that does happen...

715
00:34:45,808 --> 00:34:48,186
...I'll have to do something about you.

716
00:34:48,556 --> 00:34:49,588
M-Me?

717
00:34:50,282 --> 00:34:51,800
What are you going to do?

718
00:34:51,885 --> 00:34:57,513
I know a small temple
that's hidden away deep in the mountain.

719
00:34:58,031 --> 00:34:59,626
The view is great and the water is clean.

720
00:34:59,710 --> 00:35:02,267
No one, not even ants, go near there.

721
00:35:02,735 --> 00:35:03,596
What about it?

722
00:35:03,762 --> 00:35:06,671
I can't stand the thought
of you dating him.

723
00:35:07,274 --> 00:35:11,553
So I'll shave off every strand
of hair on your head...

724
00:35:11,921 --> 00:35:14,418
...and turn you into a Buddhist monk.

725
00:35:14,758 --> 00:35:15,591
Buddhist monk?

726
00:35:21,322 --> 00:35:24,090
Plus, I won't give you any razors.

727
00:35:36,234 --> 00:35:38,522
You know that I don't kid
about this stuff, right?

728
00:35:39,724 --> 00:35:42,874
Yes, I know. Very well.

729
00:35:46,728 --> 00:35:48,487
Kang Donggu!

730
00:35:48,571 --> 00:35:51,650
Why did he drink so much?

731
00:35:53,388 --> 00:35:54,698
Kang Donggu!

732
00:35:55,155 --> 00:35:58,079
I have a confession to make.

733
00:35:58,905 --> 00:36:00,529
A confession? What is it?

734
00:36:06,785 --> 00:36:07,618
What are you doing?

735
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:11,918
I'll man up and tell you everything.

736
00:36:13,702 --> 00:36:14,739
The truth is!

737
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:18,686
Seojin and I...

738
00:36:28,474 --> 00:36:31,025
Kang Seojin! Why did you do that?

739
00:36:31,674 --> 00:36:33,387
I just wanted to shut him up.

740
00:36:33,472 --> 00:36:36,432
He should just go to bed when he's drunk.

741
00:36:36,666 --> 00:36:39,097
I hate everything about him.

742
00:36:42,573 --> 00:36:46,037
She hates him that much?

743
00:36:49,283 --> 00:36:50,726
I got worried for nothing.

744
00:36:51,247 --> 00:36:52,983
Jungi, are you okay?

745
00:36:53,595 --> 00:36:54,428
Jungi.

746
00:36:55,677 --> 00:36:56,778
Bacca.

747
00:36:57,182 --> 00:36:59,140
What happened to me last night?

748
00:37:00,549 --> 00:37:02,466
I remember coming home.

749
00:37:02,807 --> 00:37:05,137
But then I blacked out.

750
00:37:06,490 --> 00:37:07,339
Well...

751
00:37:07,671 --> 00:37:09,616
You fell down.

752
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:10,533
Yeah?

753
00:37:12,038 --> 00:37:14,437
Anyway, I'm sorry.

754
00:37:14,618 --> 00:37:16,998
I'll tell him about us...

755
00:37:17,083 --> 00:37:19,472
...even if I get beaten up to death.

756
00:37:20,149 --> 00:37:22,744
No, no. Don't tell him.

757
00:37:23,393 --> 00:37:25,553
-Why not?
-I've thought about it and...

758
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:28,114
I think it'll be better
to keep it a secret.

759
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:32,459
So, let's keep it a secret forever.

760
00:37:32,773 --> 00:37:33,606
Okay?

761
00:37:33,804 --> 00:37:35,636
Yeah, okay. Got it.

762
00:37:36,352 --> 00:37:38,189
I have to go to the shoot.

763
00:37:38,445 --> 00:37:39,177
Now?

764
00:37:39,261 --> 00:37:41,053
Isn't it in the afternoon?
Why are you going so early?

765
00:37:41,137 --> 00:37:42,615
I should go early and practice.

766
00:37:42,815 --> 00:37:45,429
I'm doing a scene with Min Kiyeong.

767
00:37:45,514 --> 00:37:47,766
Really? You must be so excited.

768
00:37:47,850 --> 00:37:50,101
It feels like my heart
is going to explode.

769
00:37:50,799 --> 00:37:55,025
Shall I charge your energy
to give you strength?

770
00:37:55,109 --> 00:37:55,942
Charge my energy?

771
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:57,673
How?

772
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,549
What do you think? Did it work?

773
00:38:04,857 --> 00:38:05,690
Yeah.

774
00:38:06,227 --> 00:38:09,854
I'm so energized that I can't control it.

775
00:38:14,767 --> 00:38:15,961
Put me down.

776
00:38:16,046 --> 00:38:17,289
Donggu might see us.

777
00:38:17,373 --> 00:38:18,914
I don't care.

778
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:29,487
We got another order.

779
00:38:31,649 --> 00:38:33,780
You're getting some orders now?

780
00:38:34,343 --> 00:38:35,786
Yeah, I guess the promotion worked.

781
00:38:36,501 --> 00:38:39,390
I made this happen. Right, Director Bong?

782
00:38:40,898 --> 00:38:42,055
Where's Yuna?

783
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:43,958
She went to the bakery.

784
00:38:44,043 --> 00:38:45,774
What? So early?

785
00:38:45,858 --> 00:38:49,498
Hyeonjun is letting her sell
her muffins in his bakery.

786
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:52,151
And he's going to split
the profit with her.

787
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:54,782
Oh, I see.

788
00:38:55,483 --> 00:38:57,919
Director Bong, what are you reading?

789
00:38:58,007 --> 00:38:59,286
-Is it good?
-Yeah.

790
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:01,287
-It's really good.
-What's it about?

791
00:39:01,563 --> 00:39:06,157
It's a story of a man pretending
to be terminally ill to keep his woman.

792
00:39:06,242 --> 00:39:08,348
His love is very tragic.

793
00:39:09,114 --> 00:39:12,615
What? Pretending to be
terminally ill to keep his woman?

794
00:39:13,136 --> 00:39:14,965
That's lie.

795
00:39:15,049 --> 00:39:17,967
That's not sad love, it's cowardly.

796
00:39:18,052 --> 00:39:20,575
-What?
-He's being a coward.

797
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:22,398
Just like a certain someone
who's trying to win her over...

798
00:39:22,482 --> 00:39:24,179
...by letting her sell
her muffins in his bakery.

799
00:39:24,422 --> 00:39:25,813
That's not what a real man does.

800
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:27,218
It's so nasty and sneaky.

801
00:39:27,307 --> 00:39:28,153
Right?

802
00:39:30,299 --> 00:39:31,692
Jerk...

803
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,038
"Codename Dubai, Production Department"

804
00:39:43,341 --> 00:39:45,176
-Hello.
-Hello.

805
00:39:45,261 --> 00:39:46,689
Hey.

806
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:48,646
Hi, Jungi.

807
00:39:48,734 --> 00:39:50,683
Say hello to Mr. Min Kiyeong.

808
00:39:51,193 --> 00:39:52,775
Hello, sir.

809
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,880
It's an honor to work with you.

810
00:39:54,965 --> 00:39:58,244
I'm Lee Jungi.
I play the role of Song Junseok.

811
00:39:58,328 --> 00:40:01,913
Oh, so you're playing Dong Dundeok?

812
00:40:02,539 --> 00:40:03,317
Pardon?

813
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,503
You're playing Dung Dundeok?

814
00:40:08,003 --> 00:40:09,419
Yes, I am.

815
00:40:09,701 --> 00:40:11,332
You're handsome.

816
00:40:11,639 --> 00:40:13,091
I look forward to working with you.

817
00:40:18,508 --> 00:40:20,081
Jungi. Why are you laughing?

818
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,376
The way he talks is a bit...

819
00:40:24,077 --> 00:40:26,482
He got a tongue surgery recently.

820
00:40:26,572 --> 00:40:28,813
That's why his accent is funny.

821
00:40:28,897 --> 00:40:31,062
But he will get better soon. Don't worry.

822
00:40:31,349 --> 00:40:32,498
I see.

823
00:40:32,587 --> 00:40:33,828
Ready.

824
00:40:33,917 --> 00:40:34,790
Cue.

825
00:40:35,173 --> 00:40:36,006
Sir.

826
00:40:36,561 --> 00:40:38,703
I can't follow your order.

827
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,373
I'm going to broadcast this story.

828
00:40:42,552 --> 00:40:43,408
What did you say?

829
00:40:43,581 --> 00:40:45,777
Even if it means stepping down
from the anchor seat... No.

830
00:40:46,669 --> 00:40:47,887
Even if it means losing my life,

831
00:40:48,099 --> 00:40:50,715
I'm going to broadcast this story.

832
00:40:51,069 --> 00:40:52,104
Do you understand?

833
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:53,791
Are you really going to do this?

834
00:40:54,004 --> 00:40:54,889
Dung Dundeok.

835
00:40:57,147 --> 00:40:59,194
After everything I've done for you?
Dung Dundeok!

836
00:41:01,768 --> 00:41:02,674
Cut.

837
00:41:03,489 --> 00:41:05,472
Jungi, why do you keep biting your lip?

838
00:41:08,775 --> 00:41:11,734
I'm sorry. My lips are dry.

839
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:13,499
I'm sorry, sir.

840
00:41:13,584 --> 00:41:15,940
It's okay.
It happens when you're nervous.

841
00:41:16,270 --> 00:41:17,528
Let's do the scene again.

842
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:20,107
-Let's take it from Mr. Min's line.
-Okay.

843
00:41:21,771 --> 00:41:22,976
Ready.

844
00:41:23,300 --> 00:41:24,162
Cue!

845
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,667
After everything I've done for you?
Dung Dundeok!

846
00:41:31,223 --> 00:41:32,535
Why do you keep laughing?

847
00:41:33,368 --> 00:41:34,928
Why are you laughing?

848
00:41:35,216 --> 00:41:36,507
Is my acting funny to you?

849
00:41:36,724 --> 00:41:40,046
-No, sir...
-I don't want to hear it.

850
00:41:40,324 --> 00:41:41,169
Director Kim.

851
00:41:41,824 --> 00:41:43,163
Let's take a break.

852
00:41:45,823 --> 00:41:47,151
I'm sorry, sir.

853
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,722
I'm sorry, sir.

854
00:41:49,149 --> 00:41:50,883
Jungi, why do you keep laughing?

855
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:51,986
I'm sorry.

856
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:54,469
Mr. Min's pronunciation
is making me laugh.

857
00:41:54,553 --> 00:41:56,954
Still, how could you laugh
when Mr. Min is acting?

858
00:41:57,038 --> 00:41:58,764
Stop laughing. Understand?

859
00:41:58,916 --> 00:41:59,884
I'm sorry.

860
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,385
Mr. Min.

861
00:42:04,655 --> 00:42:06,138
Darn it.

862
00:42:06,446 --> 00:42:07,615
Dong Dundeok...

863
00:42:08,669 --> 00:42:10,191
I can't stop laughing.

864
00:42:10,843 --> 00:42:12,649
Dong Dundeok. Dong Dundeok...

865
00:42:13,906 --> 00:42:15,400
Get it together.

866
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:17,817
All right, that's great.

867
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,871
How did the meeting go yesterday?

868
00:42:20,416 --> 00:42:22,840
He's letting her sell her muffins
in his bakery?

869
00:42:23,095 --> 00:42:26,807
He's trying to keep him by his side
by using those muffins.

870
00:42:26,892 --> 00:42:29,538
-That jerk...
-Next.

871
00:42:29,623 --> 00:42:33,248
When Sin Hyeonjun infiltrates
the party at the Dubai Hotel...

872
00:42:33,333 --> 00:42:36,280
...where should we hide the air gun?

873
00:42:36,364 --> 00:42:37,938
-I have an idea.
-Okay.

874
00:42:38,022 --> 00:42:40,052
There's a band for the party, right?

875
00:42:40,136 --> 00:42:43,080
Why don't we hide it
in an instrument case?

876
00:42:43,164 --> 00:42:43,997
Hey punk.

877
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:46,049
That was already in "Mission Impossible."

878
00:42:46,133 --> 00:42:49,142
We need something new.

879
00:42:50,416 --> 00:42:52,214
Look, he's doing that again.

880
00:42:53,254 --> 00:42:55,355
Donggu must have an idea again.

881
00:42:55,804 --> 00:42:56,637
Donggu.

882
00:42:57,149 --> 00:42:58,303
Are you getting an idea?

883
00:42:59,494 --> 00:43:00,327
Bread!

884
00:43:00,902 --> 00:43:02,883
"Bread"? What bread?

885
00:43:03,781 --> 00:43:04,615
Bread that you eat?

886
00:43:05,133 --> 00:43:08,286
So, we should hide the air gun
inside a loaf of bread?

887
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:11,160
-That's fresh.
-What?

888
00:43:11,921 --> 00:43:14,038
The air gun is too big to fit
in a loaf of bread.

889
00:43:14,123 --> 00:43:16,598
We'll make a long loaf of bread.

890
00:43:16,683 --> 00:43:18,605
There's food in parties, right?

891
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:21,120
See? It flows so naturally.

892
00:43:21,208 --> 00:43:23,527
Kang Donggu, you did it again.

893
00:43:24,111 --> 00:43:26,938
You could become a director now.

894
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:29,630
-Great. Very impressive.
-Thank you.

895
00:43:32,142 --> 00:43:33,400
You stole my idea again.

896
00:43:33,565 --> 00:43:35,225
I was also thinking about bread.

897
00:43:36,075 --> 00:43:37,706
-Give me a chance.
-Pardon?

898
00:43:39,042 --> 00:43:40,234
I'm sorry.

899
00:43:54,552 --> 00:43:55,965
Hi, Donggu. What brings you here?

900
00:43:57,539 --> 00:43:58,623
Are you here to see Yuna?

901
00:43:58,708 --> 00:43:59,541
No.

902
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:02,507
I'm here to research for a movie prop.

903
00:44:02,673 --> 00:44:04,108
Where is Yuna?

904
00:44:05,574 --> 00:44:07,667
She's in the workroom. Shall I call her?

905
00:44:07,752 --> 00:44:09,114
No, that's fine.

906
00:44:09,436 --> 00:44:13,129
I heard you're letting her sell
her muffins here?

907
00:44:13,213 --> 00:44:14,852
Yes. Right here.

908
00:44:16,721 --> 00:44:18,093
"New item, Do Re Mi Fa Sol muffins"

909
00:44:18,181 --> 00:44:19,357
Oh, these are the muffins.

910
00:44:19,582 --> 00:44:23,770
I didn't think you were the type
that uses dirty tricks.

911
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:24,856
Dirty tricks?

912
00:44:24,940 --> 00:44:29,220
You're trying to win her over
by letting her sell her muffins here.

913
00:44:29,308 --> 00:44:31,004
You're playing dirty.

914
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:32,914
Taking muffins as a hostage?

915
00:44:32,999 --> 00:44:34,551
-What?
-Whatever.

916
00:44:35,376 --> 00:44:38,270
Is there anything here
that can fit an air gun?

917
00:44:38,355 --> 00:44:39,959
Why would you put an air gun
inside a loaf of bread?

918
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:42,507
It's necessary for the story of the movie.

919
00:44:42,591 --> 00:44:44,882
You apparently know nothing about film.

920
00:44:45,158 --> 00:44:49,230
Can you make some bread
that will fit an air gun for us?

921
00:44:49,468 --> 00:44:50,628
Like a loaf bread or something.

922
00:44:50,713 --> 00:44:52,167
Sure, we can do that.

923
00:44:52,251 --> 00:44:54,236
Then, make about 20 for us.

924
00:44:54,771 --> 00:44:57,518
Big enough to fit an air gun. Okay?

925
00:44:57,931 --> 00:44:58,837
Sure.

926
00:45:00,557 --> 00:45:02,221
Donggu, what are you doing here?

927
00:45:02,306 --> 00:45:06,003
Hi, I'm here to research for a movie prop.

928
00:45:06,343 --> 00:45:07,632
I have to go now.

929
00:45:07,717 --> 00:45:08,550
Bye.

930
00:45:09,290 --> 00:45:10,355
Hyeonjun.

931
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:14,245
Let's play this like real men. All right?

932
00:45:24,419 --> 00:45:26,170
Real men don't use dirty tricks.

933
00:45:26,254 --> 00:45:27,929
I can't live like that.

934
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:29,827
He's shameless.

935
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:35,657
My legs!

936
00:45:38,433 --> 00:45:39,402
Donggu!

937
00:45:40,069 --> 00:45:41,087
Are you okay?

938
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:42,740
Donggu, hang on.

939
00:45:43,169 --> 00:45:44,122
Don't touch it!

940
00:45:44,501 --> 00:45:46,711
- Don't touch it!
- Just hang on.

941
00:45:46,872 --> 00:45:47,762
Are you okay?

942
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,538
Call an ambulance!

943
00:45:57,095 --> 00:45:58,589
Hi, Jungi.

944
00:46:00,542 --> 00:46:02,636
What's wrong?

945
00:46:03,045 --> 00:46:04,228
Did something happen?

946
00:46:04,721 --> 00:46:06,751
I almost got fired.

947
00:46:06,906 --> 00:46:07,739
What?

948
00:46:08,009 --> 00:46:08,842
Why?

949
00:46:08,948 --> 00:46:11,497
Mr. Min hurt his tongue.

950
00:46:11,897 --> 00:46:14,672
So, he can't say 'S's and 'J's very well.

951
00:46:15,232 --> 00:46:17,138
And unfortunately my
character's name is...

952
00:46:17,604 --> 00:46:19,139
...is Song Junseok.

953
00:46:19,486 --> 00:46:20,319
And?

954
00:46:20,622 --> 00:46:22,711
Every time he says
my name, it sounds so funny.

955
00:46:23,219 --> 00:46:24,921
Dung Dundeok. Dung Dundeok.

956
00:46:25,342 --> 00:46:26,220
Like that.

957
00:46:26,745 --> 00:46:29,218
The director yelled at me
for laughing at Mr. Min.

958
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:32,043
What? Dung Dundeok, Dung Dundeok?

959
00:46:32,152 --> 00:46:33,224
Yeah.

960
00:46:34,052 --> 00:46:36,463
And he says it with
a serious look on his face.

961
00:46:36,552 --> 00:46:38,576
Dung Dundeok. Dung Dundeok.

962
00:46:38,922 --> 00:46:41,265
I couldn't stop laughing.

963
00:46:41,383 --> 00:46:44,642
Yeah, I can't stop laughing
when I find something funny.

964
00:46:45,643 --> 00:46:47,667
I have to shoot the scene again tomorrow.

965
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,106
What am I going to do?

966
00:46:56,341 --> 00:46:57,174
Donggu.

967
00:46:59,126 --> 00:47:00,041
What happened?

968
00:47:00,129 --> 00:47:01,115
Why are you in a wheelchair?

969
00:47:02,084 --> 00:47:03,821
He hurt his legs.

970
00:47:04,087 --> 00:47:05,387
How?

971
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:08,315
It's nothing.
Don't make a big fuss over it.

972
00:47:08,832 --> 00:47:11,694
Yuna, please take me to my room.

973
00:47:11,778 --> 00:47:12,611
Sure.

974
00:47:17,980 --> 00:47:19,234
This is a problem.

975
00:47:19,501 --> 00:47:22,742
You can't even move
because you hurt both of your legs.

976
00:47:22,826 --> 00:47:23,752
Yeah.

977
00:47:24,279 --> 00:47:28,077
We can help him today
but we all have to go to work tomorrow.

978
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:30,614
Don't worry I'll take care of him.

979
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,070
What about the baking class
and the bakery?

980
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:37,321
I can skip a few classes and I'll ask
Hyeonjun to watch my display stand.

981
00:47:38,674 --> 00:47:42,696
Tell me if you need anything. Okay?

982
00:47:43,170 --> 00:47:44,003
Okay.

983
00:47:44,944 --> 00:47:45,924
Yuna.

984
00:47:46,214 --> 00:47:47,498
I'll rest for now.

985
00:47:58,695 --> 00:48:01,700
She's not going to Hyeonjun?

986
00:48:01,789 --> 00:48:03,325
I'm glad I got hurt.

987
00:48:03,410 --> 00:48:05,483
This is a blessing in disguise.

988
00:48:10,491 --> 00:48:12,851
I slept like a baby.

989
00:48:17,019 --> 00:48:18,784
I need to go to the bathroom.

990
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:28,821
My legs don't hurt.

991
00:48:30,493 --> 00:48:31,647
They're perfectly fine.

992
00:48:33,269 --> 00:48:34,208
Thank goodness.

993
00:48:37,435 --> 00:48:38,682
Morning.

994
00:48:40,793 --> 00:48:41,981
Are your legs okay?

995
00:48:42,065 --> 00:48:44,756
Yes, they feel perfectly fine.

996
00:48:45,765 --> 00:48:47,068
That's a relief.

997
00:48:48,112 --> 00:48:51,362
Then, I'll go to the bakery.

998
00:48:51,467 --> 00:48:53,145
I don't want to leave
my display stand unattended.

999
00:48:53,301 --> 00:48:56,127
Huh? She's going to his bakery again?

1000
00:48:56,212 --> 00:48:58,132
That won't do.

1001
00:49:02,729 --> 00:49:03,627
My legs!

1002
00:49:04,411 --> 00:49:06,076
-Donggu.
-Ouch!

1003
00:49:07,062 --> 00:49:08,446
Donggu, what's wrong?

1004
00:49:08,531 --> 00:49:11,438
I thought my legs were okay
but apparently it still hurts.

1005
00:49:11,523 --> 00:49:12,802
Ouch! Pain!

1006
00:49:13,228 --> 00:49:14,061
Pain!

1007
00:49:14,496 --> 00:49:16,830
It hurts more than yesterday.
What do I do?

1008
00:49:17,077 --> 00:49:20,439
I don't think I can do anything on my own.

1009
00:49:20,761 --> 00:49:22,824
Really? Why is it hurting so suddenly?

1010
00:49:22,908 --> 00:49:24,767
-Oh no...
-I'm sorry.

1011
00:49:25,716 --> 00:49:27,397
You need to go to the bakery.

1012
00:49:27,482 --> 00:49:29,630
No, don't worry about that.

1013
00:49:29,788 --> 00:49:31,820
I'll help you lie down.

1014
00:49:53,398 --> 00:49:55,192
Hello, sir.

1015
00:49:59,823 --> 00:50:02,463
I'm sorry about yesterday.

1016
00:50:02,941 --> 00:50:04,035
Please forgive me.

1017
00:50:06,257 --> 00:50:07,113
It's fine.

1018
00:50:08,029 --> 00:50:10,940
Don't do it again. All right?

1019
00:50:11,045 --> 00:50:13,012
Yes, sir.

1020
00:50:15,118 --> 00:50:16,127
Did you eat?

1021
00:50:16,212 --> 00:50:17,755
No, not yet.

1022
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,869
If you haven't...

1023
00:50:19,194 --> 00:50:21,116
...would you like a dandwich?

1024
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:24,750
Thank you.

1025
00:50:28,080 --> 00:50:29,863
Have some apple duice too.

1026
00:50:34,047 --> 00:50:35,702
What's the matter?

1027
00:50:37,509 --> 00:50:38,410
It's nothing.

1028
00:50:40,093 --> 00:50:41,436
Thank you.

1029
00:50:51,506 --> 00:50:52,516
Dandwich.

1030
00:50:52,759 --> 00:50:53,592
Apple duice.

1031
00:50:55,208 --> 00:50:56,605
It's so funny.

1032
00:50:57,218 --> 00:50:59,330
Everything he says sounds funny.

1033
00:51:02,131 --> 00:51:05,851
I'm going to burst into laughter
when he says "Dong Dundeok".

1034
00:51:07,445 --> 00:51:08,278
No.

1035
00:51:08,693 --> 00:51:10,024
He'll only say it a few times.

1036
00:51:10,813 --> 00:51:12,910
I'll pinch myself and hold it in.

1037
00:51:14,761 --> 00:51:16,374
Delicious dandwich...

1038
00:51:17,713 --> 00:51:18,626
Jungi.

1039
00:51:18,881 --> 00:51:20,596
The writer made some edits.

1040
00:51:20,681 --> 00:51:22,496
There are only a few changes,
so memorize them now.

1041
00:51:22,581 --> 00:51:23,804
Okay.

1042
00:51:27,585 --> 00:51:29,862
"Song Junseok! Song Junseok!
Song Junseok!"

1043
00:51:29,947 --> 00:51:30,831
"Dung Dundeok..."

1044
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:33,287
Darn it!

1045
00:51:36,881 --> 00:51:38,812
Let's start shooting.

1046
00:51:39,056 --> 00:51:40,368
Ready.

1047
00:51:40,751 --> 00:51:41,612
Cue.

1048
00:51:42,050 --> 00:51:42,883
Sir.

1049
00:51:43,278 --> 00:51:45,478
I cannot follow your order.

1050
00:51:46,501 --> 00:51:48,828
I'm going to broadcast this story.

1051
00:51:49,022 --> 00:51:49,690
What?

1052
00:51:49,774 --> 00:51:52,078
Even if it means stepping down
from the anchor seat... No.

1053
00:51:52,797 --> 00:51:54,077
Even if it means losing my life,

1054
00:51:54,354 --> 00:51:55,880
I'm going to broadcast this story.

1055
00:51:55,964 --> 00:51:57,058
Do you understand?

1056
00:51:57,194 --> 00:51:58,960
Dung Dundeok. Dung Dundeok.

1057
00:51:59,044 --> 00:51:59,901
Dung Dundeok!

1058
00:52:01,237 --> 00:52:02,269
How dare you.

1059
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:03,279
Dung Dundeok!

1060
00:52:07,102 --> 00:52:09,441
After everything I've done for you?
Dong Dundeok!

1061
00:52:09,525 --> 00:52:11,128
Dung Dundeok! Dung Dundeok!

1062
00:52:16,552 --> 00:52:18,083
Did you just laugh again?

1063
00:52:18,627 --> 00:52:19,877
What's the matter with you?

1064
00:52:22,343 --> 00:52:23,998
I'm sorry, sir.

1065
00:52:24,134 --> 00:52:26,043
-You think my acting is funny?
-No, sir.

1066
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:28,348
How dare you laugh when I'm acting!

1067
00:52:29,267 --> 00:52:30,100
Director Kim.

1068
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:31,627
I can't do this anymore.

1069
00:52:33,365 --> 00:52:34,042
Sir...

1070
00:52:34,126 --> 00:52:35,846
Mr. Min! Mr. Min!

1071
00:52:37,373 --> 00:52:38,474
Are you crazy?

1072
00:52:38,558 --> 00:52:40,099
Why do you keep laughing?

1073
00:52:40,656 --> 00:52:42,163
-I'm sorry.
-Shut up!

1074
00:52:42,511 --> 00:52:45,327
If he quits, you're done.

1075
00:52:45,431 --> 00:52:46,312
Got it?

1076
00:52:48,595 --> 00:52:49,882
Mr. Min!

1077
00:52:50,284 --> 00:52:51,138
Mr. Min!

1078
00:52:52,071 --> 00:52:53,658
Darn it.

1079
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:57,233
Why do I keep laughing? Why?

1080
00:53:03,843 --> 00:53:06,941
Faking an injury is not easy.

1081
00:53:08,248 --> 00:53:10,126
My body's aching.

1082
00:53:10,485 --> 00:53:14,380
It's worth it if I can keep Yuna
away from Song Hyeonjun.

1083
00:53:17,460 --> 00:53:18,358
My legs...

1084
00:53:18,442 --> 00:53:19,818
Donggu, take your medicine.

1085
00:53:20,137 --> 00:53:20,970
Okay.

1086
00:53:21,192 --> 00:53:22,461
Does it still hurt a lot?

1087
00:53:22,546 --> 00:53:23,380
Yes.

1088
00:53:23,464 --> 00:53:25,474
It's hurting more and more.

1089
00:53:27,318 --> 00:53:30,392
I'm worried I may never walk again.

1090
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:31,681
This is serious.

1091
00:53:32,088 --> 00:53:33,466
Take your medicine first.

1092
00:53:33,551 --> 00:53:34,384
Okay.

1093
00:53:34,809 --> 00:53:37,396
-Can you sit up?
-I'll try my best.

1094
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,355
- Here.
- Thank you.

1095
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:50,960
Don't you need to wash up?

1096
00:53:51,094 --> 00:53:52,670
I want to.

1097
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:54,718
Don't worry about it.

1098
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:57,071
Still, you need to wash up.

1099
00:53:57,333 --> 00:53:59,237
Let's go. I'll help you.

1100
00:54:01,410 --> 00:54:03,363
You really don't need to.

1101
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:04,871
Take it easy.

1102
00:54:05,312 --> 00:54:06,145
Gosh...

1103
00:54:14,558 --> 00:54:15,948
Thank you, Yuna.

1104
00:54:16,033 --> 00:54:17,244
Don't mention it.

1105
00:54:18,285 --> 00:54:19,975
How do we wash your hair?

1106
00:54:20,059 --> 00:54:23,182
It's okay. I'll wash it
when I can move better.

1107
00:54:23,267 --> 00:54:25,198
No, you need to wash your hair.

1108
00:54:25,979 --> 00:54:28,209
I'll wash it for you.

1109
00:54:28,345 --> 00:54:30,228
What? You will?

1110
00:54:31,725 --> 00:54:33,237
You don't have to.

1111
00:54:33,981 --> 00:54:36,201
Shall I lie back? What should I do?

1112
00:54:42,970 --> 00:54:45,349
Darn these legs.

1113
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,276
I'm so sorry.

1114
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,520
It's okay.

1115
00:54:49,684 --> 00:54:50,647
Yes, right there.

1116
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:52,179
Yes.

1117
00:54:52,291 --> 00:54:53,559
Yuna, are you home?

1118
00:54:55,270 --> 00:54:56,763
That sounds like Hyeonjun.

1119
00:55:00,689 --> 00:55:02,564
Hyeonjun, what are you doing here?

1120
00:55:02,916 --> 00:55:04,568
I was worried about Donggu.

1121
00:55:04,652 --> 00:55:08,672
We were having a nice time.
Why is he here?

1122
00:55:08,839 --> 00:55:10,172
Donggu, how are your legs?

1123
00:55:10,257 --> 00:55:11,250
You know.

1124
00:55:12,032 --> 00:55:12,844
They're all right.

1125
00:55:12,928 --> 00:55:14,575
They're hurting more than yesterday.

1126
00:55:14,659 --> 00:55:16,202
He can't move at all by himself.

1127
00:55:16,287 --> 00:55:17,347
Really?

1128
00:55:17,871 --> 00:55:19,338
That's terrible.

1129
00:55:20,639 --> 00:55:23,217
- What are you doing?
- Hello? Hi, Seojin.

1130
00:55:24,053 --> 00:55:24,886
What?

1131
00:55:25,198 --> 00:55:26,207
Really?

1132
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:27,969
Okay.

1133
00:55:28,243 --> 00:55:29,076
Bye.

1134
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:31,515
What did she say?

1135
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:35,436
She left an important document at home
and asked me to bring it to her.

1136
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:37,591
But I can't leave you alone.

1137
00:55:37,675 --> 00:55:38,519
What do I do?

1138
00:55:38,603 --> 00:55:39,682
She's so forgetful.

1139
00:55:39,766 --> 00:55:41,426
You can go. I'll stay.

1140
00:55:42,575 --> 00:55:43,682
Really?

1141
00:55:43,766 --> 00:55:45,930
-I'll be right back.
-Okay.

1142
00:55:47,303 --> 00:55:48,203
Yuna!

1143
00:55:48,288 --> 00:55:49,199
Yuna!

1144
00:55:49,429 --> 00:55:50,979
You can't leave now.

1145
00:55:51,063 --> 00:55:52,191
I'll finish washing your hair.

1146
00:55:52,280 --> 00:55:54,218
What?
Are you crazy?

1147
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:55,585
Don't wash my hair.

1148
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:58,863
You got shampoo in your hair.
We need to wash it.

1149
00:55:58,947 --> 00:56:00,533
I said no thanks.

1150
00:56:00,617 --> 00:56:02,921
Just let me. I'll wash it.

1151
00:56:03,005 --> 00:56:05,511
I said no. Don't touch my hair.

1152
00:56:05,886 --> 00:56:07,344
Hold still.

1153
00:56:10,431 --> 00:56:13,040
I think we need to wash it again.

1154
00:56:13,124 --> 00:56:15,302
No. You got all the shampoo out.

1155
00:56:15,386 --> 00:56:17,390
There's still shampoo in your hair.
I'll get more water.

1156
00:56:17,475 --> 00:56:20,270
Gee, I said no.
Don't touch my hair.

1157
00:56:20,354 --> 00:56:22,405
There's still shampoo in your hair.

1158
00:56:22,489 --> 00:56:24,806
Gee, I said no. You got it all out.

1159
00:56:24,890 --> 00:56:26,225
There's still some left.

1160
00:56:26,314 --> 00:56:28,088
-What're wrong with you?
-Let me go.

1161
00:56:34,648 --> 00:56:38,107
I said no! Look what you've done.

1162
00:56:38,389 --> 00:56:39,312
I'm sorry.

1163
00:56:39,871 --> 00:56:43,164
It's all wet. You need to get changed.

1164
00:56:43,248 --> 00:56:45,310
Where's your room? I'll change you.

1165
00:56:45,394 --> 00:56:47,800
What? Change me?

1166
00:56:47,884 --> 00:56:49,628
Unbelievable.

1167
00:56:51,939 --> 00:56:53,367
-Should I put you down?
-Yes!

1168
00:56:53,452 --> 00:56:54,478
What are you doing?

1169
00:56:56,536 --> 00:56:58,621
I'll change your clothes.

1170
00:56:59,471 --> 00:57:02,369
There's no need. I told you I'm fine.

1171
00:57:02,453 --> 00:57:04,721
Just stay still.

1172
00:57:04,992 --> 00:57:05,938
Which one should I...

1173
00:57:06,022 --> 00:57:07,548
Let's change your pants first.

1174
00:57:08,477 --> 00:57:10,494
What's the matter with you?

1175
00:57:11,093 --> 00:57:13,267
Let go. I want to do this for you.

1176
00:57:14,035 --> 00:57:15,340
I'll do it myself.

1177
00:57:15,461 --> 00:57:16,932
I'll do it myself.

1178
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:18,017
How?

1179
00:57:18,814 --> 00:57:21,025
You said you can't move at all.

1180
00:57:22,386 --> 00:57:23,852
Were you faking your injury?

1181
00:57:24,695 --> 00:57:25,542
What?

1182
00:57:25,873 --> 00:57:27,044
Fake my injury?

1183
00:57:27,262 --> 00:57:29,502
How dare you.

1184
00:57:29,586 --> 00:57:31,350
So, just hold still.

1185
00:57:36,126 --> 00:57:37,506
Even your underwear is all wet.

1186
00:57:37,883 --> 00:57:39,133
We need to change your underwear too.

1187
00:57:39,218 --> 00:57:41,415
My underwear? Do you have no boundaries?

1188
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,794
Just hold still.

1189
00:57:49,154 --> 00:57:50,100
It's off.

1190
00:57:51,609 --> 00:57:53,579
Where's your underwear?

1191
00:57:54,915 --> 00:57:55,938
Hey!

1192
00:57:56,381 --> 00:57:58,442
You can't leave me like this.

1193
00:58:11,386 --> 00:58:12,480
Hi, Bacca.

1194
00:58:12,665 --> 00:58:15,212
Jungi, how is your shoot going?

1195
00:58:15,317 --> 00:58:16,228
Bad.

1196
00:58:16,312 --> 00:58:19,576
I laughed at Mr. Min again
and the director yelled at me.

1197
00:58:20,426 --> 00:58:23,258
I think he'll fire me if I laugh again.

1198
00:58:23,342 --> 00:58:24,509
Oh no.

1199
00:58:24,919 --> 00:58:28,061
Think about something else
when you feel like laughing.

1200
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,345
Like something sad.

1201
00:58:29,430 --> 00:58:30,893
I already tried that.

1202
00:58:31,322 --> 00:58:33,762
I tried pinching my thighs
and biting my tongue.

1203
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,162
"Dong Dundeok".

1204
00:58:35,583 --> 00:58:37,643
When he says that, I can't help myself.

1205
00:58:37,728 --> 00:58:38,886
Nothing works.

1206
00:58:38,970 --> 00:58:41,424
Really? What do we do?

1207
00:58:42,807 --> 00:58:43,640
Jungi.

1208
00:58:44,152 --> 00:58:45,487
How about this?

1209
00:58:46,048 --> 00:58:46,929
What?

1210
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:50,509
Sir.

1211
00:58:51,289 --> 00:58:53,445
I'm sorry about before.

1212
00:58:53,889 --> 00:58:56,740
It will never happen again.

1213
00:58:56,825 --> 00:58:57,658
Fine.

1214
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:01,459
If you laugh one more time...

1215
00:59:01,598 --> 00:59:02,896
...you'll be in trouble.

1216
00:59:02,981 --> 00:59:03,872
Got it?

1217
00:59:04,046 --> 00:59:04,879
Yes, sir.

1218
00:59:05,112 --> 00:59:06,410
I understand, sir.

1219
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,062
Let's start shooting.

1220
00:59:09,147 --> 00:59:10,213
Ready.

1221
00:59:11,141 --> 00:59:11,974
Cue.

1222
00:59:12,897 --> 00:59:13,720
Sir.

1223
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:16,159
I can't follow your order.

1224
00:59:17,055 --> 00:59:19,503
I'm going to broadcast this story.

1225
00:59:19,592 --> 00:59:20,469
What did you say?

1226
00:59:20,558 --> 00:59:22,907
Even if it means stepping down
from the anchor seat... No.

1227
00:59:23,226 --> 00:59:24,411
Even if it means losing my life...

1228
00:59:24,496 --> 00:59:26,831
...I'm going to broadcast this story.

1229
00:59:27,284 --> 00:59:28,383
Do you understand?

1230
00:59:28,468 --> 00:59:29,447
Dung Dundeok.

1231
00:59:29,531 --> 00:59:31,527
Dung Dundeok. Dung Dundeok!

1232
00:59:31,875 --> 00:59:33,742
How dare you. Dung Dundeok!

1233
00:59:42,649 --> 00:59:44,029
Darn it.

1234
00:59:45,024 --> 00:59:46,899
If I laugh now, I'll get fired.

1235
00:59:47,386 --> 00:59:48,569
What do I do?

1236
00:59:49,803 --> 00:59:50,636
Wait.

1237
00:59:51,359 --> 00:59:53,262
Maybe I should try what Seojin told me.

1238
00:59:54,541 --> 00:59:56,037
When you feel like laughing...

1239
00:59:56,126 --> 00:59:58,297
...think of something
that you're most terrified of.

1240
00:59:58,452 --> 01:00:00,617
You know, something
that sends chills down your spine...

1241
01:00:00,706 --> 01:00:01,975
...just by hearing about it.

1242
01:00:02,219 --> 01:00:03,053
Yes.

1243
01:00:03,369 --> 01:00:05,231
I have nothing to lose.

1244
01:00:05,316 --> 01:00:07,002
Let's give it a try.

1245
01:00:08,199 --> 01:00:10,828
After everything I've done for you?
Dung Dundeok!

1246
01:00:15,826 --> 01:00:19,784
I'll send you to your grave.

1247
01:00:19,873 --> 01:00:21,417
Dung Dundeok!

1248
01:00:24,055 --> 01:00:29,183
I'll send you to your grave.

1249
01:00:29,592 --> 01:00:30,758
Dung Dundeok!

1250
01:00:30,842 --> 01:00:34,159
I'll send you to your grave.

1251
01:00:34,244 --> 01:00:36,303
I'll send you to your grave.

1252
01:00:36,388 --> 01:00:37,764
I'll send you to your grave.

1253
01:00:37,848 --> 01:00:39,269
Dung Dundeok!

1254
01:00:40,021 --> 01:00:44,156
I'll send you to your grave.

1255
01:00:49,274 --> 01:00:52,179
Your career is over.

1256
01:00:52,332 --> 01:00:54,026
Got it? Dung Dundeok!

1257
01:00:55,529 --> 01:00:56,725
Do as you please.

1258
01:00:57,332 --> 01:00:58,455
But, sir...

1259
01:00:58,807 --> 01:01:00,517
The press shouldn't cover up issues.

1260
01:01:01,124 --> 01:01:04,327
The press shouldn't distort the truth
or stir up divisions.

1261
01:01:04,799 --> 01:01:08,067
The press shouldn't distort
or cover up facts.

1262
01:01:08,158 --> 01:01:11,733
That is the duty and fate of journalists.

1263
01:01:12,126 --> 01:01:13,236
Do you understand?

1264
01:01:13,643 --> 01:01:15,738
Cut! Okay.

1265
01:01:15,822 --> 01:01:17,931
That was very nice, Jungi.

1266
01:01:18,721 --> 01:01:19,696
Thank you.

1267
01:01:20,618 --> 01:01:22,778
-Great job, sir.
-Well done.

1268
01:01:23,022 --> 01:01:25,315
Why didn't you do this earlier?

1269
01:01:25,772 --> 01:01:28,032
That was great acting.

1270
01:01:30,283 --> 01:01:31,405
Thank you, sir.

1271
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:33,012
Thank you, sir.

1272
01:01:35,088 --> 01:01:37,544
Thanks, Donggu. You saved me.

1273
01:01:40,785 --> 01:01:43,216
This is so embarrassing.

1274
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:46,507
I can't believe I show him my...

1275
01:01:47,379 --> 01:01:52,422
Why do these things happen
when he's around?

1276
01:01:56,977 --> 01:01:58,826
Sorry I'm late.

1277
01:01:58,915 --> 01:02:00,346
I took the wrong bus.

1278
01:02:00,430 --> 01:02:01,859
It's okay.

1279
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,706
Is Donggu okay?

1280
01:02:05,249 --> 01:02:06,588
Did something happen?

1281
01:02:06,727 --> 01:02:07,707
Actually...

1282
01:02:11,831 --> 01:02:13,518
No, nothing happened.

1283
01:02:13,768 --> 01:02:14,882
That's good.

1284
01:02:15,244 --> 01:02:16,725
Thanks for your help, Hyeonjun.

1285
01:02:16,809 --> 01:02:18,677
I'm glad I could help.

1286
01:02:18,833 --> 01:02:20,062
I'll get going.

1287
01:02:20,147 --> 01:02:21,734
I'll walk you out.

1288
01:02:21,819 --> 01:02:22,829
Wait.

1289
01:02:23,765 --> 01:02:26,504
I'll see him off. You can stay here.

1290
01:02:27,064 --> 01:02:30,646
He took care of me today,
so I should see him off.

1291
01:02:39,611 --> 01:02:40,457
Don't touch me.

1292
01:02:47,595 --> 01:02:48,627
Wait.

1293
01:02:49,172 --> 01:02:50,693
We need to talk.

1294
01:02:51,571 --> 01:02:54,603
Let's forget about what happened today.

1295
01:02:55,068 --> 01:02:56,745
You know, I saw your...

1296
01:02:57,260 --> 01:02:58,113
Remember?

1297
01:02:58,198 --> 01:02:59,865
Both of us could get hurt.

1298
01:02:59,953 --> 01:03:00,786
Understand?

1299
01:03:02,565 --> 01:03:04,557
Okay, let's forget it happened.

1300
01:03:04,832 --> 01:03:05,830
All right?

1301
01:03:06,038 --> 01:03:06,871
Yes.

1302
01:03:07,196 --> 01:03:08,029
Let's forget it.

1303
01:03:08,862 --> 01:03:11,712
Did you really come
because you were worried about me?

1304
01:03:11,796 --> 01:03:12,629
Yes.

1305
01:03:13,136 --> 01:03:15,313
I came because I wanted you
to get well soon.

1306
01:03:15,474 --> 01:03:17,196
- Really?
- Yes.

1307
01:03:17,461 --> 01:03:19,599
So that I can see Yuna again.

1308
01:03:19,683 --> 01:03:23,057
So you came because of Yuna, not me.

1309
01:03:23,518 --> 01:03:25,814
Real men don't do that.

1310
01:03:25,903 --> 01:03:28,630
Faking an injury isn't that manly either.

1311
01:03:28,922 --> 01:03:29,756
What...

1312
01:03:29,935 --> 01:03:31,046
What did you say?

1313
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:33,748
Faking an injury?

1314
01:03:33,833 --> 01:03:36,417
Are you implying
that I'm faking my leg injury?

1315
01:03:36,501 --> 01:03:38,144
Never mind if you're not.

1316
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,485
Hope you get better soon.

1317
01:03:41,077 --> 01:03:41,910
Bye.

1318
01:03:44,701 --> 01:03:46,063
I will never get better.

1319
01:03:46,147 --> 01:03:48,058
I'd be doing you a favor.

1320
01:03:48,349 --> 01:03:51,269
He's not even listening to me.

1321
01:03:53,829 --> 01:03:56,428
I think he knows that I'm faking it.

1322
01:03:57,431 --> 01:03:58,264
What the!

1323
01:03:58,656 --> 01:04:00,379
Did he do it on purpose?

1324
01:04:00,482 --> 01:04:01,315
That jerk.

1325
01:04:09,344 --> 01:04:10,272
Yuna!

1326
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:11,279
Yuna!

1327
01:04:12,151 --> 01:04:13,154
Let me see.

1328
01:04:13,239 --> 01:04:14,560
Does it hurt a lot? Are you okay?

1329
01:04:14,644 --> 01:04:15,827
I'm okay.

1330
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:19,617
-Your legs...
-What?

1331
01:04:27,441 --> 01:04:29,666
Ouch. My legs!

1332
01:04:29,750 --> 01:04:31,486
Ouch...

1333
01:04:31,571 --> 01:04:34,164
You run pretty well for someone
who can't move at all.

1334
01:04:34,249 --> 01:04:35,914
I thought you were Usain Bolt.

1335
01:04:36,429 --> 01:04:38,590
You've been faking it the whole time?

1336
01:04:38,756 --> 01:04:41,005
I wasn't faking it.

1337
01:04:41,089 --> 01:04:42,645
I, um...

1338
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:45,790
I guess I had superhuman strength
for a moment.

1339
01:04:45,874 --> 01:04:47,207
That's ridiculous.

1340
01:04:47,412 --> 01:04:49,150
Stop pretending and get up.

1341
01:04:49,234 --> 01:04:51,359
I'm not pretending.

1342
01:04:51,444 --> 01:04:55,014
I'm Kang Donggu. A man of men.

1343
01:04:55,556 --> 01:04:56,532
Yeah?

1344
01:04:56,647 --> 01:04:59,963
Then use your superhuman strength
to come back inside.

1345
01:05:01,407 --> 01:05:02,248
Yuna.

1346
01:05:02,699 --> 01:05:05,479
Yuna, wait for me.

1347
01:05:05,564 --> 01:05:07,998
My legs really hurt. Come on.

1348
01:05:08,083 --> 01:05:11,472
Yuna, help me sit
on the wheelchair at least.

1349
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:12,918
Yuna...

1350
01:05:13,986 --> 01:05:15,383
My legs really hurt.

1351
01:05:16,600 --> 01:05:18,352
The ground is really cold.

1352
01:05:44,874 --> 01:05:48,061
"Welcome to Waikiki"

1353
01:05:48,146 --> 01:05:49,515
Donggu, are you free tomorrow?

1354
01:05:49,604 --> 01:05:50,832
Where and what time shall we meet?

1355
01:05:50,916 --> 01:05:52,432
Oh, you're wearing the sweatshirt.

1356
01:05:52,516 --> 01:05:53,349
Yuna.

1357
01:05:54,241 --> 01:05:55,509
Why are you here?

1358
01:05:55,593 --> 01:05:57,744
Why are you sitting next to Yuna?

1359
01:05:57,828 --> 01:05:59,381
That camera is the prize?

1360
01:05:59,466 --> 01:06:02,347
Hyeonjun, can we enter
a couple's event together?

1361
01:06:02,436 --> 01:06:03,783
I'm going to the meeting
with the ad agency.

1362
01:06:03,867 --> 01:06:07,262
Smile is the most important
in this commercial.

1363
01:06:07,828 --> 01:06:08,535
Are you okay?

1364
01:06:08,619 --> 01:06:09,913
-I'm okay.
-What the...?

1365
01:06:09,998 --> 01:06:11,059
I'm fine.

1366
01:06:11,144 --> 01:06:12,383
The next important thing
is facial expressions.

1367
01:06:12,468 --> 01:06:13,866
It looks so good.

1368
01:06:14,141 --> 01:06:15,559
-It's so sour!
-The game is on.

1369
01:06:15,643 --> 01:06:17,654
-Can I borrow your car?
-You know how to drive, right?

1370
01:06:17,738 --> 01:06:18,431
Of course.

1371
01:06:18,515 --> 01:06:20,653
-Which one is the brake?
-What?

1372
01:06:20,737 --> 01:06:22,908
Slow down. You're going too fast.

1373
01:06:22,997 --> 01:06:24,063
Brake!

1374
01:06:24,148 --> 01:06:25,965
-What's this?
-Is this the brake?

1375
01:06:26,050 --> 01:06:28,134
The emergency brake. This car is a junk.

1376
01:06:28,904 --> 01:06:31,281
Dusik, what do we do?
